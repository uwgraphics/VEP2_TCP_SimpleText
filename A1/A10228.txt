TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE BY THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, LORD
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBVRIE, Primate and Metropolitan of all ENGLAND, and one of
his Majesty's most Honorable Privy COUNCIL.
MOst Reverend, Duty makes me bold, even at my first looking and leaping out
of the dungeon of Obscurity, which hitherto had enclosed me, to interrupt your
more serious affairs, with the view of these my labors. It is not their
worth, but your worthiness that causes this presumption. For to whom should I
rather present my first fruits, then unto the High Priest, That he might shake
them before the Lord, to make them acceptable? Neither is any meeter to
Patronise a History of Religion, then he, to whose Person Religion gives, and
from the same mutually receives, Patronage. And therefore I, the meanest of
Leui's sons, do here offer unto your Grace, ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA, and
that in their withered and fouler hue of passed out-worne rites, or present
Irreligious Religions; not washed with the purer streams of sacred Baptism.
EVROPE challenges a room in this kind by her self: nor would Christian
History vouchsafe these Strangers her holy company, and therefore has
enjoined me a second Pilgrimage, and Perambulation over the World, to trace her
footsteps, and observe every where her Planters, Corrupters, and Reformers.

Great is this burden of atwofold World, and requires both an Atlas and an
Hercules too, to undergo it. The newness also makes it more difficult, being
an enterprise never yet (to my knowledge) by any, in any language, attempted;
conioyning thus Antiquity and Modern history, in the observations of all the
rarities of the World, and especially of that soul of the world, RELIGION. Yet
have I adventured, and (I speak it not to boast, but to excuse my self, in so
haughty designs) this my first Voyage of Discovery, besides mine own poor
stock laid thereon, has made me indebted to seven hundred Authors, of one
or other kind, in I know not how many hundreds of their Treatises, Epistles,
Relations and Histories, of diverse subjects and Languages, borrowed by my
self; besides what (for want of the Authors themselves) I have taken upon
trust, of other men's goods in their hands. Wherein had I enjoyed that
Academicke leisure, (...) Or the benefits of greater Libraries, or conference
with men more skilful: my Brain might have yielded a fairer issue, a more
complete and better-armed Minerua. But besides the want of these, the daily
cares of my Family, the weekly duties (in Preaching and Catechizing) of my
Ministry, the grossness of the Air where I live, which (some say) makes a
duller wit, I am sure, a sicklier body; maypleade excuse for me. If not, Clades
Authore leuatur, The World is the weight that presses me, and my book shall
have this praise in the greatest dispraise, Magnis tamen excidit ausis.

Howsoever; I shall think my self happy in your Graces Examination and
Censure, if it be not Impiety in me to offer to intercept, and with
interposition of these lines a while to Eclipse, your Gracious aspect and
influence unto our Church and State. And though your Grace cannot, for more
necessary employments, and needs not, as knowing them better already, afford
your Precious time to these things of baser worth: Yet if your Recreations
shall vouchsafe them as Remembrancers, out of my labors to refresh yours, I
shall be more then sufficiently recompensed. Others may hence learn by that
most laborious, though not mostlearned argument of Induction, two lessons
fitting these times, the Unnaturalness of FACTION and ATHEISM: That law of
Nature having written in the practice of all men (as we here in the particulars
do show) the profession of some Religion; and in that Religion, wheresoever
any society of Priests or Religious persons, are, or have been in the World,
no admittance of Paritie; the Angels in Heaven, Devils in hell, (as the
Royallest of Fathers, the Father of our Country has pronounced) and all
Religions on Earth, as here we show, being equally subject to inequality, that
is, to the equity of subordinate Order. And if I live to finish the rest, I
hope to show the Paganism of Antichristian Popery, and other Pseudo-Christian
heresies; and the Truth of Christianity as it is now professed and established
in our Church, under the Great Defender of the Faith: for whose long Reign,
and your Graces prosperous service under so Religious a Sovereign, I heartily
pray unto the King of Kings, and chief Shepherd of our Souls, JESUS CHRIST.
Nouemb. 5. 1612.

Your Graces in all duty, Samuel Purchase.
TO THE READER.
AND now, Reader, I come unto thee, with whom I dare be somewhat bolder.
Being, I know not by what natural inclination, addicted to the study of
History, my heart would sometimes object a self-love, in following my private
delights in that kind. At last, I resolved to turn the pleasures of my studies
into studious pains, that others might again, by delightful study, turn my
pains into their pleasure. I here bring Religion from Paradise to the Arc,
and thence follow her round about the World, and (for her sake) observe the
World it self, with the several Countries and peoples therein; the chief
Empires and States; their private and public Customs; their manifold chances
and changes; also the wonderful and most remarkable effects of Nature; Events
of Divine and Humane Providence, Rarities of Art; and whatsoever I find by
relations of Historians, as I pass, most worthy the writing. Religion is my
more proper aim, and therefore I insist longer on the description of
whatsoever I find belonging thereto; declaring the Religion of the first men;
the corrupting of it before, and after the Flood; the lewish observations; the
Idols, Idolatries, Temples, Priests, Feasts, Fastes, Opinions, Sects, Orders
and Sacred Customs of the Heathens; with the Alterations and Successions that
have therein happened, from the beginning of the World hitherto.

This Work I divide into four parts. This first exhibiteth, Relations and
Theological discovery of ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA: The second, when God
will, shall do the same for EVROPE: The third and fourth, in a second
visitation, shall observe such things in the same places, as I hold most
remarkable in the Christian and Ecclesiastical History; and that according
to the same method, which is squared in the Whole by order of Place: going
still out of one Country into the next, in each particular part and several
Country, by the order of Time; deducing our Relations, so far as we have
others foot-prints to guide us, (though not exactly naming the day and year,
and determining questions in Chronologicall controuerfies, yet in some
convenient sort) from the Ancient times, and by degrees descending to the
present. If thou demaundest what profit may be hereof; I answer, That here
Students of all sorts may find matter fitting there Studies: The natural
Philosophers may observe the different constitution and commixtion of the
Elements, their diverse working in diverse places, the variety of heavenly
influence, of the yearly seasons, of the Creatures in the Air, Water, Earth:
They which delight in State-affaires, may observe the variety of States and
Kingdoms, with their differing Laws, Politics, and Customs, their Beginnings
and Endings. The Divine, besides the former, may here contemplate the works of
God, not in Creation alone, but in his Justice and Providence, pursuing sin
every were with such dreadful plagues; both bodily, in rooting up and pulling
down the mightiest Empires; and especially in spiritual Judgments, giving up
so great a part of the World unto the efficacy of Error in strong delusions,
that having forsaken the fountain of living waters, they should dig unto
themselves these broken pittes that can hold no water; devout in their
superstitions, and superstitiuous in their devotions; agreeing all in this,
that there should be a Religion; disagreeing from each other, and the TRVTH,
in the practice thereof.

Likewise our Ministers may be incited unto all godly labors in their
function of preaching the Gospel, seeing otherwise, for outward and bodily
ceremonies, the Turks and Jews in their manifold devotions in their Oratories
every day, and other Heathen would convince us of Idleness. And let me have
leave to speak it for the glory of God, and the good of our Church; I cannot
find any Priests in all this my Pilgrimage, of whom we have any exact
History, but take more bodily pains in their devotions, than is performed by
not-preaching Ministers, especially in Countrie-villages, where on the week
days they cannot have occasion, or company, for public prayers: and
therefore if they only read the service then, and never study for more (which
I would it were not the idle practice of some) even the Heathen shall rise up
in judgment against them. I subscribe with hand and practice to our Liturgy,
but not to such Lethargy: whose darkness is so much the more intolerable, in
this Sunshine of the Gospel, wherein we have a gracious King, so diligent a
frequenter of Sermons; and Reverend Bishops (notwithstanding other their
weighty Ecclesiastical employments) yet diligent Preachers.

The studious of Geographie may somewhat be helped in that kind: not that we
intend an exact Geographie, in mentioning every City with the degrees of
longitude and latitude, but yet limiting every Country in his true situation
and bounds; and performing happily more then some, which take upon them the
title of Geographers, as their chief profession: and more then any, which I
know, has done in our language.

He which admireth and almost adoreth the Capuchine Jesuit, or other Romanists
for selfe-inflicted whippings, fastings, watchings, vows of obedience,
poverty, and single life, and their not sparing their limbs and lives for
their wil-worships, may see, in all these, the Romanists equalled by Heathens,
if not out-stripped even by the reports of the Jesuits and other their
Catholics. I. Tim. 4.8.
Bodily exercise profits little, but Godliness is profitable unto all, and
has the promise of this life and that which is to come.

Here also the Reader may see most of their Popish Rites, derived out of
Chaldaean, Egyptian, and other fountains of Paganism; as in the later task
we shall have more occasion to show. Here every Englishman may see cause to
praise God continually for the light of his truth, communicated to us: whereas
it is (in comparison) but a small part of the world, that sounds the sacred
name of JESUS; and of those that profess it, how infinite are the sects and
superstitions? God has showed his Word unto our JACOB (THE DEFENDER OF HIS
FAITH) his Statutes and his judgments unto this Israel of Great Britain. He
has not dealt so with every Nation, neither have the Heathen, nor scarsely, if
sarcely any other Christian Nation, so much knowledge of his judgments. And yet
how seditious are some? how profane are other? how unthankful the most? That
beastly Sin of Drunkenness, that biting Sin of Usury, that Deuilish Sin
of Swaggering, ruffling in deformity of clothes, like monstrous Chimaeras, and
barking out a multiformitie of oaths, like hellish Cerberi, as if men could
not be Gallants, unless they turned Devils: These are the payments we return
unto the Lord, instead of prayers for, and loialtie to his Majesty;
peaceablenesse and charity to each others; modesty and sobriety in our
selves.

For the form, I have sought in some places, with variety of phrase, in all,
with variety of matter, to draw thee along with me in this tedious
Pilgrimage. Some names are written diuersely, according to the differing Copies
which I followed, which thy discretion will easily conceiu.e I do not in
every question set down my censure; sometimes, because it were more then
needs; sometimes because of the difficulty. I mention Authors sometimes, of
mean quality, for the meanest have sense to observe that which themselves
see, more certainly then the contemplations and Theorie of the more learned. I
would also acknowledge the labor of the meanest. I have labored to reduce
relations to their first Authors, setting their names to their allegations:
the want where of has much troubled me, whilst the most leave out their
Authors, as if their own assertion were sufficient authority in things
borrowed. I have (to my great pains) contracted and epitomized whole volumes
(and some very large) into one chapter; a thing usual through these relations.
Where I have found plentiful discourse for Religion (my chief aim) I am
shorter in other relations; and where I have had less helps for that
discovery, I insift more on the wonders of Nature, and discoueries by Sea and
Land, with other remarkable accidents. These Rarities of Nature I have
sometimes suited in a differing phrase and figure of speech; not that I affect a
fantastical singularity; but that these divine works might appear in Robes,
if not fitting their Majesty, yet such as our Word-Robe did willingly without
any great affectation or study, afford: not without example of the Scripture,
which uses to bring in the mute creatures, speaking and performing, (as it
were) other personal offices; nor without this effect, to make the Reader
stay a while with observation and wonder; besides that variety, of it self,
is delightsome.

If any mislike the fullness in some places, and the barrenness of words in
others; let them consider, we handle a World, where are mountains and
valleys, fertile habitations, and sandy deserts: and others steps, whom I
follow, hold me sometimes in a narrower way, which elsewhere take more
liberty. I touch sometimes a Controversy; both for illustration of History;
and in season, and out of season, to show my affection to the truth.

Now if any man think, that it were better these rotten bones of the passed
and stinking bodies of the present Superstitions were buried, then thus raked
out of their graves; besides that which has been said, I answer, That I have
sufficient example in the Scriptures, which were written for our learning to
the ends of the World, and yet depaint unto us the ugly face of Idolatry in so
many Countries of the Heathens, with the Apoitasies, Sects, and Heresies of the
Jews, as in our first and second book is showed: and the Ancient Fathers
also, Justin, Tertullian, Clemens, Irenaeus, Origin, and more fully, Eusebius,
Epiphanius, and Augustine, have gone before us in their large Catalogues of
Heresies and false Opinions. And what does more set forth the glory of Gods
grace, then in pardoning; his power, then in reforming; his justice, then in
giving men up to such delusions? Are not these the Trophies and glorious
victories of THE CROSS OF CHRIST, that has subverted the Temples, Oracles,
Sacrifices, and Services of the Devil? And may not thou see herein, what Man
is, and thou thy self may be, if God leave thee to thy self? Read
therefore, with praises unto God, the father of thy light; and prayers, for
these Heathens, that GOD may bring them out of the snare of the Devil, and
that Christ may be his salvation to the ends of the World.

And let me also obtain thy prayers in this my Pilgrimage, to be therein
directed, to the glory of God, and good of my Country. Even so Lord JESUS. (*)

The Catalogue of the Authors.
I Have here mustered in thy view, Courteous Reader, those Authors which from
mine own sight I have mentioned in this Work. Some of them, I confess, are
of no great note, and some are noted for notorious counterfeits: but all are of
some use, and meet to be here placed, that they may have their due: some of
thankfulness for their worthy and great industry (wherein those deserve a
place though otherwise obscure, who by their Nauigations and Discoueries, have
made the world known to it self) others, that they may be known to be lies
and mere changelings: I was the rather induced to guie thee a Table of their
names, because nothing in the Impression has escaped more faulty then the
misse-naming (besides the Where you have not the Authors rightly placed in the
Margin, you shall find it near the same place.
Marginall misse-placing) of Authors; of which I thought good here to give
notice; the other faults being such (except a few which have in the Press has
caused) as the judicious Reader may easily see and amend. I acknowledge that
Ramusius and M. Hakluyt, in their Books of Voyages, have been two Libraries
unto me of many Nauigations and Discoueries, here mentioned. In this, and all
kinds, Sacred, Profane, Learned, Unlearned, Ancient, Modern, Good, and Bad; I
have toyled my self to benefit thee. Some hundreds more I could have added to
this Catalogue, if I should follow others examples: but some I did not mention
in my book, as having nothing new; some for some causes I would not, and some
were namelesse, and I could not: besides, such as I borrowed at the second
hand; also the holy Scriptures, and Apocrypha-Authors: many Dictionaries of
diverse sorts, Authors of Maps, Translators, and Translations in diverse
languages of the same Books, wherewith I consulted, many Manuscripts, and many
Relations from friends of mine yet living: all which I have made use of, and
mentioned the most in my Book, but have not here added, lest it might savor
of Arrogance and Ambition: and the Table is long enough without them. The
letter F signifies that we have but a fragment of the said Author: and Ps.
brands him for a counterfeit.

THE FIRST PART OF THE RELATIONS OF THE WORLD, AND THE RELIGIONS OBSERVED IN
ALL AGES AND Places discovered, from the Creation, unto this present.
THE FIRST BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Of God, one in Nature, three in Persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

THE Poets were wont to lay the foundations and first beginnings of their
poetical Fabrikes, Homer, Virgil, Ovid, etc.
with invocation of their Gods and Muses, although those works were suitable to
such workmen, who according to their names were Makers, of those both Poems and
Gods. I, as far short of their learning, as beyond them in the scope of my
desires, would so far imitate their manner, in this matter which I intend;
that, although I envy not to some their foolish claim of that Poetical (not
prophetical) inheritance, to make my Maker: and my matter, as in a History
(not a Poem) must be made to my hands: Yet in a History of Religion, which
has or should have God to be the Apoc. 1.9.
Alpha and Omega, the efficient, from whom, the end to whom it proceeds: the
matter, of whom, the form by whom and whose direction, it entreats; I could
not but make a religion to begin this discourse of Religion at him; this being
the way which all men take to come to him. First therefore I beseech him that
is the first and last, the eternal Father, in the name of his beloved and
only Son, by the light of his holy and all-seeing Spirit, to guide me in
this perambulation of the World, so to take view of the Times, Places, and
Customs therein, as may testify my religious bond to him, whose I am, and
whom I serve: and the service I owe unto his Church, if at least this my Mite
may be serviceable to the least of the least therein: that he as he is in him
self the beginning and ending, Apoc.1.8.
so he would be, in some measure, of this work the Author and finisher, that
in beholding this Map of so infinitely diuersified superstitions, we may be
more thankful for, and more zealous of, that true and only Religion, which
Christ by his blood has procured, by his word revealed, by his spirit sealed,
and will reward eternally in the heavens. And hereto let all Christian readers
say with me Amen, to him which is Apoc. 3.14.
Amen, that witness faithful and true, that forsaking all the by-ways which
this Labyrinth exhibiteth, we may receive his witness as faithful and true
Disciples, that follow the Lamb whither soever he goes, and will not hear
the voice of strangers.

In the next place, I hold it not unfit briefly to express somewhat of Him,
which indeed and thoroughly can never be expressed. For the wisest of the
Prophets has said of him and to him, that the 1. King. 8.27.
heavens and heavens of heavens, are not able to contain him: and the 2
Cor.12.11.
chief, or at least he which was not inferior to the chief of the Apostles,
as ravished with such a height, and swallowed in such a depth, cried To.11.33.
O Altitudo, O the deepnesse of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? As
for my self, I may most fitly borrow the words of AGVR, Prou.30.2.
Surely I am more foolish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man
in me: Ver.3.
For I have not learned wisdom nor attained to the knowledge of boly things.
Ver.4.
Yea indeed, who has ascended up to Heaven, and descended? Who has gathered
the Wind in his fist? Who has bound the Waters in a garment? Who has
established all the ends of the World? What is his name, and what is his Sons
name if thou can tell? Tell this mystery we cannot. And yet so far as he
has told us by his word and works, we may. Of the one the next words

Every word of God is pure: Of the other elsewhere: Ps.19.1.
The heavens declare the glory of God: To.1.20.
and The invisible things of him, that is his eternal power and godhead, are

God has not (therefore) left himself without witness, who besides the
testimony of Nature, written in our hearts, has added those of the Scripture
and of the Creature, that this threefold Cord might not easily be broken, and
by the mouth of two or three witnesses, we might learn plainly that he is,
and in some measure what he is. That there is a God: Heaven and Earth, Angels
and Devils, Man and Beast, Reason and Sense, Greek and Barbarian, science in
the most, in the rest conscience, as a thousand witnesses, all that we see,
and which we see not, say and proclaim, that all may see, and in manner
palpably feel his present deity; in Act.17.18.

This is a common notion, and impression, sealed up in the mind of every man:
a remnant of integrity after the fall of ADAM, a substance or blessing in the
dead Elm, sparkles of fire raked up under the ashes, which cannot die whiles
the soul lives. What a one he is, is not so deeply engraven in Nature, Not.

whose owlish eyes are dazzled with the brightness of this light. But when
here we might renew the question, What is his name, and what is his sons
name? he himself answers in scripture by attributing to himself such names,
whereby we may know him as the Creator from all creatures, as the true God
from all false Gods: and so far as is meet and necessary to our salvation.
He then that dwells in light inaccessible, whom no man has seen, nor can
see 1.Io.3.2.

view of his hinder parts.

These names and divine attributes I mean not with large explications here to
express, as not so fitting my ability, or purpose, and being by Dionys. de

others learnedly done already: Yet to say a little, where the tongues of men
and Angels cannot say enough: the scripture attributes, or he in Scripture
attributes to himself, names, in regard both of author and object divine;
sometimes (as they term it) in the As true, wise, living etc.
concrete; sometimes in the As truth, wisdom, life, etc.
abstract; the first signifying his perfect subsistence; the other his
supersubsisting perfection; those more fitted to our capacity; these to his
divinity: who eternally and effentially is, whatsoever he is said to be, or in
himself to have. And therefore all perfections are in him but one, and this
one himself, every way infinite and incomprehensible, nothing being in him
either by participation, or as a quality, or as a natural faculty, or as a
mutable passion, or in such sort simply, as we (whose understandings are
limited in their finite bounds, and for that cause receiving in a finite
measure, conceiving in a finite manner) do or can compre^hend. Who can take up
the Ocean in a spoone? and yet these are both finite, and hold nearer
proportion than the great Creator, and the greatest of creatures. Yet is this
glimpse of this bright shining Sun comfortable through this chinke and
keyhole of our bodily prison, and even the Taste of these Delicacies, more
than sweet and delectable. Some of these names are attributed to him in regard
of his being, in it self considered, as Jehovah, Iah, Ehieh; and some in
regard of the persons which al have that one being, and every of which have all
that being, which Hock. Etclisiast. Polit. li. 5.
in it self is indiuidually one: and their several manners of having it, is
that which is called their personal propriety and incommunicable. Such a name
is, Elohim, applied to the Father, Son, and Holie-Ghost, in signification
mighty, in form plural. Some of these names are such as are communicated to
Creatures also, but with this difference, that those which in the Creature are
borrowed, imperfect, accidental, are in him Nature, Perfection, Substance.
Some are absolutely considered as he is God blessed for ever; some relatiuely
with respect unto his Creatures. De Dco etiam vera loqui periculusum. Arnob.in
Psalm. 91. Aug de Trin. li.1.c.3.
Some again are Negatiuely spoken, others affirmatively: some properly, others
by a figure. But this is indeed a thornie way, of which we may say with
AUGUSTINE, Nothing is missed more dangerously, nothing sought more laboriously,
nothing found more profitably. Even the Angelical Seraphins had their Es.6.2.
six wings, whereof two served to execute their prompt obedience; two covered
their feet, because of man's weakness not able to comprehend their glory; and
yet they themselves thus glorious, with two other wings covered their face, as
not able to endure the brightness of a greater glory. Let us then be wise,
but to Rom.12.3.
sobriety. Let us go to the Lamb to unclasp this sealed book. Col.2.3.
For in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid. Let us so know
as we may be known, and so Phi.3.10.
comprehend as we may rather be comprehended. Let us fear, love, believe, and
serve him: and then God will Ps 25.9.
teach the humble his way, and 10.7.17.
They which will do him will shall know of the doctrine. This is our way to
eternal life, thus to know him, and whom he has sent Jesus Christ: if namely
we so learn Ephesians 4.21.
Christ as the Truth is in Jesus, if we 1.Co.3.18.
become fools that we may be wise, and putting off the old man be renewed in
the spirit of our minds, and put on the new man which after God is shapen in
righteousness and irue holiness. Otherwise, we 1.Co.8.2.
know nothing as we ought to know, otherwise, we know nothing more, nor so much
as the Devils know. Pro.1.7.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of this wisdom. And for this cause
has he called himself, and proclaimed those his names, Ex.34.6.
Iehoua, Iehoua, strong, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in
goodness and truth, etc. and the like in other places; not that we may know to
know, (a foolish curiosity) but that having such light, we may believe and
walk in the light, that we may be children of the light. Iehoua the most
essential (and after the Jewish superstition ineffable) name of God, is not
therefore only revealed to us that we may know him in himself and of himself
to be, Heb.13.8.
Yesterday, to day and the same for ever, Apoc.1.8.

whom, and for whom are all things: and as the redeemler; which is known by his

interprets it, by giving a real being, and accomplishment to his promises.
In which one name (as in others of like signification) is expressed the
simplicity, Immutability, Infiniteness, blessedness, eternity, life,
perfection and other attributes of God. When he calls himself strong,
therein is declared his almighty power, whether we understand it actually in
producing and preserving all things in heaven and earth; or absolutely, whereby
he is able to do even those things which in his wisdom he does not: whereby
he is able to do all things which either Quae contradictionem implicant sub

d.
in themselves (as implying contradiction) or with him (as imperfections) are
not impossible, both those kinds not excluding, but concluding the power of
God, which because he is almighty, 2.Tim.2.12.
cannot lie or deny himself.

What should I speak of his wisdom, whereby all things are open in his
sight, both himself, and his creatures, past, present or to come, and that not
as past or future, but with one, eternal, perfect, certain, immediate act of
knowledge, which in regard of second causes are necessary or contingent, or in
effect but merely possible, and never actually subsisting. Truth is in him as
a root, from whence it is first in the being; next in the understanding;
thirdly in the writing or saying of the creature. True he is in himself, in
his works ordinary, and extraordinary, and in his word revealed by the
Prophets and Apostles. What should I add of his goodness, grace, love, mercy,
Justice, and other his attributes and names not yet mentioned? as Adonai, which
signifies the Dominion of God due to him, by Creation, by purchase, by mutual
covenant. Saddai, which signifies his all-sufficience; Ehie, his eternal
stabilitie; and others. Yea in one Chapter P Gal. l. 2. c.13.14.Cod.
PETRVS GALATINVS rehearses threescore and twelve names of God out of the
Rabbines works, multiplied and diuersified in ten sorts, which make in all
seven hundred and twenty names. To dilate of these at large would ask so many
large Commentaries, and yet even then should we still find this God
incomprehensible; of whom we may, in respect of our capacity, rather say what
he is not, Deus vbique est, vel magis proprie est ipsam vbique. Trelcat.
than what he is, whose goodness is not to be distinguished by quality, or
his greatness discerned by quantity, or his eternity measured by time, or
his presence bounded by place: of whom all things are to be conceived, beyond
whatsoever we can conceive.

The Persons, Deus vnus in Trinitate, trinus in vnitate. Arnob. in Psalm. 145.
which communicate in this Divine Nature, are three: This is their own
witness of themselves; There are three which bear record in Heaven, the
Father, the Word, and the Spit it, and these three are one. This mystery was
manifested in the Mat.3. Zanch. de 3. Elohim haec fuse.
baptism of Christ, and in our baptism in the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. The Angels unto this glorious Trinity Esaias.6.
sing their Holy, Holy, Holy: the Scripture it self applying that which there
may be interpreted of the Father, both to the Son Io. 12.41. and to the
Spirit, Act. 28.25. These with other places do also signify their personal
distinction. The creation was not only the Fathers work, but also of the other
persons, as appears by that nowne plural joined to a verb singular in the
first words of MOSES, and other like plural appellations Es. 44.24 and
Es.54.5.2. Sam.7.23. and many such places. (...)
The Apostles apply the covenant, worship, and works of God mentioned in the
Old Testament, to the Son and holy Ghost in the New, neither can the one be
the Son, or the other the spirit of God, naturally and in proper manner of
speech, but they must also subsist in the same Nature with the Father, which
being infinite, spiritual, immutable, can be but one, which must wholly, or
not at all, be communicated. In a word, the equality, the names, the
proprieties, the works, the worship peculiar to God, are applied to the Son
and Holy Ghost, equally with the Father. Which they, that list, may learn in
such as especially treat of this subject: where this mystery of the Trinity
is auerred against all heretics, Jews, and Infidells: Yea by some
Morn.de.ver. C.R. P Gal. I.I2. alijque plurimi.
also, out of their own authentike Authors, whether they receive Scriptures,
Rabbines, Philosophers or any other. I intend only to anoint the doore-posts
of this house with this discourse, that I may make a fitter entry thereinto,
leaving the fuller handling of this mystery to such as purposely frame their
whole edifice with large common places hereof; which yet always must be more
certainly received by faith, than conceived by reason: according to that of
IVSTIN MARTYR, Vnitas in Trinitate intelligitur, and Trinitas in Vnitate
noscitur: id vere quomodo fiat, nec alios scrutari velim, nec ipse mihi possum
satisfacere. li. Confess. fidei. Think of one: a threefold light will dazzle
thee; distinguish into three, and an infinite unity will swallow thee. Vnus,
and si dici debet, vnissimus, says BERNARD Ber. ad Eageni. D. Abbot. pars 3.
Defenc. page.9.
. Having thus with trembling hand written of that dreadful mystery of the
Trinity, of which we may say, cum dicitur, non dicitur; It is not told with
telling, nor can be described by description; The next to be considered are the
works of God, which are either inward and immanent, or outward and transient.
The inward are eternal and unchangeable, indeed no other but himself,
although accounted and called works in regard of their effects in the World
and of our conceiving. For all the proprieties of God are infinite, as they are
immanent in himself, yet in their transitiue and foreign effects are stinted
and limited to the model and state of the creature wherein the same effects
are wrought. Such an immanent work we conceive and name that decree of God
touching the creation of the World, Trelcat. Zanch. de Na D. l.5.c.1, 2.
with his provident disposing all and every part thereof, according to the
counsel of his own will, and especially touching the reasonable creatures,
Angels and Men, in respect of their eternal state in Salvation or Damnation.
The outward works of God are, in regard of Nature, Creation and providence: in
regard of Grace, Redemption and Salvation, in the fullness of time performed by
our Emanuel, God manifested in the flesh, true God and perfect man, in the
unity of one person, without (...)
confusion, conversion, or separation. 1.Io.5.20.
This is very God and life eternal, Jesus Christ the Son of God our Lord,
which was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin MARY, suffered under
PONTIVS PILATE, who was crucified, dead and buried; descended into Hell; rose
again the third day; he ascended into Heaven; where he sits at the right
hand of God the Father almighty, from whence he shall come to judge the quick
and dead. And to such as are sons, Gal.4.6.
God does also send the Spirit of his Son, to renew and sanctify them as
children of the Father, members of the Son, temples of the Spirit, that they,
even all the elect, may be one holy Catholic Church, enjoying the unspeakable
privileges and heavenly prerogatives of the Communion of Saints, the
forgiveness of Sins, the Resurrection of the Body, and Ever lasting life.
Even so, come Lord Jesus.

CHAP. II.
Of the Creation of the World.

THey which would without danger behold the Eclipse of the Sun, use not to
fix their eyes directly upon that bright eye of the World, (although by this
case darkened) but in water behold the same with more ease and less peril. How
much fitter is it likewise for our tender eyes in beholding the light of that
Light, Iam.I.17.
the Father of lights 1.Io.1.5. Qui scrutatur Maiestatem opprimetur a gloria.
in whom is no darkness, to divert our eyes from that brightness of glory,
and behold him (as we can) in his works? The first of which in execution was
the creation of the World, plainly described by MOSES in the book of Genesis,
both for the Author, matter, manner, and other circumstances; Reason it self
thus far subscribing, as appears in her scholars, (the most of the
Heathens and Philosophers in all ages) That this World was made by a greater
than the World. In proving this, or illustrating the other, a large field of
discourse might be ministered: neither do I know any thing wherein a man may
more improve the revenues of his learning, or make greater show with a little,
Ne si forte suas repetitum venerit olim, Grex auium plumas, etc.
decking and pruning himself, like AeSOPS Iay, or HORACE his chough, with
borrowed feathers, than in this matter of the Creation, written of (after their
manner) by so many, Jews, Ethnikes, Heretics, and Orthodoxe Christians. For my
part it shall be sufficient to write a little, setting down so much of the
substance of this subject, as may make more plain way, and easier
introduction, into our ensuing History: leaving such as are more studious of
this knowledge to those which have purposely handled this argument, with
commentaries upon MOSES text: of which, besides many modern writers (some of
which have almost oppressed the Press with their huge volumes) there are
diverse of the Primitive, middle, and decayed times of the Church.

Gen.1.3.
In the beginning (says MOSES) God created the Heaven and the Earth. Wherein
(to omit the endless and diverse interpretations of others, obtruding
allegorical, anagogical, mystical senses on the letter) is expressed the
Author of this work to be God, Elohim; which word, as is said, is of the
plural number, insinuating the Holy Trinity, the Father as the fountain of
all goodness, the Son as the wisdom of the Father, the Holy Ghost as the
power of the Father and the Son concurring in this work. The action is
creating, or making of nothing, to which is required a power supernatural and
infinite. The time was the (...) Basil. hum.1. in principio temporis, id est
simul cum tempore. Th. Aqu.1.q.46. art.3.
beginning of time, when as before there had neither been time, nor any other
creature. The work is called Heaven and Earth; which Merula and Percrius
interpret tiouem banc Chrysoftomo tribuunt.
some interpret all this bodily world, here propounded in the sum, and after
distinguished in parcels, according to the six days several works. Some
understand thereby the Calui^.in Genesis
First matter; which other Theodoret. Beda. Alcuinus, Iyra, and plerique
scholastici.
apply only to the word Earth expounding Heaven to be that which is called
Empyreum, including also the spiritual and super-celestiall inhabitants.
Again, other, whom I willingly follow, Zanch.de oper. Det, pars 1. l.1.c.2.
Polarus, Bucanus, etc. Paul. Merula. Cos^^ogr. part.1.l.r. Pe^er. in Genesis

them.
extend the word Heaven to a larger signification, therein comprehending those
three Heavens, which the Scriptures mention: (one whereof is this lower, where
the birds of the Heaven do fly, reaching from the Earth to the Sphere of the
Moon: the second, those visible Orbs of the Planets and fixed Stars, with
the first Moveable: the third called the Heaven of Heavens, the third Heaven
and Paradise of God) together with all the host of them. By Earth they
understand this Globe, consisting of Sea and Land, with all the creatures
therein. The first verse they hold to be a general proposition of the Creation
of all Creatures, col.1.16.
visible and invisible, perfected in Gen.2.I. Exodus.20.11.Job. 38.7.
six days, as many places of Scripture testify: which, as concerning the
visible, Moses handles after particularly, largely, and plainly, contenting
himself with brief mention of those invisible creatures, both Genesis 32.1.
good and Gen.3.1.
bad, as occasion is offered in the following parts of his History. In the
present, Pet. Martyr. in Genesis
he omitteth the particular description of their Creation, least some (as Jews
and Heretics have done) should take occasion to attribute the Creation to
Angels, as assistants: or should, by the excellency of that Nature, depainted
in due colors, be carried to worshipping of Angels: a superstition which men
have embraced, toward the visible creatures, far inferior both to Angels and
themselves. Moses proceeds therefore to the description of that first matter,
and the creatures thereof framed and formed. For touching those invisible
creatures, both the Angels and their heavenly habitation, howsoever they are
circumscribed, and have their proper and most perfect substance, yet according
to the interpretation of Divines, Zanch. de operib pars 1. l.1.c.4.
their nature differs from that of other creatures, celestial or
terrestrial, as not being made of that first matter, whereof these consist.
Let us therefore labor rather to be like the Angels in grace, that we may be
like unto the^ in glory, than pry too curiously into their Nature (to our
understandings in manner supernatural) and endeavor more, in heeding the way
which leads to that Heaven of the Blessed, than busy our wits too busily in
descrying or describing it. Only thus much we may observe thereof, that it is
beyond all reach of our observation: in regard of substance not subject to
corruption, alteration, passion, motion: in quantity, Ioh.14.2.
many dwelling places, most spacious and ample: in quality, a Paradise, fair,
shining, delightsome, wherein no evil can be present or imminent; no good
thing absent: a mere transcendent, which eye has not seen, nor care heard,
nor the heart of man can conceive. Where the Apoc.21.3.
Tabernacle of God shall be with men, and he will dwell with them, and shall be
1.Cor.15.28.
all in all unto them; where the pure in heart shall see him, and even our
bodily eyes shall behold that most glorious of creatures, the Sun of
righteousness, and Son of God, Christ Jesus. Embracing these things with
Hope, let us return to Moses his description of the sensible World; who
shows, that that Heaven and Earth, which now we see, were in the beginning or
first degree of their being, an Earth without form, and void, a darkened depth
and waters: a matter of no matter, and a form without form; a rude and
indigested Chaos, or confusion of matters, rather to be Heb.11.3.
believed than comprehended of us. This is the second natural beginning. For,
after the expressing of the matter, follows that which Philosophers call a
second natural Principle, Arist. Phys.l.1. Iun. praef. in Genesis
Privation, the want of that form, of which this matter was capable, which is
accidentally a natural principle, required in regard of generation, not of
constitution, here described by that part next us, Earth, which was without
form, as is said, and void. This was the internal constitution: the external
was, darkness upon the face of the Deep. Which Deep compriseth both the
earth before mentioned, and the visible Heavens also, called a Depth, as to our
capacity infinite, and plyant to the Almighty hand of the Creator: called
also Waters, Gibbins on Genes.
not because it was perfect waters, which was yet confused, but because of a
certain resemblance, not only in the uniformity thereof, but also of that
want of stabilitie, whereby it could not abide together, but as the Spirit of
God moved upon these Waters, to sustain them; and Hier.l.trad. Hebr. Trem. and
Iun. Basil.bom.2.cx Ephrem. Syro.
as the Hen sits on her eggs to cherish and quicken, as Hierome
interprets the word, so to maintain, and by his mighty power to bring the
same into this natural order. Here therefore is the third beginning or
Principle in Nature, That form, which the Spirit of God, the third person in
Trinity (not air or wind, as Merc. de Fab. Mundi, and ante cum, Tertull.ad
Hermog. Theodoret.qu.8. in Genesis Caictan. de Angelis interpretatur.
some conceive, being things which yet were not themselves formed) by that
action framed it unto, and after more particularly effected.

This interpretation of the Spirit moving upon the Waters, agrees with that
opinion which some attribute to the Stoikes, That all things are procreated and
governed by one Spirit: and Virgil most elegantly and divinely sings, and
seems to paraphrase on Moses words: Virg. Aeneid. l.6. on which words Seruius
commenteth, Deus est quidam diuinus spiritus, qui per 4. infusus clementa,
gignit vniuersa:
Principio Caelum, ac Terras, camposque liquentes
Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra,
Spiritus intus alit: totamque infusa per artus
Men's agitat molem and magno se corpore miscet:
That is, Heaven first, and Earth, and Watrie plains,
Bright Moon, of Stars those twinkling trains,
The Spirit inly cherishes,
Loves, moves, great body nourishes;
Through all infused this All contains.


The first creatures which received their natural form, were the Elements:
the first, lightest, and highest whereof is Fire, whose effect is the light,
whereof it is said, that God said, Let there be Light. For howsoever some
understand this of the Vatab.in Ge.
Sun, which they will have then to be created, Basil.bom.6.
some of a quality diffused through that confused matter, Zanch.de op.D.
part.2.l.1. and B. Pererius recensel multos sautores buius sent.
some of a Cloud formed of the waters, which as a chariot of light with his
circular motion caused day and night: to omit the more frivolous
interpretations of such as apply it allegorically or mystically to men or
Angels, in respect of the regeneration of the one, or first generation of the
other; I rather follow the opinion of Iunius, Iun.in Genesis c.1. sic Damascenus
de Fide, l.2.c.7. Greg. Nyssen. bomtl. super Hexemeron.
who applies this to the fiery element, whose act and quality is to
enlighten; although perfectly to affirm what this Light was must be by our
enlightening from him, who commanded this Light to shine out of the darkness.
This Light God made by his Word, not uttered in sound of syllables, nor that,
which in the Ioh.1.1. Verbum Dei significat imperium, decretum and voluntatem
eius efficacem. Pererius in Genesis
beginning was with God, and was God (and therefore could not be this Word,
which now had a beginning) but by his powerful effecting, calling things that
are not as though they were, and by his calling or willing causing them to be;
thereby signifying his will as plainly, and effecting it as easily, as a word
is unto a man. This Word was common to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, each
and all, by doing, uttering this will or decree, the manner of doing
nevertheless being diverse, according to the distinction of persons. Here yet
is a testimony of the Trinity: for as by sustaining that matter the power of
God appeared, and therefore it is attributed to the Spirit; so by the order and
disposition of the creatures his wisdom is manifest, which is the essential
Word of the Father, 10.1.3.
without which was made nothing that was made, which after became flesh, and
dwelt among us. Gibbins on Genesis
The Trinity decreed, the second Person effected, Let there be Light, and
there was Light: for by the word of the Lord were the Heavens made. That
uncreated Light commanded this elementarie Light to be, that so the thinner
and higher Element, severed from the Air, might by his enlightening operation,
effect; and the Air, according to the nature thereof, receive this lightsome
shining: which to the Fire was an essential property, to the Air an
accidental quality, approved of God, as good both in it self, and to the
future creatures. This Light did God separate from the darkness (which indeed
is nothing in nature, but the absence of Light) so disposing thereof, that
Light and Darkness should in their Hemisphere succeed each other. Whether it
were so moved by the motion of the ninth Sphere, or first moveable, the highest
of the moveable Heavens, and outmost circumference, created in the beginning,
as Iun.in Genesis praelec.
some interpret the first words of Moses, or by any other means, then
appointed by God, it is hard to determine. For we may not reason a facto ad
fieri, from the order of their constitution, in which they now are, to the
principles of their institution, whiles yet they were in making, as
Simpl.arg.22. confutat. a Iunio.
Simplicius, and other (Philosophers may I call them, or Atheists?) have
absurdly done, in this and other parts of the Creation. This was the first
days work.

In the second, God said let there be a Firmament in the midst of the waters,
etc. The word Rakiah, translated Firmament, signifies Trem. and Iun.
expansum, or a thing stretched out; or as some Gibbins on Genesis
say, a thing made strong by stretching out, designing that vast and wide space
and ayrie Region, by the extension thereof, made thinner, purer, and stronger,
able to bear those waterie Clouds, which it separateth from these inferior
waters, in their proper and elementarie Seat. In which sense He is said to
stretch out the Heavens like a Curtain, and to lay the beams of his chambers
in the waters. Psalm.104.2.

After the Aethereall Ether has two parts, higher and lower; and so the Air.
Region (reaching in the hither part thereof from the middle Region of the Air
to the Moon, and from thence in the higher part to the highest Heaven) and the
Air (distinguished also into two parts, the middle, and the lower part, as the
Philosophers term them, when they consider not the whole, as here we do, but
that part, wherein the Meteors are caused) after these two Elements, thus in
the two first days ordered and disposed: in the third day follows the
perfecting of the two lowest Elements, the Water and Earth, which yet were
confused, until that mighty Word of God did thus both divorce and marry
them, compounding of them both this one Globe, now called Dry Land, and Seas.
The waters which yet oppressed, and by their effusion and confusion did
tyrannize, rather than orderly subdue, and govern this inferior myrie mass,
were partly received into competent channels, and there also gathered on
swelling heaps, where, though they menace a return of the old Chaos, both by
their noise and waves, yet has Job.38.10.11.
God stablished his commandment upon it, and set bars and doors, and said,
Hitherto shall thou come and no further, and here shall it stay thy proud
waves. Otherwise, Psalm.104. 6,7.
the Deepes, which then covered it as a garment, would now stand above the
Mountains. At his rebuke they fly, who with fetters of sand (to show his
power in weakness, with a miracle in nature) chayneth up this enraged Tyrant,
that the creatures might have a meet place of habitation. Thus did not only
the dry Land appear, but by the same hand was enriched with Herbs and
Trees, enabled in their mortal condition, to remain immortal in their kind.
And here begins Moses to declare the creation of compound bodies; hitherto
busied in the Elements.

Now when the Lord had made both Plants, Trees, and Light, without the
influence, yea before the being of Sun, Moon, or Star, he now framed those
fiery Balls, and glorious Lights, whereby the Heavens are beautified, the Air
enlightened, the Seas ruled, and the Earth made fruitful. Thus he did the
fourth day, after those other things created, least some foolish Naturalist
should bind his mighty hand in Natures bands, seeing these Lights now become
the chief officers in Natures Court. That shining, before dispersed, was
united in these bodies, whether by refraction of those former beams by these
solid Globes, or by gathering that fiery substance into them, or by both, or

Star-gazers imagine; which yet if they had, could never be known of us in
such a multiplicitie of causes, and suddenness of change, in that unspeakable
swiftness of the Heavens, as appeared by Aug. de ciuit. Dei. lib.5. cap.3.
Nigidius Figulus his wheel, which he turned with the swiftest violence, and
making a blot or mark therein, as it turned made another spot in or near the

the standing still of the wheel, appeared much distant. Of these lights the

abused to the greatest darkness: the greatest of which seems to our eyes
little, and yet by rules of Art is found far greater then the earth; that we
may learn not to trust our sense too much in heavenly things.

In the fifth day God created the Fishes and Fowls, blessing them with power
of propagation.

The like he performed the sixth day, in forming the Beasts both wild and
tame, and creeping things: thus furnishing the air, water, and earth, with
their proper Inhabitants.

After he had thus provided his cheer, he sought him out a guest, and having
built and furnished his house, his next care was for a fit inhabitant. Of this,
Moses adds, Furthermore God said, Let us make man. But this will ask a
longer discourse. In the mean time we have this testimony of Moses of the
Creation of the World, whose sense if I have missed or misted in these many
words, I crave pardon. And although this testimony might suffice a Christian,
Faith is the evidence of things not seen. Vbi vides non est fides.
which must live by faith, and not by sight: yet to prevent cauillers, we have
other witnesses both of reason and authority, That this World had a beginning,
and that the builder and maker thereof, was God. For, does not Nature both
within and without us, in the admirable frame of this less or that greater
World, in the Notions of the one, and the Motions of the other, in the wise and
mighty order and ordering of both, lead men unto a higher and more excellent
Nature, Natura naturans.
which, of his goodness, we call GOD? When we behold the whole World, or any
part of it, in the elements such agreement, in such disagreement: in the
heavenly motions such constancy, in such variety: in these compound bodies,
being, living, sense, reason; as diverse degrees, diversely communicated to so
many forms and ranks of Creatures: We can no more ascribe these things to
chance, than a Printers barrel of letters could by chance fall into the right
composition of the Bible which he printeth, or of Homers Iliads; to use Cic. de
Not. Deor.
Tullies similitude: neither can any ascribe the Creation to the Creature, with
better reason, then if by some shipwreck, being cast on a desolate Island, and
finding houses, but seeing no people therein, he could esteem the Birds or
Beasts (all the Ilanders he sees) to be the framers of these buildings. But
thou may think it eternal; Thou may as well think it to be God,
Infinite, Unchangeable, in the whole and in all the parts. Does not the Land by
seasons, the Sea by ebbing and flowing, the Air by succeeding changes, the
Heavens by motions, all measured by Time, proclaim that they had a beginning
of Time? Are not Motion and Time as near Twins, as Time and Eternity are
implacable enemies? Nay, how can thou force thy mind to conceive an Eternity
in these things, which can not conceive Eternity? which can not but
conceive some beginning, and first term or point, from whence the motion of
this wheel began? And yet how should we know this first turning of the Worlds
wheel, whose hearts within us move, be we unwitting or unwilling, the
beginning whereof thou can not know, and yet can not but know that it had a
beginning, and together with thy body shall have an ending? How little a while
is it, that the best So Lucret. l.5. cur supra bellum Thebanum and funera

CHAP. III.
Of Man, considered in his first state wherein he was created: and of Paradise,
the place of his habitation.

HItherto we have spoken of the framing of this mighty Fabrike, the Creation
of the visible World, leaving that invisible to the spiritual Inhabitants,
which there always behold the face of the heavenly Father, as not daring to pry
too far into such mysteries, Col 2.18.
Rashly puffed up with a fleshly mind: This whereof we treat they need not, as
finding all sufficience in their All-sufficient Creator: The inferior Creatures
(which hitherto have been described) know it not, but content Bernard. sup.
Cunt. Sermon.5.
themselves with themselves, in enjoying their natural being, moving, sense,
Only Man, in regard of his body, needs it, and by the reasonable power of
his soul can discern and use it. Man therefore was last created, as the end
of the rest, an Epitome and Map of the World, a compendious little other
world, consisting of a visible and invisible Nature, so resembling both the
work and the Worke-man: the lastin execution, but first in intention, to whom
all these Creatures should serve, as means and prouocations of his service to
his and their Creator.

Man may be considered, in regard of this life, or of that which is to come: of
this life, in respect of Nature of Grace: and this Nature also sustaineth a
twofold consideration, of integrity and corruption: For Eccles.7.vlt.
God made man righteous, but they sought to themselves many inventions. His
first purity in his Creation, his fall from thence by sin, his endeavor to
recover his former innocence by future glory, either in the by-waies of
superstition, which Nature (a blind guide) leads him into, through so many
false religions; or by the true, new and living way, which God alone can set
him, and does conduct him in, is the subject of our tedious task; the first
two more briefly propounded: the two last historically and largely related.

In that first state, his Author and Maker was Jehovah Elohim, God in the
plurality of Persons and unity of Essence; the Father, by the Son, in the
power of the Spirit: whereunto, he did not only use his powerful word as
before, saying, let there be Man, but a consultation, let us make Man: not that
he needed counsel, but Quia rationalis creatura, quasi cum consi^lio facta
videretur. Iunilius in Genes.
that he in this Creature did show his counsel and wisdom most apparently.
The Father, as first in order, speaks unto the Son and holy Ghost, and the
Son and holy Ghost in an unspeakable manner speak and decree with the
Father; and Socrat. lib. 2. cap.25.
the whole Trinity consult and agree together, to make Man: which Cyril. Al.
cont. Iul. lib. 1.
for Man's instruction, is by Moses uttered after the manner of Men. The manner
of his working was also in this Creature, singular; both in regard of his
body, which, as a Potter his clay, he wrought and framed of the dust into this
goodly shape; and of his soul, which he immediately breathed into his
nosthrils.

Thus has Man cause to glory in his Creators care, in himself to be humbled,
having a body framed not of solid earth, but of the dust (the basest and
lightest part of the basest and grossest element, Psalm 62.9.
So vain a thing is man) his soul of nothing, lighter then vanity, in the
infusion created, and in the Creation infused, to be the dweller Job 4.19.
in this house of clay, and habitation of dust. Yea not a house, but a
2.Cor.5.1.
tabernacle continually in dissolution. Such is the Maker and Matter of Man.
The form was his conformity to God, after whose Image he was made. Christ
only is in full resemblance, the Col.1.15.
Image of the invisible God, Hebr.1.3.
the brightness of his glory, and the ingraued form of his Person. Man was not
this Image, but made ad imaginem, according to this Image, resembling his
Author, but with imperfection, in that perfection of humane Nature.

This Image of God appeared in the soul properly, secondly in the body (not
as the Epiph her. 71.
Anthropomorphite Heretics, and Papists picture the Trinity, the creation,
etc.
Popish Image-makers imagine, but) as the instrument of the soul, and lastly
in the whole Person. The soul in regard of the spiritual and immortal
substance, resembles him which is a Spirit, and everlasting: to which some
add the resemblance of the holy Trinity, in this, that one soul has those
three essential faculties of Understanding, Will, and Memory, or (as others)
of Vegetation, Sense, and Reason. In regard of gifts and natural endowments,
the soul in the understanding part received a Divine impression, and
character, in that knowledge, whereby she measures the heavens, brings them
to the earth, lifts up the earth to heaven, mounteth above the heavens to
behold the Angels, pierces the center of the earth in darkness to discern
the infernal regions and legions, beneath and above them all searches into
the divine Nature: whereby, Genes. 2.
Adam was without study the greatest Philosopher, (who at first sight knew the
nature of the beasts, the original of the Woman) and the greatest Divine,
(except the second Adam) that ever the earth bare. The will also, in free
choice of the best things, in Ephesians. 4.24.
righteous disposition toward man, and true holiness toward God, was conformed
to his will, for whose wills sake it is, and was created. The body cannot so
lively express the virtue of him that made it, but as it could, in that
perfect constitution, ( Psalm. 139.14.
so fearfully and wonderfully made Pronaq^, cum spectent animalia caeter a
terram, Os homini sublime dedit, etc. Ovid.
) and as the organ of the soul, whose weapon it was to righteousness, had some
shadow thereof. The whole Man in his natural Nobility beyond, and Princely
dominion over the other Creatures (that we mention not the hope of future
blessedness) shows after what Image Man was created, and to what he should
be renewed. The end whereunto God made Man, is God himself, who has made all
things for himself: the subordinate end was Man's endless happiness, the way
whereunto is religious obedience.

Moses adds, Genesis 1.27.
He created them male and female, thereby to show, that the Woman in
OEconomicall respect is 1.Cor.11.7.
the image and glory of the Man, being created for the Man, and of the Man,
but in relation to God, or the World, She as a Creature, was also framed after
the same Image. As for that monstrous conceit of the Rabbis, that the first
Man was an Hermaphrodite, it deserves not confutation or mention. The order of
the Woman's creation is plainly related. God Genesis 2.21.
finding not a meet help for Adam, in his sleep took one of his ribs, whereof
he built the Woman. This in a mystery signified that deadly sleep of the
heavenly Adam on the Cross, whose stripes were our healing, whose death was
our life, and out of whose bleeding side was by Divine dispensation framed his
Spouse the Church. This may be part of the sense, or an application thereof, as
M^^tak de S^riot. quest. 5.
some say, to this mystery; or the signification rather of the ^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^
op^ic^lat ^^ qui^^^d^^ ^^ ^^^^^ Si^^^^^^ diffe^^^^^^, q^^d in cop^^um per ^^^ba
quae recitantur, de rebus qibusdam agitur: quae rursum res, viceverbo rum, ad
signification aciarum rerum propan^^^tur. Hugo de S. Vict. to. 1.
thing it self here declared, then of the words, which properly and plainly
set down the History of a thing done, after the literal sense to be
expounded.

According to this sense, Moses expresses the Creation, the making and
marrying of the Woman. The Maker was God, the matter a ribbe of Adam, the form
a building, the end to be a meet help. The Man was made of dust, the Woman of
the Man, to be one flesh with the Man, and of a ribbe, to be a help and
supporter of him in his calling, which requires strength: neither could any
bone be more easily spared, in the whole body, which has not such variety of
any other kind: nor could any place more design the Woman her due place, not
of the head, that she should not arrogate rule; not of the feet, that the
husband should not reckon her as his slave; but in a mean between both, and
that near the heart, in which they should (as in all Divine and Humane Laws
else) be fastioyned. The building of this body of the Woman was, in regard of
the Progeny, which was in that larger room to have the first dwelling. The
soul of the Woman is to be conceived, Ne animu^ ^d^^ertas externo homini;
integumentum est h^^^^^: sane and anima ^^^^^lis est: in v^lamin^^us
differentia est. Basil.
as the soul of the man before mentioned, immediately infused and created by
God, herein equal to man.

Being thus made, she is married by God himself unto Adam, who brought her
unto him, to show the sacred authority of marriage, and of parents in
marriage: A mutual consent and gratulation follows between the parties,
least any should tyrannically abuse his fatherly power. And thus are two made
one flesh in regard of one original, equal right, mutual consent, and bodily
conjunction. And thus were this goodly couple glorious in nakedness, not so much
in the ornaments of beauty, which made them to each other amiable, as of
Majesty, which made them to other creatures dreadful: the Image of God
clothing that nakedness, which in us Apoc. 3.19.
appears silthie, in the most costly clothing. God further blessed them both
with the power of multiplication in their own kind, and dominion over other
kinds: and gave them for food Gen.1.29.
every herb bearing seed, which is upon all the earth, and every tree, wherein
is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. He does (as it were) set them in
possession of the Creatures, which by a charter of free gift he had conveyed to
them, to hold of him as Lord Paramount.

But least any should think this but a niggardly and unequal gift, whereas
since the sloud more has been added, and that in a more unworthiness through
man's sin: let him consider, that, since the fall, Gen 3.17. Gen.9.3.
the earth is accursed, whereby many things are hurtful to man's nature, and in
those which are wholesome, there is not such variety of kinds, such plenty in
each variety, such ease in getting our plenty, or such quality in what is
gotten, in the degree of goodness and sweetness to the taste and nourishment.
Which had they remained in this sickely and elder age of the world, we should
not need to envy Cleopatra's vanity, or Heliogabalus his superfluity and
curiosity. And had not man sinned, there should not have needed the death of
beasts to nourish his life, which without such stay should have been
immortal: the use whereof was after granted, rather to supply necessity, when
the Flood had weakened the Farth, then to minister a greater abundance then
before it hand: and least of all to satisfy the greedy and curious appetites
of more then beastly men.

Liberal and bountiful was Gods allowance, which yet as man abused in eating
the forbidden fruit, so whether any sinful men did transgress by eating the
flesh of beasts, as iniquity increased, it is uncertain. And yet it is
likely, that when the earth was Genesis 6.11.
filled with cruelty, as men escaped not beastly but chery, so beasts escaped
not but cherly inhumanity: and men, that stay not now for commission to eat
man's flesh, would then much less ask leave to feed on beasts. Then did the
godly Patriarchs live many hundred years The Fathers did not eat flesh
before the flood. Origin Gene. hom. i. Chrysostom. hom. 27.Genes.
without such food, whereas now we reach not to one with this help, that I
speak not of those which by abuse hereof are as cruel to themselves, (in
shortning their days by surfeits) as to the Creatures, making their bellies to
become warrens, fish-pooles, shambles, and what not, save what they should be?
Had not man bin devilish in sinning, he had not bin beastly in feeding, nay
the beasts had abhorred that which now they practice, both against their Lord
and their fellow-seruants. Es. 11.6.
The Woolfe should have dwelt with the Lamb, the Leopard should have lien with
the Kid, and the Calfe, and the Lion, and the fat beast together, and a little
Child might lead them. Eas.hex. ho. 11. lunil. in Ge. Pererius relates the
opinions of Bonauenture, Tollatus, Ephrem, Isidore: Also Vadianus, Goropi',
Beroaldus in Chronico, Iunius and others have largely handled this question of
paradise.
And this in the time of the Flood appeared, when all of them kept the peace
with each other, and dutiful allegiance to their Prince in that great family
and little mooueable world, Neahs Arc.

The place of Adams dwelling is expressed by Moses: And the Lord God planted a
garden Eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had made,
Gen.2.8.Marvel it is to see the confusion which sin brings, which
appears not only in the body, soul, diet and other prerogatives of our
first parents, but in this place also, then a place of pleasure, a Paradise and
garden of delights: after, a place prohibited, and kept by the blade of a sword
shaken: now the place cannot be found in earth, but is become a common place in
men's brains, to macerate and vex them in the curious search hereof. Ambrose
in his long Treatise de Paradiso leans too much this way.
Some do convert this History into an allegory, as did the Manichees, and the
Originists, confuted by Methodius, as Epiphan.libr. Ancor. and
contr.baeres.libr.2.
Epiphanius witnesses. Hierome in 'Dan.10. says, that seeking for shadows in
the truth, they ouer-turne the truth it self. Vmbras and imagines in veritate
quaerentes, ipsam conantur euertere verit atem, vt flumina and arbores and
paradisum putent allegoriae legibiss se debere subruere. Such mystical
Mist-all and Misse-all Interpreters are our Familists in these times, by
unseasonable and unreasonable allegories, raising mists over the
Scripture-sense, which thereby they miss and cannot find. De Genesisli 8. ca.
1.and de Ciu. Dei li.12 ca. 21.
Augustine relates three opinions, that allegorical, which he confuteth: the
literali, and that which follows both the one and the other, as himself
does. The Aug.de Haeres.
Hermiaens and Seleucians are said to deny, that there was any such place: And
the naked Adamites accounted their Church to be Paradise. Others are as
prodigal, and ascribe hereunto all the Earth, which was a Paradise, til sin
brought in a curse. Thus holds Wolfg. Wissenburg praefat. ad Dom.Nig.
Gor.Bec. Becces. Ioac. Vad.de Paradiso. Likewise Hugo de S. Vict. reckons
this opinion totam terram suturam Paradisum, si homo non peccasset: totam
factam exilium per peccatum. Annot.in.Genesis
Wolfgangus Wissenburg, Goropius also, and Vadianus are of like mind, That
man's exile was but the alteration of their happy condition, that the fiery
sword was the fiery Zone etc. A great while it went for current, that it was a
pleasant region, by a long tract of sea and land separated from our habitable
world, and lifted up to the circle of the Moon, whereby it was out of the
reach of Noah's flood. This has Histor Scholast.
Petrus Comestor and Stratus: and many travelers in old times have traveled
with this conceit, but brought forth a lie, as appears by their Legends.
Leg.aurea.
That saint Brandon sailed thither from Ireland, is as true as that he met
Indas in the way released from his pains, (as he was always from Saturday to
Sunday Euensong:) or that they made fire on a fish (supposing it to be an
Island) which if he could once get his tail into his mouth, would ouerturn the
world, as that Legend tells. It should seem the man in the Moon called him,
and showed him the way to this Paradise. Others place it Eastward, in the
highest top of the earth, where the four Rivers, mentioned by Moses, have
their original, whence they run, and are swallowed up of the Earth, and
after rising in diverse places of the world, are known by the names of Nilus,
Ganges, Tigris, Euphrates. Hugo Annot. in Genes.
Hugo de S. Victore and Adrichomius Adric. Chron.
are of this opinion: yea the great Cardinal Caietane Caictan.in Genes.7.
and Bellarmine, Bell.de Romans Pont.lib.3.ca.6. and de great. primi hominis.
place Henoch and Elias in earthly Paradise, yet living there until the time of
Antichrist, which wood he cannot see (being in the midst of it) for trees.
But the discovery of the World by Travelers, and description thereof by
Geographers, will not suffer us to follow them (to the want of which Art, I
mean Geographie, such fantasies may be imputed) whereby also is confuted the
opinion of them, which place it under the Equinoctial circle, as Durandus and
Bonancntura.

Phil.Melanc, and Carrion.
Others account so much to Paradise, as those four Rivers do water, even the
chief part of Afrike and Asia: and some confine it in streighter limits of
Syria, Arabia and Mesopotamia, as if Adam had been so covetous as his
Posterity, or so laborious as to husband so large Countries. The salfe
interpretation of those Rivers to be Nilus, Ganges etc. was the cause of this
error, the In Es.23.3. and Iere.2.1.8.
Septuagint translating in stead of Sichor (which is Nilus) Gihon the name of
one of these streams.

Moses as it were of purpose by an exact chorography and delineation of the
situation, does meet with those errors, and with other the like, which I do
not here relate. Neither is their opinion to be followed, which drown all
altogether in the deluge, seeing that after that time Moses wrote this.
Franciscus Iunius in his readings on Genesis See also, Annot. Trem.and Iun.in
Gen.2.
has largely and learnedly handled this matter, and added a Map also of
Heden in which it stood, and the course of the Rivers with the Countries
adjacent. In him the Reader may find satisfaction. He shows out of Curtius,
Plime, and Solinus, the miraculous fertility of that part of Babylonia, which
Ptolomy calls Auranitis or Audanitis, easily declined from Heden, the name
given by Moses, mentioned after Moses time, 2. Rag.19 12. and Es.37.12.

For the four Rivers he shows them out of Ptolomey, Strabo, Pliny, Dion,
Marcellinus etc. to be so many divisions of Euphrates, whereof Baharsares or
Neharsares is Gihon, that which passes through Babylon is, for the excellency,
peculiarly called Perath or Euphrates; Nehar-malca or Basilius, Pishon; Tigris,
Tigris is both the greater river and a smaller which runs out of Euphrates
into Tigris, which is here meant.
Chiddekel. For the fiery Sword he observes out of Pliny li.2. ca.106. a
certain miracle of Nature in Babylonia, where the ground is seen burning
continually about the quantity of an acre. But this place will not serve to
dispute this point. If those Rivers do not now remain, or have altered either
channel or names, it is no new thing in so old a continuance of the world. It
is more then probable, that here in these parts Paradise was, although now
deformed by the Flood, and by Time consumed and become a stage of barbarism.

Neither has the place alone bin such a pitched field of Opinions, but the
fruit also which Moses expresses to be the instrument and occasion of Adams
ruin, has set some men's teeth on edge, who tell us what it is, as if they had
lately tasted of it, a certain sign indeed, and fruit, of that once
unlawful tasting. Goro. Becan. Indoscythica.
Goropius a man addicted to opinions, which I know not whether he did hold
more strangely, or strongly, though he enlarges Paradise over the world, yet
he makes Adam an Indian (marvel he places him not in Dutch-land, for that
was his language, if Becanus be to be believed.) About the river Acesines
betwixt Indus and Ganges (says he) grows that admirable Fig tree, which
he at large describes out of Pliny, Theophrastus and Strabo, whose branches
spreading from the body, do bend themselves downwards to the earth, where
they take hold, and with new rooting multiply themselves, like a maze or wood.
One told Car.Clus.Exoticorum.
Clusius that he himself had been one of eight hundred or a thousand men,
which had hidden themselves under one of these trees, adding, that some of them
were able to cover three thousand men.

Strange is this tree, and Becanus is with conceit hereof ravished into the
pleasures of Paradise. This tree Linschoten lib. 1.ca.58.
Linschoten describes growing about Goa, and (to bring us out of Goropius
Paradise) says that it has no fruit worth the eating: but a small kind like
Olives, which is food only forbirds. He tells us c. 55.
of another Indian Fig tree, growing rather like a Reed then a Tree, a man's
height, a spanne thick, the leaves a fathom long, and three spannes broad:
The Arabians and Indians suppose this to be that dismal fruit. The cause of
this opinion Paludanus in his Annotations upon Linschoten ascribes to the
pleasantnes of the smell and taste. Being cut in the middle, it has certain
veins like a Cross, whereon the Christians in Syria make many speculations.
Yea the same Author tells of a hill in the I Will of Seilan, called Adams hill,
where they show his foot-print, to prove that he lived there: of which read
our discourse of that Island, lt. 5. ca.14. Boskhier in his Ara coeli cites out
of Moses Barcepha, That wheat was the Tree of knowledge of good and evil; and
so do the Saracens hold: so curious and vain is blind Reason without a guide.

But I think I have wearied the Reader, with leading him thus up and down in
Paradise; small fruit I confess is in this fruit, and as little pleasure in
this Paradise, but that variety happily may please some, though it be to others
tedious. And for a conclusion it is, I think, worth the noting, that M.
Cartwright an eyewitness, The Preachers trauells.
by the counsel of the Nestorian Patriark at Mosul or Niniuie visited the I Will
of Eden, still so called, and by them holden a part of Paradise, ten miles in
circuit, and sometime walled: which if it be not part of that garden-plot
mentioned by Moses, yet it seems, is part of that country sometime called Eden,
in the East part whereof Paradise was planted, and not far (according to Iunius
Map) from that happy unhappy place.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the word Religion, and of the Religion of our first Parents before the fall.

Having thus made way to our history of Religions, the first (and therefore
best) Religion, is in the first place to be declared. Only somewhat may be, not
unfitly, spoken before of the word. Religion in it self is natural, written
in the hearts of all men, which will (as here we show) rather be of a false then
no Religion: but the name whereby it is so called, is by birth a forreiner, by
common use made a free-denizen among us, descended from the Romans, which by
their swords made way for their words, the Authors both of the thing it self
and of the appellation, to a great part of this Western world. But as the
Latins have accustomed themselves to multiplicitie and variety of Rites, so
have they varied not a little about the Parents (as I may say) of this child,
(as the Grecians sometimes, about Homers birthplace) some giving one
etymology and derivation of the word, and some another, that there needs
some Herald to show the true petigree, or some Grammarian Dictator to cease the
strife.

Servius Sulpitius (as Macrobius cites him) calls that Religion, which for
some holiness is removed and separated from us, quasi relictam a relinquendo
dictam. Servius deserves to be relinquished, and his opinion removed and
separated even with an Anathema, if he would remove and separate Religion from
us, which is the life of our life, the way to our happiness. The like is added
of Ceremonia a carendo dicta, a just name and reason of the most of the present
Romish Ceremonies, whose want were their best company. Massurius Sabinus in
Noc. At.libr. 4 ca 9.
A. Gellius has the like words. Religio, with Tully, is Cultus deoru^, the
worship of the gods, hereby distinguished from Superstition, because they were,
says he, called Superstitious, that spent whole days in prayer and
sacrifices, that their children might be Superstites, survivors after them: (or
rather as Lact.l.4. c.28. Qui superstitens memoria^ defunctoru^ colunt, aut qui
parentibus suis superstites celebrant imagines eoru^ domi, tanqua^ deos
penates. But they which diligently used and perused the things pertaining to
divine worship, and tanquam relegerent, were called Religious, Religiosi ex
religendo tanqua^ ex eligendo eligentes, intelligendo intelligentes. Religiosum
a superstitioso ea distinctione discernit Varr^, vt a superstitio^o dicat

Religens is cited by Nigidius Figulus in Aulus Gellius; Religentem esse

superstitiosus. The same Father elsewhere, in his Book de Vera Religione In

acknowledges another original of the word, which Lactantius before him had
observed, a religando, of fastening, as being the bond between us and God.

Ad Deum tendentes, says Augustine, and ci vnireligantes animas nostras unde

his words are; Diximus nomen religionis a vinculo pietatis esse deductum, quod
hommem sibi Deus religaucrit and pietate constrinxerit, quia seruire nos ei vt
dommo and obsequi vt patri necesseest. Melius ergo (quam Cicero) idnomen
Lucretius interpretatus est, quia dit sereligionuin nodos exolvere. And
according to this ctymologie is that which Master Camden says, Religion in old
English was called Ean-fastnes, as the one and only Assurance and fast
Anker-hold of our souls health. Camden Rem.

This is the effect of sin and irreligion, that the name and practice of
Religion is thus diuersified, else had there bin, as one God, so one religion,
and one language, wherein to give it with just reason, a proper name. For till
men did relinquere. relinquish their first innocence, and the Author of whom,
and in whom they held it, they needed not religere, to make a second choice, or
seek reconciliation, nor thus religere, with such pains and vexation of spirit
to enquire and practice those things which might religare, bind them surer and
faster unto God: and in these respects for several causes Religion might seem
to be derived from all those fountains. Thus much of the word, whereby the
nature of Religion is in part declared, but more fully by the description
thereof.

Religio est, says 83. Quaest.q.31.
Augustine, quae superioris cuiusdam naturae quaem diuinam vocant, curam
ceremoniamque affert. Religion is here described generally (whether falsely or
truly) professing the inward observation and ceremonial outward worship of
that which is esteemed a higher and divine nature. The true Religion is the
true rule and right way of serving God. Or to speak as the case now stands
with us, Ma^n.de vera Christ relig, ^.20
True religion is the right way of reconciling and reuniting man to God, that
he may be saved. This true way he alone can show us, who is the Way and the
Truth, neither can we see this same, except he first see us, and give us both
eyes to see, and light also whereby to discern him.

But to come to Adam, the subject of our present discourse. His Religion before
his fall, was not to reunite him to God, from whom he had not been separated,
but to unite him faster, and daily to knit him nearer, in the experience of
that which Nature had ingrafted in him. For what else was his Religion, but a
pure stream of Iusticia originalis.
Original Righteousness, flowing from that Image of God, whereunto he was
created? Whereby his mind was enlightened to know the only very God, and his
heart was engraven, not with the letter, but the life and power of the Law,
loving and proving that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. The
whole man was conformable, and endeavored this holy practice, the body being
pliant and flexible to the rule of the Soul, the Soul to the Spirit, the
Spirit to the Father of Spirits, and God of all Flesh, which no less accepted
of this obedience, and delighted (as the Father in his Child) in this new
model of himself. How happy was that blessed familiarity with God, society
of Angels, subjection of Creatures, envied only of the Devils, because this
was so good, and they so wicked? Nature was his Schoolmaster; or if you will
rather, Gods Usher, that taught him (without learning) all the rules of divine
Learning, of Political, Oeconomicall, and Moral wisdom.

The whole Law was perfectly written in the fleshie Tables of his heart,
besides the especial command concerning the trees in the midst of the Garden,
the one being an universal and everlasting rule of righteousness, the other
by special authority appointed, as the manifestation of Godss Divine
prerogative in commanding, and a trial of man's integrity in obeying. For the
first part hereof, since it was so blurred in our hearts, it was renewed by the
voice and finger of God on Mount Sinai, given then immediately by God himself,
as God over all; whereas the other parts of the Law containing the Ceremonial
and Political ordinances, were mediately given by the Ministry of Moses, as
to that particular Nation.

Neither know I any that make doubt of this whole Law naturally and originally
communicated: save only that some make question of the Sabbath. Howbeit, I
must confess that I see nothing in that Commandment of the Decalogue
prescribed, but is Natural and Moral: for, both the Rest is so far Moral,
as the outward acts of Divine worship cannot be performed without
suspending for a while our bodily labors: although Rest, as a figure, be
Jewish, and in it self, is either a fruit of weariness or idleness. And that
the seventh days observation is natural (I mean the observing one day of
seven in every week) appears both by the first order established in Nature,
when God blessed and sanctified the seventh day; Caluia. Fagit^s, Pagninus,
vrsinus, Hospin^^tyr, tumus, Zanch. OF. colamp. Gibbins besides Perkins, round,
Greenham, Rogers and others.
the stream of Interpreters, especially the later, running and joining in this
interpretation, (the Elder being somewhat more then enough busied in
Allegories): by the reason in the Commandment, drawn from Gods example and
sanctification in the Creation: by the observation of a Sabbath, before this
promulgation of the Law, Exodus 16. and by the division of the days into
weeks, The Heathens by the light of Nature had their weeks; as appears by
naming the days after the seven Planets: and Saturday or Saturns day was by
the Gentiles sequestered from Civil and Martial affairs, being esteemed most
fit for contemplation and devotion, as says Aretius, Probl. de Sab.
both then and before by Noeh, Genes.8. 10. 12. by the necessity of a Sabbath,
as well before the Law in the days of the Patriarchs, as in the times of David
or Solomon: by the perfection of the number of seven in the Scriptures: by the
general consent of all, that it is Moral to set apart some time to the Lord
of times, and an orderly set time to the God of order, which men might
generally agree on for their public devotions: which the Patriarchs practiced
in their sacrifices and assemblies; the Heathens blindly, as other things, in
their Feasts.

Hereunto agrees the judgment of Aquinas, Secunda secunde. q.122. art.4.
Praeceptum de sanctificatione Sabbathi ponitur inter praecepta decalogi, in
quantum est praeceptum morale, non in quantum est caeremoniale. The Precept of
sanctifying the Sabbath, is set amongst the Precepts of the Decalogue, as it is
a moral, not as ceremonial Precept. It has pleased him, Eccles. Pol.
lib.5.^.70.
says M. Hooker, as of the rest, so of times to exact some parts by way of
perpetual homage, never to be dispensed with all nor remitted. The Moral law
requiring therefore a seventh part throughout the age of the whole world to be
that way employed, although with us the day be changed in regard of a new
revolution begun by our Savior Christ, yet the same proportion of time
continues which was before, because in reference to the benefit of Creation,
and now much more of renouation thereunto added by him, which was Prince of the
world to come, we are bound to account the sanctification of one day in seven,
a duty which Gods immutable law does, exact for ever. Thus far Hooker.

This indeed in the Sabbath was Jewish and Ceremonial to observe only that
last and seventh day of the week, and that as a figure, and lastly with those
appointed Ceremonies, and that manner of observation. Thus says Aquinas
Vbisupra:
Habere aliquod tampus deputatum ad vacaendum dominis, cadit sub praecepto
morali. Sed in quantum, etc. To have some set time for the service of God is
moral: but so far this Praecept is ceremonial, as in it is determined a
special time, in sign of the Creation of the World. Likewise it is
ceremonial, according to the allegorical signification; in as much as it was
a sign of the Rest of Christ in the grave, which was the seventh day. And
likewise according to the moral signification, as it signifies a ceasing from
every act of sin, and the Rest of the mind in God. Likewise according to the
Anagogicall signification, as it prefigureth the Rest of the fruition of God,
which shall be in our Country.

To these observations of Thomas we may add that strictness of the
observation, That they might not kindle a fire on the Sabbath, and such like.
And howsoever some testimonies of the Fathers be alleged against this truth,
and to prove, that the Sabbath was borne at Mount Sinai, as of Cited by
Bellarmin. de imagine.l.2.c.7. and by others.
Tertullian, Justin Mariyr, Eusebius, Cyprian, Augustine, which deny the
Sabbatising of the Patriarchs before that time, and account it typical. Why
may we not interpret them of that Sabbath of the Jews, which we have thus
distinguished from the morali Sabbath, by those former notes of difference?
Bronghton in his Concent alleges the Consent of Rabbis, as of Ramban on
Gen.26. and Aben Ezra upon Exodus 20. That the Fathers observed the Sabbath
before Moses. And Moses himself no sooner comes to a seventh day, but he
shows, that Gen.2.2,3.
God rested, blessed, sanctified the same.

It rests therefore, that a time of rest from bodily labor was sanctified
unto spiritual devotions from the beginning of the world, and that a seventh
days rest began, not with the Mosaicall Ceremonies in the Wilderness (as some
men will have it) but with Adam in Paradise. That which is moral (say some) is
eternal, and must not give place; I answer, That the Commandments are
eternal, but yet subordinate. There is a Mark.12.28,and31.
first of all the Commandments, and there is a second like to this, like in
quality, not in equality: and in every Commandment, the Soul of obedience
(which is the obedience of the soul) takes place of that body of obedience
which is performed by the body. Mercy is preferred before sacrifice, and
charity before outward worship; Act.10.9.
Paul stays his preaching, to heal Emychus: Christ patronizeth Mark.2.25.
his Disciples, plucking the ears of Corn, and affirms, That the Sabbath
was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Although therefore both rest and
works of the Sabbath give place to such duties, which the present occasion
presents, as more weighty and necessary to that time, yet does it not
follow, that the Sabbath is not moral, no more than the Commandment of alms
is not moral, because (as Qualitas praeceptorum praefigit metam. Esi. v.g.

cases of necessity. And therefore such scrupulous Refert. Tho. Rogers.
fancies as some obtrude under the name of the Sabbath, esteeming it a greater
sin to violate this holy Rest, than to commit murder, cannot be defended.

Pardon this long Discourse, whereunto the longer Discourses of others have
brought me. But now me thinks I hear thee say, And what is all this to Adams
integrity? Doubtless, Adam had his particular calling, to till the ground:
his general calling also, to serve God; which as he was spiritually to
perform in all things, so being a body, he was to have time and place set
apart for the bodily performance thereof. And what example could he better
follow then of his Lord and Creator? But some object, This is to slacken him
running, rather then to incite and provoke him; to bind, and not to loose him,
can not be a spur, but a bridle to his devotion: but they should consider,
that we do not tie Adam to the seventh day only, but to the seventh
especially, wherein to perform set, public, and solemn worship. Neither did
Daniel, that prayed thrice a day, or David, in his seven times, or Saint Paul,
in his iniunction of praying continually, conceive that the Sabbath would
hinder men, and not rather further them in these works. Neither was Adams
state so excellent, as that he needed no helps; which woeful experience in his
fall has taught. God gave him power to live, yea with an everlasting life: and
should not Adam therefore have eaten, yea and have had convenient times for
food and sleep and other natural necessities? How much more in this perfect,
yet flexible and variable condition of his soul, did he need means of
establishment, although even in his outward calling he did not forget, nor was
forgotten? Which outward works, though they were not irksome and tedious, as
sin has made them to us, yet did they detain his body, and somewhat
distract his mind, from that full and entire service which the Sabbath might
exact of him. Neither do they show any strong reason for their opinion, which
hold the sanctification of the Sabbath, Genesis 2. to be set down by way of
anticipation, or as a preparatiue to the Jewish Sabbath, ordained Setbus
Catris. 2453. Bur. Ormeerus, etc. 1454.
2453 years after.

If any shall ask why the same seventh day is not still observed of
Christians; I answer, this was figurative, and is abolished; but a seventh day
still remains. Lex naturalis est. coniunctam habens ceremonialem
designationem diei (says Iunius.) The Law is natural, having adjoined thereto
the ceremonial appointment of the day. But why is this day now called the
Lords day? I answer, even therefore, because it is the Lords day, not changed
by the Churches Constitution Mere, as some seem to hold; except by the
Churches authority they mean Christ and his Apostles: nor descended to us by
Tradition, as the Papists maintain, seeing the Scriptures Act. 20.7.1. Cor.
16.21. Apoc. 1.10. mention the name and celebration by the constant practice of
the Apostles: yea, Christ himself, as he rose on that day, so did he usually
appear on that day to his Apostles before his Ascension. Christ therefore and
his Apostles are our authors of this change. And the Church ever since has
constantly observed it. The Fathers teach, yea the Papists themselves
acknowledge this truth. So Bellarmine de Cultu Sanct. l. 3. c. 11. says, Ius
diuintum requirebat vt vnus dies Hebdomade dicaretur cultni diuino: non autem
conuexiebat vt seruaretur Sabbathum: staque ab Apostolis in drem Dominicum
versum Congerit ibi testimonia Ignaty, Tertull. Clem. Orig. Athanas. Ambros.
Hicron. Gregor. Leonin. Hilary.
est. It was in the Primitive Church called the Lords day, Chrysostom. Ser. 5. de
Resurrect.
the day of Bread and of Light, because of the Sacraments of the Supper and
Baptism, therein administered, called Bread and Light. And how it may be
ascribed to Tradition, Bell. deverbo Deinon scripto, l. 4. c. 7.
Bellarmine, the great Patron of Traditions, shows out of Justin Martyr, who
says, Christus hacillis (Apostolis and Discipulis) tradaidit. Justin in fine
2. Apolog. He there also reports, That they had their Ecclesiastical
Assemblies every Lords day. The Rhemists, which ascribe it to Tradition in
Annot. Mat. 15. acknowledge the institution thereof, in Annot. 1. Cor. 16. 2.
Ignatius may be allowed Arbiter in this question of the Sabbath, who thus
writes to the Magnesians: Non Sabbatisemus, Let us not observe the Sabbath
after the Jewish manner, as delighting in ease; For he that works not, let
him not eat: but let every one of us keep the Sabbath spiritually, not eating
meat dressed the day before, and walking set spaces, etc. But let every
Christian celebrate the Lords day, consecrated to the Lords resurrection, as
the Queen and Princess of all days.

Now for the particular Commandment, which was given him as an especial
proof of his obedience, in a thing otherwise not unlawful, it was the
forbidding him to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. For in the midst
of the Garden God had planted two Trees, which some call Sacraments, and were,
by Gods Ordinance, signs unto him; one of life, if he obeyed; the other of
death, by disobedience: Not as the Jews thought, and Julian scoffed, That the
Tree had power to give sharpness of wit. And although some think signs
needless to so excellent a creature; yet being mutable, subject to temptation,
and each way flexible to virtue or vice, according as he used his natural
power of free will, I see not why they should deny God that liberty to
impose, or man that necessity to need such monitories, and (as it were)
Sacramental instructions. For what might these Trees have furthered him in
carfulness, if he had considered life and death, not so much in these Trees,
as in his free will, and obeying or disobeying his Creator?

These Trees, in regard of their signification, and event, are called the Tree
of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil; which was not evil or
hurtful in it self, but was a visible rule, whereby good and evil should be
known, and that by reason of the Commandment annexed, which he might by this
Precept see to be grounded in obeying or disobeying the authority of the
Lawgiver. An easy rule, and yet too easily broken. For when as God did hereby
challenge his own Soueraignetie, by imposing so easy a fine, which might have
forbidden all but one (as contrariwise he allowed) and fore-signified the
danger, that he might continue his goodness to man, continuing in obedience,
yet did Man herein show his contempt, in rejecting so easy a yoke, and so
light a burden. I will not reason whether these two Trees may properly be
called Sacraments; of which (say some) the one was but for the bodily life, and
better never to have touched the other; this we know, that in eating of this
he lost both bodily and spiritual life, which the name and institution thereof
forewarned, and should have preunted: otherwise, in eating of the other,
immortality had been sealed both in soul and body, to him and his for ever.
Strange it seems, that he should need no monitorie signs to prevent that,
which, even with these helps added, he did not eschew.

CHAP. V.
Of the fall of Man: and of Original Sixne.

HItherto we have beheld the Creation of the World, and of our first Parents,
the lively Images of the Creator and the Creature; whom we have somewhat
leisurely viewed in a naked Majesty, delighting themselves in the enamelled
walks of their delightful garden. The Rivers whereof ran to present their
best offices to their new Lords, from which they were forced by the backer
streams, greedy of the sight and place which they could not hold: The Trees
stouped to behold them, offering their shadie mantle and variety of fruits, as
their natural tribute: each creature in a silent gladness rejoiced in them,
and they enjoyed all mutual comforts in the Creator, the Creatures, and in
themselves. A blessed pair, who enjoyed all they desired, whiles their desire
was worth the enjoying: Lords of all, and of more than all, Content; which
might, in all they saw, see their Makers bounty: and beyond all they could
see, might see themselves comprehended, where they could not comprehend: of
that infinite Greatness and Goodness, which they could not but love,
reverence, admire, and adore. This was then their Religion, to acknowledge with
thankfulness, to be thankful in obedience, to obey with cheerfulness, the
Author of all this good: to the performance whereof they found no outward, no
inward impediment; Sickness, Perturbation, and Death (the deformed issue of
Sin) not yet being entered into the world.

In this plight did Satan (that old Serpent) see, disdain, and envy them. It
was not enough for him and the devilish crew of his damned associates, for
their late rebellion, to be banished Heaven, but the inferior World must be
filled with his venom, working that malice on the creatures here, which he
could not there so easily wrecke on their Creator. And because Man was here
Gods Deputy and Lieutenant, as a petty God on the Earth, he chooses him as
the fittest subject, in whose ruin to despite his Maker. To this end he uses
not a Lion-like force, which then had been bootlesse, but a Serpentine
slight, using that subtle creature as the meetest instrument to his
Labyrinthian proiects. Whereas by inward temptation he could not so easily
prevail, by insinuating himself into their minds, he winds himself into
this winding Beast, disposing the Serpents tongue to speak to the woman (the
weaker vessel) singled from her husband, and by questioning does first
undermine her. It is by all affirmed, that the fall was very soon after the
Creation, as appears by circumstances of the narration, by Satan's malice,
the woman's virginity: and many hold, it was the very day of their Creation.
Bibliand. Broughtons Concent, Praeter antiquos August. Iren. Chrysust. etc.
The woman (whether she had not yet experience in the nature of the creatures,
or did admire so strange an accident, and would satisfy her curious mind in
the further trial) entertained discourse, and was presently snared. For though
she held her to the Commandment, yet the threatening annexed she did
somewhat mince and extenuate. What she seemed to lessen, he feared not to
annihilate, and wholly disannull, propounding not only impunitie, but
advantage, That they should be as Gods, in the enriching of their minds with
further knowledge. This he persuadeth by the equiuocating in the name of the
Tree (the first equivocation we read of, Io 8. 44.
otherwhere plainly termed a lie) charging God with falsehood and malignitie.

Thus he that abode not in the Truth himself, but was a Manslayer from the
beginning, and the father of Lying, which he no where else borrowed, but had of
his own, persuaded her by his great subtlety first to doubt of Gods Truth in
his Word (the first particular sin that ever man's heart entertained, for the
other were but occasions and inducements; disobedience and unthankfulness are
more general) after that she unlawfully lusted after this new knowledge,
bewitched with the pleasantness of the fruit to the taste and sight, she took
and did eat, and gave to her husband likewise. The highest power of the Soul
is first intrapped, the lusting and sensible faculties follow after, justly
plagued by a correspondent inward rebellion, that the sense now rules the
appetite; and this the reason, in our corrupt estate, which hence proceeded.

Foolish and wicked is their conceit, that measure this sin by the fruit (a
Nut or Apple) that was eaten: as Pope Julius, That said he might be as well
angtie for his Peacocke, as God (whose Vicar he was) for an Apple: Bal. de vit.
Pont.
Thus unbelief brought forth unthankfulness; unthankfulness, pride; from
thence ambition, and all that rabble of contempt of Gods Truth, believing the
Devils lies, abuse of the creatures to wanton lust, Sacrilegious usurping that
which God had reserved, scandalous provocation of her husband, with the murder
bodily and ghostly, of him, her self, and their whole posterity for ever: and
whereas yet they had done so little service to God, yet they offered almost
their First fruits to the devil, having Free will to have resisted if they
would. No marvel then if such a combination of so many sins in one, wrung
from the justice of God such a multitude of judgments on them and theirs, in
the defacing that goodly and glorious Image of God; subiecting (in stead
thereof) the body to Sickness, Cold, Heat, Nakedness, Hunger, Thirst,
Stripes, Wounds, Death; the Mind to Ignorance, Doubtings, Vanity, Phancies,
Phrenzies; the Will to Vnstayednesse, Passions, Perturbations; the whole Man is
made a slave to Sin within him, to the Devil without; whence he must expect
wages suitable to his work, Death; Spiritual, Natural, and Eternal: an
infinite punishment for offending Posse si vellent sed non velle vt possens.
an infinite Majesty.

Thus had they put out their light in obscure darkness: and if they were not
presently cast into utter darkness, it was Gods mercy (not their merit) which
suspended the first and natural death, to prevent that second and eternal.
But spiritually they were even already dead in sins, as appeared by the
accusations of their conscience; whereof Moses says, Genesis 3. 7.
The eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.
Conscience, before Virtues keeper, was now become Hels harbenger, thence
flashing lightnings in the face of their minds, to show that their nakedness
did now appear filthy in Gods sight: Lightnings indeed, which could only
lighten to terrify, not enlighten with instruction and comfort: Which spark
remains after the fire of Gods image extinct, by the merciful providence of
God, in some Spiritus reprimens, and renouans.
to be a bridle of Nature, least they should run into all excess of
villainy, and not leave a face of the world in the world, and to be to others,
by disposition and working of a higher and supernatural Light, a preparatiue
to, and a preservative in that Light of Life. So much the greater is their
sin, that seek to flash out these flashings: and whereas they cannot read
the book of Scripture, and will not read the book of the Creature, labor to
extinguish also this Light of Nature, that with feared consciences they may
more freely in darkness commit the works of darkness. And even this did Adam
seek, if God had not brought him out of his Owls nest. For what could a
Figge-leafe hide from God? and did they think the innocent Trees would
conspire with them to conceal Traitors? Was there any darkness which was not
Light to him? Or could Breeches and Trees cover their Souls, which received
the first and worst Nakedness; till which, Nakedness to the body was a
Clothing of Beauty, a Liuerie of Bounty, an Ensign of Majesty? Such Ier. 2.
13.
broken pits seek they that forsake the Fountain of living Waters.

And yet when God comes into Judgment, and Genesis 3. 8.
makes the winds to usher him unto his private Sessions in Paradise; to those
shiftlesse shifts they added worse, impiously accusing God, uncharitably
charging one another, to put from themselves that blame which thus claue faster
to them. A medicine worse than the disease, or a disease in stead of a medicine
is hypocrisy, that will not see her own sickness, and seeks rather cover,
then to cure; to cover by charging others, then recover by discharging it
self; as if equity pretended were not iniquity doubled. God proceeds to
sentence, a sentence worthy of God, showing at once his infinite justice in
the punishment of sin, and no less infinite mercy, to provide an infinite
price to redeem us, by his infinite power bringing good out of evil, and by
his manifold Wisdom taking that wise one in his craftiness, who in the
destruction of man had sought Gods dishonor. So good is it that evil should
be, when this sovereign goodness purposes to effect his good will by wicked
instruments, out of their darkness producing his own marvelous light: as
appeared in this work of Satan an adversary, intended to his despite; in and
by the promised Seed, disposed to his glory. Gen.3.14.
The Serpent has a bodily curse in his future bodily difficulties, which still
continue, for his isntrumental and bodily employment.

The Verse..15.
old Serpent and spiritual enemy has a spiritual and eternal curse, the
breaking of his head by that Seed of the woman, that should once lead
Captivity captive. Our parents are cursed, yet so, as their curse is turned
into a blessing; all things working to the best: In sorrow shall be the woman's
conceptions, but recompensed with the joy which follows (and is as it were
the midwife in their travel) because of Job.16.21.
fruit borne into the world; and more then recompensed, in that they are
1.Tim.2.vlt.
saved by bearing of children, if they continue in the fanh, and live in
holmesse with modesty. Adam is set to labor, not as before, with delight, but
with pain and difficulty; the Earth also being cursed for his sake: yet by
this narrow way, by this crosse-way he is guided to Heaven; the hope whereof
was given him, before Paradise was taken from him. So true is it, that in
judgment he remembers mercy, if we can learn to live by faith and not by
sight.

This, that Moses tells of the fall of Man, Experience does in manner
proclaim through the world, in the manifold effects thereof, which we daily
see. For whereas the World was made for Man, as before is showed, who alone, in
regard of his bodily and spiritual nature, can need and use it, no creature in
the world is in his kind so imperfectas Man. He that was before as an earthly
God, is now become an incarnate devil, and for aspiring to be like his Lord,
was made a servant of his servants; the noblest part in him becoming a base
officer to degrade him, Reason it self derected at the feet of sense, to be a
slave, and a very Baud to sensual pleasures, a very Broker for
dunghill-profits. And what is this but to metamorphose man into a beast?
unless that some in a lower degree, living only to live, suffocated with
eating, drinking, sleeping, are degenerated into plants? And if he descend not
lower, to become torpide and lifelesse, yet does he participate the
imperfections of those things, and that without their perfections, as if with
an imperfect retrograde he would return into his first elements. What stone so
hard as man's heart is relent less, remorselesse to his best good? What dust
more subject to the wind, or water more flexible, then he to temptation and
sin? But those things remain in their nature, or natural place: Man is a
fuming smoke, a passing shadow. And yet if we could stay at our Elements, it
were somewhat better, but we are servants and drudges beneath all names of
baseness, vnbowelling the earth, and our selves in the earth, for a little
hardened earth, that never had the dignity to see, no not to be seen of the
Sun. We seem to rule the Sky, Winds, and Seas; indeed we adventure our
lives to their mercy, and not three fingers thickness does separate us from
death, that we may bring home an idle discourse, or somewhat, almost less then
nothing, that we call a Jewel. Once, we inuert Nature, subvert others, pervert
our selves, for those things which sometimes kill the body, and always (except
a power, with whom all things are possible, prevent) the Soul: And yet
L^c.12.20
Thou fool, this night they may fetch away thy Soul; and whose then shall
these things be? And whose then, and where then, shall thou be? Thou gainest
fair to lose thy self, to be taken with thy taking, to be thus bad to others,
that thou may be worse to thy self: and when as (like an Ass) thou have
been laden all the days of thy life with those things, which even in having
thou wantedst, now to be more intolerably burdened, now to be in Hell, which
will never be satisfied in thee, whose character was before engraven in thy
insatiable heart. Tell me not then of the reasonable power of our Souls,
whereby we resemble God, seeing that reason may tell thee and me, that by
abusing it Ignat. ad Magnes.Epist. Pins homo rumisma est a Deo cusum: impius,
adulterinum, non a deysed diabolo effectum.
we are like, and ^o.8.44.
are of our father the devil. That erected countenance to be still grouelling
in, and poring on the earth; that immortal soul to mind only such things as
have not the imperfect privilege to be mortal; those high excelle^cies to be
abused to mischief, blaspheming, denying, forswearing God, and all for the
basest of the basest creatures. Well might this deluge of corruption move that
Diog.Laer. 1.6.
Cynick, in a throng of men to make search for a man, this man which is now
left us being but the ruins, the carkas of himself. But what needs all this?
Why are we fallen into so long and tedious discourse of our fall? Even because
some are fallen further, beyond all sense and feeling of their fall, and believe
not that man was ever any other creature then now they see: that if their
goodness cannot, yet their wickedness might teach them, that so perfect a world
should not have bin framed for so imperfect a wretch, now only perfect in
imperfection. Our fall must teach us to rise, our straying to return, our
degeneration a regeneration. And therefore was not that image of God wholly done
out, but some remainder continued to the posterity, to convince the^ of
misery in themselves, that so denying themselves, they might take up their
Cross, and follow the second Adam unto a durable happiness.

But how (may some ask, as Iul.Pelagian. in August.
the Pelagian did) came this misery tovs? Non peccat ille qui genuit, non
peccat ille qui condidit, per quas igitur rimas inter tot praesidia innocentiae
fingis peccatum ingressum. Does it agree with divine Justice, that if the
fathers have eaten sour grapes, the childrens teeth should be set on edge? I
answer we are heirs of our father, we need not seek some secret craney, we
see an open gate, Rom.5.12.
by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin. A little leave let
us borrow to clear this difficulty. Sin is 1.Io.3.4.
a transgression of the Law, or a defect of conformity to the Law, (...) and
cannot properly be said to have an efficient, but a deficient cause, being in
it own nature and subsistence, (...). The Aqu.I.2.q.7I.6. Dorbel. Viguer etc
Schoolmen say, in sin are two things to be considered, the substance and
the quality, essence and privation, the act and defect, where of that they
call the material, this the formal part of sin, being nothing else but a
deformity, irregularitie, and unlawfulness in our natural condition and
conditions, as easy to be distinguished, though not to be divided, from the
action, as lamenesse from the working hand, or iarring in an Instrument, both
from the Instrument and sound. The sinner is termed nequam, as nequicquam,
naught, as not ought. Not that sin is simply nothing, Non negatine sed
privative Nihil, says Melancthon Mel.loc.Com. N. hill negatiuum est causa
nilhil priuatiui: quaedam sc.inclinatio creaturae ad suum illud nihii, vnde
primum ortum and creatum est. More. de veritate C.R.
nor is it a mere and pure privation, but to be considered with that subject,
wherein and whereof it is such a distortion and destruction:* the want of this
consideration drove the Manichees to their heretical opinion of two beings and
beginnings. Sin was first seen in the Devil, who voluntarily strayed from
the right way, and as he abode not in the Truth himself, so he beguiled our
first Parents, from whom, by the Conduit of Nature, it is conveyed to us. I
speak of original sin, which is our inheritance; for actual sins are our
own purchase and improuement, and yet bought with that stock which our parents
left us. Our first parents are to be considered, not as singularpersons only,
whereby they defiled themselves, but as the root of mankind, which had received
original right ousnes, to keep or to loose to them and theirs as a
perpectuall inheritance. As in the Body Politic the Act of the Prince is
reputed the Act of the whole; the consent of a Burgess in Parliament binds
the whole City which he represents: and Aqu.in To.5.
as in the natural Body the whole Body is liable to the guilt of that fact
which the head or hand has committed: as a root to his branches, a Fountain
to his streams, does convey the goodness or badnesse which it self has
received: So stands it betwixt us and Adam our natural Prince, the Burgess of
the World, the Head of this humane Body and Generation, the Root and Fountain
of our Humanity. When he sinned, he lost to himself and us that Image of God,
or that part of the Image of God, which he had received for himself and us,
not the substance, nor the facuities of body or soul, but the conformity in
that substance and faculties to the will of God, in righteousness and
holiness of truth.

Not so much therefore are we here to consider the ordinary course of Nature,
wherein Ezekiel.18.4.
the soul that sins, it shall die: as the Ordinance of God, who appointed
the first Adam the Wellspring of Nature, which he received incorrupted; the
second of Grace; that as men, we all by generation are of the first and with
the first, Ephesians.4.22.
one old man, in whom we all sinned; of and with the second Adam we are
Col.3.10. 1.Co^.12. Rom.5
all one new man in the Lord, even one Body, one Spirit, one Seed, one Christ,
in whom, and with whom, we, as members of that Head, obeyed the Precepts,
and suffered the Curse of the Law. Persolum primam pec^^^^^ sub^^t^^^^ell bonum
naturz, per alia pe^cat^: bon^ gratiae personales. A pe. in Rom.5.
Other sins of Adam are not our natural, but his personal, because he could
be no longer a public person, then while he had some what to save or loose for
us; all being already forfeited in this first Sin. The Author then of
Original Sin is the propagator of our Nature: his actual sin is
originally ours, the Guilt being derived by impatation, the Corruption by
natural generation. First, that Person corrupted Nature; after, Nature
infected our Persons. The matter of this original corruption, in regard of the
subject, is All and every man, and all and every part of all and every man,
subject to all sin, that if all be not as bad as any, and the best as the
worst, it must be ascribed to Gods restraining, or renewing, not unto unequal
degrees in this original stain. In regard of the object, the matter of it is
the want of original Rightcousnesse, and a contrario inclination to Evil,
Gen.6.5.
the imagmations of our hearts being only evil continually. No grapes can
grow on these thorns. The form of this corruption is the deformity of our
corrupted Nature, not by infusion or imitation, but by default of that first
instrument, by which this Nature descends. It is the root of actual sins:
and whereas they, as fruits, are transient, this still remains, until Christ
by his death destroys this death in us.

But here arises another difficulty; How this sin can be derived by
Generation, seeing it is truly believed, that God is Heb.12.9.
the Father of Spirits, the Ecc.12.7. Gen.2.7. Zac.12.1.
Former of our Souls, which does by infusion create, and by creation infuse
them: corruptible elements being unable to procreate an incorruptible
substance, or generation to produce incorruption. Neither stands it with
reason, that he which communicates not the substance, should communicate the
accidents; or with justice, that an innocent Soul should necessarily be
stained by involuntarie infusion into a polluted body.

I answer hereunto, That although the Soul be not traducted (as they term
it) and by generation conferred; yet is it coupled to the body in that manner
and order which God had appointed for the conjunction thereof, though man had
not sinned: Neither was it the Soul alone in Adam, or the body alone, but the
Person, consisting of both, which sinned. Neither can we be partakers of
Natures sin, till we be partakers of Humane Nature, which is not, till the
Soul and Body be united. We are not so much therefore to look to the
concupiscence and lust of the Parents in generation, on, as Lib.Sent.2. Did
^.1.
'Lumbard teaches us, but to the Person; which, Super sent.
Scotus says, is filia Adae, and debitrix iustitiae originalis. And although
the Soul be not in the Seed, yet is communicated to the Body (says Aquinas)
by a dispositiue or preparatiue power of the Seed, which disposes and
prepares the Body to the receiving of the Soul, where it is received (after
the Vnumquodq, recipitur lecundiun modum recipientis.
general rule) according to the measure and nature of that which receives.
The Father is then a perfect Father, not because he begets the Soul, but
because he begets the Person, or at least all whatsoever in the Person is
begotten: and though he does not beget the substance thereof; yet, as it is
such a subsistence, he may be said to procreate it, because his generation
works toward the Union of the Soul and Body; which Union is made by the
Spirits, Animal and Vital. And Zanch. de operib. D. part.3.
these Spirits are procreated by the Seed, and consist of a middle nature, as
it were betwixt bodily and spiritual: so that the production of the Soul, and
incorporating thereof, may be counted in the middle way between Creation and
Generation. And therefore this original corruption did not reach to Christ
Jesus, although he were true Man, because he was the Seed of the woman, and
did not descend of Adam by generation ( per seminalem rationem, tanquam a
principio actiuo, says Aquinas) but was miraculously framed in the womb, and
of the substance of the Virgin, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Thus have I presumed to offer my crude and rude meditations to the wiser
World, about the deriuation of Original sin, which it self is the cause why
we can no better see it, as darkness hides it self. But the whole City of
Mankind being herewith set on fire, it behooves every one to be more careful
to quench it, then ouer-curiously to enquire how it came: It is sufficient,
that nothing descended hereby to us by corruption, or was made ours by
imputation, which is not fully cured by Christ: who is 1.Cor.1.30.
made unto us (both by imputation of his active and passive obedience, and by
real infusion of his Spirit) Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and
Redemption; if we have Faith to receive it, and Charitle to express it: an
absolute renewer and perfecter of the Image of God, beyond what we had in our
first Parents lost.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Relics of the divine Image after the fall, whereby naturally men
addict themselves unto some Religion: and what was the Religion of the World
before the Flood.

THis Sin of our first Parents, whereby they were almost no sooner made then
marred (being, as some suppose, formed and deformed in one day; so interpreting
the Psalm, Psalm.49.12.
That he lodged not one night in honor, but became as the beasts that perish.
Eroughton out of the Rabbines in his Concent. Perer. in G.^1.6.
) This Sin (I say) did not wholly deprive us of the Image of God, whereunto
we were created. A remainder and stumpe thereof continued, like to the stumpe
of 1.Sam.S.4.
Dagon, whose head and hands were cut off by his fall; or like the stumpe of
Dan.4.12.
Nabochodonosers Tree, whose roots were less in the earth, bound with a band
of Iron and Brass among the grass of the field. So was man's head and hands
fallen off before the Arc, that his wisdom remaining was foolishness with
God; not sufficient to one good thought, not able either to will or to do that
which might please God. And though the stumpe remained (the substance and the
faculties of Body and Soul) yet was this stumpe left in the earth, fast bound
with Iron and Brass, his earthly mind captiued and chayned with worldly
vanities and devilish villainies. Or to use Lumbards comparison, Lib.2.sens.
Did.25.
he was like the man Luc.10.30.
fallen among thieves, wounded and spoiled: wounded in his natural parts,
spoiled and robbed of the gifts of grace, which God by especial grace added to
his Nature, in that first beautifying of this his Image.

In the state of Creation Man was made 10 Statu, potuit non peccare. 20 Non
potest non peccare. 30 Premitur sed non vincitur: nondum habet posse omnize non
peccare. 40 Non potest peccare. Lumb. ibid.
able to commit no Sin; in the state of Corruption he cannot but Sin:
until a third state of grace do free him; not from the being, but from the
reigning and imputation of Sin, whereby he is prepared to a fourth state of
glory, wherein shall be no possibility of sinning, or necessity of striving
against sin. And howsoever in this corrupt state of Nature, in our Spiritual
actions, which merely concern the Kingdom of Heaven, we cannot but sin,
yet has not God left himself without witness, even in this darkness to
convince us of sin. Such are those notions, sown by Natures hand in every of
our hearts; according to which evidence, Conscience as a Witness, Patron, or
Judge within us, Rom.2.15.
accuses, excuses, condemns, or absolueth; that hereby God may be Rom.3 4.
justified, and all the world inexcusably sinful; and that hereby also a way
might be left in Gods infinite mercy for man's recovery. His intent was We
must understand that God. though in the beginning he suffered man to fall, etc.
yet vouchsafed of his goodness so far to uphold in him both light of
understanding and truth of conscience, as might serve to direct him in some
sort for moral and civil life, for the preservation and maintenance of
society amongst men. D.Abbot. Defenc.3. part.page 68.
not to destroy us utterly (as justly he might, and as it besell the rebellious
Angels) but by this punishment to recall us to subjection; not to break us in
pieces in his wrath, but by wrath to reclaim us to mercy.

Thus Nature suggesteth, Reason conuinceth, and is convinced, That there is a
God: that that God has created the World (as we before have showed) and that
for Man: that Man, to whom all things serve, is to serve God, who has
subjected them to him. Does not Nature teach the son to honor his Father,
and the servant his Lord? Mal.1.6.
If he then be our Father, where is his honor? if our Lord, where is his
fear? Nature infers, Reason urges this, and from that ground of Reason
does Scripture reason, the nature whereof in our nature is written. Even by
Reasons Principles we learn, That so perfect a hand, as made all these
inferior things in such perfection, would not have been so imperfect in the
perfectest of them all, so to have left him in the Creation, as we now see him
in Corruption. The Morn.de ver. ChapterR.
Philosophers saw, Man was a little World, for whom the greater was made, who
himself was made for more then the World: and that he, for whom so durable
and substantial a thing was made, must needs be made for another then this
frail and wretched life; that is, for the everlasting life with him, that is
the Everlasting. And that is the foundation of all Religion. For what else is
Religion, but the School, wherein we learn man's duty toward God, and the
way to be linked most straightly to him? And what are all the exercises of
Religion, but acknowledgements of the Godhead, of the Creation of the World, of
the provident order therein, and ordering thereof, of the Souls immortality,
of Man's fall and imperfection, of our sovereign and supreme good to be sought
out of our selves? Of all which Nature and Reason are witnesses, not to the
learned alone, whose testimonies in this kind may easily be produced, but even
to the societies of men; yea, where as neither Art, nor Industry, nor civil
Society has bound men as men together, yet the grounds of these things have
bound them as men, by the mere bond of humane Nature, to God, in some or other
Religion.

God, Man, and Religion, are necessarily linked, as a Father, a Son, and
Obedience, as a Lender, a Debtor, and a Bond. The wit no sooner conceiueth that
there is a God, but the will infers that he ought to be worshipped. What
Philosophers, or what Politicians ever taught the Eastern and Western
Islands, discovered in this last Age of the World, this necessity of Religion?
And yet (as follows in this History to be showed) they which never wore
clothes on their bodies, never furnished their minds with Arts, never knew any
Law (besides Reason grown almost lawless) or Magistrate, but their Fathers:
which, when they saw other men, could not tell whether they were The Indians
seeing the Spaniards mounted, thought the horse and man to be all one: they
thought them also immortal, and fallen from Heaven.
heavenly wights, or earthly monsters, these yet wearied themselves in
Superstitions; showing it easier to put off our selves, then to put the
Principles of Religion out of our selves. Yea, among all the Lessons which
Nature has taught, this is deepeliest indented: not Arts, not Policy, nay not
Raiment, not Food, not Life it self esteemed so dear, and that naturally, to
men, as their Religion. Hereof let this History ensuing be witness, which
will show the Reader, every where, in manner, over the World, this natural
zeal of that which they esteem Religion, beyond all things else esteemed most
natural.

Some, in the guilty conscience of their own irreligion (as Aesops Fox, that
being by casualtie deprived of his tail, sought to persuade all Foxes to cut
off theirs as unprofitable burdens) would tell us that which they Tibi, non
sibi: interdu^, non noctu. D. King. on ^onas.
cannot tell to themselves, which they dare not tell, but as they dare,
whisper, That Religion is but a continued Custom, or a wiser Policy, to hold
men in awe. But where had Custom this beginning? And what is Custom, but an
uniform manner, and continuance of outward Rites? Whereas Religion it self is
in the heart, and produces those outward ceremonial effects thereof. In one
Country men observe one habit of attire, another in another: So likewise of
diet: and yet is it natural to be clothed, more natural to eat, but natural
most of all, as is said, to observe some kind of Religion.

The Grecians He^^^
burned their dead parents, the Indians intombed them in their own bowels:
Darius could not by great sums procure the Grecians to the Indian, or these
to the Grecian custom: yet was that which moved both, and began either
custom, one and the same principle of piety and religious duty, howsoever
diversely expressed. Yea even the most lascivious, cruel, beastly, and
devilish observations, were grounded upon one principle, That God must be
served: which service they measured by their own crooked rules, every where
disagreeing, and yet meeting in one center, the necessity of Religion.

As for Policy, although it is before answered; yet this may be added, That
whereas men with all threatenings, promises, punishments, rewards, can scarce
establish their political ordinances; religion insinuates and establishes it
self: yea takes naturally such rooting, that all political laws and
tortures cannot pluck it up. How many Martyrs Not only the true Religion has
had Martirs: but Jewish, Turkish, Ethnike, Heretical superstitions and
idolatries: Have not our eyes seen Brownists, and Papists, every where else
iar, and yet meet in the halter, whiles one pretense of religion has moved
the^ to commotion, and disturbance of the State? and even while we write these
things, what mad Martyrs have we had for Arianisme and other blasphemies?
has Religion; yea Superstition yielded? but who will lay down his life to
seal some Politicians authority? And so far is it that Religion should be
grounded on Policy, that Policy borrows help of Religion. Thus did Numa
father his Roman laws on Aegeria, and other Law-giuers on other supposed
Deities, which had been a foolish argument, and unreasonable manner of
reasoning, to persuade one obscurity by a greater, had not Nature before
taught them religious awe to God, of which they made use to this civil
obedience of their laws, supposed to spring from a Divine fountain. Yea the
falsehoods and variety of religions are evidences of this Truth; seeing men
will rather worship a Beast, stock, or the basest creature, then profess no
religion at all. The Diagoras, Euhemerus, Theodor. Cyren.
Philosophers also that are accused of Atheism, for the most part, did not
deny religion simply, but that irreligious religion of the Greeks in
idolatrous superstition, Socrates rather swearing by a dog, or an oak, then
acknowledging such Gods. It is manifest then, that the Image of God was by the
Fall depraved, but not utterly extinct; among other sparks this also being
raked up in the ruins of our decayed Nature, some science of the Godhead,
some conscience of Religion: although the true Religion can be but one, and
that which God himself teaches, as the only true way to himself; all other
religions being but strayings from him, whereby men wander in the dark, and in
labyrinthes of error: like men drowning, that get hold on every twig, or the
foolish fish that leapeth out of the drying pan into the fire.

Thus God left a spark of that light covered under the ashes of it self,
which himself vouchsafed to kindle into a flame, never since, never after to
be extinguished. And although that rule of Divine Justice had denounced
Gen.2.17.
morte morieris, to die, and again to die a first and second death; yet
unasked, yea by cauilling excuses further provoked, he by the promised seed
erected him to the hope of a first and second resurrection; a life of Grace
first, and after of Glory. The Son of God is promised to be made the seed of
the Woman: the substantial Colos.1.15.
Image of the invisible God, to be made after the Image and similitude of a
Man, to reform and transform him again into the former Image and similitude
of God: that he, which in the Phil.2.6.
form of God thought it not robbery (for it was nature) to be equal with
God, should be made nothing to make us something, should not spare himself
that he might spare us, should become partaker of our Nature, flesh of our
flesh, and bone of our bone, that he might make us 2. Pet.1.4. Epbes.5.30.
partakers of the Divine nature, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. This
was that seed of the Woman, that has broken the Serpents head, which by death
has overcome death, and him that had the power of death. the Devil, who
submitted himself to a death in it self bitter, before men shameful, and of
God accursed, that he might bring us to a life peaceable, glorious, and
blessed, beyond what eye has seen, or heart can conceive.

This promise of this Seed slain from the beginning of the world, was the seed
of all true Religion, the soul of faith, the life of hope, the wellspring of
charity. True it is that all received not this promise alike: for a seed of
the Serpent was fore-signified also, which should bruise the heel of the
Woman's seed. And this in the first seed and generation of man soon appeared:
Cain and Abel were hereof lively examples. It appears that God had taught
Adam and Eve how they should worship him, and they faithfully instructed their
children herein: These accordingly Genesis 4. 3.
in process of time brought and offered their sacrifices.

As concerning sacrifices, some hold opinion (according to their own practice)
that Perer in Genesis lib 7. Potuit id Abel naturali ratione cognitum habere and
tacito quodam naturae instinctu adduci, etc.
Nature might teach Adam this way of serving God: as if Nature were as well
able to find the way, as to know that he is out of the way, and were as well
seen in the particular manner, as in the general necessity of Religion. We
cannot see the Sun without the Sun, nor come to God but by God, to whom
1.Sam.15. 22.
Obedience is better then sacrifice, and to harken, better then the fat of
Rams. Abel, says the Scripture, Hebr.11.4.
offered by faith, without which faith it is impossible to please God: but
faith has necessary relation Rom.10.17.
to the word of God, who otherwise will be Esaias 1.14.
weary of our solemnities, and asks, who has required them at our hands.
These sacrifices also, besides that they were acknowledgements of their
thankefulnes, and real confessions of their sin and death, due to them
therefore, did lead them by the hand to Christ that Lamb of God that should
take away the sins of the world, figured by these slain beasts, confirming
their faith in the promise and hope of the accomplishment: of which Nature
could not once have dreamed, which has rather, The mystery of our redemption
by Christ is merely supernatural:
the impression of some confused notions, that we have lost the way and ought
to seek it, then either light to discern it, or wisdom to guide us in it.

Of sacrificing there were from the beginning two kinds, the one called (...)
Gifts or oblations of things without life: the other Victims (so our Rhemists
have taught us to English the word Victimae) slain sacrifices of birds and
beasts: Again, they were propitiatory, consecratorie, Eucharisticall, and so
forth, whose kinds and rites Moses has in his books, especially in Leuiticus,
so plainly declared, that I should but power water into the sea, or light a
candle to the Sun, to dilate much of them: these being the same in
signification with the Leuiticall, and little (if little) differing in the
manner of doing. Cain brought his offering, being an husbandman, of the fruit
of the ground, Abel a shepherd, of the fattest of his sheep: God respected
ABEL and his offering, (the tree first, and then the fruit, the worker, and
then the work) which he signified either by voice, or by Hieron. Tradit. Heb.
in Genesis
fire from heaven, according to Theodotions translation, Inflammauit super.
as in the sacrifices of Aaron, Gideon, Manoah, David, Solomon, Elias: or by
some other means, both comfortable to Abel and envied of Cain, who therefore
slew him; thus in this member bruising the heel of that blessed seed, as a
type of that which the head himself should after sustain.

Here is the first Apostasy after that first Evangelical promise, and the
first division of Religion, Cain being the first builder of the Aug. de ciu.
Dei, lib.15.c.5.
Earthly City, not that which he called after the name of his son, Genesis 4.17.
Henoch, but of that spiritual city of the wicked, the seed of the Serpent,
which he founded in his brothers blood: even as that later Compendium thereof,
which calls herself Caput mundi, the head of the world (and indeed John.
17.6.9. 16. etc.
the World is usually in Scripture applied to that seed of the Serpent, as it
is opposed to the seed of the Woman) was by Romulus her first founder by like
example of fratricide in the murder of Remus, dedicated (as it were) to the
future mystery of iniquity, the seat of the Beast, and of the Whore, (by
whose authority, Christ himself was slain) drunken after with the blood of
his Saints: and still breathing blood and slaughter, to every Abel that will
not communicate in her spiritual whoredoms; that will not with her offer the
fruits of the ground (the sacrifice of Cain) which neither came from heaven,
nor can guide to heaven, being earthly, sensual, devilish.

Cain was for this his fact conuented by that All-seeing Justice, who both by
open sentence and inward terrors accused and accursed him, continuing his life,
even for the same cause that other murderers lose it, that he might live an
example (which then in that unpeopled world by his death he could not have
been) to the future generations, branded Some think this mark to be a shaking
of all the body, as fearing continually, Perer.
also by the Lord with some sensible mark, to exempt him, and terrify others,
from that bloody cruelty: this mercy being mixed with this judgment, a
longer time of repentance. God before Gen.3. 17.

shiftlesse remouings; wretched man always bleeding his brothers blood, not
daring to look up to heaven, fearing to look down to hell, the world without

Furies, the harbingers of hell: not able to suffer (which yet he cannot but
suffer) the guilt of passed wickedness gnawing him, the weight of present
misery pressing him, the dread of a death, and a death attending him:
restless in himself, hated of the world, despairing of relief from God: a
lively map of the deadly and damnable state of sin and sinners, (without
Christ) dead whiles they live, moving sepulchers, the Devils captives, hels
heirs, exiled from heaven, and vagabonds on the earth, even on that which they
call their own land.

arm him against others, which his guilty conscience caused him to fear, or
to be a receptacle and storehouse of those spoils, which Josephus says he
robbed from others by violence, when as the earth was barren to him. Philo (if
we may so entitle that Author) which has written of the antiquities of the
Bible, ascribes to him other cities, Mauli, Leed, Tehe, Iesca, Celet, Iebbat,
adding that he lived 730. years. These things may be probable, although that
Author be otherwise fabulous, considering that men did ordinarily live many
hundred years in those times, and were also exceeding fruitful, especially
after that Polygamy was embraced of that family. And if that in Abraham's
posterity the seed of Jacob in less then 300. years was multiplied to so
600000. men of war.

less populous, living in more freedom. He first (says Josephus) found out
weights and measures, and assigned proprieties in possessions of land, before
common as the air and light, and was author to lewd persons, of a lewd and
ungodly life. Probable it is that the city was called Henoch, because the curse
suffered not the father to stay in a place, but to leave a hasty inheritance to
his son to finish and rule it. Iabal and Iubal and Tubalcain, were inuenters of
Arts: the first to dwell in tents and keep cattle; the second of musical
instruments: the third of working in metals, and making of armor, which some
think to be Vulcan; by the neerenesse of name and occupation.

Thus let us leave this family multiplying in numbers, in sciences, in
wickedness, savoring nothing divine, or at least nothing but humane in their
Divinity: (therefore called the sons of men, Genesis 6.I.2.) let us look back to
Adam, who in this wicked fruit of his body might read continual lectures of
repentance for the sin of his soul. Adam begat a child in his own likeness,
that is, not in that likeness of God wherein he was created, but like unto
himself both in humane nature, and natural corruption, his name he called
Seth, of whose posterity the whole world was by Noah repeopled. Unto Seth was
borne Enosh: Then began men says MOSES, to call upon the name of the Lord.
This some Broughton. Concent. Martyr in Genesis
interpret of the beginning of idolatry, that men began to profane the name of
the Lord: some to call the name of the Lord, that is, after Rabbi Salomo, to
apply the name of God to Images, Stars and men: But the more likely opinion is,
that when Adam had obtained a more holy posterity, which was now multiplied in
diverse families, Luther. in Genes. Tremell. Vatablus, Calvin. in Genes. Perer.

Religion which before had bin a private in-mate in Adams household, was now
brought into public exercise. whereof Prayer has always bin accounted a
principal part, and God himself in both Testaments calls his house a house
of prayer; the calves of the lips, and the eiaculations of the heart being the
body and soul of Divine worship, whereof sacrifices were in a manner but the
apparel, fashioned to that infancy of the Church. Of the names of the

CHAP. VII.
Of the cause, and coming of the Flood.

THus we have seen in part the fulfilling of the Prophecy of the seed of the
Woman, and of that other of the Serpent, in the posterity of Cain and Seth. The
family of Cain is first reckoned, and their forwardnes in humane Arts, as Luke
16. 8.
the children of this world are wiser in their generation, in the things of
this life which they almost only attend, then the children of light. As for the
Martyr. in Gen ex Rab. Salom.
Jewish dreams, that Lamech was blind, and by the direction of Tubalcain his
son guiding his hand slew Cain, supposing it had bin a wild beast, which, when
he knew, so enraged him, that he killed his son also, they that list may follow.

Moses reckons the Generations according to the firstborn in the posterity
of Seth, as enjoying the Principality and Priesthood, that so the promised seed
of the Woman (after such a world of years coming into the world) might
justify the stablenes of Gods promises, his lineall descent from Adam with a
due Chronology being declared. After Seth Enosh, Kenan, Mehalaleel, I ared,
was Henoch the seventh from Adam who walked with God whom God took away that
he should not see death. This before the Law, and Helias in the Law, are
witnesses of the resurrection; being miraculously taken from the earth into
heaven, not by death, but by supernatural changing of their bodies. That he
should be still in Bella^. tom 1. coat 3. lib 3. c. 6.
an earthly Paradise, and that he and Elias should come and preach against
Antichrist, and of him be slain, is a Popish dream: the Scripture He^^ 1^. 5.

tradition went from hand to hand, as it seems the whole word of God was
delivered before the days of Moses; God by visions and dreams appearing unto
the Patriarks: or else it was written and since is lost. Some hold it was penned
by some Jew under the name of Enoch. De Ciuit. Dei lib. 15. cap. 23.
Augustine thinks that the book, entitled Enoch, was forged in his name, as
other Writings under the names of Prophets and Apostles: and therefore calls
it Apocripha (as Eo quod earu^ Scripturarum accu^ta origonon clarait patribus.

Pliny was of opinion that letters were eternal.

Howsoever, it is more then apparent, that the book bearing Enochs name, is
very fabulous, which, because the tables therein profess antiquity (although
they were later dreams) I thought it not unfit to borrow out of Not. in Eusebius.

which had been the work of some Jew: the antiquity appears in that Tertull.
de ldololat.
Tertullian cites it. And it came to pass when the sons of men were
multiplied, there were borne to them fair daughters, and the Watchmen (so he
calls the Angels, out of Dan.4.) lusted and went astray after them: and they
said One to another, This fable arose of the false interpretation of Moses
words. Gen.6. 12. The sons of God, etc.
Let us choose us wives of the daughters of men of the earth. And Semixas their
Prince said unto them, I fear vie you will not do this thing, and I alone
shall be debtor of a great sin. And they all answered him and said: We will
all swear with an oath, and will Anathematise or Curse our selves not to alter
this our mind till we have fulfilled it. and they all swear together. These
came down in the days of lared to the top of the hill, Hermon. And they
called the hill, Hermon, because they swear and Anathematised on it. These were
the names of their Rulers, Semixas, Atarcuph, Arachiel, Chabahiel, Orammame,
Ramiel, Sapsich, Zakiel, Balkiel, Azalzel, Pharmaros, Samiel. etc.

These took them wives, and three generations were borne unto them. The first
were great Giants: The Giants begat the Naphehin, to whom were borne Eliud:
And they taught them and their wives sorceries and enchantments. Ezael taught
first to make swords, and weapons for war, and how to work in metals. He
taught to make women's ornaments, and how to look fair, and Iewelling. And
they beguiled the Saints: and much sin was committed on the earth. Other of
them taught the virtues of Roots, Astrology, Diuinations, etc. After these
things the Giants began to eat the flesh of men, and men were diminished: and
the remnant cried to heaven, because of their wickedness, that they might come
in remembrance before him. And the four great Archangels Michael, Gabriel,
Raphael, and Vriel hearing it; looked down on the earth from the holy places
of heaven: and beholding much blood shed on the earth, and all ungodliness and
transgression committed therein, said one to another, That the Spirits and
Souls of men complain, saying, That ye should present our prayer to the
Highest, and our destruction. And the four Archangels entering, said to the
Lord, Thou art God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, etc. Thou see what Exael has
done, he has taught mysteries, and revealed to the world the things in heaven,
etc. Then the Highest said, The Holy one, the Great one spoke and sent Vriel to
the son of Lamech, saying, Go to, Noe, tell him of the end approaching, and a
flould shall destroy the earth, etc. To Raphael, he said, Go Raphael and bind
Exael hand and foot, and cast him into darkness, and open the wilderness in
the desert of Dodoel, and there cast him, and lay upon him sharp stones to the
day of Judgment, etc. And to Gabriel he said, Go Gabriel to the Giants, and
destroy the sons of the Watchmen from the sons of Men, set them one against
another in war and destruction. To Michael he said, Go Michael, bind Semixa
and the others with him that have mixed themselves with the daughters of Men,
(until seventy generations) to the hills of the earth; until the day of their
judgment, till the judgment of the world be finished, and then they shall be
brought into (...)
the confusion of fire, and unto trial, and unto the prison of the ending of
the world, and whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed, from henceforth
shall be cast together with them till the finishing of their generation. etc.
And the Giants which were begotten of the spirits and flesh, they shall call
them evil spirits on the earth, because their dwelling is on the earth. The
spirits that depart out of their bodies shall be evil spirits, because they
were engendered of the Watchmen and Men.

But it were tedious to recite further. The antiquity of it, and because it is
not so common, and especially because Inseph. Antiq. lib. 1. Justin. Tertull.

some of the Ancients, and of the Papists have bin misse-led by these dreams,
(refused justly by Jerome and Augustine) interpreting the sons of God in
Moses to be spoken of Angels (as their Translation did read it) have moved me
to insert those tables. Notable is the diligence of the Purgatory Scauengers,
who in Vines notes upon Aug. de Ciuit. Dei. lib. 15. cap. 23. have in their
Index expurgatorius, set the seal of their Office upon a testimony alleged
out of Eusebius de Praep. Euang. lib. 5. cap. 4. as if they had been Vines own
words, to be left out in the impression. The words, because they savor of the
former error, have I here placed. Non ergo deos, neque bonos daemonaes
Gentiles, sed perniciosos solummodo venerantur. Quam rem magis Plutarchus
confirmat, dicens fabulosas de dijs rations res quasdam significare, a
daemonibus antiquissimis gestas temporibus, and ca quae de gigantibus ac de
Titanibus decantantur, daemonum fuisse operationes. Vnde mihi suspicio (says
Eusebius, but Vines is fined for it) nonnunquam incidit, ne ista illa sint,
quae ante diluuium a gigantibus fact a divine a Scriptura tetigit, de quibus
dicitur: Cum autem vidissent Angels Dei filias hominum, quia essent speciosae,
elegerunt sibi ex illis vxores, ex quibus procreats sunt famosissimi gigantes a
saeculo. Suspicabitur enim fortasse quispiam, illos and illorum spiritus esse
qui ab hominibus postea dij putati sunt, pugnasque illorum, tumultus and bella
esse quae fabulose de dijs conscribebantur. Lactantius lib. 2. cap. 15. says,
that when the world was multiplied, God sent Angels to keep men from the
frauds of the Devil, to whom he forbad all earthly contagion. These were by
the Devil ensnared with women, therefore deprived of heaven: and their
progeny of a middle nature betwixt men and Angels, became unclean spirits: so
that hence grew two kinds of Daemones or devilish spirits; the one heavenly,
the other earthly, which would now seem to be keepers, and are destroyers of
men.

The Angels are sometimes called Job 1.6. and 38.7.
the sons of God: but that name is communicated to men, who Ephesians. 2.3.
by Nature children of wrath, by faith in the natural and only begotten Son
of God, have this prerogative to be the sons of God, and fellow-heires with

to be the sons of God, but Job. 8.44.
do the works of their father the Devil: and of these Hypocrites and
Apostataes, it is said, that loving pleasure more then God, they matched
themselves in Cains family, a provocation so mighty to evil, that strong

the strong men are slain by this weaker sex. This was the Serpents policy
at first, Balaams policy after, Babels policy now; Sheldon in his Motives
observes these marriages to be a great mean for propagating Popery.

children speak half Ashdod, and whilst the father professes one religion,
the mother another, the children become Giants, to fight against all that is
called God, and to make little or no profession (at least in their lives) of
any religion at all.

I deny not that then there were Giants also in regard of bodily stature,
Gibbins in Genes.
whom the Scripture calls, because they were great and fearful, Rephaim and
Emim, of their pride Hanakim, of their strength Gibborim, of their tyranny
Nephilim, of their naughtiness Zamzummim. Such were Og and Goltah after the
flood. Yea such have been in all ages: which (to omit other Ethnike Authors) De
Ciuit. Dei. lib.15. cap. 9.
Augustine affirms, that at Vtica he saw a man's tooth as great as an hundred
of the ordinary sise. Viues on that place, says he saw one as big as a
man's fist. Nicephorus tells of two men in the time of Theodosius, the one not
so admirable for his height which was five cubits and an hand, as the other
for his smalnesse, like to a Partrich in bigness, yet witty and learned. Our
Histories of Giral. Camb. Hector. Boct. Camden Brit.
Arthur, Little John, Curcy Earl of Vlster, and one in our times, 1581. seen
in London, do show some such here and there, now and then in the world, which
Goropius in his Giganto machia, affirms of his own sight: and even whole
families of these monstrous men are found at this day in America, both near to
Virginia, as Map of Virginia.
Captain Smith reports, and especially about the Straits of Magellan,

near which he found Giants, and in the same Straits were such seen of the

Hollanders ten foot in height, where as yet other families were but of the
ordinary greatness. One Thomas Turner told me that near the River of Plate he
saw one twelve foot high, and others whose hinder part of their head was flat,
not round. I^l. Capitol. Herodianus.
Authors tell of Maximinus the Roman Emperor, that he was eight foot and a
finger high, whose wives bracelets might serve him for rings, that he often in
one day drunk an Amphora, which is almost six gallons of wine, and eat forty
pounds of flesh: Cordus says sixty; he could break a horse leg, or strike
out his teeth with a blow of his fist, etc. Which occurrents in Nature no doubt
have given occasion to some of further sabling: Qui de magnis maiora loquuntur.
Plin. lib.7. cap.16.
We read in Pliny of one of forty six cubits, in Crete, found by the force of
an earthquake, breaking the hill wherein he stood, supposed to be Orion or
Otus: more credible is that he tells of one Gabbora in Claudius time, nine
foot and nine inches; and in Augustus time of another half a foot higher.

Howsoever the bodies of these men before the Flood were composed, certain
their minds were disposed to all monstrous inhumanity which hastened their
destruction. This made God to repent that he made man upon the earth, not that
there was any change or repentance in him; but because a change for want of
repentance happened to them. In long sufferance he gave them an hundred and
twenty years space, in which Noah might be a Preacher of righteousness; yea
the Arc it self, which Noah that while was providing, might preach to them
repentance, that their tears might have quenched his wrath, and prevented
temporal drowning, and eternal burning. Adam lived till Henochs time, a
witness and Preacher of the promise he himself had received. Henoch himself
is made, not a verbal, but a real Preacher, whiles his son Methushelah, and
his Nephew Lamech the father of Noah lived: that God might have witnesses to
convert some and convince others. But whiles the world becomes worse and
worse, ( Horat. Carm.
Aetas parentum peior auis tulit Hos nequiores, mox daturos Progeniem
vitiosiorem) a deluge of sin first, and a deluge of judgment after, drowned
the world.

For the circumstances of the Flood Moses has more plainly related them, then
that I should here express them. Noah with his three sons, and their wives,
entered the Arc at Gods appointment, to which by Divine instinct resorted both
birds and beasts; of the clean seven, and of the unclean two in every kind.
If any marvel at this distinction of clean and unclean in these times,
supposing that God first in the wilderness made this partition wall: it is
answered, that God before this had appointed sacrifices of beasts, which might
make the difference, for which cause also there was a seventh of every such
creature, reserved for sacrifice after Noah's going out. Besides, God had now
purposed to add the flesh of beasts unto man's diet, for which those, called by
the Isaelites clean, were most fit, and most in use: and in that respect more
of such kinds were reserved, as more necessary for man's use in food,
clothing, and some of them also for labor. Otherwise No creature is unclean
in it self, the Hoof and Cudde being by Nature (Gods handmaid) and not by
their own vice, such, as made this distinction. And after the Flood God made
no Law of Difference until the time of Moses, although each country has
observed their own peculiar custom in this food, some loathing that which
others esteemed dainty, not for religion, but for natural and civil causes.
As at this; day to the Tartars, Horseflesh is royal sare; to the Arabians,
Camels; to some Americans, Serpents; and other flesh to others: which our
appetite, more then our faith, our stomach, more then our soul; abhors.

Concerning the Arc, diverse doubts have been moved, through curiosity and
vnbelesse, of some, who by divine justice were in a manner deprived of sense
and reason, having before, through devilish wickedness, lost their conscience
and Religion. Thus Orig. bom. in Genes.2.
Apelles one of Marcions disciples, could not find the Arc (after Moses
dimension) to be capable of four Elephants in so small a quantity; Celsus,
contrary to him (yet agreeing in a foolish impiety and impious folly) thought
so great a vessel was too great for man's handy-worke. Thus, like Sampsons
foxes their heads are diverse ways, but they are tied together by the tails,
agreeing in disagreeing both from Moses and themselves.

But might not reason teach Celsus, that the direction of God might teach a man
in an hundred and twenty years space to frame so mighty a Fabrike? does not
sense and experience show buildings not much less both on the sea and on the
land? And what Arithmeticke or Geometry, nay what wit or common sense, had
Apelles in his assertion? The Arc was too little (forsooth) for so many
creatures and their provision for a year. We need not seek for shifts from
help of the Geometrical cubite known to Moses in his Egyptian learning, of
three, six or nine foot to the cubite; as Origin and Hugo de Arca Noae, lib.
1.
Hugo do: nor of the sacred cubite, imagined twice as much as the common: nor
of the larger stature and cubits of of men in those youthful times and age of
the world. The length whereof three hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty, do
make of square measure by common rules of Art, fifteen thousand cubits. Three
floores or rooms were therein of that quantity, each containing ten foot in
height. As for the beasts; a floor of fifteen thousand cubits might yield
fifty cubits seuare to three hundred several kinds, many more then are
known by relation of the most Writers, Aristotle, Pliny, Gesner, etc. which
scarce reckon half that number, and but forty kinds or thereabouts, that
would take up any great room. The height might yield commodious rooms for the
fowls on perches: and all this might one room or floor afford. Judge then
whether two other rooms, of equal bigness, might not be sufficient for all
other necessary employments? Besides, the roof is not to be thought
unproportionable, fitted for so long and tempestuous storms, and therefore not
unfitted with room for diverse necessaries. And if any accuse me for adding
this of the roof to Moses description, I say that so it is translated by
Tremel. and Iunins.
some, Et in cubits longitudinens consummato eius tectum suporne, understanding
those words not of the window (as many do) but of the roof it self, which
else is no where described, which should ouer-hang the Arc a cubite breadth,
to defend it the safer from raines; as in our houses the eues and slope roofes
are commodious both for room within, and against the weather without. But if
any would entertain longer dispute about this, he may (among others that have
handled this question) resort unto Beccesel. Antiq. Antuerp.
Goropius Becanus his Gigantomachia, whom in this point I would rather follow,
then in many other his Becceselanicall paradoxes.

Noah and his family with this their retinue being entered, the fountains of
the great deepes were opened, and the windows of Heaven: the two storehouses
of waters which God had separated in the Creation, being in a manner confounded
again, the Seas breaking their sandy bars, and breaking up by secret
underminings the privy pores and passages in the earth: the clouds conspiring
with the waters, and renewing their first league and natural amity, to the
confusion of Nature and the World. The heavenly lights hid their faces from
beholding it, and clothed themselves with black, as bewailing the worlds
funeral; the air is turned into a sea, the sea possesses the airie region,
the earth is now no earth but a mirielumpe, and all that huger world is
contracted into a brife Epitome, and small abridgement in the Arc, even there
but a few inches distant from death. Thus do all Romans 8. 20.
Creatures detest Sin which has made them subject to Vanity; thus would the
Elements wash themselves clean from it, and the committers thereof: but the
Arc prevails over the prevailing waters, a figure of the Church, the remnant
of the elder, and Seminary of the new World.

This drowning of the world has not been quite drowned in the world, but
besides Moses, many other writers have mentioned it: the time thereof being
referred to that which in each Nation was accounted most ancient; as among the
Thebans to Ogiges; in Thessalia, to Deucalion; among the Americans (although De
Fab. Mundi.
Mercator think that the Flood drowned not those parts, because they were not
yet peopled, and because the beasts there are most-what differing kinds from
these in our world) the people have retained the tradition hereof: Mnaseus
among the Phoenicians, Berosus a Chaldaean, Hieronimus Aegyptius, Nicolaus of
Damascus, the Poets Greek and Latin, adding fables to the truth (which
without some ground of truth they could not have added) all mention the Flood;
howsoever confounding the less and later with this first and universal.

I might add the testimonies of Eupolemus, Molon, Abidenus, Alexander
Polyhistor, out of Eusebius, Josephus, and others. Lucian in his Dea Syria,
tells the opinion of the Hierapolitans but a little corrupted from Moses
Narration: that Country wherein Noah lived, most likely retaining firmer
memory of this miracle: so plainly does he attribute to his Deucalion the
Arc, the resort and safeguard of the Lions, Bores, Serpents, and Beasts: the
repairing of the World after the drowning thereof, which he ascribes to
perjury, cruelty, and other abominations of the former people. That Berosus,
which we now have, is not so much as the ghost, or carcass, and scarce a few
bones of the carcass of that famous Chaldean Author, mentioned by the
Ancients, but the dreams of Annius, (no new thing in this last age) coined for
the most part in his name. Some fragments of Berosus we have cited in other
Authors that convince this Bastard.

Among others, somewhat of the Flood has escaped drowning: his testimony
whereof, set down in Polyhistor and Abidenus, is in Eusebius. Chron. Grac.
Scasig. lib 1 and de Praepar. lib. 9.
Eusebius. He affirms that Saturn gave warning to Sisuthrus of this deluge,
and willed him to prepare a great vessel or ship, wherein to put convenient
food, and to save himself and his kindred, and acquaintance, which he builded
of length five furlongs, of breadth two. After the retiring of the waters, he
sent out a bird which returned: after a few days he sent her forth again,
which returned with her feet bemired: and being sent the third time, came no
more: with other things to like purpose, which Polyhistor there, and Abidenus,
cites out of Berosus. Plut arch has also written of this Dove, sent out by
Dencalion. Plut. de animantium comparatione.

Goropius after his wont paradoxicall, holds it to be the hill Paropanisus,
or Paropamisus, a part of the hill Taurus (improperly ascribed to Caucasus,

the earth, called now, M.Paul.Ven

He imagined, that the place first inhabited after the Flood was Margiana,
whence those Colonies passed that with Nunrod built Babylon. His reason is,
because Genes. 11. 2.
they went from the East to the Plain of Shinar, whereas Armenia bears
somewhat Eastward from thence. As though that journey had been presently after
the Flood, which was an hundred years after: in which space it is likely that
they followed the Mountainous countries Eastward a long time, and from Assyria
Adiabena, turned back into that fertile Plain, where pride, fullness of
bread, and abundance ofidlenesse, set them on work against GOD. I hold it not
meet, that a few conjectures should counterpoise the general consent of all
ages. Josephus says, the place in Armenia was called Apobaterion, of this
their going forth of the Arc: and alleges Berosus testimony, that a part of
this Arc was then said to remain in the Cordyaean (or Gordyaean) hills, the
pitch whereof some scraping away, wore the same for Amulets. And out of Nich.
Damascenus, lib. 96; There is (says he) above the region of the Minyae, a
great hill in Armenia, by name Baris, wherein, they say, many saved themselves
in the time of the Flood, and one, brought in an Arc, there stayed (the
remnants of the wood thereof continuing there long time after) which happily
was he that Moses the Jewish Lawgiver writ of. This mountain or mountainous

there is one high mountain called Lubar, which signifies the descending place
(Lubar in the Armenian and Egyptian language signifying the same that (...)
before mentioned) and the word Baris before cited out of Damascenus seems to
be corruptly written for Lubaris.

The Armenians through all ages have (as it seems) reserved the memory
hereof: and even Cartwrights Travels.
in our days there stands an Abbey of Saint Gregory's Monks near to this
hill, which was able to receive The Persian King.
Shaugh Thamas and a great part of his army. These Monks, if any list to
believe them, say that there remains yet some part of the Arc, kept by
Angels: which, if any seek to ascend, carry them back as far in the night,
as they have climbed in the day. Cartwright, an eyewitness, says that this
hill is always covered with snow; at the foot thereof issue a thousand
springs; there are adjoining three hundred Villages of the Armenians. He says
also that there are seen many ruinous foundations supposed to be the works
of this first people, that a long time durst not adventure into the lower
countries for fear of another Flood. In Chron. Graec. Eusebij and praeparat.
Euang. lib. 9. cap. 4.
Abidenus says, that the Ship or Arc was still in Armenia (in his time) and
that the people used the wood thereof against many diseases with marvelous
effect.

After that Noah had obtained his deliverance, and was now gone out of the
Arc; his first care was Religion: and therefore he Genes. 8. ^0.
built an Altar to the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every
clean foul, and offered burnt offerings upon the Altar. And the Lord smelled
a favor of rest, and renewed the ancient blessings and promises to Noah and his
Posterity. The living creatures were also permitted to their food, and
submitted to their rule, by whom they had in the Arc escaped drowning. Only
the blood was prohibited to them, as a ceremonial observation to instruct them
in lenity and hatred of cruelty: the political ordinance being annexed
touching the blood of man, against man or beast that should shed the same. This
difference being Gibbins in Genes. 9. Cic. dc ^inilib. 2.
alleged of the life of man and beast, that the life of the beast is his
blood, the life of man is in his blood. Not that the blood which we see shed is
the life of the beast; for that is properly, Cruor, not Sanguis, that is, the
matter, whose form was the life or vital spirit, which being separated from
the body, is severed also from the form of life. And the life of beasts has
no other form but that which is united with the blood, as the life of trees is
the sap of trees; their blood being (as it were) their soul. But Vt sit
pecndum anim a qualitativa, homi^num vero substantiua. Aquin. Sanguis
vchicuculum animae Aristot. de Genesis animal. lib. 3.
the life of man is in his blood, having his seat therein, living when it is
by death separated from the blood; mean while the Spirits being the purest
part of the blood, as conduites conueying life to the bodily members, and as
firm bands of a middle nature, between the body and soul, uniting them
together; which bands and carriages being broken by effusion of blood, the
soul subsisteth a spiritual substance without the body, not subject to
substantial corruption or mortality.

God did also make a covenant for man with the beasts of the field, infusing
into the nature of all things, a dread and fear of man, whereby they fear the
power, the snares, and sleights of man, and therefore flee or else submit
themselves, not by that willing instinct, as to Adam in innocence, but rather
with a servile fear. And although by hunger or provocation, or fear of their
own danger, they sometimes rebel, yet otherwise there remains some
impression of this natural decree in them, as experience in all places has
showed. Even the Lion, king of forests and savage creatures, does not easily
give onset, but on such occasions: yea the Moors meeting with this beast, do
rate and braule at him; this magnanimous beast passing by with a leering
countenance, expressing a mixed passion of dread and disdain, fearing the voice
of one, that fears not the weapons of many, which himself, by the terror of
his voice, makes the beasts to tremble. Hereunto the Lord adds the Rainbow,
a new sacrament, to seal his merciful Covenant with the earth, not to drown
the same any more; which yet at last shall be burnt with fire, so to purge the
heavens and earth of that vanity, whereto man's sin has subjected them. And
thus much do Gregor. Maz^nios homil. 8. in Ezech. Melanc. Come.

no such creature, but that then this use of the creature was ordained. The
reflection or refraction of the Sunne-beames in a waterie cloud, the brightness
from the Sun and from the cloud meeting together, the variety of colors
proceeding from the variety of matter; the furnish and drier part of the
cloud yielding a purplish, the watery a greenish sea-colour etc. borrowing the
roundnes from the Sun half eclipsed by the shadow of the Earth, are
accounted the natural causes of this wonder of Nature; sometime also by reason
of abundance of matter, the same being doubled, one Bow within the other,
their colors placed contrary, for that the one is the image (by reflection)
of the other. Neither is it to be thought, that there was no Rainebowe before
the Flood, any more than that there was no water, bread or wine before the
institution of our Christian Sacraments, which name and dignity, not Nature,
but Use, by the appointment of the GOD of Nature and Grace does give unto them.
For not in the clouds alone is this Bows to be seen, but as further witness
of the maturall causes and constitution thereof, the same, effect may be showed
by concurrence of like causes in the waters and rocks where Rivers have their
falls; yea on the buildings of men: as I my self have seen a perfect
Rainebowe by the reflection of the Sunne-beames on a boarded wall of a
Water-mill, the boardes thereof being very wet with the fall of the water, and
opposite to the Sun.

The sons of Noah were Sem (which because of Divine privilege, from whose
loins Christ was to come according to the flesh) is first named Ham or Cham,
and Iapheth, who seems (as lunius and alij. Pererius contra lib. 15. in Genesis
learned men gather by the Genesis 10.21.
text) to be the eldest. Fabulous Methodius, contrary to Moses, speaks of an
other son Ionithus after the Flood, whereas the Genes. 9.19.
Scripture says, That of those three all the Earth was replenished.

To show directly which Nations descended of each of these three, were a hard
task: and now after this confusion of Nations by wars, leagues, and otherwise,
impossible. But for the first beginnings of Nations, before that Colonies were
by violence of Conquerours, or by themselves, in their exceeding multiplying,
voluntarily translated from one place to another, they are by Moses faithfully
related, although the confusion of Languages and of peoples do make the matter
hard and harsh to us. Yet the names of Nations in the Greek Stories do in
great part agree with the names of these first Patriarchs, as master
Broughtons Concent.
Broughton has showed, by laying down the names of Noah's house, which,
vnvowelled, may admit sundry pronouncings, setting against them such names as
heathen Authors have mentioned. Out of him, and Arias Montanus his Phaleg, and
others, what I thought likeliest, I have here inserted. Iapheth, Iapetus:
Gomer, or after the Septuagint Gamer: Camaritae Cimmerij, and Cimbri. Joseph.
Ant. l. 1. Trem. and Iun. An.
Josephus says, That the inhabitants of Galatia were of Gomer sometime called
Gomarae. Camd.Brit.
Master Camden deriueth the ancient Galls and Britans from this Gomer: the
name which they give to themselves to this day implying the same, which is
Kumero, Cymro, and Kumeri, a British or Welsh woman Kumeraes, and their
language Kumeraeg.

Magog Massagetae and Getae.
Magog is supposed the father of the Scythians, before (says Josephus) called
Magoges, Ezekiel. 38.2. and 39.6. who after inuading those parts, left the name
Magog to Hierapolis in Syria: Plin lib. 5. c. 23. Of Madai came the Medes, of
Iauan the Jones or Grecians. Of Thubal the Iberians, called sometime (says
Josephus) Thobeli. The Iberians, says Montanus, dwelt near to Meotis:
certain colonies of them inhabited Spain, and called it Hiberia, and
themselves Hiberians: whence the Spaniards have a report, that Thubal was the
first peopler of their country. The Cappadocians were called Meschini of
Meshech, whose city Mazaca was named of Meshech, since by Tiberius named
Caesarea, where Basil was Bishop. Hence was named Moschicus mons, and Moschos,
and the Moscouites.

From Thiras came the Thracians. The name Tros may cause men to ascribe the
Trojans to this beginning. Of the sons of Gomer, Aschenaz was Author of the
nations in Asia, Pontus, and Bithynia, where was the lake and river Ascanius, a
proper name also of men in those parts: the Axine or Euxine Sea: the Ascanian
Island, and Ascania in Phrygia. Of Riphath came the Paphlagonians, sometimes
called the Riphathaei, says Josephus: and the Riphaean hills in the North: the
Amazonians were also called Aeorpatae in Herod. Melpom. The Arimphei near to
the Riphean hills.

Thogarma gave name to the inhabitants of Armenia Minor, whose Kings, called
Tygranes, and Towns Tygranokartae, witness it: some also attribute the Turks
or Turkeman Nation to this name and author. These peopled Asia first, and from
thence by degrees these parts of Europe: Of Togarma, Africanus deriueth the
Armenians.

Of Iauans children, Elisha founded the Aeoles, called also Aelisei of Tarshish
came the Cilicians, whose mother-citie was Tarsus, Paul's birthplace. Montanus
thinks that Tharsis was Carthage in Africa, which the Poeni after possessed:
some refer the Venetians to Tharsis also. Cittim was an other part of
Cilicia. The Cretans (after Montanus) were called Chetim, and of others
Cortini, of whom the Italian coast called Magna Graecia was inhabited, and the
city Caieta, builded. Of Dodanim came the Dorians and Rhodians. These peopled
the North and West parts of the World in Asia and Europe.

Chams posterity was Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan: These possessed the South
of Asia, and Africa. Of Cham is the name Chemmis in Aegipt; and Ammon the Idol
and Oracle so notorious. Cush gave name to the Aethiopians and Arabians known
in Scripture by that name. Mizraim, to the Egyptians, even at this day so
called in their own and the Arabian tongues. Put, to the Libyans, sometime
called Phuthaei: the river Fut is mentioned by lib. 5. ca 1.
Pliny not far from Atlas. The Canaanites I need not mention: Moses plainly
describes them.

Of the sons of Cush, Seba Author of the inhabitants of Arabia deserta, Ps.
72.10. or after Montanus Sabaea regio thurifera. Chauila is a name more
forgotten, supposed to be Author of a people near the Persian Gulf. Sabtha
Stabeisuper sinum Persie. and Messabathae ex ijs oriundi. Arias Montanus.
Sabbesta left the name to the inhabitants of Arabia Faelix, where was the city
Sabbatha with threescore temples therein. Other people of Arabia Faelix came of
Raeamah, where Ptolomaeus places Regama: the Garamantes also in Libya.
Sabitheca was Author of the Sachalitae in Arabia Faelix. Nimrod -- the son of
Cush, some think to be Zoroastres some Belus.

Misraim begat Ludim, the inhabitants of Maraeotica praefectura in Egypt:
Anamim, the Cyreneans: and Lehabim, the Libyans: and Naphtuhim the Aethiopians
near to Egypt, whose town Napata is mentioned in Ptolomey: Pathrusim the
Pharusians, Casluhim, at the entrance of Egypt, Cassiotis. Montanus
interprets Ludim the Libyans; Ghananim, the Troglodytes; Lehabim, the
Cyrenaikes; Naphthuhim, Africa the less; Chasluhim the Saracens; Caphthorins,
the Cappadocians.

To Shems posterity befell the parts of Asia from Iudaea eastward.

Shems sons were Elam, the father of the Elamites, in the higher part of
Persia: Ashur, of whom came the Assyrians: Arphaxad: the Cadusians or the
Chaldeans are (with little likeness of sound) ascribed to him. Lud is holden
father of the Lydians: and Aram of the Syrians, called also Aramaei; others of
Aarm derive Armenia.

Arams sons were Vz, of whom the region Ausanitis was named Chul, of whom
Cholle seems to have his appellation in the Palmyrene deserts near to
Euphrates. Gether; Josephus ascribes to him Bactria; others that part of Syria
where Gnidar stood. Atergate and Derceto that notorious Syrian goddess;
happily borrowed the name hence: Of Mash is the name Masius, part of the hill
Amanus: Montanus says, of Mes Mis^', and Misia, whom Invenal calls Mesos --
de grege Mesorum.

Ioktan begat Elmodad, of whom the hill Emodus may seem named: of Shalah the
Sclebij and Sariphi: of Hatzarmaveth, the Sarmatians: of Iarach, the
Arachosians: of Hadoram, the Orites, people of India: of Vzal or Auxal, Auzakea
a city in Scythia, and the river Oxus: of Diklah (after Arias Montanus)
Scythia intra Imaum, the reason I see not in the name: of Obal or Ghobal, the
Cabolites, people of Paropanisus: of Abimael, Imaus: of Sheba, the Sabae which
Eustathius places in India, or according to Montanus, the Sacae: of Ophir,
some think called Aurea Chersonesus, where Pegu and Malacca now are: Montanus
thinks it to be Peru: Chanilah has not left so plain impression behind.
Montanus ascribes to him India. Of Iobab, Arias Montanus coniectureth Parias
in the West Indies to have come, but with little probability which I can see.
And of the most before named we have probable conjectures, not certain
proofs, as appears by the difference of opinions of Authors concerning them.
Neither may we think that Moses intended so much a Geographicall History of
all the Nations of the World, many of which were not, long after his time,
planted or peopled; but of the first Fathers, who peopled the places by
degrees, as they increased in multitude which were nearest that Armenian
center: and especially he relates and dilateth of them, whom it most concerned
the Israelites to know, as the Canaanites, whose bounds and nations are exactly
described. I could add much touching the several Nations descending of these
three brethren, and the bounds of their habitations, in which Africanus
sometime took profitable pains; and Eusebius out of him, although both be in
this part lost: somewhat has been barbarously translated into Latin by an
unknown Author, for the foloecismes, tedious; for the substance of history
profitable to the Reader: and therefore by Scaliger in his edition of Eusebius
communicated to the world. But the uncertainty Pererius, Opmerus, and other
Comme^ters on Genes. and Chronologians, have done somewhat in this argument,
which yet as in many we see much probability, so very much is exceeding
doubtful of that they say.
makes me unwilling to proceed in this argument further.

Of this uncertainty no greater cause can be alleged, then the division and
confusion of Tongues, the history whereof Moses declares. For whereas God had
given to man two Privileges and principal prerogatives, whereof other
creatures are no way capable, his inward Retione and oratione differunt bomines
a bestijs.
Reason, and ability to utter the same by Speech: this benefit of God in
Nature was turned into a conspiracy against God and Nature. They said one to
another, Genes.^ 1. 2, 3
Come, let us make brick for stone, and slime had they instead of mortar. Also
they said, let us build us a City and Tower, whose top may reach unto the
heaven, that we may get us a name, lest we be scattered upon the whole earth.
This was their vain arrogance and presumption, that when their guilty
consciences threatened a dissipation and scattering by divine Justice: they
would thus harten and harden themselves against God and Man: in stead of
thankfulness to God, and honoring his name, they would win themselves a
name and honor: in stead of preventing punishment by repentance, they would in
this Giant-like fighting against God prevent future judgments. But even that,
by which they intended to keep them from scattering, was the true and first
cause of their scattering. So does God scatter the counsels of his enemies,
and takes the wise in their craftiness. Babel or confusion is always the
attendant of Pride. Sibylla, alleged by Ant.li. 1. ca. 4.
Josephus, testifies of this confusion of Tongues in these words. When all men
before used one speech, they erected a high Tower, as if they would ascend to
Heaven, but the Gods by tempests overthrew their Tower, and gave to each of them
several Languages, whereof the city was named Babylon. According to that of
Moses, Genes. 11. 9.
Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because the Lord did there confound
the language of all the earth. From thence then did the Lord scatter them upon
all the Earth. The Atheists and Naturalists dream the world to be eternal,
and conceive that all men could not be of one; because of this diversity of
languages. If such had been at Jerusalem, and heard the Apostles (not the
expertest men in their own vulgar) speak all Languages: they might then have
seen the like powerin a contrary effect to this of Babylon. Man's sin caused
this, Gods mercy that the one came from Babylon, the other from Jerusalem,
that old Jerusalem giving a taste and earnest of that, which the new Jerusalem
shall once fully accomplish, when all shall be made new, all shall become one, and
God shall be all in all. It appears that these Builders lost the understanding
of their own speech, and were endued with other language, whereto their
Understandings and Tongues were framed, in stead of that former.

What this former Language was, has bin doubted, either of ignorance or of
curiosity and self-loue. Theodor. q. 59. in Genesis esteems Syrian the first
language and that Hebrew began with Moses, taught him by God as a sacred
language. Herodot. li. 2.
Psammetichus K. of Egypt caused two children to be closely brought up by a
shepherd, who should at times put Goats to them to give them suck, without
ever hearing humane voice. After two years they uttered the word Bec Bec,
which was the voice that they had heard of their nurses the Goats, but not so
interpreted by Psammetichus; for he enquiring in what language Bec was
significant, and hearing that the Phrygians so called Bread, ascribed to them
the prioritie of all nations and languages. Melabdim Echebar the great Relat.
Regn. Mogor. loan. Orani.
Mogor (as the Jesuits Epistles declare) made the like trial of thirty
children, whom he caused, without hearing of man, to be brought up, setting
Guards to observe the Nurses that they should not speak to them: purposing to
be of that Religion whereto they should addict themselves. But neither could
they ever speak, or would he ever addict himself to one certain Religion.
Indoscyth.
Goropini by a few Dutch Etymologies grew into conceit, and would have the
world believe him, that Dutch was the first language; which if it were, we
English should reign with them, as a Colony of that Dutch City, a stream
from that fountain, by commerce and conquests since manifoldly mixed. But his
evidence is too weak, his authority too new.

common and more received opinion, is, that the Hebrew was the first, confirmed
also by universality, antiquity, and consent of the Christian Fathers and
learned men, grounding themselves upon this reason, That all the names,
mentioned in Scripture before the Division, are in that Language only
significant: besides, it is not like, that Shem conspired with these
Babylonians, and therefore not partaker of their punishment. Now it is very
probable, and almost manifest, that he was See Broughton on that argument.
Genebrard. Chron. Genesis 10. 21.
the same which after is called Melchisedesh, King of Salem; betwixt whom and
Abraham, in that familiarity, it is not likely, that there was much dissonance
in Language. He is also called the father of all the sons of Heber, by a
peculiar propriety, although he had other sons, because the purity of
Religion and Language remained in Hebers posterity. And why should Heber call
his son Peleg (Division) but of this division which then happened? The Nation
and Language of Israel borrow their name (Hebrew) of him. And if it had
happened to himself, why should he, more then other, have so named his son?

CHAP. IX.
A Geographicall Narration of the whole Earth in general, and more
particularly of ASIA.

WE have all this time been viewing one Nation, which alone was known in the
Earth, until confusion of Language caused division of Lands; and have taken
notice of the Heads and Authors of those Peoples and Nations, that from that
time were scattered over the World, and after settled in their proper
Habitations. We have not followed the opinion of some, both of the Augustine.
Hierom. Arrzobius. Epiphan. Broughton etc.
Ancients, and later Writers, in defining the number of Nations and Languages
through the World, reckoned by them 72. For who sees not, that Moses in that
tenth of Genesis is most careful to describe the posterity and bounds of
Canaan, which GOD had given to Israel, which it were absurd to think in so
small a territory to be of so many (that is, eleven) several Languages? And
how many Nations were founded after that by Abraham's posterity (not to mention
so many other Fountains of Peoples) by the sons of Hagar, and Ketura, and
Esau the son of Isaac? Neither could the World so suddenly be peopled: and of
that, which then was peopled, Moses writing a History of and for the Church,
so far mentions the Affairs and Nations of the world, as it was meet for
the Church (and specially that Church of the Israelites) to know, according as
it was likely they should have then, or after, more or less to do with them.
Excerpta barbaro-Latina apud los. Scalig. Eusebium
Africanus has reckoned the 72 by name. But how easy were it in these days
to set down 72 more, of differing Nations, both in Region and Language; and
how little of the World was then known, shall presently be showed. Besides, it
may be a question, whether diverse of those, there mentioned, did not speak the
same Language (as in Chaldaea, Syria, and Canaan) Gibbins in Genesis 11.
with some diversity of a Dialect, a little more then in our Northern,
Western, and Southern English: Which may appear, both by the pilgrimages of
the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in those parts (which had needed new
interpreters, by that rule, in every two or three days travel, except
themselves had been almost miraculoussy skilful in Languages) and by the
Chaldaean and Syrian Monuments and Books, which some observe to come nigh to
the Hebrew. 'D.Willet in Dan.c. 1. q. 25. reproves Philo's opinion, That the
Chalde and Hebrew was all one, because Dantel. an Hebrew, was set to learn the
Chalde: or that the Syrian and Chalde, according to Mercerus opinion, was the
same: yet grants, that in the first times the Syrian and Chalde little differed.
Perhaps it was with these three Languages, as with the Frankes See Wolfgang.

original) Dutch.
French; or the Saxon and the present English: for there were no less
mutations and transmutations, by times and wars, in those parts the^ in
these. It seems therefore probable, that at the first division of Languages,
they that most disagreed, did furthest separate themselves, and they that spoke
either the same, or near in likeness to the same speech, observed the same
neighborhood of Nation, as of speech; which, the names and words of the
Phenician, Syrian, Persian, Arabian, and Egyptian Languages, testify. The
division of Tongues was about a hundred years after the Flood, An. Mundi 1757.
as Caluisius and Buntingus account.

Now that we have spoken of the first Authors of the principal and first
Nations, let us survey their Lands and Inheritance, which GOD gave unto them,
which was the habitable Earth. This Earth, together with the Waters, make
one-Globe and huge Ball, resting on it self, supported by the Almighty hand
of GOD, to the roundnesse whereof, the high Mountains, in comparison of the
whole, can be small impediments, and are but as a few motes or dust sticking to
a ball. Possidonius, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, Pliny, Ptolomey, and others,
skillful in Geographie, have endeavored by Art to find out the true quantity
hereof: and although there appear difference in their sums, yet that is
imputed rather to the diversity of their furlongs, which some reckoned longer
then others, then to their differing opinions. But never had they so certain
intelligence of the quantity of the Earth, as in our times, by the Nauigations
of F. Magellanes
Spaniards, F. Drake. T. Cauend ^sh^.
English, and Oliver Noort.
Dutch, round about the same, is given us; Art and Experience consulting, and
conspiring together, to perfect the Science of Geographie. For whereas the
Ancients divided the World into three parts, Asia, Africa, and Europe, and yet
neither knew the East and North parts of Asia, nor the South of Africa, nor the
most Northerly parts of Europe: not only these three are by Land and Sea far
more fully discovered, but also A. Maginus Geog.
three other parts, no less (if not much greater) then the former, are added
to them; namely, America Mexicana, and America Peruviana, and Terra Australis,
or the Land lying toward the South pole. As for the seventh part, which some
reckon under the North Pole, because we have no relation but Market. Tab.
Universal.
from a Magician, a Friar of Oxford, called Nicholas de Linna, which might with
as good conscience lie to us, as by ArtMagicke take view of those Parts
(otherwise it is not certainly known, whether it be joining to Asia, or
whether it be Land or Sea) I therefore leave it out in this division.

Europe is divided from Afric by the Mediterranean Sea; from Asia by the
Aegean and Euxine, Maeotis, Tanais, and a line from the fountains thereof
Northwards: on the North and West parts washed with the Ocean; which running by
the straits of Gibraltar, flows along the Coasts of Afric to the Cape of
Good Hope, and thence passes all along on the East side thereof into the
Arabian Gulf, where, by a Neck of Land, it is encountered: This Neck, the
Mediterranean, and Ocean, do limit the bounds of Africa: The rest of the old
World is Asia. America Mexicana, or North, and the South called Peruviana, are
severed by the narrow Straits of Dariene, in other places compassed by the Sea:
The South Continent is very little known, and contains the rest of the
World, not bounded in the former limits. But in their particular places we
shall hear of each of them more fully.

It cannot be without some great work of God, thus in the old and decrepit Age
of the World, to let it have more perfect knowledge of it self; which we
hope, and pray, may be for the further enlargement of the Kingdom of CHRIST
JESUS, and propagation of his Gospel. And, as in former times, in those
thendiscouered Parts, the Jews were scattered, some violently, some willingly,
through Asia, Africa, and Europe, to usher the Gospel into those Parts, and
make way for that which the most of themselves rejected: who knows, whether
in the secret dispensation of Divine Providence, which is a co-worker in every
work, able even out of evil to bring good, the Donations of Popes, the
Nauigations of Papists, the preaching of Friars and Jesuits may be
forerunners of a further and truer manifestation of the Gospel, to the
newfound Nations? For even already it is one good step of an Atheist and
Infidel to become a Proselyte, although with some soil: and again, the
Jesuits there cannot play the Statesmen, as in these parts, yea Iesuitarum
Epistole. Thus did Fr. K^uier, and the rest of them.
(themselves in their relations being witnesses) they rather take the
Evangelical courses of those, which here they count heretics, and by laying
open men's sin through the fall, and divine justice, only by Christ
satisfied, do beat down infidelity with diligent Catechisings: although upon
that golden foundation they build afterward their own Hay and Stubble, with
their rack of Confession, and rabble of Ceremonies, and (the most dangerous to
new Conuerts) an exchanged Polytheisme in worshipping of Saints, Images, and
the Host. But if God shall once show mercy to Spain, to make them truly
Catholic, and, as a divine Inquisitor, condemn that deuillish Inquisition to
perpetual exile, how great a window may be that means be opened unto this new
World for their conversion and reformation? And why may not the English
Expedition and Plantation in Virginia, and the Nauigations of other
Protestants, help this way, if men respected not their own Pride, Ambition
and Covetousness, more then the truth and glory of God? But he that by
Fishers converted the old World, and turned the wisdom of the World into
foolishness, subdued Scepters by preaching the Cross, yea, by suffering it in
himself and in his members: is able of those stones to raise up children to
Abraham, and that by the mouth of Babes and Snoklings, by weakest means, when
it pleases him. Let us therefore pray the Lord of the Harvest to send forth
Laborers into these wide and spacious fields ripe thereunto.

But to return to our parts of the World, whence this meditation has
withdrawn me. The ancient Lege Ortelii Aevi ^teris descrip. and Maris pacifici.
Geographers were ignorant of a great part of that threefold division: as
appears by their own Writings. The use of the Loadstone, found out by John
Go^a of Melsi, an Italian (or, as P. Bellonii obseru. l. 2. c. 16.
Bellonius observes, by one Flanius, but Albertus Magnus was the first that
writ of the nature of it) was a great and necessary help to further
Discoueries, especially after that Henry, son of John the first, King of
Portugal, Bar. dec. 1. l. 1. Asia Osorius de Reb. Ema. l. 1. Maffus, l. I.

began to make voyages of discovery upon the Coast of Africa, and John the
second seconded that Enterprise, and used the help of Mathematicians, Roderigo
and Joseph his Physicians, and Martin Bohemus, by whom the Astrolabe was
applied to the Art of Navigations, and benefit of the Mariner, before used only
in Astronomy. This John also sent men of purpose into Arabia and Aethiopia,
and other Countries of the East, to learn further knowledge thereof. From
these beginnings, daily increasing, has Navigations (first in Portugal, and by
degrees in other Europaean Nations) by the help of Astronomicall rules grown
to her present perfection, and by it, Geographie. And if the longitude of
places might as easily be found out as the latitude, which our countreyman
Master Linton made Complement of the Art of Nau.
promise of, we should yet grow to better knowledge in those Sciences, and of
the World by them. Moreover, as the Expedition of Alexander, and those
flourishing, Monarchies in Asia, brought some knowledge thereof to the
Ancients: So the Histories of later times, but specially the great Travels by
Land of Marcus Panlus, Odoricus, Will. de Rubruquis, Ioannes de Plano Carpini,
our Countreyman Mandeuile, and others, before this skill of Navigations, have
given much light to the knowledge of the inland Countries of Asia, which we
are first to speak of.

As for the Circles, the Aequinoctiall, which parts the Globe in the midst,
the Tropickes of Cancer and Capricorn 23. degrees and a half from either side
of the Aequinoctiall, the Arctike and Antarctike Circles 23. degrees and a
half from the North and South Poles, or not much differing (which are usually
set in Mappes with red or double lines, for distinction:) The Meridians, which
are Circles passing over our heads, in what part of the World soever we be, and
also through both the Poles: the Horizon, which divides the upper half of the
World which we see, from the nether half which we see not: the Paralels of
Latitude, which the old Cosmographers make (says Blundeuile) but 21, from the
Aequinoctiall to the North, and as many on the other side toward the South, but
now the P. Merula.
Modern make them up 39: The Climes or Climates, which are the spaces betwixt
two Paralels: Also the terms of Poles, which are two, the Arctike, and the
Antarctike; and the Axletree of the World (a right line imagined to pass from
the one to the other, through the Center of the Earth:) the Degrees, containing
60. miles (or after Cornelius de Iuddis, 68095 paces, which is a greater sum
then the former) into 90 of which degrees every fourth part of the world is
divided, and amount in the whole to 360. Also the Geographicall terms of
Littus, Fretum, Insula, Sinus, Continens, Promontorium, Isthmus, that is,
Shores, Straites, Islands, Bays, Continent, Capes, or Head-lands, Necks of
Land, and such like: All these (I say) and other things of like nature,
needful to this kind of knowledge, the studious shall find in those Authors
which teach the Principles of Astronomy and Geographie, as Master Blundeuile,
and others.

My intent is not to teach Geographie, but to bestow on the studious of
Geographie, a History of the World, so to give him meat unto his bones, and
use unto his Theorie or Speculation, whereby both that skill may be confirmed,
and a further and more excellent obtained. Geographie without History seems
a carcass without life and motion: History without Geographie moves, but in
moving wandreth as a vagrant, without certain habitation. And whereas Time and
Place are twins and inseperable companions, in the chief Histories to set
down the true time of chief Accidents, will add much light to both; a great
task in one Country: but to take up the whole World on my shoulder, which
have not the strength either of Atlas or Hercules to bear it; and in the whole
to observe the description of Places, order of Times, and the History of
Actions and Accidents, especially Religions ( olli robur and aes triplex,
thrice happy he that could happily atchieue it) I confess beyond my ability
exactly to perform; but with the wisest, I hope that the haughtiness of the
Attempt, in a thing so full of variety and hardness, shall rather purchase
pardon to my slippes, then blame for my rashness. And how can I but often
slip, that make a perambulation over the World, that see with others eyes, that
tell of matters past so many Ages before I had a being? Yet such is the
necessity of such a History, either thus, or not at all. But as near as I
can, I purpose to follow the best evidence, and to propound the Truth: my fault
(where it is worst) shall be rather mendacia dicere, then mentiri, and yet the
Tales-man shall be set by the Tale, the Authors name annexed to his History,
to shield me from that imputation.

And first we must begin with ASIA, to which the first place is due, as being
the place of the first Men, first Religion, first Cities, Empires, Arts: where
the most things mentioned in Scripture, were done; the place where Paradise was
seated; the Arc rested; the Law was given; and whence the Gospel proceeded:
the Place which did bear Him in his flesh, that by his Word bears up all
things.

Asia (after A Maginus, ^ At^^^^r. Iud. ^^^^^^ Abr. Ortel. and alij.
some) is so called of Asia, the daughter of Oceanus and Thetis; which was wife
to Iapetus mother of Prometheus: Others fetch this name from Asius the son of
Manaeus; both with like certainty and credit. It is greater then Europe and
Africa: yea, the Islands thereof are larger, if they were put together, then
all Europe. It is compassed with the Eastern, Indian, and Scythian, Oceans, on
three parts: on the West it has the Arabian Gulf, that neck of Land which
divides it from Africa, the Mediterranean, Aegean, Pontike Seas, the Lake
Maeotis, Tanais, with an imagined line from thence to the Bay of S. Nicholas.
Some make it yet larger, and make Nilus to divide it from Africa, but with
less reason. Taurus divides it in the midst: On the North side is that
which is called Asia interior: on the South is Asia exterior. More unequal is
that division into Asia the greater and the less, this being less indeed,
then that it should sustain a member in that division. Io. Barrius divides it
into nine parts, Ortelius into five, Maginus into seven, which are these:
First, That part of Tartaria betwixt Muscouia, the Northern Ocean, the River
Ob, and the Lake Kytai, and a line thence drawn to the Caspian Sea, and that
Isthmus which is betwixt that and the Pontike Sea: secondly, the great Chams
Country, from thence to the Eastern Sea, between the frozen Sea and the
Caspian: thirdly, That which is subject to the Turk, all from Sarmatia and
Tartaria Southwards, between Tigris and the Mediterrannean Sea: fourthly, The
Persian Kingdom, between the Turk, Tartar, India, and the Red Sea: fifthly,
India, within and beyond Ganges, from Indus to Cantan: sixthly, The Kingdom of
China: seventhly, The Islands. These divisions are not so exact as may be
wished, because of that variety and uncertainty in those Kingdoms. Many
things does Asia yield, not elsewhere to be had; Myrrh, Frankincense,
Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Pepper, Musk, and other like, besides the
chiefest Jewels. It has also minerals of all sorts: It nourishes Elephants,
Camels, and many other Beasts, Serpents, Fowls, wild and tame, as in the
ensuing discourse, in their due places, shall appear; yet does it not nourish
such monstrous shapes of men as fabulous Antiquity fained. It brought forth
that Monster of irreligion, Mahomet; whose Sect, in diverse Sects, it fostereth
with long continuance of manifold Superstitions. It has now those great
Empires of the Turk, Persian, Mogore, Cathayan, Chinois: it had sometimes the
Parthian, and before that, the Persian, Median, Assyrian, Scythian: and first
(as it seems) before them all, the Babylonian Empire under Nimrod, which is
therefore in the next place to be spoken of.

CHAP. X.
Of Babylonia, the original of Idolatry: and the Chaldaeans Antiquities
before the Flood, as BEROSVS has reported them.

COnfusion caused division of Nations, Regions, and Religions. Of this
confusion (whereof is already spoken) the City, and thereof this Country,
took the name. Plin. l. 5. c.12.
Pliny makes it a part of Syria, which he extends from hence to Cilicia.
Strab. l.16.
Strabo adds, as far as the Pontike Sea. But it is usually reckoned an
entire country of it self, which Ptol. Geograe. l.5.c.20.
Ptolomey does thus bound. On the North it has Mesopotamia, on the West Arabia
Deserta; Susiana on the East; on the South, part of Arabia, and the Persian
Gulf. Luke ( Act.7.21) makes Babylonia a part of Mesopotamia: Ptolomey more
strictly divides them: whereunto also agrees the interpretation of the Land
of Shinar, that it was the lower part of Mesopotamia, containing Chaldaea and
Babylon, lying under the Mount Sangara. D Willet in Dan. cap.1.9.15. In this
Country was built the first City which we read of after the Flood, by the
ungrateful world, moved thereunto (as some think) by Nimrod, the son of
Cush, nephew of Cham. For as Cains posterity, before the Flood, were called
the Sons of Men, as more sauouring the things of men then of God; more
industrious in humane inventions, then religious devotions: so by Noah's Curse
it may appear, and by the Nations that descended of him, that Cham was the
first Author, after the Flood, of irreligion. Neither is it likely, that he
which derided his old father, whom Age, Hobnesse, Fatherhood. Benefits, and
thrice greatest Function of Monarchy, Priesthood, and Prophecy, should have
taught him to reverence: That he (I say) which at once could break all these
bonds and chains of Nature and Humanity, would be held with any bonds of
Religion; or could have an eye of Faith to see him which is invisible, having
put out his eyes of Reason and Cimlitie. Had he feared God, had he reverenced
man, had he made but profession of these things in some hypocritical show, he
could not so easily have sitten down at ease in that Chair of Scorning,
whence we read not that ever he arose by repentance. From this Cham came
Nimrod, Gen.10.9.
the mighty hunter before the Lord; not of innocent beasts, but of men,
compelling them to his subjection, although Noah and Sim were yet alive, with
many other Patriarchs.

As for Noah, the fabling Heathen, it is like, deified him. The Berosus of
fabling Annius, calls him Father of the Gods, Heaven, Chaos, the Soul of the
World. Ianus his double face might seem to have arisen hence, of Noah's
experience of both Ages, before and after the Flood. The fable of Saturnes
filius Coeli, cui sub^ic^t virilia.
Saturnes cutting off his fathers priulties might take beginning of that act,
for which Cham was cursed. Sem is supposed to be that Melchisedech King of
Salem, the figure of our Lord, and the propagator of true Religion; although
even in his posterity it failed, in which, Abraham's father, as witnesses
Josh.24.2.
Joshua served other Gods. Iaphets piety causes us to persuade our selves
good things of him; Cham and his posterity we see the authors of ruin. Philo
de Antiq. Method. Revel.
Philo and Methodius (so are the two books called, but falsely) tell, That in
these days they began to divine by Stars, and to sacrifice their children by
Fire; which Element Nimrod compelled men to worship: and that to leave a name
to posterity, they engraued their names in the brickes wherewith Babel was
builded. Abram refusing to communicate with them (and good cause, for The
building of Babel was An. Mund. 1757. and Abraham was born An. 1948.
he was not yet borne) was cast into their Brick-kill, and came out (long after
from his mothers womb) without harm. Nahor, Lot, and other his fellows, nine
in number, saved themselves by flight. Chronic. before the Bible.
Others add, That Arane, Abrams brother, was done to death for refusing to
worship the Fire. Qui Bauium non odit, amet tua carmina Maeni.

To come to truer and more certain reports, Moses says, That Gen.10.9.
the beginning of Nimrods Kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calne
which three some interpret Edessa, Nisibis, Callinisum. And whereas commonly
it is translated in the next words, Out of that land came Ashur, and built
Niniue. Tremellius and Iunius read it, Out of this land he (Nimrod) went into
Ashur or Assyria, and built Niniue and Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen. But Ar.
Montanus. Melanctbon Chron. Gramay. Asia.
most usually this is understood of Ashur the son of Sem; who disclaiming
Nimrods tyranny, built Niniue, which after became the chief City of the
Assyrian Empire, to which Babylon it self was subjected not long after.
Xenophon de Aequivocis (if his authority be current) says, That the eldest of
the chief Families were called Saturni, their fathers had to name Coelum,
their wives Rhea: and out of a pillar, erected by Semiramis to Ninus, alleges
this inscription; My father was Jupiter Belus, my grandfather Saturnus
Babylonicus, my great grandfather Saturnus Aethiops, who was son of Saturnus
Aegyptius; to whom Coelus Phoenix Ogyges was father. Ogyges is interpreted
Noah, therefore called Phoenix, because of his habitation (as is thought) in
Phoenicia, not far from whence, in Jerusalem, Sem reigned; Saturnus Aegyptius
may be the name of Cham, of whose name Egypt is in Scripture termed Ps.78.51.
the land of Cham. Saturnus Aethiops is Chush; Nimrod Babylonicus, the father
of Belus, who begat Ninus. But this cannot be altogether true. For Niniue has
greater antiquity then Nimrods nephew (howsoever the Greek Histories ascribe
this to Ninus, and Babylon to his wife Semiramis) except we say, that by them
these two Cities, formerly built, were enlarged and erected to that
magnificence, which with the growth of the Assyrian Empire they after obtained.

Chron. Gr. Edit. Scal. page 9. and 13.
Eusebius in the first book of his Chronicle attributes the original of
Idolatry to Serug the father of Nahor. Bed. Chronic.
Beda says, In the days of Pbaleg Temples were built, and the Princes of
Nations adored for Gods. The same has Isidore. Epiphan. can. her. l.1. in
initio.
Epiphanius refers it to Serug; and adds, That they had not graven Images
of Wood or Metal, but pictures of men; and Thara, the father of Abraham, was
the first Author of Images. The like has Suidas. These times, till Abram, they
called Scythismus. The reason of their Idolatry Eusebius alleges: That they
thus kept remembrance of their Warriors, Rulers, and such as had achieved
noblest Enterprises and worthiest Exploits in their life time. Their
posterity, ignorant of that their scope (which was, to observe their memorials
which had been authors of good things, and because they were their
forefathers) worshipped them as heavenly Deities, and sacrificed to them. Of
their (...)
God-making or Canonization this was the manner: In their sacred Books or
Kalendars they ordained, That their names should be written after their death,
and a Feast should be solemnized according to the same time, saying, That their
souls were gone to the Isles of the blessed, and that they were no longer
condemned or burned with fire. These things lasted to the days of Thara; who
(says Suidas) was an Imagemaker, and propounded his Images (made of diverse
matter) as Gods to be worshipped: but Abram broke his fathers Images. From
Sarueh the Author, and this Practice, Idolatry passed to other Nations: Suidas
adds, specially into Greece: for they worshipped Hellen, a Giant of the
posterity of Iapheth, a partner in the building of the Tower.

Not unlike to this, we read the causes of Idolatry in the book of Wisdom
ca. 14.14.
Wisdom (supposed to be written by Philo, but, because the substance is
Salomons, professing and bearing his name) which of all the Apocrypha-Scripture
sustaineth least exception, attaineth highest commendation: When a father
mourned grievously for his son that was taken away suddenly, he made an Image
for him that was once dead, whom now he worshippeth as a God, and ordained to
his servants Ceremonies and Sacrifices. A second cause he alleges, viz. the
tyranny of men, whose Images they made and honored, that they might by all
means flatter him that was absent as though he had been present. A third
reason follows: the ambitious skill of the workman, that through the beauty
of the work the multitude being allured, took him for a God, which a little
before was honored but as a man. The like affirms Polid. lib. 1. dt
inuentorio.
Polydore de inuentoribus, alleging Cyprian de Idolis for his author. Lactant.
li. 4. ca. 28.
Lactantius (as before is showed) makes that the Etymology of the word
Superstitio, Quia superstitem memoriam defunctorum colebant, aut quia
parentibus suis superstites celebrabant imagines little doms, tanquam Deos
penates: either because they honored with such worship the suruiuing memory of
their dead ancestors; or because suruiuing and out-liuing their ancestors, they
celebrated their Images in their houses, as householdGods. Such authors of new
rites, and deifiers of Omnia idola ex mortuorum errore creueru^t. Hier. in Hos.
2.
dead men they called Superstitious: but those which followed the
publikely-receiued and ancient Deities, were called Religious, according to
that verse of Virgil. Vana superstitio veterumque ignara deoru^. But by this
rule (says Lactant.) we shall find all superstitious which worship false Gods,
and them only religious, which worship the one and true GOD. The same Lib. 2.
c. 14.
Lactant. says, That Noah cast off his son Cham for his wickedness, and
expelled him. He abode in that part of the earth which now is called Arabia,
called (says he) of his name Canaan, and his posterity Canaanites. This was
the first people which was ignorant of GOD, because their founder and Prince
received not of his father the worship of GOD. But first of all other the
Egyptians began to behold and adore the heavenly bodies: And because they were
not covered with houses for the temperature of the air, and that Region is not
subject to Clouds, they observed the motions and eclipses of the stars, and
whiles they often viewed them more curiously, fell to worship them. After that,
they inverted the monstrous shapes of Beasts, which they worshipped. Other men
scattered through the World, admiring the Elements, the Heaven, Sun, Land,
Sea, without any Images and Temples worshipped them, and sacrificed to them sub
dio, till in process of time they erected Temples and Images to their most
puissant Kings, and ordained unto them Sacrifices and Incense: so wandering
from the knowledge of the true GOD, they became Gentilos. Thus far
Lactantius. And it is not unlike that they performed this to their Kings,
either Bullinger de orig. erroris li. 1. ca. 9.
in flattery, or fear of their power, or because of the benefits which they
received from them, this being (says Plin. l. 34. c. 4.
Pliny) the most ancient kind of thankfulness, to reckon their benefactors
among the Gods. To which accords De Not. D. l. 2.
Cicero in the examples of Hercules, Castor, Pollux, Aesculapius, Liber,
Romulus. And thus the Moors deified their Kings, and the Romans their deceased
Emperors.

The first that is named to have set up Images, and worship to the dead, was
Ambros. in epist. ad Roman. cap. 1.
Ninus, who when his father Some think, and with probable coniectture, that
Belus was Nimrod.
Belus was dead, he made an Image to him, and gave privilege of sanctuary to
all offe^ders that resorted to this Image: whereupon, moved with a graceless
gratefulness, they performed thereunto divine honors. And this example was
practiced after by others. And thus of Bell or Belus began this Imagerie, and
for this cause (says Lyra. in Sap. 14. Petr. Come. Hist. c. 40.
Lyra) they called their Idols Bell, Baal, Beel-zebub, according to the
diversity of Languages. Cyril. l. 3. cont. Julian.
Cyrillus calls him Arbelus, and says, That before the Flood was no
Idolatry amongst men, but it had beginning after in Babylon, in which, Arbelus
(next after whom reigned Ninus) was worshipped. Tertullian Tertal. de idol.
out of the book of Enoch, before mentioned, is of opinion, That Idolatry was
before the Flood. Thus to continue the memory of mortal men, and in
admiration of the immortal heavenly Lights, together with the tyranny of
Princes, and policies of the Priests, began this worshipping of the creature,
with the contempt of the Creator: which how they increased, by the mysteries of
their Philosophers, the fabling of their Poets, the ambition of Potentates, the
Superstition of the Vulgar, the gainefull Collusion of their Priests, the
Cunning of Artificers, and above all, the Malice of the Devils, worshipped in
those Idols, their giving Answers and Oracles, and receiving Sacrifices, the
Oenomaus out of ^^esiod affi^^ ^th the number of Gods in the world to be 30000:
which number he says was then much increased. Eusebius. de preparat. l. 5. c. 15.
Histories of all Nations are ample witnesses. And this Roman Babylon, now
Tyrant of the West, is the heir of elder Babylon (sometimes Lady of the East)
in these devotions, that then and still Babylon might be the mother of
Whoredoms and all Abominations. To which aptly agree the Paralels of Babylon
and Rome in O cf. l. 2. c. 2, 3.
Orosius, the Empire of the one ceasing, when the other began first to have a
being; which he further prosecuteth in many particulars.

But before we prosecute these Babylonian affairs after the Flood, it shall
not be amiss to show here the Chaldaean fables of Antiquities before the
Flood, out of Berosus, a Chaldaean Priest, which lived in the time of
Alexander. Polyhistor Polyhist in Eus. Chron.
cites out of Berosus his first Book this report of himself; and Tatianus
Tatianus apud Scalig.
says he was the Priest of Belus, and wrote his Chaldaean story to
Antiochus, the third after Seleucus, in three books. His name by Scaligers
interpretation signifies the son of Osee.

Alorus reigned the space of ten Sari (Sarus with them is three thousand six
hundred years) Alasparus, three Sari; Amelus, thirteen Sari; Amenus, twelve;
Metalarus, eighteen; Daorus, ten; Aedorachus, eighteen; Amphis, ten;
Otiartes, eight; Xixnthrus eighteen: in his time, as is said before, the Flood
happened. The whole space is an hundred and twenty Sari, which amounts to
four hundred thirty two thousand years. This I thought not unfit (although
incredible) to report from Berosus, both because my scope is to declare as well
false as true Religions (it being not Theological but Historical, or rather
Historically Theological) and because the Ancients, Cicero, Lactantius,
Augustine: have mentioned this monstrous Computation of the Chaldaean Calendar,
which yet they rack higher to four hundred threescore and ten thousand
years. Here you have the particulars, out of Apollodorus and Abidenus, which
both borrowed them of Berosus. Fragmenta hec e^ ^^^ in Chron. gr. Eusebius. l. I.
per Scalig.
Polyhistor adds, That there came one out of the red Sea, called Oannes, and
Annedotus a Monster (otherwhere like a fish, his head, feet, and hands like a
man, as says Photius but Al. Polyhistor ascribes two heads, one of a Fish,
and the other of a man) the Image whereof was unto his times reserved. This
Monster lived without meat, and taught them the knowledge of Letters, and all
Arts, buildings of Cities, foundations of Temples, enacting of Laws,
Geometry, and Husbandry, and all necessaries to man's life. Afterward he
returned to the Sea: and after him appeared other such monsters. Four of them
came out of the Sea, says Abidenus, when Daos (whom Apollodorus calls
Daorus) reigned; their names were Enedocus, Eneugamus, Enaboulus, Anementus.
Pentabiblus (it seems) was then their chief City. That Oannes the first did
write of the first beginning: That all was darkness and water, in which lived
monstrous creatures, having two forms; men with two wings, and some with
four; with one body, two heads, one of a man, and another of a woman, with
the priuities of both sexes: others with horns and legs like Goats; some
with Horse feet; some like Centaures, the former part Men, the after part
Horses: Bulls also headed like Men, and Dogs with four bodies etc. with many
monstrous mixtures and confusions of creatures, whose Images were kept in the
Temple of Belus. Over all these ruled a woman, named Omorka, which signifies
the Sea, and by like signification of Letters, the Moon. Then came Belus and
cut her in twain, and made the one half of her Land, the other Heaven, and
the creatures therein appeared. This Belus made Men and Beasts, the Sun,
Moon, and Planets: These things reports Berosus in his first book; in the
second he tells of the Kings (before mentioned) which reigned till the flood.
After the flood also the same Polyhistor out of him shows, That Sisuthrus
having, by Saturns warning before, built an Arc (as is before said) and laid
up all monuments of Antiquity in Sipparis, a City dedicated to the Sun, and
now with all his world of creatures escaped the flood, going out of the Arc
did sacrifice to the Gods, and was never seen more. But they heard a voice out
of the air giving the^ this precept, to be religious. His wife, daughter, and
shipmaster were partakers with him of this honor. He said unto them, the
Country where they now were was Armenia, and he would come again to Babylon,
and that it was ordained, that from Sipparis they should receive letters, and
communicate the same to men: which they accordingly did. For having sacrificed
to the gods, they went to Babylon and dug out the (...)
letters, writings, or books, and building many Cities, and founding Temples,
did again repair Babylon. Thus far out of Alexander Polyhistor, a large
fragment of the true Berosus.

CHAP. XI.
Of the City and Country of Babylon: their sumptuous walls, Temples and
Images.

Leaving these Antiquities, rotten with age, let us come to take better view of
this stately City. Herodot. l. 2. Philostrat. devita Apollon.l. I.C. 18. Plin.
lib 6.c.26.and Solinus e.60. report concerning the compass of Babylon, That
the walls contained 480. furlongs, situate in a large plain, four square,
environed with a broad and deep ditch full of water: Diodor.l.3. c.4. says,
That there were but so many furlongs as are days in the year, so that every
day a furlong of the wall was built, and 1300000. workmen employed therein.
Strabo Libr.16.
ascribes to the compass 380. furlongs: and Curtius l.5.358 (ninety furlongs
thereof inhabited, the rest allotted to tylth and husbandry.) Concerning the
thicknes of the walls, or the height, they also disagree. The first Authors
affirm the height 200, cubits, the thickness 50. They which say least, cut
off half that sum. Politic.l.3.t.^
Well might Aristotle esteem it a country rather than a city: and, not without
cause, was it reckoned among the wonders of the world. It had 100. brazen
gates, and 250. towers. It was indeed a mother of wonders: so many miracles of
Art accompanied the same, the works partly of Semiramis, partly of
Nabuchodonosor: which I would desire the Reader to stay his hasty pace, and
take notice of. Every where I shall not, I can not, be so tedious in these
kinds of relations. Diodor.lib.3. (or after the Greek l.2. c.4.) thus adds of
Semiramis; She built also a bridge of five furlongs. The walls were made of
brick and asphaltum, a slimy kind of pitch which that country yields. She
built two palaces, which might serve both for ornament and defense; one in the
west, which environed sixty furlongs; with high brick walls: within that a
less, and within that also a less circuit which contains the tower. These
were wrought sumptuously with images of beasts, and therein also was game and
hunting of beasts: this had 3. gates. The other in the east, on the other side
the river, contained but 30. furlongs. In the lower country of Babylonia she
made a great square lake containing 200. furlongs: the walls where of were of
brick, and that pitchy mortar; the depth. thirty five foot. In the midst of
the City she erected a Temple to Jupiter Belus (says Herodotus lib.2.) with
brazen gates (now in his time remaining) four square: each square containing
two ^^^^^, a furlong is six hundred foot
. furlongs, in the midst whereof is a solid tower of the height and thicknes of
a furlong: upon this another, and so one higher then another, eight in number.
In the highest tower is a chapel, and therein a fair bed covered, and a
table of gold, without any Image. Neither, as the Chaldaean Priests affirm,
does any abide here in the night, but one woman, whom this God shall appoint.
They say the God himself there lies. In regard of this exceeding height,
Diodorus affirms, that the Chaldaeans did thereon make their observations of
the Stars. He also adds, that Semiramis placed in the top three golden
statues: one of Jupiter forty foot long, weighing a thousand Babylonian
talents; till his time remaining: an other of Ops, weighing as much, sitting in
a golden throne, and at her feet two lions, and just by, huge serpents of
silver, each of 30. talents: the third Image was of Inno standing, in weight
800.talents. Her right hand held the head of a serpent, her left, a scepter of
stone. To all these was common, 1 table of gold 40 foot long, in breadth 12, in
weight 50 talents. There were also two standing Cups of thirty talents, and
two vessels for perfume of like value: Three other vessels of gold, whereof
one, dedicated to Jupiter, weighed twelve hundred Babylonian talents: (every
Babylonian talent is said to contain seven thousand dram Atticae, sixty
three pounds, nine ounces, and an half, and half a quarter Troy weight.) All
these the Persian Kings took away.

Without the Temple, by Herodotus testimony, was a golden Altar, and an other
huge one besides, for their solemn sacrifices, the other being not to be
polluted with blood, except of sucking things. In that greater the Chaldaeans
burnt yearly in their sacrifices a hundred thousand talents of Libanotus. One
statue of gold twelve cubits high 'Darius, affecting, spared: but Xerxes both
took it, and slew the priest that forbade him. I might here also tell of
those Pensile gardens, borne up on arches, four square, each square containing
4. hundred foot: filled on the roof with earth, wherein grew great trees and
other plants. The entrance was (as it were) a hill: the arches were builded one
upon another in convenient height, still increasing as they ascended: the
highest which bare the walls were fifty cubits high, and twelve in breadth:
There were within these arches, Innes. There was also a conueyance of water to
the watering thereof. This garden was made long after Semiramis time by Arege
Syro. Diod.
a king which herein seemed to lord it over the Elements and countermaund
Nature, being himself the servant of his wives appetite, who in this lowly
valley wherein Babylon stood, would feign have some representation of her own
hilly and mountainous country of Media.

This King was Nabuchodonosor, as witnesses Beros.fragm. apud Joseph. contra
Appian. lib. 1.
Berosus in Josephus, who having conquered Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia,
enriched the Temple of Belus with the spoils, and added a new city to the
old, without the same. And providing that the enemy might not after turn the
course of the river, and approach to the city, he compassed the inner city with
three walls, and the utter city with as many, these of brick, those also with
bitumen, or pitchie slime of that country, adding thereunto stately gates. And
near his fathers palace he built another more sumptuous: and this he did in
fifteen days. Therein he raised stone-works like unto mountains, and planted
the same with all manner of trees. He made also a pensile garden. Many more
things (says Josephus) does Berosus add, and blames the Greek Writers for
ascribing the building of Babylon to Semiramis an Assyrian. This fragment of
Berosus cited by Josephus, does well serve us to clear both the holy and
profane History. In the one, Daniel Dan. 4.27.
induces Nabuchodonosor walking in his royal palace in Babel, with words
answerable to his pride, Is not this great Babel that I have builded for the
house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my
majesty? His words (even in the speaking) were written in the Book of God,
and an enditement thereof framed in the highest Court; where he was adjudged
presently the loss of Reason, which he had thus abused, Till he knew that the
most High bare rule over the kingdom of men, giving the same to whom soever he
will. Well might he say he had built it, in regard of this new city and
palace, with other miracles thereof: with more truth then some Expositors,
which accuse him herein of a lie, for arrogating that which Semiramis did.

And for Semiramis, profane histories generally make her the founder of this
City, and among others Pseudo Beros.lib. 5.
Annius his Berosus, who (contrary to this fragment of the true Berosus in
Josephus) says, that Semiramis made Babylon of a town, a great City, that she
might be rather esteemed the builder thereof, then enlarger. Nimrod had before
built the Tower, but not finished it, and did not Nec designatam vrbem
sundauit. lib. 4.
found the city, which he had designed and set out, and Belus his son had
Fundamenta designata Babyloniae, oppidi magis quamvrbis, crexit.
erected those designed foundations rather of the town then the city Babylon.
Moses testifies that at the first building, they were (by confusion of
language) forced to cease their work, Genesis 11.8. leaving a name of their
shame, instead of that renown and name, which they had promised to themselves.
It may be that Semiramis did amplify this: and happily so did other Assyrian
and Babylonian kings, as Augustine and Abydenus affirm; Hanc quidam putant
condidisse Babylon, quam quidem potuit instaurare, August. de ciuitate Dei
li.18. ca.2. likewise Abydenus in Eusebius. Praep.lib.9. says, that the walls
being by inundation fallen, were built again by Nabuchodonosor, and agrees in
other things with Berosus.

But the Graecians are children, in comparison of ancient History, and little
of this matter can we affirm on their testimony; their first Historian
Herodotus living long after this age in the time of the Persian monarchy.
Howsoever, Nabuchodonosor is he which (by divine and humane testimony) there
established that golden head of the Image, the seat of the Babylonian
monarchy, raising it to that high top of worldly excellence. Yea Daniel cha.3.
speaks of one more sumptuous Image, then any mentioned by Herodotus and
Diodorus set up by this king threescore cubits high, and six broad, enioyning a
Catholic and universal idolatry thereunto, which the three Saints Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego refused, and in a fiery trial, were found both Martyrs
and Confessors.

Strab.lib. 15.
Strabo out of Megasthenes (whom Aunius has set out as truly as he has done
Berosus, save that he stutted at the name, and called him Metasthenes Anny.
Metasthenes) says of this King whom he names Nabocodrosor, more esteemed of
the Chaldaeans then Hercules, that he came in his expeditions as far as the
Pillars of Hercules (the straights of Gibraltar) and as far as Tearcon the
Ethiopian, and that he conducted an army out of Iberia into Thracia, and
Pontus. This Tearcon is he whom the Scripture calls Tirhaka, which warred
against Senacherib.

2.Kings 19.9.
But to return to our pensile gardens, which Diodorus and Curtius attribute to
a Syrian King (which was no other but this Conqueror of Syria, Nabuchodonosor)
and both they and Strabo do at large describe and account among the worlds
wonders, as were also the bridge and the walls of the city. And no less
wonderful was that Obeliske, or needle: a square stone made spire-fashion, cut
by Semiramis out of the mountains of Armenia, one hundred and fifty foot long,
and four and twenty thick, on many waines brought to the river, thence to
Babylon, and there erected. Pliny testifies, that the Temple of Belus still
remained in his days: and that Belus was inuentor of Astronomy. This Temple
was the same with the Sepulcher of Belus, which Strabo says was rased by
Xerxes: yet not so, but that Alexander would have repaired it; but in regard
that it asked so much labor and time (for only the cleansing of the earth
required ten thousand men two months work) he was not able to finish that
which he had begun. In the Description he says less then Herodotus, that it
was a Pyramid or spire-worke a furlong or six hundred foot in height, and
each of the four squares containing as much. Arrianus Arrian de rebus gestis
Alexand.lib.3.
affirms that Alexander had the same of other Temples also. The Temples,
says he, which Xerxes had overthrown, he commanded to be repaired, and among
them the Temple of Belus, whom the Babylonians with singular Religion worship.
Ar.lib.7.
At his return homewards, Belus in thankfulness (it seems) sent his
Chaldaean Priests to meet him, and forbid him to enter the city, as he loved
his life, whose oracle Alexander contemning, there ended his days. The cause
why he listened not to them, is thought a mistrust that he conceived of the
Chaldaeans. For whereas Xerxes, at his return out of Greece, had rased this
and all other sacred places of the Babylonians: Alexander minding the repair
hereof, having already removed the rubbish, thought with his whole army to
atchieue this enterprise. But the revenue which the Kings of Assyria had left
for the maintenance of this Temple-sacrifices, after the overthrow thereof, was
shared among the Chaldaeans; which they by this attempt were like to loose, and
therefore were willing to want his presence.

This Temple some suppose to be that Tower of Babel mentioned by Moses Genesis 11.
and supposed still in part to remain. For about seven or eight miles from
Bagdat, as men pass from Felugia a town on Euphrates, whereon old Babylon
stood, to this new city on Tigris (a work of eighteen hours, and about
forty miles space) there is seen a ruinous shape of a shapelesse heap and
building, in circuit less then a mile, (some say, but a quarter of a mile)
about the height of the stone-worke on Paul's steeple in London: the brickes
being six inches thick, eight broad, and a foot long (as master Allen
measured) with mattes of Canes laid betwixt them, yet remaining as sound, as if
they had been laid within a years space. Thus master Eldred, and master
Fitch, master Cartwright also, and my friend master Allen, by testimony of
their own eyes, have reported. But I can scarce think it to be that Tower or
Temple, because Authors place it in the midst of old Babylon, and near
Euphrates: although I will not contend about it. Some affirm, ( Verst^ga^
Antiq.
I know not with what truth) that Nimrods Tower was in height five thousand one
hundred seventy and four paces. But it is now, as we see, come to confusion.
Also there is yet beyond Tigris some ruins of a Temple, which is called the
Temple of Bell, with high iron gates, as is reported.

Dominicus Niger Dom Nig. Asia Com. 4.
has these words: Seleucia in process of time has changed her state and her
site. For it was on the western bank of Tigris, which a Cut from Euphrates
slowed into; in which place are now seen the ruins thereof, where the
shepherds have erected them cottages: and on the Eastern bank have the
Barbarians built the City and called it Bachdad, right ouer-against the old. If
this be true, vain is the conceit of credulous Travelers, which suppose those
ruins to be the monuments of Babylons burial, and confound again this later
world, with the reports of Babels Tower.

The Bitumen or slimie pitch which they used in stead of mortar in their
building, is, as Dominicus Niger Dom Nig. Asia Com. 4.
out of Trogus reports, common in those parts. Herodotus tells, that eight
days journey from Babylon was another City, named IS, with a small rill of
the same name, which runs into Euphrates, carrying thither (as tribute) much
of this slimie matter. Niger mentions one place, where out of a clift or
opening of the earth proceeds such a stink, that it kills the birds which
fly over it. And at this day, two days journey from Bagdat R.^itche.Hak.
Voy.to.3.
at a place called Ait, is a mouth continually throwing forth boiling pitch,
therefore by the Moors called Hel-mouth, which runs into a great field
always full thereof: and herewith they pitch their boats. The water, as my
friend master Allen (who lived in Bagdat diverse months) told me, is warm and
accounted medicinable, for which cause he has drunk largely thereof: the
liquid pitch floateth on the top of the water, like clouted cream, to use
his own phrase.

The Country of Babylonia has been the most fruitful in the world,
Hero.lib.2.
yielding ordinarily two hundred, and in some places three hundred increase:
the blades of the wheat and barley about four fingers broad. Plinn et. hist.
lib.18.ca.17.
Pliny, somewhat otherwise: They cut (says he) or mow their corn twice, and
feed it a third time in Babylonia, otherwise it would be nothing but blade: and
yet so their barrener land yields fifty, their best an hundred increase.
Tigris and Euphrates ouerflow it, but bring not fatness to the soil, as Nilus
in Egypt, but rather cleanse that superfluous fatness which naturally it has.

The soil is of a rosennie clay, says master Allen, and would still retain
in likelihood his ancient fertility, if it were watered with like diligent
husbandry: In digging it yields corrupt waters, sauouring of that pitchy
slime. In the ancient Babylon, it seems that in every garden of any citizen
of sort were rilles made out of the river. The ruins from the tower aforesaid
to Bagdat (which some call Babylon) and beyond on the other side of the river,
contain twenty two miles, yet to be seen: which happily are the ruins, not
of old Babylon, so much, as of the neighbor towns here built, Seleucia,
Vologesocerta, and Ctesiphon: which I rather think, because they reach beyond
Tigris as well as on this side.

To return to the religious places in Babylon: Caelius Rhodig. lect.
Antiq.lib.8. ca. 12. tells, that in the Temple of Apollo, was found a golden
Chest of great antiquity, which being broken by some accident, thence issued a
pestilent vapor, that infected not those alone which were present, but the
neighboring Nations, as far as Parthia, Ammianus Marcellinus Ammian.l.23
has the like History of the Image of Apollo Chomens at Seleucia, which was
brought to Rome, and there placed by the Priests in the temple of Apollo
Palatinus: and whenas a certain hole which the Chaldaean Wisemen had by Art
stopped, through the covetousness of certain soldiers breaking in thither
for spoil, was broken up, the world was thence poisoned with a contagion from
Persia, as far as France. Philost. de ^ita Apol.lib. I. cap 18.
Philostratus tells of Apollonius, that he saw at Babylon such stately Palaces,
as scarce agree with the state of Babylon in the time of Apollonius, which was
while Domician reigned: amongst other things he saw Galleries full of Greek
Images, as of Orpheus, Andromeda, etc. He came also into a Gallery, the roof
whereof was made bowing like the heavens, and covered with Sapphire, so to
resemble Heaven, and the Images of their Gods, made of gold, were there set.
From the roof there hanged four birds of gold, representing the Goddess of
Revenge, which they called the tongues of the Gods, I know not by what art or
mystery, admonishing the King not to exalt himself.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Priests, Sacrifices, religious Rites, and customs of the Babylonians.

THe Chaldeans (says Dio. Sic.l. 3. cap. 8.
Diodorus) were of reputation in Babylon, as the Priests in Egypt: Chaldaean,
being a name sometime applied to the whole Nation; sometime appropriated to the
Priests, who spent their whole time in religious services, and in Astrology.
Many of them by Divination foretold things to come, as we have showed before in
the History of Alexander; and the book of Daniel witnesses this their
profession. By their auguries, or divination by birds, by sacrifices and
enchantments, they were accounted to do good or harm to mankind. They were
most expert in their sacred Rites, in the knowledge whereof they were brought
up from their childhood; and continued in that course of learning all their
lives, the child being instructed in his fathers science. They professed the
interpretation of dreams, and prodigious accidents in Nature. Their opinions
were, That the world is eternal, without beginning and end: the order and
furniture of all was done by divine providence: all heavenly things were
perfected, not by chance, or of their own accord, but by the determinate and
firm decree of the Gods. By long observation searching the course and nature
of the Stars, they foretold things to come. But the greatest Power they
attributed to the five Planets, and especially to Saturn. They call them
Mercuries, because when others are fixed, these have their proper motion, and
show future things, as the Interpreters of the Gods, by their rising, setting,
and color. Under their course they give the title of Gods Dij Consultores.
to thirty other Stars, the one half, above; the other, under the earth,
beholding all accidents. And in ten days one of the higher is sent to the
lower, as an angel, or messenger of the Stars, and one from them to the
higher: And this course they take eternally.

They hold twelve principal Gods, each of which has his peculiar month, and
his sign in the Zodiake; by which the Sun, and Moon, and five Planets, have
their motion. These Planets they esteem to confer much good or evil in the
generation of men, and by their nature and aspect, things to come may be
foreknowne. Many things they foretold to Alexander, Nicanor, Antigonus,
Seleucus, and to private men, beyond the reach of men. They number four and
twenty constellations without the Zodiake, twelve toward the North, and as
many toward the South. These Northernely are seen, which they attribute to
the living: those Southernely are hidden; and present (they think) to the
dead, whch they hold the Judges of all. Concerning the site, motion and eclipse
of the Moon, they hold as the Greeks; but of the Suns Eclipse they have
diverse opinions, and dare not utter their opinion thereof, nor foretell the
time. The earth they conceived to be hollow like a boat. They reckoned 43000.
years, until the coming of Alexander, since first they had begun their
observations of the Stars.

These years Xenophon de aquiuocis interprets of months: for so (says he)
the Chaldeans reckoned their antiquities; in other things they kept their
computation according to the Sun. But of their fabulous antiquities we have
heard before: where we have also touched, that one beginning of Idolatry did
arise of this curious and superstitious Star-gazing, especially in the
countries of Egypt, where not at all usually; and in Chaldaea, where diverse
months Eight months together, Master Eldred. Hak. Voy. tom 2.
together they have neither raines nor clouds. Strabo divides the Chaldeans
into sects, Orchent, Borsippeni, and others, diversely opinionate of the same
things. Borsippa was a City sacred to Diana and Apollo.

Some Philost^at. de vita Apol.lib. 1.
do call the Babylonian Priests, Magi; but because they were by this name best
known and most esteemed among the Persians, which in that vicinity of regions
had as near neighborhood in religions, we will speak of these Magi, in our
Persian relations. And it is thought that the Persian Magi came from these
Chaldeans. Mornaeus Ph. Morn. de Verit. C.R.
reckons among the Chaldea^ opinions, that of Oromases, Mitris, and Ariminis,
that is to say, GOD, Mind and Soul: which he applies to the Christian
doctrine of the holy Trinity. The Oracle of Apollo, pronounced the Chaldeans
and Hebrews to be only wise.

The Chaldean opinion concerning judicial Astrology, was not received of all
the Chaldeans, as Strabo reports. And Bardesanes Syrus, the best learned of
the Chaldeans (it is Eusebius. testimony Eusebius. de praeyar. Eu.l. 6.c.8.
) does at large confute that opinion (which yet many Wisards, carcasses of
Christians, still follow) He affirms that in those things which a man has
common with a beast, eating, sleep, nourishment, age, etc. a man is ordered by
Nature, as the beasts are. But Man having also a reasonable soul, and freedom
of will, is not subject to that natural servitude; which at large he proves by
the diverse customs of men, both in diverse, and in the same countries, in diet,
government, and religion: as the Reader, willing to read so worthy a discourse,
may find related at large in Eusebius. Alexander Polyhistor Eusebius. de
praeyar.lib.9. cap. 4.
out of Eupolemus, tells that in the tenth generation after the Flood, in
Camyrine a city of Babylonia, which other call Vr, Abram was borne, which
excelled all in knowledge, and was the inuentor of Astrology among the
Chaldeans. He by divine precept went into Phaenicia, and taught the Phaenicians
the course of the Sun and Moon: and when the Armenians, warring upon the
Phaenicians, had taken his brothers son prisoner, he by a band of his servants
recovered him, and freely dismissed the captives, which he had taken. He after
lived with the Priests at Heliopolis in Egypt, and taught them Astrology;
confessing that he had received that Art by succession from Enoch. He adds
that Belus reigned the second in Babylon, and was called Saturn, the father of
a second Belus, and Canaan; which Canaan was the father of the Phaenicians, and
the Aethiopians, brother of Mizraim the Author of the Egyptians: with many
other things not much differing from the Divine History.

Astronomy in all likelihood was known to Abraham, to whom the heavenly stars
might be Remembrancers of that promise, so shall thy seed be: his country also,
where it was practiced, might therein further him, and the excellence of the
Science in itself. But this Star-gazing destiny, Judicial, Co^iectural,
Genethliacal Astrology, Reason, and Experience, GOD and Man have condemned. Vr
signifies light, which agrees to the Fire, the Chaldean deity, Ammian.l. 23.
Plutar defacie in orb Lunae.
which the Persia^s and Chaldeans fained to have received from heaven, and kept
ever burning; as the Vestals in Rome. They held Water and Fire to be the
beginning of al things. They made a challenge of this their fiery God, to
contend with any other gods of the godless Heathen: an Egyptian encountered and
overcame them thus: he caused his Canopus to be made full of holes, stopped with
wax, and hollow in the middle, which he filled with water: and the Chaldeans
putting their fire under, the wax melting, opened a quiver of watery arrows,
that cooled the heat of their devouring god, and devoured him. They had yet a
more foolish God, even an Alex. ab Alexand.l. 6. 26.
Onyon which they worshipped. They observed diverse wicked Sciences, of
divining, by Fire, Air, Water, Earth, consulting with the dead, and with
wicked spirits. -- Chaldaea vocatis Imperat art dijs, says Claudian.

Every day the King Coelius l. 8.c. 1.
offered a Horse, furnished, unto the Sun; as did also the Persians.
Philostrat. says, that it was a white Horse of the Nisaean race, sumptuously
trapped, lib. 1. cap. 20. They observed a feast in Babylon ( Athenoeus
Athen.lib. 14. cap.17.
cites it out of Berosus) on the sixteenth Calends of September, which
continued five days; in which the Masters were subject to their servants, and
one of them, royally attired, was carried out of the house, whom they called
Zoganes. Baruch cap.6. in the Epistle of Ieremte (Apocrypha) rippeth up their
idolatrous Rites, Idols, Processions, bearing Idols on men's shoulders, the
people before and behind worshipping: their Priests collusiens to make gains
of the Idol-offerings, together with their Priests shaven heads and beards,
their rent clothes, their roaring before the Idol: their Temples wherein they
stood with scepters, axes, or other weapons in their hands, having candles
lighted before them, with other such rites; that, in the reading, one would
think he were telling the discourse of the mysteries of mystical Babylon in
the West; so euenly they accord. The Chaldeans innocate their Belus, to do:
miracles also says he, innocating a dumble I doll, to give speech to another,
which himself wants. But above all, one beastly rite was in use among them.
The women, says he, Bar. 6.42.
sit in the ways girded with cords of rushes, and burn straw: and if one of
them be drawn away, and he with any, such as come by, she casts her
neighbor in the teeth, because she was not so worthily reputed, nor her cord
broken. Thus was their glory their shame. Hero. Clio. Strabo. lib 16.
mentions the same.
Herodotus will yield us a Commentary on this place. The Babylonians have an
abominable law (says he) that all their women once in their life do sit at the
Temple of Venus to have familiarity with strangers: the richer sort coming in
chariots, richly furnished and attended to this ungodly purpose. Their manner
of sitting is, crowned on their temples with garlands, their retiring places
distinguished with cords, by which the stranger may have access to which of
them he likes best. And thus do these Votaries of Venus sit, holding it
religion to be irreligious, none of them ever returning home, til some guest
have cast money into her lap, whom it is not lawful for her to refuse, but to
accept of him and his price, whatsoever he be, and follow him aside from the
Temple, where he defiles her. At the giving of the money he uses these words,
Tantitibi deam Mylitt am imploro: that is, at this price, or for so much, I
implore unto thee the Goddess Mylitta (so the Assyrians call Venus) and this
money is consecrated to a sacred use. After this, with the Goddess good leave,
she may return home, although for no great price again (says our Author) to
be hired. By this means the fairest are quickly dispatched, the rest endure a
restles and irksome penance, sometime a year, two, or three, before they can
be discharged of their honesty and the law together. And hence might arise that
former ambitious vpbraiding in Baruch.

Among their many Idols, Bell bare the bell, not here alone, but in all the
countries of Assyria, and adjoining thereto; as appears in the History of the
Bible: where Bell or Baal is so often mentioned, as the Idol of so many nations,
and the sin of the apostatical synagogue. They Ier. 19.5. Icrem. 32. 1. Reg.
18. and 16. 2. Reg. 23. and 10. Ose. 2.Es. 46.
built unto him high places: or else in stead therofvsed the roofes of their
houses to his worship: they built him houses, they made him Images, erected
Altars, planted groves, bended to him the knee, and kissed him in token of
subjection, used perfume and intense, observed to him holy days, cut and
lanced themselves in his service, with other extaticall furies, and religious
frenzies, with ornaments of gold and jewels, inuocations and immolations, yea
of their own children: he had also his peculiar Prophets and Priests. These
and such like does the Scripture mention of this Babylonian Idol, whose
contagion infected the East with a Catholic Idolatry that could plead
Antiquity, Universality, and Consent, by evidence of Scripture-historie
(which later Babylon cannot do) and yet was but Catholic and general error.

Ribera affirms Rib. in Hos.2.
that diverse later Authors, and before them Inler 32.
Theodcret, do esteem the name Bell or Baal to be a general name, agreeing to
all the Gods of the Gentiles, according to the signification of the word, to
wit, a Lord. Nic. Strar. in Iudic.
It was a name general to their Idols, when it was put alone, but particular
with some addition, as Bel-zebub, Baal-zephon. And Seruius On those words of
Virgil. (...), nicro pateram, quam Belus and omnes a Beln sol^^, etc. Aeneid.1.
is author, that Belus the father of Dido descended of that ancient Belus the
first King of the Assyrians, which people worshipped Saturn and Juno, which
were after worshipped in Africa, whereupon the Punikes called God, Bal, ( from
whence came those names Hannibal, Adherbal, and such like) whom the Assyrians
in some respect call Bell, and Saturn, and the Sun. This opinion that in Bell
they worshipped the Sun, is followed by Tremellius and Iunius in their notes
on Esaias, chap.46.1. because the Assyrians, Persians, and Babylonians,
accounted the Sun the greatest God, and worshipped the Fire as a particle
thereof: To him the Jews, with this borrowed foreign Idolatry, dedicated
horses and chariots, which Josias ^. King.23.11
abolished, together with the Altars on the roose of Ahaz his house, and the
high places, where their God might see their devotions. Hierome, on that place
of Esaias, says, that Bell was Saturn, which Suidas confirms. Augustine
Aug.tom.4.quaest.lib.7.16.
relates the usual opinion (on those words, Iud.2. They served Baal and
Astaroth) that Baal in those parts was the name of Jupiter, and Astarte of
Juno, and produces the Punike language, in which Baalsamen signifies the LORD
of Heaven; and for Astaroth (which he reads Astartibus) he says it is in the
plural number, in regard of the multitude of Juno's Images, each bearing the
name of Juno. This also is exemplified in the blessed Virgin by Ribera,
sometime called our Lady of Loretto, sometime our Lady of Monteferato, etc.
according to the diversity of places, wherein they worship, not Mary the
Virgin, but their own Idols; the daughters of their whorish mother Babylon.
For the Tyrians, Sydonians, Philistims, and other Syrian, and Assyrian nations,
the Scripture brandeth them with this Bell or Baal-Idolatry: in hatred of which
name, the Jews called the Prince of Devils, as the Acaronites did their
principal Idols, by the name of Beelzebub.

Thus the Greeks and Latins have confounded the Assyrian and Tyrian Bell,
which by Josephus Scalig. Can.Isagog. lib 3. page 314.
Scaliger (who not unworthily is called Od. Drayton. Polyolb.
the Dictator of knowledge and great Prince of learnings state) are
distinguished and made two: the one (says he) is written (...) and the later
(...) and reproves Hierome for making Belus, the father of Ninus, and the
Virgilian Belus to be one: In Photius (559. 3.) is mentioned, that the
Phaeuicians and Syrians called Saturn L, and l, EL, and Bell, and Bolathes.
Doctor Willet in his Comment upon Dan. cap. 1. q.16.has these words: The
Chaldeans had five Idols, three Gods, and two Goddesses. Their first God was
Bell, a name contracted of Behel, which comes of Bahal, which signifies a
Lord: to whom was built that Temple before mentioned. The second was the Sun,
which they called Rach, that is, a King; because he is chief among the
Planets: and the Persians call him Muhra, as Justinius Martyr says, Dialog. in
Triphon. the Priests of this Idol were called Racrophantoe Obseruers of the
Sun. Their third God was Nego, the Fire; so called of the brightness, which
was carried about among them. Their first Goddess was Shacha, which was the
Earth, worshipped also of the Romans under the names of Tellus and Opis: of the
Syrians called Dorcetha. In the honor of this Goddess they used to keep a
feast five days together in Babylon; during which time the Masters were under
the dominion of their servants. This festival time was called Shache, whereof
Babylon was called Sheshach, of keeping this feast, I erem. 25. 27. and 51.41.
Their other Goddess was Mulitta, which was Venus, whose Priests were called

He also interprets Quaest. 16.
those words Dan. 1.4. Whom they might teach the learning and tongue of the
Chaldeans, of Schools wherein youth were brought up in goodletters, to be
after employed in the State. So among the Egyptians they had the like use,
where Moses was taught the learning of the Egyptians. Among the Israelites
eight and forty Cities were appointed for the Levites, which were as the common
Schools and Universities for the whole kingdom. Samuel and Elizeus had their
Schools and Colleges of Prophets: yea the rude Indians had their
Gymnosophistes; and the Romans had their Colleges of Augures. Thus far
Doctor Willet of their Idols and Schools.

In the seventeenth chapter of the second book of Kings is mentioned Sucoth
Benoth and Idol of the Babylonians. Beda interprets it the Tabernacles of
Benoth: and so the word Sucoth used, Amos 5.25.is by Saint Stephen,
Act.7.43.interpreted. And so does the Ra.in Glossordin.
Gloss on that place of the Kings interpret; where Lyra Lyra.in 4. Reg.17.
according to the signification of the words (a Tabernacle of wings) relates
out of Rab.Sal. that this Idol was made like to a Hen brooding her chickens:
which Idols the Babylonians framed in worship of that Constellation, called by
the vulgar, the Hen and chickens, and of the learned, Pleiades; as others did
to the Sun, others to the Moon. Some Wolph.in a. Reg.17.
apply it to the mystery of their Idol, (which CHRIST the Truth, truly says
of himself) protecting his worshippers, as a hen her chickens.

In the fourteenth chapter of Daniel, as the Latins read, is a large history
both of Bell, a dead statue, and of a living Dragon, which the Babylonians
worshipped. The Priests of Bell were seventy, besides their wives and children,
whose fraud and cousenage Daniel detected, making it manifest by their
footsteps in the ashes, which he had strewed in the Temple, that they were the
deuourers of that huge portion of forty sheep, twelve measures of meal, and
six great pots of wine, daily consecrated for Bells breakfast. He after slew
the Dragon also; for which the Babylonians forced the King to lodge him six
days among the Lions. But howsoever generally more authority is to be
ascribed to the Apocriphall books, then to any humane history, or other
Ecclesiastical Authors, as Zanchius in his Confession religiously holds; yet
for this fragment of Daniel, it is accounted Whitak. de Scrip. quaest.1.cap.9.
the work of Thedotion a bad man, who foisted it into his translation. And not
only the Reformed Churches account it as it is, but Driedo a learned Papist,
Erasmus a Semi-christian (so Bellarmine calls him) Julius Africanus of old,
and the Jews generally, reject it out of the Canon, as the Cardinal himself
Bell. de verb Dci lib. I. cap. 9.
has observed: and he is feign to tell us of another Daniel of the Tribe of
Leui, to maintain the credit hereof. But Hicrome in the Preface of his
Commentaries styles them, Belis Draconisque fabulas, quas veru anteposito
eoque. iugulante, subiec^t, ne videretur apud imperitos magnam partem voluminu^
detruneasse: and alleges Eusebius, Origin, Apollinarius, and other
Ecclesiastical Doctors, which were of his mind, and thought that they needed
not to answer Porphyrie, who had hence raked some objections against the
Christians, for these things which had not authority of Scripture.

As for Pyramus, and Thysbe, with Cyparissus and such like, I leave them to
Metamorph. 4. and 10.
Ovid and the Poets. It seems worthy relation that fell out at Aslus, a
Babylonian City, where a Dolphin so loved a Boy, that following too far
after their wonted sportings, he stuck fast in the sands: Solinus c.18.
which Alexander interpreting to be ominous, preferred the Boy to the
Priesthood of Neptune.

For the present Saracenicall Religion, now observed in these parts, our third
book shall largely relate thereof. Concerning other Babylonian customs:
Herodotus, l.2. tells of three families in Babylon which lived on fish. It
may be the Carthusians of our Western Babylon are of their of-sping: for whose
sparing, their fellows may eat the more flesh, with which those of old, and
these later, may not (forsooth) pollute themselves. Duint.Curt.lib.5.
Curtius tells generally that, for fleshly vices, the Babylonians were most
corrupt. They prostituted their wives and daughters to their guests for
rewards. They were addicted to excessive banketting, and drunkenness. In the
beginning of their feasts, their women were modestly attired; by degrees they
stripped themselves of their clothes, beginning with the vpper-most, till
nothing was left to cover their shame, or forbid their shamelessenesse. And not
their Curtizans alone, but their Matrons, (yea, in token of civility) did thus
prostitute themselves to those flames of lusts which have come from hell, and
carry thither. Here was Alexanders manly and victorious army made
effeminate, unfit after to have encountered with a strong enemy. Coe'ius Rhod.
lib.8. cap.11.
Some ascribe the loose lives of the Babylonians, to a law of Xerxes, who to
chastise them for a rebellion, enacted that they should no longer wear arms,
but addict themselves to Music, riot, and such like.

least for so long a space before Belus, with whom the most histories begin
their relations, and Scaliger his The Affyrian Dynastie. Moses, Genesis 14.1

Cyzicenus 18. Philippus 2. In all 237. And from the beginning of the first
Dynastie 2633. These I have here inserted out of Scaliger, rather to show the
continued succession of the Eastern Empire, then with any intent to persuade,
that all these were Kings, and ruled the country of Babylonia. For after
Arsaces rebelled, the Parthians dispossessed the Syrian Kings of these parts:
and before, the Babylonians often rebelled: as in the time of the Persians,
when Zopyrus by a strange stratageme, recited by Justin and others, restored
them to Darins: but especially in the times of the Medes, whose Dynastie was
much disquieted: sometime the Scythians ( Oros. lib. 1. cap. 19.
says Orosius) and sometimes the Chaldeans, and sometimes the Medes
prevailing. Sometimes also (as the Scripture witnesses) the Assyrians renewed
their ancient power. Yea in the time of the Assyrian Dynastie, the Chaldeans
are said to war (in the reign of Panyas) against the Phaenicians, which
argues that they were then free.

The Scripture and other Histories speak of Phul, Teglath-Phalasar, Iareb,
Sargon, Salman-asar, Senacherib, Asar-haddon: which were great and mighty, not
only strong enough to defend themselves against the Medes, but to invade
foreign Nations, yea did translate people from one kingdom to another, and 2.
Reg. 17. 24.
seated the captives of Israel in the Cities of the Medes, and sent Babylonian
Colonies to Samaria; which they could not do, if they had not commanded both
Assyria, and Media, with Babylonia.

Nabonassar rebelled, as is said, against Artycas, and began the Chaldean
Dynastie, from whom, for this restitution of liberty, the Chaldeans began
their Astronomicall computations: he reigned 14. years, Nassyus 2. Chinzerus
and Porus 5. DiIulans 5. Mardokempadus 12. Called Merodach.
He sent Ambassadors to Hezekia. Arkeanos 5. Interregnum 12. Belithus 3.
Aporonadicus 6. Herigebalus 1. Nesnoemondacus 4. Interregnum 17. Ieracdin 13.
Saosducinus 9. Kiniladachus 14. Nabopellasarus 29. (In the seventeenth year of
his reign, he sent his son Nabuchodmoser into Syria with an army.)
Nabuchodonosor 30. Euilmerodach 6. Neregasolarus 5. Nabonidus 17. This was a
Mede by lineage (not as some say, King of the Medes) and therefore called Darius
Medus, deprived by Cyrus, who after that reigned nine years. From the
beginning of Nabonassar, to the end of Cyrus, are 217. years. From thence to
the Asiatike Empire of the Macedonians 201. From thence to the rebellion of
Arsaces the Parthian, of whom the Parthian Kings were called Arsacidae 79. And
the Dynastie of the Parthians continued 479. years: the last of them
Artabanus, being slain. These Kings, and the times of their reigns are not
easy to set down, and Onuphrius is therefore reproved of Scaliger, for
undertaking this task, in which Authority fails him. Of them we shall
speak in due place.

The Saracens succeeded, whose names and times you may see in our Lib. 3. cap.
1.
Saracenicall relation. After the Saracens, reigned the Tartars; and since,
sometime one family, sometime another, among the Persians, till Solomon
dispossessed the Sophian of the Babylonian dominion, under which Turkish
feruitude it groned, till our days, in which the present Persian has
recovered it.

I dare not take upon me to be vmpire and decider of those many altercations
among Chronologers: but have simply followed Scaliger, whose very name is able
to shield me from contempt, if not to yield me commendation. Let others, that
have more lust and leisure, trauerse these matters at their pleasure: my intent
is, most of all, the Histories of Religions: and the successions and
alterations of States I have lightly touched: But precisely to determine in
what year of the world every King began his reign, and to dispute the same
with all opponents, would be somewhat tedious to the Reader: to me
(perhaps) in these varieties of opinions, impossible. Leaving therefore the
more studious, to the Chronologers, let us take a little reuiew of some
principal occurrents in the former Catalogue.

Africanus begins the Assyrian Monarchy at Belus, and not, as the most, with
Ninus. That Belus some think to be the same with Nimrod, whom Ninus as we
said before, consecrated. Semiramis is Coeius R lb. 13. cap. 29.
reported to be the first, that caused Eunuchs to be made. Ninias, which
succeeded, left not like monuments of his great exploits, as his Predecessors
before him. Buntingus thinks him to be that Amraphel King of Shinar,
mentioned, Genes. 14. and that Arioch King of Elasser was his son. How ever,
it breeds much difficulty, to reconcile the ancient history of the
Babylonian and Assyrian great and long continued Empire, with the kingdoms and
Kings in that Chapter by Moses mentioned. Eupolemus, as before is cited out of
Eusebius, says that those Kings were Armenians; Diodorus Tarsensis, as
Percrius affirms, reckons them Persians, Josephus. Assyrians: Pererius
himself thinks them vassals, and tributaries to the Assyrian: Genebrara
suspects the History of the Assyrian greatness: and truly, not altogether
unjustly, as all the History of: Moses and Joshua concerning the Kings in
those parts, for ought can be gathered, yielding no subjection to Babylon. And
the Sodomite and his neighbors had been the tributaries of Chedarlaomer King
of Elam, and not of Amraphel King of Shinar: unless we say that violent things
are not permanent, and the yoke imposed before by the Assyrians, was now in
Ninias days rejected: Semiramis being weakened with her Indian expedition, and
Ninias by killing her, giving occasion of discontent to her followers, the men
of war, which might hereupon (contemning this effeminate King, who had
suffered his mother to possess the Scepter so long) fall to sharing for
themselves, and erect petty kingdoms. Arius (happily) restored the Empire
thus decayed, if it be true that Buntingus writes, that he was a great
warrior, therefore called Arius and Mars, and, as the God of war, inuocated
by the Assyrians. When Tentamos reigned, Diodor. Sic. lib. 3. cap. 7.
Diodor. lib. 3. testisieth, that Priamus, then besieged by Agamemnon, as
vassal and tributarie to the Assyrians, sent to him for aid, who sent to his
succor Memnon, with 20000. soldiers.

But to descend unto times nearer both us and the truth, and to view the ruin
of that great estate: we read in the same Author, and in Justin. lib. 1.
Orosius lib. 2. c. 2.
others, that Arbaces (whom Justin calls Arbactus; Orosius, Arbastus) was by
Sardanapalus made captain of the army which was yearly sent to Nina, or
Niniue, where a conspiracy was contracted between him and Belesus a Chaldean
Priest, Captain of the Babylonians, who by his Chaldean skill in divination,
had foretold Arbaces this destined Empire, and was promised, for his share, the
Babylonian principality. Thus the Medes, Babylonians, and Arabians,
enterprising rebellion, assembled to the number of 400000. whom Sardanapalus
overthrew in battle twice; but being still animated by Some think t^^ s
Belesus to be Din^el, whom the Babylonian King called Belesh zzar. Bi^^ h ins
Concent.
Belesus predictions, which (said he) the Gods by the Stars fore-signified:
and by corrupting of the Bactrian army, sent to succor the King, and
adjoining themselves to the enemy, they at the third battle overthrew the
forces of Sardanapalus, led by Salamenus his wives brother. The King fled into
Niniue, trusting to a prophecy, That the City should never be taken till the
river were enemy to it. After two years siege, by extreme raines, the river
swelling ouerflowed part of the City, and cast down twenty furlongs of the
walls. Whereupon despairing (as seeming to see GOD and Man against him) he,
which before had chambered himself with women, and accustomed himself to the
Distaffe, in a woman's both heart and habit: now in a manly resolution (if it
may not more sitly be called a Feminine Dissolution, which thus runs from
that danger which it should encounter) gathered his treasures together, and
erecting a frame in his Palace, there burnt them, himself, his wives, and
eunuchs together. The Ashes, under pretense of a Vow thereof, made to Belus,
Belesus obtained of Arbaces the new Conqueror and Monarch, to carry to
Babylon. But the cousinage being known, and Belesus condemned for the
treasures, which with the ashes he had conveyed, Arbaces both gave it, and
forgave him; adding the praesecture of the Babylonians, according to promise.
Phrygio. Carrion. lib. 2.
Some say that Belesus, whom they call Phul Beloch, shared the Empire with him,
Arbaces reigning over the Medes and Persians, the other over Niniuie and
Babylonia: following herein the forged Metasthenes, who (as Annius makes him
to say) out of the Susian Library penned his History, having before fabled a
Catalogue out of Berosus of the ancient Kings, contrary to that which out of
the fragments of the true Berosus before is delivered.

Sardanapalus is written (says Eusebius, Chron. per Scalig.
Scaliger in his Notes upon Eusebius) with a double ll. Sardanapallus, a name,
sitting to his effeminate life. ^all and phall signify the same, whence are
those words of Cicero 3. De Repuh. Sardanapallus ille vitijs multo quam nomine
ipso deformior. Sardanapalus built Tarsus and Anchiale (says Eusebtus) at the
same time: the one famous for the most famous Divine that ever the Sun saw,
(except the Sun of Righteousness himself) Paul the Apostle and Doctor of
the Gentiles: The other for the Authors Monument and stony Image, Strabo lib.
14.
with this Assyrian Epigramme; Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyndar axis, built
Anchiale and Tarsus in one day: and thou O stranger, Eat, drink, play. And
Verses were annexed, which I have thus englished.

Mortal, thou know thy self: then please thine appetite
With present dainties: Death can yield thee no delight.
Lo, I am now but dust: whilome a Prince of might.
What I did eat, I have; and what my greetly mind
Consumed: how much (alas) how sweet, left I behind?
Learn this, (O man) thus live: best wisdom thou can find
. This his Legacy he has bequeathed to all Epicures, the living Sepulchers
of themselves, breathing graves (not of so many Creatures only better than
themselves, which they devour, but) of Reason, Nature, Religion, Soul, and
(if it were possible) of GOD, which all lie buried in these swine, covered with
the skins of Men. 1. Cor. 15.32.
Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Who knows whether Paul
did not allude to this speech of the Founder of his City? This subversion of
the Assyrian Empire was Anno mundt 3145. after Buntingus account. Of the Medes
see more in their proper place.

The Babylonian Empire renewed by Nabonassar, continued till Cyrus, of which
times we have little record, but in the Scripture, as neither of those
Assyrian Kings, which before had captiued Israel, and invaded Judah. Senacherib
is famous, even in the Ethnike history, although they had not the full truth.
For thus Herodotus Herod. lib. 2.
tells, That Sanacharib King of the Arabians and Assyrians warred on Egypt,
where Sethon (before, Vulcans Priest) then reigned: who, being forsaken of his
soldiers, betook him to his devotion, amiddest the which he fell asleep.
And the god appearing, promised aid which he performed, sending an Army of
Mice into the Army of Sanacharib, which did eat his Soldiers quiuers, and
the leathers of their shieldes, and armor, in so much, that the very next day
they all fled. In witness whereof, the Image of the King, made of stone,
stands in the Temple of Vulcan, holding a mouse in his hand, uttering these
words; He that looks on me, let him be religious. This History the Egyptians,
in vanity and ambition, had thus perverted and arrogated to themselves.

Funcius and Osiander make Nabopollasar and Nabuchodonosor to be one and the
same, and diverse Commenters upon Daniel hold the same opinion, whom Scaliger
and Caluisius confute at large. Nabopollasar is supposed to begin his reign
Anno mundi 3325. which he continued nine and twenty years: in his Sc.canon.^.3.
seventeenth year Nebuchadnezzar (so the Masorites mis-call him, says
Scaliger) or Nabuchodonosor his son was sent by him, to subdue the rebellious
Egyptians, Jews, and Palestinians: at which time he carried away Daniel into
captivity. Berosus apud Iosephum contra App.libr.1. Caluisius.
He began his reign Anno mundi 3354, and in the year 3360. destro^yed
Jerusalem. In the year 3386. Euilmerodach his son succeeded him, whom
Neriglessoorus, (as Scaliger Animaduers. in Eusebium page 85.
affirms) slew, thereby to advance his own son the nephew of
Nabuchodonosor, called Laborosoarchadus, to the Scepter; which himself swayed
as Protector in the minority of his son. But he being dead, and his son
more fit for a Chamber then a Throne, Nabonidus conspired against him, and slew
him. This Nabonidus, says he, is Darius Medus, and Laborosoarchadus is that
Baltasar mentioned by Daniel, after Scaligers interpretation of the Prophet out
of Berosus and Megasthenes.

It is a world to see how the Catholics (so they call themselves) sweat in
finding out that Nabuchodonosor mentioned in Judith 1. Pintus would make it a
common name to the Babylonian Kings, as Pharao to the Egyptians: Pererius will
have two of the name; others will have him to be Cyrus; others, Cambyses,
Artaxerxes, Ochus. Once, Babel is a mother of confusion to her children, and
makes them babble, while they will canonise Apocrypha-scriptures.

Cyrus ended the Babylonian monarchy, and having won Babylon, and taken
Darius Medus at Borsippa, he gave him his life, and the government of
Carmania. An. mundi 3409. As Nabuchodonosor had by Edict proclaimed the God of
Daniel, so Cyrus ended the captivity of his people; giving liberty to such, as
would, to return. But many Jews abode there still, and thence sent their
yearly offerings to the temple. In the time of Artabanus the Parthian (when
Caligula tyrannized at Rome) Joseph. Antiq. lib. 1S.ca.12.
Asimaeus and Anilaens, brethren of the Jewish nation, grew mighty, and
haughty withal, forgetting God and themselves, which caused the Babylonians
to conspire against the^, and (after the death of the brethren with thousands
of their partakers) they slew in Seleucia fifty thousand of the Jewish Nation.
Neerda and Nisibis were then much peopled by the Jews. And thus Religion
partly held the ancient course, partly was mixed (according to the custom of
Conquests) with the Persian, Macedonian, Parthian, besides the Jewish and
Syrian, until the Apostles preached here the Christian verity.

About the same time, Helena and her son Izates King of Adiabena (which is in
these parts of Assyria) became Jewish Proselytes. Seleucia was built by
Seleucus Nicator on a channel dug out of Euphrates into Tigris.
Plin.lib.6.ca.26.
Seleucia built by Seleucus (as it were the marriage-Chamber of Euphrates and
Tigris, which there meet and mix their waters: Nature being by man's industry
forced to yield to the match) as Pliny says, for that purpose, emptied
Babylon of her Inhabitants, and inherited her name also, with her people. It
was from Babylon ninety miles, or, as some read it, forty, inhabited with
six hundred thousand citizens. To spoil the spoyler, the Parthians built
Ctesiphon three miles from thence, and failing of their purpose, Vologesus
built another town by, called Vologesocerta. Yet did Babylon it self remain
(but not it self) in the time of Ammianus Marcellinus, and after.

Ortelius thinks that Bagdat was called Babylon (as Seleucia before had
been) because it stood near to the place where Babylon had stood. For that
old Babylon in Pausanias Arcad. lib.8.
Pausanias time, had nothing left standing but the Temple of Bell, and the
walls; sometimes, says he, the greatest City that ever the Sun saw.

In Ieromes time, Hieron in Es.13.
within those walls were kept beasts for the Kings game. It was after inhabited
with many thousands of Jews, and was laid even with the ground, as Ios.
Scaliger Scal. animadversan Eusebius. page.126.
affirms, in the year, after the Jewish account, four thousand seven
hundred ninety and seven, and after the Christian, one thousand thirty and
seven. Master Fox has a little Act.andMon. ex M.S. Caricus.
lengthned the date and fate thereof, showing that Almaricus King of Jerusalem
rased and ruined it, and that it was never after inhabited.

Before that time was Bagded built by Bugliafar as I.di Bar. As.dec.1. lib.1.
Barrius calls him, or after Scal.can.Isa.lib.2.and 3.
Scaliger, Abugephar Elmantzur, who began to reign in the one hundred
thirty and six, and died in the one hundred fifty and eight year of their
Hegeira. Scaliger and Lidyat Em. Tem.
Lydyate agree of this place (which in their Emendations of Time disagree so
eagerly) that it was Seleucia, or built in the place, and of the ruins
thereof: an opinion not improbable, as theirs is altogether which think the
present Bagded to be the old Babylon. The story of this Bagded or Baldach, and
her Chalifs, ye may read in Lib.3.ca^.2.
our Saracenicall History. Loys le Roy. libr.8. Knolls T.H.page.113. M Polo
Ven. Haiton Armen.
Authors agree, that Haalon the Tartar sacked it, about the year one thousand
two hundred and three score. Mustratzem being then Chalipha, the four and
fiftieth, and last of those Saracenicall Popes. He found a miserable death,
where others with miserableness seek a blessed life, being shut up and
starued amidst those Treasures, whereof he had store, which Niggardise forbade
him to disburse in his own defense.

There is yet a bone left of this Calipha's carcass; or some ghost and shadow
of that great and mighty body, I mean that ancient name and power of the
Calipha's, which, magnificent Solomon the Turkish Emperor in his conquest
1534. would seem to acknowledge, in accepting the royal ensigns of that new
conquered state at the hands of their Calipha: a ceremony which the Soldans in
Egypt and Persia used, more for form them necessity; this Assyrian and that
Egyptian Caliph having but gesture and vesture, the Souldans themselves
enjoying both body and soul of this authority.

In the year one thousand one hundred fifty nine, the river Tigris ouerflowed
Bagded, and desolated many Cities. Barrius Decad.As.li.2.
affirms out of the Arabian and Persian Tarigh, which he says he had seen,
that Bagded was built by the counsel of an Astrologer, a Gentile named Nobach,
and has for ascendent Sagittarius, was finished in four years, and cost
eighteen millions of gold. These studies of Astrology did there flourish. One
Richardus Rich.contra Alcoran.ca.13.

were maintained at public charge, of which number himself was one. That

was within few years after the Tartar had won it. He adds that there were
many Christians in these parts: and that in the year one thousand two hundred
twenty and five, in derision of the Gospel, the Chaliph commanding by a day,
that the Christians should remove a mountain in testimony of their faith,
according to the words of CHRIST, or else to abide the peril; this was
effected by a Shoemaker, and the day in remembrance thereof yearly solemnized

A certain Merchant, (the Discourse of whose voyage Cap. 8.

Babylon, wherein the people foolishly suppose, that Abraham offered Isaac: at
which time (say they) there sprang a fountain which waters their Country,
and drives their milles. Here was a Christian Temple called Saint Abraham,
after turned into a Mahumetane Moschee, and now called Abraham's well, into
which if any enter so many times (they have a set number) with devotion, he is
freed of any fever: The fishes which are many, have taken Sanctuary in these
waters, and none dare take them, but hold them holy. Six miles from hence is a

an other sleepie drink) after came again to themselves. And then did

CHAP. XIIII.
Of Niniue and other neighboring Nations.

WE have hitherto spoken of Babylonia, but so, as in regard of the Empire, and
some other occurrents, Necessity now and then compelled us to make excursions
into some other parts of Assyria, Mesopotamia, etc. And I know not how, this
Babylon causes confusion in that Sea of affairs, and in regard of the
division of the Pens (as sometimes of Tongues) of such as have written
thereof. Hard it is to distinguish between the Assyrian and Babylonian Empire,
one while united, an other while divided, as each party could most prevail:
and no less hard to reconcile the Ethnike and Divine History touching the
same. Ptolomey Libr.6.cap.I.
straitneth Assyria, on the north, with part of Armenia near the river
Niphates; on the west with Mesopotamia; on the south with Susiana; and Media on
the east. But her large Empire has enlarged the name of Syria, and of Assyria
(which names the Greeks did not well distinguish) to many Countries in that
part of Asia. The Scripture deriueth Syria from Aram, and Assyria from Ashur.
Both were in their times flourishing, and mention is made from Abraham's time,
both of the wars and kingdoms in those parts: yea before, from Ashur and
Nimrod, as already is showed.

Mesopotamia is so called, and in the Scripture Aram or Syria of the waters,
because it is situate between Euphrates and Tigris: the Countries Babylonia,
and Armenia, confining the same on the North and South. Whereas therefore we
have in our former Babylonian relation discoursed of Assyria, extending the
name after a larger reckoning: here we consider it more properly.

The chief City thereof was Niniue, called in Jonas, Ion ^^ 3.3.
A great and excellent City of three days iourny. It had (I borrow the words
of our reverend Diocesan) Doctor King on Jonas Lect.2.
an ancient testimony long before in the Book of Genes. 10.11.
Genesis. For thus Moses writes, That Ashur came from the land of Shinar, and
built Nineveh and Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin. At length he singleth out
Niniue from the rest, and sets a special mark of pre-eminence upon it,
This is a great City: Which honor, by the judgment of the most learned
(though standing in the last place) belongs to the first of the four Cities,
namely to Niniue. Others Annius upon Eeros.
imagined (but their conjecture is without ground) that the four Cities were
closed up within the same walls, and made but one, of an unusual bigness.

Some ascribe the building of Niniue to Ninus the son of Belus: of whom it
took the name, to be called either Ninus, as we read in 'Pliny; or after the
manner of the Hebrews, Niniue: and after a few words; By the confession of
all, both facred and Gentile Histories, the City was very spacious, having
four hundred and fourscore furlongs in circuit, when Babylon had fewer almost
(as some report) by an hundred: and as afterward it grew in wealth and
magnificence, so (they write) it was much more enlarged. Raphael Volaterranus
affirms, That it was eight years in building; and not by fewer at once then
ten thousand workmen. There was no City since, by the estimation of
Diodorus Siculus, that had like compass of ground, or stateliness of walls:
the height whereof was not less then an hundred foot; the breadth sufficiently
capable to have received three Carts on a row: and they were furnished and
adorned besides with fifteen hundred Turrets. Thus far our reverend and
learned Bishop.

Diodorus Diod, Sic. i. 3. c. 1.
tells out of Ctesias. That Ninus, after he had subdued the Egyptians,
Phoenicians, Syrians, Cilicians, Phrygians, and others, as far as Tanais, and
the Hyrcanians, Parthians, Persians, and other their neighbors, he built this
City. After that, he led an Army against the Bactrians of seventeen hundred
thousand footmen, and two hundred thousand horse: in which Expedition he took
Semiramis from her husband Menon, who therefore (impatient of love and grief)
hanged himself. He had by her a son of his own name, and then died, leaving
the Empire to his wife. His Sepulcher was nine furlongs in height (each of
which is six hundred feet) and ten in breadth. The credit of this History I
leave to the Author, scarce seeming to agree with Moses narration of the
building of Niniue, any more then Semiramis building of Babylon. Some write,
That Aelian. vat. bist. l. 7. c. 1.
Semiramis abusing her husbands love, obtained of him the swaying of the Empire
for the space of five days; in which time she deprived him of his life, and
succeeded in his Estate.

But least the name of this City call us back again too much to those
Assyrian Relations, before dilated as much as concerns our purpose; let us
see what can be said of their Religion here. Of this we find little, but as
before is showed of the Babylonians.

Nisroch was the Idol, in whose Temple Senacherib was slain by his own
sons. But what this Nisroch was, I cannot find. Certain it is, that he
which had vpbraided confidence in the true GOD, finds his Idol, even in the
place and time of his Worship, his Traitor; and he which had blasphemed the
GOD of Heaven, finds Heaven and Earth, and his own bowels, against him.

Uenus Urania Wolpb. in 2. Reg. 19.
is reckoned among the Assyrian devotions, and Adad was their chief God, which
they interpret One, (and Macrobius, the Sun, which, as before is said, they
worshipped) and Atargatis, the Earth. Belus also was here worshipped, as
witness Dion, Eusebius and Cyrillus.

Lucian Luc. in lone Tragoedo.
says, That the Assyrians sacrificed to a Dove; the touching of which Foul
required much ceremony for expiation: Whereto accords the fable, Metam. 4.
that Semiramis was turned into a Dove.

Concerning Adad and Atargatis, Macrobius Saturnal. l. 1. 23.
says, That the Assyrians ascribe all power to these two. The Image of Adad
shined with rays or beams downwards, designing the Suns force: That of
Atargatis, with beams upwards, as it were ascribing to the heavenly influence
all her plenty: under the same Image were the shapes of Lions, as also the
Phrygians fained the mother of the Gods, that is, the Earth, to be borne on
Lions. But of this Atargatis more in the next Chapter.

think in the days of Sardanapalus his next predecessor. Broughton (with some
other) thinks in the days of Pull, or Phul-Assur. Their repentance stayed
that judgment. Nahum after denounced the like judgment, which accordingly
came to pass. Phraortes King of the Medes (mentioned in the former Chapter)
besieged it. His son Cyaxares succeeded in the Kingdom, and in this siege.
After that, the Scythians invaded Media, and held it eight and twenty years,
according to the prophecy of Jeremy, 49. 34. and in the same Expedition
obtained Niniue. But Cyaxares after prevailed against the Scythians, and
Astyages his son ouer-turned and destroyed Niniue, that it should no more be
a receptacle or encouragement to the Assyrians, to rebel against the Medes.
Nahum threatens Nab. 2. 6.
opening of the gates of the Rivers, and destruction to the Temple, as
Tremellins reads it, noting thereon the casting down of the Forts on Tigris,
and amongst them the Temple of Belus there erected; out of whose notes on the
first Chapter of Nahum, I inserted the former relation. Herodotus in the
History hereof says, That Phraeortes there perished in the siege, with most
part of his army. Cyaxares, to revenge his fathers death, renewed the siege,
but was not able to hold his own against the Scythians, until, after eight
and twenty years, that the Scythians had enjoyed the Empire of Asia (under
pretense of feasting being entertained in a banquet) the most of them, in their
drunkenness, were slain by the Medes: and so the Scythians loosing what
before they had gotten, Cyaxares recovered the Empire, and destroyed Niniue.
Thus was that City destroyed ^arothaeus in his Synopsi affirms, that by an
Earthquake the lake which compassed the City drowned it, and ^^ fire consumed
the upper part thereof.
whose Riches, Beauty, Antiquity, Largeness, and Puissance, the Scripture so
often mentions.

A man may compare Ecbatana of the Medes, Babylon on Euphrates, and Niniue on
Tigris, to the Triumviri at Rome: So did they both emulate and share the
Eastern Empire, as each could make her self strongest; now Babylon, another
while Niniue, and sometime Ecbatana prevailing: which is the cause of no small
difficulty in these Histories, M. Cartwright, an eyewitness, has beheld (he
says) the ruins of this City, and agrees with Diodorus in the inequality
of the sides: two of which contained an hundred and fifty furlongs, the two
other but fourscore and ten on a side.

Mosul is supposed to be Niniue, happily for the neerenesse, or for that (as a
posthume issue) it has sprung from the former. The ashes yet have not yielded
such a Phoenix as the former was. G. Bo. Ben. part. 1. lib. 2.
Mosul is in fame for Cloth of Gold and Silk, for fertility, and for the
Patriarchall Sea of the Nestorian Christians, whose authority stretches to
Cathay and India. Merdin, a Town on the same River, is also a Patriarchall Sea
of the Chaldees (or Mahumetane Sect.) In Paulus Venetus his days M. Paul. l.
1. c. 6.
they were in the Province of Mosul, partly Mahumetans, partly Christians: and
in the Mountains dwelt the Curdi, that were Participles or Mungrels in
Religion, professing partly Christ, partly Mahumet in practice robbers and
wicked. The Christian Patriarch has Archbishops and Bishops under him, as the
Roman Pope. The Mahumetans are called Aratri.

Assyria (says Magin. Geogr.
Maginus) is now called by Niger, Adrinsa; by Garara, Azemia; by Pinetus,
Mosul; by Mercator, Sarh; and of Castaldus, Arzerum. It sometime contained the
Provinces, Arapachite, Adiabena, and Sittacene, now called (after some) Botan,
Sarca, and Rabia.

Boemus l. Boem. l. 1.
tells of a strange fashion aunciently used in Assyria; That the maids which
were marriageble were yearly brought forth in public, and set to sale to such
as would marry them. The money which was given for the fairest, was given to
the more deformed for their portion in marriage.

The Assyrians used to wash themselves daily, but chiefly after carnal
company.

As for the Saracenicall Religion, we shall more fitly handle the same by it
self, then tediously repeat the same things. For this therefore, and other
Countries subject to Turkish or Persian servitude, the Reader may read of
their superstitions in their due place, when we speak of the Saracens, Turks,
and Persians. The relation of their Christian Rites belong to another Tome.

But let us come out of Assyria into Syria; the Histories of which are not a
little, as is said, confounded together, and many Rites were common to them
both, and to all these parts, from the Persian gulf to Asia the less, as
being so often subject to one Empire, or rather still parts of that one Empire,
which received often alterations under the Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes,
Persians, Macedonians, Scythians, Parthians, etc.

CHAP. XV.
Of Syria, and the ancient Religions there: of the Syrian Goddess; and her
Rites at Hierapolis: Of the Daphnean, and other Syrian superstitions.

SYRIA is called, in Scripture, Aram, of Aram the son of Shem, Genesis 10. 22.
as before is said. And Strabo ( lib. 1.) calls the Syrians Arammaei. Hence
also his Arinsi are derived and Arami ( lib. 13.) It is diversely bounded by
diverse Authors: some confounding the names of Syria and Assyria. Eustathius
does reckon these five parts thereof, viz. Commagena, Seleucide, Coelesyria,
Phoenicia, and Iudaea. Mela extends it further, lib. 1. and Pliny, lib. 5.
cap. 12. names, as part of Syria, Palaestina, Iudaea, Coele, Phoenice,
Damascena, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Sophene, Commagene, Adiabene, Antiochia. And
in this large sense does G. Post. Bar. Sir. descrip. Broc. descrip. Ter. san.
Postellius and Brocardus stretch it beyond Tigris Eastward from the
Mediterranean sea, and from Armenia to Arabia. But Dom. Niger, and before him
Lib. 5. c. 15.
Ptolomey (whom we especially follow) make it abutte on the North upon
Cilicia, and part of Cappadocia, by the Mount Amanus; on the South, upon
Iudaea, and part of Arabia Petraea; on the East, upon Arabia Deserta and
Euphrates; on the West, upon the Syrian sea.

This Country is thought to have been the habitation of our first parents,
before the Flood, and of Noah and his sincerer family (as we have said)
after. Yet how soon, and how much, they degenerated in the wicked offspring
of cursed Cham whose posterity peopled a great part hereof, till they were
thence by the Israelites expelled, the Scripture is sufficient record. Yea,
even from Noah's time did they derive their Idolatry, as appears by Lucian.
de D^ a Syria.
Lucians narration of the Syrian Goddess, which he partly saw with his eyes,
and partly received of the Priests report. This Goddess was with godless
Rites served and observed at Hierapolis; which, although Strabo Lib. 16.
places it beyond the River in Mesopotamia, is by Pliny Lib. 5. c. 23.
accounted in Coelesyria, called also Bambyce, and, of the Syrians themselves,
Magog; and by Ptolomey named among the Syrian Cities of the division
Cirristica, in 71. 15. Longit. and 56. 15. Latit. And Lucian (who himself was
there; for Gilh^ Cognat. in Annot.
he calls himself an Assyrian, and was borne at Samosata in Commagena)
places it on this side the River. Pliny and Strabo (deceived in the name)
mention the worship of Atargatis (called of the Greeks Derceto) in this place:
but Lucian (other-where a scoffer, here an Historian) at large describes it,
making this difference between This and That, that Atargetis was half a fish,
but the Syrian Goddess wholly resembled a woman.

The City he thinks to have received the name Hierapolis (Holy City) of
these holy things here observed; in which respect in gives place to none other
place in Syria: having a stately Temple, enriched with gifts, Statues, and (as
they esteemed them) Miracles. Arabia, Phoenicia, Babylonia, Cappadocia,
Cilicia, and Assyria brought her Presents, and celebrated her solemne-Feasts.

This Temple was (in the Syrians opinion) first founded by Deucalion, whose
History you would think Lucian had learned of the Hebrews, not of the
Syrians, or Greeks; so lively does he express the infidelity and cruelty of
the old World; the manner of the Flood; the Arc wherein, with himself, his
wife, and children, he saved also all other creatures that lived on the earth,
which came to him by couples, by dispensation of Jupiter. Hereunto these
Hierapolitans add, That in their Territory was made a great Clift, which
swallowed up those waters: which Clift (but then very little) was showed to
our Author: to whom also they reported, That, in memory hereof, Deucalion
instituted that Rite, which to his time continued; that twice every year, not
the Priests only, but many out of all Syria, Arabia, and beyond Euphrates,
went to the Sea, and from thence brought water, which they poured down in the
Temple which he had built over that Clift unto Juno; all which water was
received into the same.

Some ascribe the building of this Temple to Semiramis, in honor of her mother
Derceto: others to Attes, for the worship of Rhea: which Attes was a Lydian,
and was author of the superstitions of Rhea, to the Phrygians, Lydians, and
Samothracians: but the opinion most probable was, that Dionysius or Bacchus was
founder of it; two substantial witnesses, besides others, affirming the same,
namely two Phalli, or Priapi (huge Images of the privy part of a man) erected
at the entry of the Temple, with an inscription, That Bacchus had consecrated
them to Juno. That ancient foundation being consumed by time, this later
Temple was erected by Queen Stratonice, who being in a dream enjoined this
office of Juno, and, for neglecting the same, punished with sickness, vowed
upon her recovery to perform it. The King joined in Commission with her, as
General of his Army, and ouerseer of these holy works, a beautiful young
man, named Combabus: who fearing what might happen, gelded himself, and
closing those his dismembered members (first for their preservation embalmed) in
a box sealed, as some great treasure, he committed to the Kings fidelity, to
be safely reserved to his use. Which his practice saved his life accordingly,
being after produced to clear him of adultery with Stratonice, which had been
laid to his charge by his envious accusers, and by the jealous King greedily
apprehended. In memory whereof, a brazen Statue of Combabus was set up in this
Temple, and both then (whether to solace Combabus, or by inspiration of Juno)
and yearly ever after, many in this Temple gelded themselves, and put off
together the nature and habit of men, attyring themselves like women. These
Man-women Priests were called Galli.

The Temple was built in the midst of the City, compassed with a double
wall; the Porch looking Northwards, almost an hundred fadome high; where stood
those Priapi aforesaid, about the height of three hundred fadome: up to one of
these one ascends twice a year, and abides in the top thereof seven days.
He carries with him a long chain, which he lets down, and thereby draws
up to him such things as he needs. Many offer Gold, and Silver, and Brass,
and one appointed receives their names, which he shows to him above, and he
makes his prayers for every of them, sounding, while he prays, a little
Bell. The Temple within shines with gold, and the Roof is wholly of this
Metal; it yields so fragrant a smell, that the Garments of those, which
come thither, retame this sent long after.

There is also another inner Room or Quire, whereinto the chief of the
Priests only have entrance; yet is it open without any door. In this
Sanctuary are the Images of the Gods; Jupiter, supported with Bulls, but Juno
sits upon Lions, holding in one hand a Scepter, and in the other a Distasfe,
in some thing or other resembling diverse other Goddesses, by the Egyptians,
Indians, Armenians, Babylonians, Aethiopians, and Medes, adorned with many
Jewels: and among the rest she has on her head a stone called the lamp, of
the effect, yielding light in the night season, as if all the Temple were
hanged with Lamps. This statue goes twice a year to the sea, for the water
before mentioned: neither of the Syrians is called by any name, but only the
Image, not expressing of whom.

In the temple is the image of Apollo clothed, with a beard, (contrary to the
custom of the Greeks, and in a far more glorious manner) giving forth
Oracles: for it moves it self, which, the Priests espying, lift it up alost
(otherwise it sweateth and moves it self forward nevertheless) and being
thus supported, it turns it self and them about, and leapeth from one place
to another. Then does the chief of the Priests, make supplication and request
for all things: which if it misliketh, it goes backwards; if it approves, it
carries them forwards: and without these Oracles they enterprise nothing
neither private nor sacred: and Lucian says he saw it leaving the Priests
(the supporters) and moving it self above in the air. Here are also the
statues of Atlas, Mercury, and Lucina, and without, a great brazen Altar, and
many brazen images of Kings and Priests, and many others recorded in poets and
histories. Among others stands the image of Semyramis pointing to the temple
with her finger, which (they say) is the sign of her repentance, who having
given commandment to the Syrians, to worship no other God but her self, was
by plagues (sent from heaven) driven to revoke that former edict, and thus
seems to acknowledge and point out another Deity. There were also places
enclosed, wherein were kept and fed; sacred Oxen, horses, Eagles, Bears, Lions.

The Priests were in number above 300. some for killing sacrifices: some for
offerings: some ministering fire to others at the altar: their garment all
white: their head covered: and every year was chosen a new High Priest, which
alone was clothed with purple, and a golden head-tire. A great multitude there
was besides of Musicians, Galli, and Prophetical women: they sacrificed twice
a day, whereat they all assembled. To Jupiter they use neither song, nor
instrument, in sacrifice: as they do to Juno.

Not far hence was a lake of 200. fadome depth, wherein were preserved sacred
fishes, and in the midst thereof an altar of stone, crowned always with
garlands, and burning with odours. They have a great feast which they call the
going down to the lake, when all their idols descend thither.

Their greatest and most solemn feast was observed in the spring, which they
called the fire: which they solemnifed in this sort. They felled great trees,
and laid them in the Churchyard (as we may term it) and bringing thither
goats, sheep, and other beasts, they hanged them on these trees; and together
with them, fowls, and garments, and works of gold and silver, which being
set in due order, they carry the images of the gods about the trees, and then
set all on fire. They resort to this feast out of Syria, and the coasts
adioining, and bring hither their idols with them: and great multitudes
resorting to the sacrifices, the Galli, and those other sacred wights beat and
wound each other. Others play on instruments, and others, ravished by divine
fury, prophecy: and then do the Galli enter into their orders: for the fury
rauisheth many of the beholders. Whatsoever young man comes prepared to this
purpose, hurling off his garments, with a great voice he goes into the
midst, and drawing his sword geldeth himself; and runs through the City,
carrying in his hands, that which he would no longer carry on his body. And
into whatsoever house he casts the same, he receives from thence his
womanish habit and attire. When any of them die, his fellows carrying him
into the Suburbs, cover him and his horse with stones, and may not enter into
the Temple in 7. days after: nor after the fight of any other carcass in one
day, but none of that family where one has died, in 30. days: and then also
with a shaven head. Swine they hold for unclean beasts. And the Dove they
esteem so sacred, that if one touch one against his will, he is that day
unclean. This causes Doves in those parts to multiply exceedingly: neither
do they touch fishes: This because of Derceto, half a woman, half a fish:
that, for Semiramis which was metamorphosed into a Dove. Eusebius de praep. l.
8. c. 5.


Many are the ceremonies also to be performed of the religious Pilgrims, or
Votaries that visit this holy City: for before he sets forth, he cuts
off the hair of his head and brows, he sacrifices a sheep, and spreading
the fleece on the ground, he kneeleth down on it, and lays upon his head
the head and feet of the beast, and prays to be accepted: the rest he
spends in the banquet. Then does he crown himself, and his fellow
pilgrims, and after sets forward on his pilgrimage, using for his drink and
washing cold water, and sleeps always on the ground till his return home.
In this City were appointed public Hosts, for diverse Cities diverse, called
Doctors, because they expounded these mysteries: They have also one manner of
sacrificing, to hurl down the beasts destinied hereunto, from the top of
the porch, which die of the fall. They have a like rite to put their Children
in a Sack, and carry them down, branded first on the neck or palm of the
hand: and hence it was that all the Assyrians were branded. The young men also
consecrated their hair from their Nativity, which being cut in the Temple,
was there preserved in some box of gold or silver, with the inscription of
the owners name thereon. And this did I (says Lucian) in my youth: and my
hair and name remain in the Temple still. Of Atergatis see more in the
chapter of Phoenicca.

Suetonius tells of Nero, that he contemned all Religions but this of the
Syrian Goddess: of which also he grew weary, and defiled her with Urine.
After which he observed a little Needle, supposed to have a power of
fore-signifying danger: and because soon after he had it, he found out a
conspiracy intended against him, he sacrificed thereto three times a day.

Plutarch De conso' at. ad Ap.
calls the Syriane an effeminate Nation prone to tears: and says, that some
of them after the death of their friends have hidden themselves in Caves, from
the sight of the sun many days.

Antiochia built by Selencus, (to whom, in honor of his memory, in mount
Cassius they observed sacred solemnities, as to a demigod) sometimes the seat
royal of the Syrian Kings, third City of the Roman Empire, third seat of the
Christian Patriarchs, and first, where that melodious name of Christian was
heard: is now the Sepulcher (says Boterus) of it self, or, (as Niger) a
greater wilderness, wherein it self is least part of it self, being left
but a small Village (says Cartwright.
another) in the midst of it is own walls.

About five miles from Antiochia, was that fair and sacred Daphne, which
Ortelius in his Theater has presented to the spectators, with a peculiar
description, and of which the elder Authors S^zomen. l. 5 18. Niceph. l. 10.
c. 18. Euogr. l. 1. c. 16. Strab. l. 16.
have plentifully written. It was 10. miles about: a place every way environed
with many stately Cypresses, besides other trees, which suffered not the Sun
to kiss their mother (Earth:) whose lap was according to the diversity of
the season replenished with variety of flowers, her breasts flowing with
streams of watery nourishment. A spring there was, deriuing (as men supposed)
her water from the Castalian Fountains, to which ancient superstition (and
therefore superstitious Antiquity) attributed a divining faculty with like
name and force to that at Delphos. This also was furthered by the Legend of
Daphne, Ov. Metam. l. 1
recorded by the Poets, believed (and what will not Superstition believe, but
the truth?) by the credulous multitude: who was said to have fled from Apollo,
and here turned into a tree. But thus could not Apollo be turned from his
love, which he continued both to the Tree and place. This was Lettice suitable
to the lips of vain youth. Ter. in Eunicho.

There needed no other lecture of sensuality to them, then this Legend,
especially in this school, where every place might be a place of argument
(under presence of reason and religion) to shut true Religion, and reason out
of the place, especially with scholars greedy of this conclusion.

Here you might have heard the whisking winds in a murmuring accent breathing
this lustful Oratorie: the Enamelled floor did offer her more then officious
courtesy, (a soft, sweet, and inlayed bed) to lie in; the air with
Temperature, seemed to further Intemperance: The eye of the Day, and watchmen
of the Night, were prohibited by the Cypress roose, with their unwelcome
light, to restifie those works of darkness, which those guilty boughs covered
from discovering: Once, the concurring objects of each sense, did in silence
speak and persuade to sensual pleasure, insomuch that by a general Decree,
Temperance and Temperate men were hence exiled, and scarce would the vulgar
allow him the name of a man, which here would not be transformed into a beast,
or would presume, without a Curtesan, to tread on this holy ground. Needs must
they go whom the devil drives: such God, such religion. Here were erected
sumptuous buildings: the temple of Apollo Daphnaus, with a stately Image
therein; the work (as was thought) of Seleucus: also Dianas chapel and
sanctuary. Julius Capitolinus writes that Verus a voluptuous Emperor spent
his summers here, and wintered in Antioch. Seuerus (more truly answering his
name) did to death certain Tribunes (says Lampridius) by whose negligence the
Soldiers here were suffered to riot. The Oracles added renown to the place,
which were deluered out of these Daphnaean waters by a certain wind or
breath. Hadrian the Emperor is reported to have hence received the faculty of
Divining, by dipping a Cypress lease in the Fountain. Julian resorted hither
often for that purpose. But his elder brother Gaellus, whom Constantius had
called to be Casar, and after (says Ammianus) for his outrages executed, had
in the time of his abode at Antioch, removed the bones of Babylas their Bishop
and other holy Martyrs his companions in suffering, to this place, where also
he built a church. Now when as Julian in his Persian expedition had sent others
to visit all the other Oracks in the Roman Empire, himself here consulted
with Apollo, (an Apostata Emperor with an Apostata Angel) about the success
of those wars. But all his sacrifices obtained no other answer, then that he
could not answer, by the countermaund of a more divine power there living in
those dead bones. Hereupon Julian commanded the Christians to remove those ill
neighbors: which they did (says Theodoret,) with a solemn procession,
singing the Psalms, and dancing with the heart of Danid; making this the
burden, and foot of each verse, Confounded be all they that worship graven
images: where with Julian, enraged, persecuted the Christians. Euagrius
affirms, that he built a temple in honor of Babylas: how truly, I know not.
But the True GOD confounded both the Idol and Idolater, shortly after, calling
the one to give account of his-ill employed stewardship; uncertain whether by
divine or humane hand: and for the other, his temple was consumed with fire
from above, together with the Image, one pillar whereof remained in Chrysostomes
days. The Pagans attributed this fire to the Christians: and no marvel: for
what did not that fire of blind Idolatry (kindled with Zeal) attribute to the
innocent Christians? herein testifying that it came from hell, and must to Hell
again, by that hellish Character and impression, of so great fire, and as
great Darkness. Such is Hell, and such is ignorant Zeal: a fire but no light.
Apollos priest by no torments could be forced to contesse any author thereof:
and the officers of the temple affirmed it was fire from heaven, which certain
country people confirmed by their own sight. Julian to satisfy his rage
caused some temples of the Christians to be burned. Nicophorus Nic.l.16.23, and
17.14.
tells of the continuance of this Daphnaean grove, honored with Buildings
and spectacles, by Mammianus and Chosroes. Apollo's image was made of wood,
covered over with gold. Theodosius forbade the cutting of any of those
Cypresses.

Orontes is a river which arises in Coelesyria, and pays Tribute to all the
three Brethren: it visits Pluto's palace, running with a long tract under
the Earth, and then heauing up his head, makes his gladsome homage to Jupiter;
and after his customs paid to the Antiochians, in fine pours himself into
the lap of Neptune, entering the Sea near to Seleucia. Strab.l.16.
It was called Typhon, until Orontes, building a bridge over it, caused it to
be called by his name. They had here a tale of Typhen a huge Dragon, which
divided the earth, as he went seeking to hide himself, and perished by the
stroke of a thunderbolt. Thus did he indent a passage for this river. Not far
hence was a sacred Cave called Nymphoeum: also Mount Casius, and Anticasius,
and Heraclia,: and nigh thereto the temple of Minerus. In Laodicea was this
Goddess honored, to whom they offered Eus de laudib.constantini.
in yearly sacrifice in old time a maid, after that in steed thereof a heart.

I may here mention also that, which Tacitus Tacit.l.2.bist.
reports of the Mount Carmel (as he places it,) betwixt Judea and Syria,
where they worshipped a God of that name with Ethnicke rites. They had not any
Temple or Statue to this God, an Altar only and Reverence was here seen:
Vespasian did in this place offer sacrifice, where Basilides the Priest viewing
the entrals, foretold him of his good success. Laodicea, a city of Syria,
used this sacred butchery once a year, to offer a maiden in sacrifice: as
testifies Eusebius.de praep. Euang.l.4.c.8.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the Syrian kings, and alteration in Government, and Religion, in those
countries.

SYria quickly grew into peoples and kingdoms, although Time has long since
devoured both them and their memories. Of Menon the husband of Semiramis
(mentioned by Diodorus) is spoken before. Adadezer was in David's time, king of
Aram Zoba, which some take for Chobal in Syria, some for Sophene in Armenia,
and some for the Nubei: whatsoever they were, David made them tributarie Anno
mundi. 2903. Benhadad, Hazael, and others the scripture also mentions: but
certain succession we find not recorded of these Syrian kings, til the time
of Alexander, which conquering all from Macedonia, to India, by his inexpected
death, left his huge Empire to be shared among his chief followers. Seleucus,
the son of Antiochus, a Macedonian, first, master of the Elephants; then
Tribune; after that Deputy of the Babylonians, at last obtained the kingdom
of Asia, Anno M 3638. of whom Appianus thus vvriteth: The first King of Syria
after Alexander was Seleucus, called Nicator, because he was of very great
stature; and as a wild bull had in a sacrifice of Alexander broken loose, he
held him with both his hands. He built 16. Cities, called by the name
Antiochia, of his father Antiochus: and five Laodicea's, in memory of his
mother Laodice: nine Seleucia's of his own name: three Apamea's, and one
Stratonicea, after the names of his two wives. He prospered in his wars,
took Babylon, subdued the Bactrians; pierced to the Indians, which had slain
Alexanders governors (placed amongst them) after Alexanders death. He slew
Lysimachus, and seven months after was circumuented and slain of Ptolomie
(whose sister Lysimachus had married) being seventy three years old.

To him succeeded his son Antiochus, surnamed Soter. A. 3667. who had
obtained Stratonice his mother in law, of his father (moved thereunto by his
sons violent love, and his Physicians subtle persuasion.) His son
Antiochus Thees was (contrary to his name) poisoned by his wife: whose sons
Seleucus, Callinicus, and Antiochus succeeded: and after them Antiochus Magnus,
the son of Callinicus, who much enlarged his Empire, adding thereto
Babylonia, Egypt, and Judea: but inuading Graecia, provoked the Romans against
him, with whom he compounded on base and mean conditions: He did yet comfort
himself for his loss among his friends, saying, that he was Val.Max.l.4.c.1.
beholden to the Romances, that eased him of so weighty a burden, and lessened
his cares of government; (for they had coped him in a corner of his kingdom
beyond Taurus.) After this he was shine: exhibiting in himself a true example
of the worlds falsehood, that plays with Scepters, and vieth Diademes, using
men like Counters or Figures, in numbering and casting accounts, where the same,
with a little difference of place, is a pound, shilling, or penny, one, 10. or
100. And yet as earthly happiness herein comes short of heaven, that it is never
mere and unmixed, but has some sour sauce to relish it: so falls it as
far short of hell, that not only hope, but the most miserable hap, has some
glumpse of comfort.

But to come to our history. Antiochus his son, surnamed Epiphanes, and
after Epimanes for his furious insolence, (who began his reign A.M.3774.) was
first sent to Rome in hostage, for security of his fathers faith: and after
that Seleucus, his brother (which sent 2.Mac.3.
Heliodorus to rob the Temple at Jerusalem) had a while warmed the throne,
succeeded in the Syrian kingdom. Of him and his tyranny Daniel had long before
prophesied in the interpretation of Nahuchodonosors Image, Dan.2.
whose legs are interpreted to be this Syrian, and the Egyptian kingdoms,
both heavy and hard neighbors to the Church in Iudes lying betwixt them: but
more especially in his visions in the 7. chapter. Dan.724.
Where, after other things, he fore-telleth of the 10. horns, Trem.Iun. in
Dan. D.Downam of Antichrist. D.Willet on Dan.4.c.7.
which are the eight kings aforenamed, and two Egyptian Ptolomies, Euergetes,
and Philopater, in their times prevailing in Syrio, and infesting Judea. And
the last shall subdue three Kings, which were Ptolomey of Egypt, driven out of
Syria, Seleucus his brother, and Demetrius, to whom, after Seleucus, the right
of the Scepter belonged. His policy, and blasphemy, and tyranny, are also by
Daniel plainly fore-signified, and in their event as fully in the history of
the Maccabees related. There you may read his wicked life, and vvretched
death: He took Jerusalem Calu^s.
Anno M. 3781, and slew 80000. people, robbed the Temple of 1800. talents, and
of the holy vessels; polluted the Temple; forbade the Sacrifice; named it the
Temple of lupiter Olympius; forced men by tortures from their religion; with
other execrable outrages, which would require a just volume to describe.

As he was thus mad and raging against the true religion: so Atb.l.5.c.4.
Athenaus shows his vanity in his own, whose pompous solemnity at the
Daphnean feast he thus relates. Antiochus, in emulation to Paulus Aemilius,
proclaimed this solemn festiuitie in the Cities of Greece, and performed it at
Daphne. First passed in order 5000. men, armed after the Roman manner: next
followed 5000. Mysians, and 3000. Cilicians, with crowns of gold: of
Thracians, 3000. of Galatians 5000. of whom some had shieldes of silver. 20000.
Macedonians, and 5000, with shieldes of brass: after these, 240. couples of
champions which should fight in single combat. There followed 1000. Pisaean
horsemen, and 3000. of the City, the most whereof had crowns and vials of
gold, others trappings of silver: Next came the band, called Socia, nothing
inferior in pomp or number: then 1000. extraordinary, and another thousand
in the band called Agema. Lastly, the barded horses 1500. all these in purple
vestures, which many had embroidred, or embossed with gold: Chariots drawn
with 6. horses, ICO. and 40. drawn by four; one drawn by Elephants attended
with 36. other. The rest of the pomp is incredible and taedious: 80O. youths
with golden crowns: 1000. fat Oxen, and 300. persons to attend the sacrifices:
800. Elephants teeth. There were also the Images of all the gods, and Heroes
that can be reckoned, some gilded, some clothed with golden vestures, their
fabulous histories being with great pomp annexed. After all these, the Images
of 'Day, Night, Earth, Heaven, Morning, and Noone. Then came a 1000. boys,
each having a piece of plate of a 1000. drams: 600. with vessels of gold: 80.
women were carried in chaires footed with gold, and 500. in others footed with
silver, very sumptuously attired: 200. of them out of basins of gold strewed
sweet odours. These spectacles lasted 30. days. A thousand (and sometimes
1200.) halies or dining rooms, were furnished for bankets, the king himself
affecting too officious familiarity therein, visiting the tables of the baser
people. So base is the pride of Ambition, tempeting a confused distemper;
according (in a strange harmony) the harshest discord of proude-aspiring, and
dejected baseness; where a base and servile mind begets pride, and pride
produces a servile baseness, a changeling, which the doting world fathereth
on Humility.

Of the death of this Antiochus, the former and second books of the Machabees
seem to disagree: and, which is more strange, the second book in the first
chapter says, he and his company were destroyed in the temple of Nanaea in
Persia: and in the ninth chapter says, that in Media, at Ecbatana, he was
smitten with an uncouth disease, and a fall from his Charlot, whereof he died.
Some Mel.Canus, loc.l.2.C..11
that would have this history Canonical, apply it to two Antiochi, as Lyra and
Rupertus, and after them Canus: but Bellarmine Bell de ver. L.I.C 15.
seeing that they will not agree with the times of any other, but Epiphanes,
proves himself Epimanes, and runs mad with love of that Trent-minion:
affirming that in the temple of Nauaea he fell, but escaped as Gen 14.16.
Lot when he was captiued, and after parished, as is in the after-part of the
history expressed; whereas it is there said, that they shut the doors on him,
and cut him and his fellows in pieces, and made them shorter by the heads: who
yet after this (forsooth) could go into Media, and there have a fall from his
Chariot. They must have no delicate stomachs, that will be Jesuits, any
thing must down, when they will up, especially, if Trent or the Vatican
command, though manifest reason and sense (that I say not, Religion)
countermaund. I envy not the red hat with these labels. Well fare that
modesty of the Author 2.Macc. 15.39
that confesses his weakness: but Anathema to their Anathema's, that enact
Conc. Trident.
contradictions to be Canonical.

I omit the successors of Antiochus, to wit, Antiochus, Dometrius, Alexander,
(who took away the golden Image of Victoria out of the temple at Antioch, in
his necessity: jesting that Jupiter had lent him victory, and when he would
have added Jupiter Justin.1..33.
to his sacrilege, was chased away by the multitude, and after slain by
Grypus.) The rest with the times of their reign are before expressed. Supra
tap.12
Pompey set an end to these Seleucidan Kings: and the Romans enjoyed the
countries of Syria, till the Saracens dispossessed them: whose history you may
read l.3.c.2.
in their due place. The Turks displaced those Saracens: the Christians of the
West, by war, made those parts Christian: but were expelled again by the
Turks, and they by the Tartars. The Mamaluke Lib.6.c.6.
slaves, and their Egyptian Sultan after, held the Syrian dominion, until
Selim the great Turk subdued it to the Ottoman Empire, under which it still
groneth. Of these things this our history will acquaint you in the proper
reports of these Nations.

Aleppo, is now chief City of Syria: but Damascus both in elder and later
times has borre the greatest name, being the head of Aram, as Es.7.8
Esaias affirms: called of Julian the City of Jupiter, and eye of the whole
East, Holy and Great. It is interpreted drinking blood, by Hier Com.in Ezec.l.8.
Hierom, who tells (from the Hebrews tradition) that in this field Kain
slew his brother: Chytr. Oilomastic.
Chytreus expounds it saccus sanguinis, Wolphij com. i.l2.Ke.16.
Wolphius deriueth it of two words, signifying blood and to spoil: which in
the times of Hazael and Benhadad, and of Resin it performed: but never so much
as when the Saracens made it the sink of blood and spoil, which they executed
on the Christians: and Noradine, Saladine, and the Turks, sitting themselves
and this City to the name, before the Egyptian Sultans, and Ottoman Turks
were Lords of it. Stephanus ascribes the name to one Ascus a giant, which cast
Dionysius there into the river: Or because Damascus, the son of Mercury,
coming hither out of Arcadia, built it: or because Dionysins their fleyd of
the skin of Damascus, which had cut up his Vines.

The Turks now call it, as Leunclanius and Chytreus testify, Scham, and so is
the whole region called in the Arabian Chronicle, whose extract you may find x
l.3.
in our Saracenicall history.

The Armies of David, Ahab, Teglath-phalasar prevailed much against it: The
Babylonians subverted it: After that the Ptolomeys repaired it: Pompey wanne
it: Paul hallowed it: The Saracens (as is said) polluted it. The Christians in
vain besieged it, in the year one thousand one hundred forty and seven. Chapter
Adrichom. ^beatrum Terrae sanct. Ty^bell. Sanst. libr.17. Herold contin.6.
Haalon the Tartar, one thousand two hundred threescore and two, obtained it,
and about one thousand four hundred Tamerlane besieged it; and as he had done
at Aleppo, filling the ditch with the bodies of captives and slain carkasles,
cast wood and earth upon them, and at last forced it and the Castle. He spared
the City for the Temples sake, which had forty Porches in the circuit, and
(within) nine thousand Lamps of gold and silver. But the Egyptians by a wile
possessing it, he again engirt it, and recovered it. He commanded Mahomet,
the Pope or Chalife, and his priests, which came to meet him, to repair to
the Temple, which they did with thirteen thousand Citizens, where he burnt
them all: and for monument of his victory, left three Towers erected of
skulles of dead men. The Egyptians regained and held it till Selim the Turk
dispossessed them 1517.

Now in thus many alterations of State, who doubts of diversity in Religions
in Syria: First, the true Religion in the time of Noab, and the first
Patriarchs. Next, those superstitions of Rimmon, and the rest before related,
in the Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman gouernements: After
which long night, the Sun of Righteousness shone unto the Syrians, and made
a more absolute Conquest then all the former, not by Legions and Armies, but by
a handful of Fishermen, (manifesting his Power in their weakness) the Reason
of Men, and Malice of Devils, not being able to withstand their Evangelical
weapons, which 2.Cor.10.5.
were mighty through GOD to cast down holds and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of CHRIST, Acts 11.20.
insomuch, that hence the Christianworld received first that name. And, how
sweet would thy name remain. O Syrian Antiochia, even now in thy latest
fates, which first wast christened with the name Christian, had thou not
outliued thy Christanitie, or rather; (after the soul departed) remained the
carcass of thy self; which ceasing to be Christian, have long since ceased to
be, had not the Divine hand reserved a few bones of thy carcass to testify
this his justice to the world! And what harmony could have been more
grateful to the Gentiles ears, then thy memory (Damascus) where the Doctor
of the Gentiles was first taught himself, and made a Teacher of others? But in
thee was the Chair of Pestilence, the Throne of Satan, the sincke of
Mahumetan impictie to the rest of the world, infecting with thy contagion, and
subduing with thy force more Nations then ever Paul by preaching converted.
Syria, first in the first and principal Privileges of Mankind, embracing in
her rich arms (if some be right Suruciours) the promised Possession (the
Seal of a further and better Inheritance) was with the first subdewed to
Saracene servitude: under their Caliph, under the Turks, under the Christians
from the West, under the Tartars from the East, under the Mamalukes from the
South, and from the North the Ottoman, by new successions and vicissitudes of
miseries and mischiefs, become a common Stage of blood and slaughter.

And in all these later changes of State, and chances of War, Religion was
the life that quickened those deaths, and whetted those murdering swords: no
cruelty or sacrilege against GOD, or man, so irreligious and inhumane, but
Religion was pretended to be the cause, and bare the Standard to Destruction; a
new Religion always erected with a new Conqueror. The rest of which, as
professing their own peculiar rites, have their peculiar standing in this
field of our Narrations assigned them: this one (which follows) as a
confusion and gallymaufry of diverse, I thought fittest here to insert.

The Drusians are accounted relics of the Latin Armies, which here warred
against the Turks for recovery of the Holy Land: These Giv.Bo.Ben^,
are circumcised as the Turks, they take the liberty of Christians, in
drinking Wine, and the licentiousness of beasts, in incestuous copulations
with their own daughters. They serve their own Lords, and are not subject to
the Turks. Their habitation is not far from Damasco. Knolles in his Turkish
History says, That the right Drusians are not circumcised, otherwise agreeing
with the former report; and adds: That they follow one Isman a prophet of
their own. A friend of mine, one master John Pountesse, who has been
acquainted with them, says they are circumcised. Selim and Amurath labored to
deprive them of their freedom, which was in part by Turkish policy, and their
own discords, achieved by Ebratm the Turkish Bassa Anno 1585. Only Mon-ogli
or Ebneman, a Drusian Lord, kept himself out of his hands, and deluded his
subtle practices: And thus these Drusians. with some Arabians in the midst
of the Ottoman Empire, retain some freedom from the Turkish thraldom.

Maginus says, That Tyrus, now called Suri, or Sur, is an habitacle of those
Drusian Robbers. Some place them between Ioppa and Damasco: I though this the
fittest place therefore for their mention, as being accounted to Syria, and
neighbors to Damasco, and of this hotch-potch Religion.

CHAP. XVII.
Of the Theology, and Religion of the Phoenicians.

PHoenicia is the Sea coast of Syria, after Pliny, or that coast and tract
bordering on the Sea from Orthosa (now Tortosa) to Pelusium. Strabo lib. 16.
Sachoniatho a Eusebius. de praep. Euang.lib. 1.ca,6. and 7.
Phoenician, supposed to have lived before the Trojan war, wrote in his own
language, the History of his Nation, which Philo Biblius translated into
Greek. This Philo in the beginning of his Work says, That his Author,
Sachoniathe, as he was generally learned, so especially he searched out those
things, which Taantus, called of the Egyptians Thoyth, of the Greeks Mercury,
the first inuenter of Letters, had written: he also blamed those, that by
Allegories and Tropologies pervert and obscure the History of their Gods;
affirming plainly, That the ancient Phoenicians, Egyptians, and others
adored those men for Gods, that had been the Authors of good things to men,
applying to them also the names of those Natural Gods, the Sun, Moon, etc.
so making some Gods mortal, some immortal. According to this Taautus
therefore, the first beginnings of all things were a dark disordered Chaos,
and the spirit of the dark air. Hence proceeded Moth, which we may interpret
Mire, from whence issued the seeds and generation of all creatures in the
Earth and Heaven. The Sun by his heat separating these new-formed Creatures,
their conflict in the air produced Thunder, which noise awaked, and caused to
leap out of their earth, this slimie generation; after of the Wind Colpia,
and Baan (which signifies Night) were borne men, named Age and Firstborn, of
whom descended in succeeding generations those Giants, that left their names
to the hills where they dwelt, Cassius and Libanus, that contended against
their brother Vson, who first adventured the sea in the bodies of trees burned,
(in which manner the Indians, even yet, make their canoas or boats) and he
erected two Statues to the Wind and the Fire, whom he adored with the blood of
beasts.

These first men after their death had Statues consecrated to them by
posterity, and yearly solemnities. To these succeeded others, inuenters of
Arts, hunting, fishing, building, yron-workes, tents, and such like. To Misor,
one of these, was borne Taautus, first Author of Letters. At that time was
borne Elius, and Beruth his wife, which dwelt in Biblos, the Parents of Caelus,
and Terra, (his wife and sister) who deified with rites and ceremonies their
father Elius, being torn of wild beasts. To these were borne Saturn, Batilus,
Dagon and Atlas.

But Caelus taking other wives, there arose a great quarrel betwixt him and
his former, aided herein by her sons: of whom Saturn the eldest, created
Mercury his Scribe, by whose Magical Arts, and by those Weapons (first by
him, and Minerua the daughter of Saturn devised) Coelus was overthrown: who,
after two and thirty years war betwixt them, was taken by his son, and
deprived of his genitories.

Saturn had issue (besides his daughters Minerua and Proserpina) Amor, Cupido,
Saturn, Jupiter Belus, and Apollo, of his sisters, Ascarte, Rhaea, Dione. Then
also were borne Typho, Nereus, Pontus, the father of Neptune. Saturn
suspecting his brother Atlas, buried him in the ground, and cast up a high hill
over him: where, not long after, was a Temple erected to him. Dagon was
inuenter of Tillage; and therefore called Jupiter Ar^trius.
Jupiter of the Plough. But Saturn becoming a great Conqueror, bestowed
Egypt on Taautus or Mercury, who first made a mystery of their Theology, as
the son of one Thaion first did among the Phaenicians; applying allegorical
interpretations thereof to Nature; and instituting rites to Posterity. This
allegorical Theology of Taantus was interpreted by Surmobolus and Thurro. It
follows in the History, That it was then a custom, in great calamities, for
the Prince to appease the angry Demon with his best beloved son, and thus
(in the time of a perilous war) was Lewd the son of Saturn, by a Nymph,
named Anobreth, clothed in royal apparel, offered on an Altar erected for
that purpose. This was practiced long after by the King of Moab 2. King. chap.
3. who being besieged by three Kings of Israel, Judah, and Idumaea, sacrificed
his eldest son: which yet some interpret of the eldest son of the King of
Idumaea.

Taautus ascribed Divinity to the Serpent, Trem. and Ius.
as being of a most fiery and spiritual nature, moving it self swiftly, and
in many forms, without help of feet, and a creature which renews her age.
The Phaenicians and Egyptians followed him herein, they calling it a happy
Spirit or GOD; these, Eneth, and framed thereto the head of a Hawke: of which
in his place we have spoken. And thus far have we been indebted to Eusebius.de
praep. Euang.lt. I. In the time of those wars betwixt Saturn and Caelus was
borne Hercules: to whom was a Temple of great Antiquity at Tire. To Hercules
were also celebrated games at Tyrus, every five years, to which Jason sent
three hundred drammes for a sacrifice 2. Mac. 4. 19. Hiram in Solomon's time
pulled down the old Temples of Hercules and Astarte, and built new. He first
erected a statue to Hercules, and in the Temple of Jupiter consecrated a golden
Pillar. Joseph. antiq. lt. 8.

The Sydonians also worshipped Astarte in a stately and ancient Temple to her
builded: whom Petr.Mart.Comm.in 1.Sa.7.
some interpret Luna, Ci. de Nature. deor.lib.3. So Chytraeus, and before him,
Eusebius and Plxutm in Mercator.
some Venus, and one of her Priests, to Lu^.Dea Sir. cum annotat. Gilberti
Cognat.
Lucian, Europa. It is more probable, that Astarte was Juno: for she was
worshipped of the Punickes (a Phaenician colony) by that name. Lucian says,
that he saw also at Biblos the Temple of Venus Byblia, wherein are celebrated
the yearly rites of Adonis, (who they say, was slain in their Country) with
beatings and woeful lamentings; after which they perform Obsequies unto him,
and the next day they affirm him to be alive, and shave their heads. And such
women as will not be shaven, must prostitute their bodies for one day unto
strangers, and the money hence accrewing, is sacred to Venus. Some affirm that
this ridiculous lamentation is made, not for Adonis, but Osiris; in witness
whereof, a head made of paper once a year in seven days space comes
swimming from Egypt to Byblos, and that without any humane direction: Of which
Lucian reports himself an eye-witnes. Hereby runs the River Adonis also,
which once a year becomes red and bloody: which alteration of the color of
the water, is the warning to that their Mourning for Adonis, who at that time
they say is wounded in Libanus: whereas that rednes arises indeed of the
winds, which, at that time blowing violently, do with their force carry down
along the stream a great quantity of that red Earth or Minium of Libanus
whereby it passes. This constancy of the wind might yet seem as marvelous
as the other, if diverse parts of the world did not yield us instance of the
like. In Libanus also was an ancient Temple dedicated to Venus by Cinyras.

Astarte or Astaroth was worshipped in the forms of sheep, not of the
Sydonians only, but of the Philistims also. I. Sam. vlt. in whose Temple they
hanged the armor of Saul. And wise Solomon was brought by doting on women to a
worse dotage of Idolatry 1.Reg., 11.5.
with this Sydonian idol among others. And not then first did the Israelites
commit that fault, but from their first neighborhood with them, presently after
the days of Joshua. Iud.2.13.
This Sidon, the ancient Metropolis of the Phoenicians (now called Saito) in
likelihood was built by Sidon, eldest son of Canaan, Genesis 10.15. and fell to
the lot of Asher. Iof. 16. 28. whence it is called Great Sidon. It was famous
Chytrays O. nomast.
for the first Glasse-shops, and destroyed by Ochus the Persian. This fair
mother yielded the world a daughter far fairer; namely, Tyrus, now called
Sur, (whose glory is sufficiently blazed by the Prophets Esuy, and Ezechiel)
being situate in an Island seven hundred paces from the shore, to which
Alexander in his siege united it; whom it held out eight months (as it had
done Nabuchodonosor thirteen years, which long siege is mentioned Ezec. 26.
7.) in nothing more famous, then for helping Solomon under Hiram their king,
Anno mundi. 2933. and d.
to build the Temple a hundred fifty five years before the building of
Carthage. This Hiram ( Iof.contr. Ap. libr..1.
Josephus reports it out of Dius a Phoenician Historiographer) enlarged the
City, and compassed within the same the temple of Jupiter Olimpius, and (as he
adds out of Menander Ephesius) therein placed a golden Pillar: he pulled
down the old temples and built new, and dedicated the temples of Hercules and
Astarte. Ithobalus, Astartes priest, slew Phelles the King, and usurped the
Crown. He was great grandfather to Pygmalion the brother of Dido, Founder of
Carthage.

The Phoenicians, famous for Merchandise and Marinership, sailed from the red
sea round about Afrike, and returning by Hercules pillars, arrived again in
Egypt the third year after, reporting (that which Herodotus Her.libr.4.
doubted of, and to us makes the Storle more credible) that they sailed to the
Southward of the Sun: They were sent by Pharao Neco. Cadmus a Phaenician was
the first Author of Letters also to the Greeks. At Tyrus was the fishing for
purple: not far off was Arad, a populous Town, seated on a rock in the sea,
like Venice.

Along the shore is Ptolemais, near which runs the River Belaeus, and
nigh to it the Sepulchte of Memnon having hard by it, the space of a hundred
cubits, Joseph. de bell. Iu libr.2.ra 9. Pli.5.19.and.36 26. Strabo 16.
yielding a glassie sand: and how great a quantity so ever is by ships carried
thence, is supplied by the Winds, which minister new sands to be by the nature
of the place changed into glass. That would seem strange, if this were not
yet stranger, that this new glass if it be cast upon the brinks of this place,
receives the former nature of sand again.

Belus and Hercules Tyrius and the Sun, called of them Heliogabalus, were
Phoenician Deities. Eusebius.de laudib.constant. orat.and de Prep. lib.4.ca.7.
Eusebius also relates other Phoenician abominations, both bloody and
beastly: the one in yearly sacrifice of the dearest pledges of Nature to
Saturn: the other in that temple of Venus, built in the most secret retreit of
Libanus, where Sodom (burned with fire from above, and drowned in a dead sea)
seemed to revive: such was their practice of impure lusts, intemperately using
the Natural sex, and unnaturally abusing their own: worse in this then the
Sodomites, that these intended sensuality; they pretended Religion. Constantine
rased these suburbs of Hell, and destroyed both the customs, statues, and
temple it self. Aug.de Ciui. Dei lib.4.ca.10.
Augustine says, That the Phoenicians prostituted their daughters to Venus,
before they married them. Of Melcanthor, Vsor, and other their gods (sometimes
men) I forbear to speak. Alexander Libr.2.ca.8.
ab Alexandro, affirms, That the priest of the Sun in Phoenicia, was
attired with a long sleeued garment, hanging down to the feet, and a golden
Crown.

We may add to these Phoenician superstitions, their mystical interpretation
by (...)
Macrobius. He expounds Venus and Adonis, to signify the Earth and the
Sun. The wild Boar which wounded Adonis, is the Winter, which for the
absence of her Lover makes the Earth to put on her mourning weeds (at whose
approach she af^^^ puts on her new apparel, says (...)
our English Arcadian Oracle;) This was shadowed in a certain Image in mount
Libanus, pourtrayed in mourning habit. And to this sense he applies the
Egyptian rites of Osiris and Isis, and of Orus, which is Apollo or the Sun,
and likewise the Phrygian mysteries of Atinis, and the mother of the Gods. He
says that they abstained from swines flesh.

The Philistims and all that Seacoast, by Strabo.lib.1^ P^n.li.5.ca.12.
Strabo and Pliny, are reckoned to the Phoenicians. Their original is
attributed to Misraim; They had five principal Cities, Ascalon, Accaron,
Azotus, Gath, Gaza. Of their sheepish Astarte ye heard even now, and of their
Legend of Dagon. Their superstitions the Scripture often Iud.16.23.1.Sam.5.2.
mentions. What this Dagon was (says Comm.Petr. Mart. in Ind.16
Martyr) is not well known. But by the deriuation of his name (which
signifies a fish) it seems he was a Sea-god. For such Sea-deities had the
Greeks and Latins, as Neptune, Leucothea, Triton: above his belly he was of
humane shape, beneath like a fish. Such is Idolatry, divine it will not be, it
cannot content it self with humane, but proves monstrous in the ugly and
deformed image, exhibiting the character of the true Author of this falsehood.
When Cicero Cic de Nature. deor. lib.3.
says, the Syrians worshipped a fish; it may be construed of this Dagon.
Happily (says Martyr Petr.Mart. com.in 1.Sam.5
) they intended Neptune, or I know not what Devil. Tremel. annot.in Iud.15. 23.
Drul.Quaest. beb.lib.1.q.82.
Tremellius thinks Triton. This may we see and say, when men are given over
to themselves, then they become beasts, monsters, devils: yea, worse then
such, for while they worship such, they profess themselves as Clients and
Votaries to be worse and baser then their Deities. Drusius deriueth not this
Dagon of Dag a fish; but of Dagan, which signifies Wheat, whereof Eusebius
says, Dagon inuento frumento and aratro vocatus est (...) and Philo Byblius,
Dagon, (...): that is, is called Wheat or Bread-corne.

When the Philistims had placed the captiued Arc in Dagons Temple, he fell on
his face before the Arc: But they placing him again in his room, with a
second fall, his head and hands were cut off upon the threshold: The stump (or
as Tremellius and Vatablus read it) Dagon, or that part of him which resembled
a fish, remained. And, therefore the Priests of DAGON, and all that come into
DAGONS house, tread not on the threshold of DAGON. Thus true Religion, the more
opposed, the more it flourished: the prisonhouse of her captivity is the
throne of her Empire: blind superstition, the more it is detected, the more
enraged, adds new devotion, to increase, not caring to amend the former.

Of Astaroth, we have before showed, why it is used in the plural number, as
Ribera in Hos.2.
Ribera affirms for her many Idols, as we say our Lady of Walsingham, our
Lady of Loretto, etc. The word Astar signifies a flock of sheep: and it is
likely, this their Juno was in the form of a sheep worshipped, as Jupiter
Ammon in likeness of a Ram. Their Dagon, it seems (seeming we have, no
true being nor being of truth, in Idols) was the same which Poets Metam.lib.4.
call Derceto or Dercetis, the mother of Semiramis, whose Image Lucian Luc dea
sir.
says he saw in Phoenicia, not unlike to that which is reported of the
Mermaid, the upper half like a woman, the other like a fish: (therefore of
Pliny Plin.li.5.c.25
called Prodigiosa;) in reverence of whom the Phoenicians were said to abstain
from fish. Authors do also call this Idol Atergatis: and Athen.l.8.c.6
Athenaeus reports, That the Country-lawe of the Syrians deprived them of
fish: and that Gatis (a Syrian queen) prohibited the eating of fish Ater
Gatis, that is, without Gatis, without her license, and therefore was called
Atergatis, as a forestaller of the fish to her own delicate tooth. Mopsus, a
Lydian, after drowned her in the lake of Ascalon, where this fish-deuourer was
of fishes devoured. They yet esteemed her a Goddess, and offered unto her
fishes of gold and silver: and the Priests all day long set before her true
fishes roasted and sodden, which after themselves did eat; and it is not to be
doubted but the mettall-mawes of those Ostriges could also digest the other.

Diod. Siculus Diodo.Sic.li.3.ca.2.
tells, That hard by a lake, full of fish, near unto Ascalon was a Temple
dedicated to this fish-woman: her Story follows, That she yielding to the
lust of a young man, had by that copulation Semiramis, whom (now too late
repenting of her folly, she exposed on the rocks, where she was nourished by
birds: of which birds (called in their language Semiramis) she received that
name. The Sheepheards after espying this hospitality of the birds, found the
child, and presented her to Simma the Kings shepherd, who brought her up as
his own daughter. The mother(not able to swallow her shame and grief) cast
her self into the lake to be swallowed of the water, but there by a new
Metamorphosis, was turned into a fish, and hallowed for a Goddess; and (for
company) the fishes of that lake, and the Birds of that Rock were canonized
also in this deifying devotion.

In Ascalon was a Temple of Apollo: and Herod father of Antipater,
Niceph.lib.1.ca.9.
grandfather to Herod the Great, hence called Ascalonita, was servant to
Apollo's Priest. At Accaron was worshipped Baalzebub, that is, the Lord of
Flies, Pet.Mart. in 2.Reg.1.
either of contempt of his idolatry, so called; or rather of the multitude of
Flies, which attended the multitude of his sacrifices; or for that he was their
Larder-god (as the Roman Hercules) to drive away slies: or for that
D.Chytr.on^mast.
form of a Fly, in which he was worshipped, as Nazianzeno against Julian
reports. He was called Sminibius or Myiothes: and was their Aeseulapius or
Physicke-god, as appears by Ahaziab 2.Reg.1.2.
who sent to consult with him in his sickness. And perhaps for this cause
the blaspheming Pharisees, rather applied the name of this then any other idol
to our blessed Savior, Matt.10.25.
whom they saw indeed to perform miraculous cures, which superstition had
conceived of Baalzebub, and if any thing were done by that idol, it could by
no other cause be effected, but by the Devil, as tending (like the popish
miracles) to the confirmation of idolatry.

What the devil had at Beelzebubs Shrine to this end performed, blinded with
rage and malice, they imputed to the miracles of CHRIST, which, in regard of
the Efficient, were more excellent then could be Satan's impostures, as
countermaunding him and all his proiects: for the matter, were merely
supernatural; in the Form were acted by his will, signified by his naked
word: and for the end (which is Deuteronomy.13.2.
the only touchstone for us to try all miracles) were to seal no other truth
then was contained (for substance) in the Law and the Prophets, whith he came
not to destroy, but to fulfill. If an Angel from heaven, yea with heavenly
miracles, (if it were possible) should preach unto us otherwise, Paul bids
us to hold him accursed: and cursed be that devil of Hell, that under color
of miracles (one of Antichrists ensigns, 2 Thessalonians. 2.9.) has taught the World
to worship the Lipsij vir go Halensis etc.
Lipsian Historia Lauretana Turselini.
Lauretan, and I know not what other Ladies: not that Virgin, on Earth holy, in
Heaven glorious; but their idol-conceits, and idol-blockes of her. Our Lord
has taught us plainly in Matthew, chapter 4. verse 10. to serve God only,
without sophistical distinctions.

As for these Heathenish and Popish, and all those other packets of miracles,
which we receive by the Jesuits annual relations from the East and West
Indies; I esteem them with Doctor Hall (a hall of Elegance, all-Elegance) Dec.
I. epi. 6. That they are either falsely reported, or falsely done, or falsely
miraculous, or falsely ascribed to Heaven. But I know not how (pardon it
Reader) I am transported to Hale, Zichem and Loretto, from our Phoenician
ports. The name of Beelzebub has been occasion of this parenthesis. But the
power of Beelzebub (I fear) has induced Bellarmine, to fall down, and thus
to worship, him, for his purple advancement. For amongst the Notes of the
Church, he has reckoned for one, this of miracles: Maiusipse miraculum, a
greater miracle he, that now will not believe without miracles that gospel,
which at first was thereby sufficiently proved. We read that the Matt.12.39
Jews seek for signs, and are therefore called, an evil and adulterons
generation; and not only Matt.24.24.
false Christ's and false Prophets, and Antichrist himself, but the heathens
had their Legends of miracles: as the whole course of our History will show.
Go now and reckon a Catalogue of miracles through all Ages, even to the time
of blessed Ignatius and his Society: and ask of us miracles for proof of our
doctrine. Our doctrine has already by the Apostles and Prophets (Penmen of
holy Scriptures) been proved that way; and we leave to you the style of
Mirabiliarij Miracle-mongers, which August. Tractat. in Io. 13. for like
bragges of things miraculous-ly wrought by them, gives the Donatists. With us,
Miracles must be proved by the Truth and the Church, and not they by miracles.
But let us come back to Phoenicia.

The Phoenicians are accounted first authors of Arithmeticke and Astronomy; as
also of the Art of Navigations ( Primaratem ventis credere docta Tyrus, says
Tibullus) and observed the North-starre to that Sea-skill. The Sidonians are
reputed first authors of Weights and Measures. Herod. Terpsic.
Herodotus affirms, That the Phoenicians, which came with Cadmus into Greece,
taught the Graecians both other Sciences, and also Letters, which before that
time they knew not. These letters after changed their sound and form, being by
the Ionikes principally learned, who called them Phoenician, and called their
Skins or Parchments biblos (happily of Byblos in Phoenicia.) He saw the Cadmean
letters engraven in a Temple at Thebes, much like the Ionike letters. Animad.
in E^seb. chron. page.103. and d. ad 113.
Scaliger has given us a view of the one and the other, the ancient Ionike,
then the only Greek letters, out of certain old inscriptions, much
resembling the present Latin letters; and the auncienter Phoenician (I may say
with him, the auncientest) used by the Canaanites and Hebrews of old, and by
the Samaritanes at this day: For those which the Jews now use, he affirms to
be new, corrupted from the Syrian, and these from the Samaritan. His learned
discourse thereof were worthy the reading, but here would be too prolixe.

Of the Phoenician Kings here might be inserted a large History; but I fear
tediousness. Their Catalogue is thus in Scaligers Can. Isagog.l.2.
Canons; first Abibalus, two years; Hirom, the son of Abibalus, 38. years;
Baleazaros, 7; Abdestartus, 9; the Nurces son, 12; Astartus Dalaeastri F. 12;
Aserymus, 9; Pheles, 8. months; Ithobaal, the Priest of Astarte, 32. years;
Bad^zorus, 6; Margenus, 9; Pygmalion, 47. In his time Dido fled into Lybia. A
long time after this reigned another Ithobalus 19. years; Baal, 10; and then
Judges ruled: Ecnibalus, 2. months; Helbes, 10. months; Abbarus the high
Priest, 11. months; Balator, 1. year; Mytgonus and Gerestratus, 6; Merbal
(sent from Babylon) 4; Hirom his brother, 20. Thus much out of the Phoenician
Antiquities: the rest of their History is for substance, the same with the
Syrian before handled.

Ioppe P.Mela.l.1. c.11.Plin.l.5. c.13.
(says Mela and Pliny) was built before the Flood; and Cepheus reigned there,
witness certain ancient Altars, there observed religiously, and bearing
titles of him and his brother Phineus. They show monstrous bones, the Relics
of the Whale, from which Perseus freed Andromeda. Mount Casius had in it the
Temple of Jupiter Casius, and Pompeyes Tomb.

CHAP. XVIII.
Of Palaestina, and the first inhabitants thereof, the Sodomites, Idumaeans,
Moabites, Ammonites, and Canaanites, with others.

PHoenicia is stretched by some (as you have read) even to Egypt, all along
that Seacoast, and in that respect partly, and partly because they observed
some neerenesse in Religion, I have adjoined the Philistims to the Phoenicians:
howbeit, others doc confine Phoenicia betwixt the River Valania and Mount
Carmel. Thus has Brocard. descript. Terrae sanc^iae, Magmud Geog^.
Brocard written, and after him Maginius; who do reckon unto Palaestina,
Galilaea, Samaria, Iudaea, and Idumaea, leaving out Phoenicia, bounded as
aforesaid, to make a part of Syria by it self. Of this Region I purpose to
make larger discourse in the next Chapter; here intending to rake out of their
dust the ancient Nations which inhabited this Land, before the Israelites were
Lords thereof. The Sodomites sometimes inhabited a pleasant and fertile valley,
watered by Jordan, which Moses compares Gen.13.10.
to the Garden of the LORD, and the Land of Egypt, for pleasure and plenty.
To the Sodomites I reckon also those other Cities partakers of the same
fertility and vengeance, Gomorrha, Adma, Zeboim, and little Zoar, saved at the
request of Lot. Their Kings and their Wars are mentioned, Genesis 14. Their
wickedness in many places of Scripture; which Ezechiel Ez.16.49.
reduces to these four heads, Pride, Gluttony, Idleness, and Cruelty, or
hard-heartednesse. Their judgment both Moses and others, and the place it
self do record. Their Religion was an irreligion, and profane contempt of
GOD and Man. Europe (I would I could not say England) can now yield the like:
saving that in our subtle, and more wary age, Policy, having eaten up
Religion, has with the blood thereof died her cheeks, and would seem more
shamefast then those former Sodomites. Thus did Es.1.10.
Esaias speak to the Princes of Sodom (in his time) and the people of Gomorah,
in respect of that their wickedness, which suruiued them, and has fructified
unto us, among whom yet the LORD of Hosts (as with them) has reserved a small
remnant from this worse plague then Sodoms brimstone, a Reprobate sense. The
difference betwixt ours and them is, that they were more open, ours more close,
both in like height. but not in like weight of wickedness; our darkness
excelling theirs both in the sin, and in the punishment, in as much as a
greater light has shined, which we withold in vurighteousnesse. And if you
will have the maine character of difference betwixt these and those; the one
were beastly Men, the other are Devils in the flesh.

First, from a spark of Hell Concupiscence, (guided by Sensual Lust, attended
by Pro.1.32.
Ease and Prosperity, and further inflamed and blown by the Devil) an
unnatural fire, (which still bears the name of Sodomie) was kindled, which
gave coals to a supernatural flame, rained by the LORD in Brimstone and Fire
from the LORD out of Heaven, and burning even to Hell again (the a and o of
wickedness) where they suffer (says Jude, v.7.
Jude) the vengeance of eternal fire. This 2. Pet.2.6.
is written for our learning, on whom the ends of the world are come, their
ashes being made an example unto them that should after live ungodly. Let not
any object the Preacher here, and require the Historian, seeing that History
builds not Castles in the air, but preaches both civil and divine knowledge
by examples of the passed, unto the present Ages. And why should not I preach
this, which, not my calling alone, but the very place it self exacteth?

They being dead, yet speak, and the place of their burial is a place to our
memory, being turned into a Sea (but a Dead Sea Jordan runs into the Dead
Sea, and there stays without issue to the Ocean.
) which covers their sins, that it may discover ours; which, as astonished
at their unnaturalness, has forgotten her own nature: It drowneth the Earth,
which it should have made (as whilome it did) fertile: it stays it self with
wonder and indignation, and falling in a dead swowne, sinketh down with
horror, not wakened, not moved with the winds blustering; refusing the light of
the Sun, the lap of the Ocean, the commerce of Strangers, or familiarity
of her own, and (as it happens in deep passions) the color goes and
comes, changing three times every day: it gaspes forth from her dying
entrails a stinking and noisome air, to the near dwellers pestiferous,
sometimes avoiding (as it were excrements) both lighter ashes, and gross
Asphaltum: The neighbour-fruits participate of this death, promising to the eye
toothsome and wholesome food, performing only smoke and ashes. And thus has
our GOD showed himself a consuming fire, the LORD of anger, to whom vengeance
belongs; all creatures mustering themselves in his sight, and saying at his
first call to execution, Lo we are here. That which I have said of these
miracles, still living in this Dead Sea, is confirmed by testimony of many
Joseph.de bell. Iud.l.5.c.5. Cornel.Tacit. bi^.lib.5. These two describe it at
large. Also Strabo, lib.16. Plin.lib 5.c.16. besides the modern and elder
Christians. Ptolo^ey places the midst thereof in 66.50. and 31 10. l.7.c.16.
Authors. Brocard tells of those Trees, with ashes, growing under Engaddi, by
this Sea; and a vapor, arising out of the Sea, which blasteth the
neighbour-fruits; and the Gen.14.10.
slime-pits on the brinkes of this Sea, which he saw. Neither strangers nor her
own have access there, where Fishes (the natural inhabitants of the Waters)
and Water-fowles (the most usual guests) have no entertainment, and men or
other heavy bodies cannot sink. Vespasian proved this experiment by casting
in some bound, unskillful of swimming, whom the waters (surfetted with
swallowing her own) spewed up again. The Lake, Josephus says, is five
hundred and fourscore furlongs in length ( Pliny has an hundred miles) the
breadth, between six and five and twenty miles, Strabo tells of thirteen
Cities still, (whereof Sodom was chief) of threescore furlongs compass;
whereof some were consumed by fire, or swallowed by Earthquakes and sulphurous
Waters, the rest forsaken: some Remainders (as bones of those carcasses) then
in his time continuing. L.Vert.l.1. c.9.
Vertomannus says, That there are the ruins of three Cities on the tops of
three Hills: and that the Earth is without water, and barren, and (a greater
miracle) has a kind of bloody mixture, somewhat like red Wax, the depth
of three or four cubits. The ruins of the Cities are there seen still.

Idumaea lies Southward from Iudaea: it had name of Edom, the surname of Esau,
son of Isaak. The History of this people, and the Horites, joined with them,
is related by Gen.36.
Moses. It was subdued by David, according to the Prophecy, The elder shall
serve the younger. They rebelled under Ioram the son of Iehosophat; as Isaak
had also prophesied. From that time they continued bitter enemies to the people
of GOD, Ios. Antiq.13. 17.
till Hircanus, the son of Simon compelled them to accept both the Jewish
Dominion and Religion: after which they were reckoned amongst the Jews. Of the
Idumaeans were the Amalekites, 1. Sam.15.
destroyed by Saul. They were South from Judah. Job.2.11.
Elphaz the Themanite, it seems, was of Esau his generation, and of the right
Religion. The Idumaeans, Moabites, and Ammonites are by some placed in Arabia,
of which I will not contend: I here mention them, as both borderers and
subjects to the Israelites; of which we read much in the Scripture; little
elsewhere that makes to our purpose. South from Amalek was Kedar, a country
abounding with flocks of Sheep and Goats. But I may not now dwell in the
Tenis of Kedar, till I come to the Ismaelites.

Moabltes and Madianites.
On the East side of the Lake of Sodom is that Region which the Moabites (so
often in Scripture mentioned) sometime inhabited: and before them the Emims,
which were Giants, tall as the Anakims, Deuteronomy. 2. 10. The Moabites were the
posterity of Lot, by incest with his daughter. Arias Montanus.
Moab had on the East the Mountains of Horeb; on the West the salt Sea, and
part of Jordan; Arnon on the South, and the North border stretched from Iabbok
to the Mountains of Pisga. That part of their Country, between Iabok and
Arnon, Sihon King of the Amorites had taken from them, and lost again to the
Israelites. Balac their King, fearing to loose the rest, sent for Balaam the
Wizard to curse the Israelites; who yet, by Divine power, was forced to bless
them. Yet the luster of Balacs promises so dazeled his eyes, that Apoc.2.14.
he taught Balac to put a stambling-blocks before the Israelites, and by
sending amongst them their women, to draw them to carnal and spiritual
whoredom; so to provoke the wrath of GODS icalousie against them. But the
zeal of Phineas stayed it; and Balaam, in his return home ward to his
Country of Mesopotamia, was slain by the Israelites among the Madianites,
partakers with the Moabites in Balaams idolatrous proicct. These Madianites
descended of Abraham, Abraham's children by K^urah were authors of the Nations
called Filij orientis, the children of the East, which inhabited the parts of
Arabia between the Moabites, Ammonites, and the Persians and Chaldaeans, from
Mesopotamia to the Persian gulf. Ar.Mont.Ch^n^^n.
by Keturah, and dwelt in a part of Arabia, near to the Moabites, on the East.
Some of them dwelt near to Mount Sinai, Exodus 2. 15. and in the Desert, on the
East side of the Red Sea. Their mighty Army was mira culously destroyed by
Iud.7.20.
the Sword of the LORD, and Gedeon. The Moabites were subjected to Israel by
David, and so continued to the Kings of Samaria, till, that State being rent,
they freed themselves. It seems they worshipped the Sun; as the names
Kirchereseth, Beth-Baalmeon, and Balacs high places do show, and we have
observed before in the worship of Bell and Baal. Chemosh was another Idol of
theirs, to which Solomon built an high place. Pehor also, and Baal pehor, and
the rest, whose Rites are now rotten, and the memory worn out.

In their rebellion against Iehoram King of Israel, he and Iehoshapat, King of
Judah, with the King or Viceroy of Idumaea, went to recover them by force. The
Moabite, in despair, offered a bloody Sacrifice of his eldest Son and
Heir; or, as Tremellius reads it, K^g3.27.
The King of Edoms son: which caused the Israelites return. The Ammonites
and Moabites might not enter into the Congregation of GOD, unto the tenth
generation, because Deuteronomy.23.3.
they met not the Israelites with bread and water in their way, when they came
out of Egypt, and for hiring Balaam against them. Ar. Montanus says, That the
Moabites were circumcised in imitation of the Israelites, but worshipped not
their God, but their own Idols.

The Ammonites succeeded the giants called Zamzummias, Deuteronomy.2.20.
The Ammonites (their brethren in the evil both of Lot their father, and their
own) inhabited Northward from Moab; on the East were the hills Acrabim; on the
West the Amorite; the hills Luith, Basan, etc. made it a valley. Their chief
City was Rabbath, after called Philadelphia. These Ammonites had been
troublesome to the Israelites, in the times of Iud.11.5.
Iephte and of 1. Sam.11.
Saul. And after, David in just revenge, for violating the Law of Nations,
destroyed them. Moloch, or Melchon, was their Idol, which is supposed P Mart.
in 2.Reg.2. Vatab. in Leu. 18.
to be Saturn, whose bloody butcherly sacrifices are before spoken of. It was
a hollow Image (says Lyra in Leu. 18.
Lyra) of Copper, in form of a man. In the hollow concauitie was made a fire,
with which the Idol being heated, they put a child into his arms and the
Priests made such a noise with their Timbrels, that the cries of the child
might not move the parents to compassion, but they should rather think the
child's soul received of the God into rest and peace: others A^et in Act. c.7.
ex P. Fag. resert l.White.
add, That this Moloch had seven Rooms, Chambers, or Ambries therein; one for
Meal; a second for Turtles; a third for Sheep; the fourth received a Ram;
the fifth a Calfe; the sixth an Ox: if a man would offer son or daughter, the
seventh was ready for that cruelty. Some interpret Moloch and Remphan, Act.
7. to be the Sun and Moon.

There was a valley near Jerusalem (sometimes possessed by the son of P.
Mart. in 2. Reg.2. Chytr. O^omast.
Hinnom) where the Hebrews built a notorious high place to Moloch: it was on
the East and South part of the City. It was also called Topheth, or Tymbrell,
of that TymbrellRite which those Corybantes and bloody Priests did use; or
else for the spaciousness of it. Ier.7.31,32.
Icremie prophecieth, That it should be called the Valley of slaughter, because
of the judgments for the idolatrous high places in it. Upon the pollution
hereof, by slaughter and burials, it grew so execrable, that Hell inherited the
same name, called Gehenna, of this place: first, of the lowness, being a
Valley: secondly, for the Fire, which here the children, there the wicked,
sustain: thirdly, because all the filth was cast out of the City hither, it
seemed they held some resemblance. The Ammonites also were (as Montanus
affirms) circumcised.

Canaan was the son of Cham, Father of many Nations, as Genesis 10.15.
Moses declares, Sidon and Heth, Iebufi, Emori, Girgashai, Hivi, Arks, Sini,
Arvadi, Zemari, Hamathi; the most of which were expelled their Country, slain
or made Tributarie by the Israelites. Their border was from Sidon to Gaza West,
and on the East side from Sodom to Lasha or Callyrrhoe. Antiq Iudaic. l 3.c.7.
Arias Montanus is of opinion, That according to the number of the twelve
Tribes of Israel, so were the people of Canaan: and therefore to those eleven
before rehearsed, he adds their father Canaan, who left his name to them all;
and where he lived, retained a part to himself, between the Philistims and
Amorites. Of those his sons, Sidon, the eldest, inhabited the Seacoast: and
Eastwards from him Heth unto the hill Gilboa: of him came the Hittites. Iebus
went further, on the right hand: Emor inhabited the mid-land Country Westward
from the Iebusites. The Girgashite dwelt above the Hittite, next to Jordan, and
the Lake Chinereth (so called, because it resembles the form of a Harp)
after called Gennezareth. The Hevite or Hivite inhabited between the Amorite
and the Philistim. The Arkite possessed the roots of Libanus. The Sinite dwelt
beyond the Hittite, Eastward, nearer to Jordan. Arvadi enjoyed the Country
next to the Wilderness of Cades. Zemari obtained the Hills, called of him
Scmaraim. The Hamathite possessed the Country nigh to the Fountains of
Jordan. As for the most notable Mountains and Cities, which each of these
Families enjoyed, they which will, may read further in the same Author.

Of these and their ancient Religions and Polities we find little or nothing
but in the Scripture, where the Lord testifies, that for their sins the Land
spued them out. Some of them (as some think) fled into Africa: where Augustime
Exposit.ep.ad Romans^nchoat.
says, That the Country people, inhabiting near Hippon, called themselves in
their Punicke Language Chanani.

Procopius, in the fourth book of the Vandale War, affirms, That all the
Seacoast, in those times, from Sidon to Egypt, was called Phoenicia: and that
when Joshua invaded them, they left their Country, and fled into Egypt, and
there multiplying, pierced further into Africa; where they possessed all that
Tract, unto the Pillars of Hercules, speaking half Phoenician. They built the
City Tinge or Tanger in Numidia, where were two pillars of White stone, placed
near to a great Fountain, in which, in the Phoenician Tongue, was engraven:
We are Canaanites, whom IOSHVA the Thief chased away. Which if it were so,
the name of Hercules might therefore be ascribed to those Pillars, as accounted
the chief Phoenician Idol.

Philo Pseudo Phile. de Ant. Bib.
(or the Author of those fabulous Antiquities) says, That the Israelites
found, among the Amorites, seven golden Images, called Nymphs, which, as
Oracies, directed them in their affairs, and wrought wonders: the work of
Canaan, Phut, Selath, Nebroth, Elath, Desvat, of admirable workmanship,
yielding light in the night, by virtue of certain stones, which could not by
metal be broken, or pierced, or be consumed by fire, but must needs have an
Angel to bury them in the depth of the Sea, and there let them lie.

This people was not utterly at once destroyed, but sometime, as in the days
of Iud. 4.2.
Iabin and Sisera, conquered their Conquerours, and retained some power and
name of a people, till the times of David, who destroyed the Iebusites, and
dwelt in the Fort of Sion, calling it after his own name, 2.Sam.5.7.
The City of David. And in the days of Solomon, Pharao, King of Egypt, took
and burnt Gezer, and slew the Canaanites that dwelt in the City, and gave it
for a present to his daughter, Salomons wife. And all the people that were left
of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Iebusites, whom the
children of Israel were not able to destroy, those did Solomon make tributaries
unto this day. 1. King. 9.16,20,21. The posterity of these servants of Solomon

ALL AGES, AND Places discovered, from the Creation, unto this present.
THE SECOND BOOK.
CHAP. I.
The Preface of this Book: and a Description of the Region of Palestina, since
called Iudaea, and now Terra Sancta.

IN the former book we have traced the footsteps of Religion, following her
in her wanderings from the truth, and her self through diverse Nations, till we
came into this Land, sometime flowing with milk and honey, whose first
inhabitants we last took view of. The Hebrews were, by the Sovereign Lord of
all, made heirs of their labors, and possessed both their place and wealth:
Houses and Cities which they builded not, Vineyards which they planted not, and
which is more, these were a type unto them of the true and heavenly Country,
which, not by their merits, but by the mere mercy of the Promiser, they
should enjoy. These did GOD choose out of all the kinreds of the Earth, to make
unto himself Exodus.19.5.6.
a Kingdom of Priests, a holy Nation, and his chief treasure above all
people, though all the Earth be his: He made them the keepers Rom.3.2.
of his Oracles, bestowing on them Rom.9 4.5.
the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law,
and the Service of GOD, and the Promises: of whom were the Fathers, and of
whom, concerning the flesh, CHRIST came, who is GOD over all, blessed for
ever, Amen. These things were not only communicated, but appropriated to them:
He Psalm.147.20.
showed his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments unto Israel: He
dealt not so with any Nation; neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Laws:
He was their Prerogative, and they his peculiar: In Psalm.76.1.2.
Iewrie was GOD known, his name was great in Israel: In Shalem was his
Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Sion. And CHRIST himself ratified it,
acknowledging himself Mat.15.24.
sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Rom.15.8.
a Minister of the Circumcision, and said to the Cananite woman which besought
him for her daughter, It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to cast
it to dogs. Such, in spiritual reputation before God were all people,
excluded (as unclean dogs) out of his heavenly Jerusalem, till this
Ephesians.2.14. etc.
partition wall was taken down, and they which had been far off, were made
near by the blood of CHRIST, who abrogated through his flesh that hatred, and
made of twain (Jews and Gentiles) one new man in himself. So that the
Gentiles (the name of all the world, excepting this people) which had been
without CHRIST, and aliants from the Commonwealth of Israel, strangers from
the covenants of promise, had no hope, and were without GOD in the world; were
now no more strangers and forreners, but citizens with the Saints, and of the
household of GOD: built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, JESUS
CHRIST himself being the chief corner stone. Let it not be tedious to hear of
this which the Angels rejoiced to learn, Ephesians.3.9.10.
a mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in GOD: and unto
principalities and powers in heavenly places, was made known by the Church.
But the word (whereby we have fellowship in this mystery) came out of Sion,
and the preaching began at Jerusalem. This (and not Rome) by the confession of
Espensaeus, a learned Papist, on 1. Tim.4. was Emporium fidei Christianae, and
Ecclesiae matter: The mart of Christian faith, and mother of the Church. Yea it
was Act^ 13.45.
necessary that the word of GOD should first be spoken unto them, which they
by incredulity put from themselves, and gave place to the Gentiles. Rom.11.22.
The fall of them became the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them
the riches of the Gentiles, as a glass wherein we may behold the
bountifulness and severity of GOD, and in both the deepensse of the riches of
the wisdom and knowledge of GOD, whose judgments are unsearchable, and his
ways past finding out. I may fitly compare them to Gideons Fleece, Iud.6.
which received the dew, when all the earth besides was dry, and after, it was
dry upon the Fleece only, when the dew covered all the ground. Sometimes they
alone received those dewes, shewers, rivers, seas of Saving bounty, and all
the world besides was a parched wilderness. Now Psalm.107.34, 35.
he turns the fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of the
inhabitants; but that wilderness he turns into pooles of water, and the dry
land into water-springs. He has Rom 9.24:
called them his people, which were not his people, and her beloved which was
not beloved; and where it was said, ye are not my people, there they are now
called the children of the living GOD. Thus has the Rom.11.3^.
shut up all under unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all, that his free
election might appear (not of works, lest any should boast themselves but) of
grace. Behold therefore, all Atheists, and wonder! The Jews branded with
judgment, wander over the world, the contempt of Nations, the skumme of
people, the hissing, derision, and indignation of men, for refusing him whom
they expect, denying him whom they challenge, hating him whose name is in life
and death unto them, the sweetest tune, and most melodious harmony, still
waiting for, and glorying in that Messiah, whom ( unknown) they crucified and
slew: and still pursue with the deadliest hatred in all his followers: God they
please not, and are contrary to all men. Yet such is Gods manifold wisdom in
his deepest judgments, that his enemies shall fight for him, even against
themselves: the Midianites Iud.8.
shall sheath their swords, which they have drawn out against God, in their
own bowels, and Christian Truth shall prevail, and let our Deuteronomy.32.31.
enemies themselves be judges. Out of their premises which they maintain, as
earnestly as thou (O Atheist) securely deridest, which they will seal with
that which thou make thy heaven, thy God; we will and do conclude, against
thee and them, that, in which, with which, for which we will live and die. Let
the old Testament yield the Proposition in prophecy, and the new Testament
will Assume in History, and even be thou the judge, if that Reason, which thou
have as a man, and peruertest as a Devil, will not by force of their
Scriptures, which they prefer before their lives, necessarily in the
Conclusion demonstrate the Christian Truth. Neither (I appeal unto our common
Reason) can thou more wonder at us for Believing, things in thy seeming
incredible, absurd, and impossible, then at them (upon such grounds which with
us they hold) not The Jew is a witness against the Atheist, that we feign not
those prophecies of Christ, seeing the Jew holds the prophecies dearer then
his blood, and yet hates Christianity more deadly then the Atheist.
believing.

For what believe we but, for the maine and chief points of our faith, are as
plainly in their Evangelical Prophets, as in our prophetical Evangelists? All
the History of Christ, in a more Divine way, seems rather told then
foretold, a History, not a Prophecy: as is casie by conference of both to
show, and thou, if thou be not idle, or wilfully malicious, may find.
That then which thou see come upon them, a spirit of slumber, eyes that they
should not see, and ears that they should not hear; which yet have the light
of the first Scriptures (had they not a veil over their hearts) the same see
in thy self, that when greater light does offer it self, willingly shuttest
thine eyes, as though there could be no light, because thou live in, and
love, thy darkness. It is the same hand that gives up both thee and them,
2 Thessalonians.2.
because ye will not believe the Truth, to be saved, to strong delusions, that
ye might believe lies, and be damned. To me, and all Christians, let the Jews
be both real and verbal teachers of the Truth, which they let fall, and we
take up; the one in their Oracles of sacred writ, the other in their
exemplary judgment. And to them, Let (O thou LORD of all hear and grant it)
let all Christians be that which Moses prophesied, Deuteronomy.32.21.
a provocation to emulation, not of envy and hatred, which hitherto has been
in these, amongst all the Christian enemies, the most implacable and
despitefull, but of imitation, that as Rom.11.
their casting away has been the reconciling of the world, their receiving may
be life from the dead, which Paul seems plainly to fore-signifie.

THus much being premised as a preparation to our Jewish history, which, as of
more importance then any other, deserves more ample view: let us in the next
place survey that country which their progenitors had with those privileges,
and their posterity (together with those privileges) have lost.

This country was first The name of the Country.
called the Land of Canaan, after that the posterity of Canaan, the son of
Cham, had possessed it. Moses and Joshua conquered it to the posterity of
Jacob, of whom it was called the Land of Israel: after the division of the ten
Tribes from the house of David by Jeroboam, in the time of Rehoboam the son
of Solomon, the name of Israel was more particularly appropriated to those ten
rebellious Tribes, and the other two were known by the name of the kingdom of
Judah. Yet Israel remained in a general sense the name of them all, especially
in the new Testament. Paul of the Tribe of Beniamine Rom.11.1. and 26.
calls himself an Israelite, and all Israel, says he in that Chapter, shall
be saved. After the Babylonian Ios.Antiq. 11.5.
captivity they were called Jews, of the chief and royal Tribe, and their
country Iudaea: It was also called Palaestina, of the Philistims, which
inhabited the seacoast. And after in the times of the Christians it was
generally called the Holy Land, Phaenicia also being under that name
comprehended. It is situated between the Mediteranean sea, and the Arabian
Mountains, Ptolomie Ptol.lib.7. cap.16.
calls it Palestina Syriae, and Iudaea, abutting it on the North with Syria,
on the East and South with Arabia Petraea, on the West with part of Egypt, and
the sea. Adrichomius, who has bestowed a large volume on this subject, which
he calls the Theater of the Holy Land, on the East confineth it with Syria
and Arabia; on the South the desert Pharan, and Egypt; on the North Mount
Libanus; on the West, the Sea. Maginus places a part of Phaenicia on the
North; on the North-east Libanus; on the South, and part of the East, Arabia;
on the West, part of the Mediteranean sea. It is extended from the South to the
North, from the one and thirtieth degree, to the three and thirtieth, and
somewhat more. Others set it down in other words; but these and they agree for
the most part, in substance. It is commonly holden to be an hundred and sixty
Italian miles in length from Dan to Bersebee, and sixty in breadth. An exact
division thereof into twelve shires or shares, Joshua sets down at large,
with their bounds and Cities, from the thirteenth Chapter of that book, to the
one and twentieth, as they were by lot and Divine dispensation allotted to the
twelve Tribes, the posterity of Jacobs twelve sons; only Ephraim and
Manasses, the sons of Joseph, constituted two Tribes, and therefore had the
double portion, descending of Jacobs eldest son, by Rachel his first intended
wife: and Leui had no portion, but was scattered in Israel, to keep Israel
from scattering, and to unite them in one religion, to one God, who disposed
that curse unto a blessing.

Ruben, Gad, and half the Tribe of Manasses, had their portion on the
East Side of Jordan: the other half of Manasses, with Simeon, Judah, Benjamin,
Ephraim, Naphthali, Aser, Dan, Izachar, Zabulon, had their portions assigned
betwixt Jordan, and the Western sea. They which would be fully acquainted with
their several divisions, may find in Joshua himself to satisfy them, and in
the Commentaries which diverse have written on that Scripture. More, Stella,
Adrichomius, and Arias Montansus have in Maps presented them to the eye.
Neither in the whole world beside is there (I think) found any region having
more Cities in so small a space, then this sometime had, except we believe that

Episcopal Cities in this Land, while it was Christian. My purpose is not to
write of all, but especially of such as are in some respect eminent.

And first let me dippe my pen in Jordan. This, says Pliny, Plin lib. 5. cap.
15.
is a pleasant River, and as far as the situation of places will permit,
ambitious; prodigally imparting it self to the inhabitants, and (as it were
unwilling) passes to that cursed Lake Asphaltites, of which at last it is
drunk up, losing his laudable waters, mixed with those pestilent. As soon
therefore as the valleys give opportunity, it spreads it self into a Lake
called Genesara, sixteen miles long, and six broad, environed with pleasant
Towns; Iulias and Hippo on the East; on the South, Tarichea; and Tiberias on
the West, made hole some with his hot waters. The fountains of this River are
two, called Ex sontis no^ac atque d^clius dis^en^a Iarden d^^tas. Ar. M^ntan.
Ior, and Dan, which compounding their streams, do also compound their names,
as Tame and Isis with us bring forth (happy parents) our Tames or Thamisis.
This is the beginning of the aparent stream: But the true Iu^.Ed Iud.lib. 3.

and first conception of it is in Phiale, one hundred and twenty furlongs from
Caesarea, a fountain of unsearchable depth, which yet (like some miserable
Churl) always contains the waters in it self, till sincking, and as it
were buried in the earth, those treasures being by Natures stealth conveyed
under ground, unto Dan or Paneas, who is liberal of that usurers wealth (for
into that Phiale power as much as you will, it never increases or decreaseth)
and thence it becomes a river. Philip the Tetrarch of Trachonitis, by casting
chafe therein, which was paid him again at Dan, first found out this
vnder-earth passage. The Saracens call that Phiale, in this respect, Medan,
that is, the waters of Dan. Before it makes the Lake of Genezareth, it makes
another called Samachonitis. This is especially filled, when the snowes on
Libanus are melted, which causes Weissenburg. and T^em. 1.C ^^^o. 12.15.
Jordan then to swell, and ouer-flow his banks, in the first month, yearly,
(and made the miracle in Ioshuas Josh.3.
passage through it the more miraculous) but in Summer it is almost drien up. It
is called the waters of Meron, halfe-way between Caesarea Philippi, where the
marriage between Ior and Dan is solemnized, and the lake of Genezareth. Elias,
and after his assumption, his cloak, divided these streams: Naamans Leprosy
was here cleansed; and a greater Leprosy then Naamans is daily cleansed in
the Church by the lauer of Regeneration, first sanctified to that use in this
stream, where the holy Trinity M^lth.3.
did first yield it self in sensible apparition to the world, thereby to
consecrate that Baptism, whereby we are consecrated to this blessed Trinity,
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In which respect, Adrichom. Timberley.
Pilgrims in memory thereof, do still wash themselves in this River, spotting
themselves further (I fear) by this washing with some mire of superstition.

I cannot blame this sacred stream, if it seem loath, as Pliny says, to
leave so fertile a country, and lingreth as long as it may in lakes by the
way, not only for that Salt sea or hellish lake, which shuteth up his
guiltless waves in perpetual imprisonment, but also for those pleasures in
the passage the fruits of the earth without exaction freely yielded, as Roses,
Sage, Rue, etc. of the trees, in Olives, Figs, Pome-granats, Dates, and Vines
(which last the Mahumetan superstition does not cherish, and the western
Christians did so husband, that one Vine Erocard.
by their art and industry, yielded three Vintages in August, September,
October.) The Grapes of Eshcol, which could lade two men with one cluster, were
not so famous, as Number.13.24. I^rem. 8.22. and 46.11. Gen.37.25. Trem.Ios.Antiq.

the Balm of Gilead, which the first Merchants we read of, from that mart,
vented to other parts of the world. These Balme-trees grew in the vale of
Jericho, which being cut, yielded this precious liquor; whereof, besides the
admirable effects in Cures, other wonders are told by ancient and later
Writers, too long here to relate. Bellonius Bellon lib.2. cap.39.
will do it for me, if any list to read his observations. He is not of their
mind, which think there is now no true Balsam in the world (these in Iudaea
being perished) but thinks in Arabia-Faelix it grows naturally, from whence
some shrubbes he saw in Cairo. But I should be too tedious if I should insist
on this argument: That instance of such a world of people, in such a patch of
the world, does sufficiently declare the fertility, when as David 1. Chron.
21. See Tr^mel. notes on 2. Sam.249.
numbered them, 1100000. Israelites, and of Judah, 470000. or as in 2. Sam.24.9.
500000. which drew sword; and yet Benjamin and Leui were not reckoned in this
number: and in the days of Jeroboam, 2.Chron. 13.
Abija King of Judah brought into the field 400000. and Jeroboam 800000. and on
this part were slain in one battle 500000. all choice men; which History
cannot be matched with the like in all ages and places of the world: that a
Country, an hundred and sixty miles long, and not above sixty in breadth,
should nourish at once, or lose in a battle such multitudes, not to speak of
impotent persons, women and children. But this multitude by eiuill wars and
invasions of enemies decreased, till first the relics of Israel, and after,
the remnant of Judah, were by the Assyrians, and Babylonians led captive, and
the Land enjoyed her Sabbaths.

For the Kingdom of Israel consisting of ten Tribes (some reckon Simeon also
to Inda, because of his portion mixed with Inda's as Beniamins was adjoining
thereto, to whom the Levites 2.Chron.^.14.
likewise, and Priests forsaking their Cities, and all the religious Israelites
annexed themselves) forsook A great part of Benjamin, and Simcon was subject
to David's postetitie.
not the house of David only, but the house of the Lord, and set them up Calves
(Egyptian superstitions) at Dan and Bethel, and made Priests for their
Idolatrous purpose. This their rebellion and Apostacy God plagued with civil
dissension and foreign hostility, until at last the Assyrians 2.Reg.17.
removed them altogether, and repeopled those parts with new Colonies. Such is
the end of Religion, which has not God for the beginning, but is grounded on
humane policy, a sandy foundation. Judah could not take warning, but provoking
God by Idolatrous courses, at last was carried to Babel, and thence, after
seventy years, returned. The history of these things, so fully related in
Scripture, I should but mar in the telling.

After this their return the Land was not, as before, named after the portions
of the several Tribes: but was called by a general name, Ios. Antiq. 11.5.
Iudaea, and the people Jews, because the Tribe of Judah had before inhabited
those parts, or at least the principal of them, dilating themselves further,
as they increased in number and power. But more especially Iudaea was the name
of one Palaestina divided into 3. parts Galilee samaria Iudaea.
third part of the country, by that name distinguished from the other two,
Samaria, and Galilea, which two last are sometimes referred to Phoenicia.

Galilaea was the most Northerly, confining on Libanus and Antilibanus toward
the North, Phoenicia Westerly, Coelesyria on the East; and Samaria, with
Arabia, enclosing her Southerly borders, Jordan parts it in the midst. It
was divided into the higher and lower Galilee: the higher called also Galilee
of the Gentiles, contains the springs of Jordan, and those Cities which
Solomon gave to Hiram. The lower was also called Galilee of Tiberias, that
City giving name both to the lake and region: in which Nazareth was famous,
and the hill Thabor.

Samaria is seated betwixt Galilee and Iudaea much less then either of them.
Iudaea is the most Southerly; between the Mediterranean and Dead seas,
Samaria, and Idumea. Pliny makes Galilaea a part of it, and Peraea another
part, separated from the rest by Jordan. The rest he divides into ten
Toparchies; Ierico, Emaus, Lidda, Ioppe, Acrabatena, Gophnitica, Thamnitica,
Betholene, Tephene, Orine, in which was Jerusalem far the fairest of the
Cities of the East, not of Iudaea alone: Herodium, with a famous town of the
same name. He adds unto these the Region of Decapolis, so called of the
number of the Towns, and the Tetrarchies; Trachonitis, Pancas, Abila, Arca,
Ampeloessa, Gabe. Those ten Towns of Decapolis were Caesarea, Philippi, Asor,
Cedes, Neptalim, Sephet, Corozain, Capharnaum, Bethsaida, Iotapata, Tiberias,
and Bethsan, otherwise called Scythopolis, and before Nysa, where Bacchus
buried his nurse. But these are parts of those former parts above mentioned;
and so may we say of the rest, sustaining, in diverse respects, diverse
divisions, best fitting to the present polities, and little to our purpose.

Those things which of old were famous in those places, are mentioned in the
Scripture: Those things which since have been more remarkable; I purpose in the
next part of this Work, of Christian Religions, to handle, and especially the
rarities of Jerusalem, sometimes the holy City, and City of the great King,
now a den of thieves; a habitation of Mahumetans, or rather now not at all: for
this which is now, is a new City, called by the Founder, Aelia Capitolina,
built by Aelius Adrianus, who caused the plough to pass through, and Salt to be
sown in the old, as testifying her eternal desolation; and fulfilling Christ's
Prophecy to the utmost, not leaving a stone upon a stone, if Titus had not
fully accomplished the same before. Arias Montanus in his Nehemias affirms,
that Jerusalem was founded on three hills; to wit, Sion, on which the
Iebusites built their Tower; and which in David's time was further builded on,
and called the City of David. The second hill was Mount Moriah, which David
bought of Aranna, to erect thereon the Temple. The third was the higher Acra,
called the Suburb. These were compassed with one wall without; and within
divided with three walls, by which the City of David, and Moriah, and the
higher Acra were divided: In the circuit of the walls were nine gates. He that
desires further to read, or rather to see the old Jerusalem, with her holy
fabriques, let him resort to Arias Montanus his Antiquitates Iudaicae, where he
both relates, and in figures presents these things. It is supposed that
Melchisedech built it about the year of the World, 2023. and called it Salem.
The Iebusites after possessed it (and of them some derive the name Jerusalem,
quasi Iebussalem) till David expelled them: who had before reigned in Hebron
(called Cariatharbe, the City of four men, say some, because of Adam,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, both dwelling and burial there; yet Adam, others
say, was buried in Mount Caluarie, with other speculations curious and
uncertain.) He translated the highest seat both of spiritual and temporal
regiment to Jerusalem, where he reigned after, three and thirty years, to
whom succeeded Solomon, and the rest in order. It then contained in circuit
fifty furlongs, compassed with a great ditch sixty foot deep, and two
hundred and fifty broad. Nabuchodonosor destroyed it, Nohemias reedified it,
three and thirty furlongs in circuit: The Macchabees, Herod, and others added
to her excellence, till Titus besieged and took it; in which siege are said to
have perished 1100000. people; and being now a sepulcher of dead carkaffes, was
made a spectacle of Divine vengeance, for murdering the LORD of Life. But
those struggling spirits, and small remnants of life which remained in this
forlorn carcass of the sometime Jerusalem, breathed a new rebellion, in the
time of Adrian and thereby breathed her last, as before is said. The History
of this City the Scripture has recorded; and where Divine History ends,
Josephus and Hegesippus (that I speak not of late Writers) have largely
supplied, especially concerning her latest fates, and, as I may term it, in
her funeral Sermon. Justin.lib.36. Strabo lib.16.
Strabo, Iustine and others have written of this people, but not sincerely. But
the fountains are clear enough to acquaint us with their true original,
which comes next to be considered.

Of the Hebrew Patriarchs, and their Religion before the Law: also of their Law
and Polity.

THe name of Hebrews some derive from Abraham, as if they were called Hebraei
quaesi Abrahaei. Arias Montanus Mon. de Antiq.lud.Canaan, vel lib.3.cap.9^
tells us, that this name of Hebrews was not appropriate to any family, but
common to all such, as having passed over the river Euphrates fixed their
tents, and abode between that river and the great sea. He gathers this from
the Hebrew word, which signifies to pass over. Such an one first of all was
Heber, seeking a life answerable to his name: whose example (says he) Their
imitated: and after, Abram for his twofold transmigration from Chaldea, and
from Haran, deserved that name, and left it to his posterity. But

the world in their languages sustained. This Peleg was Grandfather to Serug,

so eagerly swalloweth this opinion, that he taxes Calvin of Heresy, or
attributing to Abraham the contrary; namely, that Abraham, before GOD called
him out of Vr, was an Idolater: an opinion so much more probable, then the
other, as having better authority. For Joshua Ios.24.2.

amongst them. And Genebrard Genebrard. Chron. lib.1.
does so interpret it; and Mazius Maz. in los.24.
in his Commentaries on that place, both zealous and learned Papists: yea
Lindanus Lindan. i^ Panop.
specifieth the Idolatry, and calls him a worshipper of Vesta. Suidas Suidas.
says, that Abraham by the observation of the Creatures in his study of
Astronomy, lifted up his mind above the Stars, and by the glory, and order
of them, learned the knowledge of God, never ceasing that Divine search, till
God appeared to him. Which opinion may reconcile both the former: that first he
was, and after ceased to be, and Idolater, before God appeared in vision to
him. Hec alleges philo for his Author, that at fourteen years Abraham
reproved Thara for seducing men unto Idolatry (moved by his private lucre)
with Images: and seeing the Heaven sometime clear, sometime clowdie, he
gathered, that that could not be God. The like he concluded of the Sun, and
Moon, by their eclipses (for his father had taught him Astronomy). At last
God appeared, and bad him leave his country. Whereupon he took his fathers
Images, who (as before is said) was an Image-maker, and partly broke, partly
burnt them, and then departed. Suidas further thinks him the first inuenter
of Letters, of the Hebrew tongue, and of the interpretation of dreams; which I
leave to the Authors credit. But for the fault of Abraham before his calling,
and other blemishes after, in him and the rest of the Patriarchs; what do they
else, but in the abounding of man's sin, set out the superabounding grace of
God? and are prositable, as learned Morton Mort. Ap.p.1. lib.1.cap.30.
in answer of this cavil, has out of one of their own Sixtus Senens. Bib.
lib 7. cap.8.
observed against them, what he had observed out of Augustine, to these four
purposes: Faith, Instruction, Fear, and Hope: the Faith of the History which
slattereth, or concealeth the faults of none: Instruction to virtue, by seeing
others faults taxed: Fear, for what shall shrubbes do, if Cedars fall? and
Hope, that we imitate their repentance, by seeing their pardon.

But to return to our History. Many of the Ethnike histories mention him:
Berosus commends him for his justice, and skill in Astronomy. Nic.
'Damascenus says, that he reigned at Damascus, and that in his time, his house
continued in Damascus, and was still called by his name: Hecataeus wrote a
book of him: and Alexander Polyhistor tells that he was borne in the tenth
generation after the Flood in Camarine (or Vrien) a City of Babylon. Josephus
Antiq lib. 1. cap.3.
adds, that when famine drove him into Egypt, Genesis 12. he disputed with the
Priests, and most learned Egyptians, in questions of Divinity; and in their
divided sects, having confuted one by another, he communicated to them the
truth, both in this, and in Arithmetike and Astronomy, whereof before the
Egyptians were ignorant. Abram (says M. Broughton in his Concent) was borne
sixty years later then the common account; as appears See the Chronology,
chap 11.
by computation of Terahs age, who died at two hundred and five years, and
after his death Genesis 12.4.
Abram went from Charan into Cannan, the threescore and fifteenth year of his
own life; and therefore was borne in the hundred and thirtieth, and not in the
seuentieth year of his father, in the 352. year after the Flood; whereas the
common opinion reckons the 292. To Abram God had given commandment, saying:
Go from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers house into the
Land which I shall show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, etc.

His history is fully related by Moses, and his progeny also, whereof Ismael
his son by Agar, and other his sons which he had by Ketura his second wife, he
sent to inhabit. the East country (Arabia) in his lifetime: but Isaac was made
his heir, both Temporal and Spiritual: to whom Jacob succeeded in the
promised blessing: who with his sons and family went down into Egypt, where
his posterity multiplied exceedingly, and were called sometime Ebrewes of their
ancient pedigree; sometime Israelites, of the name Israel, given to Jacob by
the Angel, Genesis 32. 28. Their whole history so largely and plainly in holy
Writ recorded, I fear to make Mine, by evil reciting: Those Fountains are
more open to all, then that any should need ours, or others Brook^^, mixed with
some mirie earth (at least) in the passage: (and my intent is to be largest in
relation of those things which are not in the Scriptures; touching the same
briefly for order sake). Their religion, mean while, was the best amongst the
best, though stained in some, as Rachel, which stale her father Labans Idols;
and Jacob was forced after to reform his family in this respect; and after in
Egypt they were corrupted with the Egyptian superstition, as Ezechiel in his
twentieth Chapter protests against them. The manner of Divine worship was not
so straightly limited, as after, to persons and places. By revelation and
tradition they received the religious worship, wherein they instructed their
posterity: until that in their extremest thraldom God sent Moses and Aaron
to deliver them: under whose conduct they passed through the sea and wilderness
to the brinkes of Jordan, receiving in the way that Law; which as a Tutour, or
Schoolmasters was in that their nonage to train them up, until that full and
ripe age; when Galath.4.4.
God sent his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem
them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. Of
this Law, although Moses has given us an absolute relation in the Scripture,
whereof he was the first penman (of that at least which remains unto us) yet
if we shall out of him, bring them into their order, and rank them under their
several heads, as Sigonius Car. Sigon.de rep. Hebr.
and others have done; it shall not be, I think, ouer-tedious to the Reader.

The Law is divided usually, into the Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial, as
parts of the same: the first delivered on the Mount Sinai, by the dreadful
voice of the Almighty GOD, and by the finger of GOD, written after in Tables
of stone, called ten words, summarily abridged into two Commandments, by the
Lawgiver himself; Mat.22.38.
The first and great Commandment enioyning the love of GOD, the second, of our
neighbors, that GOD, who himself is Charity, imposing nothing but the lovely
yoke of Love and Charity unto his servants. This Law is Eternal, written
first in the hearts of our first parents, which being defaced, it was written
again in the stony Tables of the Law, where it was but a killing letter, till
Grace and Truth by JESUS CHRIST indicted and indented it in the fleshie Tables
of the Gospel, as Io.13.34
CHRIST'S new Commandment written in renewed hearts, and shall for ever be
then graven in those spiritual Tables, when we that here are 1.Cor.15.44.
natural men, shall rise again spiritual men; and shall be the law of that
holy City, the new Jerusalem; this being then perfected, when 1.Cor.13.
Faith, and Hope, and this World shall be finished. The other parts Ceremonial
and Judicial, were (for the particulars) proper unto that nation; the one
respecting the manner of Divine service, the other of Civil government: not
given (as the other) immediately to the Israelites by God himself, but
communicated in the Mount to Moses, that he might acquaint the people withal.
This nation was divided, as is said already, into Tribes, according to the
number of Jacobs sons, amongst whom Leui had no portion (but the Lord was their
portion, they serving at the Altar, and living of the Altar) but 48. cities
with their suburbs assigned for their habitation, amongst other Tribes, that
being so dispersed, they might disperse also, and preach the Law to the rest:
and were reckoned Iud.17.7.
to that Tribe with which they dwelled: and whereas others might not marry, for
fear of alienation of their inheritances; into another Tribe, this of Leui
either had, or took liberty herein, as Indg. 19. and 2. Chro. 22. Ioiada
married the Kings sister; and thus Elizabeth, wife of Zachary the Priest, might
be cousin to Mary the mother of our Lord. The number of twelve remained yet
entire, in reckoning of these Tribes, because that Joseph had a double portion,
and his sons, Ephraim and Manasses, made two Tribes. Neither were they alone
reckoned Israelites, that naturally descended from some one of these twelve
sons of Israel, but such also of other nations as embraced their Ceremonies and
Religion, being for distinction sake called Proselytes. The Hebrew Ar.Montan.
in Mattb.23.
word which is interpreted a Proselyte, signifies extracted, or drawn forth,
because they esteemed such, drawn forth of hell: whom yet they made the children
of hell, more then themselves, in burthening their consciences, not only with
those Ceremonies whereunto the Law and their tradition tied them, but with
diverse others also. The name Proselyte, as Drusius affirms, Drus.de 3.sect.
lib.2.
is either taken largely for any stranger, or strictly for a convert to their
religion. A Proselyte was made with observation of three things, Circumcision,
Baptism or washing, and Oblation. The first was a sign of the Covenant, in
which they were received: the second, as a badge of their cleannes; (for all
the Gentiles were unclean) the third, for the atonement with God. This was
while the Temple stood, and now is not in force: but whether Baptism be still
used, I know not. He ought to be circumcised in the presence of three. A woman
Proselite was admitted by Baptism only, and the offering of two Turtles, or
two Pigeons. Serarius says, Baptism and circumcision are still required: the
like is written by Munster in l. Praecept. Mos. cum expos.Rab. Et in Euangel.
Matthew. Hebr: Anot.cap.22.
Munster, who adds, that when any desires to become a Proselite, they
propound to him the hardest things of the law: with the promises of future
happiness: and if he continue his purpose, they circumcise him, and when he is
whole, Baptize him; and then account him an Israelite. The same Author elsewhere
handles the same their ceremonies more at large: he says that they propound
to him their strictest observations, as of the Sabbath, not eating fat, etc.
with some penances, that he should not after say, had I wist; and they would
seem to be willing by these means, to drive them from their religion, as
being corrupted by such new comers: but CHRIST affirms otherwise. Matthew. 23.

The government of this state was after Moses and Joshua managed by Judges of
diverse Tribes, not by election nor inheritance succeeding in that office, but
by appointment of God, till they desired a King, whereas before God was their
King, and by his law partly, partly by oracleruled, the State, being as some
think an Aristocratie. There were besides these Judges, Princes of each Tribe,
and the heads of families: there was also a government in each City by the
Elders or Senate, exercised in the gates thereof. They had accordingly their
Councils or assemblies, either of the whole nation, or of a whole Tribe, or of
some one city: they had their Elders or Senators in like manner, having
authority, some for the whole nation, some Car. Sigmi.de rep. Heb.lib.6. and7.
(if we follow some men's co^iectures) for their own tribe; some in their proper
city. The first of these was the Sa^hedrin or 70. Elders appointed by GOD, Number.
15. and continued unto the destruction of that nation, and their court was kept
in the seat Royal, or mother-City of the Kingdom: to which, appeal was made
from the inferior Courts in obscure and difficult cases. They had Judges also
appointed, and Magistrates, having jurisdiction over a thousand, a hundred,
fifty, or ten. They had besides, their Officers in time of war, and Officers
of the Temple: which I have but named to the Reader, who, if he desire fully to
be informed, concerning their polity, and State-affaires: Carolus Sigonius
(not to mention others) in his sixth and seventh book. De Repub. Hebraica, will
reasonably satisfy him.

Yet I hold it not impertinent to mention (somewhat more largely) what Petrus
Galatinus ^. Galat.de A^ca^s. lib.4. cap. ^. and6.
has written of this Judiciary power of the Israelites, by the ceasing whereof,
he proves, that the Messiah is already come, according to Jacobs prophecy,
Genesis 49. He shows therefore that the Sanhedrin were the successors of those
seventy Elders, which were appointed assistants to Moses, Number.11.18. to whom
belonged the determination of all difficulties and hardest questions of the
Law; as appears, Den. 17 from whom was no appeal. They were called
Sanhedrin, whom we may call ordinary Judges, and Mehokekim, that is, Scribes,
or Law-giuers, because whatsoever they delivered or writ, was received as a Law.

Their College represented that Scepter, by the holy Ghost in Jacob promised
to Judah: and therefore not only under the Kings and Judges did exercise
judgments, but also when there was no King, or Judge in Israel. Of their
quality it is thus written in the book Sanhedrin. They appointed none (said
R.Iohanan) but men of wisdom, stature, and of goodly Apparentie.
presence, and of old age, and cunning in exorcismes, and understanding the
seventy tongues, that they might not need interpreters. Their stature and
comelines, Rabbi Selomoh says, was required, to acquire the^ reverence; and
skill in enchantment, to convince such wisards. Of their power in Sanhedrin
Babilonice, is thus written: Four kinds of Death was in their power, Stoning,
Burning, killing with the Sword, and strangling. R. Akiba affirmed, that they
fasted all that day in which they adjudged any to death. Mony-matters were
ordered by three Judges, as were all moveable goods: judgment of life by 22.
of these 70. under which number they could not condemn any to death. But in
cases of a Tribe, or Scepter, or false prophet, or high Priest, were required
the whole number of seventy and one: the like was in going to war, in adding to
a city, or the revenues of the Temple, or in conuenting the ordinary Judges of
the Tribes, To co^stitute one of this number they used imposition of hands; R.
Judas says of five. A wolf, lion, bear, leopard, and serp^et, were to be
slain by the 23.

The great College called Sanhedre ghedola, consisted of 71. the less of 23.
That odd number above 70. was to supply the room of Moses, which was over
those first 70. Thus far the Talmud. Whereby Galatinus gathers, that in the
Council that condemned CHRIST, there was the whole number of 71. which is true,
if Herod had not before disanulled that society. The greater Sanhedrin
ordained the less; for those 70. ordained all the Sessi^os of Judges, which in
other cities and places ruled the people: and to this Court of the 70. in
Jerusalem they were all subject. The place where they sat was called Gazith,
that is, Carved, whereof this Court had the name (as the Starchamber with us.)
Other Courts or houses of Judgment, they had diverse, of the 23. One of the^
sat in the gate of the mountain of the Temple: another in the gate of the
Court: others in every city. And when there was a controversy, it was first
brought to that city or town, and so to the rest, if occasion required (in
order) to that in the gate of the Mount, after to that in the Court-gate, and
last to the Gazith consistory, in which they sat from morning till night. But
on Sabbaths and solemn days they sat on the wall.

But when Herod obtained the Scepter, he slew Hircanus and his son Antigonus,
which had been King and Priest, and also all of the seed royal, and burnt the
Genealogies of their Kings: and further to stablish his throne in blood, he
killed the Scribes and Doctors of the Law, and caused all the Sanhedrin to be
done to death. Because the Rabbanan (they are the words of the Talmud) had said
according to Deuteronomy.17. From among thy brethren thoushalt set a King over thee:
he slew the Rabbanan or Masters, reserving only Baba, the son of Bota, whose
eyes he after put out. And therefore the Sanhedrin perished: for, as is said,
five, or at least after R. Ismael, three were necessary to the ordination by
the imposition of hands. But there were by Herod's permission other Judges
instituted to be under the King, like the former College, but had no
authority of sentence in weighty and criminal causes: and therefore they
said to Pilate, it is not lawful for us to put any man to death. And then for
salfe sentence pronounced against CHRIST, they were expelled from the
Consistory Gazith, forty years before the destruction of the Temple, and
afterward, by the commandment of the Romans, were all flaine. They being
expelled Gazith, held their Consistory at Hamith, another place in Jerusalem
but, says R. Abdimi, with the place they lost their power in criminal
judgments; which might not be given but in Gazith. So do the Rabbines
interpret the words; Deuteronomy.17.10. According to the words which they of that
place show thee, thou shall do. Thus much out of Galatinus.

The word Sanhedrin, says Drusius, Quaest. Heb. lib 2.
signifies not the judgments (as some mistake) but the Judges, the seventy
Senators of the great Court at Jerusalem, called in the new Testament, Elders,
Match. 16 21.

Now concerning the Jewish Excommunications, the same Author Quaest.Heb.lib.1.
and2.
has observed, that the Jews had three kinds and degrees of Excommunications,
Niddui, Herem, Samatha the first signifies a Removing; the second, Anathema;
the third, the same which the Apostle calls Maran-atha: By the first they are
made (...) (of which is an example, Genes.4.4) excommunicated from the
Ecclesiastical assemblies: and if they did not amend, they were excommunicated
with a greater curse, or Anathema: and if they persisted obstinate, they did
Samatize them. The word Anathema is sometimes taken generally, but here, for a
particular kind. Maran-atha, signifies the LORD comes; and so does Sem-atha.
For by Sem, and more emphatically, Hassem they used to signify the name,
meaning that Tetragrammaton and ineffable name of God, Iehoua. It may also be
compounded of Sama, after the Chaldee form; or of Sam and mitha, which
signifies, There is death. Some Authors ascribe this to the institution of
Henoch: which they gather out of Jude 14.

CHAP III.
Of the Religious places of the Israelites.

IN the discovery of their ancient Religion, it seems fittest to discourse
first of places, secondly of times, thirdly, of Rites, fourthly of Persons
consecrated to Religion. And first, of the first. Neither were the first men,
Hosplnian.de Templis cap.1.
nor first Hebrews, very religious in this point of dedicating places to
religion; as appears in Histories both holy and profane: and if for some
vision, made unto them in some places, they did for a time hallow the same with
Altars, and Sacrifices: yet neither were they always, or only thus esteemed.
But He, whose is the earth and all that therein is, did by his law appoint, as
it were, a place of his residence amongst these, whom he had chosen for his
own people: and commanded them to erect a Tabernacle in the wilderness,
fitting that their peregrination. Afterward Solomon built him a house in
Jerusalem: which therefore is called the holy City and the City of the great
King.

The Tabernacle (a moveable Temple that might be taken asunder, and joined
together again) was, by Gods commandment, erected in the wilderness, in the
same manner, and of the same matter, which God had both commanded and showed to
Moses in the Mount; the matter and form whereof, with all that thereunto
appertained; the Arc, the Candlestick, the Altar, etc. in the book of
Eoeodus are lively declared. It was after (as we read in the book of
Josh.3.14. 15.
Joshua with great solemnity carried miraculously through Jordan, by the
Levites deputed to that service: and, after their conquest of the Country,
^os^.18.1.
placed in Shilo, a City of Ephraim. There did Joshua divide the Land to her
new conquerours: there were their solemn assemblies for state and religion. In
the time of Helt they removed the Arc from the Tabernacle into the army,
which they had gathered against the Philistims; of whom the Arc was taken. The
Tabernacle, in the time of Saul, was carried to Nob, and, in the time of David,
to Gibeon, where Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings. The Philistims
forced by Divine judgments, sent back the Arc, received by the Bethsamites,
curious to their cost, it was after placed in Kiriath-Iarim, in the house of
Aminadab, next of Obed-Edam, and then by David in the place, which he had
fitted for the same in Jerusalem; whence it was removed into the Temple, which
Solomon had built: where it was till the time of the deportation: in which time
2.Maccb.2.5.
it was hidden by Jeremy the Prophet. But that Author is beholden to the
Council of Trent for his credit, the Jews themselves in that point, not
believing him; R. Samuel in lib. Sanhedrim. Hierosol. cap. Ellu hen baggol.
Pet. Galatin. l.4. Genebrard. lu Chron.
who affirm, that the second Temple came short of the former, by the want of
the fire from heaven, of the Arc, of the Vrim and Thummim, of the succession
of Prophets, and the glory of God between the Cherubims.

The Temple was built on Mount Moriah by Solomon, according to the I. Chron.
28. 11.12.
pattern, which he had received of David: to which work he had gathered a
greater mass of wealth, then easily we shall read of in the Persian, Greek,
Roman, or any other Christian, Turkish, or Heathen Empire; I.Chron.22. 14.
namely, 100000. talents of gold; 1000000. talents of silver, and afterward
3000, talents of gold, and 7000. talents of silver: to which was added, by the
offerings of the Princes, 10000. talents of silver, and more then 5000. talents
of gold, besides jewels, and brass, and iron, without weight, with Cedars and
stones without number. The gold alone amounts after the common computation of
the common talent, at 6000. crowns, to six hundred forty eight millions of
crowns, and upwards; the silver to about the same sum.

This beautiful frame I should deforme with my description, if (after a double
narration of all the parts; form, and contents thereof in the History of the
Bible) I should recite the particulars. This Temple, fleeced by some, repaired
by others, continued in variety of state, till the sacking and ruin of it,
together with the City by Nabuchodonosor. And after their return, by the
edict of Cyrus, and other the Persian Kings, it was rebuilded (but far
inferior in glory) in the space, as the Jews say, Ioh. 2.20.
unto Christ, of six and forty years: after others it was longer in hand, by
reason of impediments from their cauilling, and malicious neighbors. This
second Temple having received access of magnificence in succession of times,
was spoiled and polluted under Antiochus, who dedicated the same to Jupiter
Olympius; but being freed and dedicated anew by Maccabaeus, it recovered great
part of the former beauty; till as Ios.Antiq. lib. 12. Iosipp. debel Iud.
Josephus says, and his abbreuiator Iosippus, it was pulled down by Herod,
and built anew. Herein both that allegation of the Jews of six and forty
years, is against this assertion of Josephus, and the History also of
Hegesippus Egesip. lib. I.
who reports that he only compassed the circuit about the Temple with a wall,
and beautified the same with costly buildings, erected from the foundation the
porches about the Sanctuary, and fortified it with the castle Antonia.

Chrysostom Chrysostom. in Ican. hom.22.
understands those words, of the Jews, Forty and six years was this Temple a
building, of the Herodian, Temple: and herein Hospinian. de Tem. cap.3. Caesar
Baron. To.1. Annal. An.31.
Hospinian, and the great Cardinal Baronius follow him: accounting exclusiuely
from the eighteenth year of Herod's reign, which Functins reckons A. M.
3947. to the year 3992. in which John Baptized, and CHRIST uttered these
words: in all which they conjecture that somewhat was still a doing about the
new building thereof, although the principal part thereof was performed and
finished by Herod in eight years. This they gather by Josephus his own
testimony, that the building continued till the time of Nero, and in an other
place, where he affirms that the East porch, which Luke calls Act.5. 12.
Salomons porch, was still remaining of the ancient building, in the days of
Nero, and elsewhere, that Herod repaired the Temple. Ies. de bells
Iud.lib.1.c.16.
Josephus is therefore herein contrary to the truth, and himself. Neither do
the Jews in the Talmud speak of any third Temple: nor can the Prophecy of
Hag.2.10.
Haggaus be fulfilled, that the glory of the second Temple should exceed the
glory of the former; if CHRIST (of whose coming it is interpreted) had not by
his presence, preaching, and miracles, not only supplied the defects (before
mentioned) but made it surmount the other in effects of Majesty and glory.
And the zeal unto this testimony, not the meanest which the Christian Verity
Morn. deverit.Christ. Relig
urges against the Jewish Incredulity and Apostasy, which is necessarily
demonstrated and euinced, whiles yet they continue their vain hopes of a
Messiah, so many Ages after the desolation of that Temple whereof Aggee
prophesied, has caused me to use so many words in this matter. But to satisfy
the fancies of great men, their great works are commonly made greater: For
howsoever it was very great in it self, that Herod should have, eight years
together, many workmen at work (which Josephus numbreth for some part of the
time ten thousand and a thousand Priests) yet sustaining, no doubt, some
intermission after his time, either wholly, or in part, it could not be so
great as to have accomplished it wholly from the foundation, wherein Solomon
spent seven years: and besides, what any of the natural Israelites performed
in this work, he employed an hundred three and fifty thousand and six
hundred workmen of the Strangers or Forainers found in the Country. And
whereas the second Temple was but half the height of the former, perhaps it is
true, that (according to Josephus) he perfected it to that height of an hundred
and twenty cubits, whereof twenty cubits sanke down in the settling of the
foundations. It was builded by Herod of white stones five and twenty cubits
long, eight thick, and twelve broad. He that would further read the
particulars, let him have recourse to Josephus in his fifteenth book of
Antiquities. This Temple was burned by Titus, in the sack of the City, the
same day that before it had been fired by the Chaldaeans. Adrian the Emperor
Dion Nicaeud in Adriano.
did after destroy the Relics thereof, that a stone was not left upon a
stone, and there, in the same place, dedicated another Temple to Jupiter, that
former being overwhelmed with earth. Julian gave leave to the Jews to reedifie
the Temple, in despite of Christian Religion, and contributed frankely
thereto: but Ammianus Marcellinus Amm. Marcellinus, lib. 23.
, a Heathen Writer, witnesses, That fire issued out of the Earth, Metuendi
slammaruns globi prope sundamenta crobris assultibus erumpentes, secere locum
exustis aliquoties operantib^, inaccessum.
and burnt both work and workmen: when as an Earthquake (which had before,
says Sozomen. li. 5.
Sozomen, killed a great many, in the very attempting of this Work) could not
deter them from proceeding in their purpose: and Crosses, miraculously fallen
on the garments of many, did both teach them to forsake their Iudaisme, and to
become Christians.

Chrysostom Chrysostom. hom.3. contra Iudeos.
mentions this, and says, that under Adrian the Jews sought to recover
their liberty, and lost their Country, Under Constantine they attempted the
like, who therefore cut off their ears, and branded their bodies for rebels,
as the elder of you (says he to his Auditors) do know. And in our days, about
twenty years since, Julian the Emperor was at great expenses, appointed
officers, sent for worke-men from all places, thinking to frustrate CHRIST'S
Prophecy concerning the Temple, and to bring the Jews to Idolatry. But so
soon as they had attempted this business, and bared the foundation, had
drawn forth the earth, and were now ready to begin their building; a fire
burst forth from the foundations, and burnt many, which caused them to cease.
And if you now go to Jerusalem, you may see the foundations naked: Hereof we
all are witnesses. Neither did this happen under Christian Emperors, lest any
should impute it to the Christians, but under an Ethnike, when Christianity
was persecuted. Thus much in effect, Chrysostom. Gregory Nazianzen Greg. Naz.
orat.1. in Julian.
also testifies the same, affirming that the Earth (as it were taking a Vomit
from the Divine hand) spued out the stones, which yet till this day had
continued therein, and dispersed them to the great damage of the neighbor
buildings.

Other holy places they had which the Scripture mentions as high places,
which were high hills, or other open and lofty places, shaded for the most part
with Trees: the Prophets inuey against them, and Deuteronomy.12.3.
they were commanded to be destroyed, together with the Groves: some yet were
permitted, either by extraordinary command for a time, as to Gedeon Ind.6.24.
and to Manoab Iud.13.19.
; or because of the Tabernaclent Gibeon, or of the Arc at Jerusalem. The not
reforming this toleration of high places is reckoned as an eclipse of
Iehoshaphats and Asas glory; which Ezekiuh and Josiah quite removed and
polluted. These high and open places, it seems, were consecrated, as fitting
to the celestial bodies; to which, and to Baal (who is interpreted the Sun)
they used for the most part on them to sacrifice. They had also their Houses
and Temples for Baal, in Israel and Judah; and Dan and Bethel were by Jeroboam
dedicated to his Egyptian Idolatry: and Gilgal was a place of request in this
kind. Solomon also built Temples or Houses for his idolatrous wives. And to
reckon every particular in this kind were a work endless: in the 2. Reg.17.
and 23. and other places enough is of them recorded.

Two other Temples were erected of some reputation: one by Sanballat at
Samaria, on Mount Garizin, by license obtained of Alexander the Great, whose
part he followed, rebelling against Darius his true Lord. The occasion was,
because Manasses, brother of Iaddi the High Priest, had married, contrary to
GODS Law, Nicaso Ios.Ant.l.11.
daughter of Sanballat, and was forced either to leave his Priestly Function or
Heathenish bed. Whereupon Sanballat, having obtained license to build that
Temple aforesaid, constituted him the high Priest thereof, many other Priests
for the like fault, resorting thither to him. But of these Samaritans we shall
have fitter occasion to say more when we come to handle their Sects.

abouesaid, granted license to Onias (the son of the high Priest Onias, whom
Antiochus had slain) who for the same cause had here shrouded himself, to
build a Temple, induced hereunto by a false interpretation of the prophecy of
Esaias, Esaias 19.19
at Leontopolis, in the shire, as I may term it, or nomus of Heliopolis:
having Priests and Levites ministering therein, and other things answering in
some sort to that of Jerusalem. When the Temple of Jerusalem was burnt by
Titus, this Temple was shut up also of Lupus, the Deputy, three hundred and
thirty years after it had been builded: and after by his successor Paulinus
utterly dispoiled both of the wealth and the religion. The City was called of
Onias, Onion. Ios.l.7.c.30. de Bell.Iud.
It had a Tower and an Altar like that of Jerusalem, but in stead of a
candlestick, a lamp of gold hanging on a chain of gold, enriched by the
king with large revenues.

Synagogues the Jews had many, both in Jerusalem where are said to have been
four hundred and fourscore, and in all cities of Judea, and among the
Gentiles where the Jews were dispersed. When they first began to be builded,
is uncertain. Cornelius Betramus thinks, That the eight and forty Cities of
the Levites had their fit places for Assemblies, whence Synagogues had
beginning. Car.Sig.l.2.c.8
Sigonius coniectureth, That their Babylonian exile ministered occasion to them
to help themselves with these Houses of Prayer and Instruction. The word
Synagogue Erastus de excommunicat. Thesis.
is taken both for the Assemblies, whether in this place, or out of it, and for
the Place it self; having a civil as well as a religious use. And these
Synagogues they have in the places of their dispersion unto this day. The order
they observed in their Synagogues was this: they disputed and preached sitting;
Ambros^in.1.Cor.14.
the Elders sat in Chaires which were set in order, of which CHRIST says, They
love the chief Seats in Synagogues: those of meaner sort sat in Seats, and
the meanest of all on the floor upon Mats. The Synagogue was governed by the
Scribes, and the chief of them called Archisynagogus, resembling the High
Priest and the inferior Priests in the Temple.

Besides these Temples and Houses consecrated to GOD, Ambition, the Ape of
Devotion, founded some of other nature. Herod the Great erected a sumptuous
Temple and City in the honor of Caesar, which sometime had been called
Stratonis turris. and after Caesarea. The Temple of Caesar, was conspicuous to
them which sailed far off in the Sea, and there in were two Statues, one of
Rome, the other of Caesar. The sumptuousness of Herod's ambition in this City,
Temple, Theater, and Amphitheater, etc. Josephus amply describes. Ant.l.15.13^
He built another Temple at Pahiuni, the fountain of Jordan, in honor of
Caesar; and least this should stir up the peoples hearts against him to see
him thus devoutly profane and profanely devout, he remitted to them the third
part of the tributes. He consecrated Gains, after the like Heathenish
solemnity, in honor of Caesar. to be celebrated every fifth year at Caesarea.
He built also the Pythian Temple at Rhodes of his own cost. He gave yearly
revenue to the Olympian Games, for maintenance of the Sacrifices and solemnity
thereof: Quis in rapacitate auarior? Quis in largitione effusior? He robbed his
own to enrich (or rather vainly to lavish out on) others. He spared not the
sepulchers of the dead. For the Sepulcher of David had lent before to Hyrcanus
three thousand talents of silver; which filled him with hope of the like
spoil: and entering it with his choice friends, he found no money but precious
clothes; and whiles he in a covetous curiosity searched further, he lost two
of his company, by flame (as fame went) breaking out upon them. Hereupon he
left the place, and, in recompense, in the entry of the Sepulcher, built a
monument of white Marble.

He built also Ios.de Bell. Iud.l.1.c.16.
Sebaste in the Region of Samaria, wherein he erected a Temple, and dedicated a
Court of three furlongs and a half of ground before it, to Caesar. Thus Caesar
was made a God by him, who would not allow CHRIST a place among men, but, that
he might kill him, spared not the infants of Bethleem, no not his own son
amongst the rest, as this his GOD iested of him Macrob. Saturn.l.2.
, saying, That he had rather be Herod's Hog then his Son. For his Jewish
devotion prohibited him to deal with Swine, but not Religion, not Reason, not
Nature could protect those innocents from slaughter.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the Jewish Computation of Time, and of their Festival days.

THe day amongst the Jews was (as amongst us) Natural and Artificial: this
from Sunne-rising to Sunne-setting, to which is opposed Night, the time of the
Suns absence from our Hemisphere: that comprehended both these, called of the
Greeks (...) containing one whole revolution of the Suns motion to the same
point of the Horizon or Meridian, in 24. hours. This Plin.l.2.c.77.
Fabrit.Paduani Catena temp.an.28. Scal.de Emend. Temp.l.1.
Natural day the Babylonians began at the rising of the Sun, the Athenians
at the setting, the Vmbrians (as the Astrologians) at Noone, the Egyptians and
Roman Priests at Midnight, The Jews agreed in their reckoning with the
Athenians, as did the Galls in Caes.Com.l.6.
Caesar's time, reporting Pluto to be the Author of their Nation: and some
relics hereof is in our naming of time by a seuen-night and a fortnight;
although otherwise we reckon the day between two midnights. The most natural
computation of this natural day is to follow that order of Nature, wherein
darkness had the prioritie of time, Gen.1.5.
and the evening and the morning were made one day, or the first day: which
(says Hospinian Hospinian de fest.Ethnic.l.1.1.
) the Italian and Bohemian Clockes do yet observe. The day was not divided of
the first Hebrews (before the Babylonian Captivity) into hours, but was
distinguished by Vigiliae, or Watches, of which they had four; the first began
at evening, the second at midnight, the third in the morning, the fourth at
noone. Neither is there any Hebrew word signifying an hour; although some
interpret the degrees of the Dyall of Ahaz Esa.38.8.
to be hours; some (as Tremellius) half hours. Afterward it was divided
into hours, 12. in the night, and as many in the day; not equal as ours, but
longer or shorter, according to so many equal portions of the day or night: so
that with them the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, hour was answerable
with our hours of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, if we consider them
in the Aequinoctiall, otherwise they differed from our equal hours more or
less, according to the unequal lengthning or shortning of the days, but so,
that an easy capacity may conceive the proportion. These hours sometimes
they reduced into four, the first containing the 1, 2, 3, or with us the 7, 8,
9, hours: the second the 4, 5, 6, or after our reckoning 10, 11, 12, of the
clock, and so forwards. This was the Ecclesiastical Computation, according to
the times of Prayers and Sacrifices, imitated still in the Church of Rome in
their Canonical hours. Thus is Mark reconciled to himself and the other
Evangelists, Mark.15.25. and 33.
in relating the time of CHRIST'S Passion, the first calling it the third hour
when they crucified him, or led him to be crucified, whereas John says, That
it was about Ioh.19.
the sixth hour when Pilate delivered him. Thus may the parable of the Laborers
in the Vineyard be understood, Matthew. 20. and other places of Scripture. The
night also was divided into four Watches, each containing three hours,
accordingly.

Seven days were a Septimana, res omnibus quidem Orientis populis ab vltima
vsque Antiquitate vsitata: nobis aute^ Europaeis vix tande^ ^ost Christian smum
receptae. Scal. de Emend. T.l.1.
week, whereof the seventh was called the Sabbath; others had no peculiar
name, but were called the first day of the week, or the first day of (or
after) the Sabbath, and so of the rest. Their months, as with us and the
Grecians, took their name of the Moon, and with them also their measure,
reckoning the order of their days according to the age of the Moon, and by
courses they contained, one 30. days, the next 29, and therefore were
constrained every second or third year to intercale, or add, as in a
Leape-yeare, one month of 22. days, and in every fourth year of 23. days.
This they called Vcadar, that is, And-Adar, or Adar doubled.
Veadar, because it followed the 12. month Adar, for the supply of 10. days,
21. hours, and 204. scruples, which the 12. months of the Moon came short of
the year of the Sun. And this they were forced to do for the observation of
the Passover, and their other Feasts. Ar. Montanus in his Daniel, or 9 book
of Jewish Antiquities says, That the ancient year had twelve months, as
appears by the history of Noah: but those months had no proper names, but
of their order, the first, second, third month, etc. Those names which after
they were known by, were Chaldean.
Before their Babylonian thraldom, four only of these months were known by
proper names; the first called Ethauim, the second Bull, the seventh, which
after was made the first, Abib; the eight Zif: but afterward the rest received
names, which had been before distinguished only by order, and the former
names also were altered; that being reckoned the first month of the year, in
which befell the 15. day of the Moon after the Aequinoctiall Vernall, and
their names follow, Nisan, Iar, Sivan, Thamuz, Ab, Elul, Thischri,
Marcheschvan, Cisleu, Tebeth, Schebath, Adar.

The Hebrew year, before Moses, began H spinian, Ar. Montanus in his Daniel,
and others, begin the world in Autumn; but our English Church and Joseph
Scalliger suppose the world was created in the Equinoctial vernall. And of this
opinion is R Iehosua, Basil, Ambrose, Hierome, Augustine, Bed ^, Isidorus,
Damascen, and other later Divines and Astronomers, whose reasons Hospinian
labors to confute, and adhuc sub Iudice his est.
at the new Moon next after the Autumnall Aequinoctiall, that being supposed
by some to be the time wherein the World was first created, every Plant and
Tree having the fruit and seed ripe: and this reckoning of the year, in civil
affairs, is observed of the Jews unto this day: and from hence they began
their Iubilee and seventh Sabbaticall year, least otherwise they should have
lost two years profits, not reaping the fruit of the old year, nor sowing in
the next. Their Ecclesiastical or festival year began at the Spring, as we
have said asore, by the commandment of GOD, at and in remembrance of their
departure out of Egypt at the same time, Exodus 12. as with us we have an
Ecclesiastical year moveable, according to the fall of Easter, differing from
the Civil beginning at our Lady, as with others at Christmasse or New-yeares
day.

Ios.Scal.de Emend, Temp.lib.4.
Scaliger thus observes concerning the Jewish year. The Jews (says he) use
a double reckoning of their year; one after the course of the Moon, the other
after the Tekupha's or course of the Sun. Tekupha Tekupha is the fourth part
of a year.
aunciently was that moment in which the passed year ended, and the following
began. But the later Jews divided the year of the Sun into four equal
parts, each whereof consisted of 91. days, 7. hours. And they divide the said
year into 12. equal parts, each containing days 30. hours, 10. 30. They
begin at the fifteenth of April, moved by the authority of R. Samuel an
ancient Critic, who ascribed the first Tekupha to that month which before
they began in Autumn: the reason was, because at that time Moses led the
Israelites out of Egypt. The modern Jews are so superstitious in the
observation of their Tekupha's, that they esteem it danger of life to alter
their reckoning of them. They also attribute to each of them his proper
element, as to the Tekupha Tamuz (the Summer Solstice) the Fire; and he which
should drink or eat in the moment of that Tekupha, they think should be taken
with a burning fever. Tekupha Nisan is on the fifteenth of April, Tekupha
Tamuz on the fifteenth of July, Tekupha Tisrs on the foureteenth of October,
Tekupha Tebeth on the foureteenth of January. In times passed they observed
superstitiously the beginnings of every month, thinking, that then the Sun
entered into that Sign which was attributed to that month. Now they only
observe the four Tropicall signs. Such is their folly, as though now the
entrance of Aries were not more then five and thirty days before the Tekupha
of Moses. But their leaden brains know not what Tekupha is, nor why, nor when
it was instituted. So much Scaliger.

If the new Moon happened after noone, then the moves and their New-Moone
Feast began the next day, and the year likewise, which began at the New Moon.
Although, in regard of use, some days were more holy then other, yet had every
day appointed Sacrifices Exodus.29.38. Number.28. Leu.23.
morning and evening.

Their Feasts were either weekly, of which was the Sabbath; or monthly,
every New Moon; or yearly, of which were the Easter or Passover, Pentecost
or Whitsontide, the Feast of Tabernacles: These were chief, to which were
added the Feast of Trumpets, of Expiation, and (as some account) of the Great
Congregation At the end of the Feast of Tabernac.
. To these we may reckon the seventh years Sabbath, and the year of Iubilee.
These Feasts GOD had prescribed to them, commanding, that in those three
principal Feasts every male (as the Jews interpreted it, that were clean,
and sound, and from twenty years of their age to fifty) should appear there
where the Tabernacle or Temple was, with their offerings, as one great Parish.
Deuteronomy. 16. hereby to retain an unity in divine worship, and a greater
solemnity, with increase of joy and charity; being better confirmed in that
Truth, which they here saw to be the same which at home they had learned, and
also better strengthened against the errors of the Heathen and idolatrous
Feasts of Devils. To these were after added upon occasions, by the Church of
the Jews, their four Fasts, in memory of their calamities received from the
Chaldaeans, their Feast of Lotts, of Dedication, and others, as shall follow in
their order.

They began to celebrate their Feasts at Even: so Moses is commanded,
Leu.23.32.
From Even to Even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath: imitated in the Christian
Euensongs on holy Euens: yet the Christian Sabbath is by some supposed to begin
in the morning, because CHRIST did rise at that time.

CHAP. V.
Of the Festival days instituted by GOD in the Law.

AS they were enjoined to offer a Lamb in the morning, and another in the
evening every day, with other Prayers, Praises, and Rites: so had the Sabbath a
double honor in that kind, and was wholly sequestered and sanctified to
religious duties. Which howsoever it was ceremonial, in regard of that seventh
day designed, of the Rites therein prescribed, of that rigid and strait
observation exacted, of the particular works prohibited, and of the deadly
penalty annexed, yet are we to think, that the eternal LORD, who has all
times in his hand, had, before this, selected some Time proper to his Service,
which in the abrogation of ceremonies See lib.1.c.4.
Legal, is in Moral and Christian duty to be observed to the end of the
World: even as from the beginning of the World he had sanctified the seventh
day to himself, and in the Moral Law (given not by Moses to the Jews, but by
GOD himself, as to all creatures) is the remembrance of that sanctification
urged. Frivolous are their reasons who would renew the Jewish Sabbath amongst
Christians, tying and tyring us in a more then Jewish servitude, to observe
both the last and first days of the week, as some have preached, and of the
Ethiopian Churches is practiced. Neither can I subscribe to those, who are so
far from paying two, that they acknowledge not the debt of one upon divine
right, but only in Ecclesiastical courtesy, and in regard of the Churches
mere constitution; and have thereupon obtruded on many other days as
religious respects or more, then on this (which yet the Apostles entitled in
name and practice the LORDS day) with the same spirit whereby they have
equalled traditions to the holy Scriptures.

Thus Cardinal Tolet Tolet. Instruct. lib.4. c.24,25.
allows on the LORDS day Iourneying, Hunting, Working, Buying, Selling,
Fayres, Fencing, and other private and public works, by him mentioned: and
says, a man is tied to sanctify the Sabbath, but not to sanctify it well: (a
new kind of distinction) the one is in hearing Mass, and ceasing from servile
works; the well-doing it, in spiritual contemplations etc. Another Bellarm.
de cultu sanct.l.3.c.10.
Cardinal is as fast as he is loose, affirming, That other holy days also
bind the conscience, even in cases void of contempt and scandale, as being
truly more holy then other days, and a part of divine worship, and not only
in respect of Order and Polity.

But to return to our Jewish Sabbath. Plutarch thought, that the Sabbath was
derived of Sabzein which signifies, to keep Reuell-rout, as was used in their
Bacchanals of (...) which is interpreted Bacchus, or the son of Bacchus, as
Coelius Rhodiginus Coel.Rhodig. Lect.Antiq.l.4.c.15.
shows out of Amphitheus and Mnaseas; who is therefore of opinion, That
Plutarch thought the Jews on their Sabbaths worshipped Bacchus, because they
did use on that day to drink somewhat more largely (a Sabbatising too much by
too many Christians imitated, which celebrate the same rather as a day of
Bacchus, then the LORDS day. Apoc.1.10.
) Bacchus his Priests were called Sabbi, Plutarch. Sympos.lib 4. (...)
of this their reuelling and misse-rule. Such wide conjectures we find in
others, whereas the Hebrews call it Sabbath, of (...) which signifies to
rest, because of their vacation to divine Offices, and not for idleness, or
worse employments. And for this cause all the festival Solemnities in the
Scripture E^^^.20.12.
are styled with this general title and appellation, as times of rest from
their wonted bodily services. Likewise their seventh year was Sabbathicall
Leuit.25. 2.
, because of the rest from the labors of Tyllage. In those feasts also, which
consisted of many days solemnity, the first and last were Sabbaths Leuit.23.
, in regard of the strictness of those days rest.

Luke Luk.6.1.
has an obscure place, which has much troubled Interpreters with the
difficulty thereof, (...) our English reads it, The second Sabbath after the
first. Isid.in Thom. Catena.
I sidore says it was so called of the Pascha and Azyma coming together.
Chrysostom thinks (as Sigonius cites him) it was when the Car.Sigon.de
Rep.Heb. l.3.c.13.

they kept their Passover in the second month. Stella in Luc. c.6.
Stella takes it for Manipulus Frugum, alleging Josephus his Author. Ambros.

Feasts: But Joseph Scaliger Scaliger.Can. Isag. l.3.
says, That the second day of the Feast was called (...) (being the sixteenth
day of the month, called Manipulus Frugum) and the Sabbaths which fell betwixt
that and Pentecost received their denomination in order from the same;
Secundo-primum, secundo-secundum, etc. And hence does Luke call that first
Sabbath which fell after that (...) or second day of the Feast, (...). Of this
we shall have occasion to say more when we come to the Samaritans. Infra,

The name Sabbath is also taken for the Luc.18.12, bis in Sabbat.

Ios. de Bell. Iud.l.7. c.24. Inter Arcas and Raphanaeas. Plin. l.31.c.2. in
Iudaea.
Josephus and Pliny tell of a River in Syria, in the Kingdom of Agrippa,
called Sabbaticus, which on other days ran full and swift, on the Sabbath
rested from his course. Petrus Galatinus P. Galat. de Arcan.l.11.c.9.
alleges the ceasing of this Sabbaticall stream for an argument of the
abrogation of the Jewish Sabbath.

The Jews were superstitiously strict in the observation of their Sabbath:
Ptolomey without resistance captiuating their City and themselves by this
advantage, as did Pompey afterward. And in the days of Matathias, father of
Judas Maccabeus, a thousand were murdered without resistance, till that by him
they were better advised: which appeared by the Pharisees, that cauilled at the
plucking and rubbing of a few ears of Corn, by the hungry Disciples, and at
their Master for healing on that day, though by his word: Which their
superstition, the Jew that fell into a Privy at Maidenburg, 1270, on his
Sabbath, and another at Tewskburie, 1220, (and were, the one by the Bishop of
the Place, the other by the Earl of Gloucester constrained to abide the
Christian Sabbath, whence on their own they would not be freed) testified to
the world by a stinking penance, and the later leaving also his stinking
superstitious soul behind to seal his devotion. They added of their own,
fasting that day till Noone, their Sabbath days journey, which was (says S.
Jerome) In vita Iosephi.

or two miles. Thus did this holy ordinance, which God had instituted for the
refreshing of their bodies, the instruction of their souls, and as a type of
aeternall happiness, vanish into a smoakie superstition amongst them. The
sacrifices and accustomed rites of the Sabbath are mentioned. Number.28.and
Leuit.23.and 24. Where we may read, that the daily burnt-offering, and
meate-offering, and drinke-offering, were doubled on the Sabbath, and the
shewbread renewed, etc.

The sanctification of days and times being a Hooker l.5. Ecclesiast.Polit.
token of that thankefulnes and a part of that public honor which we owe unto
God, he did not only enjoin, by way of perpetual homage, the sanctification
of one day in seven, which Gods immutable Law does exact for ever, but did
require also some other part of time with as strict exaction, but for less
continuance; besides accepting that which being left arbitrarie to the Church,
was by it consecrated voluntarily unto like religious uses. Of the first of
these (the Sabbath) we have spoken: of the Mosaicall Feasts, the NewMoones are
next to be considered. The institution hereof we read, Number.28. and the solemn
sacrifice therein appointed: so to glorify God, the Author of time and light,
which the darkened conceits of the heathens ascribed to the planets and bodies
celestial, calling the months by their names. Besides their sacrifices they
banquetted on this day, as appears by 1.Sam.20.5.
David and Saul: Where the day after was festival also, either so to spend the
surplusage of the former days sumptuous sacrifice, or for a farther pretext of
religion and zeal, as Martyr P. Mart in 1.Sam.
has noted. Sigonius Sigon.de Rep: Heb.l.3.c.4.
makes these New-moone days to be profestos, that is such wherein they might
labor, the sacrificing times excepted: but those covetous penny-fathers seem
of an other mind. When Amos 8.5.
(say they) will the New-moone be gone that we may sell corn, and the Sabbath
that we may sellwheate: and Es. I. the Sabbaths and New-moones are reckoned
together.

Their Passover, called of them Poesach, so called of the Angels passingouer
the Israelites in the common destruction of the Egyptian first born. For
Poesach, the Grecians use Pascha; of (...) to suffer, fitly in regard of the
body of that shadow CHRIST himself, who 1.Cor.5.7.
was our Paschall Lamb, in his suffering sacrificed for us.

The institution of this Feast is set down Exo. 12. as Hospiniax has noted in
the year after the creation of the world. 2447. Scaliger and Caluisius account
2453. Lydiat 2509. others otherwise.
after the flood 791. after the promise made to Abram, 430. it was celebrated
from the fifteenth to the one and twenty day of the month Abib or Nison, those
two days being more especially sanctified with a holy Convocation and
abstinence from work, except the dressing of their meat: the other being
observed with unleavened bread: and the fourteenth day being the Parascene, or
preparation in the evening of which fourteenth day, as some men hold opinion,
after sun set in the twilight, others in the fourth hour, or fourth part of
the day, as containing three hours space, before the going down of the Ios.de
Bell.7.17. says a nona vsque ad vndecimam hostias coedun^.
sun, the Paschal Lamb was slain, about which time (the ninth hour) Christ,
the true Pascha, yielded up the ghost. From which ninth hour the Jews began
their Vespera or Evening: and therefore it was enjoined them inter duas
Vesperas, to kill the Passover.

This Lamb or Kidde was chosen a male of a year old, the tenth day of the
moon, which they kept till the fourteenth day tied (after their traditions) to
the foot of some bench or form, so to minister occasion to their children, of
questioning about it, to themselves of preparation and meditation, and to epsy
in this mean while, if any default were in the Lamb. It was first a private
sacrifice to be performed in every house, after in that place ouely where the
Tabernacle or Temple was, they there dispersed by companies, according to
Josephus, not fewer then ten, sometime twenty, in a company; with Christ there
were thirty: and of these sacrifices and companies in time of Cestins, were
numbered 256500. so that reckoning the least number there were ten times so
many, besides those that by diseases or other manifold lets were not partakers
thereof: and in regard of this Feast being assembled thither through Gods just
judgment, their whole huge multitudes were couped or caged together in the
walls of this City to destruction, under Titus.

The blood of the Lamb they were to receive in a vessel, and to sprinkle the
same with a bunch of Hysope on the door posts, and to eat it in the night,
which was the beginning of the fifteenth day, roast with fire, with sour
herbs, and unleavened bread, both the head, feet, and purtenance; girded,
shod, with staves in their hands, in have, standing, burning whatsoever was
left of the same. There are that Hovinian.
think, that after the eating the sacramental Lamb, standing, they had other
provision which they eat sitting, Lipsius.
or after their manner of lying at table, in remembrance of their liberty, as
appears by John's leaning on his breast, and Judas his soppe at Christ's
Supper. They were in the even of the fourteenth day to purge their houses of
leaven, and that throughout the land, where the Lamb might not be eaten. All
the Israelites were enjoined this duty: and they which by occasion of
iourneying or uncleanness could not now celebrate the Passover, were to
observe it the next month. Number.9..

The day after, or second day of this Paschall Feast, they were to bring to the
Priest a Gomer of the first fruits of their corn, and a Lamb, with other
duties for a burnt offering to the Lord: before which time they might not eat
of the new years fruits, which at that time in those countries began to ripen,
and so to acknowledge God the giver thereof. Philo.Iud de vita.Mos.l.3.
Philo says, that each private man, which otherwise brought in his sacrifice
to the Priest, sacrificed or slew this sacrifice with his own hands: and
elsewhere In decalog.
he affirms the same. Eleazarus, Hospin. de festis. Iud.c.3. Maldonat. in
Mat.26.
or as other say the Synedrium, ordained 350. years before the birth of
Christ, that the Passover should not be solemnized on the second, fourth, or
sixth day of the week: and therefore when it fell on the sixth day, which we
call Friday, it was deferred to the seventh, at the time of Christ's Passion,
and he with his Disciples eat it the night before, according to the law of
God.

This Eleazarus ordained, that the Feast of Lots should not be celebrated on
the second, fourth, or seventh: Or Pentecost on the third, fifth, or seventh: Or
that of the Tabernacles on the first, fourth and sixth: Or the Fast of
Expiation, on the first, third, or sixth: Or their New-yeares day, on the first,
fourth, and sixth, which decree is extant in the book of Gamaliel, Paul's Mr.
which they did superstitiously, to avoid two Sabbaths (in so strict a rest)
together, and carrying boughs on the Sabbath, if that feast fell thereon, and
on other such reasonlesse reasons,

After this sixteenth day of the month, or second day of unleavened bread, in
which first of all sickle was thrust into the harvest, to offer the first
fruits thereof unto God, were numbered seven entire weeks, and the next day
which was the fiftieth, (accounting inclusiuely) was celebrated the Feast of
Pentecost, receiving his name of that reckoning of fifty: and Schefuoth, that
is, of weeks, because of this reckoning of seven weeks, it is called also the
Feast of the harvest of the first fruits: Exodus.23.16.
the rites thereof are prescribed. Leu. 23. The institution was in respect of
the law then given on Mount Sinai, and a type of that Evangelical law, which
Christ, having ascended up on high, did write not in Tables of stone, but in
fleshy tables of the heart, when (at the same Act. 2.4.
time) he gave the holy Ghost to his Disciples, as a remembrance also of the
author of their haruest-fruits and every good gift.

As the seventh day in the week, so the seventh month in the year, was in a
great part festival: fittest for that purpose, as the fruits of the Earth
being now inned.

The first day of this month was, besides the ordinary Kalendes or Festival
New-moone, the Feast of Trumpets, in respect of that rite then observed of
sounding Trumpets, being their New-yeares day, after the civil account: the
institution is read Leu. 23. and Number. 29. Whether, as some of the Rabbines
will have it, for Isaacs deliverance, that in remembrance of that Ram, these
Rams-horne trumpets should be sounded, or in regard of their wars, or in
respect of that spiritual warrefare which continues our whole life, or that
this was so festival a month, or the beginning of their year for civil
accounts, and for the Sabbaticall and Iubilecyeares or for some other cause,
let the wiser reader judge.

On the tenth day of this month was the Feast or Fast of Reconciliation or
Expiation, a day of public penance, fasting and afflicting themselves,
described in Leu.16. throughout the chapter, and chap. 23. wherein is lively in
that type showed the office of JESUS CHRIST, the eternal high Priest, who has
alone wrought our atonement, entered into the Holy place of heaven, and laid
our finnes on the scape-Goate, bearing them, and satisfying for them in his
own person on the Cross, and by the sprinkling of his blood sanctified us for
ever to GOD his Father. Paul. Heb.9. does unsold the mystery of this days
rites, wherein only, the High Priest alone might enter into the holy place,
and himself alone perform the other offices of Expiation. The Jews thought,
that this fasting and afflicting themselves was in respect of their Idolatry
with the golden Calfe, and therefore it seemed, that in Theodorets Theodoret
qu. 32.in Leuit.
time they did not afflict themselves, but sported rather in obscene and
profane manner. The sacrifices are set down. Number.29.8.9.10.11.

The next Feast was that of Tabernacles; in remembrance that howsoever they now
dwelleu in strong Cities, goodly houses, etc yet their fathers lived in tents
in the wilderness, where God by a cloud in the day time, and fire in the night,
protected that people. It is expressed Leu. 23. Number.29 Deuteronomy.16. It was observed
from the fifteenth to the one and twentieth, the first and last of them being
(as at the Passover) more solemnly feastiuall, with abstinence from labor,
and a general Convocation. They were the first day to take boughs and
branches of trees, and to make therewith boothes, and to dwell in boothes seven
days. This was neglected from the time of Iosuah, till the days of Nehemiah,
Nebem.8.
when he and Ezra solemnized this Feast seven days with boothes on their
house-tops, and in their Courts and streets, with lectures every day out of the
Law, and solemn assembly on the eight day. The Hebrews report that they made
them bundles of that matter, which they carried, every day of the seven, up and
down in the morning before they might eat, whereupon it was called the Feast
of Palms or Willowes. The seventh day says Paulus Fagius, Fag.in cap. Leu.23.
they compassed the Altar with these boughs seven times, in remembrance of the
fall of Jericho. Andrew Osiander, And Osiand. Annot. Harmon. Euan.l.3.c.36.
affi meth that they used this carrying about boughs every day, especially the
seventh, in which they observed a kind of procession or Letany singing, Ana
Iehoua Hosanna ana Iehoua hatz elicha-na: first reckoning up a great number of
the names of God, then of his attributes: thirdly, of the things which they
wish to be saved, then of themselves and other things interlacing every
particular of these with singing Hosanna, like their Ora pro nobis in the
Popish Letany. Then they alter it in another form, Pray redeem the Vine of thy
planting, Hosanna, etc. then in another, As thou sauedst the strong, in Egypt,
when thou went out for their deliverance, so Hosanna, etc. Then in a longer
form of prayers, with this foot of the song Hosanna: and lastly all rings
Hosanna, Hosanna: and hereupon the later Jews called this Feast Hosanna, as
also those bundles of boughs: and although that the later Jews have now added
much, 21 moth. 9.
the Jews of Italy differing from them of Germany, yet in Christ's time the
acclamations of Hosanna, when he came riding on an Ass into Jerusalem,
testify some such observation then amongst them.

The sacrifices of every day are designed Number. 29. The first day, thirteen
bullockes, the second, twelve, and every day one less to the seventh: in all
70 (as the Rabbines interpret it) according to the number of the 70. languages
of the Nations, which shall be subdued to the Messiah; and 98. Lambs, in
respect of so many curses in the law, against the transgressing Israelites.

The eight day was the Feast which they called Haaziph, Job.7.37. Number, 29.35.
and Azaereth, that is Collection, called also the great day of the Feast, in
the two and twentieth day of this month Tisri. In this they were to Contribute
to the continual sacrifices, and public thanksgiving was made for the fruits
of the Earth, and the first fruits of the later fruits were offered. Jeroboam
Hospin.de fest. c.7.
in an irreligious policy removed the Feast of Tabernacles from the seventh
month to the eight, from Tisri to Marchesuan.

The seventh year was appointed a Sabbaticall year wherein they were neither
to so we nor to reap, but to leave that which should voluntarily grow in their
fields and yards to the poor, and secondly should not, exact debt of their
brethren of the same Nation, but remit it. Deuteronomy. 15. Exodus.23. Leu. 25. and the
observation here of is expressed in the time of Nehemiah Nehem.10.31.


After seven times seven years which make forty nine, they were to reckon
Iobel or year of Iubilee. Leu. 25. beginning on the day of Reconcilation:
Wherein servants were freed, debts remitted, possessions, that had been
alienated, returned, the law allowing no further sales, proclaimed with sound
of a Trumpet of a Rammes-horne, and therefore called Iobel, which signifies a
Ram, or Rammes-horne.

Touching this year of Iubilee is much controversy. The ancient Authors
account it the fiftieth year. Scaliger Ios.Scal. Animad.in Eusebius. page.1^.
refuses their authority herein. Many modern writers hold the same opinion,
as Hospin. de Temp. and de Fest. Iud.
Hospinian, Melan. Chron. l.^.
Melancthon, Fabritius Fab. Pad. Catenatemp.annul. 40.
Paduanus, etc. Caluis.Isag^ge c.23.
Caluisius at large disputed this question against Crentzhemins and
Bucholcerus, by diverse arguments proouing that the Iubilee was but forty nine
years complete, and that the fiftieth year was the first onwards of another
Iubilee or Sabbath of years: Yet is this space reckoned by fifty, as Ovid
calls the Olympiad, quinquennis Olympias; Aristophanes, Aristoph. in Pluto.
and Ausonius Ansonius de ludis.
affirming the like: and yet the Olympiade is but four years complete, and
reckoned from the fifth to the fifth exclusiuely. Otherwise they should have had
two Sabbaticall years together, namely the forty ninth being the seventh
year, and the next which was the fiftieth year. As for the later writers,
they might be deceived by following the stream, and beguiled by the Popish
Iubilee, which Boniface the eight, before called Benedictus, (and yet neither
was good sayer nor dooer) instituted, Anno 1300. to be observed every hundredth
year: and Clement the sixth abridged to the fiftieth: as Auentinus, Trithemius,
Cranizius, and other have written. Whether they were heathenish in imitating
the Ludi seculares, or Jewish in following the legal Iubilee: Certain it is,
Rome thereby becomes a rich mart, where the Apec. 18.11.
Merchants of the Earth resort from all places of the Earth to buy heaven: and
Babylon V.16.

the souls of men washed from their sins; A thing more precious to CHRIST
then his most precious blood. But his pretended Vicars have learned to effect
it (the filling of their purse) with greater ease: devout Pilgrims from all
parts, visiting Saint Peter's stairs, whence they go truly Saint Peter's
heirs, Act.3.6.
Silver and gold have I none, and yet find their pardons too cheap to be
good. But to return to our Pilgrimage, and to obsserue the observation of the
Jewish Iubilee; This Feast was partly civil in regard of the poor, of the
inheritances, of the Israelitish Families, specially that of the Messiah, and
of the computation of times, as amongst the Greeks by Olympiads, and amongst
the Romans by Lustra and Indictions: partly also it was mystical in regard of
the Gospel of CHRIST, preaching liberty and peace to the Conscience, the
acceptable year of the Lord.

And thus much of those Feasts which God himself instituted to this Nation:
which how the Jews of later times have corrupted, and do now superstitiously
observe, instituting others also of their own deuisings, shall be handled in
due place. We are next to speak of those Feasts, which upon occasions they
imposed upon themselves before the coming of CHRIST: to which we will add a
brief Calendar of all their Fasts and Feasts.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Feasts and Fasts, which the Jews instituted to themselves: with a
Calendar of their feasts and fasts through the year as they are now observed.

THE Prophet Zachary, in his 7. and 8. Chapters mentions certain fasting
days which the Jews by Ecclesiastical Iniunction observed. One in the tenth
day of the tenth month, because that on that day Jerusalem began to be
besieged. 2. Reg. 24. A second fast was observed on the ninth day of the fourth
month, in remembrance that then the Chaldeans entered the City.

A third fast they held on the ninth day of the fifth month in respect of the
City and Temple burned on that day, First by Nabuchodonosor: Secondly by
Titus, on the same day: which the Jews do yet observe with strict penance,
going barefoote and sitting on the ground, reading some sad history of the
Bible, and the Lamentations of Jeremy, three times over.

Their fourth fast they celebrated on the third day of the seventh month, in
remembrance of Godoliah slain by Ismael, Ier.41.42. 2. Reg.vlt. To these are
reckoned the fast of Ester, in the thirteenth day of Adar, their twelfth
month; and on the seventeenth day of the fourth month, in the remembrance of
the Tables of the Law broken by Moses: the institution whereof seems to be
late, seeing the scripture does not mention it. In this month the Egyptians
kept the feast or fast of their Ofiris, lamenting for him, which seems to be
the same that is mentioned. Ezech. 8 Where women are said to mourn for Tamuz,
whom Plutarch calls Amuz, and from thence deriueth Jupiters title of Ammon.
Of him was this fourth month called Tamuz.

On the Ester.9.21.
fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar, they kept the feast of Phurim, or lots
instituted in remembrance of that deliverance from Haman; by the authority of
Ioachim the high Priest, as Funccius relates out of Philo. Anno M. 3463.
Caluis.3477.
Antonius Margarita a christened Jew, reports that on these days the Jews
read the history of Ester, and so often as Haman is mentioned, they smite on
their seats with their fistes and hammers, otherwise spending the time of this
feast in Bacchanall riots and excess.

They had the feast also of wood-carrying called (...) mentioned by Joseph.de
bells Iud.l.2.c.17.
Josephus, in which the custom was for every one to carry wood to the Temple
to maintain the fire of the Altar.

The Feast of Dedication, otherwise called the Feast of Lights, and the
institution thereof is largely described. Mac.4. in remembrance of the
restitution of divine worship and sacrifice in the Temple, which had been by
Antiochus polluted, and sacred to Jupiter Olympius, all the services appointed
by the law being abolished. By Judas Macabeus, the Temple and Altar, and other
holy instruments, were dedicated the same day three years after their first
pollution, called therefore the Feast of Lights, as I think says
Ios.Ant.12.c.2.
Josephus, because so unexpected a light shone forth unto them. But Franciscus
Iunius, in his Annotations upon the Syrian translation of the tenth of John,
where this Feast is mentioned, alleges out of the Talmud an other cause as
follows. When on the 25 day of Cislen they entered into the Temple, they
found not pure oil, except in one little vessel, which contained sufficient
for the lamps but one day, of which oil they lighted the lamps in order,
which lasted eight days, till they prested out of the Olives clean Oil. And
therefore the Wisemen of that time decreed, that yearly those eight days
beginning at the 25. of Cisten should be days of joy, and that every one in
the doors of their houses every evening during those eight days should light
lamps, for declaration of that miracle, wherein they must not fast nor lament.

Likewise I. Mac.13.is ordained festival the 23. day of Iar, for the expiation
of the Tower of Jerusalem by Simon Mac.

Sigonius reckons also the feast of Iephta, in the end of the year, which
yet is not like to have continued in succeeding ages: and of the fire that we
have mentioned in 2. Mac.1. and the Feast of Judith, for killing Holofernes:
and on the fourteenth day of Adar, for the victory against Nicanor, Ios.l. 12.
Their later feasts I shall mention, and declare their several ceremonies, when
we come to speak of their later times, and of the present Jewish
superstition. In the mean time I think it not amiss to set down here out of
Scaliger, a view or Calendar of their months, with the feasts and fasts, as
they are observed therein at this day. Ios.Scal.Can.Isag.l.1.c.6.

CHAP. VII.
Of the ancient Oblations, Gifts, and Sacrifices of the Jews: and of their
Priests, and persons Ecclesiastical, and Religious.

ALthough Moses does handle this matter of their Rites and Sacrifices, and is
herein seconded and interpreted by the succeeding Prophets, so fully, that it
may seem a pouring of water into the Sea, to speak needlessly, or by our
Discourse, to obscure, rather than illustrate, that which is so largely and
plainly there expressed; yet because of that subject which we have in hand, I
cannot altogether be silent (at least of the kinds and heads) referring the
desirous Reader for his more perfect satisfaction in particulars, to those
cleerer prophetical fountains. Their rites for time and place we have already
described: The next intended part of this Jewish relation shall be of their
Oblations, which were either Gifts or Sacrifices. Their sacrifices were such
oblations, wherein the thing offered was in whole or part consumed in divine
worship, for the most part by fire or shedding of blood. These were of eight
Car.Sigon.de Republ. Heb.l.4.
sorts. Burnt-offerings, Meate-offerings, Peace Offerings, Sinne-offerings,
Trespasse-offerings. the offerings of Consecration. Cleansing and Expiation.
Philo de Sacrif.
Philo reduces them to three: Burnt, Peace and Sinne-offerings, according to
the three causes of sacrificing; The worship of God the obtaining of good
things, and freedom from evil.

The Burnt-offerings were by fire consumed, the rites and manner here of is
expressed, Leuitic. 1. the fire was to be perpetual on the Altar, being that
which GOD miraculously sent from heaven to consume Aarons sacrifice; for
neglecting which, and using other, his two sons Nadab and Abihu were stricken
by a revenging fire from GOD. The Meat offering was made of fine flower,
without honey or leven, and with oil and incense on the altar, or frying pan,
or oven, or caldron, according to the rites prescribed, Leuit. 2. partly sacred
to the LORD by fire, the rest to be the Priests. The Peace Offerings are with
their proper ceremonies enjoined Leu. 3. and 7; the fat and kidneys were to be
burned on the Altar (the fat and blood being universally forbidden them for
food) the breast and right shoulder was the Priests: the rest to the
sacrificer, to be eaten the first, or at furthest on the second day: or else
on the third to be burnt with fire. The offering for sins of ignorance for
the Priest, Prince, people or private man, is set down Leu. 4. and 6. The
Sinne-offering in case of contempt, where the sin is committed against GOD
and man willingly, with the due manner thereof is expressed, Leu. 6. To these
were adjoined Prayers and praises, with musical voices, and instruments,
cymballs, violes, harpes, and trumpets resounding For he is good, for his mercy
endures for ever. The sixth kind of sacrifices was proper to the Priests at
their consecration, recorded Le 6. 20. The seventh mentioned sacrifice is of
purification or cleansing, as of a woman after childbirth, Le. 12. or of a
Leper 13. 14. or for unclean issues of men and women, cha. 15. The eight is
the sacrifice of Expiation or Reconciliation, on that festival or fasting day
before spoken of, Le. 16. Hereunto may we add the lights and the daily offering
of incense, morning and evening, Exodus 20 on a golden altar, whereunto the
Priests only had access, with such perfume only as is there prescribed.

The Gifts, which we have reckoned a second sort of Oblations, that were not as
the former in whole, or in part consumed in their offering, but preserved whole
and sound, were given, either according to the Law, or by Vow, or of free will.
The Law prescribed First Fruits and Tithes, and the personal halfe-shekel The
first fruits of Man, of beasts, and of the fruits of the earth, the Law
exacteth, Exodus 22. 23. and are assigned to the Priests, Number. 5 and 18. which,
of men and unclean beasts, were to be redeemed, of others to be sacrificed. Of
Tithes. when we consider the assignement of them to the Tribe of Leui, we must
so far acknowledge them Leuiticall and Ceremonial. But some, considering the
paying of them to a Priest, so soon as we read of a Priest, 14 Gen.20
in Scripture, and that by the father of the faithful (which the Apostle
urges against Leuiticall Ceremonies, in that Leui himself in Abraham paid
them) and his nephew Jacob vowed the payment thereof so soon as GOD should
give him whereof to pay Tithes; and that (the first times of the Christian
Church excepted, wherein there was no such settled order for things of this and
like nature) Tithes were paid to the Church, until the Arch-enemy of GOD and
his Church, in his Antichristian supremacy robbed the Ministers of that due,
which in GODS right they before held, impropriating the living of the Altar to
them that lived not at the Altar but yet ordinarily leaving them to the Church
(as they then accounted the Church): cannot so easily subscribe to that opinion
perhaps more common then true, which disanull divine right of the non-paying
Tithes, as being then a Jewish and Leuiticall ceremony. But I leave the Reader
to discuss this matter further, with Master Carlcton in his Treatise of that
Argument; whose reasons, if they want weight in any man's judgment, yet let the
same consider an other supply, not at all favoring of Iudaisme: namely, that M.
Dow^am.
Tithes are due to Christian Ministers by Vow: Christian Commonweals, and
Counsels having consecrated them to GOD and his Church: neither is it now time
after the Vows to inquire, and without Divine dispensation to alter it,
without satisfaction sufficient. But leaving this sore too tender to be
touched, and yet little touching and moving some consciences pretended tender;
let us view the Tithes, as they then were, Jewish. In Leu. 27.30. is a
declaration of the Lords right, All Tithes are the Lords; and an assignation of
the same, Numb. 18.21. Behold, I have given the children of LFVI all the tenth
etc S. Hicron.super Ezech.
Hierome reckons four sorts of Tithes: first, that which the people paid to
the Levites: secondly, that which the Levites hence paid to the Priests Number.
18.26.
: Thirdly, that which they reserved for expense in their solemn feasts when
they went to the Tabernacle or Temple Deuteronomy. 14.22.
. The fourth was a third years Tenth, which was then laid up for the Leuite,
and the poor amongst them Deuteronomy. 14.28.
. The practice hereof Nehemiah restored in the reformation of Religion,
Neha.10. when the First Fruits and Tenths were brought to the treasury or
chambers of the house of GOD.

Besides First Fruits and Tithes, they paid to the treasury personal
offerings, as Exodus 10.12. every man paid half a shekel, which the Hebrews
interpreted to be perpetual for the maintenance of the Sacrifices; others
temporary, then only put in practice. As for that collection 2. Reg.12. made
by Ioas for the repayring of the Temple, and that after by Nehem.ca.10. the
circumstances show much difference. This treasury, in regard of this
Poll-money, grew very rich, as appeared in I^s. Int. 14. 12.
Crassus robbing the same of ten thousand talents at one time, besides a
great beam of gold, which Eleazarus the Treasurer, upon Cressus his oath,
(afterward violated nevertheless) to redeem the rest delivered to him,
weighing three hundred minae, every mina being two pounds, two ounces, and a
quarter Troy. Tully Cic.Pro Murena.
and other Authors mention these Oblations of the Jews to their treasury
yearly.

These Gifts and Offerings the Law exacted: they performed many other also,
either of their Free Will or of Vow, otherwise little differing from the
former, Leuitvltim. Many other Ceremonies of their meats, garments, fastings,
trumpets, and in other cases, I hope I shall have leave to omit in this place,
and remit him that would further know of them to the Scripture it self: having
pointed out the principal.

But by this is apparent, which Doctor Downam Downams Sermon of the Dignity,
etc.
has observed, that all these being delivered them in the Lords treasury,
without their labor or cost, together with their 48. cities assigned them,
amounted to a far greater proportion for the maintenance of that small Tribe,
then all the Bishoprics, Benefices, Colledge-lands, or whatsoever other
Ecclesiastical indowments and profits in this land, although the profane
Ammonites or hypocritical Cloysterers had never conspired to shave off our
2.Sam.10.
beards, and our garments by the buttocks, not leaving to D.Smith ser.
Blacksmith.
cover our nakedness, or their shame: And yet how sick is Ahab for Naboths
vineyard? And would GOD we had no Iezabels to play the (too cunning) Physicians
in this disease. Let me have a little leave to say no more then others (for the
substance) in Books and Sermons have said already: although those Bellies to
whom we speak, have no ears. The first stroke which wounded us, and causes
us still to halt, was from Rome, the mother of abominations and rohoredomes.
Here, as in the suburbs of Hell, were founded the Churches ruins: our Bulls
of Bashan, (Abbey-lubbers, and Cloysterers) with the leaden horns of those
Roman Bulls have pushed down our Churches, (our Chauncells at least) and made
them to fall into those Apoc. 18 2.
Cages of unclean Birds, the Popish Monasteries. Of nine thousand two hundred
eighty and four parishes in England, Camden Bri^tan. Edit. vlt.
after M. Camdens account, three thousand eight hundred forty five were (it is
properly termed) impropriated. And who knows whether those Appropriations did
not supplant these Supplanters, and dispropriate them of that which in a iuster
propriety was given them in their first foundations, for that threefold
maintenance of themseluaes, of learning, and of the poor: yea happily yet (if
we observe the course of Divine Justice) we may see many, whose former
inheritances have by the additions of these, as of a contagious garment, been
infected, and have either died, or bin sick at the least, of this plague. How
fitly and fully do those words of Habacuk Hab.2.9, 10, 11, 12.
agree to the houses founded for religion, by this and like irreligion
perverted, and at last subverted Vbi supra.
They coueted an evil covetousness to their houses, they consulted shame to
their own houses, by destroying many people, and sinned against their own
souls. The stone has cried out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber
has answered it, Woe unto him that builds a town with blood, and erecteth a
City by iniquite. Thus we see, the stones have cried out of their walls
indeed, and by their demolished heaps may receive Labans name, Iegar
sahadutha, the Gen.31.47.
heap of witness, their ruins remaining testimonies of GODS judgments. A
violent stream (says master Camden Vbisupra.
) breaking through all obstacles, has rushed out upon the Ecclesiasticke state
of this Land, and overwhelmed, to the Worlds wonder, and Englands grief, the
greatest part of the English Clergy, with their most beautiful buildings; and
those riches which the Christian piety of the English had from the time of
their first Christianity consecrated to GOD, were (as it were) in a moment
dispersed, and (if I may so say) profaned.

Let none traduce me as a troubler of Israel, and a traducer of our Law and
State, which have thus both changed and settled these things. I inueigh against
Absoloms conspiracy, and Achitophels devises, which were the troublers of
Israel, and so disturbed the just heart of righteous David, that on the sudden
he a little forgot the exact rule: and commanded, Thon 2.Sam.19.29
and Ziba divide the Lands. So (if loosers may have leave to speak) our
Parliament (perhaps with some ecstasy of joy, for removing the sinks and
stinckes of superstition) had in those busy times but negligent consideration
of Mephibosheths right: and our Vicar- Mephibosheths, the Clergy then, did not
much urge it, yea we would still say of these our halting Zibaees, Let them
take all, rather then we should want our Lord and his Gospel, to come home to
us in peace. And in peace, let them rest which were Authors of this peace to
us; and let us pray that a worse generation of vipers do not arise, and that
the Joel 1.4.
Canker-worme eat not what the Grasshopper has left, and the Caterpiller the
residue of the Canker worm. I mean those Latron-patrons, and Patron-latrons,
whereof these extend to the utmost whatsoever might, and whatsoever color of
right, in Exemptions, Customs, Let me have the like liberty to inueigh against
vices here, as Espensaeus was allowed among the Papists, who speaking of the
Romish proceedings, says, Sedis Apostolice summ^ iura, hoc est summae,
inioriae, priuilegia hoc est abusus, consuetudines, hoc est, corruptelae: I
speak only against abusers of law and right.
Privileges and prauileges, whereby every Iohn-a-Stile shall intercept the
Churches due, or by a weightier fee, force a composition, or wrangle out some
broken Title, or break the neck of the Case with a Prohibition: the other
having a trust committed, makes himself a bawd, and sells his Church (which
cost no meaner price then the blood of CHRIST) for money. Oh Christ, overthrow
the Tables of these Monychangers, and with some whippe drive them, scourge them
out of thy Temple, which supplant thy plantations, and hinder the gaining of
Souls for gain. Withstand these Balaams, which for Balaks blessing, care not
what curse they bring upon Israel, which present for presents, and scrape to
maintain their carnal living, out of our spiritual Livings; to bestow on
their Hawks, their Hounds, their! But whither has this passion, or zeal
(Truth I am sure) transported me? Truly, the fixed Stars in our Westminster
firmament (and may not I so call it, where is such a Star Chamber, shining
with the bright beams of Justice?) I admire, and almost adore in silence:
only those wandering planets, which selfe-guiltinesse accuses, do I here
accuse.

And for these, and all the Churches enemies, Let GOD arise, and his enemies,
(or their enmity) be scattered, that there be no more such t.Reg.21.
Ahabs, as I mentioned, which having more then enough, seem to have nothing,
as long as Naboth has something which they can long for: and that there be no

Eliashibs, which shall provide Tobias the Ammonite a Chamber in the house of
the LORD: that neither any abuse the profession of Law, directly; nor the
possession of Patronage, indirectly; (for abuses only I tax) so to discover
our Churches nakedness, that every Cham (the profane Atheist, and
superstitious Papist) may epsy and deride the same, wherein themselves are the
most guilty amongst us; although none are more ready to 1. Sam.1.20.
tell it in Gath, or publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, that the daughters
of Babylon may triumph.

After that we have spoken of the Times, Places, and Rites sacred to GOD,
order requires next to speak of those Persons, whose office and function it
was to procure and manage those Divine and Religious affairs. And first,
amongst the first Hebrews, we find no Priest named before Abraham's time, in
which Melchizedech was interpreted by the most, to be Shem the son of Noah.
Father both of this and other Nations: and Master Broughton has written a
whole Book in confirmation hereof. The heads of Families then exercised the
Priestlie office of teaching, praying, and sacrificing in their own households,
as we read of Genesis 18.19.
Abraham, Isaac, Genes.37.
and Gen.49.^
Jacob. After that, the first borne of all the Tribes of Israel were
consecrated to this business, when as GOD had destroyed the firstborn of
Egypt, Exodus.13.2.and 15.
and these offered Sacrifices Exodus.24.5.
until that the Levites were chosen in their room; Number.3.41.
GOD turning that prophetical curse of Jacob, of Gen.49.7.
scattering them in Israel, into a blessing, for the instructing of the
Israelites. The cause of this their consecration was, because they, Exodus.32.29.
in a zeal of GODS glory, had sanctified their hands to this ministry in
the blood of the nearest of their idolatrous kindred, that had sinned in adoring
the golden Calfe.

Now in the third of Numbers, where the firstborn of the Israelites, and the
Levites are numbered, appears a difficulty, which most of the Interpreters
which I have read of that place, have neglected: namely, that of the
Israelitish firstborne there were found, from a moneth-old upward, two and
twenty thousand, two hundred seventy and three, and of the Levites, but two
and twenty thousand; so that therefore there must be five shekels a piece
paid for the redemption of every of those two hundred seventy and three in
surplusage more then the Levites; whereas yet in the parcells of the Leuiticall
account, are found more of the Levites then of the Israelites, as appears;
the family of the Gershonites containing seven thousand and five hundred, the
Kohathites, eight thousand six hundred, and the family of Merari, six thousand
and two hundred, which being added together, amount to two and twenty thousand
and three hundred; and therefore are seven and twenty more then the
Israelites. To this Lyra in Number. Diony^ Carthus. Iun. adds also in the number
of Priests.
Lyrae, Dionysius Carthusianus, and Iunius (for the most are wholly silent)
answer, that those three hundred over and above the two and twenty thousand
were firstborn themselves, and therefore in right of the former challenge of
the firstborn, were the LORDS already. And if it seem as much wonder, (which
Authors observe not) that of two and twenty thousand were but three hundred
firstborn; But one of 74.
That their exploit of executing their kindred for idolatry (before mentioned)
in which sin, the firstborn, as Priests, were likeliest to have followed
Aaron, a chief man of their Tribe, might answer for me. And that cruel Edict
Exodus.9.
of Pharao, and their miraculous fruitfulness, may make it less strange, that
both in these Levites there were so few firstborne, and in the other Israelites
also, with whom amongst 603550. men from twenty years old upwards, there were
(though reckoning but from a month old, as is said) but 22273. which is little
more then one of seven and twenty, besides that inequality of the persons
numbered. This excursion upon this occasion, wherein I have found diverse
Interpretets mute, will (I hope) find pardon with the Reader, who happily
himself may find some better resolution.

To return to our History; GOD had before appointed Aaron to be high Priest,
and his sons Exodus.28.
to be Priests, to whom the Levites were assigned after (as we have said) as
assistants in inferior offices of the Tabernacle. Aaron, from whom is reckoned
the succession of the high Priests in the same office, had appointed to him
eight holy garments, a breast plate, an ephod, a robe, a broidred coat, a
miter, a girdle, a plate of gold, and linen breeches. Also his sons had
appointed to them coats, and bonets, and girdles, and breeches: which their
attire is described at large, Exo. 28. Josephus writes of the Stones there
mentioned, That that on the Priests right shoulder shined forth very bright,
when GOD was pleased with their Sacrifices, as did also those twelve in the
breast plate, when in the time of war GOD would assist them, which ceased
miraculously to shine two hundred years before his time; or as the Talmudists
say, from the building of the second Temple.

The consecration of the Priests, and rites thereof are mentioned, Exodus 29.
The conditions required in the high Priest, as that he should not have the
bodily defects of blindness, lamenes, maimednes, etc. nor should uncover his
head, and many other such like, are expressed, Leu. 21. His Leuit.244.
office was daily to light the Lights at the evening, and to burn incense at
morning and evening, and once every Sabbath to set the Shewbread before the
LORD to sacrifice, and once a year to make reconciliation in the holy place,
etc. This office they executed till the Captivity, after which they ruled also
in the Commonwealth, and the family of the Maccabees obtained temporal and
spiritual jurisdiction, being both Priests and Kings. But the state being
usurped by others, they also appointed high Priests at their pleasures: and
thus were Annas and Caiphas high Priests, although Caiphas alone administered
the office, which was abrogated to Annas, the name only remaining: and thus
Josephus says, that Anna was most happy, who had himself been high Priest,
and seen all his sons in that office, whereas in the institution, and before
the Captivity, this office continued ordinarily with their lives: which after
they enjoyed longer or shorter, at pleasure of the Conqueror.

Next unto the high Priest, were the Priests lineally descended from Eleazar
and Ithamar the sons of Aaron, as in number many, so in their priestly
rayments, consecration, condition, and office, much differing from the sormer,
as appears; for their garments, Leuitic. 28. their consecration 29. their
conditions required in them, Leu. 10. and 21. and their office in some things,
as preaching, praying, sacrificing, not much unlike to the former, but in
degree, sometime assisting him in these things, sometime alone, and in some
things, nothing participating, as in Moses plainly may be seen. These priestly
families, being of the house of Eleazar sixteen, and of Ithamar eight, which
David by lot distributed into four and twenty orders, according to the number
of the heads of families, those four and twenty men, chief of those orders,
being to the high Priest, as Aarons sons were unto him in their ministry, 1.
Chronic. 24. and took turns by course, in perfourming of the same as Luke
shows Lu.1.5.
in the example of Zachary. Josephus Joseph. in App. and in vita.
testifies the same, and affirms, That in each of these ranks were more
then five thousand men in his time: and in the history of his life, says,
that himself was of the first of these orders, betwixt which was no small
difference, and the heads of these were called also Chief Priests Ez.8.Mar.14
Acts 4.
in the old and new Testament.

The Levites had the next place in the legal ministry: all that descended of
Leui, except the family of Aaron, being thus called: and Number. 3. according to
the descent of the three sons of Leui had their Offices assigned them, which
so continued till the days of David. He distributed them according to their
families unto their several functions, twenty four thousand to the service
of the Temple: six thousand to be Judges and Rulers, four thousand Porters,
and four thousand which praised the LORD upon instruments. These were divided
under their Heads or Principalls according to their 1.Chr. 23.24,
families. The Leuiticall Musicians, with their Offices and Orders are
reckoned. 1. Chron. 25. and 2. Chron. 7. These in stead of the silken stole,
which they ware, obtained in the days of Agrippa, to wear a linen one, like
the Priests. The Porters are in the 26. of 1. Chron. described according to
their families, orders and offices. They kept, in their courses, the doors and
treasures of the Temple: to keep the same clean, and to keep that which was
unclean out of the same: and these all are mustered in their offices 2. Chron.
35.

The Gibeonites, called after Nethanims, were at hand unto the Levites in the
meanest offices about the Tabernacle and Temple, Ios. 9.21. and 1. Chro. 9.
assigned hereunto first by Ioshu.1, after by David and the Princes, for the
service of the Levites to cut wood, and draw water, for the house of GOD, Ezra
8. Besides these Ecclesiastical persons in the ordinary ministry of the
temple, were other, which may no less be counted holy: either in regard of
Vow, as the Sea the institution of them, Number.6.2
Nazarites for a time: Sampson is an especial example hereof, and James the
Just, brother of our LORD: or else they were Prophets by extraordinary calling,
as Samuel, Esaias, Jeremy, and others: to whom GOD manifested his will by
dreams, visions, and revelations; whose ordinary habit seems to be a rugged
hairie garment, by the example of 2.Reg1.8. Isu.20.2.
Elijah, and the false Zach.13.4.
Prophets, and of Mat.3.4.
John Baptist afterward. And thus much of those persons, which according to the
Law were sacred to GOD: it follows that we should observe their superstitious
deuoting of themselves, according to their own devises and traditions, unto a
supposed service of GOD. In a more strict manner then ordinary, or some-way in
opinion and practice differing both from the law, and the rest of the Jewish
people. Of this kind were many Sects, whereof we are next to speak.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the diverse Sects, Opinions, and Alterations of Religion, amongst the
Hebrews.

IN this matter of Alterations, and altercations amongst them about Questions
and practice of Religion, we are in the first place to observe their often
apostacies Philastrius reckoning therein their idolatries, numb^ eth 28. Iewith
sects: and as Scaliger observes, and the Scripture will bcare i^, might by
that rule have reckoned many other.
from the truth of the Law to the idolatrous superstitions of the neighboring
Nations: as the Relics of their Egyptian idolatry in the golden Calfe Exo.
32. their often murmurings in the desert, the presumption of Nadab and Abihu,
and after of Aaron and Miriam, the conspiracy of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
Balaams stumbling-blocke, to couple them in idolatrous service to Baal-Peor,
the idol of the Moabites: And after their possession of the Land, when Joshua
and the Elders were dead, they served Iud.2.12,13.
the gods of the people that were round about them, as Baal and Ashtaroth: of
the idols and their rites is before spoken. And although Gideon cut down the
grove, and destroyed the altar of Baal, Iud.6.27.
yet he made an Ephod of the earerings of the prey, and put it in Ophrah his
City, and all Israel went a whoring there after it Iud.8.27,33.
: and after his death, made Baal-berith their god. They served also the GODS of
Aram, Zidon, Moab, Ammon, Iud.10.6.
and the Philistims: Michah lud.17 and18.
an Ephramite made an house of gods, an Ephod, and Teraphim, and consecrated
one of his sons to be his Priest; and after set a Leuite, Jonathan, in his
room, the occasion of apostacy to a great part of the Tribe of Dan, all the
while the house of GOD was in Shiloh: besides the corruption of state and
religion by the Beniamites Iud.19.
and by 1.Sam.2.12.
Hophni and Phinehas the sons of Eli.

But after the reformation of Religion by Samuel, David, and Solomon, (who yet
became after an idolatour) befell their greatest Apostasy, to wit, of the
ten Tribes; from GOD, their King, and Religion, by the ouer-wise policy of
Jeroboam, which corrupted and subverted both it and himself. He (least those
revolted Israelites should, by frequenting GODS appointed worship at Jerusalem,
recknowledge their former and truer LORD) consecrated two Egyptian Calves at
Bethel and Dan 1.King.12.
, and made an House of High Places, and Priests of the lowest of the people.

Judah also made them, in the same times, High Places, Images, and Groves, on
every high Hill, and under every green Tree. Yet had the Kingdom of Judah
their entercourses of corruption and reformation, according as they had good or
bad Kings; but in Israel, the Commonwealth and Church received, by that sin
of Jeroboam, an incurable wound and irrecouerable loss, until that, in GODS
just punishment, they were carried away by the Assyrian Kings into Assyria, and
into Hala, Habor, and the Cities of the Medes, as 2. King. 17. appears, where
is recorded a summarie collection of these and other their idolatries. Of these
exiled Israelites (if we believe the reports and conjectures of diverse
Authors) are descended those Tartarians, which since ouer-ran, with their
Conquests, a greater part of Asia and Europe, then ever any other Nation,
before or since: of which their Original and Exploits, we shall in fitter
place further discourse. The other Kingdom of Judah, although it received
sometime some breathing and refreshing under her more virtuous and religious
Kings, yet for the most part, groaning under Tyranny and Idolatry, was at
last a prey to the Babylonians: from which servitude being freed by the Persian
Monarchs, under varieties of adverse and prosperous fortunes, it was
afterward rent and tome by the Macedonians, being made a common Stage for the
Arms and Armies of the successors of Ptolomey in Egypt, and Seleucus in Asia;
remaining meede unto the Conqueror, and receiving no small impressions and
wounds in Soul as well as Body, in Religion as in Polity. But being after
delivered from Macedonian thraldom by the Family of the Macchabees, the
Government, Ecclesiastical and Temporal, became theirs, but the minds of
this Jewish people was in those Times divided in diversity of Sects and
Opinions, of which the Evangelical and other Histories make mention.

The opinions of the Jews may be reduced Halls Pharisaisme and Christianity.
Synagoga Iudaic. cap.2.
into these two general Heads: the one were such as contented themselves with
the Law of GOD, and were called Karraim, or Koraim, of which sort there are
diverse at this day in Constantinople, and other-where: The other Rabbinists,
Supererogatorie (as Master Hall calls them) and Popish Jews, called Hasidim,
professing a more strict Holiness then the Law required: Yet at first these
both pleased themselves, and did not, by opposition of Science, displease each
other, and disagreeing in opinion, they yet in affection agreed. But when these
voluntary Services began to be drawn into Canons, and of arbitrarie became
necessary, they were rent into sundry Sects. Of these and their original let
us hear Scaliger speak.

There were Ios. Scal. Elench. Triber. Nich. Serrar. c.22. He calls these two
sects cap.2. Karraim, of Kara, which signifies the Scripture: and Rabban^m,
which were the Wisemen, (...) after called Pharisees.
(says he) before the times of Hasmonaei, two kinds of Dogmatists, men
holding differing opinions, among the Jews: the one only accepting the
written Law; the other Tradition, or the addition to the Law. Of the former
kind arose the Karraim, of whom came the Sadducees; of the later, the
Pharisees. These Pharisees were the issue of the Hasidees.

The Hasidees were a Corporation, Guild, or Fraternity, which voluntarily
addicted themselves to the Offices of the Law, I. Macchabees, Chap. 2. verse
42. Iunius translateth it Aschidaei, and says, they were such as for religion
were scattered and dispersed about forfeare of the King.
Their original was from the times of Ezrah, or Esdras, Haggai and Zachary,
the Prophets, being authors of this Order. These, in regard of their
institution, were called Holy, Hasidim; and in regard of their Combination,
Hasidaei. And besides that which the Law enjoined (which is just debt) they
supererogated, and of their own free accord disbursed upon the Temple and
Sacrifices. They professed not only to live according to the Prescript of the
Law, but if any thing could by interpretations and consequences be drawn
thence, they held themselves bound to satisfy it, and when they had done all,
to seem to have done nothing, but accounted themselves unprofitable servants
notwithstanding.

Every one paid a tribute to the reparations of the Temple, from the times of
Esdras and Nehemias. Neh.10.32.
The Hasidaeans added further (of their own free will) to the Sanctuary,
Walls, and Porches, never (almost) going from the Temple, which they seemed to
hold peculiar to themselves, and by which they used to swear, By this
Habitacle, or, By this House: Which the Pharisees, their posterity, also did
Mat.23.16. and 29.
, as likewise they learned of them to build the Sepulchers of the Prophets.
They were therefore called Hasidim, either because their College was
instituted of the Prophets; or of their holy and religious works, and the
sacred buildings by them either repaired or reared from the foundations. And
therefore, when wicked Alcimus had killed threescore men of this Corporation or
Guild, the people thought their death was prophesied in the Ps.79.2.
Psalm, such reputation was there of their holiness.

These Hasidaei were not in proper sense a Sect, but a Fraternity, which
every day assembled in the Temple, and offered in daily Sacrifice a Lamb,
which was called the Sinne-offering of the Hasidim. One day was excepted, the
eleventh of Tisri, in which that Sacrifice was omitted. They offered not
themselves (for they were not Priests) but the Priests in their name. Abraham
Zachuth Abr.Zachuth lib.Iohasm.
says, That Baba, the son of Bnta. daily of his own accord offered a Ram
for a Sinne-offering, except one day, which was the day after the Expiation:
And this was called the Sacrifice of the Saints for Sin: And he swear, By
this Habitacle, that is, the Temple. Of this kind, or much like thereto,
Scaliger Scal.ibid. cap.24.
thinks the Rechabites were, which Ieremia ler.35.19.
mentions, whose immediate father he accounts Ionadab, (not him which
lived 2.Reg.10.15.
in the days of Iebu, but another of that name) and that their austere order
began but a little before it ended (namely, in the same Prophets time) quickly
ending, because of the Captivity. After the Captivity, those sons of
Ionadab, renewing their former observations, were called Hasidaei, which went
not from the Temple, and observed the orders aboue-mentioned: so Scaliger
interpreted Ieremies Prophecy, that Ionadab should not want one to stand
before the LORD, that is, to minister and attend holy duties in the Temple,
like to Anna the Prophetess Luk.2.37.
. This (says he) is the true beginning of the Hasidaei, which abstained from
wine, as did also the Priests, as long as they ministered in the Temple. Thus
much Scaliger.

Drusius Drus.de 3 ser.l.1.c.11.
proves, That diverse of the Pharisees and Essees also were of these Hasidaei,
whereby it appears, that it was rather a Brotherhood, as Scaliger calls it,
then a Sect. He shows their Rites and Discipline, out of Iuchasin. or Iohasin
Ab.Zac.
They spent nine hours of the day in prayer. They believed that a man might
sin in thought, and therefore they had care thereof; their will was not
without the will of Heaven, that is, of GOD. Ten things were peculiar to
them: Not to lift up their eyes above ten cubits: secondly, Not to go
bare-headed: thirdly, To stablish three refections: fourthly, To dispose their
hearts to prayer: fifthly, Not to look on either side: sixthly, To go about,
that they might not be troublesome to any company: seventhly, Not to eat at
the Tables of great men: eighthly, If they had angered any man, quickly to
appease him: ninthly, To have a pleasant voice, and to descend to the
interpretation of the Law: tenthly, To accustom themselves to their Threads
and Phylacteries.

Rab (one of this Fraternity) did not lift up his eyes above four cubits.
Ten or twenty days before their death they were diseased with the Collicke,
and so all clear and clean they departed into the other life.

To return unto Scaliger. touching the original of Sects, and to leave those
Hasidaean obseruants. As long (says he) as Supere rogation only was used,
there was no Sect in the people of GOD: but when the Precepts thereof were
brought into Canons, and committed to writing, then arose many doubts,
disputations, altercations, growing and succeeding daily, from whence sprang
two Sects, differing in opinion; the one admitting only the Law, the other
embracing the interpretations and expositions of their Rabbines. The former, in
process of time, was divided into two. For at first the Karram were only such
as observed the Law and the Prophets, till the times of Sadok and Boethi or
Baithi, who first doubted of the punishment of sins, and rewards of good
works, from whom sprang the Haeresie of the Sadducees. The Karraim were not,
before this, divided in Sect from the Hasidim, but only in those voluntary
Functions and Supereogations, wherein the Law, by Iniunction, ruled the former,
and these, as is said, supererogated. But when Canons and Injunctions began to
be written, then of these Hasidim arose Dogmatists, which called themselves
Perushim, Holy, and Separated both from the other Hasidim, and from the Vulgar;
making a necessity of that observation, which before was voluntary. This sort
was again divided into those which retained the name Perushim, or Pharisees;
and the Essens: both receiving from their Authors the Rules and Precepts of
their Sect. After this, the Pharisees were divided into any kinds: The Jews
reckon seven. The Essens also were divided first into Cloysterers, or
Collegians, which lived in a common Society; and Eremites, or Solitraric
persons; and those former into such as married; and others which remained
continent.

Now let us consider of these more particularly; and first of the Pharisees.
Drusius Drusius de 3.Sectis, li.2.
deriueth the name from the Syrian, as most of the names in the New Testament
are, and not from the Hebrew; for then it should it not be Pharisees, but
Pharusees: as after the Hebrew, it should rather be Masias, then Messiah. The
Etimologie some fetch from Phares, which signifies Division, as Epiphanius,
and Origin, with others Ambros. in Luc. l.3. Damascen. de haeres. Suidas.
: against which, Drusius excepteth, because in Phares the last letter is
Tsaddi, here it is Schin. Others Fr. Forerius, Es.1.10. Forsic^rus lexic.
derive it from Parash, signifying to explain, because, they did all things
openly, to be seen of men: it is not likely: or Hypocrisy loves her works
should be seen, but not her humor (then should it not be hypocrisy;) she
would not be seen in her affection to be seen: and this name, in this sense,
would have been to their infamy, and not to their reputation, which they most
aimed at. A third deriuation of this name is from another signification of the
same Verb, to expound. But to expound the Law, was more proper to the Scribes;
and some of the Pharisees were not Expositors. Howbeit, the most probable
opinion is, that they were so called of Separation; because they were, or would
seem to be, separated from others: first, in cleanenesse of life; secondly, in
dignity; thirdly, in regard of the exquisiteness of those Observations,
whereto they were separated; fourthly, in their habit, wherein they were (as
our Monks) distinguished from the people; yea, they did abhor the garments
of the people.

Their opinions are gathered by Josephus Joseph.de Antiq.l.18.de bell.Iud.l.2.
, and others, out of whom Drusius. They attributed (says Josephus) all things
to Fate. Abraham Zacuth interprets their opinion thus, They believe that GOD
knows and disposes all things, and the Stars help; yet so, as free will
is left in the hand of man. And if a man by his free will chooses the good, GOD
will help him in his good way. They say, That there is no Herb in the Earth
which has not his proper Planet in Heaven.

They ascribed immortality to the Soul, holding, that judgment passed on it
under the Earth; and that if it had done evil, it was adjudged to perpetual
prisons: if well, it had easy return unto life by a transmigration (...) Thus
Christ was, after this opinion, called Elias, or one of the Prophets.
, or going into another body. So Zacuth: The good Souls take delight of their
good works; the bad descend, and ascend not. They believed that there were
both Devils and good Angels. They conceived, that he which kept the most of the
Commandments, although he transgress in some, is just before GOD: against
which opinion Burgens. Addit.1.in epist.Ia.2.10.
Burgensis thinks, that James alleged that saying in his Epistle, He that
fails in one, is guilty of all. He cites Rab. Moses for this Pharisaicall
opinion, That GOD judges according to the plurality or paucitie (to use his
own words) of merits or demerits. Like stuff have I read in S. Francis
Legend, of the balance wherein men's deeds are weighed, and the Devil lost
his prey by the weight of a Chalice, which one had given to the Saint; which
heavy metal caused the Scale wherein his good deeds were put (before too
light) to weigh heauiest. They (the auncienter Pharisees) confess the
Resurrection of the flesh. Hereof are three opinions Drus. l.2. c. 14.
: one, That all, good and bad, shall rise again; another, That the just only
shall rise; a third, That the just, and part of the wicked, shall rise.

They call their Traditions the Law given by Word, and the unwritten Law, which
they equal to the written, deriuing both from Moses, as more fully elsewhere
shall be said. These Traditions they called (...), as both Epiphanius and
Hieronynius witness: the Teachers thereof (...), or Wisemen; and when they
Lectured, they were wont to say, (...), i. The Wisemen teach Traditions. Of
these Traditions were, concerning the Sabbath, That they might journey from
their place two thousand cubits; ( Hierome Hierom. ep. ad Alg.
accounts feet, Origin Orig. (...), l.4.c.2.
Elnes) That none might carry any burden that day; but they interpreted, if
one carried on one shoulder, it was a burden; if on both, it was none; if his
shoes had nails, they were a burden, otherwise not. Concerning Fasting, the
Pharisee boasts, Luke 18. 12. I fast twice in the week: which they observed
(says Theophilact Theoph. in Luc.18.
) on the second and fifth day, Mundayes and Thursdayes. Happily out Wednesdayes
and Fridayes succeeded in this Penance, that we might not seem to be behind
them in duty, howsoever woe disagree with them in their time. And yet Mercorus
says, The Jews fasted the fourth day, Wednesday, because they held that
unlucky, in which children are taken with the Squinancie. Further, the
Pharisees eat not unwashed, (...), Mark 7. 3. Except they wash with the fist,
as Beza translateth. Scaliger Scalig.Elench. Ser.cap.7.
expounds it, not by washing one fist in the other, but composing the fingers
into such a frame, that all their ends meet on the top of the thumb, which
for want of another name is called pugm, a Fist, although it be not properly
so. In this form they hold up their hands in washing, that the water may slide
down to the elbow, and thence fall to the ground, as the Jews use to this
day. They washed Mar.7.4.
when they came from Market, because sinners and unclean persons were there,
whose touch might pollute them. They washed also Cups and Brazen Vessels and
Beds not chamber-beds to lie on ( Drusius Drus lib.2. vbi supra.
expounds) but dining-beds, which they used instead of Tables.

They would not Luc.7.3^. Es.65.5.
eat with Publicanes or Sinners, yea they accounted themselves polluted with
their touch.

Their Hypocrisy in prayer CHRIST mentions, that it was long, and open in
the streets etc. It was thrice in the day, at the third, sixth, and ninth
hour: Their words submisse and softly, as of Hannah, 1. Sam. 1. and toward
the Temple.

They tythed all, Luke 18. Matthew. 23. even the smallest matters. For Tithes
(says Aquita) are the Hedge of thy Riches. And another Proverb (learn it)
Tithe, that thou may be rich. Epiphanius Epiph.haer.16.
adds, they paid First fruits, thirtieths, and fiftieths, Sacrifices, and
Vows.

Their Phylacteries or Seruatories, Defensiues (so the word signifies) in
Hebrew Totaphoth Of these read the 15. chapter following.
, they used as Preservatives, or Remembrancers of the Law, and ware them larger
then other men. Hierome calls them Pittaciola, resembling to them herein some
simple superstitious women, wearing little Gospels, and the wood of the Cross,
and such like, of zeal not according to knowledge, strayning a Gnat, and
swallowing a Cammell. This superstition, then complained of by Hierome, yet
remains (says Scaliger Scal. Elench. c.8.
) among Christians, and Mahumetanes, which wear about them the Gospel of S.
John. CHRIST condemns not the Rite, but their ambition, for dilating, not for
wearing them, to which all the Jews were bound, and all the Jews and
Samaritans observed. They used the like ambition in their Fringes or twisted
Tassels, which the Jews call Zizis, and use them still, as after shall
appear. Their oaths were, By Jerusalem, the Temple, the Heaven, Earth, their
Head, by the Law. Fagius Fag.annot. ad Onk.ap.Dr.
observes, That the Jews, in swearing, lay their hand on the book of the
Law, at this day. Other oaths are little esteemed. Hence it seems came our
corporal Oaths on a Book. The Jews (says Capito Capit.in Hos.
) think it no oath, if one forswear by Heaven or Earth, unless he say by him
which dwells there, etc. And none is subject to that Curse, in which the Name
of GOD is not added.

That of Corban pertains to this place, mentioned Matthew. 15:5. and Mark.
7.11. which some interpret, as if a Jew should say to his parents, That he had
already dedicated all that to GOD (to whom vows are to be performed)
wherewith he might have helped them. Doctor Rainolds Rain.and Hart^ c.7.d.4.
says, That the Jews, as they were prone to ungodly vows, so this was an
usual vow amongst them, and they would bind it with an oath, That such or such
a man should have no profit by them. The oath which they herein used as most
solemn, was, By the Gift: for so they were instructed, Matthew.23.
That if any swear by the Altar, it was nothing, but if By the Gift, he was a
debtor. The Pharisees therefore taught, if any had said to his father, By the
Gift thou shall have no profit by me, then he might in no case do them any
good, against the Commandment, Honor thy Father, etc. The Jews used to bind
their vows with a Curse, as they which vowed Act.23.14.
Paul's death, using yet to suppress the Curse it self, as, Heb.3.11.
if they shall enter into my rest: So these, By the Gift, if thou have any
profit by me, meant they should have none. Thus the Talmud (says he) the book
of their Canon Law, and Schoole-Diuinitie, says, That a man is bound to honor
his father, unless he vow the contrary. Masius Mas.in Ios. ap. Dr.
explaineth it thus, That they did consecrate by saying Corban all, wherewith
they should have benefited their parents: as if they had said, Let it be
Anathema, or devoted, whatsoever it be, with which I may profit thee. And
therefore those Rabbines, under pretext of Religion, allowed not to spend on
his parents that which he had thus vowed to GOD. Scaliger Scal. Elench. c.9.
thus interprets the place, as if a son being by his parents admonished of
his duty, should put them off with this exception, unless that which I have
offered for thee, free me of this burden. But let the more curious read it in
himself.

The Pharisees were esteemed pitiful; the Sadducees more cruel. N. ^yra. in
Mat.16.
They were much addicted to Astrology, and the Mathematikes: whose names of
the Planets Epiphanius Epip. her.16.
rehearses, as also of the twelve Signs.

There were Drus. de 3. see.l.2.c.22.
seven sorts of the Pharisees, which the Talmud reckons: first, Sichemita,
which measure piety by honor and profit, as the Sichemites, which for the
marriage of Dina endured Circumcision: secondly, Nacphi, which lifted not his
feet from the ground: the third Kisai, Draw-bloud, which smites his head to
the wall, to cause the blood to come; and also shuts his eyes, that he
behold not a woman: the fourth, that stands on his perfection, called
Mahchobathi: What is my sin? as if there wanted nothing to his
righteousness: the fifth, Meduchia, which go lowly and stouping: the sixth,
the Pharisee of Love, which obeys the Law for love of virtue or reward: the
seventh, the Pharisee of Fear, which is holden in obedience by fear of
punishment. This they call Jobs Pharisee, the former Abraham's.

Epiphanius Epip. her.16.
describes their strict observations. Some (says he) prescribed to
themselves ten years, or eight or four years continence. Some lay on
plankes, which were only nine inches broad, that when they slept, they might
fall to the pauement, so to be awakened again to prayer, and keep themselves
waking. Others put stones under them for the same end, by pricking to awake
them: others lay on thorns for that purpose. Scaliger Scal.El.c.13.
reproves Epiphanius for affirming, that the Pharisees ware woman's attire, as
not agreeing to their austeritie, which despised all beds, beat themselves
against walls, and put thorns in the fringes of their garments, to prick them:
he thinks him deceived by some Jews report; and adds, that the modern
Jews have little or no knowledge of those ancient Pharisees, but as they
learn it of the Christians, or of Pseudo-Gorionides (so he calls the Hebrew
Book, ascribed to Joseph ben Gorion, whom Drusius esteems, and Scaliger
proves to be, a counterfeit.)

We may here also insert the Scal.Elench. c.10.
manner of the Jewish School or Academie, with their promotion therein to the
degree of a Doctor: which whosoever affected, was first a Disciple and being
prostrate at the feet of the Doctor, heard him teaching: for the Disciple did
read, being laid on the Floor or Pauement, and the Doctor interpreted what he
read. All the time which he learned on this manner, was called his Minority.
and the Scholar was called Katan, a Minor. Thus Paul says he Act.22.3.
was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel. All this while he was called by the
name of his father, his own name not added; which, after laying on of hands,
was annexed to his Title: as Ben Bethira before laying on of hands; after,
Rabbi Joshua Ben Bethira, etc. For by laying on of hands he was promoted to his
Mastership; which was done with a set form of words, whereof R. Judah, the
son of Baba, was Author. But although he had now received the Degree, he was
not presently entitled Master, but Chaber. as (...) with the Greeks,
Speusippus (...) Platonis, that is, such a Scholar as is able to teach. This
word Chaber therefore is not put alone, but has always his Relative adjoined,
as R. Ismael Chaber of R. Eleazar. And whiles he was so called, he never sat
whiles his Master sat, but prostrate on the pauement: And when they were both
Masters, the younger stood, while the elder sat and taught: as in the
Primitive Church the younger Bishop called the elder Papa. Such was the
reverence to their Rabbines. CHRIST at twelve years was otherwise honored
amongst them: but this was extraordinary.

The Pharisees in a self-conceit and singularity called all but themselves,
in a disgraceful scorn, Ar.Mont. in Euang.Mat.23.
Other men: so said he, Luke 18. I am not as other men: whereas they accounted
themselves masters of others, on whom also they bound heavy burdens, in
their Rules and Cases, the breach whereof they judged Sin in the people, but
yet held not themselves bound thereto. For example, Every Israelite ought
every day, by their Rule, to say over the ten Commandments, and that in
the first Watch, which might not be deferred, for danger of sin; and yet
amongst themselves they esteemed it lawful at any hour of the night. But upon
the Proselytes they imposed more then on the other Israelites, all which they
were bound to (in their censure) vnderpaine of Hellfire; and therefore CHRIST
said, They made them twofold more the children of Hell then themselves; for
they freed themselves from many of those impositions they laid on the
consciences of others. And these Proselytes they less trusted, and therefore
burdened them with more observations.

After we have spoken of the Pharisees, which loved the first rooms (which
they have here obtained) it follows to speak next of the Sadducees Sadducees.
, who in the New Testament are often mentioned. Beda in Act.5.
Beda gives an unjust interpretation of their name, saying the Sadducees are
interpreted Just. Epiphanius Epiph.her.14.
also fetches their name from Sadec, which signifies Justice. Lyra Lyra in
Act. 5.
alleges a reason, because they were severe and rigorous in judgment, they
gave this name of Just (not justly) to themselves. Burgensis Burgens.ibid.
otherwise; as of Arrius were the Arrians, so of one Sadoch (says he) are the
Sadducees called, who was the first inuentor of their Heresy. The Pharisees
were esteemed more just then they, as appears Luke 18. 9. They counted
themselves just, and despised others; Summum ius, summa iniuria. Their rigorous
justice was unjust rigor. This Drus de 3. Sec.l.3.c.3.
Sadoc, or rather Saduc, lived under Antigonus Sochaens, who succeeded to
Simeon the Just: His fellow-scholler was Baithos, of whom came the
Baithosaeans. So says Abraham ben David in his Historical Cabball: Antigonus
said, Be ye not as servants, which minister to their Prince on condition to
receive reward. Sadoc and Baithos asked him of this thing, and he answered
that they should not put confidence in the reward of this life, but in the
world to come. But they denied his words, and said, We never heard any thing
of the world to come; for they had been his disciples: and they dissented from
him, and went to the Sanctuary of Mount Garizin, where the princes were. They
vpbraided the Pharisees with their Traditions, saying; The Tradition is in the
hand of the Pharisees, to vex themselves in this world, whereas in the world
to come they have no reward. Antigonus his words are in the Treatise Aboth. Be
ye not servants which minister to a Prince, to receive of him reward: but be ye
as servants which minister to their Prince, with this condition, that they
receive no reward, and let the fear of God be upon you.

Baithos had a diverse family fro Sadoc, otherwise held the same opinions, as
Hellel and Sammai among the Pharisees; so these were two chief Masters of the
Sadducaean Schools. The Baithusaeans ministered to Baithos in vessels of
silver and gold. These Sadducees were called Minim or Minaei, that is,
Heretics. They are called Karraim, because they would seem Textuall, and
Scripture-men, disallowing Traditions, Scal.Elen. Tribaer.cap.2.
of Kara, which signifies the Scripture: which was called Kara or Cara, of
Cara to read, says Drusius, Drus. quast. lib.1.q.44.
because of the diligence, which ought to be used in reading the Scriptures,
whereunto men should design (after the Jewish precepts) the third part of
their life. Abraham Zachuth calls them Epicures. The Scriptures they
interpreted after their own sense, nor regarded they the words of the Wise
men; that is, the Pharisees. They were of the ancient Caraeans, or Karraim, but
not of those which now are so termed; which as Zachuth confesses, confess the
Resurrection, and Reward. Scaliger Scal. quosup.
affirms, by the testimony of Philip Frederike a Christian Jew, who had
great familiarity with these Karraim at Constantinople, and had been often
present at their Synagogue, that they differ nothing from the other Jews, but
in rejecting Traditions, and are far more honest and faithful then the
Rabbanim, of whom they are no less hated for their integrity, then for
rejecting Tradition.

Concerning the Karraim now remaining, it is reported that the other Jews, and
they, will not speak one to another: so inexpiable hatred do the other Jews
conceive against them. And Postellus says, G. Postel. Alphab.12. ling. ap. Dr.
There are three principal Sects of the Jews in the Eastern parts;
Thalmudists; Caraim, which reject those Glosses. They are rich, but so hated of
the rest, that a great part of their virgins remain unmarried: And if (says
the common Jew) it should so happen that a Caraim and a Christian should fall
together into the water, with like possibility of saving either, he would make
a bridge of the Caraim to save the Christian. The third sort is the Samaritan,
of which afterward. Buxdorf. Buxdorf.Synagog.Iud.cap.2.
says, that there are of these Caraim also in Poland; and Leo Leo.Africa.
mentions some places in Barbary, where this sort of Jews does inhabit; as you
may hereafter read in our sixth Book, and the eleventh Chapter.

First, their difference from the Pharisees was about the future reward, which
being denied, they by consequence of that error fell into the rest, to deny the
Resurrection: the subsistence spiritual, etc. They couped up GOD in Heaven,
without all beholding of evil. They denied Fate, which the Pharisees held.
They denied Spirit altogether, says Lira, Lyra in Act.23.
for they held GOD to be corporeal: the soul to die with the body: Angels
and Devils they denied: Good and evil they ascribed to a man's free will Joseph
de Bell. Iud.lib.2.7.
. They were inhospitall and cruel: and as cruelly, hated of the people. They
are charged (the Devil may be slandered) to deny all Scripture but Moses Read
this Argument handled by Scaliger. Elenc. cap.16.
: But first in Scripture, this opinion of theirs is not mentioned: and Josephus
affirms, that they received the Scriptures, and rejected Tradition. Neither
would the Zealous people of the Jews, have endured them in the Temple, if they
had denied their Prophets, for fear of whom, they durst not profess otherwise
of John Baptist, although he had left no monument of miracle, or Scripture.
Drusius Drus. de 3. ^^ct.li.3.cap.10.
would reconcile this opinion of the Fathers, which say they denied all but
Moses; and the other, saying, that some of the Sadducees lived in Iudaea,
others in Samaria. These later happily, with the Samaritans, denied all save
Moses. Amongst these were the Apostata's, which lived in Sichem, mentioned by
Josephus Antiq. lib. 11. cap. 8. and Ecclesiasticus 50. 27. Iunius thinks
that they fell from the Jewish religion with Manasses, in the time of Nehemias.

The Sect of the Sadducees was diminished, if not worn out, after the
destruction of the Temple, till in the year 4523. or after Scalig. 4515. and A
D. 755. one Anan and Saul his son renewed that Doctrine, because he had not
received his expected promotion to the degree of Gaon Gaon was a degree, as a
Doctor with us, created by imposition of hands, 8 c.
. He wrote books against the other Jews. The like did one Carcasuas But of
these Sadducees too much.

word which signifies Rest, or quietness and silence: both which well agreed to
their institution. He disproueth that opinion of Eusebius, and others, that
therein followed him, which thought these Jewish Heretics were Christian Monks
and Catholics. Such Catholics, let Baronius Baron. Annal. tom.I.
and Bellarmine ^ l de Mon. lib.2. cap.5.
boast of, as the authors of their Monks, for so they would have them; which
you may believe as well as before the Flood, Enosh; and after, Elias, John
Baptist, the Nazarites and Rechabites, were Monkish Votaries, as the Cardinal
would have you. As for these Essees, he makes no small ado against the
Centuries, Cent. I. lib.2. cap.3.
for understanding Philo of Jewish, and not of Christian Monks. But the love
to Monkery has dazeled the eyes of men too much: and even their history
(which follows) will convince that opinion of falsehood. Besides,
Christianity should have small credit of such associates. Indeed the later
Monks are much like them in superstition and Idolatry, though far behind in
other things. But he that will see this Argument disputed, let him read
Scaliger his Confutation of Serarius the Jesuit. He shows also that the
Ossens, Sampsaeans, Messalians, and diverse heresies amongst the Christians,
sprang from these Essees: that the Egyptian Essees, of which Philo speaks,
out of whom Eusebius first collected that conceit, and that Philo himself had
no skill in the Hebrew, but knew only the Greek tongue: that Paulus the
Eremite in Thebais, was the first Author of Monastical living. But now to come
to our history of these men.

These Essees, Hessees, or Essens, are placed by Pliny on the West of the
Dead-sea Plin.l.5.c.17.
, a people solitary, and in the whole world most admirable, without women,
without money, and a nation eternal in which none is borne, the weariness of
others fortunes being the cause of their fruitful multiplying. Philo in that
Book which he entitled, that all good men are free, says that there were of
them above sour thousand, called Essaei, quasi (...), that is, Holy, not
sacrificing other creatures, but their minds, unto GOD. Some of them are
Husbandmen, some Artificers, for necessity, not for abundance: They make no
weapons of war, nor meddle with Merchandise. They have no servants, but are
all both free, and mutually servants to each other. They live perpetually
chaste, swear not at all, nor lie: esteeming GOD the Giver of all good, and
Author of no evil: Their society is such, that one garment, one house, one
food, one treasury, one getting, one spending, one life, is in common to them
all; carefully providing for their sick, and holding the elder men in place of
parents.

Josephus, who himself lived among them, does more largely describe them.
Joseph.de bell. Iud.lib.2. cap.7.
He reports that they were by Nation Jews, avoiding pleasures and riches as
Sins; accounting continence and contentednes great virtues. They marry not,
but instruct the children of others, respecting them as their kindred, in their
manners: not denying the lawfulness of marriage, but the honesty of women.
He which becomes one of their fraternity, must make his goods common. Oil
and neatness they shun, yet wear always a white garment. They have
Officers for their common provision. They have no one certain City, but in
each, many of them have their houses: to strangers of their own Sect, they
communicate their goods, and acquaintance; and therefore carry nothing with
them in their iorneyes, but weapons for fear of thieves: and in every City
have of the same College an especial Officer which provides for strangers.
The children under tuition of Masters are alike provided for; nor do they
change their raiment till the old be worn: They neither buy nor sell, but
mutually communicate. Devout they are in the service of GOD. For before the
Sun rises, they speak of no profane or wordly matter, but celebrate
certain Prayers, as The Essees were worshippers of the Sun: hence came the
(...) and Sampsai.
praying him to rise. Then by their Officers are each appointed to their
works, till the fifth hour, at which time they assemble together, and, being
girded with linen garments, wash themselves in cold water. Then do they go
into their dining room, as into a Temple, where no man of another Sect may be
admitted; and there staying with silence, the Pantler sets them bread in order,
and the Cook one vessel of broth. The Priest gives thanks, as after dinner
also. Then laying aside those their holy garments, they plie their work till
the evening; and then suppe in like manner. There is never crying or tumult,
they speak in order, and observe even without the house a venerable silence.
In other things they are subject to their Ouersoer, but at their own choice
may help and show mercy to others. To their kindred they cannot give without
license. What they say, is certain: but an oath they hate no less the^
perjury. They study the writings of the Ancient, thence collecting such things
as may benefit the manners of the mind, or health of the body. They which are
studious of their Sect, must a years space endure trial, and then after that
probation of their continency, must be probationers yet two years longer, and
then upon allowance of their manners are assumed into their fellowship; making
first deep proteestation of religion toward God, and justice toward men, to
keep faith to all, but especially to Princes, and if they shall come to rule
over others, not to abuse their power, not to exceed others in habit, not to
steal, not to keep any thing secret from them of their own Sect, or
communicate it to another, although upon peril of life: not to devise new
doctrines: to keep the books of their own opinions, and the names of the
Angels. Offenders they put from their fellowship: and he which is thus
excommunicate, may not receive food offered of any other, but, eating grass
and herbs, is consumed with famine, except they in compassion receive him
again, in extremity. They give no sentence of judgment, being fewer then an
hundred. If ten sit together, one speaks not without consent of the rest. They
may not spit in the midst, or on the right hand. They will not so much as
purge Nature on the Sabbath They go not to stool on the Sabbath, because of
that instrument which they could not use to dig and cover their excrement,
without Sabbathbreaking. Scaliger.
, and on other days do it very closely, for offending the Divine light, and
cover it with an instrument in the earth, and that in the most secret places;
and are washed after.

They are of four ranks, according to the time of their profession; and the
younger sott of these are so far inferior to the rest, that if one of these do
touch them, he washes himself, as if he had touched a stranger. They live
long: fear not death: nor by any tortures of the Romans, could be compelled to
transgress their laws; but derided their tormentors rather: believing to
receive their souls again presently, holding the bodies to be corruptible,
and the prisons of the immortal souls: which if they have been good, have a
pleasant place assigned them beyond the Ocean, but the evil to be in
tempestuous stormy places of punishments. Some of these Essens also forertell
things to come. And another sort is of the^ which allow of marriage, but make a
threeyeares trial first of the women, and if by a constant purgation they
appear fit for childbearing, they wed them, not for pleasure, but
procreation: and therefore after conception do not accompany with them. These
women when they wash, have their sacred linen garments also, as the men. Thus
far Josephus: who in his Ios.Antiq lib.18.cap.2.
Antiq adds to these, their opinions of GODS providence ruling all things:
and that they think their Ceremonies more holy then those of the Temple, and
therefore send thither their gifts, but do not there sacrifice, but by
themselves following the same course of life, which the Plisti Scaliger reads
not Plisti, but Pol^stae; called also Ctis^ae, Scythian Nemades.
do amongst the Dacians.

Some of these Essenes lived solitary, like to Hermits, as is said before.
Happily that Banus was of this sort, to whom Josephus In vita Joseph.
resorted for imitation. He lived in the wilderness, clothing and feeding
himself with such things as the trees and plants of their own accord yielded
him, and with often cold washings in the night and day, cooling the heat of
lust. With him Josephus abode three years.

The Gaulonites or Galilaeans, Galilaeans.
had their Joseph. de Antiq. lib. 18.cap. 1. de Bello Iud.lib. 2. cap.7.
beginning of Judas (elsewhere he calls him Simon) a Galilaean, whose
doctrine was, That, Only GOD was to be accounted their LORD and Prince: in
other things they agreed with the Pharisees: but for their liberty they would
rather endure any the most exquisite tortures, together with their kindred and
friends, then call any mortal man their LORD. Thoudas happily, mentioned, Act.
5. and that Egyptian, Act. 21. were of this rebellious and traitorous Sect, and
those Sicarij which wore short weapons under their garments, therewith
murdering men in assemblies. That Egyptian Joseph. de Bell.lib.2.cap.21.
Josephus calls a false Prophet, who under pretense of Religion, and name of a
Prophet, assembled almost thirty thousand men to Mount Oliuet: he was defeated
by Foelix the Governor. Such were their Zelotae in the siege of Jerusalem,
under the mantle of Religion, all of them harboring and cloking Treason and
villainy.

The Scribes Scribes.
are not a Sect, but a function: of which were two sorts, (...) and, (...), the
one expounders of the Law, the other public Notaries or Actuaries, Recorders,
Secretaries. Epiphanius makes difference betwixt the Scribes that were (...),
Teachers of the Law, and the (...), or Lawyers, which prescribed forms of Law,
Law-cases, and taught Civil actions. But these are often taken one for the
other. Ezra is called a Scribe, whose Pulpit is mentioned, Nehem. 8. and Moses
D. Rainolds and Ha^t.
Chair was the seat of the Scribes; that is, they taught the Law of Moses,
which they used to do sitting: as CHRIST also did, Mat. 5. 2. Their
expositions, Epiphanius Epiph. Haer.15.
says were of four sorts, one in the name of Moses; the second in the name of
their Rabbine Akiba (he is said to have lived an hundred and twenty years,
and to be Standard Bearer to Barchozba) the third in Andan or Annan; the fourth
after the Assamonaei. But little is to be said of these Scribes, more then what
is before said of the Pharisees, this being not a differing Sect, but an Office
or Ministry, whereof the Pharisees also were capable, and are for false
teaching blamed by our SAVIOVR, together with the Scribes.

The Scribes are said in their expositions D. Hall, Pharis. and Christian.
to have been more textuall, the Pharisees more in their Glosses and
Traditions: the Scribes had chief reputation for learning, the Pharisees for
holiness, taking more pains (says our English Josephus) to go to hell. The
Scribes professed both disputation and observation of many things, says Arias
Montanus Ar. Mont. in Euang. Mat. 15.
, but not so exact as the Pharisees. For the Pharisees, though not so learned
as the other, thought themselves more holy then them, because they observed not
only those things, which in the common opinion were thought meet, but those
things which were least, which the people observed not, which others had added.
This they were ambitious of, as of some great perfection. For there was a
threefold state of men, The Doctors, Pharisees, and People of the Land. The
proverb was The people of the Land are the footstool of the Pharisees. The
people were tied to observe the precepts mentioned, or by necessity of
consequence drawn out of the Bible. The Pharisees (as is said) added their
Traditions. The Scribes manner Ar. Mont.in Marc.1.22.
of teaching was cold and weak, consisting in certain arguments, which rather
afflicted, then affected the minds of the hearers; in certain niceties, and
scrupulous questions, sometimes inextricable. And therefore the people heard
Christ, as speaking with authority, and not as the Scribes. But to let pass
these School-me^, and those Canonists let us come to their other sects and sort
of professio^s.

The Hemerobaptists Hemerobaptists.
are nu^bred by Epiphanius Epiph.her.17.
among the Jewish heresies, which, says he, in other things differ not from
the Scribes and Pharisees; but in their doctrine of the resurrection and in
infidelity are like to the Sadducees: And every day in all times of the year
they are baptized or washed, whence they have their name. But this custom of
daily washing, says Scaliger, Scal. Elench.cap. 31.
was common to all the ancient Jews, which would seem better the^ their
fellows, and not only observed of the Pharisees, Essees, and Hemerobaptists
(if such a sect may be added). At this time in Palestina many do it, not once,
but often in the day. The Mahumetans observe it. The Priests when they kept
their courses in the Temple, abstained from wine, and eat not of the Tithes
before they had washed their whole body. The Pharisees and Essees composed
themselves to this sanctity: the greater part of the Pharisees, and all the
Essees abstained from wine, and both used daily washings, especially before
they ate. And as many heretics professing themselves Christians, retained many
things of Iudaisme; so these Hemerobaptists learned them this daily washing. It
seems by him, that, these were Christian rather the^ Jewish heretics.

And so were the Nazaraeans Nazaraeans.
also, which some reckon among the Jewish sects, who embraced the Gospel of
CHRIST, but would not relinquish their Iudaisme; unless we say with Hierome,
that whiles they would be both Jews and Christians, they were neither Jews
nor Christians. These Nazaraeans, or Nazoraeans, Scaliger affirms, were mere
Karraim, Scripture-Iewes, but because of their obstinacy in the Law, the first
Council of the Apostles determined against them. As for the Nazarites of the
old Testament, Moses describes them and their observations: Not to cut their
hair, not to drink wine and strong drink, etc. Such was Sampson. But these
could be no Sect, holding in every thing the same doctrine with the Jews, and
only, for a time, were bound by vow to these rites. But for those Nazaraeans,
Epiphanius Ep ph her.18.
makes them a Jewish Sect, not without cause, if such were their opinions, as
he describes them. Their dwelling was beyond Jordan in Gilead and Bashan, as
the fame goes (says he) by Nation Jews: and by observing many things like to
the Jews. Herein they differed: They did not eat any thing which had life:
they offered not sacrifice: for they counted it unlawful to sacrifice, or to
eat flesh. They disallowed the five Books of Moses: they indeed confessed
Moses, and the Fathers by him mentioned, and that he had received the law, not
this yet, which is written, but another.

Next to these does Haeres. 19
Epiphanius place the Ossens Ossens.
, dwelling in Ituraea, Moab, and beyond the Salt or Dead sea: to these one
Elxai in the time of Traian joined himself: he had a brother named Iexai.
Scaliger (here and every where acute) says Scal.Elenc.cap.27.
that the Essens and Ossens are the same name, as being written with the
self-same Hebrew letters, differing only in pronuntiation, as the Abyssines
pronounce Osrael, Chrostos. for Israel. Christus. And the Arabian Elxai, and
his brother Iexai, were not proper names, but the appellation of the Sect it
self; as he proves. But they agreed not so well in profession, as in name,
with the Essens, for they were but an issue of those ancient Essens, holding
some things of theirs, others of their own: as concerning the worship of
Angels, reproved by the Apostle, Col. 2. 21. in which the Essens and Ossens
agreed, and other things there mentioned, Touch not, taste not, handle not: and
in worshipping of the Sun, whereof they were called Sampsaeans, or Sunners,
Sun-men, as Epiphanius interprets that name. Those things wherein they
differed, were brought in by that Innouator, who (of this his Sect) was called
Elxai.

He was, says Epiphanius, a Jew, he ordained, Salt, and Water and Earth, and
Bread, and Heaven, and the Sky and the Wind, to be sworn by in Divine
worship. And sometime he prescribed other seven witnesses; Heaven, and Water,
and Spirits, and the holy Angels of prayer, and Oil, and Salt, and Earth. He
hated continency, and enjoined marriage of necessity. Many imaginations he
has, as received by revelation. He teaches hypocrisy, as in time of
persecution to worship Idols; so as they keep their conscience free: and if
they confess any thing with their mouth, but not in their heart. Thus ancient
is that Changeling, Aequiuocation. He brings his author, one Phineas of the
stock of the ancienter Phineas, the son of Eleazar, who had worshipped Diana
in Babylon, to save his life. His followers esteem him a secret virtue or
power. Until the time of Constantime, Marthus and Marthana (two women of his
stock) remained in succession of his honor, and were worshipped in that country
for gods, because they were of his seed. Marthus died a while since, but
Marthana still lives: Their spittle, and other excrements of their body, those
Heretics esteemed, and reserved for relics to the cure of diseases, which
yet prevailed nothing. He mentions CHRIST, but it is uncertain whether he
means our LORD JESUS. He forbids praying to the Eastward, and bids turn
toward Jerusalem from al parts. He detesteth sacrifices, as never offered by
the Fathers: he denies the eating of flesh among the Jews, and the Altar, and
Fire, as contrary to GOD, but water is fitting. He describes CHRIST after his
measure, four and twenty Schaeni in length, that is fourscore and sixteen
miles, and the fourth part thereof in breadth, to wit, six Schaeni, or four
and twenty miles; besides the thicknes, and other fables. He acknowledges a
HOLY GHOST, but of the female sex, like to CHRIST, standing like a statue
above the clouds, and in the midst of two mountains. He bids none should seek,
the interpretation, but only say those things in prayer: (words which he had
taken out of the Hebrew tongue, as in part we have found). His prayer is this,
Scaliger thinks they are three sentences, and not a prayer.
Abar, anid moib nochile daasim an daasim nochile moib anid abar selam. Thus
Epiphanius relates it, and thus construeth, I cannot say expounds (although
they, like our devout Catholics, needed no exposition) Let the humility pass
from my fathers, of their condemnation, and conculcation, and labor; the
conculcation in condemnation by my fathers, from the humility passed in the
Apostleship of perfection. Thus was Elxai with his followers opinionate:
otherwise Jewish. Epiphanius speaks of his sect elsewhere often, as when he
mentions the Ebionites Epiph her. 53.
, and the Sampsaeans: This book both the Ossees and Nazoraeans, and Ebionltes
used.

The Sampsaeans Sampsaeans.
had another book (they said) of his brothers. They acknowledge one GOD, and
worship him, using certain washings. Some of them abstain from living
creatures, and they will die for Elxai his posterity; which they had in such
honor, that if they went abroad, the people would gather up the dust of their
feet for cures, and their spittle, and used the^ for amulets and preservatives.
They admit neither the Apostles, nor Prophets: they worship Water, esteeming it
as a god, believing that life is from thence.

Scaliger also affirms, that the Massalians Massalians.
(which word Epiphanius interprets (...) Such as pray, according to the
opinion and practice of those Heretics) were Scal.ele. c.28.
first a Jewish sect, and a slip of the Essees, and after by marriages with
some false Christians, made such a galli-maufrey, as after when we come to
speak of the Pseudochristia^ sects shall (GOD willing) be related: for of
Jewish they became Christian Heretics.

The Herodians Herodians.
were Jews, Epiph.haer.20.
otherwise agreeing with the rest; but they thought Herod to be the Messiah,
moved by Jacobs prophecy falsely interpreted, That the Scepter should not
depart from Judah till Shilo came. When as therefore they saw Herod a stranger
to possess the kingdom, they interpreted as aforesaid. Some make question
whether this was the name of a sect, or of Herod's soldiers. Drusius D^us.de 3.
see.lib.1.cap.3.
observes out of a Commenter upon Persius, Sat. 5. Herodis venere dies, etc.
these words, Herod reigned among the Jews in the parts of Syria, in the days
of Augustus. The Herodians therefore observe the birthday of Herod, as also the
Sabbaths: in the which day they set lamps burning, and crowned with violets in
the windows. Arias Montanus Ar.Mont in Fuang.Malth.22.16.
thinks that the Herodians were politicians, that little respected religion.
They thought the Commonwealth should be established, and that could not stand
without Princes, nor could Princes nourish themselves or theirs without money,
and therefore propounded that question to our Savior touching Caesar's tribute.
Others think they made hotchpotch of Iudaisme and Gentilisme, as Herod had
done: in which it is like his succesiors succeeded him. This conjecture is
mentioned by Beza, Beza Annot. in Mat.22.
who yet rather thinks that the Herodians were Herod's courtiers, moved
thereto by the Syrian translation, which has debeth Hiraudis, Herod's
domesticals. Thus thinks Iunius I^n. in Annot. Syc. Tran.
of them also, who says that when the Pharisees could not entrap him in the
Law, they sent their disciples to question him of Tribute, having before agreed
(which usually they did not) with the Herodians to stand by (unknown) as
witnesses, if he had answered any thing, whereat Caesar might have been
offended. And this seems most likely: for after Herod's death, how could they
hold him for Messiah?

Another sect amongst these of the Circumcision, Eusebius Eusebius.hist. Eccles
l.4. c. 21.
out of Hegesippus names the Masbothoaei Masbothaei.
or Masbotheani; for Thebulis (says Hegesippus) was of their number, which
arose out of seven sects in the Jewish people: Which sects had their beginning
Simon, of whom the Symonians: and Cleobius, of whom the Cleobians; Dositheus,
of whom the Dositheans; and Gortheus, of whom the Gortheans; and Masbotheus, of
whom the Masbotheans. And from the same fountains issued the Menandrians,
Marcionists, Carpocratians, Valentinians, Basilidians, and Saturnilians. And a
little after, There were diverse sects amongst the Israelites; Essees,
Galileans, Hemerobaptists, Masbotheans; Samaritans, Sadducees, Pharisees.

The word Masbothaet, Scaliger Scalig. Elenc. cap.3.
says, signifies Sabbatists, or Sabbatarians, because they professed to have
learned the observation of the Sabbath from CHRIST, and therein differed from
the other Jews.

He there names (and little else have we but their names, even the name also
of the wicked shall rot) diverse other sects; if they may bear that name: as
the Genites Genites.
or Genists; which stood upon their stock and kindred: the Merissaeans
Merissaeans.
or Merists, which were (as the name imports) sprinklers of their holy water:
the Hellenians Hellenians.
, of Hellenius: the Cleobians Cleobians.
and Theobulians Theobulians.
we can but mention. Of the Tubiens Tubiens.
as little, save that they are said to be a College or fellowship: and less
of Ganaei.
Ganaei, and such like, if there be any other names that remain as the rotten
bones of the consumed carcasses of heresies and heretics: and either are
unknown, or degenerated into some or other sect of pseudo-christians, which
require another task.

The Coelicolae Coelicolae.
were Jews, Scal elench. triber. Serar. c.31.
but corruptly embracing, Christianity, for they were Massalians, which had
their houses or places of prayer abroad in the open air, of whom Iunenal is
understood, Nil praeter nubes and coeli lumen adorant. So Scaliger reads, not
numen: and Petronius, Iudaeus licet and porcinum nomen adoret, Et coeli summas
aduocet auriculas. These also were an oft-spring of the Essees: and from these
proceeded the Massalians. They being baptized, revolted to their former
Iudaisme, and bearing the name of Christians, retained the rites of those
Coelicolae, or Heauen-worshippers.

The Cannaei.
Cannoei were a devout Society and order, given to holiness of life, and
observation of the Law: of whom was Simon Kannaeus, Mat. 10. called Zelotes,
the interpretation of the former as Beza. Annot. in Mat.10.
Beza, Scal. El.c.1.
and Scaliger show. Suidas calls them obseruants of the Law, whom Ananus
shut in the Temple. Their (...) or Mourners Mourners.
were such as lamented with continual fasting, praying, and weeping, the
destruction of their City, See.cap.10.
Temple and Nation: as elsewhere is said.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Samaritans.

IT remains to speak of the Samaritane Sects.

Samaria was the City royal of the ten Tribes, after that Omri (who, as other
his predecessors, had reigned before at Tirzah) had bought the mountain
Shomron 1.Reg.16.24.
of one Shemer, for two Talents of silver, and built thereon this City, which
he called after the name of Shemor, Lord of the Mountain. In vain therefore
is it to seek the name of the Samaritans from the signification of the
Epiph.haer.9. chytr.Onomast.
word (which is keeping) seeing they were so called of the place, and the place
of this their ancient Lord. It remained the chief seat of the kingdom as
long as the same endured, and namely till the days of Hosheae their last King,
in whose time 2.Reg.17.
Salmanasar the Assyrian carried the Israelites thence. Esarhaddon the son of
Senacherib, otherwise called Osnappar (thus says Hezra: Ezr.4.2.10.
and therefore Epiphanius was deceived in ascribing this act to Nabuchodonosor
in the time of the captivity forty years before the return) sent to
inhabit that region, Colonies from Babel, and from Cuthan, and from Aua, and
from Hannah, and from Sepharuaim. Babel is known: Cutha and Aua Tremel.annot.
in Reg. 2.17. Josephus thinks Cutha to be Persian.
are esteemed parts of the desert of Arabia, the other of Syria and
Mesopotamia. It seems that most of them were of Cutha, because all of them
after passed into that name, and were of the Jews called Cuthaei, as
witnesses Josephus. Joseph.Antiq. l.9.14. and l.11.4


These heathens served not the LORD, and therefore the LORD sent Lions among
them which slew them: Wherefore they sent to the King of Assyria, who sent
thither one of the captiued Priests of Israel to teach them how to worship GOD
( Epiohanius, calls his name Esdras. The Hebrews call him Dosthai, as Drusius
cites. Senacherib sent to Samaria R. Dosthai, the son of Iannai to teach them
the Law. Drus.l.3. de sec.c.4. Tertullion calls him Dositheus and so does
Hierom, fathering the Samaritan sect on him.
) He dwelt at Bethel: and as some conceive, taught rather that idolatrous
worship, whereof Bethel had before been the Beth-auen, where Jeroboam had
placed his golden Calfe, then the true worship of the True Iehonah. Howsoever,
every Nation (says the Text) made them Gods, and put them in the houses of the
high places, which the Samaritans had made. The men of Babel made Succoth
Benoth: and the men of Cutha made Nergal, and the men of Hamath, Ashima: and
the Avims, Nibhaz, and Tartak: and the Sepharusaims burnt their children in the
fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech their gods. Thus they feared the LORD, and
served their gods after the manner of the Nations, and so continued: a mungrell
religion begotten of a bastard or haereticall Iudaisme, and wild paganism.
What those gods were, it is uncertain, and interpreters agree not. Of Succoth
Benoth is spoken L.1 c.13.
already: Wolphius interprets Wolph. in 2. Reg.17.
Nergal a wild hen, Ashima a goat, Nibhaz a Dog, Tartak an Ass, Adramelech
a Mule, Anaemelech a Horse: thus (says he) the Hebrews expound them: and he
supposes these creatures were among them Canonized and sacred: as the
Persians are said to worship a Cock; the Proembari of Africa, a Dog: other
people, other creatures. Thus their Religion continued till after the return
of the Jews from captivity, to whom they would have been officious helpers
in building of the Temple: which being refused they became their enemies, and
hindered the building a long time. Ezra.4.
But the Temple being built, and religion established among the Jews, and
their state flourishing, Sanballat gave Ios.Antiq.11.7.
his daughter Nicaso to Manasses, the brother of Iaddus the High Priest, in the
time of Darius the last Persian Monarch. This Nehemia mentions, but deigneth
not to name him, affirming that he chased him from him, of which some Wolph. in
Nehem.
descant whether it were by exile, or excommunication, or some other
punishment. R. Salomo interprets it of exile, Pelican of excommunication.

Drusius Drus.de 3.sec. l.3.c.2.
has a discourse out of a Jewish Author, which relates the form of that
first Anathema and judicial curse, (not unmeet here to be mentioned)
denounced against the Samaritans for hindering the work of the Temple.
Zorobabel and Ioshna (says he) gathered all the Congregation into the Temple
of the LORD, and brought three hundred Priests, and three hundred Trumpets, and
three hundred books of the law, and as many children, and sounded. And the
Levites singing and playing on instruments cursed with all kinds of Anathema's
the Chutheans, in the secret of the name Tetragrammaton, and in Writing written
upon tables: and with the Anathema of the house of the higher judgment, and
the Anathema of the house of the lower judgment, that none of Israel should
eat the bread of the Chuthean (whereupon it is said he which eats a
Samaritans bread, be as he that eats swines flesh) and that a Chuthean should
not be a Proselyte in Israel, nor should have part in the Resurrection of the
dead. This they writ, and sealed, and sent unto all Israel which were in
Babylonia, which heaped upon them Anathema upon Anathema. That, concerning
their becoming proselytes, Drusius doubts whether it may not be translated,
that a stranger Chuthaean should not abide in Israel: which is more likely. The
other had been more impious: their zeal to make proselytes of all Nations is
known.

To return to Manasses, Josephus says that the high Priest and the Elders put
him from the Altar, who therefore went to Sanballat his father in law, and
told him that he loved his daughter well, but would not for her loose his
Priesthood. Sanballat replied, that if he would retain his daughter, he would
not only maintain him in his Priesthood, but procure him a high Priests
place, and make him Prince of all his province: and would build a Temple like
to that of Jerusalem in mount Garizin, which looks over Samaria, higher then
the other hills, and that with the consent of K. Darius. Hereupon Manasses abode
with him, and many Priests and Israelites being entangled with like marriages
revolted to him, and were maintained by Sanballat. But now Alexander prevailing
against Darius, Sanballat (whose Religion was Policy) rebelled, and took part
with Alexander, and in reward thereof obtained leave to build his Temple,
whereof Manasses enjoyed to him and his successors the pontifical dignity.
Then was the Circumcision divided, some (as said the Samaritan woman) ^ub.4.20.
worshipping in this mountain, others at Jerusalem. The Zeal which the
Samaritans had to their Temple appeared Ios Antiq.l.13.c.6.
in the time of Ptolomens Philometor, when at Alexandria Sabbaeus and
Theodosius, with their Samaritans, contended with Andronicus and the Jews,
these challenging to Jerusalem, those to Garizin, the lawful honor of a
Temple, both parties swearing by GOD and the King, to bring proof of their
assertion out of the law; and beseeching the King to do him to death that
should not make his part good: and thereupon the Samaritans failing in proof,
were adjudged to punishment.

The Samaritans in the prosperity of the Jews professed themselves their
kinsmen and allies: in adversity disclaimed them, and their GOD also, as
appears Antiq.l.12.c.7.
in their Epistle to Antiochus that figure of Antichrist and persecutor of the
Jewish religion, in which they call themselves Sidonians dwelling in Sichem,
and say, that moved by ancient superstition they had embraced the Feast of the
Sabbath, and building a Temple of a namelesse Deity had offered therein solemn
sacrifices: whereas therefore their original was Sidonian and not Jewish;
pleased him to enact that their Temple might bear name of Jupiter Graecanicus,
and they might live after the Greekish rites. These things Antiochus easily
granted.

Hircanus by force tooks both Sichem and Garizin. Two hundred years after the
foundation of this Temple, as testifies Josephus, Ant.l.13 c.17.
happened this desolation thereof. The zeal yet continued as appears by many
testimonies of Scripture. The Jews meddled not with the Samaritanes, which made
the Io.4.9.
woman wonder that CHRIST asked drink of a Samaritane. Another time the
Samaritans would not receive him because his Luk 9.52
behavior was as though he would go to Jerusalem, for which fact of theirs
the sons of thunder would have brought lightning from heaven upon them. And the
Jewish despite could not object worse in their most venomous slander, then,
Job.8.42.
Thou art a Samaritane. This Ierusalem-iourney through the Samaritans country
caused bloody wars and slaughter betwixt the Galileans Ios.Antiq.l.20.5.
and them, in the time of Cumanus, to the destruction of many. And before that
in the days of Pilat, a cousning Prophet abused their zeal, bidding them to
assemble in mount Garizin Antiq.l.18.c.^.
with promise there to show them the sacred vessels, which, said he, Moses had
there hidden. Whereupon they seditiously assembling, and besiedging T^rabatha,
Pilat came upon them with his forces, and cut them in pieces.

Their opinions (besides those aforesaid) were, Epiphan. har. 9.
that only the five books of Moses were Canonical Scripture, the rest they
received not. They acknowledge not the Resurrection, nor the Trinity: and in
zeal of one GOD, abandon all idolatries, which it seems was received of them
after the building of the Temple, and mixture with the Apostata Jews; the
Scripture testifying otherwise of their former devotions. They wash themselves
with Urine, when they come from any stranger, being (for sooth) polluted. And
if they have touched one of another Nation, they diue themselves, garments and
all, in water. Such a profanation is the touch of one of another faith. They
have a dead corpse in abomination presently.

The Samaritan Dr^s.de3.sect.l.2.
if he meets a Jew, Christian, or Mahumetan, he says unto them, Touch me
not. Scaliger, out of the Arabian Geographer, scal.de Em. T^m.l.7.
tells of an Island still inhabited with these Samaritans, in the red Sea,
which appears by their custom, when any comes on shore, forbidding to touch
them. This arrogant superstition remains with them.

The Samaritan Chronicle is cited by Eusebius Chron. graec. l., 1.
Scal.Annot.in Eus. Chron and in Isag.Can.
Scaliger says he had a copy of their Chronicle translated out of Hebrew into
Arabian: it differs somewhat from the Hebrew account. The Jews confound the
Samaritans and Sadduces, as if they were but one Sect. The difference has
appeared, for the Sadduces accept all the Bible; the Samaritans, Moses only.
The Sadduces denied the souls immortality and reward. The Samaritans in their
Chronicle acknowledge both a place of reward, and punishment after this life.
But whether they believe the Resurrection or no, he doubts. The Sadduces deny
spirits, Angels, Devils; the Samaritans confess them. The Samaritans also use
still those ancient Letters called Phenician, which the Hebrews used before
the captivity, which who so lisleth to view, let him see their Characters, and
Scaligers large notes thereon in his Annotations upon Eusebius Chronicle.

The Samaritans were divided also into diverse sects, as Epiphan. Epiph.hare.13
rehearses: one whereof were called Dositbeans.
Dositheans: if it be lawful to reckon them Samaritans, which acknowledged (as
Epiphan. acknowledges of them) the Resurrection of the Dead. They abstain
from such things as have life: some of them from Marriage after they have been
before married, and some continue in Virginity. They observe Circumcision and
the Sabbath: and they touch no man, but hold every man in abomination. Report
goes also of their fasting and exercises.

They had name of Dosithens: who being a Jew, and having well profited in their
law, but not receiving promotion suitable to his ambition, revolted to the
Samaritans, and hatched this sect amongst them. And when afterward in a
singularity he had gone aside into a Cave, and there mewed up himself, and
persisted in hypocrisy and fasting, he there died (as the fame goes) through
his wilful want of bread and water. After a few days, some resorting to him
found his dead body crawling with worms, and compassed with flies. Of this
name Dositheus there were diverse. Drus.de 3.sec.l.3.6.
Two of them lived after the coming of CHRIST. One a lew, son of R. Iannai,
the other a Samaritan which endeavored to persuade his countrymen that he was
the CHRIST which Moses had prophesied of, as Orig.cont.Cells.l 2.
Origin reports, and says: of him are the Dositheans named. Another is
mentioned in Iohasin.Ab. zach.
Iohasin, who lived in the time of CHRIST, the disciple of Sammai. And before
these was another Dosthai, the son also of Iannai, of whom it is said in
Lib.Ilmedenu
Ilmedenu, that Senacherib sent R. Dostha to Samaria to teach the Samaritans
the law. This seems to be he, whom before out of Epiphanius we have called
Esdras, the first founder of the Samaritan heresy. And so Tertullian
Ter.prescrip. aduers.^aer.lc1.
says of him; Dosubeus the Samaritan, was the first that rejected the
Prophets, as not having spoken by the HOLY GHOST. The like testimony Hierom
gives of him. His colleague and companion is said to be one Sebua, the
supposed Author of the Sebvaeans. In Ilmedenn Ap.Drus.page.260.
he is called Sebaia: or Sebuia. Orig.de princip.4.c.2.
Dositheus also taught, that how and in what position of body he was in the
Sabbath morning, in the same he ought to continue all that day, without change
of gesture or place: that if he did sit, he should sit in the same place all
day long, and so of lying or other habit of body. The Author of this
Dosithean sect, (properly so called) lived, as Scaliger Scal. Elench.
Serarij.tribaer.15.
thinks, about or at the destruction of the Temple, and could not be that
first Dustai or Dosthaei.

The Sebuaeans Sebuaeans.
you have heard, in Drufius opinion, have their name of Sebuia, the companion
of Dosthai, sent by Senacherib, or rather by Esarhaddon: which if it be so, it
seems this sect is ancient, happily nothing differing from the other
Samaritans. Epiphanius makes a difference, Epiph.haer.11.
but the cause he alleges, was the Jews refusal of their help at
Jerusalem, which was common to all the Samaritans. The difference he alleges
is the transposing of their solemnities (for that quarrel betwixt them and the
Jews) from the Jewish times, so that they kept their Passover in August
(which they made the beginning of their year) Pentecost in Autumn, and that
of Tabernacles, when the Jews kept their Passover: neither might they
sacrifice in Garizin, observing such differing solemnities. Scaliger
Scal.Canon. Isagog.l.3. page.218.219.
(whom I shame not thus often to name, in relation of these things too
intricate for mine own, or for common wits to find) both in his Treatise
against Serarius, cap.1. and 21. and in his Canons Isagog. l.3. dissenteth from
Epiphanius: saying, that they dissented not from the other Samaritans, but that
the name was a common name, which the Jews ascribed to the Samaritans: It
signifies (...) Weekers: which name they gave them because that every week
between the Passover and Pentecost, they observed that day of the week, in
which the computation of the fifty days began, with as great solemnity as the
feast of Pentecost it self. This day, from which the reckoning began, was
called (...) the second, because it was the next day after the Azyma or
Feast Day. But the Samaritans reckoned the second after the Sabbath, and so in
all that space of fifty days, kept the first day of the week, that is,
Sunday, holy. Thus they kept seven Pentecosts in a year. And perhaps (he but
coniectureth) as they had these imaginary Pentecostes, so they might at other
times of the year have such imaginary solemnities of other Feasts. From that
word (...) the second day, and next to the Feast of unleavened bread, the
Sabbaths, says Scaliger in the same place, were called in order, the first
(...) the second Sabbath after that day, (...) and so the rest: and thus he
expounds those words of Luke c.6.v.1. secundo-primum Sabbatum, that is the
first Sabbath after that (...) or first day of the fifty which began to be
reckoned the next day after Easter till Pentecost. A place hitherto very
obscure. Epiphanius does number for Samaritane sects, The Essens, Esseni.
of which is before showed that they were Jews, and otherwise heretical and
idolatrous in respect of their morning-deuotions to the Sun, for which it
seems they might not, (certain they did not) communicate with other Jews in
the Temple and sacrifices. These pertain not to this place; as not
Samaritanes. A fourth Samaritane sect he accounts the Gortheni, Gortheni. or
Gortbaieni.
which differed from the rest, at least from the Sebuians, in keeping their
solemnities, Paschall, Pentecost, and of Tabernacles at the Jewish times, and
observed but one day holy: as likewise the fasting day.

CHAP. X.
The miserable destruction and dispersion of the Jews from the time of the
desolation of their City and Temple to this day.

THE Curse threatened unto this superstitious and rebellious Nation, Deuteronomy.28.28.
Madness, blindness, astonishment of heart, to grope at noone days as the
blinds gropeth in darkness, to be a wonder, aprouer be, and a common talk
among all people, among which they should be scattered from one end of the
world to the other, is this day fulfilled in our eyes, both in respect of their
Polity and Religion, Gods just judgment sealing that their own imprecation
Mat.27.25.
his blood be on us, and on our children, and pursuing them in all places of
their dispersion through the reuolutions of so many ages. Odious are they, not
to the Christians alone, but to the heathen people that know not GOD: P.
Galat.l 4. c.28. Bidalph.letter.
nor will the Turk receive a Jew into the fellowship of their Mahumetane
superstition, except he has passed first from his Iudaisme through the
pargation of a Christian profession, unto that their no lest ridiculous and
miserable devotion. 1.These.2.15.
GOD they please not (says Paul) and are contrary unto all men. This their
wretchedness although it seemed to begin, when Herod a stranger seized their
state, yet was that infinitely more then recompensed, when their Messiah, so
long before prophesied and expected, came among his own, but his own received
him not: yea, they crucified the Lord of glory. But even then also did not the
long-suffering GOD reject them, CHRIST prayed for them, the Apostles preached
to them remission of this and all their sins, till that (as Paul charge
them) they Act.13.46.
putting these things from, and judging themselves unworthy of eternal life,
GOD removed this golden candlestick from amongst them to the Gentiles, and
let out his Vineyard to other husbandmen. Famine, sword, and pestilence at once
assailed them. (And what shall not assail what will not prevail against the
enemies of GOD?) Jerusalem, sometimes the glory of Earth, the type of heaven,
the city of the great king, and mother city of the Jewish kingdom, from this
incomparable height, received as irrecouerable a fall, besieged and sacked by
Titus, and yet more violently tortured with inward convulsions and civil
gripes, then by outward disease, or foreign hostility. Josephus and Iosippus
Joseph. de Bello.Iud and Antiquit. Iosippus Hebr. both Englithed
have handled the same at large, both which can acquaint the English Reader
with the particulars. Besides many thousands by Vespasian and the Romans slain
in other places of Judea, Jerusalem the holy City was made a prison,
slaughterhouse, and grave of her own people. First had divine mercy
Eusebius.bist. Eccles.l.3.c.5.
by Oracle removed the Christians to Pella out of the danger, that without any
impediment the floud-gates of vengeance might be set wide open for Desolations
black guard to enter. Here might you see the strong walls shaking and falling,
with the pushes of the iron ram; there the Romans bathing their swords in
Jewish entrails: here the seditious Captains disagreeing in mutual quarrels,
written in blood; there agreeing in robbing and burning the City, and in
slaughter of the citizens: here hunger painted with pale colors in the ghastly
countenances of the starued inhabitants; there, died in red with the blood of
their dearest children, which the tyranny of famine forces to re-enter into
the tenderest-hearted mothers womb, sometime the place of Conception, now of
burial: Every where the eye is entertained with differing spectacles of
diuersified Deaths', the Ear with cries of the insulting Soldier, of the
famished children, of men and women, even now feeling the tormenting or
murdering hand of the seditious: the sent receives infectious plague and
Contagion from those humane bodies, with inhumanitie butchered, whom no
humanity buried: the taste is left a mere and idle faculty, save that it
always tasleth the more distastefull poison of not-tasting and emptiness: what
then did they feel, or what did they not feel? where all senses seemed to be
reserved that they might have sense of punishment? where all outward, inward,
public, private, bodily, ghostly plagues were so ready executioners of the
Divine sentence. The continual sacrifice first ceased for want of Priests of
the last course, to whom in order it had descended; after for want of a Temple
before polluted with Ethnicke sacrifices, and murders of the Priests and
Soldiers, and lastly ruined, the sacred vessels thereof being carried to Rome
for ornaments of the Temple of Peace which Vepasian had there Ios. de Bell.Iud.
l.7.c. 14.
erected.

Eleven hundred thousands are numbered of them which perished in this
destruction: The remnant that escaped the Roman sword, for the most part,
perished after in wars, or killed themselves, or were reserved either for
solemnity of triumph, or (if they were under seventeen years of age) sold
unto perpetual slavery. Iosep.de Bell. Ind.l. 7.c.17.
97000, of these Jewish slaves were numbered: Galatinus P. Galat de Atcan.l. 4
c. 21.
accounts 200000. And that the hand of GOD might be the more manifest, they
which at their Passeouer-feast had crucified the son of GOD, are at the same
time gathered together in Jerusalem, as to a common prisonhouse of that whole
Nation: and they, which had bought CHRIST of the Traitor Judas for thirty
pieces of silver, were sold thirty of them for one piece. Galatinus tells of two
false prophets, whom, coming in their own name, they received for their
Messiah, having before refused JESUS that came in his fathers name: both these
were called Ben-or Barchosba, that is, the son of lying. Sanhedrin. lib.s.
Helech. R Muse ben. Maimon.
The one, not long after the passion of CHRIST, (if the Jews be not the sons
of lying which write it) the other in the time of Adrian, Rabbi Akiba, (famous
for his wisdom, for his 24000. Disciples, and for his long life) received
both in their succeeding ages: and interpreted to the first, that place of Hag.

Haggai, I wilshake the heavens, etc. But afterward they slew him as the Talmud
witnesses, which also affirms Tractat. Meghila.
that Titus enjoined the Jews which he suffered to remain, that from thence
they should no more observe Sabbaths, nor abstain from menstrous women.

Forty eight years after the destruction of Jerusalem the Jews made the
City Bitter Bethoron.
to be their chief City, and rebelled by the persuasion of Bencochab (so he
called himself) that is the son of the Star. Of him did R. Akiba (which
had been armor-bearer to the former) interpret Talmud. Ierosol.l. Taanith.
that prophecy of Balaam, Number. 23. There shall arise a Star of Jacob. Adrian
then Emperor besieged them in Bitter, (where if you believe the Jewish Tract.
Beeressith rabb.
fables) were 80000 which sounded Trumpets, every one of them Captains of many
bands, which helped Barcosba, (so they called him after) that is, the son of
lying, who had 200000, soldiers, which to testify their love and valor had
cut off every man a finger from his hand. After three years and six months
the City was taken, and Lib.Echa. rabbethi.
this their Messiah slain, together with such multitudes that the blood
reached to the horses mouths, and carried down great streams with the
stream thereof, running to the Sea four miles from Bitter. And Adrian had a
Vineyard eighteen miles square, which he hedged with those slain carcasses,
as high as a man can reach (a reacher I think.) There were two Rivers
Lib.Masseabeth G^itlin.
in the region of Ierico, and the third part of them by estimation of the
Wisemen was the blood of the slain: and seven years together did the people
of the Gentiles satin and harten their Vines, only with the blood of the
Jews. Adrian slew also at Alexandria in Egypt, 700000. Jews.

Dion Niceus Dion. Nicaei Adrianus.
(a more credible Author) affirms that Adrian sent Senerus against the Jews,
who in regard of their multiudes would not try it with their joint forces in
set battle, but taking his occasions and best opportunity, proceeded more
slowly and more surely: took fifty of their fortified Castles, rased nine
hundred and fourscore of their best towns, slew at sundry times 580000. of
their men, besides innumerable multudes, which perished of famine, sickness,
and fire, these gleanings being greater then the other harvest. Salomons
sepulcher by falling down had fore-signified this their downfall: and
Hyaena's and Wolves prodigiously entering their cities, seemed to howl their
Funeral obsequies. All Iudaea was left almost desolate. Eusebius. bist.
Eccles.l.4.c. 6. Niceph.l. 3.24. Caes.Baron.anal.
Eusebius out of Ariston Pellaeus adds, that Adrian prohibited the Jews by
an Edict to come near to Jerusalem, or once from any high place to look
toward the same, or the region adioining. We have already showed how he
destroyed this City, and built a new (the present Jerusalem) called of his
own name Aelia. He made swine over the gates of this new City, which images
were most faithful porters to prohibit the Jews (faithfully superstitious in
their faithless superstitions) to enter. And as he had erected a temple to
Jupiter, in, or near the place where the Temple had stood, so (to afflict the
Christians also) he built another Temple of Jupiter in Golgatha, and of Venus
at Bethleem, which continued till the time of Constantine. The Christian Jews
gained by this loss: for when as they might not come to Jerusalem, they
afterward relinquished their wonted Jewish ceremonies. This was the end of
Barchosba. And such is the end of all which fight against God and their
Sovereign, their arrows which they shoot against the clouds fall down upon
themselves: he proves a falling Star, which being but a groser elementarie
exhalation, is elevated by his own aspiring course (not to the firmament, but)
to some higher region of the air, where it shines with the fire which burns
it, and moves with some short glaunce, till with selfe-ruine it returns
(whence it had beginning) to the Earth.

Thus have we seen the Jews banished their country (about the year 135.)
agreeing to which their miserable Estate was that order of men, mentioned by
Ios.Scal.Llenc. triher.Ser.c.13.
Scaliger called (...) Mourners, Heraclitus his heirs, which spent their time
in weeping, and intended nothing but Lamentation for the Desolation of their
Sanctuary. These have been among the Jews (says he) ever since this
destruction, and were once a year, on the ninth day of the month Ab, allowed
entrance into Jerusalem by Adrians Edict,. And it is written in an ancient
Iournall of Bordeaux, Itinerarium Burdegal.
that not far from the Images there is a stone boared through, to which the
Jews come yearly, and anoint it, lamenting grievously, and renting their
garments, and then depart. Benjamin Benjamin.
(an Hebrew Author) relates of these Mourners that they give Tithes of all
which they possess to the Wisemen, always sitting in the School, and to the
humbled Israelites and devout persons which lament Sion, and bewail Jerusalem.
These dwell in Caves, or in ruined houses, fasting all the days of their life,
except on the Sabbaths and Festiualls, beseeching mercy continually at the
hands of GOD, touching the banishment and deportation of Israel. And so let
them mourn which refuse Luc.2.11.
the glad tidings of great joy to all people, that vntovs is borne JESUS a
Savior, which is CHRIST the LORD.

But yet what rockie heart can but mourn with them, and for them, thus made
spectacles to the world of bodily and spiritual misery, which both in these
times mentioned, and (before) in the time of Traian, and in all ages since,
has pursued them in all places of their habitation, if that name may be given
to this world-wandring and vagabond-people? In the time of Traian,
Eusebius.li.4.c.2
Adrians predecessor, the Jews had rebelled in Egypt, and Cyrene, where they
committed much outrage and mischief, under one Luke their captain, against
whom the Emperor sent Martius Turbo, who destroyed many thousands of them; and
fearing that the Jews in Mesopotamia would do the like, commanded Lucius
Quietus to destroy them utterly; in recompense of which service, executed to
his mind, he made him President of Iudaea. Dion Dion.N.Traia^us.
says, That the Captain of the Jews was named Andrew, and that they slew
many Greeks and Romans, did eat their flesh, girt themselves with their
guts, were imbrewed with their blood, and clothed with their skins; many
they sawed asunder, from the crown downwards, many they cast to the beasts,
and many were found to kill one an other with mutual combats, so that two
hundred and twenty thousand persons perished by this unspeakable cruelty. In
Egypt and Cyprus, under their Captain Artemion they destroyed two hundred and
forty thousand. They were subdewed by Traians Captains, specially by Lucius:
and it was made a capital crime for a Jew (although forced by tempest) to set
foot in Cyprus. Africa was repeopled (where they had destroyed) with new
Colonies. No marvel if the Romans (thus provoked) both in the time of Traian
and Hadrian destroyed so many thousands of them. Julian afterward gave them
leave to return into their country, and rebuild their Temple, more for hatred
of the Christians, then for love to their Nation: whose wickedness and
answerable success herein is plainly detected and detested by Gregory
Nazianzene, Greg.Naz.Orat.4.cont.Iuliaen.
and other Fathers, as Cap.3.
we before have related.

To add further of their bodily confusions and illusions of their bewitched
minds: Nicephorus mentions a Pseudo-Moyses of the Jews in the parts of Arabia
destroyed by the forces of the Empire, together with his Accomplices in a like
rebellion. Socrates Socr.li.7.c.37
describes a further madness of theirs (for true is that saying of Saint
Paeul. That they which will not believe the Truth, are given over to strong
delusions to believe lies.) In the I Will of Creete was Anno 434.
a false prophet, that affirmed himself to be Moses, which led the Israelites
through the red Sea, and to be sent from heaven to those Jews to conduct them
through the red Sea, into the continent of the Holy Land. This he persuaded
them for the space of a whole year, going from city to city: and at last
induced them to leave their riches to them that would take them, and to follow
him: at a day appointed he went before them unto a Promontorie of the Sea, and
there biddes them leap in; which many obeying, perished in the waves, and many
more had perished, had not some Christian Merchants and Fishers been at land,
which saved some, and forbade the rest to follow. The Jews seeking to be
revenged of this counterfeit Moses. could no where find him: and therefore
thought him to be some Devil in humane shape, which sought their destruction,
and thereupon, many of them became Christians.

Of their miseries sustained in all places of their abode, all histories gave
mention. And yet their superstition is more lamentable then their dispersion,
as also their pertinacie and stubbornenesse in their superstition. And
certainly me thinks, that even to him that will walk by sight, and not by
faith, not obliging his credit to mere authority, as the case stands
betwixt us and the Scriptures, but will be drawn by the cords of Reason only
and Sense, even to such a one me thinks this History of the Jews may be a
visible demonstration of the truth of Christian Religion: not only because the
truth of the prophecies of Genesis 49.
Iaacob, of Deuteronomy.28.
Moses, of Esa.6.
Esaias, and other the Prophets is fulfilled in them; and because GODS justice
still exacteth the punishment of the betraying and murdering that Just one;
but especially in this, that the bitterest enemies, cruellest persecutors, and
wilfullest haters that ever were of the Christian truth, are dispersed into so
many parts of the world, as witnesses of the same truth; holding and
maintaining to death the Scriptures of Moses and the Prophets; then which, even
Reason being judge (as is said before) we will not desire sounder and fuller
proofs of our profession. Neither is our Gospel wherein we differ from them,
any other then the fulfilling of their Law: and CHRIST came not to destroy the
Law, but to fulfill the same. In him the Promises, in him the Figures, in him
the righteousness of the Law, righteousness in doctrine, righteousness in
practice, righteousness of doing, righteousness of suffering, to satisfy the
debt, to merit the inheritance, are the witnesses, that in him they are all,
yea and Amen, have received their perfect being and accomplishment. But ^.Cor.
3.15.
the veil is over their hearts; eyes they have and see not, ears and hear
not: They hold out to us the light of the Scripture, themselves walking in
darkness, and reserved to darkness; like to a Lamp, Lantern, or
Candlestick, communicating light to others, whereof themselves are not
capable, nor can make any use.

But to return, to consider further of their dispersions. We have showed how
they were utterly cast out of their Country: and Italy, and the Empire was
filled with Jewish slaves. Nor was this their first dispersion: but as the
Aslyrians had carried away the other ten Tribes, whose offspring, as is
thought, about the year of our Lord God, one thousand two hundred, founded
that mighty Empire of Cathay; so the Babylonians carried away the two Tribes
remaining, which might have returned under the Persian Monarchy; but many
remained in those Countries till the dissolution of that Jewish state, and
after. They had a famous University at Babylon, which endured till the year
of CHRIST one thousand three hundred (so writes Boterus. G. Botero Ben., Terza
part.libr. 2.
) At which time they fleeing the persecutions of the Arabians dispersed
themselves into India, where many are found at this day. These, through
continual conuersing with the Gentiles and Christians, have small knowledge of
the Law, and less would have but for other Jews, that resort thither out of
Egypt. Before that time also, if we believe the Ethiopian History, twelve
thousand Damian a Goes. Ludonic. Car.
Jews (of each Tribe a thousand) went with the Queen of Saba's son, which
they say she had by Solomon, into that country, and there remain their
posterity to this day. Thus is Asia and Afrike fraught with them, but Europe
much more. Adrian Boter. Ibid.
banished five hundred thousand into Spain, where they multiplied infinitely,
and founded an University at Corduba, about the year of our Lord one
thousand: and at Toledo was a School of twelve thousand Jews, about the year
of our Lord, one thousand two hundred thirty and six, as writes Rab. Mosche
Mik. apud Ruxd. ca.1.
Rabbi Mosche Mikkotzi: from hence it seems they swarmed into England and
France. Their miseries here in our Land endured, are by our Authors mentioned
Fox Act and Monuments. History of ^^^well etc.
in the days especially of king Richard the first, and King Iahn; and the
whole Land gave a fifth part of their goods to King Edward the first to banish
them, Ann. one thousand two hundred ninety and one.

Out of France they were thrice banished by three Philips although in Auinion
there still remain some of them. Being expelled France, they sought habitation
in Germany, where Conradus the Emperor admitted them into the country of
Sueuia: and thence they flowed into other parts, into Bohemia (in the city of
Prage, are about fifteen thousand of them) and into Austria, and into Hungaria,
whence, for the crucifying of a child, they were banished by King Mathias: as
at Trent for the like fact, and poisoning of Wells, they sustained much trouble
in Germany: and many passed to Venice; many also went from thence into Russia
(where the people cannot abide to hear them named) and Poland, where Cassimere
the Great for love of an Hebrew Less, gave them many privileges. They live
dispersed in the towns and villages, occupied in handicrafts, and husbandry.
They have great Synagogues in Cracouia, Leopolis, and at Trochi, a town of
Lituania: and Master Barkeley a Merchant of London, who has spent many years
in Liuonia, Polonia, and other of those cold countries, told me, That the
Jews farm the Custom of the Kings, and at Samaiden in Curland one of these
Jewish Customers beat out the brains of a Polonish Merchant, for deferring to
open his pack: but in regard of the peoples hatred, provision is made, under
great penalties, for their security; and yet many Jews were there executed by
occasion of a murren, procured (as was suspected) by Jewish exorcismes
intending a plague to the men, and not a murren to the beasts, if their working
had sorted: but the Jews said it was but a pretense to deprive them of their
riches. They here in Poland print what Books they list.
They were cast out of Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella, in the year, one
thousand four hundred ninety and two. It is thought Ioannes Reuclinus
Cabal.l.1 says 420000. persons. Ghachami^^.
, that there went out of Spain a hundred and twenty thousand families of them
(besides Moors) and out of their kingdoms of Naples and Sicill. Hence they
passed Anno Domini one thousand five hundred thirty nine, into Tuscane, and
the Popes Dominions, whence they were banished by Paul the fourth, and Pius the
fifth; and received again by Pius 4, and Sistus the fifth; Rome and Venice
having great store of them. This is the Popes holiness: he that would not
willingly endure a Protestant in the world; besides the Stews under his
Holiness nose, can endure the Graecians: yea and these Jews, Rome it self
having ten thousand, or, Relat. of Rel. West.
after others reckoning, twenty thousand of them privileged, with their fine
Synagogues, Liturgies and public Sermons; and to strain up their Usury to
eighteen in the hundred: having also in some places (it may be in all) a
peculiar magistrate to decide controversies between Christians and them, with
particular direction to favor them in their trade. Dulcis odor lucriex
requalibet The beastly trade of Curtisans and cruel trade of Jews is suffered
for gain, these paying a yearly rent for the heads they wear, besides other
means to rack and wrack them in their purses at pleasure, they being used as
the spunge-like Friars, to suck from the meanest, to be squeezed of the
greatest; insomuch that the Pope, besides their certain tribute, does
sometimes (as is said) impose on them a Subsidy for ten thousand crowns
extraordinary for some service of State. So well is the rule of Paul observed
by this Bishop, not to be a lover of filthy lucre.

Out of Spain they went into Barbary and diverse other Countries, and some
into Portugal: where John the second made them pay eight crowns for a poll,
and yet limited them a short time of departure. Emanuel his successor did the
like 1497. except they would become Christians, for which he assayed diverse
means. But not prevailing, he caused their children, under the age of four
and twenty years, to be baptized; some rather hurling their children into
pits, some killing themselves: many for fear were baptized; some went into
Italy and abode in Ferrara, Mantua, Venetia, in the name of Maranes, and have
a Synagogue at Pisa. But the greatest part of them went into the East to
Constantinople and Salonichi, in which two Cities there are about a hundred and
sixty thousand of them. There are of them in all the chief Cities of traffike
in the Turkish Empire. Theatrum vrbi^m Ad. To.
Tyberias is wholly inhabited with Jews, which City Zelim gave to Gratiola a
Jewish matron. In Jerusalem there are about a hundred houses of them. There
abide not many, because of a superstitious opinion, That before the Messiah
shall come, a great fire from heaven will consume that City and Country, to
purge it of the abomination committed there by profane Nations. At Zante they
are so hated, that from Mawndy Thurseday until Saturday noone, they dare not
come abroad: for the people, in a foolish zeal, would stone them: and some
refuse to eat of their meat or bread. The Turks in their reproach use such a
kind of imprecation; If this be not true, would GOD I might die a Jew. The old
Testament is read of them in these parts in the Hebrew Let.Bidulp.
, but their Cakamins and Cohens, that is, their Wisemen and Priests preach in
Spanish. Only at Salonichi (anciently Thessalonica) in Macedonia, and at
Safetta in the Holy Land, (two Universities) they speak Hebrew. They will
rather in blasphemy testify their hatred of CHRIST, then be able to dispute.

CHAP. XI.
A Chronology of the Jewish History from the beginning of the world, briefly
collected.

THe Flood happened (as Moses reckons the parcells in the Ages of the
Patriarchs) in the year of the world 1656, 1656.
which are thus accounted. Adam at the 130 year begat Seth. Seth at 105 begat
Enos. Enos at 90 Kainan. He at 70 Mahalaleel, who at 65 begat Iared. Iared
being 162 years old begat Henoch, who at 65 begat Methuselah: and he at 187
begat Lamech, who in his 182 year begat Noah: in the six hundredth year of
whose life the Flood came.

The second age of the world is reckoned from the Flood to Abraham: whose birth
was after the Flood 292 years: Sem two years after the Flood begat Arphacsad.
He at 35 years Selah, who in his thirtieth year begat Heber. Heber at 34
Peleg, who being thirty years old begat Regu, and he at 32 Serug, in whose
thirtieth year Nahor was borne, who at 29 begat Terah, who at 70 years begat
Abram. Thus Scaliger; Calnisius, Buntingus, Arias Mont. Genebrard, Pererius,
Adrichomius, Opmeerus, etc But Iunius, Bronghton, Lydyat, Codomannus etc. add
60 years more. For Moses says, Genesis 11. 32. That Terah died in Charan, aged
205 years, and then Abram (as it is in the next chapter) was 75 years old; so
that Terah, when Abram was borne, was 130 years old. Whereas therefore he is
said at 70 years to beget Abram, Nabor, and Haran; it is to be understood, that
he then began to beget: A^no mundi ^008. Abram borne.
Abram being named first for divine privilege, not because he was eldest. The
like phrase is used Genesis 5. 32. Noah being five hundred years old, begat Shem.
Ham, and Iaphet: and yet neither were they all borne at once, nor was Shem the
eldest; let the Reader choose whether of these opinions he best likes.

In the 75 year Abram went out of Charan, having received the promise: from
whence, to the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, are numbered 430
years. Rather herein we are to follow Paul's interpretation of Moses, then
Genebrards, who Gal. 3. 17. accounts those 130 years mentioned by Moses, Exo.
12. 40. from the premise made to Abraham, and not from the time that Jacob went
down with his family into Egypt. So that the departure out of Egypt, after
Scaligers computation, and some others, Perkins, Adrichomius etc. happened in the
year of the world 2453; whereto if we add those sixty years of Terahs life
before mentioned, it amounts to 2513. And so Broughton reckons. Iunius and
Lydyat account 2509. The difference seems to arise from hence, that one
accounts from Abrams departing out of Vr of the Chaldees; the other from his
departure from Haran after his fathers death about five years after. But it
were an endless work to reconcile Chronologers in their different
computations. Some reckon the 25, Ios.Scaliger annot.in Eusebius.
Scaliger the 15 of April, the day of their departure. And then the Hebrews
began their year at the Spring Aequinoctiall, which before they began in
Autumn.

From this departure, to the building of Salomons Temple, Ios.Scaliger De
Em.T.libr.5. 2933. Lydyat, 2988.
Scaliger reckneth 480. years, whose first foundations (he says) were laid
the 29 of May, being Wednesday; Anno Mundi 2933, and of the Great Julian
Period (which differs 764 years from the year of the world) 3697. In this
computation of 480 years betwixt the departure and foundation of the Temple,
many Chronologers agree, Arias Montanus, Adrichomius, Broughton, Perkins.
Lydyat, etc. although some dissent much. The sum arises of these parcells.
Moses died forty years after their deliverance. Joshua ruled seventeen;
Otbonicl forty; Ehud four score; Gedeon forty; Abimelech three; Thola twenty
three; Iaer twenty two; Iephte six; Ibsan seven; Elam ten; Abdon eight; Sampson
twenty; Heli forty; Samuel and Saul forty; David forty; Solomon in the fourth
year and second month began to build his Temple, after which he reigned thirty
seven years.

An.M.3360.
From thence to the destruction of the Temple under Zedekids are accounted 427.
This agrees with Ezekiel.4.5. Lydy.3417.
Ezekiels account, reckning a day for a year, 390 days of years after the
apostacy of Israel from God, the rebellion against the house of David in the
beginning of Rehoboams reign, by the means of Jeroboam; to which if we add 37
years which Solomon reigned, after the foundation of the Temple, the sum is
427. The same appears thus; Roboam reigned 17 years; Abiam three; Asa 41;
Ichoshaphat 25; Iehoram eight; Ahaziah one; Athaliah six; Ioash forty; Amazia
29; Azaria or Vzzia 52. Betwixt Amazia and Azaria the kingdom was ruled eleven
years by the states, as some gather out of 2. Reg 15. 1. (others reckon it
not.) Iotham 16. Abaz sixteen, Ezekiah 29. Manasses 55. Amon 2. Josias 31.
Iehoahaz three months; Eltakim or Iehciakim eleven years; Iehoiachin 3 months;
Zedekiah or Mattaniah eleven years. The little difference from the former
number may be ascribed to the current and unfinished years of some of their
reigns.

From this time of Sedekias ruin, some begin the reckoning of the seventy
years captivity; in which time others comprehend all Sedekias reign, and
account the return under Cyrus to be fifty nine years after this desolation;
and from thence 108. to the Edict of Darius Nothus; from which time are numbered
259 to the Dedication of Judas Maccabeus; and from thence 162 years to the
birth of CHRIST. So Scal, de Em. libr.7.
Scaliger.

It were a work irksome to my self, and tedious to the Reader, to recite the
variable opinions of Chronologers, or to trauerse their arguments about these
points.

To recite here their high Priests and later Kings, with the time of their
pontificalitie and reign, out of Arias Montan. I hold not unfit. First Jesus
returned with Zorobabel, and built the Temple, whose time of priesthood, after
Scaliger, Iunius, and those that reckon upon the Edict of Darius Nothus, must
needs be very long They which list to see the variety of opinions of Jewish,
Greek, Latin, old and new Chronologers, may see Genebr.chron. lib1. in fine.
Likewise, see our 4. Book chap, 4.
. To leave that therefore, his son Ioacim Joseph.Antiq. and Car.Sigo.de
republ.bebr.lib.5. have set down the catalogue of hie Priests, from the first
to the last.
succeeded in the priesthood 28. years, besides twenty years, with his
father. Eliasib held the priesthood 41 years; Ioiada 25; Jonathan 24; Ieddoa
27. till the time of Alexander; Onias 27, after Philo; but Eusebius says 23;
Simon Iustus 13; Eleazar twenty; Manasses twenty seven; Onias thirty nine.

Afterward the Syrian Kings appointed high Priests: of whom, Jason was Priest
3 years; Menelaus twelve years; in whose seventh year, Judas Maccab. began to
administer the commonwealth. Ionathas brother of Judas ruled eighteen years;
Simon his brother was both Priest and Captain eight years; Ioannes Hircanus
his son 31.

Aristobulus, son of Hircanus, first after the captivity called himself King,
and reigned one year; Ioannes Alexander his brother 27: after him, his wife
Alexandra nine; Hircanus her son, three months; Aristobulus his brother, three
years. Jerusalem was taken of Pompey and Hircanus recovered the Priesthood,
which he held 22 years; Antigonus by aid of the Parthians possessed Iudaea
five years; and in his second year Herod was proclaimed King by the Romans,
who took the city the fifth year of Antigonus, and reigned four and thirty.

Scaliger ascribes Can.Isagog.l.2
to Herod's kingdom the number after Eusebius account, reckoning from the birth
of Abram 1977; he died 2016. Archelaus his son was made, by Augustus,
Tetrarch of Jerusalem 2016, and was banished 2025. Agricola was made King by
Caligula 2053. Agrippa his son, by Clandius 2060, and died 2116, thirty
years after the destruction of the Temple. The Dynasty of the Herodians lasted
139 years. Thus Scaliger. He attributes the nativity of CHRIST to the 3948
year of the world.

Here we must leave the Chronologers contending of the year of the world, in
which this blessed Nativity happened; some adding many more years, some not
allowing so many. It is certain by the Scripture, that he was borne in the 41
or 42 of Augustus; baptized in the fifth of Tiberius, then beginning to be about
thirty years of age: in the 33 year he was crucified. In the 72 as Baronius,
and 71 year of CHRIST, as Buntingus, and Lively account, Jerusalem was
destroyed by Titus, in the second of Vespasian. Ar. Mont. reckons this the
year of the world 3989, and says, that the Hebrews reckon it the 3841, which
must needs be false. The fault arises from the false computation of the
Persian and Grecian monarchies Ios.Antiq.lib. ^0.18.
. Josephus counts from the time of Herod, to the destruction of the Temple.
28 high Priests, and 107 years. After Scaliger in his Can. Isag. li. 3. this
year 1612 is the 1614 of CHRIST, of the world 5561, after the Jewish account of
Hillel 5372, of the Armenians 1061, of the Julian Period 6325, of the Hegira
1021; Anno 4. Olymp. 597.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Jewish Talmud, and the Composition and Aestimation thereof: also of the
Jewish learned men, their succession, their Scriptures, and the translations of
them.

RAbbi Mosche Mikkotzi, R. Mos. in Sepher.mitzuos gadol.
in a Work of his, set forth anno 1236, as Buxdorfius cites him,
Synag.Iudaic. Buxd. latin reddit.ab Herm. Germberg. c.1.
says, That the Written Law which GOD gave to Moses, and Moses to the
Israelites, is obscure and hard, because it speaks some things contradictory
(which he seeks to prove by some places Exodus 12. 15. Deuteronomy. 16 3.and
Leuit.23. 6 Ex. 19. 11. and Exodus 20. 22. etc.
mis-interpreted) and because it is imperfect, and contains not all things
meet to be known. For who shall teach us (says he) the notes of Birds and
Beasts? (a Franciscan might answer him Legend of Saint Francis, where he is
said to preach to the beasts and speak to the Swallows etc.
out of the Legend of S. Francis, the Patron of this Order) who shall teach them
the propriety and nature of points, and accents, and of letters? also, what fat
might be eaten, what not? etc. Many such things are defective in the Law, and
therefore there is need of some other Exposition of the written Law, whence
these things might be learned. This Exposition (forsooth) must be their Talmud,
the generation of which viper, touched before, we will here more fully declare.

They say, that Moses on mount Sinai was not with God 40 days and 40 nights,
to keep geese. And God could have written those Tables of the Law in an hour,
and sent him away with them; so to have prevented that Idolatry with the
golden Calfe. But God brought Moses into a School, Pircke seu capita R.Eliczer
ca.40.
and there gave him the Law in writing, first, and then in all that long time
expounded the same, showing the cause, manner, measure, foundation, and
intention thereof in the true sense. This unwritten and Verbal Law did Moses
R.Aben Eora R.Salom.I ^^^^, and alij in Deuteronomy. 4 14.
teach Joshua; he, the Elders; from these it was derived to the Prophets. After
Zachary and Malachy, the last of these, it came to the great Sanhedrin: and
after them, by Tradition, from father to son.

And R.Bechai Exodus.34.
Rabbi Bechai says, That Moses learned the Law written, in the day time; and
this Traditionall Law by night: for then he could not see to write. Rabbi
Mosche Mikkotzi shows the cause why GOD would deliver the same by mouth
only, and not in writing, lest (I wisse) the Gentiles should pervert this, as
they did the other which was written. And in the day of Judgment, when GOD
shall demand who are the Israelites, the Gentiles shall make challenge, because
of the Law written, but the Jews only shall be accepted, as having this
Simani, this verbal exposition. GOD also (say they) gave them Chachamim,
Wisemen, authors of diverse ordinances amongst them, as to bless GOD at the
Sunne-rising, and Sunne-setting; and of Schools where children should be
taught the Law of Moses in every City, and where the Law of Moses should be
read weekly: and that the Israelites should not eat or drink with the
Gentiles, nor what they had dressed; after the example of Daniel Dan.1. 8.
etc.

But when the Temple was destroyed, and the Jews carried away captives, then
arose up Rabbi Judah Hannasi, who is called (for his humility and godliness)
Our great Master; to whom GOD procured such favor in the eyes of Antoninus the
Emperor, that he had authority to assemble out of all places of the Empire
the most learned Jews, to consult in this their almost desperate estate, what
course to take for the preservation of the Law amongst the people. And although
this Kabala or Law, given by word of mouth, might not be committed to writing;
yet in consideration, and commiseration of their misery, whatsoever thereof
was remaining in memory, he writ in a book which he called Mischna, that is,
a Deuteronomie (...)
, or Law reiterated, containing six sums, divided into sixty less parts or
tractates, and these into 532. chapters. Thus far R. Mikkotzi.

In this book were contained the Traditions and Ordinances of the Elders,
according to the prescript whereof, the Jewish Synagogue was to be ordered:
and it was received and approved of the Jewish Synagogue, Chron Heb. Tzemach
David
in the year of CHRIST 219. The Talmud is (in manner) nothing but a commentary
on that Misna: a work full of divine, natural and political wisdom, says
Golatinus, of the parts thero^^ see his first book. chap.5. 10. Picus says it
was composed about the year 150. Others, say in the year 120. Io. Wolf.
Section. Memorab. C. ^^ntenar. 2.
Some years after, Rabbi Iochanan, Rector of the University of Jerusalem for
the space of eighty years, enlarged that book, and called it the Talmud of
Jerusalem, which for the difficulty and obscurity thereof was not had in such
estimation as the former, nor is it at this day. After him, Rabbi Ass read in
the Schools those Tractates, handling every year two of them; so in the
sixty years of his Rector-ship, he went twice through it all; but finished in
writing only five and thirty Tractates. After him in the year Pet. Galat.
has 436.
427. Maremar was made Rector, to whom Mar the son of Rabbi Ass adjoined
himself. These perfected that which Rabbi Ass had left unfinished. And that
which they thus added was called Gemara, or the complement.

Thus the Mischnatos, and Gemara made up the whole Talmud Talmud is the same
that Doctrina, or discipli^atio.
. These two spent in their labors threescore and thirteen years. And so in the
year of our LORD 500. the Talmud was perfected, received for authentical, and
called the Babylonian Talmud, according to which the Jews, to this day, behave
themselves in cases spiritual and temporal.

And this is that Law verbal, or delivered by word of mouth, which is equalled
to the other, without which the written Law cannot be conceived or understood:
The joy of the heart (says Aben Ezra Ab Ezra in Prooem. Pentateuch
) and refreshing of the bones; betwixt which and the written Law he can find no
Sic Tridenti^na Synodus sell. 4. dec. 1. vt dein.
difference, but being delivered to them from their Elders. In one of their
books, Semok, vel Sephar mitzvos katon R. Isaac.
printed at Cremona, 1556. is this sentence. Think not that the Law written is
the foundation, but rather the Law Traditionall is the right foundation: and
according to this Law, did GOD Exodus.34.27.
make covenant with the Israelites, for GOD foresaw their captivity in time to
come, and therefore lest the people, among whom they should dwell, should write
out and interpret this Law, as they did the other, GOD would not have it
written. And although in process of time this Law be now written, yet it is
not explained by the Christians, because it is hard, and requires a sharp wit.
That which is spoken of the Law, is applied to commend their Talmud: If you can
frustrate (says the LORD) my Covenant with the Psalm.1.2. Esa.59.vlt.
Ierem.33.25.
day and the night, that is, according to their book Tanchuma, when you will no
longer learn and observe the Talmud. And in the Tract it. Bauamaziab.
Talmud is thus recorded: To study and read in the Bible is a virtue and not
a virtue, that is, a small virtue: but to learn their Mischna or Talmud-text
is a virtue worthy reward: and to learn by heart Gemaram (the complement of
the Talmud) is a virtue so great that none can be greater.

Hence it is that their Rabbines are more exercised in their Talmud, then in
the Bible: as on which their faith is founded more then on the other: and
according to this do they expound the Scripture. And as their Talmud is most
certain, so also is that (whatsoever) exposition of their Rabbines, according
to the same. Thus says Rabbi Isaac Abhuhabh, whatsoever our Rabbines in their
Sermons and mystical explanations have spoken, we are no less firmly to
believe, then the Law of Moses.

And if any thing therein seem repugnant to our sense, we must impute it to
the weakeneste of our conceit, and not to their words: as for example, it is
written in the Talmud, Tract. de Sabbal. c.2.pa.30.
that a Rabbine once preached, that the time would come, when a woman should
every day be delivered of her burden: according to the saying, Ierem. 31. 7.
Concepit statimque peperit. One not believing this, the Rabbine answered that
he spoke not of a common woman, but of a hen, which should every day lay an
egg.

Such are their expositions, I know not, whether fitter to be heard of
Heraclitus, or Democritus, more lamentable or ridiculous; and yet is it there
said, that their words are the words of the living GOD, whereof not one shall
fall to the ground; and must not be derided either in word or thought, whether
ye respect the persons, or works of their Rabbines. Therefore in a Dutch book
printed in Hebrew characters at Cracouia, 1597. it is written, that the Jews
are bound to say Amen, not only to their Prayers, but to all their Sermons and
Expositions, according to the Prophet Esaias, Cap.26.2.
Open the gates, the people comes (schomer amunim) which keeps
righteousness: that is (say they) which saying Amen, believes all things
which the wise Rabbines have written. And if any be so simple, that he cannot
understand, yet must he heleeue.

When two Rabbis (says their Talmud) maintain contrary opinions, yet must
not men contradict them, because both of them has his Kabala or tradition for
the same: and this is a rule in their Rabbines, Remember rather the word of the
Scribes, than of the Law of Moses. R. Solomon Iarchi upon Deuteronomie chap.
17. verse 12. Thou shall not decline from the word that they shall show thee,
to the right hand or to the left, has these words; And when he says unto
thee of the right hand, that it is the left; and of the left hand, that it is
the right a R. must be believed, though he say the right hand is the leit.
, thou must believe it: how much more if he says, the right hand is the right
hand, etc. They have a Story in their Talmud tract. de Sabbal.
Legend for the same, That there camea Goi a Gentile to Sammai, and asked him,
how many Laws they had, who answered, two, a Written and a Verbal. He
replied; The Written Law I acknowledge no less then thou: make me therefore
a Jew, and teach me the other. Sammai refused: and he went to Hittel, (these
both lived a little before the time of CHRIST) who admitted and instructed him;
after he bade him pronounce the Letters in order, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, etc.
which he did. The next day he bade him say the same Letters backward, Gimel,
Beth, Aleph. The Gentile said, Rabbi, yesterday you taught me otherwise: And
yet said Hillel you believe me, and so learn of me; which you must no less
do in the traditionall Law, believing all that is therein. I had almost
thought in reading of this Hillel, I had been reading the life of Ignatij vita
lib.3.cap.7.
Ignatius Loiola the Iesuite-founder (so like is the Story, though the names
differ) who practiced himself, and trained up others, Adsapientem hanc
sauitamque stultitiam caecae, vtipse appellabat, obedientiae, says Maffaeus in
a large Discourse hereof: PAVLS Omnia probate was in these days; but
prudentiam non obedient is, sed imperantis esserespondit Ignatius: negabat
obedient is nomine dignum haberi oportere qui legitimo superiori non cum
voluntate iudicium quoque submitteret: in superior^^^ iussis examinando esse
arrogantiam. And this wise and holy folly of blind obedience is with all rigor
obscured still in his followers who submit their minds and judgments, as well
as affections, to their superiors in all things. And what more could old
Hellel say to his disciples? Or does GOD himself exact? Bernard, throughout
his seventh Epistle, teaches more soundly of the Pope, and those religious
Superiors; Bern.epist.7.
Nec dico praepositorum mandata esse a subditis iudicanda, vbinibil inhere
depraehenduntur diuinis contrarium institut is. Sed necessarium esse dico and
prudentiam qua aduertatur, siquid aduersetur, and libertatem qua ingenue
contemnatur. Hanc ego nunqu ins aemuler obedientiam: talem nuhi nunquam libe at
modestiam, vel potius molestiam imilari. Talis siquidem obedientia omniest
contempt is deterior: talis quoque modestia vltra omnem modum extenditur, -- O
patientia, omni digna impatientia! But to leave this question and our Jesuits
till fitter time; the Jewish Rabbines auerre, that whosoever mocketh or
contemns their sayings, shall be punished in hot and boiling Zoah, or
excrement in hell. And thus much of their Talmud, the original, and authority
thereof. More modest yet were those Fathers of Trent, Self 4.d^c.1.
Paripietatis assectu and riuerentia traditiones vna cum libris veteris and Noui
Testamenti sulcipimi.s and vencramur.
that would ascribe but equality of reverence and respect to their Traditions
with the Scripture, which must needs acknowledge themselves beholding to them;
left they complain they follow not their Traditionaire Masters in making them
fit lower: and they have their Anathema as ready as the Rabbines their Zoah;
and their Traditions, Canons, and Constitutions, must interpret as well as
their Kabala.

But before we leave their Talmud (thus highly esteemed amongst them) I
thought meet also to speak more largely, both of that, and of their learned
Rabbines, out of Petrus Galatinus, who thus writes thereof.

The Galat. de drcanis lib 1. per totum.
Traditionall Law they call Tora scebeal pe, that is, the Law which is in the
mouth, or delivered by word of mouth. Rabbi Moses Aegyptius tells the
passages thereof thus: Joshua receiving it of Moses, delivered it to Phineas,
the son of Eleazar the Priest: Phineas, to Hels the Priest: he, to Samuel
the Prophet: Samuel to Danid: he, to Achias the Prophet, who delivered the
same to Elias, the teacher of Elisha: Elisha or Elisaus to Ioiada the Priest:
this Ioiada, to Zacharias; Zacharias to Hosea; and he, to Amos; Amos, to Esaias;
of whom Micheas received it, and of him Joel; Nahum from him; and from him
again, Habacuck, who taught it Sephanie, the instructor of Jeremy, of whom
Baruch the Scribe learned it: Baruch taught it Ezya. Until this time the Jews
had none other but the written Scripture.

Now for their Scriptures: they call the same Arabaa Veesrim (that is, the
four and twenty) of the D. Whitak.de script q^st. c.6. Shows that the Jews
accounted so many books of the Bible, as they had letters, in the Alphabet, to
wit, two and twenty, he alleges authors of this number two and twenty, and
the conceit thereof Gregor.Naz. Hilary, Cyrillus. Hierosol Epiph. Hieron.
Isidorus, Niceph. Leentius, etc. The reason of this difference, Epiph. hares.8.
shows, that some of the books were double, and therefore himself numbreth
seven and twenty, or rather, says he, two and twenty, according as more or
fewer were thus reckoned cogether. And in lib.de Men's. and pond. he has the
same. Ruth is, says he, reckoned with the book of ludges, Nehemia with Ezra,
and Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, are not divided.
number of the books after their computation, all which they reduce to four
parts. The first of which they call Tora, the Law, or Humas, the Pentateuch or
five books: and call every book after the first words in the beginning
thereof. The second part has four books; Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.
The third part comprehends four other, which they call the last Prophets;
Esaias, Jeremy, Ezekiel, and the book of the twleue smaller Prophets. The
fourth part is called Chetuuim, and has eleven books, Paralipomenon or
Chronicles: the Psalms; the Proverbs; Job; Ruth; Ecclesiastes; Lamentations;
Canticles; Ester; Daniel; Ezra, which they make one with Nehemia,
Ecclesiasticus, Judith, and Tobias, and the first book of Maccabees they have,
but reckon not among the four and twenty. The third and fourth books of Ezra
I have not seen in Hebrew; but some of them say, that they are lately foundat
Constantinople: But the second of Maccabees, and the book of Philo (called the
Wisdom of Solomon) I never saw but in Greek, nor those additions to Daniel.
But after the Babylonian captivity, Ezra writing out the Law, which had been
burned in the destruction of the City, other wisemen writ out the
Exposition of the Law, left, if another destruction should happen, the same
might perish. And from that time, all the Wisemen, which are called the men of
the Great Synagogue, in their teaching the Law, delivered the same both in
word, and writing, until the Talmud was written.

These men's authority has the next place to the Prophets. And are in this
order mentioned in their Talmud. Ezra delivered the same to Simon the Priest
called Iaddus, who was honored of Alexander. This Simon delivered this
explanation to Antigonus; Antigonus to Josephus the son of John, and to
Josephus the son of Iohezer: They to Nitaeus Arbulensis, and Joshua the son
of Peratria, whose auditour the Jews falsely affirm that JESUS, our blessed
SAVIOVR, was, which lived an hundred and ten years after. Those two delivered
the same to Judah the son of Tibaeus, and Simon the son of Sata: These to
Samaia and Abatalion: and they to Hillel and Samaeus. Hiliel flourished an
hundred years before the destruction of the second Temple; and had eighty
scholars or disciples, all of excellent wit and learning. Thirty of them, for
their excellence, had the Divinity descending upon them as Moses: and other
thirty obtained, that the Sun should stand still for them, as Joshua: The
rest were accounted mean. Of these, the greatest was Ionathas son of Vziel,
the least John the son of Zachaeus, which yet knew the Scripture and Talmud,
and all things else to the examples of Foxes, and Narrations of Devils.

Hillel and Samaeus delivered this explanation to this John, and to Simeon the
Just, son of the said Hillel, who after Luke2.28.
received CHRIST in his arms, and prophesied of him in the Temple. Rabbi Moses
proceeds, and says that Simeon taught Gamaliel, Paul's Master; and Gamaliel
instructed his son Rabban Simeon, who was slain of Hadrian the Emperor,
after he had taught his son Judas, whom the Jews for his learning and
holiness call Rabbenu Haccados, (that is, our holy Master) of which honorable
name there had been another in the time of the Roman Consuls. These for the
most part, besides almost infinite others of their hearers, have left many
things written of the explanation of the Law; of which the Talmud was compacted.

Of the Authentike Authors of the Jews before CHRIST'S time, Galatinus further
adds the threescore and twelve Interpreters, who are said by Ptolomies
direction to be separated in threescore and twelve cells, or several rooms;
and each interpreting by himself, did all agree in words, order, and time of
their translation, exactly. Calendar. Iud. apud Ios. Scalig. see cap.6.
But howsoever Josephus, writing in Greek, boasts of this translation, yet
the Jews (I know not whether of envy at the effect thereof among the
Christians) keep the eight day of Tebeth fasting, for grief of that Greek
translation. Jesus Sirach mentions his Grandfather and other writers. And an
hundred and sixty years before CHRIST flourished Aristobulus, a Jew, and
Peripatetike Philosopher: who by Ptolomoeus Philometors persuasion writ
Commentaries on Moses, and spoke many things of the Messiah: as did also Rabbi
Iodam, and R. Ibba not long after: and after them, R. Simeon ben lohai. After
these, Rabbenu Haccados writ a book called Gale-razeya, that is, the reuealer
of secrets, very divinely uttering many things of CHRIST. The like did Rabbi
Nahumias son of Haccana, both expounding the Prophets, and affirming that the
Messiah was to come within fifty years; and writ an Epistle thereof to his
son, of whom he hoped that he should live to see him. About the same time
(two and forty years before CHRIST) Ionathas the son of Vziel, and scholar
(as I said) of Hillel, translated all the old Testament into Chaldee, and
expounded the same so, that it might seem rather a Gloss and exposition, then
interpretation. This the Hebrews call Targum, that is, the Translation, which
has with them no less credit then the text it self, and thereby expound all
hard places of the text. They tell therefore, that at that time wherein he
labored this work, if a Fly or such creature did fly over him or his paper,
presently, without any harm to the paper, it was consumed with fire from
Heaven. And although his translation of the Pentateuch be most rare, yet I once
saw it: for that which is most common was the work of Ankelos a Proselyte,
whom the Hebrews affirm to be the son of Titus the Emperor, who also
turned all the Bible into Chaldee, and is of no less reputation with the
Jews, then the former, and is also called Targum.

After the Times of CHRIST, Philo and Josephus are famous: and after the
resurrection of CHRIST, the Jews were of three sorts; some true believers,
others absolute denyers, the third would have the Christian Religion and the
Jewish Ceremonies to be conjoined in equal observation; against which third
sort the first Council, Act. 15. was summoned.

The modern Jews insist principally on the literal sense of Scripture; the
Elder sought out a spiritual and mystical sense, accounting this a great
matter, the literal, but small, like to a candle, with the light whereof, the
other (as a hidden pearl) is found. The Talmudists followed the allegorical
sense; the Cabalists, the Anagogicall.

As concerning this Cabala, in old times they communicated not that skill to
any, but to such as were aged and learned; and therefore nothing thereof, or
very little, is found written of the Ancient, except of Rabbi Simeon Ben
Iobai. But the Doctors of the later Jews, lest that learning should perish,
have left somewhat thereof in writing, but so obscurely, that few know it, and
they which do, account it a great secret. Amongst the Christians, Johannes
Picus began first to suspect, and spy it, as afar off. After, Paulus
Israelita, Augustus, Instinianus, Capnio, Aegidius Viterbiensis writ thereof.

Thus much out of Galatinus his first book, De Arcanis: Gal. de Arcanis. Mor.

out of whom, and out of Philip. Mornaeus, they which please, may borrow
arguments to convince the Jewish incredulity, and stubbornenes, and to
confound them by their own testimonies, both from these elder Writers above
mentioned, and also from the later, both compiled in their Talmud. So great is
the Truth, and so mightily it prevails, that it extorteth not only her own
weapons, usurped and stolen by her enemies: but their own also, wherewith they
come armed against the Truth, and retorteth them on themselves; as David served
the Philistims: 1. Sam.17.51.
Who cut off Goliahs bead, with Goliahs sword: as 1. Chro. 11.23.
Benaiah (one of his Worthies) slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five
cubits long, and in the Egyptians hand was a spear, like a Weauers beam;
and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the
Egyptians hand, and slew him with his own spear. Thus did Q. Curt.l.9.
Dioxippus the Champion (if forrenners delight any) deal with Horratus the

hated abroad, for their heresies and treasons.

Let Saint John's, Let England, and the whole Church still sing the ten
thousands, that thou do thus slay with their own weapons; and let the
Apostoticall Truth escape, whiles her apostaticall enemies, the Pharisees and
Sadducees, are set together by the ears. A happy and Divine stratageme, which
(not to detract from others just praises, in this or other parts of the
battle) had been singled, and singularly managed by thy prowess, which

But how has that fatal and deadly name of Babel transported me? Truly the
likeness of these Traditionaries, Cabalists, Talmud Babylonica.
muddie Talmudists, and Legendaries (as will appear to an easy obseruer and
comparer of this ensuing History to their practice) which have been mustered
from the Eastern and Western Both Bellarmine and Baroni^s approve, and prove
Rome to be Babylon.
Babel, and the like manner of their confusion, has almost made me forget the
History and my self, but never a whit the Truth. And this will be further
manifested in the next Chapter, where their account of their Talmud, and in the
rest of this book, where their superstitious devotion is related.

As for those testimonies of the Jews against themselves, besides the
Scriptures (which (in regard of the true sense) the veil over their hearts
will not suffer them to read, but it is a sealed book unto them, and they
have left the riches thereof unto us, as 2.Reg.7.7.
the Aramites left their tents, with their horses and treasure, to the pined
Israelites)

Their other Authors are so plain and plentiful in the mysteries of our
Religion, as I know not whether it cause greater pleasure to read their
writings, or astonishment and wonder at the Nation; so stricken with madness,
and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart, since they have shut their
eyes against the Sun of righteousness; on whom that threatened plague is
come, Deuteronomy.28.29.
Thou shall groape at noone-dayes, as the blind does groape in darkness. For
out of their Talmud-Authors is plainly delivered the mystery of the Trinity,
the Incarnation of the SON of GOD, his two Natures, his Birth of a Virgin,
his Spiritual Kingdom, the time of his coming, the truth of his Prophecies,
and power of his Miracles; the Redemption of Mankind, by his Death, his
Crucifying, Descent, Resurrection and Ascension: and that their Nation was to
be rejected, the old Law to cease, a New to succeed, etc. All which as they
agree unto that sweet and blessed Name, and Person of JESUS (which name, and
that of EMANVEL, is also found in their writings) so do they argue the
severity of GODS Judgments, when men will not believe the Truth, that by the
efficacy of error, they shall have eyes and see not, ears and hear not
(neither ours nor their own) as Paul, and CHRIST himself often told them. But
those particulars, as rather appertaining to disputation, then history, (and
therefore too much impertinent to our purpose) the desirous Readers may at
large find in Morney and Galatinus, not to mention Iud. Viu. de V. C. F. Seb.
Munster. de side Christ. and Ind. Censura.
others.

The witness of Josephus, being one, whose name we often use in this History,
may justly challenge me, if I should omit him, especially seeing he lived in the
very days of the Apostles, who, as he witnesses of John Baptist, and of many
other things mentioned in the Gospel, fully agreeing therewith: so concerning
our LORD and SAVIOVR, has this testimony.

Ios.Antiq.18.cap.4.
In the time of Tiberius, there was one JESUS, a wise Man (if at leastwise he
was to be called a man) who was a worker of great Miracles, and a Teacher of
such as love the Truth; and had many followers, as well of Jews as of
Gentiles. This was CHRIST. Nevertheless being accused unto Pilate, by the
Chief of the Jews, he was crucified. But yet for all that, those which had
loved Him from the beginning, ceased not to continue still. For he showed
himself alive unto them three days after his Death, as the Prophets had
foretold of him, both this and diverse other things. And even unto this day do
those continue still, which after his name are called Christians. Thus much
Josephus. Thus did the Truth force him to confess, whose History of the
destruction of his Nation, what is it but as a Commentary on JESUS Prophecy
thereof, and their fearful imprecation, Matthew.27.25.
His blood be upon us and our children showing that the wrath of GOD was come
upon them to the utmost?

From Mount Oliuet, where JESUS was first apprechended, and where last those
blessed feet touched the earth, (as if Mercy had there left a print of
Justice) was Jerusalem besieged, and at their Feast of Passover, (when they
had crucified CHRIST) they were couped up, as it were, assembled by Divine
Justice from all quarters to destruction, together with that their City, where
they had slain the LORD. But of this before. It will not be unsavory to the
Reader, observing herein Divine vengeance, to relate as unsavory a tale as
ever was devised, which their Talmud tells in derogation of CHRIST'S Miracles,
in which I know not whether to call them Beasts or Devils, so witless, and
withal so wicked is their blasphemy. For sooth in Salomons Temple there was
(say they) a certain stone of very rare virtue, wherein Solomon, by his
singular wisdom, had engraven the very true name of GOD, which it was
lawful for every man to read, but not to conne by heart, nor to write out.
And at the Temple door were two Lions tied at two chains, which rored
terribly, that the fear thereof made him to forget the name that had committed
the same to memory, and him to burst asunder in the midst, that had put it
in writing. But JESUS, the son of Marie, say they, regarding neither the
Curse annexed to the Prohibition, nor the roaring of the Lions, writ it out in
a Bill, and went his way with it joyfully. And least he might be taken with the
thing about him, he had a little opened the skin of his leg, and put it in
there, and afterward wrought his miracles by the virtue of that name. I should
be almost as absurd as they, if I should dispute against it, seeing in this,
and most of their braine-sicke dreams, the very recitation is sufficient
refutation.

But before we shake hands with the learned Writers of the Jews, it is not
unmeet, in my opinion, here to meet with some questions which some have moved,
concerning them and their dealing in and with the Scriptures. For since that
the Council of Trent has decreed, in the year 1546, both the divine
authority of Scriptures Canonical, to the Apocrypha-bookes, which the Jews
receive not, nor ever did; and has made the vulgar Translation Ses.4. In
publicis lectionibus, disputationibus, praedicationibus, aut expositionibus,
procuthentica habeatur: and quod ecm nemo reijcere quouis praetextu and eat vel
praesumat.
Authentical in public Lectures, Disputations, Preachings, and Expositions,
that none, under any pretense whatsoever, shall presume to reject it: it is
wonder to see how eagerly (that I say not impudently) diverse of them have
sought to slander the original Text, and have blamed, as Authors thereof, in
the New Testament, Heretics, and in the Old, Jews; covering their malice to
us with pretense of the malice of Heretics and Jews, and forgetting the true
Rule, That it is a shame to belie the Devil. Thus have Lib.2.cap.13.
Canus and Pintus, and Gregorius de Valentia, Sacroboscus, and others, traduced
the Jews in this behalf; themselves refuted by their own (which yet by
consequent overthrow that former Decree) Sixtus Senensis, Ribera, Cardinal
Bellarmine himself, Andradius, Arias Montanus, Isaac Levita, etc. Besides, of
ours many, and especially our own learned Countrymen, Whitaker, Reynolds,
Morton, etc.

Bellar.de ver. Dei.lib.2.cap.1.
Bellarmine has both taught us the vanity of their opinion, that hold, That
the Scriptures were all lost in the Babylonian Captivity, and were by Ezra
renewed miraculously (who is rather Ezra.4.14.
commended for his industry in interpreting and observing them, and for
ordering and compacting them in one volume, then for such needless revelation
to find that which was never lost: an Author rather, as Hier. Prolog. Galeat.
Hierome has observed, of the present Hebrew Letters, then of their ancient
Scriptures) and has also proved the absurdity of their conceit, that imagine
the Hebrew Fountains corrupted. First, by Bell.ibid.c.2.
the Arguments of Origin and Hierome, That such corruption must have been
either before or after CHRIST: if that; CHRIST would have reproved and not
commended their Scriptures to their search: if this; how comes it, that the
testimonies, cited by him and his Apostles, are found now in Moses and the
Prophets, as they were then cited? Secondly, out of Angustine, That it is not
likely they would put out both their eyes (in depriving their Scriptures of
truth) that they might put out one of ours: nor was it possible that such a
general conspiracy could be made. Thirdly, from their more then reverent
estimation of their Scriptures, for which they would die, if it were possible,
a hundred deaths, and even still (as Isaac answers B. Lindan his Scholar)
they proclaim a Fast to expiate, if by some accident that Book but falls to the
ground. Fourthly, some places in the Hebrew are more strong against the Jews
then our Translations are, and the Prophecies, which make most against them,
remain there uncorrupted. And lastly, the providence of GOD would never herein
fail his Church, but has left them, with their books, to be dispersed
through the world, to bear witness to that Truth which they hate and
persecute. These are Bellarmines Arguments; which, because they are the Truth,
are also ours: and therefore we have been bold with the Reader to insert them.
As for that Emendation or Correction of the Scribes, which Galatinus
mentions, wherein they have corrupted the Text, he proves it to be a late
dream of the Talmud, and answers the Arguments of his fellows, herein not
so Catholic as himself.

Now although this may seem more then enough to convince that folly, yet it
shall not be impertinent to add out of Arias Montanus somewhat touching the
same, because it opens another mystery touching the Hebrew Learning, and the
Masoreth. Refert Ren^ldus ex praef. Bibl. part.6. Antuerp.
When the Jews (says he) returned into their Country after the Captivity
threescore and ten years in Babylon, it befell them partly by occasion of
their long troubles, which did distract their minds, partly by corruption of
their native Tongue, which was grown out of kind, first into the Chaldee, and
afterward into the Syriake, that they neither knew nor pronounced so well the
words of the Scripture, written (as the manner was) without vowels. Whereby it
came to pass, that in the writing of them there crept in some fault, either
through injury of the Times, or by reason of troubles which fell upon the
People, or by negligence of some Scriucners. But this inconvenience was met
withal afterward by most learned men, such as Esdras was, and afterward
Gamaliel, Ioseus, Eleazar, and other of great name, who provided by common
travel, with great care and in dustrie, that the Text of Scripture, and the
true reading thereof, should be preserved most found and vncorrupt. And from
these men, or from their instruction, being received and polished by their
Scholars in the Ages following, there came, as we judge, that most profitable
Treasure, which is called Masoreth, that is to say, a Delivery, or
Traditionall, because it does deliver abundantly and faithfully all the diverse
Readings that ever were of the Hebrew Bibles. Wherein there appears an
evident token of the providence of GOD, for the preservation of the sacred
Books of Scripture whole and sound, that the Masoreth has been kept till our
time these many hundred years, with such care and diligence, that in sundry
Copies of it, which have been written, no difference was ever found. And it
has been added in all the written Bibles that are in Europe, Afric, or
Asia, each of them agreeing thoroughly therein with other, even as it is printed
in the Venice Bibles, to the great wonder of them, who read it. Thus far
Montanus: and by this Masoreth, their objection of Caari and Caaru, in the two
and twentieth Psalm, is answered, in that certain readings have the later and
truer, as the Masoreth testifies. Gram. Heb. (...).
Martinus affirms, That these Masorites invented the pricks wherewith the
Hebrew is now read, to supply the lack of vowels, herein using religious care,
least by inuenting new Letters to that purpose, they should have changed that
ancient form of writing, and somewhat impaired the majesty thereof. They
tell, that when a certain Rabbine had read Zacar for Zecer, he was slain of
his Scholar Ioah, for violating Scripture.

Gene^. Chron 4.
Genebrard denying their opinion, that make Ezra or Esdras Author of these
Hebrew pricks and accents, says, That they were invented after the times of
Honorius the Emperor, in the year, after the Temple was destroyed, 436, which
is (says he) from CHRIST 476, in Tyberias, a City of Galilee; the chief
Authors were Aaron Aseries, and James, sons of Niphthali, whose dissenting
one from the other caused a division among the Jews, the Western Jews
following the former, the Eastern, which dwelt in Babylonia, the later.

The Syriake Tongue some hold to have sprung from the corruption of the Chaldee
and Hebrew mixed. The Editions and Translations of the Scriptures, out of the
Hebrew into the Greek, are Bell q.sup. cap.5.

was before the time of Alexander, whereof Plato and the Philosophers borrowed
not a little. The first (already mentioned) of the Seventy. The second of
Aquila, first a Gentile, after a Christian, and now last a Jew, in the time of
Adrian. The third of Theodotion, a Marcionist, under Commodus. The fourth of
Symmachus, first a Samaritane, and after that a Jew. Of the fifth and sixth are
not known the Authors. Of all these Origin compounded his Hexapla. The seventh
was the correction rather then a translation. The eight was of Lucian, Priest
and Martyr. The ninth of Hesychius. But the most famous and ancient, which the
Spirit of GOD has by often allegations, in some measure, confirmed, is that of
the Seventy.

says were threescore and ten, in which they were divided, and which Epiph.

Hierome derideth the same as a Fable, because neither Aristaeus, which then

the Law translated by them; Justinius, Irenaeus, Clemens, Eusebius, write, That
they translated all. And although Aristaens name but the Law, yet who knows
not, that by this general name they sometime comprehended all the Scripture,
as in the New Testament is seen; as 1. Cor. 14. 21. and Ioh. 10. 34. etc..

interpretation of the same.

your selves and wonder (says the LORD, of this people) they are blind, and
make blind: they are drunken, but not with Wine: they stagger, but not by
strong drink etc. And after, because of their Hypocrisies, And their fear
toward me is taught by the Precept of Verse.14.
Men: Therefore behold, I will again do a marvelous work in this People;
even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall
perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. This day is
this Scripture (as it has been many Ages heretofore) fulfilled in our eyes:
as it has appeared by our former declaration of their Talmud, and further
follows, in rehearsing the thirteen Articles of their Creed, thus briefly
expressed in their daily Prayer-bookes.

1. I Believe with a true and perfect faith, that GOD is the Creator, Governor,
and Preserver of all Creatures, and that he has wrought all things, works
hitherto, and shall work for ever. 2. I believe with a perfect faith, that GOD
the Creator is one, and that such an Unity as is in him can be found in none
other, who alone has been OUR GOD, is yet, and for ever shall continue OUR
GOD. 3. I believe with a perfect faith, that GOD the Creator is not bodily, nor
endued with bodily proprieties, and that no bodily essence can be compared to
him. 4. I believe that GOD the Creator is the first and last, and that nothing
was before him, that he shall abide the last for ever. 5. I believe that he
alone is to be adored, and that none else may be worshipped. 6. I believe that
all, what soever the Prophets have taught and spoken, is sincere truth. 7. I
believe that the Doctrine and Prophecy of MOSES was true; that he was the
Father and chief of wise men, that lived then, or before his time; or should
be in times to come after. 8. I believe that all the Law, as it is this day in
our hands, was so delivered by GOD himself to MOSES. 9. I believe that the
same Law is never to be changed, nor any other to be given us of GOD. 10. I
believe that he knows and understands all the works and thoughts of men,
as it is written in the Prophet, He has fashioned their hearts together
Ps.33.15.
considering all their works. 11. I believe that GOD will recompense to all
men their works: to all, I say, which keep his Commandments, and will punish
all transgressers whomsoever. 12. I believe that the MESSI AS is yet to come,
and although he do long differ his coming, yet will I hope, that he will
come, waiting for him every day, till he does come. 13. I believe with a
perfect faith, that there shall be an awakening of the dead, at that time which
shall seem fit to GOD the Creator: the name of which GOD the Creator be much
blessed and celebrated for euer-more. AMEN.
This is the Jewish Faith, in which with much vexation, doubting, and
lamentation, they die; upon which, their Religion has been always founded: but
it was first put in writing, and brought into this order by R. Mosche bar
Maimon, who died in the year after their reckoning 4964, Anno Dom. 1104. and
strait charge was given, That the Jews thenceforth for ever confessing it in
this order, should, according to the same, live and die. This their Creed,
howsoever Charity may construe much of it to a better sense, yet according to
their understanding does it principally aim at the subversion of Christian
Religion; as appears in a more strait examination, after their sense of the
2,3,4, and 5, the 7,8,9,10,11,12. Articles: all which make against the person
or the office of the son of GOD, as they understand them; denying his
Godhead, and disannulling his office, affirming, as a Jew shamed not to
profess and utter unto M. Buxdorfius, That it needed not that any should
satisfy for them, for every Fox must yield his own skin and hairs to the
flayer. And the Jewish Faith, says R. Joseph Albu, is founded upon three
foundations: upon the unity of the divine essence; upon the Law of Moses, and
upon the eternal reward of good works, and punishment of evil, contemning the
Passion of CHRIST, Es.53.5.6
by whose stripes we are healed, and on whom GOD has laid the iniquities of
us all. It is written also in their Tract. Sanhedrin, c. 11.
Talmud, that all the Israelites have their portion in the world to come, not
all alike, but he shall have a greater part that has done more good works,
and the wicked and impenitent shall be punished twelve months in Hell or
Purgatory, after which time they also (and some sooner, if they have been
less sinners) shall have their part, but a less then the former: but to them
which deny GOD (which become Christians) their fore-skinne grows again, and
as uncircumcised eternally are punished in Hell. And the son of a deceased
Jew is bound to say, for the space of one year, See Cap.19.
a prayer called Kaddisch, thereby to redeem him from Purgatory; in which
respect the father dies with joy. A good woman may do the like for her
husband. But R. Bechai (who excludes all other Nations from their part in the
Resurrection, preferring the Jews in a fourfold privilege, viz. the Land of
Canaan, the Law, the Prophets, and the Resurrection) recites out of the great
Tract.de nouo anno, c.1.
Talmud, That three forts of men shall rise again at the day of Judgment:
one, of the best Israelites; a second sort of the wicked and worst; the third
of a mean, who have done as much good as evil. The good shall presently go
into life eternal; the wicked shall be cast into Hell, as in the twelfth of
Daniel, and shall be for ever in torments of body and soul. The third and
meaner sort of sinners shall be tormented for twelve months space for their
sins in Hell; at the end of which time their bodies shall be consumed, and
the wind shall scatter their ashes under the soles of the feet of the just,
etc. And as worthily do they prove it out of the Zach.13.8.
Prophet: And in that day two parts shall be cut off, and die, and the third
shall be left therein: and I will bring that third part through the fire, and
will fine them as Silver is fined, and will try them as Gold is tried. And in
another place, 1.Sam.2.6.
The LORD kills and makes alive, brings down to Hell, and raises up;
Just as fitly applied, as 1. Cor.3. and such like places by our
Purgatorie-Spirits. R. David Kimchi upon the first Psalm, and Es. 26.
commenteth, That the wicked shall not rise, but in the day of death their soul
shall die together with their body. And Aben Ezra in his exposition of Dan.
12. writes out of Rabbi Higgaon, That many shall rise, and many not rise, but
suffer everlasting reproach; and expounds it thus, That the good Jews which
die in exile, shall rise again when the Messiah shall come, and shall live as
long as the Patriarchs before the flood: and then they shall make merry with
the great fish Leuiathan, and the great bird Ziz, and the great Ox Behemos See
cap. 20.
; of which we shall speak after. When this is done, they shall die, and at the
last day shall be raised up again, and shall possess eternal life, where
shall be no eating nor drinking, but glory etc. Jacob Gen 47.30.
desired to be buried in Canaan, not in Egypt, for three causes (says R.
Solomon Iarchi) because he foresaw, That of the Exo. 8.17.
dust of Egypt should be made Lice: Secondly, because the Israelites which die
out of Canaan shall not rise again without much pain of their rolling through
the deep and hidden vaults of the earth: Thirdly, least the Egyptians should
make an Idol of him. For the better understanding hereof, let us hear what is
said out of the book Tanchum (an Exposition of the Pentateuch) concerning this
subject. The Patriarchs (says he) desired to be buried in Canaan, because
they which are there buried shall first rise in the time of the Messiah. And R.
Hananiah says, That they which die out of Canaan, must endure two deaths: and
the same appears Ier. 20. where it is said, Pashur should go into Babel, and
should there die, and there be buried. What (quoth R. Simon) shall them all the
just perish, which die out of Canaan? No, but GOD will make them Mechillos,
that is, deep Clifts and Caves under the earth, by which they may pass into
the Land of Promise; whither when they are come, GOD, shall inspire into them
the breath of life, that they may rise again, as it is written Ezec.37.12.
, I will open your Graves, and cause yon to come out of your Sepulchers, etc.
The like is written in their Targum, or Chaldaean interpretation of the
Canticles: When they dead shall rise, Mount Oluiet shall eleaue asunder, and
the Israelites which have been dead shall come out of the same, and they which
have died in strange Lands, coming thither by holes under the earth, shall
come forth. And for his cause I my self (says our Author) have heard the Jews
say. That sometimes some of the wealthiest and deuoutest amongst them go into
the Land of Canaan, that their bodies may there sleep, and so be freed from
this miserable passage under so many deep Seas and rough Mountains.

Now to come from their Faith to their works: Their wise Rabbines persuade the
fillie people, That they are the only elect people of GOD, who easily can
keep, not the Decalogue, or ten Commandments alone, but the whole Law of
Moses. They divide the whole Law into six hundred and thirteen
Commandments, and them again into Precepts and Prohibitions: Of the
commanding Precepts they number two hundred forty and eight; just so many as
(according to the Rabbines Anatomy) a man has members in his body. Of the
prohibiting Commandments they reckon three hundred threescore and five, as
many as are days in the year, Brandsp
or (as in the book Brandspiegel) veins in a man's body. Therefore if every
member of a man do cuerie day perform one of the Precepts and omit one of the
things prohibited, the whole Law of Moses shall be every year, and so for
ever, fulfilled. Their wise Rabbines say further, That the men only are to
observe those six hundred and thirteen Commandments, the women are only
subject to the Prohibitions; yea, of those prohibitorie Mandates, only to
threescore and four are they obliged by some, and to six and thirty of the
former; and this because of their other householdbusinesse, and subjection to
their imperious husbands. Some of their deepely-wise Rabbines add to those
six hundred and thirteen, seven other Commandments, making up the number of
six hundred and twenty; just so many as are words in the Decalogue, and as
arise of the word Keter signifying a Crown: for were it not for the Law, GOD
would not have created the World; and for the observation thereof it yet
subsisteth. And they which keep all the Commandments, do set a Crown on
the head of GOD, and he upon the head of those which crown him, shall set
seven Crowns, and make them to inherit seven Chambers in Paradise, and will
keep them from the seven infernal dungeons, because they have obtained the
seven Heavens and the seven Earths.

Their Wisemen affirm, that every vein of the body of a man does provoke
him to omit that which is forbidden, and he which does omit such their vain
veinewarning, has no good vein in him: every of his members also do provoke
him to perform those inssorie inventions. But as vain should I be as they, if
I should not make some end, where they can find none. We would now from these
generalities proceed to the particulars of their superstitions, tracing them
herein from their birth to their graves, Religion being, in the pretense of
their Law, the square of all their (otherwise civil) actions; at least to
speak of their Superstitions in the same. But first, seeing Sebestian Munster
has written a whole book, both in Hebrew and Latin, of those six hundred
and thirteen Precepts, taken out of Moses, with the Expositions of their
Rabbines, I thought good to cull out some, which seem most remarkable and
strange, to entertain our Reader.

Out of Negative Precepts expounded by the Rabbines in P MUNSTER. Praec.Mos.
cum exp. Rab.
THou shall have ne strange Gods in my sight. Exodus 20. The Name of GOD is
forbidden to be communicated to any creature. Thou shall not violate

mine holy name. The Rabbines say, If any do against an affirmative Precept,
and repent, his sin is forgiven him: But he which transgresses a Negative
Precept, is not cleansed by repentance, but it remains to the day of
Expiation (which is the day of their solemn Fast and Reconciliation.) But he
which commits a sin, whereby he deserves Death, or Excommunication, is
not then purged, but must abide thereunto the divine chastisements: and he
which violateth the Name of GOD, cannot be absolved from that sin but by
death. Thou shall not Leuit 19.17.
hate thr brother in thy heart. He which is wronged by another, should not hate
him, and hold his peace, but reprove him openly; and if he repent, he ought not
to be cruel to him: But if any be often reproved, and will not amend, it is
lawful to hate him. This CHRIST Ma^^^.5.43.
consuteth. No Excd.34.14.
Idol is to be adored. If a man have a thorn in his foot, he may not bow
before an Image to pull it out: and if money fall out of his hand, he may not
there, before an Image, stoop to take it up, least he might seem to adore it,
but he must sit down on the ground to do it. And if the water of a Fountain
be caused to pass through the mouth of an Image, he may not drink thereat,
least he should seem to kisie the Image. An Exodus.20.23.
Image may not be made, viz. the Image of a Man in Silver or Gold, if it be
embossed or set out, but if it be stamped in metal (in manner of a Seal) it
is lawful. But of Beasts, Birds, Trees, and Flowers, those prominent Images
(which are made standing out) are lawful. Otherwise of the Sun, Moon, and
Stars. No Deuteronomy.7.
commodity is to be raised from Idols. If a Tree be planted near an Image,
one may not sit under the shadow thereof, nor pass under it, if there be any
other way: and if he must pass, it must be running. Things employed to
Idolatry may be used of us, if the Gentiles have first profaned them. It is
not lawful to fell them Wax or Frankincense, especially at their Candlemasse
Feast; nor books to use in their Service. Our women may not perform a
Midwiues office to them, nor nurse their children. Thou shall Exodus.20.10.
do no work on the seventh day. Nothing that belongs to the getting of Food
or Raiment. It is unlawful to walk on the grass, least thou pull it up with
thy feet; or to hang any thing on the bough of a Tree, least it break; or to
eat an Apple, plucked on the Sabbath, especially if the tail or wooden
substance, whereby it grows, be on it; or to mount on a Horse, least he be
galled; or to go into water, least thou wipe thy clothes: which holds also,
if they be moistened with Wine or Oil (but not in a woman that gives suck)
who may wipe her clothes, for the more purity of her prayers. The stopple of a
Vessel, if it be of Hemp or Flax, may not be thrust in, though it run,
especially if any other Vessel be under. To mix Mustard Seed with Wine or
Water; to lay an Apple to the fire to roast; to wash the body, chiefly, with
hot water; to sweat; to wash the hands; to do any thing in private, which may
not be publicly done: (but some say, it is lawful privately to rub off the
dirt with his nails from his clothes, which publicly he may not:) To read by
a Light, except two read together: To set sail: (but if thou enter three
days before, it is not necessary to go forth on the Sabbath) to be carried
in a Wagon, though a Gentile drive it: if fire happen on the Sabbath, to
carry any thing out, but thy food, raiment, and necessaries for that day, and
that wherein the holy Book lies: to put to pasture Horses or Asses, coupled
together: to receive any good by the Light, or Fire, which a Gentile has made
for the Jew; (otherwise, if he did it for himself:) To play on any
Instrument; to make a bed; to Number, Measure, Judge, or Marry, least they
should write any thing: To read at home when others are at the Synagogues: To
speak of Buying and Selling (which it seems they observe not:) To visit
Field or Garden: To Run, Leap, or tell Tales, etc. All these on the Sabbath
day are unlawful. For dangerous diseases it is lawful to violate the Sabbath:
Such are the three first days after a woman's travel, etc. But of this, see
Cap.17.
also the observation of their Sabbath. It is not lawful to walk out of the
City, but their limited space: but within the City, as far as they will,
though it be as big as Niniue. It is forbidden Leuit.22.
to hurt the Seed-members of Man or Beast. Neither Males nor Females may be
gelded or spayed: and yet we may use such beasts. It is punishable to know,
kiss, or embrace one which is forbidden by the Law. Leuit. 18. Therefore our
Masters have forbidden to smile on such, or use any means or tokens of Lust.
Likewise they have forbidden men to know their wives in the day time, unless
it be in the dark, or under some Covering. The same is forbidden to a drunken
man, and to him which hates his wife, least they get wicked children between
them. Also, to follow a woman in the streets, but either to go before, or
beside, her. And he which is not married, may not put his hand beneath his
Navel, nor touch his Flesh, when he makes water. The fat may not be eaten.
The fat of the Heart may: but not that which is one the Inwards and Reins, and
Stomach, and Guts, and Bladder: the rest may be eaten. If thy brother
Leuit.25.39.
be poor, thou may not abuse him; to wit, to base Offices, as to untie the
shoe, or to carry Vessels to the Bath. Thou may Deuteronomy.23.19.
not lend to an Israelite on Usury nor borrow on Usury. Nor be a witness or
surety in cases of Usury; nor receive any thing besides the principal,
especially on any Covenant going before. He that by constraint does any thing
worthy of death (although he violate the Name of GOD) ought not to be slain.
Wicked Exodus.23.1.
men are not competent witnesses. He is accounted wicked which transgresses
any Precept, for which he is worthy to be beaten. A Thief and a Robber is not
sufficient to be a witness, after he has made restitution: Nor an Usurer, nor
a Publican, nor he which is enriched by play, nor children, till they have
beards, except he be twenty years old. The Deuteronomy.17.17.
King ought not to multiply Wives. Our Masters say, That the King may have
eighteen wives. If any of the seven (Canaanitish) Nations shall come in the
hands of a Jew, he ought to slay him. The father or the husband may disannull
the vows of their children or wives. And the Wisemen may release the vows of
those which repent of their vow. A son of thirteen years and a day, and a
daughter of twelve and a day (if they be out of their parents tuition) have
power to vow. There are fifty defects which make a Man or Beast incapable of
sacred Functions; to be either Sacrificer, or Sacrifice: five in the ears,
three in the eyelids, eight in the eyes, three in the nose, six in the mouth,
twelve in the Seedvessels, six in the hands and feet, and in the body four,
etc. Besides, there are fourscore and ten defects in a Man, which are not in
a Beast. No defect, unless it be outward, makes a man unfit.


Out of their Affirmative PRECEPTS. Praec.Moscum Exp. Rab.
Every one Deuteronomy.11.19.
ought to teach his son the Law: Likewise his nephew; and Wisemen, their
Disciples: and he which is not taught it of his Father, must learn it as he
can. He which teaches another the written Law, may receive a reward; but not
for teaching the Traditionall. Rise before thine Leu.19.32.
Elder: that is (says R. Iosi) a Wiseman, although young in years. To him
thou must arise, when he is four cubits distant; and when he is passed by,
thou may sit down again. The sinner must turn from his Number.5.7.
sin unto GOD. And being returned, he must say, I beseech thee, O LORD, I
have sinned and done wickedly before thy face: so and so have I done, and
behold it repents me of my wickedness, I am confounded for my works, I will
do so no more. And thus ought all to say, which offer sacrifices for sin;
and they, which are condemned to death for their crimes, if they will that
death do away their offenses: But he which has sinned against his neighbor,
ought to make restitution, and ask pardon; otherwise his sin is not
remitted. And if his neighbor will not pardon him, let him bring three other
to entreat for him: if he then grant not, he is to be accounted cruel. If the
offended party be dead before, let the offender bring ten men to his grave,
and say before them, I have sinned against GOD and thus man, and let
restitution be made to his heirs. Prayer Deuteronomy.11.1.
must be used every day. Therefore they of the great Synagogue, Ezra,
Zerubabel, and the rest, ordained eighteen blessings, and other prayers, to be
said with every Sacrifice. They ordained these Rites of Prayer; the eyes cast
down to the ground; the feet set together; the hands on the heart, in fear
and trembling, as a servant speaks to his Master: a place where is no dung,
especially of an Ass and a Hen: a window in the room, which looks toward
Jerusalem, turning his body that way. He which is blind, let him direct his
heart to his Father, which is in Heaven. The Sentence, Hear Israel, etc. and
another Sentence is Deuteronomy.6.9.
to be written on the posts of the House. He which has his Phylacteries on his
head and arms, and his knots on his garment, and his Schedule on his door, is
so fenced, that he cannot easily sin. Every Israelite is bound to write for
himself a Book of the Deuteronomy.31.12.
Law. Sanctify the Sabbath, i. Remember those things on the Sabbath which make
to the honor and holiness of that day. And we are persuaded, that Satan and
the Devils, on the Sabbath, fly unto dark Mountains, abhorring the holiness
of the day: and after it is past, return to hurt the children of men. He which
is twenty years old, and marries not, breaks the Precept of Increasing and
Multiplying: except it be for contemplation and study of the Law. But if he
feel in himself Iezer, Lust, to prevail, he must marry, least he fall into
transgression. So let it be done to him which will not build his brothers
house. He which will eat the flesh of Beast or Birds, must kill them after the
due manner. Nor may any be allowed to be a Butcher, except he know our Rites.
When the Judges dissent in any case, Exodus.13.
the greater part is to be followed. When Sentence is past, Execution must
follow the same day: and the Crier must go before, proclaiming the Crime and
Penalty, with circumstances of Time, Place, and Witnesses. If any can say any
thing for his innocence, he may cause him to be carried back to the Judges:
if he be led again to death, he must have two Wisemen by to hear his words,
that if they see cause, he may be carried back to the Judges. If he yet be
found guilty, he must be led to the place of execution, and there slain by
two Witnesses. But before his death, let them exhort him to say, Let my death
be unto me for the remission of all my sins. After this Confession let them
give him a cup of Wine, with a grain of Frankincense, to drink, that he may
be deprived of the use of reason, and made drunk, and so slain. Honor thy
Father and Mother. R. Simeon says, That the Scripture more esteems the
honor of Parents then of GOD: for we are bidden honor GOD with our
substance; but for thy Parents, if thou have nothing, thou ought to labor
in the Mill to succor them. At this time we can sanctify nothing, because we
have no Temple. I might add diverse other things of like moment, which (to
avoid prolixitie) I omit: and for the same cause I let pass many things which
I might hither bring out of the same Author S. Munster. Euang. Matthew. cum
Annotat.
in his notes upon Matthew, by him set forth in Hebrew and Latin; where he
both relates and refuteth diverse of the Jewish vanities; especially their
blasphemous cauils against CHRIST.


Such is that their foolerie (by him Annotat. in Matthew. 15.
recited) in Matthew. 15. Annotat. about their scrupulous niceties in their
Festiuals: They may not then take Fish; Geese and Hens they may: When one
makes fire, and sets on the Pot, he must order the sticks so under it,
that it may not resemble a Building. No more then shall be spent that day, may
then be made ready. No Cheese may then be made, nor herbs cut. Heat water to
wash thy feet; not so for thy whole body. Touch not (much less may thou
eat) an egg laid on a festival day: yea, if it be doubtful whether it were
then laid, and if it be mixed with others, all are prohibited. But he which
kills a Hen, and finds Eggs in the belly, may eat them. According to
the number of the three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, they expect a
third Temple, after those two already perished; In Matthew. 22.

Of the second, ISAAC went to meditate in the Field: Of the third, The glory of
this last House shall be greater then of the first, etc. Fit Jewish handling of
the Scriptures. But I have been so plentiful of their barrenness, that I
fear to ouer-lade, or ouer-loath, the Reader.

has likewise written several small Treatises of the Faith of the Christians,
and of the Faith of the Jews, and of the Jewish Cauils against our Religion,
and of diverse fabulous fictions which they have devised in disgrace thereof:
they, that will, may in them further see their blindness. For what greater
blindness then to think, that their Messiah was borne that day the Temple was
destroyed, and to remain at Rome till that time, when he shall say to the
Pope, Let my People go, as Moses, borne so long before, at last said to
Pharaoh? That he shall be anointed by Elias? That he shall destroy Rome? That
Elias shall re-vnite the Soul to the Body in the Resurrection, which shall be
of all the just, but not of all the wicked; not in the same body, but another
created like to the former? which Resurrection shall be effected by Messiahs
prayer: That the Temple at Jerusalem shall be the very middle of the world?
That in the Messiahs days Wheat shall grow without renewing by Seed, as the
Vine? But of these and the like more then enough in this Book following.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of the Jewish Ceremonies about the birth of a Child: of their Circumcision,
Purification, and Redemption of the firstborn, and Education of their
Children.

WHen a Jewish woman Buxdorf. Syn. lud. c.2.
is great with child, and near her time, her chamber is furnished with
necessaries; and then some holy and devout man (if any such may be had) with
chalk makes a circular line round in the chamber upon all the walls, and
writes on the door, and within, and without on every wall, and about the bed
in Hebrew Letters, Adam. Chaua, Chuts Lilis, i. Adam, Eve away hence Lilis.
Hereby they signify their desire, that if the woman shall be delivered of a
son, GOD may one day give him a wife like to Eve, and not to Lilis: if it be
a daughter, that she may once prove to her husband a helper like Eve, and not
a shrew, like Lilis. This word Lilis is Isa.34.14.
read in the Prophet, interpreted a Skrich-owle: but the Jews seem to mean
by it a deuilish Spectrum, in woman's shape, that uses to slay or carry away
children, which are on the eight day to be circumcised. Thus is it read in Ben
Sira, of the Jewish Edition: When GOD had made Adam, and saw it was not good
for him to be alone, he made him a woman of the Earth, like unto him, and
called her Lilis. These disagreed for superiority, not suffering Lucan.l.b.1.
, Caesar ve priorem. Pompeinsve paerem: Lilis (made of the same mould) would
not be underling, and Adam would not endure her his equal. Lilis seeing no
hope of agreement, uttered that sacred word IEHOVA, with the Cabalisticall
interpretation thereof, and presently did fly into the Air. Adam plaining his
case, GOD sent three Angels after her, viz. Senoi, Sensenoi, Sanmangeleph
either to bring her back, or denounce unto her, That a hundred of her children
should die in a day. These ouertooke her over the troublesome Sea (where one
day the Egyptians should be drowned) and did their message to her: she
refusing to obey, they threatened her drowning: but she besought them to let
her alone, because she was created to vex and kill children on the eight day,
if they were men; if women children, on the twentieth day. They nevertheless
forcing her to go, Lilis swear to them, That, whenever she should find the
name or figure of those Angels written or painted on Schedule, Parchment, or
any thing, she would do infants no harm, and that she would not refuse that
punishment, to loose a hundred children in a day. And accordingly a hundred of
her children, or young Devils, died in a day. And for this cause do they write
these names on a Scroll of Parchment, and hang them on their infants necks.
Thus far Ben Sira.

In their Chambers always is found such a Picture; and the names of the Angels
of Health (this office they ascribe to them) are written over the chamber door.
In their Book Brandsp.
Brandspregel, printed at Cracouia, 1597, is showed the authority of this
History, collected by their Wisemen out of those words; Gen.1.27.
Male and female created he them compared with the forming of Eve of a Ribbe in
the next Chapter, saying, That Lilis the former was divorced from Adam for her
pride, which she conceived, because she was made of earth, as well as he; and
GOD gave him another, Flesh of his flesh.

When this Iewesse is in travel, she must not send for a Christian Midwife,
except no Jewish can be gotten: and then the Jewish women must be very thick
about her for fear of negligence or injury. And if she be happily delivered
of a son, there is exceeding joy through all the house, and the father
presently makes festival provision against the Circumcision on the eight day.
In the mean time ten persons are invited, neither more nor fewer, which are
all past thirteen years of age. The night after her delivery, seven of the
invited parties, and some others sometimes, meet at the Child-house, and make
there great cheer and sport all night, Dicing, Drinking, Fabling, so to solace
the mother, that she should not gricue too much for the child's Circumcision.
The Circumciser is called Mohel, who must be a Jew, and a Man, and well
exercised in that Faculty: and he that will perform this office, at the
beginning gives money to some poor Jew, to be admitted hereunto in his
children, that after his better experience he may be used of the richer. And
this Mohel may thence-forwards be known by his thumbes, on which he wears
the nails long and In arctam acuminatos ^^gues. Buxd.
sharp, and narrow-pointed. The circumcising Instrument is of Stone, Glass,
Iron, or any matter that will cut: commonly sharp knives like Rasors, amongst
the rich Jews closed in Silver, and set with stones. Before the infant be
circumcised, he must be washed and wrapped in clouts, that in the time of the
Circumcision he may lie clean: for otherwise they might use no prayers over
him. And if in the time of Circumcision (for pain) he defiles himself, the
Mohel must suspend his praying, till he be washed and laid clean again. This
is performed commonly in the morning, while the child is fasting, to prevent
much flux of blood.

In the morning therefore of the eight day all things are made ready. First
are two Seats placed, or one so framed, that two may sit in the same apart,
adorned costly with Carpets, and that either in the Synagogue, or some private
Parlour: if it be in the Synagogue, then the Seat is placed near the Holy
Arc, or Chest, where the Book of the Law is kept. Then comes the Surety or
Godfather for the child, and places himself at the said Seat, and near him
the Mohel, or Circumciser. Other Jews follow them, one of which cries with a
loud voice, That they should bring presently whatsoever is needful for this
business. Then come other children, whereof one brings a great Torch, in
which are lighted twelve Waxe-Candles, to represent the twelve Tribes of
Israel: after him two other boys, carrying cups full of Red wine. After them
another carries the circumcising knife: another brings a dish with sand;
another brings another dish with oil; in which are clean and fine clouts,
which after the Mohel applies to the wounds of the child. These stand in a
Ring about the Mohel, the better to mark and learn: and these their offices
are bought with money by those children. Some come thither also with Spices,
Cloves, Cinnamon, strong Wine to refresh, if any happen to swowne. These being
thus assembled, the Godfather sits down upon one of those two Seats: right
against him the Mohel places himself, and sings the Exodus.15.1.
Song of the Israelites, and other. Then the women bring the child to the door,
all the Congregation presently rising up. The Godfather goes to the door,
takes the child, sits down on his Seat, and cries out, Baruch habba.i.
Blessed be he that comes; in their Cabalisticall sense, habba being applied
either to the eight day, which is the day of Circumcision, or to the coming of
Elias, whom they call the Angel of the Covenant (so they interpret Mal.3.1.
the Prophet) and say, that Elias comes with the infant, and sits down on
that other empty Seat. For when the Israelites were prohibited Circumcision,
and Elias complained thus, 1. Reg.19.10.
The children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant. i. Circumcision, GOD
promised him, That from thence-forwards he should be present at Circumcision,
to see it rightly performed. And when they make ready that Seat for Elias,
then they are bound in set words to say, This Seat is for the Prophet Elias:
otherwise (as an unbidden guest) he comes not. This Seat remains for him
three whole days together.

Then when the Godfather holds the child in his lap, the Mohel takes him
out of his clouts, and lays hold on his member, and holding the fore-skinne,
puts back the top thereof, and rubbeth the fore-skinne, so to make it have the
less sense of pain. Then he takes from the boy the circumcising-knife, and
says with a loud voice; Blessed be thou, O GOD our LORD, King of the World,
which have sanctified us with thy Commandments, and given us the Covenant of
Circumcision: and whiles he thus speaks, cuts off the forepart of the
skin, that the head of the yard may be seen, and presently hurleth it into
the Sand-dish, and restores his knife to the boy again: takes from another a
cup of Red wine, and drinks his mouth full, which he presently spirteth out
on the infant, and there with washes away the blood; and if he see the child
begin to faint, he spitteth out some thereof on his face. Presently he takes
the member of the child in his mouth, and sucketh out the blood, to make it
stay from bleeding the sooner, and spitteth out that blood so sucked into the
other cup full of Wine, or into the dish of Sand. This he does at least
thrice. After the blood is stayed, the Mohel with his sharpe-pointed thin
nails rendeth the skin of the yard, and puts it back so far, that the
head thereof is bare. He is more painful to the infant, with this rending of
the remaining skin, which action is called Priah, then with the former. This
being done, he lays the clouts (dipped in oil aforesaid) to the wound, and
binds them three or four times about; and then wrappeth up the infant again
in his clouts. Then says the father of the child; Blessed be thou, O GOD our
LORD, King of the World, which have sanctified us in thy Commandments, and
have commanded us to succeed into the Covenant of our Father Abraham. To which
all the Congregation answers, As this infant has happily succeeded into the
Covenant of our Father Abraham; so happily shall he succeed into the
possession of the Law of Moses, into Marriage also, and other good works. Then
does the Mohel wash his bloody mouth and his hands. The Godfather rises with
him, and stands ouer-against him; who taking the other cup of Wine, says a
certain prayer, and prays also over the infant, saying; O our GOD, GOD of
our Fathers, strengthen and keep this infant to his Father and Mother, and
make that his name, in the people of Israel may be named (here he first names
the Child, calling him Isaac) Isaac, which was the son of Abraham. Let his
Father rejoice in him that has come out of his loins; let his mother rejoice
in the fruit of her womb, as it is written, Pr^. 23.25.
Make glad thy Father and Mother, and her that bare thee to rejoice. And GOD
says by his Prophet, Ezech. 16.6.
I passed by thee, and saw thee trodden in thy blood, and I said unto thee, in
thy blood thou shall live, yea I said unto thee, in thy blood thou shall live.
Here the Mohel puts his finger into the other cup of Wine, wherein he had set
the blood, and moisteneth the child's lips three times with that Wine, hoping,
that according to the former sentence of the Prophet, he shall live longer in
the blood of his Circumcision, then otherwise he should. David also says, Ps.
105.8.
He is mindful of his marvelous acts which he has done, and of his wonders,
and the judgments of his mouth, etc. Then he continues his Prayer for the
present assembly, and that GOD would give long life to the father and mother
of the boy, and bless the child. This done, he offers the blessed Cup to all
the young men, and bids them drink. Then with the child (who is thus made a
Jew) they return to the fathers house, and restore him to his mothers arms.
This last prayer he makes near the Arc, and some of the deuouter Jews,
before and after Circumcision, take the Child, and lay him upon Elias pillow,
that Elias may touch him. Glos. Talmud.
The skin cast into the sand, is in memory of that promise, Genesis 32.12.
I will make thy seed as the sand of the Sea; and of Balams saying, Number. 23.10.
Who can number the dust of Jacob, i. his posterity, whose fore-skinne is cast
in the Sand or Dust, and because the Curse Genesis 3.14.
on the Serpent is thus fulfilled, Dust thou shall eat, i. this skin in the
dust: thus to their enemy the Serpent fulfilling also that Precept, Prou.
25.21.
If thine enemy bunger, feed him. And by this means the Serpent can no more
seduce this man.

If a child be sick on the eight day, they defer Circumcision till his
recovery: if he die before the eight day, he is circumcised at the grave
without any prayers: but a sign is erected in memory of him, that GOD may
have mercy upon him, and raise him at the day of the resurrection. In some
places all the people stand, except the Godfather, because it is written, All
the people stood in the Covenant. But to pursue the rest of their niceties,
grounded upon such interpretations, would be endless. We will follow the child
home, if you be not already weary, and see what rout is there kept.

Ten must be the number (you have heard) of the invited guests, and one or two
of these learned Rabbis, who must make a long prayer and sermon at the table,
although others mean while are more busied in tossing the cups of wine. I
was once present (says Cap.2.page.94.
Buxdorflus) at one of their Circumcision-feasts, and one of their Rabbis
preached on Prou. 3. 18. Wisdom is a tree of life; but more wooden or
ridiculous stuff I never heard in all my life. This feast they observe by
example of Abraham, who Gen.21.3.
made a great seast when the child was weaned: their kabal peruerts it, when he
was circumcised. The Circumciser abides some tune with the mother, lest the
blood should again issue from the child. The mother keeps within, six weeks,
whether it be a male or female: all which time her husband must not so much as
touch her, or eat meat in the same dish with her.

If a female child be borne, there is small solemnity; only at six weeks
age, some young wenches stand about the cradle, and lift it up with the child in
it, and name it; she which stands at the head, being God-mother: and after this
they iunket together.

When the forty days are accomplished, before the wife may accompany or have
any fellowship with her husband, she must be purified in cold water, and put on
white and clean garments. Their washing is with great scrupulosity, in a
common watering or in private cesternes, or fountains; which must be so deep,
that they must stand up to the neck in water: and if it be muddy in the
bottom, they must have a square stone to stand on, that their whole feet may
stand in clear water, and that the water may pass betwixt their toes: for the
least part not covered with water, would frustrate the whole action: and for
this cause they lay aside al their haire-laces, neck-laces, rings: they diue
under the water, so that no part may be free from the same. Some Iewesse must
stand by for witness hereof, which is twelve years old and a day at least.

The redeeming of the firstborn.
They redeem their firstborn in this sort; when the child is one and thirty
days old, his father sends for the Priest with other friends, and sets the
child on a table before him; adding so much money, or monies-worth as amou^teth
to two florens of gold, or two dolars and a half: my wife (says he) has
brought me forth my firstborn, and the Law bids me give him to thee. Do
thou then give me him? says the Priest: he answers, yea. The Priest asks
the mother, if she ever before had a child, or abortion? if she answer No:
then the Priest asks the father, Whether the child or the money be dearer to
him? he answers, the child: then does the Priest take the money and lay it on
the head of the Infant, saying: This is a first begotten child, which GOD
commanded should be redeemed, and now, says he to the child, thou art in my
power, but thy parents desire to redeem thee; now this money shall be given to
the Priest for thy redemption: and if I have redeemed thee, as is right, thou
shall be redeemed: if not, yet thou being redeemed according to the Law and
custom of the Jews, shall grow up to the fear of GOD, to marriage and good
works, Amen. If the father die, before the child be one and thirty days old,
the mother hangs a scroll about his neck, wherein is written, This is the
firstborn, and not redeemed: and this child when he comes of age must
redeem himself.

The Jewish Chachamim, or wisemen, have left no part of life unprovided of
their superstitious care: as we have seen concerning the birth and
circumcision of their children, with the purification of the mother, and
redemption of the firstborn. To proceed with them: they enjoin the mother,
while she gives suck, to eat wholesome food of easy digestion, that the
Infant may suck good milk; so that the heart and stomach be not stopped, but
may come so much more easily to obtain wisdom and virtue. For God has great
care of children, and has therefore given a woman two breasts, and placed them
next her heart; yea in the dangerous persecution under Pharaoh, Exo. 1. he In
the book Medrasch.
caused the earth to open it self, and receive their male children, and
created therein two stones, from one of which the Infant sucked milk, and from
the other honey, till they were grown, and might go to their parents: yea, and
if you believe their Gemara (can you choose?) a poor Jew having buried his
wife, and not able to hire a nurse for his child, had his own breast;
miraculously filled with milk, and became nurse himself. Yea, Mardochaeus
(says their Medrasch) sucked the breasts of Hester, and for this cause did
she, after her exaltation, so prefer him. The conclusion is, if she give
gross food to her Infants, she shall be cast into hell. She must not go naked
breasted, nor too long fasting in a morning, nor carry her Infants, or suffer
them to go or be naked, lest Psalm.121.6.
the Sun hurt them, if it be in the day, or the Moon in the night: and that
they may soon learn that the earth is filled with the majesty of divine
glory: and for this cause must they beware, that they never go bare-headed:
for this were a sign of impudency, and ill disposition. And as religiously
they must provide, that they be always girded with a girdle: for the girdle
distinguishes betwixt the heart and the priuities; and in his morning prayer
he says, Blessed be thou. O GOD, which girdest Israel with the girdle of
strength: which, if he should not have a girdle on, would be in vain. Their
mothers therefore sow their girdles to their coats: with great care they avoid
going barefoot, especially in January and February.

When they can speak, they are taught sentences out of Scripture, and to
salute their parents with good morrow, good-Sabbath, etc. and after seven
years they add the name of GOD, GOD give you good morrow, etc. but they must
not name the name of GOD but in a pure place. These teach them the names of
things in the vulgar, and some Hebrew names among, that so they may not
commonly be understood: for pure Hebrew they cannot speak, except their most
learned Rabbines only. Their children must not converse with children of
Christians, and their parents make all things in Christians odious to them,
that they may season them from their childhood with hatred of them. When they
are seven years old they learn to write and read: and when they can read,
they learn to construe the text of Moses in their vulgar tongue. When the
mother carries him first to the school to the Rabbi, she makes him cakes
seasoned with honey and sugar, and as this cake, so (says she) let the Law be
sweet to thy heart. Speak not vain trifling words in the school, but only
the words of GOD. For if they so do, then the glorious Majesty of GOD
dwells in them, and delights it self with the air of their breath. For
their breathing is yet holy, not yet polluted with sin: neither is he Filius
manda^orum.
bar-mitzuah, bound to obey the Commandments, till he be thirteen years old.

When he is ten years old, and has now some smattering in Moses he proceeds
to learn the Talmud: at thirteen years, his father calls ten Jews, and
testifies in their presence, that this his son is now of just age, and has
been brought up in their manners and customs, their daily manner of praying
and blessing, and he will not further stand charged with the sins of his
son, who is now bar-mitzuah, and must himself bear this burden.

Then in their presence he thanketh GOD, that he has discharged him from the
punishment of his son, desiring, that his son by divine grace may be long
safe, and endeavor to good works. At the fifteenth year of their life, they
are compelled to learn their Gemara, or the complement of their Talmud,
disputations and subtle decisions about the text of their Talmud. And in these
they spend the greatest part of their lives, seldom reading any of the
Prophets, and some not in the whole space of a long life reading one Prophet
through, and therefore know so little of the Messiah.

At eighteen years their male children marry, according to their
Talmud-constitution, and sometimes sooner, to avoid fornication. Their maidens
may marry, when they are twelve years old and a day. At twenty years they
may traffike, buy, sell, and circumuent all they can: for their neighbor in
the Law, is (in their sense) such a Jew as you have heard described.

CHAP. XV.
Of their Morning Prayer, with their Fringes, Philacteries, and other
Ceremonies thereof.

THe good-wife is to waken her husband, and the parents to awaken their
children, when after thirteen years they are subject to the Jewish Precepts:
before their Pentecost, they rise before it is light, and after, the nights
being shorter, when it is now day. They are to awaken the day, not to tarry
till it awaken them. For their Morning-praier must be made whiles the Sun is
rising, and not later: for then is the time of hearing, as they interpret
Lament. 2.19. And he which is devout ought at that time to be sad for
Jerusalem, and to pray every morning for the reedifying of the Temple, and
City: if in the nightime any sheddeth tears for their long captivity, GOD
will hear his prayer, for then the Stars and Planets mourn with him: and if
he suffer the tears to trickle down his cheeks, GOD will arise and gather
them into his bottle, and if any decree be by their enemies enacted against
them, with those tears he will blot out the same. Witness David, Psalm.56.9.
Put my tears in thy bottle, are they not in thy book? And if any rub his
forehead with his tears, it is good to blot out certain sins that are there
written. In the beginning of the night, GOD causes all the gates of heaven to
be shut, and the Angels stay at them in silence, and sends evil spirits into
the world, which hurt all they meet: but after midnight, they are commanded to
open the same. This command and call is heard of the cocks, and therefore they
clap their wings and crow, to awaken men: and then the evil spirits lose their
power of hurting: and in this respect the Wisemen have ordained them a
thanksgiving to be said at cock-crowing. Blessed art thou O GOD, LORD of the
whole world, who have given understanding to the cock.

They must not rise up in their beds naked, nor put on their shirts sitting,
but put their heads and arms into the same as they lie, lest the walls and
beams should see their nakedness. It is a brag of Rabbi Iose, that, in all his
life, he had not herein faulted. But to go or stand naked in the chamber, were
more then piacular: and much more, to make water standing naked before his bed,
although it be night. He must not put on his garments wrong: nor his left shoe
before the right, and yet he must put off the left-foot shoe first, When he is
clothed, with his head inclined to the earth, and a devout mind (in
remembrance of the destruction of the Temple) he goes out of the chamber,
with his head, feet, and all covered, because of the holy Schechinam (Divine
glory) over his head. Then he goes to stool in some privy place; for so
has Amos commanded, Amos 4.^.2.
Prepare thy self (O Israel) to meet thy GOD: and David; Psalm.103.1.
All that is within me praise his holy name: that is, all within the body
empty and clean: For else must not GOD be named; and therefore his garments
must not be spotted and fouled. To restrain nature too long, were a sin, and
would cause the soul to stink: and (saving your reverence) he must wipe with
the left hand, for with the right he writes the name of GOD, and the Angels.
And in this place and business he must take heed, he think not of God or his
Word; much less name him, for God will shorren the days of such a one. R.
Sira told his scholars, that the cause of his long life was, that in an impure
place he never thought of the Word, nor named the name of God. Besides, he must
turn his face, and not his hinder-parts toward the Temple of Jerusalem. He
ought not to touch his body with unwashed hands, in regard of the evil spirits
which rest thereon til they be washed, and if he should touch his eyes he
would be blind, his ears deaf, his nose dropping, his mouth stinking, his
hand scabbed with these unwashed, and therefore venomous hands: and when he
washes he must power water three times on his right hand, and as often on the
left, before one hand may touch the other: he must not be sparing in his water,
for store of water, store of wealth: after the hands, the mouth and face must
be washed, because they were created after the Image of GOD: and how should the
name of GOD be uttered out of a foul mouth? he must wash over a basen, not
over the ground: he must dry his face very well, for fear of wheales and
wrinckles: and that with a clean towell, not with his shirt, for this would
make them blockish and forgetful. After all this follows his Brachah, or
blessing, Blessed be thou, O God, our God, King of the whole world, who have
commanded us to wash our hands. Their hands they must always wash on these
occasions: in the morning; at their return from the stool; from bathing; when
they have cut their nails; have scratched their naked body; have pulled off
their shoes with their hands; have touched a dead body; have gone amongst the
dead; have co^panied with their wives, or have killed a louse, If he respect
washing after these, if he be learned, he shall forget his learning; if
unlearned, he shall lose his sense.

have a foure-cornered garment, which some put on with the rest, when they
rise; others then, when they will pray. The foure-cornered parts thereof are
made of linen or silk, tied together with two winding-bands, of such length
that they may draw through their head betwixt them, so that those two
quadrangular pieces may hang down, one on his breast, the other on his back. In
every of these 4. corners hangs a labell, made of white woollen threads, by a
little knot, downwards to the ground, and the same is four, or eight, or
twelve fingers broad. These labels they call Zizis. Those which are devout
wear this garment every day, under a long outward coat, in such sort that
those labels may appear out a little, so that they may always see them, as
monitories of the Commandments of God. When they put them on, they praise God
that has commanded them to wear these Zizis. He (say they) that keeps duly
this Number.15.38. Fringes and Philacteries.
precept of Zizis, does as much as if he kept the whole Law: for there are in
all five knots, compared to the five books of Moses: eight threads added to
them, make thirteen. And the word Zizis, makes six hundred, all together
amounting to six hundred and thirteen, the number (as you have heard) of Gods
Comma^dements. They ascribe the continency of Joseph in Potiphars house; and
of Boaz, when Ruth slept by him, to these Zizis. May it please your patience, a
story out of the Talmud. One Rab. Iochanan saw a box full of jewels, which one
of his scholars, Bar-Emorai purposed to steal, but was forbidden by a voice
sou^ding out of the air, let it alone Bar-Emorai, for it belongs to R.
Chaninas wife, which in the other world, shall put into the same violet wool,
to make thread for Zizis, that of them, the just men there may have their
fringed garments sowed. Once, he which wears this garment without
intermission, is fortified against the Devil, and all evil spirits.

Besides this memorable Vestiment, they wear a certain knot near their nose,
out of Deuteronomy. 6.8. they shall be frontlets between thine eyes. Of their
Tephillim.
They make it thus. They take a little black foure-square calfe-skin, which
they fold eight times, that it may have four double folds and distinct
breadths. They put into these, distinct Scriptures, the same being fourfold
of parchment. These Scriptures are taken The fourteen first verses in Exodus.13.
and 4.5.6.7.8.9 of Deuteronomy.6. Pagn.
out of Exodus.13. and Deuteronomy. 6. Then take they hairs out of a cow or calves
tail, and wash them clean, and bind them about those writings of Scripture,
so that any one may see, that they are good by the ends of them appearing out
of the skin. This skin they sow with clean and fine strings, taken out of
calves or kines bodies, or made of bulls sinews, or if such strings cannot be
had, with strings of calue-skin-parchment. Then do they sow a long and black
thong to that thick hide or skin, and knit a knot about it. This piece of work
they call Tephillims, to put them in mind of often prayer: and tie it so about
their heads, that the thick knot, wherein the Scriptures are, may hang betwixt
the eyes. After this, they take another foure-cornered skin, which they fold as
the former, and write certain verses out of Exodus in parchment, and put it
into a little hollowed skin, and sow it upon the thick folded skin; to which
they add a long thong, and call it the Tephillim of the hand. This they tie to
the bare skin, above the elbow of the left arm; that so that which is written
may be over against the heart, which may hereby be the more enflamed to prayer.
That long string is so fastened that it comes to the forepart of the hand,
thus fulfilling that commandent, Deuteronomy.6.6.8.
The words which I command thee this day, shall be on thine heart, and thou
shall tie them for a sign in thy hand. They tie on first this Tephillim of the
hand, and then that of the head, and make their brachah or prayer, saying,
Blessed be thou, O God, our Lord, who have sanctified us in thy commandments,
and have commanded us to put on Tephillim; looking while he speaks,
diligently on the knot on his forehead. In folding, sowing, knitting, and tying
them, they very subtly frame the name of GOD Schaddai: Other their manifold
Ceremonies about these Tephillim, I willingly omit. Their sanctity is such,
that he which wears them must be pure within and without: and if he lets them
fall on the ground, all that shall see them so lying, must fast with him one
whole day: they must not be hanged up bare, but in a bag; nor may they be left
in a chamber, where a man and his wife lie together, except in triple chest or
bag. A man must not sleep while he has them on, nor may he break wind; and
if he have list to the stool, he must lay them four else from the place of
his easement, or lay them against his heart in a double bag. Their women
servants, and sick folks are free from wearing them. It is sufficient for
women to say Amen to their prayers. And all this Moses learned in Mount Sinai.

We have been tedious in furnishing our Jew to his Mattins; at Sunrising is
their hour, as you have heard: but their Rabbis have enlarged and lengthened
that time to about nine of the clock. Where many of the Jews live together,
they resort at a set hour to their Synagogue. Thither they must go
cheerfully: before their Synagogue they have an iron fastened, to make clean
their shoes, according to Salomons counsel, Eccles.4.17.
Keep thy foot when thou go into the house of GOD. He that has Pantofles,
must put them off, as it is written, Exodus.3.5.
For the place where thou stand is holy ground. At the entrance in at the
door, he pronounces some things out of David's Psalms: they must enter with
fear and trembling, considering whose presence it is; and for a while suspend
their praying for the better attention. And every Jew must cast in a halfpeny
at least into the Treasury, as it is written; I will see thy face in
righteousness, that is, in alines, as they interpret it. In this attention they
bow themselves toward the Arc, in which is the Book of the Law, and say,
Number.24 5.
How fair are thy tents, O Jacob? and thy dwellings O Israel? And Psalm.5.7.
I will enter into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, I will bow down
in thy holy Temple in thy fear. And, Psalm.26.8.
O LORD I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place of the
tabernacle of thy glory: and diverse other verses out of the Psalm. After these
things they begin to pray, as is contained in their Common-praier-booke: and
because these prayers are very many, therefore they run them over: he that
cannot read, must attend, and say Amen, to all their prayers. These prayers
are in Hebrew rimes. Their first prayer is, The LORD of the World, which
reigned before any thing was created, at that time, when according to his will
they were created, was called KING, and then when all shall be brought again
into nothing, shall remain KING, to whom shall be given fear and honor. He
always has been, is, and shall remain in his beauty for ever. He is One, and
besides him there is none other, which may be compared or associated to him,
without beginning and end; with him is rule and strength. He is my GOD and my
deliverer which lives. He is my Rock in my need, and time of my trouble, my
Banner, my Refuge, my Hereditary portion, in that day, when I implore his
help. Into his hands. I commend my spirit. Whether I wake or sleep, he is
with me, therefore I will not be afraid.

This done, they say then their hundredth Grounded on Deuteronomy.10.12. Now Israel

benedictions one after another, which are short, and twice a day repeated.
First for the washing of their hands, that if he then forgot it, he might now
in the Congregation recite it. Then for the creation of man, and for that he
was made full of holes, whereof, if one should be stopped he should die: then, a
confession of the resurrection: then for understanding, given to the cock (as
you have heard) to discern day and night asunder, and with his crowing to
awaken them; and in order, Blessed, etc. That he has made me an Israelite or
Jew. Blessed, etc. That he has not made me a servant. Blessed, etc. That he
has not made me a woman (The women here say, that he has made me according
to his will) Blessed, etc. That exalts the lowly. Blessed, etc. That makes
the blind to see; which they should say at their first wakening. Blessed, etc.
That raises the crooked; at his rising. Blessed, etc. That clotheth the naked;
at his apparelling. Blessed, etc. That raises up them that fall. Blessed, etc.
That brings the prisoners out of prison. Blessed, etc. That stretches the
world upon the waters; when he sets his feet on the ground. Blessed, etc.
That prepares and orders the goings of man; when he goes out of his
chamber. Blessed etc. That has created all things necessary to life; when he
puts on his shoes. Blessed, etc. That girdeth Israel with strength; his
girdle. Blessed. etc. That crowns Israel with co^lines; when he puts on his
hat. Blessed, etc. That gives strength to the weary. Blessed be thou GOD our
LORD, KING of the World, who take sleep from mine eyes, and slumber from
mine eyelids. Then add they two prayers to be preserved against sins, evil
spirits, and men, and all evil After this, humbling themselves before GOD,
they confess their sins, and again comfort themselves in the covenant made to
Abraham, We are thy people, and the children of thy covenant, etc. O happy we!
how good is our portion? how sweet is our lot? how fair is our heritage? Oh
happy we, who every morning and evening may say, Hear Israel, The Lord our
Lord is one God. Gather us that hope in thee from the four ends of all the
earth, that all the inhabitants of the earth may know that thou art our GOD,
etc. Our FATHER which art in heaven, be merciful unto us for thy names sake,
which is called upon us: and confirm in us that which is written, Zephan.3.20.
At that time will I bring you, and gather you, and make you for a name and
praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall turn your captiuities,
says the Lord.

Then follow two short prayers for the Law given them. And then they go onto
the Sacrifices, which, because they cannot execute in actio^ out of the Temple,
they redeem with words, reading the precepts concerning Sacrifices, according
to their times, comforting themselves with the saying of Hose, Hos.14.3.
We will sacrifice the calves of our lips. Then repeat they a history of
sacrifice, and a prayer of the use of the Law, and how many ways it may be
expounded. This done, they (with a still voice that none can hear) pray for
the reedifying of the Temple, in these words; Let thy will be before thy face,
O God our Lord, Lord of our Fathers, that the holy house of thy Temple may be
restored to our days, and grant us thy will in thy Law. After, rising with
great joy and clamor, they sing a prayer of praise in hope hereof: and sitting
down again, they read a long prayer, gathered here and there out of the
Psalms: and some whole Psalms, and part of 1. Chron. 30. and lastly, the last
words of Obadia Ohad.verse.21.
The Saviors shall ascend into mount Sion, to judge the mount of Esau, and the
kingdom shall be the Lords. Which they speak in hope of the destruction of
the Christians, whom they call Edomites, and of their own restitution. (In
some of their close writings, which they will not suffer to come into the hands
of Christians, they say that the soul of Edom entered into the body of CHRIST,
and that both he and we are no better then Esau.) They proceed Munster,
praecept.Mos.cum expos. Rab.
singing, And GOD shall be king over all the earth: in that day GOD shall be
one, and his name one, as it is written in thy Law, O GOD, Hear Israel, GOD
our GOD is one GOD: And these words in their next prayer they repeat,
resounding that last word Echad.
One, by the half or whole hour together, looking up to heaven: and when they
come to the last letter thereof, Daleth, d, they all turn their heads to the
four corners and winds of the world, signifying that God is King of the whole
world: having in the word echad many superstitious subtilties; that the letter
Daleth in regard of his place in the Alphabet, signifies 4. and the word echad
245. whereunto adding hael elohechem emes, God your Lord is true, they make up
the number of 348. and so many members there are in man's body: for every
member, a prayer secures them all. And this verse thrice recited, secureth
against the ill spirit. They They may not say it within four cubits of a
grave; nor in sight of an unclean place, where dung or urine is, except they be
hardened and dried up, or else covered. They must not stir their eyes or
fingers: It is a preservative against Devils. Munster.
esteem it a holy prayer, by which, miracles may be wrought, and therefore use
it morning and evening. They have another prayer called Schmoneesre, that is,
eighteen, because it contains so many thankesgiuings, which they say twice a
day, and the chief chanter of the Synagogue sings it twice by himself. They
think by this prayer to obtain remission of their sins. They must pray it
standing so, that one foot must not stand more on the ground then the other,
like the Angel, Ezekiel.1.7.
and their foot was aright foot. When they come to those words in it, holy,
holy, holy, Lord God of hosts; they leap up three times aloft. And he (say
their Chachamim) which speaks a word during this prayer, shall have burning
coals given him to eat after his death. These 18. tha^ksgiuings are for the
18. bones in the chine or backbone, which must in saying hereof be be^ded.

After this follows a prayer against the Jews revolted to Christianity, and
against all Christians, saying; These which are blotted out (that is,
reuolters) shall have no more hope and all unbelievers shall perish in the
twinkling of an eye, and all, thine enemies which hate thee O GOD shall be
destroyed, and the proud and presumptuous kingdom shall quickly be rooted
out, broken, laid even with the ground, and at last shall utterly perish, and
thou shall make them presently in our days obedient to us. Blessed art thou
GOD which breakest and subduest them which are rebellious. They call the
Turkish Empire the kingdom of Ismael; the Roman, Edomiticall, proud, etc.
After this follows a prayer for the good sort, for proselytes, reedifying of
the Temple, for sending the Messiah, and restoration of their kingdom. In the
end they pray GOD to keep them in peace, and when they come to these words,
he that makes peace above, shall make peace over all Israel, Amen ^^ they go
back three paces, bow themselves downwards, bend their head on the right
hand, then on the left (if some Christian be there with an image, they must not
bow out lift up their heart) This they do for honors sake, not to turn
their hinder parts on the Arc: and thus they go (like crabbes) out of the
Synagogue, using certain prayers; not running, but with a flow pace, least
they should seem glad, that their mattins were done.

Other their niceties in praying, as laying the right hand on the left over the
heart; not spetting not breaking wind up or down; not (interrupted by a King)
to cease prayer; to shake his body this way and that way; not to touch his
naked body; and to say Amen, with all his heart: for they that say Amen, are
worthy to say it in the world to come. And therefore David ends a Psalm with
Amen, Amen: signifying, that one is to be said here, and the other in the
other world. Psalm.72.19.


CHAP. XVI.
Of their ceremonies at home, after their return, at their meals and
otherwise: and of their Evening Prayer.

THus have we seen the Jewish Mattins, which they chaunt (says another) Rela.
of Relig.in the West.
in a strange wild hallowing tune, imitating sometimes trumpets and one
ecchoing to the other, and winding up by degrees from a soft and silent
whispering, to the highest and loudest Notes, that their voices will bear,
with much variety of gesture: kneeling they use none, no more then do the
Graecians: they burn Lamps: but for show of Devotion or Elevation of spirit,
that yet in Jews could I never diseerne: for they are reverend in their
Synagogues, as Grammar boys are at school, when their Master is absent. In
sum, their holiness is the very outward work it self, being a
braine-lesse head, and a soulelesse-bodie. Meane-while, the good wife at home,
against her husbands return, sweepeth the house, that nothing may disturb his
holy cogitations, and lays him a book on the Table, either the Pentateuch of
Moses, or a book of manners, to read therein the space of an hour before he
goes out of the house about his business. This study is required of every
devout Jew, either in his own house, or else in their school or Synagogue,
And being thus come home, they lap up their Tephillim in a Chest, first that
of the head, then that of the hand.

They account it healthful also to eat somewhat in the morning before they
go to work: for whereas there are threescore and three diseases of the gall,
a bit of bread, or draught of Wine can cure them all. About eleven of clock
his wife has prepared his dinner, pure meats, purely dressed: but if she have
pullen or cattle, she must first feed them. For it is said, Deuteronomy.11.13
I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shall eat and be
satisfied: you see, the Cattle are first mentioned. And to keep such
Domestical cattle, is good in respect of the disastrous motions of the
planets, which must some way sort to effect. But if they be studious of alms
and good works, then Saphyra Rabba the great Chauncellor (some Angel)
according to his office, registreth the same, and commends them unto GOD
saying, Turn away that planetaire misfortune from such a one, for he has done
these and these good works. And then does it befall some wicked man, or else
some of the Cattle. Before they come to the Table they must make trial again
in the privy what they can do: for it is written, Lcu.26.10.
Thou shall carry out the old, because of the new. Especially let there be
clean water, wherein the household must first wash, then the wife, and lastly
the good man, who presently without touching or speaking ought else might more
purely give thanks. He (says R. Iose in the Talmud. tract.sotah.c.1.
Talmud) that eats with unwashed hands, is, as he that lies with an Harlot,
for it is written. Prou.6.26.
For the strange woman a man comes to a morsel of bread. They must wash
before meat and after, so strictly, that they may not keep on a Ring on their
finger, for fear of some uncleanness remaining under it. I had rather (says
R. Akiba) die for thirst, then neglect this washing tradition of the Elders:
when he had only so much water brought him into prison, as might serve him but
to one use of washing or drinking, at his own choice.

On the Table cleanely spread, must be set a whole loaf well baked, and the
salt, and then the householder or the chiefest Rabbi at Table takes the loaf
into his hands, and in the cleanest and best baked part thereof, makes a cut
into it, and then setting it down and spreading his hands on it, says Blessed
art thou LORD GOD, King of the world, who bring bread out of the earth: and
then breaks off that piece of bread which he had cut before, and dipping it
into the Salt or broth, eats it, without speaking a word (for if he speak
he must say over his grace again:) After this, he takes the Loaf, and
cutteth for the rest. Then he takes a cup of Wine (if they have any) with
both hands, and with the right hand holds it up a handful higher then the
table, and locking steadfastly on the cup says, Blessed etc. who have made the
fruit of the Vine. Over water they pronounce no blessing: and if there be not
three at least at the Table, each man must bless for himself: if three or
more, the rest say, Amen. Salt is religiously set on in remembrance of the
sacrifices. If when they cut, they should cut off the piece of bread, it would
offend GOD. Both hands they spread over the Loaf in memory of the ten
Commandments, which GOD has published concerning Wheat, of which bread is
made. The bread must be had in special honor, no vessel supported with it,
or set upon it: and a Robin-good-fellow, or the spirit of the buttery among the
Jews.
spirit called Nabel gives attendance, as deputed to observe such as (through
negligence) tread it under foot, and to bring them into poverty: and another
man (dogged by this spirit, which sought to bring him to poverty) eating
victuals one day on the Grass in the field, the spirit hoped to effect his
purpose: but this devout Jew, after he had eaten, pared away the grass, and
threw it with the crummes scattered into it, into the Sea for the fishes, and
presently heard a voice, saying, woe is me fool, who have attended to punish
this man, and cannot have occasion. They dream that Elias and every man's
proper Angel attends at Table, to hear what is said, if they talk of the
Law: otherwise an ill Angel comes and causes bralles and diseases: and in
respect of these spiritual attendants, they cast not their bones beside or
behind them. They are curious not to eat flesh and fish together: but first
flesh, and then scour their teeth from the flesh, and eat a bit of bread, and
drink a draught of drink, before they eat the fish. They must not use the
same knife to meats made of milk, which they used in eating flesh. Milk must
not stand on the Table with flesh, nor touch it.

Besides the 23. Psalm set before them in the meal time, they testify their
devotion by multitudes of new graces or thanksgiuings, if any better Wine or
dainties be set before them, yea besides the particulars of their cates, even
for every good sent, as of Oil, Roses, Spices, etc. and are of opinion, that
to use any thing without thanksgiving is to usurp and Steal it. Let this be
spoken to the shame of many profane Esaus with us, that will rather sell Gods
blessings for their meat, then seek them to their meat: although in them the
payment of these by tale, and not by weight is no better then a
beadsuperstition. They make a religion of leaving some leauings of their bread
on the table: but to leave a knife there were dangerous, ever since that a Jew
once in the rehearsing that part of their grace after meat, which concerns
the reedifying of Jerusalem in a deep agony took his knife so left, and
thrust into his heart. This their grace is long containing a commemoration of
the benefits vouchsafed their forefathers, and a prayer for regranting the
same: to send Elias, and the Messiah: and that they may not be brought to beg
or borrow of the Christians: and for his blessing upon all of that house, etc.
Whereunto is answered with a loud voice, Amen: and they say to themselves:
Psalm.39.10.11.
Fear the LORD ye his Saints, for they that fear him have no want: the Lions
lack and suffer hunger, but they which seek the LORD shall want nothing that
is good: and while this is said, there must not a crum me left in their
mouths. The prayers must be in that place where they have eaten: or else they
shall loose the benefit of burial: and a certain devout Jew in the field,
remembering that he had forgotten his grace, returned back to the house, and
there performing his duty, had miraculously sent unto him a dove of gold.

In Cities where are Synagogues, about five in the afternoon their Scholae
^uls^^tor among the Jews, is as our Sexten.
Clearke (or some such officer) goes about and with knocking at their doors
gives them notice of evening prayer. Thither being come, they sit down and
say this prayer (of the first word, called Aschre.) Psalm 8 44. and 144.15. and
145.5.
Blessed are they which dwell in thy house praising thee continually, Selah.
Blessed are the people that are thus, blessed are the people whose GOD is the
LORD. I will magnify thee O GOD my King, etc. all that 145. Psalm throughout:
he which says this Psalm thrice a day shall have his portion in eternal
life. Then the chief Chorister or Chaunter, sings half their prayer called
Kaddesch: and then all say those eighteen praises mentioned in Morning Prayer.
Then goes their Chorister out of his pulpit, and kneeleth down upon the steps
before the Arc, and falls down with his face on his left hand (all the
people doing likewise) saying, O merciful and gracious GOD, I have sinned in
thy sight, but thou art full of mercy: be merciful unto me, and receive my
prayer proceeding from an humble heart. Reprove me not O LORD in thy wrath, nor
correct me in thine anger, and so proceeds through that whole sixth Psalm:
his countenance covered and inclined to the ground. This is done in imitation
Josh.7.6.
of Joshua. Then the Praecentor or chief Chorister, again rising up says,
And we know not what to do, but that we direct our eyes unto thee. And then
they say up the other half of their Kaddesch: and so ends their euensong.

Now should they go home, and after supper return to perform their Night
devotions: but because a full belly would rather be at rest, and might easily
forget this duty, after some pause and stay, they proceed before they go to
their other taskes and in that time of pausing between their vespers and
nocturnes, if there be any strife between any, and reconciliation cannot be
made, then he which cannot reconcile his neighbor, goes to the common
prayer-booke, and shutting it, knocks thereon with his hand, saying any
kelao, I conclude the business; as if he should say, I conclude praying till
mine Adversary be reconciled to me: until which thing be effected they may
not pray further: and so sometimes their prayers are intermitted then and
diverse days together, if one party will be stubborn. These prayers are for
substance much like the former: as against the Christians, and for their own
restitution by their Messiah. They depart out of the Synagogue with repetition
of those sentences mentioned in the former Chapter.

At supper they behave themselves as at dinner. Going to bed they put off the
left shoe before the right: their shirt they put off, when they are covered in
their beds for fear of the walls beholding their nakedness. He that makes
water naked in his chamber, shall be a poor man: and the prayer Deuteronomy.6.4.
Hear Israel, must be his last words on his bed, and sleeping on the same, as
in Psalm.4.5. speak in your heart on your bed, and be silent: Selah. If he
cannot by and by sleep, he must repeat it till he can: and so his sleep shall
prove good to him. The bed must be pure: for how else should they think on the
name of GOD? And it must be so placed, that they must lie with their heads to
the South, their feet toward the North, for by this means they shall be
fruitful in male children. They have also their Chamber-Morals, instructing of
duties betwixt the man and wife, unmeet for sober and chaste ears. It Is time
for our pen to sleep with them, and end this Chapter.

CHAP. XVII.
Their weekly observation of Times. Viz. Their Mundayes and Thursdayes, and
Sabbath.

HItherto have we heard of their prayers every day observed. They have also
their times designed to the reading of the Law. In the Tract.Babba Kama.c.7.
Talmud is reported, that Ezra in the Babylonian captivity was Author unto the
jews of ten Commandments. First, that on the Sabbath; Secondly on Monday and
Thursday, with singular solemnity, some part of the Law should be read:
Thirdly, that Thursday should be Court or law-day for deciding controversies:
Fourthly, that it should be a day of washing, sweeping, and cleansing in honor
of the Sabbath: Fifthly, that men should then eat Leekes: the sixth, seventh,
eight and ninth are of women's baking, clothing, combing, bartering: the last is
of cleansing after unclean issues. Their learned men confirm this institution
of Ezra, by authority of Scripture, Exodus.15.22.
They went three days in the desert and found no waters. By waters they
understand the Law. For so it is said Esaias 55.1. Come ye to the waters: that
is, to the Law: and therefore they ought not to let three days pass without
some solemn reading of the Law. Monday, and Thursday are chosen to be the
days, because on Thursday Moses went the second time into the Mount, and
returned with the two Tables on the Monday.

This their devotion is as ancient, as that Pharisee Luke 18. I fast twice in
the week; that The deuouter Jews fast every Monday and Thursday.
which the most devout amongst them do to this day observe. These two days
are generally half holy days. Assembling early in their Synagogues, besides
their ordinary prayers they annexe many other. Among others they use one
Prayer called Vehurachum, of miraculous effect, as appeared in Vespasians time,
who committing three ships full of Jews, without Oar or Mariner to the wide
Seas, which arrived in three several regions, Louanda, Arlado, Burdeli, (work
for Geographers) Those which arrived in this last Port, by tyrannical Edict of
the King, were to be tried whether they were true Jews, as Hananias, Misael,
and Azarias made proof of their Religion. Whereupon three days being required
(as they said Nabucadnezar had granted them) wherein to betake themselves to
fasting and prayer: in this time of respite three devout Jews, Joseph,
Benjamin, and Samuel, invented each of them a prayer which they joined into
one, and continued in praying, the same three days, at the end whereof they
cast themselves into the fire, and there continued till it was consumed. Hence
arose this ordinance, every Monday and Thursday to use the same prayer, which
is this; And he is merciful, and pardoning finne does not destroy the sinner.
He often turns his anger from us, and does not kindle all his wrath. Thou, O
my GOD, suffer me not to want thy mercy: let thy gentleness and truth keep me
always. Help us O GOD, our GOD, and gather us from the Gentiles etc. for their
Restitution as in other their prayers and destruction of their enemies, the
Christians. After this they prostrate themselves on their faces (as before)
with many other orisons to the like effect.

Their solemn ceremony of the Lawe-lecture follows, In The manner of the
LaweLectur^.
all their Synagogues, they have the five books of Moses written in great
letters, on parchments of Calues-skinnes sowed together in length, which at
both ends are fastened to pieces of wood, by which the book may be lifted and
carried. This book is kept in an Arc or Chest set in some wall of the
Synagogue. Before the door of the Arc is a hanging of Tapestrie, more or
less precious according to the quality of their Feasts, and for the most part
wrought with bird-worke. The book is wrapped in a linen cloth, wrought with
Hebrew words: without that, is hanged about some other cloth of Linen, Silk,
Velvet or gold, to which is fastened a plate of silver by a chain of gold,
upon which is written, the crown of the Law or holiness of the LORD. Then
goes one about crying who will buy The folding of the wood of Life.
Gelilab etz chaijm. This is an office whereby they are authorized to handle
those pieces of wood and to open the book of the Law. He which gives most
for it, has it: the money is reserved for the poor. The pieces of wood are
called etz chaijm, tree of life, according to Prou.3.18.
Solomon. Wisdom is a tree of Life to them that lay hold thereon. When the
Pracentor.
chief chanter has taken out the book, and goes with it into the pulpit,
they all sing out of Number. 10.35. Arise O LORD, and let thine enemies be
scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee: and out of Esaias 2.3.
Many people shall go and say, come, let us ascend to the mount of the LORD, to
the house of the GOD of Jacob, and he shall teach us his ways, and we will
walk in his paths. for the Law shall go out of Sion, and the word of the LORD
from Jerusalem. When this Praecentor lays the book on his arm, he says,
Psalm.34.4.
Magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together: to which all
the people answer, Exalt ye the LORD our GOD Psalm.99.9.
, and bow before his footestoole for it is holy: Exalt ye the LORD our GOD and
bow to the mountain of his holiness, for Ichouah our GOD is holy: There,
upon a Table covered with silk he lays down the book: and he which has
bought the office, takes from it the clothes, wherein it is wrapped. Then
these two call some one of the Congregation by his own and his fathers name,
who comes forth and kisseth the book, not on the bare parchment (for that
were a sin) but on the clothes which cover it: and taking it by those pieces
of wood, says aloude, Praise the LORD etc. Blessed be thou O LORD, who have
chosen us before any other people, and given us thy Law. Blessed be thou O GOD
the Lawe-giuer. Then the Praecentor reads a Chapter out of the book: and
then he which was called forth, with like kissing and blessing returns. Then
another is called forth and does likewise. After him another, who had need be
of strong arms: for he lifts up and carries this book, that all may see
it, all crying, This is the Law which Moses gave to the Israelites. This
office is called Hagba^a^, and is sold as the former. The women meane-while
contend amongst themselves in this Synagogue by some lattice to have a sight of
the Law. For the women have a Synagogue apart severed with lattices, so,
besides their pretense of modesty, to fulfill the saying of Zachary,
Zach.12.2.
The family of David shall mourn apart, and their wives apart etc. If he
which carries the book should stumble or fall, it were Ominous and should
portend much evil. These two officers fould up the book as before: and then
come all and kiss the same: and then is it carried to his place with singing.
After this they end their prayers as at other times: saying, LORD lead me in
thy righteousness, because of mine enemies, direct thy way before me: and, The
LORD keep my going out and coming in from henceforth for ever. Which they also
say when they go forth on a journey or to work.

They prepare themselves to the observation of their Sabbath, by diligent
provision on the Friday before night of the best meats well dressed;
especially the women provide them good Cakes. They honor the Sabbath with
three bankets: first, on the Friday night when their Sabbath begins, another
on the Sabbath day at noone: the third before sunset. Exodus.16.25.
Eat ye it to day, to day is the Sabbath of the LORD, to day ye shall not find
it (Manna) in the field: do you not see to day thrice mentioned, and therefore
by Moses own ordaining, that manna must so often be eaten on the Sabbath? The
richest Jews and most learned Rabbines, disdain not some or other office, as
chopping of herbs, kindling the fire or somewhat toward this preparation. The
table remains covered all that night and day. They wash, and if need be,
shave their heads on the Friday, and very religiously cut their nails,
beginning with the fourth finger of the left hand, and next with the second,
then with the fifth, thence to the third, and last to the thumme, still leaping
over one: In the right hand they begin with the second finger, and after
proceed to the fourth and so forth. These parings if they tread under foot,
it is a great sin: but he which burieth them is a just man, or which burns
them. Now must they also whet their knives and put on their
Sabbath-holy-day-raiment to salute Malchah the Queen: so they term the
Sabbath. The Clarke goes about and gives warning of the Sabbath: and when the
sun is now ready to set, the women light their Sabbath-Lampes in their dining
rooms, and stretching out their hands toward it, say over a blessing: If they
cannot see the sun, they take warning by the hens flying to roost. The cause
why the women now and at other feasts light the lamps, is Magistrally
determined by the Orach. chaym.cap.2.
Rabbines, because that Eve caused her husband to sin, yea with a cudgel
belabored him, and compelled him to eat, which they gather out of his words,
Gen.3.12.
the woman gave me of the Tree, (to wit a sound rib-rosting) and I did eat.
Now after they had eaten, the sun, which before shined, as it shall do in
the other life, diminished his light, And for dimming that light, she lightens
this. And for three causes (you shall believe their Talmud Desab.c.21.
) women die in travel; for forgetting their dough wherewith to make Cakes with
Oil, Exodus 25. for neglecting their terms; and not lighting the Sabbath
lamps: which their Cabalists gather out of the threeletters of the name of
Eve, or Chauah. These lights are two or more, according to the condition of the
room.

They begin their Sabbath thus soon, and end it also later, then the just
time, in commiseration of the purgatory-soules, which begin and end with them
this Sabbaths-rest, being the whole week besides tormented in that fire. Judas
himself, in honor of the Christian Sabbath, from Saturday Euensong obtained
like privilege: witness S. Brandon in the legend (can you refuse him?) who
found him cooling himself in the Sea, sitting upon a stone which he had
sometime removed out of a place, where it was needelesse, into the highway.
(So meritorious even in Judas is any the least good work.) Like to this is the
story of Turnus, and R.Akiba in the Ta'mud. Tract.sanbed.c.7.
There did Judas acquaint Brandon with this Sunday-refreshing of the hellish
prisoners and desired his holy company to scarre away the devils, when they
should after Sunday euensong come to fetch him again, which for that time
Brandon granted, and performed.

The Jews will not quite empty any place of water, that on the Sabbath these
fiery souls may find where to cool them. Two Angels attend them home from
the Synagogue, one good, and the other evil, which if they find all things
well, that is, Iewishly prepared for the Sabbaths honor, the good Angel says
it shall be so the next Sabbath, and the evil Angel (will he, nill he)
answers, Amen. If otherwise, the good Angel is forced to say Amen to the
evil Angels denunciation of the contrary. They feast it with much ceremony,
pronouncing their blessing on the wine: with looking on the lamp to repair
that fiftieth part of their eyesight, which they say in the week time
ordinarily is wasted: they cover the bread mean while, that it should not see
the shame thereof, in that the Wine is blessed, for the Sabbaths use, before
it. This good cheer on the Sabbath is of such consequence, that for this cause
in their De Sab.c.16.
Talmud is reported, that a Butcher in Cyprus, which still reserved his best
meats for the Sabbath, grew by divine reward so rich, that his table and all
his table, furniture were of Gold. You may receive with like credit the Legend
of Joseph following, who buying continually the best Fish, to honor the
Sabbath with it, found in the belly of one of these Sabbath-fishes a hat-band
of Pearls, worth no less then a Kingdom. The table remains spread till the
next night. The Lamps must not be put out, nor the light thereof applied to
the killing of fleas, to reading or writing, etc. The good man must honor that
night with more kindness to his wife, then on other nights: therefore eat they
Leekes before: therefore they marry on the Sabbath: and the children, then
conceived, must needs be wise and fortunate. If a Jew travel, and on Friday
evening be further from his home, then a Sabbath-dayes-iourney, he must there
abide, be it in the midst of a Wood or Wilderness, till the Sabbath be past.
They sleep longer on the Sabbath morning; so with their greater pleasure to
honor it. They then use more prayers in their Synagogues: and read seven
Lectures of the Law. They now also read the Prophets. They stay here till
noone and no longer, least by longer fasting and praying they should break the
Prophetical commandment, Esaias 58.13
Thou shall call my Sabbath a delight. After dinner also they read in their
Law: For Minhagim. Page.13.
on a time, The Sabbath and the Law put up their complaints to GOD for want of
a companion and learner, and the Israelites were given as a companion to the
Sabbath, and on the Sabbath a learner of the Law. But for all this they talk
not more busily all the week through of Vsuries, buying and selling, then on
their Sabbath. Their Euensong they have soon done, that they might return,
and while the day yet lasts, make an end of their third banquet, by which
they are secured against hell and against Gog and Magog: They conclude it with
blessings and singings, till it be late, to prolong the return of the souls
into Hell: for presently after they have ended, there is proclamation through
Hell, to recall them to their dungeons. In these Songs they call upon Elias to
come; so justly are they deluded, who scoffingly imputed unto Matthew.27.47.
CHRIST the calling of Elias. But their Elias being busy, (as he sometime said
of Ahabs Baal) and not coming, then they request him to come the next Sabbath.
But he (it seems) is loath to leave his place under the tree of life in
Paradise; where he stands (say they) enrolling their good works in the
keeping of the Sabbath. When this their devotion is done, the women in haste
run to draw water, because the Fountain of Miriam Number. 20. flowing into the
Sea of Tiberias, does from thence empty it self in the end of the Sabbath
into all Fountains, and is very medicinable. After this do the Jews make a
division between the Sabbath and the new week. The Householder lights a
great Candle, called the Candle of Distinction: at whose light he vieweth his
walls, This holy wine they sprinkle about their houses and themselves, as
effectual against diseases and devils.
blesses a cup of Wine, and a little silver box full of sweet spices,
powers a little of the Wine on the ground, and applies the box to every ones
nose to smell to, thus to remedy the stink which is caused at the new opening
of hell for the return of the souls: or else to keep them from swowning at the
departure of one of their souls. For they are of opinion, that themselves have
a superfluous sabbatharie soul, which on that day is plentifully sent in to
them, to enlarge their heart, and to expel care and sorrow. Antonius Margarita
affirms, that they dream of three souls in each man, besides the
sabbatharie soul, two of which leave him in his sleep, one mounting to
Heaven, where in learneth things to come; the other called brutish,
contemplating sin and vanity. The viewing of their nails at the candle, is
in remembrance of Adams nakedness, all saving where the nails covered his
fingers and toes ends. The Wine they power on the ground, to refresh Corah and
his accomplices under the ground.

For their Sabbath-workes they are determined Rabbinically: a horse may have a
halter, or a bridle to lead, but not a saddle to lade him: and he that leads
him, must not let it hang so loose, that it may seem he rather carries it,
then leads the horse: A hen may not wear her hose sowed about her leg, but
this mark must on friday be taken off. And if any cattle fall into a pit, yet
may they not help it out on the Sabbath: so spitefully have their Talmudicall
Rabbines endeavored to make (where they could not find) a falsehood in the
Math.12.11
words of CHRIST, testifying the contrary. But from the beginning it was not
thus. The Jew may not milk his cattle, not eat of the milk when he has
procured a Christian to milk them, except he first buy it, but at his own
price. A Tailor may not wear a needle sticking on his garment. The lame may
use a staff: the blind may not. Clogges or Pattens to keep them out of the
dirt they may not burden themselves with. It is lawful to carry a plaster on
their sores, but if it fall off, they may not lay it on again: Nor may they
bind up a wound anew; nor carry money in their purses or garments: nor rub
their durty shoes against the ground, though they may wipe it off against a
wall: nor wipe their hands, fouled with dirt, on a towell, but with a cowes or
horse-taile they may do it. If a flea bite, he may remove, but not kill it: a
lowse he may. But their doctors disagree in this lousy question: for R.
Eliezer says, One may as well kill a Camel. He must take heed of leaving
more corn to fowls that day then they shall eat, if it be in an open place,
lest it may there grow, and he be said to sow corn on the Sabbath. To whistle
a tune with his mouth, or play it on an instrument, is unlawful: as also to
knock with the ring or hammer of a door, and therefore the Clarke knockes with
his hand when he calls them to the Synagogue. To knock on a Table to still
a child; to draw a Letter in dust or ashes, or a moistened Table, is unlawful;
in the air not so. Of these Sabbath-labours they have nine and thirty chief
Articles: whereto the smaller (as these) are referred, with much ridiculous
nicetie, as the first article is of tilling ground, wherein is reserved
digging, filling up ditches, etc. and to this, going over a fallow, rubbing his
durty shoe on the ground etc. It Is time this ditch be now filled, and we
proceed further.

CHAP. XVIII.
The Jewish Passover, as they now observe it, and other their Feasts and Fasts.

OF the Jewish Feasts, as they were celebrated before the coming of CHRIST,
we have already spoken. In these days they blindely and stubbornely persist
in like Observation of times, though with some variation of ceremony. Their
Talmud reckons four New-yeeres days, besides the former in March and
September, whereof we have spoken; the first of August begins their year of
breeding cattle, accompting from thence their time of tything. In January,
the first, or as R. Hillel would have it, the fifteenth began their new year
for trees, in reckoning the time of lawfulness to eat, or tithe their fruit.

The Their order of celebrating the Passover at this day.
richer Jews prepare thirty days before for their Passe-ouer, ( dentem, non
mentem) good wheat for their unleavened cakes. The Sabbath before the Passeuer
is solemn and sacred, wherein they have a Sermon concerning the Paschall
Lamb. Two or three days before the Passover, they scowre their household
implements, of wood and metal, with much curiosity and variety of rites.
For he that in this Feast uses an impure vessel, is as he that has lain
by an unclean woman. The night before the Feast, the goodman of the house with
a wax candle, a dish and wing, begins his search for leauened bread; and
with other men or boys to help him, after their Amen to his blessing, with
wax candles in their hands, they leave not a mouse-hole unsearched, and hide
that bread which they mean to eat that night, left they should find that,
and be forced to burn it. That which they find, they curiously cover, left
some mouse, by carrying it, should make them hauenew work: and for this cause
suppe also in a corner, with great care that nothing fall to the ground. When
he has ended his search, Whatsoever leaven (says he) is under mine hands,
which I have not seen, let it be tossed to and fro, like the dust of the
earth. In the morning they make their unleavened cakes, of meal growned three
days at least. The kneading trough must be lined with linen, lest some of the
leauened meal should cleave thereto. The goodman himself must draw the
liquor that it is kneaded with, and that at Sun setting. The cakes are made
with as much scruple, round, and pricked full of holes in a cold place etc. to
keep them from leaueuing. They eat little, and the firstborn nothing, till
night, that then they may have the better Paschall-stomacke: at the Euensong
they observe much-what the same ceremonies, as at the Sabbath. They make at
home the fairest show of their plate and riches, and seat themselves on
Chaires (as it were) of State, and account now of themselves as great Lords,
triumphing over their late Egyptian servitude; at their return from the
Synagogue, they have a dish with three cakes set before them, representing the
high Priest, the Tribe of Leui, and the people of Israel: an other dish has in
it a loine of lamb or kidde, with a hard egg: an other contains a
gallimawfrey of apples, nuts, figs, almonds, etc. dressed with wine in
bricke-fashion (with cinnamon strewed on it, in remembrance of the Egyptian
furnace. They have also a sallet of herbs, and a sawcer of vinegar set on the
Table. Then sit they down, and every one (to the child in the cradle) has his
cup filled with wine. And here with a carowse after a blessing begins the
feast, with a scrupulous use of these things mentioned: then follows. The
supper it self, with much riot till midnight, with such cheer as they have,
with diverse ceremonies, cursing their enemies, calling for Elias, praying for
the reedifying of the Temple; using many, Divine Attributes, as Merciful God,
great God, bountiful God, high God, fair God, sweet God, mighty God, and God
of thIewes now build thy Temple shortly, very soon, very soon, in our days,
very soon, very soon. Now build, now build, now build, now build, now build
thy Temple quickly; Strong God, lining God, etc. over and over with such
battologies. This night they think themselves secure against men and Devils;
they leave their doors open all night to entertain Elias; and one to their
solace plays Elias in a white linen garment. Each man drinks four Cups
full of the blessed wine, in regard of four deliverances, which the Rabbis
find in Exodus, 6. V. 6, 7. The ceremonies of Moses they are not tied to
(forsooth) because they are not in Canaan.

In the morning they visit the Synagogue with their Sabbath-rites. They bring
two Books out of the Arc, and call forth five men (and if this feast be on
the Sabbath, seven) to read out of the same. Nice are their determinations
what works they may do on this day, and what not: they may dress no more
meat then is this day eaten. If they beat spice, the mortar must lie
side-wise, for distinctions sake of the day, etc. fasting and weeping must be
avoided; if any farse a hen, the needle must be threeded the day before, and
the thread must be burned, not bitten, or broken asunder. In such trifles, the
School of Schammai licenceth to eat the same day an egg laid on a festival
day. Hillel denies it, and betwixt them they have set the Rabbines by the
cares, in this and such profane questions. Their Euensong has a short
dispatch: and then the next day they Abundans cau^ela non n^cet.
reiterate the same ceremonies, and that for certainty, because they doubt of
the first day of the month, and therefore observe two. The four days
following are halfe-holy-dayes. Some works may be done in them, and not some,
and what they do (to make a difference) must be done otherwise, as writing
crooked etc. and that which cannot without loss be deferred, may now be done.
The seventh day they observe in more complcate holiness, and the eight too,
for the reason before alleged, to be more secure of the true day. After the
feast ended, they satisfy with fasting their feasting-riots, and that on two
mundaies and one thursday: unto the three and thirtieth day after, they are
sad and heavy, in remembrance of R. Akhiba, of whose disciples four and
twenty thousand died in that space, and were buried by women in the night: and
therefore after Sun set, all this while the women lay aside their work: on
the three and thirty day the men bathe them and shave their beards, and are
merry, because then his disciples ceased dying.

From the second night of their Pesach they number to their Pentecost Pentecost.
fifty days inclusiuely: and say, Blessed be thou, etc. which have commanded
us to number the days before harvest, of which this is the first or second,
etc. they number the same standing, praying withal for the restitution of
Jerusalem. They let not blood on the even of the Pentecost, because of a
supposed wind Tabbach, which should have slain all the Israelites, if they
had refused next day to accept of the Laws. They keep it two days, for the
former doubt. They take the Book twice out of the Arc, and read thereout the
precepts concerning this Feasts sacrifices, now that they cannot perform the
things. In remembrance of receiving the Law, they strew the pauement of their
houses, streets, and Synagogues with grass. They eat meats made of milk and
cakes. One cake they make seven times folded in thicknes, in remembrance of the
seven heavens, by which GOD descended to Mount Sinai. Now they must have good
cheer, because at this time the King married his daughter, that is, the Law
unto them.

The Tabernacles.
Feast of Tabernacles is observed eight days: the two first, and two The last
day they may kindle fire from another, not strike fire with stone or metal,
nor quench it, although to save their goods: nor blow it with bellows, but
with a reed they may: with many trifling obseruatio^s else mentioned by Munst.
Praecept. Mos. cum expos. Rab.
last more solemnly: the middle four are half holy. They mutter over their
prayers with such haste, that he is the perfectest who speaks most with a
breath. They make them Tabernacles with boughs of 4 kinds of trees (more
scrupulous then the Law) in which they suppe, but do not lodge. The Precentor
in the Synagogue takes a bundle of boughs, and blesses and shakes them; for
it is written, Psalm.96.12.
The trees shall clap their hands, and moves them 3 times to the East, and as
often to the West, and to the N. and S and then up and down like a Fencer, and
then shakes them again, as having now put the devil to flight. Then one
takes out the Book, and lays it on the Pulpit, which they all with their
boughs compass seven times a day, during the Feast; in hope of like
destruction to the Christians as befell Jericho, and then renew their shaking
of their boughs. The seventh day is most solemn: then they produce seven
Books, and in every of their seven compassings lay up one again. This night
they know their fortunes by the Moon: for stretching out their arms, if they
see not the shadow of their head by Moone-light, they must die that year; If a
finger wants, he loses a friend; if the shadow yield him not a hand, he
loses a son; the want of the left hand portendeth loss of a daughter; If no
shadow, no life shall abide with him, for it is written: Number.14.9.
Their shadow departed from them. Some Jews go yearly into Spain, to provide
pome-citrons and other necessaries, for the furnishing this feast: which they
sell in Germany, and other places to the Jews at excessive prices. They keep
their Tabernacles in all weathers, except a very vehement storm drive them
with a heavy countenance into their houses. Their wives and servants are not
so strictly tied hereto.

The New Moonday.
new Moons are at this day but half festival to the Jews, accounting
themselves free to work, or not, in them; but the women keep it entirely
festival, because they denied their Eare-rings to the molten Calfe, which
after they bestowed willingly on their Tabernacle. The deuouter Jews fast the
day before. Their Mattins is with more prayers, their dinner with more checre
then on other days: and a great part of the day after they sit at Cards, or
telling of Tales. That day when the Moon is eclipsed, they fast. When they may
first see the new Moon, they assemble, and the chief Rabbi pronounces a long
prayer, the rest saying after him.

The Jews believing that GOD created the world, in September or Tisri, conceit
also, that at the revolution of the same time yearly, he sits in
judgment, and out of the books takes reckoning of every man's life, and
pronounces sentence accordingly. That New-yeares day.
day which their great Sanhedrin ordained the New-yeeres festival, GOD
receiving thereof intelligence by his Angels, sent thither to know the same,
causes the same day a Senate of Angels to be assembled, as it is written,
Daniel 12. All things provided in the solemnest manner, the three Books are
opened; one, of the most wicked, who are presently registered into the Book of
Death: the second, of the just, who are enrolled into the Book of Life: and
the third, of the mean sort, whose judgment is demurred until the day of
Reconciliation, (the tenth of Tisri,) that if in the mean time they seriously
repent them so, that their good may exceed their evil, then are they entered
into the Book of life; if otherwise, they are recorded in the Black Bill of
Death. Their Scripture is produced by R. Aben. Psalm 69.28
Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Living, and not be written with
the just. Blotting points you to the Book of Death: Living, that of Life; and
not writing with the just, is the third Book of Indifferents. All the works
which a man has done through the year, are this day examined: The good works
are put in one balance, the bad in the other (what help a silver Chalice or
such heavy metal could afford in this case, you may find by experience in
Saint Francis Legend, who, when the badde deeds of a great man, lately dead,
out-weighed the good, at a dead lift caft in a silver Chalice, which the dead
party had sometime bestowed on Franciscan devotion, and weighed up the other
side, and so the Devils lost their prey:) GOD (say they) pronounces sentence
of punishment or reward, sometime in this life to be executed, sometime in the
other. In respect hereof, their Rabbines ordain the month before to be spent
in penance, and morning and evening to sound a Trumpet of a Rams horn, as an
Aue Mary-Bell, to warn them of this Judgment, that they may think of their
sins; and besides to befoole the Devil, that with this often sounding being
perplexed, he may not know when this New-yeares day shall be, to come into the
Court to give evidence against them. The day before they rise sooner in the
morning, to mutter over their prayers for remission: and when they have done in
the Synagogue, they go to the graves in the Churchyard, testifying, that if
GOD do not pardon them, they are like to the dead, and praying, that for the
good works of the Saints (the just Jews there buried) he will pity them,
and there they give large alms. Afternoon, they shave, adorn, and bathe
themselves, that they may be pure the next day; (for some Angels, soiled with
impuritie here below, are feign to purge themselves in the fiery brook Dinor,
before they can praise GOD; how much more they?) and in the Water they make
Confession of their sins; the Confession contains two and twenty words,
the number of their Alphabet; and at the pronouncing of every word, give a
knock on their breast; and then diue wholly under water. The Feast it self
they begin with a Cup of Wine, and New-yeere Salutations: and on their
Table have a Rams head, in remembrance of Gen.22.18.
That Ram which was offered in Isaacs stead: and for this cause are their
Trumpets of Rams horn: Fish they eat, to signify the multiplication of
their good works: they eat sweet fruits of all sorts, and make themselves
merry, as assured of forgiveness of their sins: and after meat, all of all
sorts, resort to some bridge, to hurl their sins into the water: as it is
written, Mich.7.19
He shall cast all our sins into the bottom of the Sea. And if they there
epsy any Fish, they leap for joy, these serving to them as the Scape-goate,
to carry away their sins. At night they renew their cheer, and end this
Feast.

From this day to the tenth day Reconciliation.
, is a time of Penance or Lent, wherein they fast and pray for the cause
aforesaid; and that if they have been written in the Book of Death, yet GOD
seeing their good works, may repent, and write them in the Life-Booke.
Hospinian ex Lombard^.
Thrice a day very early they confess three hours before day, and surcease
suites at Law, etc. And on the ninth day very early they resort to the
Synagogue; and at their return, every male takes a Cock, and every female
a Hen; if she be with child, both: and the Householder, saying out of the
hundred and fifth Psalm, verses 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and out of Job chapter
23. verse. 23, 24, 25. swingeth the Cock three times about his head, every
time saying, This Cock shall make an exchange for me: he shall die for me:
and I shall go into life with all the people of Israel, Amen. He does it
three times, for himself, for his children, for the strangers that are with
him. Then he kills him, and cutteth his throat, and hurleth him with all his
force to the ground, and roasteth him: signifying that he himself deserves
death, the sword, stoning, and fire: the inwards they hurl on the top of the
house, that the Crows may, with it, carry away their sins. A white Cock
for this purpose is principal; a red Cock they use not, for they are full
of sin themselves by Esaias authority, Esa.1.18.
If your sins were red as scarlet etc. Ant. Margar.
Antonius Margarita says, That this propitiatory creature should be an Ape,
as most like to a man; but they use a Cock for the names sake: a man in Hebrew
is Gehber, which is the Talmudicall or Babylonish name of a Cock. Thus those
that with a Rams horn beguiled the Devil, and with a Cock beguiled GOD,
justly beguiled themselves, who refuse that Sacrifice of CHRIST, in whose
stripes they might be healed.

After the performance of this Cocke-sacrifice, they go to the buriall-place,
using like ceremonies there, as on New-yeeres even: and after noone, bathe them
likewise. After Euensong, he which has offended others, asks them
forgiveness, which if he obtain not at first, then the offender takes with
him three other, and asks the second and third time: if all this be in
vain, he takes ten others and renews his suite; if he obtain, it is
well; if not, GOD will hold him excused, and the other party shall be
guilty; if the party offended be dead, the offender, with ten other goes
to the grave, and there confesses his faults. They confess one to an other
also, and that in a secret place of their Synagogue, where each receives
mutually at his fellows hand with a leather belt nine and thirty blows: at
each blow the party beaten beats himself on the breast, and says one word
of his Confession, taken out of the seventy and eight Psalm and eight and
thirtith Yet he being merciful etc.
verse, being in the Hebrew fifteen words, which he thrice repeateth: then
the striker lies down and receives like penance at the hands of the former,
you may judge with what rigor. This done, they run home, and make merry
with the Cocks and Hens before mentioned, supping largely, because of the
next days fast. Their supper must be ended before Sun set: for then
begins their fast. They put on their cleanest raiment, and over the same, a
great and large shirt down to the shoes, to testify their purity. They
resort to their Synagogues with wax candles (in Germany they have for every
man one) and then light them. The women also light Candles at home, as on the
Sabbath. It is ominous, if the Candles burn not clearly. They spread the
floor with Carpets, for soyling their purest clothes.

Their humiliations at this Feast are five: first, four and twenty, or seven
and twenty hours fast, whereunto children are subject: the males after twelve
years, the females after eleven. Their five humiliations at the Feast of
Reconciliatio^.
Secondly, they wear no shoes. Thirdly, they must not anoint them. Fourthly,
nor bathe them, no not put a finger into the water. Fistly, nor company with,
no not touch their wives. Before they begin prayers, thirteen of the
principal Rabbis, walking in the Temple, give license to all, both good and
bad, to pray. And the Praecentor or Reader fetches the Book out of the Arc,
and opens it, singing a long prayer, beginning all compacts, vows, and
oaths, etc. insinuating, that all the vows, promises, oaths, and covenants
which every Jew had that year broken, be disanulled and pardoned: and that,
because now all have power to pray and praise GOD. They continue singing till
late in the night. Some remain all night in the Synagogue: yea the deuouter
some stand upright singing and praying without intermission all that feast, the
space of seven and twenty hours in the same place. Those that departed the
Synagogue, return in the morning before day, and there stay all that day.
Often they prostrate themselves with their face covered, at every word of their
Confessions knocking their breast. When it begins to be night, the Priest
draws his Talles (a large cloth made of hairs) before his eyes, and
pronounces the blessing, Numb. 6. holding his hand toward the people, who
meane-while cover their faces with their hands: for they may not look on the
Priests hand, because the Spirit of God rests thereon. Then he sings a
prayer seven times together, sometimes higher, sometimes lower with his voice:
because that God now ascends from: them into the seventh Heaven: and they
with their sweet melody bring him on the way. Then they make a long and
shrill sound with their Rammes-horne-trumpet: and there follows presently a
voice from Heaven, Goecate thy bread with joy and gladness etc. After this
they return home, some carrying home their Lights, to distinguish the holy
Times (as you have heard) from the profane: some leave them in the Synagogue
all the year, at certain times lighting them. Some Saint-Iewes provide to
have a waxe-light continually burning all the year long in the Synagogue. In
their return they wish to each other a good year. For the Books, before
mentioned, are now closed; nor may they expect any alteration. They suppe
largely, and betimes the next morning return to the Synagogue, lest Satan
should complain at so soon a cooling of their zeal. But the Devil may be
quiet; for when the Law was given, Pirke.ca.46.
Sammael the evil spirit complained, that he had power over all people, but
the Israelites: God answered, That he should have power over them, if on the
Reconciliation-day he found any sin in them: But he finding them pure,
said, That this his people were like the Angels, living in unity, without
eating or drinking. The Jews have a ceremony to give the Devil gifts on this
day, either not to hinder them: or else, because Exodus.23.8
Gifts blind the wise.

The Jews divide the Law into two and fifty parts, and reading every Sabbath
one, the last falls on the next day after the Feast of Tabernacles, about the
three and twentieth day of September. In this The Feast of the Law finished,
day they leap, dance, and make much joy. They assemble in their Synagogue,
and take all the Books of the Law out of the Arc (leaving in it meane-while,
that it be not left empty, a burning light) they read the first Lecture and
the last thereof, and leap about the Arc with the Books; and they hurl
pears, nuttes, and such fruits among the youth, which in their scrambling
sometimes fall together by the ears, and mar the sport. On this day they
sell their Synagogue-offices, the Clarke making proclamation: who will give
most at the third time, obtains first the office of lighting the Lights all
the year, then that of providing the Wine, which they use to begin the
Feasts with, in respect of the poor, which have no wine to hallow at home.
Thirdly, Is set to sale the office Geldab, of foulding up, and unfolding the
Law. Fourthly, Hagbohah, of lifting up the Law, and carrying it in Procession.
Fifthly, The office Etz-chaim, of touching those turned pieces of wood, whereto
the Law is fastened: which the young men are forward to buy, in hope of
holiness and longer life. Sixthly, Acheron; to be called forth last on the
festival days, to read somewhat of the Law. Seventhly, Schetria, to be
deputed or substituted inplace of the negligent officer, etc. The money, hence
arising, is for the use of the poor, and reparations of their Synagogue: but
in these sale-offices, wealth has more honor then worthinesle.

Their Feast of Dedication, we cannot say much more of, then that which
already has been said: much niceness herein is observed, about the lights
where with they solemnize this darkness, which I willingly omit: these lights
they use in their houses all the space of these eight days burning.

Their Hospinianus cx M. Lombard.
Feast of Lots they keep with all riot two days, as with some at Shrouetide:
the men disguising themselves in women's habit; the women in men's: they quaffe
and drink (it is says Rabbi Isaac, Tirna, a good work) till they find no
difference between Arur Haman and Baruch Mordecai: curjed be Haman, Blessed
be Mordecai; vociferations that day observed.

They Hospin.
observe festival the Equinoctials and Solstices; and a certain Rogation day:
they use the Fasts before mentioned out of Zach. 7. with other superstitions.
Some of them Syn. Iud. Ruxdorf.
Fast also, as is said, on Mondayes and Thursdayes; and some on the tenth of
March for the death of Miriam: at whose departure, a certain fountain dried
up, and the people were left without water: but in this month the most Rabbis
will not allow fasting, because of their deliverance therein out of Egypt. Some
fast for the death of Samuel, April 28. and for the taking of the Arc, April
10. and at other times for other Prophets. Some fast on the new-moones even:
some, when they have had an unfortunate dream; and all that day in which their
father died, through their whole life. Their fasting is an abstinence from all
eating and drinking till night. But of these Fasts and other their solemnities,
is said before in the abstract of their Calendar, taken out of Joseph Scaliger.

CHAP. XIX.
Of their Ceremonies and opinions concerning the Dead.

IF we should lead you through their Kitchen, and there show you their two sorts
of vessels and implements; one for flesh, the other for whitmeats and fish: as
likewise they have two knives, for the same purpose, and (if it were possible)
would have two mouths; (that which they can) they make much cleansing
between: and if these vessels should be mingled, they must be broken, if they
be of earth; washed, if of wood; and purged by fire, if of iron: with other
their cookery-rites and ceremonies. If I should thence lead you to the
Shambles, and acquaint you with the curious qualifications of a Jewish Butcher:
Of which argument they have a book to instruct them: in more difficult
questions, they consult with the learned Rabbi; whose license the Butcher must
have for his slaughtering, before a Jew may eat of his meat. If in these
cases, and in other quiddities of marriages, of divorces, of marrying the wife
of the deceased brother, of women's uncleanness, of their provision for the
poor, of the penalties inflicted on offenders, etc. I should tire the Reader,
to whom I fear I have already bin over tedious. But in this matter of
Religion, of whom is it fitter to protract discourse, then of them, whom the
old world yielded the only example of Truth, and the present age, a principal
example of falsehood and superstition? Let it not grieve the Reader, to perform
the last office of humanity to our Jew, and as he has seen his birth, his
Synagogue-Rites, and home-superstitions, so to visit him on his deathbed and
help lay him in his grave: and examine his hope of the resurrection, and of
their Messiah, and we will end our pilgrimage in this Holy Land.

When Ceremonies about the sick.
a man lies sick, the Rabbines visit him; and if he be rich, order is taken
for his will, and then they exhort him to persevere constantly in their faith.
They ask him if he believe that the Messiah is yet to come. He makes his
confession on his bed, saying; I confess before thee my GOD and LORD, GOD of
my parents, LORD of all Creatures, that my health and death is in thy hand, I
pray thee grant me recovery of my former health, and hear my prayer, as thou
did hear Hezekiah in his sickness. And if the time of my death be come,
then grant that death may be my remission of all my sin, which of ignorance
or knowledge I have committed, ever since I was a man: grant that I may have my
part in Paradise, and the world to come, which is reserved for the just: grant
that I may know the way of everlasting life, fill me with the joy of thy
excellent countenance by thy right hand for ever. Blessed be thou O GOD which
hear my prayer.

Thus they which refuse the merits of CHRIST'S death, ascribe remission of
sins to their own. When he And about the dead in the house.
gives up the ghost, all the standers by rend their garments, but in a
certain place of the same, where they do no great harm, about a
hand-breadth. They lament the dead seven days. They presently after his death
power out all the water in the house into the street: they cover his face that
it may no more be seen: they bow his thumb in his hand, framing a
resemblance of the Hebrew name Schaddai: his other fingers are stretched out,
to testify a forsaking of the world: they wash him with hot water, and having
anointed his head with wine and the yolke of an egg mixed together, they put
on him a white vestment, which he used to wear on the Feast of
Reconciliation. When they carry him out of the house, they hurl after him a
broken sherd, signifying, that with him all heaviness should be expelled and
broken. When they are come to the place At the grave.
of burial, they say, Blessed be GOD, which has formed you with Judgment and
Justice, has created, fed, sustained, and at last has deprmed you of life
(speaking to the dead.) He knows the number of you all, and will quicken you
again in his time. Blessed be GOD, which does to die, and makes alive. Then
with some other Ceremony they commit the corpse to ground, his kinsmen putting
in the first earth. When After the burial.
they return, they throw grass over their heads, signifying their hope of the
Resurrection. In the Porch of the Synagogue, GOD Esaias 25.8.
shall destroy death for ever (say they) and wipe away all tears from their
eyes, and will take away their reproach from all the earth, for the LORD has
spoken it. Then enter they into the Synagogue, and leap up and down, and
change their Seats seven times, and there say over their Purgatory prayer
Kaddisch. The mourners go barefoot seven days, and eat not Flesh, nor drink
Wine, except on the Sabbaths and Festiuals. They bathe not in three and thirty
days after, cut not their nails, make a pitiful howling, etc. The first
night the mourner eats nothing of his own, but meat sent him from his
friends. The child mourns for his father a year. The son, eleven months,
says over his Kaddisch, for mean sinners are freed sooner: but the wicked
stay the whole twelve months: and therefore to persist the twelfth month in
his prayer, should be to acknowledge his father a wicked man. And for this
effect hereof, Rabbi Akibha met once in the way a man, with an Asse-like
burden of sticks, which upon examination confessed, That he was a
Purgatorie-ghost carrying, to burn himself, such bundles every day. Rabbi
Akibha enquired if he had a son or wife, and where; and finding out his
son, taught him this prayer, which was so effectual, that in a dream this
Ghost returned to the Rabbi with thanks, for his deliverance, and said he was
now in Began Eden, or Paradise. Rabbi Akibha signified this to the Jewish
Synagogues, with iniunction to teach their children this prayer.

Thus poor Purgatory with Jews and Romists is preached by walking ghosts.
They have a light burning for the dead seven days. They power the water out of
doors, because the Angel of Death washes his sword (lately used) in water,
and enuenometh it. This his sword he holds in his hand at the beds head,
having on the end thereof three drops of gall: The sick man spying this Deadly
angel, opens his mouth with fear, and then those drops fall in, of which
one kills him, the second makes him pale; the third rotteth, and putrifieth.

CHAP. XX.
The Jews faith and hope touching their Messiah.

THe Jews generally believe, hope, and pray for a Messiah; but such a one,
whose kingdom shall be of this world, and who shall (to use the Apostles
^^^^.1.6.
phrase, who were also, even after CHRIST'S death and resurrection, partakers of
this dream) restore the Kingdom to Israel. And because the Scripture speaks
somewhat of the poor, contemptible, and dejected state, of the promised
Messiah, sometimes of the puissance, renown, and glory of his kingdom: they
therefore frame to their conceits, two Messiahs, one poor and simple, but a
mighty warrior, whom they call Messiah Ben-Ioseph: the other, Messiah
Ben-Dauid; after the other in time, but before him in glory, and the true
Messiah: howsoever even this also be in their opinions but a mere man, and one
which shall marry and leave behind him a remaining and reigning posterity.

The ancient Jews looked for this Messiah to be sent them about this time,
when JESUS came in the flesh: as that Prophecy which is fathered on Elias
testifies, to wit, that the world should be 2000. years Tohu, empty and
without Law, 2000. under the Law, 2000. under the Messiah: and accordingly
CHRIST JESUS came into the world about the year after the Creation, 3963. The
Jews reckon 202. years fewer in all their computations, then the Christians.
Upon this occasion, and in regard of the general expectation of the Messiah,
about that time rose so many Sects and especially that rebellion of Ben-Cochab,
before spoken of, to whom R. Akibha (famous for his 24000. disciples) gave
testimony, and called him Messiah the King. But this Bencochab, the son of
the Star, Numb. 23. was by Adrian (as you have seen) besieged, taken, and
executed, and was called after ^
Ben-Cozabh, the son of lying. They therefore, when as they found no Messiah,
said, that the time was deferred, because of their sins: and after renounced
Anathema to him, that should set down the time of his coming. And being
convinced in their consciences, that the ^.
Prophecies of this time were already past and accomplished, they affirmed in
their writings, that he was then borne, but did not yet reveal himself,
because of their sins. R. Solomon Iarchi writes, that the ancient Jews
thought he was borne on that day in which Jerusalem was last destroyed; but
uncertain where he has lien hid. Some say that he abides in Paradise tied
by the hair of a woman's head: so interpreting that of the Canticles. The ^
hair of thy head is as purple, The King is tied in the rafters; by rafters
meaning Paradise. The Talmudists ^
write, that he lay at the gates of Rome among the Lazars and Leapers,
according to Esaias 53.

Before he comes, they write, that ten notable miracles shall happen to warn
them thereof. First, GOD shall raise up three Kings, which shall make
profession of shall there be no King in Israel (as it is Hosh.3.4.
written) no Pastors, no holy men. The heavens shall be shut up, the people
shall be made few: for these Tyrants, (which yet by divine dispensation shall
reign but three months) shall impose ten times as much, as was before
exacted, and they which have not to pay shall lose their heads. And from the
ends of the earth, shall come men, black and loathsome; the dread of whose
countenance shall kill men: for they shall have two heads and seven eyes,
sparkling like fire.

Malac.4.2.
Prophet.

Dan.12.3.
the inst, who shall shine, etc.

Hos.14.6.

The Joel2.31.
Sun shall be darkened thirty days, and then receive again his light,
whereby many shall embrace Iudaisme.

Esai. 49.16.) But after nine months GOD shall send Messiah Ben-Ioseph. of the
children of Joseph, whose name shall be Nehemias, the son of Husiel. He shall
come with the race of Ephraim, Manasse, Benjamin and Gad, and the Israelites
hearing of it, shall flock to him, as Jeremy shows, Ierem.5.14.
Convert ye to the LORD yerobellious children, I will take ye, one of a City,
and two of a Tribe, etc. This Messiah shall overthrow the Edomites, and slay
their King, and destroying the Empire, shall carry to Jerusalem holy vessels,
reserved in the house of Aelian for a treasure. The King of Egypt also shall
make peace with the Israelites, and shall kill the men about Jerusalem,
Damascus, and Ascalon; the fame whereof shall affright all the inhabitants of
the earth.

Armillus the wicked, the same which the Christians call Antichrist, of ten
else quantity of breadth and length; a span-breadth between his eyes, which
shall be red and deep in his head; his hair yellow, the soles of his feet
green, deformed with two heads. He shall profess himself the Roman Messiah
and GOD, and shall be accepted of them. He shall bid them bring him the law
which he has given them, which they shall bring with their prayer-booke: he
shall cause them to believe in him; and shall send ambassadors to Nehemias the
son of Husiel, and to the people of Israel, commanding them also to bring him
their Law, and to acknowledge him for GOD. Then shall Nehemias go unto
Armillus with three hundred thousand Ephramites, carrying with him the Book of
the Law; and when he comes at him, he shall read out of the same this
sentence, I am the LORD thy GOD, thou shall have none other gods in my sight.
Armillus shall reply, that there is no such sentence in their Law, and
therefore they should acknowledge him for GOD, as well as the Gentiles. Then
shall Nehemias overthrow two hundred thousand of Armillus his army; whereat
Armillus shall be so wrathful, that he shall assemble all his forces into a
deep valley, and there shall destroy (with many other Israelites) this
Nehemias. But the Angels shall take and hide him, that Armillus may not know of
his death, lest he should not leave one of Israel living. All Nations shall
then expel the Israelites, and such affliction shall befall them, as never
since the beginning of the world. At this time shall the Angel Michael come
forth, and separate the wicked from Israel, as writes Cap.12.verse.1.
Daniel. They which remain shall flee into the desert, and for five and forty
daiesspace, live with grass, and leaves, and herbs; but all the wicked
Israelites shall die. Armillus shall after subdue Egypt, and shall turn thence
against Jerusalem, and seek again to waste it. These things after their
manner they fable out of the eleventh and twelfth of Daniel.

Michael, who three times shall wind his great horn Es.27.13. and Zach. 9.
14. At the first sound, the true Messiah Ben-Dauid, and Elias the Prophet,
shall show themselves to those devout Israelites in the deserts of Judah, who
shall then gather courage: and all the Jews in the world shall hear this
sound, and shall confess GODS deliverance, and all that have been led captive
into Assyria, shall assemble together. The same horn shall strike fear and
diseases into the Christians, and other people. Now shall the Jews make great
iorneyes toward Jerusalem, and together with Elias and Messiah shall come
thither with joy. Armillus hearing this, in his proud fury shall re-assemble
his Christians against the Messiah and Jerusalem. But GOD not suffering his
people to fall out of one trouble into another, shall say to the Messiah, Come
place thy self at my right hand; and to the israelites, Be still, and wait
for the great succor of the LORD this day. And then shall GOD rain fire and
brimstone from heaven, as Ezekiel Ezec.38.22.
reports, wherewith Armillus and his army shall die, and Obad.18.
the house of Jacob shall be as fire, and the house of Joseph as a flame, and
the house of Esau (the Idumaean Atheists which destroyed GODS house) as stubble.

At the second sound, or blast of this horn of Michael, the graves at
Jerusalem shall Messiah Ben-Dauid with Elias, shall revoke into life that
Messiah Ben-Ioseph: and the Israelites shall send Messiah Ben-Dauid into all
countries of the Jews dispersion, to cause them to come to Jerusalem; and the
Nations with whom they are, shall bring them in their chariots, and on their
shoulders.

The last Miracle, is the third time of Michaels winding his horn, when GOD
Gosan, Lachbach, Chabor, and in the Cities of Judah, and they without number or
measure, shall with their infants enter into the Paradise of Moses; and the
ground before them and behind them shall be mere fire, which shall leave no
sustenance to the Christians. And when the ten Tribes shall depart out of the
Nations, then the pillar of the cloud of Divine glory shall compass them, and
GOD shall go before them, and shall open to them the fountains flowing from
the tree of life, Esah49.10.

Against these ten miraculous signs, fore-shewing Messiah his coming, the
most being full of troubles, they have ten consolations. First, The certainty
of Messiah coming. Secondly, That he shall gather them from all places of the
dispersion, Ierem. 31.8. but the lame there mentioned shall be so cured, that
Esaias 35.^.
they shall leap as Hearts, etc. Thirdly, GOD will raise up the dead. Fourthly,
GOD will erect a third Temple, according to the figure of that in Ezekiel 41.
Fifthly, That the Israelites shall then reign over all the earth, Esaias 60. 12.
yea all the world shall be subject to the Law, Soph.3.9. Sixthly, God will
destroy all their enemies, Ezech.25.14. Seventhly, God will take from them all
diseases, Esaias 33.24. Eighthly, God will prolong their lives, that they shall
live as long as an Oak, Esaias 65.22. and as in the times from Adam to Noe.
Ninthly, They shall see God face to face, Esai. 40.5. and they shall all
prophecy, Joel 2.28. Tenthly, God shall take away from them all evil
concupiscence, and inclination to evil, Ezech.36.26. Thus far out of the
book Abhkas Rochel.

Their cheer in these days shall be the greatest beasts, birds, and fishes,
which God ever created; and no other wine then what grew in Paradise, and was
kept in Adams celler till that time: the great Ox Behemoth mentioned in Job
40.10.
Job, and Psalm, 50.10. All the beasts of the wood are mine, and the beasts
feeding on a thousand hills, that is, Behemoth which every day feeds on a
thousand hills. But left this devouring beast should consume all the hills in
the world, they tell you that he is a stalled Ox, still abiding in the same
place, and what he eats in the day, grows again in the night. The huge
Whale Leuiathan, or as they pronounce it, Lipiasan, must honor also this Feast:
of this they write in the Baua Basra; cap.5.
Talmud; that to prevent filling the world with these huge monsters, God gelded
the male Leuiathan, and the female is slain, and preserved in pickle, for the
just, to be eaten in the times of the Messiah, Esaias 27. The male Behemoth was
gelded also, and the female was stored up for this feast. Elias Leuita
reports of a huge huge bird, also called Barinchne, to be roasted at this
feast; of which the Bechoros cap. vlt.
Talmud says, that an egg, sometime falling out of her nest, did overthrow
and break down three hundred tall cedars; with which fall the egg, being
broken, ouerflowed and carried away sixty Villages. We will have the whetstone
before we part. R. Barchonnah saw a Frogge as big as Akra, a Village of
sixty households: then came a huger Serpent and swallowed that huge Frogge.
Lastly, the hugest hugest Crow that ever the Rabbin saw, slew and devoured
these both; and flying away, sat on a tree, which tree sure could not be less
then the three hundred cedars before mentioned, if this crow were but as big
as that egg. R. Papa answers, that he would never have believed it, but that
he saw it (I hope they will pardon us if we be of the same mind).

Rabbi Kimchi on the fiftieth Psalm auerreth out of Rabbi Iehudah, that Ziz is
a bird so great, that with spreading abroad his wings, he hides the Sun,
and darkeneth all the world. And (to leap back into the Talmud) a certain
Rabbi sailing on the sea, saw a bird in Like the fish in the Legend of Saint
Brandon, who if he could bring his tail to his mouth, would ouerturne the
world Leg. aur.
the middle of the sea, so high, that the water reached but to her knees;
whereupon he wished his companions there to wash, because it was so shallow:
Do it not (says a voice from heaven) for it is seven years space since a
hatchet by chance falling out of a man's hand in this place, and always
descending, is not yet come at the bottom. I perceive by your incredulous
smiles, you will scarce believe Cholm. cap.3.
that a Lion in the wood Ela, roared so dernely, that all the women in Rome,
(four hundred miles from thence) for very horror proved abortiue: and when
he came an hundred miles nearer, his terrible noise shook the teeth out of
all the Romans heads; and the Emperor himself, that caused the Rabbi to
obtain of GOD by his prayers to make this trial of the Lion, fell down from
his throne half dead; and with much importunity requested his help, to cause
him retire to his den. But this roaring has almost marred our feast.

Our wine you have heard of, fetched out of Adams celler, Esaias 27. 2. 3. and
Psalm. 75.9. Before the feast, Messiah will cause these pretty creatures,
Behemoth and Leuiathan Job 40.15. Psalm.104.26.
to play together, and make them sport: but when they have wearied themselves
in the fight, Messiah with his sword shall kill them both, Esaias 27.1. Then
follows the feast, and afterward his marriage: Psalm.45.10.
Kings daughters shall be among thine honorable women: at thy right hand
stands the Queen in the gold of Ophir: amongst the Messiah his excellent
women (Rabbi Kimchi expounds) shall be Kings daughters, for every King shall
repute it his own glory to bestow a daughter on the Messiah: but the true
Queen shall be one of the fairest Israelites daughters, and shall continually
converse with him, whereas the others must come only at call. He shall thus
beget children, which shall reign after him Esaias 53. 10. when he is dead.

Now the state of the Jews in his time shall be such, that the Christians
shall freely build them houses, and Cities, and till their grounds, and bestow
on them their goods: yea Princes shall serve them: and they shall walk in
fair garments, Esai. 60. 10. 11. 12. and Esai. 61. 5. 6. The air also shall
be new and wholesome, Esaias 65. 17. by the benefit whereof they shall abide
sound, and live long, and in their age be as fresh as if they were young,
Psalm 92. 14. 15. The wheat once sown shall always grow up of it self, no
otherwise then the Vines, Hosea 14.8. And if any shall desire any rain for his
field, or garden, or one herb by it self, he shall have it, Zachar. 10. 11.
Then shall be peace among men and beasts, Hosea 2. 19. Esaias 11. 7. if there
arise any war among the Gentiles, the Messiah shall accord them, Esaias 2.4.
They shall live in great felicity, full of the knowledge and praise of GOD.
The earth shall be full hereof, etc.

Thus have we heard the infancy of the Church in the time of her nonage, and
of those Hebrew Patriarchs: we have seen also their present Infancy in
these Jewish fables, the just reward of John3.13.
Loving darkness, rather then light. And so with our prayers to GOD, at last
to take that Veil of Moses from their hearts, that there may be One proper
Shepherd, and one sheepefold, and that mean while we may learn preciously
to esteem, and reverently to make use of that light we have; warned by the
spectacle of Divine Justice in them, through so many eyes blinded in so
palpable fooleries; we will now leave them and this Holy Land, and seek
further what adventures we shall light on in the next neighboring Nations;
hoping and craving for pardon of such prolixitie in this part of our discourse,
fittest, of all the other in this part of our work, to be considered.

CHAP. XXI.
Of the hopes and hindrances of the Jews Conversion.

WHen I had now (as I thought) brought this Jewish Relation to an end, and even
wearied the Reader with that which might much more weary the Writer: that
Prophecy of Rom.11. 25.26.
Paul, That all Israel shall be saved, etc. which by most Interpreters is
construed of the general conversion of that Nation, after the fulness of the
Gentiles be come in (as in the beginning of this Work is said) caused my
straying pen (ready to wander from these, so far wandering from their holy
progenitors) to undertake this task, also to declare, what future hopes, and
what present fears and lets may be conceived of their conversion to
Christianity. The hope (though it be yet tossed upon surges of
almost-desperate Seas, yet) has anchoram sacram, a sure anchor to rely on,
and a kind of obscure kenning of that wished-for Haven, where it would be. For
P. Mart. in Romans c.11.
Non ita perierunt ad vnum Iudei, vt nulla supersit de illorum salute spes. The
destruction of the Jews (says Peter Martyr) is not so desperate, but that
there is some hope left of their salvation. And a little after, (alluding to
the Apostles mystery) Cum enim plenitudo fuerit tam ad Christum conuersa ex
Gentibus, tunc and Israelitae accedent: For when there shall have been a full
conversion of the Gentiles unto CHRIST, then shall the Jews also come in. So
Chrysostom; Tom.2.Hom. 12. in Marc. de verbis Dom. circa ficum.
Quis subintranit plenitudo Gentium, in nouissimo saluabitur omnis Israel;
because the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, at last all Israel shall be
saved. The same hope is generally cherished by the rest of the Fathers: yet
does indeed depend more upon Divine goodness then on humane probability; the
stabilitie of his Truth, which has promised (as Paul also Romans 11. expounds
the former Prophets) the unchangeableness of GODS Election, the bottomless
Sea of his Mercies, the vnsearchablenesse of his Judgments, minister hope
beyond hope. Hereunto also may be added the common grounds, both of Reason,
which they hold with us in Nature; and of Scripture, the auncienter parts
whereof, and especially the Law of Moses, they maintain with equal
acknowledgement, and (for the most part) with more forward industry and zeal,
then do the commoner sort of Christians.

But the Impedime^ts of the Jews conversion.
impediments which have hitherto, and do yet withold them from
Christianity, do exceed in number and power. For that fore-stalled prejudice
of theirs, the glory of the Temple, the Sacrifices and Legal worships past,
their hopes then and still of such a Monarch to their Messiah, as you have
heard of, the splendor of their renowned Ancestors, the keeping of the Divine
Oracles, their peculiar title of being GODS people, have bredde in them such a
swelling pride, that they naturally envy and abhor the very thought
thereof, that the Gentiles should in these things either equal or succeed
them.

Sooner (says Martin Luth.in Mic^.4.1,2.
Luther) then they would endure, that the Gentiles (which in their daily
prayers they curse and reuise) should have any part with them in their Messiah,
and be accounted co-heires thereof, they would crucify ten Messiahs: yea
(if it were possible) would do to death GOD himself, with all the Angels and
creatures else, although they should therefore undergo a thousand Hels.

Hence, in a great part, proceeds their natural and long continued
obstinacy. And besides that prejudice, pride, and envy, they are not a little
scandalized from the Christians themselves, somewhat in regard of the mutual
differences and disagreements among Protestants; which, though in it self bad,
is made much worse by the unseasonable and unreasonable exaggeration of their
common adversary, the Papist: but more, in respect of those which call
themselves Catholics, and are not, but even by these men are found to be
manifest Idolaters. Religion of the West parts
A scandal it is to see GODS Law neglected, and man's exacted with rigor: a
greater matter, at some times to eat flesh, then the adulterous pollution of
the flesh at any time: the blasphemies of Nations; these being interiections to
the vulgar, and phrases of gallantrie to the Princes: the forging and packing
of miracles; wherein the Friars and Jews concur with equal diligence, the
one in contriuing, the other in discovering them. A scandal are the
alterations which they are forced by the Inquisitors to make in their Authors
and Monuments of Antiquity: thinking, that these devises are our best
evidences. A scandale is the vowing and praying to Angels and Saints, yea, more
to the Mother of CHRIST, then to CHRIST himself, or to GOD, to whom alone
they repute this a due Sacrifice. But the greatest scandal of all others, is
the worshipping of Images. Indeed it seemed strange to me, and does to the rest
of my brethren according to the flesh ( Nathanael a Jew borne, baptized in
London, before the Congregation at All-hallowes Apr.1577.
made this confession) even unto this day, in whom this blindness and
hardness of heart is in part continued, through occasion given by them that
profess the name of JESUS: and not only in us, which are of the house of
Israel, but in others, as the Turks and Mahumetanes, which are of the Race of
Ishmael. We and our Fathers and Elders say, and in our Books call them by no
other name, but Buale abodazara, Idolatrous Masters: a thing so detestable unto
us, as nothing more, etc. They say unto us oftentimes, that they do not
worship them as Gods, but GOD in them: Neither are the Heathen, we say, that
are round about us, so blinded, that they think the stocks and stones to be
GOD, but they are persuaded that GOD may be worshipped in them. And yet they
go farther: for the Christians in Spain and Portugal have it written in
their books, That the Virgin Marie is the LORDS Treasure, and that she
bestows gifts and graces upon her servants: That her mercy pardons them,
whom the justice of her Son might condemn, and that our Salvation lies in
her hands. But our Law teaches, That GOD is All-sufficient, he gives to whom
he lists, He will not give his glory to another, etc. The Reader may (if he
please) from that Jew himself, in his printed Confession, be further informed
of that Partition Wall which separateth the Jew and Catholic.

They are so much the more scandalized, when they see the Catechismes recite
the Decalogne, with omission of that second Commandment, which they think
(as one of their greatest Rabbines contested with our Rel.West.
Author) was the Ordinance of CHRIST himself. Yea, the Priests and Friars let
pass in their conferences with them for current, their Jewish vpbraidings,
That CHRIST, a Carpenters Son, was an Image-maker, or at least an Author of
their worshipping. As for those speculatiue playsters of (...) and (...), of
intention isntrumental and final in worship, of Images of the true, and Idols
of the false Gods, they are (as even now you heard) the vnsauourest dregs to
the Jew in the world.

The poor Idiot, among the Christians, can as little distinguish as the Pagan,
and both amongst the Christians is like honor done to GODS Image, and to that
of Saints, and to them both, in like form of worship, as amongst the Pagans.
They are forced to be at some Sermons, and there are well edified by their
hearing, when they see the Preacher direct his prayer to a Crucifixe, calling
it his Lord and Sauieur. Their Transubstantiation is a monster as hideous as
the former.

The means Ibid^
used to their conversion are weak; especially in some places, where they have
not the New Testament in such Language as they can understand: and the
Inquisitors have inhibited and taken from them all books written on that
Theme, in defense of Christian Religion, or against it, alleging, they will
have no disputing in matters of Religion either way, like the Jesuits Edict at
Dola, forbidding all talk of GOD, either in good sort or in bad.

But of all other this is a good furtherance, that when in their Baptism they
deny the Devil and all his works, they must renounce their right and
property in all their goods and possessions; the shameful covetousness of
hypocritical Christians having brought these irritamenta malorum within the
compass of the Devils works: presupposing (forsooth) that either the
converted Jew, or his corrupt ancestors, have scraped together such heaps of
wealth by Usury, or Oppression, or some unlawful means or other. Therefore
for the good of his soul, his body shall be left to beg or starve; while,
with the leaving of his Jewish Superstition, he must likewise leave all that he
has: and his new-receiued Religion must be a means to strip him of his
riches, and to weane him from his well-beloued Mammon, which that Nation is
naturally so far in love with. This alone, to the world-bewitched Jew, is
such a partition wall to keep him from Christianity, that he will venture
soul and all, rather then thus betray himself, his wife and children, to
extreme beggerie and want. Especially since the fairest of his preferment (to
welcome him to our Religion) is to turn Friar: then which profession, nothing
can be more hateful to him, who accounts it a course against Nature; and a
breach of that Ordinance of Gen.1.28.
GOD, (Crescite and multiplicamini) of multiplying the world by a holy
propagation in that Heb.13.4.
honorable estate of Marriage, which that 1.Tim.4.1.4.
doctrine of Devils has made the Friar incapable of. As for the example of
Elias, and some other holy men (whom our Popish Votaries would make Patrones
of their disorderly Orders;) the Jew (herein more truly-Christian then the
Papist) holds it a course extraordinary, and ordinarily prefers holy
Marriage far before that seeming-holy Vow of Virginity. Thus we see what
outward scandales, besides their general prejudice against Christianity, do
hinder them from it: which offenses, in behalf of the Christians, together
with that prejudice, pride, and envy, and above all, that Veil which divine
Justice has left upon their hearts, GOD in his good time remove, and grant,
according to that Prophecy, That all Israel may be saved.

OF THE ARABIANS, SARACENS, TVRKES, AND OF THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF ASIA
MINOR, AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS.
THE THIRD BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Of ARABIA, and of the ancient Religions, Rites, and Customs thereof.

ARABIA is a very large Region, Maginus.
lying between two Bays or Gulfes of the Sea, the Persian on the East, and
that which hereof is called the Arabian, on the West: On the South is the
Ocean; on the North is Syria and Euphrates. Plin.l.6.28. Orosius, l.1.
Pliny sets down the Northern Limits, the Hill Amanus, oueragainst Cilicia
and Commagena; many Colonies of them being there planted by Tigranes the Great:
it thence (says he) declineth to our Sea and the Egyptian shore, and to the
heart of Syria to Mount Libanus. By a certain workmanship of Nature it much
resembles the form and site of Italy. Solin.36.
Arabia signifies Holy. The Nations in this wide Tract of Land are many. It is
the next to be spoken of in this our Discourse, according to our Geographicall
method, as confining upon Iudaea, whence we last departed.

Draudius in Solin. Beros.l.4.
Some derive the name from Arabus, the son of Apollo and Babylonia. And the
forged Berosus of Annius tells, That Ianus pater sent one Sabus into Arabia
Foelix; Arabus into Arabia Deserta; and Petreius into Petraea, all nephews of
Cham; all indeed the sons of Annius his brain. True it is, that Arabia is
commonly divided into those three parts, Petraea, Deserta, and Foelix. Of the
Nations in Arabia, Pliny writes largely, amongst the rest naming the
Saracens, of which we are anon to speak at large. But long before Pliny, the
Scripture speaks of the people of this Region (not only those which are said
to descend of Cush, the son of Cham, but of many others which descended of
Abraham. as Ishmael the son of Abraham, by Hagar; and Gen.25.2.
Zimran, and Iokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak and Shuah with their
posterity, the issue of Abraham by Keturah: who, after that Seba and Sabbetha,
and Rama and Sabtheca had peopled some parts of Arabia, were sent away with
their portions Eastward to the East Country, that is, into Arabia; where it is
likely they mingled their Seed and Generations with those former of the
posterity of Cham: for therefore it seems Moses wife, Zipporah, was called a
Number.12.1.
Cushite, or (as some read) an Ethiopian, not that she was of the Country
Aethiopia, but a Midianite of Arabia, of Abraham's race: which Country, because
the posterity of Cush had first inhabited, and happily had mingled themselves
in marriages with them, she is called a Cushite, which some wrongly expound an
Ethiopian; although Cush were also the father of the Aethiopians. This
posterity of Abraham are, in Scripture, often called the children of the East.

The name Foelix, or Happy, is given to the Southerly parts of Arabia, for the
fertility thereof: Arias Montan. Caleb.
the name Petraea to a second part, of Petra the Seat royal, after called
Arach, of Aretas an Arabian King.

The Desert Arabia has a name answerable to the nature thereof; being, in
great part, without inhabitants, for the barrenness of the soil: as is also a
great part of that which is called Petraea. This Desert Arabia is also Maginus,
Plotom.l.5.
called Aspera, Inferior, C^ua, and of the Hebrews Cedar. It is bounded on the
East with Babylonia, and part of the Persian Gulf; on the North with
Mesopotamia, near to Euphrates; on the West, with Syria and Arabia Petraea; on
the South, are the Mountains of Arabia Foelix. Near to them and to Euphrates
it has some Towns, and is frequented with Merchants, otherwhere partly
unpeopled, partly ( Strabo therefore terms it Scenitae, vel Nymades, (...)
Scenitis) fed with such I entorys.
Roming Arabians, as have no dwelling-houses, but remove to and fro, seeking
where to find pasture for their Beasts, and lodge in Tents.

David accounts himself Ps.120.5.

Tanquam Scenita Kedareni.
as the Scenites of Kedar. Thus did the Patriarchs of old, thus did the
Scythians, and thus do the Tartars and the Arabians in Asia, Africa, and
Europe, at this day, roming, rouing, robbing.

They Boter. relat. part.1.l.2.
which dwell in Towns and Cities, observing a more civil life, are called
Moors, the other Arabians, in more proper appellation. The name Moors was
given them of the Spaniards, because out of Mauritania they invaded Spain, and
now Adrichem. Theat.T.S.
is taken usually, not so much for the inhabitants of the Arabian Cities, as
for all of the Arabian and Mahumetane Superstition. Bosra is the chief City.

Arabia Petraea adioyneth on the West and North to Syria; on the East to the
Desert Arabia; on the South to the Happy. Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolomey call it
Nabathaea. Some think, of Nebaioth, son of Ishmael. Tyrius calls it Arabia
Secunda. Now it is called by Ruscelli, Baraab; or after Ziglerus, Barra; or
Bathalatha, after Castaldus.

Nigh to Syria it is more plentiful, then in other parts. The scarcity of
wood and water, with the barrenness of the Soil in other places, show how it
is maligned of the Elements. Both in this part, and the former, they had need
go strong and well accompanied, for fear of Robbery and Spoil, which the
Arabians attend.

This part is famous unto all Generations, not so much for the Amalekites,
Midianites, and other their bordering Neighbors (of whom and their Religion
somewhat is spoken Lib.1.c.vlt.
before) as R.Volaterran.
for the miraculous passage of the Israelites through the same, and abode
therein forty years, in which time they received the Law, were fed with
Mauna; their Meat, Drink, Clothing, Judgments, Mercies, continually yielding
miraculous evidence of GODS presence amongst them.

Bellonius visited the Mount Sinai: he Obser.l.2.c.co.and d.
says, it is a mile and a halse from Horeb, and far higher: from whose top,
(which is hard stone of iron color) may both shores of the Red Sea be seen.
Some say it is called Mare Erythraeum, or red, of Erythraeus a King of that
name.
This Sea is not therefore called Red, because either the ground, or the sand
or the water thereof is Red, as Bellonius has observed, for none of them are
Of this see more.l.6.c.vlt.
so. The people thereabouts take care for no other houses then the boughs of
Palme-trees, to keep them from the heat of the fun (for rain they have but
seldom:) the cattle are less there then in Egypt. In the ascent of Mount
Sinai are steps cut out in the Rock: they began to ascend it at break of day,
and it was after noone before they could get to the Monastery of
Maronite-Christians, which is on the top thereof. There is also a Meschit there
for the Arabians and Turks, who resort thither on pilgrimage as well as the
Christians. There is a church also on the top of Mount Horeb, and another
monastery at the foot of the hill: besides other Monasteries, wherein live
religious people, called Caloieri, observing the Greek rites who show all (and
more then all) the places renouned in scriptures and antiquities to Pilgrims.
They eat neither flesh nor white meats. They allow food unto strangers such
as it is, rice, wheat, beans, and such like, which they set on the floor
without a cloth, in a wooden dish, and the people compose themselves to eat
the same, after the Arabian manner, (which is to fit upon their heels touching
the ground with their toes, whereas the Turks fit crosse-legged like Tailors.)

Arabia Foelix Maginus. Dom. Niger.com. Asiae l.6.

which it does abut the space of 3000. five hundredth and four miles. Virgil
calls it Panchaea, now Adrich. says it is now called Mamotta.
Ayaman, or Giamen. It has store of rivers, lakes, towns, cities, cattle
fruits of many forts. The chief Cities are Medina, Mecca, Ziden, Zebit, Aden.
There is store of silver, gold, and variety of gemmes. There are also wild
beasts of diverse kinds. As for the Phoenix, because I (and not I alone) think
it a Fable, as neither agreeing to reason nor likelihood, and plainly
disagreeing to the History of the Creation and of Noah's Arc, in both which GOD
made all Male and Female, and commanded them to increase and multiply, I think
it not worthy recital.

Ludomeus Vertomannus, or Barthema (as Ramusius names him) tells
Eud.vertom.l.1.c.7.
at large his journey through all this threefold Arabia: he traveled from
Damasco to Mecca Anno 1503. with the Carauan of Pilgrims and Merchants, being
often by the way set upon by Armies of those theeuish and beggarly Arabians.
This journey is of forty days travel, traveling two and twenty hours, and
resting two for their repast. After many days they came to a Mountain
inhabited with Jews, ten or twelve miles in circuit, which went naked, and
were of small stature about five or six spannes high, black of color,
circumcised, speaking with a womanish voice. And if they get a Moore in their
power, they flay him alive. They saw there certain whitethornes, and in the
same two Turtles, which seemed to them as a miracle: for in fifteen days and
nights they had neither seen birds nor beasts. They give their Camels by the
way not above five barley Loaves at a meal, as big as a Pomegranate, and
drink once in three days. At the end of eight days they staid a day or two
to rest them. Their pilote directed their journey by the compass (in Diodorus
times, they observed the North-starre) no less then if it had been at Sea.
They traveled five days and nights through the sandy Sea, which is a great
plain Champaine, full of a small white sand like meal: where if, by some
disaster, the wind blow from the South they are all dead men. And although
they had the wind at North, yet could they not see one another above ten paces
off. And such as ride on Camels are enclosed with wood, with holes to receive
the air; the Pilots going before with their compass for direction. Many died
there for thirst, and many with fullness, drinking too much when once they came
at water. When the North winds blow, those sands are driven to a heap. He
supposed that Mummia was made of such as the sands had surprised and buried
quick: but the truer Iul.Scaliger. Exerc.104.
Mummia is made of embalmed bodies of men, as they use to do in Egypt, and
other places. As for the other parts of Arabia, they which list, may by this
our author, by Pliny, Niger, and others, be informed further.

To come to the disposition of the people, they are small, naked, beggarly.
What they have done in Asia, Afrike, and Europe by force of Arms under the
name of Saracens, and pretense of Religion shall follow in the next Chapter:
What they still do, if they meet with purchase, Travelers know to their
cost. The practice of Merchandise amongst some of the Arabian people, and
namely the Ismaelites, the Gen.37.28.
Scripture records. For their ancient Religion, it is not like it could be
good, when as they had so bad an Author of their stock, accursed Cham: the
sounes of Abraham were better instructed: but as they were borne after the
flesh, and not according to promise, so if they and some of their posterity
did a while hold the truth, (as the History of Job and his friends euinceth)
yet this lasted not long: but soon after Psalm.76.1. and147.20.
in Iewrie was GOD known, and he dealt not so with any other Nation. Herodotus
Herodot l3.
(father of the Greek History) affirms in his Thalia, that the Arabians
worshipped Dionisius, whom they named Vrotalt; and Urania, whom they called
Alilat: these alone they esteemed Gods. They shave their maidens like to
Dionisius, in a round form about the temples. Suidas tells Suid.hist.
that they were excellent Archers, their Arrows were as long as themselves:
their bows they bent not with hands, but with feet.

Curio Coelius Aug. Curio hist. Sar. l.1.
in his Saracenicall History testifies of them, that as they descended in
great part of Abraham's race by Ishmael, the sons of Keturah, and by Esan: so
they of old had and still retain many rites observed by the Hebrews: as
numbering by Tribes, and marrying only within their own Tribe: every Tribe
also had their own King. (which it seems the Tent wandering or
Scenite-Arabians observe still) That son succeeds not which is eldest, but he
which is borne first after he is proclaimed King or Ruler, being of Noble race
on both sides. They used also Circumcision. For their religion in old times;
some were Christians, of which (about the times of Mahomet) there were many
sects: some were Jews; others worshipped the Sun and Moon: others, certain
Serpents; others, some kinds of Trees; and some a Tower called Alcaba, which
they supposed Ismael had built; and some others, some other deities.

Eusebius Eusebius. de laudib.Constant.
tells that they used humane sacrifices, which not only Sardus confirms,
saying, that they sacrificed every year a child whom they buried under the
Altar: but Sardusl 3. c 15.
Nicephorus Niceph. hist. Ec.l.18.23.
also reported of one Naaman a Scenite-Arabian, a chiefetaine amongst them, who
in zeal of that superstition, killed men with his own hands, and sacrificed
them on the Altars to his gods. He in the time of Mauricius, warned by a
vision, became a Christian, and with him an innumerable company of his, whom he
offered a living unbloody sacrifice in baptism unto CHRIST.

When they entered league with any, their manner was, that one standing in the
mids between both parties did wound the hand with a sharp stone, in the palm
near to the thummes of them both, and taking flocks of the garments of them
both, anointed, with that blood, seven stones set in the mids of them:
Meane-while inuoking Dionisius and Urania: and then this Mediator becomes
surety for the party, who thereby esteems himself bound to observe it. And
thus did Herod l.3.
they make league with Cambyses. To these two Arabian Gods Great Alexander
would have added himself a third (says Arrian.l.7.
Arrianus, in his life.) He made great provision to invade them, both because
they had sent him no Embassage, and for that they worshipped only these two
deities; Heaven, for that it contains the Sun and Stars; and Dionisius,
because he had invaded the Indians: and therefore aequalling this his own
expedition to that of Dionisius, he would also for robbing of men, be reckoned
a God. Strabo Strabo l.15.
says, that in respect of the wealthinesse of this country, he had thought
(had not death prevented him) to have made Arabia the imperial seat. He
affirms also that Sesostris the Egyptian King, passing through Arabia, in
that his renowned expedition, erected there in diverse places Egyptian temples
and superstitions: that the Troglodytae which dwelt in Caves, and bordering on
the Egyptians, by some reputed Arabians, were circumcised, as the Arabians and
Egyptians were.

The Nabathaeans worship the Sun, burning Frankincense on an Altar unto him.
They neglect the bodies of the dead, burying even their Kings in a dunghill. Of
the other Arabians he reports that they used incestuous copulation with
sister and mother. Adultery with them is death: but that only is Adultery,
which is out of the same kindred, otherwise all of the same blood to use the
woman is their (incestuous) honesty. When fifteen brothers (Kings sons) had
by their continual company tired their one and only Sister, she devised a
means to rid her self, or at least to ease her somewhat of that trouble. And
therefore whereas the custom was, that he which went in, left his staff at
the door to prohibit others entrance, she got like slaves, and always having
one at the door, was disburthened of their importunity; every one that came,
thinking some other had been there before them. But they being once
altogether, one of them stole from his fellows, and finding this staff at the
door, accused his Sister to his Father of Adultery, whereof by discovery of
the Truth she was cleared. Linschoten Linschoten. History of the Indies.
tells of the like practice observed by the Nairos in Cochin, leaving their
Arms at the door, when they enter to their Nairo-kinswomen which they use
likewise in common, being never married.

Their Circumcision they observed, as Draudius in Solin.
some write, at the thirteenth year of their age, imitating Ismael herein.
Every one abides in his Fathers profession. The possessions and wealth are
common to the whole kindred. Alexander ab Alexandro names Dyasares an Arabian
deity. Their Priests he says were attired in linen garments, with Mitres and
Sandals. Sol.Polyhist.
Solinus affirms, that they abstain from Swines flesh: neither will that
sweet air of Arabia breath life to that sordide and stinking creature. This is
in the Happy Arabia, where happiness makes them unhappy: their sweets
Strab.l.16.
breeding bitter effects in diseasing their bodies, which they are forced to
cure with the sents of brimstone and Goats beards burnt. That which others
admire and almost adore for rareness and excellency, is here their common
sewell for their fire: D. Sic.l.3.
Vulcans devouring jaws being fed with herbs, shrubs, trees, gummes, spices,
for humane and divine uses most esteemed.

Frankincense (says Plin.l.12.c.14.
Pliny) grows only in Arabia, but not in every place thereof. About the
midst of the country is Sabota (the chief City of the Sabaeans) in a high
mountain: eight mansions from thence is the Region of Frankincense, which is
called Sabba, that is, a mystery: looking toward the East, every way guarded
and made impassable with Rocks. The soil is reddish, inclining to white. The
length of the Fankinsence-wood, is twenty sehoeni, the breadth half as much.
(a schoenus in this account is five miles) Other Arabians besides (these and
the Minaei) see not this tree, nor all of these, but only some three hundred
Families, unto whom the right of these rites deuolueth by succession. Therefore
are they called sacri, Holy, neither may they in the time, when they cut them,
be polluted with knowledge of women or with Funerals. What manner of tree it
is, Pliny says he knew not, nor any Roman to his knowledge. They gathered
it in the spring and autumn: they cut the trees from whence it sweateth. There
needs no watch to keep them, but the innocence of the inhabitants. When
Alexander in his Youth bestowed large store of Frankincense in his devotions,
Leonides his Mr. told him, he should so do when he had conquered the country
where it grew: He after enjoying (some part of) Arabia, sent him a ship laden
with Frankincense, and bad him serve the Gods plentifully. The Frankincense,
when it is gathered, is carried on Camels to Sabota by one way, out of which to
go were capital. There they pay the tithes to a God which they call Sabis.
The Priests take it by measure, not by weight. Certain portions are allowed to
them and to the Kings scribes. Plantus therefore Pl.in Poenulo and in Milite.
calls Frankincense Odor Arabicus. Virgil calls it Panchaean, and Sabaean
Frankincense. The manifold rites which the Heathens used in their holy things
with this drugge, Stuckins Stuckins de sacris.
shows at large. Here also grew the Mirth in the same woods, and among the
Trogloditae. But this and Cinnamon and other things which grew elsewhere as well
as here, need not much discourse. They used yet some religion in gathering of
their Cinnamon, as Joan.Boemus.
some observe, sacrificing before they began, and after dividing what they had
gathered, with a sacred spear assigning a portion to the Sun: if the division
be justly made, the Sun seals his consent by fire, with his beams consuming
the same. Thus much of their spices, and holy drugges.

Of their other riches I mean not to speak, save of their sheep with great
tails, some of which weigh forty pound. Leo.Africanus.
Leo says he saw one at Cairo, whose tail, supported by a Cart with wheels
(for else she could not have carried it) weighed fourscore pound, and heard
of such as weighed a hundred and thirty pound. Gal.1.17.
Paul presently after his conversion preached the Gospel in Arabia.

Panchaea and an other Island, called Sacra, are adioined by Diod.Sic. l.6. c.
10.
Diodorus to Arabia, both fertile (as he says) of Frankincense. In Panchaea is
the City Panara, whose inhabitants are called the Ministers of Jupiter
Triphylius, whose Temple is thence distant threescore furlongs, admirable for
the Antiquity, magnificence and nature of the place: it is two hundred foot
long, the breadth answerable, having in it large Statues, and about it the
houses of the Priests. Many Fountains there springing make a nauigable
stream, called the water of the Sun, which is medicinable to the body. The
country about, for the space of two hundred surlongs, is consecrated to the
Gods, and the revenue thereof spent in sacrifices. Beyond is a high mountain,
called the seat of Heaven, and Olympus Triphylins: where Coelus is said to
have instituted the rites there yearly observed. The Priests rule all in
Panchaea both in civil and religious cases: and live very deliciously, attired
with linen stoales and mitres, and parti-colored sandals. These spend their
time in singing hymns, and recounting the acts of their gods. They derive
their generation from the Cretan Jupiter. Eadem fere Eusebius.de praeparat.Eu l,2.
They may not go out of their sacred limits assigned them, if they do, it is
lawful to kill them. The Temple is enriched with gifts and offerings. The
doors excel for matter and workmanship. The bed of the God is six cubits
long, and four broad, all of gold fair wrought. The Table stands by, nothing
inferior. In the mids is another bed of gold, very large, graven with
Egyptian Letters; in which are contained the gefts of Jupiter, Coelus, Diana
and Apollo, written by Mercury. Thus far Diodorus. Iustine Justin.bift. l.39.
mentions Hierotimus an Arabian King, which had six hundred children by
Concubines. Some Gramay As Arab.
are of opinion that the Wisemen which by the ancient conduct of a Star came
to Jerusalem, (the first fruits of the Gentiles) came out of Arabia. Scaliger
Ios. Scal.Can. I sag.l.2.
mentions a conquest aunciently made and holden by the Arabians in Chaldaea.
Philostratus Philost. de vita Ap.l.1.
says, the Arabians are skillful in auguries, or diuinations, because they
eat of the head and heart of a Dragon. That they eat Serpents, Solinus
affirms. Atheneus Athaeneus l.6.c.6.
says that the Arabians used to maime themselves, if their King happened to be
maimed, and that in the same member: and in Ath.l.12.c.4.
another place he cites out of Heraclides Cumaens, the delicacies of this
Arabian King, and his quiet or idle course of life, committing matters of
judgment to officers: and if any think himself wronged by them, he pulls a
chain fastened to a window in the highest part of the Palace: Whereupon the
King takes the matter into his hand, and whether part he finds guilty dies
for it. Plutarch de Inuid. and odio.
His expenses were fifteen Babylonian talents a day. The Arabians kill Mice,
as a creature supposed enemy to the gods, a custom common to them with the
Persians and Aethiopians. The Tertullian de veland.Virg.
women cover their faces, contented to see with one eye, rather then to
prostitute the whole face. They kill not Vipers, but scarre them away with
Clappers from their balsame-trees says, Pansania Baeotica.
Pansanias, when they gather that commodity, because they think them
consecrated to those balsame-Trees, under which they live and feed of that
liquor, with which also they cure themselves if they are bitten by them.

The Arabian tongue is now the common language of the East, especially among
such as embrace the Mahumetan religion: this language in the first division of
tongues, according to Epiph.contra Sethian.
Epiphanius, was begun in Armot, the first speaker and Author thereof.

CHAP. II.
Of the Saracene Name, Nation, and proceeding in Arms.

PLINY lib. 6. cap. 28. mentions among other Arabian Nations the Saracens:
placing them near to the Nabathaeans. Ptolomey Geograph. lib.6.c.7.
likewise names the Scenites so called of their tents, which with themselves,
their flocks, and substance they removed up and down from place to place.
Posterity has called all these Tent-wanderers (says Scenitas Arabas quos
Saracenos nunc appellamus.A.M.l.22
Scaliger out of Ammianus Marcellinus) Sarracenes: and so does Ptolomey in the
next words call the next adioining people, seating them in the Northerly bounds
of Arabia Foelix. In the same Chapter he sets down Saraca, the name of an
Arabian. Epiphanius lib. 1. says that the Tribes of the Agarens or Ismaelites,
are now called Saracens. Boterus. Curio.alij.
Some later Authors have written, that because Ishmael was the son of Haegar
a bondwoman, his nicer posterity have disclaimed that descent, and derived
their pedigree and name from Sara. Josephus Scaliger, in his Annotations upon
Eusebius Chronicle, after that he has cited the former testimony of Ammianus,
and of Oukelos on the 37. of Genesis, adds the authority of Stephanus; who
affirms Saraka to be a region of Arabia, near the Nabathaeans, of which he
thinks that the Saracens borrowed their name. We know (says Scaliger) that
the Arabian Nomades are so called: for Sarak in Arabian sounds as much, that
is ( furaces (...)) theeuish or robbers, such as the Cosakes, Tartars, etc. De
Sara, perridiculum: To call them Saracens of Sara is ridiculous; for then
either they must be called Saraei, or she Saraca. Am.Mar.l.14
Marcellinus thus writes of them; This people stretches from the Assyrians to
the falls of Nilus: all warriors, half naked, in colored iackes. None
ploweth or planteth, but they wander up and down without houses or laws;
their life being always in flight. Their wives they hire and Covenant with for
a time: which breed child in one place, and bring forth in another, and never
rest. Their food is Venison, Milk, Herbs, and such fowls as they can take:
the most, that we have seen, know not the use of Wheat or Wine. Like Kites
they snatch their prey, but stay nor by it, whether they win or loose. They
are such, as the Romans need never wish them their friends or their enemies.
In the time of Julian Lib.25.
they made out-rodes and spoils on the Roman provinces, because they were
denied their wonted stipends by Julian, who told them that he had better store
of Iron then gold.

This name Saracene may well befit that course of life which they embraced: for
in the more Southerly parts of Arabia, they are more civil and rich, dwelling
in Cities, and have quick trade, which all are wanting about Medina and Mecca,
places so renowned by the life and death of Mahomet. Neither does it seem
probable that those which were called Agarenes in the continued succession of
so many ages, as appears 1. Chron. 5. 10. and Psalm. 83.6. would after grow
ashamed of that: or that Ishmael, which derided the hopes concerned of Isaac
the son of Sara, would nourish his posterity in the same hope, or leave to
them any honorable memory of Sara, who had rejected him together with his
mother. Yea, and their own superstitious Legend proves the contrary, as
shall appear in the next Chapter.

This robbing and rogueing people lived in much obscurity, until that
darkness brought them to light, and a Religion newly stamped by Mahomet, in a
secret and just judgment of GOD, for the contempt of the truth, was by as
new a kind of preaching (viz. force of Arms) obtruded on the lukewarm
world. For when as Mahomet, (of whose life solloweth a large discourse) had
observed that sick state of the Empire affected with Jewish rebellion,
Persian invasion, and Nestorian infection, besides the security of the Head it
self, Heraclius then Emperor: he thought good to take Occasion by the
forelocke, and to strike whiles the iron was hot. First, Saracen.hist.

under pretense of Religion having inueagled a multitude of Disciples, he made
a commotion in Arabia: and being therefore driven out of Mecca, many of his
followers resorted to him: Of whom he appointed Captains and leaders of the
rest, Vbequar, Omar, Ozmen, Alifre, Talaus, Azubeirus, Zadimus, Zaedinus and
Abuobeid. The Arabians (as some affirm) aided Heraclius in his war against
Cosdroes the Persian: and after that war ended, the Arabians complaining for
want of pay, the Treasurer answered that there was scarce sufficient for the
Greek and Roman soldiers, much less for that company of dogs. Whereupon,
as long before on like occasion they had rebelled in the reign of Julian, so
now enraged they departed into Syria, and adioined themselves unto Mahumet, who
even then after the Persian victory had obtained (some say) of the Emperor
whom he served in those wars, to himself and his followers, a Region to
inhabit; the Emperor so rewarding his exploites in the late wars. Mahumet
with this supply assailed Mecca, which diverse times before he had in vain
attempted, and took it, with other pieces in Arabia, viz. Hunaim, Ietrip,
Tambic, etc. He afterward created four Generals, whom he called the four
sharp swords of GOD, and commanded them to go into the four parts of the
world, and kill all such as would not embrace his Law. These four were

overthrown by Theodorus Begarius, Caesar's Lieuetenant. About the same time
died Mahumet, and this Abu-becher.

might, and the assistance of Homar and Osmen, obtained to be Califa, or Amira

temporal: the successor of Mahomet.
Califa, overthrew the imperials, and soon after died. Homar the next Califa
wanne Bosra the chief City of Arabia, and all the country as far as Gabata,
and put Theodorus, the Emperors brother, to flight. He besieged Damascus, and
having broken the forces that came to rescue it, obtained it: subduing also all
Phoenicia. After that, turning his forces into Egypt, Cyrus the Bishop of
Alexandria stayed him with promise of 200000. pieces of gold, for yearly
Tribute. This was disannulled by Heraclius, and Emanuel the deputy denied the
payment: whereupon entering the second time under conduct of Hamrus, Egypt was
conquered. After two years siege, Jerusalem also was won. Iaidus one of his
Captains subdued Edessa, and all Mesopotamia. Afterward placing Muauias over
all the countries between Euphrates and Nilus, he invaded Persia: where the
Persians lost both their King Hormisda, their state, religion, and name: of
Persians being converted into Saracens. This victorious Homar made Jerusalem
his royal seat, where he built a Temple to Mahumet: and while he was praying,
was murdered by his servant.

Ozmen, Othman 4.
the succeeding Caliph, sent a great Army into Africa, under the leading of
Hucba: who ouercomming Gregorious Patritius and destroying Carthage, subjected
all that Province to their Empire; making Tunes the Mother-citie: but soon
after translated that honor to Cairoan, which he bu^ilt thirty six miles from
the Sea, and a hundred from Tons. In the third year of his reign Muauias
the Deputy of Egypt with a Navy of seven hundred, or, as others say, of a
hundred and seventy sail, assailed Cyprus, and taking Constantia, wasted the
whole Island: and having wintered his Army at Damascus, the next year besieged
Arad in Cyprus and won it, and dispeopled all the I Will. Thence he invaded the
continent of Asia, and carried away many prisoners: and after, in a Sea Fight
with Constans the Emperor, died the Lycian Sea with Christian blood. He wanne
Rhodes, and sold to a Jew the brazen Colosse or pillar of the Sun, which
laded nine hundred Camels, sometime reckoned one of the worlds seven wonders,
made in twelve years space by Chares. After this he afflicted the Cyclades
Islands in the Archipelago, and then sent his Fleet against Sicilia, where they
made spoil with fire and sword, till by Olympius they were chased thence.
Muauias himself with an Army by land entered into Cappadocia: Iaid having
overrun all the neighboring Armenia, unto the hill Caucasus. But mean while
Ozmen, besieged in his house by Ali his faction, slew himself, when he had
lived eighty and seven years, and reigned twelve. The Saracens could not
agree about their new Prince; Muavi and Hali.5.

made the seat Royal. He subdewed the sect of Ali in Persia, and after
invaded Cilicia, and sent (to aid Sapores) a band of Saracens, which afflicted
Chalcedon, and sacked Armaria a city of Phrygia; and with a fleet invaded
Sicill, took Siracuse, and carried away with them the riches of Sicilia, and
of Rome it self, lately fleeced by the Emperor, and here horded. An other
army of Saracens, ouer-running the Sea coast of Africa led away eight hundred
thousand prisoners.

Muamad and Caise on the other side subdewed to Muaui, Lydia, and Cilicia;
About these times another false prophet called Muctar, obtained Persia, and the
Arabians were troubled. P. Diacon.in Justin:
and after, with Savus an other Saracen General, besieged Constantinople, from
April to September: and taking Cizicum, there wintred their forces, and in the
Spring, returned to their siege, which they continued seven years; but by
divine assistance, and force of tempest, they were chased thence. And
Constantiue slew three hundred thousand Saracens, in a battle (not long after)
against Susra the nephew of Muavi. and compelled the Saracens to pay a great
tribute. Anno 679.
Iezid reigned after the death of Muavi his father, (a better Poet then
Soldier) he soon died. Neither did his successors Marvan and Abdalan live two
years in the room. Abdimelec son of Maruan. Scal.9. and P.Diacon. in

Abdimelec was chosen Caliph, who descended from Hali, when as Abdalan of the
Image of Eubocara (the Arabians call this the Maraunian race; the other
Abazian) had possessed himself of that Title by force, whom Ciafa the kinsman
of Abdimelec ouer^threw. Ciasa after this victory entering Damascus, plucked
Iazid (one of the former Caliphs) out of his grave, burned his bones, and
hurled the ashes into the river, and cruelly persecuted all the Maraunian
stock.

Hereupon Others call him AbdulMu. men.
Abedramon one of that house with a great number of his friends and followers
fled into Mauritania Tingitana, where he was welcomed of the Saracens there
being, and first entitled himself Miralmumim, which signifies The Prince of
Believers, and then builded Leo writes otherwise, as in our 6. Book shall
appear: he says Marocco was built in the 424 year of their Hegira.
Marocco. Abdimelec having other yrons in the fire, neglected this: First
appeasing tumults in his own state; then overthrowing the Emperor in the
field: after receiving (by treason of the Deputy) Armenia; winning that part of
Persia, which yet was subject to the Romans, and by his forces spoiling
Thracia, whiles the Greeks were divided amongst themselves. He also chased the
Roman garrisons out of the coast-townes which they held in Afrike. Abdimelec
being dead, Called of Leo, Qualid, and of Scal.Walid.110.
Vbitus the son of Abedramon sncceeded, under whom the Saracens, besides the
spoil of Galatia, conquered all Afrike betwixt Niger and the Sea, a little
piece excepted at the mouth of the Straits subject to Rodericus the King of
Spain: Mucas was made Lieutenant of the Saracen Empire in Afrike. To him
Iulianus Earl of Cepta, full of indignation against his Prince, for deflouring
his fair daughter Caba, about the year seven hundred and twelve, offers the
conquest of Spain, if he would furnish him with some competent forces of his
Saracens. This traitor, thus strengthened with the authority of his place
(being Governor of the I Will Viridis and diverse places in Africa and Spain)
backed with his friends, and aided with the Saracens, overthrew the Gottish
Empire, which had now ruled Spain about three hundred years: Rodericus
loosing the field and his state, and spending the remnant of his days with an
Hermit in a solitary desert of Lusitania. Iulianus himself was after slain
by the Saracens, as were the Spanish Traitors; the just end of unjust
treachery.

of frost, causing famine and diseases in his camp, and partly, by the force of

Island called Sacra.

The Saracens in Spain erected amongst themselves many petite kingdoms, and
by their divisions made way to Pelagius, with some remainder of the Spaniards
to recover some of their lost country, who dying in the year seven hundred
thirty and two, his son Fafila succeeded, in whose time the Saracens passed
the Pyrenaean hills into France, where Theodoricus the second was then King,
but Paul.Aemil.libr.2.
Charles Martell master of the Kings house ruled, as did his father in that
office before, and his son, (both Pipins) after him. The Saracens took
Narbone, and after Bordeaux, killing in it, man, woman, and child, and rasing
the Temples to the ground; they passed Garunna, and ouerturned Angolesme and
Bloys, and came into Toures.
Turon, where Eudo the Goth then King of a great part of France, in wars with
Martell, for fear of the common enemy, entered league, and with their joint
forces slew three hundred and seventy five thousand Saracens; and those of
Navarre slew the rest that escaped, in their return. But when Eudo was dead,
Martell took part of his kingdom from his sons Hunoldus, and Vaifarus, who
thereupon recalled the Saracens, which under the leading of Atinus took
Auenion by the treason of Mauricius then Governor, from whence, and out of
France they were driven Annis 735. and 737. and 738.
by Martellus.

The Saracens made four invasions into Thrace while Euelitus was Caliph, to
whom succeeded Anno 74 Iezid.

After him and Hisan.
Ices, (which two ruled not two years) Marvan reigned; and after, another of
the same name, and the Saracens were divided. Tebid Dadac, and Zulciminius,
challenged each to himself the soueraignety: and when all these were
overthrown and slain, Asmulinus amongst the Persians raised up the servants
to murder their masters, and with them he overthrew Iblinus with one hundred
thousand Saracens; and after, Marvan himself with three hundred thousand, who
fleeing into Egypt, was there also vanquished and slain in a Temple.

This murder grew through the faction of the Abasian stock, who conspired
against him, because he had slain one of their kindred. Abulabas the chief of
this conspiracy succeeded him, in the Ios Scal Can. Is.lib.2.and lib.3.
year 749, and removed the Chaliphate to that family from the Maraunians, in
the year of their Hegeira, 132 after the Arabian computation; as we follow
Scaliger herein; and he the Chronicle which Abraham Zacuthi gathered out of the
Monuments of the Ismaelites. In the former relations, we have principally
followed Curio his Saracenicall history: though by the way we have borrowed of
others also.

This Abulabas being dead, Abugephar Elmantzar Ann^ Dom. 753. Heg.136.
succeeded. He imprisoned the twelve sons of Hasin the son of Ali, where
they perished; He began first to build the City of Bagded: he died An.Dom.

inthe 158 year. John di Barros As.dec.1. lib.1
ascribes this City to the Bug^afar also, for so he calls him; but Curio to
one Muamat long after. Scaliger Animad.in Eusebius. chron. Lydyat em. tem.
thinks this to be Seleucia, a City built nigh unto Babylon by Seleucus,
near the meeting and mixing of Euphrates and Tigris; of which see our
Babylonian history.

Mahdi his son succeeded 781. 786. 808. 813.
anno He. 165. after him Abarm Erreschid, Anno He. 170: and in the year 193.
Irvin the son of Reschid, slain by the faction of his brother Mamon 198.
This Mamon was studious of learning and learned men: He made Ali King of
Chorasan, and made a Law, That the posterity of Ali should be clothed in
yellow silk. In his time many Books were turned out of Greek into Arabian;
he died in the year 832. Anno Dom.841. 861.
218. Mutetzam followed: and after him in the year 226 of the Hegira Aharan
Elwathak: and next to him Methucal, who was slain in the year 247 by a Turk.
Muthnatzar his son and succeslour died in the year after, whom Elmustein
followed; under him the Turkenien set up Achmad son of Tolon servant of Mamon
King of Egypt and Syria, and slew the Chalipha anno H. 255. anno Domini 868.

After this time was the Caliphate or Popedom divided, one sitting at Bagded,
an other in Egypt. The Egyptian Chaliphs in our Egyptian History are
expressed in their due place and order. In Bagded succeeded Muhtadi. And the
next year Mutemad, who died 892. 900. 907. 931.
anno He. 279. Mutetzad his successor died 288. Muchtaphi, who slew Aharan the
last of Tolons family that reigned in Egypt, died 295. Mutetdan held the place
till the year three hundred and twenty. The next was Elkahar, to whom
succeeded in the next year, Ratze, and after him Muktaphe his brother, who
made Toson a Turk his chief Captain; of whom afterward he was blinded.
Mustekaphe succeeded 943.
anno H. three hundred forty and two. In his days the family of Bawia ruled,
whose son Meaz Eddula slew the Chaliph. Their Father had dreamed, that as he
pissed, fire ascended from his yard up to Heaven: which the Diuiners told him,
fignified the ensuing greatness of his sons.

He placed Matia in the Chaliphate, but ruled all things himself. Unto Matia
succeeded Taia, in his time Meaz Ledin Iilah was made K. of Mecca, Medina,
Aliman; Egypt he obtained before. Etzad Eddula son of Meaz repaired Bagded,
now much decayed, and gave his daughter in marriage to the Chalipha. This 981.

Etzad Eddula died anno Hegirae 371. to whom Tzautzam Eddula succeeded,
imprisoned by Beha Eddula, as was also Thia the Chaliph, and his house spoiled
anno Hegoriae 353. Sultan Eddula Segia reigned after this Beha, and Kadar was
Chalipha after Tasa. Scheraph Eddula reigned anno Hegirae 411. Kaim succeeded
in the Papacy anno Hegirae 1020.
422. and five years after Muktadi. The 1031.
Sultan being dead, and leaving a fonne of three years old; his wife, the
Babes mother, purchased the Sultanship of the Chalipha with a great sum of
money.

About this time flourished Ben Gazela, which made many Books of Physic.
Mustetaher was next Chalipha. In his time the Astrologers foretold an
exceeding 1095.
deluge, not so great as in the days of Noah, because then (said they) were
seven Planets in Conjunction with Pisces, whereas now there were but six,
Saturn being excluded. This made the Inhabitants of Bagded afraid, because of
the low situation: and caused them to stop the passages of the waters. The
Ismaelites which of devotion performed their Pilgrimage, were most of them
drowned. The Chalipha for this cause arrayed the Astrologer, which foretold
this, in royal apparel. He died 1118.
anno Hegirae 512. Musteraschad succeeded, then Raschid, and in the 1135.
year 530. Muktaphi. In his time were terrible Earthquakes, which made havoc
of all about Damasco, Aleppo, Tripolis, Antiochia, and Laodicea. Tigris
ouerflowed 1.60.
Bagded, and desolated many other Cities. In anno Hegirae 555. succeeded
Musteneged, who by his Physicians policy was strangled in the Bath, by the
violence 1170.
of the heat, the door being shut. His son Mustetzi enjoyed the room 566.
In his time the Abasian Caliphaes were received in Egypt, which the Phetimeans
of Ali his posterity had before separated.

Natzar succeeded 1179. 1225.
anno Hegirae 575. and Taher his son 621. Next Mestenatzar which gave much
Alms, and built many Schools. In his days arose in Asia, one Baba, which
professed himself a Prophet sent of God; who gathered an army of the scumme
of all Nations, whereby he filled Asia with blood and slaughter, both of
Christians and Israelites, until Glatheddin King of Gunia destroyed him.

In the year 640, of CHRIST one thousand two hundred forty and two, succeeded
Musteatzem, the four and fiftieth Saracenicall Chalipha. The Tartar King Chita
made his brother Halacho King of Irak and Mesopotamia, who besieged and sacked
Bagded, and slew Musteatzem. This Chalipha was starued by his commandment in
the midst of his treasures, because he would not employ the same (through
niggardise) for his own defense. From that time there has been no Chaliph
(says this Arabian History) in Bagded. In him ended the Abasian line, of which
had been five and thirty Chaliphaes.

After Mahumet or Muhammed the false prophet, the first Captains of war were
called Emirelmumenim, that is to say, Praefecti orthodoxorum, the Captains of
the Sound-Beleeuers: and after, because, under cloak of Religion, they seized
on the Primacie and tyranny (spiritual and temporal) they named themselves
Chaliphaes, that is, Vicars. The first Emirelmumenim was Abubecher. When by his
successors, Governors Such were the governors of Chorasan, Irak, Siras,
Damasco. Ie^^n, Mutzul, Halep, Gunia, Mahaan: The Arabian calls them Kings:
and their heirs succeeded them.
were sent into Spain and Africa, they for a time held the same as Deputies,
although to their power nothing lacked but the title of a King, yet they
professed to do all in the name of the Emirelmumenim until afterward they
took that Title also themselves, and became absolute. Whence all the pettite
Kings of Spain, and the African Potentates, were called Emire elmumenim; and
the Kings of Barbary are so stilled at this day, even as the French King is
called Christianissimus, and the Spaniard Catholicus. The Legates of the
Chalipha were called Naibin, which also signifies the same that Chalipha; but
this was made peculiar to those Saracen Tyrants, which used both Swords, (to
speak in the Roman language) supreme in matters Divine and Humane. Thus
observes Joseph Scaliger Can. Isag.l.3.
of these names: whereby it appears, that Emire elmumenim was not given only
to Abedramon and his successors in Africa, as is before observed out of Curio.

Thus have we given you a Chronographicall view of the ancient Chaliphaes,
with their first and greatest Conquests, omitting the lesser and later; as in
the year 807. in Sardinia and Corsica: in 826. in Creete: 843. in Sicill; and
presently after in Lud.Reg.lib.8
Italy, ouerrunning Tuscan, and burning the suburbs of Rome it self, with the
Churches of Peter and Paul 845. the next year in Illyria, Dalmatia; besides
the taking of Ancona: in 847. chased by Pope Plat.^m vita Pont.
Leo from Ostia. These with other their affairs of war, in Lucania,
Calabria, Apulia, at Beneuentum, Genua, Capua, (which Cities they took) I
pass over. After this great body grew lubberly and unwieldy, it fell under the
weight of it self, none so much as the Saracens overthrowing the Saracens, as
their Cairaoan became a Papacy absolute, though schismatical as they called
it: so did Marocco: the Persians were always p^one to such schisms: and
others, as it served for their advantage.
Sects and Divisions make plain. Nevertheless; this dis-joyning and
disjoynting notwithstanding, their Religion even still covers a great part of
the World. For besides the triumphing sword of the Turk, Persian, Mogore,
Barbarian, and other Mahumetan Princes: such is the zeal of the superstitious
Mahumetane, that in places furthest distant, this their Religion has been
preached, which they trade together with their merchandise, even from the
Atlantike Ocean unto the Philippinaes: It has founded in China, it has
pierced Tartaria: and although the name of Christian extends it self into so
many Sects and Professions in the Countries of Asia, Afric, and America,
besides Europe (almost wholly Christian;) yet is it hard to say, whether there
be not as many Disciples and Professors of this ridiculous and impious
devotion, as of all those which give their names to CHRIST, in whatsoever truth
or heresy.

Thus has the Field and the Church stouped to Mahumet: we may add more,
(Saul among the Prophets:) Learning has flourished amongst the Mahumetans, at
first so unlearned and rude. Lud.Reg.
Avicen, Averrois, Avempace, Algazel, etc. Philosophers; Mesve, Rasis, and many
other Physicians and Astrologers, mentioned in the Chronicles of Zacuthe; Leo,
and Abilfadis Ismael. Geographers; Cairaoan, Bagded; Fez, Marocco, Corduba,
etc. were Universities of Saracen-students. But now Learning and Schools are
decayed and ruined: even as at first also it was amongst them little
countenanced, as appears by that Hagag in the 96. year of the Hegira, 714.
who being Governor of King of Whereof Tauris is chief city: M. Poln
lib.1.ca.9 calls it Hirach. Magin Media mayor.
Irak, in his sickness consulted with an Astrologer, Whether the Stars had
told him of any Kings death that year: he answered, That a King should die,
but his name was Cani: Whereupon Hagag, remembering that at his birth his
Mother had imposed that name on him: I shall die, says he; but thou shall go
one hour before: and presently caused his head to be smitten off. An unhappy
Harbengership in reward of his Art: an unhappy Art which can better tell
others Destinies then their own. But no marvel in Hagag, who was fleshed in
blood, that his Herodian Testament should be thus bloody, who in his life had
in that Median Province slain a hundred and twenty thousand men, besides
fifty thousand men, and four score thousand women, which perished in his
imprisonments.

CHAP. III.
The life of Mahumet the Saracen Lawgiver.

THe life of Mahumet is at large described by diverse Authors, but no where so
fully as before the Alcaron in the Italian Edition, the sum whereof, and of
the other reports touching the same, is this; Ismael was the first (according
to that Italian Author, others ascribe it to Abrahara) that built the Temple at
Mecca, and having to wife an Egyptian Idolatresse, had by her twelve sons,
which (as he says) being dispersed in Arabia, Persia, Armenia, sowed so many
sorts of Religion: and Chedar his second son, placed in the Temple of his
father (upon a high Tower called Alquibla) an Idol named Allech and Alleze,
instituting certain ceremonies: and amongst the rest, the sacrificing of a
Ram, in remembrance of that Ram which was presented to his grandfather
Abram at the offering of Isaac. Of Chedar Fortalitium fidei reckons another
genealogy: and the Saracen Chronicle continues this, even from Adam; not
agreeing with themselves or any truth.

Mudicita Hudhatfa, Chinene, Anascere, Melich, Phasce, Paliff, Lunai, Cabnai,
Morta, Chalef, Facien, Abdamanef, Abdalmutalif, Abdalla the supposed father of
Mahumet: His mothers name was Hennina or Henima a Iewesse (as some
l.Bo.Ben.Volater.etc.
write) his father was an Ethnike or Pagan Idolatour. His base condition and
obscurity was such, that the Turks themselves doubt whether he were an Arabian
or Persian, notwithstanding that genealogicall table. Christ.Richer.
Richerius reports that he was a Cyrenean by birth, and that in the time of
his minority or childhood, he was by some Plagiary stolen away from his
friends, and sold to the Ismaelite-merchants. Others say, that he was
abandoned both of father and mother, and (according to the cruel custom of
that barbarous people) sold to strangers; From so base a beginning did this
cunning impostor and seducer of the World arise, to be the scourge of Princes,
and disturber of the World.

He was comely of person, and of sharp wit, Vid. p.202.
and therefore was made ouerseer of the business of Abdalmutalef his Master,
or (as some say) his Grandfather: and traded for him in Soria, Egypt, and
Persia, and after his death, inherited his goods: Continuing his trade of
merchandise with a great man of Cotozan, he succeeded him in his bed and
wealth, by the marriage of his widow Gadisa (whom Arab.Nob.in Alcor.^esut.
others call Adega the daughter of Hulert) and that (as some suspect not
improbably) by the help of sorceries and incantations. With this widow, after
she was become his wife; he lived in his wonted course of life thirteen
years, and had by her one son, and three daughters. And by this means grown
great, he aspired higher; assembling to himself a company of thieves,
unthrifts, and outlawes, which with him became voluntaries and Adventurers in
the wars of the Emperor Heraclius against the Persians: in which he
valourously behaved himself, and was there wounded in the visage, and Cosdroes
the Persian King was overcome.

After this, Mahomet, devising further how to satisfy his ambitious desire of
soueraignety, met with occasion fitting those his aspiring designs. The
Arabians being denied their pay (as is said) raised a mutiny, This mutiny
according to others happened many years after that Mahumet had under the cloak
of Religion furthered his ambition and rebellion.
and rebellion: These chose Mahumet to be their Captain, who used them as his
instruments of robbery and violence about the countries of Mecca. But the
Nobles opposing themselves against him; he, perceiving that their power and
authority would be a perilous rub in his way, thought it his safest course
to insinuate with them, and therefore sought by alliance to win their better
liking, taking some of their daughters to his wives: of which he had at one
time eleven, and in all his life fifteen, besides two slaves.

Heraclius at that time favoring the heresy of the Monothelites, and
neglecting the affairs of the Empire, Mahumets proiects took better effect.
Hummar also and Mauchia caused all Soria, Iudaea and Egypt to rebel. Sergius
at that time a Nestorian Monk of Constantinople (thence for that heresy
excommunicated) resorting to Mahumet, kindled these sparks into a great fire,
persuading him to countenance his rebellion, with the pretense of religion; the
rather now that Heraclius had offended the Christians by his exactions and
heresies, and the Jews, by new cruelties, because by Magic he had been
warned to beware of the circumcised Nation. Thus some male contented Jews, and
some heretical Christians being called to counsel, it was agreed, that he
should profess himself to be chosen in this turbulent state of the world, to
bring unto the same a New Laws, appointed heereunto by Divine authority: to the
Jews affirming himself their expected Messiah; to the Christians promising
amiddest so many heresies Therule of Truth; to the excommunicate heretics,
restitution of their persons and goods; to servants, liberty; to subjects,
immunitie from tribute.

And thus he caused himself of Sergius to be baptized, and to be He neither
was circumcised himself, (says an Arabian nobleman in confutation of the
Alcoran) nor did command anything thereof in his Iawe.
circumcised also of Abdalla a Jew, having before been a Paynime. After he
got himself into a cave two miles from the Town called Garhe, continuing
there two years in company of Sergius and Abdalla, which acquainted him with
the Christian and Jewish Principles: and in the night resorted to his wife,
whom he persuaded to this vain belief by Zeidinus his servant, rewarding
him therefore with freedom, and proclayming (as by an Edict from Heaven) the
like liberty to all servants of all sorts, which would follow him. This rout
resorting to him, and by their numbers strengthening his faction, their masters
not alittle aggreeued, gave out a rumor, that Mahumet was mad, and possessed
of a Devil, and that an evil end would befall him and his followers. And
although they might have gotten him into their hands, yet in regard of his nine
uncles, and some noble Families linked with him in kindred, viz. the
Corassists, the Hassinists, the Benitamines, they abstained from further rigor.

Thus with the help of Sergius and Sansauino calls him Bacira, and adds
also Nicholas a Priest of Rome.
Baira a Iacobite, and Cillienus, in the cave, with the favor of his two
uncles, Hanza and Alabem at Mecca, with his elder brother (that took his
daughter Fatima) and Eubocara (a chief man of that place, after his father in
law) he composed after his and their pleasure Constitutions and Canons, and
published the same at Mecca; with protestation that the Angel Gabriel had been
sent to him from God, as in old times to the prophets, to teach him these
things. And in the first place commanding them to believe in God the Creator of
heaven and earth, the causer of raines and fruits, that inflicts death on men,
and after raises them up to give them either, in reward of their good works,
paradise; or of their bad, hell; and such other things, never before heard of
among these simple idolatrous inhabitants of Mecca, he grew in great estimation.

For in Persia and Arabia, before this time, some worshipped a Tree, which they
called Putulangua, offering sacrifices thereto: some an Idol, called Bliomum;
and some the Sun; and others, other idolatries; spread by the so many sons
of Ismael: and therefore the ruder multitude, astonished with these
Prophetical and Angelical Titles, were easily bewitched. And by degrees he
published his intended wickedness, not sparing outrageous villainies, as
Mahomet a Thief and Murderer.
the stealing of a Camel, the murdering of a Jew sleeping under a Tree. Yea,
he pretended not humane infirmity, but divine authority, to his most
mischievous designments. For example, being lustfully affected to An Adulterer.
Zameb, the daughter of Gaissi, the wife of Zaidi, he writ in his Law, That
after vow or promise of marriage it was lawful for him to enjoy her, and (if
he pleased) to take her to his wife. And being reprehended, that Aissa his wife
A Wittall.
was dishonest with Zaphagam, the son of Almuthathum, the Angel (forsooth)
said, she was chaste. And being found, by his wives, with Marie the wife of
Macobe, the King of the Iacobites, he in another Chapter is absolved of his
oath, and free to lie with any woman, not being able to contain himself,
notwithstanding he had sworn so to do. And by the same authority he enjoined
them penance, for blaming the Prophet. And willing to divorce one of his wives,
but fearing the greatness of her kindred, he frames one Chapter, blaming him
for fearing men more then God.

He wants not his miracles also in his Legend. As he iourneyed in the heat of
the day Mahomets miracles.
with his Camels, a Cloud covered his head from the scorching heat of the
Sun, about the seventeenth year of his age. And when he first entered the
Cave, he saw the Angel Gabriel in his proper shape, with white wings on a Seat
of Gold betwixt Heaven and Earth, who brought him his Prophecy: and going to
Mecca to tell his wife; the Beasts, Trees, Stones, and Herbs saluted him with
the name of a Prophet and a Messenger of GOD; and the trunk of a Tree standing
in the way, divided it self for him to pass between, and then after closed
again. He also, to satisfy his incredulous uncle Bugellinus, caused the
Moon to descend from Heaven, and entered into his sleeue, and after parted it
self in two, and then ascended again. To satisfy the peoples doubtings, he
caused a Bull (taught before to come at his call) to bring on his horns a
Chapter, which he there had tied, to testify the truth of Mahomet.

But while the fame of this his Prophetical Function filled the mouths of the
vulgar with acclamations, it no less filled the hearts of the Nobles of Mecca
with disdain, who sought therefore to apprehend him; but he closely fled to
From this slight they begin the computation of their Hegira.
Ietrib or Medina with his followers, where he lived with the name of a Prophet
thirteen years. He deprived a certain Carpenters poor Orphans of their
patrimony, and consecrated their House into a Temple. This City being for
most part inhabited with Jews, they asked a sign in confirmation of his
Office. He said, That he was not sent with miracles, but denuntiation of Arms
here, and Hell hereafter: and those which would not receive his new Doctrine,
he expelled by force. Being absolute Lord here, he aspired also to the
Dominion of Mecca. He sent thirty horse with Hanzeta to rob the Merchants,
traveling thither: but being then prevented, he sent, four years after, six
hundred of his best soldiers, under Hngaida, to assault Mecca, but he also was
discomfited: yet not desisting his enterprise, seven years after he achieved
it, and after eleven battles entered and sacked the Town, and gave the spoil
to his soldiers: and for fear, the neighbouring-Cities submitted themselves.
Mahomet herewith encouraged, assaulted the Persians and Egyptians, exchanging
with those he conquered his New Religion for their old wealth and liberty,
binding the Governors thereunto. But now being old, and through his
intemperances weak, and diseased also with the Falling Sickness, he colored
his often falling with pretext of Gabriels brightness, and the insufferable
splendor of his presence.

He was of mean stature, large sinews, brown color, broad face, with a cut
lip, and had one of his fore-teeth stricken out in one Expedition, and in
another his face wounded. He had a great head, thin hairs, long shankes, not
proportionable to his head. He was of few words, but deceitful; covetous, and
withal prodigal, (but of other men's goods) and in deeds of lust equalling
himself to forty other men, or (as some say) fifty. When he was threescore
and three years of age, in the month of July, Anno 645. he died; of which, he
lived in trade of Merchandise thirty eight, and in the Cave two; at Mecca
ten, in Medina thirteen. He had commanded, that they should not bury him;
for that on the third day after he would ascend in body and soul into Heaven.
Meane-while the earth being poisoned with the stink of his carcass, they
buried him, not at Mecca (as some affirm) but at Medina. His Law, in his life
time, sustained many alterations; Cellenus his Scribe writing what himself
pleased: and the several parcels of the same being collected by Odmen, one of
his successors, this Book was thereupon called Alcaron, that is, a Summarie,
or Collection of Precepts. Thus Mahomet aduantaged himself with the mutinous
Rebels, Fugitives, Unthrifts, Apostata-Iewes, and heretical Christians in that
diseased State of the Empire: the body whereof was afflicted on the East by
the Persians, on the West by the Goths and other Barbarians, and fretted
within the own bowels by intestine rebellions: the Soul thereof being no
less torn and rent by the Sects and Heresies of the Arrians, Donatists,
Nestorians, Pelagians, and others. He fishing in these troubled waters, set on
foot his new Religion, to bring light to the Gentiles, and to mitigate to the
Jews and Christians the severity of the Law and Gospel. But the Mahumetanes
themselves do report otherwise, fabling of this fabler great matters, as if he
had been the Promise and Hope of Nations, and the most excellent personage of
the World.

They have written a Book of the generation of Mahomet to this effect: Legend
of Mahomet, Hemanno Dalmata interpret.
The Book of the generation of Mahomet, the Messenger of GOD, (the Prayer and
Salvation of GOD be upon him) from Adam and Eve to the time when GOD brought
him forth, gracious, perfect, and fit for himself. When as Kabachbar had
learned out of the These Prophets were Abnabdall^, Abnalmutaira, Abuzaid,
Abamachumet, Alabez, Alfad, Abulambez, Ezerigi, Abnamare, Kabalchabar (
scholar of Kabelmedi) or Kabalachbar
Scriptures, and by Astrology, that his Prophet should be borne to the world,
he heard, That there was a man borne in Ieseras, a City of Arabia, having all
such marks and tokens, as he had foreseen by the Prophecies and his Art,
viz. a spot on his forehead, a print between his shoulders, etc. And to
satisfy his desire, he went thither to see; where finding those tokens
fulfilled in young Mahomet, he thereupon expounded the dark mystery of his
farre-fetched Light, learned of his Master Kabelmedi in this manner: When Adam
was newly created, as he stood up, his brain shaked and made a noise, as the
leaves do, which are shaken with the wind: whereat Adam wondering, GOD said
unto him, The sound which thou have heard is the sign of the Prophets and
Messengers of my Commandments. Take heed therefore that thou commit this
Seed of Light only to worthy Loins, and to a clean Womb. And this A
Mahumetan Chronicle says, That this Light claue to the hands of God two
thousand years before Adam, worshipping him as the Angels; after enclosed in
the Rib of Adam, etc.
Light of Mahomet that should be borne, shined from the face of Adam, as the
Sun or Moon at the full. And when he had begotten Seth, that Light passed
instantly from the face of Adam into the face of Eve, insomuch, that the birds
of the Air, and beasts of the Earth, wondered at her beauty. Yea, the Angels
every day saluted her, and brought her odours out of Paradise, till she brought
forth Seth alone, having before, at every burden, brought forth a brother and
a sister.

Seth inherited this light, which remained between heaven and earth, the
Angels thereby ascending and descending upon Seth, and crying always, Retoyce
thou earth, worthy of the light of Mahomet, on him be the prayer and salvation
of God. Adam drawing near to his end, declared unto him, by his Testament, the
mystery of that Light, and the Genealogy of the Prophets. Then descended
Gabriel, accompanied with threescore and ten thousand Angels, bearing every
one of them a white leaf and a pen, which signed the writing, for the
continuance of the order of the Prophetical generation. Seth received this
writing, and was clothed with a double read garment, shining as the Sun, and
soft as the violet-flower.

From him it passed by succession to Noe and Sem; then to Abraham, at whose
birth to Lights from the East and West (meeting in the midst) lightened the
whole World: and the Angels were heard singing, That it was the Light of the
Prophet Mahomet, who should be borne of his Seed, whose Word should be in the
virtue of GOD. This Light passed from Abraham to the face of Hagar, being with
child, and after to Ismael; and God told him, That the Soul of Mahomet, in
the beginning of the Creation, was mingled with his, and that his name in
Heaven should be Asmet, in Earth Mahomet, in Paradise Abualtrazim. At this Sara
grieved, until three Angels comforted her with the promise of Isaac. From
Ismael it removed to Keidar his son, who being endued with Sound,
courageous, fair, swift, just, a Hunter, and Archer.
seven Gifts, married Nulta of the Land of Isaac, but, being warned by an
Oracle, he took to wife Algadira, an Arabian; and after, by divine warning,
carried the chest of this Light unto Jacob. Then was Hamel borne to him, and
received the same Light; in which succeeded Thebicht, Hamiessa, Adeth, Aduve,
Adne, Machat, Nizar, Musar, Aliez, Madraca, Horeima, Knieua, Anofra, Melic,
Falhrem, Luie, Galiben, Kab, Murran, Cudai, Abdamenef, Hefim, a man by divine
testimony free of all uncleanness. To him did all Kings offer their
daughters in marriage, and among the rest Constantine, which he refused, and
married Seline the daughter of Zeit, and had by her Abdalmutalib, whose Light
caused rain in drought. To him an Elephant prostrated himself, and said with
man's voice, Salvation be on you, and on the Light that shines out of your
Reiues, Dignity, Fame, Honor, and Victory be on you: and that there should
proceed from him a King, greater then all the Kings of the Earth. Another
time, as he slept on the stone which was placed by Abraham in his Oratorie at
Mecca, he dreamed of a chain reaching East and West, and to Heaven, and to
the Depth, which was presently converted into a flourishing herb. Noe and
Abraham presented themselves interpreters of this Dream. Abdalla his son,
the father of Mahomet, had a tutor given unto him, to defend him from his
enemies, who seemed a man, but was none. He was preserved from the lying in
wait of the Jews, by threescore and ten Angels, which seemed men. He wedded
or Hemina, daughter of Abdemenef.
Ermina, and therefore two hundred women perished for his love; some hanging,
some burning themselves.

When the prescribed time was come, in the month Dulheia, on a Friday night,
God bad Ariduvan to open the gates of Paradise, that the innermost of his
secret might be manifested: for it pleases me (says he) this night to
transport the Light of my Prophet from the reins of Abdalla into the womb of
Ermina, and that it come into the world. This being done, as Abdalla, the Judge
and Lord of the Arabians, went into the house of Prayer, he perceived a great
Light to lighten from his house up toward Heaven, and presently died. On the
twelfth day of Rab, on a Tuesday, Mahomet was borne, circumcised, and all
frolic. And then all Idols fell and became black: All Kingdoms were
destroyed, and not one stood upright. Lucifer was cast into the bottom of the
Sea, and in forty days could not get out, and then called his fellows, and
told them, that Mahomet was borne with the power of the sword, who would take
away all their power. The same also God caused to be proclaimed in Heaven and
Earth. His mother said, That she was delivered of him without pain, and
Angelical birds came to nourish the child, and that a man clothed in white
presented him with three keys, like to Pearls, which he took; the key of
Victory, the key of the Laws, and the key of Prophecy. And after came three
persons with shining faces, presenting him a cauldron of Emeralds, with four
handles, which Mahomet accepted as a sign of his rule over all the world. The
Birds, Clouds, Winds, Angels, contended for the nourishment of the child. But
the case was determined by heavenly voice, affirming, That he should not be
taken from the hands of men. An Ass, almost famished, worshipped him, and
receiving him on her back, became Herald to this new Prophet, with man's voice
proclaiming the worthiness of her Carriage. Three men carried him up into a
Mountain: of which, one of them opened him from the Breast unto the Navel,
and washed his entrails with snow: the second cleared his heart in the
midst, and took out of it a black grain, saying, That it was the portion
of the Devil. The third made him whole again. Seraphim nourished him three
years, and Gabriel nine and twenty, who gave unto him, in the fortieth year
of his age, the Law, and carried him to Heaven. This his journey is related by
Friar Richard sometimes a student in the University of Baldach, Cap. 14. and
in his life See also Bellon. obseruat. lib.3.c.7.


Gabriel, with threescore and ten pair of wings, came to Mahomet, in the
chamber of Aissa, his best beloved wife, and said, That GOD would have him to
visit him where he is; and brought with him the Beast Elmparac, or Alborach, of
nature between a Mule and an Ass. This Beast told Mahomet, That he would not
take him on his back, till he had prayed to GOD for him. His steps were as
far as one could see, so that in the twinkling of an eye he had brought
Mahomet to Jerusalem. Then Gabriel with his Girdle tied the Beast to a Rock,
and La ^^^^ Mahometi says, In a shin^ ng ladder they went up to Heaven, where
the stars hung by golden chains, as big as Mount Notho by Medina.
carried Mahomet on his shoulders into Heaven; where he knocked, and the
Porter opened. Here Mahomet saw There were in the first Heaven Angels of the
shapes of all creatures, praying for the creatures of their shapes: and a
Cock, whose feet touched one Heaven, and head the other, whose crowing moved
the Cocks of the earth to do so. In the second was Noe. This Heaven was of
Gold; the third of Pearls, wherein was Abraham and the huge huge Angel of
Death, with his book and pennein hand, writing the times of men's lives: (which
fatal opinion makes them hardy) The fourth was of Emerald: here was Joseph
and the Angel of Compassion weeping for the sins of men. The fifth of
Diamond, and in it Moses. The sixth of Rubie, and in it John Baptist. The
seventh of Fire, and in it JESUS CHRIST. All these recommended themselves to
his Prayers.
troops of Angels, and prayed twice on his knees for them: and amongst the
rest, old old Father Adam, rejoicing for such a son, and commending him to
his prayers. Then he brought him to the second Heaven, which was a journey of
five hundred years, and so forth on to the seventh Heaven: Here he saw the
Angelical people, every of which was a thousand times greater than the world,
and every of them had threescore and ten thousand heads, and every head
threescore and ten thousand mouths, and every mouth seventeen hundred
tongues, praying GOD in seven hundred thousand Languages. And he saw one Angel
weeping, and he asked the cause, who answered, That he was Sin. And Mahomet
prayed for him. Then Gabriel commended him to another Angel, and he to
another, and so forth in order, till he came before GOD and his Throne. Then
GOD (whose face was covered with threescore and ten thousand clothes of
light, and from whom Mahomet stood two stones cast below) touched him with his
hand, the coldness whereof pierced to the marrow of his backe-bone. And GOD
said, I have imposed on thee and on thy people Prayers. When he was returned as
far as the fourth Heaven, Moses counseled him to return back, to obtain
ease unto the people, which could not bear so many prayers, which he did
oftentimes, till there remained but few. Thus returning to his Elmparac, he
rode back to his house at Mecca. All this was done in the tenth part of the
night. But when he was requested to do thus much in the peoples sight, he
answered, Praised be GOD, I am a Man, and an Apostle.

The Book Asear (says Bellonius) tells further, That in this journey
Mahomet heard a woman's voice, crying, Mahomet, Mahomet, but he held his peace.
Afterward another called him, but he gave no answer. Mahomet asked the Angel
who they were? He answered, That the one was she which published the Jews
Law, and if he had answered her, all his Disciples should have been Jews: the
other was she which delivered the Gospel, whom if he had answered, all his
followers had been Christians.

The said Book tells, That GODS face was covered with threescore and ten
thousand Linen Clothes made of Light, and that GOD gave him a fiuefold
privilege. First, That he should be the highest creature in Heaven or Earth:
Secondly, the most excellent of the sons of Adam: Thirdly, An universal
Redeemer: Fourthly, Skillful in all Languages: Fifthly, That the spoils of
Wars should be given him. Gabriel after (says that Book) carried him to
Hell, to see the secrets thereof, and the seven gates thereof, etc. where (as
in the place fittest for him) we will leave him. The Book of the virtues of
Mahomet says, That in glorying of his strength he would boast, that he had
known his eleven wives successively in one hour.

One of their Chronicles tells of his martial affairs. This Chronicle
reckons from Adam to Noe one thousand two hundred two and forty years: From
thence to Abraham, one thousand and fourscore: Hence to Moses, five hundred
and fifteen: After him to David, five hundred threescore and nine: and from
this time to CHRIST, one thousand three hundred and fifty: from whence to
Mahomet is numbered six hundred and twenty; in all five thousand three hundred
threescore and sixteen, from Adam to Mahomet. All the Prophets were in number
an hundred and siventie thousand, and the Messengers of GOD three hundred and
fifteen: where of Adam, Seth, Esdrik. Noe, Abraham, were Hebrews; Huth,
Schale, Ishmael, Schaib, Mahomet were Arabians.

If this History of Mabomets life be long and tedious, I thought good, out of
an Arabian Chronicle, to add this Epitome thereof. His mother died in a
journey to Mecca, when he was four years old, and his Nurse restored him to
his Grandfather Abdalmutalif. with whom he lived eight years. The Seraphim
preserved him, but was never seen. After that, Gabriel was his Guardian, of
whom he received the Law, which he kept close three years, communicating it
only to some of his own opinion, by whose help he became Priest and Prince
of the Arabians and and Saracens, and about eighteen months after was carried
into Heaven, and being returned into the Earth, he took Eubocara, Ali, and
Zaid to be his companions in this enterprise. He went to Zaif, or Atharf, and
preached publicly, and thence to Mecca, ten years going from place to
place. And of his Conuerts, he chose some for guard of his Person, who swear
the observance of his Law, to the number of forty, who now with Word, now with
the Sword, set forward this Doctrine. After ten years, Mecca was peopled
only with believers; and all Arabia was converted, without difficulty. Then
he sent to the neighboring Kings to become of his Religion; to the King of
Persia, to the Roman Emperor, to King Cinna, to the Lord of the two Seas, to
the King of Aethiopia, etc. After he returned to Iehib, and on Tuesday, the
twelfth of Rab, in the eleventh year, died. His Sepulture was appointed by GOD
in the House of Aisca his wife, in the Chamber where he was wont to sleep,
where, at this day, is a Temple of Brick. His body was wrapped in throe white
Clothes, without any pomp. His Seal was a Silver Ring, with this inscription,
MAHOMET the Messenger of GOD. He went twice on Pilgrimage, and nineteen times
conducted an Army.

The place of his burial is at Medina, surnamed of him Talnabi Nabi, a Prophet.
, that is, of the Prophet; not (as some write) at Mecca. Neither does his
Corpse hang in the air by force of Load-stones, drawing up his Iron Coffin or
Chest, but lies buried in the ground (if any where) as Ludouicus Vertom^^us,
by his own view, has observed. Of this place, and of Mecha, we shall speak
more, in relating the Rites of the Pilgrims that visit them.

Some relate otherwise of the death of Mahomet, as that he died at forty
years of age, being poisoned by one of his Disciples, called Albunor, to make
trial of his boasting Prophecy, that he would rise again within three days
after his death. The book of the Policy of the Turkish Empire.
This Albuner after coming to see him, found his body torn in pieces, and
devoured of dogs: whereupon gathering together the bones that remained, into
a Coffin, he caused them to be buried. Which in my mind is not so probable as
the former report.

Of the Alcoran, or Alfurcan, containing the Mahumetane Law: the sum and
contents thereof.

THe Book of Mahomets Law is called by the name of Alcoran, which signifies a
collection of Precepts; and Alfurcan, (as it is expressed and expounded in a
Book Harman. Dal. interpret.
called the Exposition or Doctrine of the Alcoran) because the sentences and
figures thereof are severed and distinguished. For the Word of GOD, (says
Mahomet in that Book) came not to me all at once, as the Law unto Moses, the
Psalms to David, and the Gospel to CHRIST. The Sentences or Chapters thereof

(a great Critic, and reputed one of the greatest Linguists in the world)
affirms, That that Language is not capable of metricall measures by
quantities of Syllables; as neither the Hebrew, Abyssine, or Syrian. He says
yet, That the Alcoran is composed in Rhyme, but such, as is not in any tunable
proportion; but that word which makes up the Rhyme, being sometimes nearer, and
sometimes far beyond all harmony, distanc from that word whereto it
answers. At the end of such Rimes are set the figures of Flowers, or some
such matter: which if it be so, the Turkish nicetie of making no likeness of
any thing in their Carpets, or other Works, is stricter then these

Mahometanes, who use their liberty in this point.

were diverse; and after Mahomets death made (if it could be) worse, at least
otherwise, then he left them. For Hali had one Copy left him by Mahomet, which
the Jews corrupted, adding, racing, changing at their pleasure, and promised
him their assistance, if he would profess himself a Prophet. But Ozimen
commanded all the Books to be brought and delivered into the hands of Zeidi
and Abdalla, to bring all into one Book, and, where they dissented, to read
after the Copy of Corais, and to burn all the rest.

They thus composed the Alcoran, whereof they left four Copies, which after
were lost. And yet Hali, Abitalib, and Ibenmuzed then refused to deliver up
their Books: Whereupon arose diverse Readings, and afterward diverse Schisms;

is as it were their Creed: the rest are all delivered as the words of GOD; he
being induced as speaker. The first is in this sense. In the name of the
merciful and pitiful GOD. Thanks be unto GOD the LORD of the world,
merciful, pitiful, Judge at the day of Judgment. We pray unto thee: we trust
in thee. Lead us into the right way, the way of them whom thou have chosen,
not of them with whom thou art angry, and of the Infidels.

Of Of God and Christ.
GOD he Azo. 12^.
writes further, that he is One, necessary to all, incorporeall, which
neither has begotten, nor is begotten, nor has any like him: the Creator,
long-suffering, searcher of the heart, true. That he will confound
enchantments, that without his gift, none can believe (this his Alcoran,) that
he has no son, for he needs nothing Az. 20.
, and he which sets a second in the place of GOD shall go into hell, Az.31.
and he has no partaker, 32. yet in Azoar. 67. he induces God speaking thus:
To CHRIST the SON of Mary we have given the Gospel, that by him men may
obtain the love and favor of God: and that the believers amongst them
(Christians) shall receive a great reward: as also in Az.. 2. he says, Every
one whosoever lives rightly, be he Jew or Christian, or if he leaves his own
Law, and embrace another, if he worship God, and do good, shall undoubtedly
obtain Divine favor. Of the birth of CHRIST he wrireth thus, Azo. 29. We sent
our Spirit to Mary (the best of all women, and the womb untouched, Azoar.31.)
in likeness of a man, professing himself a Dluine messenger concerning a
Son, etc. And when she in travel plained, CHRIST came from under her, and
said, Fear not: and when some chidde with her about the child, the child it
self made answer, I am the Servant and Prophet of GOD. He says, the Jews
did not slay CHRIST, but one like him, Azo. 11. and vpbraideth them, for not
receiving him, Azo. and chap. 4. To CHRIST, the Son of Mary, properly
communicating our own soul, we have given him strength and power more then
other Prophets: yet chap.14. he excuses that worship which is done him and his
mother.

Concerning Of his law, and the followers thereof.
his Law and Alcoran, he handles it in the second Chapter or Azoara, which
begins thus. In the name of the merciful and pitiful God. This book
without any false-hood or error, showing the truth (to them which love, fear,
and worship God, and are studious of prayers and alms) and the observation of
the laws given of God from heaven to thee and other thy predecessors, and the
hope of the world to come, has manifested the true sect. For this brings the
followers thereof to the highest, inricheth them with the highest good, as to
the unbelievers and erroneous, it menaceth truly the greatest evil to come.
This he after applies to Paradise and hell. This his Alcoran he calls the
establishing of the Law of the Israelites: and Azo. 21. he arrogateth to his
book wisdom and eloquence: and 47. he says, Azoara 47.
it was composed of the incomprehensible and wise God, every where agreeing
with it self, and calls it (63) the book of Abraham: and (69.) if it should
be placed on a mountain, that mountain for divine fear would be dissolved.
Those which will not be converted, take and slay, by all means intrapping
them: and fight against them till they be your tributaries and subjects. The
fifteenth part of all the prey is due unto God, and his Prophet, and to your
kindred and orphans, and the poor. Those that are taken in war kill or make
slaves; but pardon them if they will turn to your law, and God also will
pardon them. Such good warriors shall have full pardon. The Jews and
Christians (contrary to that he had said before) let God confound. He has
sent his messenger with the right way and good law, that he may manifest and
extol it above all laws. Of the twelve months four are to be consecrated to
fight against the enemies. Those that refuse this war-fare lose their souls.
The fire of hell is hotter then the danger of war. And although thou
(Prophet) should pardon the resisters of God and his messenger seventy
times, yet God will never pardon them. The sick and weak, and such as have
not necessaries, are excused from this necessity of war: but to the good
warriors God gives Paradise, in reward of their souls and goods, whether
they kill or be killed. Azo. 18.19. And in 57. Kill the unbelievers whom you
conquer, till you have made great slaughter. God could take vengoance on them,
but he chooses rather to do it by you: he shall lay deafness and blindness
on the fainthearted. Yet in 52. and 98. as contrary to himself he affirms,
that he is sent only to teach, not to compel and force men to believe: except
we expound it rather, that Jews, Christians, and all unbelievers, are
compelled to be tributaries, and their slaves; not forced to their religion,
but instructed only; which agrees with their practice. From this doctrine, and
that of destiny in the 50. Az. has risen their forwardnes to the war, and
the greatness of their conquests. Agreeable to this doctrine is their manner
of teaching it: the Reader or Preacher (as says Friar Richard, student amongst
them in the University of Baldach) holds a bare sword in his hand, or
sets it up in an eminent place, to the terror of the gainsayers.

But disputation Mahomet disclaimeth Divine miracles, and humane disputations,
proving with the sword.
and reasoning about his law he utterly disliketh. Az.32. To such as will
dispute with thee, answer that God knows all thy doings, which in the last
day shall determine all controversies. And 50. Nothing but evil cleaves to
the heart of such as unwisely dispute of Divine Precepts: but commend thou thy
self unto God, that knows all things. And chap. 4. 15. He is commanded to
go away from such. This book is given to take away discord from men: miracles
he disclaimeth as insufficient proof; for though it should make plain the
mountains, and make the dead to speak, yet they would be incredulous: But it
is thy duty only to show them my Precepts, Aza. 23.

Of the Creation.
Creation he affirms ( Azo.2.) that when God had made the world, he disposed
the seven heavens: he told the Angels he would make one like unto himself in
the earth: they answer, we in all things are subject to your Majesty, and
give praise unto you: but he will be wicked and a shedder of blood. Then God
testifying, that he knew a thing not known to the Angels, taught Adam the
names of things by himself, not known to the Angels, and therefore commanded
the Angels to do reverence before Adam, which wicked Beelzebub said he was made
of fire, and therefore better then he which was made of earth. Azo.17.
Beelzebub refused; they obeyed. And Azo. 25. We made man of clay, and I
breathed into him a portion of mine own soul, after that I had created the
devil of Pestiferous fire; and because Beelzebub refused to humble himself to
this man (made of black mire) he was damned, and when he desired respite till
the resurrection, it was denied: and therefore he said he would teach all evil
things, that they shall not give thee thanks, etc. Of the Angels he affirms
(45.) that some of them have two wings, some three, some four: and (52.) the
heaven would fall upon men, were it not for the Angels that call upon God.
There they shall possess rings of gold, chains, jewels, clothed with cloth of
gold; their beds shall be of gold, and this for ever.

Of Paradise.
Paradise he dreameth in this sort, Az. 65. He which fears God shall receive
the two Paradises full of all good, pleasant with streaming fountains. There
they shall lie on silken and purple carpets, and shall be accompanied with many
maidens, beautiful as the Hyacinth and pearls, never deflowred of men or
Devils, never menstruous, sitting in pleasant shades with their eyes fixed on
their husbands: their eyes large, with the white of them exceeding white, and
the black very black, lying on the shining green. The Turks Paradise a
beastly carnal one.
Fair young men shall serve them with vials and other vessels, full of the most
excellent liquor, which shall neither cause-head-ach, not drunkenness, and
shall bring them the choicest fruits, and flesh of fowls. They shall there
hear no silthie or displeasing word: and ( Azo. 86.) In Paradise shall be
administered to them in well-wrought vessels of glass and silver, drink, as
the sauourie ginger, out of the fountain Zelzebil: they shall have garments of
silk and gold, chains of filuer, blessed wine, maidens likewise with pretty
breasts: there tall trees of color between yellow and green. They shall have
in Paradise all pleasures, and shall enjoy women with eyes fair, and as great
as eggs: sweet smelling rivers of milk, and honey, and fruits of all sorts. Of
this Paradise, Auicenna (a Mahumetan) says, that it concerns the body, but
wise Divines more respect the mind; the felicity whereof, in conjunction with
truth, they far prefer before the other of the body.

Of Hell Of Hell.
he fableth that it has seven gates; that it shall make the wicked like to
fleas, that they shall be fed with the tree Ezecum, which shall burn in their
bellies like fire, that they shall drink fire; and being holden in chains of
seventy cubits, shall be kept sure; the fire shall cast forth embers like
towers or camels. They which contradict shall be punished with the fire of
hell: they which fear, shall go into Paradise; and as it were in a Of
Purgatory.
middle space betwixt the one and the other, there shall stand some other with
hope and expectation of Paradise. We have set Angels over hell, and have
appointed their numbers (84.) 98. There shall be fountains of scalding
waters, and they shall eat upon a reed, but shall not satisfy their hunger:
they shall be bound in chains, 121.

He Of the Prophet Mahomet.
sometime excuses his own baseness, as Azo. 36. The unbelievers (says he)
murmr that he is followed only of Weauers, and the raskall-rout. And 53. That
the Alcoran was not committed to a man of great possessions: and they say, that
it is Artmagicke, and that I have fained it. And in 64. The Moon was divided,
and they say it is sorcery. (The tale is told by Friar Richard thus: Mahomet
pointed to the Moon with his thumb, and middle finger, and it was divided,
the two pieces falling on the hills of Mecha, which entering into Mahomets coat
was made whole again) He Mahomet guilty of his witchcraft, often speaks of
it: that he may not be thought such a one.
sometime extolleth himself, blasphemously inducing CHRIST, thus saying to the
Israelites; O ye Israelites, I being sent a messenger unto you from GOD,
affirm by the Testament which I have in my hand, that a Messenger shall come
after me, whose name is Mahomet, of whom they shall say that he is a Magician.
71. His beastly prerogative he boasts, (43.) saying, he is the seal and last
of the Prophets. To thee O Prophet, we make it lawful to lie with all women
which are given thee, or which thou buyest, and thy Aunts, thy kindred, and all
good women which freely desire thy company, if thou be willing: and this is
permitted to thee alone. Divorce these, couple thy self to those at thy
pleasure. And being by some other of his wives found in bed with Mary the wife
of a Iacobite Christian, he swear that he would never after use her company:
but after being impotent in his lusts, he ordaines a law to himself, Az. 76.
Why do thou, O Prophet, make that lawful, for the love of thy women, which
GOD has made unlawful? GOD full of pity, and giver of pardon, has commanded
thee to blot out, or cancel thine oaths.

Of his journey to heaven, to receive the Law, he speaks. Az. 63. and 82.
mingling injunctions of devotion. 83. Thou, O Prophet, rising in the night,
spend half the night, or a little more or less, in watching, and continually
and devoutly read over the Alcoran: be thou just, patient, and refuse not to
wash thy garments, O thou man clothed in woollen. 43. Let none enter into the
house of the Prophet before he call; but let him stand without the gate: let
none do dishonestie within his house, let none hurt the Prophet in anything, or
have his wife after him.

Some Of the Prophets in Scripture.
Prophets he mentions, not named in Scripture; and of those there named he
tells many fables. Ismael was a true Prophet, and found a good man before
GOD. Joseph nine years imprisoned for the Queen. Abraham overthrew his
fathers Idols, and should have been burned for the same; but the fire lost his
force. The mountains and birds that praise GOD, were subject to David. Such
tales as these of Abraham, Solomon, etc. you shall find both in the Jewish and
Popish Legends, as if the Jew, Papist and Mahumetan, had contended for the
whetstone: which any one that reads shall find.
Solomon learned Magic of Arot and Marot, Devils so called: he knew the
language of birds; and when he was in the midst of his army, consisting of
devils, men, and birds: the Lapwing brought him news of the Queen of Saba's
coming, to whom by this Lapwing he sent a letter, etc. Of this army the Ants
or Pisinires being afraid; one Ant persuaded her fellows to get them into
their holes, lest they should be trodden on. Moses married Pharaohs daughter.
(37.) One Aseemel made the golden Calfe in the desert against Aarons will,
Pharaoh requested Hemen to build a tower, whereon to climb to heaven, to the
GOD of Moses. (50.) In the time of Noe they worshipped Idols, whom he names
Huden, Schnan, Iaguta, Iannea, Nacem.

The Prophet Huth was sent to the nation Haath, to teach them the worship of
one GOD: and Schale to Themuth; and Schaibe to Madian; and Abraham and Lot to
the Sodomites; on whom, because they were incredulous, it rained yellow and
sharp stones. ( Az. 21.) Moses was sent to Pharaoh, etc. His scope of these
narrations is, that he is sent likewise a Prophet, and therefore judgment will
pursue them which refuse him, as it did those incredulous nations. These savor
of a Jewish help. He tells also of Alexander Alexander, Mahomets fittest
Saint to follow.
Mag, that he had all knowledge: he found the Sun, where it lay resting in a
yellow fountain, and the mountains in which it rises. And finding men
without use of speech, he divided them from other men, etc. Az.28.

He proves Of the resurrection and last judgment.
substantially that there shall be a resurrection, by the history of the seven
Sleepers, which slept in a cave 360. years. (28. Az.) and (49.) He says, that
at the time of death, GOD takes away the soul at an hour known, restoring
it to some; to some, never: at the first found of the trumpet all shall die,
except those which shall be protected by the will of GOD: at the second sound
all things shall revive, and be judged: and (66.) The earth shall tremble, the
mountains shall be brought to dust, and the whole company shall be divided
into three parts, before: on the right hand, which shall be blessed; those on
the left hand, in their left hands shall receive the scroll or sentence of
their condemnation. And 79. In the last Judgment the earth shall be
overthrown, the heaven shall be powered forth. 8. Angels shall bear up the
throne of GOD. And (80.) The heavens shall vanish as smoke, and the earth
shall be plucked as wool. And (111.) There shall be set up the balance of
Judgment: they to whom shall befall a light weight, shall live, but they which
have a heavy weight shall be cast into fire. The book of bad works shall be
kept in the bottom of the earth; the book of good works in a high place.

In diverse places of the, Alcoran; the better to color his filthiness, he
has dispersed good sentences, like roses scattered on a dunghill, and flowers
in a puddle: concerning alms, prayer, tithing, justice, etc. Others he has of
another fort establishing his own tyranny and religion. Morals and Iudieials.
Az. 26. Swines-flesh, blood, that which dies alone, and that which has the
neck cut off, not in GODS name, is unlawful, Azoar. 33. 34.
Be chaste every where, but with your own wives, or such as are subject to
you, and do serve you. Every adulterer shall have an hundred stripes in the
presence of many. He which accuses a woman of adultery, not proving it by
four witnesses, shall have eighty. The jealous husband accusing his wife,
must swear four times that he charge her truly; and a fifth time curse
himself, if it be otherwise. The woman must do the like to clear her self.
(43.) After a woman be divorced from one, any other may marry her. (19.) Trust
not a son or a brother, except he be of your own Law. 72. On Friday when
they are called to prayer, they must lay all business apart: when prayers be
ended, they may return to their commodities. Redeem captives; and thy sins,
by good works. About Circumcision I find no iniunction in the Alcoran. In the
3. 8. and 9. Az. He permits all licenciousnesse with all women which they
have of their own: but prescribes washings after venery, and after natural
easements. Love not your enemies: the women of another faith prove first: and
if they favor the unbelievers, divorce them. (70.) It is no sin to revenge
injuries. 52. the women must cover their faces. 43.

The going on Pilgrimage to Mecca.
Pilgrimage, and the perpetual abode at the Temple of Haran (that is,
unlawful, because nothing but their holies are there lawful) we repute of
equal merit. They which love it not, or do it injury, shall sustain grievous
evils. Abraham founded this Temple, and blessed it, and cleansed it, for them
which abode there, and for the pilgrims. He Abraham author of pilgrimage rites.
preached one GOD without partaker, and the pilgrimage to this Temple, that on
the days appointed they might, in naming GOD, sacrifice beasts, wherewith to
feast themselves and the poor, and might fulfill their vows, and go in
procession round about the old Temple, a work which GOD will greatly reward.
Az. 32. and 19. The unbelievers are not worthy to visit the Temple Haran. And
these good pilgrims are not equal to the good warriors. 38. He entered into the
Temple Haran with his head shaven.

Ridiculous is the confirmation of this holy Law, by such variety of oaths,
as I am almost afraid to mention, in regard of our Gull-gallants of these
times, who would sometimes be at a set in their brave and brauing phrases, if
they should not have variety of oaths and curses, to daube up with such
interiections all imperfections of speech, and make smoother way for the
current of their gallantrie. His oaths
But yet even for their sakes, let us mention a few, that they may see Mahomet
had as brave a humor this way as they. He induces GOD swearing by less then
himself, as by the order of Angels, by the Alcoran, by the blowing winds, by
the watery clouds, by the sailing ships, by the Mount Sinai, the heaven, the
sea, the evening Star, the West, his pen and lines, the guilty soul, the
devils, by the morning, ten nights, the Passover, by the figs and olives, by
the dawning, and twilight, and a world more of the like: only he says ( Azoara
1000.) that he may not swear by the earth, nor by the son like to the father.

His last Azoara ends thus, In the names of the merciful and pitiful GOD:
Sanctify thy self, and pray continually and humbly to him which is Lord of
all nations, Lord of all, God of all, that he will defend and deliver thee from
the devil, which enters the hearts of men, and from devilish and perverse
men.

Just dealing.
Be faithful in keeping and delivering their goods, for God takes knowledge
of all accounts. Let one son have as much as two daughters. In bargaining use
no lying, slaying your own soul. The covetous shall have endless punishment:
he that kills unwillingly, shall give to the kindred of the party slain,
another man; or if he cannot do that, let him fast two months together: he
which kills wilfully shall be cast into the fire.

Salute him which saluteth thee, for salutation is much pleasing to God.
Courtesy.
56. The devils hearing the Alcoran, shall be converted, and fly from their
companions.

The Law.
They which first believe, and after deny, and become incredulous, shall have
no pardon nor mercy of God, but shall go into the fire. And (11.) We will
bring infinite evil upon him, that will not obey God and his messenger, and
will be disputing. To them which Not to dispute nor seek a sign in proof of
the Law.
demand that the book may rain upon them from heaven, thou shall say that
some asked a greater thing of Moses, that he would show God unto their eyes,
and were therefore smitten with lightning from heaven. (12.) To the Jews and
Christians God has given disagreements, till God shall determine the same at
the day of judgment. Make not your selves companions of them which deride our
Law. No man receives the perfection of the Law, but he which believes the
Testament, the Gospel, and this book sent of God. 14. They which err will
say, let God show us miracles. These hurt none but their own souls, for if
they should see all The fox will eat no grapes because they are sour, and
hang too high.
miracles done, they would dispute with thee, saying, that they could not be
done but by enchantments. Thou shall not come to them with manifest miracles;
for they would refuse them, as odious things. 15. Dispute not with them which
will not hear; and if they demand miracles, say, God only does them: I know
not the secrets of God, and follow nothing but that which God and the Angel
has commanded: and if Angels should speak to such, they would not believe.
16. God himself and his blessed Spirit have compounded this most true book.
26. 44. They which say his law is new or fained, go to the devil. 47. He
induces some gainsayers, saying, we will not leave worshipping our images for
this iester and rimer. Yet is he alone come with the truth, confirming all the
other messengers. 55. He says I (GOD) writ this book with my own hand. 56.
The unbelievers say I am a Magician, and have fained it: but then I pray GOD
that I may have no part in him when he shall be our Judge. Say not there are
three Gods, but one God alone without a Son, to him all things are subject.
CHRIST cannot deny but that he is subject to GOD, as well as the Angels. 12. We
sent CHRIST, to whom we gave the Gospel, which is the light and confirmation
of the Testament, and the right way to him which fears GOD, by the fulfilling
of your law. All that say that CHRIST is GOD, are unbelievers and liars (CHRIST
himself having said, Ye children of Israel believe in your God and my Lord)
of whom he which will be partaker, shall be cast into the fire eternal. CHRIST
is but the messenger of God, before whom were many other messengers: and his
mother was true, and they did eat. Good people exalt not your selves in your
law, further then the truth. 3. The soul of CHRIST was clean and blested, he
cured the leaprous, raised the dead, taught wisdom, the Testament, and the
Gospel. The unbelieving Israelites believed that he was a Magician. And 34. We
have given a good place and abounding with water to the Son of Mary, and to
her, for having done such miracles in the world.

Sentences.
Honor thy father and mother, and do them good. Give them no bad word when
they are old. Be subject with all humility, and pray God to pardon them. Give to
the poor and to your kindred, but not superfluously: for they that do
superflously are of kin to the devil. Slay not your children for no cause.
Be ye not fornicators; for that is wickedness, and a bad way. Be revenged on
murderers. Say nothing till ye know it; for you must give account of your
saying. 26. in disputing or reasoning use only good words. Answer in honest
sort to him which asks thee. 27. Be just in weight and measure. 37. The
devil stands over the makers of songs and lies, that is, the Poets, if they
amend not, doing good. 68. If you cannot give, be daily in prayers. Pay your
tithes, following God and the Prophet. They which do not good but for
vainglory and ostentation, shall be damned. 118. The histories which are in
the old Testament, are so cited by him, as if he never had read them, so many
dreams and lies are inserted.

Before Prayer wash the face, the hands, the arms up to the elbow, the feet
up to the ankles; and after carnal company wash in the Bath: and if water
cannot be had, with dust of clean earth. Prayer.
God desires cleanness. 9. In prayer let them be sober, that they may know
what they say. 2. God will not ask why men pray not toward the East, for the
East and West is his; but will demand of the works which they have done, of
their alms, pilgrimages, and prayers. He commands that they be humble in
prayer, and that in prayer they turn toward Mecca. Every one which shall
pray, asking that which is good, which way soever he shall turn him, shall be
heard of God: although the true manner of praying be toward the center of the
Temple of Mecca. They which are good, make their prayers to help them by their
patience and abstinence. God dwells in such men. Pray according to the usual
custom in all places, the footman on foot, the horseman on his horse.

Alms.
Good men lose not your alms by vainglorie. 4. Give alms of the good gains
of your money, and of that which the earth produces; but God respects not
gifts of that which is unjustly gotten. Satan persuades you to give nothing
for fear of poverty. To give alms publicly is good, but to give privately
is better: and this blotteth out sins. Give specially to those which stay in
one place, and are ashamed to ask. 6. God will give Paradise to them which in
time of famine and scarfitie give liberally, and which receive injuries, and
repent of their sins.

always the same, pitiful, merciful, besides whom there is none other; whose
miracles and great works are unto the wise the frame of heaven and earth, the
intercourse of night and day, the ships in the sea fit for the use of men,
rain for the refreshing of the earth, the composition of all creatures, the
winds, the clouds, etc. 15. inuoke and worship one GOD alone; 43. God.
All the miracles of GOD cannot be written, if all the trees in the world were
pens, and the sea seven times greater, and were ink; with whom it is a small
thing to raise the dead.

Tradition.
What would ye follow your fathers if they were blind or deaf? Will ye be
like them in being mute, blind, and foolish?

Meats.
Abstain from that which dies of it self, from swines flesh, from blood, and
from every other creature that is killed, and not in the name of the Creator.
But in case of necessity it is not sin; for GOD is merciful, and will
forgive you this. 12. Eat not of that which is drowned, burned in the fire, and
touched of a Wolf. 16. Eat nothing which has not before been blessed. To the
Jews we made many things unlawful, because of their wickedness. 2. He which
shall contradict this book, shall continually be consumed in unquenchable
fire, and none of his works shall help him.

Death.


Romadan, in which, this book (which discerns between good and evil) was
sent you from heaven. Fasting and Pilgrimage.
Every one must observe it, but the sick and traveler, and let them do the
same in the remainder of the time. The rich use of satisfy their fasting with
alms; let them do both the one and the other. He permits you the use of
your wives in the night, because it is hard and impossible to abstain. But let
none use their company in the Temples. Fast all the day, and when night is
come, eat and drink as much as you please, till the morning. By the Moon is
known the time of Pilgrimages, and of fastings, whereby is known that you
love and fear GOD. Spend your money in the love of GOD in Pilgrimage, not
despairing. He that is impotent, and that is not accompanied of his wife in the
pilgrimage, must fast three days in the voyage, and seven after his return.
To the sick, fasting with alms is sufficient. They which purpose this
pilgrimage, let them not give their minds to any evil. Let them not be ashamed
to ask necessaries. 2. Hold it for just and good to enter the house at the
door, not at the side, or backside thereof. 35. Salute those which ye meet,
when ye enter into the house.

Drinks and Games.
Persuade them to seek the Orphans, and succor them, as their brethren, or
else God will make them so poor, that they shall not be able to help either
themselves or others. 13. Wine, chesse, and tables are not lawful, but the
devils inventions, to made debate amongst men, and to keep them from doing
good. Let none go on hunting in the pilgrimage month.

Women.
Let no man touch a woman in her disease, before she be well cleansed. Use your
wives, and the women which are subject to you, where and how you please. Women
which are divorced, may not marry till after four months, having had three
times their menstruous purgation. Let them not deny their husbands their
company at their pleasure. They are the heads of the women. After a third
divorce from one man, they may not marry the same man again, except they have
in the mean time been married to another, and be of him divorced. Let the
women nurse their children two years, recoiuing necessaries of the fathers.
After burial of a husband, let them stay unmarried four months, and ten
days; and not go out of the house in a year after. Take ye two, three, four
wives, and finally as many as in your mind you are content to maintain and
keep in peace. It is unlawful to marry with the mother, daughter, sister,
aunt, niece, nurse, or the mother or daughter of the nurse; and take not a
whore to wife. 9. Let the wives keep their husbands secrets, or else let them
be chastised, and kept in house and bed, till they be better. 10. Let the
husband seek to live peaceably with his wife. 31. Cast not thine eyes on other
men's wives, though they be fair, etc.

Swearing.
They which forswear themselves shall have no good thing in the world to come.
And 35. Swear not rashly, for GOD sees euerything.

Marie, preferred him before all others, that had been exalted by me, to
speak with GOD, to power and virtue. Christ.
He inserteth the prayer of the Virgins mother, when she felt her self with
child, by Ioachim: and makes Zachary to be the Virgins Tutor. 5. Who (he
says) for his unbelief was dumb three days. The Angels saluted Marie,
saying, O thou the purest of all women and men, devoted to GOD, Joy unto thee
of that great Messenger, with the word of GOD, whose name is JESUS CRHIST, an
excellent man, at the command of the Creator: he shall come with Divine power,
with knowledge of all learning, with the book of the Law and Gospel; shall
give Commandments to the Israelites: shall give life; cure diseases; show what
is to be eaten, and to be done; shall confirm the old Testament; shall make
some things lawful, which before were unlawful, etc. He acknowledges that
his mother knew not man. 11. They say (the Jews) that they killed CHRIST, the
Son of Mary, the Messenger of God, but it was not true, but they crucified in
his stead another like him; for the incomprehensible God caused him to go unto
him. JESUS is the Spirit, and Word, and Messenger of God, sent from heaven. 11.

Forcing to believe.
4. God gave first the Testament, then the Gospel, and lastly the true Book,
the Alfurcan of your Law, in confirmation of those former.

Usury.
Ye which are good fear God, and forsake usury, left the anger of God, and
of the Prophet, assail you. Take only the principal; and if he cannot pay
you, stay till he can, and give him alms; for this shall be better for you.

Repentance.
In the 5. Unto bad men is denied humane and divine mercy, except they repent.
God cares little for the conversion of them, which, after that of Infidels
they are made believers, become worse. Such shall suffer without any remission
intolerable punishment. 10. God pardons less faults, but not criminal.

Friendship.
If betwixt you there grow discord, laying aside all stomach, do the will of
God, and become brethren together, imitating God, who has delivered you from
the fire, and from dangers. 6. God would not that any should do evil to those
of his own Nation, and those which consent to your Law, but rather their
profit and commodity.

Mahomet, defend the orders by him given with arms. Infidels.
No man can die, but when God will, that is, when his time is come. Those which
flee out of the war, are provoked of the Devil; but God pardons them which
repent. They which die in the way of God, are not truly called dead: They live
with God. Let none fear them which are governed of the Devil. 7. Be patient,
and you shall have eternal life. 10. Accompany not with unbelievers, neither
in friendship, nor other business. They which go on war-fare for God and the
Prophet, shall receive abundance in the earth, and after death the mercy of
God.

They which refuse (except they be sick or children) shall be cast into hell.
Neglect not prayers in your expeditions. Some may pray, whiles others stand in
arms. Pray not for them which hurt their own souls. 18. Look to your selves
that there be no discord amongst you.

Thus have I endeavored to bring some order out of confusion, and have framed
these heads out of that Alcoran-Chaos Magdeburgenses in Centuria 7. have also
gathered some heads of this headless monster, which they that will may there
read.
, where is scarce either head or tail: this tale they have and believe (for
what will not? what shall not they believe, which refuse to believe the Truth?)
that he which reads this book a thousand times in his life, shall have a
woman in Paradise, whose eyebrows shall be as large as the raynebow.

CHAP. V.
Other Mahumeticall speculations, and explanations of their Law, collected out
of their own Commentaries, of that Argument.

OF such writings as have come to our hands touching Mahomets doctrine and
Religion, that seems most fully to lay them open, which is called by F
Sansou. and Bell. lib.3.
some, Scala; a book containing the exposition of the Alcoran, in form of a
Dialogue, translated into Latin by Hermannus Dalmata, and made the twelfth
Chapter of the first book of the Alcoran in Italian. I have therefore presumed
on the Readers patience, to those former collections out of the Alcoran it
self to add these ensuing, as a further explanation of their opinions. The
Messenger of GOD (so begins that book) was sitting amongst his fellows
(the prayer and salvation of GOD be upon him) in his City Iesrab; and the
Angel Gabriel descending on him, said, GOD saluteth thee, O Mahomet, etc.
There come four wisemen, Masters in Israel, to prove thee; the chief of whom
is Abdia-ben-Salon. Mahomet therefore sent his cousin Hali to salute them; and
they being come to Mahomet, after mutual salutations, Abdia tells him, that
he and his fellows were sent by the people of the Jews to learn the
understanding of some obscurer places of their law. Mahomet asks, if he come
to enquire, or to tempt. Abdia says, to enquire. Then Mahomet giving him full
leave, he begins; having before gathered out of the whole body of their Law
an hundred most exquisite questions. The principal dregs you shall here
have.

Abdia. Tell us (O Mahomet) whether thou be a Prophet or a Messenger? Mahomet.
GOD has appointed me both a Prophet and a Messenger. Ab. Do thou preaoh the
Law of GOD, or thine own Law? Mah. The Law of GOD: this Law is faith, and this
faith is, that there are not Gods, but one God, without partaker. Ab. How many
laws of God are there? Mah. One, the law, and faith of the Prophets, which
went before us, was one; the rites were different. Ab. Shall we enter Paradise
for faith or works? Mah. Both are necessary; but if a Gentile, Jew, or
Christian, become a Saracen, and prevent his good works, Faith only shall
suffice: But if Gentile, Jew, or Christian, do good works, not in the love of
God, the fire shall consume both him and his work. Ab. How does the mercy of
God prevent his anger? Mah. When before other creatures Adam rose up, he
sneesed and said, God be thanked: and the Angels hearing it, said The Pity of
God be upon thee, Adam, who answered Amen: Then said the Lord, I have received
your prayer. Ab. What be the four things which God wrought with his own
hands? Mah. He made Paradise, planted the tree of the trumpet, formed Adam, and
did write the Tables of Moses. Ab. Who told thee this? Mah. Gabriel from the
Lord of the world. Ab. In what form? Mah. Of a man standing upright, never
sleeping, nor eating, nor drinking, but the praise of God. Ab. Tell me in order
what is one, what is two, what three, four, five, six, etc. to a hundredth.
Mah. One is God without Son, partaker or fellow, almighty Lord of life and
death. Two, Adam and Eve. Three, Michael, Gabriel, Saraphiel, Archangels
Secretaries of God. Four, The Law of Moses, the Psalms of David, the Gospel,
and Alfurcan (so called of the distinction of the sentences). Five: The prayers
which God gave me and my people, and to none of the other Prophets. Six, The
days of Creation. Seven, Heavens. Eight, Angels which sustain the throne of
GOD. Nine, Are the miracles of Moses. Ten, Are the fasting-dayes of the
Pilgrims: three, when they go, seven, in their return. Eleven are the
Stars whereof Joseph dreamed. Twelve inoneths in the year; thirteen is the
Sun and Moon, with the eleven Stars. Fourteen candles hang about the
throne of GOD, of the length of five hundred years. Fifteen, the fifteenth
day of Ramadam, in which the Alcoran came sliding from heaven. Sixteen, are
the legions of the Cherubims. Seventeen, are the names of GOD between the
bottom of the earth and hell, which stay those flames, which else would consume
the world. Eighteen, Interpositions there be between the throne of GOD, and
the air; for else the brightness of GOD would blind the world. Nineteen, Be
the arms or branches of Zachia, a river in hell, which shall make a great
noise in the day of Judgment. Twenty, The day of the month Ramadam, when the
Psalms descended on David The one and twentieth of Ramadam, Solomon was borne.
The two and twentieth, David was pardoned the sin against Vriah. The three and
twentieth of Ramadam, CHRIST the Son of Mary was borne; the prayers of GOD be
upon him. The four and twentieth, GOD spoke to Moses. The five and twentieth,
the sea was divided. The six and twentieth, He received the Tables. The seven
and twentieth, Iouas was swallowed of the Whale. The eight and twentieth, Jacob
recovered his sight, when Judas brought Joseph's coat. The nine and twentieth,
Was Enoch translated. The thirtieth, Moses went into mount Sinai. A. Make short
work, for thou do all things exactly. M. Forty are the days of Moses his
fasting. Fifty thousand years shall the day of Judgment continue. Sixty are
the veins, which every of the heavens have in the earth, without which
variety there would be no knowledge amongst men. Seventy men Moses took to
himself. Eighty stripes are due to a drunken man. Ninety, The Angel said to
David, This my fellow has ninety sheep, and I but one, which he has stolen
from me. An hundred stripes are due to the adulterer.

A. Well, show us how the earth was made, and when. M. God made man of mire:
the mire, of froth: this was made of the tempests; these, of the sea: The sea,
of darkness; the darkness, of light; this, of the word; the word, of the thought;
the thought, of Iacinth; the Iacinth, of the commandment: Let it be, and it
was. A. How many Angels are set over men? M. Two, one on the right hand, which
writes his good deeds; another on the left, which registreth his bad. These
sit on men's shoulders. Their pen is their tongue, their ink is their spittle,
their heart is the book. A. What did God make after? M. The books wherein are
written all things, past, present, and to come, in heaven and earth; and the
pen made of the brightest light, five hundred years long, and eighty broad,
having eighty teeth, wherein are written all things in the world, till the day
of Judgment. The book is made of the greatest Emerald; the words, of pearls;
the cover, of pity. God ouer-looketh the same an hundred and sixty times in a
day and night. The heaven is made of smoke, of the vapor of the sea: the
greenenesse of the sea proceeds from the mount Kaf, which is made of the
Emeralds of Paradise, and compasses the world, bearing up the heavens. The
gates of heaven are of gold, the locks of light, the keys of piety. Above
the heavens are the sea of life, above that the cloudie sea; then the ayrie
sea, the stony sea, the dark sea, the sea of solace, the Moon, the Sun,
the name of God, Supplication, Gabriel, the parchment rased, the parchment full
written, all these in order one over another. Then, above all these, the
threescore and ten spaces of light: then threescore and ten thousand hills,
with threescore and ten thousand spaces between, and threescore and ten
thousand troops of Angels on them, in every troop five thousand Angels always
praising the Lord of the world: above these the limits or bounds of Angelical
dignity: and above the same the banner of glory, and then spaces of pearls,
and in their orders one above another, the spaces of Grace, of Power, of
Divinity, of dispensation, the footstool, the throne, the house of the
universe.

A. Are the Sun and Moon faithful or not? M. They are faithful, and obey
every command of GOD. A. Why then are they not of equal light? M. GOD created
them equal, but by this it came to pass, that the vicissitude or intercourse
of day and night was vnceriaine, till Gabriel flying by the Moon, darkened her
with the touch of his wing. A. How many orders are there of the Stars? M.
Three, the first of those which hang by chains from the throne of GOD, giving
light to the seventh throne: the second chase away the devils, when they would
enter into heaven: the third in the sight of the Angels. There are seven seas
between us and heaven. There are three winds: the first barren; the second
tempestuous, which shall blow the fire in the day of Judgment: the third
ministers to the earth and sea. A. Where is the Sun? M. In a hot fountain:
this, in a Serpent, which is a great space in the mount Kaf, and this Kaf is in
the hand of the Angel, which holds the world till the day of Judgment. Abd.
What is the manner of them, which bear up the seat of GOD? Mah. Their heads
are under the seat of GOD, their feet under the seven thrones, their necks are
so large, that a bird in a thousand years continual flight could not reach
from the one ear to the other. They have horns, and their meat and drink is
the praise and glory of GOD. Abd. How far is it to heaven? Mahom. Five
hundred years journey to the lowest, and so from each to other. Abd. What
birds are between us and heaven? Mahom. Some which touch neither heaven nor
earth, having manes like horses, hair like women, wings like birds, and lay
their eggs and hatch them on their tails till the day of Judgment.

Abd. What was the forbidden tree? Mahom. Of wheat, which had seven ears,
whereof Adam plucked one wherein were five grains; of which, two he eat, two
he gave to Eve, and one he carried away. This grain was bigger then an egg,
and being bruised, brought forth all kinds of seed. Abd. Where was Adam
received after his expulsion from Paradise? Mahom. Adam in India, Eve in Nubia.
Adam was covered with three leaves of Paradise; Eve, with her hair: They met
together in Arafe. Further, as concerning Eve, she was made of a ribbe of the
left side, for otherwise she had been as strong as the man.

Abd. Who dwelt in the earth before? Mahom. First the Devils, seven thousand
years after them the Angels: lastly Adam, a thousand years after the Angels.
Ab. Who began the Pilgrimage. Mahom. Adam. Gabriel shaued his head, and he
circumcised himself; and after him Abraham. Abd. To what Land spoke GOD at any
time? Mahom. To mount Sinai, that it should lift up Moses to heaven: Abitabil
and Moses are the two men, whose sepulchers are not known. Moses by chance
found a sepulcher, which while he measured with his body, the Angel of Death
drew from him his soul out of his nostrills, by the smell of an apple of
Paradise.

Ab. Where is the middle of the earth? Mahom. In Jerusalem. A. Who made the
first ship? Mahom. Noe: he received the keys thereof of Gabriel, and going
forth of Arabia, compassed Mecca seven times, and likewise Jerusalem. In the
mean while Mecca was received up into heaven, and the mount Abikobez preserved
Jerusalem in her belly. A. What shall become of the children of the Infidels.
M. They shall come in at the day of Judgment, and God shall say unto them,
would ye do that thing which shall be commanded you? And he shall command to
flow forth one of the rivers of hell, and bid them leap into the same. They
which obey, shall go into Paradise. This shall be the trial of the children of
the faithful also, which are borne deaf, blind, etc. Abd. What rests under
these seven earths? Mahom. An Ox, whose feet are on a white stone, his head
in the East, his tail in the West; he has forty horns, and as many teeth;
it is a thousand years journey from one horn to another. Under that stone is
Zohet, a mountain of hell, of a thousand years journey. All the Insidels
shall ascend upon the same, and from the top shall fall into hell. Under that
Mount is the land Werelea; under that, the sea Alkasem: the land Aliolen, the
Sea Zere: the Land Neama, the Sea Zegir: the Land Theris, the Land Agiba white
as Milk, sweet as Musk, soft as Saffron, bright as the Moon: the Sea
Alknitar; the Fish Albehbut, with his head in the East, his tail in the West:
all these in order one after another. And beneath all these in like infernal
order the Wind, the Mountain, the Thunder, the Lightening, the bloody Sea,
Hell closed, the fiery Sea, the dark Sea, the Sea Po, the cloudie Sea,
Praises, Glorifications, the Throne, the Book, the Pen, the greater name of
GOD.

Abd. What has come out of Paradise into the World? Mahom. Mecca, Iesrab,
Jerusalem: as on the contrary, out of Hell; Vastat in Egypt, Antiochia in
Syria, Ebheran in Armenia, and Elmeden of Chaldaea. Abd. What say you of
Paradise? Mahom. The ground of Paradise is of gold, enameled with Emeralds, and
Hiacinths, planted with every fruitful tree, watered with streams of milk,
honey, and wine: the day is of a thousand years continuance, and the year of
forty thousand years. The people shall have whatsoever can be desired, they
shall be clothed in all colors, except The Turks reckon Green the Prophets
color.
black, which is the proper color of Mahomet: they all shall be of the
stature of Adam, in resemblance like CHRIST, never increasing or diminishing.
As soon as they are entered, shall be set before them the liver of the Fish
Albehbut, and whatsoever dainties they can desire. They shall not need going to
stool any more then the child in the womb, but they shall sweat out all
superfluities, of sent like musk. They shall eat but for delight, not for
hunger. Unlawful meats, as Swines flesh, they shall refrain. And if you list
to know why this beast is unclean, understand that JESUS on a time called
forth Iaphet to tell his Disciples the history of the Arc; Who told them,
that by the weight of the ordure, the Arc leaned on the one side, whereupon
Noe, consulting with GOD, was bidden bring the Elephant thither, out of whose
dung, mixed with man's, came forth a Hog, which wrooted in that mire with his
snout, and by the stincke thereof was produced out of his nose a mouse, which
gnawed the boords of the Arc: Noe fearing this danger, was bidden to strike
the Lion on the forehead: and by the Lions breath was a Cat engendered, mortal
enemy to the Mouse. But to return from this stinking tale, to refresh our
selves with the like sweetes of this Paradise. He adds, that there they have
the wives that here they had, and other concubines, whom, how, when,
wheresoever they will.

Abd. But why is wine lawful there, and here unlawful? Mahom. The Angels
Arot, and Marot, were sometime sent to instruct and govern the world,
forbidding men wine, injustice, and murder. But a woman having whereof to
accuse her husband invited them to dinner, and made them drunk. They, inflamed
with a double heat of wine and lust, could not obtain that their desire of
their fair Hostess, except one would teach her the word of ascending to
heaven, and the other of descending. Thus she mounted up to heaven. And upon
inquiry of the matter, she was made the Morning-starre, and they put to their
choice whether they would be punished in this world or in the world to come:
they accepting their punishment in this, are hanged by chains, with their
heads in a pit of Babel, till the day of Judgment.

Hell, says Mahomet there, has the floor of Brimstone, smokie, Pitchie, with
stinking flames, with deep pits of scalding pitch, and sulphurous flames,
wherein the damned are punished daily: the trees bear most loathsome fruits,
which they eat.

The day of Judgment shall be in this sort. In that day GOD will command the
Angel of Death to kill every Creature; which being done, he shall ask him
if nothing be alive: Adreiel the Angel of Death shall answer, Nothing but
myself. Then go thy ways betwixt Paradise and Hell, and last of all kill thy
self. Thus he, foulded in his wings, prostrate on the earth, shall strangle
himself with such a bellowing noise, as would terrify the very Angels, if
they were alive.

Thus the World shall be empty forty years. Then shall GOD hold the Heaven
and Earth in his fist, and say, where are now the mighty men, the Kings and
Princes of the World? Tell me (if ye be true) whose is the Kingdom, and
Empire, and Power? Repeating these words three times, he shall raise up
Seraphiel, and say, Take this Trumpet, and go to Jerusalem, and found. This
Trumpet is of five hundred years journey. At that sound all Souls shall come
forth, and disperse themselves unto their own bodies, and their bones shall be
gathered together. Forty years after he shall sound again, and then the
bones shall resume flesh and sinews. After forty years the third sound shall
warn the Souls to re-possesse their bodies: and a fire from the West shall
drive every creature to Jerusalem. When they have here swumme forty years in
their own sweat, they shall, with much vexation, come to Adam, and say, Father
Adam, Father Adam, Why have thou begotten us to these miseries and torments?
Why suffer thou us to hang between hope and fear? Pray to God, that he
will finish his determination of us between Paradise and Hell: Adam shall
excuse his unworthiness for his disobedience, and send them to Noe, Noe will
post them to Abraham, Abraham to Moses: He shall send them to JESUS CHRIST: To
him they shall come and say, The Spirit, Word, and Power of God, let thy pity
move thee to make intercession for us. He shall answer them, That which you
ask, you have lost. I was indeed sent unto you in the power of God, and word
of Truth, but ye have erred, and have made me God; more then ever I preached
to you: and have therefore lost my benefit. But go to the last of the
Prophets, meaning him with whom thou now talkest, Abdia. Then shall they turn
to him, and say; O faithful Messenger, and friend of God, we have sinned,
hear us holy Prophet, our only hope, etc. Then shall Gabriel present himself
to help his friend, and they shall go to the Throne of God. And God shall
say, I know why you are come, Far be it that I should not hear the prayer of
my faithful one. Then shall a Bridge be made over Hell, and on the top of the
Bridge shall be set a balance, wherein every man's works shall be weighed, and
those which are saved, shall pass over the Bridge, the other shall fall into
Hell. A. How many bands of men shall there be in that day. M. An hundred and
twenty; of which three only shall be found faithful: and every Band or
Troop of men shall be in length the journey of a thousand years, in breadth
five hundred. A. What shall become of Death? M. He shall be transformed into a
Ram, and they shall bring him between Paradise and Hell. Then shall arise
much dissension between these two peoples, through fear of the one, and hope
of the other. But the people of Paradise shall prevail, and shall slay Death
between Paradise and Hell. Abdia. Thou, O Mahomet, have overcome, and I
believe, that there is but one God Almighty, and thou art his Messenger and
Prophet.

In this long and tedious Summarie of that longer and more tedious Dialogue,
compared with the former Jewish opinions, touching their Behemoth, Leuiathan,
Ziz, Jerusalem, Swines flesh, the Angel of Death, and other their
superstitious opinions, it may appear, that the Jews were forward
Mint-masters in this new-coyned Religion of Mahomet.

In the beginning of this Dialogue are mentioned their five Prayers and their
Ramadam, or Ramazan: Of which, that Arabian Nobleman, in confutation of the
Alcoran, writes thus: Arab. Nob. in Confut. Alcor.
He which has fulfilled these five Prayers, shall be praised in this world,
and the next. They are as follow: two kneelings in the morning, after noone
four; at Vespers, or a little before Sunne-set, four; after Sunne-set, four;
at their beginning of supper, two; and after supper, when it is dark, two; in
all eighteen kneelings in a day.

Their Lent Of Mahomets Lent.
, or Fast of the Month Ramazan, is thus: In the day time they must fast from
Meat, Drink, and Venerie, till the Sun be down: then is Riot permitted
them, till a white thread may be discerned from a black. But if any be sick,
or in iourneying, he may pay at another time the same number of days.

Friar Richard Richardus confut. Alcor.
recites among Mahomets opinions, That of threescore and thirteen parts of
the Saracens, one only shall be saved; and, that the Devils shall once be
saved by the Alcoran; and that they call themselves Saracens; fit companions
with them in their holy things.

Some Pietro Messia tradoito per F. Sanso vino, l.4. c.1.
make it a Canon of Mahomets, That they should look toward the South when they
pray, that when they pray they should say, GOD is one GOD, without equal, and
Mahomet his Prophet: which, Lod.Barthema says, are the Characters of the
profession of a Mahumetan, and that, by the pronouncing of those words, he was
tried whether he was an Infidel, or no. These words, says the abouesaid
Arabian (as they affirm) before the beginning of the world were written in the
Throne of GOD.

One says Constantin. Porphyrogenit. de admin. Imp. cap.15.
, That the Saracens adore the star of Uenus, and in their praying cry, Alla
oua cubar Euthymius calls it ^^^^^^: Cedrenus more fully, Alla, alla, on a
Curbar, alla.
, that is, GOD, and Venus. Ioannes Meursius notes thereon, That they
worshipped the Image of Venus, set on a great stone, on which they believe,
that Abraham lay with Hagar, or else that he tied his Camel thereunto while he
was sacrificing Isaac. Anonymus in Saracen.

Bellonius Bell. obseru. lib.3.cap.9.
in his observations tells out of their Books, That there is a Tree in
Paradise which shadoweth it all over, and spreades her boughs over the walls,
whose leaves are of pure gold and silver, each of them, after the Name of GOD,
having therein written the name of Mahomet. And that if a Christian, at
unawares, should pronounce the said prayer, Laillah etc. GOD is one GOD, and
Mahomet his Prophet, he must either die or turn Turk. Such reputation have
they of this form, which they call a Prayer, with as good reason as the Aue
Marie among the Romists, wherein yet they pray not for any thing. Bellonius
also says, That they hold the Heaven to be made of Smoke, and the Firmament
stablished on the horn of a Buffall, by whose stirring Earthquakes are caused:
That there are seven Paradises, with Houses, Gardens, Fountains, and
whatsoever sense accounts delectable; where they shall enjoy all delights
without any sorrow, having Carpets, Beds, Boys, Horses, Saddles, Garments, for
cost and workmanship most curious, and ready for attendance. Those boys
richly adorned, when they have satisfied their hunger and thirst, shall present
every Saracen a huge Pome-citron in a golden Charger, and as soon as they
shall smell thereof, there shall thence proceed a comely virgin in gallant
attire, which shall embrace him, and he her; and so shall they continue fifty
years. After which space ended, God shall show them his face, where at they
shall fall down, not able to endure the brightness: but he shall say, Arise
my servants, and enjoy my glory; for hereafter ye shall never die, nor be
grieved. Then shall they see God, and each lead his virgin into his chamber,
where all pleasures shall attend them. If one of those virgins should come
forth at midnight, she would lighten the world no less then the Sun; and if
she should spit into the Sea, all the water thereof would become sweet. Gabriel
keeps the keys of Paradise, which are in number threescore and ten
thousand, each seven thousand miles long. But he was not able to open Paradise
without invocation of the Name of God, and Mahomet his friend. There is a Table
of Adamant seven hundred thousand days journey long and broad, with Seats of
Gold and Silver about it, where they shall be feasted.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Pilgrimage to Mecca.

WE have heard of the antiquity of this Pilgrimage in the former chapter,
derived from Adam, who was shaven and circumcised for that purpose: and the
Alcoran names Abraham the founder of the Temple etc. Pity it were, that the
last of the Prophets should not honor that which was first instituted by the
first of men. If we will rather believe that Arabian before mentioned, we shall
find another original, namely, that whereas two Nations of the Indians,
called Zechian and Albarachuma, had used to go about their Idols naked and
shaven, with great howlings, kissing the corners, and casting stones upon an
heap which was heaped up in honor of their Gods, and that twice every year,
in the Spring, and in Autumn: the Arabians had learned the same of the
Indians, and practiced the same at Mecca, in honor of Venus (casting stones
back between their legs, the parts of Venus) in the time of Mahomet.
Neither did Mahomet abrogate this, as he did other idolatrous Rites; only for
modesties sake they were enjoined to gird a piece of Linen about their Reins.

Mecca, or (as they call it) Macca, signifying an Habitation, contains in it
about six thousand houses, fairly built, like those of Italy: Other walls it
has not, then such as Nature has environed it with, namely, with high and
barren Mountains round about. Some Pilgrimage to Mecca, M. Hak. t.2.
report, That between the Mountains and the City are pleasant Gardens,
abundant of Figs, Grapes, Apples, Melons, and that there is store also of
Flesh and Water. But it seems, that this is of later industry, not of
Natures indulgence, if it be true. For Lod. Barthema Vertoman; l.1.c.14.
, or Vertoman, being there in the year 1503, says, That the place was
accursed of GOD, as not bringing forth Herbs, Trees, Fruits, or any thing,
and besides, having great scarcity of water, and is served with these things
from other places. It is governed by a King (tributarie, then to the Sultan,
now to the Turk) called the Seriffo, lineally descended from their great
Seducer, by his daughter Fatma (the only issue of this libidinous poligamous
Prophet) married to Hali. All of this kindred are called Emyri, that is, Lords,
clothed with (or at least wearing Turbants of) green, which color the
Mahumetans will not suffer other men to wear.

The number of Pilgrims which resort hither, is incredible. From Cairo comes
a Carovan of devotion, some to Mammon, some to Mahomet, either for trade of
Merchandise, or for Superstition, and another yearly from Damascus: besides
those which come from the Indies, Aethiopia, Arabia, Persia, etc. Lud. Barthema
says, That (at his being at Mecca) of the Carovan of Damasco, wherein he went,
were five and thirty thousand Camels, and about forty thousand persons: of
that of Cairo were threescore and four thousand Camels, and now in these times
about forty thousand Camels, Mules, and Dromedaries, and fifty thousand
persons, besides the Arabian Carovan, and of other Nations.

This Mart of Mecca is much impaired, since the Portugales have intercepted the
Indian commodities, which by a Carovan, from thence, were wont to be brought
hithen.

Let me desire the Reader to have patience, and go along, on this Pilgrimage,
with one of these Carovans, through these Arabian Deserts to Mecca and Medina:
and because that of Gairo is the chief, we will bestow our selves in it, and
observe what Rites they observe before they set forth; what by the way, and at
the intended places of their devotion. Alcor.Italic.
Touching the necessity whereof; they think, That they which go not once in
their lives, shall, after death, go to the Devil. Yea, some, for devotion,
pluck out their eyes after so holy a sight.

The month Ramazan (as you have heard) is their Lent; falling sometime high,
sometime low, being that whole month, during which time the Pilgrims and
Merchants resort to Cairo from Asia, Greece, Barbary, etc. After their
Pilgrimage to Mecca, Ha^s
Lent ended, they observe their Easter, or Feast, called Bairam, three days.
Twenty days after this Feast, the Carovan is ready to depart. Against this
time, they assemble themselves at a place, two leagues from Cairo (called
Birca) attending the coming of the Captain. This Captain of the Carovan,
whom they call Amarilla Haggi, is renewed every third year; and to him the
Grand Signior, every voyage, gives eighteen Purses (each containing six
hundred twenty five ducats of Gold) for the behoof of the Carovan, and also
to do alms unto needful Pilgrims. He has four Chausi to serve him, and
four hundred soldiers, two hundred Spachi, mounted on Dromedaries, and as
many Ianizaries, riding on Camels. The Chausi and Spachi the Captain
maintains at his own charges: The Ianizaries have their provision from
Cairo, He has eight Pilots for guides; which Office is hereditarie.

They carry five pieces of Ordinance, to terrify the Arabians, and to triumph
at Mecca. The merchandise that goes by land, pays no custom; that which
goes by sea, pays ten in the hundred. At the Feast, before the Carovan
sets forth, the Captain, with his Retinue and Officers, resort unto the
Castle of Cairo, before the Basha, which gives unto every man a Garment, and
that of the Captain is wrought with gold, the others according to their
degree. Moreover, he delivers unto him the Chisva Tunabi, or Garment of the
Prophet; a vesture of Silk, wrought with these letters of Gold, Lailla ill
alla Mahumet Resullala; that is, There are no Gods, but GOD, and Mahomet is the
Messenger of GOD. After this, he delivers to him a Gate, wrought curiously
with Gold; and a Covering of green Velvet, made in manner of a Pyramid, about
nine palms high, wrought with fine Gold, to cover the Tomb of the Prophet
Mahomet, and many other Couerings besides of Gold and Silk, to adorn it. The
two former are for the House of Abraham in Mecca.

Then the Captain having taken his leave, departs, accompanied with all the
people of Cairo, in manner of a Procession, with singing, shouting, and a
thousand Ceremonies besides, and passing the Gate Bab-Nassera, lays up, in a
Mosquita, the said Vestures very safely. This Ceremony is performed with such
public resort, that it is not lawful for any man to forbid his wife the going
to this Feast: for she may, upon such a cause, separate her self from her
husband, and lie with another man. The Camels, which carry the Vestures, being
adorned with Cloth of Gold, and many little Bells, the multitude stroweth
flowers and sweet water on them; others with fine Cloth and Towels touch the
same, reserving these for Relics. Twenty days after this Feast, the
Captain, taking the Vestures out of that Mosquita, repaireth to Birca, where
his Tent abides some ten days. In this time, they which mean to follow the
Carovan, resort thither, and amongst them, many women, attyred with Trifles,
Tassels, and Knottes, accompanied with their friends, mounted on Camels. The
night before their departure, they make great feasting and triumph, with
discharging their Ordinance, Fire-workes, etc. shouting, till, at the break of
day, upon the found of a Trumpet, they march forward on their way.

From Cairo to Mecca is forty days journey, traveling from two a clock in
the morning till the Sun ne-rising: and then having rested till noone, they set
forward, so continuing till night:, observing this order, till the end of their
Voyage, without change; except ^. Bar. with the Carovan of Damasco traveled
22. hours of 24.
at some places, where, in respect of water, they rest sometimes a day and a
half, to refresh themselves. The Carovan is divided into three parts: the
fore-ward, the maine battle, and the rete-ward. The fore-ward contains
about the third part of the people; and amongst these, the eight Pilots, a
Chausi, and four knaves, with Bulls sinews, which punish offenders on the
soles of their feet. In the night time they have four or five men go before
with Pieces of dry wood, which give light: they follow the Star, as the
Mariners. Within a quarter of a mile follows the maine Battle, with their
Ordinance, Gunners, and fifteen Archers, Spachs. The chief Physician, with
his Ointments and Medicines for the sick, and Camels for them to ride on. Next
goes the fairest Camel that may be found in the Turks dominion, decked with
Cloth of Gold and Silk, and carries a little Chest, made of pure Leg^^ame, in
form of the Israelitish Arc, containing in it the Alcoran, all written with
great letters of Gold, bound between two Tables of Massy Gold. This Chest is
covered with Silk, during the voyage; but at their entering into Mecca and
Medina it is covered with Cloth of Gold, adorned with Jewels. This Camel is
compassed about with Arabian Singers and Musicians, singing always, and playing
upon Instruments. After this follow fifteen other most fair Camels, every one
carrying one of the above said Vestures, being covered from top to toe with
Silk. Behind these, go the twenty Camels, which carry the Captains money
and provision. After follows the Standard of the Great Signior, accompanied
with Musicians and soldiers, and behind these, less then a mile, follows
the rere-ward, the greatest part Pilgrims; the Merchants, for security, going
before: for in this voyage it is needful, and usual, that the Captain bestow
Presents, Garments, and Turbants upon the chief Arabians, to give him free
passage, receiving sometimes, by pilferings, some damage notwithstanding. They
pass by certain weak Castles in the way, Agerut, Nachel, Acba, Biritem,
between which two last is the River of Ithro, and the Ponds of Midian, where
Moses sat down. At Iebhir, the first Town subject to the Seriffo of Mecca,
they are received with much joy, and well refreshed with the plenty which that
place yields. They find other filthy commodities also more then plenty,
which fact (they hold) purges them from a multitude of sins, and increases
their devotion to prosecute the voyage. The next day they go toward
Bedrihonem, in which place grows shrubbes, whereout issues Baulme. Hereby
they lodge one night, in memory of a victory here obtained against the
Christians, at the earnest prayers of their Prophet, dreaming of Drums, here
still sounded by Angels, as they pass. The next morning, by Sunne-rising, they
arrive at Bedrihonem, where every one washes himself from top to toe,
covering their priuities with a cloth, and their shoulders with another white
one; and they which can go in this habit to Mecca, merit more; they which
cannot, make a vow to offer a Ram at the Mountain of Pardons. After this
washing, it is not lawful for any man or woman to kill a Flea or Lowse with
their hands or nails, till they have accomplished their Vows at that
Mountain.

This night they come within two miles of Mecca. The next morning they march
on, and the Seriffo meeting them, resigneth his Government to the Captain,
during his abode there: and the Captain gives him a garment of cloth of Gold,
with other Jewels. After this, having eaten together upon Carpets and Hides,
they take with them the Gate and Garment abouesaid, and go, attended but with
few, to the Mosquita, and there cause the old to be pulled down, and put the
new couerture on the house of Abraham: and the old Vesture is the Eunuchs which
serve in the said Mosquita, which sell it dear to the Pilgrims, every little
piece being accounted a most holy Relic. And well may it be so, for (can you
doubt of it?) putting the same under the head of a man at his death, all his
sins must, by virtue hereof, be pardoned. They take away the old door, which
is the Seriffo's fee, and set in place the new. Thus after some Orisons, the
Captain returns to his pauilion, the Seriffo remains in the City.

That you may be the better acquainted with this Mosquita, and house of
Abraham, you are to know, Description of the Mosquita at Mecca.
that in the midst of the City is this great Mosquita, built (they say) in
the time when their Prophet lived. It is foure-square, every square half a
mile, being in all the circuit two miles, in manner of a Cloister: The
Galleries round about are in manner of four streets; these streets being
separated from each other with Pillars, of Marble some, and some of Lime and
Stone. In the midst of all, separate from the rest, is the house of Abraham.
This Mosquita has fourscore and nineteen Gates and five Steeples, from
whence the Talismans call the people to their devotion. And the Pilgrims,
which are not provided of Tents, resort hither, men and women lying together;
their House of Prayer becoming a den of Thieves. Barthema says, That this
Temple is round, like the Coliseo at Rome: That at every entrance is a descent
of ten or twelve steps, on both sides whereof stand Iewellers, which sell
Gemmes only. Within it is vaulted, gilded, and odoriferous; beyond what can be
spoken: for there are four or five hundred men which sell powders to preserve
dead corpses, and other Sweetes. It seems, that since his time the Temple and
House of Abraham are altered. This The house of Abraham described.
House is fouresquare, made of speckled stone, twenty paces high, and forty
in circuit. And upon one side of this House, within the wall, there is a stone
of a spanne long, and half a spanne broad, which stone (they say) fell down
from Heaven; a voice from Heaven, at the same fall, being heard, That
wheresoever this stone fell, there should be built the House of GOD, wherein he
will hear the prayers of sinners. Then was this Stone as white as Snow, but
now, through the kisses of sinners it is become so black as it is. The
entrance into this House is small and high. There are without this House one
and thirty pillars of Brass upon square stones, sustaining a thread of
Copper, reaching from one to another, on which are fastened many burning
Lamps. The founder of these was Solomon. Being entered into this house through
that difficult passage, there stand two pillars of Marble at the entrance: in
the midst are three of Aloes-wood, covered with tyles of India, of a thousand
colors, which serve to underprop the Terratza, or roof. It is so dark, that
they can hardly see within for want of light; nor is it without an evil smell.
Without the gate five paces, is the Pond Zunzun; that blessed Pond which the
Angel showed to Agar for her son Ismael.

Of their Feast Baraim is said already: about six days after they be come
hither to Mecca, they celebrate another Feast called Bine baraim, that is, the
great Feast, which is also called, The Feast of the Ram. In those days space
they prepare themselves hereunto with due ceremonies. First, departing from the
Carovan, guided with such as are skillful in the way, they go twenty or
thirty in a Company, walking through a street, which ascends by little and
little, till they come unto a certain gate, whereon is written in Marble,
Babel Salema; that is, the gate of Health. And from this place is descried the
great Mosquita, and twice saluted, saying, Peace to thee, Messenger of GOD.
Then proceeding on their way, they find an Arch on their right hand, whereon
they ascend five steps, upon which is a great void place made of stoue: after
descending other five steps, and proceeding the space of a flight-shoot, they
find another Arch, like unto the first; and this way, from the one Arch to the
other, they go and come seven times, saying always some of their prayers,
which they say the afflicted Hagar said, whiles she sought and found not water
for her son. After this Ceremony, they enter into the Mosquita; and drawing
near unto the house of Abraham, they go round about it other seven times,
always saying. This is the House of GOD, and of his servant Abraham. This
done, they go and kiss that black stone ahouesaid; and then go they to the
Pond ZunZun, and in their apparel, as they be, wash themselves from head to
foot, saying, Tobah Allah, Tobah Allah, Pardon LORD, Pardon LORD; drinking also
of that muddie unsavory water: and thus return they, cleansed from all their
sins. Every Pilgrim performs these Ceremonies once at the least; the
deuouter sort often.

An hundred years since these Ceremonies were somewhat different, after
Barthema's Vertoman. lib.1.c.15.
Relation. On the three and twentieth of May, the people (before day) compassed
that house of Abraham seven times, always touching and kissing every corner.
Ten or twelve paces from this house was another, in manner of a Chapel,
with three or four gates, and in the midst thereof a pit of brackish water,
threescore and ten yards deep. Thereat stand six or eight men, appointed to
draw water for the people; who after their seuen-fold Ceremony come to the
brinke, and say, All this be for the honor of GOD, and the piteous GOD pardon
me my sins. Then do those other power upon them three buckets full of
Water, from the top of their heads to their feet, be their garments never so
costly.

The Carovan The Pilgrims going to the Mountain of Pardons.
having abode at Mecca five days, the night before the evening of their Feast,
the Captain, with all his Company, sets forwards, toward the Mountain of
Pardons, called Iabel Arafata, distant from Mecca fifteen miles. This
Mountain, or small Hill rather, is in compass two miles, environed round
about with the goodliest Plain that man's eye has seen, and that Plain
compassed with high Mountains. Upon the side toward Mecca there are many
pipes of clear fresh water, wherewith the people refresh themselves and their
Cattle. Adam and Eve, when they were banished Paradise, after they had been
separated forty years, one in Nubia, and the other in India (as you heard
before) met at this pleasant place, and here inhabited and built a little
house, which they call at this day Beyt-Adam, the house of Adam.

Hither come also the same day the other Carouans of Arabia and Damasco, and
all the inhabitants for ten days journey round about, so that at one time here
is to be seen above 200000. persons, and 300000, cattle. Now all this company
meeting together, the night before the feast, the three Hosts cast themselves
into a triangle, setting the mountain in the midst, and fill heaven and
earth with shouting-singing, hallowing, gunshot, and fire-workes all that
night. The next day being then feast, in silence they attend their sacrifices
and prayers only. And in the evening, they which have horses, mount thereon,
and approach as nigh unto the mountain as they can: others make the best shift
they can on foot; giving ever unto the Captain of Cairo the chief place, the
second to the Captain of Damasco, and the third to the Captain of Arabia. And
being all approached, there comes one of the S^ntones mounted on a Camel well
furnished, who at the other side of the mountain ascends five steps into a
pulpit, made for that purpose, and there makes a sermon to the people. The
Contents whereof, are the benefits which GOD has bestowed on them, deliverance
from Idolatry, giving them the house of Abraham, and the mountain of pardons:
adding that the merciful GOD commanded his Secretary Abraham, to build him an
house in Mecca, wherein his successors might be heard, at which time all the
mountains in the world came together thither with sufficiency of stones for
the building thereof, except that little low hill, which for poverty could
not go to discharge this debt: for the which it became sorrowful, and wept
thirty years, at the end whereof GOD in compassion said unto it, weep no
more my daughter, comfort thy self: I will cause all those that go to the
house, of my servant Abraham, that they shall not be absolved from their
sins, unless they first come to do thee reverence, to keep in this place
their holiest feast. And this I have commanded to my people by the mouth of my
friend and Prophet Mahomet. This said, he exhorts them to the love of GOD, to
prayer, and Alms. The Sermouended, at the sunsetting they make three prayers:
first for the Seriffo, second for the Grand Signior, the third for the People:
to which prayers all with one voice, cry Amin Ia Alla Amin Ia Alla; Be it so
Lord. Barthema adds to the Sermon the Cadi or Santones exhortation to weep
for their sins, and knock their breasts with invocation of Abraham, and
Isaac, to pray for the people of the Prophet; and reports further, that there
were killed on the first day more then thirty thousand Rams or Sheep toward
the West, and given to the poor; of which there were thirty or forty thousand.
Thus having had the Santones blessing, and saluted the Mountain of pardons
they return the way they came, in the midst of which way, is a place called
Mina: and a little from thence, four great pillars, two on each side of the
way. If any pass not through the midst of these, he loses all the merit of
his Pilgrimage. And from the Mount of pardons, till they be passed these
pillars, none dare look backward, for fear least his finnes which he has
lest in the mountain, return to him again.

Being past these Pillars every one lights down, seeking in this sandy field
fifty or threescore little stones, which they bind in an handkerchiefe and
carry to that place of Mina, where they stay five days, because at that time
there is a Fair, free and frank of all custom. And in this place are other
three Pillars not together, but set in diverse places, Monuments of those three
Apparitions, which the Devil made to Abraham, and to Barthema says Isaac.
Ismael his Son: for they now a days make no mention of Isaac, as if he had
never been borne. They say that when as Abraham at GODS command went to offer
his son Ismael, the devil dehorted him from the same: but seeing his labor
lost, he went to Ismael and bid him pity himself. But Ismael took up
stones and threw at him, saying I defend me with GOD from the Devil the
offender. These words the Pilgrims repeat in their visitation of these
pillars, hurling away the stones they had gathered. From hence half a mile is
a mountain, whither Abraham went to sacrifice his son. In the same is a
great den, whither the pilgrims resort to make their prayers, and there is a
great stone separated in the midst by the knife of Ismael (they say) at the
time of this sacrifice. Barthema reports that here at Mecca he saw two
Unicorns: which I mention, because since that time I have not found any
Author, which has testified the like sight. They were sent to the Seriffo for
a present to the Ethiopian King.

The Carouan departing for Medina, as soon as they come in sight thereof (they
call the place the Mountain of health) they alight, and going up the hill,
shoute with loud voices and say, Prayer and health be unto thee, O Prophet of
GOD, Prayer and health be upon the Obeloued of GOD. They proceed on their
journey, and lodge that night within three miles of Medina, and the next
morning are received with solemnity of the Governor. Medina, Description of
Medina.
is a City two miles in circuit, with fair houses of Lime and stone, and a
square Mosquita in the midst, less but more sumptuous then that of Mecca.
This Medina, called Tal Nabi, that is, of the Prophet, in Barthema's time
contained about three hundred houses, and was very barren, one garden of Dates
excepted: but now they have store of Fruits. This Temple is square, a hundred
paces in length, fourscore in breadth. It has in it an I Will made Arch-wise,
supported with four hundred Pillars, and supporting (as he says) three
thousand lamps. In one part of this Mosquita was a Library of forty five
Mahumeticall books. Also within the same (in a corner thereof) is a In
Barthema it is said that it was a grave ( fossa) under the earth: and there
were also Had, Othman, Bub^cher and Hom^^^^^ with the books of their
ordinances and Sects.
Tomb built upon four pillars with a Vault, exceeding in height the
Mosquita; being covered with Lead, and the top all in ameld with gold, and an
half Moon upon the top, wrought within very Artificially with gold. Below
there are round about great iron stairs ascending up to the midst of the
pillars, and in the midst lies buried the body of Mahumet (not in an iron
Chest attracted by Adamant at Mecca, as some affirm.) Or to say the truth,
neither here nor at Mecca can they show this seducers body. For the Captain of
that Carouan of Damasko, in which Barthema went on this Pilgrimage, offered to
the chief Priest of that Mosquita, three thousand Saraffi of gold, to show
him the body of the Nabi or Prophet; that (says he) being the only cause of
my coming. The Priest answered proudly: How can those eyes, wherewith thou
have committed so much evil in the world, see him by whom God has created
heaven and earth? The Captain replied, True Sir, but do me that favor, to
let me see his body and I will presently pluck out Which some are reported to
do indeed after so holy a sight, not further polluting their eyes.
mine eyes. The Priest answered, O Sir I will tell you the truth. It is true,
that our Prophet would die here to glue us good example: for he might have
died at Mecca, but such was his humility for our instruction: and presently
after he was dead, he was carried by the Angels into heaven. And where (says
the Captain) is IRSVS CHRIST the SON of Mary? The Priest answered, At the
feet of Mahomet.

In the night time by some fire-workes in the steeple, they would have gulled
the credulous people with opinion of miracle, using outcries in the night,
saying Mahomet would rise again: and when the Mamalukes could see no such
light shine forth of Mahomets Tomb, as they rumoured, they said it was because
they were slaves and weak in the faith, and could not see heavenly sights.

To return to the discovery of this supposed Sepulcher: Over the body they
have built a Tomb of speckled stone, a brace and half high, and over the same
another of Legmante foure-square in manner of a pyramid. Round about the
sepulcher there hangs a Curtain of silk: which hides the sepulture from
their sight, that stand without. Beyond this in the same Mosquita are other two
sepulchers of Fatima and Hali. The attendants on these sepulchers are fifty
Eunuchs, white and Taunie, of which, three only of the eldest and best
esteemed white Eunuchs, may enter within the Tomb: which they do twice a
day to light the Lamps, and for other services. The other attend on the
Mosquita and those two other sepulchers. Where every one may go and touch at
his pleasure, and take of the earth for devotion, as many do. The Captain
with great pomp presents that Pyramidlike Vestment (whereof you have heard)
for the Tomb, the Eunuchs taking away the old, and laying on the new: and
after this, other vestures for the ornament of the Mosquita. And the people
without deliver unto the Eunuchs, each man somewhat to touch the Tomb
therewith: which they keep as a relic with great devotion.

Here is a stately Hospital built by Cassachi or Rosa, the Wife of Great
Soliman, richly rented, and nourishing many poor people. A mile from the City
are certain houses, in one of which they say Mahomet dwelt, having on every
side many Date-trees, amongst which there are two growing out of one stock
exceeding high, which their Prophet forsooth graffed with his own hands. The
fruit thereof is always sent to Constantinople for a present to the
Graund-Signior, and is said to be the blessed fruit of the Prophet. Also there
is a little Mosquita wherein three places are counted Holy. The first they
affirm their Prophet made his first prayer in, after he knew GOD. The second
is that, whither he went when he would see the house of Abraham. Where when
he sat down to that intent, the mountains opened from the top to the
bottom, to show him the house, and after closed again as before. The third is
the midst of the Mosquita where is a Tomb made of Lime and Stone
foure-square, and full of Sand, wherein they say was buried that blessed Camel
which Mahomet was always wont to ride upon. On the other side of the City are
tombs of the Holy Mahumetans, Abubachar, Ottoman, Omar, which Bartemay says
were buried in the same Temple with Mahumet, and all under the earth. A days
journey from Medina is a steep mountain, having no passage but one narrow
path, which was made by Haly: who fleeing from the pursuing christians, and
having no way of escape, drew out his sword, and divided this mountain, and so
saved his life. The Captain at his return to When the Soldans reigned in
Egypt, they had a ceremony after the Pilgrimage, to cut in pieces a Camel
which had carried their Alcoran in great solemnity to the Soldans palace:
every particle of the beast and of his furniture being esteemed, and reserved
as a holy relike.
Cairo, is with a sumptuous Feast received of the Basha, and presented with a
garment of cloth of gold: he again presents the Alcoran, out of the chest
to the Basha to kiss, and then it is laid up again. By this time your
pilgrimage has more then wearied you.

CHAP. VII.
Of the successors of Mahomet, of their different Sects, and of the dispersing
of that religion through the world.

MAHOMET having with word and sword published his Alcoran (as you have heard)
his followers after his death succeeding in his place, exceeded him in tyranny.
Enbocar, surnamed Abdalla, undertook the defense of that faithless faith and
kingdom, and that (as his predecessor had done) partly by subtletie, partly by
force. For when as Mahumets Disciples had buried their new religion with their
old Mr., except a few of his kindred, he applied his wits to recall them; and
whereas Arab. Nob. ref.
Hali, Mahomets nearest kinsman and son in law disagreed from him, and was
persuaded by the Jews to profess himself a Prophet, with promise of their
best aid and assistance: Eubocar ( or Ebuber) reconciled him, and (as their
Arabian Chronicle witnesses) converted many Infidels, and slew the
gaine-sayers. He reigned one year, and three months, and thirteen days.
The next successor Aomar (says the same Author; Leo Leo l.8.
terms him Homar) ordained their prayers in the month Ramazan, and that the
Alcoran should be read through, which he caused to be written out, and united
in one book: he conquered Egypt by Hanir his Captain; after that Damasco,
Jerusalem, Gaza, and a great part of Syria were subdued. He reigned ten years,
and six months. Odmen.12. Hali.4 ye. Alhacen five months and twenty days.
Moaui 17. years. Iezid. three ^^ years eight months, who said that the
Prophet commanded not to blame, but to pray for and to obey Rulers, though
wicked: for ye shall have mercy, and they punishment.
Odmen or Ozimen succeeded, and reigned twelve years: and after him Hali; and
next to him his son Alhatem; and then Moani the great conqueror, etc. These
four Enbocar, Aomar, Ozimen, and Hali are the four great Doctors of the
Mahumetan law: and Mahomet before his death prophesied that they should
succeed him, and of their worthiness.

But as Mahomet had pretended the name of Gabriel to the dreams of Sergius,
and other Apostata's of the christians and Jews, disagreeing both with the
truth and themselves: so it was not long, that this untempered mortar would
hold together these buildings. For the Ref.Ara.Nob.
Alcoran being (according to diverse copies thereof,) read diversely, was cause
of different Sects among them. Ozimen, to prevent the danger hereof, commanded
that all the copies of their law should be brought and delivered into the
hands of Zeidi and Abdalla; who conferring their copies, should make one book,
and, where they dissented, should read according to the copy of Corais. Thus
these two, according to the Kings Edict, to stablish an uniformity in the
reading of the Alcoran, having out of all those copies framed one to be
authentical, burned all others. Yet were they deceived of their hopes, partly
because Hali, Abitalib, and Ibenmuzed would not bring in their books, of which
that of Hali was the same which Mahumet had left, and was after by the Jews
altered, putting out and in at their pleasure: and partly, because that Book,
which they had thus culled out of the rest to remain Canonical, was lost, and
of the four copies which they had written thereof, by fire and negligence all
perished. Eletragig would have used the like policy after; but this
many-headed serpent, which could not in the shell be killed, much less in his
riper grouth could be reformed.

Those four Doctors aforesaid, aemulous of each other, intending their own
private ends, sowed the seeds then, which fructify in their venomous
multiplication till this day. G. Bot Ben. Curio calls these Sects Melici,
followed in Africa; Asafij, professed in Arabia and Syria; Arambeli, in Armenia
and Persia; Buanisi, in Alexandria and Assyria; and all four are followed in
Cairo.l.5.1.
Hali or Alli was author of the sect Imemia, which was embraced of the
Persians, Indians, and of many Arabians, and the Gelbines of Africa. Ozimen or
Odmen began the Sect Baanesia or Xefaia, and has in diverse countries his
followers. Homar founded the Anefia, followed of the Turks, Syrians, and in
Zahara in Afrike. Eubocar (otherwise called Ebuber, or Abubequer) taught the
Sect Melchia, generally possessing Arabia and Africa.

From these four in process of time arose other 68. Sects Sarrac.
68. Sects of name, besides other pedling factions of smaller reckoning.
Amongst the rest the Morabites have been famous; living for the most part as
Heremites, and professing a Moral Philosophy, with principles different from
the Alcoran. One of these not many years since, showing the name of Mahomet in
his breast (there imprinted with Aqua fortis, or some such like matter) raised
up a great number of Arabians in Afrike, and laid siege to Tripolis: where
being betrayed by one of his Captains, his skin was sent for a present to
the Grand Signior. These Morabites affirm, that when Hali fought, he killed a
hundred thousand Christians with one stroke of his sword, which was a hundred
cubits in length.

The Cobtini are a sect ridiculous. One of them showed himself riding in the
country of Algier, on a Reed, rained and bridled as a horse; much honored,
for that on this horse this Ass (had as he said) rid a hundred leagues in one
night. I. Leo l.3. writes, that one Elefacin had written at large of the
Mahumetan Sects: of which he reckons threescore and twelve principal (which
agrees with our former number) every one accounting his own to be good and
true, in which a man may attain salvation. And yet Leo there adds, that in
this age there are not found above two. But two principal factions Mahumetan,
at this day.
One is that of Leshari; which in all Turkey, Arabia, and Africa is embraced:
the other Imamia; current in Persia and Corosan: (of which in his proper place
more.) So that by Leo's judgment all which follow the rule Leshari or Hashari
are Catholic Mahumetans; although of these the same author affirms, that in
Cairo and all Egypt are four religions different from each other, in
spiritual or Ecclesiastical ceremonies, and also in this, as concerning their
civil and Canon law; all founded on the Mahumetan scripture in times past, by
four learned men, diversely construing the general rules to such particulars
as seemed to them fitter for their followers; who disagreeing in opinion, agree
in affection, and converse together without hatred or vpbraiding each other. As
for those other sects, it seems that they are for the most part long since
vanished: and those differences which remain, consist rather in diversity of
rule, and order of profession, then in differing Sects and heresies of
religion: except in some few which yet remain, of which 1.Leo l.3.
Leo thus reports: Fourscore years after Mahumet, one Elhesenibnu Abilhaseu
gave certain rules to his disciples, contratie to the Alcoran-principles: but
writ nothing. About a hundred years after Elharit Ibnu Esed of Bagaded writ
a book unto his Disciples, condemned by the Calipha and Canonists. But about
fourscore years after that, another great Clarke revived the same doctrine,
and had many followers; yet he and they were therefore condemned to death. But
obtaining to have trial of his opinions by disputation, he overthrew his
Adversaries, the Mahometane Lawyers: and the Califa favored the said sect, and
erected-Monasteries for them. Their sect continued till Malicsah of the Nation
of the Turks persecuted the same. But twenty years after it was again
renewed, and one Elgazzuli (a learned man) writ seven books, reconciling these
Sectaries and the Lawyers together: which reconciliation continued till the
coming of the Tartars: and Asia and Afrike was full of these reformers of
their Law. In old time none but learned men might be admitted professors
hereof: but within these last hundredth years every ignorant Idiot professes
it, saying that learning is not necessary, but What difference herein, between
the Mahumerane and the Separatist?
the holy spirit does reveal to them which have clean hearts the knowledge of
the truth. These contrary to the Alcoran sing loue-songs and dances, with some
fantastical ecstasies; affirming themselves to be ravished of divine love.
These are great Gluttons: they may not marry, but are reputed Sodomites.

The same our Author writes of some which teach, that by good works, fasting
and abstinence, a man may attain a nature Angelical, having his mind so
purified that he cannot sin, although he would. But he must first pass
through fifty degrees of discipline: And although he sin before he be past
these fifty degrees, yet GOD does not impute it to him. These observe strange
and inestimable Fasts at the first: after, they live in all pleasures of the
world. Their rule was written in four volumes by a learned and eloquent man,
Essehrauar: and by Ibnul-farid another Author, in exact and most learned verse.
That the spheres, elements, Planets, and stars are one GOD, and that no faith
nor law can be erroneous, because that all men (in their minds) intend to
worship that which is to be worshipped. And they believe that the knowledge of
GOD is contained in one man, who is called Elcorb, elected and partaker of GOD,
and in knowledge as GOD. There are other forty men amongst them, called
Elauted, that is Tronchi.
dunces, because of their less knowledge. When the Elcorb or Elcoth dies, his
successor is chosen out of these: and into that vacant place of the forty, they
choose one out of another number of seventy. They have a third inferior number
of a hundred threescore and five (their title I remember not) out of which they
choose, when any of the threescore and ten die. Their law or rule enioineth
them to wander through the world in manner of fools, or of great sinners, or
of the vilest amongst men. And under this cloak many are most wicked men, going
naked without hiding their shame, and have to deal with women in the open and
common streets like beasts. Of this base sort are many in Tunis, and far more
in Egypt, and most of all in Cairo. I my self (says our author) in Cairo in
the street called Bain Elcasraim, saw one of them with mine eyes take a
beautiful Dame coming out of the Bathe, and laid her down in the midst of
the street, and carnally knew her, and presently when he had left the woman,
all the people ran to touch her clothes, because a holy man had touched them.
And they said, that this Saint seemed to do a sin, but that he did it not.
Her Husband knowing of it, reckoned it a rare favor and blessing of GOD, and
made solemn feasting, and gave alms for that cause. But the Judges which
would have punished him for the same, were like to be flaine of the rude
multitude: who have them in great reputation of sanctity, and every day give
them gifts and presents.

There are another sort, that may be termed Caballists: which fast strangely,
nor do they eat the flesh of any creature, but have certain meats ordained
and appointed for every hour of the day and night, and certain particular
prayers, according to the days and months numbering their said prayers: and
use to carry upon them some square things, painted with Characters and numbers.
They affirm that the good spirits appear, and acquaint them with the affairs
of the world. An excellent Doctor, named Boni, framed their rule and prayers,
and how to make their squares: and it seems to me (who have seen the work)
to be more Magical then Cabalasticall. One book shows their prayers and
fastings: the second, their square: the third, the virtue of the fourscore and
nineteen names of GOD, which I saw in the hand of a Venetian Jew at Rome.
There is another rule in these sects, called Sunach, of certain Heremites
which live in woods, and solitary places, feeding on nothing but herbs and
wild fruits, and none can particularly know their life, because of this
solitarines. Thus fair Leo.

Other Heremites they have of another sort: one is mentioned by Leo, Leo lib.4.
who had five hundred horse, a hundred thousand sheep, two hundred beeues, and
of offerings and alms betwixt four and five thousand Ducates, his same great
in Asia and Afrike, his disciples many, and five hundred people dwelling with
him at his charges; to whom he enioineth not penance, nor any thing: but gives
them certain names of GOD, and bids them with the same to pray unto him so
many times a day. When they have learned this, they return home: he has a
hundred tents for strangers, his cattle, and family: he has four wives,
besides slaves, and (by them) many children sumptuously apparelled. His fame is
such that the King of Teleusin is afraid of him: and he pays nothing to any:
such veneration have they toward him, reputing him a Saint. Leo says he spoke
with him, and that this Heremite showed him Magicke-bookes: and he thought that
this his great estimation did come by false working of the true Science: so the
heremite termed Magic.

But these Heremites we cannot so well reckon a Sect, as a religious order; of
which sort there are diverse in these Mahumetan Nations, as in our ensuing
discourse shall appear. To return therefore to the consideration of the
means used to prevent the variety of Sects among them: The Caliphs sought to
remedy these inconveniences by their best policy. Io.Bot.Ben.
Moaui about the year of our LORD 770. assembled a general counsel of their
learned men to consult about an uniformity: but they disagreeing among
themselves, he chose six men of the most learned, and shut them up in a house
together with their Scriptures, commanding them that out of those copies
disagreeing (as you have heard) they should choose that should seem best. These
reduced the doctrine of Mahomet into six books: forbidding any on pain of
death to speak or write otherwise of their Law. But because the Arabians of
subtle and piercing wit, which studied Philosophy in the Universities of
Bagdet, Marocco, Cordoua and other places, could not but spy and discern the
mad folly of the Law, so palpable to any reasonable judgment: it Fr.
Richard.c.13.
was therefore ordained, that the Philosophy lecture should be taken away,
and in place thereof they should read the Alcoran; providing, for all these
students of their Law, their expenses out of the public charge, and
inhibiting all further study in Philosophy: insomuch that they now (says our
Author, who himself was a student in that University) repute him not a good
Saracen, who is addicted to that study. This Friar Richard mentions an other
Prophet, named Solemn, had in estimation with these Babylonians, which was after
slain by the Tartars. He and Cardinal Cusanus affirm, that the Saracens of
the East differ in their Alcoran from those of the West, making the first five
chapters but one; and that they differ in the exposition thereof, and in the
same schools or Universities, one sect condemns another.

But in these times the Mahumetane professors are chiefly distinguished by the
several Nations; of which are four principal: the Arabians, Persians,
Turks, and Tartars: to which we may add the Mogore, as a fifth: whom the
Jesuits (in their Epistles) report to halt from his former Mahumetisme, and to
incline to Gentilisme. Of all these, the Arabians are most zealous in their
superstition; the Persians most agree to reason and nature; the Tartars are
more heathenish and simple; the Turks are the freeest and most Martial. The
Arabians account it their peculiar glory, that Mahumet was of that Nation, and
that Mecca and Medina are there seated: and therefore have labored in the
days of their former puissance, by the Sword, since, by their traffic and
preaching, to spread their Mahumetisme through the world. Their first seducers
had possessed Syria and Paleflina: Homar had added Egypt, and in a short time
their successors had prevailed in Asia, Afrike, and Europe, as we Sup.c.2.
have before showed.

They have been such in Arms: and in diligence of preaching they have been
as forward, and so continue. Io.Bot.Ben.
Seven hundred years since, Perimal reigning in Malabar, they there sowed
their Tares: and the more easily to take those Ethnikes in their net, they took
their Daughters in marriage; a matter of much consequence, in regard of their
wealth, and practiced of them to this day. They were Authors of great gain
unto them by their trades, and traffic for spicerie: and were suffered to
inhabit, and plant Colonies amongst them. By their means, Calicut, of a
final thing, became a great and rich City. And Perimal himself was perverted
by them to their faith: who, zealously inclined to their persuasions, resolved
to end his days at Mecca, and put himself on the voyage with some ships of
Pepper, and other things of price, but perished by tempest in the way. From
Malabar they passed to the Maldiuae, and Zeilan, Somatra, Iaua, Molucca, the
Philippinaes, and in the continent to Cambaia, Bengala, Siam, Malucca, Ior,
Pam, and the huge kingdom of China, preaching and planting their
superstitions, as in the particular Histories of these Nations shall further
appear. They are in this respect so zealous, that even the Arabian mariners
will stay behind in the Countries of the Ethnikes there to diuulge this their
sect: and in the year 1555. one of them pierced as far as Iapon, there to
have laid this leaven: but the Portugalls in these Eastern parts, treading in
the same steps, by their traffic and preachings have much hindered their
proceedings. The Tartars, Persians and Turks, require longer and seuereall
discourses in their due place; and first we will speak of them which are first
in this rank, the greatest of all Mahumetane States, the Turks.

They reckon mad men very holy and Saints: and therefore Vertomannus fained
himself mad, so escaping the furious zeal of the Moors, and his straight
imprisonment. But this and many other their superstitions we shall find in
the Turk, and therefore forbear now to report them.

Damsco, sometime (as is said) was their Patriarchall Sea, and continued famous
for the Mahumetane superstition long after. It is reported, That in the time of
Tamerlane, the magnificence of their Temple was most admirable: having forty
great Porches in the circuit thereof: and within, nine thousand Lamps hanging
from the roof, all of gold and silver. He spared the City at first for the
Temple, and after destroyed both it and them, as Libr.1.cap.15.
we have before related.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Turkish Nation: their original, and proceedings.

ALthough some may think that I have been so tedious in the relation of the
Mahumetan opinions and superstitions, that, to speak any thing more, would
seem but as pouring water into a full Sea: Yet, because there is in this World
nothing certain, but uncertainty, it being divine prerogative to be Yesterday,
today, the same for ever: and that this Saracenicall Religion has sustained
her chances and changes according to the diversity of times and places, where
it is and has been professed: so do I hold it fit, as we have seen the
foundation, to behold also the frames and fabriques thereon builded, and from
that fountain (or sincke-hole rather) of superstition, to lead you along the
gutters and streams thence derived. And because the Turks are preeminent in
all those things which this profession accounts eminent, it is meetest to
give them the first place here, which else where take it and after we have set
down a brief History of that Nation, and the proceedings of their state, to
describe their theory and opinions, and then their practice and rites of
Religion. But before we come to the discovery of their religion, it is not
amiss to search the beginning and increase of this Nation.

The name of Turks signifies (says Chitraus) Sheepheards, or Heard-men: and
such it seems was their ancient profession, as of the rest of the Scithians
unto this day. Nicephorus Lir.18.ca.30
speaks of the Turks, and places them about Bactria: their chief City he
calls Taugast, which is supposed to be the work of Alexander. Their Religion
he says at that time was to worship the Fire, Air, Water and Earth, which
they adore, and sing Hymns to. They acknowledge GOD the maker of Heaven and
Earth, to whom they sacrifice, horse, kine, and sheep: they have Priests which
divine of things to come. The Prince of Taugast, they called the Son of GOD:
They worship Images. The Prince spends the night with seven hundred women.
The Tartars have now possessed the same Country; but long before, the same
rites: as you may read in our History of them. To derive them (as some doc)
from Trojans and Jews, is some what far Turci quasi Teucri, Richer. de reb.
Turc. and Mart. Barletues de Scodrensi expug lib.1. mention this opinion, and
Andr. a lacuna.
fetched: nor is there much likelihood, that they should receive their name of

most and best Authors. There are which bring a long genealogy from Noabs
Arc, unto the Ottoman family: herein disagreeing, while some will have Magog,
others Tubal the Author of their Nation. Leunclavius Io.Leunel. hist. Musulm.
recites and refuteth the same. He writes the name Iurki, alleging
Herodotus for his Author: and cites many Authors to prove that they descended
of the Vnni or Vngri, which were called Turks, of which there were two sorts,
one westerly in Pannonia, an other easterly near Persia, called by the
Persians Magores, he concludes that the Vnnior Iurchi came from Iuchra or
Iuchria (whence the name Iuchri might easily be deffected to Iurchi) beyond
Tanais; and first after they had forsaken their own Country, settled themselves
near Maeotis, from whence they passed to Chazaria, and some went westward to
Pannonia, some eastward to Armenia, and thence into Persia.

Many probable Arguments might be brought, to prove that they descended of the
Scythians, whose wandering shepheardly life, both the name and their practice
(in old times, and in some places still) expresses. The first Expedition and
military employment which I have read of the Turks, was
P.Bizar.hist.Pers.libr.5.
under Varamus a rebellious Persian, above a thousand years since, when
Cosroes was King of Persia, and Mauritius the Roman Emperor: at what time many
of them were slain, and many taken, which confessed, that famine had forced
them to those wars, for which cause they marked themselves with a black
Cross; a ceremony which they said they had learned of the Christians, thinking
thereby to expel hunger. This hungry Nation has since been a greedy and
insatiate deuourer of Nations. Another expedition of theirs (which some reckon
the first) Knol.Turc.hist.
was in the year 755, or after an other account, 844; at which time, passing
through the Georgian Country, then called Iberia, they first seized on a part
of the greater Armenia, which their Posterity holds at this day, called of
them Turcomania. In this wide and spacious Country they romed up and down,
without certain habitation, a long time with their families and herds of
cattle, like the ancient Scithian Nomades, and the Tartars, and the same
Turcoman Nation at this day.

When as the Saracens Empire grew now unwieldy, through her own greatness, and
the Soldans, which were wont to conquer for the Chaliph, began now to share
with him in his large Dominion: Mohomet (then Sultan or Sultan of Persia) was
for this cause hardly beset with the Chaliph of Babylon; assailed also on the
other side by the Indians. He sought to strengthen himself against these
enemies with the new friendship of these Turks, of whom he obtained for his
aid three thousand hardy soldiers, Hist.Musulm.libr.1. Theodor Gaza de orig.
Turcar. epist. Io.Bapt. Egnat.de orig. Turc.
under the conduct of Togra Mucalet the son of Mikeil a valiant Captain, and
chief of the Selzuccian tribe or family, whom the Greeks commonly call
Tangrolipia, and some Selduc, or Sad^e. By the help of this Tangrolipix,
Mahomet the Persian Sultan overcame Pisasiris the Chaliph. The Turks, after
this war, desiring leave to pass over the river Araxis to their Countrymen,
were both denied, and threatened, if they again should seek to depart.
Whereupon they withdrew themselves into the Desert of Carauonitis; living
there, and thence making roads into the Countries adjoining. Mahumet sent
against them twenty thousand men, which by a sudden surprise in the night,
Tangrolipix defeated, and furnished himself with their spoils. And now durst
Tangrolipix show his face in the field, where his army was increased by the
resort of lawless persons, seeking after spoil. Mahomet on the other side,
impatient of his loss, put out the eyes of the Captains, which had the
leading of the army, and threatened to attire the soldiers, that had fled, in
women's apparel: and raising an other great army, set forward against
Tangrolipix, who was now fifty thousand strong, and was presently made stronger
by those threatened soldiers, who fled from their Lord unto him. They met at
Ispahan (a City of Persia) and there Mahomet falling with his horse, brake his
neck: upon which mischance both armies coming to agreement, by common
consent, proclaimed Tangrolipix Tangrolipix, first Sultan amongst the Turks,
An.Do. 1030. some call him Tangrolipix and some Tangroipix.
Sultan in his stead; and so made him King of Persia, and the Dominion
thereunto pertaining, which was done Anno 1030.

Tangrolipix opened the passages of Araxis to the rest of his Countrymen,
whom he exalted to the highest places of command, so bridling the Persians,
and he and his receiving in their new Conquests the yoke of the Mohammedan
Religion. Ambition inciting him to further exploits, he warred also upon
Pisasiris the Chaliph: and after diverse overthrows, slew him, and seized on
his state. He sent Cutlu-Muses his kinsman against the Arabians, by whom he
was discomfited: whereat aggrieued, he went against them himself, but with
like success. He sent Asan his brothers son to invade Media, who in that
enterprise was slain: he sent again Habraime Alim his brother with an army of
an hundred thousand men, who took prisoner Liparites Governor of Iberia, (who
came to aid the Emperors Lieutenant in Media) whom Tangrolipix frankely set
free, and sent his ambassador to the Emperor, proudly demanding him to
become his subject.

Such happes, and such hopes had Tangrolipix, the first Turk that ever was
honored with a Diadem. His son Knolls Turkish history.
and successor Axan took Diogenes the Emperor of Constantinople prisoner in
the field: But Cutlu-Muses with his cousin Melech (who in his Fathers days had
fled into Arabia) rebelling, and taking arms against him; as Axan was ready to
join battle with them, the Caliph (who retained the highest place still in
their superstition, although dispoyled of his Temporalties) setting aside all
his pontifical formality, whereby he was bound not to go out of his own
house, thrust himself between these armies: and with the reverence of his
place and person, together with his persuasions, moved them to desist, and to
stand to his arbitrament: which was, that Axan the Sultan should still enjoy his
dominions entirely: And that Cutlu-Muses, and his sons aided by him, should
invade the Constantinopolitan Empire, and should be absolute and only Lords of
whatsoever they could gain thereof. There was never any thing to that impiety
more commodious, nor to our Religion more dangerous. For by this means
Cutlu-Muses with his sons in a short time conquered all Media, with a great
part of Armenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Bithynia; which their designs were
much furthered by treasons and dissensions in the Greek Empire. Axan the Sultan
also gave to his kinsmen Ducat and Melech, the government of Aleppo, and
Damasco, with the adjoining parts of Syria, by that means to incroach upon the
Egyptian Caliph, which accordingly they in a short time did.

But these their haughty attempts were stayed, and being now in the flower,
were cut shorter by that fortunate Expedition The memorable Expeditio of the
christian Princes in to the Holy Land. Historia helli sacri G. Tyrij, and many
others write at large of these wars.
of the Christian Princes of the West, agreed upon at the Council of
Claremont, and performed by Gualter Sensauier; Peter the Heremite, first and
principal mouer hereof; Godfrey Duke of Lorraine, with his two brethren
Eustace and Baldwin, of the honorable house of Buillon; Hugh surnamed the
Great, brother to Philip the French King; Raimond and Robert Earls of
Flanders; Robert of Normandy son to William the Conqueror; Stephan de Valois
Earl of Chartiers; Ademar the Popes Legate; Bohemund Prince of Tarentum, and
others, conducting, as the most received opinion is, three hundred thousand
soldiers, in defense of the Christian faith against the Turks and Saracens,
which both overthrew the Turks in the lesser Asia, and recovered also the holy
Land. The principality; or (as some style it) the Kingdom of Antioch was given
by common consent to Bohemnnd Prince of Tarentum; the Kingdom of Jerusalem, to
Robert: who (hearing of his Fathers death) refused it in hope of England; and
Godfrey of Buillon was saluted King.

The Turks and Saracens seeking to recover that which they had lost, lost also
themselves: a hundred thousand of them being slain in one battle: the like
success had the Turks after against Conrade, the Emperor at Meander: leaving
for trophies and triumphall arches to the Christians, huge heaps, or hills
rather, of their bones. Hereunto helped the dissentions among the Turks, and
divisions of their state among diverse brethren. The Egyptians also paid tribute
to the Christians: which Dargan the Sultan detaining, he was by Almericus the
king of Jerusalem overthrown in battle. Noradine the Turk, king of Damasco,
sent thither also Saracon to aid Sanar the Sultan (before expulsed) to recover
his state from this Dargan: but he having won certain towns, kept them to
himself, so that Sanar betook him to the patronage of Almericus, who overthrew
Saracon in battle, and after besieged and took Alexandria, and Pelusium,
seeking also to conquer Egypt to himself; but indeed (as the event proved) so
subverted his own state. For Sanar sought help of Saracon, and for fear of
both their forces, Almericus left Egypt. Saracon, moved with ambition,
treacherously slew the Sultan, and by the Chaliph was appointed Sultan, the
first of the Turks that ever enjoyed the same, to whom Saladine his nephew
succeeded. He (not respecting the majesty of the Chaliph, as the Sultans before
had done) struck out his brains with his horse-mans mace, and rooted out all
his posterity; the better to assure himself and his Turkish successors in the
possession of that kingdom, under whom it continued to the time of the
Mamalukes. Noradin also the Turk being dead, the nobility disdaining the
government of Melechsala his son (yet but a youth) betrayed Damasco betrayed to
Saladine.
that state unto Saladine. And thus did he hem in the kingdom of Jerusalem on
both sides: and not long after, Aleppo was betrayed unchristianly into his
hands by a traitor, which governed the same for the Christians: Neither was it
long, before he had (through discord and treason amongst the Christians)
obtained Jerusalem lost again Anno, 1187.
Jerusalem it self, anno 1187. and after Ascalon, and Antioch also: Neither
could the Christians of the West ever recover the possession of that kingdom;
the cause continuing the same, which before had lost it, viz. dissension and
treachery, as the examples of Richard and Edward (first of those names) Kings
of this land do show.

About 1202. years after Christ, the Tartars (of whom in their due place)
having conquered East, West, North, and South, among others overthrew that
Togrian kingdom of the Turks in Persia, 170. years before founded by
Tangrolipix. The Turks which remained (driven to seek shelter from this
violent storm) fled out of Persia into Asia the less: where Cutlu-Muses his
successors (their countrymen) inioyed some part of the country. And there many
of them ariuing under the conduct of Aladin the son of Kei Husreu, descended
also of the Selzuccian family in Persia, taking the opportunity offered by the
discord of the Latins with the Greeks, and the Greeks among themselves, seized
upon Cilicia, with the countries thereabout; and there first at Sebastia, and
afterward at Iconium, erected their new kingdom, bearing the name of the
Aladin Hist.Musul. man. Leunclauij libr.1.
Kings or Sultans.

The same Tartars under the conduct of Haalon, sent by Mango the great Cham,
having conquered and starued the Chaliph of Babylon (as is said before)
overthrew the Turkish kingdom of Damasco, and rased Anno Dom.12.0.
Aleppo; the other arm of this fair and far-spreading tree being surprised by
the Mamaluke slaves, who after Haalons departure recovered Syria and Palestina,
and were again with great slaughter dispossessed of the same by Cassanes
Haiton.Armen.
a Tartarian prince, who repaired Jerusalem, and gave it to the christians of
Armenia, and other the Eastern countries. But Cassanes retiring into Persia to
pacify new broils, the Sultan recovered the same; the Christians of the
Westneglecting the just defense thereof, specially through the pride and
contention of Boniface the Pope (contrary to his name) filling a great part of
Europe with faction and quarrels.

The Turks in Asia paid tribute to the Tartar Cham, till (succession in the
blood of Aladin failing) this kingdom was diversely rent, every one catching so
much as his might could bestow on his ambition. The greatest of these sharers
was Knolles Turkish history.
one Caraman Alusirius, who took unto himself the city Iconium, with all the
country of Cilicia, and some part of the frontires of Lycaonia, Pamphylia,
Caria, and the greater Phrygia, as far as Philadelphia; all which was after of
him called Caramania. Next neighbor and sharer to him was Saruchan: of whom
Ionia Maritima is called Saruchan-ili. The greatest part of Lydia, with some
part of the greater Mysia, Troas, and Phrygia fell to Carasius, called of him
Carasi-ila some part of Pontus, and the country of Paphlagonia fell to the sons
of Omer, which country is called Bolli. These all were of the Selzuccian
family. But the foundation of far higher fortunes were then laid much lower
by divine providence, exalting Ottoman of the Oguzian tribe or family, who then
held one only poor Lordship, called Suguta in Bythinia, not far from Olympus,
given before to his father Erthogrul in meed of good service: which he
increasing by winning somewhat from the weaker Christians his neighbors,
afterward erected into a kingdom which has devoured so great a part of the
world, as is this day subject to the Turkish greatness. When as the Tartars
chased (as is said) the Turks out of their Persian kingdom, which Tangrolipix
had there established, one Solomon a Turk (of the Ogusian Tribe) reigned in

over a small Realm, which for fear of those Tartars he also forsook, and
with a thousand of his people, fled, and seated himself in a part of Armenia
about Erzerum; and after, upon some better hopes, resolved to return again
into Persia, but in seeking to pass the River Euphrates, was drowned, and his
followers dispersed, following their ancient trade of wandering heards-men. He
left behind him four sons Sencur-Teken, Iundogdis, Ertogrul the father of
Ottoman, and Dunder. The two eldest returned into Persia. The two youngest
stayed, and with them 400. Families, with their tents and carts, their moveable
houses. And insinuating into the Sultan Aladins good liking, by suit and
desert, this Ertogrul was rewarded, as ye have heard, being made Lord of
Suguta, and Warden of those Marches: and lived there in security, till he was
of great years, and had seen much alteration in that state. He died anno 1289.
having lived ninety three years. And him succeeded by common consent, as L.
over the Ogusian Turks, his son Ottoman, saluted therefore by the name of
Osman Beg or Lord Osman. He first Laon. Chalcondyles libr.1. Abraham Zacuthi
has written a Chronicle of these Turks, together with the Saracens translated
by Ios. Scalig.Can. Isag.libr.2.
got into his subjection a great part of the Castles and Forts of the greater
Phrygia; equally protecting his subjects both Christians and Turks: he
conquered Nice, the name whereof is reverend for the first general Council of
Christendom; and Aladin the second, Sultan of Iconium sent unto him a fair
ensign, a Sword and Robe, with ample charters, that whatsoever he took from
the christians, should be his own: and that public prayers should be said in
their temples for his death, which was of him humbly accepted, and such prayers
made by one Dursu, whom he had appointed Bishop and Judge of Carachisar, anno
1300. Neapolis was made his seat royal. He fished so well in the troubled
stream of the Greek Empire, that he subdued the most part of Phrygia, Mysia,
and Bythinia: and Prusa after a long siege was yielded unto his son Orchanes,
and made the royal seat of the Ottoman-kings, where Ottoman himself was
buried 1228. His son Orchanes succeeded: Aladin his brother contenting himself
with a private life, who after built two Mahumetan churches, and another at
Prusa. Orchanes also erected in Nice a sumptuous temple, appointing a preacher
to preach to the people every friday, and two fair Abbeys: in the one of
which, he with his his own hands served the strangers and poor the first
dinner. He was the first that builded Abbeys among the Turks, followed herein by
most of his successors. He got Nicomedia, and the towns adjoining. He also wan
all Charasia, and at his return built a Church and Abbey at Prusa, placing
therein religious men, sought out with all diligence. His son Solomon first
of the Turks that possessed any foot in Europe, crossed the Hellespont, and
wan the castle Zemeenic, and after that Maditus, receptacles for the Turks,
which came over in multitudes; he transporting Christians into Asia, to dwell
in their room. And after, An.Do.1358.
he wan Gallipoli, spoiling the country, and winning from the Greeks who were
negligent in preventing or remedying this danger. But Solomon dying with a
fall, his old father Orchanes lived not two months after; a prince very zealous
in his superstition, who besides building diverse churches, abbeys, colleges,
and cells, allowed pensions to all such as could in the church say the Book of
Mahomets law by heart, and competent maintenance to the Judges, that they
should not sell justice.

Amurath which succeeded, exceeded him in this blind zeal. He kept in awe the
Turkish Princes in Asia, and wan many Towns and Castles in Thracia: and
amongst others, Adrianople the seat royal of the Turkish Kingdom, until
Constantinople was after subdued. This was done 1362. He ordained, that every
fifth captive of the Christians above fifteen years old, should be taken up
for the Turkish King, which were distributed among the Turkish husbandmen in
Asia, to learn the Turkish language, religion, and manners; and after two or
three years, choice was made of the better sort, to attend upon the Princes
person, and for his wars, called Ianizars, that is, new soldiers: which
Order after grew to great account, and is yet a principal pillar of the

to poison, as some think, by composition with the grand Seignior. He had some
wars against the Mamalukes, some against the Christians, more unnatural
against his brother, but most most unnatural and monstrous against his son
Selym. His conquests were in Cilicia, Caramania, and Peloponnesus.

Selim, not content to have thrust his father out of the Throne, aspired to a
further effect of aspiring ambition, depriving him of life, from whom himself
had received it. To this end he corrupted a Jew, Baiazets Physician (whom
Knolles calls Hamon; but Menavino Ii.5.ca.22. relates all this at large
Menavino an eye-witnes, names him Vstarabi) who with the powlder of beaten
Diamonds poisoned him: and for reward, when he claimed Selims promise, had his
head stricken off in the tyrants presence. So much did he hate the traitor,
whose treason he so much loved. The body of Bajazet was embalmed and interred
at Constantinople, in a beautiful Sepulcher near to the Meschit which himself
had built, and Priests were appointed, which should every day pray for his
Soul. Two of his Pages did Selim put to death for wearing black and mourning
apparel for their Masters death: and three others (whereof Menavino was one)
hardly, by entreatie of Selims daughters, and some Bassacs, escaped.

This Viper, that spared not his father, proceeded with bloody hands to make
an end of the rest of his Ottoman-kindred, beginning with five sons of his
brethren, and adding the remnant, as he could bring them into his power. And
having thus founded his Throne in bloody cruelties of his own at home, no
marvel if abroad his proceedings were no less cruel and bloody toward his
enemies. Of whom, the first which offered himself (after his domestical
wars appeased) was Ismael the Sophi Henricus Penia de gestis sophi cont. Turc.
; who with thirty thousand Persian horsemen gave battle to Selym
(notwithstanding his three hundred thousand Turks) where was fought in
Armenia, near Coy, a terrible and mortal battle betwixt them, and the
Turks at last (very hardly) prevailing, by help of their great Ordinance: but
so little cause had they to rejoice of their victory, that this is reckoned
among the dismal and disastrous days, termed by the Turks, the only day of
Doom. The next Anno Domi 1515.
year he entered again into the Persian Confines, and there took Ciamassum,
overthrew Aladeules the Mountaine-King, who reigned in Taurus and Antitaurus,
and slew him. But his most fortunate attempts were against Campson Gaurus, the
Egyptian Sultan, and his forces of Mamalukes, whom by his multitudes
(notwithstanding their fame and valor, not inferior to any soldiers of the
World) he overcame; the Sultan himself being left dead in the place, August 7.
1516.

Neither had Tomumbeius, his successor, any better success, but succeeded as
well in his fortune, as to his Scepter, who by treason of his own, and power
of his enemy, lost both his life and Kingdom; all Egypt and Syria thereby
accrewing to the Ottoman. Selym from thenceforth purposing to turn his forces
from the Sunnerising against the Christians in the West, came to his own
Sunne-set, the period of his reign and life: a miserable disease (as an angry
Pursuivant) exacting and redemaunding his bloody cruel spirit, an implacable
officer of that most implacable Tyrant to Tyrants, and Prince of Princes,
Death, who at last conquered this Conqueror; or rather (if his Licet ossa
iacent, animus bella qu^rit. Phi. Lonicer. to.1.lib.1.
Epitaph written on his Tomb say true) conveyed him hence to seek new
Conquests. His disease was a Canker in the back (eating out a passage for his
Viperous soul) which made him rotte while he lived, and become a stinking
burden to himself and others. He died in September, 1520, having before
bequeathed bloodshed and desolation to the Christians, and ordained Solomon,
his son and heir, executor of that his hellish Testament: And further, to
excite him thereunto, had left him the lively counterfeit of himself, with
sundry bloody Precepts annexed: His title therein written, was, Sultan Selym

Nephew of GOD. We may add, Heir apparent to the Devil, that breathed his

A Continuation of the Turkish Wars and Affairs: together with the
succession of the Great Turks, till this present year 1612.

Solomon, surnamed the Magnificent, succeeded his father Selym in place, and
surmouned him exceedingly in exploites. Belgrade, (which ominous name did
presage happiness unto him in his Wars and Proceedings) was the beginning of
his Conquests, won by the Turks August 29, 1521. See the History at large in
Hakl.to.2. and Jacob.Fontanus Brugensis.

Hungary, and in the field discomfiteth and kills Jews, and slays or
captiueth two hundred thousand Hungarians in that Expedition, 1526. He enters
Hungary the second time, 1529, and (after some butcheries therein) marches to
Vienna in Austria, where he left fourscore thousand of his Turks, and then
with shame and anger returned. In the year 1532 he returns with an Army of
five hundred thousand men; to whom Charles the fifth opposed himself and the
Christian forces, in greater numbers then has in many ages been seen,
mustering in his Army at Vienna two hundred and threescore thousand men,
whereof fourscore and ten thousand footmen, and thirty thousand horsemen
were old soldiers, to whom Solomon did not, or durst not, bid battle. Poor
Hungary rues it mean while, whether he gets or loses in Austria, being made
his through-fare as he went and came.

After this he tries his success against the Persian, where he takes Tauris
and Babylon, with the Countries of Assyria and Media, Anno 1534. each of which
had sometimes been Lady of the World. At incredible costs he prepared a Fleet
in the Red Sea, 1537, and taking Aden and Zibyth, two petty Kingdoms in
Arabia, by his forces Dam.a Goes Diensis oppugnatio.
besieged Dium, a Castle of the Portugals in the East Indies, but without his
wished success. For the Portugals still retain their Indian Seas and
Trassique, and not only freed that their Castle from Turkish bondage, but had
means to fortify it better, by the Ordinance which the Turks, in their
hasty flight, had left behind. A more dangerous plot did Solomon, meane-while,
contriue against Christendom Turkish History, Kn.
, preparing his forces to invade Italy, and to that end was come to Aulona, an
Haven in Macedonia, with two hundred thousand soldiers, where Barbarussa and
Lutzis Bassa, his great Admiral, met him with his Fleet, to transport his
Army. But Solomon first employed these Sea-Forces on the coast of Italy, and
took Castrum: his horsemen (which he had sent over in great Palendars) carried
away the People, Cattle, and Substance, betwixt Brundusium and Tarentum,
forty miles space; all the Country of Otranto terrified with fear of a
greater tempest. But the Venetians turned it from the rest of Italy upon
themselves (notwithstanding their league) by unseasonable exacting of that
Seacourtesie, the vailing of the bonnets or top-sayles of some Turkish Galleys
unto them, as Lords of that Sea: for which neglect, some of them were sunk.

also, the Emperors Admiral, had surprised some of the Turks straggling
Fleet, and after held cruel fight with twelve great Galleys full of Ianizaries
and choisemen, whom he overthrew and took. But the Ianizaries that were left,
cast their scimitars ouer-boord, least such choice weapons should come to the
Christians hands. Solomon converting his forces against the Venetians, for the
indignities mentioned, had almost failen into the hands of the
Mountaine-Theeues, which lived in the Acroceraunian Hills: who in a strange
resolution had conspired to kill him in his Tent, and had almost (to the wonder
of the world) in a night, by unknown ways, suddenly effected it, had not the
cracking of a bough discovered their Captain, who in a Tree was taking view of
the Camp, how to bring to pass his desperate designs. This their Captain,
(by name Damianus) was, after confession hereof, torn in pieces, and those
wild Mountainers (living on Robberte, without Law or Religion) were, like
wild beasts, hunted to destruction.

The Turks invaded Corsu, whence they carried sixteen thousand of the
Islanders captives. They likewise, in their return, committed great spoil in
Zante and Cythera, sacked Aegina, Paros, and other Islands in the Archipelago;
bringing Naxos under Tribute. Barbarussa sacked Botrotus, a Venetian City: The
like did Vstrif to Obroatium, and the Castle of Nadin. Nauplium also, and
Epidaurus were besieged. But Ferdinand (who had entitled himself King of
Hungatie, after Lewis his death) received a greater disgrace in Hungary by the
Turkish forces, then befell the Venetians in all their losses; Cazzianer (the
General of the Christians) shamefully fleeing, and betraying his associates to
the Turkish cruelty. The next year, 1538, Barbarussa chaseth the Christian
Fleet, in which the Emperors, Venetians, and the Popes forces were joined.

In the year 1541 Solomon again inuadeth Hungary, professing himself
protector of the young King, which John late King of Hungary (who had held
long wars with Ferdinand about that Title) had left behind him his heir and
successor. But under color of protection, he makes himself Lord of Buda, the
chief City, turning the Cathedral Church into a Meschit; and makes Hungary
a Turkish Province, bestowing Transyluania, and what he pleased, on the Orphan.
Two years after he re-entreth Hungary, and takes Strigoninm: turning the
Christian Temples into Mahumetane; sacrificing there for his victory, as he
had done at Buda. He entered also into loan. Martini Stelle^p. ad frat.
Alba Regalis, (where the Hungarian Kings lie entombed) another chief City of
that Kingdom, and slew the Magistrates. I speak not all this while of the
spacious Countries in Africa, which, from the River Mulvia, he added to his
Dominions: the Kingdoms of Algier, Tremisen, Tunes, Tripoli, etc. being
annexed to his Turkish Soueraignetie. Howbeit, Tunes, by aid of Charles the
Emperor, somewhat recovered her self, but breathed out again her last gasp
of liberty, in the days of Selym his son. And thus was Solomon as
unnatural to, his children, as Selim was to his father Bajazet.
Solomon victorious and happy, otherwhere victorious and unhappy, when he was
forced to darreine battle against his own bowels, and having murdered
Mustapha his eldest son (the hopefullest branch in Turkish estimation that
ever grew out of the Ottoman stock) he warred against Bajazet, another of his
sons; whom, with four of his children, he procured to be done to death in
Persia. And after much domestical trouble, in his seventh Expedition into
Hungary (his fleet in the siege of Malta being before, with great disgrace,
repulsed) he died at the siege of Zigeth the fourth of September, 1566.

Selym, the only son which the bloody father had left alive, succeeded in
the Throne, not in the prowess and valor of his father. Neither has any
Turkish Sultan, since his days, led their forces in person, but committed it
to their Deputies and Generals; except once, when Mahomet the third had almost
lost his Army and himself. Yet did this Selym, by his Bassaes, make himself
Lord of Of the wars of Cyprus, see the realtions of Nestor Martiningo in

battle.
, and Don John of Austria, General of the Fleet, set forth by the Pope,
Spaniard, and Venetian, 1571: wherein an hundred threescore and one Galleys
were taken, forty sunk or burnt, and of Galliots, and other small Vessels,
were taken about threescore. The Turkish Admiral was then slain. Wittily did
a Turk descant upon this loss of the Turks, and their gain of Cyprus,
comparing this to the shauing of a man's beard, which would grow again: that,
to the loss of an arm, which, once cut off, cannot be renewed. Lastly, Tunes
came in, and Selym went out of this Turkish Sovereignty both in manner
together, 1574.

Amurath, his heir, began his Empire with the slaughter of his five brethren.
Michael ab isselt, Com. Anno 1575.
The mother of Solomon (one of that number) slew her self with a dagger, for
anguish of that loss. He, in viewing a new Gallie by the breach of a Piece,
hardly escaped death, thirty of his company being slain. And because the
Plague was exceeding hot, he by devotion sought to appease divine anger: and
therefore prohibited all use of Sodomie, Blasphemy, and Polygamie, and
himself put out five hundred women out of his Seraile. In a private habit he
visited the Markets, and hanged up the hoorders of Corn. He by the Tartars
invaded Polonia: And, Henry of France secretly leaving that Kingdom of
Polonia, he wrote unto them to choose Stephen Battor for their king; in which
letters he called himself, GOD of the Earth, Governor of the whole World.
Messenger of GOD, and faithful servant of the great Prophet: which wrought so
much with the Nobility, that either they would not or durst not do otherwise,
howsoever Maximilian had been before by many of them chosen.

Tamas Minad^i's History of the wars betwixt the Turks and Persians,
translated by Abraham Martwell in nine books, relaleth these things at large.
the Persian (at the same time dying) bequeathed his Crown to Ismael his
son, whom Aidere, his brother, seeks to deprive, but is therefore himself
deprived of that ambitious head which he sought to adorn with the Crown; and
Ismael adding the slaughter of 8. his younger brethren, ascends the throne,
which, together with his life, he lost, by like unnatural treachery of
Periaconcona his sister, the 24 of Noue^b. 1577. Mahomet his brother succeeded
in this troublesome State, which Amurath the Turk (in these troubled waters)
thought fit time for himself to fish for. Hereunto also helped the hatred and
civil broils in Persia, for the head of Peria^oncona, presented to Mahomet,
with the hair disheuelled on a lance, and for other uncouth and bloody
spectacles; Sahamal and Levent Ogli (two Georgian Lords) seeking also
innouations. Amurath therefore, in the year 1578, sent Mustapha Bassa, which
had lately conquered Cyprus, with an Army of 110000, into Persia: who, in the
first battle he had with them, slew five thousand, and took three thousand
Persians: and to strike that Nation with terror, commanded a bulwark to be
framed of those heads: but by an exceeding tempest, which lasted four days
together (whereby the Heavens seemed to melt themselves in tears for the
Persians loss, and with Lightenings to show that indignation against the
Turks, which in their thundering Dialect they aloud uttered) there grew such
horror to their minds from above, and such sickness to their bodies, from
those putrified carcasses beneath, that Mustapha was forced to remove, missing
forty thousand of his first musters. After he had fortified the Armenian
castle of Teflis, his Army being driven to shifts for lack of victuals, ten
thousand of his foragers were slain by the Persians, who were recompensed with
like slaughter by Mustapha, that came upon them whiles they were busy about
the spoil, and spoiled the spoylers. In passing over the River Canac, he lost
fourscore thousand Turks, which the River seemed to take for Custom (as it
had many of the Persians in the late conflict) whereof his violent current was
a greedy and cruel exactor. Mustapha erected a Fortress in Eres, and took
Sumachia, chief City of Siruan (Derbent offering her self to the Turk) and
then returned into Natolia. But Emir Hamse Mirise, the Persian Prince,
recovered, after his departure, both Eres and Sumachia, slew and captiued the
Tartars, thirty thousand of whom were newly come to the Turks aid. He rased
Sumachia even with the ground. The next year Mustapha fortified Chars in three
and twenty days, wherein they were hindered with Snowes on the five and
twentieth of August, although it stands in forty four Degrees. Anno 1580,
Sinan Bassa was chosen General for the Persian War; who, as he departed from
Teflis, lost seven thousand of his people, besides such as the Georgians and
Persians, together with the spoil, carried away. This was earnest, the rest
was but sportfull shows of War, in trayning his soldiers; after which he
returned. In 1583, Ferat Bassa was sent General: but little was done, till
Osman Bassa, a new General, 1585, took Tauris, the ancient Ecbatana (as
Minadoi is of opinion.) But the Persian Prince, carried with indignation,
revenged this loss on the Turks with his own hands, slaying Carae^^t Bassa,
General in the place of Osman, then sick, and gave his head (as opima spolia)
to one of his followers; and afterward at Sancazan slew twenty thousand
Turks. Osman died of sickness; and the Persian Prince (the morning-starre of
that Eastern State) was soon after murdered. In that dismal year 1588,
Ferat took Genge: fifteen thousand houses, seven Temples, and five and
twenty great Innes were burned in Constantinople, the tumultuous Ianizaries
not suffering the fire to be quenched. An Impost was levied of the subjects, to
satisfy the pay due to the soldiers for the Persian War, which raised these
stirs. Yea, the Priests dissuaded the people from those new payments, and
persuaded them to maintain their ancient Liberties, shut up their Meschits,
intermitted their Orisons: and the Great Tvrke was forced to call in his
Mandats, and deliver the authors of that counsel (whereof the Beglerbeg of
Grecia was one) to the Ianizaries fury, who made Tennis-balls of their heads.
In 1592, Wihitz, chief City of Croatia, was yielded to the Turk. The next
year Siseg was besieged, but relieved by the Christians, who slew eighteen
thousand Turks, and took their Tents; yet was it soon after taken by the
renewed forces of the Turks. Sinan took Vesprinium in Hungary and Palotta,
but their loss was far greater then their gains; which continuing, and a
broile of the Ianizaries added thereto, brought To this Amurath was M. Harebora

Sigismund, who was entitled their Prince.

Mahomet his son succeeded; who inuiting his nineteen brethren to a Feast,
sent them to learn his fathers death in the other world, accompanied thither
with ten of Amuraths women, from whom issue was feared, which with drowning
them he prevented. Much ado he had with his Ianizaries at home, much loss in
his dominions abroad, for which cause he sent for Ferat Bassa out of Hungary,
and strangled him, and sent Sinan his emulous corriuall, in his room, whom
the Transyluanian Prince overthrew in battle, and after chased him over a
Bridge, which he made a mile in length for his Army to pass over Danubius,
with great loss of his people. His Bridge the fire and water divided betwixt
them; and the conceit of this ill success (as was thought) procured his death
soon after. In the year 1597, Mahomet in his own person enterprised these
wars, and not far from Agria, on the six and twentieth of October, fought
a cruel battle with the Christians, wherein (had not Covetousness, rightly
called the root of all evil, hindered) had been achieved the most glorious
victory against those Barbarians, that ever Christendom was blessed with.
Mahomet Mahomets Army was reported to be 600000 says M. Wrag. apud Hakl. to.2.
himself for fear, seeing his Ordinance (an hundred fourscore and ten
great Pieces) taken, and his men slain in multitudes, fled with Ibrahim Bassa
toward Agria, shedding tears by the way, which he wiped off his blubbered
face with a piece of green Silk, supposed to be a piece of Mahomets garment,
carried with him as a holy Relic. But whiles the Christians were now half
Conquerors, by greedy turning to the spoil, their victory was wholly lost,
and twenty thousand of them slain, who had slain threescore thousand Turks.
Not long after, the Bassa of Buda was taken, and the Bassa of Bosna, with some
thousands of Turks slain, An. 1599. Yet did not all his losses in the West by
the Christians vex the Great Sultan so much, as a rebellion The long and
dangerous rebellion in Turkey by Cusahin, the Scrivano, etc. See Knol. Turkish
History.
raised in the East, which many years continued. Cusahin Bassa of Caramania
rose in arms against his Master, and having now done great matters, his
soldiers, before false to their Prince, became now also false to him: he
fleeing, was after taken and tortured to death. His rebellion out-liued him,
and was maintained by one, called the Scriuano*, who overthrew Mehemet Bassa in
the field, and the second time, in the year 1601, overthrew him with his army
of fifty thousand, and foraged all the Country almost as far as Aleppo,
proclaiming himself the defendor of the Mahumetane faith, and soon after gave
the Bassa a third overthrow. The Turks Ambassador, sent into Persia to
demand the Sophi's son in hostage, for assurance of the peace between those
two Monarchs, was for his proud message put to the Bastinado, and grievously
threatened, sent back to the Grand Signior. The Scrivano's proceedings were
much furthered by the dissentions between the Ianizaries of Aleppo and
Damasco: but death stayed him, not his rebellion, which a younger brother of
his prosecuted, against whom Hassan Bassa was sent, but lost himself and his
Army. The Rebels besieged Angole, and forced them to give two hundred thousand
ducats to buy their peace. Mean while the Ianizaries, after their insolent
manner, in a mutiny forced Mahomet to commit the Capi-Aga, one of his greatest
officers, and some others, to whom the success of these Rebels was imputed,
to their cruel execution. The Rebels sacked Burze, one of the chief Cities,
the Turks Storehouse for his wars, and Treasury for his revenues; and the
great Sbangh of Persia had taken Corberie also from the Turks. The Governor of
Babylon inclined now also to the rebels. Mahomet, not able with force to
prevail, by fair means sought to win them, and gave them their demands,
making Zelalic, one of their Chiefetaines, Bassa of Bosna. Whereupon his men of
war entered into a resolution, to deprive him of the State, and to inuest
therewith Mahomet his eldest son: about which an Astrologian being consulted,
promised all happy success: (unhappy fool, that knew not his own
approaching ruin, which Mahomet executed on him, together with young Mahomet
the Prince, and fifty other conspirators.)

He set forth a fleet of Galleys against the King of Fesse; which, having
encountered with a tempest, was forced with great loss to retire to their
former Port. The chief Rebel making show he would come into Europe, as
Zellalie had done, Mahomet sent certain Galleys to receive him, but he
received them, and possessing himself of the Galleys, slew the men, and mocked
the Sultan. Hassan, a great Bassa, joined himself also unto them, about such
time as Tauris Tauris recovered by the Persians.
was again recovered by the Persian. All these disasters drove Mahomet to his
devotions for refuge, accounting these crosses to be inflicted for his sins,
and therefore appointed public Prayers in all the Mosques of his dominion, and
sent two Priests bare-headed and barefooted to Mecca, on pilgrimage, to pray
for him. But that Mahomet either had no ears to hear this, or else was so
far entreated, as to be better acquainted with this great Sultan in the place
of his eternal residence, whither (about the year 1593) Mahomet the Turk Of

was by death soon after sent. His son Achmat succeeded; for his eldest was
strangled in his sight. He was buried in a fair Chapel by himself, for that
purpose built about fifty foot square, with four Turrets or Steeples: in the
midst is his Sepulcher, in a great Coffin of white Marble: his Turbant at his
head, two exceeding great candles of White Wax, standing (but never burning)
the one at his head, the other at his feet. The Floor is covered with Mats,
and fair Carpets on them. Round about are like Tombs for his wives and
children, but not so great and fair. Diverse such Chapels there are near to
the Temple of Sophia as of his father Amurath, with his 45. children, entombed
about him, and of the other great Sultans, two Selims, Solomon, Bajazet,
Mahomet, each having a fair Hospital for the relief of the poor adjoining.
Some of the great Bassaes imitate the same. No other Turks are buried in the
Cities, but in the fields, with stones laid over, or set upright, fashioned
with some resemblance of the head, which bears ensign of his dignity, and

same.

set a sure guard about his brother, and to prevent the insolency of the
Ianizaries and soldiers, distributed amongst them two millions and a half,
and being 15. years old, was crowned Emperor. He is said in behauior and
resemblance much to resemble Mahomet the Great, first Conqueror of
Constantinople. At the same time the wars in Transyluania had procured such
famine, that roots, herbs, leaves of trees were their food: yea, a mother is
said to have brought back into her womb (by unnatural means satisfying
Nature) her six children: two men to eat their mother: others to cut down
malefactors from the gallows, and eat them. Horses, Dogs, Cats, and such
like were rarities to the poor, and dainties beyond their reach. And if this
State can be made worse, thieves by robberies, and soldiers by continual
spoils, in taking away their goods, add to their miseries. Cicala Bassa is
sent against the Asian Rebels, and receives an overthrow: the second time he
renews his forces, with renewing his fortunes, namely, the loss of 30000 of
his men. The Persian recovered the country of Sirvan, and the City of Arusta,
with the country thereabouts, and all that from the days of Solomon had been
taken from them, except two or three places. Hassan Bassa is sent against the
Christians in Hungary, assisted with the Tartars, always ready to help the
Turks, both because they are linked in marriages, like in conditions, and that
huge Empire, for want of heir males of the Ottomans, is entailed to the Tartar
Cham: pay and spoil are no small motives also to fetch them into these
Expeditions. Cicala Bassa is sent against the Persians, but defeated with all
his power by the Persian, who also took Bagdat from the Turk. In Hungary
they do more with their money, to maintain rebellions, then with open force.
In the year 1605 a tumult arose among the Ianizaries in Constantinople, and 500
shops and warehouses, with 200 Jews, and other persons to whom they belonged,
were burnt: the Ianizaries enriched themselves with the spoil. Hungary is at
once vexed with foraine and civil wars: the mutinous Christians doing more
harm the^ the Turks, and the people flee into Polonia, or the Mountains, for
refuge. The rebels take great Towns, yea they spoil Stiria and Austria. The
German name grows odious to the Hungarian. Botscay, chief of the rebels, is
assisted by the Turks, and called Prince of Transyluania, all Hungary in manner
following his ensigns. But the rebels in Asia and the Persian exploits
detained the Turks from making use of these occasions, else likely to have
swallowed Hungary and Austria both: yet Pesth was before taken by them, and
now Strigonium. Cicala Bassa is again overthrown by the Persian, and with 300
flies to Adena. The Bassa of Trebezond is sent to succor him, but is
discomfited, and almost all his army slain. Achmat enraged, causes Cicala
Bassa's house at Constantinople, full of wealth and treasure, to be rifled.
Adena is yielded to the Persian. The Bassa's of Damasco and Aleppo had before
fallen out, and taken arms, Damasco had overthrown Aleppo in the field,
besieged him, and forced him to composition. Civil wars between the Bassa's
of Aleppo and Damasco.
Now again, Aleppo overthrows him, and the Bassas of Tripolis and Gazara his
companions, with their army of threescore thousand men; took Tripolis, the
Basla whereof he again overthrew, and added to his garlands Damasco the
treasury of the Turks revenue, and chief City of Syria. The Beglerbeg of
Natolia sent his Liefe-tenant with a great army against him, but to their own
ruin. He intercepted a ship laden with the tributes of Egypt. The Persian sent
him, in token of love, a present worth fifty thousand crowns. Achmat is hereby
forced to peace with the Christians, and to recall his forces out of Hungary for
this employment. An. 1606. The Emperor yields satisfaction to the
discontents in Hungary, with free use of Religion to all, and Transyluania to
remain to Botscay and his heirs male for ever. A fire at Constantinople
kindled in a Jews house by the Tartars, burnt many houses and Jews, and four
millions of goods. Achmat in great magnificence went to his Moschee, to render
thanks to Mahomet for a peace concluded with the Emperor. He now looks
Eastward with his power, and An. 1607. sent the Vizier Bassa with an hundred
and thirty thousand against the rebels, who prevails more by discreet
appeasing of them, then by force. The Basla of Aleppo three times withstood his
whole forces; the fourth time flees toward Persia with his treasure. Aleppo
is left to be taken, and the Garrison put to the sword: But the Bassa himself
obtained pardon, with restitution of his goods taken from him in Syria. Another
fire arose at Constantinople, and consumed two millions of goods. The Duke of
Florence does much harm to the Turks by the sea, 1608. The rebels make new
commotions in Asia. Matthias the Archduke stands out with his forces against
the Emperor, and comes with his army toward Prage, obtains the crown and
royalties of Hungary by composition, comes King to Vienna; but the Protestants
refuse to swear allegiance, till free use of Religion in Austria by King
Matthias was granted. He was crowned at Presburg.

Sultan Achmet is now An. 1612. four and twenty years old: of good stature,
strong and active more then any of his Court. He has three thousand concubines
and virgins for his lust: his eldest son is about seven years old: he is much
delighted with pleasures of the field, for which in Graecia and Natolia he has
forty thousand Falconers, his Hnnts-men are not much fewer. And whereas their
religion binds them once every day to practice some manual trade, as his
father did making of arrows: this Sultan every morning after his devotions,
makes horne-rings, which they wear on their thumbes for the better drawing of
their bows. Eight thousand persons are always resident in his Palace. His
officers The chief officers of the Turks and his other instruments of private
and public service.
are the Capi, Aga, by whom he speaks to such as have suites to him; Treasurer
of the household, Cup Bearer, Steward, Ouerseer of his women, and principal
Gardner. These six are in great place: he has Mutes (persons borne deaf and
dumb) which attend him; he has fifteen hundred gelded men, from whom their
priuities are wholly cut, and they make water through short quills of silver,
which to that end they wear on their Turbants. His Vizier Bassas, or
Priuy-counsellors, whereof there are nine at Constantinople, and were wont to
be much fewer, are now thirty. The rest of the^ are in their charges or
Beglerbegs places abroad. They sit every Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday,
in the Diuano or Counsel-hall. The Aga is Captain of the Ianizaries. The
Chiauses are his Pursiuants. The Spahi his guard of horsemen. The Ianizaries
are his best footmen, who in their childhood are taken from their parents,
and brought up in all hardness, and in the rules of their religion. Then are
they put to schools, where under most severe masters they are taught the use
of diverse weapons, and such as prove fit are enrolled for Ianizaries. Of whom
in all are forty thousand, and about sixteen thousand with their Aga, attend
the Grand Seignior his person at Constantinople, where they are employed as
Constables, Clerks of the Market, warders of the gates, Sergeants for arrests,
to guard Ambassadors, and other offices. He has also in pay others called
Topegi, six thousand, which are gunners; and twelve thousand Gebegi, which have
charge of the powder and shot in the armies. He has Seminaries for the
training up of those yonglings, the one sort of which are called Ieheoglani,
whereof are five thousand, which never go out of the Seraglio in sixteen or
twenty years, never see any but their officers, where they are trained up to
future service. The Gemoglani (who are also tithed children of the Christians)
are brought up with some more liberty, and to base offices of husbandry and
such like, and may also prove Ianizaries. Of these are twenty thousand. The
Ianizaries and tithed children, with his Timariots, are the maine pillars of
his Empire. His Timariots, which hold land in Fee to maintain so many
horsemen in his service, are in Europe two hundred fifty seven thousand; in
Asia and Africa, four hundred sixty two thousand. Beglerbeg signifies LORD
of LORDS; of which were wont to be two; one in Europe; another in Asia: but by
Soliman increased, that though Romania and Natolia have still the chief
titles, yet in Europe are four others; in Asia before these Persian wars,
nine and twenty, in Africa four, in all nine and thirty, which are as
Vice-royes and have their Begs or Sanzackes under them. His Admirals place is
as great by sea. And thus much of Turkish affairs, the sum of the large
work of M. Knolles, whom I principally follow.

CHAP. X.
Of the Opinions holden by the Turks in their Religion.

HOw the Turks from so small beginnings have aspired to this their present
greatness you have seen; bought indeed at a dear price, with their temporal
dominions accepting of a spiritual bondage, becoming the Lords of many
countries, and withal made subject to those many Mahumetan superstitions. The
occasion and chief cause of sects in the Saracenicall devotions ye have heard
in the fourth and seventh Chapters: to which we may add here out of
Obser.l.3.c.4.
Bellonius. He says, that besides the Alcoran they have another book called
Zuna, that is, the Way, or Law, or Council of Mahomet, written after his death
by his disciples. But the readings thereof being diverse and corrupt, the Caliph
assembled a general Council of their Alphachi, or learned men at Damasco,
wherein six Commissioners were appointed, namely, Muszlin, Bochari, Buborayra,
Annecey, Atermindi, and Dent, to view and examine these books, each of which
composed a book, and those six books were called Zuna; the other copies being
two hundred Camels-lading, were drowned in the river; those six only made
authentical, esteemed of equal authority among the Turks, with the Alcoran,
and after by one of their Divines contracted into an Epitome; which book was
called the book of flowers. But this Zuna being not Vna (one as the Truth is)
but full of contrariety, hence have arisen sects amongst them; the Turks
differing from other Mahumetan nations, and divided also amongst themselves.

Anthony Menau.lib.1.Andr.Arvi.G.Biddulph.
Menauinus (who lived a long time in the Turkish Court) says that the book of
their Law is called Musaph or Curaam, which Georgionitz reckons anothe book;
not the Alcoran, but perhaps some Gloss, orsome Extract thereof in Arabian,
which they hold unlawful to translate into the vulgar. They have it in such
reverence, that they will not touch it, except they be washed from top to toe:
and it is read in their Churches by one with a loud voice; the people giving
devout attenda^ce without any noise: nor may the Reader hold it beneath his
girdle-stedde; and after he has read it, he kisseth it, and touches his eyes
with it, and with great solemnity it is carried into the due place. Out of
this book are derived eight principal commandments of their Law. The first
is, GOD is a great GOD, and one only GOD, and Mahomet is the Prophet of GOD:
this article of the Unity (they think) makes against us, who believe a
Trinity of Persons: in detestation whereof, they often reiterate these words,
hu, hu, hu, that is, he, he, he, is only GOD, who is worthy to be praised for
their limbs, health, etc. and for that he has provided sustenance for every
one forty years before his birth.

The second Commandment is, Obey thy parents, and do nothing to displease
them in word or deed: they much fear the curses of their parents. 3. Do unto
others, as thou would be done unto. 4. That they repair to the Meschit or
Church at the times appointed: of which after. 5. To fast one month of the
year, called Remezan or Ramadan. 6. that they give alms to the poor
liberally and freely. 7. To marry at convenient age, that they may multiply the
sect of Mahomet. 8. Not to kill. Of these commandments is handled at large in
Menauine, and in the book Policy of the Turkish Empire. Biddulph.
of the Policy of the Turkish Empire, and in others.

Their times of prayer, according to the fourth Precept, are beme say that the
^^rks n^^^ we to resort to their or^ but three ^^^^^ ^^ day, and P^ i^ ^a^^y
sour, omitting that in the night. B^^beq. ^^^^. they measure the time of
prayer by houre-glasses of water.
in the morning, called Salanamazzi, before Sun rising: the second at noone,
called Vlenamazzi. (On the Friday they pray six times, resorting to their
Church two hours before noone) the third, about three hours before Sun set,
called Inchindinamazzi. The fourth at Sun set, Ascannamazzi. The fifth, two
hours within night, before they go to sleep. They which mean to go to
prayer, go first to the house of office, and there purge their body: they
wash their privy parts; and then going thence, wash their hands, their mouth,
their nose, their countenance, and their wrists, each of them three times, and
after their ears and necks, saying a certain Psalm, and then wash their
feet to the mid-legge, saying another Psalm: and after all this, with a grave
pace, walk to Church; without these washings they hold their prayers
unprofitable. Septemcastrensis says, that for this cause of washing, they cut
their nails, and all their hair; except on their heads and beards (which yet
they comb, and bestow curious pains about, that the water may have free
passage to all parts) yea for this cause he thinks they observe
Circumcision, that nothing be left covered and unwashed. They have three kinds
of washings: the first of all the body, no part being left free, called
Zeoag^^gmeg, which is necessary after any pollution. The second is called
Tachriat, of the priuities and hinder parts after stool, urine, or breaking of
wind. The third, Aptan, or Abdas, in the instruments of the five senses,
beginning at the hands, from thence the wrists to the elbow; then the mouth and
nosthrills; then all the face with the eyes; then the ears, and from thence to
the feet, which he washes as high as the ankles. This is not necessary
before every prayer, except some uncleanness happen, but may serve for all day.

Their Alms, enjoined in the sixth Commandment, are public or private. Their
public alms is a sacrifice or offering of some beast once every year. For
whereas of old they should have given a certain pension of money to the poor,
namely, two in the hundredth: Mahomet upon their complaint eased this heavy
burden, and converted it into this sacrifice. This beast must be cut in
pieces, and given to the poor: neither must they themselves eat of it, yet
may each man eat of his neighbors offering, and this sacrifice ought to be of
the fairest and best, Horse, Veale, or Mutton. The place for this sacrifice is
called Canaara: where are many Butchers, which, cutting the throat thereof,
say; In the name of him which has made heaven and earth, and all things else;
this sacrifice be to his honor and worship, and let his infinite bounty
accept the same. They use the like upon occasion of vows, if any of their
house be sick. As for their private alms, they hold it necessary: having a
vain conceit, that it freeth them from all imminent misery, which (they say)
together with the alms, turns from them to the poor man; whence it comes
that the poor are so full of diseases. But for all this charitable Precept,
many poor people die amongst them for want of relief: and Biddulph.
if the poor pay not their head money to the King yearly, they are beaten, and
their women and children sold to pay it.

Marriage ought to be sought (they say) for procreation, not for lust. Menavino.
They which live unmarried (after fit time, which is about five and twenty
years of age) are not just, nor please GOD. Their Law enioyneth them to
perform their marriage-ceremonies, with prayers, and praises, and modest
shamefastness; and they ought to learn each other to read, if either party
be ignorant. But their marriage is now far degenerate from that ancient
simplicity: The Turks can marry and vnmarry themselves at their pleasure.
For if a man like a young woman, he buyeth her of her father, and then
enrolleth her in the Cadies book; the marriage following with all Bacchanall
solemnities. The father gives only some pieces of household with her, carried
openly by particulars through the streets. When he disliketh any of his wives,
he sells them, or gives them to his men-slaues. They sit not at table with
their husbands, but wait and serve them; and then they dine by themselves,
admitting no man or mankind with them above twelve years old. And they never
go abroad without leave, except to the Bath, and on Thursday to weep at the
graves of the dead: Septemcas^. ^^^bequ. Epist.
They rise to their husbands, and stand while they are in presence; and besides
them, come in no company of men, nor do they speak with a man, or in any part
of their body are seen of any man; because they think sight, especially
where beauty or comeliness is, cannot be without sin. Only the brother may
be permitted to see the sister, but not the husbands brother. For this cause
that sex is not suffered to buy and sell, but is closely mewed, save that
their law allows them to frequent the public Bathes. The wife and concubine
differ in the right to a dowry, which the later wants: but the wife must
cause the other to be her husbands fellow, when he commands, without
gainsaying, except on their Sabbath, or Friday night, which is the wives
peculiar. Yet are the Turks given in both sexes to unnatural lust (in these
times) even the women in public Bathes, sometimes are so enflamed in that
filthiness, as is intolerable. Busbequius tells of one woman, which falling
in love with a young maid, and no way else prevailing, clothed her self in man's
apparel, and hiring a house near, procured the fathers good will to have that
his daughter in marriage; which being solemnised between them, and the truth
discovered (which the black mantle of night could not cover from Hymenaeus)
complaint was made, and the Governor quenched the hot flames of this new
bridegroom, causing her to be drowned for that offense. If the man abuse the
wife to unnatural lust, she may have her remedy by divorce, if she accuse her
husband; which modesty forbids to be done in words, and therefore she puts
off her shoe, and by inuerting the same, accuses her husbands perverseness.

Murder (prohibited in their eight Commandment) they hold unpardonable, if it
be done wilfully. Often will the Turks brawle, but never in private quarrels
strike one another, for fear of this law, and the severity of the Magistrate.
And if one be found dead in a street or house, the master of the house, or the
parish, must find out the murderer; otherwise he hmselfe shall be accused of
it, and the whole Contado shall be fined, and likewise in case of robbery.

Menauinus reckons also seven mortal sins; Pride, Avarice, Lechery,
Wrath, Envy, Sloth, and Gluttony. The first, they say, cast Lucifer out of
heaven. The second is the root of many other sins. The third is most rise
amongst them, and that in the most filthy and unnatural kind of Sodomie;
their law to the contrary notwithstanding. The fourth makes a man a beast.
The fifth shuts men out of Paradise, and so forth of the rest. Wine Drinking
of Greek Wine is too sweet a sin for the Turks to forbear.
is also forbidden them; but yet they will be drunk with it, if they can get
their fill of it. And Mahomet the third ( Anno 1601) imputing diverse
insolences of the Ianizaries to their excessive drinking of wine (by the
Mufti's persuasion) commanded on pain of death, all such in Constantinople and
Pera, as had wine, to bring it out and staue it (except Ambassadors only) so
that the streets ran therewith. One drinking A. Gis. Busb. epist.1.
wine with Busbequius, made great clamors; being asked the cause, he said he
did it to warn his soul to flee into some corner of the body, or else be
quite gone, lest it should be polluted with that sin. Yet in their Fast or
Lent, they abstain very religiously. Villamont.
If it be proved against a Priest, that he has drunk wine but once, he shall
never be believed as a witness after it. Swines flesh is prohibited too; in
abstaining from which they are more obedient; it being utterly abhorred.

The Turks The Turks are no fashionmongers.
generally hate (says Septemcastrensis) that lightnesle in apparel, speech,
gesture, etc. used of the Christians, whom for this cause they call Apes and
Goats. Likewise they are not sumptuous in their private buildings. They go to
the war, as it were to a wedding, esteeming them blessed which are therein
slain. The wives and women-seruants agree in one house, without jealousy and
grudging, they are in their habit and behavior modest: and, where he himself
dwelt, the father in law had not seen the face of his daughter in law, living
in the same house with him, in twenty years space; so religiously do they
veil themselves.

On Friday they pray more devoutly, but (as the Alcoran also permits) they
abstain not from all labor. He saw the grand Signor himself go to their
Church, and likewise to the Bath, attended only with two youths; none using
any acclamation to him. And in the Church he prayed on the pauement covered
with a carpet, like to the rest, without any throne or ensign of royalty. And
he observed the like modesty in his other behavior.

The Turks are so zealous in their superstition, that they will rather lose
their life then religion: as among other examples in Scanderbegs time at Dibra,
many Turks chose rather to die Turks, then to live Christians; yea some, as
it is reported, rather to kill themselves, then to leave their superstition:
and in the year 1568. the Persian Ambassador was shot at, and one of his
followers hurt by a Turk, who being apprehended, confessed that he did it
because he was an Heretic, and sent from an Heretic: for which fact he was
drawn at an horse-tayle through the City, and then had his right hand cut off,
and after his head. They hate the Persians, as Rustan Bassa told Busbequius,
more then they do the Christians: like as the Traditionary Jew does the
Textuarie, and the Papist the Protestant. Busbeq.epist.3.


Images they have in such detestation, that (besides the scratching out the
eyes of those in the Musaique work of Saint Sophies Temple) when Solomon
overthrew King Lewis of Hungary, he carried away three Images of cunning work
in brass, representing Heroules with his Club, Apollo with his Harp, Diana
with her Bow and Quiver, and placed them in the tilt-yard at Constantinople:
but by the persuasion of the Mufti, they were molten into great ordnance. They
have no Scutchions or blazing of annes: nay, they use no seals in their
letters or other writings, which seem to them to savor of superstition, or
superfluity.

When they conquer any City, they turn the Temples into Mosques, and
sacrifice there. Thus did Solomon Knolli.
at Buda, and Amurath sacrificed six hundred captives to his fathers ghost.

They are moderate in their private buildings, and detest Septemcast.
the Christians for their excess and superfluous expenses that way: What (say
they) do those Pagans think they shall live ever? they often lodge (says
Voyag. du villamont. l.3.c.6.
Villamont) at the sign of the Moon; and the like moderation they use in diet
and apparel. They have a brasse-pot, and their other mean household implements
with them in the wars, which they use in peace. Ready money is their surest
riches, because the Grand Signior is their surest heir.

They have the rising of the Sun in great reverence; and especially the
appearing of the new Moon: as Knol. pa.421:
when Mahomet the great besieged Scodra, the new Moon beginning to show
herself, the Mahumetan Priests, going about the army, gave the soldiers
warning thereof, as their manner is, by singing of a song in manner of a
Procession; whereunto the whole army answered with a short respond, and at the
same time bowing themselves to the ground, saluted the Moon with great
superstition.

They may Sep^^^^^st.
have twelve lawful wives, and as many concubines as they will (some say, but
four wives.) The children of the one are equally legitimate as well as the
other, and inherit alike: yet few of them keep two wives together in one
house: but in several places where they have dealings, they have several
wives, which they divorce at pleasure.

They refer all things, that fall out well, unto GOD, be they never so
vngratiously begun; measuring things by the success. They tell many things
of Antichrist (whom they call Leunclau. says Degnal.
Tethschel) and of the resurrection, and of the last Judgment, of hell, and
Purgatory: And that Mahomet after Judgment shall deliver all of all religions
from thence.

They have no knowledge of liberal Arts, of cases of conscience, of Original
sin, or of actual, further then the outward act.

Their respects to relics appears by Mahomet Knol.
the third, 1597. who in the discomfiture of his army fled toward Agria,
shedding some tears as he went, and wiping his eyes with a piece of Mahomets
garment, which he carried about him as a relic.

The Turks may neither eat, drink, nor make water, standing.

In their adversity they seek with earnest prayers to their Prophets; and
public supplications are sometimes decreed. At Knol. pa.1136.
the taking of Alba Regalis, 1601. the Bassa of Buda (then prisoner at Vienna)
hearing of it, abstained from meet with his two servants a whole day, prostrate
upon his face, praying unto his Prophet Mahomet, who he said had been angrle
all that year with the Turks. They Busbeq.
endure punishments inflicted by the Magistrate with great patience, thinking
they shall escape all torment in those parts in the world to come: they
therefore reward the whipper, and esteem the whip (which I envy not to them)
sacred.

They are (but contrary to the Alcoran) addicted to sorceries and dreams:
their Priests write them letters or spells, to keep them from danger and harm
of shot, etc. called Septemcast.
Haymayly. They will write any thing for money, as letters of freedom for
servants to run away from their Masters, and such like. They make a show of
holiness, but are closely wicked, ignorant of their own law (to cover which,
they answer in dark sentences) and the people much more. Nothing is sin, to
count of, but that which endamageth civil society.

They esteem for good works, Their good works.
the buildings and endowings of Hospitals, making bridges and highways,
digging of pits, and wells, and conueying waters to highways and Cities,
building Bathes, and founding of Churches, and such like public works. Rostan
M. Harborn.
Bassa left his wife, the daughter of Soliman, at his death fifteen millions
of gold, and she had of yearly revenue half a million: she, amongst other her
works, attempted one most famous, which was a conduit to convey water, for the
use of the Pilgrims betwixt Cairo and Mecca, forty days journey; and for the
same intent procured the Sultan Selym her brother, to write to the Venetians
for a license to extract out of Italy an hundred thousand pound of steel,
only to make Chissels, Hammers, and Mattockes, for the cutting of certain
rocks, by which this water must pass.

Their Their oaths and vows
oaths (especially of their Emperors) are of many cuttes, and variety of
fashion. And for vows; in necessities and dangers; they will promise unto GOD
the sacrifices of beasts in some holy places, not upon Altars, but Andr.
Artuabene.
having flaide off the skin, they give it with the head, feet, and fourth
part of the flesh to the Priest; another part to the poor; the third to the
neighbors; the fourth is for the guests.

They are so addicted to the opinion of Fate, that GOD is esteemed to bless
whatsoever has success, as namely, Selims murdering his father; and to
detest what wants good event, whatsoever ground it had. They fear not the
Plague, accounting every man's time limited by fate, and therefore will wipe
their faces with the clothes of such as have died thereof.

They hold Munster Cos. lib.4. Bush.ep.3.and 4.
it alike acceptable to GOD, to offer alms to beasts, and to bestow it on men,
when it is offered for the love of GOD. Some there are, which will redeem
birds, imprisoned in their cages or coupes, and having paid their price, let
them fly. Others (for the love of GOD) cast bread into the water to feed the
fishes, esteeming it a work greatly meritorious; but dogs are accounted
unclean, in stead whereof they delight in cats, following (they say) their
Prophet Mahomet, who falling asleep at table, and awaking to go to his
devotions, rather cut off his sleeue, whereon he found his cat fast asleep,
then he would disturb her sleeping.

They say Moses was the first great Prophet, to whom was given the book
Tefrit, that is, the Law, and they which observed it in those times were saved.
But when men grew corrupt, GOD gave David the book Czabur, or the Psalter: and
when this prevailed not, JESUS was sent with the book Ingil, or the Gospel,
whereby in that time men were saved. Lastly, Mahomet received his Alcoran, and
all the former were disanulled. This Law and Lawgiver is so sacred to them,
that in all their prayers, even from their mothers breasts, they observe this
form: La illah, illelah Mahemmet irresullellah tanre rirpeghamber hace: That
is, there is no GOD but one, and Mahomet his Prophet: one Creator, and more
Prophets. This they suck in with their milk, and in their first learning to
speak lispe out this devotion. The infants go with the rest to their Mosquees
or Meschits; but are not tied to other ceremonies, saving washing, till they
are circumcised. Every man Ant. Menau.
has (in their opinion) from his birth to his death two Angels attending him;
the one at his right hand, the other at his left. At four or five year old
they send him to the school to learn the Soranz^ cal^ the Turkish law-book
Muschaph, which, says he, is called of the Arabians Alcoran, even as we for
excellency term the scripture; and the Hebrews, K^ra: besides the Alcoran
they had their other books of devotion, as Zuna, and happily this Curaam,
collected out of the Alcoran.
Curaam, and the first words which their Masters teach them are to this sense;
GOD is one, and is not contained in any place, but is through all, and has
neither father nor mother nor children, eats not, nor drinks, nor sleeps,
and nothing is like to him. The two Angels beforesaid, are called Chiramim and
Chiraetibin, which write the good or evil that men do against the day of
judgment. The Turks Magini Geogr.
abhor blasphemy not only against GOD and Mahumet, but also against CHRIST
and the Virgin MARY, and other Saints: and they punish blasphemers of
whatsoever Sect: they account it a sin for a man to build a house which shall
last longer then a man's life: and therefore howsoever they are sumptuous and
magnificent in their public buildings, yet are there private dwellings very
homely, and ill contrived. They eat much Opium, thinking it makes them
courageous in the wars. They Voyages du Villamoat.l 30 c 6.
have a remedy for pain in the head or elsewhere, to burn the part affected
with the touch-boxe (which they always carry with them,) or with some linen
cloth whereby they have many marks on their foreheads and temples, witnesses
of their needelesse and heedlesse respect to Physicians.

As the Scripture contains some prophecies ^^^. Brightman et sere omnes qui
in Apoc. comment. ediderunt.
of the arising and proceedings of the Turkish Nation, the rod of GOD, whereby
he scourges his Christian people; so have they also prophecies amongst
themselves of their end and ruin, when GOD in his mercy to Christians shall
execute justice upon the Turks, and cast the rod into the fire, wherewith
he had chastised his Children. Such an one is that which Georgiovitz
Bart.Georg. Italice, and Latin apud Lonic cru^ to.1.l.3. and Anglice.ap.Fox.
Act. and Mon. to. 1. in fine.
translateth and expounds: and such is that which Hist. Musul^^. l.15.
Leuncla^ius has transcribed out of their Book called Messabili, wherein is
written that Constantinople shall be twice taken before Degnall Lain, that is,
the Cursed Antichrist, shall come; once by the Sword, another time by the force
of the prayers of the sons of Isahac. Lain Phil Cai^erarius Medit. Hist.
Cent.3.c.10.
is an Epithete which they give to Degnal, signifying wicked or mischeeuous. Of
this Degnal the Turks Fable, that before his coming, shall Mechdi enjoy the
Empire. This Mechdi they say Hist Musul.l.16.
was descended of their prophet Mahumot, and walks invisible: one day he
shall come into light, and reign for a time: and after him shall Dagnal their
Anti-prophet, or Antichrist come. A certain Deruise offered to assault and
murder Bajazet the Great Turk, prosessing himself to be that Mechdi, and was
slain by one of the Bassa's.

As for the bloody practices which each Emperor uses in murdering his
brethren to secure him in his throne, in rooting out of the Nobility of the
countries which they conquer, in rasing the walls and fortresses of the
cities, least they should be receptacles for conspiracy, in translating
people from one country to another, in turning the countries into Timars, or
erecting fees and tenures of land to hold in service of the Turk in his
wars; whereby without any charge to him he maintains more horsemen in
continual pay and readiness then all the Princes Christian: also of their
Court, Seraile, manner of government by Vezier Bassas Beglerbegs, Siniacks,
etc. Of the Turkish Nauies revenues and other things: (not concerning their
Religion, but their policy) I hold it not suitable to our scope and argument.
Others in diverse languages have done it in set treatises and discourses. I
therefore (leaving these things to Laz. Soranz^ Ottoman. Knoll. Tur. Hist.etc.
others) from this relation of their opinions, will come to the public
exercise and practice of their Religion.

CHAP. XI.
Of the religious places amongst the Turks: their Meschits, Hospitalls and
Monasteries: with their Liturgy and Circumcision.

THE places The policy of the Turkish Empire.
of most religion to the Turks abroad are those which Mahumet himself
polluted with his irreligion: as Mecca, Medina, etc. The places of most
religion amongst themselves are their Mosches, or Meschits: that is, their
Temples and houses of prayer, (whereof they have many in all Turkey) and next
thereunto their Hospitals for the relief of the poor, impotent, and pilgrims.
Neither are the Turks sparing in these or the like (seeming) charitable
expenses. For when a Turk falls sick, and thinks he shall thereof die,
he sends for his friends and kinsfolks, and in their presence makes his
Testament: the greatest Legacies whereof are bequeathed to public uses, which
they think will be meritorious to their souls.

Such are the making and repairing of Bridges, Causeyes, Conduits to convey
water to their Hospitals or Temples. Some also give to the Redemption of
Captives. Many of their women (the deuouter sex, whether in Religion or
superstition) bequeath money to be distributed amongst such soldiers as have
slain any certain number of Christians: a deed in their conceit very
religious. These are the wills and deeds of the inferior sort. But the
Emperors, and great Bassa's, appoint Legacies to express a greater
magnificence with their devotion, as the building of Temples and Hospitals.

Their Temples or Meschites are for the most part four square, not much unlike
to our Churches, but larger in length then breadth. The Temple of Saint Sophie
in Constantinople is of all other in the Turks Dominion the most admirable,
built long since by Justinian, and (by Mahumet the conqueror) perverted to
this Mahumetan use above nine hundred years after. Of this Temple they write,
Pet. Gyllius: Topographia Constantinop.l.2.c.3.
that it was first built by Constantius, son of Constantine the Great, with a
roof of Timber: and burnt by the Arians in the time of Great Theodosius, who
again repaired it. Sozomenus Sozom.l.8.c.22.
says, that in the broiles which happened not long after in the reign of
Arcadins and Honorius about Chrysostom, the Church was fired, his enemies
ascribing it to his partakers, and they again to his Adversaries. It is
reported that Theodosius Junior rebuilt it. But in the time of Justinian,
Procopins Procop.de Aedisicijs Iustiniani l.1.
testifies, that base and wicked men burnt it again, which Justinian built
anew in such sumptuous and magnificent fort, that in regard of his change it
might have been wished that it had perished long before. His chief workmen
were Anthemius, and Isidorus, who raised it into a most goodly frame, which
might amaze the beholders, and seem incredible to the hearers. Both he and
Euagrius Euag.Hist. Ec. elesiast.l.4.c.30.
recite the particulars. The length was two hundred and threescore feet: the
breadth one hundred and fifteen: the height a hundred and fourscore. Zonaras,
Agathias, and Georgius Cedrinus tell of the harms it received by Earthquakes,
whiles Justinian lived, which yet he repaired, as did Basilius and Andronicus
after him. Nicephorus ^iceph. Ec.hist.l.9.c.9.
says, that Constantine raised the Temple of Peace (which before was but
small) to that large and stately greatness, which in his days it retained:
and his son Constantius finished the Temple of Sophia so near it, that they
seemed to have but one wall. It was Niceph.l.17.c.10.
founded by Constantine his Father: and was burnt in a sedition of the people,
in the reign of Justinian, in which rebellion thirty thousand of the people
were slain, and partly to pacify the wrath of God (says he) for so great a
slaughter, he built this temple. From the side of the temple he took Suidas in
Verbo Eopla.
four hundred twenty and seven pillars on an image of heathen Gods, and of
twelve signs of the Zodiake: and fourscore Statues of Christian Emperors,
which he distributed in the City. But more then enough of the ancient
structure thereof.

Gillius. The walls and roofes thereof are of Brick, the inner part lined
with Marble most excellent, and of diverse sorts, the roof is set with stones,
and pieces of glass gilded: Nature and Art conspiring to breed the beholders
both pleasure and wonder. It is so composed, and the Pillars and Arches so
placed, that the middle i will within (considered by it self) seems like the
form of an Egg, long and round: but the whole fabric both within and
without, yields to the curious obseruer a square form. All the inner part
has Arches, (in the top open to receive light) which are sustained with Marble
Pillars of diverse colors, and there are, says Bellonius, (if one may say it)
as many doors in that Temple, as are days in the year. It is far more
admirable then the Roman Pantheon: The work of that being gross, solid, and
easy for a workman to conceive, But this Sophian Temple is more subtle to the
view of the eye and mind. It has two rows of Pillars each over other, those
upper ones supporting the hemisphere loouer or steeple, which is wrought all
with Musaike work, garnished with gold and azure. The Doors or Gates are
covered with fine Latten of Corinth: one of which (they imagine) was made of
the wood of Noah's Arc. And therefore there are in it three places left
uncovered for the deuouter people to kiss, for the pardon of their sins. It
had sometimes above three hundred thousand ducats of yearly revenue. The
Turks, when they turkeised it, threw down the Altars, turned the bells into
great ordinance, and either took away the images, or put out their eyes, for
(say they) GOD, and not walls and pictures, is to be adored. Nicolas N.N.
Peregrination.l.2.c.10.
Nicolay says that it had in compass more then a mile, within which were
comprehended the houses of Canons and Priests: of the most part of the Cloister

made a stable for horses; as Constantines palace for Elephants; and a Temple
(near the Tilt-yard, or Hippodromus) for wild beasts, which are tied to the
several pillars thereof, Lions, Bears, Wolves, wild Asses, Ounces, etc. No
Christian may enter into this Meschit, but he may put his body in at the
doors and view it. There have been at once, in the time of Bajazet, numbered
three hundred and threescore thousand Turks assembled for devotion at an
Easter-solemnitie. It had in Justinians time porches or Galleries on both
sides, one of which it seems fell by some earthquake. The innumerable
windows and unspeakable ornaments of the Temple would easily detain our pen
as a willing prisoner in the relation thereof. But besides the ancient, P.
Gillius, Menauinus, Bellonius, Nicolay, and many others have done it already:
neither will my Pilgrimage suffer me to stay long in one place, which am to
visit so many, both here and elsewhere in the world. Let us proceed
therefore to their other temples.

Mahumet the conqueror N.Nicolay.
built one in like fashion without any figures, which has about a hundred
houses covered with Lead for their Doctors and Priests, and for all strangers
and pilgrims of any Nation or religion, where they may refresh themselves,
their servants, and horses for three days, with meat and lodging at free
cost. There are also without the precinct of the Mosche a hundred and fifty
other Tenements for the poor of the City, which have there an asper a day,
and as much bread as they need: but they account that kind of life so
unhappy, that oftentimes those Tenements stand empty: but the money which
should this way be bestowed is sent to the Hospitals of the diseased. There
are also five other Meschits, in former resembling the former, but not so great
nor so rich. The rest Pol. of the T.E.
of the Meschits are of diverse sorts, some high, some low, of several
fashions. The Turrets, upon which their Priests call the people to prayers,
are of a great height made in manner of watch-towers; their greater Churches
having two, the lesser one of them. Upon the tops is set an half Moon or
Crescent: which is the Turks ensign, as the Cross is usual to the
Christians. Within their Temples they have no kind of ornaments, but are
walls, with Arabian Letters (some in gold) written thereon, save only their
books, and Lamps burning with Oil in great abundance, and clothes of
Tapestry, on the which being spread over Mattes upon the pauement, they
prostrate themselves in prayer time.

Their Hospitals they call Imarets: of these there are great use, because they
want Innes in the Turkish dominions. They found them for the relief of the
poor, and of Travelers, where they have food allowed them (differing
according to the use of the place) and lodging places, without beds. They are
open for the most part to all men of all religions. The chief Hospitals in
Turkey, are in Constantinople: two of which Mahomet and Bajazet his son
founded. Both these have about five and twenty round Turrets covered with
Lead; one of which, being in the midst of the other, is larger and greater
then the rest, and under are lodgings for the Priests: On one side are beds for
Pilgrims and Travelers, on the other for Lepers. Thrice a day may any man
resort thither into a certain place for meat. There are maintained fourteen
Doctors of their law. Some say that the revenues of Mahomets Hospital
amounts to a hundred and fifty thousand ducats, and the other as much or
more. Each of which has a little Chapel adioining, in which the founders are
buried: who were at this grear charge, that the Priests and such as are there
refreshed should pray for their souls and say, Alla Rehfmetileson: that is,
GOD have mercy on them. Selim finished that which Bajazet his father had
begun to build. But his son Soliman erected one far surpassing the
former. Orchanes was the first of these Ottoman Princes which founded
Monasteries. Mahumet the first finished Knoll. Turkish Hist.
the great Temple at Hadrianople, the seat Royal of the Turks in Europe
before Constantinople was won. He built also, besides a palace, another
Temple with a most sumptuous Abbey, and a public school adioining, endowing
the same with great revenues. He also gave great sums of money to be
distributed yearly at Mecca and Medina, for the relief of poor Pilgrims.

their Kings, let him read Leunclau. at the end of the life of every Sultan, in

Soliman erected, in memorial of Mahumet his eldest son, a stately Toombe, a
sumptuous Church, a Monastery and College, with other things for the health
of his soul. He was buried himself in a Chapel which he had in his life
time built most stately with a College and Hospital, and his wife Roxolana
and some of his murdered children lying intombed by him: his Scimatar also
hanging by him, in token that he died in wars, which honor they grant not
otherwise to their Princes. The revenues of the country about Sigeth in
Hungary (lately won from the Christians) were given to the maintenance of
those houses which his devotion had founded. Neither is it lawful for them to
convert any Lands to such sacred uses, except they have first with their own
sword vvonne them from the enemies of their religion; the most acceptable
service to their Prophet. And therefore Selym the second, son and successor
of Soliman, intending to build a magnificent Temple, and munificent College,
Monastery and Almes-house at Hadrianople, where he intended his Sepulcher,
brake his league with the Venetians and wanne Cyprus from them, that thence he
might endow the same with maintenance. But it were tedious to insist further in
declaring their expenses, which devotion in all Turkey has procured: their
Emperors and Bassa's esteeming nothing of more honor in the world, or merit
for heaven. Let us come to their Church-rites and ceremonies.

The Temples in Turkey are (as has been said) innumerable, both public, and
private of meaner buildings: on which is a Tower, as with us a Sceeple,
whereupon the And.Ariuab.

stopping his ears with his hands, crying; There is no God but one, and
Mahumet his messenger: come to make prayer for remission of your sins, and
know that there is no stronger then the God of Mah. his messenger. This he
says in order on every side of the steeple. If there be in the City many
Moschees, the Cathedral begins, and then all the other parishion all
follow. This they do five times a day, and on Friday their Sabbath six times.
First at sun rising with four This bending or bowing they call Er^et, which
is a doubled bowing with prostrating himself: their prayer they call Czalamat,
which they make sitting after every Er^et, with a salutation on the right hand

bendings to the earth, and twice praying. The second about noone with ten
bowings, and five prayings: the third at afternoon before sunne-set, with
eight inclinations and four prayings. The fourth, with five bendings and three
prayings about sunset. The fifth longer then the rest with fifteen bowings and
eight prayings. Every Busurman is bound to resort to these their Liturgies at
his parishionall Meschite, except he have some lawful impediment: and if not
at all of them, yet at least at one to be well washed, for which purpose they
have innumerable Bathes in Turkey stately built: nor may any enter into the
Temple, especially in the morning, but first well washed in the Bathe as is
said before,: and if he keeps him clean the rest of the day, that washing
will serve: but Septem castr.
if he have committed any carnal sin, or be any way soiled, or have eaten
any unclean thing, then in some secret place he washes his hands and arms
to the elbow, his hinder parts Menauino says that after the secret washing of
their secrets, etc. They come forth and wash their hands, face, and the rest,
each three times, observing aequally that unequal number, and saying the Psalm

and priuities, and this suffices without going to Bathe, except he be
otherwise polluted. For defect herein they have inquisitions, and appointed
penalties; respect or pardon being given to none that fail, especially on
Friday, and in their Lent: such a one is carried about the town with a board
fastened to his neck, all be-hanged with Foxe-tailes, besides a penalty
according to his state in money: and he that will not thus order himself, shall
not be allowed their burial rites. After they are thus vvashed, they put off
their shoes in imitation of Moses, and then enter into the Meschitta, where
the floor is covered with Mattes or Carpets, nor is any other thing seen but
white walls, and great store of burning Lamps, and in golden Arabian letters

words before mentioned.

There is a Pulpit on which the Choza or Focqui ascends, and the first thing
he does is to stretch out his hands at large, and then ioining them together

kisseth the ground so many times as the hour of prayer according to that
former rule requires: and then lifting up himself again, he stretches out
his hands again, so standing about a quarter of an hour, and again kneeling
with his mouth to the ground, so continues moving it every way about a
Paternoster while, and then lifting up his head, and setting his hands to his
ears, falls to his praying another quarter of an hour, and then licenseth the
people to depart. There is no noise heard Their devotion, silence, honesty,

as if there had been nothing within.

Menauino thus describes their rites. After their mystical washing (as
before) they go with a sober pace to the Meschit (not like one which runs
away) and if he happen to break wind by the way, his former washing is
insufficient and he must return to renew it. Being assembled in the Meschit,
they all turn their faces They pray toward Mecca, as the Jew, toward
Jerusalem.
Southwards, and the Meizin or Muerden, (Clarke, Soxten, Priest, Bell-ringer,
or Bell rather) stands up and reads that Psalm which before he had cried
to them in the steeple, and every one stands up holding his hands fastened to
his waste, and bow their heads to their feet with great reverence and without
stirring. Then arises another Priest of another order called Imam and reads
a Psalm aloude, the Meizin as his Clarke answering, which being ended they
fall on the ground and say Saban alla, Saban alla, Saban alla, that is GOD have
mercy on us most vvretched sinners, abiding prostrate till the Priest Imam
sings again his Psalm, and then they rise. And this they do four or five
times according to the order of their service. After this they all kneel and
prostrate themselves on the ground, the Meizin observing a long ceremony, in
which with a loud voice he prays GOD to inspire the Christians, Jews,
Greeks, and generally all Infidels to return to their Law. This being said,
every man lifts his hand to heaven trying aloude, Amin, Amin: and then they
touch their eves, or wipe them with their hands, (which is, as crossing among
the Papists, a blessing themselves) bringing their hands over their face they
depart. In the English Treatise of the Turkish policy these things are related
with some other ceremonies: as that they say together with the Priest the first
azoara: or Chapter of the Alcoran, etc. Bartholomeus Bar. Georgievitz.
Georgionitz says that only the chief sort are bound to assemble to the daily
devotions which they observe five times a day; others which cannot spare the
times are not tied. Nobili and gli ociosi.
On their Sabbaths it is otherwise.

The women enter not their Mesquitas but on Fridaies at nine a clock, or at
Easter, and then they are in a Gallery or Terasse apart, where they may see and
not be seen, and this is not common to all, but the wives and mothers of the
chief of the place. And as we have said of the Priest, so it is to be
understood that all the men and women there do the same without sailing in any
point. They suffer not a Christian to enter therein: and yet will they enter
into the churches of the Christians to hear the church-musicke. The women
abide in their Churches from nine of the clock to midnight, continually
praying with certain motions and strange cries, continuing so long in this
act, that they fall upon the ground as in a swowne through weariness: and if
any feel her self at that time to be with child, the Turks hold that they
are conceived by the holy GHOST, and presently vow that child to GOD, and
call such Nefecs Ogli, that is, sons of the holy GHOST. And on Friday at nine
of the clock the Priest uses to preach to the people: and these their
discourses last about two hours. That which is said is not very manifest, yet
they say that he preaches the Miracles of Mahomet, sometime exalting their
faith, sometime commending obedience, and sometime rehearsing fabulous tales to
terrify the bad, as that such men's souls are carried of certain Camels,
there being about six thousand flying about in the air for this purpose, into
the Sepulchers of wicked Christians, and that the good Christians are put in
their empty Sepulchers, inueighing against the blasphemers of Mahumet, CHRIST,
and the Saints, exhorting to alms, rehearsing their commandments of the law.
And if they preach scandalous doctrine, the Mufti and the Cadilescher deprive
them, and correct them as heretics. Yea some of them, for preferring CHRIST
before Mahomet, are put to death: Of which one Ibraim Schec a Priest of
Constantinople, (reported to have wrought miracles amongst the Turks in the
days of Soliman) was stoned to death, his head cut off, and his body burned,
and of his Disciples some were beheaded, others thrust into the Galleys, for
preferring CHRIST, and denying Mahomet. And were it not for the terror of the
sword there would be more innouations of religion: and some have persuaded the
Grand Signior not to suffer the Alcoran to be so common to be read and
interpreted of every one; guilty of the absurdities therein contained. But to
return. After this preaching ended, two young Clerks go up to him and sing
certain prayers, which ended, the Priest again begins to sing with the
people in a base voice, with wrigling every way for the space of half an
hour, saying nothing but La illah, ilellah, that is, there is but one GOD. And
these ceremonies are done only on their Lenten Fridaies. Their Lent is one
Moon or month in the year, which, if this year it be July, the next it
shall be August, and so in order: that in twelve years they have fasted all
times of the year, making no other difference of meats then at other times,
but eating only in the night. They prepare Knoll. Tur. Hist. p.777.
themselves by diminishing their fare (not as the Christians at Shrof-tide)
that they may the better endure it: for on the day, in which they fast, they
will not so much as taste a cup of water, or wash their mouths therewith, till
the Stars appear: And eight or ten days after it begins, some Officers
ride about the town crying, Such a day begins the Fast, prepare ye,
prepare ye; and when it is begun, the Cadi and Subassi, if they find any
shops open, or any body eating in the day, set him on an Ass backwards, with
the tail in his hand, as Adulterers are punished. Neither will they suffer
Jews or Christians to scandallse their Turks this way. And when their Lent is
near the end, they go all to the Bathes and pluck off all their hairs, but
of the head and beard, with an ointment for that purpose: they color their
nails red with an enduring color called Chua, with which they die also the
nails and feet of their horses; and the women their hands, feet, and privy
parts. This they do in honor of their solemnity, which lasts three days
with great feasting in which nothing else but meats and drinks may be sold.
They go to the Sepulchers of the dead there to eat, full of gladness, and
salute each other, saying Baatam gluti^^zong, that is, GOD give you a good
Feast: and if they meet with a Jew or a Christian, woe unto them. The Turks
keep This second Easter is called Chuccihairam.

Arabians then to the Turks, except the pilgrims, which resort thither. The
Turks say they are Circumcision.
circumcised, because they are the sons of Ismael, and because they may be
clean when they go to their Temples, no filth lying hid under the skin. At
seven or eight years of age, or later, this ceremony is performed. The first
thing they do, is, to inuit many thither, both Turks, Jews, and Christians,
besides the friends and kindred; to make the greater gain, every one giving
somewhat according to his ability. When the day is come, they which are invited
mount on horseback, for else it is No solemnity without horses.
no solemnity, and go to the house of the child, who being mounted on a fair
horse richly clothed with a great Tullipant on his head, is carried to Church
with a long spear borne before him, having a torch on the top worth a
crown, more or less, according to the state of the party, adorned with Roses
and Garlands, which with the spear is left a gift to the Church, the fees of
the Priest: all the way they found on instruments: after the son follows
the father, the kindred, and the rest of the friends, that sometimes there are a
hundred horse; at Church they alight and accompany the child to the Priest,
which waits for them. Here one of the friends sits down, and on his lap
the child is set: presently another pulls off his shoes, another holds
his hands, and others his feet, and many hold him in talk with words, and
these are the gossips. The Priest seeing all things ready, takes the end of
the skin of his yard, and draws it out, and nippeth it with silver pinsers,
so to mortify it, and cut it off with less pain: then making him believe he
will defer it till the next day, he rises, the other holding him fast: and
after, as if he had forgot somewhat to be done about it, with sizzers, which
he holds closely in his hand, suddenly cutteth it off, and another lays
thereon a certain powlder to ease the pain, and in five and twenty days they
look to the curing of it, laying on it salt and marmalade of quinces, and
thence forwards he is called a Musulman. But his name is not then given him,
but at his birth, and that according to their quality.

After the child is loosed, who to show himself of courage, smileth, and
lifting up his greatest finger says those former words of their profession,
and is again mounted, and all the company, after a little prayer and offering
at the church, with like pomp conueigh him home, where is great feasting
provision; some feast it three days together.

Amurath circumcised his son Mahomet at sixteen years old. Unto which
solemnity many christian Princes were solemnly invited, who sent thither their
ambassadors with presents, who had there their scaffolds prepared for them, and
furnished according to their states. The solemnity lasted forty days, and
forty nights, in the great market place of Constantinople. And to end these
Knol page^57
solemnities, Mahomet the Prince was circumcised, not publicly, but in his
fathers chamber, by Mechmet one of the inferior Bassaes, sometime the Emperor
Solymans Barber. And it is done of other Turks also most commonly in the
fathers house, not in the Church.

The women-children about the same age among other women without other
solemnity say over those words, La illah, etc. Georgiouitz.
and likewise the Jews; but the Christian renegadoes are carried about the
streets of the cities, with much solemnity, and many gifts given them, besides
freedom from tribute: many blinded by covetousness offer themselves to this
circumcision. But if any for blasphemy against Mahomet, or injury to a Turk
be by force circumcised, they have no such gifts: which punishment the
Cadilescher (by the testimony of two accusing Turks) inflicteth. And therefore
to prevent the same, the Christians obtain the grand Seigniours safe conduct,
that in cases of conscience they may not be judged of any, except they were
accused at the Court before the four Bassaes, and the Cadilefcher of
Constantinople, and that by the witness of Priests only which had not in
twelve years drunk wine.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Sepulchers, Funerall-rites, and opinions touching the dead, among the
Turks.

NOw, if you be weary of viewing their Temples, and their prayers and other
ceremonies seem tedious, I have thought fit to present you with another sight,
and to conclude with (that which is the conclusion of all flesh) a discourse of
their Funerals. When Menauino lib.2. 19. Policy of the Turkish Empire.
a Turk is sick and like to die, his friends visit him, and putting him in
mind of his sins, advise him with a penitent heart to bewail them. Then do
certain of their Priests, or one of his kinsmen, read some Psalms and
Prayers. And if the pangs of death do still continue, they bring him the
Alcoran, or Curaam wherein is one Legend called Thebara Echelezi, which they
read seven times: and if he shall die of that sickness, they think he will
die before they have thrice read it: and if they see breath still remain, they
read another Psalm called Iasinnel Curanil Hecin, to the end that the Devil
cause no impediment to his soul. When he is dead, they lay him forth in the
mids of the house upon carpets, and place him on his right side, with his
face toward the South. Then do assemble certain Priests to bury him, bwho
bring with them a string of beads (such as the Papists use in mumbling and
numbering their devotions) being a thousand of them, of lignum aloes, and
therewith compass the body, and then say to every one Subahan Alla, that is,
God have mercy on him, and turn it about four or five times. If it be a
woman which is dead, the women take this care and pains about it, to lay her
forth, etc.
After this, their Priests (which are twenty or more) carry the corpse into the
garden, and lay it on a Table two handesbreadth from the ground, taking away
his shirt, and, covering his shame with a new cloth made of fine bombast, with
warm water and soap, wash him from top to toe: then do they take two sheets
of bombast, in which they wrap the corpse, wetting the same with rose water,
perfumes, and odoriferous things, and laying him on the beer, cover him quite
over with his best garments, placing his turbant at the head thereof, all
bedecked with flowers. Then do the Priests begin their devotions, and some of
the company take up the beer, carrying the same with the head forwards to the
Meschit: the kinsmen follow, and the women remain at home weeping, and make
ready to eat for the Priests. When they come to the Church, they set him down
without doors, and go and make an end of their service. After that, they
carry him forth of the City to the burial place: (for it is not lawful to
bury in their Cities) some provide their Sepulchers in their life time, some
have them made after by their friends, either in their Gardens, or some
solitary place: They have also common burial places, as are our Churchyards,
wherein are many tombs of marble, brick, or other matter, according to the
quality of the person.

If the deceased were a man of high condition, his horses are led with his
corpse, and his toomb is adorned with many Epitaphs. And if he were a great
Commander, those horses are sadled the contrary way, and richly furnished,
having certain things hanged at their noses which cause them to neigh, as it
were lamenting the loss of their Master. They carry also the truncheons of
their Lances with their Standards and Ensigns, trailing along the ground.
There are planted also about their Sepulchers violets and other pleasant
flowers. The common sort have their toombes of marble engraven with letters.

When they are come to the place, with those sheets they let it into the
grave, covering him on every side with Georgiouitz lib.2. says, that they make
over the grave the sorm of an Altar, left the beasts should go over it, and
defile it. They also often repair thither with tears, and set on the monument
flesh, bread, wheat, eggs, milk, etc. which is done for the dead man's soul in
alms to the poor, or to the birds, or ants, which they also account an act of
mercy, no less meritorious then the other.
boordes, only on the face they lay a little earth, and there leave him, and
return home, where they find store of cheat, and there make a prayer for his
soul. The Priests have five aspers a piece given them for their pains. And if
the party be poor, they gather money, to pay the Priests, and to discharge the
funerals. They wear blackes eight days in token of mourning: and those that
are of great account, three days: at which time the friends of the dead
assemble, and using some words of mutual consolation, from thenceforth resume
their wonted habit. Howbeit their kindred, specially of the female sex, often
repair to the graves to lament there. Bellonius in his Obseruat. Bellon.li
3.ca.5.
observes, that they sow not the sheet at the head nor at the feet. The
reason is, their dream of certain Angels, sent in commission presently after
the burial, to examine the deceased party, into whom they say God has then put
a new spirit. These Angels Menavino calls Nechir and Remonchir, who come with
dreadful countenances and burning firebrands, and examine him of his life,
which if they find wicked, they scourge him with fiery whips, if good, they
become goodly Angels, and comfort him. Bellonius alittle otherwise tells,
that those Angels (which he calls Guanequir and Mongir) come, the one with an
iron hammer, the other with a hook, which set the corpse upon his knees, and
put a new soul into it; and then ask if he have believed Mahumet and observed
his precepts, if he have done good works, kept their Lent, paid his Tithes,
given alms. Of which, if he can give good account, they depart from him, and
two other Angels come in their places, white as snow, and one of them puts
his arms in stead of a pillow under his head, the other sits at his feet, and
defends him until the day of Judgment. But if he satisfy not the demands of
those black Angels, he with the iron mallet strikes him at one blow therewith
nine fadome under the ground: and neither of them cease, the one with his
hammer, the other with his hook, to torment the deceased party until the day
of Judgment. For this cause the Turks write upon their dead carcasses the name
Croco, and make their Sepulchers hollow, that they may have room to kneel,
and some lay boards over, that no earth fall in. The fear here of makes them
in their morning prayer to say; Lord GOD from the questioning of the two
Angels, the torment of the grave, and the evil journey, deliver me, Amin.
Yea, hence are the prayers which the Turks, men and women, say at the graves of
the dead, for delivery from these Angels.

Concerning the day of Judgment, they Menauino li.2.20, 21,22,23.
hold that there is an Angel standing in Heaven named Israphil, holding always
a Trumpet in his hand prepared against God command to found the consummation
of the World. For at the sound thereof, all men and Angels shall die, for so
they find it written in their The Turkish Curaam does not agree in all things
with the Alcaran. as appears by comparing the text of the one and quotations
of the other.
Curaam, which book is of high authority with them, and is sometimes called
the Alcoran, though it seem rather to be taken out thereof then to be the
Text it self. The Turkish Doctors would dissent from that opinion of the
Angels mortality, if this Book would give them leave: for to contradict the
authority thereof is punished with fire, or else their tongues are pulled out
of their heads. They hold, that after this dismal sound shall be a great
Earthquake, which shall tumble mountains and rocks from their places, and
grind them to meal. After this, GOD will return to make a new the light, and
the Angels as before, and will cause to fall a pleasant rain called Rehemet
sui, that is, the rain of mercy: and so shall the earth remain forty days,
although those days shall be of a larger size then these. Many also hold, that
from thencefoorth there shall be no darkness of the night, as now, but that it
shall be most clear, neither shall there need any more sleep for the
sustentation of our bodies.

After forty days God will command Israphil to sound his Trumpet the second
time, at which sound all the dead The resurrection.
shall be raised again by the will of God, the dead even from Abel to the end of
the world, throughout all the earth, hearing the sound thereof, and rising in
manner as they were buried. Amongst them shall be seen diverse faces and
countenances, some shining as the Sun, many like the Moon, many as the
Stars. Others shall be obscure and dark, and others with hogs faces, with
swollen tongues. Then shall every one cry, Nessi Nessi, that is, Woe is me
wretch who have suffered my self to be overcome with my filthy lusts. The
Angels shall with their fingers point at the faces which shine, which are they
that have wrought good works, and shall show them to one another. The wicked
shall have envy thereat. They say, that those with faces like hogs, are such as
have bin usurers: and those with the swollen tongues, liers and blasphemers.
There shall be others trodden under foot, to wit, the proud persons of this
world. God, say they, will then demand account of the kings, princes, emperors,
and tyrants, which use oppression and violence. The Judgment.
Then shall God divide this raised company into seventy parts, all which shall
be examined, presenting their sins before their eyes, and all that they have in
this world done well or ill: whereto he shall need no testimony; every member
bearing witness against it self of the deeds, yea and very thoughts. There
shall be also Michael the Angel holding in his hand the balance of divine
Justice, and shall weigh souls, and distinguish the good from the bad. There
shall be Moses with his Standard, under which shall all the obseruers of his law
be assembled. Near to him shall be Jesus Christ the son of the virgin Mary with
an other great Standard, and all his Christians, the obseruers of his faith. On
the other side shall be Mahomet with his standard and faithful Mahumetans: they
which have done good shall be all gathered under the said standards, where they
shall have a pleasant shadow; the rest shall be extremely scorched by the heat of
the Sun, according to the measure of their sins. Thus shall both parts abide,
till God shall pronounce his eternal sentence. When that doom is pronounced,
the Angels shall stand divided in squadrons, all alike adorned, the Seraphins
on one side, the Cherubins on the other: of the which, one part shall sound
instruments of diverse sorts, and the other shall sing hymns: and many shall
stand at the gates of Paradise singing and gratulating the blessed souls which
have observed the divine Precepts; Christians, Jews, Turks, and Moors, being
all of equal beauty and beatitude, if they have done well. Paradise.
But sinners shall be known asunder. They affirm also, that God will give those
souls of Paradise a large space in heaven for their everlasting habitation,
goodly and shining. They shall also have Barachi, Sun beams, on which they
may ride and take their view round about Paradise, of the precious delights
therein. There shall they have pleasant fruits, and if they eat one apple, two
shall grow in the room; and to quench their thirst, they shall have rivers
clear as Cristall, sweet as sugar, by drinking of which their sight and
understanding shall increase, in such sort, that they shall see from one Pole to
the other. The meats which they eat, shall consume by a subtle kind of sweat.
Further they say, they shall have their women called Vri, that is, shining,
which shall every day be virgins, with which they shall continue for ever.
Neither shall there be any danger of old age; the men always being of thirty
years old, the women of fifteen or twenty. Those three Standard-bearers
shall be the principal, each of them having a peculiar part of Paradise assigned
him for his dominion.

Those which for their bad deeds shall be condemned to hell, Hell.
shall be all known by proper names, which they shall bear in their forheads:
and they shall bear the number and greatness of their sins on their
shoulders. Thus shall they be led between two mountains where Hell is
situate, at the mouth whereof is a most venomous serpent: and from one
mountain to an other is a bridge thirty miles long, which is so made, that
they ascend on the first part, the other part is plain, the last descends.
This bridge (say they) is made of thin iron and sharp: (they call it Serat
Cuplissi, that is, the bridge of Justice.) Upon this shall pass the sinners
with the heavy weight of their sins upon their shoulders: and they which have
not been altogether evil shall not fall into Hell, but into Purgatory: but
the other shall suddenly be plunged into the bottom of hell, where they shall
burn, more or less, according to the quantity of the fire of their sins,
which they have carried out of this world: and after the burning they turn to
be refreshed, and presently again to the fire. In the mids of Hell they say
is a tree full of fruit, every apple being like to the head of a Devil, which
grows green in the mids of all those flames, called Zoaccum Agacci, or the
tree of Bitterness, and the souls that shall eat thereof, thinking to refresh
themselves, shall so find them, and by them and their pains in Hell, they
shall grow mad. And the Devils shall bind them with chains of fire, and
shall dragge them up and down through Hell. Those souls which sometime shall
name God in their aid, they say, after many years, shall go into Paradise;
and none shall remain in Hell, but such Bell.Obseru.libr.3.cap.6. Resurrection
of Rams.
as despair of their salvation and Gods mercy. Thus far Menavino. To this
agreeeth Bellonius, and adds, that in the day of Judgment, they believe a
resurrection of the birds and beasts: and that the Rams which they kill at
their Easter, shall go into Paradise: and therefore, though one should serve,
they kill many. For the Book of Zuna says, that those Rams shall pray for
their Sacrificers in the day of Judgment. It tells that the Stars are hanged
in the air by golden chains, to watch lest the devils should learn the
secrets of Paradise, and reveal them to Soothsayers. Also, that the Ram
which Abraham offered in stead of his son, was a black one, which had been
nourished forty years in Paradise, that Mah. shall be turned at the end of
the world into a Ram; and the Turks into Fleas, whom he shall carry sticking
to him, out of Hell into Paradise, and there shake them off, where they shall
again receive the forms of Turks: That he shall wash them with the water of
that Fountain in Paradise, to purge the blackenesse which they got by the
scorching of Hell, from whence he will deliver all good Turks.

CHAP. XIII.
Of the Religious Votaries amongst the Turks, and of their Saints.

TO proceed unto the differences of opinion amongst the Turks: Septemcastrensis
(who lived very many years amongst them) says, that although they consent
against CHRIST, yet do they much dissent among themselves, wresting the
Alcoran to their purposes, and scarcely one of a hundredth agreeing with his
fellow about Mahomet and their Law. And besides their differences in
Ceremonies, there are, says he, four sects differing in maine grounds of
Religion: which would not be appeased without blood, if they feared not the
higher power, and were not thereby kept in awe. One of these sects is that of
the Priests, holding, that none can be saved, but by the Law of Mahomet. The
second of their religious Dermschler, reputed the successors of the Saints, the
friends of God and Mahomet, who are of opinion, that the Law profits
nothing, but the grace of God: and these ground their opinions on miraculous
illusions, of which he reports one in the time of Amurath the second, who
examining this contention betwixt these Seculars and Regulars, and being
purposed to give sentence in the behalf of the Priests, and against the
religious, one of these Dermschler Visions and Apparitions among the Turks
as well as among the Papists.
appearing to him in a vision, (others also ground Faith on Visions) and
delivering him out of a great danger, altered his mind: for going to the
stool in the night, the boords gave way, and he fell in, staying on a cross
timber, where this religious man in their wonted habit appeared to him, and
bid him now use the help of his Priests for his deliverance. This after so
affected the King, that himself became a religious man till the necessity of
State-affaires compelled him to resume his government. (He that lists may
compare with this Dunstans devises for his Regulars:) The third he calls
Czofilar speculatiue men, which Sect is founded on Tradition, holding that they
are saved by Merit, without Law or Grace. These are very earnest in prayers,
never ceasing; and meeting in the night, and sitting in a Circle they begin to
say, Layla illalach, with shaking their heads till they fall down senseless:
these three sorts are manifest to the people, and as it were of equal esteem
with them: The fourth are called Horife that is, Heretics, holding, that every
man is saved in his own Law, and all Laws to be alike good to the obseruers:
these are burned if they be taken.

Strange it is, that he reports of the miraculous works of some of them,
that they may seem (as he says) incarnate Deuilles: Some going naked, with
their priuities only hidden, and some of these are impassible, besides the
violence of Winter and Summer, enduring, like stones, the branding with fire or
wounding with sword: Some seldom eat or drink, and some, not at all: others,
but from hand to mouth; some are perpetually silent, having no conversation
with men, of which he says he saw one: and some have their supernatural
traunces or rauishments: Some dwell amongst men, some by themselves apart, and
some in wilderness: Some keep hospitality in Cities, atleast to harbor men, if
they have not food for them: some carrying about water in leather bags,
giving it to all, and demanding nothing for the same, except any voluntarily
gratify them. Some inhabit at the Sepulchers of the Saints, keeping the same,
and living on the vows and offerings of the people, not observing the washings
and ceremonies of the Law. As concerning those Water-carriers, Nichalas
Nicholay says, that he has seen in a morning at Constantinople fifty of
those Sacquas (so he calls them) in a company, all furnished with their
scrippes of leather full of Cisterne or Fountaine-water hanging on their side,
with Cups of fine Corinthian latten gilded and damaskined, bearing in the
same hand a Looking-glass, which they hold before the eyes of them whom they
give to drink, admonishing them to think on Death: and if any give them any
thing, they out of a Violl cast on their faces sweet smelling water. He tells
of some that would seem to live a solitary life amongst beasts, but indeed
live in shoppes in most popular Cities, the walls whereof are covered with
skins of diverse beasts, and upon the horns thereof they hang tallow candles.
In the midst of this their sacred shop stands a stool covered with a
green cloth, and upon the same a great latten candlestick, without any
candle. Moreover, they have painted a Cimiterre hung in the midst, in memory
of Haly, who forsooth with his sword cut the rocks in sunder: and they breed up
with them, beasts, as bulls, bears, hearts, ravens, eagles; so that in stead
of their living with beasts, beasts live with them. And if sufficient be not
brought to their shoppes, they with one of these beasts in their hand go about
the streets begging.

vowed their lives for their superstition. Antonie Pagifetta Knol.page.834
reports, that as the Emperors Ambassadors were conveyed from the presence of
the great Turk to their lodging, by the Ianizaries and their Aga, there were
amongst them certain religious men called Haagi which use to follow the
Ianizaries, who continually turning about, and in their going, singing, or
rather howling certain Psalms or Prayers for the great Sultans welfare, made
them wonder that they fell not down for giddiness.

But amongst all their orders of Religion, Nicholas Nicholai, M.N.l.3.c.15 and
Christoph. Richerius.
and before him Menavina, reckon four which are most common amongst them, the
Giamailer, the Calender, the Dervisi, and the Torlachi.

The Giamailer are for the most part, fair young men, of rich houses, which
give themselves to travel through diverse Regions, at other men's charges,
under color of Religion: carrying with them none other apparel then a little
Cassocke of Purple color, girt with a girdle of silk and gold: upon the ends
whereof-hang certain cimballs of silver mixed with some other cleare-sounding
metal, and they do ordinarily wear six or seven of these about their
girdles, and under their knees. Instead of a cloak they are covered with the
skin of a Lion or Leopard, being whole and in his natural hair, which they
make fast upon their breast, by the two former legs. All the rest of their
bodies are bare: saving that they weare-great Rings on their ears, and a kind
of sandalls on their feet, their hair grows long like women's, disheueled
over their shoulders. They bear in one of their hands a Book, written in the
Persian language, full of amorous Sonnets. And thus with their voices and
cimbals, they make pleasant music, especially if they meet some fair
stripling, whom they set in the midst of them, and incompasse with their
morice-musicke. These are the Pilgrims of love; and under pretext of Religion
do draw unto them the hearts of women and yonglings, and are called the men of
the Religion of love; unto which order of Religion youth is prone more then
enough. The partakers of their music ordinarily impart to them of their coin.

The Calender Nic.Nic.16.
is of a contrary profession to the former glorying of abstinence and
chastity. They have for their dwelling certain little Churches, which they
call Techie, over the gates whereof they do write these or like words,
Coedanormas, dil ersin cusciunge al, cachecciur: that is, they which will enter
into their religion, must do works liketheirs, and remain in their
virginity. These Calenders are clothed with a little short coat without
sleeves, after the fashion of a haire-cloth, made of wool and horse-haire, and
do not let their hair grow long, but cut the same, and cover their heads with
felt-hats, like the Priests of, Graecia, about which hang certain strings,
about the breadth of an hand, made of horse-haire: in their ears, and about
their necks and arms they wear great rings of iron. They pierce the skin
under their privy member, thrusting through the same a ring of an indifferent
bigness and weight, to bar them from venerie, if they were thereunto otherwise
willing. They also go reading of certain songs, made by one of their Order,
called Nerzimi, the first Saint and Martyr, after their reckoning, of their
religion, who for certain words spoken against the law of Mahomet, was in
Azamia flaide quick. Menauino Lib.2.cap.10.
says, he had read some of his writtings agreeing with the Christian faith in
many points. Some Policy of the Turkish Empire.
say, he was martyred for confessing CHRIST.

The Deruis go bare-headed, and cause their head and beard to be cut with a
rasor, and all the hairie parts of their body: and burn also their temples
with a hot iron, or an old piece of cloth burnt; having their ears pierced,
wherein they do wear certain great rings of Jasper. All their clothes are two
sheep or goats skins, the hair thereof being dried in the Sun, one before,
and the other behind, embracing the body in form of a girdle, otherwise naked,
Winter and Summer. They dwell without the Cities in Suburbs and Villages. Thus
under the color of Religion they roame up and down, and make no conscience to
rob, kill, and murder, if they find themselves the stronger (with a small
hatchet which they bear under their girdle) all men of whatsoever law
ornation. They are fornicators, and most detestable in that most detestable
sin of Sodomie. For show of holinesle they eat of a certain herb This
seems to be the same herb which Menauixo calls Asseral.
called Matslach, the violent operation whereof makes them to become mad, so
as through a certain fury, they with a certain knife or rasor, do cut their
necks, stomachs and thighs, until they be full of most horrible wounds;
which to heal, they lay upon them a certain herb, letting it lie upon their
hurt, until it be altogether consumed into ashes, suffering in the mean time
extreme pain with marvelous patience. Thus do they imitate their Prophet
Mahomet, who, through abstinence in his den, fell into such a fury (say
they) that he would have thrown himself from the top of it. And therefore
fools and mad men are in great reverence: yea they account such for Saints:
and if such mad men strike or rob them, they take it in good part, and say
they shall have good luck after it. They erect stately monuments over such
mad men's graves, as at Aleppo, Biddulph ep. Fools are esteemed beloved of
God: if such be Christians they circumcise them by force, and esteem them
Saints saying. God has made him a fool, thus to be saved by their means.
one Sheh Bonbac (who being mad, went always naked) being dead, they built
an house over his grave, where to this day (says our Author) there are lamps
burning day and night, and many of these Daruises there maintained, to look to
his sepulcher, and to receive the offerings of such as come, as many do every
week out of Aleppo. If any be sick or in danger, they vow to offer money or
other things to Sheh Boubac if they recover.

The same account they make of one Sheh Mahammet a mad man, yet living in
Aleppo, going naked with a spitte on his shoulder. Men and women will come and
kiss his hand, or some other part of his body, and ask him counsel, for
they hold that mad men's souls are in heauen-talking with GOD, and that he
reuealeth secrets to them. And even the Bassaes themselves will kiss and
consult with this Oracle. Hard I deem it to say whether is the mad man. In a
late victory against the Christians, they affirm that this Sheh Mahammet was
seen in the field many thousand miles distant, fighting against their enemies,
whom by his help they overcame.

But to return to our Daruises, this our Author says, that oftentimes great
Bassaes, in displeasure with the Emperor, will retire themselves into this
Order, as the Hospital and Sanctuary of their diseased and dangerous state.
Their witness is of better account then any other man's, although he were an
Emir, or of the kindred of Mahomet. They live of alms, as the other Religious
do, which they beg in the name of Haly. They have Nic Nichol.
in Natolia a sepulcher of a Saint called by them Scidibattal, who (say they)
conquered the most part of Turkey, and about the place of the sepulcher is an
habitation and Covent, where, above five hundred of these Deruises dwell: and
there once in the year they keep a general assembly, in which their
Superior (whom they call That is, the Father of fathers.
Assambaba) is present and President; their Counsel or Chapter consisting
(says Menauinus) of above eight thousand of their Order. One of these
Deruislars Knolles p.463.
drawing near unto Bajazet the second, as if he would have received an alms
of him, desperately assailed him with a short Scimitar, which he closely hid
under his hypocritical habit. But Bajazet by the starting of his horse (afraid
of this hobgoblin) avoided the deadly blow, but not unwounded: neither had he
so escaped, had not Ishender Bassa with his horse-mans Mace presently struck
down the desperate villain, as he was redoubling his blow, who was forthwith
rent in pieces by the soldiers. Bajazet thereupon proscribed all them of that
superstitious Order, and banished them out of his empire. The like (as Septem
castrensis says) they had attempted against Mahomet his father in his youth,
while Amurath was yet living. And in our days Mehemet or Muhemet, the great
Vizier Bassa, who swayed almost wholly and only that mighty Empire (as
appears in the history of that State) in the days of Solomon, Selym, and
Amurath, and as Master Harborne relates, was esteemed to possess two and
twenty millions of gold, was not assaulted only, but murdered by one of these
Deruislers. For whereas it is a custom of the great men, that at ordinary
hours all their Chaplains, or Priests, assemble themselves in the Diuano,
there together mumbling their superstitions: and this Deruisler Knol.Turk. Hist
p950.
ordinarily thither admitted, upon an old grudge, for that Mehemet had before
deprived him of a soldiers place and pension, when the Vizier sat there to
give public audience, sitting right against him, after his Mumpsimus finished,
the Vizier reaching unto him his wonted alms, he with a dagger closely before
provided, stabbes him into the breast, and was therefore of Mehemets slaves
with exquisit torments done to death. In their great Counsel before mentioned,
there are young men clothed in white, which tell the most memorable observations
in their travails, which they present to the Assambaba in writing, subscribed
with their names. On the Friday they use after prayer and eating, the herb
Asseral is an herb, that makes men merry, as if they were drunkon.
Asseral, to read the same with daunces, and after their dance (which is
about a huge fire, made of as much wood as an hundred beasts can carry) they
cut the skin of their arms, legs, or breasts, engrauing some figure
thereon, whereto they after apply ashes and urine: In the doing hereof they
utter this speech: This I cut for the love of such a woman. Upon the last day
of their feast, they take leave of their Governor, and depart in troops like
soldiers with banners and drums; and so return to their own Monasteries.

The Torlaquis by other called Durmislurs, cloth themselves with sheep and
goats skins, like unto the Deruis: above the same they wrap about them in manner
of a cloak the skin of a great Bear, with the hair, made fast upon their
stomach with the legs: upon their heads they wear a white bonnet of felt
folded with small plaits, having the rest of their bodies altogether naked. They
also burn their Temples as the former. A beastly generation. For they know
not, nor will learn to read, write, or do any civil profitable act, but
live idly upon alms, roaguing through the Country alone, and in troops through
the deserts, robbing such as they meet handsomely apparelled, causing them to
go as they do, naked. They profess palmistry and fortune-telling, the people
feeing and feeding them for such vanities. And sometimes they carry with them an
old man, whom they worship as a God: lodging themselves near the best house of
the town where they come. And there this new numen, and old impostor, faining
himself ravished in spirit, pronounces grave words and spiritual
commandments; at sundry times lifting up his eyes to heaven, and after turning
to those his disciples, wills them to carry him from thence, for some eminent
judgment there to be executed, as is revealed to him. They then pray him to
auert that danger by his prayer, which he accordingly does: which the people
(deluded by their hypocrisies) reward with large benevolence, at which they
after amongst themselves do merrily scoff. They eat also of the herb
Ma^slatz, and sleep upon the ground naked of clothes and shame, and commit
also abominable Sodomitrie. And thus much of their misorderly orders of an
irreligious Religion. He that will read more at large of them, let him read
the book of the Policy of the Turkish Empire, which out of Menauino
discourses more largely of these things, and other the Turkish rites.

Septemcastrensis Cap.15.
tells of certain Saints of exceeding estimation for holiness, whose
sepulchers are much frequented of devout Votaries: as that of Sedichasi (which
signifies a holy conqueror) in the confines of Caramania. Another is called
Hatsehipettesch that is, the Pilgrims help. Another Assich is the Goddess of
love with the Georgiou^z.
Ascik passa who helps in loue-matters, and for children, in barrenness.
Another, Van passa, for concord: and Scheych passa, in trouble and affliction:
and Goi or Muschin or Rartschin passa, inuoked for their cattle: and Chidir
else for travelers, to whom he sometime appears as a traveler; and any one
that has extraordinarily lived, is imputed a Saint after his death.

They have many whose names I remember not (says he) in like reverence with
them, as are the Apostles with us. When they would seek for things lost, they
go to one Saint; when they are robbed, they go to another; and for the
knowledge of things secret, they repair to a third. They have their Martyrs,
and Miracles, and Relics. Thus they tell of certain religious men condemned
wrongfully, for suspicion oftreason, to the fire; which they entered without
harm (as Dan.3 27.
those three companions of Daniel) and their shoes were hanged up for a
monument. Their Nephes ogli that is, souls or persons begotten of the holy
Spirit (such is their fancy) without seed of man, they hold in such
reputation, that they account themselves happy, which can do them any good,
yea that can touch them: and if their hairs be laid upon any, they say that
their sicknesses are cured.

In this reputation of sanctity they have a certain old woman, which having a
dog with her (in her pilgrimage to Mecca) ready to die for thirst, made water
in her hand, and gave it to the dog: which charitable act was so highly
accepted, that a voice was presently heard from heaven, saying, This day thou
shall be in Paradise. And at the same time she was caught up body and soul
into heaven: and hereupon are they liberal to their dogs. If this cross an
opinion, which some Saracens hold, that women come not to Paradise, no marvel,
seeing falsehood is commonly contrary both to the Truth, and it self. He that
would read the miraculous tales which they tell of their Saints, may have
recourse to that namelesse Author, which of his country is called, and here
often cited by the name, Septemcastrensis: who tells Septemcast^ cap.18.
of his Master and his Mistress their devotion and vows to Goi and Mirtschin,
for preservation of their cattle, sometimes miraculous (so ready is the
Devil with his saving destruction, and destroying preservation) yea he says,
that the Devil does turn himself amongst them into an Angel of light, with
such effectuallillusions, that there are seen, or (at least) believed amongst
them, the dead raised to life, diseases of all sorts cured, secrets of the
hearts disclosed; treasures, long before hidden in the ground, revealed: and
besides, such oftentation, and show of dissembled holiness, that they may
seem not to come short of the Fathers and Apostles in that behalf: if bodily
exercise were the trial of sanctity.

Busbequius Busbequius epist.1.
tells, that they have like conceit of one Chederles, amongst them, as some
superstitious persons have of Saint George and the Turks affirm to be the
same: The Deruis have a great Temple dedicated in his honor at Theke Thioi, not
far from Amafia, the chief City of Cappadocia. The Country and both
Legends agree, for the killing of the Dragon, delivering the Virgin, etc. They
say that he traveled many countries, and at last came to a river, the waters
wherofyeelded immortality to the drinker, and now cannot be seen. Chederles
hereby freed from death, rides about every where on his horse (which thence
also drank in immortality) and delights in battles, taking part with the
best cause: and to make up the tale, they say he was one of the companions of
Alexander Alexander Mug. was also one of their Saints.
the Great; they affirm, that Alexand was Salomons chief captain, and Job
his high steward. In that Moschee or Temple at Theke Thioi is a fountain of
water, which they say, sprang up of the staling of Chederles horse. Like
stories have they of his horse-keeper, and nephew, whose sepulchers they show,
where devout pilgrims obtain many blessings. They show for relics the pieces
of the shoes which Chederles his horse brake in that Dragon-fight, and use the
same in drink against agues and headaches. These places are full of Dragons
and Vipers. Sultan Murat Chan, Leuncla.hist.Musul.lib.14.
or Amurath the second in a battle against the Christians, used this prayer,

appeared on white horses in a battle against the Christians, and slew them.
These (they say) are friends to the Islams, that is, Catholic, or
right-beleeuing Musulmans, and are divine protectors of the Imania or Mahumetan
law. Such tales you may read in the Spanish relations of the West Indies, as
at the battle of Tauasco, History of the West Indies.Lop. de Gom.

Gaib-erenlers are diverse: and perhaps that Martial nation in conquest of the
Christians of those parts, would soon reconcile themselves to that martial
Saint, and drink in those further devotions which his horse pissed. Such
Emblemes were those of Christopher, Catherine, George, which the Papists
invoke as Saints; an error proceeding from those pictures (as it seems) in
Churches, according to that of the Prophets, Ierem.10.8.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of their Priests, and Hierarchy.

AFter the discourse of their Regulars (which in estimatlo^ of devotion have
with the Turks, and therefore in this history, the first place) their Secular
Priests follow to be considered. These are of differing degrees, which Menauino
Lib.2.cap.3.
thus reckons: first the Cadilescher, under which the Mofti or Mufti; the
third the Cadi, and after these (in subordinate orders) the Modecis, Antippi,
Imam, Meizini, and besides these the Sophi, A certain Ragusian, Edit. Alcorani
Latin.
in an Oration before Maximilian the Emperor does not much disagree: but for
Cadilescher, he calls the first Pescherchadi, whereof (he says) there are
two, one in Romania, the other in Natolia, chief Judges of the army, having
power to reuerse the sentence of the Emperor, if it be against the law of
Mahomet. A second Magistrate (says he) is called Muchti, the chief
interpreter of the law, from whose sentence is no appeal.

Nic. Nicolai Peregrinati. on. lib.3.c.14.
says the same of their two Cadileschers, and that they are chosen out of
their most learned Doctors of their law, and always follow the Court, and with
the consent of the Bassas, constitute and depose the Cadi; having for their
annual stipend seven thousand or eight thousand ducats, besides their
ordinary gains. They have ten Secretaries kept at the Grand Seigniors charge,
and two Moolorbassis, which are busied about the horses: they have also two
hundred or three hundred slaves. They use few words, but such as are of their
law and religion altogether, with very much show of gravity. Arinabene
Alcoran.Ital.
(in his preamble to the Italian Alcoran) makes Cadilescher Kadileskicri ab
Arabibus Casiaskeri d^cti, Iudices sunt supremi, andC. L. Soranz. Otto.
to be a general name to all their orders of Priests. Others do place the
Mufti in the highest place, and the Cadilescher in the second rank: and
perhaps others gave the Cadileseher the first place, because their life was
more in action and government, as attending on the Court, and on the wars: but
the Mufti being highest Interpreter of their law (though without government)
must indeed have preemine^ce. And so Menauino Lib.2.cap.4.
seems to affirm, who, though he places the Cadilescher first, yet says,
that Quando per caso s' appella a sue sententie, si recorre al Mophti
when happily appeal is made from his sentence, they have recourse to the
Mophti. And this opinion is now general and most current, which ascribes to
the Mufti the chief place.

Master Harborn, sometime Embassabor into Turkey for Englands Queen (the worlds
wonder, our Western Hesperus, that shined so far over and beyond all
Christendom, into the East; but my words are too base to usher in that
renowned name) ELIZABETH, thus Lib.Manuscript.
reports. The Turks do hold for head and chief of their religion the Mufti
(the choice of whom is made by the Great Turk himself) such a one as is
known to be wise and learned, and chiefly of a good life. His authority is
so esteemed, that the Emperor will never alter a determination made by him. He
intermedleth in all matters as best him likes, whether they be civil or
criminal, yea, or of State. And yet he has no power to command; but it is in
each man's free liberty, when there happens any doubt of importance, to make
in some few words, by writing, a declaration of his matter in form of a
question: to whom the said Mufti, in a writing likewise (called Zetfa) gives a
brief answer containing his judgment thereon. This Zetfa, brought to the
Judge, is the rule of his sentence; provided, that the declaration, made before
to the Mufti, contained no untruth. Also the Grand Seignior, to show that he is
religious and just, does serve himself of the authority of this Mufti, in
affairs of war and peace demanding his judgment (in manner aforesaid;) by
this course, the subjects being inclined to more forward obedience. But yet the
Mufti will commonly slatter him, and lean to that part, to which he sees him
incline: as in the time of Selim the second, the Mufti having discovered the
Emperors intent to war upon Cyprus, approved the same in his Zetpha. But
after, upon great offers made to Mehemet the Vizier to break that resolution,
the Mufti, by him won to favor the matter, affirmed still, that the war
against Cyprus was good and just, but that his Majesty had a greater
obligation in conscience, which he was bound to take in hand, namely, to
procure the revolt of the Moors in Spain, there oppressed by the Christians,
wherein he was so bold with the Emperor, as to tell him to his face, that if
he did neglect the cause of those Mahumetans, he might be thereunto by his
subjects compelled.

Concerning the Mufti, and other steps of their Hierarchy, Master Knol.
p.1302.
Knolles writes, That the Turks have certain Colleges called Medressae, at
Constantinople, Andrinople, Bursia, and other places, in which they live, and
study their profane Divinity and Law, and have among them nine several
steps or degrees unto the highest dignity.

The first is called Softi, which are young stude^ts. The 2.are Calfi, who are
readers unto the first. The 3. Hogi, writers of books (for they will suffer no
printing) The 4. are Naipi, or young Doctors, which may supply the place of
Iugdes, in their absence. The 5. Caddi. Judges of their law, and Justices to
punish offenders; of which there is one at least in every City through the
Turkish dominion: and are known from other men by their huge Turbants, two
yards in compass. The sixth are Muderisi, which ouersee the Caddies doings,
and are as Suffragans to their Bishops; who are the seventh sort, and are
called Mulli, which place and displace Churchmen at their pleasure. The
eighth, Cadilescari, who are but two great and principal Judges or Cardinals,
the one of Graecia, the other of Natolia: and these two sit every day in the
Diuano among the Bassas and are in great reputation. The ninth is the Muftee,
who is among the Turks, as the Pope among the Roman Catholics. When the
Bassas punish any offense against their law, they send to him. He may not abase
himself to sit in the Diuano, neither when he comes into the presence of the
Grand Seignior, will he vouchsafe to kiss his hand, or to give any more
reverence, then he receives. The great Sultan arises to honor him, when he
comes unto him, and then they both sit down face to face, and so talk and
confer together. No man can ascend to this place, but by the dignities
aforesaid.

Mahomet Page.1161.
the third, forced by a tumult of the Ianizaries to present himself unto them,
came accompanied with the Mufti, and some few others of the reverend Doctors of
their law, who were by the Sultan commanded to sit down, whiles the great
Baslas abode standing. Such respect is had to these men. Thus much Knolles.

In the book Cap.24.
of the Policy of the Turkish Empire, it is said, that the Mufti's authority
is like to that of the Jewish high Priest, or Roman Pope. I rather esteem it
like to that of the twelve Patriarchs, as binding not all Mahumetans, but the
Turks only: whereas the one had, the other challenges a subjection of all,
which profess their religion. That Author also affirms, that whenever the
Mufti goes abroad forth of his own house (which he uses to do very seldom)
his use and custom is, first to go and visit the Emperor: who as soon as
he sees him coming to salute him, and to do him reverence, presently arises
out of his seat, and embracing him with great kindness, entertaineth him very
friendly and lovingly, causing him to sit down by him, and giving him the
honor of the place.

His authority, says L. Soranzo. part.2.cap.61.
Soranzo, is so great, that none will openly contradict the Mufties sentence:
but yet if the Emperor be settled in a resolution, the Mufti with fear or
flattery inclines unto him.

Next to the Mufti is the Cadile scher, Cadilescher.
who being also chosen by the Emperor, may be compared to those, whom the
Christians call Patriarchs, or else to the Primates and Metropolitans of a
Kingdom. Of these there are now in this increased greatness of the Turkish
Empire, three: whereas it seems that they had in the time of Bajazet but one,
and long after (as before is said) but two. To one of these is assigned Europe,
namely, so much thereof as is subject to the Turk, for his Province: To the
second, Natolia or Turkey: to the third, Syria and Egypt, with the parts
adjoining. There were but two Cadileschers, till Selim wanne Syria and Egypt,
and erected a third. But Magin.
Soranzo says, that this third of Cairo is not rightly called Cadilescher, but
should rather be called the great Cadi. Out of all which Provinces, whatsoever
causes come to be determined, by appeal or otherwise, they are brought to be
decided before the Cadilescher of the same Province whence they arise:
notwithstanding that the abode of each of them be continually, or for the most
part, at Constantinople, or elsewhere, wheresoever the Emperor holds his
Court. The honor done to them, is little less then to the Mufti, for that
their authority is over Priest and people, temporal and spiritual: they are
also learned in their law, aged and experienced. Of the Muderisi and Mulli, I
can say no more then I have done.

Next to these are the Cadi, Cadi.
which are sent abroad and dispersed into every City and Town of the Turkish
Empire: which besides their Andr.Ariu.
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction (as I may term it) in forcing men to their
religious observations, are as it were, Iusticers and governors of the places.
So near glued are the Offices and Officers, the religion and polity of the
Turks. There are other which are not sent forth, which are called Choza, that
is, Elders. These, with the Talismans, have the ordering of their parishionall
Churches: the Thalisman calling the people to Prayer, and the Choza executing
the Service and Preaching; and in absence, each supplying others office.
Menavino Modecis.
more distinctly, and in other names, numbreth those Church Officers. The
Modecis is a Governor of an Hospital, receiving and disposing the rents, with
the other customs thereof. Their Schoole-degrees are before spoken of, out of
Knolles. Some Policy of the Turkish Empire. Antippi.
add to these former, these other Priests, of baser condition. The Antippi are
certain Priests which upon Friday (called of them Glumaagun, and is observed
as their Sabbath, because Mahomet was borne on that day) and on other their
fasting and feasting-dayes, after they have used diverse Ceremonies in a
certain place in the midst of the Temple, about thirty steps high, from
thence read unto the people something concerning the life of Mahomet. After
which, two little boys stand up and sing certain Prayers: Which being ended,
the Priest and all the people sing a Psalm with a low voice, and then for
half an hour together they cry Illah illelah, i. there is but one GOD. After
all this, one of those Antippi, out of that high place, shows forth unto the
people a Lance and Scimitar, with exhortation to use their swords and lances
in defense of their Religion. Of the Imam and Meizin Imam. Meizin. Sophi.
is elsewhere showed, that the one calls the people to the Mosche or Meschit,
the other there celebrateth public orisons. The Sophi also are certain
Clerks or Priests, employed in the singing of Psalms and Hymns, after their
manner, in their Churches at the times of public Prayers.

All these inferior orders of Priests are chosen by the people, and have a
certain stipend allowed them by the Emperor, which yet is so small, that many
of them are driven to use either writing of Books, or Handicrafts and Trades
for their living, and are clothed like laymen. They have Bar. Georgievi^z.
no great learning, it is sufficient if they can read the Alcoran; which being
written in Arabian, they are as loath to have translated into the vulgar, as the
Papists are to have the Scripture. He which can interpret, and make some
Exposition of the Text, is of profound learning. Yet are they reverenced: and
if a Turk do strike or offer outrage to them, he loses his hand; and if he
be a Christian, his life; being sure to be burned. Some say, that now of late
some of them are more studious of Astronomy and other Arts. As for those
superior ranks, no doubt may be made of their high account. The Cadelescher
is clothed in Chamlet, Satin, Silk, Damask, or Velvet of seemly color, as
Russet, or Tawnio, and of Purple-coloured Cloth with long sleeves. Their
Tulipan on their head is of marvelous greatness, sharp in the midst, of
Purple or Russet color, deeper and thicker then others; their beards great.
They ride on Geldings, with Purple foot-cloths fringed; and when they go on
foot, they go slowly, representing a stately and sacred gravity.

There is another order of sacred persons, which yet are neither regular nor
secular, by any vow or ordination, but had in that account for their birth,
being supposed to descend of the line of Mahumet. The Turks and Tartarians call
them Seiti or Sithi, the Moors Seriffi. These wear green Tulipans, which
color none else may wear, and that only on their head. Some Christians,
ignorant hereof, have had their apparel cut from their backs, for wearing
somewhat green about them. These they call Hemir. They enjoy many privileges,
especially in giving testimony, wherein one of these is as much as two other,
which they abuse to injury and wrong. The most of them are Moors, which go
ten or fifteen in a company, with a banner on a staff, having a Moon on
the top; and that which is given for GODS sake, they sit and eat in the
street, where also they make their prayers, and are poorly clad. Like to these
(in privilege and prauiledge) are the Chagi or Fagi, which live on alms like
Friars. They attend on the public Prayers, on the holy Relics, on the
Corpses and Funerals of the dead, and to prey on the living by false oaths.

CHAP. XV.
Of the Regions and Religions of ASIA MINOR, since called Natolia and Turkey.

NExt after the Turkish Religion thus related, it seems fittest to discourse
of the ancient names and limits of Regions, and of the former Heathenish
Religions of that part of the Turkish Dominion, which among Authors Haiton.
Maginus. Francisco Thamara, and alij.
has since, in a singular eminency, obtained the name of Turkey. And if it
seem strange, that the Turkish Religion (a newer vpstart) be declared before
those former of the Pagans, the matter we had in hand has thus altered our
method, that after we had described the deformed dis-ioynted lineaments of the
Mother, an Arabian Saracen, her more misshapen Daughter, this Turkish Mopsa,
might attend her hard at her heels. As for the Region, we have followed the
Turkish forces hither: and now that we have glutted our selves with the view
of their later affairs of State and Religion, let us cast our eyes about us,
and observe the Country it self, which because of her long and entire
subjection to this Nation, is styled by their Turcia, and Turcia Mayor.

called it Natolia, (...), because it was the Eastern part of that Empire, as
they called Thracia, the Country about Constantinople (which was named N (...)
P (...)) Romania. This Natolia, or Anatolia, is of others called Asia Minor:
and yet Asia, in most proper and strict account, is peculiarly applied to one
Region in this great Chersonesus, or Peninsula, containing besides, Pontus,
Bithynia, Lycia, Galatia, Pamphilia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and
Armenia Minor. It was bounded on the East with Euphrates (now Frat); on the
South, with the Mediterranean Sea: on the West, with the Archipelago: on the
North, with the Black Sea, stretching in length from 51. to 72. degrees of
Longitude, and in breadth from 36. to 45. This Country has been aunciently
renowned for Arms and Arts: now the This part of Asia has been exceedingly

grave of the carcasses, or some ruinous bones rather and stony Relics of
the carcasses of more then four thousand Places and Cities, sometimes
inhabited. Many changes has it sustained by the Egyptian, Persian,
Macedonian, Roman, Tartarian, and Turkish general Conquests, besides such
exploits as Croesus and Mithridates of old, and the Western Christians of
later times, have therein achieved. Let the studious of these things search
them in their proper Authors: our task is Religion, whose ouer-worne, and
almost out-worne steps, with much curious hunting in many Histories, we have
thus weakly traced. Of the Turks we have already spoken, and we leave the
Christians (for why should we mix Light with Darkness?) to their proper
place. For even yet, besides the Armenians, there remain many Christians of
the Greek Church in Cappadocia, and other parts of this Region.

Next unto those parts of Syria before delivered, are situate in this lesser
Asia, Cilicia, Armenia Minor, and Cappadocia. Cappadocia, called also
Leucosyria, and now Amasia, stretches four hundred and fifty miles along the
Euxine Sea, bounded on the West with Paphlagonia, Galatia, and part of
Pamphylia; on the South, with Cil icia; on the East, with the Hills Antitaurus
and Moschius, and part of Euphrates. Here runs Halys, the end of Croesus
Empire both in the site and fate thereof; the doubtful Oracle here giving him
a certain overthrow. For when he consulted with the same touching his
Expedition against Cyrus, he received answer, That passing Halys, he should
ouer-turne a great State; which he interpreting actiuely of his Attempts
against Cyrus, verified it passiuely in himself. And here, besides other
streams, slideth Thermodon, sometime made famous by the bordering Amazones. Of
which Manly foeminine people, ancient Authors disagree: Theophrastus deriuing
them from the Sauromatoe; Salust fetching them from Tanais; P. Diaconus
describing them in Germany; Trogus and Iustine reporting them Scythians;
Diodorus crossing the Seas to find them in Lybia, and thence also, in a
further search, passing into an Island in the Atlantike Ocean; Ptolomey and
Curtius placing them nearer the Caspian Sea; Strabo Strab l.11.

naming that huge River of them. Goropius confidently avouches them to be the
wives and sons of the Sarmatians or Cimbrians: who, together with their
husbands, invaded Asia. And this he proves by Dutch Etymologies and other
conjectures. Which, if it be true, shows, that their Religion was the same
with the Scythian. They Gram. ex Statio.
are said to have worshipped Mars, of whom they feign themselves to be
descended. Religion it were to speak of their Religion, of whose being we have
no better certainetie. Strabo Strab.l.12.
writes, That in the places ascribed to the Amazones, Apollo was exceedingly
worshipped.

In Cappadocia was seated the City Comana, wherein was a Temple of Bellona,
and a great multitude of such as were there inspired and ravished by deuillish
illusion, and of sacred servants. It was inhabited by the people called
Cataones, who being subject to a King, did nevertheless obey the Priest that
was, in great part, Lord of the Temple, and of the sacred servants, whose
number (when Strabo was there) amounted to six thousand and upwards of men and
women. The Priest received the revenue of the Region next adjoining to the
Temple, and was in honor next to the King in Cappadocia, and commonly of the
same kindred. These idolatrous Rites are supposed to have been brought hither
out of Taurica Scythia by Orestes and his sister Iphigenia, where humane
sacrifices were offered to Diana. Here, at the solemn Feasts of Bellona, those
sacred servants, beforementioned, called Comani, wounded each other in an
extaticall fury; bloody Rites sitting Bellona's solemnities. Solinus.
Argaeus, whose hoarie head was covered continually with Snow, was reputed a

Strabo Strab.l.12.
reports of the Temple of Apollo Catanius, in Dastacum; and of another of
Jupiter in Morimena, which had three thousand of those sacred servants or
religious Votaries, which as an inferior Order were at the command of the
Priest, who received of his Temples revenue fifteen Talents, and was reputed
in the next rank of honor to the Priest of Comana.

Not far hence is Castabala, where was the Temple of Diana Persica
Strab.l.12. Coel.26.6.33.
, where the sacred or devoted women were reported to go barefooted on burning
coals without harm. It is reported Vadiani epit.
, That if a Snake did bite a Cappadocian, the man's blood was poison to the
Snake, and killed him.

Many excellent Worthies has this Region yielded to the world. Mazaca
(afterward of Claudius called Caesarea) was the Episcopal Seat of Great
Basil: Cucusum, the Receptacle of exiled Chrysostom: Amasia (now a
Provincial City of the Turkish Beglerbegs) sometime the Country of Strabo,
to whom these our Relations are so much indebted: Nissa and Nazianzum, of
which, the two Gregory's received their surnames. But that humane and divine
learning is now trampled under the barbarous foot of the Ottoman-horse. Here is
Trapezonde also, whilome bearing the proud name of an Empire. Licaonia, the
chief City whereof is Iconium, celebrated in holy Writ, (and a long time the
Royal Seat of the first Turks in Asia, and since of Caramania, now Conia, or
Cogne, inhabited with Greeks, Turks, Jews, Arabians, and Armenians) is of
Ptolomey adjoined to Cappadocia. And so is Diopolis, called before Cabira,
since Augusta, which Ortelius places in the lesser Armenia: a Region which
has on the South Cilicia; on the East, Euphrates; on the West, Cappadocia.

In Diopolis was the Temple of the Moon had in great veneration, much like, in
the Rites thereof, to that before mentioned of Comana: which although it bare
Comana Cappadociae, and Pontica, Strab.l.12.
the surname of Cappadocia, yet Ptolomey places it in this Armenia; and Comana
Pontica, in Cappadocia, of the same name and superstitious devotion to the same
Goddess. Thence have they taken the pattern of their Temple, of their Rites,
Ceremonies, Diuinations, respect to their Priests. And twice a year, in the
Feasts, which were called, The Goddess her going out, the Priest ware a
Diadem. He was second to none, but the King: which Priesthood was holden of
some of Strabo's progenitors. Pompey bestowed the Priesthood of this Temple
upon Archelaus, and added to the Temples Revenue two Schoeni. that is,
threescore surlongs of ground, commanding the inhabitants to yield him
obedience. He had also power over the sacred servants, which were no less then
six thousand.

Lycomedes after enjoyed that Prelacie, with four Schoeni of land added
thereto: Caesar removed him, placing in his room Ditcutus, the son of
Adiatorix, whom (with his wife and children) he had led in triumph, purposing
to slay his elder son, together with him. But when the younger persuaded the
soldiers, that he was the elder, and both contended which should die, Ditcutus
was of his parents counseled to yield to the younger, and to remain alive, to
be a stay to their family. Which piety Caesar hearing of, grieuing for the
death of the other, he thus rewarded. At the Feasts aforesaid is great recourse
of men and women hither. Many Pilgrims resort to discharge their vows. Great
store of women is there, which for the most part are devoted; this City being
as a little Corinth. For many went to Corinth, in respect of the multitude of
Harlots prostituted or consecrated to Venus.

Zela, another City, has in it the Temple of Anais, much reverenced of the
Armenians; wherein the Rites are solemnized with greatest Sanctimonie, and
Oaths taken of greatest consequence. The sacred Servants and Priestly Honors
are as the former. The Kings did sometime esteem Zela, not as a City, but as
a Temple of the Persian Gods; and the Priest had supreme power of all things,
who with a great multitude of those sacred Servants inhabited the same. The
Romans increased their Revenues.

which under the conduct of Brennus (says Suidas) assembled an Army of three
hundred thousand, and seeking adventures in foraine parts, divided themselves:
some inuading Greece, others Thrace and Asia, where they settled themselves
between Bithynia and Cappadocia. On the South it is confined with Pamphiiia,
and on the North is washed with the Euxine Sea the space of two hundred and
fifty miles. Sinope, the mother and nursing-Citie of Mithridates is here
seated: one of the last Cities of Asia that subjected it self to Turkish
bondage, in the days of Mahomet the second. Of the Galatae were three Tribes,
Trogini, Tolistobogi. and Tectosages; all which Goropius deriueth from the
Cimmerij. At Tavium, which was inhabited with the Trogini, was a brazen Statue
of Jupiter: and his Temple was a privileged Sanctuary. The Tolistobogi had
for their chief Mart Pisinus, wherein was a great Temple of the Mother of the
Gods, whom they called Andigista, had in great veneration; whose Priests had
sometime been mighty. This Temple was magnificently builded of the Attalian
Kings, with the Porches also of white stone. And the Romans, by depriving the
same of the Goddesses Statue (which they sent for to Rome, as they did that of
Aesculapius out of Epidaurus) added much reputation of Religion thereunto. The
Hill Dindyma ouerlooketh the City, of which she was named Dindymena, as of

was fair and noble (the daughter of Diana's Priest) and richly married to
Sinatus the Terrarch. But Sinorix, a man richer and mightier then he, became
his unjust corriuall, and because he durst not attempt violence to her, her
husband living, he slew him. Camma solaced her self as she could, cloystering
her self in Diaena's Temple, and admitting none of her mighty suitors. But
when Sinorix had also moved that suit, she seemed not unwilling: and when he
came to desire her marriage, she went forth to meet him, and with gentle
entertainment brought him into the Temple unto the Altar, where she drank to
him in a cup of poisoned liquor, and having taken off almost half, she reached
him the rest: which after she saw he had drunk, she called upon her husbands
name alowd, saying; Hitherto have I lived sorrowful without thee, waiting this
day, now welcome me unto thee: For I have revenged they slaughter on the most
wicked amongst men, and have been companion and partner with thee in life,
with him in death. And thus died they both. The like manly womanhood (if a

she caused her Gallograecians to cut off his head, which she carried to her

, the sixth King of that name: who loosing his father in the eleventh year of
his age, by his tutors was trecherously assailed, but escaped, and by use of
that antidote, which of him still bears the name Mithridate, out-liued their
poisoning conspiracy. He lived indeed to the death of thousands, which either
his cruelty or his wars consumed. Four years together (to avoid their
Treasons) he lived in the Fields and Woods, under a show of hunting; both
preventing their designs, and inuring himself to hardness. He spoke two and
twenty Languages, being Lord of so many Nations. He held wars with the
Romans six and forty years, whom those renowned Captains, Sylla, Lucullus,
Pompey, did so conquer, as he always rose again with great luster, and with
greater terror: and at last died not by his enemies command, but voluntarily
in his old age, and his own Kingdom, never made to attend the Roman
Triumphs; Sylla's felicity, Lucullus prowess, and Pompeyes greatness
notwithstanding. His aspiring thoughts had greedily swallowed the Sovereignty
both of Asia and Europe. He caused, in one night, all the Romans in his
Dominions to be slain: in which massacre perished a hundred and fifty
thousand, as some have numbered. But it cannot be conceived (says
P.Oros.l.6.c.2.
Orosius) how many there were, or how great was the grief both of the doers
and sufferers, when every one must betray his innocent guests and friends, or
hazard his own life; no Law of Hospitalite, no Religion of Sanctuary, or
reverence of Images being sufficient protection. And no marvel, if he spared
not his enemies, when Cap.5.
he slew Exipodras and Homochares his sons; and after the poysonings and
voluntary death of Monyma his wife, Statira and Roxane, his daughters. His
son Pharnaces (like to taste of the same cup) won to his part his fathers
Army, sent against him, with which he pursued his father so hotely, that he,
having denounced a heavy curse upon him, entered amongst his Wives, Concubines,
and Daughters, and gave them poison, pledging them in the same liquor; which
his body, accustomed to his Antidotes, easily overcame, and therefore was
feign to entreat another to open a bloody passage for that his cruel soul. A
man (says Orosius) of all men most superstitious, always having with him
Philosophers and men expert in all Arts, now threescore and fourteen years
old. The Religion in Pontus was little differing from the Greeks. We read of
the Sacrifices of this King to Ceres, and to Jupiter Bellipotens, in which the
King brought the first wood to the fire. He powered also thereon Honey, Milk,
Wine, Oil, and after made a Feast. In honor of Neptune they drowned
Charriots, drawn with four white Horses, with which (it seemed) they would
have him ease himself in his Sea-voyages. Ortel. in Parerg.Dom. Nig.Asiae

At the mouth of Pontus was the Temple of Jupiter Iasus, called Panopeum: and

They have also a venomous kind of Honey growing out of their Trees, with which
they beguiled and slew three troops of Pompey. The Tibareni observed one
strange fashion, that when the woman was delivered of a child, her husband lay

Phrygia is divided into the greater, which lies Eastward: and the less,
called also Hellespontiaca and Troas, and of some Epictetus. The greater
Phrygia has not many cities. Here stood Midaium, the royal seat of Mydas,
and Apamia the Phrygian Metropolis, Plin.l.5.c.^9.
Phrygia is called of the river Phryx, which divides it from Caria. Herodotus
tells Herodot.l.2.
that the Phrygians were accounted the most ancient of all people: for the
trial whereof, Psammetichus King of Egypt had shut up, without society of any
humane creature, two children, causing only Goats to be admitted to suckle
them, who after long time pronounced be which they had learned of the Goats:
but because that (with the Phrygians) signified bread, therefore they accounted
the Phrygians first authors of mankind. Before Deucalions flood, Nannacus
Suida^.
is reported to reign there, and foreseeing the same to have assembled his
people into the Temple, with supplications and prayers. Hence grew the proverb
to say; A thing was from Nannacus, which was exceeding old. Many antiquities
are told of their Gods: whose Theology thus is recited Eus^de praep^ l.2.4.
by Eusebius. The Phrygians tell, that Meon was the most ancient King of
Phrygia, the father of Cybele, who invented the pipe called Syrinx, and was
named the Mountaine-mother, beloved of Marsyas. But when as Attis had raised
her belly, her father slaying him and his fellows, she, enraged with madness,
ran up and down the country. Marsyas romed with her, who after, being
overcome in a Musical contention of Apollo, was flaied quick. After these
things did Apollo love Cybele, with whom she wandered to the Hyperboreans: and
by his command the body of Attis was buried, and Cybele obtained divine
honors. Hence it is, that even to this day the Phrygians bewail the young man's
death. In Pessinus a City of Phrygia (after reckoned to Galatia) they erected
a Temple to Attis, and Cybele. After the death of Hyperion, the children of
Coelus parted the kingdom amongst them, the most famous of which were Atlas and
Saturn: to the first of which befell the parts adioining to the Ocean. He had
great skill in Astronomy. Of his seven daughters were procreated many of the
Gods and Heroes: and of Maia the eldest, and Jupiter, was Mercury begotten.
Saturn the son of Atlas being covetous and wicked, married Cybele his
Sister, and had by her Jupiter. They tell of another Jupiter, brother of
Coelus, and King of Crete, (but there and here they are so entangled with
Fables, that the least inquiry has most ease and no less certainty.) This
Cretan held the Empire of the world, and had ten sons, whom they call
Curetes: his Sepulcher they show to this day. Saturn (the brother of Atlas)
reigned in Italy and Sicilia, till Jupiter his son dispossessed him, who
proved a severe Prince to the wicked, and bountiful to the good. Thus much
Eusebius of the Phrygian divinity out of their own Legends, the mysteries
whereof he after unfolds. Other tales they had, as, that Minerua killed there
a fire-breathing beast; of Philemon and Baucis: and such like, mentioned by the
Poets Maeander making wars with the Pessinuntians vowed for sacrifice
whatsoever he ^^rst met after he returned with conquest, which he performed on
Archelaus his son, ouercomming, Gramay.
says one, piety with piety. Impious is that piety which destroys
humanity, and devilish cruelty both in the idol and idolater: as appeared
also in the event, (if our story be true) the father rewarding such piety with
greater impiety on himself, and casting himself into the river, left his
name thereunto. The like is told of the rivers Sagaris and Scamander. Hercules,
when he went with the Argonautes to Colchos, came on shore on Phrygia to amend
his oar, and being thirsty sent his sweeting Hylas to the river for water,
who falling therein was drowned, whereupon he (leaving his companions) wondered
in the woods, bemoning his Hylas.

lived in these parts, a man besides other vices exceedingly covetous, not
sparing the Temples of the Gods. Hence arose the Fable that he was punished in
Hell with perpetual hunger and thirst, whiles pleasant waters, and dainty
fruits did offer themselves to his mouth, but when he would have tasted them,
fled from him. So indeed does Mammon torment his followers, making them to want
as well that which they have, as that which they have not, the medicine being
the increaser of the disease, as when fire is quenched with Oil: like Gardners
Asses laden with good herbs, a burden to them, food for others, themselves
glad to feed on Thistles. And how many Tantali do we daily see enduring a
hunger and thirst in the midst of their abundance? a monstrous and unnatural
sickness, to hunger after that which they have, yet cannot, yet will not feed
on; a dropsie-thirst, save that they dare not drink that, which they have and
thirst for. Unworthy of that life, which he sacrifices to that, which never
had the dignity to be mortal: unworthy that body, which he pineth with
plenty; or that soul, which he damneth for a fancy of having; or that nature
of man which he confineth to the Galleys, to the Mines, in the service of a
piece of earth; unworthy of the name of christian, whose CHRIST was, to one of

forefathers, worth thirty pence, but now this will sell him for three half
pence, for a piece of bread, yea, like Aesops dog, for the shadow of a piece of
bread; unworthy of any thing, save that his couetise, to be his tempter, his
tormentor, his fury, his devil: Once, pity it is, that he priseth a halter so
dear, else would he rid the world of a burden, and himself of his worthless
life. But whether has Tantalus carried me? Take heed (reader) he do not carry
thee further, or thou him, beyond words: They say he would have sacrificed his
son Pephilops, had not divine power relieved him: thou art like to find him
Tantalus still. What the Poets tell of Ganymedes every one knows; of Niobe
famous for her sons and daughters, which she lost all in one day: of Mydas
(another Tantalus) whose covetousness became a new Alchymie The Fable was that
Mydas having his wish granted, wished all that he touched might become gold:
and so his meat was gold and starued him.

Alchimist is Master of that Art, which the former profess, that turns so
easily a little Lead into so much good gold: only the wise man, wise in the
later, to be Master of himself and his wealth, not a slave to passion or
pelf. And yet Mydas in a public calamity, (happening by an Earthquake, which
swallowed up houses) warned by an Oracle, to cast into those gaping jaws of
the Earth that which was most precious: hurled therein much treasure (what
could he think more precious: and how much more easily would many a Mydas have
hurled in himself?) But the Earth not yet satisfied would not close up her
mouth, till his son Anchurus, (esteeming man to be most precious) leaped in,
and the reconciled Element received an Altar in witness of his haughty
courage. There were many Phrygian Kings named Mydas.

The Phrygians sacrificed to the Rivers Maeander and Marsias: they placed their

did not swear, or force others to an oath: they were much addicted to

Goropius fetches out of Scythia, and makes him Mydas his Master in

honors.

In Phrygia on the Rivers Sangarius stood Gordie (or as Arrianus Ar.l.2.
calls it, Gordion) of which he reports that when Alexander came thither,
he had a great desire to see the tower, in which was the place of Gordius and
Midas, that he might behold the shafts or became of Gordius his cart, and the
indissoluble knot fastened thereto. For great was the fame thereof amongst the
next adioining people: that Gordius was one of the ancient inhabitants of
Phrygia, having a little place of ground, and two yokes of Oxen, the one he
used to the plough, the other to the waine or Cart. And while he was one day
at plough, an Eagle sat upon the yoke, and there continued till evening.
Gordius, astonished at so ominous a token, went to the Telmissean soothsayers
(for to the Telmissean both men and women this divining science seemed
haereditary) and there met with a Virgin, whom he acquainted with this
accident: she counseled him to return thither and to sacrifice to Jupiter the
King, for the augury was good. Gordius entreated her company with him, that she
might instruct him how to sacrifice, which she granted unto him, and
afterward her self also in Marriage. These had betwixt them Midas, a proper
stripling. Now, a sedition happening among the Phrygians, they consulted with
the oracle, which answered that a Cart should bring them a King, that should
end that sedition. And whiles they were musing on this answer, Midas came
riding in his Cart (with his parents) into the throng, and was by the Phrygians
forthwith acknowledged King. The Carre, in memory hereof, was hanged up to
Jupiter in the tower (or temple of Jupiter, Qu. Curt.l.3.
so Cursius calls it) with thanks for that Eagle ( Jupiters Bird) sent before
to fore-signifie thus much to his Father. The knot fastened unto it, was of the
bark of the Comell or dogge-tree, wouen with such Art that a man could
neither find beginning nor end thereof. Bruted it was amongst the Phrygians,
that he which could untie it should be Lord of all Asia. Alexander turning it
to and fro, and with vain curiosity searching how to loosen it, at last with
his Sword chopped it in sunder least he should otherwise leave some scruple in
the hearts of his Soldiers. Thus far Arrianus.

In the Lesser Phrygia, (of a Hill therein, called Idaea; of a River, Xanthe,
of the Kings, Troas, Dardania, andC.) stood that eye of Asia, and star of the
East, called Ilium or Troy. Of which, all that I can say will but obscure the
renown and glory, which all heathen Antiquity have by an universal consent
of poesy, and history, given to it. And what Greek or Latin Author has not
mentioned her ruins, and done exequies to her funeral? Dardanus is named her
founder, after whom, and his succeeding son Ericthonius, Tros ruled, who
erected the Temple of Pallas, and reedified the City, leaving thereto his
name. To him succeeded Ilus, and after him his son Laomedon, whom Neptune and
Apollo helped in repairing the City: which Hercules sacked, and Priamus
restored, but to a greater loss, by the Graecians ten years siege, and one
nights spoil. Dares, Daret. Dictys Homer. E^^ipid. Virg. Ovid. Horat. S^neca.
Silius. Statius. Claud. etc.
and Dictys, supposed historians of those times, besides Homer, and the Greeks
and Latins his followers, have more then enough related the particulars.
Hesione, Sister to Priamus, was by Hercules given to Telamon for first entering
the walls. Her did Priam demand in vain by Antenor, and Aeneas his
ambassadors. Parts, otherwise called Alexander, one of the fifty children of
Priamus and Hecuba, was sent in the same business, and returned with Helena
the wife of Menelaus a Lacedemonian Prince: who consulting with the other
Grecian Lords for her recovery, first Diomedes and Ulysses were sent to
entreat; after, a thousand sail of ships, to force her restitution: which
after a tedious war, with much loss on the one side, and utter ruin on the
other, was effected. The league of the Greeks was made by Calchas, who
dividing a bore in two parts, caused the Princes with their swords drawn and
besprinkled with blood to pass between, swearing destruction to Priamus and
the Trojans. The like rites of solemn Covenant we read observed by God
Gen.15.15.
himself: and by the Ierem.34.1^.
Jews.

The religion of Phrygia and Troy, and all these Grecian parts of Asia were
little, (if little) differing from the Greek superstitions: of which in our
Europe-discoueries we are to relate. Therefore adiourning a larger discourse
till then, we are a little to mention here their devotions. In Troy were the
Temples of Jupiter Hercens, at whose Altar Priam was slain; of Jupiter
Fulminator, of Juno, Apollo, Minerua, Mercury, Neptune; To Neptune they, which
sailed, did sacrifice a black bull, and oxen, whose hinder parts were burnt,
the inwards they tasted; Rams and Hogs were sacrificed also to him. To
Mercury cloven tongues hurled into the fire; To Venus, on the hill Ida; To
Scamander, to the Nymphs, in Caves. To the dead also they sacrificed black
sheep, over a ditch or hole in the ground, with wine, water, and flower,
thinking that the souls drank the blood. They had whole flocks sacred to the
Gods, untouched by men. They observed Auguries, Thunders, dreams, Oracles of
Apollo and other superstitions. But the most famous of all, their fatal
Palladium, (a Name given to all images which superstition believed not made
with hands) was said to have fallen from heaven at Pessinus, or (as Apollodorus
witnesses) at Ilium, at the prayer of Ilus when he built it. Some Not
Com:^.4.c.5.
say Asius a Philosopher made it by Magical Art: that it moved up and down,
holding in the right hand a iauelin; in the left, a Distaffe. It was three
cubits long. Apollo's Oracle forewarned, that that City should never be
taken, in whose walls it was kept. They hid it therefore in a more secret part
of the Tower, that it should not be publicly known, making many other like
it to deceive all suture deceivers. A womanPriest attended the holy things in
honor thereof, keeping fire continually burning. It was unlawful with common
hands or eyes to touch or see it. And therefore when Ilus saved it from flames,
the Temple being on fire, he was for his blind zeal punished with blindness;
of which, soon after be recovered by divine indulgence: Ulisses stole it from
them. And thus perished that famous Phrygian City, if that may be said to
perish which still continues, far far more famous by Homers pen, then
Priams Scepter or Hectors valor.

The ruins thereof are as yet very apparent (according to Bellonius,
P.Bell.l.2.c.6.
an eye-witnes, his report) the wailes of the city yet standing, the remnants
of her decayed buildings still with a kind of majesty entertaining the
beholder: the walls of large circuit, of great spongie black and hard
stones, cut four square. There are yet to be seen the ruinous monuments of
the Turrets on the walls. They spent four hours sometime on horse, and
sometime on foot, in compassing the walls. Great Marble Tombs of ancient
workmanship are seen without the walls made Chest-fashion: and their couers yet
whole. There are also extant the ruinous shapes of two great Towers; one in the
top of the hill, (On the bending whereof the town stood) the other in the
bottom: and of another in the middle. Many great Cisterns made to receive
raine-water are yet whole. There are the ruins also of Churches built there,
by the sometimes inhabiting Christians. The soil about it is dry and barren:
the rivers (so much chaunted) Xanthus and Simois are small rilles, in Summer
quite dry.

This Ilium (whose sepulcher only Bellonius has seen) is not in that place
where old Ilium stood, but thirty furlongs Eastward, if Strabo Lib.13.
be received, yea it changed the place and situation often, and here at last
abode by warning of the Oracle, which also has now had his Fates as well as
Ilium. A small town was this later Ilium, having in it the Temple of Pallas,
which Alexander in his time graced, enriching the Temple with offerings, and
the place with name of a City, with building and immunitie. After his victory
over the Persians, he sent them a favorable Epistle, with promise to build
them a sumptuous Temple, and there to institute sacred games, which Lysimachus
after his death in great part performed, peopling it from the neighbor Cities.
The Romans also planted there a Colony, when as Lysimachus before had walled it,
and built the Temple. Fimbria, in the wars against Mithridates, having
treacherously slain the Consul Valerius Flaccus, and seeking to enter, upon
denial assailed, it and in the eleventh day entered by force; glorying that he
had done as much in eleven days, as Agamemnon with a thousand sail of
Greeks, had done in ten year; Not so much, replied an Ilian, for Hector was
not here to defend the City. Caesar, aemulous of Alexanders attempts, and
deriuing his pedigree from Iulus, confirmed their former liberty, adding a new
region to their territory.

Achilles among the later Ilians enjoyed a Temple and a Toombe: Patroclus also
and Antiochus had their Tombs: to them all and to Ajax did the Ilians
sacrifice; an honor denied to Hercules for sacking their City: an unjust
quarrel, if this yet may be a just excuse of their partial superstition.
Thymbra is a field hard by, through which slideth Thymbraeus, disemboking it

reports, that Alexander sacrificed to Protefilans, (erecting Altars on his
grave) who was the first of the Graecians that in the Trojan war set foot
in Asia; as he had before in the Straites of Hellespont offered a Bull to
Neptune and the Sea-Nimphes, pouring a golden. Vial into the Sea: and in the
places from whence he set sail, and where he arrived, he set up Altars to
Jupiter Descensor, to Pallas, and to Hercules. And being come to Ilion he
sacrificed to Trojan Pallas, and fastening the arms, which he used, in her
Temple, (a rite which the Philistims I. Sam.31.10.
observed in Saul their enemy, and David I. Sam.21.9.
with the armor of Goliath) he took thence the armor sacred to the

Not far hence is the City and Haven Priapus, so called of the beastly God:
like to Orthanes and Conisalus and Tychon, drunken Gods of the Athenians. This
God or devil (of more iniquity, then antiquity) was not known of Hesiod.
This Region was called, Adrastia Strab.l.13.
of King Adrastus, who first built a temple of Nemesis calling is Adrastia. In
the country adioining was an Oracle of Apollo Actaus, and Diana: whose oratory
being demolished, the stones were carried to Parium, where was built an Altar,
famous for fairness and greatness. Of this Adrastia was a temple at Cyzicus.

This Cyzicus was a City of Mysia minor; (for there is another Mysia called

Apollo. Such was the beauty of the work, and costlinesse of the matter, that
the Earth whether with love seeking to embrace it, or with just hatred for the
idolatrous curiosity, swallowed up both it and the City in an Earthquake. The
like befell to Philadelphia, another Mysian City (one of the seven Churches

the Dodonaean Oracle to recall him; Fit seruitour for such a God. Hence the
tale of his huge Genitalles, and of his Garden-deitie. Offering to ravish a
Virgin at the time of her Wedding, he was scared by the braying of an Ass, a
creature for this cause consecrated to his sacrifices. Lettice most suitable to
such lips.

A little hence stands Abydus; (and over against the same on Europe side,
Sestus) chaunted by the Poets, the guard of the Hellespont, one of the keys
(says Bellonius) of the Turkish Empire; the Castles being for that purpose
well furnished, the Straites not above seven furlongs over. Here did Xerxes
join Asia to Europe by a bridge, professing wars not against the Greeks
alone, but against the elements. To Mount Athos Herodot.l.7.
did this Mount Atheos write his menacing Letters. To the Hellespont he
commanded three hundred stripes to be given, and fetters to be cast, in with:
reuiling speeches for the breach of his new made bridge, which the vvinde
(disdaining the stopping of his passage, and infringing his liberty) had by
tempest broken.

In Mysia Strab.l.13.
was that famous Pine Tree, four and twenty foot in compass, and growing
entire threescore and ten foot from the root, was divided into three arms
aequally distant, which after gathered themselves close into one top, two
hundred foot high, and fifteen cubits. Apollo Cillaus had a Temple dedicated
to him at Cilla; another was erected at Chrysa to Apollo Smynthius: and twenty
furlongs thence, an other to Diana Astirina, another (with a sacred Cave) at
Andira, to the mother of the Gods: this Cave reached under the Earth to Palea,
a hundred and thirty furlongs. Attalus reigned in these parts, who furnished
the Library of Pergamus Pergamus.
with two hundred thousand Volumes, for the writing whereof those
parchment-skinnes were invented, therefore called to this day Pergamenae. Of
this name Attalus were three of their Kings; the last of which made the Romans
his heirs. Here was that cruel Edict of Mithridates published, to murder the
Romans, whereby many, driven to seek help of Aesculapius in his Temple at
Pergamus, found him either unmerciful, or unskillful to cure them, although
his Physicke-shop was in this City. Here were invented (by King Attalus)
Tapestrie hangings, called Aulaea of aula his hall which was hanged therewith.
Here was also a yearly spectacle of the Cock-fight. The Mysian Priests
abstained from flesh and Marriage. They sacrificed a Horse, whose inward parts
were eaten before their vows.

a Lydian King was so addicted to gourmandise, that in the night he did tear
and eat his Wife, and finding her hand (in the morning) in his mouth, the
thing being noised abroad, he killed himself. The same Author tells
Lib.12.c.4.
of King Andramytes, that he made women Eunuchs for his attendance: that the
Lydians were so effeminate, that they might not endure the Sun to look upon
them, for which cause they had their shady bowers: that in a place, therefore
called Impure, they forced women and Maidens to their lust, which Omphale (who
had endured this violence, coming after to be their Queen) revenged by as
unjust justice. For assembling all the servants or slaves, she shut up among
them their Masters Daughters, permitting them to their pleasures. She was
Daughter of Iardanus of the posterity of Attys, who set Hercules his task to
spin amongst her Maids. Her husband Tmolus defloured Arriphe in Dianas Temple.
Of him happily was named the Hill Tmolus, which yielded golden sands to the River
Pactolus. Halyattis Herodot.l.1.
was after a long succession the Lydian King, father to Cresus, whose Sepulcher
was an admirable monument, being at the bottom, stone; elsewhere, earth: built
by men and women, slaves, and hired persons. It is six furlongs in compesse,
and two hundred foot, and a thousand and three hundred foot broad. All the
Daughters of the Lydians prostitute themselves, and thereby get their living
and dowry. These were the first inuenters of coining money: the first hucsters
and pedlers: the first players at Dice, Balls, Chesse, in the time of Attys
the first; driven to this shift by famine, which when they knew not otherwise
to redress, they devised these games, passing the time of every second day
with these pastimes, then beguiling their empty bellies, and (according to
their ominous invention) now not so much the companions, as the harbengers and
forerunners of emptiness, although some contrary to their first original use
them to ease their fullness. Thus did the Lydians live (if Herodotus be
believed) two and twenty years, eating and playing by course, till they were
feign to diminish their multitudes by sending Colonies under Tyrrhenus unto
that part of Italy, Silius l.4.
which of him received that name.

Here on the winding streams of Meander (or nigh thereto) was situate Magnesia
(not that by Hermus) whose Inhabitants worshipped the Dindymene Mother of the
Gods. But the old City and Temple perishing, and a new builded, the Temple
was named of Diana Leucophryna, exceeding that of Ephesus in workmanship, but
exceeded in greatness and multitude of oblations. And yet this was the
greatest in Asia except the Ephesian and Dindymene. Of Tralles a neighboring
City was Metrodorus the Priest of Jupiter Laryssaeus. In the way from thence
Strabo lib. 14.
to Nyssa, is a village of the Nyssaens named Acharaca. There is the Plutonium
(compassed with a grove) and the Temple of Pluto and Juno, and the Cave
Charonium, admirable to the view, ouerhanging the Grove, which it threatens
seeming to devour it. They say that sick men which are devoted to those Gods,
go thither, and in a street near the Cave, stay with such as are expert in
those mysteries, who sleeping for them, inquire the course to cure them, by
dreams. These inuoking divine remedies many times lead them into the Cave,
where abiding many days with fastings and sweatings, they sometimes intend to
their own dreams, by the Counsels of the Priests. To others this place is
pestilent and inaccessible. Here are yearly festiualles solemnized, and then
most of all are these devotions practiced. Youths and striplings naked and
anointed, draw or lead a Bull into the same Cave with great speed, who falls
anon dead. Thirty furlongs beyond Nyssa is a festival place solemnly
frequented by the neighboring Inhabitants, which is said to have a Cave
dedicated to the same Gods, and reaching to Acharaca.

After Omphale, Hercules posterity, which he had by her, reigned; carrying for
their royal Ensign that Battle-axe, which Hercules had taken from Hippolita
the Amazon. Candaules weary of the burden, gave it to one of his Courtiers to
bear, interpreted an ominous presage of that which happened. He thinking it
not enough happiness to enjoy the beauties of his wife, unless some other
eyes were witnesses of his possession, placed Gyges his friend where he might
see unseen (happily the occasion of that Cic^Off.3.
tale of Gyges Ring, wherewith he went invisible) to take view of his wives
nakedness. But being perceived by her at his departure, she put him soon
after to his choice, whether he would enjoy what he had seen, and the kingdom
for dowry, without other ioynture then Candaules blood, or would there
himself be slain. Easieto judge his choice, by which Hercules his race
failed. Of him descended Croesus, whose History is known. Him did Cyrus
overthrow, Herodot.li.1.
and had set him on a pile of wood to burn him, who then cried Solon, Solon,
Solon: which Cyrus not understanding, caused him to be asked, why he so
called. He answered, That sometimes drunken with wealth and pleasure, he
thought himself happy, but then was taught by Solon, not to judge any happy
till his end; which lesson he now learned to his cost: To his good indeed; For
Cyrus for this pardoned his life, now the second time saved: which a little
before a souldior in taking the City had bereaved, had not natural affection
in his son (before this time dumb) violently enforced Nature to loosen the
instruments, of speech and proclaim, It is the King. Thus had the Oracle
prophesied, that the day would be dismal and disastrous to the father, when
the son should speak (whereto he had before in vain sought help of GOD and
men) and could speak freely all his life after. And this was all that Croesus
by his sumptuous Croesus had bin exceeding liberal to. Apollo, who deluded his
Votarie with riddles, as in our Persian relation you may read.
presents, and superstitious devotion could get of Apollo, which had foretold
him, that he himself had no power to auert or alter, not to speak of his
enigmaticall answers, snares, not instructions, nocuments, not documents unto
him.

CHAP. XVII.
Of Ionia and other Countries in that Chersonesus.

IOnia is situate on the Icarian Sea, ouer-against the Island Chios. The
Inhabitants are accounted Athenian Colonies (whereas Athens may rather seem to
be Ionian) deducing their name from Coelius Rhod. lib.7.10. Sard.lib.3.
Ion the son of Creusa and Xuthus. But more probable is Ar.Montan. Fr. Iunius
etc.
their opinion which derive them from Iavan, as is Lib.I.ca.8
before observed by us. Of the Ionians in Asia, were reckoned ten principal
Cities in the continent, Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon. Lebedus,
Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea, Erythraea, besides Chios and Samos in the Islands, to
which they imparted their names.

The Ionians had their common Sacrifices and Ceremonies at the Promontorie of
Mycale, generally by all the Ionians dedicated to Neptune Heliconius, erecting
there unto him a Temple: the place was called Panionium, and the feast in which
those sacrifices were offered, Panionia. To those twelve Cities Strabo Strabo
lib.14.
mentioning the founders of them, adds also Smyrna, and says that they were
called to the Panionian solemnities by the Ephesians, who were sometime called
Smyrnaeans of Smyrna the Amazon, who is named the Founder of Ephesus. Against
those Smyrnaeans the Sardians warred; and would on no condition raise their
siege, except the Smyrnaean matrons were permitted to their lusts. Gramay.
The Maid-seruant of one Philarchus amongst them devised, that those of her
condition might in their Mistresses habit be sent, to save their Masters
beds, which was accomplished.

As for Ephesus, the place was designed by Oracle for the building thereof,
which warned them there to build, where a Fish and a Bore should show them. It
happened, that as certain Fishermen at the sacred fountain Hypeleus were
broyling their fish, one of them leaped with the coals into an heap of
straw, which thereby was fired; and a Bore which lay covered therein, leaping
out, ran from thence as far as Trachea, and there fell down dead of a
wound which they gave him, grunting out his last gasp where Pallas after was
honored with a Temple. Greater then Pallas and her swinish devotion was that
Act.19.27,28
Great Diana of the Ephesians, (so proclaimed in the madness of their zeal)
and that Image which came down from Jupiter, which all Asia and the world
worshipped. This Image (as Plinse Pli.li.19.c.40.
writes) was thought by some to be of Ebonie, but Mutianus thrice consul,
writ, That it was of the Vine, never changed in seven alterations or
restitutions, which the Temple received. It had many holes filled with
Spikenard, the moisture whereof might fill and close up the rifts. The doors
of the Temple were of Cypress, Solinus c.49.
which after four hundred years were as fresh as if they had been new. The
roof of the Temple was Cedar. The Image, which superstition supposed came from
Jupiter, was made (says the same Mutianus) by one Canetia. The Temple (reputed
one of the worlds seven wonders) was first the building of the Amazons, as
Solinus affirms. Pausanias l. 7
But Pausaniask reproves Pindarus, for affirming that the Amazons had built
it, when they made their Expedition against Theseus and the Athenians: For at
that time (says he) the women going from Thermodon, sacrificed to the Ephesian
Diana in their way, as they had done before in the times of Hercules and of
Bacchus. Not the Amazons therefore, but one Croesus of that Country, and
Ephesus (supposed the son of the river Cayster) founded it. Of him the City
also received her name. About the Temple dwelt both diverse other suppliants,
and women of the Amazonian race. These were spared by Androclus the son of
Codrus, who here planted his Athenian Colony, and chased out the Leleges, which
before were the Inhabitants; who being slain in this Expedition, his sepulcher
remained in Pausanias his time, on which was set a man armed. Xerxes when he
burned all other Temples in Asia, spared this, uncertain whether for
admiration or devotion; most certain, a bootlesse clemency. For Herostratus

, to lengthen the memory of his name with detestation of his wickedness,
fired this Temple on that day in which Alexander was borne at Pella. Diana
forsooth, (who in her Midwife-Mysterie is called also Juno Lucina) in her
officious care to help Olympias in her travel, was then absent. It was after
restored to a greater excellency by Dinocrates, or (as Strabo terms him)
Chermocrates, who was also the Architect of Alexandria. Some N Perot.
Cornucopiae. Munst.Cosm.l.5 Plm.li. 16.ca.40
affirm, That two hundred and twenty years were spent, in building this
Temple, by all Asia: Pliny says, four hundred. It was built on a Marish,
because of Earthquakes (which are said to be more common in Asia then other
parts) being founded on Coals, the second foundation Woo'l. There were therein
an hundred twenty seven Pillars, the works of so many Kings, threescore foot
in height, and six and thirty of them very curiously wrought. The Temple was
four hundred twenty five foot long, two hundred and twenty broad; of the
Ephesians holden in such veneration, that when Croesus had begirt them with a
straight siege, Herodot.lib.1
they devoted their City to their Goddess, tying the wall thereof with a rope
to the Temple. It was enriched and adorned with gifts beyond value. It was full
of the works of Praxiteles and Thraso.

The Priests were Eunuchs Strabo lib.14
called Megalobyzi, greatly honored, and had with them sacred Virgins. Some
Gramay.Ionic.
call these or else another order of Diana's Priests, Estiatores and Essenae,
that is, Good fellows (after the appellation of this bad Age) which by yearly
courses had a peculiar diet assigned them, and came in no private house. All
the Ionians resorted to Ephesus, Thucid.lib.3.
at Diana's festival, which with daunces and other pomp they solemnized, with
their wives and children, as they had done before at Delos: The Temple had
privilege of Sanctuary, which Alexander extended to a furlong, Mithridates to
a flight-shot, Antonius added part of the City: But Augustus disanulled the
same, that it should no longer be a harbor for villains. This the Romans
find (says a Roman Pope relating this History) among whom are so many
sanctuaries, as Cardinals houses, in which thieves and ruffians have
patronage, which make the city (otherwise quiet and noble) a den of thieves.
Pius secundut Asia,
A lake named Selinusius, and another which flows into it, were Diana's
patrimony, which by some Kings being taken from her, were after by the Romans
restored. And when the Publicans had seized the profits, Artemidorus was sent
in Embassage to Rome, where he recovered them to Diana, for which cause they
dedicated to him a golden Image in the Temple. In the mids of the lake was
the Kings Chapel, accounted the work of Agamemnon. Alexander Arrian.lib. 1
not only restored the Ephesians to their City, which for his sake they had
lost, and changed the government into a popular state, but bestowed also the
tributes, which before they had paid to the Persians, upon Diana, and caused
them to be slain which had robbed the Temple, and had overthrown the Image of
Philip his father therein, and such of them as had taken Sanctuary in the
Temple he caused to be fetched out and stoned. While he stayed at Ephesus, he
sacrificed to Diana with very solemn pomp, all his army being arranged in
battle array.

The Ephesians were obseruers of curious Arts, which not only Luke mentions
Acts 19.19
, but the proverb also confirms Suidas.
, Ephesiaeliterae: so they called the spelles, whereby they made themselves in
wrestling, and other conflicts, invincible. Memorable is the history of an
Ephesian maid, Caelius lectantiq. li. 8.c.13.
who, when Brennus invaded Asia, promised him her love, (which he much desired)
and withal, to betray the city to him, if he would give her all the Jewels and
attire of the women: which the soldiers were commanded to do, who heaped
their gold so fast upon the Damsel, according to their command, that she was
therewith covered and slain. The Afiarchae, which Luke names Acts 19. Beza
Beza anno^at.
says were certain Priests, whose office it was, to set forth public plays
and games in honor of their Gods; as also were the Syriarchae. The Ephesians,
Athenaeus lib. 12.9
as all the other Ionians, were much addicted to niceness and sumptuousness
of attire, for which, and other their delicacies, they grew into a proverb.

The Ionians had other places and temples amongst them famous for devotion, and
antiquity, such as no where else are to be seen, as the Temple and Oracle of
Apollo at Gemini Pausan. Achaica.live.7.
Myus had a small arm of the Sea, whose waters by the means of Meander
failing, the soil brought forth an innumerable multitude of fleas, which
forced the Inhabitants to forsake their City, and with bag and baggage to
depart to Miletus. And in my time (says Pausanias) nothing remained of Myus,
in Myus, but Bacchus Temple. The like befell to the Atarmita near to Pergamus.
The Persians burnt the Temple of Pallas at Phocea, and an other of Juno in
Samos, the remains whereof are worthy admiration: the Erythraean Temple of
Hercules, and of Pallas at Prienae; that for the antiquity, this for the
Image. The Image of Hercules is said to be brought in a ship which came
(without man's help) to the Cape, where the Chians and Erythraeans labored each
to bring the same to their own City. But one Phormio a Fisherman of Erythraea
was warned in a dreams, to make a rope of the hair cut off from the heads of
the Erythraean Matrons, by which their husbands should draw the same into their
town. The women would not yield; but certain Thracian women which had
obtained their freedom, granted their hair to this purpose, to whom
therefore this privilege was granted, to enter into Hercules Temple, a thing
denied to all other the Dames of Erythraea. The rope still remains: and the
Fisherman which before was blind, recovered his sight. In this Town also is
Mineruaes Temple, and therein a huge Image of wood, sitting on a throne,
holding with both hands a distasse. There are the Graces, and Hours, formed of
white Marble. At Smyrna was the Temple of Aesculapius: and, nigh to the springs
of their river Meles, a cave, in which they say Homer composed his Poems. Thus
much Pausanias. The Ionian Scaliger in Eusebius. chron. animad.
letters were more resembling the Latin, then the present Greek are, and were
then common, as in our first Book is showed in our Phoenician relations.

At Miletus, a mad frenzy had once possessed their Virgins, whereby it came
to pass, that they in great multitudes hanged themselves. Neither cause
appeared, nor remedy: Needs must they go whom the Devil drives. Whom
Polyaen.lib.3. stratagem.
neither the sweetness of life, bitterness of death, tears, entreaties,
offers, custody of friends could move, Modesty detained from proceeding in
this immodest butchery: and which is more to be wondered at, a Posthume
modesty, which could not be borne, till they were dead. For a Law was made,
That the naked bodies of such as thus had strangled themselves, should be
drawn through the streets: which contumely, though it were but a Gnat to
those Camels, which with the halter they swallowed, yet strained they at it,
and it could it not be digested, but stayed their fury. Before the Trojan war,
was Hercules famous at Miletus. The Ionians were subject to the Assyrians:
after that to the Egyptians: next to the Lydians, Persians, and the other
Empires, which successively followed.

From Ephesus to Colophon are seventy furlongs. This town grew into a Proverb;
Colophonem addere Eras.Ad.
for through their excellency in horsemanship they usually made the victory
(otherwise doubtful) to be certain on that side which entertained them.
Before Colophon was the grove of Apollo Clarius. And here died Calchas that
famous wizard for grief, that when upon his demand Mopsus had certainly
answered how many pigges were in the belly of a Sow, by him propounded: Calchas
could not do the like, when Mopsus asked of the number of figs growing on a
fig tree thereby.

Not far from hence is Erythrae the town of one of the Sybyls, which lived
in the time of Alexander, of which name also there were others in other places
and times, renowned for their prophecyings. Beyond Clazomenae is the Temple of
Apollo, and Smyrna famous in those blind times, for the temple and statue of
Homer, since for the Prelacie of Polycarpus, whom our LORD himself so highly
commends. Apocal.2.9
Neleus builded Miletus (who also erected the Altar at Possidium) The Milesian
Oracle was sacred to Apollo Didymaeus amongst the Branchidae, who betrayed the
treasures of their God to Xerxes the burner of their temple; and therefore for
fear of punishment followed him after in his flight. Afterward the Milesians
builded a Temple, which for the exceeding greatness remained without roof,
compassed with dwelling-houses, and a grove, adorned sumptuously with gifts of
ancient workmanship. Here was the legend framed of Branchus and Apollo, whom
they called Vlios, and Artemis, of healing. Near unto the temple of Neptune at
Possidium was Heraeum, an old Temple and Oratory, after converted into a
storehouse, but then also retaining diverse chapels full of old works, as was
also a Courtyard without, from whence when Antonius had taken three colosses
(the work of Miro) standing on one basis, Augustus placed there again, Pallas
and Hercules but translated Jupiter to the Capitol, and built him a Chapel.

Solmissus is not far hence, where the Curetes or Priests of Jupiter dulled
the ears of Juno with the sound of weapons whiles Latona was delivered. Here
were many temples, some old, some new. The Dict, hist.
Curetes or Corybantes, for so they were also termed, were a shaven order of
Priests, who, ravished with a sacred fury, played upon cimballs, and danced,
shaking their heads to and fro, drawing others into the same rage of
superstition. These first began their devotions at Ida, a hill of Phrygia,
and after sailed into Creet, and here with their furious sounds they delivered
Jupiter from Saturnes: gullet (who had before couenanted with Titan to kill all
his male children) while he could not by means of their noise hear Jupiters
crying. Diodorus Siculus writes, That Corybantus was the son of Jason and
Cybele, and with Dardanus brought into Phrygia the rites of the mother of the
gods, and called his disciples in that sect Corybantes. Natalis Comes Not. Co.
libr. 9, cap.7.
trauerseth many opinions about their original and rites; their daunces were
in armor.

The region of the Dorians was almost rounded with the Sea: Heerin was Gnidus a
City of name for the marble Image of Venus: and Halycarnassus, the Country
of Herodotus and Dionysius famous Historians, and of Mausolus, whose Sepulcher,
erected by Artemifia his wife and sister, was accounted one of the worlds
seven wonders.

In the Suburbs of Stomalymne was the Temple of Aesculapius of great
reputation, and riches. In it was Antigonus of Apelles workmanship: there was
also Venus naked, after dedicated to Caesar at Rome, as the mother of that
generation, by Augustus.

Near to Eargolia was a Temple of Diana. Mylasa another City of Caria had many
public buildings and fair Temples; among the rest, two of Jupiter (surnamed
Osogo) in the one; and in the other, Labrandenus, of Labranda a village, a
little off, which had an ancient Temple of Jupiter Militaris much frequented.
The way leading thither was called Sacred, paued sixty furlongs, through which
their Procession passed in pompous solemnity. The noblest of the citizens were
ordained Priests, which function dured with their lives.

There is a third Temple of Jupiter Carius common to all the Carians, of which
also the Lydians and Mysians are partakers. Strabo reports Libr. 24.
of two Temples at Stratonica; one at Lagina, sacred to Hecate, where were
celebrated yearly solemnities; the other near the City of Jupiter Chrysaorcus
common to all the Carians, whither they resort to sacrifice, and to consult of
common affairs: which their assembly is called Chrysaorean.

Lydia, called also Maeonia, was a rich Country, whose mother-Citie was Sardis,
the royal seatof Croesus, washed by golden Pactolus, where idleness was a
special fault, and punished by the Law. Five miles from this City is a lake
called Colous, where is the temple of Diana Coloena very religiously accounted
of, wherein, on their festiuals, Apes were reported to dance. The region,
called Burned, stretches it self here about the space of five hundred
furlongs, mountainous, stony and black, as if it were of some burning, wanting
trees altogether (Vines excepted) which yield a very pleasant wine. Here was an
other Plutonium at Hierapolis ouer-against Laodicea. It was a hole in the brow
of a hill, so framed, that it might receive the body of a man, of great depth.
Below it was a squared trench of half an acre compass so cloudie and dark,
that the ground could scarcely be seen. The air is not hurtful to them which
approach: but within it is deadly. Strabo Aelian. libr.4. Strabo lib.13
put in Sparrowes, which presently died. But the gelded Priests called Galli
might approach to the mouth and look in, and diue in as long as they could
hold their breath, without harm, but not without fignes of working passions,
whether of divine inspiration or reluctation of the natural forces. No less
marvelous then the dampe of the air, is the hardening quality of the waters;
which being hot, do harden themselves into a kind of stone. As strange is
that which is reported of the water of the lake Tatta, that if a rope be drawn
through it, or a bird touches it with her wings they are kerned with salt.
Warner mentions the like in Hungary, and Acosta, in Peru. Those Galli here
mentioned were Priests of Cybele, so called of Gallus a river in Phrygia,
Wern.de aquis Hungariae.
the waters whereof, temperatly drunken, did exceedingly temper the brain, and
take away madness; but being sucked in largely, caused madness. These Priests
drinking hereof unto madness, in that fury gelded themselves. And as their
beginning, so was their proceeding also in madness, in the execution of their
rites, shaking and wheeling their heads like mad men. Volateran Volat. l.10.
out of Polyhistor reports, that one Gallus the companion of Attys (both
gelded) imposed this name on the river, before called Teria. Of Cybele and
Attys we have spoken before: I add, that after some, this Attys was a Phrygian
youth, which when he would not listen to Rhea in her amorous suits, gelded
himself; so consecrating his priesthood unto Rhea or Cybele: others Not. Com.

and Adonis, to the Sun and Earth in the Winter. Cybele is drawn with lions,
which signifies the influence of the heavens. Attinis they purtrayed with his
rod, the mark of his power, and a pipe, noting the Winds caused by the
Sun. Their mourning ended on the eight Calends of April: the first day, in
which the Sun makes the day longer then the night, they solemnised the feast
called Hilaria. See li.1.c. 7 de Phaen.
he dismembered himself, and would also have killed himself, but that by the
compassionate Goddess he was turned into a Pine Tree. That the Fable! this the
History! that these gelded Priests wore also long womanish attire, played on
tymbrelles and cornets, sacrificed to their Goddess the ninth day of the
Moon; at which time they set the Image of the Goddess on an ass, and went
about the villages and streets begging, with the sound of their sacred
tymbrell, corn, bread, drink, and all necessaries, in honor of their
Goddess: as they did also in the Temples, begging money in her name, with some
musical instruments; and were therefore called Matragyrtae. Thus did the
Priests of Corona also beg for the maintenance of their Goddess, with
promises of good fortune to their liberal contributors. Lucian in his Asinus
relates the like knaueries of the Priests of Dea Syria.

But it is high time to leave this (properly called) Asia, and to visit Lycia,
washed by the Sea two hundred miles, wherein the mount Taurus arises, hence
stretching it self Eastward, under diverse appellations, unto the Indian Sea.
They were governed by common Counsel of three and twenty Cities, till the
Romans subdued them. Here was Cragus a hill with eight Promontories, and a
City of the same name, from whence arose the Fables of Chymaera. At the foot
of the hill stood Pinara, wherein was worshipped Pandarus: and a little thence
the Temple of Latona; and not far off, Patara, the work of Patarus,
beautified with a haven, and many Temples and the Oracles of Apollo. The hill
Telmessus was here famous for Soothsayings; and the Inhabitants are accounted
the first interpreters of Dreams. Here was Chimaera a hill said to burn in
the night. Pamphylia bears Eastwards from Lycia, and now together with
Cilicia of the Turks is called Caramania. Herein was Perga, near whereunto on
a high place stood the temple of Diana Pergaea, where were observed yearly
Festiualls. Sida had also in it the temple of Pallas. There remain of this
Chersonessus, Dom. Niger.
Armenia minor, and Cilicia. Armenia minor, called also Prima, is divided from
the Greater, or Turcomania by Euphrates on the East: it has on the West
Cappadocia; on the South Cilicia, and part of Syria; on the North the Pontike
nations. It was sometimes reckoned a part of Cappadocia, till the Armenians by
their invasions and colonies altered the name: As for their rites I find little
difference, but they either resemble the Cappadocians, or their Armenian
ancestors.

Cilicia abutteth on the Eastern borders of Pamphilia, and was divided into
Trachea, and Campestris; now has in it few people, many great Mesquitaes, and
well furnished: the chief City is Hamsa Strabo lib.14.
sometime called Tarsus, famous for the studies of learning, herein (says
Strabo) surmounting both Athens and Alexandria; but most most famous for
yielding him to the world, then whom the whole world has not happily yielded
any more excellent that was merely a man, that great Doctor of Nations, who
filled these Countries and all Regions, from Jerusalem even to Illyricum (now
full of barbarism) by preaching, and still fills the world by his writings,
with that truth which he learned, not of man, nor at Tarsus the greatest
School of humanity, nor at Jerusalem the most frequented for Divinity, but
of the Spirit of truth himself: who both was at first from Heaven converted,
and after in the third Heaven confirmed in the same.

Strabo mentions the Temple and Oracle of Diana Sarpedonia in Cilicia; where
being inspired, they gave answers: The Temple of Jupiter also at Olbus, the
work of Ajax. From Anchiale, a Cilician City, Alexander passed to Solos,
where he sacrificed with praises to Aesculapius for recovery from a strong
Fever, gotten before in the waters of Cidnus, and celebrated Gymnicall and
Musical Ar.lib. 2.
Games. The Corycian and Triphonian Dens or Caves were held in much
veneration among the Cilicians, where they sacrificed with certain Rites: They
had their divination by Birds and Gramay.
Oracles.

Unto these things which have been said of the Temples, Priests, and Rites,
observed in Asia, thus much may be added out of Sardus L.3.c.15.
, of their Sacrifices. The Phrygians sacrificed Swines blood. This did the
Galli, Priests of Cybele, and this did the Bedlem Votaries, to recover of their
madness. The Colophonians offered a dog to Enodia, which is Hecate, as did
also the Carians to Mars. The Phaselites in Pamphilia sacrificed fishes to
Caber, the son of Vulcan; and the Lydians, Eeles to Neptune. The Cappadocian
Kings in their Sacrifices to Jupiter Stratioticus, or Militaris, on a high
Hill, built a great fire, the King and others bringing wood thereto: and after
that another lesser, which the King sprinkled with Milk and Honey, and after
fired it, entertaining those which were present with good cheer.

tells of diuinations used in some parts of Lycia: betwixt Myra and Phellus
there was a fountain full of fishes, by whose form, nature, motion, and
feeding the inhabitants used divination. The same Lycians, in the grove of
Apollo, not far from the Sea, had a dry ditch, called Dina, in which the
Diuiner put in fishes, and ten gobbets of roasted flesh, fastened on spits,
with certain prayers: after which, the dry ditch became full of water and
fishes of all kinds and forms, by which the Priests observed their
Praedictions. And not far from hence, at Myrae in Lycia, was the fountain of
Apollo Curious, where the fishes being three times called with a Pipe, assembled
themselves, and if they devoured the meats given them, it was interpreted a
good bode and happy presage: if they struck away the same with their tails,
it was direful and dreadful. At Hierapolis in Lycia, the fishes in the Lake
of Venus being called by the Temple-keepers, presented themselves, enduring to
be scratched, gilled, and men's hands to be put in their mouths. They diuined by
lots six months of the year together, at Patara in Lycia, in Apollo's
Temple. But Saturn has swallowed his own children; and Time, which brought
forth these, both Gods and Religions, has also consumed them, not leaving any
such memorial of them as might satisfy any curious searcher: yet in relation
of the Greekish Rites (from which these, for the most part, have not much
swarued) you may expect a more full and ample Discourse. It is now time at last
to rest our weary limbs: enough and more has the Pilgrim told you of the
Arabian Deserts, of the Monster Mahomet, and his Vicars the Calipha's Calipha

AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS.
THE FOVRTH BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Of ARMENIA MAYOR, and GEORGIA: and the neighboring Nations.

HItherto we have proceeded slowly in the discovery of a part of Asia;
sometime the store, sometimes the want, of convenient matter, detaining our
pen: In the one, Time, the consumer of things, causing much time and pains
to be spent in curious search, that we might produce some light out of
darkness: In the other, store of Stories, and variety of varying Authors has
dimmed our weaker eyes with too much light, uncertain, in so many Tracts and
Tractats, where to begin, and when to end. Now at last are we passed
Euphrates, into a Country that often exalts it self, as though it would
pierce the Skies, and as often receives the due punishment of ambitious pride,
being cast down into so many lowly valleys and dejected bottomes. The World,
which after the Flood was repeopled from hence, still carries in the several
Ages, Places. Peoples, and Men thereof, the resemblance of this her Cradle, now
up, now down, in all variety and vicissitude of chance and change, constant
in inconstancy, treading this Armenian Measure with unequal paces, over Hills
and Dales, like it self only in unlikeness. Here Noah's Ark settled, and here
must our Ship hoyse sail.

Armenia has a part of Cappadocia and Euphrates on the West; Mesopotamia on
the South; on the North part, Colchis, Iberia, Albania; on the East, the
Caspian Sea, and Media. Part of this greater Armenia is now called Turcomania,
the other part is contained in Georgia. Ptolomey Ptol.l.5.c.13.
reckons in it principal Mountains, the Moschici, Paryarges, or Patiedri,
Vdacespes, Antitaurus, Abos, and the Iun.in Annos. Gen.8.
Gordaei, which the Chaldaean Paraphrast calls Kardu, and Q. Curtius,
Cordaei; Berosus, Cordyaei.

On these Hills the Arc rested, whereof we have spoken in the first book.
Haithonus, or Antonius. Armenius.
Haithon (if we believe him of his own Country, where he was of royal
lineage) calls this Mountain Arath, little differing from the
Scripture-appellation Ararat, and adds, That although, in regard of abundance
of Snow, always possessing the top thereof, none be able to go up thither,
yet there always appears in the top a certain black thing, which the
vulgar people esteem to be the Arc.

Armenia (as Strabo Lib. 11.
affirms) received the name of one of Iasons Companions, which followed him
in his Navigations out of Harmenia, a City of Thessalie, between Pherae and
Larissa. The wealth of this Region appeared, when Ptolomey appointed Tigranes
to bring in to the Romans six thousand Talents of Silver, he added
voluntarily, beyond that sum, to every souldior in the Camp fifty drammes
of Silver, to every Centurion a thousand, to every Deputy of a Country, and
Chiliarche, a Talent.

Their Religion must at first be that which Noah and his Family professed;
after by time corrupted. Here ( Pseudo Berosus, lib.3.
says our Berosus) Noah instructed his posterity in divine and humane
Sciences, and committed many natural secrets unto writing, which the Scythian
Armenians commend to their Priests only; none else being suffered to see, or
read, or teach them. He left also Rituall Books, or Ceremonial, of the which
he was termed Saga, i. Priest, or Bishop. He taught them also Astronomy, and
the distinction of years and months: For which, they esteemed him partaker of
divine Nature, and surnamed him Olybama and Arsa, that is, the Heaven and the
Sun, and dedicated to him many Cities; some (says he) remaining at this day,
which bear these names. And when he went from thence to govern Cytim, which
now (as he affirms) they call Italy, the Armenians were much affected to
him, and after his death accounted him the Soul of the heavenly bodies, and
bestowed on him divine honors.

Thus Armenia, where he began, and Italy, where he ended, do worship him, and
ascribe to him Names, Heaven, Sun, Chaos, the Seed of the World, the Father
of the greater and less Gods, the Soul of the World, moving Heaven, and the
Creatures, and Man; the God of Peace, Justice, Holiness, putting away hurtful
things, and preserving good. And for this cause both Nations signify him in
their writings with the course of the Sun, and motion of the Moon, and a
Scepter of Dominion, persecuting and chasing away the wicked from among the
society of men, and with the chastity of the body, and sanctimonie of the
mind, the two keys of Religion and Happiness. They called also The wife of
Noah.
Tidea, the mother of all, after her death, Aretia, that is, the Earth, and
Esta, i. the Fire, because she had been Queen of the Holy Rites, and had
taught maidens to keep the holy everlasting fire from ever going out.

Noah, before he went out of Armenia, had taught men Husbandry, more aiming at
Religion and Manners then Wealth and Dainties, which provoke to unlawful
things, and had lately procured the wrath of GOD. And first of all men he
found out and planted Vines, and was therefore called Ianus, which to the
Aramaeans sounds as much as the author of Wine. Thus far Berosus, lib. 3.
and in the fourth book he adds, That Nymbrot (the first Saturn of Babylon)
with his son Jupiter Belus, stole away those Rituall or Ceremonial books of
Jupiter Sagus, and came with his people into the Land Sennaar, where he
appointed a City, and laid the foundation of a great Tower a hundred one and
thirty years after the Flood; but neither finished this, nor founded the
other. Old Ianus when he went hence, left Scytha, with his mother Araxa, and
some inhabitants, to people Armenia, being the first King thereof; Sabatius
Saga being consecrated High Priest, from Armenia unto the Bactrians: all which
space (says he) in our Age is called Scythia Saga. In his fifth book he
reports, That Jupiter Belus, possessed with ambition of subduing the whole
World, closely endeavored to make (or take) away Sabatius Saga, who, being not
able otherwise to escape his treachery, sledde away secretly. But Ninus, the
son of Belus, pursuing his fathers intent against Sabatius who substituted
his son Barzanes in his place, and fled into Sarmatia, and after from thence
into Italy, to his father Ianus. Barzanes was subdued by Ninus. But to come to
an Author of better credit, Strab. l. 11.
Strabo says, The Armenians and Medes have in veneration all the Temples of
the Persians, but the Armenians especially esteem the Temples of Tanais an
Armenion Goddess. Some term her Anaitts.
Tanais as erecting them in other places, so in Acilesina. They dedicate unto
them men-seruants and women-seruants: the most noble of that Nation there
(dedicating shall I say? or) prostituting their daughters: where after long
prostitution with their Goddess, they are given in marriage; none resusing
such matches. How much can the shadow, how little can the substance of Religion
persuade men to? The Image of Tanais, or Anaitis, was set up in her Temple, all
of solid Gold; and when as Antonius warred against the Parthians, this Temple
was robbed. The fame Coel.Rb^dig. l. 18. c.29.
went, That he which first had laid sacrilegious hands on the spoils, was
smitten blind, and so diseased, that he died thereof. But when Augustus, being
entertained of an ancient warrior at Bononia, asked him of the truth of this
report, he answered, Thou now, O Emperor, drinkest that blood; for I am the
man, and whatsoever I have, came by that booty. This Goddess is supposed to
be the same with Diana. A Region of Armenia bare the same name, Anaitis.

How bloody Rites the Armenians sometimes used, appears Gramaye Armen.
by the History of the River Araxes, before called Halmus, borrowing this
later name of a King there reigning; to whom, in wars betwixt him and the
Persians, the Oracle prescribed the sacrifice of his two fair daughters.
Piety forbad what piety commanded; and whiles the King would be an Vmpire
between Nature and the Oracle (which is the usual event in arbitrements) he
satisfied neither. That the Oracle might be fulfilled, he sacrificed two of
noble birth, of notable beauty: That Nature might not be wronged, he wronged
Justice (the true touchstone of true piety) he spared his own, and offered
the daughters of Miesalcus but so he lost both his daughters by Miesalcus
revenging sword, and himself in this River by himself drowned. Bacchus loved
Alphoesibaea, an Armenian Damsel, and while Tygris, then (if you believe the
Story) called Sollax, was too cool a mediator between the two hot lovers, he
swamme over on a Tigers back. Hence the fable of his Metamorphosis into a
Tygre: hence that name left to the River. Armenia was subdued to the Persians
by Cyrus: One part thereof paid to the Persians twenty thousand Colts for
yearly tribute. Valor. Max: l.9. c.11.
Sariaster, son to Tigranes the Armenian King, conspired against his father:
the conspirators sealed their bloody faith with a bloody ceremony; they let
themselves blood in the right hands, and then drank it. Wonder, that in such a
treachery (as immediately before the same Author affirms of Muhridates his
son) that any man would help, or that he durst importune the Gods: no
wonder, that so bloody a seal was annexed to such evidence.

The Temple of Baris (mentioned by Strabo) may happily be some Monument of
Noah's descent, by corruption of the word Lubar as before said, Antiq.lib. ^.
cap.5.
Josephus out of Nicolaus Damascenus calling it Baris with loss of the first
syllable.

Iuvenal accuses the Armenians of Sooth-saying, and Fortune-telling, by
viewing the inwards of Pigeons, Whelps, and Children. His words are in Sat. 6.

Spondet amatorem tenerum vel divitis orbi
Testamentum ingens, calidae pulmone columbae

of Armenia pay tribute unto many Seas: Phasis and Lycus unto the Pontike Sea;
Cyrus and Araxes unto the Caspian; Euphrates and Tigris unto the Red or Persian
Sea: These two last are famous for their yearly ouerflowings, the former of
them arising amidst three other Seas, yet by the incroaching violence of the
beetle-browed Hills enforced to a far longer, more intricate, and tedious way,
before he can repose his wearied waves: the other, for his swiftness, bearing
the name of Tygris, which with the Medes signifies an Arrow. Solinus, cap. 40.
says, That it passes through the Lake Arethusa, neither mingling waters nor
fishes, quite of another color from the Lake: It diueth under Taurus, and
brings with it much dross on the other side of the Mountain, and is again
hidden, and again restored, and at last carries Euphrates into the Sea. The
Armenians, besides their natural Lords, have been subject to the Persians;
after that, to the Macedonians, and again to the Persian; after, to Antiochus
Captains: then, to the Romans and Parthians, tossed betwixt the Grecians and
Saracens, subdued after successively to the Tartarians, Persians, and Turks.
Of these present Armenians M. Cartwright reports, Preachers Travels.
That they are a people very industrious in all kind of labor: their women
very skillful and active in shooting and managing any sort of weapon, like the
ancient Amazons. Their families are great, the father and all his posterity
dwelling together under one Roof, having their substance in common: and when
the father dies, the eldest son does govern the rest; all submitting
themselves under his Regiment: after his death, not his son, but the next
brother succeeds, and so after all the brethren are dead, to the eldest
son. In diet and clothing they are all alike. Of their two Patriarchs, and
their Christian profession, we are to speak in fitter place.

The Turcomanians (later inhabitants) are as other the Scythians or Tartarians,
(from whence they are derived) theeuish, wandering up and down in Tents
without certain habitations, like as the Curdi also their Southerly
neighbors, their cattle and their robberies being their greatest wealth. Of
their Religion (except of such as after their manner be Christians, which we
must defer till a fitter time) we can find little to say, more then is said
already in our Turkish History. This we may here deplore of the unhappy site
of Armenia, which though it repeopled the world, yet is it least beholding to
her viperous offspring, a map of the worlds miseries, through so many ages.
For being hemmed always with mighty neighbors on both sides, it self is made
the bloody Lists of their ambitious encounters, always loosing whosoever won,
always the gauntlet of the Chalenger, the Crown of the Conqueror. This (to let
pass elder times) the Romans and Parthians, Greek Emperors and Saracens,
Turks and Tartarians, Turks and Mamalukes, Turks and Persians, do more then
enough prove. Ptolomey places to the North of Armenia, Colchis, washed by the
Pontike Sea; Albania by the Caspian; and betwixt these two Iberia, now
(together with some part of Armenia) called Georgia, either for the honor of
their Patron S. George, or happily because they descended of those Georgi, which
Pliny Lib.6. c. 13.
names among the Caspian inhabitants. Strabo Strab.l.11.
records four kinds of people in this Iberia: of the first sort are chosen
two Kings, the one precedent in age and nobility, the other a leader in War,
and Lawgiver in Peace: The second sort, are the Priests: The third, Husbandmen
and Soldiers: The fourth, the vulgar servile people. These have all things
common by Families, but he is Ruler which is eldest; a thing observed of the
Armenian Christians (as before is said) even at this day. Constantinus
Porphyrogenitus Constable.de administrando imperio ad Romanum F. c 45.
the Emperor writes, That the Iberians boast and glory of their descent from
the wife of Vriah, which David defiled, and of the children gotten between
them. Thus would they seem to be of kin to David and the Virgin Marie: and
for that cause they marry in their own kindred. They came (they say) from
Jerusalem, being warned by Vision to depart thence, and seated themselves in
these parts. There departed from Jerusalem David and his brother Spandiates,
who obtained (say they) such a favor from GOD, that no member of his could be
wounded in war, except his heart, which he therefore diligently armed;
whereby he became dreadful to the Persians, whom he subdued, and placed the
Iberians in these their habitations. In the time of Heraclius they aided him
against the Persians, which after that became an easy prey to the Saracens. Of
the Roman conquests and exploits Dion Cassus lib. 37. and 49. Agathias lib.4.

(now Zuiria) lies North and East betwixt Iberia and the sea, of which Strabo
affirms that they need not the sea, who make no better use of the land: for
they bestow not the least labor in husbandry, and yet the Earth voluntarily
and liberally yields her store: and where it is once sown, it may twice or
thrice be reaped. The men were so simple, that they neither had use of money,
nor did they number above an hundred; ignorant of weights, measures, war,
ciuility, husbandry: there were in use amongst them six and twenty
languages. They had Sansouinus and Pius Secundus, report of such Spiders in
Italy, in Calabria, called Tarantulae
Spiders which would procure death unto men smiling, and some also which did
men to die weeping.

They worshipped the Sun, Jupiter, and the Moon, whose Temple was near to
Iberia. The Priest, which ruled it, was next in honor to the King: he
performs the holy rites, rules the Holy Region which is large and full of
people: of the sacred servants, many, being inspired, do divine or prophecy.
He which is most ravished with the spirit, wandereth alone through the woods:
him the Priest takes, and binds with a sacred chain, allowing him sumptuous
nourishment the space of a year, and after brings him to be slain with
other sacrifices to the Goddess. The rites are thus. One which is skillful of
this business, holding that sacred spear where with they use to slay the man,
stepping forth, thrusts it into his heart: in his falling they observe
certain tokens of divination: then do they bring out the body into some
place, where they all go over it. The Albanians honored old age in all men,
death in none, accounting it unlawful to mention a dead man; with whom they
also buried his wealth. Plin.li 7. c.2.
Pliny out of Isigonus affirms, that a people called Albani (not these I
think, if any) were hoary haired from their childhood, and saw as well by
night as by day.

Mengrelia (sometime Colchis) adioyneth to the Euxine sea, in which country
Strabo mentions the Temple of Leucothea, builded by Phryxus: where was also
an Oracle, and where a Ram night not be slain. This Temple was sometimes
very rich, but spoiled by Pharnax, and after of Mithridates. This country the
Poets have made famous by the fables of Phryxus, and Jason. Phrixus the son
of Athamas Prince of Thebes, and of Nephele, with his sister Hell fled from
their cruel stepdam Ino, upon the back of a golden Ram, from which Hell
falling into the water gave name thereto, of her called Hellespont: Phrixus
coming safe into Colchis, sacrificed to Jupiter, and hanged up the fleece of
his Ram in the grove of Mars. which custom was yearly practiced of his
posterity. Jason after by command of Pelias (seeking by a barbarous enemy, or
a dangerous navigations to destroy him) with fourscore and nineteen other
companions in the ship, called Argo, fetched this fleece from hence by the
help of Medea: and the ship and the Ram filled heaven with new
constellations. That fable Diod. Sic.li.4. Not.Com.lib.6. lussin.l.b.42. Strabo
lib.11.
had ground of history, howsoever by fictions obscured. For the rivers here
in Colchis are reported to carry gold down with their streams and sands,
which the people take with boords bored full of holes, and with fleeces of
wool. Spain has of late yielded many such Argonauts, with longer voiages,
seeking the golden Indian Fleece, which their Indian conquest may make the
ensign of their Order more fitly, then their Burgundian inheritance.

Herodotus Lib. 2.
is of opinion that Sesostris left some of his army here at the river Phasis,
persuaded hereunto by the agreement of the Colchians and Egyptians in the same
ceremony of Circumcision, and in the like works of hemp, Vadianus cites out
of Valerius Flaccus the like testimony. Pliny in his sixth book, and fifth
chapter, reports of Dioscurias a City of Colchis, whilome so famous, that
Timosthenes affirms that three hundred nations of differing languages lived
in it, and afterward the Roman affairs were there managed by an hundred and
thirty Interpreters, Annal.lib. 6.
Cornelius Tacitus says that they accounted it unlawful to offer a Ram in
sacrifice, because of Phry^us his Ram, uncertain, whether it were a beast,
or the ensign of his ship. They report themselves the issue of the
Thessalonians.

The present Mengrelians are rude and barbarous, defending themselves from the
Turks by their rough Hills and ragged poverty: so inhumane that they sell
their own children to the Turks. I read not of any other religion at this
day amongst them but Christian, such as it is. Some add these also to the
Georgians. Quadus.
The wives of diverse of these people reported to be exercised in arms and
martial feats, happily gave occasion to that fable or history of the Amazons.

Busbequius Aug. Busbcq. epist.3.
says, that Colchos is a very fertile country, but the people idle and
careless: they plant their Vines at the foot of great Trees, which marriage
proves very fruitful, the husbands arms being kindly embraced, and
plentifully laden. They have no money, but in stead of buying and selling they
use exchange. If they have any of the more precious metals, they are
consecrated to the use of their Temples, whence the King can borrow them under
pretense of public good. The King has all his tributes paid in the fruits of
the earth, whereby his Palace becomes a public storehouse to all comers.
When Merchants come, they give him a present, and he feasteth them: the more
wine any man drinks, the more welcome he is. They are much given to
belly-cheere, dancing, and loose sonnets of love and daliance. They much
caroll the name of Rowland or Orlando, which name it seems passed to them
with the Christian armies which conquered the holy Land. No marvel if Ceres
and Bacchus lead in Venus betwixt them, which so rules in these parts, that
the husband bringing home a guest, commends him to his wife and sister, with
charge to yield him content and delight, esteeming it a credit that their wives
can please and be acceptable. Their Virgins become Mothers very soon; most of
them at ten years old can bring witnesses in their arms (little bigger then a
great frogge, which yet after grow tall and square men) to prove that there is
never a maid the less for them. Swearing they hold an excellent quality, and
to be a fashion-monger in oaths, glorious: to steal cunningly winnes great
reputation, as of another Mercury; and they which cannot do it, are holden
dullards and blocks. When they go into a Church, they give mean respect to
the other Images: Saint George is so worshipped, that his horses hoofes are
kissed of them. Dadianus the King of Colchos or Mingrelia, came a suitor to
Solomon. while Busbequius was there. Betwixt them and the Iberians, their
neighbors, is much discord. And thus much of their present condition.

Haithon Haiton.cap.7.
the Armenian, extending the confines of Georgia to the great sea, says: In
this kingdom is a thing monstrous and wonderful, which I would not have
spoken nor believed, had I not seen it with mine own eyes. In these parts
there is a Province called Hamsem, containing in circuit three days journey,
and so far is it covered with an obscure darkness, that none can see any
thing, nor dare any enter into it. The inhabitants thereabouts affirm, that
they have often heard the voice of men howling, cocks crowing, neighing of
horses; and by the passage of a river, it appears to have signs of
habitation. This is reported by the Armenian histories to have come to pass by
the hand of GOD, so delivering his Christian servants (by Sauoreus a Persian
Idolater, Lord of this place appointed to die) and so punishing with outward
darkness the inward former blindness and rage of those persecuting
Idolaters. Thus Haithonus or Antonius a Churchi (for so Ortelius names him)
but this darkness seems more ancient, and to have been the cause of that
proverb Tull. in Acadein cimmerij q^bus aspectum su^^siue Deus al^quis sieve

The Georgians (girt in with two mighty adversaries, the Persian, and the
Turk) have endured much grieuance from them both: and, in the late wars,
especially from the Turk, Io Bol.Ben.
who has taken and fortified many of their principal places of importance,
Gori, Clisca, Lori, Tomanis, Teflis, the chief city of Georgia, unto which
from Derbent there yet remain the foundation of a high and thick wall built
by Alexander. Ortelius esteems Derbent to be Cancasiae portae, which Pliny
Plin.l.6.c.11.
calls a mighty work of nature, etc. Westward from hence is entrance into
the Circassian country, extending it self on Meotis five hundred miles, and
within land two hundred. Christians they are in profession: from hence the
Soldans of Egypt had their slaves, of which were raised their Mamalukes. Their
chief Cities are Locoppa and Cromuco: at the mouth of Tanais, the Turk has
fortified Asaph. They live in great part on robberies. In old time in this
tract was Phanagoria, and therein the Temple of Venus surnamed Apaturia, Strabo
lib. 11.
because, that when the Giants assaulted her, she implored the aid of
Hercules, who slew them all one after another. Cimmerium a town at these
straits, gave name thereunto of Cimmerius Bosphorus. But little can be said of
these in particular, more then generally may be said of the Scythians, to whom
they are reckoned.

Georgius Interianus Apud Rhamus.
has written a tractate of these Zychi, or Circassi, called of themselves
Adiga; expressing their unchristian christianity, and barbarous manner of
living; which I hold fittest in our discovery of the diverse professions of
Christian Religion to relate.

add unto Armenia in their modern Mappes and Discoueries, besides the
Turcomani, a people that came thither out of Tartaria, the Curdi, both still
retaining the Tartarian and Arabian manner of life in tents without Cities,
Towns, or houses. Their religion halteth betwixt diverse religions of the
Turks, Persians, and Christians of the Iacobite and Nestorian Sects. In heart,
they are neither fast to GOD nor man; dissembling with the Persian and Turk,
whose subjects they have successively been, and better skilled in robbery,
murder, and faithless treachery (their daily practice) then mysteries of
faith and religion. They are also Lords of Bitlis, and some other Cities and
holds in those parts. They are supposed to be a remnant of the ancient
Parthians, and never go abroad without their arms, bows, arrows, scimitars,
and bucklers, even when Age seems to have fastened one foot in the grave.
They adore Cartwrights Travels.
and worship the Devil, that he may not hurt them, nor their cattle: they are
cruel to all sorts of Christians: their country is therefore called Terra
Diaboli. One of their Towns is named Manuscute, a mile from which is an
Hospital dedicated to Saint John Baptist, much frequented as well by Turks,
as Christians, whom superstition has persuaded, that whosoever will bestow,
kidde, sheep, or money, to relieve the poor of that place, shall both prosper
in his journey, and obtain the forgiveness of his sins.

ARmenia extending it self (if Iustine Lib.42.
have measured rightly) eleven hundred miles, on the East encountreth Media, in
which lies our next perambulation. It received the name of Madai, the son of
Iaphet, not of Medus the son of Medea and Jason. It is limited Strabo lib.11.
on the North, with the Caspian sea; on the South, with Persia; on the East,
with Parthia. Ecbatana, the chief City built (as Pliny Plin.l.6.c.14.
affirms) by Seleucus (indeed far more ancient, and by him happily
reedified) is distant from the Caspian Straits twenty miles. These Straits are
a narrow way made by hand through the hills, scarce wide enough for a cart to
pass, eight miles in length, the rocks manifesting their indignation at this
interruption, by obscure frowns, and salt Sol.cap.50.
tears continually streaming from them, which I know not by what sudden
horror, are presently congealed into ice; also all the Summer time with armies

Of Ecbatana we read in the History of lud.1.
Judith that Arpachshad built the walls of hewn stones, seventy cubits high,
and fifty cubits broad, etc. Herodotus Lib.1.
affirms, that after the Assyrians had reigned in Asia five hundred and
twenty years, the Medes rebelled, and chose Deioces to be their King, and at
his command builded him this royal City, and a Palace of great beauty (the
timber whereof was Cedar, joined with plates of silver and gold; it was seven
furlongs in compass) his successors are there reckoned, Phraortes, Cyoxares,
Astiages, Iustine Iuslin.lib.1.
reports that Arbactus or Arbaces, Liefetenant of the Medes under
Sardanapalus, rebelled against him for his effeminate life, and translated the
Empire from the Assyrians, with whom it had continued thirteen hundred years,
to the Medes. Diodorus Siculus Diodorus Sic. lib.3.cap.7. Melan.Chro.l.2.
adds in this conspiracy, unto this Arbaces the Mede, Belesus, whom some
call Phul Beloch the Babylonian, who shared the State betwixt them; the
Babylonian possessing Babylonia and Assyria; and Arbaces, Media and Persia. Of
this more is See li.l.c.13.
said before.

In the time of Ninus, Farnus (says Diodorus Sic.lib.3.1.
Diodorus) was King of Media, who, encountering with Ninus in battle, was there
taken, with his wife and seven sons: all which the bloody Conqueror
commanded to be crucified. And thus remained Media handmaid to the Assyrians,
till the time of Sardanapalus; but not without some disquiet. For in Semiramis
time the Medes rebelled, and destroyed Niniue. But Semiramis invaded their
country with a mighty army: and coming to the hill Bagistanus, sacred to
Jupiter, there pitched her tents; and Diodorus lib.3.cap.5.
in the plain fields made a garden, containing twelve furlongs. Beyond the
garden she cut a rock seventeen furlongs high, grauing therein her own
Image, and an hundred others, bringing her gifts. Some Stuckius de sacris
Gentium.
tell this otherwise, that she pourtrayed her own Image in that huge
quantity, and appointed an hundred Priests continually to attend the same with
offerings and divine worships. At Chaona a City of Media, she espying another
huge rock in the plain, caused another garden to be made in the midst
thereof, with sumptuous houses of pleasure therein, whence she might behold
all her army, and there gave her self a long space to rest and voluptuousnes,
making choice of the likeliest Gallants in her Camp for her bed-fellowes, all
whom she after did to death. Thence to Ecbatana she made the way shorter, and
more passeable, casting down hills and exalting the valleys into a plain,
still bearing her name. At Ecbatana Ecbatana was built before Deioces, yea
before Semiramis time.
she built a Palace, and brought water thither from the hill Orontes, by a
laborious and costly channel. And thus did she not only subdue the rebellious
Medes, but made a conquest of Nature in ostentation of her puissance. The same
Diodorus Sic.lib.4.cap.3.
Author tells, that multitudes of Sparrowes, which eat up their seeds,
forced the inhabitants to leave their soil; as did Mice cause some parts of
Italy, and Frogs (rained out of the clouds) the Attariota, and (as we have
Lib.3.cap.15.
observed) the Fleas chased away the inhabitants of Myus. How great is the
Creator, that of the smallest of his creatures can muster armies to the
conquest of them which swell in conceit of their own greatness? We like
Giants by our wickedness defy the Heavens, and defile the Earth, saying (by
our works) Job 21.1^.
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? when as yet this LORD of Hosts
need not tame us with legions of Angels (one could destroy Senacheribs host)
nor set the Heavens in their courses to fight his battles (as against the
Cananites) nor arraunge the Elements with an ouer-whelming Chaos to confound
us, by a Sodomiticall fire, or airy pestilence, or deluge of waters, or
devouring of the earth: nor needs he Lions to challenge apart of this glory to
their strength and prowess: Frogs, and Lice, and Flies shall be Pharaohs
chalengers, conquerours, iaylers: And how many nations in Africa have the
insulting triumphing Grassehoppers exiled from their native dwellings? Proud
man, well may the basest of thy basest servants thus make thee to see thy
baseness; and by rebelling against thee, argue thy rebellions against their
and thy Creator. Et queenon prosunt singula multa iuuant. Et quod non possunt
singula, multa nocent.


But that we be not too far transported with this not unjust passion; let us
return to our Province of Media; which Arbaces Read lib.x.cap.13.
delivered from Assyrian servitude, and subjected it together with the Eastern
Empire to himself, under whose posterity it continued three hundred and two
and twenty years. Astyagas, the last, was by Cyrus, his Nephew, conquering
according to two dreams, which had fore-signified this unto him. In the first
he dreamed, that he saw so much urine streaming from his daughter Mandane (his
only child) that all Asia was drowned therewith: in the other, a Vine grew
from her, which shadowed all Asia. His Magi Herodot.l.^.Val.Max. etc.
told him, that hereby was foretold his nephews greatness, with the loss of
his kingdom. To prevent this, he wedded his daughter to Cambyses a Persian:
and when she was delivered of a child, he committed it to Harpagus (one of his
trusty Counselors) to be made away. He fearing revenge from the daughter, if
she should after succeed her father, delivers the Infant to Mitradates the
Kings Heard-man, commanding him in Astyages name, to expose it on the
mountain. He returning home, found his wife newly delivered of a dead child,
which, by her entreatie, was laid forth in stead thereof. Her name was Spaco,
which in the Median language signifies a Bitch: whence the fable grew, that
Cyrus being so exposed, was nourished by a Bitch. This Infant growing up, and
called by the Heard-mans name, after ten years was known by this occasion.
lustin.lib.1.
A company of boys playing together, chose this stripling for their King, who
used his childish royalty with more then childish discipline. For he ordained
diverse officers, some of them to be his guard, some builders, messengers, etc.
as he thought fit. Amongst whom was a son of one Artembares, a man of great
estimation, who for neglecting his office, was by this young kingling severely
chastised. He complained thereof to his father, and the father brought the
child to the King, accusing the indignity of the fact, that his Heard-mans
son should deal so malapertly and cruelly, showing his beaten shoulders to
Astyages. The Heard-man and his supposed son was sent for, that Artembares
might be satisfied: where the young King gave so good account of that his fact,
that Astyages much amazed, took the Heard-man aside, and with busy enquiry
learned of him all the truth of this matter: wherewith enraged against
Harpagus, who ought himself to have done that dismal execution, but
dissembling the same, he told him that he would do sacrifice for the childs
safety, and bad him send his child to bear Cyrus company, inuiting him also
to suppe with him, where he feasted him with the flesh of his own son, whose
head, fingers, and toes were set before him at the last service. Harpagus bare
it as patiently as he could, till fitter occasion of revenge offered it self,
which thus fell out. The Magi told Astyages that in this childish kingdom of
Cyrus, the danger of his dream was already passed, and that he needed not
fear any further danger. Wherefore he was sent into Persia to his parents.
After he was now a man, Harpagus, having secretly solicited the Medes to
rebellion against their cruel Sovereign, acquainted Cyrus with his project,
to that end enclosing a letter in a Hares belly, which he sent to Cyrus by one
of his huntsmen: which was with such industry and success prosecuted, that
Astyages lost his Scepter, and Cyrus translated the Empire to the Persians. For
Harpagus being made General of the army of the Medes, revolted to Cyrus with
all such as he had made acquainted with his treason. And when the Medes after
rebelled in the time of Darius, they were forced again to subjection. The Magi
were by Astyages command crucified: and he himself re-enforcing his power, and
bidding battle to Cyrus the second time, was taken alive, and by his nephew
set over the Hyrcans.

The Magi had large and fertile possessions (thus reports Ammian. Marcel.
lib.23.
Ammianus) assigned them in Media. Their Science called Magia, is by Plato
termed Machagistia, which mystical word signifies the purest worship of the
Gods: to which Science Zoroastres of Bactria in old times added many things out
of the mysteries of the Chaldees. But because the Persians had from hence their
Empire and this religion, by whose arms they were made known to the world:
there shall be fitter place to speak of these Magi, when we treat of the
Persian Rites. In this Region was made the oil Medicum, wherein their arrows
were steeped, which being shot out of a looser bow (for a swifter shot
extinguished it) did burn the flesh in which it did stick, and if water were
applied to it, the fire thereof increased. Nor could any remedy cure the same,
but hurling dust thereon. It was composed of Naphta. The Medes made league with
this ceremony. Boem. lib.2.Francisco Thamara.lib.2.
They wounded the soldiers of each party, either licked others blood.

The North parts of Media were barren, and therefore they lived on Apples,
dried and stamped together: of roasted Almons they made bread, and wine of the
roots of herbs. This and Venison was their food. In one plain Pius secundus
Asia.
of Media were pastured fifty thousand Mares, belonging to the King: the
herb whereon they principally fed, is still called Medica. The race of
horses, called Nisaei, were here bred, and hence dispersed all over the East.

Among Alex.ab Alex. lib 4. c.23.
the Medes, none might be King by the law of the country, except he were in
stature and strength eminent. All the Medes (says Bardesanes Bar. apud Eusebius.
dep^^arat. Euang l.6.c.^8.
a famous Chaldaean) nourish dogs with great care, to which they cast men
ready to die (whiles they are yet breathing) to be devoured of them.

The Medes Plutarch de orb. Lun. Gramaye. Curtius l.b.3.
worshipped the fire, with barbarous honors done thereto. Their Kings held such
Majesty, that none might laugh or spit before them: They were seldom seen of
their people: They had always Musicians attending them. Their wives and children
accompanied them in their battles.

The name of the Medes remained famous after the Persian conquest, as appears
by the style which the Scripture Dan 6.8. Ester.1.8.
gives them: the law of the Medes and Persians which was unchangeable, the
King himself not having power to revoke his sentence.

As for the Catalogue of the Kings which succeeded Arbaces, until the time of
Astyages, and the times of their reign, we have before showed it out of
Scaliger, Scalig. Can. Isag.
in our first book, Chap. 13. True it is, that all agree not in that account.
Reinerus R. Re^nec. Syniag. de famil. etc.to.1.
Reineccius leave out diverse of them, and numbreth the years of the Median
Dynastie but 261. whereas our former account has 322. But I had rather
referrre the Reader to that Catalogue, then trouble him with new out of this or
other Authors.

Media has been Maginus Thesaur.Geog.
divided into Media Mayor, and Airopatia: the former contains Tauris,
supposed by Ortelius to be the forenamed Eebatana (yet now wanting walls
altogether) containing in circuit sixteen miles, and of people two hundred
thousand; subdued to the Turk 1585. and before by Selim and Soliman. Sultania

famous for the fairest Moschee in the East. Casbin, to which the Persian has
removed the royal seat from Tauris. The lake of Van three hundred miles long,
and an hundred and fifty broad (after Strabo Strab.li.11.
, Manlianus Lacus) of salt water the greatest next to Meotis. Gyllius
Pet.Gyllius in Ortelij 1 hes.
affirms, that eight great rivers run into it, without any apparentissue to
the sea.

Atropatia is now called Seruan; the chief City is Sumachia, or Shamaki, in
which the Sophi not long since Hak.A.lenkinson.
built a Turret of flint and freestone, and in a rank of flints therein did
set the heads of the Nobility and Gentry of the country, for a terror to
the rest: the quarrel was pretended for religion, intended for soueraignetie.

Their ancient Religion Plut.de facie in orb. Lun.
differed not much from the Persian, and such also is it still. Their Strabo
lib 11.
Kings had many wives, which custom extended after to the Villages and
mountains, in so much that they might not have less then seven. The women
Coel.l.18.c.29.
also esteemed it a credit to have many husbands, and a miserable calamity to
have less then five. Cyrus subdued them to the Persians, Alexander to the
Macedons. What should we speak of the Parthians? who made Ecbatana their seat
royal in the summer time: and of the Saracens, Tartars, Persians and Turks, who
have successively vexed these countries.

Not far from Shamaki, says Master Ienkinson Hak. Voyag. tom.1.
, was an old castle, called Gullistone (now beaten down by the Sophi) and not
far from thence a Nunry of sumptuous building, wherein was buried a Kings
daughter, named Ameleck Chauna: who slew her self with a knife, for that her
father would have forced her (she professing chastity) to have married a
Tartar King: upon which occasion the maidens every year resort thither to
mourn her death.

There is also a high hill called Quiquifs; upon the top whereof (they
Asabulous report of the Medes.
say) dwells a Giant named Arneoste, having on his head two great horns, and
ears and eyes like a Horse, and a tail like a Cow, who kept a passage
thereby, till one Haucoir Hamshe (a holy man) bound him with his woman
Lamisache and his son After; who is therefore had in Saint-like reputation.

CHAP. III.
Of The Parthians, and Hyrcanians.

PArthia is placed by Pliny Lib.6.25.
in the roots of the hills: having on the East, the Arians; on the West, the
Medes; on the South, Carmania; on the North, Hyrcania, rounded with deserts. He
affirms that the kingdoms of the Parthians were eighteen. Eleven of them
near to the Caspian sea; and the other seven near the red sea. The word
Parthian signifies with the Scythians an exile. Their chief City was
Hecatompylos, now (as some Maginus.
affirm) Hispaham, for the excellency thereof called of the Persians, Half
the World. These Scythian exiles in the times of the Assyrians, Medes,
Persians, and Macedonians, were an obscure people, the prey of every
Conqueror, which after seemed to divide the world with the Romans. Their
speech was mixed of the Median and Scythian: their armies consisted most part of
servants, which they held in great respect, instructing them in feats of arms.
In an army of fifty thousand, wherewith they encountered Antony, there were
only 800. freemen. The parthians Justin.41.
had no use of gold or silver, but in their armor. They had many wives, whereof
they were so jealous, that they forbad them the sight of other men. They
performed all business private and public on horseback; this being the
distinction of freemen from servants. Their burial was in the bellies of
birds, or dogs. Their naked bones were after covered with earth: they were
exceedingly superstitious in the worship of their gods: a stout, unquiet,
seditious, unfaithful people. Arsaces, first a famous thief, after, the
founder of that kingdom, left no less memory of himself amongst the
Parthians, then Cyrus among the Persians, or Alexander among the Macedonians.
The day wherein he overthrew Seleucus, was solemnly observed every year
amongst them, as the beginning of their liberty. Of him they called all their
Kings Arsaces, as the Roman Emperors are named Caesar's. They Am.Mar.lib.23.
called themselves the brethren of the Sun and Moon, which are in those
places worshipped. This Arsaces was worshipped after his death. They were no
less bloody to their brethren, when they came to the Crown, then the Ottomans
are at this day. Phrahartes Justin.lib.42.
slew thirty of his brethren, and before them, his father, and after, his
son, rather then he would endure a possibility of a Competitor. About
Vadianus. Sec fol.5.
228. years after CHRIST, Artabanus the last Persian King being slain by
Artaxeres or Artaxares the Persian, the Empire returned to the Persians, who
were thereof deprived by the Saracens; and they again by the Tartars: and now
for the greatest part under the Sophi: they had their cuppe-quarrels, striving
who should draw deepest: which custom we need not go into Parthia to seek.
Strabo mentions among the Parthians a College or Senate of Magi and
Wisemen. Their ancient religious Rites I find not particularly related.

The Parthian affairs are thus by some Justin.lib.41. Dion Cassius lib.4 ^.
Pius secundus Asia. Gramaye Parthica; P.Biz: rus Rerum Persicaram.lib.30.
related. After Alexanders death, none of the Macedonians vouchsafing so mean
a Province, Stragonor a forreiner obtained it: after which the Macedonians,
contending in civil quarrels for the Soueraignety, Parthia wauered in
uncertainty, till in the time of Soleucus the nephew of Antiochus, Theodotus,
Deputy of Cachia, entitled himself King: so giving example of rebellion to
the Eastern Nations, which Arsaces among the Parthians easily followed. He
combining himself with Theodotus, and after his death, with his son
strengthened himself in his new erected government of two Cities. But Seleucus
taking arms against him, was by him overthrown in battle: which day first
gave light to the Parthian greatness, not unworthily observed therefore of
their posterity with solemnity. For Seleucus being by more important affairs
called home, the Parthians had leisure to establish their hopes. Athenaeus
reports that Arsaces took him prisoner, and after gentle usage he sent him
home.

After this first, came a second Arsaces, who encountered with Antiochus the
son of Seleucus, coming against him with an army of an hundred thousand
footmen, and twenty thousand horse. The issue was, they parted friends in
mutual league. Priapatius or Pampatius was their third King, to whom Phraates
his son succeeded; and next, his brother Mithradates, who subdued the Medes
and Helimaeans, enlarging the Parthian Empire, from Mount Caucasus to
Euphrates. He took Demetriu. King of Syria prisoner: and died in his old age.
His son Phraates was the fourth: on whom Antiochus warred, and the Parthian
opposed against him his brother Demetrius, till then detained prisoner. But
whiles he warred against the Scythians, by treason of his own subjects he was
slain; and Artabanus his uncle placed in his room. He also soon after died
of a wound received in the field: and his son Mithridates succeeded, whom the
Parthian Senate expelled and deposed. But others reckon between Artabanus and
Mithridates, Pacorus, and his son Phraates. So uncertain is the Parthian
History; for which cause also Read lib.1.cap.13.
Scaliger blames Onuphrius for being too peremptory in such uncertainties.

Next in order is reckoned Orodes or Herodes, who besieged his said brother
Mithridates in Babylon, and took both it and him, and caused him to be slain
in his sight, Against him Crassus the Roman Consul (moved with covetousness,
L.Florus lib.3. cap.11.
hateful to GOD and man, says Florus) led the Roman Legions to win the
Parthian gold: And by the way, Joseph. Antiq.lib.14.cap.12.
passing through Iudaea, spoiled the sacred Treasury which Pompey spared,
amounting to two thousand talents, and robbed the Temple of eight thousand
talents besides. He also carried away a beam of solid gold, weighing three
hundred Minae (every Minae is two pound and a half Roman) delivered unto him
by Eleazarus the Treasurer, upon condition to take nothing else. But Crassus
violated the oath which he had given to Eleazarus, and carried all he liked.
Many dismal Stadius in Floru^^.
presages prohibited Crassus this expedition, as the curses of the Tribune,
whom Dion, Plutarch, and Appian, call Ateius Capito. Those curses were
denounced with invocation of some unknown gods. Also the Roman ensigns were
drowned, with sudden tempests in Euphrates: and when Plutarch. Crassus. Liny
epitome lib.106. Eutropij lib.6.Dion Cas.lib.40. Sim. Maioli dies Canic.
Colloq.16.
he had sacrificed to Venus, his son stumbled and fell, and Crassus with him.
He rejected the Legates of the Parthian, alleging the former league with
Pompey. Thus posting to his destruction, one Mazaras (as Florus calls him; or
as Plutarch, Ariamnes; Dion, and Appianus, name him Augarus) encountered him,
not with arms, but with arts and wiles, professing great hostility to the
Parthians. Crassus following his advice, led his army into by-ways and
deserts, till being brought into the Parthian snares, his new guide forsook
him, and the covetous Consul with his son were slain, and eleven Roman
Legions taken or left in the place. His head and perjured right hand were sent
by Surinas the Parthian General (who was said to have then in the field with
him twelve hundred Concubines, and a thousand Camels laden with his own
furniture) unto King Orodes: who contumeliously, (if contumely and merit can
join society) used the same, pouring into his jaws, sometimes greedy of
that metal, molten gold. Orodes envying Surinas the glory of this victory,
slew him, and committed the remnants of that war to be pursued by his son
Pacorus, adjoining to him in that exploite Osaces. In the civil wars they
took part with Pompey against Caesar. Pacorus being received into society of
the kingdom with his father, invaded Iudaea, and placing Antigonus in the
kingdom, captiued Hircanus. But whiles he aspired to greater hopes, he lost
himself and his army, in which were twenty thousand horsemen, in a battle
with Ventidius; who by a wily Stratageme, counterfeiting flight and fear, and
suffering the Parthians to come up to their tents, that they had now no space
for their arrows, effected this overthrow.

Pacorus his head reduced the Cities of Syria to the Roman subjection, without
further war. This news made his father mad, who before boasting of the
conquest of Asia by Pacorus, now in many days did neither speak nor eat: but
when he once did open his mouth, all his speech was Pacorus, who still seemed
present unto him. In this extaticall mood, Phraates, one of his thirty
soones, which he had by so many Concubines, slew him, and after them his
brethren, as before is said, with a son also of his own. This cruelty caused
many Parthians to betake themselves to voluntary exile, among which Monaeses
provoked Flor.l.4.c.10. Dion lib.49.
Antonius to war upon this Tyrant. He did so, but with badde success, of
sixteen Legions scarce bringing the third part back again. Phraates,
impotent and incapable of so glorious adventures, grew into such insolences,
that the people exiled him, and placed Tiridates in his room; who was soon
after displaced by the Scythians, and Phraates restored to his place. Tiridates
fled to Augustus (then warring in Spain) for refuge and aid, carrying with
him the son of Phraates, whom Caesar sent back again to his father without
any price, maintaining neither party against the other, but allowing liberal
provision to Tiridates.

But after this, Suetonius in vita Augusti, cap.21.
Augustus going into the East, the Parthian, fearing ill measure, re-deliuered
all the Roman captives, and ensigns, and gave hostages also, his two sons,
with their wives and children, and resigned Armenia to the Romans. Phraatax his
son slew him, with greatest injustice repaying that which was most just, and
due to his former paricide. This Phraatax, using incestuous acquaintance with
his mother Thermusa (an Italian, whom Augustus had bestowed on Phraates, and by
whose help he was slain) was killed in an uproar, leaving his son Orodes
his successor. He also in a conspiracy was killed: and Vonon Sueton. in vita
Tiberij, cap.49.
substituted, whom the Parthians not long enduring, forced to seek help of
the Romans, where he was perfidiously slain.

Artabanus obtained the Empire, Mat. Burgklehner. these.hist. lib.6. tom.1.
from whence he was after chased by Vitellius, who placed Tiridates in the
throne, which he had scarce warmed, when Artabanus recovered it, and after left
to his son Bardanes; the Arsacian stock being now dispossessed. This
Bardanes Cornel. Tacit. Annal. lib.11.
whiles he minds wars against the Romans is killed of his own. Gotarzes
his brother succeeded to the Scepter: which he held, notwithstanding the decree
of the Roman Senate for Meherdates the son of Vonon, whom he took and cut off
his ears: Vonones was his successor, a little while, and presently after
Vologaeses, his son. The next was Artabanus, and after him Pacorus; and in
the next place Cosdroes his brother: against whom Traian warred with good
success, who extended the Roman Empire to the Indians. But Adrian renewed
league with the Parthian. Parthanaspates succeeded: and soon after Vologaeses,
who left heir his son of the same name, deprived by his brother Art abanus.
He being unjustly dealt with by the Romans treachery, drove them to sue for
peace: which, after that Antonius Herodiani Macrinus.
the author of the breach was dead, was easily obtained by Macrinus his
successor. But Artaxares a Persian prevailed better, in a third battle
overthrowing him, and reducing the kingdom after such a world of years to the
Persian name. Some reckon this 472. years from Arsaces, and 228. after CHRIST.
Scaliger Ios. Scal. Canon. Isagog. li.2.
reckons the time of the Parthian Dynastie 479. years. The number of their
Kings after this computation is 29. They which list to see further of their
wars of the Romans, may read the Roman Authors which have written the same:
the sum whereof is here presented to your view.

Cornelius Tacitus Cor. Tac.l.12.
tells a merry tale (for I think these tragedies have wearied you) and
pertinent to our purpose, of a good-fellow-like Hercules, whom the Parthians
worshipped. This kind-hearted god warns his Priests in a dream, that near
to his Temple they should set horses ready furnished for hunting, which they
do, lading them with quiuers full of arrows. These after much running up and
down the forest, return home at night blowing and breathless, their quiuers
being emptied. And Hercules (no nigard of his venison) acquainteth the Priests
at night by another vision with all his disport, what woods he has raunged,
and the places of his game. They searching the places, find the slain beasts.

Better fellowship certain had their Hercules then their Kings, when they
invited any to their feasts. For the King Albenaeus lib.4.cap.14.
had his table alone and lofty, the guests sit below on the ground, and, like
dogs, feed on that which the King casts to them. And many times upon
occasion of the Kings displeasure, they are haled thence and scourged, and yet
they then, prostrate on the ground, adore their striker. They Herodiani Macrinus
worshipped the Sun at his arising. Bardesanes Eusebius de praepar Euang.lib
6. cap.8.
in Eusebius, says of them, that to kill his wife, or son, or daughter, or
brother, or sister (yet unmarried) was not prohibited by the law to any
Parthian, nor any way subject to punishment. The Parthian Sucton. Caligula.5.
ensign was a Dragon; the royal ensign a bow: their style was, King of
Kings; they ware a double crown. They had an ointment made of a certain
composition, which no private man might use. Nor might any else drink of the
waters of Choaspes and Eulaeus. None might come to the King without a present.
The Magi were in great authority with them. Their Rites were mixed of the
Persian and Scythian. Nothing was more severely punished then adultery. A
servant might not be made free, nor might be suffered (except in the wars) to
ride, or a freeman to go on foot. Their fight was more dangerous in flying,
then in standing or giving the onset.

describes: Pugna levis, bellumque fugax, turmoeque fugaces,
Et melior cessisse loco, quam pellcre, miles:
Illita terr a dolis, nec Martem cominus vnquam

That is,

And better soldiers when they run away,

Their crafty caltrops on the ground they lay:
Nor dares their courage come to right-downe blows,
But fights further off most trusting to their bows.


Many Cities amongst them, and two thousand Villages are said Pius secundu^
Gramaye Parth.
to have been overwhelmed with Earthquakes. They are said to be of spare
diet, to eat no flesh, but that which they take in hunting: to feed with their
swords girt to them, to eat Locusts: to be false liers and perfidious: to have
store of wives and strumpets. Their country is now called Arach; in it is made
great quantity of silks.

Hyrcania (now called Straua or Diargument) has on the West, Media; on the
East, Margiana; on the South, Parthia; on the North, the sea, which hereof is
called the Hyrcane, otherwise Caspian. Famous it has been, and is, for store
of woods and Tigers. There are also other wild beasts. Here in the City
Nabarca was an Oracle, which gave answers by dreams.

Some rivers in this country have so steep a fall into the sea, that under
the waters the people resort to sacrifice or banquet; the stream shooting
violently over their heads without wetting them. Iouins writes, That the air
is unwholesome by reason of the fennes. Straua the chief City abounds in
traffike for Silk. The Islands before it in the sea, were no less refuge to
the inhabitants in the Tamberlane-tempest, then to the Italians, in the time of
Attila, those places where now Venice stands. Their Religion, as their State,
both in times past and present, has followed the Persian: of whom we are next
to speak.

It is Strabo lib.11.
reported of the Tappyri, inhabiting near to Hyrcania, That their custom was
to bestow their wives on other men, when they had borne them two or three
children: so did Caeto his wife Martia, on Hortensius: and such, says
Vertomannus, is the custom at this day of the Indians in Calechut, to exchange
wives in token of friendship.

They had wine in such estimation, that they anointed their bodies Caelius
Rhod. lib.18. cap.28.
therewith. The Caspij shut up their parents, after they are come to the age of
seventy years, and there in respect of piety (what more could the impious
do?) starve them to death. Some say, That after that age they place them in
some desert, and a far off observe the event. If the fowls seize on them
with their talents, and tear them out of their coffius, they account it a
great happiness: not so, if dogs or wild beasts prey thereon. But if nothing
meddle therewith, it is accounted a miserable and lamentable case. The Derbices
account all faults (though never so small) worthy of the utmost punishment. The
Earth was their Goddess: to their holies they admitted nothing female, nor to
their tables. They killed such as were above seventy years old, calling to
that bloody banquet their neighbors, esteeming such miserable, as by disease
were intercepted and taken away. Old women's flesh they eat not, but strangled,
and then buried them: they likewise buried such as died before that age.

CHAP. IIII.
Of Persia, and the Persian affairs, until the Mahumetan conquest.

PErsia, if we take it strictly, is thus bounded by Ptolomey Lib.6.cap.4.
: It has on the North, Media; on the East, Carmania; on the West, Susiana; on
the South, part of the Persian Gulf. But this name is sometimes stretched as
far, as that wide and spacious kingdom; all that Empire being often called
in Authors, Persia, and differing in the bounds and limits, according to the
enlarging or contracting of that Monarchy. It is supposed, that the Persians
descended of Elam, the son of Gen.10. 22.
Shem; whose name remained unto a Region called Elymais, mentioned by
Ptol.lib.6.c.3.

Herodot. lib.7.
reports, that they were called of the Greeks Cephenes; of the neighboring
nations, Artaei. Suidas Suidas in verb. Magog.

names are by Ortelius Ortelij Theat. and Thesaurus.
added, Chorsori, Achaemenij, Panchaia etc. It was called Persia of Perseus the
son of Danae, or of Perses the son of Andromeda; or (as others) of Perses
the son of Medea.

From the time of Chedorlaomer, whom Abram with his houshold-army overthrew,
until the time of Cyrus, little mention is made of them: he freed them from
the Median servitude, and erected first that mighty Persian Monarchy. Bizarus
P. Bizar. Historia rerum Persicarum. Christ. Pezel. medific. historic. pars 1.
(which has written twelve books of the Persian affairs) supposes that in
that time of their subjection to the Assyrians and Medes, they had Governors,
and laws, of their own: only owing a tributarie subjection to the other, as
their supreme Lords. This he collecteth out of Xenophon. Cyrus was by name
foretold by Esaias Es.44.28.
, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the Temple, by his authority, before
that Babylonian Monarchy was erected which destroyed them. GOD after revealed
to Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel by dreams, this Persian both rising and fall. And
by dreams did he make way unto the effecting of his decree; as appears in
Herodotus, Iustine and others. For Astyages Herodot.lib.1.Justin. lib.1.
dreaming that he saw a vine growing out of the womb of his daughter Mandane,
which covered all Asia (interpreted by his Wizards, of the subversion of his
kingdom by his daughters future issue) married her as before is said, to

Danae, and the son of Achaemenes, Of this family and other of the Persians,

(...), that is,

This he interpreted of the overthrow of Cyrus, but proved it in himself;
Craesus his son had been mute, till (now seeing the sword of the enemy
ready to give the fatal stroke unto his father) violence of sudden passion
brake open those bars and stoppes which Nature had set before, as impediments
to his speech, and by his first most fortunate-infortunate language, cried to
the bloody soldiers to spare his Great were the treasures which Cyrus gate in
his wars; but his expenses in his daily diet (engraven in a pillar, which
Alexander caused to be rased) seem incredible: the particulars whereof, see in

father. After his many great exploits, he warred upon Thamyris the Scythian
Queen, where he lost his life. I know not how, Divine Providence seems to
have set those Scythian stints to the Persian proceedings: those great
Monarchs, both in the elder, and our later world, ever finding those Northern
winds crossing, and in some dismal success prohibiting their ambition that
way.

Ctesias (as Photius Ctesias ap. Phot^um, ed. inter hist.Persscript^r^s.
has collected out of his eleventh book) tells somewhat otherwise of Cyrus;
as that Astyages, whom he calls Astygas, was not of any kin to him, but
being conquered by him, was first imprisoned, and after enlarged, and kindly
entreated: likewise that his daughter Amytis (her husband Spytama being slain)
was married to Cyrus: that Craesus being taken, was first by magical illusions
delivered from the executioners, and after by tempest of thunder, with many
other things of like unlikeness to the current of Authors,

Cyrus was of so firm memory, that he could call all the soldiers (some say
but all that had any place of command) by their proper names. He ordained, that
his soldiers should in the first joining with the enemy sing certain Hymns
to Castor and Pollux, that by this means they should not be surprised with
sudden fear. He gave leave to the Jews to return and re-people their
country, and to rebuild the Temple. Scaliger Caluisius. Alij A.M.3421.
A. M. 3419.

Cambys^s his son succeeded, who took, and after slew, Psammenitus King of
Egypt. And when he would have added Aethiopia Herodot.lib.3.
to his new conquests, with the spoils of the Temple of Ammon, for which
purposes he sent two armies; the one was almost consumed with famine, the
beasts and provisions failing, and that barren desert denying grass; the
remainder by consuming one another, were (a strange remedy) preserved from
consumption, every tenth man being by lot tithed to the shambles, and more
returning in their fellows mawes, then on their own legs. The other army
was quite buried in the sands. At his return finding the Egyptians solemnizing
the feast of their Idol Apis, he slew the same (it was a Bull which they
worshipped): and after dreaming that Smerdis reigned, he sent, and slew his
brother which was so called, in vain seeking to frustrate this presage, which
was fulfilled in another of that name. He fell in love with his sister; and
asking whether it were lawful for him to marry her, the Judges (whose
authority with the Persians lasted with their lives) answered, that they had
no such law, but they had another that the King of Persia might do what him
liked; whereupon he married her. His cruelty appeared, in that Prexaspis
presuming to admonish him of his too much inclination to drunkenness, he
answered, he should see proof of the contrary, and presently sending for
Prexaspis his son, with an arrow shot him to the heart: the father not daring
but to commend his steadie hand and art in shooting. He died of his own sword,
which falling out of his scabberd as he mounted his horse, killed him, not
fearing in this country of Syria any such disaduenture, because the Oracle of
Latona Bizar, i.1.
in Egypt had told him he should die at Ecbatana; which he understood of
Media, and was fulfilled at another Ecbatana (more obscure) in Syria. He caused
a Judge, which had been corrupted with money, to be flayed, and made of his
skin a covering for the Tribunal. Polyaenus tells, That against the
Egyptians he used this stratageme, to set their Gods (Dogs, Cattes, Sheep,
etc.) in the forefront of his battle. He neither deserved nor obtained that
honorable funeral which Cyrus had, who was buried at Pasargadae, a Tower
shadowed with Trees, having in the upper part a Chapel furnished with a Bed
of Gold, a Table, Cups, and Vessels of the same metal, with store of
Garments and Furniture, set with Jewels. Certain Magi were appointed to attend
it, with daily allowance of a Sheep, and once a month a Horse for Sacrifice.
His Epitaph was, O man, I am Cyrus, King of Asia. Founder of the Persian
Empire; therefore envy me not a Sepulcher. Alexander opened the same in hope
of Gold, but found nothing, saving a rotten Shield, a Sword, and two Scythian
Bows: he crowned it with Gold, and covering it with his own apparel,
departed. These things Strab.l.15. Arrian.l.6. Curtius, l.9.
Strabe, Arrianus, and Curtius report.

Next to Cambyses 3428.
succeeded, for a small time, one Smerdis, which was slain as an Usurper, by
the seven Princes; and Darius 3429.
, the son of Hystaspes, succeeded, designed to that greatness by the first
neighing of his Horse. For when no male issue royal was left, these Princes
agreed, That meeting in a place appointed, he whose Horse first neighed, should
be acknowledged Emperor. Darius his Horse-keeper, the night before, had
suffered his Horse there to use his brutish lust with a Mate; which the place
presently causing him to remember, he there (by his lustful neighing)
advanced his Master to the Scepter. Darius for his covetousness (first
exacting tribute) was called a Merchant, Cambyses a Lord, Cyrus a Father of his
people. Babylon rebelled, and was 3436.
recovered by the costly stratageme of Zopyrus Justin.l.^. Plutarch. in
Apophibeg.
, who cut off his nose and ears, and fleeing in that deformed plight to the
Babylonians, accused Darius of that cruelty. They believing, entertained him,
and knowing his Nobility and Prowess, committed their City to his fidelity,
which he upon the next opportunity betrayed to his Master. Darius warred
against the Scythians, but unfortunately. His Army was of 700000 men. After
Darius his death Xerxes 3466.Scal. Animad.in ^useb.page.101.
reigned (whom Scaliger proves to be Assucrus, the husband of Esther.) He
made League with the Carthaginians, warred upon the Grecians with an Army (as
Herodotus Herodot l.7.
numbreth) of 1700000 footmen, 80000 horsemen, 20000 Chariot-men: Others say,
That there were 2317000 footmen in Landforces, besides 1208 ships. Before
the Army was drawn the sacred Chariot of Jupiter, by eight white horses; no
mortal man might ascend the Seat. He offered to Minerua at Troy 1000 Oxen. He,
taking view of his huge Army, wept, in thinking, that of all that number in 100
years none would be alive. At the passing of the Hellespontike straits, he
(besides other devotions performed) at the Sunne-rising took a golden Vial
full of sacred liquor, and cast the same into the Sea, with a golden Bowl and
a Persian Sword; uncertain whether in honor of the Sun, or in satisfaction
to the angry Hellespont, which a little before, in more then mad arrogance,
he had caused to be whipped, and hurled fetters therein, with many menacing
threats. He wrote letters with like threatenings to Mount Athos, and accordingly
pierced his bowels, and made way by force through that high and huge Mountain.
This Expedition was in the year of the World 3470. Leonides, with his
Spartans, enlarged his glory at the Thermopylaean straits Xerxes sent first
15000, after 20000, and lastly 50000 choice men against them which all had the
worse: till a traitor taught Xerxes another way where to pass and come upon
their backs: and then Leonides in the night entered the Persian camp and slew
20000 with his 500 men which were killed being weary with killing.
, or narrow passage, which a long time, with a handful of men, hindered the
Persians from passing. Mardonius was slain, and Xerxes fled out of Greece,
after he had taken Athens, and lost great part of his Army, which in two
years space received five overthrows, at Thermopylae, at Artemisium, at
Salamis, at Plataeae, at Mycale. Xerxos being slain of Artabauus his kinsman,
A. M. 3485. Artaxerxes succeeded.

Among other the mad parts of Xerxes, it is reported, That he fell in love
with a Aelian. Var. Hist.l.1.
Plane Tree in Lydia, which he adorned with chains and costly furniture, and
appointed a Guardian thereto. Artaxerxes writ to Hystanes, Governor of
Hellespontus, That he should give Hippocrates Cous (who then lived, and whose
writings still remain the Physicians Oracles) as much Gold and other things as
he would, and send him unto him. In his time the Egyptians rebelled, and
created Inarus their King, to whom the Athenians sent three hundred Galleys
for defense; but by Artabazus and Megabyzu they were subdued. To him Ismenias
the Theban was ambassador: who loath to pollute the Grecian freedom with that
Persian custom of adoration (a thing for the show of Religion therein, as some
interpret, no less hated of Mordecay, Esth.3.) and not suffered otherwise to
do his Embassage, let fall his Ring when he was brought into the Kings
presence, and falling down, took it up at the Kings feet, satisfying both the
Persian and his own by this Aelian. Var. Hist. l.1.
subtletie. Artaxerxes died An. M. 3525.

After this Artaxerxes, surnamed Long-hand, another Xerxes succeeded and
reigned a small time, as did also Sogdianus, or Ogdianus, whom Darius Nothus
slew, and possessed the Throne. In the time of this King was the Peloponnesian
War, which Thucydides has related. Artaxerxes Mnemon his son succeeded An.
M. 3545. He slew his brother Cyrus, and enjoyed the Scepter 43. years. After
his death succeeded Ochus, and reigned three and twenty years. Next to him
was Arses, or Arsames; and last of all Darius, whom Alexander overthrew the
second time at Arbela, An. M. 3619, and conquered that Persian Monarchy to the
Macedonians. Of the Macedonian successors of Alexander (so much as concerns
this place) is before handled in our Syrian relation. They were deprived of
these parts by Arsaces, of whom and all his Parthian followers, even now ye
have read in the Chapter of Parthia.

Concerning these Persian Kings, Chronologers (after their wont) differ not a
little: Master Lively his Chronology of the Persian Monarchy.
Lively has taken great pains in this Argument; besides the painful labors
of Scaliger, Iunius and many others, both Rabbines, and Greeks, and Latins, in
whose streams Elephants may swim, and the greatest Students may find enough
to busy their studious brains: for me, it is sufficient to taste, or at least
to enter so far as a Lamb may safely wade, without peril of drowning, The

are destitute of their own) are most absurd, some Aben Ezra.

in the Persian Chronology faineth diverse names to the Persian Kings; as
Assuerus, Artaxerxes, Darius Assyrius, Artaxerxes Pius. Lively, and other
modern Writers out of the Greek Olympiads and Histories, have given truer
account of the Persian Times and Government, beginning with the five and
fiftieth Olympiad, and continuing the same to the third year of the hundred
and twelfth.

Scaliger and Calvisius (as you have seen before) do a little differ from
this account of M. Lively. which he lively proves by conference of other
Histories, both Humane and Ecclesiastical, Clemens, Eusebius, Herodotus,
Diodorus, Polybius, Xenophon, Thucidides, Diouysius Halicarnasseus, Livie and
others. As much ado is made about the beginning and ending of Daniels weeks,
and the time of the building and finishing the second Temple, both which are
much illustrated by the right knowledge of the Persian Chronology. Iunius Iun.

Artaxares being a man of haughty spirit, fought three battles with
Artabanus the Parthian, and at the third time deprived him of Life and Scepter
together. He proceeded to subdue the neighboring Barbarians; and passing over
Tigris, disturbed the Roman Province of Mesopotamia, devouring in hope, and
threatening in terms all those Asian Provinces, sometimes subject to the
Persians, before the Macedonian deluge. Alexander Seuerus (son of Mammea) the
Emperor writ to him, to stay his course: But Pikes, not Pens, were like to
prevail with Artaxares, who brought into the Field seven hundred Elephants and
eighteen hundred Charriots, and many thousands of horsemen, but with much
bloodshed was forced to leave the honor of the day to the Romans. Herodianus
seems to write harder fortunes of the Romans in this war. But Lampridius,
Eutropins, Orosius. and Zosimus write, That Senerus obtained the victory, and
took Ctesiphon and Babylon, and subdued also Arabia. Agathias Agathias, l.2.
affirms, That Artaxares was called Magus.

Valerianus was overthrown by Sapores, the successor of Artaxares, in
Mesopotamia, and there taken, and was made a footstool for Sapores, on whose
neck he used to tread, when he took horse; and at last was flayed alive, and
sprinkled with Salt. Zosimus says, That he was trecherously taken at a meeting
for conference: and Trebellius Pollio ascribes it to the treason of his guide.
This cruel Tyrant afflicted the Roman Provinces, to Cilicia and Cappadocia,
filling with dead bodies the broken spaces between the Hills feeding (as it
were) those deformed gaping jaws with cruel banquets of man's flesh. Oaenatus
Palmirinus brought some light to the Romans in this darkened and dreadful
Eclipse of their Sun, and recovered the Roman territories. His wife Zenobia
after his death, like another Semiramis, proved a fortunate General and
Warrior against the Persians, and also against the Romans, from whom she
withheld Syria, till Valerius Aurehanus carried her to Rome, being by
unexpected accident surprised. As for Valerianus, it was the just judgment of
GOD for his cruel persecution of the Christians, whom he had at first
favored, till one of the Egyptian Priests had persuaded him to this and other
wickedness, as humane sacrifices, and such like, Eusebius. l. 7. e. ^. He was
taken of Sapores, An. Dom. 260. after Calvisius computation. Buntingus has two
years less.

In the time of Probus the Persians sued for peace, and obtained it; he
procuring such peace in the East (says Vopiseus) that a rebellious Mouse was
not heard to peep. Carus his successor warred against the Persians, and having
entered their Country as far as Ctesiphon, was slain with a Thunderbolt (no
Roman Emperor, by I know not what secret destiny, from the time of Crassus,
passing those parts, without unfortunate success.) This was Av. Dom. 283.

Diecletian sent Galerius against Narses the Persian, son to Varranes, or
Varaaranes, the second: (for after Sapores, Hormisda his son had reigned a
year; Varranes the first, three years; Varranes the second, sixteen; and a
third of that name only four months, as Agathias reckons.) But not far
from Carrhae (fatal to the Romans) Galerius Caesar lost Oros.and Pom:.Laetus,
A.D.296
almost all his Army, and therefore found homely welcome at his return,
Diocletian suffering him to lacquey (in his Purple Robes) some miles after his
chariot. Indignation supplying his former defects, he recovered his credit with
the overthrow of the Persians; Narses fled, leaving his wives, sisters, and
children to the Conqueror. A League was made, with return of Armenia,
Mesopotamia, and Assyria to the Romans.

Misdates the Persian began his reign An. Dom. 301. To him An. 309. succeeded
his son Sapores, and reigned (which I think was never read of any) longer
then he lived in view of the world, beginning his reign before his birth,
which he continued threescore and ten years. For Misdates Agathias, l.4.
dying without issue male, and leaving his wife great with child, the Princes
consulted with the Magi, whether this future birth would be a male; which they
affirmed, observing their predictions by a Mare, then ready to foale, and the
Princes set on the Crown, or Royal Ensign, on the mothers belly,
acknowledging him for their King. This Sapores, in a letter to Constantius the
Emperor, insituled himself King of Kings, partaker of the stars, brother of
the Sun and Moon: he demanded all that had before belonged to the Persians,
to be restored. Betwixt them grew a bloody war, as Ammianus relates.
Sapores took Singara and Bezabde, An Dom.359. but was repelled into Persia by
Constantius. Julian his successor seeking to sub due the Persian, lost
himself. The best part of himself he had lost before in Apostasy, which
plucked this destruction upon him, A. 362. It is uncertain whether divine or
humane hand executed this justice on him. Iovinian was presently saluted
Emperor, but forced to agree on dishonorable conditions with the Persians,
leaving the Rabdicens, Carduens, Rhesens, Zalens, and Nisibis to the Persian
dominion. And a little after, in the reign of Valens, the league was broken by
Sapores, who won Ctesiphon: Valens intending this war, was by the Goths
overthrown and burnt alive, before he could effect any thing, An. 377. When
Theodosius reigned, the peace was renewed.

After Sapores succeeded Artaxerxes; and after him Sapores, his son, both
which reigned nine years. Then followed Varanes Cermasat eleven years, to who^
succeeded A.400.Bunt.
Isdigertos, who held peace with the Romans. Procopius writes, That Arcadius
the Emperor on his deathbed, An. 407. ordained in his last Will, this
Isdigertes the Tutor and Protector to his son and heir Theodosius, which he
faithfully performed. Agathias also acknowledges it a current report.
Niceph.Callist.lib.14.cap.18.
Maruthas was in credit with this King. He was a Christian Bishop, and by his
prayers had cured him of a grievous sickness, which the Magi with their Fiery
superstition, and all their labor, could not effect. The Magi conspiring
against Maruthas, watched opportunity, that when the King should come (after
the Persian wont) to worship the Fire, a man (whom they had hidden before
within the earth for that purpose) cried aloud, That the King should go forth,
as being accounted of their God impious, who so loved a Christian Bishop.
Hereupon the King bethought him of sending him away. But Maruthas suspecting
the knauerie, counseled the King to cause the earth to be dug up; for the
Fire, says he, cannot speak. The King going into the Chapel or Sanctuary,
and hearing this voice again, followed Maruthas his counsel, and found out
their packing, and punished the authors, allowing Maruthas to build a Church,
wheresoever he pleased, in Persia. And whiles the Magi yet added to their
trecheries, he not only punished their persons, but distasted their Religion,
and purposed to become a Christian, but by death was prevented, which happened
An. 421. Varanes, or Vararanes his son, followed not his steps, but both
brake league with the Romans, and persecuted the Christians. Narses his
General, with his forces, were defeated, Azamaea wasted, Nisibis besieged by
the Imperials: The Saracens, which aided the Persian, stricken with a strange
fury and amazement, drowned themselves in Euphrates. It is said, a hundred
thousand men perished. Theodosius then Emperor knew these things by Palladius
Socrat.Hist.Eccles.l.7.c.19.
, who in three days did ride from Constantinople hither, and back again in
as many, using to flee in this manner to any the remotest parts of the Empire,
with such admirable, and almost miraculous expedition, with his celeritie
making that spacious Empire seem but narrow and strait. Varaaranes sent an
Army of those expert soldiers which were among them, for their excellency
called Immortal. but the Roman swords soon proved them mortal. Thus
succeeded that war which he had begun for despite to the Christian Religion
and Profession. He was forced to seek peace, and ended or mitigated his
persecution. To him succeeded, An 441. another Izdigerdes, who reigned
seventeen years; and after him Perozes, who reigned four and twenty years:
after him, his brother Obalas ( Btzarus calls him Bleses) ruled four years.
Cabades his successor renewed the Wars with the Romans: and no marvel, for
he was cruel to his own people, and warred even against Nature: for he
ordained (as some report) That women should be common, any wedlock-bands
notwithstanding. Whereupon his Nobles conspired against him, deprived and
imprisoned him. Blases was enthronized ( Scaliger has Zamaspes) who four
years after resigned the State unto Cabades again, who having before reigned
eleven years, added thereto thirty more. Nicephorus Niceph.Callist:

tells, That he became friend to the Christians, and permitted free liberty of
that Religion upon this occasion. Between Persia and India was a Castle,
called Tzundadaer, wherein Cabades had heard, that much money and jewels were
kept. Cabades used all means to obtain it, but in vain; so strongly was it
(as the Story says) guarded with Devils. He therefore used all the Persian
Exorcismes to dispossess them; and when they prevailed not, he sought to
effect it by the Jews, but with the former success. At last he made use of
the Christians, who expelled the spirits, and delivered the Castle unto him.

It is reported, that he slew Zeliobes, King of the Hunnes, for playing on both
hands, and coming to help him in his wars against the Romans, having before
sworn to assist the Emperor. About these times were the Maniehees Manes,
first author of this Heresy, was flayed alive, and cast to the dogs.

destroyed in Persia, for corrupting his son Phatuarsa with their infectious
leaven. He therefore slew their chief Prelate Indagarus, and many thousand
Manichees, all in one day, having assembled them with a wile, professing, that
he would make that his son King. He assembled also the chief of the Magi,
Glonazes; and Boazanes a Christian Bishop, for the greater solemnity, with
like devotion as Iehu sacrificed to Baal, with the presence and assistance of
Iehonadab, 2. King.10. Calvisius says, this was done An.Dom. 523. Cabades died
An. 531.

His son Cosroes the Great succeeded and reigned eight and forty years. He
about the thirteenth year of Justinians Empire, An. 539. invaded the Roman
dominions, took Surus, burnt Berraea, destroyed Antiochia, and with less
success besieged Edessa. Agathias prefers this Cosroes for his great
exploits before Cyrus and Xerxes. Yet was his end ignoble, and unworthy his
high spirit. For Mauritius, in the time of Tiberius, entered into the Persian
dominions, and burnt some villages near to the place where Cosroes then was
for his recreation, and saw this burning spectacle: wherewith Indignation and
Grief mustering greater multitudes of fearful, unquiet, enraged thoughts in
his heart, then Mauritius had soldiers in his Army, unable to bear such
unwonted sights of hostile flames in his Countries, and such unwonted fights of
inward perturbations, even greatness of spirit made way to Pusillanimitie, and
being weakened with colluctation of contrary passions, a Fever, taking that
occasion and advantage, apprehends him, and soon after kills him.

Some say, his son Ormisda reigned seven years with his father. He succeeded
and reigned eight years; against him Mauritius performed worthy attempts,
which made way unto him for the Roman Empire. And then also he had good
success against the Persians, by the valor of Philippicus his General:
insomuch, that the Persians moved with these and other discontents, by
incitement of Varamus, deposed Ormisda, killed his wife and son before his
eyes; which having remained to perform unto him that their last, uncouth,
unnatural service, were presently after put out, and himself imprisoned. That
Varamus had, a little before, been sent as General against the Roman Army:
which his service being found unserviceable, and the Romans prevailing, he was
not only deprived of his place, but, to his further disgrace, was, by the
Kings commandment, clothed in woman's attire: which indignities he repayed not
in words alone (in his letters stiling Ormisda, The Daughter of Chosroes) but
with those unnatural and disloyal practices: which he continued also against
Cosroes, son and heir of Ormisda, forcing him to flee to Mauritius the
Emperor for succor.

said to help Varamus in his rebellion; the first wars which we read of
achieved by that Nation: but both he and they received discomfiture by Narses
the Roman General, and six thousand were taken and slain. The Turks being
asked why they helped Varamus answered, That they were forced thereto by
famine: they were also marked with a black Cross, which (they said) they
learned of the Christians, thereby to expel hunger. Cosroes thus recovered the
Kingdom by aid of the Empire.

Nicephorus De Chosroe and Mauritio lege Niceph.l.17. and 18.
witnesses, That he was deeply seen in the Chaldaean mysleries, and being by
a Roman Governor reproved for some excess, in those times when he so much
needed their help; he answered, That the times did advantage him to those
reproves: but know (says he) that calamities shall also befall the Romans,
and the Babylonian Nation shall rule them three weeks of years. After that,
in the fifth week, the Romans shall subdue the Persians: Which being come to
pass, a day shall come that shall have no night, and the expected end of the
Empire shall be at hand; in which time Corruption shall be abolished, and men
shall live according to Divine Ordinance. This, either false or uncertain
Prophecy (according to that Deepenesse of Satan) he uttered, but what effect
answerable has followed, I know not.

This Cosroes reigned nine and thirty years. He held peace with the Romans
whiles Mauritius lived; but when Phocas cruelly and treacherously had slain
him, a world of evils at once assaulted the Empire. The Germans, Gauls,
Italians, Hunnes, and Persians, by their Armies afflicted the public State;
and the Roman Bishop then began to aspire to an universal Soueraignetie, which
that Murderer first entitled him unto. That Army which was yet red with the
blood of Mauritius, by the Persians sword was punished, and died in their own
blood: who having overthrown the Romans in two battles, possessed
Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt, Palaestina, and Phoenicia. He entered Jerusalem,
slew and captiued many Christians Bizari, l.6.
, and carried thence the Cross. Against the Iberians, Armenians, Cappadocians,
Galatians, Paphlagonians, even unto Chalcedon, he prevailed. Thus did GOD
punish that Murderer, and besides (to pay him in his own coin) Priscus,
Heraclon, and Heraclius conspired against this Conspirer, and murdered the
Murderer, and having cut off his Priuities, and his Head, hurled him into the
Sea, and destroyed his Issue.

Heraclius succeeded, who repressed Cosroes, unto whose power Carthage, with
Africa, was now also subjected, which he had invaded, conducting his Armies
through Egypt. Heraclius sends an Embassage to him, which received this
answer, That he would never lay down Arms till the Crucified GOD were
abolished, and the Persian Mithra worshipped. This encouraged Heraclius, seeing
now CHRIST himself was a party; under whose banners he could not but find
happy events of War. Cosroes had slain in Palaestina fourscore and ten
thousand Christians, and the Jews also had brought many of them to the
slaughter. Heraclius encountered with Ostanes, and slew thirty thousand
Persians. By a stratageme he won Sarbatus, a great Commander, to his part.
In another battle he had lost the Field, but Thunders and terrible Tempests
were sent (as Succenturiatae Copiae) to assist the soldiers of their Lord, and
vshered destruction to the Persian Camp, whiles the Romans killed them, being
both blinded with Lightnings, and amazed with inward terrors and outward
Tempests. He had before chased Cosroes, and taken Thebarma (a Persian City)
wherein was a Temple of the Fire, which by fire he consumed. And in the year
626, Cosroes now at his wits end, or rather quite beyond them, appointed
Medarses his son to be his successor and heir apparent: wherewith Siroes,
his elder son, being discontent; conspired to betray his father and brother
to Heraclins: and son after caused them both to be slain at Ctesiphon. Peace
was concluded with the Romans, and their provinces restored. Only Arabia was by
Mahumet holden, as a Seminary of a greater mischief, under which the world
with grief and amazement still groneth. Siroes Adeser, Barazas, and Baram the
daughter of Cosroes, in their order of succession in that disordered and
turbulent estate, had scarce two years allowed to them all: to whom succeeded
Ormizda, Iezdegird, who about the year six hundred threescore and two, was
overthrown and slain by the Saracens: and that Persian kingdom (then
weakened by civil dissentions) was subdued to Saracenicall servitude; and that
second Persian Dynastie (continued as Scaliger Io.Scalig.Can, Isag.
reckons in eight and twenty successions, the space of four hundred and two
years) had an end. From thence unto this time their religion is Saracenicall:
their state governed, by the Califas, Io, Lampadius Mellific. Hist. part 3. and
our third book shows the order in succession of them.
and such commanders or Sultans as they placed over them, till their Sultans
warring with the Califa for soueraintie, procured aid from the Turks: who
dispossessed them of their kingdom presently after they had disburthened them
of their enemies: The Turks were displaced and chased away by the Tartars. Of
these both Saracens and Turks you have the history in the former book, and
therefore needelesse here to be related: Of the Tartars shall follow in their
order.

Of those ancient Persian Kings this does Sardus relate. Sardus l.2.c.^^.
The Persian Kings birthday, is by all Asia observed solemn, festival to
the immortal Gods: Eunuchs have charge of his body, that he may grow strait
and fair: at seven years he is taught to manage horses: at fourteen he is
committed to the Kings masters; the most excellent which can be chosen among
the Persians, for wisdom, justice, temperance, fortitude. These teach him
Magike, instituted of Zoroastres, containing Religion of the Gods: and the
Kings I awes; to embrace the truth, to bridle his affections; not to be
afraid of any thing. When he takes possession of the kingdom, he releaseth
the tributes, and in the Temple of the Pasagordan Geddesse he puts on the
garment of Cyrus, whose sepulcher is in the town. He eats dry Figs,
Turpentine, drinks sour milk, and after that, water out of Eubaeus, and
Choaspes, rivers of Media, Chalybonian Wine out of Syria, Wheat of Assos in
Troas; his head anointed with Myrrh, and covered with a turbant. To sit in
his throne (which was of gold sustained of four pillars beset with jewels) was
death to any: at his table sat only his Mother and wife: and Artaxerxes
admitted his brethren. In the winter he lived at Susae: in Summer, at
Ecbatana: in Autumn, at Persepolis: in the spring, at Babylon. The nobles
attend at the gates ready at the Kings command. There stood a Trivet of iron,
to which they which are out of his favor resort expecting their sentence: For
he pardons none, till he has them in his power. When he sleeps, he is
attended by three hundred women dancing by a lamp: at his beds feet are three
thousand talents of gold, at the head five thousand, over the same a Vine of
gold, with the clusters of Jewels. In the morning he is wakned with these
words: Arise, think of those things which Mesoromasdes would have thee, that
is, Zoroastres. He sacrifices for the Persians, and gives to each man gifts,
because Cyrus had done so at his return out of Media: and he receives
presents from them: in his slore-houses he keeps of the waters of Nilus, and
Ister, as the Lord of all lands. Fire is carried before him. They which meet
him, close their hands behind their back, and adore him: for which cause some
report that the Persians (as also the Aethiopians, Meroites, Indians,
Assyrians) hold their Kings in place of Gods. Which divine adoration Just. li.6.

Keckerman, as he was admirable in Philosophy, so he was like himself in his
Aphorisms and Disputations of the Persian Monarchy. Wherein he propounds and
proves, that their King was to be well featured and of personable presence
without bodily deformity or defect: learned in their sciences; free from
punishment of laws: they had their delectable gardens which they called
Paradises: accustoming the^ selves to hunting, and to solemn feasts,
especially on their birth-daies, when no suter might be denied his request. For
conservation of his Maiesly, he was seldom seen: the King swear by Mithres
which is the Sun: was inaugurated at Palargidae (as the later have used at
Cafe.) Many other things of excellent note the desirous Reader may there find.

races, to endure all hardships of heat, cold, showers, and such like. He

CHAP. V.
Of the Persian Magi, and of their ancient Religion, Rites, and Customs.

THE name of Magi is sometimes applied (say some) to all the Persians,
Boskhieri Ara Coeli.
or else to the particular Nation amongst them: sometime signifies the most
excellent in Philosophy, and knowledge of Nature, or in sanctity and holiness
of life. Thus Suidas Suidas in v. Magus.
calls the Persian Magi, Philosophi, and Philothet, studious of knowledge, of
Nature, and of God. Sometimes it signified such as we now call Magicians,
practisers of wicked Arts. Among the Persians this name was ancient and
honorable, says Peucerus de diuina^.c.de Magia.
Peucerus, applied only to the priests, which lived in high reputation for
dignity and authority, being also Philosophers, as the Chaldreans were. To
these was committed the custody of Religion, of ancient Monuments, of later
Histories, of public Records, and the explanation of the Persian wisdom,
whose account appears in the former chapter, whereafter Cambyses death, one
of them is reported to succeed in the Throne, Now whereas the Ethnikes had a
tradition of two Genij, Brutus was terrified with such a spectrum: the like
they tell of Marius and many others.
which attend every man, one good; the other evil; proceeding (to likelihood)
from divine truth, concerning good and evil Angels, which are either
ministering spirits for man's good, or tempters unto evil: Curious men hence
took occasion to devise new Arts, which were called (...) and (...); by the
one calling upon the good Demon or Genius; by the other, on the evil: which
evil One could easily turn himself into an Angel of light, to delude blind
people, being indeed (as in our White and Black witches at this day) worse
when an Angel, then when a Devil. Hereof were diverse kinds; Ne (...)
Necromancie, which inuocated the spirits of the dead: Of which smoakie Soote,

Purgatory, strive who shall have the blackest tincture. They had also their
Lecanomancie, which was observed in a Basin of water, wherein certain plates
of gold and silver were put with Jewels, marked with their iugling Characters,
and thence after pronuntiation of their words were ausweres whispered; (...)

Gastromancie procured answer by pictures, or representations in
glasse-vessels of water, after the due rites. Catoptromancie received those
resemblances in clear glasses: Crystallomancie, in Crystal; Dactyliomancie
was a divination with Rings (which perhaps Gyges vied) consecrated by certain
positions of the heavens and devilish enchantments. Onymancie with Oil and
Soote daubed on the Nail of an undefiled child, and held up against the Sun:
Hydromancy with water: Acromancie with air. But what should I add the many
more names of this Artlesse Art, unworthy the naming? Tibi nomina mill, Mill
nocendi arts; Infinitely diuersified are these blind by-waies of darkness and
mischief.

Leave we them in their mazes, circles, Iabyrinths of Error: and let us take
view of the Persian Magi, from whence Pliny Plin.l.30.c.1.
deriueth the first originalls of Magical Vanities; which are (says he)
compounded of three Arts, that exercise most imperious power over the minds of
men; Physic, and that offering her self more sublimate and pure, in the
sacred name and rites of Religion, beautified also with the addition of
Mathematical Sciences; ( a threefold cord not easily broken, like a
three-headed Cerberus, or tripple crowned Prelate, holding the world in fear
or love thereof.) Zoroastres (who lived as Endoxus testifies six thousand
years before Plato) first invented it in Persia. Hermippus affirms, that
Agonax taught him. Apusorus and Zaratus among the Medes, Marmaridius the
Babylonian, Hippocus the Arabian, and Zarmocenidas the Assyrian, have been
famous for their practice and writings of this Art. Pythagoras, Empedocles,
Democritus, Plato, sailed far to learn it, undertaking long exiles, rather
then pilgrimages or peregrinations, to that end. He impiously adds Moses
and Iochabell (it may be he means Joshua) to this impious number. The
Scripture tells of Iannes, and Iambres, and Simon Magus famous in this infamy.
It is like that in the Persian Magi concurred both a certain stock or
kindred, which were all so called (as is said) and the Philosophical
inquisition of Nature, and the Priestly function, and also some either
implicit or explicit society with Devils. The same they were, at least in
profession and reputation, that the Philosophers with the Greeks, their
Priests in Egypt, Gymnosophistes in India, Chaldaeans in Babylon, Druydes in
Gallia, and in this our lsle, the Italian Aruspices, and other religious
persons (the Treasurers of their Theology and Philosophy) in other places. As
for those Magi mentioned in the Mat. 2.1. Baskbier Ara Coeli.
Gospel, some suppose them to come from Aethiopia; some from Arabia; some from
Mesopotamia; some from Chaldaea; and some from Persia; and some from diverse of
these Regious. Whencesoeuer they came, they had a brighter Star to guide them
with diuiner light, then those Magical brands of hellish fire could yield.

Plato Plato Alcibiad.
commends this Magia, and calls it Machagistia, and says that the Kings of
Persia learned it, as a knowledge of divine mysteries, wherein by the worlds
commonwealth, they were instructed to govern their own. Others, as they were
led by differing affection, do as much discommend them. And truly (as in the
Chaldaean and Egyptian Priests) their searching out the mysteries of Nature
can not but deserve commendation, but their abusing this natural Philosophy
to unnatural conspiracy with devils, cannot but be detested of those which
are not themselves detested of God. And either from this deuilish conspiracy,
or ouer-curious vanity, did arise their predictions of future events: in which
respect the Ethnikes had them in high reputation. Ammianus Marcellinus, Am.
Marcel. lin.l. 23.
says that Zoroastres added much to this Art from the Chaldaean mysteries, and
Hystaspes, the father of Darms, from the Brachmanes, which he in his Indian
travels had found in a woodie solitariness, and learned of them the motions of
the Scarres, and pure rites of sacrifices: which he taught the Magi, and they,
together with the skill of divination, delivered to their posterity by
tradition: and that progeny is always consecrated to divine services, and keep
continually burning certain fire which first came from heaven; a small portion
whereof was wont to be carried before the Kings of Asia. There were but a few
of them at the first: and it was unlawful to touch the sacrifice, or approach
to the Altar, before the Magus with a certain set speech had powered on his
sacred preparatiue liquors. Afterward being increased in number, they grew
into an entire Nation, and inhabited unwalled towns, being governed by their
own laws, and honored for religion.

That which he tells of the Chaldaean, and Indian original of their
Science, Proves it to be such as used unlawful prognosticatings, which the
Scripture affirms of the Chaldaeans, and Philostratus Philostratus de vita
Apollony.
of the Indians, whose History of Apollonius (a Pythagorean) shows, that he
was not little infected with this vanity, traveling as Pythagoras had done
to learn the same in foreign Regions. And although some commend one sort of
Magia, as being their Theology and Philosophy, yet seeing their Philosophy
was corrupted with curiosity, and their Theology with superstitious
Idolatry, it could not be free from some kind of implicit forcerie, as the
examples of those Apollonius, Hosthanes, Chavondas, Democritus, and Pythagorici
and Platonici.
which were most eminent herein, do show. Such an one Pases was, who by
enchantments would make shows and resemblances of sumptuous feasts, with many
attendants: and had a Magical Suidas hence came the Proverb. (...)
or enchanted halfe-penny, which would return to him again, when he had
bought any thing therewith.

The Magi had one chief amongst them in their Society, called by Sozomene,
Sozom.l.2.c.9
Priuceps magorum. Cicero Cicero de diuinat.l.1.
affirms that none might be Kings in Persia, before they had learned the
discipline of the Magi; neither was it any more lawful for every one to be a
Magus, then to be a King: Such was their estimation in Persia. Strabo Strabo l.
15. Nam Magus ex matre and gnato gignatur oportet ( says Catullus) Sivera eft
Persarum impiareligio.
tells that they used carnal company with their mothers: and when they are
dead are cast forth unburied, to be a prey to the Birds. The Ostanoe, and
Astrampsychi are by Suidas reckoned successors of the Magi. One Gramay Per
sica.
Sect of them lived only on meal and Herbs. Pausanias Pausan.l 6.
reports that in Lydia, in the Cities Hierocesarea, and Hypaepo, he saw
Temples having Persian surnames, and in every of those Temples, Chapel and
Altar, whereon was Ashes not like in color to the ordinary sort. The Magus
entering into the room, lays dry wood on the Altar, after that he has set
his mitre on his head, and then at the name of a certain God, sings
barbarous hymns (which the Greeks understand not) out of the book: which
being done, the heap is fired, and the flame breaks forth. Diogenes Laertius
Diog.La^rt.de vit.Philos.l.1.
relates, that these Magi spent their time in the service of their Gods,
offering unto them prayers and sacrifices, as if none but they might be heard:
they disputed of the substance and generation of the Gods, whom they reckoned
to be the Fire, Water, and Earth. They reprehended Images, especially such as
made a differing sex of Male, and Female, among the Gods. They discoursed of
justice. To burn their dead bodies, they held it impious: but to lie with
their own mothers, or daughters, they accounted lawful. They practiced
diuinations, and fore-tellings, affirming that the Gods appeared to them, that
the air was full of forms (...)
or shapes, which subtly and as it were by euaporation, infuse themselves
into the eyes. They forbade outward ornaments, and the use of Gold. Their
garments were white, the ground their bed, Herbs, Cheese, and bread their
food. Aristotle says, that they held two beginnings, a good spirit and an
evil, calling the one Jupiter and Oromasdes: the other Pluto and Arimanius (
Empedocles Empedocles.
translated this plant into Philosophy, and long after, Manes father of the
Manichees.
Manes a Persian herelike into divinity.) Theopompus adds these opinions of
theirs; That men should again be restored to life, and become immortal, and
that all things consisted by their prayers; Hecateus, that the Gods were
begotten: Clearchus, that the Gynmosophista descended from the Magi. Thus far
Diogenes.

Plutarch Plut. de Osir. and Is.
in his Treatise de Osir. and Isid. cites, approves and applies the opinion
of the Magi unto many others, which they conceived touching their two
beginnings, Arimanius and Orimazes: For whereas they saw such a mixture of
evil in every good (which made Solomon to brand them all with the title of
vanity) they gathering that good could not be either cause or effect of evil,
found out this remedy worse the^ the disease, to hold two Authors of all
things, calling Orimazes a God; and Arimanius, the fountain of evil, a
devil; the one cause of light: the other of darkness. Betwixt these two they
placed Mithres as Mediator or Intercessor. Zoroastres was author of this
opinion. To the first of these was praise and vows offered: to the later
mournful devotions. For, rubbing a certain herb called Omomi, they call on
Dis Pater and Orcus, then they wash it with the blood of slain Wolf, and carry
it into a shadowy place, where they power it out. They assign plants partly to
the good, partly to the bad God: as they do also quick creatures; the earthly
creatures to the good, the watery to the bad, and therefore esteem him happy
that has killed most of them. Oromazes, say they, begotten of pure light, and
Arimanius the child of darkness, war one against another. The first created
six Gods, Benevolence, Truth, Polity, Wisdom, Riches, Honest delight: the
later as many contrary. When Oromazes had thrice enlarged himself, he was as
far beyond the sun, as the sun is from the earth, and formed the stars:
Of which, one he fixed as a Gardiau and watchman, the dog-starre: he made
other four and twenty Gods, which he closed in an Egg. Arimanius did as much,
but his four and twenty brake their shell. And so became good things and evil
mingled. But a fatal time shall come, when Arimanius the Author of plague and
samine shall perish, and then shall be one society of all mankind in
happiness, using but one language. Theopompus says, according to their
opinion, that one of these Gods shall reign three thousand years, the other
being discomfited; and other three thousand they shall fight and labor to
destroy one another: at last Dis Pater shall be destroyed, and men shall be
happy. This opinion of the Magi, the Chaldeans have applied to their
Astronomy; in the seven Planets, making two good, two bad, three indifferent:
The Graecians, to their Jupiter, Dis Pater and Harmonia: Empedocles to his
Friendship and Discord: Aristotle to his Forma and Priuatio. Pythagoras to his
One and Two: Plato to his Idem and Alterum: Manes to his deuilish haeresie, as
before is said.

Only Persians, says Gramay Asia^
Gramay, were chosen into their number. The name Magi, is among Authors applied
also to the Chaldaeans, which in Babylon professed the same arts and
superstitions; the disciples (says Luciani Necrom.
Lucian) of Zoroastres, of whose cunning in charms you may read in his
Necromantia, a pleasant discourse: Mithrobarzanes a Chaldaean Magus. and
Menippus, whom he washes nine and twenty days in Euphrates by the Moon, and
in the morning sets him against the rising Sun, with long charms: after that
spitting three times in his face, he brings him back again not once looking
aside. Their meat was Acornes, their drink Milk, Mulse, and the water of
Choaspi, their lodging on the wide field on the grass. After all this he
brought him about midnight to Tygris, where washing him, he purifieth him with
a Torch, and the herb squilla, and other things, etc. which howsoever Lucian
suteth to his scoffing, yet I have inserted, as somewhat expressing their
superstitions observed in charming and diuinations.

Leaving these Magi, let us take view of the Persian religious rites which
Herodotus. Lib.1.
Herodotus thus describes. The Persians neither erect Images, nor Altars, nor
Temples, and impute it to madness in such as do: therefore as I think,
because they are not of the Greeks opinion, that the Gods have arisen from
men. Their custom is, ascending up the highest hills to offer sacrifices to
Jupiter, calling the whole circle of heaven Jupiter. They sacrifice to the
Sun, and Moon, and Earth, to the Fire, and Water, and Winds: to these only
have they accustomed to sacrifice from the beginning. They sacrifice also to
Urania, which they have learned of the Assyrians, and Arabians. The Assyrians
call Venus, Mylitta; the Arabians, Alitta; the Persians, Metra.

Their rites in sacrificing are these. Being to sacrifice, they neither set up
Altar, nor kindle fire, nor use vestments, pipes, cakes, or libaments: but he
which intends to sacrifice, placing the sacrifice in a clean place, calls
upon that God, wearing their Tiara The attire of the head, among the Persians,
as the Turbant among the Turks.
girded about with myrtle. The sacrificer prays not for himself alone, but
generally for all Persians, and especially for the King. And after that the
sacrifice is cut into small pieces, he streweth under the sodden flesh, small
herbs, chiefly trifoly; and setting the flesh in order thereon, the Magus
standing by sings Theog^^a.
some hymns (of the generation of the Gods) which they hold to be a most
effectual enchantment. Without one of their Magi no sacrifice is accounted
lawful. After all this, the sacrificer uses the flesh at his pleasure.

Of all days every man accounts his own birthday to be most solemnly
observed: and then makes greatest cheer. The richer sort then set whole
Beeues, Camels, Horses, Asses, baked in an Oven or furnace, on the Table: the
poorer, smaller beasts. The Persians are small eaters: but in their drinking
consult of the weightiest affairs. Of which they deliberate fasting, but
pronounce sentence after they are well in drink. To vomit or make water
openly, is unlawful to them. Those that are aequall, salute when they meet
each other with a mutual kiss; which is fastened on the cheek only, if
they be of unequal degree. They hold themselves the best of all men, their
neighbors so much better, how much nearer them they dwell. They are much
addicted to Venery with both sexes. Next unto Martial valor, they repute
excellent the procreation of many Children; the King allowing annual presents
to him who has begotten most Children, and therefore they use many women. The
child comes not in his fathers sight till he be five years old, but lives
with the women, that if he die before, his father should thence conceive no
grief. From that time till he be twenty, he learneth three things, to ride, to
shoot, to speak truth. For to lie is with them the most shameful thing; the
second, to be in debt. For one fault only no man ought to be punished.
Whatsoever is not mere to be done, ought not to be spoken. A Leprous person
if he be a Citizen may not enter into the City, nor have any society with
men: for this disease is sent (say they) for some offense against the Sun: if
he be a forrenner, they banish him out of their Region, and for the same
cause carry into that Region white Pigeons. In a River they neither spit, nor
make water, nor wash, but have them in very religious veneration. These things,
says Herodotus, I can affirm of the Persians out of mine own knowledge: that
which follows I do not so well know; that they bury not their dead bodies
before they be torn of some foul, or dog: but I well know that their Magi
do wrap them up in wax and then bury them. These Magi differ both from other
men, and from the Egyptian Priests in this, that these pollute themselves with
the death of nothing but their sacrifices, but the Magi with their own hands
kill any thing: except a man and a dog: yea, they esteem it some great
exploit if they have killed very many Ants or Serpents, or other things which
creep or fly. Thus far Herodotus. Strabo Libr.11.

Emperors had overthrown the These Goropius with Dutch Etymologies, and

Sacae, they encompassed with a wall a certain rock situate in a field. and
erecting a Temple of the foresaid Gods, there instituted yearly solemnities,
named Saca, which of the inhabitants of Zela are yet celebrated, (so they call
the place.) That town in great part belongs to them which are called Sacred
servants, to which Pompey added a great country. Some report that Cyrus,
having overcome the Sacae, attributing this victory to divine power,
consecrated that day to his countrey-Goddesse, naming is Sacaea, and
wheresoever the Temple of that Goddess is, there also are celebrated those
Sacaean feasts, in manner of the Bacchanals, day and night, the men and women
drinking themselves drunken. Strabo in the end of the same eleventh book
mentions their Temples, and amongst others the Temples of Tanais, which
before in Herodotus is denied to be the use of the Persians: Stra.l.15.
Cicero blames the Magi, for procuring Xerxes to burn all the Temples of
Greece, because they included their Gods in walls, and to whom the whole world
was a Temple and house. Cic.de leg.l.2.
Strabo thus reports of the Persians: The Persians have neither Images nor
Altars: they sacrifice in a high place, they think heaven to be Jupiter: they
worship the Sun, whom they call Mithra, the Moon also and Venus, and the
Fire, and the Earth, and the Winds, and the Water: they sacrifice in a clean
place, and present their sacrifice crowned: and when as Magus, the ruler of
this business, has divided the flesh in pieces to every one, they go their
ways leaving no part thereof to the Gods, who (say they) are satisfied with
the soul of their sacrifice. Some, as it is reported, lay a part of the
Numbles on the fire. They sacrifice especially to the Fire, and to the Water,
laying on the fire dry sticks, the barks pulled off, and laying thereon fat
Tallow, and pouring on the same, Oil, they kindle the same, not blowing with
their breath, but fanning or otherwise enforcing the wind thereto. If any
blows the fire, or cast any dead thing or dirt therein, he is punished with
death. They perform their Water-ceremonies in this sort: Coming to a Lake, or
River, or Fountain, they make a ditch, and there slay a sacrifice, with great
heed that none of the next water be touched with the blood: after, laying the
flesh on myrtle and Laurel, the Magi burn the same with small twigges, and
making certain prayers, sprinkle oil mixed with Milk and Honey, not in the
fire or water, but on the earth. They are a long while muttering their prayers,
holding a bundle of small Tamarisketwigges.

In Cappadocia, where is very great store of the Magi, which (of the Fire) are
called Pyrethi, and many Temples of the Persian Gods, they slay not the
Sacrifice with a knife, but a Clubbe or Mallet, wherewith they beat it. The
Pyretheia are great enclosed places, in the midst whereof there is an Altar:
Thereon the Magi keep much ashes, and a fire continually burning, whither they
every day resort, and make their prayers about an hours space, holding a
bundle of twigges before the fire, having their heads covered with a kind of
labelled Mitre, hanging down on both sides, that the strings cover their
lips. These things are done in the Temples of Anaitis and Amanus. For there
are their Temples, and there the Image of Amanus is carried in procession.
These things we have seen. It seems, that whereas Herodotus reports they
had no Temples, Altars, nor Images: and Strabo so often mentions their
Temples, and here the Altar and Image of Amanus; that in Herodotus days they
had none: which grew afterward in use, as a foreign rite brought in amongst
the Persians after the Macedonians had conquered them; or else that there were
differing Sects among their Magi, some (as these in Cappadocia) embracing
Altars, Images, and Temples, some refusing some or all of these. For otherwise
Strabo disagreeth not only from Herodotus, but from himself, before denying
them the use of Altars and Images, and here affirming it of the Cappadocian
Magi (in other things) of the Persian Religion.

We may further add (from Gramay Gram. As. Persica.
his Collections out of diverse Authors, and from others, concerning the Persian
Religion) that they sometime observed the Grecian Deities, calling Jupiter,
Bell; Hercules, Sands; Venus, Anaitis. To Jupiter was sacred a Chariot with a
Beam of gold. The Sun they worshipped (by the name of Mithra, and Eldictus)
at Sunne-rising: and adored also the painted Image thereof. They accounted the
horse the Suns peculiar beast, and offered unto him white horses: and with
white horses his sacred Chariot was drawn before the King, when he
sacrificed. Over Q Curt.lib.3.
Darius his tabernacle, the Image of the Sun, enclosed in Cristall, shone
forth so that it might be seen of all. The order also of Darius his march,
when he warred against Alexander, had in the first place their Fire, which they
called Sacred and Eternal, carried on silver Altars. Next hereunto the Magi,
singing their Countrey-Hymnes, followed by three hundred sixty and five
yong-men, (so many as their year had days) clothed in bright red. Then came
Jupiters Chariot, drawn by white horses: after whom followed a horse, of
exceeding greatness, consecrated to the Sun. Their Riders had white
garments, and golden Rods. Likewise, both sides of the Kings Chariot were
adorned with Images of gold and silver: two being most eminent among them; the
one, of Peace, the other, of War.

That soldier, which was initiated in Mithra's hallowed orders, was first
proved by foure-score several kinds of punishment: and if he continued
steadfast, he was washed, putting on his head a Tertul de Ceron.mil.t.
Crown with a Sword interposed. Chaste virgins were hallowed the Suns
Priests. They worshipped Diana whom they called Nannea, (as some will have it)
in that history of 2.Mac.1.13
Antiochus. They solemnized certain feasts, the chief whereof was that of
Mithra. Another holy day they called the Destruction Athenaeus l.12
of vices, in which the Magi killed venomous things, and offered; and the
servants lorded it five days together, ruling both the family and their
masters. Their Kings birth-daies they did also solemnize, making therein a
banquet called Lycta: at which time the King might not deny any thing to any
sinter. Magophonia they celebrated in memory of the Magi slain by Darius
Histaspis, and his Colleagues. Of their holieday Saca before is spoken: in
which (some report, that) the servants changed offices and garments with their
Masters. Minutius Foelix Min. Foel. Octau. Arnob.con.Gent.lib.6.
obiecteth against them their incestuous copulation with their mothers.
Arnobius derideth their worshipping of Rivers. The Christian Fathers and
heathen Authors are plentiful in the narration of the Persian vanities.
Eusebius Eusebius. de praepar.lib.6.c.8.
cites a saying of Bardesanes Syrus; Among the Persians there was a Law to
marry their sisters, daughters, and mothers: which custom the Persians
observed also in other Countries, and therefore other nations hating them,
called them Maguss^^i; of which are many in Egypt, Phrygia, and Galatia, whose
posterity succeeds them in the same wickedness. This name Magussoei is derived
of Magi.

CHAP. VI.
Of the alterations of the State and Religion in Persia, under the Saracens.

THe Saracens (as is already showed) a people bred, as it were, of putrefaction
in that corrupt estate of the World, dispossessed of his stato and life
Ormisdas the last Persian King. Their Religion had sustained small alteration
in Persia before this time, for aught I find, saving what the Christian had in
these parts prevailed, (which belongs to another task.) But from that time
that the Saracens were Conquerours, the souls of the Persians have no less
been subject to those foolish Mahumetan superstitions then their bodies to
cruel slavery: yea the Curio Sara. histor.lib. 1. Blondus says, that Mahumet
was present at their first conquest, and that by his command they relinqu^shed
their name, and accepted the Saracen. dec. 1. libr.9.
name of Persian was drowned in the title of Saracens. Homar was then Caliph.
But when Iezid the son of Muavi was Priest and King (such are the Caliphs) of
the Saracens, Mutar, the Deputy or Governor of Persia, proclaimed himself a
Prophet, and seized on the state: from him the Persian Sophi deriueth his
original. When Iezid was dead, the Inhabitants of Cufa in Arabia proclaimed
Hocem the son of Ali, Caliph: but Abdalam the son of Iezid intrapped and
slew him: and at his Sepulcher was after erected the city Carbala. This Hocem
had twelve sons, Zeinal, Abadin, Zeinal Muamed, Bagner Muamed, Giafar
Cadeneg, Ciafar Musa, Cazin Musa, Hali Macerat, All Muamed Taguin, Muamed
Halmaguin, All Hacem Asquerin, Hacem Muamed Mahadin: This last Bar.
As.dec.2.lib.10.c.6.
the Persians say that he is not yet dead, but that he shall come sitting on a
horse, to preach their Law to all Nations: beginning in Massadalle where Ali
his grandfather lies buried. And therefore they have there always a horse
prepared ready, which in time of Divine Service, on a certain festival day,
they bring with Lights burning to the Temple in which Ali is buried, praying
him to send his nephew quickly. That day is solemnly celebrated with so great
concourse of people, as a Portugal there present said he had never seen the
like. The other eleven brethren were buried in diverse places. To return to
Mutar; Abdimelec one of the following Calipha's, sent Ciafa against him, by
whose overthrow that new Prophet wanne new and greater estimation then before.
But an other tyrant, Abdala Zubir, arising amongst the Saracens, sent his
brother Musub against Mutar, who slew Mutar, and was soon after slain
himself of Abdimelec, who recovered again that Province of Persia. Abdimelec
being dead, in the year seven hundred and two and twenty, Gizid his son
Curio Sarac. hist.lib.2.
succeeded, and an other Gizid usurped the Scepter in Persia, but was
overthrown by Masabner the Captain of Abdimelecs son.

In the reign of Marvan, Asmulin took on him the protection of Mutars Sect,
affirming Ali to be greater then Mahumet: he was Prince of the Corasens in
Persia, and by one Catabanus his counsel incited the servants, by force or
treachery, to kill their Masters: and these being grown great by their
Masters wealth were divided into two factions, the Caisms, and the Lamonites.
Asmulin Captain of the Lamonites destroyed the Caismi: and with his Lamonites,
and Catabanus, invaded Persia, and were there incountred by Iblinus the
Lieutenant with an army of an hundred thousand men; but the Lamonites by the
encouragement of Asmulin and Catabanus (whom they reckoned holy men)
discomfited him and his; and after incountred Marvan himself with three
hundred thousand men, and made him to flee with four thousand into Egypt,
where Salin the son of Asmulin overthrew him. Thus the Maruanian race being
expelled (the relics whereof settled themselves in Fesse and Spain) Asmulin,
from whom the family of the Sophi descends, with Catabanus reigned over the
Saracens.

By this which has bin said, appears a continual difference betwixt the
Persians, and other Saracens about their Religion; either (as some affirm) for
that the Persians preferred Ali to Mahumet, or for that (which is more likely)
they accounted Ali, and not any of the other three ( Eubocar, Osmen, or Homar)
to be the true successor of Mahumet. The Sultans or Deputies of Persia, which
governed there under the Chaliph, used that their schismatic fancy, as they
saw occasion to their own ambitious designs, under color of Religion. Among
the rest Muamet or Mahumet is famous, who being hardly beset for the like cause
by his Master, the Chaliph of Bagadet, required aid, (as before is more
largely showed) Libr.3.ca.8^
of the Turkish Nation then wandering in part of Armenia, called of them
Turcomania, who sent him for his succor three thousand Turks under the
leading of Tangrolipix, by whose help Pisasiris the Califa was overthrown.
And after this he obtained both the Sultanship of Persia, in the year of our
LORD, 1030. and also slew Pisasiris, and enjoyed that sovereignty: Knolies.
from thenceforth the Califa's of Bagadet being stripped of their temporalls,
but retayning still the places of Patriarchs of their Religion (as some relate)
even to this day. The Turks thus possessing the Persian royalty, and possessed
of the Persian superstitions, there reigned one hundred and seventy years,
the Tartars then chasing them out of Persia. For after Haithon de Tartar.
that Changis Can had founded that Empire, Hocota, or Occoda Can his successor
sent out his sons diverse ways with diverse armies with intent to subdue the
world, Iochi conquered Turquestan and Persia: and not long after Mango Can sent
Haolon his brother, who continued and prosecuted the Tartarian Conquests beyond
Phison or Tigris, subdewing the whole kingdom of the Persians, taking Baldach,
with the great Chalifa, whom he starued amiddest his treasure; beleagered a
Castle of the Assassini, with a siege of seven and twenty years, and then
taking the same by composition of the defendants, only for want of clothing: he
wanne Aleppo, and the kingdom of Syria, with Damascus the head City thereof:
and had intended also the Conquest of the Holy Land from the Saracens, if he
had lived; for both this Haolon and Mango the great Can were both Christians by
persuasion of Ait^on the Armenian King.

About this time in the North-East parts of Persia (which of this new heresy
they called Mulehet) there was an old man, named Aloadin, a Mahumetan (as all
those parts then were) which had enclosed a goodly Aloadins Paradise,
valley situate between two hills, and furnished it with all variety, which
Nature and Art could yield, as fruits, pictures, rilles of milk, wine, honey,
water, palaces, and beautiful damosells richly attired, and called it
Paradise. To which was no passage, but by an impregnable Castle. And daily
preaching the pleasures of this Paradise to the youths, which he kept in his
Court, sometimes would minister a sleepy drink to some of them, and then
conueigh them thither: where being entertained with these pleasures four or
five days, they supposed A right fools Paradise.
themselves rapt into Paradise. And then being again cast into a trance by the
said drink, he caused them to be carried forth; and then would examine them of
what they had scene, and by this delusion would make them resolute for any
enterprise, which he should appoint them; as to murder any Prince, his enemy.
For they feared not death, in hope of their Mahumeticall Paradise. But this M.

this of Aladeules in the time of Zelim the first. Abaga succeeded him in the
government of these parts, anno 1264, but not in the Christian religion:
Tangodor the next, became a Saracen, and called himself Mahomet, and at Tauris
and other places destroyed the Churches of the Christians, as Haolon had done
of the Saracens: he banished the Christians, and perverted as many Tartars as
he could to Mahumetisme. But Argonus the son of Ahaga rebelled, and taking
him, cut him asunder in the middle, succeeding in his place, anno 1285. after
him Regayto whom the Tartars slew, placing in his steed Baydo a christian, who
forbad the preaching of Mahumetism among the Tartars, and reedified the
Churches of the Christians: Casan succeeded in his dominion and devotion: and
after his death Carbaganda, who in his childehood had been baptized, and named
Nicholas, but when his Christian mother was dead, he became a Saracen.

Thus far out of Haithonus; in which history appears the vicissitude of
diverse Religions, sometime Tartarian, sometime Christian, sometime Mahumetan,
as in the Princes who governed these Countries under the great Cham or Can of
the Tartars: so also no doubt in a great part of the Countries themselves,
which usually are of the Kings religion. This Carbaganda, reigning about 1305,
is the last Tartar Prince which ruled in these parts; for as their religion, so
also their Empire failed; the Egyptian Soldans preuayling in Syria; the
Ottoman Turks, in Asia; and Gempsas, in Persia. This Gempsas was Sultan of the
Parthians: and about the year 1350. restored that Persian kingdom to the
Parthians. From him descended the Peucerus lib.4.^ 5.
Persian Kings to Malaonchres, who being taken away by fraud, Vsun Cassan
succeeded. Yet was not the Persian state so settled in Gempsa his posterity,
but that Great Tamerlane subdewed the same unto himself, which his son after
lost again. This Tamerlane some report to have bin of mean parentage; others,
of royal descent, and Michouius, libr.1. cap.8. deriueth him from Baths, one
of the greatest Conquerors among the Tartars.

Vsuncassan (called also Assymbe^^^) deprived the Sultan of Parthia and Persia
of his life and kingdom: his name is by some Malaonchres; by others, De^^^:
but Ambrosio Contarini, and Iosapha Barbaro (which both were in Persia with
Vsuncassan) call him Iausa. In the year 1478. died Vsuncassan; and his son
lacob succeeded, whose wife, bearing dishonest affection to one of the court,
sought by the murder of her husband to advance this Courtier to her husbands
bed and empire. And Viaggio di mercante apud Ramus.
having conueighed venime into a golden Cup presents her husband the same to
drink, who somewhat suspecting her, caused her to begin; himself and his
son following her both in drinking and dying. And thus was Persia, by the
wickedness of one woman, made the stage of civil wars, whiles the chief
Nobles sought each to possess himself of the state, which at last, after five
or six years war befell to Alumut or Elvan-beg, then being but fourteen
years old, who was slain by Ismael in the year 1499.

The history of Ismael, because it gives much light both into the state and
religion of Persia, is more fully to be reported. When as Mustacen Mumbila the
Chaliph of Bagdet had been by the Tartars done to death, in the year after
Haithonus account 1258 (about the year 1369) there arose in Persia I.P.B.par.2
l.2 Osor ^ere. Em. libr. ^^. Surius Comment. Knolles T.histor. page 464.
a noble man called Sophi, lord of the City Ardouil, reporting himself to be
of the blood of All or Hali, descended from Musa Cazin, or Cersin one of the
twelve sons, (as is said) of Hocem.

Guinue his son (otherwise written, Ginni, Guine, and Giunet) maintained his
Sect after him. Minadoi Minidoi lib. 2
says, That Sexehiuni, or more distinctly, Serec Ginnet, was Author of the
Persian sect, who under the name of Sofi is by Minadoi derived of Sofiti, a
people subdewed by Alexander.
Sofi, and of Siec, (that is, of a wise man, and an Author of Religion) or
rather under the pretense of holiness, began to persuade the people, that the
3 first successors of Mahomet were usurpers, only Ali ought to be named
lawful successor, and ought to be called upon in their prayers, and by all
means to be honored. From this time forward the Sepulcher of Ali and his sons
in Cafe grew in great credit, and was visited every year after the same sort
that the Turks visit the Sepulcher of the other three: and the Kings of Persia
used there to be crowned, and girt with their sword, and their great Calife
there kept his residence. Because this Cafe was near Babylon, hence grew the
common error, that these things were done at Babylon or Bagdet. Ionius also is
deceived, where he makes Arduelle or Aidere, author of the Persian faction.
This Persian superstition was brought in by Giunet the Sofi, afterward
maintained by Siec Sederdin, and after him by Siec Ginnet the second, then by
Siec Aider called by Ionius, Arduelle, and at last increased and enlarged by
Ismael and his successors. Ismael renewed or continued the name Sofi or Sofiti:
but his successors leaving that, and the name of Siec, have retained only the
title of Saha, which some write Shaugh, some Xa, a royal title communicated by
the head of this superstition to those Kings which participate with them
therein. Joseph Scaliger Scal.Can.Isag.libr.3.
says, that Sa or Seha is the same with Monsieur among the French, and Don
among the Spaniards. The Jews and Arabians write it (...): It is sometimes set
before the name, as in the present King Scha Habas; sometime comes after, as
Melixa for Melic-scha. Barrius Io.Bar.Asia.dec.2.li.10.c.6.
begins this pedegre at the father of Giunet, or Guine (so he calls him) and
not as Minadoi, with Guinet himself. He adds, That for the Ensign,
Character, or Cognizance of his Sect, he ordained, that in the midst of their
Turbant, (which they wear with many folds) there should arise a sharp top, in
manner of a Pyrainis, divided into twelve parts; (in remembrance of Ali his
twelve sons) from the top to the bottom. They used the color red on their
heads (says Minadoi) by ordinance of Arduelle, and therefore were called
Cheselbas, that is, Red-heads, some write it Cuselbas. Guine (as Barrius
affirms) was holden in such reputation of holiness by Tamerlane, that he came
to visit him as a Saint; and at his request, set free 30000. slaves, which he
had taken in the wars against Bajazet. These slaves became his disciples
first, and after soldiers to his son Aidar against the Christian Georgians.

This Surius Com. Knoll.T.Hist. page.464.
Aidar Erdebil (or after I^vius, Harduelles,) forsaking (as some say) the
world, led a straight life in continency and austerity, and was therefore
admired as a Prophet, and resorted to out of all parts of Armenia and Persia
coming to Tauris to see him: He inueighed against the common opinion
concerning Mahomets successors, as Guinne and Sophi had done, shutting up
heaven to all, saving Hali his followers. For so the Persians use to say in
their prayers; Cursed be Ebubeker, Omar, and Osman: God be favorable to Hali,
and well pleased with him. Vsuncassan moved with his fame, gave him in marriage
his daughter Martha begot of the Christian Lady Despina, daughter of Calo
Ioannes emperor of Trapezoned; both of them by this alliance strengthening
themselves against the Turk. Aider had by this Mar^ha, Ismael, whom she
trained up in the principles of Christian Religion. Jacob, successor of
Vsuncassan, jealous of the multitude of Aiders disciples, and the greatness of
his fame, caused him to be secretly murdered; persecuting all his professed
followers with fire and sword. Ismael then a child fled into Hircania to one
Pyrchales, a friend of his fathers, who afterward aided him to the recovering
of his patrimony. Boterus says, That Jacob, after the murder of Aidar,
committed his two sons, Ismael and Solomon, to Amanzar (a Captain of his) to
be conueighed to Zalga, a strong mountainy place: but he brought them up
liberally with his own children, and in his last sickness, gave them horse and
two hundred ducats, with advise to repair to their mother; where taking upon
him the protection of the sect of Hali, and the revenge of his fathers death,
his enterprises succeeded prosperously. Cap.11.
Gionan Maria Angiolello says, That Jacob being poisoned 1485, the seigniorie
was possessed by a kinsman of Jacobs called Iulauer, after whose ^. years
reign succeeded Baysingir two years; after, Ru^tan seven years, who sent
Solimanbec against Sechaidar the father of Ismael, who made challenge to the
state in right of his wife the daughter of Vsuncassan, who slew him in the
field. Rustan would also have killed the mother and her sons, had not entreaty
of his nobles prevented it. He committed them to ward in the Island of the
Armenians in the lake Astumar; whither the sent for them again after three
years, but they for fear fled to Ardovill, and there lived closely for a
time. Rustan was slain by Agmat through his mothers procurement, who loved
that Agmat, who abode Sultan five months, and was slain by Rustans soldiers.
And Alvan the kinsman of Vsuncassan was Seignior, whom Ismael slew.

A certain Merchant who abode a long time in Tauris, and traveled through the
most part of Persia (skillful of the Turkish, Persian, and Arabian languages,
either seeing himself, or learning of them which did see) in the time of
Ismael, relates this History somewhat otherwise, Ramusius:
whom, as learning of the Persians themselves the Persian affairs, we may
reckon worthy to be followed, says, That this Sechaidar in Ardovil was the
head of this Sophian Sect, and had three sons and three daughters by the
daughter of Vsuncassan. He was a zealous enemy against the Christians,
oftentimes with his followers repairing into Circassia, doing the people much
damage, which when in the days of Sultan Alumut he attempted as before times,
he was by Alumuts order forbidden at Darbent further passage: but seeking to
make way by force, he was by the forces of Alumut taken, and his head, on the
top of a lance, presented to Alumut, and by his command, given to the
dogs to be eaten; the cause why the Sophians are such enemies unto dogs,
killing all they find. This news coming to Ardouill, his three sons fled,
one into Natolia, another to Aleppo, Ismael the third to an Island in the lake
of Van, in which is a city of Christian Armenians, where he abode four years
in the house of an Armenian priest, being then about thirteen years old, who
used him courteously, and instructed him in the rudiments of Christian Religion.
A year after he went from Arminig to Chillan, where he kept with a Goldsmith
his fathers friend. In this time he had intelligence, by mutual writing, with
his friends at Ardouil: and with this Goldsmith having gathered together
eighteen or twenty men of their Sect secretly to take a strong castle, called
Maumutaga, and hidden in ambush two hundred horsemen of his friends in Ardouil,
suddenly slaying the guard, and possessing himself of the Castle, he entered a
Town not far from the Castle, killing the inhabitants, and carrying the
spoil to the Castle. This Castle was very rich, because it was a principal
Haven of the Caspian Sea; and so strong, that when Alumut had news hereof, he
was dissuaded from sending any power thither to besiege him. Two days journey
from hence is Sumachi: which with his power, now increased, he also took, and
divided the spoils every where to his soldiers, which with fame of this
liberality came from all parts unto him. He sent also into Hiberia, three or
four days journey from thence, which was then governed by seven great Lords,
three of which, Alexander Sbec, Gorgurambec, and Mirzambec, with many promises
of present spoils and future exemptions from tribute, he won to his side,
receiving from each of them three thousand horse, so that he was now grown
fifteen or sixteen thousand strong. Alumut with thirty thousand valiant
soldiers went to meet him between Tauris and Sumachia, and having passed a
great river, over which were two Bridges, he presently caused them to be
broken: Ismael arriving there the next day, with great diligence found a
passage through the stream, and with his whole forces, in front, in the break
of the day, assailed Alumut his army, little suspecting such a good morrow,
that Alumut with a few companions hardly escaped. The pauilions, horses, and
other booty, Ismael bestowed on his soldiers: and then hasted to Tauris,
where entering without resistance, he made great slaughter, killing all the race
of Jacob, opening his Sepulcher, and the Graves of other noblemen, which had
bin at the battle of Darbent against his father, and burning their bones; 300
harlots he caused to be cut asunder in the middle: he killed all the dogs in
Tauris, and because his mother had married to one of those nobles which were in
the battle of Darbent, he caused her head to be stricken off in his presence.
In this while many towns, cities, castles, and Lords submitted themselves to
him, and ware his red-coloured Turbant: but the Castle Alangiachana (whereto
were subject eighteen villages of Christians, which used yearly to send to Rome
two men from the Patriarch to the Pope, of whose faith they were, speaking
Armonian, having some books, but quite lost the use of the Italian language)
this castle (I say) held out for Alumut until his death.

While Ismael was Sultan in Tauris, the Sultan in Bagadet Murat Can son of
Jacob, with an army of 30000. marched against him, and in a plain meeting with
Ismael was there overthrown, not 70. persons escaping to Bagadet with Murat
Can: the place bearing witness of the slaughter, buried under many new hills of
bones. All these things were done anno 1499. And while I was in Tauris, many
came from Natolia, Caramania, and Turkey to serve him; of whom they were
graciously entertained, Anno 1507. our Author being then in Malacia saw with
his eyes, the Sultan Alumut conveyed prisoner by Amirbec, who with four
thousand men going from Mosul (sometime Niniue) to Amit, where the Sultan kept,
with promise and profession of his succor, being admitted the city, took him,
and cast a chain about his neck, whose head Ismael smote off with his own
hands. He was presented to him by Amirbec in the country of Aladuli, against
whom Ismael was now warring: where taking the city Cartibirt, he cut off the
head of Becarbec son of Aladuli lord thereof with his own hands. From thence
returning to Tauris he had almost done as much to his two brethren, whom he
had left Governors in his absence, for transgressing their Commission, but
with much entreaty of his Lords, spared their lives, yet confined them to
Ardouill, not to depart from thence. The next year he pursued Murat Can, who
was come to Syras, a City not inferior to Cairo in Egypt, with six and
thirty thousand men, but male content, and therefore many of them fleeing unto
Ismael. Whereupon Murat Can sent two Ambassadors with five hundred followers,
with offer of Vassallage unto him. Ismael cut them all in pieces, saying, That
if Murat can would be his Vassal, he should come in person, not by Embassage.
Muratcan had closely sent Spies to observe the sequel of his business, and
being hereof by them advertised, fled: For many of his Nobles had already
put on the red Turbant, of whom he feared to be taken, as Alumut had been;
and therefore with three thousand of his most faithful he fled unto Aleppo:
but the Sultan of Cairo not admitting him, he went to Aladuli, who entertained
him honorably, and gave him his daughter to wife.

Ismael, after great slaughters in Siras and Bagadet, was forced to return to
Spaan with his Army. For Ieselbas the Tartar had taken all the Country of
Corasan, and the great City of Eri, which is in compass betwixt forty and
fifty miles, well peopled, and full of Merchandise: He had taken also Strava,
Amixandaran, and Sari, on the Caspian shore; and with intent to beguile Ismael,
desired leave to pass through is Country to Mecca on Pilgrimage. Ismael with
denial, and other sharp words; repelled his suit, and abode a year in Spaan,
to withstand his enterprises. After he returned to Tauris, where were great
Triumphs solemnized in his honor. This Sophi is so loved and feared (says
this Merchant) that they hold him as a God, especially his soldiers: of which,
some go into the wars without Armor, holding it sufficient, that Ismael
will succor them: others, because they content themselves to die for Ismael,
go into battle with naked breast, crying, Schiack, Schiack, i. GOD, GOD. And
they forget the name of GOD, always naming Ismael: they hold, That he shall not
die, but live ever. And where other Mosulmans say, La ylla yllala, Mahamet
resullalla, the Persians say, Laylla yllala, Ismael vellilalla; reputing him a
God and a Prophet. I have learned, that Ismael is not contented to be called or
worshipped as God. Their custom is to wear read Bonnets, with a certain
thing like girdle, large below, and straiter up wards, made with twelve foulds,
a finger thick, signifying the twelve Sacraments of their Sect, or those
twelve brethren, nephews of Ali, Ismael was of fair countenance, of
reasonable stature, thick and large in the soulders, shaven all but the
mustaches; left handed, stronger then any of his Nobles, but given to Sodomie.
At his second coming to Tauris, he caused to take twelve of the fairest boys
in the City to serve his lust, and after gave to each of his Nobles one for
the like purpose, and before took ten of the best men's sons for the same
intent.

Thus far have we had commerce with this namelesse Persian Merchant in
Ramusius his shop, Osorius de Reb. Emman. lib. 10. I.Bot.Ben.
who sometime attended on his Court and Camp. Others add hereunto, That he
sent Ambassadors to all the Mahumetan Princes of the East, to receive that
redde-Hat Ensign, together with his Sect; as did his son Tammas after him,
when Nizzamulucco only accepted thereof. But it is the common opinion, that
the greatest part of the Mahumetanes in Soria and of Asia Minor are secretly of
at Sect. Ismael after this warred, and won, upon the Zagatai Tartars, and
other adjacent Nations, that he left unto his successors a very great Estate,
Knol.Turk.Hist.
reaching from the Caspian Sea to the Persian, and between the Lake Iocco and
Tigris, the River Abbiam, and the Kingdom of Cambaya, more then twenty
degrees from East to West, and eighteen from North to South. He ordained a new
Liturgy, and form of Prayer, differing from the ancient. Such was his
authority, that they would swear, By the Head of Ismael, and bless in his
name, saying, Ismael grant the thy desire. Upon his Coin, on the one side,
was written, La illahe illalahu Muhamedun resulallahe: And on the other,
Ismaill halife Iullahe, that is, Ismael the Vicar of GOD. Surius Comm. in
An.1500.
The Jews, at the first, had this Ismael in such admiration, that they
foolishly reckoned Ismael to be their promised Messiah, gratulating themselves,
in this conceit, throughout the most part of Europe, celebrating feastiuall
Solemnities, with mutual Presents, in testimony of their joy; which yet was
soon dashed, none hating the Jews more then Ismael. He lies buried at
Ardouil, in a fair Meskit, with a sumptuous Sepulcher made by himself in his
life time; where is a fair Stone-Hospitall erected by him for strangers,
allowing to all travelers three days relief for horse and man freely. Ant.
Ienkinson.
Ardouil is in latitude 38. degrees.

The life of Ismael had been answerable to the bloody presages in his ominous
birth; Angiolello, c.13.
for he came forth of his mothers womb with both his hands shut, and full of
blood: for which cause his father would not have brought him up, but commanded
him to be slain: but they which carried him away, moved with compassion,
secretly nourished him three years, Ph.Camerar. Medit. Histor. Cent.2.c.4.
and after presented him to his father, who then acknowledged and received him
with love and kindness: for this his bloody and warre-like spirit dwelt in a
lovely and amiable body, adorned with all the Ensigns of beauty. He died
Anno 1524.

Ant. Ienkinson. Hak.t^.1.p.349.
So zealous he was of their superstition, that when M. Ienkinson came to his
Court with the Queens Letters to treat with him of Traffic and Commerce for
our English Merchants, before his feet touched the ground, a pair of the
Sophies own Shoes or Basmackes (such as himself used to wear, when he arose
in the night to pray) were put upon his feet, least their holy ground should be
polluted with Christian steps. And being admitted into his presence, and
asked of his Religion, Whether he were a Gower, that is, an Unbeliever, or a
Muselman (so they call them of their own profession) having answered, That he
was a Christian, believing CHRIST to be the greatest Prophet: Oh thou
unbeliever (said he) we have no need to have friendship with the unbelievers,
and so willed him to depart: which he did, and after him followed a man with a
Basanet of Sand, fifting all the way that he had gone within the said Palace,
even from the Sophies sight unto the Court-gate.

In his time Solomon (as in our Turkish Relations before is showed) much
endammaged the Persians, Lib.3.cap.8.
and took Babylonia, Tauris, and other parts of their dominions: yet did Tam^^
recover some part thereof again, and drove Solomon out of Tauris, (or
Ecbatana, as Minadoi Minadoi of the Wars between the Turks and Persians,
l.1.
interprets) and, by a composition, caused him to raze the Fort of Chars,
erected by the Turks in his frontiers. He died the eleventh of May, 1576,
leaving behind him eleven children: Mahamet the eldest, who had lived a while
in Heri (sometime called Aria) and after in Siras (aunciently named
Persepolis:) his second son was Ismahel, whom for his fierceness his father
had confined to the Castle Cahaca: the third, Aidere; the rest, Mamut,
Solimano, Mustaffa, Emanguli, Alichan, Amet, Abrahim, and Ismahel the younger.
He appointed his second son Ismahel his successor, esteeming him more
worthy then Mahamet Codabanda (this surname was given him for his diseased
eyes) as being given to a studious and quiet life, and contenting himself,
that Abas Mirize (which now reigns) was confirmed in the City of Heri, and
honored with the title of the Vizier of that Country.

Periaconcona, the daughter of Tamas, and elder then any of the brethren, being
in Commission with other Counselors of State to see her fathers Will executed,
whiles the Posts ran with aduertisements to Ismahel, was attempted by Aidere
with earnest solicitation for the Crown: whose ambitious desire she so far
satisfied, as that she caused him to be inuefted in Regal apparel, and
settled in the great Gallerie, attending the acclamation of the people; being
publicly installed, as though he were elected King. But mean while she set
sure gards of men, devoted to Ismahel, at the gates of the Palace; thus
purposing to entertain him (with dreams of dangerous honors) till Ismahel
arrived at Casbin. But whiles he (suspecting the deceit) sought to flee, he
left his head behind in the hands of Sahamal his uncle, which he cast,
all-bloudie, in the midst of his conspiring partakers. Ismahel soon after
came, and received with public applause the desired Sovereignty: and as he
had before addicted himself to the study of the Turkish Law; (enough, if it
had been known, to have barred his succession) so now, after the Turkish
manner, he foundeth his Throne (a foundation too slipperie to stand) in blood,
causing the heads of his eight younger brethren to be cut off, together with
all such as were near them in blood or affinity, and all the favorites of
the late slain Aidere. Turkish Parricide imitated in Persia.
Thus is Casbin dyed in the blood of her hopeful Gallants, and entertaines her
beholders eyes with streams of blood running from the slain, which cause
another stream of tears to issue from their living friends; who filling the
air with mournful complaints (which returning answer by Echoes, seemed to
sympathize their grief) and in compassion of those dying bodies, then gasping
their fatal breaths, imitating (with true affection, and not affected
imitation) the same in deep and broken sighs: viewing also their own dangers
in the present ruin of their nearest and dearest some-time allies and
acquaintance: tossed with this variety of turbulent passions, conceive, in
this confusion of thoughts (that which is truly the daughter and mother also of
confusion) Treacherous Disloyalty to the author of these their sorrows.
Ismahel posting on to his own destruction, had now forbidden the devotions of
Aly the Persian Prophet, and enjoined the Turkish Rites of Abubar, and other
the followers of Mahomet, by imprisoning, railing, pulling out the eyes, and
killing Aly his obseruants, establishing his Decree, not sparing, in this
persecution, to torment the tender Ladies (some of them of his own blood) nor
reuerencing age or profession, depriving even the Califfe of Casbin (the eye of
their blindness) of both his eyes, because he would not see equity in this
novelty; and purposing (as the Fame went) to go to Bagdat, there to receive
the Crown from him whomsoever he should find the successor of the great
Califfe, in the midst of his cruelties he was (with like cruelty) murdered
by Periaconcona. The Executor of her fathers Will is thus made an Executioner
of her fathers son, having brought in the conspirators, apparrelled in women's
weeds, to strangle him among his paramours. This was done the 24. of November
1577; after he had reigned one year, seven months, and six days. Mahomet
Codabanda thought it now time for him to look to his right, which by means of
Mirize Salma^, the chief of the Sultans, he obtained. This Sultan presented
him with the head of that Virago Periaconcona upon the top of a Lance, with
the disheuelled hair, ghastly looks, and bloody impressions, yielding an
uncouth (though not undeserved) spectacle to the beholders: De Medusa and
Megaera, vide Poetas.
which (if like the Snakie scalpe of Medusa it did not transform them into
stones, yet, as if it had been the banner of Megaera) seemed to display new
quarrels, kindling inward hatreds, tumultuous seditions, and civil broils,
which exposed them to Amuraths forces, who thought it fit time for him to fish
with his Turkish Nets in this troubled Persian stream. Of these wars is
already spoken Lib.3.c.8.
. Much loss did the Persians by this means sustain, and much more had
followed, had not Emir Hamze, Mahomets eldest son, with his valorous
attempts, stopped the Turkish proceedings, and, like the Eastern Sun, with
his greater brigtnesse dispersed those weaker beams of The Moonie Standards of
proud Ottoman. I. Silvest. in Du Bartas transl.


But soon was this Sun eclipsed, not by the Moons interposition (for that
is natural, if we understand it of the heavenly; and ordinary, if of the
earthly and Turkish) but by extraordinary and unnatural procurement (as was
thought) of his ambitious brother Abas, or of others suspected of his father,
effected by a treacherous Eunuch that guarded him; which suddenly struck him
through the body and slew him. Abas his brother by solemn oath cleared
himself of this odious imputation. And yet he is no less suspected of a more
monstrous and unnatural treachery against his own father, who is thought

to be poisoned by his means, that by these bloody steps he might ascend to
that throne which now he enjoys. But (all this notwithstanding) he has
since so subtly handled the matter, that he is both beloved of his own, and
feared of his enemy: his subjects swear and bless in his name. Cartwright.
An. 1603.
He has recovered from the Turk both Tauris, and other Regions of Servania
and Georgia, which the Turk had before taken from the Persians. He was
reported also to have taken Bagdat, bnt (it seems) not truly.

As for Tauris, in the year 1514, Selim took it (as some say) on composition,
which he brake, and carried thence three thousand of the best artificers to
Constantinople. An. 1535, Solomon gave it for a prey to his soldiers; An 1585,
Osman spoiled it with uncouth and inhumane cruelties; whatsoever the insulting
Conqueror, in the utmost extent of lawless lust, could inflict, or the
afflicted condition of the conquered could in the most dejected state of
misery sustain, was there executed. Abas in recovery here of used the Canon,
an Instrument which before they had, to their own loss, scorned. This Prince
is (says our Author) excellent both of composition of body, and disposition
of mind, of indifferent stature, stern countenance, piercing eyes, swart
color, his mustachees on the upper lippc long, his beard cut close to the
chinne. He delights in Hunting and Hawking, Running, Leaping, and trying of
Masteries: He is an excellent Horseman and Archer. In the morning he uses to
visit his stables of great Horses, and having there spent most of the
fore-noone, he returns to his Palace: About three of the clock in the
afternoon he goes to the At-Maidan, which is the high street of Hispaan, the
City of his residence, round about which are seaffolds for the people to sit
and behold the King and his Nobles at their Exercises of Shooting, Running,
Playing at Tennis, etc. all on horseback. In this place very often, in his
own person, he hears causes, and pronounces sentence, executing Justice
severely.

Now that we may mention some of the chief Cities of Persia (under which name
I here comprehend, as usually in this History, their Media, Gheilan,
Massandtan, or Hyrcania, Parthia, Aria, Candahar, Heri, Corassau, Farsi, or
Persia, with the Caramanian desert, and the Kingdom of Lar, and the Turcoman
nation are subject to this King: and lie has also subdued and ruined the
houses of some great men, which in his fathers days would do what they lift.
Dominion, not as it is measured by the Pens of Geographers, but by the
Swords of their Princes.) In Sumachia Master Cartwright says, They saw the
ruins of a cruel spectacle, which was a Turret erected with Freestone and
Flints, in the midst whereof were placed the heads of all the Nobility and
Gentry of the Country. A mile from this Town was a Nunnerie, wherein was
buried the body of Amalcke Canna, the Kings daughter, who slew her self with
a knife, for that her father would have forced her to marry a Tartarian
Prince: the Virgins of the Country resort hither once a year to lament her
death. Sechi is four days journey thence, not far from which is Eres,
which, because they yielded to the Turk, were by Emir-Ha^ie utterly destroyed,
man, woman, and child. Arasse is the chief City of Merchandise in all
Servania, especially for raw Silks. Tauris has out-liued many deaths, and is
very rich by reason of continual Trade, nourishing almost two hundred thousand
people within her compass; for walls it has not. This was sometimes the
Seat-Royall, and after that, Casbin, which is situate in a fertile Plain,
four days journey in length, wherein are two thousand Villages. The buildings
are of Brick dried in the Sun, as in Persia is most usual: The At-maidan,
or chief street, is foure-square, almost a mile in circuit. Near to it is
Ardouil, of chief note for beginning of the Sophian Superstition. G^ilan is
four days journey from Casbin, and stands near to the Caspian Sea. Near to
Bachu is a Fountain of black oil, which serves all the Country to burn in
their houses. Cassan is well seated, and rich in merchandise, but subject to
heat more then other parts of Persia. No person is there permitted to be idle.
Hispaan is thought to be Hecatompolis: the walls are a days journey about on
horseback, before the greatest, now the royal City of the Persians. It has
a strong Fort, two Seraglio's, the walls where of glister with red Marble and
Parget of diverse colors, paused all with Mosaique work, all things else
combining Majesty and loveliness, Magnificence and beauty. The inhabitants,
as did the ancient Parthians, buy, sell, talk, and perform all their public
and private affairs on horseback: the Gentlemen never go on foot. Sieras is
thought to be Persepolis, it is rich of Trade, and there is the best Armor
made in all the East, of Iyron and Steel, cunningly tempered with the juice of
certain herbs.

CHAP. VII.
Of the Sophian Sect, or Persian Religion, as it is at this present.

IT has been already showed, how the Saracens had one Calyfa, or Caliph,
whom they esteemed the Head of their Religion and Empire, in right unto both
succeeding their grand Seducer, Mahomet; and how the four Captains or
Doctors, each aiming, under color of Religion, to further his ambitious
Proiects, made way to difference of Sects in the beginning; and in succeeding
Ages the Sword decided who was rightful successor, the posterity of each
challenging to himself that right, according as they were able in the Field to
maintain it. These Persians affected Hali, as truest interpreter of their Law,
and Lord of the State, to whom Mahomet gave his daughter in his life time, and
his Alcoran at his death, being his kinsman also by birth: and although, by the
violence of the contradicting Caliphes, they did not always make hereof open
profession, yet ever and anon, as occasion was offered, this fire brake out,
yet never into so great a flame, as after the year 1369, by Sophi, Guine,
Aidar, Ismael, and their successors, unto this day.

From that division betwixt the Persians and Arabians, about the successor of
Mahomet, (it is Barrius his relation, in which the Persians call themselves
Sia, which signifies the Union of one Body, but the Arabians call them
Raffadin, that is, Unreasonable, and themselves Cunin) proceeded other Sects
amongst the Mahumetans; and amongst the Persians, two, called Camarata and
Mutazeli, which follow little the saying of the Prophets, but would have all
proved to them by natural reason, not allowing Moses or Mahomet any further.
Io.di Bar. Asdec.2.l.^0.c.6.
There is one Sect amongst them, called Malabeda, which subiecteth all things
to Chance and to the Stars, not to Divine Providence. There are other called
Emozaidi, which reject many things in the Alcoran, and follow the Doctrine of
Zaidi, the Nephew of Hocem, second son of Ali; these inhabit on the Confines
of Prester John, and in Melinde.

But to come to the common Persians, and to observe out of Barrius the
diversity of Opinion betwixt them and the Arabians; their Doctors reduce these
differences into seventeen Conclusions. The Persians say, That GOD is the
author and worker of every good, and that evil comes from the Devil, quast
doe-euill: or, Devil, of Dibolo, an accuser or cauiller.
Devil: The Arabians say, That would bring in two Gods, one of good, the other
of evil. The Persians say, That GOD is eternal, and that the Law and Creation
of Men had a beginning: The Arabians answer, That all the words of the Law are
praises of the works of GOD, and therefore eternal, like himself. The
Persians say, That the Souls of the Blessed in the other World cannot see the
essence of GOD, because he is a Spirit of Divinity; only they shall see his
Greatness, Mercy, Pity, and all other good things which he works in the
creatures: The Arabians answer, That they shall see him with their eyes, even
as he is. The Persians say, That when Mahomet received the Law, his soul was
carried by the Angel Gabriel into the presence of GOD: The Arabians affirm it
of his body also. The Persians say, That the children of Ali, or All, and
Fatema, and their twelve Nephews, have pre-eminence above all Prophets: the
Arabians grant it, above all other men, but not above the Prophets. The
Persians say, That it is sufficient to pray thrice a day unto GOD; in the
Morning when the Sun rises, which is called Sob the second ( Dor) at Noone;
the third ( Magareb) before Sunne-set, because these three contain all the
parts of the day: the Arabians require twice besides, according to their Law,
called Hacer, and Assa. The rest of their seventeen Articles of difference
mine Author has not expressed. These are sufficient to show, That they not
only differ about the successors of Mahomet, as Minadoi affirms, but about
Dogmaticall Points also in their ridiculous Theology, and interpretation of
their Law.

These differences have continued of old and long continuance: what has in
later times accrewed hereunto by the Sophian additions of Guine and his
followers, is in part touched in the former Chapter. Let us now take view
thereof, as the same at this present has infected Persia and the neighboring
Regions.

There is resident in Casbin Minadoi, li. 2. The chief is now at Hispaan.
Carlw.
their profane Priest, called Mustaed-Dini, that is to say, the chief of the
Law, who is as the Mufti among the Turks; and in the other subject Cities are
certain peculiar heads obedient to this chief Priest; who notwithstanding are
not chosen or displaced at his pleasure, but by the King himself, who should
not only be a King, but a Priest, as Ali and Mahomet were, from whom he
chalengeth succession. Howbeit, for avoiding of greater trouble, he grants
that favor, and puts over that burden from himself unto others, to whose
judgments he also refers himself, whenever there is any Consultation or
Treaty touching their Law and Religion. Under the Must^ed-Dini are the Califes
(says Minadoi) and these are they that execute their daily Service in their
Moschees or Temples. The chief of these Califes is he that puts the Horn
upon the Kings head when he is first enthronized: a ceremony now performed in
Casbin, because the Turks forbad it to be performed in Cafe, near unto
Babylon, according to the ancient wont. Other Cities also have a Mustaed-Dini
and Calife, although inferior to them of Casbin.

The difference between the Turk and Persian (as commonly it happens in
case of Religion) is so hotely pursued on both sides betwixt them, that they
neither use mutual Marriage nor Merchandise, Phil. Camerar. I.F.Op. subcis.
cent.3.c.12.
as some affirm: There can be no certain Peace, or continuing Truce. And if
one alters his Religion, and turns to the other side, he is not received
without a new Circumcision There be means to draw up that skin by art, which
may endure a new cutting.
. Baiaze^ the great Turk burnt two hundred Houses in Constantinople, infected
with this Sect, together with the inhabitants, and set forth a public Edict
against it. Ismael is said, in like hatred of the Turks, to have caused a
Swine to be nourished, which, in despite of the Ottoman, he named Bajazet.
Solomon returning from Amasia, was entertained in the house of one of this
Sect, who therefore, after the departure of his Prince, purified his House with
Washings, Perfumes, and other Ceremonies, as if it had been polluted with a
Turkish Guest: For which cause himself was slain, and his House razed. But
let us take a further view of this Sect in other Countries.

Neither could it contain it self in the limits of the Persian Kingdom, but
was spread further, and received even in the heart of Turkey, and Skirts of
India. For amongst other the Disciples of Aidar, Chasan Shelife and Schach
Culi, afterward surnamed Cusel^as, Knol. T. H. Surius Comm. in An. 1500.
fleeing the fury of the Persian King, who had slain their Master, and
persecuted his followers, came into Armenia Minor, and there took up their
dwelling at the great Mountain Antitaurus, at the foot whereof the broken
Rocks have many dark Caves, the work of Art partly, partly of Nature: which
place of the inhabitants is called Teke-il^, whereof Sohach-Culi was after
called Techellis. Here these two giving themselves wholly to a contemplative
life, in a strict austeritie contenting themselves with such things as the
earth voluntarily affoorded, began to grow in knowledge first of the Heards-men
and Shepherds, after of the Husbandmen and Country people, admiring their new
holiness. Yea, Bajazet himself, then Emperor of the Turks, moved with zeal
of their devotion, sent them yearly six or seven thousand Aspers. Afterward
becoming Fortunetellers, and prognosticating things to come, they were by the
superstitious people drawn into Villages and Cities, where they preached Hali,
according to Aidars Doctrine, enioyning their Disciples the red Band on their
Turbants; of which, the Turks term them Cuselbas, that is, Redde-Heads, with
which, in short time, the Cities and Towns were filled.

When they were thus multiplied, there met ten thousand of the^ at a Fair at
Tascia, or Attalia, where they executed the chief Magistrate; and being
persuaded by these new Masters, they swear never to forsake their Captains, or
refuse any labor for their most holy Religion, vowing their souls and bodies
in defense thereof. These Captains not having otherwise to maintain their
followers, gave them leave to forage the country adjoining, and to live upon
the spoil of them that would not receive their new doctrine, which they in
many troops, and with many prayers accordingly performed. They entered into
Lycaonia, and the people fled out of the country into Iconium. There two
Prophets set up proclamations of blessings to all such as would receive their
sect; and of destruction to the gainsayers. Ismael also, to increase their
strength, had sent them some troops of horsemen. Baiazets two nephews with
the forces of the country, incountting them in battle, received the
overthrow: Corcutus, the son of Ba^aze^, with his army durst not assail
them. Thus marched they into Bythinia, where near unto the River Sangarius,
Caragoses Bassa, Viceroy of Asia, affronted them, having before commanded
Aehme^es, the eldest son of Bajazet, to leuy forces in his government of
Cappadocia and Pontus, to shut them in at their backs. But Techellis, after the
loss of seven thousand men, and all his ensigns, chased him out of the field
into Cutaie, the seat of the Viceroy, where he besieged and took him with his
wives and children: and after being pursued by Alis Bassa, with forces out of
Europe, he implaed this Caragoses in the way on a sharp stake fastened in the
ground. Here was he forced to fight, and his fellow Chasan Shelife slain; but
Techellis recovering the battle almost lost, left Alis Bassa slain in the
place; the Turks fleeing before him. Ionuses Bassa was sent against him, when
having lost a great part of his strength, he retired his weakened forces unto
Antitaurus, out of the woods and mountains often as^ailing the Turks: whence
at last he fled into Persia. Ionnses caused strait inquisition to be made for
these new sectaties, doing such to death with exquisite torments, as had borne
arms in the late rebellion, and burned the rest in the forehead with an hot
iron: and after transported them, together with the friends and kinsmen of such
as had been executed, into Europe, there to be dispersed through Macedonia,
Epirus, and Peloponnesus, for fear of a second return of Techellis. The
remainder of Techellis his power as they fled into Persia, robbed a Carauan of
Merchants; for which outrage, coming to Tauris their Captains were by Ismaels
command executed, and Techellis himself burnt alive; but yet is this sect
closely favored in Asia.

We have now seen the proceedings of this Sophian sect, both in Persia and
Turkey, both here kept down, and there established, by force. Nicolas
Nicholay in his third book, says, That Sophi is not the name of their King,
but of their sect, which enioyneth them to wear on their heads woollen
Tolipanes: Sophi in Arabian being the name of wool. Hak.tom.1.
Geffrey Ducket says, in the Persian language Sophi signifies beggar, and
that their King is called there, not Sophi, but Shangh; but of this title is
said before. Whether it has been derived of the first Author, or of their
woollen superstition; the Sophian sect is exceeding zealous in their Rites. To
wear red on the lower parts of their body, were to these Red-heads scarcely
piacular. Touching Hali, they have diverse dreams: as that when they doubted of
Mahomets successor, a little Lizard came into a Council assembled to decide
the controversy, and declared that it was Mahomets pleasure, that Mortus Ali
should be the man. He had a sword wherewith he killed as many as he stroke. At
his death he told them that a white Camel would come for his body, which
accordingly came, and carried his dead body and the sword, and was therewith
taken up into heaven, for whose return they have long looked in Persia. For
this cause the King kept a horse ready sadled, and kept for him also a
daughter of his be his wife, Some say it is for one of his Nephews.
but she died in the year 1573. And they say further, that if he come not
shortly, they shall be of our belief.

They have few books, and less learning. There is often great contention and
mutiny in great Towns, which of Mortus Ali his sons was greatest: sometime
two or three thousand people being together by the ears about the same: as I
have seen (says Master Ducket) in Shamaky, and Ardouil, and Tauris, where I
have seen a man coming from fighting, and in a bravery bringing in his hand
four or five men's heads, carrying them by the hair of the crown. For
although they shave their heads commonly twice a week, yet leave they a tuft
of hair upon their heads about two foot long, whereof, when I enquired the
cause, They answered, that thereby they may be the easilier carried up into
heaven when they are dead. In praying they turn to the South, because Mecca
lies that way from them. When they be on travel in the way, many of them will
as soon as the Sun rises light from their horses, turning themselves to the
South, and will lay their gowns before them, with their swords and beads, and
so standing upright do their holy things, many times in their prayers kneeling
down and kissing their beads, or some what else that lies before them.

When they earnestly affirm a matter, they swear by GOD, Mahomet, and Mortus
Ali, Knol. Turk. Hist.page.964.
and sometime by all at once, saying, Olla Mahumet Ali, and sometime Shaugham
basshe, that is, by the Shaughes head. Abas the young Prince of Persia, charged
with imputation of treason, after other Purgatory speeches, swear by the
Creator that spread out the air; that founded the earth upon the deepes; that
adorned the heavens with Stars; that powered abroad the water; that made the
fire; and briefly, of nothing brought forth all things: by the head of Ali,
and by the religion of their Prophet Mahomet, Arthur Edwards. Hak.tom.1.
that he was clear. If any Christian will become a Bosarman, or one of their
superstition, they give him many gifts: the Governor of the town appoints
him a horse, and one to ride before him on another horse, bearing a sword in
his hand, and the Bosarman bearing an arrow in his hand, rides in the City
cursing his father and mother. The sword signifies death, if he revolt again.
Before the Shaugh seemed to favor our Nation, the people abused them very
much, and so hated them, that they would not touch them, reuiling them by the
names of Cafars and Gawars, that is, Infidels, or Misbeleeuers. Afterward they
would kiss their hands, and use them gently and reverently. Rich. Cheinic.

Their Priests are apparelled like other men: Ducket.
they use every morning and afternoon to go up to the tops of their
Churches, and tell there a great tale of Mahomet and Mortus Ali. They have also
among them certain holy men called Setes; accounted therefore holy, because
they, or some of their ancestors have been on pilgrimage at Mecca; these must
be believed for this Saint-ship, although they lie never so shamefully. These
Setes use to shave their heads all over, saving on the sides a little above the
temples, which they leave vnshauen, and use to braid the same as women do
their hair, and wear it as long as it will grow. Ios. Barb. apud Ramus.
Iosafa Barbaro at Sammachi lodged in an Hospital, wherein was a grave under a
vault of stone, and near unto that a man with his beard and hair long; naked,
saving that a little before and behind he was covered with a skin, sitting on a
piece of a matte on the ground; I (says he) saluted him, and demanded what he
did: he told me he watched his father: I asked who was his father; He, quoth
he, that does good to his neighbor: with this man in this sepulcher I have
lived thirty years: and will now accompany him after death; and being dead,
be buried with him: I have seen of the world sufficient, and now have
determined to abide thus till death.

Another I found at Tauris on All-Soules day, in the which they also used a
commemoration of souls departed, near to a Sepulcher in a Churchyard; having
about him many birds, especially Ravens and Crows: I thought it had been a
dead corpse, but was told it was a living Saint, at whose call the birds
resorted to him, and he gave them meat.

Another I saw, when Assambei was in Armenia, marching into Persia against
Signior Iausa, Lord of Persia and Zagatai, unto the City of Herem; who drew
his staff in the dishes wherein they ate, and said certain words and brake
them all: the Sultan demanded what he had said: they which heard him answered,
that he said he should be victorious, and break his enemies forces, as he had
broken those dishes: whereupon he commanded him to be kept till his return;
and finding the event according, he used him honorably. When the Sultan rode
through the fields, he was set on a Mule and his hands bound before him,
because he was sometime accustomed to do some dangerous folly: at his feet
there attended on him many of their religious persons, called Daruise. These
mad tricks he used according to the course of the Moon, sometimes in two or
three days not eating any thing, busied in such fooleries, that they were
feign to bind him: He had great allowance for his expenses.

One of those holy men there was, which went naked like to the beasts,
preaching their faith: and having obtained great reputation, he caused himself
to be immured in a wall forty days, there to abide without any sustenance:
but when this time was expired, and some wondered, one more nose-wise then the
rest smelled the sent of flesh: the Sultan hearing it, committed him and his
disciple to the Cadilasher, who by torments caused them to confess the
cousinage; for, through a hole which was made in the wall by a cave, he had
broth conveyed to him, and therefore they were both put to death. In the year
1478. Chozamirech an Armenian, being in his shop in Tauris, an Azi or Saint of
theirs came to him, and willed him to deny his Christian faith: he answered him
courteously, and prayed him not to trouble him: but when he persisted, he
offered him money; the Saint would not have the money, but importuned his first
suit: Chozumirech said he would not deny his Christian faith: whereupon the
other plucked a sword out of a man's scaba^d which stood by, and with a wound
which he gave the Armenian in the head, killed him, and ran away. But the
Armenians son complaining to the Sultan, procured his apprehension ^^ Meren,
two days journey from Tauris: and, being brought before him, he with a knife
killed him with his own hands, and caused him to be cast on a dunghill for
the dogs to eat; saying, Is this the way to increase the faith of Mahomet?
But when some of the more zealous people went to one Daruiscassun, which was in
guarding of the sepulcher of Assambei the former Sultan, and (as it were).
Prior of the Hospital, and requesting of him, obtained the body to bury it:
the Sultan hearing it, sent for him, and said to him, Dare thou countermaund
my commands? Away and kill him; which was suddenly dispatched. He, further to
be revenged of the people, committed the Town to the sack, which for the
space of three or four hours was done. And then he forbad further spoil, and
fined the Town in a great sum of gold. Lastly, he caused the Armenians son
to come before him, and with many kind words comforted him. This long history I
have inserted, to show the extremity of blind zeal, and religious fury in
the secular and votaries of these Persians, if Instire should not withstand
their rage.

Before is mentioned the commemoration of their dead, which is thus performed
over their sepulchers. Thither resort great multitudes of men and women, old
and young, which sit on heaps with their Priests, and with their candles
lighted: the Priests either read or pray in their language; and after cause to
be brought somewhat to eat in the place: the place contains between four
and five miles: the paths which lead thither are full of poor people, which
beg alms, some of whom offer to say some prayer for their benefactors. The
sepulchers have stones upon them engraven with the names of the buried parties:
and some have a Chapel of stone thereon.

At Merdin he saw a naked man, which came and sat by him, Ios. Barb.
and pulling forth a book, read thereon, and after drew near and asked him,
whence he was; he answered, a stranger: I also am a stranger, says he, of
this world, and so are we all; and therefore I have left it, with purpose to
go thus unto mine end; with many words besides touching meekness, and the
denial of the world. He said, I have scene a great part thereof, and find
nothing therein that contents me, and therefore have determined to abandon it
altogether. To this Merdin a man cannot pass, but by a way made of stone,
continuing a mile: at the head thereof is a gate and way to the Town; and
within the Town is another hill with a like way of five hundred pases in
height. There is an Hospital for entertainment of all strangers, made by
Ziangirbei, the brother of Vsuncassan: and if they be of better sort, they are
entertained with carpets spread for them worth an hundred ducats a piece: and
victuals for all comers.

We might here take further view of their stately Temples, their great and
populous Cities, and other things worthy observation, if that our Turkish
History had not related the like also among them, especially touching the
persons and places religious. For the rest I refer the Reader to other
Authors. Ducket.
The wonders of Nature in these parts are: near Bachu, a fountain of oil

Persia grows great abundance of Bombasin cotton: this grows on a certain
tree or brier, not past the height of a man's waste, with a slender stalk like
to a brier or carnation Iuly-flowre, with very many branches, bearing on every
branch a fruit or cod round, which when it comes to the bigness of a
wall-nut, opens and shows forth the cotton, which grows still like a
fleece of wool, to the bigness of a man's fist, and then being loose is
gathered: the seeds are flat and black, as big as pease, which they sow in
their fields and plowed ground in great abundance.

striking down the top of a steeple. Which being effected, the Kings conversion
followed, together with many of the nobility, to the Roman faith; liberty also
being granted to preach it openly, and to build Churches and Monasteries
throughout the kingdom. This was believed in England, especially by a friend
of our Authors, unto whom that pamphlet was sent, who requested him to say
Mass in thanksgiving to GOD for so great a benefit. But in the end, that
Jesuit who sent the Pamphlet, gave out that it was but a thing devised by

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Scythians, Sarmatians, and Seres, and of their Religion.

Under the name of Scythia, is contained a very great part of the world: It was
divided into Scythia Europea, and Asiatica. Pliny Plind.4.c.12.
says, that this name reaches unto the Sarmatians and Germans, and to those
farthest nations, which were unknown to other men. And Strabo in his first
book says, that all known regions toward the North were called Scythians or
Nomades: and in his eleventh book he affirms, that the Greeks called all
those Northern Nations, Scythians, and Celtoscythians. Those beyond the
Adriatike and Pontike seas, and the River Ister or Danubius, were called
Hyperborei, Sauromatae and Arimaspi: those beyond the Caspian sea, Sacae and
Massagetae. Some Scytha (...). Calius li.18.24.

called still of some of those Nations, and in some other languages Schieten,
of which our word Shoot is derived: Mela in his third book and fifth chapter,
calls them all Sagae: and in the fragment which bears the name of Cat^
Annij de orig, and ap. A Riccobo^
Cato de Originibus, is mentioned Scythia Saga: this word Saga, Berosus
Pseudo-Berosus.lib.2. and 3. and 5.
interprets a Priest: saying, that Noah left to the Scythian Armenians his
rituall books, which only Priests, and that only among priests, might read,
who were therefore called Saga, as Noah himself had been. These peopled the
countries from Armenia to the Bactrians, all which place was called Scythia
Saga: over which Sabatius reigning in the time of Jupiter Belus, Araxa with his
son Scytha possessed all from Armenia Westward, to Sarmatia in Europe. The
Graecians fable Hercules to be the father of these Nations, begetting

in his Beccesel^ua admiring his own language, coniectureth that while Nimrod
and his company fell to Babel, or after our pronunciation, Babble at Babel,
others, namely, the Cymbrians, or posterity of Gomer, stayed still in Margiana,
a country fruitful of Vines; whither he imagines Noah descended out of the
Arc, and there abode after the Flood. These he supposes, being not at Babel,
retained their old and first universal language. But Margiana growing too
little for their multiplied numbers, they were forced to send out Colonies. And
thus the Saxons, Tectosages, Sauromatae, Getes or Goths, the Danes, Galls,
and other Scythian Nations, the true posterity of Gomer, and keepers of the
first languge, as he by Dutch Etimologies gathers, peopled both Scythia and
Sarmatia in Asia, and Europe together with all Germany, France, England,
Norway, Denmark, and some parts of Asia Minor. He that will be further
informed of his Reasons, let him read his Saxonica Getodanica, and other
Treatises of his Becceselanian Antiquities.

Ptol.lib.3.c.5.
Ptolomey distinguishes Scythia from Sarmatia: he confineth Sarmatia Europaea
with the Sarmatian Ocean, and the land unknown on the North: with Vistula on
the West: the Eastern border is Tanais: from whence unto the Hircanian sea
Eastward, is Sarmatia Asiatica, on the North abutting on the unknown parts of
the earth, on the South with the Euxine sea, and a line drawn right from
thence to the Caspian sea. Scythia is by Ptol.l.6.c.14.
him placed to the East of Sarmatia, divided by the hill Imaus, extending unto
the region called Serica, having on the North unknown places; on the South,
the Sacae, Sogdiana, Margiana and India. But our purpose is to take them here
in their more general sense, understanding all the North parts of Asia, now
Tartaria Asiatica, (for of Europe, saving wherein the Europaean Scythians agree
with the Asian, we are not now to speak:) And of these, first to consider
their ancient Scythian rites, and in the next place their later Tartarian
appellation and religion.

Justin Justin.lib.2.
out of Trogus relates the arguments used of the Egyptians and Scythians, each
seeking to challenge to themselves, to be the ancientest of Nations, in which
quarrel the Scythians prevailed. Their manners and customs he thus reports.
They have no limitation of lands, nor tillage, nor house, but always wander
through places not inhabited, feeding their herds and flocks. They carry their
wives and children with them on carts, which also being covered with hides,
they use for houses. No offense is more heinous amongst them then theft: gold
and silver they as much contemn, as others desire. Milk and honey is their
food; their clothes, skins of beasts, for the use of wool they know not. They
have three times sought the Empire of Asia, never conquered of others. They
chased Darius the Persian King out of their coasts: they slew Cyrus with all
his army: they overthrew Zopyron a Captain of Alexander the Great with all his
forces. They only heard of, never felt the Roman arms, and themselves founded
the Parthian Empire.

That which credulous and fabulous antiquity has reported, of the monstrous
peoples inhabiting the Northerly and unknown parts of Scythia, is not here to
be recited, the countries being at this time discovered, and known to have no
such men, as either by nature are balde and flat nosed, with huge chins; or
have but one eye, where there are also Gryphons keepers of their treasures, or
men with goats feet: or other monsters of men, which Pliny, Plin.lib.7. Solinus
cap.20.
Herodotus and others, have rather mentioned then believed; Mandeuil and
Munster following them in like relations. Next to these both in place and
credit, we may reckon the Hyperboreans, of whom the Delians Herod.lib.4. Pius
secundus in history Asiae, confuteth this tale.
report that they sent to Delos virgins with sacrifice to Lucina, bound up in
wheat-straw: through so many nations inhabiting between. Of the Issedones is
reported, that when one dies, his kindred bring thither beasts, which they
kill, and cut, and dress, and eat together with the flesh of the dead man,
whose skull also they keep and gilde, using it as an idol, to which they
perform yearly ceremonies: mese exequies does the son there perform to his
dead father. Generally of the Scythian religion thus. Of the gods, they worship
first Vesta, whom they call in their language Tabits: next of all Jupiter, in
their speech Papeus, and the Earth supposing her to be the wife of Jupiter, and
call her Apia. In the next place they worship Apollo and Venus, by the names of
Oetosyrus, and Artimpasa, and Mars and Hercules. Some of them sacrifice also to
Neptune or Thamimasades. Images, Altars and Temples, they think ought not to
be made, except to Mars. Their manner of sacrificing is generally this: The
sacrifice is presented with the fore-feet bound, the Sacrificer at his back
having laid aside his holy vestment, wounds the same, and while it falls,
calls upon that god to whom he sacrifices; and then puts a halter about the
neck, and strangleth it, without kindling any fire, or vowing, or other
ceremony, and flayeth it; the flesh plucked from the bones, he casts into a
great Caldron, the bones he uses for fuel to sees the same (for wood the
country does not yield:) And if they have not any such vessel, they put all
the flesh with water into the paunch, and so the beast does sees it self.
After it is boiled, he which sacrificed offers the libaments, or offerings of
the flesh and and inwards: their sacrifices are, besides other beasts,
especially of horses.

Their Temples to Mars they build on this manner. Scythian Temples.
They heap together bundles of twigs three furlongs in length and breadth, and
above on them is made a square plain, three sides thereof are upright, the
fourth is made slope, and bending-wise thereby to get up: thither they bring
every year an hundred and fifty waines of twigs to supply the waste of them.
Underneath this work is erected an old iron sword, and this is their image of
Mars, to which they offer yearly sacrifices, both of other cattle and of
horses: and more to this blade then to other gods. Of their captives they offer
one of an hundred, but after another manner. For after they have offered wine
on their heads, they kill them by a certain vessel, and after lifting them
upon that their heap or Temple, they embrew the Sword-god with the blood. This
they do above: beneath in the Temple they cut off all the right shoulders of
the slain men, and hurl them up in the air together with the hands;
wheresoever the hand shall fall, there it lies, and the dead body apart. When
they have performed all their solemnities they depart. Swine are so odious to
them, that they will have none of them nourished in their country.

There are among them Diuiners, whose rites are these. Scythian divination.
They bring great bundles of willow twigges, which they lay on the ground, and
untie, and laying them asunder one by one, divine. Some of them practice
divination with the leaves of the Teiltree, which they fold and unfold in their
hands. The King, when at any time he falls sick, sends for three choice
men of those diuiners; who for the most part name some man unto him, which has
forsworn himself, having sworn by the Kings throne, an oath used of the
Scythians: presently the man is brought forth, who, if he denies what their
art has accused him of, the King sends for twice the number of diuiners: or
if they by new practice of their art find him guilty, his head is cut off,
and the first diuiners share his goods: but if they shall absolve him, more
diuiners are sent for; and if the most of them do absolve him, then those
three first are thus done to death. They lade a waine with twigges, and binding
the diuiners hand and foot, and stopping their mouths, cast them into the
waines, and set all on fire, burning oxen waine and men together, unless some
of the oxen by the burning of their harness escape. This punishment inflict
they on their false Prophets. They make their leagues with other nations in
this sort. They power wine into a great bowl, mixing therewith the blood of
them which join in league, cutting some part of the body with a knife or
sword; and then dippe in that bowl or mazer a sword, arrows, an axe, a dart,
and after curse themselves with many words, last of all drinking the wine.

Their Kings are buried amongst the Gerrh^, with many ceremonies carrying the
dead body through all the countries over which he reigned, which cut and
shave themselves; and with him is buried his best beloved Paramour, his
Cup Bearer, Cook, Master of his horse, Waiter, Messenger, Horses, and the first
fruits of all other things, and also golden cups: and then cast on earth,
making a very great hill.

When the year is gone about, they take fifty of his principal attendants,
which are not slaves, but freeborn Scythians, and strangle them with so many
horses of the best, and fasten the dead men on the dead horses with much
solemnity. But to relate all the particulars hereof, and their burialls also
of private men (whose dead bodies are carried about forty days, from one
friend to another, entertained every where with feasts, etc.) would be too
tedious.

The Scythians so far hate foreign rites and religions, that Anacharsis, a
Scythian Philosopher, having traveled through a great part of the world, and
vowed to the mother of the gods, if he returned home in safety, that he would
sacrifice to her with such rites as he had seen observed in Cyzicus: in the
performance of his vow, was slain by King Saulius.

observed the mad Bacchanal solemnities, which he had seen among the Greeks,

war were bloody: what man soever the Scythian first takes, he drinks his
blood: he offers to the King all the heads of the men he has slain in
battle: otherwise he may not share in the spoil: the skins of their crowns
flaied off, they hang at their horse bridles: Plin.lib.7.c.2.
their skins they use to stay for napkins and other uses, and some, for
clothing. Once a year the chief men have a solemnity amongst them, in which
they power wine into a Mazor, of which none may drink, which has not slain
an enemy.

These customs were general to the Scythians in Europe and Asia (for which
cause Poly^.hist.l.9.

their Land was justly called Barbara nec Scythiae tellus, etc. T. bull.lib.3.

contrary, as the furies were called Eumenides, says Ammianus, because they
sacrificed strangers to Diana, whom they worshipped under the name of
Orsiloche, and hanged up their heads on the walls of their Temples. The I Will

The Sacae sometimes made nearer, sometimes further invasions: they possessed
Bactria, and a great part of Armenia, which after of them was called Sacasena,
and proceeded unto Cappadocia, where, in the midst of their feastings, being
in the night surprised by the Persians, and slain, they left their name Saca
or Sacea to a yearly solemnity among the Persians in memory of this victory.
Of the Sacae, some hold Gorop. Beeces.

The Amazons, of whom is before related, are said Justin.lib.2.

Scolpythus, settled themselves by the River Thermodon, and possessed the field

were by secret conspiracy of those people destroyed. Their wives Go^^op thinks

Thaleslris in Alexanders time; and by degrees ware out altogether. One of their
Queens instituted the sacrifice to Mars and Diana called Tauropolium, says
Diodorus, Diodor. Sic. lib.2. cap.11.

have also a huge grove, and a round Temple dedicated to Apollo, to whom their
City is sacred. These and other things fable they of the Hyperborei, to which
Solinus Sol.^r.

of their freedom from sickness, and voluntary seeking for death in the fullness

we turned some parts, at least, of this history into an allegory. He yet
historically interprets, that they which placed the Hyperborei beyond the
Arimaspi, these beyond the Issedones, and those also beyond the Scythians, and
these again beyond the Cimmerians, intended the Europaean Scythians, or
inhabitants about Maeotis, the Liuonians and Muscouites: the Issedones to be in
Scandia, and all along those frozen or Icie seas, as he proves by Etimologie
of the word: North-east, and Eastwards from these in the continent of Asia he
places the Arimaspi, and in the continent of America Mexicana he seateth the
Hyperborei: They which list may have recourse to his learned discourses of this
argument.

monstrous adventures in the way, did not make it both perplexed and dangerous.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Tartarians, and of diverse Nations which they subdued; with their
Pristine Rites.

THe names of Scythia and Sarm^tia, are now together with those Nations
swallowed up and drowned in that Tartarian deluge, which about four hundred
years since with a sudden torrent overwhelmed the greatest part of Asia, that
we speak not of Europe, the heart whereof, quaked and trembled with fear of
this tempest. From Rome did Pope Vincent. Belluac. spec.bist.lib.30.
Innocent the fourth send Ambassadors, by entreaties to prevent their arms,
when as they had already overrun (besides those countries which still bear
their name) Russia, Polonia, Slesia, Moraui^, Hungaria, even as far as 2
^^^^^^. So far was the huge vnwealdy Empire of Alexander, or of the Romans,
short of the Tartarian geatnes, that the expedition of some one Bath^.
of the subjects of this Empire, has pierced as far into the West, as ever
Alexander into the East, and that happily among more resolute courages, then
the Persians or Indians, effeminated with wealth and peace, could afford: and
Tamerlane alone some ages after (if we credit that history ^^^^^^ Arab. of the
life of Tamerlane.
of his life, translated out of the Arbike) subdued and obtained more (besides
his own inheritance) then all that which the Romans had archieued in that
eight hundred years and upwards, wherein their Empire was growing to the full;
but of him afterward.

The name Tartar is proper to a river in Mongul, from whence it was derived to
the people inhabiting near the same, which after gave both name and laws to
so great a part of the world. For thus writes Ioannes Io. de Plan^ Carpini.
apud Hak. tom.1.
de Plan^ Carp^^, which was sent ambassador to the Tartarian Court, from Pope
Innocent, An.1246. There is a country in the East part of the world called
Mongol: which had sometimes four sorts of inhabitants: Yeka-Mongol, that is,
the great Mongols; Su^^^ngol. that is, water-Mongols; these called themselves
Tartars Totaros vocant.id est, exu^es. Market.
, of a River which runs through their country named Tartar: the third
Merkat, the fourth Metrit. These all were alike in person and language, but
divided amongst themselves into several Provinces, and unto several Princes.
In the land of Yeka-Mongol, was Chingis secund. Vincentium in Spec. hist.

Cyngis, who began to be a mighty hunter before the LORD: for he learned to
steal men. He raunged into other countries, taking as many captives as he
could, and joined them unto himself. Also he allured the men of his own
country unto him, who followed him as their ringleader to do mischief. Then
began he to war upon the Sumongols or Tartars, and slew their captain, and
after many conflicts-subdued them to himself, and brought them all into
bondage. Afterward he used their help against the Merkats, whom also he
vanquished in battle. Proceeding from thence, he fought against the Metrites,
and vanquished them also. The Naiman^ hearing that Cyngis was thus exalted,
greatly disdained thereat: for they had a great and mighty Emperor, unto whom
all the foresaid nations paid tribute. Whose sons (when he was dead) succeeded
him in his Empire. Howbeit, being young and foolish, they knew not how to
govern the people, but were divided, and fell at variance among themselves.
These invaded Cyngis his country, putting the inhabitants to the sword, but
were after overthrown by the Mongols, and either slain or made captives.

from Media (whither those people were conveyed) but from any part of the

reports of that their journey passing through Euphrates, miraculously staying
his stream (to wonder at the vanity of Writers) when they went into a region
called Aisarich, which was a year and a halfes travel, there to keep their
law; where never before had been any habitation.

M. Panlus Cap.42.apud Ram. (the Latin copy of M. Paul. is very imperfect) G.
Market. tab. un.
who with his father and uncle lived many years in the Court of the great
Cham, above three hundred years since, says that they dwelled at first (if
such wandering may be so called) in the North, where they had no Lord over them,
but paid tribute to a great Signor (there called Vncam, and here in these
countries Presbiter John) to whom they paid the tenth of their beasts. But this
Vncam or Presbiter John fearing their numbers every where multiplying, devised
to disperse them through the world: which the Tartars perceiving, with joint
consent forsook their former habitation, and departed thence far off into the
North, denying further tribute unto Vncam.

After they had there continued a certain time, they chose to their King about
the year 1162 one which was called Cingis Can, who ruled them with such
modesty and justice, that they loved and feared him as a god, his fame
reducing all the other Tartars in other parts under his obedience. He thus
strengthened, weary of those deserts, commanded them to arm themselves with
bows, and other weapons, and began to invade and conquer Cities and Provinces
to his subjection, the principal inhabitants whereof he carried with him,
kindly entertaining them, leaving such discreet Governors in the same, that
the people were secured in their persons and goods. When he had thus subdued
about nine Provinces, he sent his ambassador to Vncam subdued.
Vncam, to demand his daughter in marriage which Vncam with much indignation and
many threatenings denying, Cingis assembling his forces marched against him, and
by the way enquired of his Astrologers and Diuiners touching his success. They
taking a green reed, cle^t it asunder, placing the parts thereof a good
distance one from another, and writ upon the one the name of Vncam, and Cingis
on the other; telling the King that whiles they were reading their coniuring
charms, these reeds would fight together, and the victory should remain with
him whose reed got the better: which accordingly came to pass in the sight of
the army: Cingis his reed ouercomming the other, as after Cingis himself did
Vncam, whom he slew in the field, and possessed his daughter and state, wherein
he continued six years conquering Cities and Kingdoms, and at last was
wounded, at a Castle called Thaigin, in the knee, whereof he died, and was
buried in mount Altay.

The next Emperor (after his account) was Cyn Can the third, Bathyn Can the
fourth, or Allan the brother of Mangu; Esu Can, the fifth, Mongu Can the sixth,
Cubl^i Can who not only inherited what the former had conquered, but in the
sixtieth year of his reign subdued in a manner the rest of (those parts of)
the world. The word Can signifies Emperor. Where soever these Emperors die,
they are buried in Altay aforesaid; they which carry him, killing all they meet
within the way, bidding them go to the other world to serve their Emperor.
For this end they also slay the best horses, to serve their dead Lord in
another world. When Mangu Can was buried, there were more then ten thousand men
slain by the soldiers which conveyed him. In this History of M. Paul, observe
that this catalogue of Emperors is unsound: for W. de Rubruquis in Bathyes
time, was at the Court of Mangu Can, to whom Bathy was subject. Occoday is left
out, and Es^ put in. The cause of this error seems to be the giving of this
name can to the chief Dukes, as Bathy, etc. and the want of exact written
chronicles in those times amongst them.

For further light into this history, I think it not amiss to set down what
Haithon or Anthony the Armenian has written of the Tartarian beginnings. This
our Author was royally descended in Armenia, where he lived about three hundred
years since, and at the request of Pope Clement the 5, writ the history of the
Tartars, from Cingis or Cangius til Mango Can, taken out of the Tartarian
histories: the rest he partly saw with his eyes, and partly learned of his
uncle, an eie-witnes of the same, who had attended on Haython the Armenian
King, in the great Cha^^s Court. The country where the Tartars first dwelt
(says The Tartars Legend of Cangius.Hait. Armen.
Haithon) is beyond the mount Belgian, where they lived like beasts, having
neither letters nor faith, nor habitation, nor souldiourie, nor reputation
among their neighbor-nations. There were of them diverse nations, called by one
common name Mogli, which were divided into seven principal tribes, whose names
were Tatar, Tangut, Cunat, Talair, Sonich, Monghi, Tebeth. These all being
subjects to their neighbors, a poor old man being a Smith (who as they
believe, was ingendered of the Sunbeams) saw in his sleep an armed man on a
white horse, which said unto him, O Cangius, The will of the immortal GOD is
that thou be the Governor of the Tartarians, and Ruler of the seven nations,
to free them from their bondage and tribute. This his vision, when he reported
to others, they would not believe him, until that the night following, the
chief men amongst themselves saw the same man, with command from the immortal
GOD, to yield obedience unto Cangius. This they performed with all reverence,
and spread in the midst of them a black felt, with a seat thereon, on which the
seven Princes or chief men placed Cangius, calling him Can, that is, Emperor,
and kneeled before him. This happily was then the most sumptuous throne A felt
the Tartarian throne in their coronation.
their State could afford, but continued in the royal inuestiture of their
succeeding Sovereigns, their exceeding riches and conquests notwithstanding:
at two of which solemnities (says our Author) I my self have been present.
Cangius thus inthronized on his felt, commanded them many things: first to
believe the immortal GOD: and from thence forwards, the Tartars began to
call upon the name of the immortal GOD, seeking for his aid in all their
enterprises. Secondly, he commanded to make a general view of all such as were
able to bear arms, appointing Captains over tennes, over thousands, and over
ten thousands, which made a full regiment. He commanded also those seven
principal heads of their Tribes, to bereave themselves of their dignities, and
for further trial of their obedience, each of them to bring thither his eldest
son, and to cut off his head each with his own hand: which they refused not
to do, in reverence to that Divine ordinance, whereby he was made their
Sovereign. Cangius having thus made trial of their fidelity, subdued many
Nations: and one day having his horse slain in battle under him, was forsaken
of his Tartars, despairing his recovery after they saw him fall, and might
easily have been slain, had not his enemies through ignorance neglected him,
to pursue the rest: which Cangius perceiving, conveyed himself into a thicket
of shrubbes: and when his enemies returned to despoile the dead, an Owl came
and sat on the shrubbe, under which Cangius was hidden, which caused them not
to suspect any to lurk there, and so they departed. He the next night fled to
his people; who seeing him, and hearing the order of his escape, gave thanks
to the immortal GOD, who by means of that bird had preserved him. They also
had (after this) that The Owl observed.
foul in such reverence, that it is accounted a happy thing to wear one of
her feathers on their heads. Cangius afterward assaulting his enemies, brought
under, both them, and all the countries on that side of Belgian. The exact time
of these things Haithon could not learn, notwithstanding his much inquiry:
which he imputes to their want of letters at that time.

These countries thus conquered, the armed man appeared to him the second time,
and commanded him in the name of the immortal GOD to pass the mountain
Belgian, and go toward the West, where he should conquer Kingdoms, Seignories
and Lands. And that thou may be assured that this is the will of GOD, arise
and go with thy people toward the mountain, to that part which joins on
the sea: There thou shall dismount, and turn thee toward the East, and
kneeling down nine times, shall worship the immortal GOD, and he which is
Almighty shall show thee the way by which thou may commodiously pass.
Cangius presently commands his people with their wives and families to
accompany him in this enterprise; and when they were come to the sea, forgate
not with his followers to perform those nine worships; and staying there that
night in his prayers, the next day he saw that the sea had gone nine foot
back from the Mountain, and left a spacious way, by which they with all their
substance passed, Westward. Hence it is that the Tartars ascribe some
happiness to the number of nine: and he that will offer a present to any
Tartarian Signor, must offer nine things The number of nine.
, which custom they use in their tributes unto this day, as Master Ienkinson
found by experience to his cost. Cangius after many adventures, and many laws
which of him were called Iasack Cangis Can, having first persuaded his twelve
sons (wherein I think his nephews were also reckoned) to concord, bidding
each of them to bring him an arrow, which together, none of them; asunder, the
least of them might easily break, he died.

This History of Cingis or Cangius I have thus fully related, for knowledge
both of the beginnings of their: State and Religion: and if these visions seem
fabulous, yet might Cingis in his subtlety deal with them, as Mahomet with
his Arabians, or Numa with the Romans; the one making Gabriel, the other
Aegeria, authors of their policies: and what he in part pretended, might by
Fame and Time be augmented. Although I see not, but that this History of
Cingis may as well be credited, as that of Alexander, in Josephus, to whom
appeared one in the habit of the Jewish High Priest, commanding him to
undertake that enterprise, with promise of assistance, for which cause, he
whom the world worshipped as a King, and as a god, did worship, Antiq.lib.11.
himself prostrate before Iadad the High Priest. And the same Ios.
Antiq.lib.2.in sine.
Author also says, that the Pamphylian sea divided it self to give way unto
his Macedonian soldiers, having no other way to destroy the Empire of the
Persians.

To return to our Friar with whom we began; he reports Io.de Plano ^arpini.
that Cingis, after his victory against the Naimani, warred upon the Kythayans,
but were overthrown, and all the Nobles, except seven, slain. Having breathed
himself a while at home, he invaded the Huyria Christian people of the
Nestorian sect, whom they overcame, and received of the^ letters, of which
before they were ignorant. After the^, he subdued the Saroyur, Ka^anites, and
Hudirat. This done, he waged war against the Kythayans or Cathayans, whose
Emperor he shut up into his chief City, where Cyngis besieged him, till that
victual failing in his Camp, he commanded that they should eat every tenth man
of the army. They of the City fought valiantly with engines, darts, arrows:
and when stones wanted, they threw Silver, especially molten Silver. But by
undermining, the Tartars made way from the Army into the midst of the City,
where they issued up, and opened the gates by force, and slew the Citizens.
This is the first time that the Emperor of the Kythayans being vanquished,
Cyngis Cham obtained the Empire. The men of Kytay Kytayans; and their Religion.
are Pagans, having a special kind of writing by themselves, and, as it is
reported, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament. They have also recorded
in Histories the lives of their forefathers, and they have Eremites, and
certain houses made after the manner of our Churches, which, in those days,
they greatly resorted unto. They say, that they have diverse Saints also, and
they worship one GOD. They adore and reverence CHRIST JESUS our LORD, and
believe the Article of eternal life, but are not baptized. They do also
honorably esteem and reverence our Scriptures. They love Christians, and
bestow much alms, and are a very courteous and gentle people. They have no
beards, and they agree partly with the Mongals in the disposition of their
countenance. There are not better artificers in the world. Their Country is
exceeding rich in Corn, Wine, Gold, Silk, and other Commodities.

After the conquest of Cathay, cyngis sent his son Thossut Can (for so they
termed him also) against the people of Comania, whom he vanquished. Another
son he sent against the Indians, who subdued India Minor. These Indians are
the black Saracens Black Saracens.
, which are also called Aethiopians. Thence he marched to fight against
Christians, dwelling in India Mayor, whose King was commonly called Presbyter
John, who by a stratageme repelled them out of his dominion. In traveling
homewards, the said Army of the Mongals came unto the Land of Buirthabeth, the
inhabitants whereof are Pagans, and conquered the people in bartaile. This
people have a strange custom; when any man's father dies, he assembleth all
his kindred, and they eat him. They have no beards, but with an iron Instrument
pluck out the hairs, if any grow. Cyngis himself went unto the Land of
Kergis, which they then conquered not. And in his return home his people
suffered extreme famine: and by chance finding the fresh entrails of a
beast, they cast away the dung, sodde it, and brought it before cyngis, and did
eat thereof. Hereupon Cyngis enacted, That neither the blood, nor the
entrails, nor any other part of a beast, which might be eaten, should be cast
away, save only the dung. He was afterward slain by a thunderclap, leaving
behind him four sons; the first Occoday, the second Thossut can, the third
Thiaday, the name of the fourth is not known.

Cyngis being dead, Occoday Occoday 2^ Tart.Imp.
was chosen Emperor. He sent Duke Bathy his nephew, the son of Thossut can,
against the Country of Altisoldan, and the people called Bisermini, who were
Saracens, but spoke the Language of Comania, whom he subdued. Thence they
marched against Orna, a Port Town on the River Don, where were many Gazarians,
Alanians, Russians, and Saracens, which he drowned with the River running
through the City, turning it out of the channel. Thence they passed into
Russia, and made foul havoc there, destroying Kiou, the chief City. They
proceeded against the Hungarians and Polonians, and in their return invaded
the Morduans, being Pagans, and conquered them in battle. Then they marched
against the people called Byleri, or Bulgaria magna, and utterly wasted the
Country. From hence they proceeded toward the North against the people called
Bastarci, or Hungaria magna, and having conquered them, subdued also the
Parossitae and Samogetae, thence proceeding unto the Ocean Sea.

At the same time Occoday sent cyrpodan against Kergis The Kergis
, who subdued them in battle. These are Pagans, having no beards at all. They
have a custom, when any of their fathers die, in token of lamentation, to draw
(as it were) a Leather thong overthwart their faces, from one ear to the
other. Hence he marched with his forces Southward against the Armenians, which
they conquered, with part of Georgia, receiving tribute of the other part; and
from thence into the Dominions of the mighty Sultan, called Deurum, whom they
vanquished in sight. And to be short, they went on further, sacking and
conquering even unto the Sultan of Aleppo, whose Countries they subdued. They
marched against the Caliph of Baldach, and exacted at his hands the daily
tribute of four hundred Byzantines, besides Baldakines, and other gifts. Thus
far of their Conquests out of Friar John aforesaid, who was in person with
Bathy, or Baydo, and at the Court of Guine the Emperor.

Haython Haithon Armen.
calls Baydo the second son of Ocoday, or Hoccota Can, affirming, That he
sent his three sons; Iochi into the West, as far as Tygris; Baydo toward
the North, and Chagoday toward the South. He sent also one Baydo (whether the
same, or another) with thirty thousand horse, against the Sultan of the
Turks, whose Realm he subdued in the year 1244. He adds, That Baydo having
conquered Cumania Cumania.
, (which he confineth on the East with the Corasmians, on the West with the
Euxine, on the North with Cassia, happily Casan, on the South with the River
Etil) he subdued Russia, Gazaria, Bulgaria, and so passing into Austria,
following the stream of his victories, in the passage of a great stream was
there drowned. His heirs succeeded him in the places which he had conquered;
which Seignorie Tochay possessed in Haithons time. This History of Baydo his
death is not likely: For Yvo of Narbona, in an Epistle to the Archbishop of
Bordeaux, recorded by Mat. Paris.
Mat. Paris in the year 1243, says, That in the same present Summer they had
departed out of Hungary, and laid siege to Neustat, wherein this Yvo then was:
and in the year 1246, Friar John was with the said Baydo, who also rehearses
that Hungarian Expedition, and his return unto those parts about Volga, or
Etil. Likewise William de Rubi uquis, a Friar Minorite, was sent to Baatu (so
he calls him) from Jews the French King, in An. 1253.

And to this agrees Mathias a Michon Mat. a Michou.de Sarmat. lib.1.
in his Sarmatian History, who witnesses, That in the year 1241 the Tartars,
under Bathu, came into Russia, and destroyed Kiou, a City before stately and
beautiful, having in it three hundred Churches and more, very fair, of which
some remain to this day among the shrubbes and briars, receptacles for wild
beasts. It was the Seat of the Metropolitan, who had under him many Bishops
through Moldauia, Valachia, Russia, and Muscouia. He sent Peta into Polonia,
who destroyed the Country, and on Ashwednesday turned Cracouia into ashes,
abandoned before both of the Prince and People; and after overthrew Duke
Henry, and other Noblemen, with the forces of the Country assembled against
them, together with Pompo, the great Master of the Dutch Order in Prussia: in
which battle, a certain Tartarian Standard Bearer, carrying in a great
Standard the Greek letter X, and on the top of the staff a black and
terrible Image, with a long beard, began Tartarian Sorcerie.
with enchantment strongly to shake the head of the Image: whereupon a smoke
and cloud of intolerable stink was presently dispersed over the Polonians, and
they became heartlesse and unable to fight. Duke Henry and Duke Boleslan^ and
Pompo, with the flower of their Nobility, was here slain, and the Country
miserably spoiled. From hence they went into Morauia, where they put all to
fire and sword more then a month together: and thence to Hungary to Bathy,
who entered Hungary with 500000 soldiers; where first overthrowing those
forces which King Bela had sent to prohibit them passage, they after chased the
King himself, with the power of his Kingdom opposing himself against them,
out of the field, who fled into Austria, and after into Sclauonia, leaving his
Country a prey to the Tartars: who making spoil on that side of Danubius, the
next Winter passed over the River, then frozen, and filled all with blood and
slaughter. Bathy sent Cadan to pursue the King into Scalauonia, still fleeing
before him, who wasted Bosna, Seruia, and Bulgaria. And after two years
sackage in Hungary, they passed by the fennes of Maeotis into Tartaria, and
happily had returned to make fresh spoils in Europe, if the Embassage of Pope
Innocent had not diuerted their purpose: or rather, that Occoday, their great
Cham, being about that time poisoned, they were to expect a new Commission from
his successor, which was Cuine; who when he was installed, even in the presence
of Friar Io.de Plano C.
John, the Popes Legate, erected a Banner against all Kingdoms of the
Christians, except they would be subject to him: for their intent was to subdue
all the world, as Cyngis Cham had ordained; and the superscription of his Seal
was, GOD in Heaven, and Cuine Cham upon Earth, the strength of GOD, the Scale
of the Emperor of all men.

But Cuine Cuine 3 Imp. Mangu 4.
in short time after died, and left the Empire to Mangu Can; to whom Aytonus
Hait^onus de Tart.
the Armenian King went voluntarily in person, about the year 1257, and
receiving gracious entertainment, made unto him seven petitions: first, That
he and his people should become Christians: secondly, That there should be
perpetual peace between the Tartars and Christians: thirdly, That in all
Countries conquered by the Tartars, the Churches and Clergymen of the
Christians should be free from servitude and tribute: fourthly, That he would
redeem the Holy Sepulcher and the Holy Land from the Saracens: fifthly, That
he would destroy the Caliph of Baldack: sixthly, That himself might have aid,
as need should require, in his defense, of such Tartars as were near unto
Armenia: seventhly, That such parts of Armenia which the Saracens now
possessed, and the Tartars should recover from them, might, return to the
Crown of Armenia. Mangu-can answered, after deliberation with his Nobles, to
the first, That himself would be a Christian, and persuade other his subjects,
but force none thereunto: and to the rest in order, that his requests in all
should be fulfilled, and to that end he would send his brother Haolon into
those parts, as is before already showed. Thus was Mangu baptized by a Bishop,
then Chauncellor of Armenia, and all his household, and many Nobles of both
sexes. But before Jerusalem could be recovered, Mangu died, and Cobila, or
Cublai Cublai 5. Imp.
Can succeeded, in whose time M. Paulus M.Paul.l.2.
was an eyewitness of the Tartarian proceedings, who affirms, That this
Cublas exceeded in power, not his predecessors only, but all the Kingdoms of
Christians and Saracens, although they were joined in one. Before he obtained
the Soueraignetie, he showed himself a valiant souldior: but after he was
Emperor, he never fought field but once against Naians his uncle, who was
able, out of the Provinces wherein he governed, to bring together four hundred
thousand Horse, to whom Caidu should have added a hundred thousand Horse more.
These both conspired against their Master and Lord Cublai: but before their
forces were joined, Cublai stopping the passages, that none might pass to
carry news, suddenly assembled, within ten days journey of Cambalu, three
hundred and threescore thousand horse, and a hundred thousand footmen. An. 1286.
With this power riding day and night, he came suddenly on his enemies, and
having first consulted with his Diuiners, after their manner, gave the onset,
and took Naiam prisoner, whom he strangled betwixt two Carpets, least the
Earth should drink, or the Sun should see the blood of that imperial
family. Naiam had been secretly baptized, and now also had the Cross for his
Banner, which occasioned the Jews and Saracenes to scoff at the Christians:
but Cublai understanding hereof, called them all before him, and said, That the
Cross would not help such wicked men as Naiam, who was a Traitor to his Lord;
say ye not therefore, that the GOD of the Christians is unjust, to forsake his
followers; for he is the chief Bounty and Justice. Cublai by his Captains
conquered the Kingdoms of Mien, Bengala, Mangi, etc.

After M.P. l.2.c.^. Tamor 6.
Cublas Can succeeded Tamor Can son to Cingis, the eldest son of Cublai: in
whose time, Haithon (which then lived) says, That there were besides, three
great Tartarian Princes, but subject to the great Can: Chapar, which ruled in
Turquestan, who was able to bring into the Field four hundred thousand
horsemen armed: Hochtay, in the Kingdom of Cumania, who was able to arm six
hundred thousand horsemen to the wars, but not so resolute as the former.
Carbauda, the third, ruled in Tauris, able to assemble an Army of three
hundred thousand horse, well provided. And all these lived in the Western
bounds of the Tartarian Empire, every way inferior in wealth and numbers to the
Southerly and Easterly parts thereof.

CHAP. X.
A Continuation of the Tartarian History, and the question discussed, whether
Cathay and China be the same.

SInce this Tamor Can, we have not so continued a History of their Empire and
Emperors as before, and yet we have had succeeding testimonies a long time of
their State and Magnificence, but neither so diligent obseruers, nor so exact
Writers as the former: besides that, their Histories seem in some things more
fabulous. Of this later sort are Odoricus Odoricus ap. Hak.
, a Friar, which lived three years in the Emperors Court, and traveled as
far as Quinsay, who died in the year 1331; Sir John Mandeuile Sir John
Mandeuile.
our Countreyman spent many years in those Countries a few years after
Odoricus, and writ the History of his Travels in the Reign of Edward the
third of England, Echi^nt Can being then Emperor of the Tartars: in which, if
many things seem not worthy credit, yet are they such as Odoricus, or some
others, not of the worst Authors, had before committed to writing, and happily
be others after his time, in those days when Printing wanted, foisted into his
book. Once, he sets down the distances and passages of Countries so
exactly, as I think he could not then have learned but by his own Travels.
After his time Nic. di Conti. ap. Ramus.
Nicholo di Conti, a Venetian, traveled through India and Cathay, after five
and twenty years returning home: and going to Eugenius the fourth, then Pope,
to be absolved, because he had denied the Christian Faith to save his life, his
enjoined penance was, truly to relate to Poggius the Popes Secretary his long
peregrination: This was in the year 1444. About the same time Ios. Barbar^.
Iosafa Barbar^, a Venetian, in the year 1436, had learned of a Tartarian
Ambassador (which had been at Cambalu, and returning by Tana, was entertained
of the said Iosafat) some particulars touching the great Cham and Cathay, some
part whereof he heard after confirmed by the mouth of Vsun-cassan, the mighty
Persian King, in the year 1474: So that from the year 1246 thus far we have
a continued succession of the Cathayan History, besides that which an Arabian
has written in his History of Tamerlane, now extant in English.

I am the more curious in naming these Authors, least any should think that
which is written of this people to be fabulous (all these, in a manner,
concurring in the most substantial things) or should confound, as diverse
Ludouicus Reg. Literae Iaponicae. cantugo Contughi in These. Polit. part. 4. etc.
lately have done, the Countries and Affairs of China and Cathay. The cause of
both these errors is, because that in these last hundred years and more, in
which more of the World then ever before has been discovered, yet nothing of
moment is found out of this Country or People. Whereunto may be answered. That
since, diverse of the great Tartarian Lords, before subjects to the great Cham,
having made themselves absolute Lords of their several States, the way has
not been so open to pass, being otherwise of it self exceedingly both long,
difficult, and dangerous: and the adjoining Princes recovering themselves from
Tartarian servitude, will neither suffer their own to go out, nor others
freely to enter their Dominions; as the Muscouite, the King of China, and
others. M. Ant. Hak. to. 1. page 303.
I^nkinson, which went as far thither-ward as Bogharre, could not pafle
further for wars in those parts. Neither have any gone thither by Sea. And
yet even in this time we have not altogether wanted witnesses. Ludonicus

Vertomannus, a hundred years since, in Bengala met with diverse Christians,
who affirmed, That there were in their Country diverse Signiors, Christians,
subject to the great Cham. These were white men, of a City called Sarnau. In

before M. Paulus, tells of one Chaggai Memet, a Persian Merchant, who had
been at Campion and Succuir in Catay ( Damircan then reigning) and had
acquainted him with diverse particulars thereof.

Also in the Epistle of Emanuel Carval. Epist. vide eadem ap. Pierre du Iarric,
livre 4 de l'histoire des Inde^ Orient. c. 16.
Emanuel Carualius, a Jesuit, dated at Malaca in January, 1599, is contained
the transcript of Jerome Xaverius his letter from Lahor, the City Royal of
the great Mogor, dated August 1598. Wherein the Jesuit relates, That whiles
he was in conference with the Prince, there entered into the Palace an old man
of Mahomets Religion, threescore years of age, who affirmed to the Prince,
That he had come from Xatai by the way of Mecca. Presently some which knew him,
affirmed, That he had distributed in alms a hundred thousand pieces of Gold at
Mecca. The Prince asking if it were so, he affirmed, That he did it because he
was old, and could not long live, nor carry those things away with him. Being
demanded of the state of Xatai, he answered, That he had there lived thirteen
years in the City Royal, Xambalu, the King whereof was very mighty, and had
in his Empire a thousand and fifty Cities, some of them very populous. He
said, he had often seen the King, with whom no man speaks but by a
supplication, nor is answered but by an Eunuch. Being asked how he had access
thither, he answered, That he sustained the person as well of the Ambassador of
the King of Caygar, as of a Merchant: and being detained in the first City by
the Magistrate, he showed his Commission, and post was presently sent to the
King, who returned in a month, riding 90. or 100. miles a day, with change of
Horses, bringing him letters of admission. No man was troublesome to him in the
way. They punish thieves severely (which also is observed of the Cathayans in
Iosapha Barbaro and in Marcus Paulus aforesaid.) The people he affirmed were
white, comely, long-beareded, and very personable. In Religion he said they
were Isauites, (or Christians, professors of JESUS) and some among them
Mussauites, or Jews, and many Mahumetans, who hoped to draw the King, being a
Christian, to their Sect. The Jesuit adds, That he farther conferred with
him another day about their Religion, who told him, That they had many
Churches, and some very great; many Images, both painted and carved, especially
of the Crucifixe, which they religiously worship. Every Church has his Priest
much reucrenced. The Priests lived single, and kept Schools, wherein they
instructed the youth, which should after take Orders: they had also one among
the Priests supereminent, and were all maintained at the Kings costs, as were
the Churches also both built and repaired. They ware black clothes, and on
holidays, read; with Cappes much like the Jesuits, but greater. He added,
That he had often seen the King go to Church: That there were many of both
Sexes, which in Cloisters lived a Monastical life, some observing also a
single life in their own houses. This agrees with Vertomans report.
He reported, That the Country was rich, and had in it many Mines of Silver:
the King had four hundred Elephants, which they said were brought from Malaca.
And from pegu also he said, that Merchants resorted thither, which voyage was
half a year (it seems through the Sea between China and Iapan.) Xauerius
adds, That while he was at Caximir, he heard of many Christians in Rebat, a
Kingdom adjoining to Xatai, who had Churches, Priests, and Bishops, to whom
he had written three ways in the Portugal and the Persian Tongues.

The greatest objection against this History, that distinguishes Cathay from
China, is the report of Jacob Pantogia Jacob Pantogia
, a Jesuit, in a letter dated from Panquin, the Seat Royal of China, in March
1602, in which he blames a double error of our Mappes, both for making China
larger then it is, and for adjoining to the same this questioned Kingdom of
Cathay, whereas (says he) China, or Sina, is Cathay, and this Panquin, where
now we live, is Cambalu. This he proves by the incredible riches which he here
saw, agreeing to that which is commonly reported of Cathay, and by the
testimony of certain Moors and Mahumetanes, whom he found in Panquin, which
usually, every fifth year, resort hither under show of an Embassage, and
paying of tribute; indeed for gain, by way of traffic: (their tribute
meane-while obtaining sufficient retribution out of the Kings Coffers, who
sustaineth them and theirs, all the time of their abode in China, at his own
costs, besides other gifts.) Of these Merchants, which resorted hither out of
Persia and the Country of the Mogores, the Jesuits by inquiry learned, that
this country of China was called Cathay, and had no other name in Persia, and
among the Mogores, nor did they know any other Country so called. And asking
further, how they called the City Panquin, they answered, Cambalu: whereupon
the Jesuit concludes without all scruple, as is said. And again, in the
Chinian Epistles, dated 1607, is reported, That Bened. Goes.
Benedictus Goes (sent six years after of the Jesuits by the way of Mogor to
find out Cathay) remained in the borders of China, in the Province of Xanti,
from whence he writ, An. 1606. That he could find no other Catay then the
Kingdom of China. This report furthereth Pantogia's opinion.

But if it be not sufficient to oppose the former report of Xamer to these of
Pantogia and Goes, and the different qualities of the Chinians and Cathayans
(as in their proper places shall follow) both in things private and public,
divine and humane; I answer, That the name Cambalu is by M. Paulus
M.Pa.l.2.c.7.
and others interpreted the City of the Prince, or Came. And Perera Gal^otto
Perera relationes Chin.
interprets Pachin, or Panquin, where the King of China always resideth, to
signify the Town of the Kindgome, as he was there advertised, the same
signification (in manner) remaining to the diverse appellations in differing
Languages, as a common name to be applied to any City Royal If Panquin were
Cambalu, the inhabitants would so term it as the Cathayans did.
. This Perera was himself a longtime prisoner there, and accounted it a wonder
in one City to meet with a few Moors, who were detained in China, having
come thither twenty years before, and were permitted the use of their
Religion; of which they could say almost nothing, but Mahomet was a Moore, and
their father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other words of their
Alcoran; wherewithal, and in abstinence from Swines flesh, they live (says
he) till the Devil take them all. And yet the report of Xauier tells us,
That the Moors are many and mighty in Cathay; of Jews I remember nor the
mention of them in any Chinian relation: of Christians, which (he says) is the
Religion in Cathay, there are not to my knowledge, except some late gleanings
of the Jesuits, any reported to be at all in China, but at Xensi Lit.
lac.Anton. An.1603.
at Xucheo, which also were aliens, as appears by their complexion, long
beards, and the use of Bells.

And whereas in China thieves and malefactors are seldom executed (and none
has power to execute any without special Commission from the King) but either
they die by stripes, hunger, or imprisonment, except some few once in a year:
M.Paulus and Iosafa Barbaco, from the relation of eyewitnesses, affirm, That
in Cambalu was such sudden and rigorous execution of Justice, that one taking
a Jar of Milk from a woman's head, and beginning to drink, upon the woman's
outcry was apprehended, and presently with a sword cut in funder, that the
blood and milk issued together; a Tartarian Ambassador affirming both this,
and that he had seen the like execution upon another, for taking a piece of
Bays from a woman, so chopped in twain. But the relation of the Chinian and
Cathayan differing Rites will further clear this point. As for the name of
Cathay, ascribed to China by the Moors, I answer, That William de Rubruquis
Will de Rubr. Hak. to.1.
, who was in the Court of Mangu Can supposes Cathay to be Serica Regio,
described by Ptolomey far more Northerly then the Jesuit reports China to
be, by his own Astrolabicall observation. And to these Seres Ptol.l.6.c.16.
Ptolomey joins the Sinae, or Chinois, on the South, and our later
Geographers generally concur in this opinion. He also which reads Ioannes
de Plaeo Carpins Jo.de plano Carp. c.5.
, shall find, that the Tartars conquered the Kara-Kitai, or black Cathayans,
and then the Emperor of Kithai, by undermining his City, as is said, in the
days of Cyngis; and yet a great part of Kitai remained yet unconquered, and
withstood his forces, and namely that part which is nearest the Sea. And this
wealthy Country of Great Cathaya has many Provinces, the more part whereof
do yet withstand the Moals or Tartars (it is the last period in Will.de
Rubruquis). I hence gather, that the name Kitai was applied to a great part of
the North-east corner of Asia, happily no less general to many Regions on
that side, then India to the Southerly parts. And why may not the name of
Kathay Rich. Johnson from a Tartarian Merchant learned the way to Cathay, and
in Cathay it self he reckons 75. days journey. Hak.
, as well by the Mogores and Persians, be given to the North parts of China
(one parcel of the North-east of Asia) as the name of India, not only to so
great a part of Asia, but to America also, which was called India, because the
first discouerers that thought they had encountered the Indian Continent? And
these parts of China, may much fitter retain the name of Cathay, to which
Empire it had so long been subject, and by the Cathayan conquest was first
known to our world.

But they knew no country else so named: True; for the Laws of the Cathayans
forbidding egresse of the Natives, and ingresse of Aliens, and a more forcible
law of Mountains and deserts, wild beasts, and wilder men; the manifold
smaller and more beggarly Segniories between, every one challenging their
ninth (if not themselves confiscating, or theirs robbing all) now in so long a
space may bury even the name and knowledge of the great Came, whereas neither
arms of Princes, nor traffic of subjects, can open any new, or retain the
old notice of Nations. What dreams did the West conceive of the East in Asia,
and South in Afrike, till the armies first, and Merchants after, of the
Carthaginians, Macedonians, and Romans discovered them? And yet how did those
floods of Barbarous people afterward drown with barbarous ignorance the
knowledge of all Arts, and this of Geography amongst the rest? And till the
Tartarians, like a terrible thunderclap, with the lightning and noise of their
Armies, brought a more sudden then welcome knowledge of themselves to the
world, who ever in Persia or Assyria had heard of their names or of diverse
people else, (and these Cathayans among the rest) first known by their
conquests? Further the Jesuit himself to Panquin ascribes just forty
degrees: and Marcus Paulus his Father and Uncle went from Boghar (the altitude
whereof Master Ienkinson Hac.
at his being there, observed to be thirty nine degrees, and ten minutes: or
as Abilfada Is. ap. Ramus.
Abilfada Ismael places it, thirty nine, and an half North and Northeast to
go into Cathay. The like course did the same men hold going into Cathay, from
Armenia afterward with Marcus himself, Lib.1.c.1.
sempre alla volta di Graco and Tramontana; whereas a course directly East, or
inclining to the South, must have been taken, if China had been Catai.
Neither is it likely that their journey would have been so much let by
Frosts and Snowes. The same may be gathered out of the discoures following in
Marcus Paulus, Lib. I. and li.2.
where he abutteth the countries in succeeding linkes to Cathay, from the
East, to the Northwards, and from the North-east declining Westward in
reckoning from thence. And whereas Pantogia raises the most Northerly part of
China but to two and forty degrees at the most, wherein as to an eie-witnes we
yield him credit: How can it stand with reason, how can it be likely that in
those temperate climes, the world can yield but a few Nations, and those base
Mores, and Ethnkies, when as a good part of Spain, half Italy, Greece, all
France, Germany, and Hungry (to omit other wealthy parts of the world) are
subject to the same parallels? And indeed herein Pantogia has well helped us,
whereas our modern Mappes have caused no small scruple to a diligent obseruer,
in placing Cathay, a country reported to be so fertile and civil in so
Northerly a clime, very indiscreetely Hond. tab.
raising Cambalu to the height of threescore degrees, and paralelling Cathay
with Norwey: which cannot stand with other things thereof reported, howsoever
the Tartars themselves were happily of a more Northerly climate then this
mentioned. Others go not so far, yet they place Cambalu too far within
land, which Paulus says is within two days journey of the Sea. It seems
that now this great Tartarian Prince has no strength at sea, and therefore is
the less known. And here in participate other great and mighty Princes,
Prester John (so called) of Aethiopia in Africa, and the Sophi, and great
Mogor, in Asia; ranked justly amongst the greatest Emperors of the world: who
having some part of their Dominion adioning to the Sea, make little or no use
thereof. Abilfada Ismael a Syrian Prince who wrote an exact Geography in
Arabian Ab. Ismael cited by Ramus. vol.2.
about three hundred years since, places Cambalu in 144. 8. Long. and 35. 25.
Latit, it may happily be 45. degrees in Latitude, one Figure being falsified, or
else inuerted for 53. And as this Latitude disagreeth from that of Panquin, so
the Longitude a great deal more.

Thus much have I thought good to dispute touching that difficult and hard
question of Cathay and China: which though it will be tedious to some, yet to
the curious may seem short enough; although somewhat else may be observed to
this purpose in the particulars of China, and Cathay following: this confirming
my opinion further, that Chaggi Memet, Mar. Polo, Mandenill, Odoricus, Nicolo
di Conti, and others, eie-witnesses, speak of China or Mangi, and of Cathay,
as diverse Countries.

And Farfur King of Mangi M. P. L.2. 55:
possessed his Countries, now known by the name of China, in peace till An.
1269. being counted a richer country then Cathay it self, which was conquered
before, if we understand it properly: and Cambalu seems to be the City
wherein Cingis the first Cham besieged and took the Cathayan Emperor. Paulus
also mentions among the greatest Cities of Mangi, Panghin, and Nanghin, which
sound to be the same with Panquin and Nanquin; reporting further that Mangi
alone had in it a thousand and two hundred great, rich, and industrious Cities,
(as much as is reported of whole China, and more) and that after Cublai Can had
conquered that State, he divided it into nine tributarie kingdoms, governed by
so many Vice-royes under him, (which possibly the Chinois recovering divided
into fifteen, as now they reckon them:) And these Cities he fortified with
Garrisons, not of the Natural inhabitants, but of Cathay. And these things are
reported by him who long lived in these parts, and non interfuit solum sed
etiam praefuit, and quorum pars magnafuit, possessing the place of Governor
under the Can three years (according to the Tartarian custom) in Iangni
M.Paul.l.2.c.60.
one of the chief Cities of Mangi, having under it seven and twenty other
Cities: and the whole province of Mangi he places Southeast from Cathay. And
wherefore does the King of China always abide in Panquin, in the Northerly
part of his Kingdom, but, as all which write hereof affirm, because of the
Tartars which from those parts conquered the kingdom? which if they were so
base a people as Pantogia affirms, could not be so dreadful to the Chinois,
that their King for their sakes should there make his residence in the skirts
and borders of the Kingdom. Alhacen Alhacen his history of Tam. translated by
Jean.du Bec.
a learned Arabian wrote the History of Tamerlanes life, wherein he tells of
the great Cham of Cambalu, and the King of China: as diverse Princes of diverse
countries, one of which accrewed to Tamerlaine by marriage of the Chams only
Daughter, and the other by conquest. What needed such a wall (which Scaliger
Scal.Can.Is.l.3
says he has seen in the Mappes of Chine) made by the Chinois, if the
Tartars were not mighty neighbors, especially themselves being so mighty and
populous?

For my part I cannot but think that in so great a tract as is situate to the
North of China, there is now as there have been of old many Cities, and a
Tartarian or Cathayan Kingdom, although it remain yet unknown. And who knew
that there was such a Kingdom as China a hundred years ago? or who has
sailed that way to seek this, since? and how long was it before it was known
in our world that there was such a Prince in the world as the great Negus above
mentioned in Aethiopia; especially he having no ships for war or
merchandise, nor many (scarce any) good havens by Sea to make himself known:
and within land Nature has as it were imprisoned him, barring up the passages
with Mountains and deserts: which seems now to be the case of the Cathayan;
furthered by the jealousy of many great Princes not to admit any forreiner in,
or license any of theirs to pass out, for fear of innovation. Sed plenum
aleae est says Scal.ih.de reb.Sinarum.
Scaliger, de ijs aliquid statuere quae nobis per caliginem duntaxat nota sunt.
It is hard to determine in these misty mysteries. Even as in Nature it falls
out that the sun shines there many hours before it arises to us, so in
History it may happen that there may shine a Tartarian Sun in Cathay, when
as a dark night in this longinquitie of distance hides him from our eyes. Let
every Reader judge as pleases him: I am afraid betwixt Cathay and China I
shall get a check for staying longer then becomes a pilgrim. Let us now
therefore mind our Pilgrimage, and take view of the Tartarian Religion: with
thanks to the Jesuits for their pains, but loath to follow them in novelties
except we be forced: the rather, because none are so ready to blame men therein
as their society; which though they be new sprung up, yet are Veteratores, (so
Scaliger fitly Scal. Elench. N S.
calls them) pretenders of Antiquity, but Steph. verba paululum mutata, in
lib. de Lips.Lat.
nihil illis antiquins quam antiquare antiquitatem. It is indeed for their
novelties that we forsake them. Idverius quodprius. Truth and Antiquity have
kissed each other. But let us leave the Ietnites, which in more necessary
matters have left the true Antiquity, and come to our Tartarian task.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Religion of the Tartars, and Cathayans.

IOannes Io de Pl.Car.^.3. ap.Hak.^^.1.
de Plano Carpini thus writes of their religion. They believe that there is
one GOD, the maker of all things visible and invisible, the Author of good
things and punishments, yet do they not worship him with prayers, praises, or
any certain rites. They have also Idols of Felt, in the fashion of a man, and
the same they set on both sides of their Tent-doores, and under them they put a
thing of Felt fashioned like a Dugge. These they account the keepers of their
Cattle, Authors of their Milk and yongstore. Others they make of silk, and
do them much honor. Some place them in a fair Chariot covered, before the
door of their flation: and whosoever steals any thing out of that Chariot is
slain without all pity. Their Captains have one always in the midst of
their Tent. To these Idols they offer the first fruits of their Milk: and the
first morsels of their meat, and first draught of their drink, at meals. And
when they kill a beast, they offer the heart to their Idol, leaving it before
him till the morning, and then they take and eat it. They make an Idol also
to their chief Emperor, and offer thereunto with great solemnity, as well
other creatures as horses, which none after dare ride on till death. They
break not a bone of the beasts which they kill for meat, but burn them with
fire. They bend themselves to this Idol toward the South, as to God. They
worship the Sun, Lights, and Fire: Water also, and the Earth, offering
thereunto the first of their meats and drinks, and in the morning before they
eat or drink. They have no set rites prescribed by Law, nor do they compel
any to deny their religion simply: although in some of their customs they are
very rigorous. Thus they martyred Michael Duke of Russia, because he refused to
do reverence to the Image of Cingis Can, which had been their first Emperor:
and compelled they younger brother of Andrew Duke of Saruogle in Russia, to
marry his said brothers wife according to their custom, after that they had
slain her former Husband.

They have certain traditions, according to which they reckon these things
following to be sins. Their sins.
To thrust a knife into the fire or any way to touch the fire with a knife, or
with their knife to take flesh out of the Cauldron, or to hew with an hatchet
near to the fire. For they think that they should so cut away the head of the
fire. They account it sin also to lean on the whip wherewith they beat
their horses (for they ride not with spurs.) Also to touch arrows with a
whip, to take or kill young Birds, to strike an horse with the rain of their
bridle, and to break one bone against another. Likewise to pour out meat,
milk, or any kind of drink, upon the ground: or to make water within their
Tabernacle, which whosoever does willingly, is slain: but otherwise he must
pay a great sum of money to the inchanter to be purified: who causes the
Tabernacle with all things therein to pass between two fires. Besides if any
has a morsel given him which he is not able to swallow, and for that cause
casts it out of his mouth, there is an hole made under his Tabernacle, by
which he is drawn forth, and slain without all compasion. Likewise whosoever
treades upon the threshold of any of the Dukes Tabernacles he is put to death.
Thus are these Gnattes strayned, when as hostile invasions, murder, and such
other Camels, are easily amongst them swallowed. They think that after death
they shall live in another world, and there multiply there cattle, eat,
drink and do other actions of life. At a new Moon, or a full Moon, they
begin all new enterprises. They call her the great Emperor, and bow their
knees and pray thereto. The Sun they say is the Moons mother, because she
has thence her light. Their Sorceries.


They are given to Diuinations, Auguries, Sooth-sayings, Witchcrafts,
Enchantments: and when they receive answer from the Devil, they attribute the
same unto God, whom they call Itoga, and the Comanians call him Cham, that is,
Emperor, whom they maruellously fear and reverence, offering to him many
Oblations, and the first fruits of their meat and drink. According to his
answers they dispose all things. They believe that all things are purged by
fire: therefore when any Ambassadors, Princes or other Personages whatsoever,
come unto them, they and their gifts must pass between two fires to be
purified, least peradventure they have practiced some Witchcraft, or have
brought some poison or other mischief with them. And if fire fall from heaven
upon men or beasts, which there often happens; or if they think themselves any
way defiled or unclean, they thus are purified by their Inchanters. If any be
sick, a spear is set up in his Tent with black Felt welted about it, and
from thenceforth, no stranger enters therein. Their sickness and Funerals.
For none of them which are present at his death, may enter the hord of any
Duke or Emperor, till a New Moon. When he is dead, if he be a chief man, he
is buried in the field where pleases him. And he is buried with his Tent,
sitting in the midst thereof, with a Table set before him, and a platter full
of meat, and a Cup of Mares milk. There is also buried with him Vin.l.30.c.86
a Mare and Colt, a Horse with bridle and saddle: and they eat another Horse,
whose bones the women burn for the soul of the dead, stuffing his hide with
straw, setting it aloft on two or four poles, that he may have in the other
world a Tabernacle and other things fitting for his use. They bury his gold
and silver with him: the Chariot or Cart in which he is carried forth is
broken, his Tent is destroyed, neither is it lawful to name his name, till the
third generation. They observe also other funeral rites, too long to rehearse.
They lament their dead thirty days, more or less. Their Parents and those of
their Family are thus cleansed. They make two fires, and pitch near thereunto
two Spears, with a line from the top of the one to the other, fastening on the
same line some pieces of Buckeram, under which, and betwixt the fires, pass
the men, beasts, and Tents. There stand also two women; one on this side, the
other on that, casting water, and repeating certain charms: if any thing
fall, or be broken, the inchanters have it. And if any be slain of Thunder,
the men in the Tent must thus be cleansed and all things in the Tent, being
otherwise reported unclean, and not to be touched. Their conditions.
No men are more obedient to their Lords then the Tartars. They seldom contend
in words, never in deeds. They are reasonably courteous one to another: their
women are chaste; adultery is seldom heard off, and theft is rare, both
punished by death. Drunkenness common, but without bralls among themselves, or
discredit among others. They are proud, greedy, deceitful. They eat Dogs,
Wolves, Foxes, Horses, and in necessity, man's flesh, Mice, and other filth,
and that in as filthy a manner, without Clothes, and Napkins, (their boots
and the grass can serve to wipe their greasy hands:) they have no bread,
herbs, Wine, meat or Beer, nor do they wash their dishes. It is a great
sin amongst them to suffer any of their food to be lost: and therefore they
will not bestow a bone on a dog, till they have eaten the marrow.

Yvo. Narbonensis in an Epistle recited by Mat. Paris Mat.Paris.
An. 1243. reports the confession of an English man, which was taken with
other Tartars by the Christians. He says that they called by the Name of Gods
the ancient founders and fathers of their Tribes, and at set times did
solemnise feasts unto them, many of them being particular, and but four only
general. They think that all things are created for themselves alone. They be
hardy and strong in the breast, lean and pale-faced, rough and huf-shouldred,
having flat and short noses, long and sharp chinnes, their upper jaws low and
declining. their teeth long and thin, their eie-browes extending from their
foreheads down to their noses, their eyes inconstant and black, their thighs
thick, and legs short, yet equal to us in stature. They are excellent
Archers. Vanquished, they ask no favor; and vanquishing, they show no
compassion. They all persist as one man in their purpose of subduing the whole
world.

Their proud swelling titles appear in the copies of those Letters of Duke
Baiothnoy and Cuin Can, expressed by Vincent Rel. Spec.Hist.l.vlt.c.51.and52.
Vincentius. One of them begins thus. By the precept of the living GOD,
Cingischam son of the sweet and worshipful GOD says, that GOD is high above
all, the immort all GOD, and upon Earth Cingischam only Lord, etc. These
Letters of the Emperor, the Tartars called the Letters of God: and so
begins Duke Baiothnoy to the Pope, who had sent Friar Ascelline, with
Alexander, Albericus, and Simon, thither in Embassage. The word of Baiothnoy,
sent by the divine disposition of Cham, Know this O Pope, etc.

Friar John Jo.de P.C.
says, he styles himself The power of GOD, and Emperor of all men: and has
in his scale engraven words of like effect, as is already showed. Mandeuill
C.37. Sir Io.Mand.
has the same report.

Will. de Rubruquis W. de Rubr.
says, that they have divided Scythia amongst them, from Danubius to the
sunne-rising, every Captain knowing the bounds of his pastures which they
feed, in the winter descending Southwards, ascending in the Summer Northwards.
Their houses are moveable, removed on great Carts which contain twenty foot
between the wheels; their houses on each side ouerreaching five foot, drawn
by above twenty Oxen. When they take them down, they turn the door always
to the South. Over the Masters head is an image of felt, called the Masters
brother: and another over the head of the good wife or Mistres, called her
brother, fastened to the wall: and betwixt both of them is a little lean one,
which is the keeper of the whole house. She has also at her beds feet a Kids
Skin, filled with Wool, and a little image looking toward the Maidens and
Women. Next to the door on the women's side (which is the East, as the man's
side is on the West) there is an Image with a Cowes Vdder for the women, whose
office it is to milk the Kine: on the other side another with a Mares Vdder
for the men. When they make merry, they sprinkle their drink upon these Images
in order, beginning at the Masters. Then goes a servant out of the house with
a cup full of drink, sprinkling thrice toward the South, and bowing the knee
at every time: and this is done for the honor of the Fire. Then performs he
the like superstition toward the East, for the honor of the Air: next to the
West for the honor of the Water: and lastly to the North, in the behalf of
the Dead. When the Master holds a cup in his hand to drink, before he
tastes thereof he pours his part upon the ground: if he drinks sitting
on horseback, he first pours part thereof on the Mane of the Horse. After
the servant aforesaid has discharged his cups to the four quarters of the
world, he returns to the house: and two other servants stand ready with two
cups, and two basins, to carry drink unto their Master, and that Wife, which
lay with him the last night, sitting together on a bed. Their Soothsayers or
Inchanters are their Priests.

M. Paulus thus reports of their Religion. They say L.1.c.46.
that there is a God on high in heaven, of whom lifting up their hands, and
smiting their teeth three times together, every day with censer and incense
they desire health l.2.c.26.
, and understanding. They place a Table aloft, in the wall of their house, in
the which is written a name, that represents this God. They have another
which they call Natigay (or Itogay) of Felt or other stuff in every house.
They make him a Wife and Children, and set his Wife on the left hand, his
children before him, which seem to do him reverence. This they call the God
of earthly things, which keeps their Children, beasts, and corn: and when
they eat, they anoint his mouth with the fat, and the mouths of his Wife and
Children, and then cast out the broth out of the door unto other Spirits, And
when their God has had his part, they take theirs. Of this Natigay, they with
like ceremonies of lifting up their hands, and smiting of their teeth, desire
temperature of the Air; fruits of the Earth, l.2.c.26.
Children and such like. Their wives are exceeding chaste and obseruant: and
though they be many, yet can Rachel and Leah, yea ten or twenty of them, agree
with a marvelous union, intent unto their household, and other business,
whereby they are gainefull, and not chargeable to their Husbands. When they
marry, W. de Rub. in this sort.
the Husband couenanteth with the father of the Maid, who having given him
power to take her wheresoever he shall find her, he seeks her among some of
her friends where she has then of purpose hidden her self, and by a kind of
force carries her away. They marry with any except their own Mother and
Sister. Their Widows seldom marry, because of their service to their former
Husbands in an other world, except the son marry his fathers wives, or the
brother, his brothers, because they can there in the next world, be content to
resign them to their former Husbands again. The women buy, sell, and provide
all necessaries into the house, the men intending nothing but their arms,
hunting and hauking. If one has buried a Male-childe, and another a Female,
the parents contract a marriage betwixt those two, and painting in papers,
servants, horses, clothes, and household, and making writings for the
confirmation of the Dower, burn these things in the fire, by the smoke whereof
they (in their smokie conceits) imagine all these things to be carried and
confirmed to their children in the other world: and the parents of the two dead
parties claim kindred each of other: as if they indeed had married their
children while they lived.

In Xaindu did Cublai Can build a stately palace, encompassing sixteen miles
of plain ground with a wall, wherein are sertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs,
delightful streams, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the
midst thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure, which may be removed from place
to place. Here he does abide in the months of June, July, and August, on the
eight and twentieth day where of, he departs thence to another place to do
sacrifice on this manner. He has a Herd or Drove of Horses and Mares, about
ten thousand, as white as snow: Of the Milk whereof none may taste, except he
be of the blood of Cingis Can. Yea the Tartars do these beasts great
reverence, nor dare any cross their way, or go before them. According to the
direction of his Astrologers or Magicians, he on the eight and twentieth of
August aforesaid spends and powers forth with his own hands the Milk of
these Mares in the Air, and on the Earth, to give drink to the spirits and
Idols which they worship, that they may preserve the men, women beasts, birds,
corn, and other things growing on the earth. Their Sects and orders.


These Astrologers, or Necromancers, are in their Art marvelous. When the sky
is cloudie and threatens raiue, they will ascend the roof of the palace of
the Grand Can, and cause the rain and tempests to fall round about, without
touching the said Palace, These which thus do are called Tebeth, and Chesmir,
Tebeth and Chesmir.
two forts of Idolaters, which delude the people with opinion of their
sanctity, imputing these works to their dissembled holiness: and for this
cause they go in filthy and beastly manner, not caring who sees them, with
dirt on their faces, never washing nor combing themselves, And if any be
condemned to death, they take, dress, and eat him: which they do not if any
die naturally. Bachsi.
They are also called Bachsi, that is of such a Religion or order, as if one
should say a Friar. Preacher, or Minor, and are exceedingly expert in their
devilish Art. They cause that the bottles in the Hall of the great Can do fill
the bolles of their own accord, which also without man's help, pass ten paces
through the Air, into the hands of the said Can, and when he has drunk, in
like sort return to their place. These Bachsi sometimes resort unto the
officers, and threaten plagues or other misfortune from their Idols, which to
prevent they desire so many muttons with black heads, and so many pounds of
incense, and Lignum Aloes to perform their due sacrifices. Which they
accordingly receive and offer on their Feast day, sprinkling Broth before their
Idols. There boe of these, great Monasteries, which seem like a small City,
in some whereof are two thousand Monks, which shave their heads and beards,
and wear a religious habit, and hallow their Idols feasts with great
solemnity of hymns and lights. Some of these may be married. Otherthere are,
called Sensim, Sensim.
an order which observes great abstinence and strictness of life, in all
their life eating nothing but Branne, which they put in hot water, and let it
stand till all the white of the meal be taken away, and then eat it being
thus washed. These worship the Fire, and are condemned of the other for
Heretics, because they worship not their idols, and will not marry in any
case. They are shaven, and wear hempen-garments of black or bright yellow,
and although they were silk, yet would they not alter the color. They sleep
on great mattes, and live the austerest life in the world.

Of their Astrologers in Cambalu were not fewer then five thousand; Christians,
Catayans, and Saracens, maintained with food and raiment at the great Cans
charge. These, by their Astrolabe foretell of the change of weather, mortality,
wars, diseases, etc. And if any enterprise any great work, he resorteth unto
them, and telling the hour of his nativity, by their Art is informed of the
success. They hold the soul to be immortal, and according to every man's
merits in his life, to pass into a more noble creature, till it be deified, or
ignoble, as to a pesant, and then to a dog, and so by degrees to the vilest.
They show much reverence to their parents, to whom if any be ungrateful in
their necessity, there is an office and officers appointed to try and punish
the offense. In the Emperors hall none dare spit, but for that purpose carries
a little vessel to spit in: nor dare any there make any noise or loud talking.
The Tartars were at first very uncharitable to the poor, and would curse them,
saying, That if God had loved them, he would have provided for them: but after
the Idolatrous Bachsi had commended Alms for a good work, there was great
provision made for them, and every day at least twenty thousand dishes of Rice,
Mill, and Panike, by certain Officers distributed amongst them. And for this
liberality they adore him as a God.

Cingis amongst his first Laws enacted (as says Vincentius) the punishment of
Vincent. Bell. Spec.histor.lib. 30.ca. 70.
death to be inflicted upon offenders in those three vices, which before time
had been most rife amongst them, namely, lying, adultery, and theft: of which
yet toward other men that were not Tartars they made no conscience.

They are great Usurers, taking ten in the hundred for a month, besides use

use; insomuch, that a soldier in Georgia, which had borrowed five hundred
pieces of coin called Yperpera, retaining the same five years, was
constrained to repay seven thousand. And a Tartarian Lady for seven years use
of fifty sheep, demanded seven thousand Yperpera. They are so covetous, that
though they abound in cattle, they will scarce allow any to their own
expense, while it is found and good, but if it die, or be sick. They are
addicted to sodomie or buggerie. Ca. 76.
They eat sometimes for necessity man's flesh, sometimes to delight themselves,
and sometimes to terrify others, reckoning it a great glory to have slain
many, and that by variety of cruelty. Ca. 77.
Their heads they shave from ear to ear, in manner of a horse-shooe: wearing
long locks at their ears and necks. There be some of the Tartars, which when
they see their fathers grow old and diseased, they give them fat meats which
may choke them. And when they are thus dead, they burn their bodies,
reserving the ashes as a precious jewel, sprinckling their meats with that
powlder. Ca. 86.
But if any think not this enough (which I am afraid the most will deem too
much) let him resort to the large reports of Vincentius in his three last
Books; an Author, I confess, otherwise fabulous, and monkish, but herein to
be believed, as receiving his Reports from the eiewitnesses.

Likewise Nicephorus Niceph. Greg. hist. Romanslib.2.
Greg. under the name of Scythians has written of them, their Expeditions, and
Customs: their contempt of gold, and ignorance of the use of it before these
Conquests: and of the miseries which here by the Turks sustained, having the
Tartars on one side, the Christians on the other, and in their bowels a more
implacable enemy, famine against them. Settling themselves (says he) in the
parts of Mesopotamia, Chaldea, Aslyria, they left their own, and learned the
rites and religion of these Mahumetans.

CHAP. XII.
Of the festival solemnities, and of the magnificence of the Grand Can.

WE have already spoken of the solemn sacrifice observed on the eight and
twentieth day of August: We read in our Author Marcus Paulus.
Marcus Paulus, an eie-witnes of these his relations, of other the Grand Cans
grand solemnities. Of which, two are principal, one on his birth day, which in
Cublai Cans time was the eight and twentieth of September. On which himself was
royally clothed in cloth of gold, and twenty thousand of his Barons and
soldiers were all apparelled in one color, and like (excepting the price) to
himself, every one having a girdle wrought of Gold and Silver, and a pair of
shoes, some of their garments richly set with pearls and jewels, which they
wear on the thirteen solemnities, according to the thirteen Moons of the
year. On this day all the Tartars, and several Princes subject, present him
with rich gifts; and all Sects of Religions pray unto their gods for his
health, and long life.

But their chief feast is on the first day of their year, which they begin
in February, celebrated by the Grand Can, and all the Countries subject to him:
in which they are all arrayed in white, a color in their estimation portending
good luck. And then he is presented with many clothes and horses of white
color, and other rich presents, in the same religiously observing the number
of nine; as nine times nine horses, if they be able, and so of pieces of gold,
cloth, and the rest. Then also the Elephants (which are about five thousand)
are brought forth in sumptuous furniture: and Camels covered with silk. And in
the morning they present themselves in the Hall as many as can, the rest
standing without in their due order. First, those of the Imperial progeny;
next, the Kings, Dukes, and others, in their due place. Then comes forth a
great man or Prelate, which cries out with a loud voice; Bow down your
selves, and worship: which they presently do, with their faces to the earth.
This Prelate adds, God save and preserve our Lord long to live with joy and
gladness. They all answer; God grant it. The Prelate again: God increase his
Dominion, and preserve in peace all his subjects, and prosper all things in all
his Countries. Whereunto they answer as before. Thus they do worship four
times. After this, the said Prelate goes to an Altar there, richly adorned; on
which is a red Table with the name of the Great Can written in it, and a
Censer with Incense, which he incenseth in stead of them all, with great
reverence performed unto the Table. This done, they return to their places,
and present their gifts, and after are feasted.

When Cublas had overthrown Naiam his uncle (as before is said) understanding
that the Christians observed their yearly solemnity of Easter, he caused them
all to come unto him, and to bring the Book of the four Gospels, which he
incensed often with great Ceremonies, devoutly kissing it, and caused his
Barons to do the like. And this he observes always in the principal feasts of
the Christians, as Christmasse and Easter. The like he did in the chief feasts
of the Saracens, Jews, and Idolaters. The cause (he said) was because of those
four Prophets, to which all the world does reverence: JESUS of the Christians,
Mahomet of the Saracens, Moses of the Jews, and Sogemambar Can the first Idol
of the Pagans: and I (says he) do honor to them all, and pray him which is
the greatest in Heaven, and truest, to help me. Yet he had best opinion of the
Christian faith, because it contained nothing but goodness: and would not
suffer the Christians to carry before them the Cross, on which so great a man
as CHRIST was crucified. He also sent Niculo and Maffio, the Father and uncle
of Marco Polo our Author, in embassage to the Pope, to send him 100. wise men
which might convince the Idolaters, that boasted of those their magical
wonders, whereas the Christians that were there, were but simple men, not able
to answer them, which if it had been effected, he and his Barons would have
been baptized.

Odoricus Odoricus.V^^^.and Io. ^oeni;
says, that in his time the Can celebrated, besides the former, the feasts of
his circumcision, marriage, and coronation. But before the conquest of Cathay
they observed not any day at all with festival solemnities.

Cublai Can was of mean stature, of countenance white, red, and beautiful.
He had four wives, which kept several Courts, the least of which contained
at least ten thousand persons. He had many concubines; every second year
having a new choice of the fairest maidens in the province of Vngut, most
fertile (belike) of that commodity: which pass a second election at the
Courts, and the fairest and fittest of them are committed to Ladies, to prove
and to instruct them. Their parents hold it a great grace so to have bestowed
their children: and if any of them prove not, they impute it to their
disastrous planet. They hold it for a great beauty, to have their noses flat
between the eyes.

In December, January, and February, he abides at Cambalu, in the North-East
part of the province of Cathay, in a Palace near to the City builded on this
manner. There is a circuit walled in, four square, each square containing
eight miles, having about them a deep ditch, and in the middle a gate. A mile
inwards is an other wall, The Grand Cans palace.
which has six miles in each square; and in the South side three gates, and as
many on the North. Betwixt those walls are soldiers. In every corner of this
wall, and in the midst, is a stately palace, eight in all, wherein are kept
his munitions. There is a third wall within this, containing four miles
square, each square taking up one mile, having six gates and eight palaces,
as the former, in which are kept the Grand Cans provisions. And between these
two walls are many fair trees, and meadows stored with many beasts. Within
this is the Grand Cans Palace, the greatest that ever was scene, confining
with the wall abouesaid, on the North and South. The matter and form thereof
is of such cost and Art, with such appurtenances of pleasure and state, as were
too long here to recite. He for a superstitious fear suggested by his
Astrologers of a rebellion which sometime should be raised against him in
Cambalu, built a new city near thereunto called Taidu Odoricus calls it
Caide.
four and twenty miles in compass, and yet not able to receive the
Inhabitants of the old city, whence he removed such as might move suspicion,
hither. This city was built by line, in four squares, each whereof contained
six miles, and three gates, so straight, that upon the wall of one gate one
might see the gate right against it. In the midst of the city is a great
Bell, which is rung in the night, to warn men to keep within doors. The great
Can has twelve thousand horsemen under four Captains to his guard. He keeps
leopards, wolves, and lions to hunt with, and with them to take wild asses,
bears, hearts, etc. and one sort of eagles able to catch wolves. The two
masters of his hunting game had ten thousand men under each of them, the one
part clothed in read, the other in skie-colour: and when the Emperor hunteth,
one of these Captains goes with his men and dogs on the right hand, the
other on the left, compassing a great quantity of ground, that not a beast can
escape them. From October to March, they are bound daily to send in a thousand
head of beasts and birds. He has also when he trauelleth, Odoricus rec koneth
a g^^^^ter numb^^
ten thousand falconers divided in diverse companies, himself abiding in a
Chamber carried upon four Elephants, whence he may see the game, having also
his tents pitched for his solace near thereby. None may carry hawke or
hunting-dogge out of his dominion, nor may hawke or hunt near the Court by
many days iourneis, nor at all, in their times of breding, from March to
October.

But he that list to be more fully informed herein, let him read Marcus
Paulus and others V^^^ 32.^^^^ M^^^^ n^^^^
which have written of this Argument. It is religion to us further to suspend
our discourse of religion.

CHAP. XIII.
Of the alteration of Religion among the Tartars: and of the diverse sorts,
sects, and nations of them now remaining.

AFter so long narration of the Religion of the ancient Tartars, and of the
Cathayans, where their Emperors fixed their abode: it follows to consider of
the times following, wherein they have been divided both in policy and faith.
Maginus Mag. Geogr. Precop. Desert. Zagathay. Caz ^^ and Morgat.
divides them into five principal sorts: which may likewise be subdivided
into many inferior branches or Hords. The first of these he calls Tartari
minor, or the less, which is in Europe betwixt Boristhenes and Tanais
comprehending Taurica Chersonesus, inhabited by the Precopite Tartars, or as
Broniovius Mart. Bronie. Tartaria.
terms them Perecopensis of Perecopia a town and Castle in Taurica: they
are called also Ossouenses and Crims, of two Towns bearing those names. These
are now subject to the Turk both in state and religion, having some Towns and
Mahumetane Temples, and monasteries and Turkish garrisons, and a few Temples
and persons Christian, of the Armenian, Grecian and Western profession. They
live in their homely cottages in the winter, but in the summer, wander in their
carts as the other Tartars, then whom they are somewhat more civil. They pay
three hundred Christians yearly to the Turk for tribute: of whom their Can,
since the time of Zelim, receives a banner, and his approbation to the Empire,
giving his children or brethren in hostage. They elect also an heir apparent
to their empire whom they call Galga, and if the Can will prefer his son to
that dignity: he kills all his brethren, as the Turks also deal with
theirs.

It should seem that they derive their pedigree from Cingis, descended (if I
may conjecture, where certain history fails) of some of the sons of
Bathy, the great Conqueror in those parts of the world. Lochton Can was the
first which ruled in Taurica: long since Bathy's time. They use the Chaldean
and Arabian letters: they have their Cadies to administer religion and justice,
as have the Turks. Of these Europaean Tartars L Chalcond. lib.3.
Bronionius, Maginus, and others have written a Discourse, to whom I refer
such as desire to know further of their affairs.

They count the Don or river Tanais holy, in respect of the commodities which
it yields them. These Tartars A Guag.de Sarmat. Sigism. ab Herberst Petr.
Bertius in tab. Chytroeus, Auton.
passing through the confines of Polonia and Podolia, to help the Turk in the
wars of Hungary, the ways being secured and defended with the garrisons,
they used a new stratagem to make way, by driving a multitude of Bulls before
them, which contrary to their expectation, affrighted with the Ordnance,
recoiled upon their driuers, treading them down, and scattering them. The
Chan, when St. Bathor King of Poland was dead, sent his ambassadors to be
elected their King; affirming, that their Pope should be his, their Luther his
also: and for dainties, horseflesh would content him. His suite was rejected
with laughter.

The second part in this division is attributed to Tartaria Deserta, so called
of the Desert huge tract of Country between Tanais, the Caspian Sea, and the
lake Kitay: sometime known by the name of Sarmatia Asiatica. It contains
many Tribes: of which the principal are, Zavolhensis, called Bulgar Tartars,
of Volga: between which river and Iaich they have their abode. This they
called the great Hord, and the Emperor thereof Vlucan, in the year 1506.
subdued by the Crim-Tartars before mentioned: and after that by Basilius the
Muscouite, to whose large style Bulgaria is added, taking that name of Volga,
as it were Volgaria, or of Bulgar a town upon that river. Cazan and Ashacan
Hords of these Zavol Tartars have been subject also many years to the said
great Duke, Gen^roeus de imperiis ex 4. sect. Mahum etc. P^.Camerar. Med.
histor. ^^ca.98.
who caused the Prince of Casan (being taken prisoner, when he was young) to be
baptized. Near unto Cazan is Vachen, ^^he people whereof are Gentiles; and the
Cheremizes half Gentiles, half Tartars, and Mangat or Nagay, Mahumetan
Tartars, which in the year 1558. were through civil wars, famine, and
pestilence, destroyed to the number of above a hundred thousand. These Nagayans
have their diverse hords subject to their several Dukes, whom they call Murzes,
having no use of money, corn, or Arts. They, in the time of their distress,
would for one loaf of bread, worth six pence, have sold son or daughter to
Master Ienk if he would have bought a thousand, although otherwhiles they
deride the Christians, as living on the tops of weeds (so they call our
corn.) This our Author and Countreyman traveled down the River Volga to
Astracan, which river, after it has run above two thousand English miles,
has threescore and ten mouths or falls into the Caspiansea. Through this
Sea he passed to Manguslaue an other part of the Desert Tartaria. The Prince
whereof Timor Soltan he found and saluted in a Regumq turres, Pauperum

little round house, not having Town or Castle, made of reeds, covered
without with felt, within with carpets, accompanied with the great
Metropolitan of their Country, esteemed of amongst that field-people, as the
Bishop of Rome is in most parts of Europe. And had he not presented himself
to him with the great Dukes Letters, he had been spoiled of all that he had.

They passed thence with a Carauan of Merchants twenty days, not finding
water, but as they drew out of old deep wells, brackish and salt: and passed
sometimes two or three days without the same. After that, they came to a Gulf
of the Caspian Sea again, where the water is fresh, and sweet. Not so the
people: For the Customers of the King of Turkeman tolled of every five and
twenty, one; and seven ninths, for the said King and his brethren. Into this
gulf the River Oxus did sometimes fall, but is now intercepted by the River
Ardock, which runs toward the North: and (as it were) loath to view so cold
a Clime and barbarous Inhabitants, after he has run with a swift race a
thousand miles, (as it were) in flight, he hides himself under ground for
the space of five hundred miles, and then looking up, and seeing little
amendment, drowneth himself in the Lake of Kithay.

Thence they had three days journey to Sellizure, where finding Azim Can, to
whom he presented a ninth, he received there the like festival
entertainment as before with Timor, that is, the Minimo con. tenta Natura.
flesh of a wild horse and mares milk without bread. He and his brethren
ruled all from the Caspian Sea to Vrgence, and had continual wars with the
Persians; and is called Turkeman: for the other Hords of that huge Tartarian
Desert, the Kirgessen, Melgomazan, Scibanski, Thumen (which still is said to
remain under the obedience of the Grand Can) Bascheridi, Heselits, harsh names
of harsher people in those most harsh and horride Deserts, will hasten my Pen
and your Ears, to some more pleasing subject. The Thumen and their neighbors
are great Inchanters, and by their Art (they say) raise tempests and
overthrow their enemies. The Kirgessen observe these stinking holies: Their
Ortelius.
priest mixeth blood, milk, and cow dung together with earth, and putting them
in a vessel, therewith climeth a tree, and after his devout exhortation to the
people, he besprinckleth them with this sacred mixture, which they account
divine. When any of them die, they hang him on a tree instead of burial.

The Tartars in Turkeman use to catch wild horses with hawks tamed to that
purpose, which seizing on the neck of the horse, with his beating, and the
horses chasing, tireth him, and makes him an easy prey to his master, who
always rides with his bow, arrows, and sword. They eat their meat, and say
their prayers sitting on the ground crosse-legged, spending the time very idly.
As master Ienkinson with his company traveled from hence toward Boghar, they
were assailed with forty thieues: of whom they had intelligence somewhat
before, and therefore certain holy men (for so they account such as have
been at Mecca) caused the Carauan to stay while they made their prayers and
diuinations touching their success. They took certain sheep and killed
them, and took the blade-bones' of the same, which they first sodde, and then
burnt, mingling the blood of the said sheep with this poulder of their bones
^with which blood they wrote certain Characters, using many other ceremonies
and words, and thereby diuined, that they should meet with enemies, which
after much trouble they should overcome: which accordingly proved true. Of the
faithfulness of these holy men he had good proof, both here and elsewhere
they refusing not to expose themselves to danger, and to forswear themselves
rather then betray him and the Christians to their theeuish Countrymen. For
these robbers would have dismissed the Bussarmans, so they call their
Catholics, if they would have delivered the Caphars, that is, infidells, as
they esteem the Christians, unto their power. One of their holy men (which the
enemies had surprised) by no torments would confess any thing to the prejudice
of his fellows. But at last they were forced to agree, and give the thieves
twenty ninths, that is, twenty times nine several things, and a Camel to
carry the same away. This Country of Turkeman or Turchestan is the first
habitation of the Turks, and the people were called by that name, both in
Haithons time, and in the time of Mauritius. Their Niceph. Call. libr.11.ca 30.
religion then was the same with that which we have above related of the
Tartars, worshipping the four Elements etc. as in the Turkish History you have
heard. Pliny names the Turks nearer Maeotis: but whether in devouring the
people with their swords, as they did the pastures with their cattle, they
came from hence, or these from thence, or that Pliny might easily wander in so
wandering a subject; all auerre, that from hence they went first into Persia,
and in succeeding ages have made many fertile Countries, like their Turcomania,
where Master Ienkinson says grows no grass, but heath whereon their
cattle feed: The Ottoman-horse blasting with his breath the ground he treads
on, (has according to their own Proverb) there never grows grass more.
The Turkeman Nation is (says Haithon) for the most part Mahumetan, and many of
them without Law at all. They use the Arabian Letters.

These Deserts and Thieves have almost made us forget our division, according
to which we^e should have told you, that from the Caspian Sea hither you must
(according to Maginus) call the Tartars generally Zagathayans, Marcus Paulus
li.1.
so called of Zagathay, the great Cans brother, sometime their Prince. Which
name G. Boter.
comprehends also diverse other Nations more civil then the former,
possessing the Countries sometime known by the names of Bactriana, Sogdiana,
Margiana, now Ieselbas, that is, Green heads, of the color of their Turbants:
differing from the Persians, whom they call for like cause, Redde-heads. These
have cruel wars continually with the Persians, whom they call Caphars (as
they do the Christians,) for their supposed heresy, of which in the Persian
relation has been showed, and for that they will not cut the hair of their
upper lips, for which they are accounted of the Tartars great sinners. In Ant.
Ienkins.
Boghar is the feate of their Metropolitan, who is there more obeyed then the
King, and has sometime deposed the King, and placed an other at his pleasure.
There is a little river running through the City, whose water breeds in them
that drink thereof (especially strangers) a worm of an ell long, which lies
in the leg betwixt the flesh and the skin, and is plucked out about the
anckle, with great Art of Surgeons well practiced herein. And if it break in
plucking out, the party dies. They pluck out an inch in a day, which is
rolled up, and so proceed till she be all out. And yet will not the
Metropolitan suffer any drink but water or mares milk, having officers to
make search and punish such as transgress, with great severity. Zagatai lived
the space of one hundred twenty and one years before Marcus Paulus, and was
(as he says) a Christian, but his son followed him in his kingdom, not in
his religion.

Here in this Country is Samarcand the City of Great Tamerlane (of some

Of him are many Histories written by some Leunclav. Peorend. louius etc.
that have lived since his time, and could not well know his proceedings, it
being generally deplored, that this Achilles wanted a Homer Cic. Orat. pro Arch.
, which Alexander applauded in him, but wanted for himself: only one Alhacen
(an Arabian which then lived) has written largely thereof, and that (as he
says) by Tamerlans command, which Iean du Bec, Abbot of Mortimer, in his
voyage into the East Country, met with, and had it interpreted to him by an
Arabian, and we upon his credit: which if any think to be insufficient, I
leave it to his choice and censure. That Author says, that Tamerlan descended
of the Tartarian Emperors, and Og his father was Lord of Sachetay, who gave to
his son Tamerlan (which name signifies heavenly grace in their Tongue) his
Kingdom while he yet lived, appointing two wise Counselors, Odmar, and Aly,
to assist him. He was well instructed in the Arabian learning, and a lover of
learned men. Nature had set in his eyes such rays of majesty and beauty,
that men could scarce endure to look on them. He wore long hair, contrary to
the Tartarian custom, pretending, that his mother came of the race of Sampson.
He was strong, and had a fair leg: whereas Leunclauius says he was called
Tamurleng, of his lamenesse. His first War was against the Muscouite, whom
he overcame: The second against the King of China, with like success (I
mention not his battles in civil wars:) The third against Bajazet the
Turk (whom he captiued) passing thither by the way of Persia; where Guines,
Author of the Sophian Sect, a great Astrologer, and accounted a holy man,
encouraged him with Prophesies of his good success. This War he made against
Bajazet in behalf of the Greek Emperor, and others, whom the Turk
oppressed. He went privately to Constantinople, and had sight of the City, with
all kindness from the Emperor. He invaded Syria and Egypt, overthrew the
Sultan, and won Cairo; destroyed Damascus, visited and honored Jerusalem,
and the holy Sepulcher, and granted great Privileges thereunto. The Princes of
Lybia and Barbary, by their Embassages in Egypt, acknowledged his
Soueraignetie: In his return by Persia he was encountered by Guines, who
brought with him an infinite number of sundry kinds of beasts, which he made
tame, and by which he taught men. As soon as he saw Tamerlan, he made his
Prayers toward the Heavens for his health, and for the Religion of the
Prophet, excommunicating the Ottomans, as enemies to the faithful believers.
Tamerlan gave him fifteen or sixteen thousand Some say 30000.
of his prisoners, which he instructed in his opinion: and after conquered
Persia, and so returned to Samarcand, where he had vowed to erect a Church and
Hospital, with all sumptuous Magnificence. Thence he went to Mount Althay, to
bury his uncle and father in law, the Great Cham, in whose State he succeeded.
He enriched Samarcand with the spoils gotten in his Wars, and called the
Temple which he there built, the Temple of Solomon, wherein he hanged up
Trophies and Monuments of his victories, and caused all his battles therein
to be engraven, thereby (said he) to acknowledge the Goodness of GOD. His
Religion was not pure Mahumetisme, for he thought GOD was delighted with
variety of worships; yet he hated Polytheisme and Idols, only one GOD he
acknowledged, and that with much devotion, after his manner. Thus he beat down
all the Idols in China, but honored the Christians, with great admiration at
the strict life of some Votaries. When Aly his Counselor was dead, he built a
stately Tomb for him at Samarcand, and caused Prayers to be said three days
for his soul. Being near his end, he blessed his two sons, laying his hand
on the head of Sautochio the elder, and pressing it down, but lifting up the
chinne of Letrochio the younger, as it were presaging unto him the Empire,
although the elder were proclaimed. But this Empire was too great, and too
suddenly erected to continue.

These three sorts of Tartars which we have hitherto mentioned, are all, for
the most part, Mahumetans. There are some yet (as Michonius Lib.1. cap.7.
affirms) near the Caspian Sea, which are not Mahumetans, nor shave their
hair of their heads after the Tartarian manner; and therefore they call them
Calmuch or Pagans.

The fourth are those which in greatness are first, namely the Cathayans, called
Carabus (that is, black-heads) of their Turbants, as the former, Ieselbas. But
of their religion, further then that which has been before expressed, we can
say little. And it seems by the relations mentioned in the former chapters,
that they are Gentiles or Christians, and not of Mahomets error. Chaggi Memet
Chag. Memet.
, a Persian Merchant, related (as in part is said before) to Ramusius, that he
had been at Campion, Daimir Can then reigning, and that until Camul, the
Westerly part of Tanguth, they were Idolaters and Ethnikes: from thence
Westwards, Musulmans, or Saracens. In the Epistle of Carualius Carval. Epist.
the Jesuit, it is reported by a Mahumetane Merchant, that they were
Christians, happily because of Images which the Idolaters and Pseudo-Christians
do equally worship.

The fifth and last form of our Tartars are those which abide in those places,
whence the Tartars first issued to ouer-whelme all Asia with their Armies, of
which is related at large in the ninth Chapter: of which, for want of probable
intelligence, I can say little more. Our Mappes place there the Hords of the
Danites, Nephthalites, Ciremissians, Turbites, and other, which some derive
from the dispersion (as is said) of the ten Tribes. Here is Tabor also, whose
King was by Charles the fifth, Emperor, in the year 1540 (as before is said)
burned at Mantua, for soliciting to Iudaisme.

Pope Innocent, King Jews of France (by means of Will. de Rubruquis) and the
King of Armenia, solicited (as you have partly heard) both the great Can, and
his chief Princes, to become Christians: and it is likely that the Tartars
might, if diligence had been used, and some Superstitions had not darkened the
Christian profession, have been thereunto persuaded, which many also of them
were, as appears in Haithon, Mat. Westmonast. and Vincentius.

But the Saracens, which had before polluted those Countries where the
Mahumetan Tartars now abide, by that sutablenesse of their Law to their
lawless lusts of Rapine and Poligamie, prevailed (as Michouius Lib.1.c.5.
reports) with Bathi and those other Tartars, to embrace Mahumet, and refuse
CHRIST. They say, Eissa Rocholla, that is, JESUS is the Spirit of the LORD;
Mahomet Rossolai, that is, Mahomet is the Justice of GOD. They obey (says he)
the Pentateuch of Moses, are circumcised, observe the legal Ceremonies: they
have no Bells, but every day cry, Lahi illo illoloh, which signifies, that
there is but one GOD. They profess themselves Ismaelites, the Christians they
call Dzintzis, that is, Pagans; and Gaur, Infidels See the Saracen History.
. They observe three Feasts: the first Kuiram, to which they prepare
themselves, with their thirty days Lent, and in that Feast offer Rams,
Birds, etc. The second they celebrate for All Souls, for which they fast a
month, visit the graves, and do works of mercy. The third they keep for
themselves and their own salvation, and fast twelve days.

Iosafa Barbaro l.1. apud Ram.
(a Venetian, which lived amongst the Tartars about the year 1437) says, That
they embraced not the faith of Mahomet generally, but as every man liked,
until about that time, in the days of Hedighi, a Captain under Sidahameth
Can, who first compelled them thereunto, being before free unto their
Idolatries, if they pleased. And of the other Tartars near the Zagathayans, he
says, That many of the^ were Idolaters, and carried Idols in the Carts: yea,
some of them used to worship whatsoeure Beast they first met with, after they
went abroad in the morning. Their neighbors, the Moxij, at a certain time in
the year, take a Horse, which they set in the field, with his four legs
tied to four posts, and his head to another post, fastened in the ground. This
done, one of the^ standing in a convenient distance, shoots him to the heart.
Afterward they flea him, and observing certain ceremonies about the flesh,
eat the same. The skin they fill with chafe, and in each of his legs
thrust a straight stick, that he may stand upright, as if he were alive.
Lastly, they go to a great Tree, and loppe therefrom as many boughs as they
think good, and make a Room or Sollar in that Tree, where they set this Horse
on this feet, and worship him, offering unto his Foxes, and diverse Beasts which
bear rich Furs; of which offerings the Trees hang full.

Master Ienkinson mentions a Nation living among the Tartars, called Kings;
which are also Gentiles, as are also the Kirgessen (of whom we have spoken)
and the Colmackes, which worship the Sun, as they do also a red Cloth,
fastened to the top of a Pole, and eat Serpents, Worms, and other filth.
Near to which he places (in his Map of Russia) certain Statues, or Pillars
of Stone, which sometimes were Hoords of Men and Beasts feeding, transformed by
divine power (if it be not humane error) into this stony substance, retaining
their pristine shape. These Nations are either Tartars, or, in manner of life,
like unto them, and may therefore pass under that general appellation. And
this may suffice touching the Tartarian Nation and Religion; which in the West
and South parts of their abode is Mahumetane, in the more Northerly and
Easterly, partly Heathenish, partly Jewish, or Moorish, or mixed, or as may
best advantage them, and most please them, wandering in opinion in like sort as
in their habitation.

But I have showed my self no Tartarian, whiles I dwell so long on this
Tartarian Discourse, happily herein as tedious to the Reader, as staying in one
place would be to the Tartar; a thing to him so abominable, as in anger he
wishes it as a Curse, Would GOD thou may abide in one place, as the
Christian, till thou smell thine own dung. Indeed this History, not
thoroughly handled before by any one, drew me along, and I hope will purchase
pardon to this prolixitie.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of the Nations which lived in, or near, to those parts, now possessed by the
Tartars: and their Religions and Customs.

FRom those Countries, inhabited by the Persians and Zagathayan Tartars
Eastward, we cannot see with M. Paulus his eyes (the best guides we can get for
this way) any Religion but the Saracen, till we come to Bascia, a Province
somewhat bending to the South, the people whereof are Idolaters and Magicians,
cruel and deceitful, living on Flesh and Rice. Seven days journey from hence
is Chesmur, wickedly cunning in their deuillish art, by which they cause the
dumb Idols to speak, the day to grow dark, and other marvelous things,
being the wellspring of Idols and Idolatry in those parts. They have Heremits
after their Law, which abide in their Monasteries, are very abstinent in eating
and drinking, contain their bodies in strait chastity, and are very careful
to abstain from such sins, wherewith they think their Idols offended, and
live long. There are of them many Monasteries: They are observed of the people
with great reverence. The people of that Nation shed no blood, nor kill any
flesh: but if they will eat any, they get the Saracens, which live amongst
them, to kill it for them. North-Eastward from hence is Vochan, a Saracenicall
Nation; and after many days journey over Mountains (so high, that no kind of
birds are seen thereon) is Beloro, inhabited with Idolaters. Cascar (the next
Country) is Mahumetane, beyond which are many Nestorian Christians in Carchan.
There are also Moors, or Mahumetanes, which have defiled with like
superstition the Countries of Cotam and Peym (where the women may marry new
husbands, if the former be absent above twenty days This Marriage admits no
Non-residence
, and the men likewise) and of Ciarcian, and Lop. From Lop they cross a
Desert, which asks thirty days, and must carry their victuals with them.
Here (they say) spirits call men by their names, and cause them to stray from
their company, and perish with famine. When they are passed this Desert, they
enter into Sachion, the first City of Tanguth, an idolatrous Province, subject
to the great Can: there are also some Nestorians and Saracens, where they have
had the Art of Printing these thousand years. They have Monasteries
replenished with Idols of diverse sorts, to which they sacrifice, and when they
have a male child borne, they commend it to some Idol, in whose honor they
nourish a Ram in their house that year, and after on their Idols festival,
they bring it, together with their son, before the Idol, and sacrifice the
Ram, and dressing the flesh, let it stand till they have finished their
prayers for their child's health: in which space (they say) their Idol has
sucked out the principal substance of the meat: which they then carry home to
their house, and assembling their kinsfolk, eat it with great reverence and
rejoicing, saving the bones in goodly vessels. The Priests have for their Fee
the Head, Feet, Inwards, Skin, and some part of the Flesh.

When any of great place dies, they Funeral obseruances in Sachion.
assemble the Astrologers, and tell the hour of his nativity, that they may
by their Art find a Planet fitting to the burning of the corpse, which
sometime, in this respect, attends this fiery constellation a week, a
month, or half a year: in all which time, they set before the corpse a Table
furnished with Bread, Wine, and other Viands, leaving them there so long as one
might conveniently eat them, the Spirit there present (in their opinion)
refreshing himself with the odor of this provision. If any evil happen to
any of the house, the Astrologers ascribe it to the angry soul for neglect of
his due hour, agreeing to that of his Nativity: They make many stays by the
way, wherein they present this departed soul with such cates, to hearten it
against the bodies burning. They paint many papers, made of the Barks of
Trees, with pictures of Men, Women, Horses, Camels, Money, and Raiment, which
they burn together with the body, that the dead may have to serve him in the
next world. And all this while of burning is the Music of the City present,
playing.

Chamul, the next Province, is idolatrous, or heathenish: for so we distinguish
them from Saracens, Jews, and Christians, which I would were not as guilty of
Idolatry as the former, in so many their forbidden Rites, although these have
all, and the other, part of the Scriptures, whereof those Heathens and
Idolaters are utterly ignorant. Here they not only permit, but account it a
great honor to have their wives and sisters at the pleasure of such strangers
as they entertain, themselves departing the while, and suffering all things to
be at their guests will: for so are their Idols served, who therefore for this
hospitality (they think) will prosper all that they have. And when as Mangu
Can forbad them this beastly practice, they abstained three years; but then
sent a pitiful Embassage to him, with request, That they might continue their
former custom, for since they left it, they could not thrive: who, overcome by
their fond importunity, granted their request; which they with joy accepted,
and do still observe.

In the same Province of Tanguth is Succuir, whose Mountains are clothed with
Rheubarbe, from whence it is by Merchants conveyed through the world. Campion
is the mother City of the Country, inhabited by Idolaters, with some of the
Arabian and Christian Nations. The Christians had there, in the time of M.
Polo, three fair Churches. The Idolaters had many Monasteries, abounding with
Idols of Wood, Earth, and Stone, covered with Gold, and artificially made, some
great, ten paces in length lying along, with other little ones about them,
which seem as their disciples, to do them reverence. Their religious persons
live, in their opinion, more honestly then other idolaters, although their
honesty is such, as that they think it no sin to lie with a woman, which
shall seek it at their hands; but if the man first make love, it is sinful.
They have also their Fasting-dayes, three, four, or five in a month, in which
they shed no blood, nor eat flesh. They have many wives; of which, the
first-married has the first place and pre-eminence. Here M. Paul lived about a
year.

Touching the Religion and Customs in Tanguth, the reports Ramusius.
of Caggi Memet in Ramusius (who of late years was in Campion) are not much
different. He says, That their Temples are made like the Christians, capable
of four or five thousand persons. In them are two Images of a man and woman,
lying in length forty foot, all of one Piece, or Stone: For which use they
have Carts with forty wheels, drawn of five or six hundred Horse and Mules,
two or three months journey. They have also little Images, with six or seven
heads, and ten hands, holding in each of them several things, as a Serpent,
Bird, Flower, etc. They have Monasteries, wherein are men of holy life, never
coming forth, but have food carried them thither daily: Their gates are
walled up; and there are infinite of Frier-like companions passing to and fro
in the City. When any of their kindred die, they mourn in white. They have
Printing, not much unlike to that which is used in Europe; and Artillery on
their walls very thick, as have the Turks. All the Catayans and Idolaters are
forbidden to depart out of their native Country. They have three Sciences,
Chimia, Limia, and Simia: the first, Alchymie; the second, to make enamoured;
the third, Iugling, or Magic.

Succuir also is, according to his report, great and fair, beautified with
many Temples. Their Rheubarbe they would not bestow the pains to gather, but
for the Merchants, which from China, Persia, and other places, fetch it from
them at a cheap price. Nor do they in Tanguth use it for Physic, as we
here, but with other ingredients make perfumes thereof for their Idols: and in
some places they burn it in stead of other firing, and give it their horses to
eat. They set more price by an herb which they call Mambroni cini,
medicinable for the eyes, and another called Chiai Catai, growing in Catay at
Cacianfu, admirable against very many diseases, an ounce whereof they esteem
as good as a sack of Rheubarbe; whose description you may see at large,
according to the relation and picture of the said Chaggi, in Ramusius: for (to
add that also) they have many Painters, and one Country inhabited only by
them. These Tanguthians are bearded as men in these parts, especially some time
of the year.

Northwards from Tanguth is the plain M. Paul.
of Bargu, in customs and manners like to the first Tartars, confining with
the Scythian Ocean, fourscore days journey from Ezina, in the North parts of
Tanguth, and situate under the North star. Eastward of Tanguth (somewhat
inclining to the South) is the Kingdom of Erginul, addicted likewise to
Ethnike superstitions, wherein yet are some, both Nestorians and Mahumetans.
Here are certain wild Bulls as big as Elephants, with manes of white and
fine hair, like silk; of which, some they tame, and betwixt them and their
tame Kine engender a race of strong and laborious Oxen. Here is found a beast
also, as big as a Goat, of exquisit shape, which every full Moon has an
apostemation or swelling under the belly, which the Hunters (at that time
chasing the said beast) do cut off, and dry against the Sun, and it proves
the best Musk in the world.

The next Easterly Country is Egrigaia, idolatrous, and having some Christians
of the Sect of Nestorius. But Tenduc, next adjoining, was at that time governed
by King George, a Christian and a Priest of the posterity of Presbyter John,
subject to the Grand Can. And the Grand Cans give commonly their daughters in
marriage to this generation and stock of Presbyter John. The most part of the
inhabitants are Christians, some Idolaters and Mahumetans being there also.
There be also that are called Argon, descended of Ethnikes and Moors, the
wisest and properest men in those parts. All the people, from hence to Cathay,
are Christian, Mahumetan, and Gentile, as themselves like best. In Thebet, the
next Country, the people in times past (says W.de Rubr.c.28. Odoricus says
the same.
Will. de Rubruquis) bestowed on their parents no other Sepulcher then their
own bowels, and yet in part retain it, making fine cups of their deceased
parents skuls, that drinking out of them in the midst of their iolitie, they
may not forget their progenitors. They have much gold, but hold it an high
offense to imprison it, as some do with us, in Chests or Treasuries: and
therefore having satisfied his necessity, they lay up the rest in the earth,
fearing otherwise to offend GOD. Cambalu is in the Northeast parts of Cathay:
and forty miles Westward from hence (all which way is enriched with Palaces,
Vineyards, and fruitful Fields) is Gouza, a fair City, and great, with many
Idoll-Monasteries. Here the way parts, leading Westward into Cathay, and
South-Eastward unto Mangi, or China. Tanifu and Cacianfu are Provinces, which
trend Westward from hence, inhabited with idolatrous Nations, and here and
there some of the Arabian and Christian profession, full of Cities. Cunchin and
Sindinfu are Ethnikes; as is Thebeth: where they have a brutish custom,
livert. reports the like custom in Calicut.
not to take a wife that is a virgin; and therefore, when Merchants pass that
way, the mothers offer unto them their daughters, much striving which of them
may be the most effectual bawd to her child. They taking to their pleasure
such as they like, gratify them with some Jewel, or other Present, which on
her marriage-day she wears, and she which has most of such presents,
brings the most accepted dowry to her husband, as testimonies of the great
favor of their Idols. This Thebeth contained sometimes eight Kingdoms, with
many Cities, but was now desolated by the Tartarians. There are great
Necromancers, which by their infernal skill cause Thunders and Tempests. They
have Dogs as big as Asses, with which they catch wild Oxen and all sorts
of Beasts.

Caindu is an Heathenish Nation, where, in honor of their Idols, they
prostitute their wives, sisters, and daughters to the lust of travelers; which
being entertained in the house, the good man departs, and the woman sets
some token over the door, which there remains as long as this
stallion-stranger, for a sign to her husband, not to return till the guest be
as well gone from her house, as honesty from her heart, and wit from his head.
They make money of Salt, as in Cathay of Paper. In Caraian also (a large
Province adjoining) there are some Christians and Saracens, but the most
Ethnikes, which are not discontented, that other men should lie with their
wives, if the women be willing.

Carazan is of like ir-religion; their souls captiuated to the Old Serpent,
and their bodies endangered to mighty huge bodies of The serpents of Carazan.
Serpents, ten paces long and ten spannes thick, which that Country
yields. They keep in their dens in the day, and in the night prey upon
Lions, Wolves, and other Beasts, which when they have devoured, they resort to
some water to drink, and by their weight leave so deep impression in the
sand, that hereby men knowing their haunt, do underset this their Tract with
sharp stakes, headed with iron, covering the same again with sand; by this
means preying on the spoyler, and devouring the deuourer; esteeming nothing
more sauourie then the flesh, nor more medicinable then the gall of this
Serpent. More Serpentine then this diet, was that custom which they used, when
any proper and personable Gentleman, of valorous spirit, and goodly presence,
lodged in any house amongst them: in the night they killed him, not for the
spoil, but that his soul, furnished with such parts of body and mind, might
remain in that house. Much hope of future happiness to that house did they
repose in so unhappy attempts. But the great Can killed this Serpent also,
overthrowing this custom in the conquest of that Province.

Cardandan confineth on the Western limits of Carazan. They make black lifts
in their flesh, rasing the skin, and put therein some black tincture, which
ever remains, Naked pride.
accounting it a great ornament. When a woman is delivered of a child, the man
lies in, and keeps his bed, with visitation of Gossips, the space of forty
days. They worship the ancientest person of the house, ascribing to him all
their good. In this Province, and in Caindu, Vocian, and Iaci, they have no
Physicians, but when any be sick, they send for their Witches or Sorcerers,
and acquaint them with their malady. They cause Minstrells to play, while they
dance and sing, in honor of their Idols, not ceasing till the Devil enters
into one of them, of whom those Sorcerers demand the cause Infernal Physic.
of the parties sickness and means of recovery. The 'Demoniake answers,
for some offense to such or such a God. They pray that God of pardon, vowing
that when he is whole, he shall offer him a sacrifice of his own blood. If
the Devil see him unlikely to recover, he answers, that his offenses are so
grievous, that no sacrifice can expiate: but if there be likelihood of
recovery, he enioyneth them a sacrifice of so many Rams with black heads,
to be offered by these Sorcerers, assembled together with their wives, and then
will that god be reconciled. This is presently done by the kinsmen of the
sick, the sheep killed, their blood hurled up toward Heaven. The Sorcerers
and Sorceresses make great lights, and incense all this visited house, making a
smoke of Lignum Aloes, and casting into the air the water wherein the
sacrificed flesh was sodden, with some spiced drinks, laughing, singing,
dancing in honor of that God. After all this reuel-rout, they demand again
of the Demoniake, if the God be appeased: if so, they fall to those spiced
drinks, and sacrificed flesh with great mirth, and being well apayed, return
home; if not, they (at his bidding) renew their superstition, ascribing the
recovery (if it happen) to that Idol: and if he dies notwithstanding, they
shift it off to the want of their full due, fleecing, or tasting the same
before, to the Idols defrauding. Thus they do in all Catay and Mangi. Thus
much out of the large Reports of Paulus.

Rubruquius tells the like of Cailar and Caracoram, where he had been in
these Catayan Provinces, concerning their Christopher or Giant-like Idols, and
Idol Temples: in one of which he saw a man, with a cross drawn with ink on
his hand, who seemed by his answers to be a Christian, with Images like to
that of Saint Michael and other Saints. They have a Sect called Iugures, whose
Hypocritical shauclings.
Priests are shaven, and cladde in saffron-coloured garments, unmarried, an
hundred or two hundred in a cloister. On their holy days they place in their
Temples two long forms, one over against another, whereon they sit with books
in their hands, reading softly to themselves. Nor could our Author (entering
amongst them) by any means break this their silence: They have, wheresoever
they go, a string about them full of nut-shells, like the Popish bead-rolls;
always they are uttering these words, Ou mam hactani, GOD thou know,
expecting so many rewards, as they make such memorialls of GOD. They have a
Churchyard, and a Church Porch, with a long pole on it (as it were a steeple)
adjoining to their Temples. In those porches they use to sit and confer. They
wear certain ornaments of paper on their heads. Their writing is downwards,
and so from the left hand to the right; which the Tartars received from them.
They use Magical characters, hanging their Temples full of them. They burn
their dead, and lay up the ashes in the top of a Pyramid. They believe there is
one GOD, that he is a Spirit: and their Images they make not to represent GOD,
but in memorial of the rich after their death, as they professed to
Rubruquius. The Priests (besides their saffron-iackets buttoned close before)
wear on their left shoulder a cloak, descending before and behind under their
right arm, like to a Deacon carrying the Houselboxe in Lent. They worship
toward the North, clapping their hands together, and prostrating themselves on
their knees upon the earth, holding also their foreheads in their hands. They
extend their Temples East and West in length; upon the North-side they build
(as it were) a vestrie; on the South a Porch. The doors of their Temples are
always opened to the South. A certain Nestorian Priest told him of so huge an
Idol, that might be seen two days before a man came at it. Within the Quier,
which is on the North side of the Temple, they place a chest long and broad,
like a table, and behind that chest stands their principal Idol, toward the
South: round about which, they place the other less Idols: and upon that chest
they set candles, and oblations. They have great Bells, like unto ours. The
Nestorians of those parts, pray with hands displayed before their breasts, so
to differ from that Iugurian Rite of joining hands in prayer. Thus far W. de
Rubruquis, who was there An. 1253. In Thebet (says Odoricus) resideth the
Abassi, or Pope of the Idolaters, distributing religious preferments to those
Eastern Idolaters, as the Roman Pope does in the West.

CHAP. XV.
Of other Northern people adjoining to the Tartars.

ABout the mouth of the river Ob, Zlata Baba. Ortel. G. B. B.
is said to be an ancient Idol, in form of an old woman, holding in each arm
a child, and a third at her feet, called by her worshippers (the Iugri,
Obdorani and Condorani) Zlata Baba, that is, the golden old wife, to which they
offer precious Furs, and sacrifice Hearts, besmearing the mouth and eyes of
the Idol with the blood. In the time of their sacrificing, the Priest demands
of the Idol touching things to come, and sometime receives answer.

The Samoyeds are Idolaters and Witches, observing devilish superstitions, as
witnesses Richard Johnson, who in the fifth of January, 1557. saw amongst
them, as R. Johnson, apud Hak.to.1.
follows. The Samoyeds about the banckes of Pechere, are in subjection to the
Muscouite, and when they will remove from one place to another, then they will
make sacrifices, in manner following. Every kindred does sacrifice in their
own tent, and he that is most ancient, is their Priest. And first the Priest
does begin to play upon a thing like to a great five, with a skin on the one
end like a drum; his drumme-sticke is about a span long, and one end is round
like a ball, covered with the skin of an Heart. Also the Priest has as it were
a white garland on his head, and his face is covered with a piece of a shirt of
male, with many small ribs, and teeth of fishes and wild beasts hanging
thereon. Then he sings, as we use here in England to hollow, whoope, or
shout at Hounds, and the rest of the company answer him with this Outes Igha,
Igha, Igha, to which the Priest with his voice replieth. And they answer him
with the selfsame words, so many times, till in the end, he become, as it
were, mad, falling down as he were dead, having nothing on him but a shirt,
and lying on his back. I perceived him yet to breath, and asked why he lay so:
they answered, Now does our GOD tell him what we shall do, and whither we
shall go. And when he had lien still a little while, they cried thus three
times together, Oghao, Oghao, Oghao, and as they use these three calls, he
rises with his head, and lies down again; and then he rose up and sang with
like voices as he did before, with the like answer, Igha, Igha, Igha. Then he
commanded them to kill five Ollens, or great Dear, and continued singing
still, both he and they as before. Then he took a sword of a cubit and a
spanne long (I did mete it my self) and put it into his belly half way, and
sometime less, but no wound was to be seen; they continuing their sweet song
still. Then he put the sword into the fire, till it was warm, and so thrust it
into the slit of his shirt, and thrust it through his body, as I thought, in at
his navel, and out at his fundament, the point being out of his shirt behind,
I laid my finger upon it. Then he pulled out the sword, and sat down.

This being done, they set a kettle of water over the fire to heat, and when
the water does sees, the Priest begins to sing again, they answering him.
For so long as the water was in seething, they sat and sang not. Then they
made a thing being four square, and in height and squarenes of a chair, and
covered with a gown very close the forepart thereof, for the hinder-part
stood to the tents side. Their tents are round and are called Chome, in their
language, The water still seething on the fire, and this square seat being
ready, the Priest put off his shirt, and the thing like a garland, which was
on his head, with those things which covered his face, and he had on yet all
this while a pair of hosen of Deere-skinnes, with the hair on, which came up
to his buttockes. So he went into the square seat, and sat down like a
Tailor, and sang with a strong voice or hollowing. Then they took a small line
made of Deere-skinnes of four fathomes long, and with a small knot the Priest
made it fast about his neck, and under his left arm, and gave it to two men
standing on each side of him, which held the ends together. Then the kettle of
hot water was set before him in the square seat, which seat they now covered
with a gown of broad-cloath without lining (such as the Russes use to wear).
Then the two men which did hold the end of the line, still standing there,
began to draw, and drew till they had drawn the ends of the line stiff, and
together; and then I heard a thing fall into the kettle of water, which was
before him in the tent. I asked what it was, and they answered, his head,
shoulder, and left arm, which the line had cut off, I mean the knot, which I
saw afterward drawn hard together. Then I rose up, and would have looked
whether it were so or not, but they laid hold on me, and said, that if they
should see him with their bodily eyes, they should live no longer. (And the
most part of them can speak the Russian tongue, to be understood, and they
took me to be a Russian) Then they began to hallow with these words, Oghaoo,
Oghaoo, Oghaoo, many times together: in the mean while I saw a thing like a
finger of a man, two times together, thrust through the gown from the Priest. I
asked them that sat near to me what it was, that I saw, and they said, not
his finger, for he was yet dead; and that which I saw appear through the gown,
was a beast, but what beast they knew not, nor would not tell. And I looked
upon the gown, and there was no hole to be seen. At last the Priest lifted up
his head, with his shoulder and arm, and all his body, and came out to the
fire. Thus far of their service, which I saw during the space of certain
hours. But how they do worship their Idols, that I saw not: for they put up
their stuff to remove from that place where they lay. And I went to him that
served their Priest, and asked him what their GOD said to him, when he lay as
dead. He answered, that his own people does not know, neither is it for them
to know, for they must do as he commanded.

The Hollanders in the year 1594. sent to discover a way to Cathay and China,
by the Northeast, Hak. Voy. to.1. Gerard de Veer ap. De Bry in 3 part. Ind.
Orient.
which by Master Borough, Pet and Iacman, English men, had been long before
in vain attempted. William Barentz was the chief pilot for this Discovery.
This year Nauig.1.
they sailed through the Straits of Vaygats, and thought themselves not far
short of the River Ob. The next year they returned for the same discovery.
They Nauig.2.
landed in the Samogithians or Samoyeds country, and named a place, because
they there found Images carved of wood, Idoll-nooke. They gave names to places
long before discovered by the English, as if they had been the first founders.
They learned of certain Muscouites, that the inhabitants of Noua Zemla, had
neither Religion nor Civility prescribed them by any Law, but worshipped the
Sun, Moon, and North-Starre, and every year offered unto them sacrifices of
Dear and other things. On the nine and twentieth of August there arose a
thick fogge, whereupon. Oliver Brunel (which had been three several years
sent by the King of Denmark, for the discovery of Groenland) reports that
in threescore and sixteen degrees, he had often observed such thick fogges,
that some perished thereby. These happened most commonly in October and
November. The last of August they had speech with the Samoyeds: they were of
Description of the Samoyeds.
short stature, scarcely four foot high, with long hair, broad faces, great
heads, little eyes, short and bow-legs, very swift, clothed with beasts skins,
whereof the hairy side was outward. They know no GOD. The Sun (whose presence
they are long deprived of in the Winter, which is recompensed in their
nightlesse Summer) is worshipped amongst them. And when the Sun is declining
out of their sight, the Moon, or North-Starre, is his receiver or successor
(if you will) in that tribute of their devotions. They have, besides, many
Idols rudely carved. In times past they had no King, but now they choose one to
that dignity. They bury their dead, and offer yearly their sacrifices for
them to the Sun, Moon, and NorthStarre, of their Dear, which they burn,
except the head and feet. They eat the flesh of wild beasts, either raw, or
dried in the air; which makes them have very unsavory breath. On the sixth
of September two of them went on shore, on the continent of Moscouia, and
encountered with a Bear, which killed one of them: his cry brought in others
of their fellows (which were also straggling about) to his reskue, but the
Bear laid hold also upon one of them, and could not be driven to forsake his
prey, till himself became a prey in recompense. The two torn carcasses were
there buried. They took off from one Bear, which they killed, an hundred
pound of fat, which served them for their lamps: the skin was nine foot
large, and seven wide.

In the year 1596. Nauig.3.
There were sent other two ships, to prosequute this Discovery, which on the
fourth of June had sight of a triple Sun, attended and guarded with a double
Rainbow, one encompassing them, the other crossing them overthwart. After many
dreadful combats with the ice, and one of the ships departing from the
other, they were forced to Winter in Nona Zemla; where they built them a house
to serve them for a fortification against the savage Bears, tempestuous
storms, continual snowes, ice, and unspeakable cold; and (if worse may be) a
worse then all these they endured, a continual night of many weeks, wherein
neither the Sun, nor any of his courtly train, the least rays to be the
harbengers of his desired presence, did present themselves to their eyes: and
the fire could scarcely prevail against the insulting tyranny of the cold, to
warm them. The Bears together with the Sun forsook them, but plenty of
Foxes remained; and with the Sun the Bears also returned: sometime laying
violent siege to their house. From the fourth of November till the seven and
twentieth of Iannarie they saw no Sun. Their watch also or clock was by
violence of the cold forced to stand still, that they could not measure their
times. Thus did they wait i^ expectation of the Suns return, that they also
(not able further to pursue the voyage) might return home, which eleven of
them did in October following.

But seeing these North-easterne seas are so frozen and impassable, I will
therefore in an inkie sea find an easier passage for the Reader, with more
both ease and security, to this mighty Kingdom of China, whereof we are next
to speak.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the Kingdom of China.

CHina is supposed of some, to be that country, whose people of Ptelomey
Ptol.Geog.l.7.c.3.
are called Sinae. Some think them to be the people mentioned by the Prophet
Esaias Es.49.12. Osor.in parap. Iun. Annot.
, whereunto Iunius also inclines. The Arabians call them ^^^ Tzinin: and the
Portugals first of all other (because they could not pronounce it aright)
called them Chinians (says Scal. Can. Isag. lib.3.
Joseph Scaliger): Pierre du Iarric, says, Pierre du Iarric lib.4.
del'histoire des Indes Orient. cap.17.
that before that time in all the East they were called Chijs, and the
inhabitants of Ceilan were called Chingales, because they were mixed with the
Chinois; and Cinamom, was of the Persians named Darchini, that is, wood of
China, as some think: he adds their opinion that derive that name from the
Chinian salutation, in which they use the word Chij, Chij, as a nickname
therefore given them: and others that think the City Chincheo gave name to
the whole Region: but it were tedious to recite here the several opinions in
this question; the difficulty whereof arises from this, that the Chinois
themselves know not this name, but call their country Tamen. Leaving therefore
these deriuations and names of Cin, Cauchin China, Battechina, and the rest;
let us come to the Country it self. It bordereth Gotard. Arthus hist. Indis
Orient.cap.49.
on the North, with Catay and the Tartars; on the South, with Cauchin China; on
the East, with the Sea; on the West, with the Bramas. It reaches from
seventeen degrees to two and forty of Northerly Latitude, and lies after
their own description Iac. Pantog.
almost four square. On the West it is separated and secure from vnneighbourly
neighbors, by a sandy wilderness; on the North, by a wall, which Nature has
partly framed of high mountains, and Art has supplied with the labor and
industry of men. It is divided into fifteen Provinces; six whereof border on
the Sea, Cantan, Foquien, Chequiam, Nanquin, Xantum, Paquin: the other nine be
inland, Qniansi, Huquam, Honan, Xiensi, Xansi, Suchnon, Qutichen, Iunan,
Coansi. Some reckon these names somewhat differently. The King holds his
Court in Paquin; his predecessors, before the Tartarian conquest of this
country, are said to have resided in Nanquin, or (according to the more
ancient writers) in Quinsay. Pantogia reports his own journey from Macao to
Paquin, the space of six hundred leagues, in all that space traveling but one
day by land, for shortning his way, otherwise all the way by water, carried in
a River, called of the Chinians a little sea for the greatness, abounding with
seafish, an hundred leagues up from the sea, and after that in another River
of like bigness, whose waters were thick and mirie, which they clarify with
allume, before they can drink it: all the rest of the streams that he passed
were made by men's hands,. These Rivers are abundantly stored with shipping of
two sorts; one for sailing, and the other for habitation: and from Nanquin to
Paquin the space of three hundred leagues, it seemed to be, as it were, a
continued street of ships: and though they came in the morning betimes to
Nanquin, yet were there the same hour above five hundred sail of vessels,
under sail ready to enter, which were laden with provision for the City. The
Kings ships in that Region about Nanquin, are reported to be about ten
thousand, to carry his tents and tributes, besides a thousand sail belonging
to private men. The ships wherein the Mandarines, or Magistrates and Officers
are carried, are not inferior in sumptuous stateliness to the ships Royal
in Europe. The Rivers are no less adorned and beautified with Cities, Towns,
and Villages, so many, as that in all this way they had always sight of one or
other: and so great, that sometime they sailed two or three hours with the
stream along the walls of some City. Their Towns and Cities have high
walls.

Nanquin stands in two and thirty degrees, and is eight or ten leagues from
the sea, with a River leading thither. All their Cities are alike, except in
bigness.
It has three fair brick walls, with large and stately gates. The streets
are of two leagues, or of two and a half in length, wide, and paued. The
compass is at least eleven or twelve leagues, and contains by conjecture two
hundred thousand houses, and (according to all the opinions of the Jesuits
there abiding) equalling, or exceeding in people four of the greatest Cities
in Europe. There are diverse other Cities within a days journey hereof, which
are great and famous for traffic, of which Hancheum and Sucheum are chief,
which are of the Chinians called Paradise, for the plenty of all things.
Sucheum is as Venice in situation, having her streets part by water, and part
on land; so rich in traffic, that the China-bookes do reckon twelve millions
of revenue to accrue from hence to the Kings coffers: and he that sees these
Cities (says the Jesuit) will believe those reports.

To stay here a while, That After I had written this, I was further confirmed
in my opinion by the relation of the City of Quinsay, largely written by
Contugo Contugbi in la 4. part del Thesoro politico cap.47. who is of the same
mind.
Quinsay, whilome the royal seat of the Kings of Mangi (as Venetus records)
now supposed to be swallowed up with some Earthquake, or in Bellonaes
all-consuming belly devoured, may seem to be here raised from the grave: the
waterie streets; the trade and revenue, exceeding alone (if some Botero Relat.
part.2.
account truly) any one the richest Kingdom in Europe: the situation in the
midst of China, and near to the sea; the signification, Quinsay being
interpreted, The City of heaven: and so is Suntien (in the discourse
Lib.1.cap.8.
of this Kingdom, translated by R. Park) said to signify. All these reasons
do move me to conjecture, that Quinsay is now by euersion of Earthquake,
wars, or both, and by diuersion of the Court from thence, converted into this
smaller Sucheum, the name also a little inuerted, remaining, as diverse
languages and dialects will suffer, almost the same. Or perhaps sickening
with so long wars (begun in the time of M. Paulus, and continuing in the
days of our countryman Mandeuile, almost an hundred years after, both of
them serving the great Came in those wars.) Quinsay at last, after so long and
tedious a consumpation, died, and bequeathed what suruiued those spoils, of
her land-greatnesse unto Nanquin, of her sea-treasures unto Sucheum, both
succeeding, but not together equalling (that wonder of the world) Quinsay,
M.Paulus lib.2.cap.68.
encompassing an hundred miles, and twelve thousand bridges, sixteen hundred
thousand households, with the country adjoining, then the ninth part of the
Kingdom of Mangi yielding sixteen millions and eight hundred thousand ducats
of gold, besides six millions, and four hundred thousand ducats for the
custom of salt, in yearly revenue to the great Of Quinsay see a particular
and large discourse by Con. Contughi.
Can. Well then may it beseem Sucheum, and Nanquin, both to have risen out of
the ashes of such a Phoenix. Hereto agrees the report of Nicolo di Conti (who
was there about the year 1440.) that the King had then built Quinsay anew,
thirty miles circuit. But let us listen to Pantogia.

These Cities of China want that elegance and magnificence, which stately
Temples, and sumptuous buildings do afford unto our Cities of Europe. Their
houses are low, without the ornament of porches, galleries, windows, and
prospect into the streets. In the Winter Ant. Dal. meida.
they have store of ice and snow, even about Nanquin. They have abundance of
all things necessary to the life of man, fruits, flesh, and fish, with prices
correspondent. They have two, and some where three, haruests in the year. Few
mountains, but plains of an hundred leagues. Wine they make of Rice. They
eat thrice a day, but sparingly. Their drink (be it water or wine) they
drink hot, and eat with two sticks of Iuory, ebony, or like matter, nor
touching their meat with their hands: and therefore little naperie serves
them. Their warm drinks and abstinence from fruits, are great preservatives
of their health, which for the most part they enjoy. The Chinians Description
of the Chinois.
have thin beards (not above twenty hairs) short noses, small black eyes,
long garments, and, if they would resemble a deformed man, they paint him with
short habit, great eyes and beard, and a long nose. They are white, but not so
much as in Europe. They have Artificers of all trades: and in idleness none
may live. The impotent are well provided for in Hospitals. They have no
Gentlemen, but every man is a Plebeian until his merits raise him. Preferment
is achieved only by learning. This makes them generally studious. Their
letters are not reduced into alphabeticall order, nor are properly letters, but
characters, whereof they have forty thousand; and therefore in that they frame
not difference of syllables, but of sense, in diverse languages, yea in Iapon,
their writing is understood, not their speaking. Their paper is like a thin
transparent parchment, and bears ink but on one side. Their writing is
downwards, not side-wayes, as ours. They have in ordinary and daily use eight
or ten thousand of those characters. Their words are monosyllables. Rhetorique
is the only science which they aim at: for he obtains places of honor,
which can most fitly place his words, and most eloquently write of the subject
propounded. They have not public Schools, but in the Cities are public
trialls or commencements every third year, whither these Probationers resort,
and are examined, and are accordingly preferred. They have three degrees:
Descrip. Mac.
Graduates of the first degree are called Siusai; of the second, Quiugin; of
the third, Chinzu, Every City yields trial for the first degree. For the
second, only the Metropolitan City of the Province; whereunto they of the
first degree do resort every third year, and in a public house, do the
second time, make an Oration, of some obscurer theme then the former. There are
such multitudes of them, that some are sometime killed in the entrance of that
their Commencement-house. For the third degree, they are examined only at the
Court the third year after. And out of this Order are taken their Mandarines
or Magistrates, after some study in the law of the Land. While they are
writing their Probationary Themes, they are shut up, with one to attend them,
four and twenty hours, with pen, ink, paper, and candle, and having
subscribed their names, certain Registers copy the said Orations, without
setting to the Authors names and then seal up their first patterns. Those
namelesse copies are by appointed Officers examined, and those chosen which
they approve for best; the names and authors are known, by comparing these
copies with the principal. In the first degree they obtain certain
immunities to themselves and their families; provided that he proceed in his
studies, or else they will degrade him. He that has obtained the third degree
of Loytia, or, Loutea.
Loytia (as they term it, or as we may style it, Doctor) writes it up over his
doors, that all men may honor his house: and this is the highest Nobility
whereto they can ascend. To the elder brother of these fellow-commencers, is a
triumphall arch erected, besides other solemnities. They have books, written
by certain wisemen or Philosophers two thousand years since or more, of
Political and Moral Philosophy; the Authors whereof they honor for Saints,
especially one Confusius, to whom the Mandarines do therefore once in the
year offer sacrifice, and the Kings do honor his posterity, unto this day.
And he alone in the pith and weight of his Sentences, may be compared to Plato
or Seneca, though far short of their elegant and eloquent phrase. Their
Printing is somewhat differing from ours, not joining the letters, but for
every leaf making a table with letters or characters on both sides. They print
also white letters in black, more atificially then we. Poetry, Painting, and
Music, are amongst them commendable qualities. Their learning is not so
exceeding, as the first Chinian relations report, in the Mathematikes and other
liberal Sciences. The principal Mandarines admire the Jesuits in these
things, who esteem the greatest learning of the Chinois, after their
valuation, to be nothing superior to that of the Romans, in the days of
Cicero: (although it cannot be denied, that Rome even then approached near her
highest top of humane Science) It were an endless work to recite the
admirable things of this huge Kingdom: and therefore I remit the Reader to
those diverse Authors, which have written treatises of them.

Yet out of these I hope the Reader will pardon me, to observe some thing
touching their polity and government. This kingdom is by themselves Perera.
called Tamen, and the Inhabitants, Tamegines: China is a mere stranger in
China. The King is absolute Monarch, and in revenue exceeds all the Princes
in Europe, and Afrike together: which arises out of that which is properly
called Census, the poll-money of his subjects Census.
(paying three Mazes, or half ducats) exceeding thirty Millions: and his
Tributum.
Tributes, out of the profits of the earth and their handicrafts, amounting to
six and twenty millions after their own books: His Vectigal.
Customs in Canton (one of the least Provinces) are near eight millions.
Pantogia summeth the whole at a hundred and fifty millions. His expenses are
exceeding great; all the Mandarines, Eunuchs or Courtiers, Soldiers,
Hospitals, and Priests receiving Stipends out of his Exchequer. The Kingdoms
adjacent are willingly refused of his King, whose predecessors sometime
possessed, after freed them, as bringing more burden, then profit: which of
late appeared in Corea, which the Iaponites invaded, the Chinois defended, as
abutting on the Frontires: but when the enemy left inuading, the defender
soon after voluntarily relinquished these new subjects. The King has one wife
and many Concubines, whose children inherit, if the lawful Wife be barren: as
even now it happened; An. Do^^. 1602.
Vanlia the present King being the son of a Concubine, as his apparent heir
also is. These women are so straightly kept that they are neither suffered to go
abroad, nor to speak unto their kinsfolks, which likewise receive no increase
of honor or authority by their kinswomens advancement. His Courtiers are
Eunuchs, whom their poorer Parents have gelded in their youth in hope of this
Court-preferment, where after they are admitted by that Manderine appointed to
this office, they are trained up under elder Eunuchs to be made serviceable.
Of this dross of mankind are supposed to be in the Court a hundred and
threescore thousand. This King is esteemed more tyrannical, then his
predecessors, neither does he ever come abroad, as they were wont once in the
year, to sacrifice in the Temple sacred to Heaven and Earth. His Palace is
far more spacious, but not equal in workmanship to those in Europe. It is
compassed with a triple wall, the first whereof might enuiron a large town.
Herein besides the many lodgings of the Eunuchs, are hills, groves, streams,
and other things of pleasure. The Jesuit Pantogia.
our Author says, that he passed eight huge Palaces before he came to the
lodgings of those Eunuchs, which were appointed to learn how to order their
Clockes or Watches, wherewith they had presented the King: and there were as
many beyond. And ascending up a tower, he saw Trees, Gardens, houses, exceeding
all that ever he had seen in Europe, who yet had been in many the most
sumptuous buildings therein. Within the third wall, is the King, with his
women, children, and such servants as are thither admitted. When the Heir
apparent is proclaimed, all his other sons are sent away soon after, and
confined to certain cities, where they nothing participate in affairs of
State: otherwise are honored as the Kings kindred, living in pleasure in their
Pallaceprisons, unto the third and fourth generation. The Kings Title is, Lord
of the world, and Son of Heaven. The Mandarines have their habit (both in
attire and language) in their judicial proceedings peculiar. Of these
Mandarines, (to omit them which are officers in each City) there are three
principal in each Province. The first has to deal in cases Criminal, and is
called Ganchasu: The second is the Kings Fosterer or Treasurer, and is called
Puchinsn: The Lieutenant for the wars, named Chumpin. These all are in
subjection unto the Tutan or Viceroy of the Province. All these Magistrates
bear office three years together, chosen always out of other Provinces, to
avoid corruption. They have an annual officer called Chaien, who makes
inquisition of all crimes, both of private persons, and Magistrates themselves.
None may execute the sentence of death, but by especial Commission from the
King. And therefore the Malefactors are consumed in the prisons. But they have
authority with certain Canes to bear men on the legs in such terrible
cruelty, that a few blows may either lame or kill the party. And therefore
no King is more feared then these Mandarines, who go (or are carried rather)
on men's shoulders in sumptuous chaires (such is their fashion) attended with
fifty or threescore Sergeants going before them, two and two in a rank, armed
and furnished with Halberds, Maces, Battle-axes, Chains, and these Canes: some
crying to give way, wherewith and the noise of those Chains, and Canes both
men and dogs, with mute silence give place. In the midst of their Cities
are palaces of the Kings for these officers to reside in. In Panquin and
Nanquin the multitude of these Magistrates is incredible, one of these Cities
containing more then two thousand and five hundred, as many as some-where are
of Citizens. These all twice a day hear causes, and execute justice. In
Panquin are six Mandarines, Presidents of so many several Councels. The first
of these is called the heavenly Mandarin for that his most ample power, which
entreats with the King for the preferment, Degradation, or correction of all
the Mandarines in the Kingdom: for not one of them is there whose office is
not by his Majesty confirmed or abrogated. The second is Master of the
ceremonies, both in humane magnificence, and divine saricfice. The third is
Head of the council of war. The fourth, is chief Treasurer. The fifth is
Surueyor, and Procurer general of the Kings buildings in his Palace, in the
walls of Cities, and such like. The last deals as Chief under the King in
causes criminal. These six are inferior to one order of Mandarines, which are
of the Kings Privy Council. These Magistrates are no way comparable in wealth
to the Nobles in Europe. Their sentence against guilty persons is without
solemn furniture of words: as, Let him have twenty strokes, more or less,
which by those Canine Cane-men is suddenly executed, the party lying grouelling
on the ground. These Canes are cleft in the midst, three or four fingers
broad: twenty or thirty blows will spoil the flesh, fifty or threescore will
ask long time to be healed, a hundred are incurable. They use also the
Strappado, hoising them up and down by the arms with a cord. They be above
measure patient in hearing causes: and their examinations are public.
Condemned persons have a pilloryboord fastened about their neck, and hanging
down before them to the knees, in which his felony or treason is expressed,
which board neither suffers them well to eat or sleep, and in fine kills
him. There be in every Metropolitan City four principal houses for those
three officers before mentioned: the fourth, for the Taissu, wherein is the
principal jail or prison, walled about, high and strong, with a gate of no
less force: within the same are three other gates before you come where the
prisoners lie, in the mean space are such as watch and ward day and night. The
prison within is so great, that in it are streets and marketplaces, and never
void of seven or eight hundred men that go at liberty. But by following Perera
(sometime a prisoner there) into his prison, I find my self almost imprisoned,
and therefore will flee hence into their Temples, and there take sanctuary.
Here they deal as madly with their Gods, as there with their men.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the Religion used in China.

HOw much the greater things are reported of this so large a Country, and
mighty a kingdom, so much the more compassion may it provoke in Christian
hearts, that amongst so many people there is scarce a Christian, who amongst so
ample revenues, which that King possesses, pays either heart, or name, unto
the King of Heaven, till that in so huge a vintage, the Jesuits of late have
gleaned a few ha^dsuls to this profession. M. Paulus, N. di Conti and Odoricus
call this country M. Polo. says that in Zipangu (or Iapon) they called in Cin.
Longobard says that the Mand^trines called the country about Canton Mangines,
that is, Barbarous rude and uncivil; as, far from the Cities Royal.
Mangi, which somewhat better agrees with Tamen and Tamegine, as (Perera
says) they call themselves, then China, which he thinks from the neighbor
country of Canchin-China was applied to this. It had (after Paulus) twelve
hundred Cities, after Odoricus, two thousand, and yet both they describe an
other large country of Catay more Northerly, that here again we may prevent
such scruples. Their Religion was then, and continues still (though with some
alteration) Idolatrous or Ethnike, and it is thought Gi. Bst. Ben.
that a great part of Asia, especially the Islands as far as Zeilan, and even to
Madagascar, borrowed some of their superstitions from hence, as hither they
sometime paid their tribute, until a fulness and fear of surfeit, caused the
Chinois as you have heard to let themselves blood, and willingly to relinquish
all that which they do not now enjoy. They were before the Tartarian conquest

given to Astrology, and observed Natiuities, and gave directions in all
matters of weight. These Astrologers or Magicians told Farfur the King of China

Chinsanbaian the Tartarian Captain, which dispossessed him of his state, and
conquered it to the great Can about 1269. This Farfur lived in great delicacie,
nor did ever fear to meet with such an Argus. He brought up yearly two
hundred thousand Infants, which their Parents could not provide for: and every
year on certain of his Idol-Holy-daies feasted his principal Magistrates,
and all the wealthiest Citizens of Quinsay, ten thousand person at once, ten or
twelve days together. There were then some few Nestorian Christians; one
Church at Quinsay; two at Cinghiansu, and a few others. They had many
Idol-Monasteries. They burned their dead: the kinsmen of the dead accompanied
the corpse, clothed in Canuas, with music and hymns to their Idols: and when
they came to the fire, they cast therein many papers wherein they had painted
slaves, Horses, Camels, etc. as of the Cathayans is before reported, to serve
him in the next world. They return, after their funeral rites are finished,
with like harmony of instruments, and voices, in honor of their Idols, which

affirms that at Kaitan or Zaiton, he found two Couents of Minorite-Friers,
and many Monasteries of Idolaters, in one whereof he was, in which (as it was
told him) were three thousand Votaries, and a hundred thousand Idols. One of
those Idols (less then some others) was as big as the Popish Christopher.
These Idols they feed every day with the smoke of hot meats set before them:
but the meat they late themselves. At Quinsay a Chinian convert led him into
a certain Monastery, where he called to a Religious person and said: This
Raban Francus, that is, this religious Frenchman comes from the Sunsetting,
and is now going to Cambaleth, to pray for the life of the great Can, and
therefore you must show him some strange sight. Then the said religious person
took two great baskets full of broken relics, and led me unto a little
walled park, and unlocked the door. We entered into a fair green, wherein
was a Mount in form of a Steeple, replenished with herbs and trees. Then did
he ring with a Bell, at the sound whereof many creatures, like Apes, Cats, and
Monkeys, came down the Mount, and some had faces like men, to the number of
four thousand, putting themselves in good order, before whom he set a
platter, and gave them those fragments. Which when they had eaten, he rung the
second time, and they all returned to their former places. I wondered at the
sight, and demanded what creatures they were. They are (quoth he) the souls of
Noble men which we here feed for the love of GOD, who governs the world.
And as a man was honorable in his life, so his soul enters after death into
the body of some excellent beast, but the souls of simple and rusticall people
possess the bodies of more vile and brutish creatures. Neither could I
dissuade him from the opinion, or persuade him that any soul might remain
without a body.

Their religion at this time is idolatrous and Pagan, wherein the common people
are somewhat Gotar Arthu^ cap.52.
superstitious, but the King himself and the Mandarines, as seeing the vanity
thereof, and not able to see the truth, are in manner irreligious and peofane:
the first worship that which is Nothing in the world, and these find nothing
in the world, but the world and these momentany things to worship. Yet do they
acknowledge a Deity of the Heaven and Earth, whereof the former Kings have
been more superstitiously obseruant: and this Vanlia also, when as some few
years since his palace was fired with lightnings, being guilty of his own
unworthiness, be commanded his son to pray unto heaven for reconciliation.
And although Pantog.
the Mandarines confine their happiness with their lives, yet some of them are
found admirable their gravity and constancy of resolution. This appeared
lately, when as the King, in love of his second wife or concubine, would have
preferred her son to the title of Prince and hope of succession, neglecting the
elder, which was the son of her, who among his women had the fourth place,
contrary to the laws and customs of China: they all assembled together and
presented a petition to the King, that forasmuch as he would not be
admonished to observe their ancient laws in proclaiming the lawful heir
apparent, that he should seek him new officers, and for their parts they
resigned their Manderine-robes; which the King (relenting) caused them to
resume, with promise of satisfaction to their demand. There have not wanted of
them which have publicly in writings (after their manner) expostulated with
him of his unjust courses: and one on this sort, Although O King, I know the
gibbet is already pitched for me, and the fire kindled to burn me, yet will
not I cease to reprehend thine injuries and public enormities. Amongst all
their idols, Discourse of China.l.2.
they observe with great reverence One, which they paint with three heads,
continually looking each on other. Others they have resembling the pictures of
the Apostles. These were the Philiosophers we spoke off, whereof three are
principal, Confusius, Xequiam and Tanzu. The first is in first and chief
account for the invention of part of their letters, for his holiness, and for
his books of Moral virtues. Upon the days of the New and full Moon, Dialog.

his disciples which are in manner all their men of learning, Mandarines and
students, do assemble themselves at the common school or commencement-house,
and before his Image (which is worshipped with burning of Incense and Tapers)
they do bow their knees thrice, and bend their heads to the ground. The
followers of the second are called Cen in China, and in Iapon, Bonzi, which
shave their heads and beards, and do for the most part inhabit the temples of
Xequiam, or of other Saints of that profession, rehersing certain prayers
after their manner on books, or beads, and have some inckling of the life to
come, with rewards answerable to the well or ill spent life. The third sort,
which follow Tanzu, differ in their long hair and some other ceremonies from
the former, but they both live in great contempt, as men unlearned and
ignorant, and are not permitted to sit beside the Magistrates, but kneel
before them, and are subject to their punishment no less then the Vulgar. They
wear on their heads a Tire like to a Miter (says Nuns:) twice was Mel^^i^r

at Cantan, and could find none of them which could so much as teach me their
own mysteries. Confusius his precepts prescribe the light of Nature as guide,
ascribing much to the heavens, to Fate, to the worshipping their forefathers
images, without mention of other God, in other things approaching nearest to the
the Truth. Nic. Longobard.
On the said Holidaies of the New and full Moon, a little before sun rising,
in all the Cities of this vast Kingdom, and in all the streets thereof at one
and the same hour, they make publication and proclamation of six Precepts.
First, Obey thy Father and Mother: Secondly, Reverence they elders and
superiors: Thirdly, Keep peace with thy neighbors: Fourthly, Teach thy
Children and posterity: The fifth enioineth every one to discharge his office
and calling. The last prohibiteth Crimes, as Murder, Adultery, Theft, and such
like. These things do their Mandarines cause to be observed; otherwise
Atheists, not having reason or reasoning of the immortality of the soul, and
future rewards, which yet some of their books and pictures of their Pao or
God, resembling those infernal torments, might learn them. Both Manderines
and others have many images in their houses to which they sacrifice. But
Admirande Reg. Sin.
if they obtain not their requests, they will whip and beat these Gods, and
then set them again in their places and with new incense seek their
reconcilement, renewing their prayers, and their stripes also, if their prayers
be rejected. And in a word the Manderines are the Gods (or Devils rather) whom
the people most fear, as dreading blows from them, which themselves at
pleasure can and do inflict on the other. This God-beating they use with
Lotts. Maffaus l.6. Disc. of china.
For when any is to undertake a journey or any matter of weight, as buying,
lending, marrying, etc. They have two sticks flat on the one side, otherwise
round, as big as a Wallnut, tied together with a small thread, which after
many sweet oraisons they hurl before the Idol. If one or both of them fall
with the flat side upwards, they revile the Image with the most opprobrious
terms: and then having thus disgorged their choler, they again crave pardon
with many fawning promises. But if at the second cast they find no better
fortune, they pass form words to blows, the deaf God is hurled on the earth
into the water or fire, till at last with his vicissitude of sweet and sour
handling, and their importunate reiterations of their casts, he must needs at
last relent, and is therefore feasted with hens, music, and (if it be of
very great moment, which they consult about) with a hogs head boiled, dressed
with herbs and flowers, and a pot of their Wine. They cut off the bills and
claws of their fowls, and the hogs snow^e, and do throw upon it grains
of rice, and sprinkling it with Wine, set it in dishes upon the Altar, and
there make merry before their Idols. They observe an other kind of Lotts with
sticks put together in a pot, and drawing out the same, consult, with a
certain book they have, of their destiny.

But to return to their variety of Idols. Friar Gaspar de la Crux, being in
Canton, entered a certain Religious house, where he saw a chapel, having
therein, besides many other things of great curiosity, the image of a woman
with a Child hanging about her neck, and a Lamp burning before her. The
mystery hereof (so like the Popish The picture of our Lady, and her blessed
son.
mystery of iniquity,) none of the Chinois could declare. The Sun, the
Moon, Stars, and especially Heaven it self, are Gods of the first form in
their Idollschoole. They acknowledge Laocon Tzantey, the Governor of the great
God (so it signifies) to be aeternall and a Spirit. Of like Nature they
esteem Causay, unto whom they ascribe the lower Heaven and power of life and
death. They subject unto him three other spirits, Tanquam, Teyquam, Tzuiquam:
the first supposed to be Author of rain; the second, of humane nativity,
husbandry, and wars; the third is their Sea- Neptune. To these they offer
victuals, odours, and Altarclothes: presenting them also with plays and
Comedies. They have Images of the Devil with Serpentine locks, and as
deformed looks as here he is painted, whom they worship, not to obtain any
good at his hand, but to detain and hold his hand from doing them evil. They
have many he and shee-Saints, in great veneration, with long Legends of their
lives. Amongst the chief of them are Sichia, the first inuentour of their
religious Votaries of both sects; Quanina, an anchoresse; and Neoma a great
Sorceresse. Friar Martin, in one Temple in Vcheo, told a hundred and twelve
Idols. In time of trouble they have familiarity with the Devil, as Pedro de
Alfaro observed, being in a Ship with the Chinois, in this sort. They cause a
man to lie on the ground grouelling, and then one reads on a book, the rest
answering, and some make a sound with Bells and Tabors. The man in short space
begins to make visages and gestures, whereby they know the Devil is entered
and then do they propound their requests, to which he answers by word or
Letters. And when they cannot extort an answer by word, they spread a Red
mantle on the ground, aequally dispersing all over the same a certain
quantity of Rice. Then do they cause a man that cannot write to stand there,
themselves renewing their former invocation, and the devil entering into this
man causes him to write upon the rice. But his answers are often full of lies.

It were taedious to tell of their opinions touching the Creation. All being a
rude and unformed Chaos, Tayn (say they) framed and settled the Heaven and
Earth. This Tayn created Pauzon and Pauzona. Pauzon by power of Tayn created
Tanhom, and his thirteen brethren. Tanhom gave names to all things, and knew
their virtues, and with his said brethren multiplied their generations, which
continued the space of ninety thousand years. And then Tayn destroyed the
world for their pride, and created another man named Lotzitzam, who had two
horns of sweet savor, out of which presently did spring forth both men and
women. The first of these was Alazan, which lived nine hundred years. Then did
the heaven create another man. ( Lotzitzam was now vanished) named Atzion,
whose mother Lutim was with child with him only in seeing a Lions head in the
air. This was done in Truchin, in the province of Santon: he lived 800 years.
After this, Vsao and Hantzui, and Ocheutey with his son Ezoulom, and his Nephew
Vitei the first King of China, (they say) were the inuenters of diverse Arts.

They have Discourse of China. l.2.
many Monasteries of four differing orders of Religion, distinguished by the
several colors of their habit, black, yellow, white and russet. These four
orders are said to have their Generals (whom they call Tricon) which reside in
Panquin. These ordain Prouincials, who again have subordinated to them the
Priors of several houses or Colleges, in those their houses acknowledged
chief. The General is clothed with silk in his own color, and is carried
on men's shoulders in an Iuory chair by four or six men of his habit. They
live partly of revenues given them by the King, and partly by begging: which
when they do, they carry in their hands a certain thing, wherein are prayers
written, whereon the alms are laid, and the giver thereby cleared of his
money. I should have said, of his sin. They are It seems that some Romish
Friars have been there of old
shaven, use beads, eat together, and have their Cells, assist at burialls,
arise two hours before day to pray unto the heaven and Sinquian, who (they
say) was the inuenter of that their manner of life, and became a Saint, in
which their devotion they continue until break of day, singing and ringing of
belles. Once, both the Friars which formerly, and the Jesuits which later have
been there, affirm a great conformity betwixt their and the Chinian
ceremonies. They may not marry in the time of their Monkish devotion, but they
may (acquainting the Generals therewith) at their pleasure relinquish their
vow. The eldest sons may not enter into religion, because they are bound to
sustain their aged parents. At the admittance of any is a great Feast, made by
their friends. At the launching of any Ship, they dedicate the same to the
Moon, or some Idol: and besides there resort thither these Monks, to make
sacrifices in the poope, and reverence the Devil, whom they paint in the
fore-castle, that he may do them no harm. Else would she make an
unfortunate voyage. Mass.l.6^:
The religious men, as is said, are shaven, the people wear long hair, in
combing whereof they are womanishly curious, these hoping by their locks to
be carried into heaven, the other, professing a state of greater perfection,
refuse any such help. There be of their religious more, austere, Jacob
Anton.1603.
which live (in Deserts and solitary places) the lives of Heremites. They have
hills consecrated to Idols, whither they resort in heaps on pilgrimage:
hoping hereby to merit pardon of their sins, and that after their death they
shall be borne again more Noble and wealthy. Some of these will not kill any
living creatures, especially such as are tame, in regard of this their
Pythagorean opinion of the ^^^^^^.
transanimation or passage of souls into beasts. The Jesuits converted one
man near unto Nanquin, which had thirty years together observed a fast; not
strange among the Chinois, never eating flesh or fish, and on other things
feeding temperately. Usurers are punished in China, with the loss of that
money so employed.

Of their Priests is before showed, that they have both secular and regular:
Scalant. ap Ortel.
the one wears long hair and black clothes, and has private habitation:
the other live in couents, and are shaven. Neither may marry, though both do
(and not here alone) far worse. They much commend in their books Nic. Longobar
the consideration and examination of a man's self, and therefore do esteem
highly of them which sequester themselves, from humane society to divine
contemplation, that (as they say) they may restore themselves to themselves and
to that pristine state, wherein the Heaven created them; And therefore have not
only Colleges of learned men, who leaving the affairs of state and secular
distractions, do in private villages live together, observing these
contemplations with mutual conferences: but even women also have their
Nunneries, and live a Monastical life under their Abbesses after their manner:
although even such as are married live closely enough; their feet to this end
so straightly swaddled in their infancy, that they grow but little, (and to have
little feet i^ with them great commendation) whereby they can not but lamely
walk abroad. And if any Widow refuse a second marriage, she obtains hereby
much praise, and many privileges. Their Bonzij are so little accounted of,
that the Jesuits wearing their habit were little set by, and therefore taking
the Mandarine-habit, of that apparel in learned men were exceedingly honored
of all sorts.

Many are the ceremonies which they there observe in Funerals. As they honor
their parents in their life time, (being otherwise liable to grievous
punishments, yea some of their Mandarins will sue for the Kings license to
leave their public function to give private and more diligent attendance to
their parents) So after their death they mourn three years in white hattes
and garments. The first months they girde unto them a rough vesture with a
rope, like the bare-foote Friars. This is not only observed of the meaner
sort; but the mightiest Mandarins, after news of their fathers death, leave
their function, and in their private houses bewail their loss. The wealtheir
sort keep them above ground two or three years in a Parlour fitted for that
purpose, whither they daily refort unto them, to salute them, and to burn
Incense, and set meats before them. Sometimes also the Bonzij, or Priests,
resort thither with their Dirges and holy things. Their wives, children, and
neighbors come likewise to bewail them. The Mandarins will not use those
things which before they did: not the same Apparel, House-hold-furniture,
Salutations. They color part of the paper in which they write, with another
color. They observe not their wonted proper names, but call themselves
otherwise, as disobedient, or such like. Music is banished: their diet is
hard. When the corpse is to be buried, all the kindred come together, and
assemble as many Priests as they can, which on musical instruments, and with
their voices tune, their mournful Ditties. The place whither the corpse is
carried, is adorned with diverse Images. The coffin is very large, the providing
of which they commit not to their heir, but themselves in their lives take
order for the same, bestowing great care and cost for the best wood and
workmanship which they are able to procure, wherein spending sometime seventy,
eighty, or a hundred ducats. They hold it unfortunate to die before they have
provided the same. They are no less curious for the place of their burial,
thinking that hereon depends the fortune of their posterity, and therefore
sometime spend a whole year in consultation, whether it shall be toward the
North, or some other region. Their Sepulchers are in the fields, where they
fortify them, and often times resort thither to perform their obsequies. To be
buried within the walls were a thing most miserable, never to be forgotten. And
for some time after they will eat no flesh, in regard of that passage of
souls before spoken of. This opinion is of more authority and credit with
them then that of Hell or Heaven, although (as is said) their Books and
Pictures depaint terrible things in that kind. Others Mass and Discourse of
China.
add, that as soon as one is dead, they wash him, and clothing him in his
best apparel, all perfumed, set him in his best chair, and there all his
nearest kindred kneeling before him, take their leave with tears. They coffin
him (as before) and place him in a room richly furnished, and cover him with a
sheet, in which they paint his portraiture. A Table stands by full of viands,
with candles on it. Thus do they keep him fifteen days, every night the
Priests executing their superstitious exequies, burning and shaking certain
papers before them. By the Sepulcher they plant a Pine tree, which is sacred,
and may not be cut down, nor converted to any use, if the weather overthrow
it. Their funeral pomp is in manner of Procession, with candles carried in
their hands. They burn upon the grave many papers, painted with men, cattle,
and provision for his use in the next world.

The times religious are the new Moons, and full Moons (as ye have heard) in
which they make great banquets, and then also they muster their soldiers, who
alone may wear weapons in China. They solemnize Prera.
also their birth-dayes, whereunto their kindred do resort of custom with
presents, and receive good cheer. The Kings birthday is a great festival.
But Discourse of China.
New-yeares day, which is the first day of the new Moon in February is their
principal feast, and then they send New-yeares-gifts to each other.

Their order for the poor may be a pattern unto Christians: they suffer none
to beg, nor to be idle. If any be blind, yet he is set to some work, as
grinding in a querne, or such like; of which sort (after G.B.B.
Boterus account) there are four thousand blind persons that grind still in
Canton alone. If they be impotent, that they cannot work, their friends (if
they be able) must provide for them; if not, they are kept in Hospitalls, out
of which they never pass, and have all necessaries provided them by Officers
appointed in every City to this business. Common women are confined to
certain places and may not go abroad, nor dwell in the City, for infecting
others, and are accountable to a certain Officer of their evil earnings,
which when they are old, is bestowed on their maintenance. Their dwelling is in
the Suburbs of cities.

The Law of Nations is little respected in China. Ambassadors are in manner
imprisoned for the time of their abode, their affairs being entreated of by
the Mandarins; who think no Nation worthy to deal with their King, in any
equal terms of Embassage. Osor.li.11.
Petreius the Portugal Ambassador was imprisoned at Canton, and there died.
Prowder people are not under heaven then they. Long nails is an honorable
sign, as of hands not employed to base and manual labors. They think no
Books so learned as their own, which their ancient men take pains to conne
by heart, as boys in Schools, and their Professors do read with subtle and
curious exceptions, distinctions, and observations on the Text. They thought
the Popedom must needs befall the Jesuits at their return into Europe, for
the learning which they had gotten in reading these Chinian Authors.

In their Temples they have a great Altar, after the Dutch fashion, that one
may go round about it. There set they up the Image of a certain Gal.Perera. Co

: whom they worship with great reverence that come thither to ask counsel,
or draw lots. Besides these Temples, which they call M^ani they have another
sort, wherein both upon the Altars and walls stand many idols well
proportioned, but bare-headed. These bear the name of Omith son; accounted of
them spirits, but such as in heaven do neither good nor evil, thought to be
such men and women as have chastely lived in this world, in abstinence from
fish and flesh, fed only with rice and sallads. Of that Devil they make some
account: of these spirits little or nothing at all. They hold opinion, that if
a man do well in this life, the Heavens will give him many temporal
blessings: but if he do euill^ then shall he have infirmities, diseases,
troubles, and penury, and all this without any knowledge of GOD. They imagine
also, that they which live here well, presently after death shall become
Devils, if otherwise, that then this Devil does transanimate his soul (as is
said) into a dog or other beast. And therefore do they sacrifice unto him,
praying that he will make them like unto himself. Linschot.c.23
When a man lies on his deathbed, they set before him the picture of the
Devil, with the Sun in his right hand, and a poniard in his left, and desire
the patient to look well on him, that he may be his friend in the future
world. They liked the Christian manner of praying, and desired us (says
Perera) to write them somewhat concerning Heaven, which we did to their
contentation. They are great Sodomites, although they have many wives and
concubines, which they buy of their parents, or in the markets, in like manner
as the Turks. They are not by Law prescribed to observe this or that Sect:
and therefore they have many sects, some worshipping the Sun, some the Moon,
some nothing: and all, what themselves best like, as is in part before showed.

Antony Dalmeida A. Dalmeida. 1580.
says, That in saying Mass, they were so thronged with the people, that they
were almost trodden under foot. And of a Chinian Priest (contrary to the zeal
elsewhere in any Religion) they were invited to dinner, and feasted together
with many other of their Priests that used them kindly. Amongst them he
observed, that the Devil had taught them in many things to imitate the sacred
ceremonies (it is the Jesuits phrase) of the Catholic Church. At Ciquion also
(a City like to Venice) they provided themselves of a house, on both sides
whereof dwelt these Bonzi, or Chinian Priests, who used them gently, and daily
resorted to them to hear their doctrine; and some of them desired Baptism: so
little is this Religion prised of her forwardest Scholars. This I note by the
way, lest these reports should seem to contradict themselves, relating the
devotion, and manifold superstitions, and yet supine negligence, atheisine, and
polytheisme, professed and practiced in these large confines according to each
man's choice. And as Pantog.
that Religion, which of the one sort is practiced, is against the light of
reason, that a man (as Tertullian says) should be merciful or cruel (as
these Chinois are) unto their Gods: So the other (and especially they which are
most learned) neither hope nor fear any thing after death, and ascribe this
unto their happiness, that they are not touched with such (as they suppose
them) superstitions fancies. Yet even they which ascribe no Divinity to their
Idols, observe their Country-customes of sacrifices and offering unto them.
Their Temples are not so sumptuous as some report, but mean, and meanly kept.
They consult, not only with their gods, (as you have heard) but with their
Wisards and Fortune Tellers; whereof they have great store. They are
exceedingly addicted to two vain studies of Alchimy, wherein if they have not
so good success as he is the West, which (as La Nou Discourse.
La Nou says) turns so little Lead in his Bulls into so much Gold, yet
they use as religious and costly diligence: (for besides much silver lost, to
find silver, many of them seek to better their fortune in this attempt, with
many years fastings:) The other is to prolong their life, for which they
devise a thousand Arts and Compositions. Of both these studies they have
diverse Books and Professors. There be which fable themselves to be very old,
unto whom is great recourse of Disciples, as to some heavenly Prophets, to
learn lessons of long living. They supposed the Jesuits, (whom they took to
be of great learning) did not truly tell them their age, but suspected, that
they had already lived some ages, and knew the means of living ever, and for
that cause abstained from marriage.

The Discourse of China p.207.
Chinian salutations are so full of ceremonies, beyond any people, that I dare
not salute them, for fear of tediousness. Religion it is yet unto me to pass
unsaluted that Religion which I read observed by them in intertainement of the
Spaniards of the Philippina's. They were feasted by the Viceroy; and two
Captains appointed Stewards, or Feast-maisters, before they sat down, did
take each of them a cup full of liquor in his hand, and went together, whereas
they might discover the Heaven, and offered the same to the Sun, adding many
prayers, that the coming of their guests might be for good, and then did fill
out the wine, making a great courtesy. And then proceeded they to their feast.

will destroy them, and pacify him with many sacrifices and prayers; they hold

describes a huge Lake in the Province of Sancij, made by inundation, in the
year of our Lord 1557. wherein were swallowed seven Cities, besides Towns and
Villages, and innumerable multitude of people: one only child in a hollow
tree escaping so great a destruction. Such as escaped drowning, were, as
Boterus adds, destroyed with fire from Heaven. From this work of Divine
Justice I might pass to those admirable works of humane industry amongst
them: Of Pantogia.
which sort are (besides that wall continued by the joint agreement of Art and
Nature some hundreths of leagues; and their printing) their artillery far
short of that excellency of ours, or rather more excellent, as more
favorable; their soldiers pieces not having barrells above a spanne long, and
their great artillery of little use: their porcellane and fine earthen dishes;
their sailing wagons, and other things, may not be further described for fear
of prolixitie: all which are so much the more to be admired, because they are
their own inventions, and not borrowed. The opinion of Scaliger Scal.Exer.92.

This Country has few in it of other Religions. The Tartars conquered it, and
possessed the same about two hundred years, and were expelled at last by a
Bonzi, whose posterity still enjoy the Scepter. There are still about Paquin
and many other places of the kingdom, some Tartars which have their Moschees,
and observe Mahumet. They differ in countenance from the Chinois. Perera says
he saw at Fuquien certain Moors, who could say little of their Religion, but,
Mahomet was a Moore, my father was a Moore, and I am a Moore, with some other
words of their Alcoran, where withal, in abstinence from swines flesh they
live, (says he) until the Devil take them all. He reasoned with them,
because he had in many Chinish cities seen the relics of Mahomet kept; and
they answered, That they came in great ships, fraught with Merchandise from
Paquin-ward, to a Port appointed to them by the King, where they converted to
their Religion the chief Mandarin or Loytia; whereupon the people began to
turn Mahumetane. They now waxing bolder, prohibited the eating of swines
flesh, the peoples chief food: who hereby provoked, complained of a
conspiracy betwixt these Moors and the Loytia, against their King. Hereupon
he and the chief of them were executed, and the rest dispersed into certain
Cities, where they remained slaves to the King.

Mathaeus Riccius learned of certain Mogore-strangers, that in the Xensian
Province the north part of China, in a place called Xucheo, there are white men
with long beards, which use Bells, and worship Isa, that is, JESUS and Marie,
and honor the Crucifix. Their Priests were married, and cured diseases without
medicines. The former part of this report agrees just with that of Carvalius,
before mentioned in the eight Chapter, touching Cathay, which Geographers place
next heereunto.

The Jesuits have three or four places of residence; But the Laborers are
few, and their harvest nothing so plentiful as in other places, which they
impute to the hardness of learning the Chinian language, and especially their
writing in so many Characters not distributed into any Alphabeticall order: to
be exact in which, is required a good part of a man's age: their inhospitall
Laws to prohibit strangers entrance into their Country, and suspicion of them
when they are entered; their Epicurean opinions and lives; their addicting
themselves to ancient customs; the conceit of their own learning; their
pride, cruelty, extortion, polygamie, and such like. Themselves can in their
Epistles and Tractats Pier.du Iarric.lib.4.

Boterus ascribes unto China seventy millions of people, whereas he allows
to Italy scarce nine, and to Spain less, to England three, to all Germany,
with the Switzers, and Low Countries, but fifteen, and as many to all France.
Lamentable it is, that the devil should have so great a tribute in this one
kingdom. Gonsales (in his Discourse of China, translated by Parker) reckons
almost seven millions of soldiers in continual pay.

In the later Literae a Mat.Ric.
Epistles from China, dated 1606. and 1607. little is there to further this
History. As for their tales of Miracles in those and the Iaponian Epistles
(bearing the same date) wherein Ignatius Loyola's picture is made a
miracle-worker; I hold the^ not worth relation. At Nanquin was a conspiracy of
3 thousand people, to make a new King, but they were executed and quartered for
their treason. The Chinois believe (as is there reported) that there is a
certain spirit which has power of the life and death of children that are
sick of the measells, and therefore when their children are sick thereof,
they hang a Glass before the door of the Chamber where he lies, that the
spirit coming to destroy the child, seeing his Image in that Glass, should
not dare to approach nearer. Their baptism cured the disease: a new remedy for
measells; a new virtue of baptism.

I thought it not impertinent here to add the Catalogue of the Kings of this
Country, according History of China.
to their own Stories, which although it be in part fabulous, (as what
ancient profane Story is not?) yet, because I have done thus in other
Nations, and have so worthy a pattern in this, as the Worthy of our Age

Josephus Scaliger, pardon me to trouble thee with this Chronicle of their
Kings.

The first was Vitey, a Giant-like man, a great Astrologer and Inuenter of
Sciences; he reigned a hundred years. They name after him a hundred and
sixeteene Kings (whose names our Author omitteth) all which reigned two
thousand two hundred fifty and seven years: all these were of his lineage: and
so was Tzintzon the maker of that huge wall of China which killed many of the
Chinois, of whom he took every third man to this work. For which cause they
slew him when he had reigned forty years, with his son Agnizi. They
ordained King in his stead Auchosau, who reigned twelve years; his son Futey
succeeded and reigned seven years; his wife eighteen; his son, three and
twenty: then followed Guntey, four and fifty; Guntey the second, thirteen:
Ochantey, five and twenty: Coantey, thirteen: Tzentzey, six and twenty and
four months: Anthey, six: Pintatey, five: Tzintzumey, three and seven
months: Huy Hannon six: C^oum, two and thirty: Bemthey, eighteen: Vnthey,
thirteen: Othey, seventeen: Yanthey, eight months: Antey, nineteen years:
Tantey, three months: Chitey, one year: Linthey, two and twenty years:
Yanthey, one and thirty years: Laupy, one and forty years: Cuythey, five and
twenty years: Fontey, seventeen years. Fifteen other Kings reigned, in all,
one hundred seventy and six years. The last of which was Quio^tey, whom Tzobu
deposed, who with seven of his lineage reigned three score and two years: Cotey,
four and twenty years: Dian, six and fifty years: Tym, one and thirty
years: Tzuyn, seven and thirty years: Touco with his lineage (which were one
and twenty) reigned two hundred ninety and four years: Bausa a Nun, wife
of the last of them (whom she slew) one and forty years: Tautzon slew her, and
reigned with his posterity (which were seven Kings) one hundred and thirty
years: Dian, eighteen years: Outon, fifteen years: Outzim, nine years and
three months: Tozon four years: Auchin, ten years: Zaytzon, and seventeen
of his race, three hundred and twenty years: Tepyna the last was dispossessed
by Vzon the Tartar, under whom, and eight of his Tartarian successors, China
endured subjection ninety and three years; Gomb^ expelled Tzintzoum the last
of them. He with thirteen successors have reigned about two hundred and forty
years.

OF THE EAST INDIES: AND OF THE SEAS AND ISLANDS ABOUT ASIA, WITH THEIR
RELIGIONS.
THE FIFTH BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Of India in General, and of the ancient Rites there observed.

THe name of India, is now applied to all farre-distant countries, not in the
extreme limits of Asia alone, but even to whole America, through the error of
Columbus and his fellows; who at their first arrival in the Western world,
thought that they had met with Ophir, and the Indian Regions of the East. But
the Ancients also comprehended under this name a huge Tract of Land, no less
in the judgment of Alexanders followers, in his Eastern Invasions, then the
third part of the Earth; Ctefias accounted it one half of Asia. Ptolomey
Ptol.lib.7.
and other Geographers, did usually divide India by the River Ganges, into two
parts, one on this side Ganges, and the other beyond. Although here we find
no less difficulty concerning Ganges, which the most account the same with
Guenga, that falls into the Gulf of Bengala, which they also imagine to be
that, which of the Ancients is called Sin^^s Gangeticus: Other
Market.tab.^muers.Magin. G^ag. G. Arthus bi^. Ind. Or.
esteem the River Cantan (whereon Cantan chief City of one of the Chinian
Provinces, whereof we have so lately taken our leave) to be that Ganges: Of
which mind are Mercator, Maginus, Gotardus Arthus, and their disciples. M.
Paulus M. Paulus lib.3.
divides India into three parts, the Less, the Greater, which he calls
Malabar; and Aba^siae, betwixt them both. Dom. Niger Nig.Com. As.x.
reckons the same number; the first, from the River Indus (whence this name
India flowed) unto Barius, he calls Caisarat: the second or middle, from
thence to Caberis, Miniber: from thence Eastward to Ganges, he names Maabar,
and all these on this side Ganges: beyond it placing Magin, or Mangi. Ptolomey
makes the Sinae, to be next beyond India extra Gangem, on which he abutteth
them on the West: and therefore if Sinae be China, then are they by him placed
quite beyond India: and therefore Mercater and Maginus esteem Cathay to be
the Region of the Sinae.

It is our part to leaute this matter to the discussing and deciding of others,
and to hold on our perambulation through this wide and spacious Region: first
relating the generalities and antiquities thereof: and next proceeding from
China (where we left) unto the next adjoining Nations, certainly reputed
Indian, how uncertain soever Ganges runs, whether on this side, or beyond
them: to which when we have added our survey of the Islands adioning to the
Continent of Asia, we may end this Book, and our promised Asian Discovery.
Under the name of India, here we comprehend all that Tract between Indus and
the Persian Empire on the West, unto China Eastward, as it trendeth betwixt the
Tartarian and the Indian Seas.

Semiramis first invaded India, as Ninus her husband had done before to
Bactria, but not with like success. For although she had thought to have
encountered the Indian Elephants with her counterfeits made of Oxe-hides, sowed
together in that shape, and stuffed with Hay: for which use she caused three
hundred thousand beasts to be slain, which might both serve in the battle for
show, and beforehand to exercise her horse to such sights; and, if we believe
Diodor.Sic.lib.2.cap 5. Ex Ctesia.
Antiquity, mustered in her huge army no less then three millions of
footmen, and five hundred thousand of horse: Yet Stanrobates, at that time the
Indian Monarch, brake her Forces, and chased her out of the field.

In these first times the Indians Caelius Rhodig.lib.18.cap.31.
are said to live like the Scythians, without houses, Cities, Temples, in a
wandering course with their Tents, living on the bark of the tree Tala, and
wild Venison, the skins whereof were their garments. In all India were no
servants, but all freemen. These things were altered by Bacchus or Dionysius,
who made an Expedition hither, not so much with Arms, as with Arts. He taught
them the use of wine, oil, and sacrificing: in memory whereof, Posterity
honored him for a god. Of this the Poets, and histories of Alexander, and
others make much mention. So does Suidas tell of one Brachman, that prescribed
the Rites and Laws of the Brachmanes: Solinus, of Hydaspes; and others, of
Ganges, Hercules, and the rest, with much uncertainty. The first certain
notice of those parts was by Alexanders invasion and conquest, who yet pierced
but a small way in this vast part of the world, except that little we have of
the Persians exploits in these parts. The Strab.lib.15. S.Aurel, Victor.
Romans were hindered by the Persians and Parthians, from passing hither with
their armies, although their Ambassages be reported, both to Augustus, and long
after to Antonius Pius.

Strabo in his fifteenth book is large in this Indian subject. He reports
out of Aristohulus, that the River Indus, by force of an Earthquake, changed
his channel; thereby a great part of the neighbor Region being turned into a
desert. For in this, Indus is like unto Nilus, in that, without it, the
Country would be a wilderness, and therefore is also worshipped of the
Inhabitants. It receives fifteen other Rivers into it. He mentions the
Cathei not far from thence, which after happily gave name unto Cathay. To let
pass the strange Creatures, which some ascribe to these parts, as Dragons of
incredible bigness, those great Apes, which by imitation of men in array, made
Alexanders Camp to arm themselves against so ridiculous au enemy.

The Indians are seven sorts: Plin.l.6.c.19. Ar.lib.8.
The first in estimation, and fewest in number, were their Philosophers. These
kept public Acts once a year before the King, and he which in his observations
was found three times false, was condemned to perpetual silence. The second
sort were husbandmen, which paid the King (the only owner of all the land) a
fourth part of the increase. The third was of shepherds and huntsmen, which
wandered in Tents. The fourth Artificers. The fifth soldiers. The sixth
Magistrates. The seventh Courtiers, and those of his Privy Counsel. If any
woman kills the King in his drunkenness, she is rewarded with the marriage
of his son and heir.

If any deprive another of a member, besides like for like, he loses his hand;
and, if it be an Artificer, his life. They strangle their ^, that it may be so
offered whole to their Idols.

Of their Philosophers, or men learned and religious, the Brachmanes.
Brachmanes obtain the first place, as being nearest in sect to the Greeks.
These are after their manner Nazarites from the womb. So soon as their mother
is conceived of them, there are learned men appointed which come to the mother,
with songs, containing precepts of chastity. As they grow in years they
change their Masters. They have their places of exercise in a grove nigh to the
City, where they are busied in grave conferences. They eat no living
creatures, nor have use of women; live frugally, and lie upon skins. They
will instruct such as will hear them, but their hearers must neither sneese,
nor spit, nor speak. When they have in this strict ^oor so spent seven and
thirty years, they may live more at pleasure and liberty, in diet, habit,
proper habitation, and the use of gold, and marriage. They conceal their
mysteries from their wives, left they should blabbe them abroad. They esteem
this life as man's conception, but his death-day to be his birthday unto that
true and happy life, to him which has been rightly religious. They hold the
world to be created, corruptible, round, ruled by the high GOD. Water they
imagine to have been the beginning of making the world; and that besides the
four Elements, there is a fifth Nature, where of the Heaven and Stars
consist. They in^reate of the immortality of the Soul, and of the torments in
Hell, and many such like matters.

The The Indian Germans.
Germans another Order of religious on learned men, are honored amongst them:
especially such of them as live in the woods, and of the woods, both for their
diet of those wild fruits, and their habit of the barks of trees, not
acquainted with Bacchus or Venus any more then with Ce^es. They speak not to
the Kings, when they ask counsel of them, but by messengers; and do pacify
the angry gods, as is supposed, by their holiness.

Next in honor to these, are certain Mondi^^nts, which live of Rice and
Barley, which any man at the first asking gives them, together with
entertainment into their houses. These profess skill in Physic, and to
remedy diseases, wounds, and sterilizie; very constant in labor and hardship.
Others there are, Inchauters and Diuiners, Masters of ceremonies about the
dead; which wander through towns and Cities. Some there are more civil and
secular, in their life professing like piety and holinesle. Women also are
admitted unto the fellowship of their studies in this Philosophy, not to their
beds. Aristobulus writes, that he saw two of these Brachmanes, the one an old
man shaven, the other young with long hair, which sometimes resorted to the
Marketplace, and were honored as Counselors, and freely took what they
pleased, of any thing there to be sold, for their sustenance. They were
anointed with Sesamine oil, wherewith, and with honey, they tempered their
bread. They were admitted to Alexanders table, where they gave lessons of
patience Practice of prescribed patience.
: and after going to a place not far off, the old man lying down with his
face upward, sustained the Sun and showers terrible violence. The younger
standing on one foot, held in both his hands a piece of wood of three cubits
lifted up, and shifted feet, as the other was weary: and so they continued
every day. The young man returned home afterward, but the old man followed the
King, with whom he changed his habit and life, for which, when as he was by
some reproved, he answered that he had fulfilled the forty years exercise,
which he had vowed. Onesieritus says, that Alexander, hearing of some
religious Obseruants, which went naked, and exercised themselves to much
hardship, and would The like stubbornness is yet in their Iogbies.
not come to others, but would bid men, if they would have any thing with them,
to come to them; sent him unto them, who found fifteen of them twenty
furlongs from the City, each of them observing his own gesture of sitting,
standing, or lying naked, and not stirring till Sunsetting, in that
unsupportable heat, at which time they returned into the City. Ca^anu^ was
one of them. He afterward followed Alexander into Persia, where beginning to
be sick, he caused a great pile or frame of wood to be made, wherein he placed
himself in a golden chair, and caused fire to be put to, in which he was
voluntarily consumed, telling (if they tell true) that he would meet Alexander
at Babylon, the place fatal to Alexanders death. This Caianus told Onesicritus
of a golden world, where meal was as plentiful as dust, and fountains
streamed milk, honey, wine and oil. Which Country, by men turned into
wantonness, Jupiter altered and detained, imposing a life of hardness and
labor, which while men followed, they enjoyed abundance; but now thar men
begin to surfeit and grow disobedient, there is danger of universal
destruction. When he had thus spoken, he bade him, if he would hear further,
strippe himself, and lie naked upon these stones. But Mandanis, Arr. calls
him Dandanis.lib.7.
another of them, reproved Calanus for his harshnesse, and, commending
Alexander for his love to learning, said that they inured their bodies to
labor for the confirmation of their minds against passions. For his nakedness
he alleged, that that was the best house which needed least furniture of
household. He added that they searched the secrets of Nature, and that returning
into the City, if they met with any carrying figs or grapes, they received
of him gratis; if oil, they powered it on them: and all men's houses and goods
were open to them, even to the parlors of their wives. When they were entered,
they imparted the wisdom of their sentences, as the other communicated his
meats. If they feared any disease, they prevented the same with fire, as was
now said of Calanus. Megasthenes reproves this Calanus, as Alexanders
trencher-Chaplaine, and commends Mandanis, saying, that when Alexanders
messengers told him that he must come to the Son of Jupiter, with promise of
rewards, if he came, otherwise menacing torture: he answered, that neither was
he Jupiters son, nor did possess any great part of the earth: as for
himself, he neither respected his gifts, nor feared his threatenings; for
while he lived, India yielded him sufficient; if he died, he should be freed
from age, and exchange for a better and purer life. Whereupon he says,
Alexander both pardoned and praised him. Clitarchus reports also, that to the
'Brachmanes are opposed another Sect called Pramne, men full of subtlety and
contention, which derided the studies of others in Physiologie and Astronomy.
He divides the Brachmanes into those of the mountains, clothed in Deeres
skins, which carried scrippes, full of roots, and medicines, which they
applied with certain charms to cure diseases: and the second sort he calls
Gymnetae, those naked ones before mentioned (whereof it seems they were
called Gymnosophistae) which had women amongst them, but not in carnal
knowledge: the third he calls Civil, which lived in Cities and Villages,
wearing fine linen, and apparelled in skins. Nicolans Damascenus says, Nic.
Damasc. Suetonius mentions this, in vita Augusti.cap.21.
that at Antiochia he saw the Indian Ambassadors, sent to Augustus from Porus,
the King (as his letter contained) of six hundred Kings, with presents, among
which was a female Viper of sixteen cubits (one of like bigness Strabo says
he saw sent out of Egypt) and a Cray-fish of three cubits, and a Partrich
bigger then a Vulture. Zarmonochagas, one of these Indian Philosophers, was one
of the Ambassadors, who at Athens burned himself, not moved thereto by
adversity, but by prosperity, which had in all things followed his desires,
left in his succeeding age it might alter: and therefore entered the fire,
anointed, naked, laughing. His Epitaph was: Here lies Zarmanochagas the
Indian, of Bargosa, which according to his Countrey-custome, made himself
immortal.

Suidas tells of a Nation called Brachmanes, inhabiting an Island in the sea,
where Alexander erected a pillar, with inscription, that he had passed so
far. They live an hundred and fifty years, and have neither bread, wine,
flesh, nor metals, nor houses, but live of the fruits, and clear water, and
are very religious. Their wives live apart on the other side Ganges, to whom
they pass in July and August, and after forty days return home again. When
the wife has had two children, she neither knows her husband after, nor any
other man; which is observed also, when in five years he can raise no issue
of her, he after abstaineth. These Io. Boem.
slay no beasts in sacrifice, but affirm that GOD better accepts unbloody
sacrifices of Prayer, and more delights in man, his own Image.

or Brachmanes both Aftronomie and Rites of Religion, with which he after
instructed the Persian Mag^. None Arrian.lib.1.
might sacrifice without one of these to direct him, who only among the Indians
had skill of Divination, and authority to sacrifice, and were free from other
services.

The Indians are said to worship Jupiter, Ganges, and other Heroes of their
Country. Some of the Indian Nations accounted it dishonorable (as they do
also at this day) for the wives not to be burned with their deceased husbands.
Thomas Dorotheus in vita Barthol. and Them.
the Apostle preached the Gospel to the Indians, and so did Bartholomew also,
and destroyed their Idols (which wrought great wonders amongst them) Astaroth,
Beirith, and Waldath, as Abdias Pseudo Abdias. Bab.Epise.
reports, who even in this History may easily be convinced to be
counterfeit, in ascribing the names and religions of the Grecians, Juno,
Neptune, Berecinthia, to the Indians; besides those unchristian reuenges, in
killing so many of their adversaries, and old Heathenish, new Popish
Ceremonies, fathered on those Apostles.

To let pass that Abdias, a fit Bishop of that mystieall Babylon:
Genesisdi.lib.6.cap.26.
Alexander ab Alexandro reckons among their gods the greatest trees (to cut
which, was with them a capital crime) and a Dragon, in honor of Liber Pater.
Hercules they honored in a Giant-like statue, whose daughter Pandaea, the
Pandeans say, was their first Queen. These affirm, that in the hill Meros,
which they account sacred to Jupiter, is a cave wherein Liber or Bacchus was
nourished; from whence the fable grew, that he was borne of Jupiters thigh;
for so ^^^ signifies. Some of the Indians (says Solin.cap.55.
Solinus) kill no beasts, nor eat flesh; some live only on fish. Some kill
their parents and kinsfolks, before age or sickness withers them, and
devour their flesh, an argument not of villainy, but piety amongst them. Their
Plin.l.7.c.2.
Gymnosophists, from the Sunne-rising to the setting, fix their eyes on the
bright orb of the Sun, thence observing certain secrets. Hereunto he adds
the tales of men with dogs heads; of others with one leg, and yet very
swift of foot: of Pigmeis, of such as live only by sent: of hoary infants; of
some like Polyphemus, with one eye in their forehead; of others with ears to
the ground, wherein many of the old writers are Poets, and the modern,
Painters, as in many other monsters of men and beasts. We seek credit with the
wise, and not admiration of fools.

The Al.ab.Al.lib.4.cop.17.
Indians never sacrificed, or saluted their Idols without dances. They were
never rewarded with military honor or spoil, except they brought into the
Camp an enemies head in their hand. They punished perjury with the loss of
fingers and toes; and such as deceived their Clients, with perpetual silence;
and besides, they were disabled unto any Office. Their Laws are not written;
their contracts without seals, or witnesses.

In the hills, Laur. Coruin.
called Hemodi, Bacchus is said to have erected pillars, to witness his
Conquest, as far as that Eastern Ocean, as Hercules did in the West. He
built the City Nysa, where he left his sick and aged soldiers, which
Alexander spared, Arrian.lib.5.
and suffered to their own liberty, for Dionisius or Baecchus his sake. And
as Bacehus erected Pillars, so did Alexander Altars to the twelve chief gods,
as high as towers, monuments of his far travels, where he observed solemn
games and sacrifices. He Arrian.lib.6.
sacrificed also, not to his country gods alone, but to Hydaspis, Acesine, and
Indus, Indian rivers, and to other gods, with other Rites and sacrifices, then
he had before used: drowning a golden bowl in Indus, and another in the Ocean,
in his Ethnicke superstition. To him did the Indian Magi (so does Arrianns
Arrian.lib.7.
call their Brachmanes) say, that he was but as other men, saving that he had
less rest, and was more troublesome, and being dead, should enjoy no more
land, then would serve to cover his body. And every man (said they) stamping
with their feet on the ground, has so much as he treads on. Eusebius
Eusebius.de praep. Euang. lib.6.cap.8.
recites out of Bardesanes Syrus, that amongst the Indians, and Bactrians,
were many thousand Brachmanes, which as well by tradition, as law, worshipped
no Image, norate any quick creature, drank no wine nor beer, only attending
on Divine things: whereas the other Indians are very vicious, yea some hunt
men, sacrifice, and devour them, and were as Idolaters.

Pliny besidee his relations of monsters in these parts, tells of their
Philosophers (called Gymnosophists like things to that, which is before
mentioned of their beholding the Sun from the rising to the setting, with
fixed eyes, standing on the hot sands all day-long, on one foot by course.
Toothache, with other diseases of the head and eyes, spitting, and other
sicknesses, are either exiles or strangers to the Indians. Tally says,
Tusc.quaest.lib.5.
that in this naked plight these Philosophers endure the cold of Winter, and
snowes of Caucasus, while they live, and the burning fire at their end without
any plaining. The Indian women also strive which shall be married to her
husbands corpse, in a fiery chariot, riding with him into another world..

Philostratus in his large Legend of the life of Apollouius Tyanaeus, their
Philosophical Saint, relates Phil.l.2.c.4.
his pilgrimage into India, to the Brachmanes, in which he came to Nysa, where
was a Temple of Bacchus built by himself, planted about with Bays, Vines, and
Iuie, whose shady roof covered the same. In the midst was an Image: all
instruments belonging to the Vintage were there, some of gold, others of silver
hanged up, sacred to Dionysius. He after Cap.9.
came to Taxilla the City royal, where he found the Temple of the Sun, and
in it, the Iuory Image of Ajax, with golden statues of Alexander: and
ouer-against the same, brazen Images of Porus. The walls of read marble shined
like fire, interlaid with gold, resembling lightning. The Mosaical floor
pouldred with pearls. The King here offered sacrifice to the Sun. For the
peppertrees, Lib.3.cap.1.
which (he says) are great, and abound with Apes, who gather the pepper for
the Indians gratis, brought thereunto by a wile of the Indians, who first
gather some, and lay it on heaps, and then go away: at their return, finding
many the like heaps made by the aemulous Apes, I leave it to the Authors
authority, and Readers credulity: as that also which follows of the
Inhabitants of Paraca in these parts, who by eating a Dragons heart and liver,
attain to understand the language (if so I may term it) of beasts. And if you
marvel at this, Cap.3.
that which follows will amaze you; of men which do not, as the former,
communicate with the nature of beasts, but of spirits, making themselves at
their pleasure invisible. Here in a holy hill was a pit, whereof no man
drinks, by which the Indians bind their faith, as by the most solemn and
inviolable oath. In this pit was a fiery receptacle, where men were purged from
their offenses: and two tubs (of Whetstones, I should say) of raines and
winds, the one being opened yielding raines, and the other, winds.

In this place were many Indian, Grecian, and Egyptian statues, with their
Rites observed accordingly. This hill was reported the middle of India, and
every noone-tide they sing Hymns to the Sun for that fire, borrowed (they
say) from his beams. The Brachmanes sleep on the ground, on herbs strewed
two cubits thick, that by this elevation they might more signify their
devotion to the Sun, whom they laud night and day. He found Cap.4.
Iarchas their principal, with seven associates, sitting on Thrones of Brass.
Iarchas could tell Apollonius his Name, Nation, and Adventures, which had
befallen him all his life. They anoint themselves, then wash in a fountain,
and after this, being crowned, enter the Temple in solemn Procession, with
Daunces, smiting the ground with Rods, wherewith the earth, like unto waves,
did move and raise it self. Iarchas being asked by Apollonius, what he thought
of himself and his company, answered, That they were Gods, because they were
good men: that he himself had sometime been Ganges, and Apollonius before had
been an Egyptian Mariner, an attendant which there waited on them had been
Palamedes, whose misfortunes we read of in the wars of Troy, thus in new
bodies presenting themselves to the world. The world, he said, was a living
creature, compounded of five Elements, with diverse other things of Pygmeys,
which lived under the Earth, of Gryphons, etc. Thus much I thought to add of
Apollonius, because some vain Philosophers have impudently compared him to our
Savior, that the Reader might parallel this Legend with the Gospel out of
this darkness, the more to admire that more then admirable Light. And thus
much out of Philostratus, of the Brachmanes. The Gymnosophists are by him
placed, and by that name known, in Egypt and Aethiopia, whither also
Apollonius went to visit them.

differ from that of the Chinois.

would bring on them the imputation of Heretics. Some Merchants of Siam being
at Canton, and hearing that Friar Martin Ignacio and his companions, were there
imprisoned, for ^^^ that Chinian Kingdom without license, they visited them,
and seeing their poor Friars weeds, they, besides other alms, offered to pay
their ransom, if money would do it.

The Siamites G. Bot.B^^.l.2.part.3.
commonly hold, that GOD created all things, rewards the good, punishes the
bad: That man has two Spirits; one good, to keep; and the other evil, to
tempt, continually attending him. They build many and fair Temples, and place
in them many Images of Saints, which sometime lived virtuously, and now are in
Heaven. They have one Statue fifty paces long, which is sacred to the Father
of men. For they think that he was sent from above, and that of him were borne
certain persons that suffered Martyrdom for the love of GOD. Their Priests
are clothed in yellow long garments. (This color is esteemed holy, and every
yellow thing, for the resemblance which it has with Gold, and with the Sun,
is hallowed to GOD.) Besides that which is before said of their strict orders,
they may not nourish Hens, because of their female Sex. To drink Wine, is
punished in their Priests with stoning. They have many Fasts in the year, but
one especially, in which the People frequenteth the Temples and their Sermons.
They have their canonical hours by day and night for their holy things. They
hold, that the World shall last eight thousand years, whereof six thousand
are passed, and then it shall be consumed with fire: at which time shall be
opened in Heaven seven eyes of the Sun, which shall dry up the Waters, and
burn up the Earth. In the ashes shall remain two Eggs, whence shall come
forth one man and one woman, which shall renew the World. But there shall be no
more Salt, but fresh Rivers and Lakes, which shall cause the Earth, without
man's labor, to abound in plenty of good things. The Siamites are the sink
of the Easterue Superstitions, which they derive to many Nations.

The inhabitants of this Kingdom are much given to pleasure and riot: they
refuse the use of manual Arts, but addict themselves to Husbandry. They have
Maginus. G.Bot.Ben.
public Schools, where they teach Laws and Religion in the vulgar Language:
other Sciences they learn in a more learned Tongue. They worship innumerable
Idols, but especially the four Elements; according to which his Sect, each man
makes choice of his burial. They which worshipped the Earth, are therein
buried: the Fire burns the dead carcasses of them which observed it: in the
Air are hanged (to feast that ayrie-winged people with their flesh) those
which adored the Air, being alive. The water drowneth those which had alive
been drowned in that Waterie Religion. Every King, at his first entrance to
the Crown, erecteth a Temple, which he adorneth with high Steeples, and
innumerable Idols. In the City of Socotay is one of metal, fourscore
spannes high.

The Kingdom of Siam comprehends that Aurea Chersonesus of Ptolomey,
described by Arrianus in his Periplus, (the Map whereof Ortelius set forth
1597) which Tremellius and Iunius judge to be Salomons Ophir. The Land trendeth
long and narrow, and contains five hundred Leagues of Seacoast, compassing
from Chaupa to Tavay. But of this space the Arabians, or Moors, have usurped
two hundred, with the Towns of Patane, Paam, Ior, and Malacca, now in
possession of the Portugals: and the Kingdoms of Aua, Chencran, Caipumo, and
Brema, have shared also therein. Odia Joan.Bar.l.9.c.2.
is the chief City thereof, containing four hundred thousand households, and
serves the King with fifty thousand soldiers: and to the River Capiumo (on
which it stands) belong two hundred thousand Vessels. This King has nine
Kingdoms subject to him, and thirty thousand Elephants, whereof three
thousand are trained to the wars. His Nobles hold their Lands in a kind of
Knights-Seruice, like the Turkish Timars (yet only for term of life) and
without the Kings pay serve him, whenever he appoints, with twenty
thousand horse, and two hundred and fifty thousand foot. The Country is
compassed with the high Hills of Iangoma, Brema, or Brama, and Aua, and is it
self plain, in situation and fertility (caused by inundation) like to
Egypt. The Lai are tributaries to Siam, for fear of the Gueoni, Caniballa and
Man-eaters living: in the Mountains adjacent; against whom the Siamite
defends them, and invaded those Gueoni one time with twenty thousand horse,
two hundred and fifty thousand footmen, and ten thousand Elephants for
Carriages and War. Caesar Frederike Cas.Frid.
reports, That in the year 1567 the King of Pegu besieged the King of Siam,
in his chief City, with an Army of 1400000 men, and lay before it
21.months, and had 500000 fresh soldiers sent him in supply, and yet had not
prevailed, if Treason had not more furthered his designs then force. The gates
were one night set open, and the Peguans entered: which when the Siamite
perceived, he poisoned himself, leaving his Children and Kingdom a prey to
the Conqueror: whose triumphall return, Frederick (then in Pegu) beheld.
Since that time the Kings of Siam have been tributaries to Pegu.

After this Peguan had reigned seven and thirty years, he left his Kingdoms,
but not his fortunes, to his son: who taking displeasure against the Siamite,
his vassal, sent for him to come to him, which he refused. And thereupon he
entered into his Country with nine hundred thousand men, and besieged him in
his chief City: which he, seeking politic delays, made semblance still to
deliver, until in the third month after (which was March) the River
ouerflowed the Country six score miles about, after his yearly custom, and
partly drowned, partly committed to the Siamites, attending in boats for this
booty, to be slaughtered, that huge Army; of which, scarce threescore and
ten thousand returned to Martavan, and those without Elephants and Horses.
And when the King of Pegu proceeded in his attempts with like success, the
Siamite, at last, besieged him in Pegu, his Royal City, An. 1596. But hearing
a rumor of the Portugals coming to help him, he raised his siege. These are
the reports of Franciscus Fernandes, a Jesuit. Of the Peguan we shall speak
more in the next Chapter.

Malacca is now subject to the Portugals, who have there their Bishop, and a
College of Jesuits besides the Castle. It sometime was subject to Siam, from
whom it rebelled, after that Merchandise had made them rich. The Air is here
very unwholesome: their Speech, a devised Language of the first founders (for it
is not long since it was but a few Fishers Cottages:) their Religion is
Mahumetan, as a great part of the Coast here about is. Maginus calls it the
Center of the Eastern Traffic. They are Linscho^. R.Fitch.
proud of that their Language; wherein they devise many Sonnets and amorous
Poesies. The Malayos, or Country people, go naked, with a Cloth about their
middle, and a little Roll of Cloth about their heads. Lodonico Barthema (who
was there before the Portugals knew it) supposed, that here arrived more
ships then in any City in the world. The River Gaza, near thereunto, is
more, after his reckoning, then fifteen miles over. The people in the Country
(which compasses about two hundred and threescore miles) lodge in Trees, for
fear of Tigers. After that Alphonsus Joan.Bar.l.9.
Albuquerque had conquered Malacca, the Moors, dispossessed there, seated
themselves in diverse places along the Coast, and some of them usurped the
title of Kings.

is a City between Malacca and Siam, chief of that Kingdom, whereto it
gives name, in the height of seven degrees. The buildings are of Wood and
Reed, but artificially wrought. The Mesquit (for many of them are Mahumetanes)

three Languages; the Malayan (which to them is natural) the Sian, and Chinan.
The first is written like the Hebrew, from the right hand; the second, like the
Latin, from the left, and almost in like Characters; the third, from the right
to the left, with a descent from the top to the bottom. The Chinois have
idolatrous Temples, and so have the Sians, wherein are many golden Statues; the
Priests which attend them are clothed in yellow. They have sacred youths which
are their Oracles. The people when they enquire of them, sit a convenient
distance from the Images, and observe the young man's gestures (who with his
hair disheuelled lies prostrate before the Idol) singing and playing on
Instruments, until he arise, and stands up. For then, as possessed of the
Devil, he runs up and down with a terrible countenance, and makes a
stir, as if he would kill himself, and them that stand by, with a sword
which he has in his hand. Then the people prostrating themselves, request him
to declare the Devils Oracle, and he answers as pleases him; his lies being
accounted Oracles. Adultery is here a capital offense, the father of the
malefactor being the Executioner, or his next kinsman, if he be dead: yet is
this vice common (notwithstanding this rigor) by reason of the women's unbridled
lust.

The Kingdom was governed many years by a Queen, who gave good entertainment
to the Hollanders. James Neccy and his fellows, An. 1602. after their double
misfortune and madness, which had befalne them, the one in jest, the other in
earnest; this at Macao in China, where they were, and knew it not, and setting
twenty m^^ on shore The Hollanders saw many men and women of China in their
Boats, which were Fishers, and dwelt in them: but saw not a Portugal, nor
could procure any of the other, at any sum, to deliver them a letter on
shore. After 1603, the Hollanders took a rich ship of the Portugals at
Macao, laden for Iapan. Cornel.de Vena.
, never saw them again, but heard, that the Portugals had caused fifteen of
them to be hanged: the other at Auarella Falca, in 11. degrees. where they
found the Tract of Carts, and footings of Beasts, but could not see a man, nor
shoot a Beast. They guessed, that the people lived as the Tartars, wandering in
Carts and Tents, without any settled dwelling. The place was by them called
Sotternym, by reason that many of their company had lost the use of reason,
and became mad, with eating a certain fruit there growing, like to Plummes,
with a tender stone, which continued till they had slept. Had they known then
the easiness of the cure, it had been better then any Comedy to have tickled
their Spleen, and provoked laughter A merry madness of Every one in his

, to see one fighting against the enemies, which assaulted him at his Cabin:
to hear another with piteous shrikes cry out on the multitude of Devils and
Hobgoblins, which affrighted him: a third sees strange sights, and cries out,
the ship is full of strangers: and whiles one, in more pleasing distraction,
enjoys (and ioyeth in that distracted pleasure) the sight of GOD and his
Angels, another (transported by this humoured Charon) with dreadful and ghastly
looks trembles at his supposed sights of the Devil, and his hellish
associates. It were a madness to relate how exceedingly this their madness
was diuersified, and how many Acts this Tragical Comedy had, till sleep had
dispersed those fumes wherewith that fruit had distracted their brains. From
thence (as is said) they came to Patane, where the Queen entertained them in
good sort, and to their contentment.

As the difference of their writing, in such neerenesse of dwelling, is very
much, so no less is found in their Religions. The Batauians are Mahumetanes.
The Chinois and Siams are Ethnikes, in that diversity of Rites which you have
heard. Whiles the Hollanders were there, one of those youths, in that
Prophetical distraction beforementioned, warned them to depart from thence;
for a great fire would otherwise consume them: whereupon many forsook their
habitation, and yet no fire happened. They also saw the execution of their
severe Law against Adultery, on two noble Personages, whose lewd familiarity
being detected, she chose to be strangled, and he to be stabbed (the Law
permitting them their choice of the kinds of death) which by the fathers of
the parties was executed on them. In single persons it is accounted no crime.
And if a foreine Merchant come to trade there, they use to ask him, if he
need not a woman: yea, many young women offer their service; and the price and
time being agreed on, she, whom he pleases to choose, goes with him to his
house, and in the day performs the office of a Servant, in the night of a
Concubine: but then neither of them may seek change of pleasure, without great
peril.

The Siamites that live here, wear two or three balls of Gold or Silver, as
big as a Tennis-ball, in their yards, as we shall after observe in Pegu. The
Mahumetans wear them not. The Queen keeps her self close at home among her
women; of which, some may not marry (but yet may do worse) others may, having
first obtained the Queens license. It is seldom that she is seen; yet
sometimes she is, when she rides on an Elephant in Progress, for her
recreation. And for Elephants, they have a devise to take them in this sort.
Some ride into the Sea the next Chapter of another way to take them.
Woods on a tame Elephant, and when they epsy a wild one, they provoke him to
fight. Whiles these are fastened in the encounter, by the teeth, or tuskes,
each striving to overthrow the other, some come behind the wild Elephant, and
fasten his hinder feet, and so either kill him for his Teeth, or by famine
tame him.

Since this time ^o.Herinannis^ Hist. Nav.ab 1602. a^.604.
, the Hollanders have had much trading at Patane; and the King of Ior, moved
with their good success against the Portugals, joined his Navy to theirs, to
chase them out of those parts. Yea, they have braued the Portugals, even before

entered into solemn League with the Samaryn, and the Hollanders, against them:
and the next year they won from the Portugals the Castles of Amboyne and

sundry times. In the year 1605, Cornelius Matelivius was sent to the Indies

they had not success answerable to their desire. He that will not only read,

CHAP. III.
Of the Kingdom of Pegu, or Brama.

PEgu G.B^^.Ben.
is the City Royal of the Kingdom Brema, or Brama, the Nation where began
the greatness of the late Kings. These Bramans inhabited near the Lake
Chiamay, among whom the King of Pegu had his Lieutenants or Viceroyes: One
whereof (the Deputy of Tangu) about threescore and ten years since,
rebelled against him, and surprised the Kingdoms of Prom, Mellntay, Calam,
Bacam, Mirandu, Aua, all peopled with the Bramans, trending Northwards a
hundred and fifty Leagues. He after attempted Siam with an Army of three
hundred thousand, and ^ent three months in making way through the huge Woods
and inaccessible Places, but achieved not his purpose. After his return, he
assailed Pegu, and conquered it; and then returned the second time 1567, as in
the former Chapter is mentioned. N. Pime^ta lit. F.Fernandez.
He subjected to his Seignorie twelve Kingdoms, which Fernandes thus
rehearses: The Kingdom of Cavelan, where are the best Rubies and Sapphires:
secondly, that of Aua, the bowels whereof are filled with Mines of Copper,
Lead, and Silver: the third Bacan, enriched with Mines of Gold: Tungran, the
fourth, abounds with Lac Hard Wax.
and Lead: such is Prom, the fifth: The sixth is Iangoma, stored with Copper,
Musk, Pepper, Silk, Silver, Gold: Lauran, the seventh, had Beioim enough to
lade ships: the eight and ninth are the Kingdoms of Trucon, Staples of
China-marchandise: the tenth and eleventh are the Diademes of Cublan, between
Aua and China, poudered with precious stones: Siam, whence we last came, is the
last of the twelve; in the invasion whereof he armed a million and threescore
thousand men (which number is short of Frederick says he had 2 and crowned
kings at command, and that no King in the World was of greater power.
Frederickes reckoning, except we ascribe that surplusage to Victuallers,
Voluntaries, and Servants and Attendants on the baggage:) which Army (says
Fernandes) he tythed out of his people, taking one only of ten. He so
abounded with wealth, that a hundred ships, fraughted with Rice, seemed to
diminish nothing of the plenty. The Fields are said to yield three haruests in
a years and of Gemmes the store is beyond estimation, and almost makes them
there short of the estimation of Gemmes; But this wealth, then wanting no
store, had, when 'Fernandes writ this 1598, a contrane vicissitude, of no
store, but of want, even of those things which Nature exacteth, as necessary
proppes of life. Scarcely of so many millions were left seven thousand persons,
Men, Women, and Children, to participate in the Kings imprisonment or Siege in
his Tower, and those feeding on man's flesh, the parents requiring of the
children that life which before they had given, to sustain their own, and now
laid them not in their bosoms, but in their bowels, the children became
living Sepulchers of their scaree-dead parents. The stronger preyed upon the
weaker: and if their flesh was eaten up before by their own hunger, leaving
nothing but skin and bones to the hungry assault of these raueners, they
ripped the belly, and devoured their inward parts, and breaking the skull,
sucked out the brains raw. Yea, the weaker sex was by the strength of famine
armed with no less butcherly despite against whomsoever they could meet in
the streets of the City; with their knives, which they carried about them, as
harbengers to their teeth, in these inhospitall inhumane-humane banquets.

And thus did the besieged Citizens, while the King endured in his Tower no
small part of like misery, besides the indignity, so to be by his own
vassalls straightened, and after slaughtered. But such is the just hand of the
King of Kings, who regards not persons, but as he shows Mercy to the
merciful, so does he reserve Vengeance for cruelty and Tyranny. Pardon me,
Reader, if on this spectacle I cause thee, with my self, to stay a while and
wonder. The Sun, in his daily journey round about this vast Globe, saw few
equal (that I say no more) to this Peguan greatness, and yet in a small
space, he that is higher then the Highest, has abated and abased this
Magnificence lower then the lowliest of his Princes.

After the death of that Braman Conqueror, his son, in the second month of
his succeeding Reign, hearing that the King of Aua, his tributarie and uncle,
was plotting some conspiracy, he committed to prison forty of his Nobles,
partners in that new Prolect, and bringing them all, with their Parents, Wives,
Children, Friends, and Acquaintance into a Wood, set There were destroyed by
this flame and execution 4000 persons. Arthus page.326. and Caspar Balby, c.37.

present at the execution. He calls the place not-a-Wood, but a Prison. He was

fire thereon, commanding to cut them in pieces, whosoever escaped out of the
flame. This kindled another fire in the hearts of his discontented subjects,
which was not quenched, but with his overthrow. He warred on his uncle, the
King of Aua, with no great advantage, till they both agreeing to try it by
single Combat on Elephants, Pegu obtained the Conquest. In the mean time the
Siamite with an Armle marched to the borders of Pegu, diuulging rumors. That
he came to succor his Lord against the Avan Rebel. The King enraged hereat,
sent presently part of his forces to take him, and present him captive: but the
soldiers refused to follow the General in this Enterprise, and returned to
their own houses. The King, after his return, sent to Siam, by fair speeches
to persuade him to come to him: He refused his presence, but denied not his
wonted Tributes. Hereupon the King, after two years provision for the War,
made that unhappy Expedition in the former Chapter mentioned. And there the
waters taking part with the Siamite, he tried once and again the like fortunes
of war. He sent his brother the King of Iangoina, and his own son twice;
which did much harm to the Si^mites, and received no little themselves; never
returning without loss of half their army, and of his own soune, in the
last invasion slain with a shot. Relentlesse he (inflamed rather with his
losses) determined another Expedition in his own person; and therefore laid up
store of provision in barnes at Martauan, Murmulan, Tauay, and Tanassarin,
three years together, purposing then to employ all the Peguans in this
enterprise. But they weary of foreign calamities, I^^^ piscator sapi^.
hid themselves in woods and wildernesses, and some turned Talopores: so they
call their religious persons. Many sold themselves slaves. The King persisting,
in his person gave order to his uncle Ximibegus, to take a muster of all the
people, and to entertain half of them for the wars. But he missing so many,
which had by those new courses prevented this service, acquainteth the King
therewith; who enioyneth the late professed Talopoyes to resign their habit,
the young men to be compelled to warfare, the old men to be exiled to the
Bramans, where after he caused them to be exchanged for horses. He caused all
the Peguans also to be branded in the right hand, that they might be known.
This made them entertain thoughts of rebellion, which was first practiced by
the Colmians, who set a new King over them.

The Peguan sent an Army against them, with charge to burn or bring away all
they could find among them, which they did, together with many of the people
of both Sexes, which he (after his manner) setting Wood about them burned. And
when the rest (not able to War against their King and famine at once,)
submitted themselves, with The cruel tyranny of the K. of Pegu.
exquisite torments he slew them all. He then sent to his son, the King of
Aua, to transplant those people of every Age and Sex, to people these forlorn
Desolations of Pegu. They, unacquainted with this air, brake forth in
diseases, wherewith they infected also the natural Inhabitants: which plague
made such hauock, that many in impatience cast themselves into the River. The
Murmulans with help of the Siamites seized on their Castle, whom the King
besieged a year together, and then was forced from thence by the Siamites
sudden irruption, with loss of the most of his people: the horses, Elephants,
and country it self remaining their recompense. And the Peguan Captains also,
fearing their Masters tyranny, became subjects to the Siamite, whose whole
families this tyrant with fire and water destroyed, so that all the tract from
Pegu to Martaua and Murmulan was made a Wilderness. These things done, he sent
for his younger son, the King of Pr^m, and commanded him to the siege of
Murmulan: who, utterly mis^^king the attempt, conuaied himself in the night
homewards, with purpose of rebellion.

The King of Siam not ignorant of this Peguan estate, invaded the country in
haruest-time, and therefore that, which they could, they conuayed into barnes,
the rest was fired. He proceeded and laid siege to Pegu: in which at that time
were a hundred and fifty thousand men, and three thousand pieces of ordinance,
a thousand whereof were Brass: but (as is said) for fear of the Portugales,
which were said to have entered into Siam by the way of Camboia he departed,
leaving Famine behind as Lieutenant of his Wars, which caused the
Forrenners, then in Pegu for the defense thereof, to get them to their own
homes. Those few which remained, lived with provision from Tangu. The King sent
to his Deputy in Tangu, to come to him with all the Inhabitants of the Country
and their store, leaving his Wife, and some few to guard the City. He answered
that he would send half, and to demand all were unreasonable. The King sends
four Noble men with Soldiers to force him hereunto. But he slays the
leaders, and seiseth on their followers. Thus the Famine increasing, and the
people eating one another, the King numbreth the Citizens, among whom he
finds seven thousand Siamites, whom he commanded to be slain, not leaving
above thirty thousand of all sorts in the City. His son, the King of Prom,
which had now stood out three years, began to relent and sue for pardon, with
promise to bring the Promans (to the number of fifty thousand) to the City,
whereat his Father reioiced, and sealed his pardon which he sent him with many
gifts. Judas cannot be secure, till he hang himself,
But his chief counselor, author of this rebellion, fearing all the blame
would be laid on him, poisoned the Prince: himself, aspiring to the
Kingdom, was within one week destroyed: and the Nobles, every man seeking to
seize the state to himself, caused that of those fifty thousand, within two
months space, whiles every week they had a new Prince, scarce remained fifty
men fit for War, which departed to Pegu, three or four in a Ship, leaving
their Country to the habitation of wild beasts.

The Natives of Pegu are not quite extinct, but many of them are fled into
other Kingdoms; of whom, and of the Bramans, Iangoma numbreth a hundred and
twenty thousand: Oracan, twenty thousand: Siam, a hundred thousand: and the
King of Iangoma is able (they say) to arm a million of men.

The Talapoyes persuaded the Iangoman to depose his brother of Pegu. He
alleged his oath unto his Father, while he lived. They reply, that no oath
might prohibit, if he placed his brother in a Vahat (or golden Throne) to be
adored for a God. And partly with this (I may not call it) reason: and partly,
as Xerxos alleged for himself, because that his elder brother was borne
before his Father was King, and because his mother was the former King of
Pegu's daughter, he persuaded himself that it was lawful.

And thus was the state of this mighty Kingdom in the year 1598, brought to
one City, which also was now become a withered carcass, and well near the
Sepulcher of it self, and (as mischiefs come not alone) beseeged by Mogus,
King of Orracan.

Andreas A Boues.
Boues (in his Letters the 28. of March, 1600.) thus finisheth this Tragedy.
When the King of Pegu saw himself in such streites, besieged by the Kings of
Orracan, or Arracan, and Tangu, he yielded himself to the King of Tangu: who
dealt treacherously with him, and cut off his head, as he did to the Queen
likewise, and the Prince. He then hasted to the Tower of Pegu, where he found
as much gold and Jewels as laded six hundred Elephants, and as many Horses,
besides silver and other mettalls of smaller price. The King of Arracan then
absent, and angry that the King of Tangu (contrary to promise) had seized all
the treasure to himself, he purposed to invade his kingdom, and to that
intent, had the aid of many Portugales (amongst whom this Jesuit was one) who
saw the ways and fields, lately so fertile, now full strewed with dead men's
bones and Skulles, and in the Rivers all passage of Ships hindered by the
Carcasses of men. The King of Arracan found in the town aforesaid, three
millions of silver, with the Artillery: and then remained Lord of Pegu. Bnt
the Kings of Siam and Iangoma prevented his enterprise for Tangu, which they
invaded to deprive him of his treasures. The King of Siam twice assailed
Martauan with repulse, whereupon, he caused two of his cowardly Captains A
cruel punishment of Cowards.
to be cast into Cauldrons of scaulding Oil: and the third time conquered
that kingdom.

Thus have you heard of the power and subversion of this great Monarchy: so
much the more lamentable, because their fall was from such a height. The
Country is so fertile, that at what time so ever Corn be put into the
ground, the payment is good with increase. I have seen which mine eyes (says
Caesar Frederike) that they have eaten Serpents, Scorpions, all manner of
Herbs and grass. Such fertility, and such stomachs, as they make credible
the reports of their huge Armies, so do they make more terrible the reports of
their desolations. This that I speak of their diet, I understand not of their
extremity and Famine, but ordinarily. Mr. Fitch says the same, that they eat
Roots, Herbs, Leaves, Dogs, Cats, Rats, and Snakes, they refuse almost
nothing.

It is above a hundred years since Vertomannus was there, who in company of a
Persian Merchant went to visit the King, who then had wars in Aua. They went
in a Boat all of one piece of Wood, fifteen or sixteen paces long. The Oars
were Canes, and the Mast was one Cane as big as a Herring-Barrell. The King
wore as many Jewels as were worth a great City, which made him in the night
time to shine as the Sun. He had then a sacrifice to do to the Devil, and
the next day the Persian presented him with rich Coralls, which he took in
so good worth, that he gave him as many Rubies as were vvorth a hundred
thousand ducats.

The King, that lived when Master Fitch 1588. M.R. Fitch. Cas. Fred.
was there, had one Wife, and three hundred Concubines: of whom he was said to
have fourscore and ten Children. He sat in judgment almost every day. They
use no speech in their suits, but give up their Supplications, written in the
Leaves of a Tree with the point of an Iron bigger then a bodkin. These Leaves
are of an Elne long, and two inches broad: they are also double. He which
gives in his Supplication stands a little off, with a present: which, if the
King grants his request, he accepts; if not, he returns with his
present.

Pegu is (or at least in a more unhappy tense, when they were there, was) a
City great, strong, and very fair, with walls of stone, and great ditches
round about it, with many Crocodiles in them. There are two towns; the old,
in which the Merchants abide, and the houses are made of Canes called Bambos:
and the new, for the King and his Nobility. The City is square with fair
walls, having in each square five Gates, besides many Turrets for Sentinels to
watch, made of Wood, and gilded very fair. The streets are straight as a Line
from one Gate to another: and so broad, that ten or twelve men may ride a-front
through them. On both sides at every man's door is set a Coco-tree, yielding a
fair show, and comfortable shadow, that a man might walk in the shade all
day. The Houses are made of Wood, and covered with Tiles. The Kings house is in
the midst, walled and ditched about: and the houses within of wood
sumptuously wrought and gilded. And the house wherein his Pagode or Idol
stands, is covered with Tiles of silver, and all the walls are gilded with
Gold. Within the first Gate of the Kings House was a large room, on both sides
whereof were houses made for the Kings Elephants. Among the rest he had four
white Elephants, a thing rare in Nature, but more precious in his estimation.
For this is part of his Royal Title, The King of the White Elephants. And if
any other has any be will seek by favor or force to have the same, which
(some Linscot^
say) was the cause of the quarrel betwixt him and the King of Siam. Great
service was done unto them. Every one of these white Elephants stood in an
house gilded with Gold, and were fed in vessels of silver gilt. One of them, as
he went every day to the River to be washed, passed under a Canopie of Cloth
of Gold or Silk, carried by six or eight men; as many going before playing on
Drums or other Instruments. At his coming out of the River, a Gentleman
washed his feet in a Silver Basin. There were of black Elephants nine Cubits
high. The King was said to have above five thousand Elephants of War. There
was about a mile from Pegu, a place builded with a fair Court i^ it, to take
wild Elephants in a Grove: which they do by the Female Elephants, trained to
this purpose, and anointed with a certain Oil, which causes the wild
Elephant to follow her. R. Fitch. 28.call. Balbye c. 38.
When the Hunts men have brought the Elephant near to the City, they send
word thereof, and many horsemen and foote-men come out and cause the Female
to take a straight way, which leads to the place where she en^reth, and he
after her^ for it is like a Wood. When they are in, the Gate is shut, and
they get out the Female. The wild one seeing himself alone, weepeth, and
runs against the walls which are made of strong Trees: some of them break
their teeth therewith. Then they prick him with sha^pe Canes, and cause him to
go into a strait house, and there fasten him with a rope, and let him fast
three or four days, and then bring a Female to him, with meat and drink,
within few days taming him. When they go into the Wars, they set a frame of
wood upon their backs (bound with great Cords) wherein sit four or six men,
which fight with Gunnes, Darts, Arrows, and other weapons. All Authors agree,
that no beast comes so near the reason of a man as the Elephant, yea they
seem to go before some men in conceit, haughtiness, desire of glory,
thankefulnes, etc.

The Peguans are beardlesse: and carry pinsers about them to pluck out the
hairs if any grow. They black their Teeth, for they say a Dog has white
teeth. The men of Pegu, Aua, Iangoma and Brama wear balls in their yards,
which they put in the skin being cut, and wear, for every Child one, till
they have three, and may take them out at pleasure: the least is as big as
any Wall-out: the biggest as big as a little Hens Egg. They were invented
to prevent Sodomy, which they use more then any people in the world: Abusing
the Male-Sexe, causes the women also to wear scant clothes, that as they go,
their thigh is seen bare, to provoke men to lust. If the King give any one of
his Balls, it is a great jewel accounted: they heal the place in six or
eight days. The Bramas that are of the kings blood prick some part of their
skin, and put therein a black color, which lasts always. If any Merchants
resort thither, he shall have many Maids (says Lins^^^
Linschoten) offered him by their parents to take his choice, and having agreed
with the parents he may, for the time of his abode, use her as his slave, or
his Concubine, without any discredit to her. Yea, if he come again, after
she is married, he may, for the time he stays there, demand her in like
sort to his use. And when a man marries, he will request some of his
friends to lie the first night with his Bride. There are also among them that
sow up the privy part of their. Daughters, leaving only passage for Urine:
which, when they marry pass under the Surgeons hand for remedy. Caspar Balby,
and Got. Arthus, tell of another custom of their Virgins, if that name may be
given them. For says he, Histor.Indiae Orien.page.313.
Virgins in hoc regno omuino nulla^reperire l^cet: Puellae eni^ emues statim a
pueritia sua medicamentu^ quoddam vsurpant, quo muliebria disten duntur and
apertae continontur: idque propter globul^s quos in virg^^s vir^ gestant: illis
enim admittendis virgins arctiores nullo modo sufficerent. If a man be
bankerupt the Creditor may sell his wife and Children. Their money is called
Ganza, and is made of Copper and Lead, which every man may stamp that will.
Gold and Silver is merchandise and not money. The tides of the Sea between
Martauan and Pegu by Caesar Frederick Cas.Fred.
are reputed the greatest wonder which he saw in his travels: being so violent,
that the air is filled with noise, and the earth quaketh at the approach of
this watery element, shooting the botes that pass therewith as arrows, which
at a high water they suffer not to anchor in the Channel, which would betray
them to the devouring jaws of the returning tide, but draw them toward some
bank, where they rest in the ebb on dry land, as high from the Channels
bottom as any house top. And if they arrive not at their certain Stations,
they must back again whence they came, no place else being able to secure
them. And when it increases again, it gives them three calls or salutations:
the first wave washes over the bark from Stem to stern: the second, is not
so furious: the third, raises the Anchor. In Negrais in Pegu R.Fitch.
diverse people dwell in boats which they call Paroes; the country being full
of Rivers, in which they go too and fro with their Families: as strange is the
dwelling here on the land; their houses being set on high Posts, and their
going up on Ladders for fear of Tigers. From hence to Pegu, is ten days
journey by the Rivers, in which way is Cosmon and Medon, where their markets
(are as their dwellings) upon the water in Boats, with a great Sombrero, like
a Cart-wheele, to keep off the Sun, made of Coco-Leaues.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the Religion in Pegu, and the Country thereunto subject.

THeir Varellaes or Idoll-Temples in the Kingdom of Pegu are many. R.Fitch.
Cas.Fred^rike.
They are made round like a Sugar-Loafe or a Bell: some are as high as a Church
or a reasonable Steeple, very broad beneath: some a quarter of a mile in
compass: In the making of them, they consume many Sugarcanes with which they
cover them from the top to the bottom. Within, they be all earth, done about
with stone. They spend thereon much Gold, for they be all gilded aloft, and
many of them from the top to the bottom: and every ten or twelve years, they
must be new gilded, because the rain consumes off the Gold, for they stand
open abroad. Were it not for this vain custom, Gold would here be
good-cheape. About two days journey from Pegu, there is a Varelle, Cas.Balby
says that many of these Vareles were burned, together with four thousand
housand houses in Pegu by negligence of a Portugal Mariner.
or Pagode, which is the Pilgrimage of the Pegues. It is called Dogonne, and is
of wonderful bigness, and all gilded from the foot to the top. This house is
fifty five paces in length, and has in it three Isles or Walks, and forty
great Pillars gilded, which stand between them. It is gilded with gold within
and without. There are houses very fair round about for the Pilgrims to lie
in: and many goodly houses for the Tallipoies to preach in, which are full of
images both of men and women all over gilded; I suppose it the fairest place in
the world. It stands very high, and there are four ways to it, which all
along are set with Trees of Fruits in such wise, that a man may go in the
shade above two miles in length. And when their Feast Day is, a man can hardly
pass by water or by Land for the great prease of people, which resort thither
from all places of the kingdom. There are on the shore of Dogon two Statues,
which from the head downward represent yongmen, but have the faces of Devils,
and two wings on their backs. In Pegu there is a Varelle or Temple, like to
this, which the King frequented to do his holies therein, mounting up Stairs
at the foot whereof were two Tigres gaping wide, seeming as if they had been
alive. Besides the many Magazins (or Treasuries full of Treasure) which the
late Bramen King had, he had near unto the palace a Court walled with stone,
the gates whereof were open every day. Within this Court are four gilded
houses covered with Lead: and in every of them certain Idols of great value.
In the first house was a great Statue of Gold, and on his head a crown of
Gold; beset with rare Rubies, and Sapphires, and about him four little
children of Gold. In the second house is another of Silver, as high as an
house, set as it were sitting on heaps of money, crowned, his foot is as long
as a man. In the third house there is the like Idol of brass, and in the
fourth, of Ganza, (which is their money metal, tempred of Lead and Copper)
In another Court not far from this, stand four other Colosses, or huge
images of Copper, in houses gilded fair, as they are themselves, save the
head. Balby Balby c.38.
tells of five made of Ganza, so monstrous, that the toes of their feet were as
big as a man, and fitting crosse-legged were yet as high as one could hurl a
stone, and were all gilded. Fernandes Fernandes Epist.
relates of threescore and seven Images of Gold, richly adorned with Jewels,
and three hundred threescore and six Combalengas or Gourds of Gold, molten by
the Kings Father, each weighing a hundred and fourscore pound; besides his
other treasures; to conceal which he slew two hundred Eunuchs his attendants.

Their Tallipoies, R. Frith.
before they take orders, go to school, till they be twenty years old or
more: then they come before a Tallipoie, appointed for that purpose, whom they
call Rowli. He (as chief and most learned) examineth them many times, whether
they will leave their friends, and the company of all women, and take upon them
the habit of a Talipoy. If he be content, then he rides upon an horse about
the streets, very richly apparelled, with Drums and pipes to show that he
leaves the riches of the world to be a Tallipoie. In few days after, he is
carried upon a thing like an horslitter, which they call a Serion upon ten or
twelve men's shoulders, in apparel of a Tallipoy, with Pipes and Drums and
many Tallipoies with him and all his friends: which accompany him to his house,
standing without the town, and there leave him. Every one of them has his
house which is very little) set upon six or eight posts, to which they ascend
on a Ladder of twelve or fourteen steps. These houses are commonly by the
highways side, and among the Trees, and in the Woods. They go stangely
apparelled with one Camboline or thin cloth next to their body, of a brown
color; another, of yellow, doubled many times upon their shoulders. These two
be girded to them with a broad girdle: and they have a skin of Leather
hanging on a string about their necks, whereon they sit bare-headed, and
barefooted, with their right arms bare, and a broad Sombrero or shadow in
their hands to defend them in Summer, from the Sun, and in Winter, from the
Rain.

They go with a great pot made of wood or fine Earth, and conered, tied with a
broad girdle upon their shoulder, which comes under their arm: wherewith
they go to beg their victuals which they eat, which is Rice, Fish, and
Herbs. They demand nothing, but come to the door, and the people presently
do give them one thing or other: they put altogether in their pot. They keep
their Feasts by the Moon: and at a new Moon is their most solemn Feast: and
then the people send Rice and other things to that Kiack or Church, of which
they be: and there all the Tallipoies of that Church meet and eat that which
is sent them. They preach against all abuses, and many resort unto them. When
they enter into their Kiack at the door there is a great jar of water, with
a Cock or a Ladle in it, and there they wash their feet, and then enter in,
lifting up their hands to their heads, first to their Preacher, and then to the
Sun, and so sit down. When the Tallipoies preach, many of the people carry
them gifts into the pulpit, where they sit and preach. And there is one which
sits by them to take that which the people bring, which is divided among
them. They have none other ceremonies nor service that I could see but only
preaching.

Boterus G.B.B.l.part 3 Arthus page 319.
says, that they hold an innumerable multitude of worlds successively one
after another, and also innumerable number of Gods: but not all at once. They
imagine that five have governed this present world, whereof four are passed
above two hundred years ago. Now they are without a God, and expect the fifth
many ages hereafter: after whose death, they conceive that the world shall
perish by fire, and then another world shall follow, and other Gods to rule it.
They reckon likewise in the number of their Gods certain men, which yet have
first passed into fishes, beasts, and birds of all sorts. After death they
believe three places, one of pleasure; (like the Mahumetane Paradise) another
of torment; the third, of annihilation, which they call Niba. The souls after
their fantasy abide in the two former places, whence they return so often
into this life till at last they be holden worthy that Niba. He adds, that
they have Couents, or Colleges of Priests, which live three hundred together,
or more in one place, have no use of women, are harbourers of strangers, and
live some of alms, some of rents. They have like Nunries also for the women.
There is supposed to be in one Idol-sanctuarie (whereof they have many) 120000.
Idols. They fast thirty days in the year: in which they eat nothing till
night. They are of opinion, that he which in this world robs another man
shall in the next world be his servant for recompense. They hold it a sin
also to kill a living creature, although this be not strictly observed amongst
them. Some Jews are of opinion that this people descended of those Israelites
which Solomon sent to Ophir, which they place in this Kingdom. Part 1.l.2.
But the Peguans themselves ascribe their original to a dog, and a
China-woman, which escaped shipwreck.

The Devil is highly worshipped of these Pegusians, Caspar. Balby. Got.
Arthus. histor. Indiae. Page 321.
to whom they erect a stately Altar, and adorn it with variety of flowers,
and meats of all sorts, so to see and feed him that he should not hurt them.
This is principally done when they are sick: for then they make vows, and
build Altars, which they cover with clothes and flowers. They entertain him
also with diversity of music, and appoint him a Priest whom they call the
Devils Father, which procures his rites and music. Some, as soon as they
arise from their beds, bring a basket of rice, and meats, and a burning Torch
in their hands, running up and down in the streets, openly professing to feed
the devil to prevent harm from them that day. And if dogs follow them, they
hold them to be sent of the Devil to devour those meats in his name. Some
will not eat, till they have first cast something behind their backs to the
Devil. And in the country-villages some of the richer inhabitants leave their
houses furnished with store of food three months space to be inhabited of
him, keeping mean while in the fields: that so the other nine months they
may be out of his danger. And howsoever the Talopois preach against this
devilish devotion, yet they cannot reclaim the people. The Talipoies every
Monday, arise early, and by the ringing of a Basin call together the people to
their Sermons, which are of Justice to man, but nothing of Religion to God.
They wash themselves often, C. Balby C, 39.
and the water, wherewith they are washed, the people account holy, and reserve
it for their drink.

They have many feasts very solemnly observed. Sapan. Giachie
One Feast (called Sapan Giachie) is kept twelve leagues from the City:
whither the King rides in a triumphall Chariot, with his Queen in exceeding
pomp, his Nobles attending. Another Sapan Catena.
is kept in Pegu, against which day all the Courtiers provide them certain
pillars or Images of diverse forms, kept closely, that none may see what others
have provided, till the day. These are made of Indian Reeds, carved and
gilded, and on the feastinall presented to the King, who praises the most
artificial of them. All that night huge lights of wax are burnt in honor of
their Idol, whose Feast it is, that all may see to have access to him, to
which end the Citie-Gates are left open. But none may approach unto him
empty-handed. They have Sapan Daiche
a Feast of watering celebrated in the old City, where the King, Queen, and
his Children, with Rose Water sprinkle one another. And all the Captains
likewise besprinkle each other, that they seem as wet as if they came out of a
River. It is said of the last Kings father, that when the people were thus
washing, he would send amongst them an Elephant, which slew many of them,
whereat he laughed; the people lamented. An other feast Sapan Dunan.
they have, wherein they have a trial of their ships, which can sail best:
this feast lasts a month: A fifth feast Sapan Giaimoseg^enon.
is called Gia^^noseg^enon, in honor of a certain Idol; they have many other
feasts, but these the most solemn. Antony Correa, a Portugal, concluding a
league with the King of Pegu, the Kings Deputy caused the articles of accord,
written in Portugal and Pegu languages with golden letters, to be read aloude,
and then rent the scrole, and with a few leaves of an odoriferous tree, caused
the same to be burned to ashes, upon which he laid both hands of the Priest,
who in the name of the King, swear to those Articles. These things being done
with great attention and silence, Correa. loath in a superstitious fancy, to
defile Holle Writ, with confirmation of an oath to a Gentile, swear on a Book
of amorous Sonnets, to keep inviolable the said Articles.

In the year of our Lord 1585. the King of Aua rebelling, (as is before
showed) the King of Pegu, by single combat, slew the traitor. The fight was on
Elephants, in which the Pegusians Elephant, and the Auan Prince, died. The
living Elephant was preferred to the place of the former; but in fifteen days
space (let the beastliness of men imitate the humanity of a beast) he sorrowed
so Caspar Balby was there with other Merchants, which saw him weeping.
for his Master, that nothing might comfort him. And although he had
continually two servants attending him, and telling him of his amended estate
under a mightier master, yet would he scarce cease to weep, or begin to
eat, till his fifteen days exequies were finished.

Bomferrus a Franciscan spent three years in learning the Pegu's language, and
mysteries, that he might preach the Christian Religion amongst them, but was
soon forced to give over and return into India. For they could not endure to
hear any better knowledge then they had.

Crocodiles and Ap^s C. Balby.
are accounted holy and sacred creatures, for which cause Apes multiply
exceedingly; none taking them, except for the use of their Varelles or Temples,
where they tie them, and keep them with diligent respect. And though the
Crocodiles in the Towne-ditch devour men daily, yet in a blind zeal they
will drink no other water, and account their souls certainly saved, whose
bodies are thus certainly lost and devoured of those beasts, which sometimes
are thirty foot in length.

The Kings, subject to the King of Pegu, did their homage, and presented
themselves before him, kneeling, yea they not only kneeled to him, but to his
white Elephants also. When the King dies, they make two ships with golden
couers, and betwixt them erect a golden Theater; in which they place the
corpse, applying thereto musk, and the most sweet woods, with other things:
and so set forth the same to Sea, setting that Theater or Pagcant on fire. In
one of the ships are Talapoies, which sing till they think the body consumed
to ashes. Then do they make a mass or lump of these ashes and milk, and
commit the same to Sea in the haven of Sirian at an ebbing water: the bones
which remain they carry to an other place, and there erecting a Chapel, do
bury the same therein. After this they return to the palace, and, according
to the accustomed rites, inaugurate the new King. The father of that King
(whose tragedy ye have heard) had his bones buried in Dogon.

In Dagin or Dacin, as certain Merchants at Martaban told our Author Balby
ca.42.,
That if the King be in love with a maid, he asks her fathers consent, which
yet few will grant, because he is still tied to maintain his daughter; the
King allowing no expenses to his wife. In some places of that kingdom are
men-eaters, called Batacchi, which when their parents grow old, kill them, and
eat them as great dainties. When the King has condemned a man for some crime,
these are his executioners, who in the presence of the king cut off his head,
hands and feet, and adding pepper and salt, eat his flesh raw. He is called
the king of Assi, and is of great power, has many ships, much pepper, and is a
sworn enemy to the Portugalls, working all the evil he can to Malacca. If the
father knows the son to be guilty (or the son the father) of some
grievous crime, he may slay him, but must after give account to the king; and
if he allow the fact, all is will; otherwise he is liable to punishment.

In Iamahey or Iangoma (five and twenty days journey from Pegu) when the
people be sick, they make a vow, to offer meat unto the devil, if they
escape: and when they be recovered, they make a banquet, with many pipes, and
drums, and many other Instruments, and dancing all the night. Their friends
bring them presents, Cocos, figs, Arrecaes, and other fruits; and with great
dancing and rejoicing, they offer to the devil, and say, they give the devil
to eat, and drive him out, and to this end in their dancing they cry and
hollow very loud. Likewise, when they be sick, a Tallipoy or two, every night
does sit by them, and sing, to please the devil, that he should not hurt them.
When one is dead, he is carried upon a great frame, made like a Tower, with a
covering all gilded, made of canes, carried by fourteen or sixteen men, with
great minstrel sie to a place out of the Town, and there is burned. He is
accompanied with all his friends and neighbors, all men: and they give to the
Tallipoies, or Priests, many mattes and cloth: and then return to the house,
where they feast it two days: which being expired, the women accompany the
wife to the place where he was burned, and there spend a while in mourning:
then do they gather the pieces of bones, which be left unburned, and bury
them, and then return to their houses. The near of kindred do also shave
their heads, both men and women.

THe kingdom of Bengala M^gin. Gin. Bet. Ben. Got. Arthus hist. ^^d Orient.

is very large, and has of coast one and twenty leagues, and as much within
land. The river Chaberis (which some call Guenga, and think to be the ancient
Ganges) waters it: It is plentiful in rice, wheat, sugar, ginger, long
pepper, cotton and silk: and enjoys a very wholesome air. The inhabitants
near the shore, are (for the most part) Mahumetans, and so also was the king,
before the great Mogore (one likewise of his own Sect) conquered him. Gouro
the seat royal, and Bengala are fair cities. Of this the Gulf, sometimes
called Gangeticus, now bears name Golfo di Bengala. Chatigan is also reckoned
amongst their Cities. They Linschot. ca. 16.
are a most subtle and wicked people, and are esteemed the worst slaves of all
India: for that they are all thieves; and the women, whoores; although this
fault is common through all India, no place excepted. They have a custom,
never to dress or sees meat twice in one pot, but have every time a new one.
Whenever they are found in adultery, they have their Adultery punished.
noses cut off, and are thence forwards narrowly looked to, that they keep not
each others company. The Portugalles have here Porto grande, and Porto Pequino,
but without forts and government; every man living after his own lust: and
for the most part, they are such as dare not stay in their places of better
government, for some wickedness by them committed.

In Bengala are found great numbers of Abadas or Rhinocerotes, whose horn
(growing out of his snowt) teeth, flesh, blood, claws, and whatsoever he has
without and within his body, is good against poison, and is much accounted of
throughout all India. The skin Linschot. c. 47
upon the upper part of this beast, is all wrinckled, as if he were armed with
shields. It is a great enemy of the Elephant. Some think that this is the
right Unicorn, because as yet there is no other by late travelers found, but
only by hearsay. Only Ludonicus Vertomannus Lud. Vert.lib.1.ca.19.
says he saw a couple of those true Unicorns at Mecca; one whereof had a
horse of three cubits, being of the bigness of a colt of two years and a half
old; the other was much less: both sent to the Sultan of Mecca, for a rare
present out of Aethiopia. Gesner in his Book of Foure-footed Beasts, Gesner
^^s de Quadrup.
cites this testimony, and some others, whereby he persuades, that there are
diverse sorts of these Unicorns: But it cannot seem otherwise then strange,
that in this last hundred of years. Wherein the world has vnveiled her face
more then ever before; none of credit (that I have read) has affirmed
himself to have seen this Unicorn, but in picture. That which is reported of
their virtue against poison, proceeds from the herbs which Bengala
yields: for in other places they are not here the price of these. There are
here also certain wild Goats, whose horns are in account against venom: as
I my self (says Linschoten) have proved.

The kings Gi Bot. Ben.
of Bengala, in times past, were chosen of the Abassine or Ethiopian slaves,
as the Soldans of Cairo were sometime of the Circassian Mamalukes. Northwards
of Bengala lies the kingdom of Arracan. The great Can subdued these parts and
the kingdom of Mien, about the year 1272, while M^^cus Paulus lived there.
Arracam, Chandican, and Syripur are by Fernandez placed in Bengala, as so many
kingdoms: Patane or Patenau by Frederike and Fitch reckoned to an other
Bengalan kingdom: which our Countreyman Master Fitch calls the kingdom of
Gouren: so that under this name Bengala are comprehended many Seigniories; all,
or the most part now subject to the Mogor.

Our Mappes seem not to describe the river Ganges (so will we here term it
with Ortellius, Castaldus, Barrius, and all our later Travelers, both
Merchants and Jesuits) according to the due course thereof. For Chaberis they
bring from the North enclining to the East, Guenga from the West; but Master
Fitch, which continued five months in passing down first in Iamena from Agra,
which falls into Ganges, and then in Ganges it self to Bengala (although he
confesses it may be done in shorter time) says it comes from the
North-west, and runs East into the Sea. Some call Chaberis, Ganges; and some
hold Guenga to be Ganges; and some make but one river of them both: and hence
may happly arise in part, that seeking of Ganges so far off.

There is in Ganges Balby ca. 4^.
a place called Gongasagie, that is, the entry of the Sea, in which are many
fishes called Sea-dogges. They which are weary of this world, and desire to
have a quick passage to Paradise, cast in themselves here to be devoured of
these fishes; persuading themselves, that the next and readiest way thither, is
by their jaws.

Ganges R. Fitch.
ouerflowing his banks, in times past drowned many villages, which so remain;
and has changed his wonted Channel: the cause that Tanda (a City of
traffic) stands now a league from the river. It waters a fruitful
Country and populous, and (as the Oceans high Collector) receives into him
many rivers by the way, some no lesle then it self, so that in the time of
rain, you can not see from the one side of Ganges to the other. The
superstitious opinion conceived, in those parts, of this river, appears by
the reports of all. Hier. ^^^ Eman. Pin.
Emanuel Pinner at Cambaia observed many to resort thither on pilgrimage,
sometime out of that City four thousand; and was told by the Governor of
Bengala under the Mogor then at Lahor, that there came thither sometime three
hundred thousand or four hundred thousand Pilgrims. And adds, That not long
before his coming to Cambaia there assembled there, to this devout journey,
fifty thousand people. Happy they esteem that man which washes himself
therein, and secure of salvation, if at the point of death he may drink of
this water. Pardaw is three testons Portugale.
He conferred with one Gedacham, a great man, which had been on this holy
voyage, and had there weighed his mother three times; first, by her weight in
silver; secondly, in gold; thirdly, in pearls, all which he gave unto the
poor. M. Pimenta.
A brother of his, called Ra^, being to go to the great Mogore, offered one
hundred and fifty thousand Pardawos that his Pagodes or Idols should send him
good success. They make an Image also to this river, whereunto they do divine
honor. The king of Calecut and the other kings of Malabar keep a solemn feast
every twelve years, in honor of this river; because that long since a
certain Bramene (falsely accused) fled unto Ganges, and there led an austere
life twelve years; worshipping that Stream and his Idol, to whom when he
purposed to return home, after those twelve years expired, that Image of
Ganges appeared, and said, that on the last day of February he would appear
in a river of his own Country, and cause the waters thereof to arise, and
run backward in witness of his innocence, and bade him assemble all the
Lords of Malabar to the sight, which accordingly came to pass, and the memory
thereof is by this Feast solemnized.

Bannaras R. Fitch.
is a great Town on Ganges, to which the Gentiles out of far countries come
on pilgrimage. The men are shaven all but the crown. Along the waterside
are many fair houses, in which stand Images of evil favor, made of stone,
and wood, like leopards, lions, monkeis, men, women, peacockes, and devils,
with four arms and hands, sitting close-legged, and holding somewhat in their
hands. There are diverse old men, which on places of earth, made for the
purpose, sit praying, and they glue the people (which by break of day, and
before, come out of the town, to wash themselves in Ganges) three or four
strawes, which they take, and hold them between their fingers where they wash
themselves: and some sit to mark them in the foreheads, and they have in a
cloth a little rice, barley, or money, which they give to these old men. After
that, they go to diverse of their images, and give them of their sacrifices,
those old men in the mean while praying, which makes all holy. They have one
idol called Ada, with four hands and claws. On certain great carved stones
also they pour water, rice, wheat etc. They have a great place like a well,
with steps to go down, wherein the water stands foul, and stinketh by
reason of those many flowers, which they continually throw thereinto. Many
people are always therein with imagination of pardon for their sins, because
God (as they blaspheme) washed himself therein. They gather up the sand in the
botome, as a holy relike. They pray not but in the water, and wash themselves
over head, lading up water with both their hands, and turn themselves about,
and then drink a little of the water three times, after which they go to
their Gods in their houses. Some of them will wash a place which is their
length, and then will pray upon the earth, with their arms and legs at length
out, and will rise up and lie down, and kiss the ground twenty or thirty
times, but will not stir their right foot. Some use fifteen or sixteen
pots, little and great, ringing a bell while they make their mixtures ten or
twelve times; and make a circle of water about their pots, and pray: others
sitting by, one of which reaches them their pots. They say over these pots
diverse things many times, which done, they go to their gods and strew their
sacrifices, which they think are very holy, and mark many of them which sit
by in the foreheads, esteemed as a great gift. There come fifty, and sometime
a hundred together, to this Well, and to these Idols.

About their Idols in some houses sits one in warm weather to blow the
wind with a fan upon them. And when they see any company coming, they ring a
little bell, and many give them their alms. None of these idolles have a good
face. Some are black, and have claws of brass; and some ride on peacockes or
other fowls. One there is always attended with his fan, to make wind, which
(they say) gives them all things, both food and raiment. Here some be burned
to ashes, some scorched in the fire, and thrown into the water, when they are
dead: the Foxes presently eat them. The wives do burn with their husbands
when they die: if they will not, their heads be shaven, and never any account
is made of them after. If a man or woman be sick, and like to die, they will
lay him before their idolles all night: and that shall mend or end him. And if
he do not mend, that night his friends will come and fit a little with him, and
cry, and after will carry him to the waters side, and set him upon a little
raft made of reeds, and so let him go down the river. The chief idols are
very euill-fauoured, their mouths monstrous, their ears gilded, and full of
jewelles, their teeth and eyes of gold, silver, glass, colored black, with
Lamps continually burning before them. Into their houses or Temples you may
not enter, with your shoes on. When the scorched Indians are thrown into
Ganges, the men swim with their faces downwards, the women with their faces
upwards; which I had thought they had by some means caused, but they denied
it. The people go all naked, with a little cloth about their middle. Their
women are exceedingly on their necks, arms, and ears, decked with rings of
silver, copper, tin, and iuory hoopes; they are marked with a great spot of red
in their foreheads, and a stroke of red up to the crown, and so it runs
three ways. Their marriages are in this sort: The manner of their marriages.
The man and the woman come to the water side, where stands a Bramane or
Priest, with a Cow and a Calfe, or a Cow with Calfe: These all go into the
water together, the Bramane holding a white cloth of four yards long, and a
basket cross bound with diverse things in it. This cloth he lays upon the
back of the Cow. And then he takes the Cow by the tail and says certain
words. She has a copper or a brass pot-ful-of water. The man holds his hand
by the Bramans hand, and the wives hand by her husbands, and all have the Cow
by the tail. Then they pour water out of the pot upon the Cowes tail, which
runs through all their hands, and they lade up water with their hands, and
then the Bramane tieth their clothes together. After this they go round about
the Cow and Calfe, and give somewhat to the poor there attending, leaving the
Cow and Calfe for the Bramans use, and offer to diverse of their Idols money,
then lying down upon the ground, they kiss it diverse times, and go their
way. Between this and Patenaw are diverse thieves, like the Arabians, without
certain abode.

Patenaw was sometime a kingdom, now subject to the Mogore. The women here are
so decked with silver and copper, that it is strange to see, and by reason of
such rings upon their toes, they can wear no shoes. Here I saw a dissembling
Prophet which sat upon an horse in the marketplace, and made as though he
slept, and many of the people came and touched his feet with their hands, and
then kissed their hands. They took him for a great man, but I saw he was a
lazy lubber: and there I left him sleeping. The people here are great praters
and dissemblers. As I came from Agra down the river Iemena, I saw also many
naked beggets, of which the people make great account; they call them Schesche.
Here I saw one, which was a monster among the rest, wearing nothing on him,
with a long beard, the hair of his head covering his priuities. The nails of
some of his fingers were two inches long: for he would cut nothing from him A
right niggard..
Neither would he speak, but was accompanied with eight or ten which spoke for
him. When any man spoke to him, he would lay his hand upon his breast, and bow
himself, but speak he would not to the King.

In those parts they had many strange ceremonies. Their Bramans or Priests come
to the water, and have a string about their necks made with great ceremonies,
and lade up water with both their hands, and turn the string first with their
arms within, and then one arm after the other out. Here also about Iemena,
the Gentiles will eat no flesh, nor kill any thing. They pray in the water
naked, and dress their meat and eat it naked: and for their penance they lie
flat upon the earth, and rise up and turn themselves about thirty or forty
times, and use to heave up their hands to the Sun, and to kiss the earth,
with their arms and legs stretched out along, their right leg being always
before the left. Every time they lie down, they score it with their fingers,
to know when their stint is ended. The Bramanes mark themselves in the
foreheads, cares, and throats, with a kind of yellow gear which they grind;
every morning they do it. And they have some old men which go in the streets
with a box of yellow powlder, and mark them which they meet on their heads and
necks. And their wives do come, ten, twenty and thirty together to the water
side, singing, and there do wash themselves, and use their ceremonies, and
mark themselves on the foreheads and faces, and carry some with them, and so
depart singing. Their daughters be married, at, or before the age of ten
years. The men may have seven wives. They are a crafty people, worse then the
Jews.

I went R. Fitch.
from Bengala into the Country of Couche, which lies five and twenty days
journey North-wards from Tanda. The King was a Gentile, named Suckel Counse:
his Country is great, and lies not far from Cauchin-China. All the Country
is set with canes made sharp at both ends, and driven into the earth; and they
can let in the water, and drown the Country knee-deepe. In time of war they
poison all the waters. The people have ears which be marvelous great, of a
span long, which they draw out in length by devises when they be young. They
are all Gentiles, and will kill nothing, They have Hospitalls for sheep, dogs,
goats, cats, birds, and all other living creatures. When they be old and lame,
they keep them till they die. If a man catch or buy any quick thing in other
places, and bring it thither, they will give him money for it, or other
victualles, and keep it in their Hospitalles, or let it go. They will give
meat to the Antes. Their small money is Almonds, which oftentimes they eat. We
passed through the Country of Gouren, where we found but few villages, and
almost all wilderness, and saw many buffes, swine, and deete: grass longer
then a man, and very many Tigers. Satagam is a fair City, for a city of
Moors, and very plentiful. In Bengala such is the estimation of Ganges, that
they will fetch of it a great way off, though they have good water near: and
if they have not sufficient to drink, they will sprinkle a little on them, and
then they are well. From Satagam I traveled by the Country of the King of
Tippaia, with whom the Mogore has continual war. The Mogores, which be of
the kingdom of Recon and Rame, be stronger then this King of Tippaia. Four
days journey from Couche is Botanter, and the city Bettia: the King is called
Dermaine the people are tall and strong: the Country great, three months
journey, and has in i^ high mountains, one of which a man may see, six days
journey off: Upon these mountains are people with ears of a span long;
otherwise they account them Apes. Hither resort many merchants out of China and
Tartaria. From Charigan in Bengala I went to Bacola, the king whereof is a
Gentile; thence to Senepare, and after, to Simergan, where they will eat no
flesh, nor kill no beast; and thence to Negrais in Pegu and Cosmin. Thus far
has our Countryman led us in the view of so many superstitions of these
Bengalans: and their Northerly neighbors.

The Bengalans Linschot.
have a tradition or fable amongst them, That this river comes out of
Paradise, which was proved by one of their kings, who sent men up the stream
till they came to a pleasant air, still water, and fragrant earth, and could
row no further. Hence happly grew this conceit, That this water should wash
away sin, and that without it they cannot be saved. This river has in it
Crocodiles, which by water are no less dangerous then the Tigers by land, and
both will assault men in their ships. There is also a little small beast,
which by his barking makes the Tiger to run away.

The king of Chandecan N. Pimenta.
caused a Jesuit to rehea^se the Decalogue: who when he reproved those Indians
for their polytheisme, worshipping so many Pagodes; He said, that they observed
them but as, among them, their Saints were worshipped: to whom how sauoury the
Jesuits distinction of ^^^ and ^^^ was for his satisfaction, I leave to the
Readers judgment. This king, and the others of Bacala and Arracan have
admitted the Jesuits into their Countries, and most of these Indian Nations.

In that part of Botanter, which is next to Lahor and the Mogor, the people
Hi^er relatio de reg^ Mogor.
are white, and Gentiles. Their garments are close girt to them, that a
wrinckle or pleit is not to be seen, which they never put off, no not when
they sleep, as long as they are able to hang on: their head-attire is like a
sugar loaf, sharp at the top. They never wash their hands, left, say they,
so pure a creature should be defiled. They have but one wife; and when they
have two or three children, they live as brother and sister. Widowers and
widows may not marry a second time. They have no Idolles nor towns, nor king,
in those parts of Bottanter. They have their Soothsayers, which they ask
counsel of. When any is dead, they resort unto these Wisards, to know what is
to be done with their dead. They search their Books; and as they say the word,
they burn them, or bury them, or eat them, although they usually feed not on
man's flesh. They also use dead men's skulls instead of dishes, as in Thebet we
have observed the like custom. They are liberal Almes-giuers.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Great Mogor.

THe Great Mogor (according to Boterus) has under his subjection seven and
forty Kingdoms, which lie between Indus and Ganges on the East and West, and
betwixt Imaus and the Ocean. He is called of the people the Great Mogor, for
the same cause that the Ottoman-Turkes are called Great. The style of him that
was King 1595, and 1599.
when the Jesuits imparted to us these relations, was Mahumeth Zelabdi^
E^hebar, King Mogor. His descent is from Tamerlan (worthily called Great) from
whom he is reckoned the eight. His father was Emmanpa^da (as the Jesuits
report) which being driven to great straits by the Parthians, or Tartars, was
driven to ask aid of the Sophi. or Persian King; which he obtained, with
condition of submitting himself to the Persian Religion. The Mogores speak
the Turkish Language. The Empire of this Mogore is exceeding great, containing
the Countries of Bengala, Cambaia, Mendao, and others, comprehended by some
under the name of Industan. This Mendao is said to be ten Leagues in circuit,
and that it cost the Mogor twelve years siege. Agra and Fatipore are two
Cities in his dominion, great, and full of people, much exceeding London; and
the ^hole space between is as a continual populous Market. Many Kings he has
conquered, and many have submitted themselves and their States voluntarily to
his subjection. Twenty Gentile Kings are numbered Relat.de Reg. Mog.
in his Court, which attend him, equalling the King of Calecut in power. Many
others pay him tribute. Eleven great Rivers run through his dominions; Taphi,
Har^ada, Chambel, Iamena, Ganges: The other six are Indus, or Sch^^d (as they
call it) and Catamul, Cebcha, Ray, Chenao, Reb^th, tributaries to Indus. The
whole Monarchy enuironeth nine hundred Leagues. King Echebar Of the great
Mogor his puissance, riches, and other qualities Pierre du larric has largely
written l.4. de histoire des Indes Or.c.8
has many Lords, each of which is to maintain eight, ten, twelve, or
fourteen thousand horse in readiness for the war, besides Elephants, of
which in the whole Kingdom are said to be fifty thousand. Himself can
further bring of his own into the Field fifty thousand horse, and footmen
innumerable. To those Lords he allows certain Provinces for such military
service: for he is Lord of all, nor has any else possession of any thing, but
at the will of the King. Once a year they appear before the King, where they
present a view of those their enjoined forces. Many millions of revenue do
besides accrue unto his coffers: yet his Port and Magnificence is not so great,
as of many other Princes, either for Apparel, Diet, or the Majesty of his
Court-seruice. He cannot write or read, but hears often the disputations of
others, and Histories read before him, being of deep judgment, piercing wit,
and wise forecast. In execution of Justice he is very disigent, insomuch,
that in the City where he resideth he hears all causes himself, neither is
any malefactor punished without his knowledge, himself giving public audience
ten times every day: for which purpose he has two wide Halls, and in them
Royal Thrones, where he is attended with eight Counselors, besides Notaries.

This King detesteth the Mahumetane Sect, which, as you heard, his father
embraced for his advantage; and therefore has overthrown their Moschees in
his Kingdom, converting them to Stables, and more trusts and employeth the
Gentiles in his affairs then the Moors: whereupon many of them rebelled
against him, and stirred up the Prince of Quabul, his brother, to take Arms:
against whom Echebar opposed himself, and caused him to retire into his own
Country. It is uncertain The uncertainty of his Religion.
what Religion he is of, some affirming him to be a Moore, some a Gentile, some
a Christian; some of a fourth Sect, and of none of the former. Indeed it
appears that he wauereth, uncertain which way of many to take, able to see
the absurdities of the Arabian and Gentile profession, and not able to believe
the high mysteries of the Christian Faith, especially the Trinity and
Incarnation. He has admitted the Jesuits there to preach, and would have had
them by miracle to have proved those things to him, which they (elsewhere so
much boasting of Miracles) wisely refused. For the demanded, that the Mulla's,
or Priests of the Mogores, and they, should by passing through the fire make
trial of their Faith. He has many Books and Images, which the Christians
there do use, and seems to have great liking to them, using the same with
great reverence. But his Religion is the same (it seems) with that of
Tamerlane his predecessor, to acknowledge one GOD, whom variety of Sects and
worshippings should best content. He caused loan. Oranus.
thirty infants to be kept, as is said of Psammetichus King of Egypt, setting
certain to watch and observe, that neither their Nurses, nor any else, should
speak unto them, purposing to addict himself to that Religion which they
should embrace, whose Language these infants, should speak; which accordingly
came to pass. For as they spoke no certain Language, so is not he settled in
any certain Religion. He has diverse Idols sometime brought before him, among
which is one of the Sun, which early every morning he worshippeth. He
worshipped also the Image of CHRIST, setting it on the Crown of his head. He
is addicted to a new Sect, as is said, wherein he has his followers, which
hold him for a Prophet. The profit, which they have by his Gold, addicteth them
to this new Prophet. Hier. Xauier.
He professes to work miracles; by the water of his feet curing diseases.
Many women make vows unto him, either to obtain children, or to recover the
health of their children; which if they attain, they bring him their vowed
devotions, willingly of him received. He has three sons; Sciec the eldest,
which is honored with the title G^o, and called Sciecigio, that is, the Soul,
or Person, of Sciec: he much favors the Jesuits: The second, Pahari; Dan,
or Daniel is the youngest: Some call them by other names. His presents are
exceeding, besides his Tributes and Customs: for in eight days space these
gifts amounted to a million of Gold; ^man Pinner.
and almost daily he is presented with the like, and especially in a feast
which he celebrateth, called Nerosa, great gifts are offered: so that his
Treasures occupy the next room to those of China.

Touching the Superstitions of this Kingdom, thus writes Ioannes Oranus, in
his Narration of this Kingdom. Narratio reg. Mogor.
. Not far from the City Tahor is an Idol, resembling a woman, which they
call Nazar Coto, framed with two heads, and six or seven arms, and twelve or
fourteen hands, one of which brandisheth a Spear, another a Club. Hereunto
resort many Pilgrims to worship, and hereof they tell many miracles; as that
many cut off their Tongues, which are again restored whole unto them, but
remain mute. Some think our breath to be our Soul. Some affirm, That all
things are the same thing. Some, that GOD only has a being, other things are
shadows and apparances. Some think all things, and some, the round Circle of
the world, and some, themselves to be GOD. Almost all do hold the commigration
of souls into the bodies of Beasts. They say the World shall last four Ages,
or Worlds, whereof three are past. The first lasted seventeen Laches (every
Laches contains a hundred thousand years) and 28000 years. Men in that
World lived ten thousand years, were of great stature of body, and great
sincerity of mind. Thrice in this space did GOD visibly appear on the Earth:
First in form of a Fish, that he might bring out the Book of the Law of
Brama, which one Causacar had harled into the Sea: The second time in form of
a Snayle, that he might make the Earth dry and solid: Lastly, like a Hog, to
destroy one that said he was God, or as others of them as truly say, to
recover the Earth from the Sea, which had swallowed it. The second World lasted
ten Laches, and 92006 years, in which men were as tall as before, and lived
a thousand years. GOD did appear four times: first, in a monstrous form,
the upper part a Lion, the lower a Woman, to repress the pride of one which
gave out himself for GOD: Secondly, like a poor Bramane, to punish a proud
King, that would by a new-deuised Art flee into Heaven: The third time, to be
revenged of another King, which had slain a poor Religious man, he came in
the likeness of a man, named Parcaram; and lastly, like one Ram, the son of
Gio^orat, which had slain Parcaram. The third World continued eight Laches,
and four thousand years, wherein men lived five hundred years; and GOD
appeared twice in humane likeness. The fourth Age shall endure four Laches,
whereof are already passed 4692 years. They say GOD will also appear in this
Age. Others imagine, that he has already appeared, and that Echebar is he.
Some hold, That those ten appearances were but creatures, which had received
Divine power. They themselves easily perceive the vanity of these Chimara's
and monstrous opinions, but will not leave them, least they should (at the same
cast) loose their wealth and Superstition together.

In this Country of the Mogor they have R. Fitch.
many fine Carts, carved and gilded, with two Wheels, drawn with two little
Bulls, about the bigness of our great Dogs in England, and they will run
with any Horse, and carry two or three men in one of those Carts. They are
covered with Silk, or fine Cloth, and be in use as our Coaches in England.

By the Letters of N. Pimenta ^o. Busa^^.
1600, it appears, that the Mogor had subdued three Indian Kings, of the
Arabian Sect, Abdenagran, Idalcan, Massulapatan, and grew dreadful to the
puissant King of Narsinga, by the current of his Conquests, in that Chersonesus
which trendeth to the South from Cambaia and Bengala, before mentioned.

CHAP. VII.
Of Cambaia, and the neighboring Nations.

CAmbaia is also called Guzarat Maginus.
, containing in length, from the River Bate to Circam, a Persian Region, five
hundred miles of Seacoast, being on other parts environed Mass.l.4.
with the Kingdoms of Dulcinda and Sanga on the North; Mandao, on the East; on
the West, Nautacos, or the Gedrosians. The Sea and the Confines of Decan are
the Southerly bounds. It has in it, by estimation, threescore thousand
Populations, or inhabited Places, watered with many streams, the chief
whereof is Indus, which divides it in the middle, running from Caucasus, or
Naugrocot, and after nine hundred miles journey, with two nauigable mouths
disemboquing it self into the Ocean. This Country is very fertile, not
yielding to any other in India, in the fruits which the Earth and Trees bring
forth, besides their store of Elephants, Gemmes, Silk, Cotton, and such like.
The people are of an Oliue-colour, and go naked, except about their privy
parts. They eat no Flesh, but Rice, Milk, Barley, and other life-lesse
creatures. The inhabitants are, for the most part. ^^^tiles; and so were their
Kings, until the Mahumetane Superstitions prevailed. There are Joseph. Ind.
Linsch.l.1.c.27.
up, within the Land, People called R^isbuti, which are the natural Nobles of
this Kingdom, chased by the Moors to the Mountains, whence they make often
excursions and spoils in the Country, and the Cambayans pay them tribute,
that they might live in peace. Their chief Sea-Townes are Daman, Bandora,
Curate, Ravellum, Bazuinum; and within Land, Cambaia, Madabar, Campanel, Tanaa,
etc.

Cambaia has bestowed the name on the whole Kingdom, which they call the
Indian Cairo, for the excellency thereof: it stands three miles from Indus.
The Tides here L. Vertom.^.4.
increase not, as with us, at the full, but at the decrease of the Moon they
are at the highest. It is not a hundred and threescore years since Macham^^, a
Moore, expelled the Guzarat King.

This Machamut deserves mention for one thing, wherein the Sun has scarce
beheld his like. He so accustomed himself to poisons, that no day passed
wherein he took not some: for else he him self had died, says Barbosa, as it
fares with Amsian, or Opium, the use whereof kills such as never took it,
and the difuse, such as have. And beyond that which we read of Mithrodates in
the like practice, his Nature was transformed into so venomous a habit, that if
he did mean to put any of his Nobles to death, he would cause them to be set
naked before him, and chewing certain Fruits in his mouth, which they call
Chofolos and Tambolos, with lime made of shells, by spitting upon him in one
half hour, deprived him of life: if a Fly sat upon his hand, it would
presently fall off dead. Neither was ^d. Barbosa.
his love to be preferred to his hatred, or with women was his dealing less
deadly. For he had four thousand Concubines, of whom none lived to see a
second Sun, after he had carnally known them. His Mustaches (or hair of his
upper lip) was so long, that he bound it up on his head, as women do with a
haire-lace; and his beard was white, reaching to his Waste. Every day when he
arose, and when he dined, fifty Elephants were brought into the Palace, to
do him reverence on their knees, accompanied with Trumpets, and other Music.

Caelins Rhodiginus Cael Rhod. l.11 c.13.
mentions the like of a maid, thus nourished with poisons, her spittle (and
other humors coming from her) being deadly: such also as lay with her
carnally, presently dying. He cites out of Auicenna a like example of a man,
whose nature, infected with a stronger venom, poisoned other venomous
creatures, if any did bite him. And when a greater Serpent was brought for
trial, he had by the biting thereof a two-dayes Fever; but the Serpent died:
The other did not harm him.

Mamudius, the successor of King Machamut, was a great enemy to the
Portugalls. Badurius succeeded in State and affection, and exceeded in
greatness and ambition. He invaded Moff. l.11.
Mandao, and Sanga, where he besieged Citor, then governed by a warre-like
woman, which not able to hold out longer against him, fled, and left the
people in forlorn plight, who in a desperate resolution (like Sardanapalus)
heaping up their Treasures, set fire thereto, and then cast themselves therein.
This fire continued three days, and consumed threescore and ten thousand
persons.

Hence Badurius triumphantly marched against the Mogor, whom Maffaens calls
Miramudius, (it seems to be Echebars Grandfather, whom some Rel.reg Mog.
call Baburxa, famous for his Indian victories) with an Army of a hundred and
fifty thousand horse, whereof thirty thousand were barded; and five hundred
thousand footmen: of great Brazen Ordinance, a thousand; whereof four
Basiliskes were drawn (such was their weight) by so many hundred yokes of
Oxen: with Shot and Powder he laded five hundred Waines, and as many with Gold
and Silver, to pay his soldiers. These Forces, with this provision, might rend
the Air with thunders, might make the Earth to shake with terror, might dry
and drink up Rivers of water, might frame another fiery Element, of Arts
invention, but could not either terrify the Mogor, or save Badurius from a
double overthrow, first at Doceri, next at Mandoa, where the loses his Tents
and Treasures, and shauing his beard, flees disguised to Diu, in which, that
the Portugalls might be engaged in the same War, he gave them leave to erect
a Fortress: A thing of such moment unto them, that John Botelius (confined
before unto India, for crimes objected) thought, by being the first messenger
thereof in Portugal, to purchase his liberty: whereof he might well be
reputed worthy, who in a little Vessel, scarce eighteen foot long, and six
wide, with undaunted courage contemning that wide, long, and tempestuous Ocean,
arrived with his small company, great news, and greater admiration at
Lisbone. Badurius after alteriug his mind, and therein entertaining a
treacherous project against the Portugalls, colored the same with kindness,
and he (which feared all Cicer. Offic.
men no less the^ he was feared as guilty to his own tyranny, which sometime
made Dionisins of a King a Barber, and now this, a King of others, and his own
Cook, trusting no man to dress his meat) adventured to visit the Portugal
Viceroy in his ships, professing great friendship with great dissimulation,
and by a mean Mariner, at his return, was slain; whereupon the whole Island
submitted it self to the Portugal yoke. And because we have in this Chapter
mentioned so many wonders, let this also have place among (if not above) the
rest, which presently happened Maff. Hist. Ind.l.11.
Whiles the Portugals were busy in their buildings, a certain Bengalan This
same man appeared before Solomon the Turkish General, at the siege of Diu.
Viag.divn Comite Venetian^.
came to the Governor, which had lived, as he affirmed, three hundred thirty
five years. The old men of the Country testified, That they had heard their
ancestors speak of his great age, and himself had a son fourscore and
ten years old, and not at all bookelearned, yet was a speaking Chronicle of
those passed times. His teeth had sometimes fallen out, others growing in their
places; and his beard, after it had been very hoarie, by degrees returned into
his former blackness. About a hundred years before this time he had altered
his Pagan Religion into the Arabian or Moorish. For this his miraculous age,
the Sultans of Cambaia had allowed him a stipend to live on, the continuance of
which he now sought, and did obtain of the Portugalls.

Mamudius, Successor to Badurius, sought with all his forces to drive these
new Lords out of Diu, as Solomon had done before, by a Navy and Army sent
thither, but both in vain: of which Wars, Damianus a Goes Dam. a Goes, op.
Di. ^^^ bell, Camb.
has written diverse Commentaries. But this whole Country is now subject to
the Mogor. It was, in Alexanders time, peopled by the Massani, Sodrae, or
Sabracae, Praestae, and Sangada, as Ortelins has placed them, where Alexander
(as in diverse other places he had done) erected a City of his own name,
called Alexandria. Daman, another Key of this Bay, and entrance of the River
Indus into the Sea, fell to the Portugalls share.

The Land of Cambaia Linschot.
is the fruitfullest in all India, which causes great traffic of Indians,
Portugalls, Persians, Arabians, Armenians, etc. The G^zarates, or Cambaians,
are the subtillest Merchants in all India. They have Od. Barbosa.
amongst them many Histories of Darius and Alexander, which sometime were Lords
of this Indian Province. The Portugalls Gotardus Arthus Hist. India Orient.c.23.
have at diverse times conquered diverse of the chief Towns in this Kingdom,
some whereof they keep still. There are women in Diu, which by art dye their
teeth black, esteeming themselves so much more beautiful, and therefore go
with their lips open, to show the blackness of their teeth. When a Cambayan
dies, they burn his body, and distribute the ashes unto the four Elements
(of which man consists,) The wives are burned with their husbands, being
addressed thereunto in pompous attire.

Six Leagues from Decan is a Hill, out of which the Diamond is taken. This Hill
is kept with a Garrison, and walled about. A little from Ciauli is an old
Temple (supposed to be built by Alexander the Great) adorned with Imagerie, now
the habitation of Battes. Beneath it is a River so deep, that none have yet
found the bottom.

Garcius ab Horto thus writes Gar^, ab Horte Hist. Plant.l.a.c.28.
, That about three hundred years before his time, a mighty King in the
Kingdom of Dely, deprived the Gentiles of the Kingdom of Balaguate. At the
same time the Moors dispossessed the Reisbuti of Cambaya. These Reisbuti in
Cambaya (once the Natural Lords) and the Venezaras and C^lles, of like
condition in Balaguate, to this day exercise Robberies in those parts: the
Kingdom of Decan to these, and to the first the Kingdom of Cambaya, paying
tribute, to be freed from the same. And the Kings suffer them, that they may
share with them. The Kingdom of Dely is Northerly, subject to Cold and Frosts,
as in Europe. The Mogores had possessed this Kingdom, but a certain Bengalan
(rebelling against his Master) slew him, usurped his State, and by force of
war^e added this also to his Dominion; he was called Xaholam Xaholam, i. Lord
of the world.
. This King made his sisters son Daquem.
his successor, who was much addicted to Foreiners: he divided his Kingdom
into twelve parts, or Provinces, over which he set so many Captains: Idalcam,
from Angidaua to Cifarda: from thence to Negarona, Nizamaluco: Over Balaguate,
or the vp-Hill Country (for Bala in the Persian Language signifies the top,
and Guate a Hill) Imadmaluco, and Catalmaluco, and Verid^, etc. These all
rebelled, and captiued Daquem their King at Beder, the chief City of Decan,
and shared his Kingdom amongst themselves, and some Gentiles, partners in the
conspiracy. They were all foreiners but Nizamaluco. This and the other names,
beforementioned, were titles of honor given them, with their Offices, by the
King, corrupted by the vulgar in pronouncing. Idalcam is Adel-ham. Adel, in the
Persian Language, signifies Justice; Ham is the Tartarian appellation,
signifying a Prince, or King (which name might well be the Relikes of the
Tartarian Conquests in those parts) so Adelham is, King of Justice. Neza in the
Persian (which Scaliger Ios.Scal.de Emend.temp.l.7.
says is of like extent in the East, as Latin in the West) is a Lance:
Maluco signifies the Kingdom. Neza, or Nizamaluco, the Spear of Lance of
the Kingdom. So Cota maluco the Tower of the Kingdom, Imadmaluco the Throne
of the Kingdom, etc. Nizamaluco is also called Nizamoxa: which Xa, or Seha, is
a Persian title (signifying Ios.Scal.Can.Isag.l.3.
as Monsiour in France, or Don in Spain) and given by Ismael the Sophi, and
Tamas his son, to all those Kings that would communicate in their Sect, which
Nizamoxa only yielded to. Other of them made show, but soon recanted. Thus

The Religion in Cambaia is partly Moorish, partly Heathenish. Vertomannus

fasting, which lasts with some eight days, with others fifteen, twenty,
or thirty days: in all which space they cate not a bit; only, when they
thirst, drink water. One could not see when to make an end of this his
penance, till his left eye fell out of his head, as both had done before out of
his heart. In Cambaia they had one Bramene in such reputation of holiness and
honor, that they would salute him before they meddled with their worldly
affairs. One affirmed to this Jesuit, That if his Bramene should command him
to distribute all his goods to the poor, he would do it, yea, he would lay
down his life at his command.

On the eight day of January An. Do.1595.
in that City, were given in alms twenty thousand Pardawes (which is in
value about a Flemish Dollar;) one man had given five thousand thereof, another
three thousand, another fifteen hundred. The cause was, because that day (as
their Bramenes affirmed) the Sun departed from Sur to Horte. Of their
Pilgrimages is spoken before; some Eastward to Ganges; some Westward to Mecca,
to wit, the Moors; not men alone, but women also: and because Mahomet has
forbidden all unmarried women this holy journey, they will marry before they
set forth, and dissolve the same Marriage again, after their return. Hereby
they think to purchase merit with GOD.

I went one day (says Pinnerus) to the public Hospital, which the Citizens
of Cambaia had founded for all kinds of birds, to cure them in their
sickness. Some Peacockes were there incurable, and therefore might have been
expelled the Hospital. But (alack for pity of so rufull an accident) a Hawke
had been admitted thither for the cure of his lame leg, which being whole,
he inhospitally slew many of these co-hospitall weaker Fowls, and was
therefore expelled this Bird-Colledge by the Master thereof. For men they had
not an Hospital that were thus Hospital to Fowls.

They have certain Religious persons, called Verteas The Religious in Cambaia.
, which live in a Colledg^ together, and when I went to their house, they were
about fifty in number. They ware white Cloth, were bare-headed, and shaven; if
that word might be applied to them, who pull off their hair on their heads and
faces, leaving only a little on their Crown. They live on alms, nor receive
they but the surplusage of the daily food of him that gives them. They are
wiuelesse. The Orders of their Sect are written in a book of the Guzarates
writing. They drink their water hot, not for Physic, but devotion,
supposing that the water has a soul, which they should slay, if they drank
the same vnsodden. For the same cause they bear in their hands certain little
brushes, with which they sweep the floor, before they sit down, or walk,
least they should kill the soul of some Worm, or other small Creature. I saw
their Priour thus doing.

The General of this Order is said to have an hundred thousand men under his
canonical obedience, and is newly chosen every year. I saw amongst them
little boys, of eight or nine years old, resembling the countenances of
Europe, rather then of India, by their parents consecrated to this Order. They
had all in their mouth a cloth, four fingers broad, let through both their
ears in a hole, and brought back again through their ears. They would not
show me the cause; but I perceived it was, lest some gnat or fly should enter
thither, and so be slain. They teach that the world was made many hundred
thousand years ago: and that GOD did then send three and twenty Apostles,
and now has sent the four and twentieth in this third age, two thousand
years since, from which time they have had writing, which before they had not.

The same Em. Pinner.
Author in another Epistle says, That the most of the Inhabitants of Cambaia
are Bramenes. They eat no flesh, nor kill any thing, yea they redeem beasts
and birds maimed or sick, and carry them to their hospitals to be cured. In
Guzzarat he had seen many Gioghi, a religious order of Monks, which yield to
none in penance and poverty. They go naked in cold weather: they sleep on
dung-hils upon an heap of ashes, with which they cover their head and face. I
saw the place where one of these Gioghi kept in the midst of the City
Amadeba, to whom, in conceit of holiness, resorted more numbers of people,
then to the shores of Lisbone, at the return of the Indian Fleet. This Gioghi
was sent for by the Prince Sultan Morad, son of the Mogor, and refused to come,
One ficritus reports the like of the Gymnosophists.
bidding that the Prince should come to him: it is enough that I am holy, or a
Saint to this end. Whereupon, the Prince caused him to be apprehended, and
(being soundly whipped) to be banished.

This people kills not their kine, but nourishes them as their mothers. I
saw at Amadeba, when a cow was ready to die, they offered her fresh grasle,
and drove the flies from her: and some of them gave this attendance two or
three days after, till she was dead. A league and a half from this City, I
saw a certain Coemiterium or buryingplace, then which I had never seen a
fairer sight, wherein had been buried one Cazis, the Master of a King of
Guzarat, who had crected this Fabrike, and three other were buried in another
Chapel. The whole work and pauement was of Marble, containing three Isles: in
one whereof, I told four hundred and forty pillars, with their chapiters and
bases of Corinthian work, very royal and admirable. On one side was a lake,
greater then the Rozzio at Lisbone; and that building was curiously framed with
fair windows, to look into the lake.

Linschoten Linsch.c.37. Andrea Corsali.
affirms the same things of their Pythagorean error, and adds that they
sometimes buy fowls or other beasts of the Portugals, which meant to have
dressed them, and let them flee or run away. In the highways also and woods
they set pots with water, and cast corn or other grain upon the ground, to
feed the birds and beasts. And (to omit their charitable Hospitalls before
mentioned) if they take a flea or a louse, they will not kill it, but put it in
some hole or corner in the wall, and so let it go: and you can do them no
greater injury, then to kill it in their presence, which with all entreatie
they will resist, as being a heinous sin, to take away the life of that, to
which GOD has imparted both soul and body; and where words will not
prevail, they will offer money. They eat no Radishes, Onyons, Garlike, or any
kind of herb, that has red color in it, nor eggs, for they think there is
blood in them, They drink not wine, nor use vinegar, but only water. They
would rather starve, then eat with any, but their contrymen: as it happened
when I sailed from Goa to Cochin with them in a Portugal ship, when they had
spent all their store, the time falling out longer then they made account of;
they would not once touch our meat. They wash themselves every time they eat,
or ease themselves, or make water. Under their hair they have a star upon
their foreheads, which they rub every morning with a little white sanders
tempered with water, and three or four grains of Rice among it, which the
Bramenes also do as a superstitious ceremony of their law. They sit on the
ground in their houses, upon mattes or carpets, and so they eat, leaving their
staves (which are piked and hooked) at the door: for which cause the heels of
their shoes are seldom pulled up, to save labor of undoing them.

amongst them will sometimes abuse the superstition of these Cambayans to their
own covetousness, bringing some Worm, Rat, or Sparrow, and threatening to
kill the same, so to provoke them to redeem the life thereof at some high
price. And likewise if a malefactor be condemned to death, they will purchase
his life of the Magistrate, and sell him for a slave. The Moors will sometimes
make semblance, as if they would kill themselves, that these foolish Guzzarates
may see them in like sort. They will go out of the path, if they light on an
Ant-hill, lest they might happily tread on some of them: they suppe by
daylight, lest their candlelight should occasion the death of some gnat or
fly. And when they must needs use a candle, they keep it in a lantern for
that cause. If lice do much annoy them, they call to them certain religious
and holy men, after their account: and these Obseruants The like lousy trick
is reported in the Legend of S. Francis, and in the life of Ignatius, of one of
the first Jesuitical pillars, by Maffaeus.
will take upon them all those lice which the other can find, and put them on
their head, there to nourish them. But yet for all this lousie scruple, they
stick not at cousinage by false weights, measures and coin, nor at usury and
lies.

Some are said N.di Cont.
to be zealous in their Idoll-seruice; as to sacrifice their lives in their
honor, by a divine cutting off their heads: the Priest meane-while muttering
his damned holiness, for which they are accounted Saints.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Indian Nations betwixt Cambaia and Malabar, and their Religions.

THe mighty Rivers of Indus and Ganges paying their Fine to the Ledi^ of
waters, the Ocean, almost under the very tropike of Cancer, do (as it were)
betwixt their watery arms present into that their Mothers bosom this large
Chersonesiu; A Country, full of Kingdoms, riches, people, and (our duest
task) superstitious customs. As Italy is divided by the Apennine, so is this
by the hills which they call Gate, quite through to the Cape Comori, which not
only have entered league with many in-lets of the sea, to divide the soil into
many signories and kingdoms, but with the air and Natures higher officers, to
dispense with the ordinary orders, and stablished statutes of Nature, Gi. Bot.

at the same time, under the same elevation of the Sun, dividing to Summer
and Winter their seasons and possessions. For whereas Cold is banished out of
these Countries (except on the tops of some hills) and altogether prohibited
to approach so near the Court and presence of the Sun; and thefore their
Winter and Summer is not reckoned by heat and cold, but by the fairness and
foulensse of weather, which in those parts divide the year by equal
proportions: at the same time, when on the West-part of this Peninsula,
between that rige of Mountains and the Sea, it is after their appellation
Summer, which is from September till April, in which time it is always clear
sky, without once (or very little) rayning: on the other side the hills which
they call the coast of Choromandell, it is their Winter; every day and night
yielding abundance of raines, besides those terrible thunders, which both
begin and end their Winter. And from April till September in a contrary
vicissitude; on the Western part is Winter, and on the Eastern Summer; in so
much that in little more then twenty leagues journey in some place, as where
they cross the hills to Saint Thoma^, on the one side of the hill you ascend
with a fair Summer, on the other you descend attended with a stormy Winter.
The like, says Linschoten, happens at the Cape Rosalgate, in Arabia, and in
many other places of the East.

Their Winter also is more fierce then ours, every man providing against the
same, as if he had a voyage of so many months to pass by sea, their ships
are brought into harbor, their houses can scarce harbor the inhabitants
against the violent storms, which choke the Rivers with Sands, and make the
Seas vnnauigable. I leave the causes of these things to the further scanning of
Philosophers: the effects and affects thereof are strange. The Sea roareth with
a dreadful noise: the winds blow with a certain course from thence: the
people have a melancholic season, which they pass away with play: In the
Summer the wind blows from the Land, beginning at Midnight, and continuing
till Noone, never blowing above ten Leagues into the Sea, and presently after
one of the clock until midnight, the contrary wind blows, keeping their
set-times, whereby they make the Land temperate, the heat otherwise would be
unmeasurable. But this change commonly causes diseases, Fluxes, Fevers,
Vomitings, in dangerous (and to very many, in deadly) manner, as appears at
Goa, where, in the Kings Hospital (which is only for white men) there die
five hundred in a year. Here you may see both the North and South Stars; and
little difference or none is found in the length of day and night throughout
the year.

Dely is the next Kingdom to Cambaia, now not the next, but the same; the
mountains which before divided it, not prohibiting the Mogors forces to annexe
it to his Crown. Of it is spoken before in the Chapter of Cambaya, as also of
Decan, which lies along the coast, betwixt the Rivers Bate and Aliga two
hundred and fifty miles. Here Gio-R^t.Ben. Garcias ab Horto, ^.2.c.28.

was, as is said, sometimes a Moore King; who, leading a voluptuous and idle
life, by his Captains was dispossessed of his State: the one of these was
called Idalcan: whose seat royal is Visapore, who in the year 1572. encamped
before Goa, which the Portugals had taken from him, with an army of seventy
thousand foot, and five and thirty thousand horse, two thousand Elephants, and
two hundred and fifty pieces of Artillery. The other was Nizzamalucco, which
resideth in Danaget, and besieged Chaul, with not much less forces, against a
captain of the Venazary, which are a people that live on spoil, as the
Resbuti in Cambaia, the Belemi in Delly, Canara or Concam, seems to have
been a part of Decan, but is possessed by the King of Narsinga, whose state is
on the East side of the Mountains: it has in it the coasttownes of Onor,
Batticalla, Mayander and Mangalor, Linscho.lib.1.cap.27.
famous for traffic, but eclipsed by the Portugals neighborhood. In these
parts sometimes reigned a Bengalan Prince, which divided his state among his
Captains, which originally for the most part were slaves, that he might ease
himself of the cares of Government. And as he imparted to them great places;
so did he likewise honorable names, Vide supra.cap.7.
calling one Idalcam, which signifies the King of Justice; another
Nisamalucco, that is, the Spear of the Kingdom; another Cotamalucco, the
strength of the Kingdom; another Imademalucco, the pillar of the Kingdom;
another Melique Verido, the keeper of the Kingdom, etc. But he that should
have been the keeper of the Kingdom, was made the keeper of the King, whom
these his slaves and officers by joint conspiracy had taken prisoner at Bider,
his ch^fe town; the Country of Decan falling to those two which are before
named, and the rest to the rest.

is the seat of the Viceroy, and of the Archbishop, and of the Kings Counsel
for the Indies, and the staple of all Indian commodities. It stands in a
little Island, called Tizz^arin, nine miles long, and three broad. Bardes on the
North, and Salzette, are both in like subjection to the Portugals; the King
letting them to ferme, and employing the rents to the payment of the
Archbishop, Cloisters, Priests, Viceroy, and other his officers. There dwell
in this Town of all Nations and Religions. The Government is as in Portugal.
Only public use of foreign Religion is forbidden them: but in their houses
privately, or on the maine land, they may practice the same. The Portugalls
many of them are married with Indian women, and their posterity are called
Mestic^s, and in the third degree, differ nothing in color and fashion from
natural Indians. Of the Portugalls they reckon two sorts, married men, and
soldiers, which is a general name to all Bachellours, although they are at
their own command. Of these are many Knights, and are called Canalhiero
Pidalgo: for if a man do any thing worth reckoning, presently his Captain
imparteth this honor to him; whereof they much boast themselves, albeit that
this Knighthood had descended to Cooks boys. Many of the Portugalls live
only by their slaves. They use great ceremony or pride (which you will call
it) in their behavior: the particulars whereof let Linschoten Linschot.lib.
1.cap.28. 29. 30. 31. 32.
, that there lived amongst them, teach you.

Besides both Abassine and Armenian Christians, Jews, and Moors, here are
many Heathens. The Moors eat all things but swines flesh, and dying, are
buried like the Jews. The Heathens, as De^anijns, Guzarates, and Canarijns,
are burnt to ashes, and some women alive are buried with the Gentlemen or
Bramenes, their husbands. Some will eat nothing that had life; some all but the
flesh of Kine, or Buffles. Most of them pray to the Sun and Moon: yet all
acknowledge a GOD that made all things, and rules them, after this life
rendering to all according to their works. But they have Pagodes, which are
Images, cut and framed most ugly, and like monstrous Devils, to whom they pray
and offer: and to Saints which here have lived holy, and are now intercessours
for them. The Devil often answers them out of those Images, to whom also
they offer, that he should not hurt them. They present their Pagode (when a
marriage is to be solemnized) with the Brides maidenhead; two of her nearest
kinswomen forcing her upon the Iuory pin, (leaving the blood there for
monument) of that devilish Idol; the husband herein applauding his
happiness. They have for the most part a custom to pray unto the first thing
they meet withal in the morning, and all that day after they pray unto it; be
it Hog, or any other thing. But if they first meet with a Crow (whereof
there are great store) they will not for any thing stir out again that day,
after so unlucky a sign. They pray likewise to the new Moon, saluting her
first appearance on their knees. They have Iogos or Hermits reputed very holy:
many Iuglers also and Witches, which show devilish tricke^. They never go
forth without praying. Every hill, cliffe, hole, or den, has his Pagodes in
it, with their furnaces hard by them, and their cesternes always full of
water, with which every one, that passes by, washes his feet, and then
worshippeth and offers Rice, Eggs, or what else their devotion will afford:
which the Bramen^ eats. When they are to go to sea, they will feast their
Pagode with trumpets, fires, and hangings, fourteen days before they set
forth, to obtain a good voyage: and as long after their return: which they
use to do in all their feasts, marriages childbirths, and their harvest and
seed-seasons.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Indian Bramenes.

THe Indian Heathens have a custom, that no man may change his fathers trade,
but must succeed in the same, and marry a wife also of the same Tribe. The
Brachmanui, or, as they are at this day called, the Bramenes (who have their
shoppes, as well as other Merchants, throughout the Cities) are of best
reputation, and wear in sign of their profession (from the shoulder cross
under the arm, upon their naked body, down to the girdle) three strings like
sealing threeds: which for their lives they will not, nor may by their vow put
off. They are naked, saving that about their middles, they have a cloth bound
to hide their priuities. And sometime when they go abroad, they cast a thin
gown over them. Upon their heads they wear a white cloth, wound twice or
thrice about therewith, to hide their hair, which they never cut off, but
wear it long, and turned up as the women do. They have commonly hanging at
their ears, gold-rings. They are very subtle in writing and accounts, making
other simple Indians believe what they will. Whatsoever they meet first with in
the streets, they pray to all day after.

When the Bramenes die, Ceremonies at the death of a Bramene.
all their friends assemble together, and make a hole in the ground, in which
they throw much sweet wood, spices, rice, corn, and oil. Then lay they
therein the dead body: his wife follows with music, and many of her
nearest friends, singing praises in commendation of her husbands life,
encouraging her to follow him, which accordingly she does. For, parting her
Jewels among her friends, with a cheerful countenance she leapes into the
fire, and is presently covered with wood and oil, whereby she is quickly
dead, and with her husbands body burned to ashes. And if it chances (which is
seldom) that any woman resu^eth this fiery conjunction they cut the hair
clean off from her head, neither may she after that wear Jewel, but is
accounted a dishonest woman. This custom is (as may appear) very ancient, and
supposed to have been ordained, because of the libidinous disposition of the
Indian women, which for their lusts would often poison their husbands.

The Bramenes observe fasting-dayes with so great abstinence, that they eat
nothing that day, and sometime not in three or four days together. They tell
many miracles of their Pagodes. They hold the immortality of the soul, both
of beasts and men, and that so often mentioned Pythagorean succession, and
renewing of men's souls, in beasts; and contrariwise. They by the direction of
the Devil (the author of their miracles) frame such deformed statues to their
Idols.

The Indian women in Goa, when they go forth, have but one cloth about their
bodies, which covers their heads, and hangs down to the knees, otherwise
naked. They have rings through their noses, about their legs, toes, necks,
and arms, and seven or eight bracelets upon their hands (according to their
ability) of glass or other metal. When the woman is seven years old, and
the man nine, they marry, but come not together till the woman is able to
bear children. Master Fitch mentions R. Fitch.
the solemnity of these marriages, and the cause, to be the burning of the
mother when the father is dead, that they might have a father-in-law to bring
them up.

To leave Goa with this Island. The Canaras and Decanijns wear their beards and
hair long, without cutting, as the Bramenes. They except from food Kine,
Hogs, and Buffles. They account the Ox, Cow, or Buffle to be holy, which
they have commonly in the house with them, and they besmeere, stroke and handle
them with all friendship in the world; feed them with the same meat they
eat themselves; and when the beasts ease themselves, they hold under their
hands, and throw the dung away: they sleep with them in their houses, hereby
thinking to do GOD service. In other things they are as the Bramenes. For
those are the Laity; these are the Spirituality. When they take their oaths,
they are set within a circle of ashes, on the pauement, and laying a few ashes
on their head, the other on their breasts, swear by their Pagodes to tell the
truth.

The Canarij^s and the Corumbijns are the rustickes, and countrey-husbandmen,
the most miserable people of all India: their religion is much as the other.
They cover only their priuities, and eat all things except Kine, Oxen,
Buffles, Hogs, and Hens flesh. Their women bind a cloth about their
navel, which reaches halfeway the thigh: they are delivered alone by
themselves, without other help: their children are brought up naked, till they
be seven or eight years old, without any trouble about them, except washing
them in a little cold water, and live to be an hundred years old, without
headache, or loss of teeth. They nourish a tuffe of hair on their crowns,
cutting the rest. When the man is dead, the wife breaks her glasse-iewels,
and cutteth off her hair; his body is burnt. They eat so little, as if they
lived by the air: and for a penny would endure whipping.

In Salsette are two Temples, or holes rather of Pagodes, renowned in all
India: one of which is cut from under a hill, of hard stone, and is of compass
within, about the bigness of a Village of four hundred houses: with many
galleries or chambers of these deformed shapes, one higher then another, cut
out of the hard rock. There are in all three hundred of these galleries. The
other is in another place, of like matter and form. It would make a man's hair
stand upright to enter amongst them. In a little Island called Pory, there
stands a high hill, on the top whereof is a hole, that goes down into the
hill, dug and carved out of the hard rock; within, as large as a great
cloister, round beset with shapes of Elephants, Tigers, Amazons, and other
like, workemanly cut, supposed to be the Chinois handy-worke. But the
Portugalls have now overthrown these Idoll-Temples. Would GOD they had not set
new Idols in the room; with like practice of offerings and pilgrimages, as did
these to their Pagodes.

I once Linschoten.
went into a Temple of stone, in a Village, and found nothing in it, but a
great table that hung in the middle of the Church, with the image of a Pagode
thereon painted, hellishly disfigured with many horns, long teeth out of the
mouth down to the knees, and beneath his navel with such another tusked and
horned face. Upon the head stood a triple crown, not much unlike the Popes. It
hung before a wall, which made a partition from another chamber, like a quier,
close without any light: in the middle whereof was a little door, and on each
side of it a furnace within the wall, with certain holes thereby to let the
smoke or savor of the fire to enter into that place, when any offering should
be made. Whereof we found there some, Rice, Corn, Fruits, Hens, and such like.
There issued thence such a filthy smoke, and stink, that it made the place
black, and almost choked such as entered. We desired the Bramene to open the
door, which with much entreaty he did, offering first to throw ashes on our
foreheads, which we refused, so that before he would open us the door, we were
forced to promise him not to enter beyond the door. It showed within like a
lime-kill, being close vaulted, without hole of window: neither had the Church
it self any light but the door. Within the said Cell hung an hundred burning
lamps, and in the middle stood a little Altar covered with cotton cloth, and
over that with gold; under which, as the Bramene told us, sat the Pagode all
of gold, of the bigness of a Puppet.

Hard by the Church without the great door, stood within the earth a great
fouresquare cisterne, hewed out of free stone, with stairs on each side to go
down into it, full of green, filthy, and stinking water, wherein they wash
themselves, when they mean to enter into the Church to pray. In the evening,
they carried their Pagode on Procession, first ringing a bell, wherewith the
people assembled, and took the Pagode out of his Cell with great reverence,
and set it in a Palamkin, which was borne by the chief men of the Town; the
rest following with great devotion, with their usual noise and sound of
trumpets, and other instruments; and having carried him a pretty circuit,
brought him to the stone-cisterne, washed him, and placed him again in his
Cell, making a foul smoke and stink, and every man leaving his offering
behind him, intended to the Pagode, but consumed by the Bramene and his family.
As we went along by the ways, we found many such shapes under certain
couertures, with a small cisterne of water hard by, and half an Indian nut
hanging thereby, to take up water withal, for the travelers to wash and pray.
By the said Pagodes do stand commonly a Calfe of stone, and two little
furnaces; before which they present their offerings. My fellow leaping on one
of those Calves in the Church, the Bramene called out, and the people came
running, but we stayed their fury by gentle persuasion of the Bramene before.
And thus much of these deformed forms, and misshapen shapes, with their
worshippings and worshippers suitable. Like lips, like lettice. Vain Rites,
stinking sinkes and smokes, ugly Idols, conspiring with internal Darkness of
the minds, and external Darkness of their Temples; to bring an eternal
Darkness to the followers, that all may shut up (as they are begun) in a
hellish period.

Botero says, The Bramenes also worship Gi.Bot.Ben.lib.2.part.3.Maff.lib.1.
one Parabramma, and his three sons, and in honor of them wear those three
threeds aforesaid. He affirms, that the Ioghi wander up and down through
India, abstaining from all carnal pleasure, but a certain time; which being
expired, they are past possibility of further sinning, and are then called
Abduti, as the illuminate Elders of the Familists, polluting themselves in all
filthiness. The Bramenes Od. Barbosa.
have Images of the Trinity and have in religious estimation the number of
Three. They acknowledge and pray to the Trinity in Unity: but affirm many
Demigods, which are his Deputies in governing the world. They honor the
Portugalls Images also, as approaching to their own superstition. They marry
but one wife, and admit no second succeeding marriage. The Bramenes must
descend of the Bramene Tribe, and others cannot aspire to that Priesthood: but
some are of higher account then others: For some serve for messengers, which in
time of war, and among thieves may pass safely, and are called Fathers. They
will not put a Bramene to death for any crime.

When they are seven years old Od. Barbosa.
they put about their neck, a string two fingers broad made of the skin of a
beast called Cressuamengan, like a wild Asle, together with the hair: which
he wears till he is four years old, all which time he may not cate Betelle,
a leaf.
Betelle. That time expired, the said string is taken away, and another of
three threads put on, in sign that he is become a Bramen, which he wears all
his life. They have a principal amongst them, which is their Bishop, which
corrects them, if they do amiss. They marry but once, as is said, and that
not all, but only the eldest of the Brethren, to continu^ the succession, who
is also heir of the fathers substance, and keeps his Wife streitly, killing
her, if he find her Adulterous, with poison. The younger brethren lie with
other men's wives, which account the same as a singular honor done unto them.
They have great revenues belonging to their churches, besides offerings, and at
set hours of the day resort thither to sing and do other their holy rites.
Twice in the day, and as often in the night, their Pagode is taken out of the
Altar, and set on the Bramenes head, looking, backward, and is carried in
procession three times about the Church, the Bramenes wives carrying lights
burning: every time they come to the principal door of the Church, which is
on the West side thereof (some churches have two doors beside) they set it
down on their offering-stone, and worship it. Twice a day they bring it to
eat of their sod Rice, as often (it seems) as the Bramene is hungry. When
they wash them (which is often) they lay a little ashes on their heads,
foreheads, and breasts, saying that they shall return into ashes. When the
Bramenes wife is with child, as soon as he knows it, he cleanses his teeth,
and abstaineth from Betelle, and observes fasting till she be delivered. The
Kings of Malabar will scarce eat meat but of their dressing. Sumario di pop
orient.
They are of such estimation, that it Merchants travel among thieves, and
robbers, one Bramene in the company secureth them all, which Bramene will eat
nothing of an other man's dressing: and would not become a More for a Kingdom.
Ni.di Conti says Nic.di Conti.
he saw a Bramene three hundred years old: he adds, that they are studious
in Astrology, Geomancie, and Philosophy. To be short, they are the Masters of
Ceremonies and the Indian Religion, in whose Precepts the Kings are trained up.
Besides these Mas.l.1
secular Bramenes, there are other Regular, as those Ioghi and Vertae: of which
we have spoken. There are also some that live as Heremites in Deserts: some in
Colleges: some wander from place to place begging: Some (an unlearned kind)
are called Sanasses: Nic.Pimenta
Some, contrary to the rest, nothing esteem Idols, observe Chastity twenty
or five and twenty years, and feed daily on the Pith of a fruit called
Caruza, to preserve in them that cold humor, neither do they abstain from
Flesh, Fish, or Wine, and when they pass along the way, one goes before them
crying Poo Poo, that is, way, way: yea, the King himself honors them; and
not they, the King: Some live, enclosed in iron Cages all filthy with Ashes
which they strew on their heads and garments: some burn some part of their
body voluntarily: All are vainglorious, and seek rather the shell then the
Kernel, the show then the substance of holiness. I have thought good to say
thus much together of them, as in one view representing the Bramenes; a name so
aunciently, so universally communicated to the Indian Priests, although some
particulars before have been, or hereafter may be said touching some of them
in other places, according to the singularity of each Nation in this so
manifold a profession.

CHAP. X.
Of the Regions and Religions of Malabar.

MAlabar extends it self Maginu^.
from the River Cangeracon to the Cape Comori; which some take to be the
Promontory Cory, in Ptolomey: Maginus doubts whether it be that which he
calls Commaria extrema. Piol.l.7. ca. 1.
In the length it contains little less then three hundred miles, in breadth
from that ridge of Gate to the Sea, in some places, fifty. It is full of
people, divided into many states, by variety of Rivers, which cause horses to
be unserviceable in their Wars, and nourish many Crocodiles, enrich the
soil, and yield easy transportation of commodities, which are spices of
diverse kinds. They have Batts, in shape resembling Foxes, in bigness, Kytes.
The chief kingdoms in this Tract are Kano^or, Calecut, Cranganor, Cochin,
Carcolam, and Tranancon. About Lop. Castaneda L.1. Od. Barbosa. G. Bot Ben.

seven hundred years since it was one kingdom, governed by Scma, or Sarama
Perimal, who by persuasion of the Arabian Merchants became of their Sect, in
which he proved so devout, that he would end his days at Mecca. But before
his departure he divided his estate into these petty Signories, among his
principal Nobles and kindred: leaving unto Coulam the spiritual pre-eminence,
and the Imperial Title unto his Nephew of Calicut, who only enjoyed the Title
of Zamori or Emperor, and had prerogative of stamping Come. Some exempt from
this Zamoria Empire and Allegiance, both Coulam, the papal Sea of the High
Bramene, and Cananor: and some have since by their own force exempted
themselves. This Perimal died in his holy voyage: and the Indians of Malabar
reckon from this division their Computation of years, as we do from the
blessed Nativity of our LORD. He left (says Castaneda) to himself but
twelve leagues of his country, which lay near to the shore where he meant to
imbarke himself, never before inhabited: this he gave to a Cousin of his then
his Page, commanding, that in memory of his imba^king there it should be
inhabited, commanding the rest to take him for their Emperor (except the Kings
of Coulan and Cananor) whom yet with the rest he commanded not to Coin money,
but only the King of Calacut. For Calecut was therefore here built: and the
Mores for the imbarking took such devotion to the place, that they would no
more frequent the Port of Coulan, as before (which therefore grew to ruin) but
made Calicut the staple of their Merchandise.

Calicut, the first in order with them, shall be so with us. The City is not
walled nor fair built, the ground not yielding firm foundation, by reason of
the water which issues if it be dug. This Kingdom has not above five and
twenty leagues of Seacoast, yet rich both by the fertility of the soil,
which yields corn, spices, Cocos, Iaceros, and many other Fruits: and by the
situation; as the Staple, especially before the Portugales unfriendly
neighborhood, of Indian Merchandise, and therefore in her variety of
Merchants being a Map (as it were) of all that Eastern world. The losephus
Indus
Egyptians, Persians, Syrians, Arabians, Indians, yea, even from Catay the
space of six thousand miles journey, here had their trade and traffic. The
Palace also contained four halles of Audience, according to their Religions,
for the Indians, Mores, Jews, Christians. Of their Bramenes or Priests we
have already said. They yield Divine honors to diverse of their deceased
Saints, and (...) (dedicated to an A^e) has large porches, and has (says
Maffaus) seven hundred Marble Pillars, not interior to ^^^ of Agrippa in the
Roman Panthcon. It seems that the ground in that place is not of so queasie
and waterie a stomach, but that it can digest deep foundations. To Elephants
they attribute like Divinity: but most of all to Kine, supposing that the
souls of men departed do most of all enter into these beasts. They have many
books of their superstition approaching to the Augur^il discipline of the
He^^^^^ans, and fond Fables of the Graecians: and diligently conceal the same
from vulgar knowledge, except some Bramene Proselyte do detect those
Mysteries. They believe One GOD Maker of Heaven and Earth, but add that he
could have no pleasure in so weighty a charge of governing the World, and
therefore has delegated the same to the Devil to reward every man according
to his works; him they call Deumo: they name God Tamerani. Lud.vert.l.5.c.2.
The King has in his Palace the Chapel of Deumo, carved full of Devils, and
in the midst fi^teth this Image of met^all in a Throne of the same matter,
with a triple crown like the Popes, and four horns, with teeth, eyes, and
mouth wide and terrible, with hooked hands, and feet like a Cock. In each
corner of this square Chapel is a Devil set in a fietie Throne, wherein are
many souls, the Devil putting one with his right hand into his mouth, and
taking another from under him with his left hand. This Idol is washed by the
Bramenes with sweet water, incensed and worshipped every morning. Sometime in
the week they sacrifice on this manner. They have an Altar strewed with
Flowers, on which they put the blood of a Cock, and coals of fire in a Silver
Chafingdish, with much persumes, incensing about the Altar, and often tinging
with a little Bell of Silver. They hold in their hands a silver knife, with
which the Cock was killed, which they dippe in the blood, and put into the
fire with many Apish gestures. All the blood is thus burned, many Waxe-candles
burning meane-while. The Priest has on his wrists and legs as it were
Morrice-Bels (...) at his neck: and when he has ended his Sacrifice, he
takes his hands full of Wheat, goes ^ackewar^ from the Altar (on which he
always sixeth his eyes) to a certain tree, and then ^urleth the Corn up over
his head as high as he can: after which he returns and vnfurnisheth the
Altar. The King of Calicut eats no meat, before four principal Bramenes
have first offered thereof to the Devil, which they do lifting both their
hands over their heads, and shutting their fists draw back the same with their
thumb, presenting of that meat to the Idol, and then carry it to the King on
a great Leaf, in a treene platter. The King fitteth on the ground at his
meat, without any thing under him, attended with Bramenes, standing four
paces off, with their hands before their mouths in great reverence. And after
the King has eaten^ those Priests carry the relics into the Court, where
they clap thrice with their hands, whereat presently certain Crows resort
thither to eat the Kings leauings, which crows are hereunto accustomed and
may not be hurt of any.

When the King marries a Wife, Castaneda and Barbosa says, that she is not
married but as his Concubin^
one of the principal Bramenes has the first rights lodging with her, for
which he has assigned him by the King four hundred, or five hundred ducats.
The King and his Gentlemen, or Nairos, eat not flesh without license of the
Bramenes. The King commits the custody of his Wife to the Bramenes, when
he trauelleth any whither, and takes in too honest part their dishonest
familiarity. But for this cause, the Kings son succeeds not in the crown,
but his Sisters son, as being certainly of his blood. These sisters of the
King choose what Gentleman they please, on whom to bestow their Virginity, and
they prove not in a certain time to be with child, they betake them to these
Bramene-stallions.

The Gentlemen and Merchants have a custom to exchange wives in token of great
friendship. Some women amongst them have six or seven husbands, fathering her
children on which of them she best pleases. If a debtor break day with his
creditor, and often disappoint him, he goes to the principal of the
Bramenes, and receives (...) circle about him charge him in the name of the
King, and the said Bramena, not to depart thence till ne has satisfied the
debt, which if he do not, he must sterue in the place; for if he depart, the
King will cause him to be executed. The new King for one years space cateth
neither Fish not Flesh, nor cutteth his Hair, or Nails: uses certain
prayers daily, eats but one meal, and that after he has washed, neither may
he look on any man till he has ended his repast. Od.Barbosa.
At the years end be makes a great Feast, to which resort above ten thousand
persons to confirm the Prince and his Officers: and then much alms is given.
He entertaineth ten thousand women in diverse offices in his Palace. These
make to the King (after his fasting year is out) a Candlemasse-Feast, each of
them carrying diverse lights from the Temple (where they first observe many
Idol and idle ceremonies) unto the palace with great music and other
iollitie.

^. Ba^bosa reckons eighteen Sects that have no mutual conversation, nor
may marry but in their own ranks or order. Next to the king and Bramenes, he
places the Nayros, which are Gentlemen and Soldiers, and are not professed
Nairos (notwithstanding their-bloud) till they be by their Lords or by the
King made Knights or Soldiers. And then he must never from that time go
without his weapons, which commonly are a Rapier and a Target, and sometimes
Pieces or Bows. They never marry, but lie with such of the Nairos Women or
Daughters as like them, leat^^ng his weapons meane-while at the door, which
forbid any man else, although it be the good man himself to enter, till he
has ended his business and be gone. And if one of the common people once touch
a Nairo, it is lawful for the Nairo to kill him: and he is also unclean, and
must be purified by certain washings. And for this cause they cry as they go
in the streets, Po, Po, that the baser raskallity may give place. They have a
pit of standing water at their doors hallowed by the Bramenes, wherein every
morning they wash themselves, although it be green, s^^mie, and stinking,
imagining thus to be cleansed of their sins. They are brought up altogether
to foates of Arms and actituitie from their Childhood, admirably able to
wind and turn themselves, and are very resolute and desperate, binding
themselves by Oath to live and die with their King or Lord. No Nairo's women
may enter into Calicut but one Night in the year, when the City is full of
lights: and they go with the Nairos, to behold and gaze their fill. They
intend nothing but their lust, and think that if they die Virgins they shall
never enter into Paradise.

The Biabari are another sort, and are Merchants, Gentiles, and enjoy great
privileges. The King cannot put them to death, but by sentence of the
principal of themselves. They were the only Ma^chants before the Mores
traded there, and still enjoy many possessions. These marry one Wife, and their
Children inherit, and they may touch the Nairo's. The Cugianem are a Sect of
the Nairo's, having a law and Idols by themselves, which they may never alter.
They make Tiles to cover the Temples and the Kings Palace. The Nairo's may lie
with their women, but must wash themselves before they go home.

Another Sect is called Mananta^^ar, which are Landerers, nor may they or their
posterity be of other function: nor may they mingle themselves with any other
generation. They have Idol-ceremonies and temples by themselves. The Nairos may
use their wives (or women rather.) Their brethren or Nephews are their heirs.
The Calien are Weauers, and have a distinct idolatrous Sect; otherwise are as
the former.

Besides these of better condition, there are of baser sort eleven Sects, which
may not marry nor meddle with others. The first of these are called Tiberi,
husbandmen; the second, Moger, and are Mariners; both having their proper
superstitions, and use their women in common. The third, are Astrologers, whom
they call Caniun. Great men ask their counsel, but may not touch their
persons. The Aggeri are Masons and workers in metalls. The Muchoa or Mechoe are
Fishers; dwelling in Villages by themselves; the men, thieves, the women
Harlots, with whom they please. The Betua are Salt-makers: The Paerun are
Iugglers, Inchanters, and Physicians (if such damnable deuillish practices may
deserve so honorable name.) which, when any are sick and require their help,
use coniuration to cause the Devil to enter into some of them, and then by his
suggestion declare the event of the disease, and what sacrifices or other
things are to be performed. They may not touch or be touched of other men.
The Reuolet are a baser sort of Gentiles, which carry wood into the City to
sell, and Herbs. The Puler are as Excommunicate persons, and live in desert
places, where the Nairos have no occasion to pass, and when they go near any
these Nairos, or any of the better sort, they cry as loud as they can (as
L^u.13.45.
the Lepers among the Jews) that others may avoid them. For if any touch
them, their kindr^o may for such action or passion slay them, and as many of
these Puler also, as may make satisfaction for such disparagement. Some nights
they will go of purpose, seeking to touch some of the Nairo-women with hand,
stick, or hurling of a stone: which if they effect, there is no remedy for
the woman but to get her forth and live with these Villains, or to be sold,
to escape killing by the hands of her kindred. These Puler are Thieves and
Sorcerers. The Pareas are of worse esteem, and live in Deserts without
commerce of any, reputed worse then the Devil. These ten sorts (or eleven if
you reckon two sorts of the Tiberi, as our Author does; whereof one are
warriors, distinguished by a certain cudgel, which they must carry in their
hands, from the Nairos) are as well differing in Religions, as matters of
common life: though, for their several rites, it were wrong to the Reader at
large to recite them, if we had the particulars to deliver.

There are besides these Gentiles, Natural of Malabar, many strangers of
Indians, Mores, and Christians. But in other Kingdoms of Malabar, the
heathenish Religion is little differing from that in Calicut. I. op.de
Castanedo. G.B.B.
Generally amongst them, the Bramenes and Kine are had in such honor, that
when the Kings create their Nairos, he girdeth them with a sword, and embracing
them one by one, bids them have care of the Bramenes and the Kine.

Cranganor is a small Kingdom: the Inhabitants of the City, which gives name
to the Region, are Christiana of Saint Thomas prosession, about seventy
thousand in number. Cochin is now grown great by the Portugales traffic and
friendship. Of the rest there is not much worth recital. The Papal Maglnus.
honor among the Bramenes, which some ascribe to Coulam, Maginus bestows on
the King of Cochin. In these parts are now many Christian proselytes of the
Jesuits conversion, besides many of the old Thomas-Christians.

The King of Coulams Dominion Od. Dar.
stretches beyond the Cape Comori (where Malabar ends) on the East side
fourscore and ten miles, as far as Cael: which diverse great Lords hold under
him. Among the rest is the Signiorie of Quilacare. In the City of Quilacare is
an Idol of high account, to which they solemnize a Feast every twelfth year,
where the Gentiles resort as the Popish Christians in the Romish Iubilee. The
Temple sacred to this Idol has exceeding great revenue. The King (for so he
is called) at this Feast erecteth a Scaffold covered with silk, and having
washed himself with great solemnity, he prays before this Idol: and then
ascends the scaffold, and there in presence of all the people cutteth off his
nose, and after that, his ears, lips, and other parts, which he castes
toward the Idol, and at last he cutteth his throat, making a butcherly
sacrifice of himself to his Idol. He that is to be his successor must be
present hereat: for he must undergo the same martyrdom, when his twelve
years Iubilee is come. Along this coast dwell the Paraui, simple people, and
Christians, which live by fishing of Pearls. The Nairos make such holes in
their ears, that Caesar Frederike Caes.Fred.
says he thrust his arm up to the shoulders in one of them. They are
prodigal in their lives in the honor of their King: Osorius Osorius.
tells of some, which, like the renowned Decij. had vowed themselves to
death, and not to return from the enemy without victory.

Besides those former Sects, Stephanus de Brito Step.de Brit. 1600.
speaks of the Maleas which inhabit small Villages in the mountains, which
are hunters of Elephants: amongst whom are no thefts or robberies, and
therefore they leave their doors open when they go abroad. They are skillful
in Music, and Magike. They have no Idol amongst them; only they observe
their ancestors s^pulchers.

Of the Feast which all the Malabar-kings hold every twelfth year in honor of
the River Ganges, we have there spoken Supra cap. 5.
where we have discoursed of the River: This Feast lasts eight and twenty or
thirty days with great solemnity, to the furtherance whereof certain
soldiers; to the number of thritie; rush among the people, and kill as many
as they can; themselves certain to be killed of the Kings Soldiers. This is
the Tribute imposed by the King of Calecut on one of his vassals, to honor
this solemnity with such a number that shall thus sell their lives as dear as
they can. Of the Election and erection of the Zamoryn, we have spoken in the
beginning of the Chapter: Let us here add out of Castaneda Hernan. ^opes de
Castaneda. ^.1.c.14.
concerning his devotion. He says that this King of Calycut is a Bramene, as
his predecessors also. And for that it is a custom that all the Kings die in
one Pagode or Idol. temple, he is elected for that cause. For always there is
and must be in that house a King to serve those Idols, and when he that serves
there, dies, then must the King that then reigns leave his Empire, and go
serve in that place as the other did; another being elected to succeed him in
the Kingdom. And if any refuses to forsake his Court for the Pagode, they
enforce him thereunto.

The Kings of Malabar be brown men, and go naked from the Girdle upward, and
from thence down ward they are covered with cloth of Silk and of Cotton,
adorned with Jewels. For their Children; the sons inherit not, but the
brother, or if there be none, the Sisters son. When their Daughters are ten
years old, they send out of the Kingdom for a Nayro, and presenting him with
gifts, request him to take her Virginity: which having done, he tieth a
Jewel about her neck, which she wears during her life, as a token that
from thence-forth she has free power of her body, to do what she will, which
before she might not. After their death Funeral Rices.
these Kings are carried forth into a plain field, and there burned with sweet
Wood, very costly, their kindred and all the Nobility of the country being
present: which done, and the ashes buried, they shave themselves, without
leaving any hair except on the brows and eyelids, even on the least child;
and for the space of thirteen days cease to eat A lease, of which see Cap.

Betele (his lips are cut that does it) and all that time is an Interregnum,
wherein they observe if any will come in to object any thing against the new
future King. After this Inauguration of the new King.
he is sworn to the Laws of his predecessor, to pay his debts, to recover
whatsoever belonged to his kingdom being lost, which oath he takes having
his sword in his left hand, and in the right a Candle burning, which has a
ring of Gold upon it, which he touches with two of his fingers and takes his
oath. This being done, they throw or pour upon him a few Grains of Rice, with
many other ceremonies and prayers, and he worshippeth the Sun three times:
after which, all the Caymailes or principal Nobles swear their feal^ie to
him, handling also the same Candle. The thirteen days ended, they eat their
Betele again, and flesh and fish as before; the King except, who then takes
thought for his predecessor, and for the space of one whole year (as is before
observed in part out of Barbosa) eats no Betele, nor shaueth his beard, nor
cutteth his Nails: eats but once a day, and before he does it, washes all
his body, and observes certain hours of prayer daily. The year being ended,
he observes a kind of Dirige for his predecessors soul, whereat are
assembled a hundred thousand persons, at which time he gives great Alms, and
then is confirmed. All these Malabar-kings have one especial man, which is the
chief administrator of Justice, who in matters of government is obeyed no
less then the King himself. The Soldiers are Nayros, none of which can be
imprisoned or put to death by ordinary justice: but if one of them kill
another, or else kill a Cow, or sleep with a Country-woman, or speak evil
of the King; the King after information gives his warrant to another Nayro, who
with his associates kill him wheresoever they find him, hewing him with their
swords, and then hang on him his warrant to testify the cause of his death.
These Nairos may not wear their weapons, or enter into combat, till they be
armed Knights, although that from the age of seven years they are trained up
in feats and practice of Arms. He The dubbing of the Nairo's.
is dubbed or created by the King, who commands to gird him with a Sword, and
laying his right hand upon his head, muttreth certain words softly, and
afterward dubbeth him, saying; Have a regard to keep these Bramenes, and their
Kine. When they yield themselves to any man's service, they bind themselves to
die with him, and for him, which they faithfully perform, fighting till they
be killed. They are great Soothsayers, have their good and bad days, worship
the Sun, the Moon, the Fire, and the Kine, and the first they meet in the
morning. The Devil is often in them (they say it is one of their Pagodes)
which causes them to utter terrible words; and then he goes before the king
with a naked Sword, quaking, and cutting his flesh, saying with great cries; I
am such a God, and I am come to tell thee such a thing; and if the king
doubts, he roareth louder, and cutteth himself deeper till he be credited.
The Portugalls have much eclipsed the greatness of the king of Calycu^, and
caused many other alterations in all the East in this last Age of the world. Of
whose exploits Castaneda, Barrius, Maffaeus, Osorius, and others have written
at large.

CHAP. XI.
Of the kingdom of Narsinga and Bisnag^r.

FRom those places where our feet last rested (or touched rather) unto the
Cape Guadauerin Magin. Gi. Bo^er. Be^.
betwixt that ridge of mountains called Gates, and the Ocean (which is there
named the Gulf of Bengala) trendeth the kingdom of Narsinga or Bisnagar;
those two royal Cities contending which shall give name to this mighty Empire,
containing two hundred leagues of Seacoast. The king has in continual pay
forty thousand Nairos. But as occasion serves, he can bring into the field
many many thousands more, as in that Expedition against Idalcan specified by
Barrius and Boterus; in which, to let pass that world 700000.foot.40000 horse.
700.elephants. 20000. horlots.
of people, he sacrificed unto Idols twenty thousand seven hundred and three
score head of beasts and fowls in nine days space, which in Idoll-deuotion
were all bestowed after on the poor.

In the year of our LORD 1567. Biznagar C.Fred.
was sacked by four Kings of the Moors, (as says Frederike) naming them
Dialcan, Zamaluc, Cotamaluc and V^idy, through treason of her own Captains:
but having sacked it (as not able to hold it) they retired home. The city
remained after, an habitation for Tigers and wild beasts; containing in circuit
four and twenty miles, as our Author (that stayed there seven months)
affirms. He never saw Palace exceeding that of Bisnagar. It had nine
gates, with guards of soldiers; Here he observed their rites in burning the
women so often mentioned.

The woman The solemnity of burning of the wife after her husbands death.
takes two or three months respite after her husbands death: the day being
come, she goes early out of her house, mounted on an horse or elephant, or
else on a stage carried by eight men: apparelled like to a Bride adorned with
jewels, and her hair about her shoulders; holding in her left hand a
Looking-glass; in the right, an arrow: and sings as she passes through the
City, saying; That she goes to sleep with her husband. She is accompanied
with her friends, until it be one or two of the clock in the afternoon: then
they go out of the city passing by the rivers side to the burning-place,
where is prepared a great square Cave full of wood. Here is made a great
banquet, the woman eating with joy, as if it were her weddingday, and after they
sing and dance till the woman bid to kindle the fire in the cave; then she
leaves the Feast, and takes her husbands nearest kinsman by the hand, and
goes with him to the bank of the river, where she strippeth her of her
clothes and jewels, bestowing them at her pleasure, and covering her self
with a cloth, throws her self into the river, saying; O wretches, wash away
your sins. Coming out of the water, she rowleth her self into a yellow
cloth; and again, taking her husbands kinsman by the hand, goes to the said
cave, by which is erected a little Pinnacle, on which she mounteth, and there
recommendeth her children and kindred to the people. After this, another woman
takes a pot with oil, and sprinckleth it over her head, and therewith
annoynteth all her body, and then throws it into the furnace, the woman going
together with the same. Presently after the woman the people throw great pieces
of wood into the Cave, so that with those blows, and the fire, she is
quickly dead: and their great mirth is on a sudden turned into great
lamentation and howling.

When a great man dies, both his wife and slaves with whom he has had
carnal copulation, burn themselves together with him. Amongst the baser sort,
I have seen (says Master Frederike) the dead man carried to the place of
burial, and there set upright: The wife immured with her dead husband.
the woman coming before him on her knees, casts her arms about his neck,
while a Mason makes a wall round about them: and when the wall is as high as
their necks; one coming behind the woman, strangleth her, the workman
presently finishing the wall over them; and this is their burial.

Ludouicus Vertomannus Lud.Vert.li.6
relates the same funeral rites of Tarnasseri (as in other parts of India)
saving that there fifteen or twenty men in their idolatrous habit, like
Deuilles, do attend on the fire wherein the husband is burned; all the
Musicians of the city solemnizing the funeral pomp: and fifteen days after
they have the like solemnity, at the burnign of the woman, those devilish
fellows holding fire in their mouths, and sacrificing to Deumo, and are her
intercessors to that devil for her good intertainement.

The cause of burning the wives is by some ascribed to their wonted poysonings
of their husbands before this Law; Od^ricus.
by others, that the husband might have her help and comfort in the other
world.

In these parts is the City of Saint Thomas or Malepur, where they say Saint
Thomas (after he had preached the Gospel to the Indians) was martyred and
burned. The Legend which some report of his death, were too tedious to recite:
and as little likeliehood of truth is in that long tale of the miraculous
Crucifixes here sound, related by Osorius, Osorius libr. 3.
who likewise declares the rites of those Saint Thomas-Christians, of their
Chaldean Pope, Cardinals, Patriarchs and Bishops; of which in an other place
we shall more fitly speak. On the first day of July Saint Thomas holy day is
celebrated, as well by the Pagans as Christians: and his Sepulcher is had in
devout estimation both of the Moors, Gentiles, and Christians; each Od.

pretending the right of his own Religion to the Church, where this Saint lies
interred, to which the Indian Christians go on pilgrimage, carrying with them
a little of that earth for a great relike. A Moore had the keeping of the
Church, which was built after our fashion, and begged of the comers for
maintenance of it, and of a Light continually burning therein.

now inhabit this Town almost desolate: the Jesuits also have here a
residence. The Church-doores (by the superstition of some) are almost cut in
pieces, and carried away to set in gold and silver, and to wear about their
necks, as a holy relike; the Portugalles herein being exceedingly vain, and
attributing hereunto many miracles, verifying that Proverb which the Spaniards
use, affirming the Portugals to be Devout little fools.
Pocos sotos devotos. One sent Linschoten a whole bead-roll or pair of Beads
thereof, the bringer affirming that those beads had calmed a tempest
miraculously by the way. The Inhabitants in this respect have driven their
Church-doores full of nails: but Saint Thomas bones are now removed to Goa.
Those doors are of such renowened holiness, because they were made of that
wood which Saint Thomas drew with his girdle out of the haven (which it
choked) and could not before ^^^ be removed

Odoricus Odoricus
tells of a strange and uncouth Idol, as big as Saint Christopher, or pure
gold, with a new band about the neck full of precious stones, some one
whereof was of value (if he valewed justly) more then a whole kingdom: The
roof, pauement, and seeling of the walls, within and without the Temple, was
all gold. The Indians went thither on pilgrimage, some with halters about their
necks, some with their hands bound behind them, some with knives sticking on
their arms and legs; and if after their pilgrimage, the wounded flesh
seftered, they esteemed that limb holy, and a sign of their Gods favor.
Near to the Temple was a lake whereinto he Pilgrims cast gold, silver, and
gemmes for honor of the Idol, and reparation of his Temple. At every yearly
feast the King and Queen with the Pilgrims and people assembling, placed the
said Idol in a rich Chariot, and with a solemn prosession of Virgins two and
two in a rank singing before him, and with musical Instruments carry him
forth. Many Pilgrims put themselves under the charriot-wheels, where they are
crushed in pieces. More then five hundred persons used thus to do, whose
carcasses were burned, and ashes kept for holy relics. Otherwise also they
will deuore themselves to such a martyrdom in this manner. The parents and
friends assemble and make a feast to this Votary, and after that hang five
sharp knives about his neck, and so carry him before the Idol, where he
takes one of his knives, and cries; For the worship of my God I cut this my
flesh; and cutting a piece, casts it at the face of the Idol, and so
proceeding, at the last says; Now do I yield my self to death in the
behalf of my God; and being dead, is burned as before.

Our Countryman S. John Mand ^^^
sir John Mandeuile reports the same History of their Idol Procession, and
the ashes of those voluntary Martires, which they keep to defend them against
tempests and misfortunes. He also says, that some Pilgrims in all their
peregrination, not once lifted up their eye-liddes, some at every third or
fourth pace fell down on their knees to worship, some whipped, others wounded
themselves; yea, and killed themselves (as is before said.) Nicholao di Conti
Nic^ di Conti.
reports the same in his time.

Neither is this bloody custom yet lest, as Linscboten Linschat. libr.1.c2.44.
affirms by report of one of his Chamber-fellowes that had seen it. They
have (says he) a wagon, or cart, so heavy, that three or four Elephants
can hardly draw it, which is brought forth at Faires, Feasts, and Processions.
At this Cart hang many Cables or Ropes, whereat all the people hale and pull,
of devotion. In the upper part of the Cart stands a Tabernacle, and therein
the Idol: under it sit the Kings wives playing on Instruments. And while the
Procession passes, some cut pieces of their flesh, and throw at the Pagode,
some lay themselves under the wheels of the cart, with such event as you have
heard.

Gasp^ro Balby relates the same, and adds, that the Priests, which have care
of this Idol, and certain women, are conscrated to these devotions from their
Cradles by their zeale-blinde parents. Balhy ca. 28. and Arthus Dan.
bist.Ind.O^.c.1.
And the women prostitute their bodies, to gain for the Idol whatsoever they
can get over and above their own maintenance. This fills the City with
strumpets; there being of this Sacred (you may interpret it Cursed) crew,
four hundred in one place of the City. These have their place in the
Idol-Procession, some of them in the Chariot which is drawn by men; every
one accompting himself happy, that can touch or draw the same. This he says
was at Negapaton.

He further affirms, that not far from the City of Saint Thomas is the
Town Casta: where the wife is not burned (as at Negapatan) but a great grave
being made for the deceased husband, they place the living wife by the dead
corpse, and their nearest kindred cast earth upon them both, and stamp
thereon. They which marry, wed in their own degree, as a Smith to Smiths
daughter; and they power out their prayers at the Image of some Cow, or a
Serpent called Bittia di capella. Their Bramine ^burne Cowes-doung; and if they
intend any wars with other Nations, they annoint their nose and forehead with
those ashes, not washing themselves till the evening. They which have
sacrificed themselves to the Pagode, when they have wal^^^ arrows, and
diversely mangle themselves; at last, cutting their own throats, so sacrificing
themselves to the Pagode.

There are also certain people called Amouchi, otherwise Chiavi, which
perceiving the end of their life to Ociperate dying.
approach, lay hold on their weapons, which they call Chisse and going forth,
kill every man they meet with, till some body (by killing them) make an end of
their killing. They are loath (it seems) to come into the devils presence
empty-handed, or to go to Hell alone. Some of them worship GOD in the
likeness of a Man; some in the Images of Kine and Scrpents: some inuoke the
Sun and Moon; others, some Tree or River.

Among many Feasts which they celebrate in the year, one in Autumn is most
solemn, in which they take some great tree, and fasten it in the ground,
having first fashioned it like a mast of a ship, with a crosse-yard, whereon
they hang two hooks of iron. And when any one by sickness, or other misery, has
made a vow to their Idol or Pagode, he comes thither, and being first
admonished by the Priests to offer his sacrifice, they lift him with those
hooks by both the shoulders, and there hold him to the Idol, till he has
3.times saluted the same, with clapping his folded hands to his breast, and
has made some sport thereto with weapons which he has in his hand. After this
he is let down, and the blood which issues from his shoulders is sprinkled
on the tree, in testimony of his devotion. Then they draw him up again by the
middle, to give thanks to the Idol: and then give him leave to heal
himself, if he can. They which are in great misery, or seek some great
matter at the hand of their Idol, do this. They have an other Feast,
celebrated in the night, continuing eight nights: in which many candles are
seen burning through the City. Three or four run from one end of the
street to the other, and hurling rice, and other meats after them, say, they
offer it to the devil which follows them; not daring to look behind, lest
he should slay them.

In other places also they have those idoll-chariots, like unto Towers, to the
drawing whereof, many thousands of devout persons put their helping-hand.
Francis F.Fernandes epist. 1598.
Fernandes says, that Cidambaran is the mother-city of their Pagan-rites,
wherein are many stately Temples, and the revenue of the Bramenes amounted to
thirty thousand ducats, but now they are paid but twelve thousand yearly.

Here happened a strange accident, the same day the Jesuits departed, which
was this. There is in this City a Temple of Perimal, wherein they worship an
Ape called Hanimant, whom they report to have been a GOD, and (for I know not
what) together with many thousands of other gods, to have remained there, being
all transformed into Apes. Now when this principal Ape was forced to pass
into the Island Zeilan, and wanted a ship, he leaped, and at every leap left an
Island or heap of land behind him, so making way for his apish train to
Zeilan. The tooth of this Ape was kept for a great relic in that Island with
great resort of Pilgrims thereunto: and in the year Linschot. c. 44.
1554. was by the Portugalls, (who made a road thither, in hope of great
booty) taken away. The Indian Princes offered the Viceroy three hundred
thousand (or as Linschoten tells, seven hundred thousand) ducats, for the
ransom of this Apes tooth, but the Archbishop dissuaded the Viceroy; who
thereupon burnt the same before those Indian Ambassadors, and threw the ashes
into the Sea. Not long after, a Benian^ of Cambaia persuaded the Indians, that
he by Divine power had taken away that holy tooth being inuisibly present, and
had left another in the room which was burnt. Superstition is credulous, and
the King of Bisnagar gave him a great sum of gold for that Apes tooth,
wherewith he thus apishly had bitten and mocked them, which was after holden
in like veneration as the former. But to return to our Cidambaran History.

They F. Fernand.
tell, that a holy man, in great penance, had many years held his foot
pierced through with a piece of iron; and when he was often by GOD commanded
to leave that selfe-rigour, he flatly refused, unless that he might see GOD
dancing about him, which also he condiscended unto; and with the Sun, Moon
and Stars, which played the Musicians, he appeared dancing. And as he
daunced, a Chain of gold fell from his foot, whereof this Town took name.
For Cidambaran signifies a golden Chain.

Now at this time 1598.
there was a great contention, whether the sign of Perimal should be erected
in the Temple of Cidambacham. This sign was a gilded mast, with an Ape at the
foot thereof. Many Ambassadors were there about this quarrel; somevrging,
some resisting this deed. But the Prince (called the Naicho of Gingi) would
have it set up, not withstanding the Priests greatest unwillingness. The
priests therefore both regular (which are the Iogues) and secular Bramenes
ascended up the roof of the Church, and thence threatened to hurl down
themselves, which twenty of the Iogues did, and the rest threatened to follow.
But the Naicho caused gunnes to be discharged at them, which slew two, and
caused the rest to retire and break their covenant, rather then their necks,
with their fellows. A woman also of this faction cut her own throat for zeal
of this new superstition. The swelling style of this king of Bisnagar I thought
worthy to be here inserted, which is this. The titles of the Kings of Bisnagar.
The husband of good fortune, the God of great Provinces, King of the greatest
Kings, and God of Kings, the Lord of horsemen, the Master of them which can
not speak, Emperor of three Emperors, Conquer our of all he sees, and
Keeper of all he conquers, dreadful ^^^the eights coasts of the World,
vanquisher of the Mahumetans, etc. Lord of the East, west, North, and South,
and of the Sea, etc. Vencapat adinus Ragiu Denamaganus Ragel, which now rules
and governs this world.

With the Naicho or King of Gingi (vassal to the King or Emperor of Bisnagar)
the: Jesuits found good entertainment. Here some of the Iogues distributed
the water of Ganges out of certain vessels covered with soul and filthy
clothes, which yet the people for devotion kissed. These Iogues with admirable
patience endured the Suns heat: and one among the rest enclosed himself in
an iron Cage, with his head and feet only out of the Cage, that he could
neither sit nor lie down at any time: and on the Cage were hanged a hundred
Lamps, which four other Iogues his companions lighted at certain times. And
thus walked he in this his perpetual prison, as a Light unto the world in his
vainglorious opinion. They reasoned with certain Bramenes; some of which
held the Sun for God, and yet sometime to have been a man, and for his
merits so promoted. Some denied a multitude of Gods, only allowing that
privilege to Pyrama, Vidhun, and Vnitir, one of which Makes, an other
keeps, the third destroys all things.

Near to Madure is an idol called Chocanada: which by night appeared in
Vision to a Priest, and bade him go say to the Naicho of Madure, that he or I
must abide in this house: whereupon he would not be corriuall with his Idol,
but resigned the Palace to him. His devotion is such, that every day while he
fitteth in judgment, a Bramene ever and anon sounds the name of Aranganassa
in his ears: and when one is weary, another succeeds in the same office,
never ceasing this Idols remembrance, although he there fitteth five or fix
hours.

I thought meet to mention one Custom Dis. of China page 401.
which some report of the Brama, or Pope-like Bramene in these parts, who by
his authority dispenses with many of their Laws, and dis^olueth Marriages:
giving liberty at his pleasure to the women to marry an other; which his
dispensation is sealed on her right shoulder, with a mark of a hot iron.

Chandagrin is the royal seat of the great King of Bisnagar Melebin Cotig^^^.
The chief Families therein are the Bramenes, Raius, and Cretius. They affirm
that their Idol Peri^all did bring forth the first out of his head (as the
Poets tell of Minerua;) the second out of his breast; the third out of his
belly: and all other inferior Families out of his feet. The Bramenes have
some opinions, not altogether dissonant from the Scriptures. They say, that GOD
only by his thought made a man, which they call Adam.

On the tenth day of July Anno 1600. happened an Eclipse of the Sun, which
the Bramenes said was by means of the Dragon (which they make a celestial
sign) his biting of the Sun and Moon: whereupon the King and others neither
eat nor drank that day; deploring their misery, because the Dragon devoured
the Sun. In the City Prepeti, three miles from Chandegrin is the feast of
Perimall, in remembrance of his marriage: at which the offerings amounted to
two hundred thousand crowns: and the Chariot of the idol was drawn forth a
mile and half in Procession by ten thousand men. They have an other Feast of
the Kine, because they suppose Perimal to be the son of a Cow, and then the
ways and streets are full Siman ^^^
of that cattle. They have a feast in honor of the Sun, which lasts eight
days, solemnized by the Emperor himself, and he is judged a traitor which
is not present thereat. Then they castlots, the King first, and after the rest,
divining by arrows the next years destiny. If an arrow light on a tree, and
being plucked out causes a red liquor to follow, it prognosticateth wars; if
white, peace. Not far hence is an Idol called Tripiti, to which are great
Pilgrimages and Offerings; always as they go, some begin, and the rest
answer, and so all continue to resound the name of the Idol Goia. Before they
enter into the Temple, they shave and wash themselves. They have Heremites
which they call Sanasses, who live in deserts, and at some times appear before
the people naked. They have others which they call Gurupi, learned Priests, (as
it were a degree of Doctors) which bear a great port, and never go forth on
foot. The Idol Tripiti is seated on a mountain, about which are fertile
valleys; stored with fruits, which none may touch, as being consecrated. There
are in the woods great abundance of Apes, so tame, that they will take meat out
of men's hands: the people esteem them a divine race, and of the familiarity
of Perimal the chief God, whom they worship in many colors and shapes, as of
a man, ox, horse, lion, hog, ducke, cock, etc.

As Veiga Em.de Veiga.
and Ricius; two Jesuits, traveled to Chaudegrin, they came to Travilur,
where they saw their Idol, with a white banner on his back, and after him
three sacred kine, with Drummers on their backs, and after them Trumpetters
and many Musicians of other sorts. Then followed thirrie women dancing, which
were also consecrated to the Idolles service, and might not marry, but vet
prostitute their bodies: these were richly attired, and carried Lights. The
Priests followed with the Idol, and were followed by the people with Lights.
At their return they set down the Idol, and set sodden rice before him to
eat; others mean while driving away the flies; and others covering him that
he should not be seen eating: and at last, one makes a long Oration of the
worthy acts of their God, and then set him again in his place. This lasted
four hours; and in the mean space many reasoned with the Jesuits, and some
held vain Discourses of the Creation: as, that there were seven Seas; one of
salt water, the second of fresh, the third of honey, the fourth of milk, the
fifth of Tair (which is cream beginning to sour) the sixth of sugar, the
seventh of butter: that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it was borne up by
the Heaven. Others dissented, and said, that the Earth was borne up by seven
Elephants; the Elephants feet stood on Tortoises, and they were borne by they
knew not what.

When the Naicho of Tangaor Mel^h. Cotig.
died, three hundred of his Concubines willingly offered themselves to the
fire, to honor his funeral; so much can Custom harden so delicate and
soft-hearted a nature.

The Temples Gi.Rot.Bin.
in this Country have great revenues, which in some places are increased by
the devotion of women, which prostitute themselves to gain for their Idols:
and many young girls are brought up for this purpose. Many are here in these
parts, of the Sect of the Guzzarats, which kill no quick thing, as is spoken
Os^r.lib.4.
Some have a stone hanging about their necks, as big as an egg, with certain
lines drawn through the middle thereof; and this they worship, and call it
Tambarane: they keep every Friday holiday.

The kingdom of Orissa has on the seacoast three hundred and fifty miles,

is the royal city; from whence the river Ganga passes, and at his fall into
the Sea joins his waters with those of Ganges. The Inhabitants (except a few
Moors) are Gentiles, little or nothing (that I can learn) differing in rites
from their neighbors, of which ye have heard. Some Summario di.pop.orient.
ascribe to the City Orissa, as the name, so the principality of the other
Cities of this kingdom.

One thing I thought not to omit: That there be Linscbot.c.15.
whole Villages and kindreds of people, in other things like to other men, but
are borne with one of their legs and one foot from the knee downwards, as
thick as an Elephants leg; which the common people imagine to be a curse by
Divine justice, inflicted upon the whole Generation, for that their
Progenitors murdered Saint Thomas. Linschoten says, he has seen and spoken
with them, and could learn no other cause thereof. It is to them a deformity,
but no let or impediment otherwise.

And thus have we finished our perambulation of the Continent of Asia. Now let
us ship our selves over (for we are not skilful of Hanimants leapes) unto the
Islands: having first feasted you with the fruits and other rarities of Nature
in Indie.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Creatures, Plants, and Fruits in India.

OF the Elephant and Rhinoceros is already spoken: and of diverse others of
their beasts. The Elephant is of great use both for War and Peace. When the
keeper employeth him in any burden, he gets first on his neck, and puts
his feet under the beasts ears, having a hook in his hand, which he sticks
above between his ears, where his stones lie: they bind the burden with a
rope, which at his keepers bidding he takes in his mouth, and windeth it about
his teeth, and so draws the pack after him. The Elephants are said to keep
themselves chastely to one female, which is thought to bring forth in a year
and half or two years. Christ. Acosta in fine Linschot. lib.1.cap.46. Thomas
Lopez; etc.
Christophorus Acosta, Linschoten, and other modern Authors, as also
Aristotle, Pliny, Aelian and others of the Ancient, relate strange reports of
the Elephant. For the Readers delight I will mention some. An Elephant being
weary, hasted home; his keeper after much entreatie not prevailing, told him it
was for the King of Portugalls service, which he would have him do: the beast
answering hoo, hoo (which in the Malabar language signifies I will, I will, as
Acosta interprets) fulfilled his request. The same Elephant wanting his meat;
his master said it was because his kettle wherein he used to boil it was
broken, and therefore willed him to carry it to the Tinker; which he did, and
brought it again, but ill-mended: whereupon he was sent again, and the Tinker
to try him, amended it worse. The Elephant carries it to the river which ran
by, to see if it would hold water, and finding it to run, came back with
great noise and anger: the Tinker entreats pardon, and at the third time does
it well; which yet the Elephant would not believe, till by trial he saw it
held water, and then showing it to the standers by that it would hold, carried
it home. A soldier hurled a Coco-shell at an Elephant: which (because he
could not then repay it) put the shell in his mouth, and a few days after
seeing him in the street, at Cochin, he hurled the same out of his mouth at the
soldier again. Another soldier injured the keeper of an Elephant, which
would have revenged the wrong, but was forbidden by his said keeper: but after
espying the soldier, when his keeper was absent; he took him up in his trunk
and ducked him diverse times in the water, and then set him down where he had
taken him up. They are very ambitious. One being vpbraided of lazines by his
keeper, when as his burden was too heavy for him to draw, and therefore they
had brought another Elephant to help him; disdaining a companion, thrust him
away, and drew himself dead in the place. Another in like case fell on his
forelegs, and wept at his keepers chiding, and although he admitted a
companion till the greater difficulty was overcome, yet feeling it the^ in his
own power to draw, he put away the other Elepha^t with his head and teeth, to
recover his credit. Of the admirable capacity, gratitude, and other qualities
of this beast, were tedious to recite. An ample testimony hereof, is the
example of the King of Aua his Elephant before mentioned. Of the Rhinoceros I
have little further to say: as of other beasts tame and wild, which Nature
yields in other places as well as here.

As for fowls, they have abundance of Parrots, and Noyras, more pleasing in
beauty, speech and other delights then the Parrot, but cannot be brought out
of that country alive. Of Bats as big as Hens, about Iaua and the
neighbor Islands, we have already spoken. Clusius Clus. Exot. lib. 5.cap.1.
bought one, of the Hollanders, which they brought from the Island of Swannes,
Ilha do Cerne, newly styled by them Maurice Island; it was above a foot from
the head to the tail, above a foot about, the wings one and twenty inches
long, nine broad, the claw whereby it hung on the trees, was two inches, the
pisle easily seen, etc. Here Cap.4.
they also found a foul which they called Walgh-vogel, of the bigness of a

Ind.Or.
say it has no tongue, and that it puts out the pisle backwards, as the
Camel: that it deuoureth Oranges and Eggs, rendering the same in the ordure,
nothing altered.

Of the birds of Paradise, elsewhere is showed the falsehood of that opinion,
which conceive them to want feet, whereas they go as other birds, but being
taken, the body (for the most part) together with the feet are cut off, and
they being dried in the Sun, is so hardened and closed, as if Nature had so
formed them. This is testified by ^^^inerarium.A Pigaset. Holland. Nau.
Pigafetta, and the Hollanders. Of this, Clusius in his Auctarium has a large
Discourse, showing diverse kinds of them, a greater and a less: and says that
Iobin de Weely of Amsterdam sold one of them, which had feet, to the Emperor,
1605. But I would not herein be tedious. Of the birds and beasts of India,
Acosta, Linschot^n, Cinsius, besides Gesner and others can inform the studious.

They have Crows so bold, that they will come flying in at the windows, and
take the meat out of the dish, as it stands on the table before them that are
set thereat: and are such vexatio^ to the Bussles, that they are forced to
stand in waters up to the necks, that they may be rid of them. They have Rats,
which the Cats dare not touch, as big as young Pigges, which undermine the
foundations of houses in such sort with their diggings, that they sometimes
fall to the ground. There are other little red Rats, which smell like musk.
Incredible is the scathe which they receive in Goa by the Pismires, which with
such huge multitudes will presently assail any thing that is fatty, or to be
eaten, that they are forced to set their cup-boords and chests, wherein are
their victuals and apparel, with a wooden cisterne of water under every of
their four feet, and that in the middle of the room. And if they forget to
have water in the cisterne, presently these Ants are all over, and in the
twinkling of an eye (says Linschoten) they will consume a loaf of bread. The
like cisternes have they for their beds and tables: and for the pearches whereon
they set their Canary birds, which else would be killed by Pismires, yea though
it hung on a string from the roof of the house. The poorer sort which want
cup-bords, hang their fragments in a cloth on the wall, having a circle of
charcoales about it; with this wall to keep out this small creature, and great
enemy. There are other Ants almost a finger long, and reddish, which do great
harm to fruits and plants. Great is the harm which Moths and Worms do in
men's cloths and books, which can very hardly be kept from them. But more
hurtful is the Baratta, which flies and is twice as big as a Be, from which
nothing almost can be kept close enough, and are to be esteemed as a plague
among them like to the Pismires, and are commonly in all fat wares and sweet
meats, and when they come upon apparel they leave their staining eggs behind.

The Salamander is said Icones de Bry Ind. Or.p.rt.4.
to be common in the I Will of Madagascar. Of Serpents L.Vert.Lib.5.cap.22.
they have diverse kinds and very venomous, besides one other kind as big as a
Swine, which is destitute of poison, and hurts only by biting. But the
superstition of the King of Calecut multiplieth their serpents. For he causes
cottages to be set up to keep the^ from the rain, and makes it death to
whomsoever that shall kill a Serpent or a Cow. They think Serpe^ts to be
heavenly spirits, because they can so sudde^ly kill men. So much has that old
Serpent, both at first and since, deluded me^ by this venomous creature. There

are hogs with horns in the Moluccas^in Celebes and Mindanao are hogs, which
bendes the teeth they have in their mouths, have other two growing out of
their snouts, and as many behind their ears of a large spanne and half in
length.

Of fish they have great plenty and variety. They have of Hayens or Tuberons
which devour men, especially such as fish for pearls. And others bath
themselves in cisternes, not daring to adventure the rivers for them. Of
fish-monsters like men, and like an hog some write: and as monstrous is that,
which Maffans Maff. hist. Ind. lib.7.
tells of a Whale, which with the opposition of his huge body, stayed the
course of a ship sailing with eight other ships into India, with so great a
noise and shaking, as if they had fallen on a rock. Neither could the winds,
which filled the sails, further her course. The Mariners, when they saw two
elements of Wind and Current, so strongly encountering, looked out and saw this
monster, with her finnes embracing the sides of the ship, and enterlacing the
stern with her tail, applying her body to the keele, which contained about
An hundred and five Dodrantes.
eighty foot in length. They thought presently that some hellish fiend had
been sent to devour them; and consulting of remedy, at last sent out their
Priest in his holy vestments, with crosses and exorcismes: who (like the
greater devil) prevailed with these weapons, and the Whale forsook them
without further hurt.

There are Linsc.c.48.
certain fish-shells, like Scalop-shells, found on the shore; so great that
two strong men with a leauer can scarce draw one of them after them. They have
fish within them. A ship (called Saint Peter) fell upon sands, sailing from
Cochin, and split. The men saved themselves, and of the wood of the old ship
built a Caruell, wherein to get to the Continent, but in the mean while were
forced to make a sconse, and by good watch to defend themselves from certain
Crabbes of exceeding greatness, and in as great numbers, and of such force,
that whomsoever they got under their claws, it cost him his life, as two
Mariners of the same ship told me.

Crabbes here with us have a sympathy with the Moon, and are fullest with her
fulness: in India there is a contrary antipathy, for at a full Moon they are
emptiest.

They have Oysters, in which the Pearls are found, which are fished for by
duckers, that diue into the water, at least ten, twenty or thirty fathom. These
men are naked, and have a basket bound at their backs, which, being at the
bottom, they rake full of Oysters and dirt together, and then rise up and put
them into boats. They lay them after on the land, where the Sun causes, them
to open, and then they take out sometime many, sometime few Pearls, as each
Oyster yields, which is sometimes two hundred grains and more. The King has
one part; the soldiers, a second; the Jesuits, a third; and the fishers
themselves the fourth: a small recompense for so great a danger, in which many
men every fishing-time lose their lives. The Hollanders found Tortoises so
great, that ten men might sit and dine within one of the shells.

Of their fruits, Ananas is reckoned Paludanus.
one of the best: In taste like an Apricocke, in show a far off, like an
Artichoke, but without prickles, very sweet of sent. It was first brought out
of the West Indies hither. Iacas are bigger then the former, and grow out of
the body of the tree: they are of many pleasant tastes, but hard, to digest.
Of Mangas there are three forts, they are as big as goose eggs. The first
sort has stones, which the second wants. The third is poison so deadly, that
yet no remedy has been found against it. Of the like bigness is the Caions,
of which, of the Iambos, Iangomas, Carambolas, Iambolij^s, Papaios, etc. I
leave to speak, as not writing an Indian Herball, but only minding to mention
such things, which, besides their country, have some variety of nature,
worthy the observation. For the rest, Garcias ab Horto translated by Carolus
Cl^sius, Paludanus, Linschoten, Christophorus, Acosta writing particularly of
these things) and others in their general Herballs, may acquaint you.

Of this sort is the Indian Fig Tree; if it may may be called a tree, which is
not above a man's height, and within like to a reed, without any woodie
substance: it has leaves a fathom long, and three spans broad, which open and
spread abroad on the top of it, It yields the fruit in fashion of the
clusters of grapes, and bears but one bunch at once, containing some two
hundred figs at least, which being ripe, they cut the whole tree down to the
ground, leaving only the root, out of which presently grows another, and
within a month after bears fruit, and so continues all the year long. They
are the greatest sustenance of the country, and are of very good taste, and
smell, and in those parts men believe that Adam first transgressed with this
fruit.

But of greater admiration is the Of this, besides Linschoten see Garcias
Hort^. with Clusius notes. Ex^t lib.7.c.26.
Coquo-tree, being the most profitable tree in the world, of which in the
Islands of Maldiua they make and furnish whole ships: so that (save the men
themselves) there is nothing of the ship or in the ship, neither tackling,
merchandise, or ought else but what this tree yields. The tree grows high
and slender, the wood is of a spungie substance, easy to be sowed, when they
make vessels thereof, with cords made of Cocus. For this nut (which is as
big as an Estridge egg) has two sorts of husks, as our Walnuts, whereof
the uppermost is hairy (like hemp) whereof they make Occam and Cordage, of the
other shell they make drinking-cuppes. The fruit, when it is almost ripe, is
full of water within; which by degrees changes into a white harder substance,
as it ripeneth. The liquor is very sweet, but with the ripening grows sour.
The liquor extracted out of the tree is medicinable; and if it stand one hour
in the Sun, it is very good vinegar, which being distilled, yields
excellent Aqua-vitae, and wine. Of it also they make, by setting it in the
Sun, Sugar. Of the meat of the nut dried, they make oil. Of the pith or
heart of the tree, is made paper for books and evidences. Of the leaves they
make couerings for their houses, mattes, tents, etc. Their apparel, their
firing, and the rest of the commodities which this tree (more plentiful in the
Indies, then willowes in the Low Countries) yields, would be too tedious to
recite. They will keep the tree from bearing fruit, cutting away the
blossoms, and then will hang some vessel thereat, which receives from thence
that liquor, of which you have heard. It is the Canarijns living, and they will
clime up these trees, which yet have no boughs, but on the top, like apes.
This tree has also a continual succession of fruits, and is never without
some.

No less wonder does that tree Clusius describes this tree out of the
Relations of Pliny lib. 12. Curtius lib. 9. Strab^. l.5. Theophrastus lib.4.
and mentions like kinds (if not the same) out of Lopez de Ca^agneda lib.7.
Oustdo lib.6. Lope^ or Piga^^^^^ of Congo, etc. clus. Exet. lib.I.cap I.
cause, which is called Arbore derais, or the tree of roots: Clusius calls it
(by Plinies authority) the Indian fig tree: and Goropius (with more
confidence, then reason) affirms it to be the tree of Adams transgression. It
grows out of the ground, as other trees, and yields many boughs, which
yield certain threads of the color of gold, which growing downwards to the
earth, do there take root again, making as it were new trees, or a wood of
trees, covering by this means the best part sometimes of a mile: in which the
Indians make galleries to walk in: The figs are like the common, but not so
pleasant.

The Arbore triste Garcias ab Horto lib. ^. c.1. C. Acosta.c. 37. says it
grows most in Malabar.
deserves mention: It grows at Goa, brought thither (as is thought) from
Malacca: The Hollanders saw one at Acri in Samatra. In the daytime and at
Sun setting, you shall not see a flower on it: but within half an hour
after, it is full of flowers, which at the Sunne-rising fall off; the leaves
shutting themselves from the Suns presence, and the tree seeming as if it
were dead.

And that ye may know the Indians want not their Metamorphoses and Legends,
they tell that a man, named Parisatico, had a daughter, with whom the Sun was
in love; but lightly forsaking her, he grew amorous of another: whereupon this
Damsel slew her self, and of the ashes of her burned carcass came this tree.

Bettele The Plant Bettele.
is a leaf somewhat like a Bay-leafe, and climeth like Iuie, and has no other
fruit: neither is any fruit more in use then these leaves: at bed and board,
and in the streets as they pass, they chew these leaves; and in their
gossippings or visiting of their friends, they are presently presented with
them; and eat them with Arecca, which is a kind of Indian nut. It saves
their teeth from diseases, but colors them as if they were painted with
black blood. When they chew it, they spit out the juice, and it is almost the
only exercise of some, which think they could not live, if they should
abstain one day from it.

They hane an herb called Dutro^, which causes distraction, without
understanding any thing done in a man's presence: sometimes it makes a man
sleep as if he were dead the space of four and twenty hours, except his
feet be washed with cold water, which restores him to himself; and in much
quantity it kills. The women give their husbands thereof, and then in their
sights will prostitute their bodies to their lewder lovers, and will call them
Cornudo, stroking them by the beard: the husband sitting with his eyes open,
grinning like a fool, and when he returns to himself, knows nothing but
that he has slept.

Another strange herb is called Sentida, or feeling, for that if any pass by
it, and touches it, or throws sand or any thing else on it, presently it
becomes as if it were withered, and closes the leaves; so continuing as long
as the man stands by; but so soon as he is gone, opens fresh and fair:
and touching it again, it withers as before.

But the strangest plant (for so may we term it) is, that at Goa the horns of
beasts slaughtered are thrown together in one place, lest they should be
occasion of indignation and reproach to any; the showing or naming of a horn
being there ominous. These horns thus cast forth, after a certain time, take
root, and the roots grow two or three spannes in length.

Pepper (whereof there are diverse forts) grows at the foot of Arecea, or some
other tree, on which it climeth, as Bettele or Iuie; growing in bunches like
grapes.

Cinamom Garcias ab Horto.i.1.c.1^.
is the inner bark of a tree as big as an Olive; with leaves like bay-leaues,
and fruit like an Olive: The drying of the bark makes it roll together.
Within three years after, the tree yields another bark, as before. In
Seylon is the best. They of Ormuz call it Darchini, that is, wood of China: and
selling it at Alexandria, call it Quasi Amomum ex Sina delatum.
Cinnamemum.

Ginger Ginger.
grows like young reeds, or Gladiolus, with a root like a Lilly: it is
plentiful in Malabar.

Cloves Cloves.
grow in the Moluccos on trees, like Bay-trees, yielding blossoms, first
white, then green (at which time they yield the pleasantest smell in the
world) and last of all red and hard which are the Cloves. They are so hot of
nature, that if a paile or tub of water should stand in the chamber, when they
cleanse them, or any vessel of wine or of her moisture, in two days the Cloves
would suck it out and dry it. The same nature is in the vnspunne silk of
China.

The Nutmegge-tree, Nutmegs.
is like a Peach or Peare-tree, and grows most in Banda and Iaua. The fruit
is like a Peach, the inner part whereof is the Nutmeg, which is covered and
interlaced with the Mace or Flower, and over that, is the fruit like a Peach,
as I have seen them conserved. When the fruit is ripe, the first and outermost
part opens, as it is with our Walnuts, then the Mace flourishes in a fair
red color, which in the ripening becomes yellow.

It were an endles^e piece of work, and not so pertinent to our purpose, to
speak of the rest of the spices, drugges, and fruits in India: These (as the
rarest or cheese) I have chosen so (as it were) to recreate our Reader with a
walk, and howres-view in this Indian Garden, being before full cloyed with our
tedious narrations of their superstitions. I might add here a discourse of
Gemmes, as Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds, etc. But it becomes not my poverty to
talk so much of Jewels. The greatest virtue in any which I have read of, was
of that which Osorius Osor. de Reb. Em.lib.7. ^8.
says, would not suffer a drop of blood to fall from him that ware it, who
yet, without loss of blood, was flaine by a great wound: and this Jewel was
lost by shippe-wracke, when it should have been sent to Portugal for a
present to the King. He which had this Jewel, as called N^hodaheguea, a Prince
of Samotra, which was killed in his ship; and the Portugalls ri^^ing him,
found no blood about him, till they had taken from him a chain of gold, in
which this stone was enclosed, and then he bled freshly This stone is taken
out of certain beasts, which the Siamites call Cabrisias. The Bezar-stone.
Bezar-stones are likewise taken out of the maw of a Persian or Indian Goat,
which the Persians call Pa^^r. And in the Country of Pan, by Malacca, they
find within the gall of an Hog a stone, of greater force against poison and
other diseases, then that Pazar-stone. It is thought that these stones
doeproceed of the pasture whereon these beasts feed. The Amber is found as well
in other places as in India. Garcias Garcias ab Horto. in Clus. Exot.lib.7.c.1.
thinks it to be the nature of the soil, as Chalk, Bole-armenike, etc. and
not the seed of the Whale, or issuing from some fountain in the sea, as others
hold. Clusius tells a probable opinion of D. Marel, that it was an excrement
gathered in the Whales belly.

Galmano Discou.
writes of a small vermin in Sian, which cleaves fast to the trunk of the
Elephant, and thence sucketh out his blood and life: his skull is so hard that
it cannot be pierced with a hand-gun: and in his liver is said to be the
likeness of men and women, and he which has one of them about him, is safe
from wounds by iron. He tells of a tree in Mindanao; the one half whereof
(which stands toward the East) is a good remedy against poison: the
Western half yields the strongest poison in the world. There is a stone, on
which whosoever sits, shall be broken in his body.

CHAP. XIII.
A gennerall Discourse of the Sea, and of the Islands adjoining to Asia.

AFter our long perambulation of the Asian Continent, the sea inuironing does
solicit our next endeavors, that the Reader might there refresh his wearied
sense, with a new succession of Natures varieties, and humane vanities. And
first, while our Bark be made ready to ship us over to some of those Islands,
let us (as it were on the shore) take view of this, so strong, so weak, so
constant, and so unconstant waterie Element. The Sea is great and wide, says
Psalm. 104.25- and 26.
the Psalmist: and at first covered the whole earth like a garment, till for
man's use Genesis 1.9.
the dry land appeared, which for man's abuse was again in the days of Noab
covered: And had not GOD Psalm. 104.9
set the Sea a bound which it cannot pass, it would return to cover the Earth
for ever. It is his Ferem. 5.22.
perpetual decree, who commanded, and it was made, that though the waves
thereofrage, yet they cannot prenaile; though they roar, yet they cannot pass
over. For how casie were it for the Sea ^o enclose the Earth in her watery
mantle, and again to make a conquest of the dry Land, having such forces of
her own, and such re-enforcements from the Air, and the Earth it self? Her
own powers, even by order of Nature and proportion of the Elements, cannot but
seem dreadful: in which, as the Air exceeds the Water, and is it self
exceeded of the Fire; so the Water may seem no less to surmount the Earth,
the lowest and least of the Elements. And what armies of exhalations does the
Sun daily muster in the great airy plain, which would succor their mother
in such an attempt? Besides that, even the Earth, as it is every where
compassed of the Sea, does compass in it self so many Seas, Lakes, Rivers, in
the uppermost face thereof, as professed partakers; and the inward bowels
thereof have daily intelligence, and continual conspiracy with the Waters, by
those secret pores and privy passages, whereby it comes to pass, that albeit
Eccles.1 7.
a^^ Rivers run to the Sea, yet the Sea is not filled. And were it possible
that so many Worlds of Waters should daily and hourly flow into this watery
World, and that such a World of time together, and yet the Sea nothing
increased, but that (as Solomon there says) The Rivers go to the place from
whence they return and go? that is, they run into the Sea, and thence,
partly by the Suns force, elevated and restored in raines, etc. partly by
filling the veincs of the Earth with Springs, do both ways return again in
Rivers to the Sea. This Vid. Zane. de Oper. and G P. B. Ret. ^^^ etc.
appears by the Dead Sea, and by the Caspian, which receive many Rivers
without open payment thereof to the Ocean: and at the straits of Gibraltar, the
Ocean commonly has a current in at one end, and the Euxine Sea at the other,
besides abundance of other waters out of Europe, Asia, Africa, and yet is no
fuller.

The depth of the Sea is holden by some to hold proportion to the height of the
Mountains on the Earth. The saltness of the Sea some ascribe to the first
Creation; some, to the Sweat of the Earth, roasted with the Sun; some, to the
saltness of the Earth, especially in Minerals of that nature; some, to adust
vapors, partly let fall on the Sea, partly raised from it to the brinkes and
face thereof; some, to the motion of the Sea; and some, to the working of the
Sun, which draws out the purer and finer parts, leaving the grosser and
baser behind: as in this little world of our bodies, the purest parts of our
nourishment being employed in, and on the body, the urine, and other
excrements remaining, do retain a saltness. I will not determine this
question, as neither that of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, which (
Apollonius Phil.l.5
some say) is the breath of the World; some, the waters in holes of the Earth,
forced out by Spirits; some, the meeting of the East and West Ocean: some
ascribe it to the Moon, naturally drawing water, as the Lodestone, Iron: some
to the variable light of the Moon. A variable light they all give us. They
that send us to GOD, and his Decree in Nature, have said what is the true
cause, but not how it is by natural means effected. Certain it is, that the
Ocean and the Moon are companions in their motion: uncertain, whether the
Ocean has a natural power in it self, or from the Moon, so to move. But
these things we leave to Philosophers searching wits, and better leysures. The
motion of the Sea is manifold; as first by ebbings and flowings, these also
differing, according to the course of the Moon, in Spring, or Nepe-tides, and
according to the distance, as they are nearer or further from the Ocean, and
according to the deepenesse or shallowness of the places, besides other
accidents, ouer-ruling them, making them, in diverse Seas, to be greater,
less, or none at all, longer also in some place, or oftener, as in Negropont,
where the water is said to rise and fall seven times a day. And besides these
hourly, daily, or monthly motions, another (more general) is ascribed unto
the Sea, from East to West, proceeding from the motion of the Heavens, which in
the openest Seas, as in the Atlantike and South Seas, are apparently manifest,
especially betwixt the Tropickes, where they find a constant Easterly breath;
uncertain whether it may be termed a wind, arising of inferior exhalations,
or some impetuous violence, caused by the superior motions, which draw
together with them the Elements, not of the Fire only, but also of Air and
Water. And hence are those strong Currents in diverse places, as that which
runs in at the great Bay, and out again with like force, between Cuba and
Florida, causing the Spaniards to go one way to the Indies, and to return
another. Other particular motions in the Sea, proceeding from especial
accidents of the Air by winds, which somewhere have their set seasons; of the
Sea by Whirle-pooles, and contrary currents: of the Land by Capes, Islands,
Indraughts, Rivers, and such like, it would be tedious to relate.

The Sea is commonly divided into the Mediterranean and Ocean: and under that
Mid-land appellation are contained all the Seas and Gulfes that are seated
within the Land, as the Arabian, Persian, Baltike, Bengalan, and especially
such as the Sea of Sodom and the Caspian, which have no apparent commerce with
the Ocean: but especially is that Sea called Mediterranean, which entering at
the Straits of Gibraltar, is both larger then any of the rest (containing,
above ten thousand miles in circuit) and abutteth not on one only, but on
all the parts of the elder World, washing indifferently the shores of Asia,
Afric, and Europe.

The Seas bear also the names of the Countries, Cities, Hills, Rivers, and
Lands, by which they pass, or of some other accident there happened; as the
Atlantike, or Germane Ocean, the Adriaticke, the Red, White, or Black Seas,
the Sea of Ladies, the Euxine by a contrary appellation, for their
inhospitalitie.

But to contract our speech unto Asia, we find the Sea prodigal of his best
things, and of himself unto it, clasping, with a lovely embrace, all this
Asian Continent, save where a little Neck of Land diuides it from Africa; and
no great space, together with Tanais, from Europe. Yea, as not herewith
satisfying his love to this Asian Nymph, in many places he insinuates himself
within the Land by Gulfes or Bays, twining his loving arms about some whole
Countries: otherwhere (as it were) by hostile underminings he makes Seas far
from the Sea; and especially has yielded so many Islands, as rather may seem
admirable then credible. For, to let pass the North parts (as not so well
known) where Vaygats, Nova Zemla, and the rest, would give us but cold
entertainment: Coming thence to the East and South, we are encountered with
the Island, or Of the Islands of Asia.
Islands rather, bearing the name of Iapan; the principal where of are three:
of which more afterward. These are seconded by the Islands of China, which do
(as it were) hedge and fence it in; of which, there is little in Authors
worthy mentioning. In Macao, or Amacan, the Portugalls have a Colonie, but the
chief Island of China is Anian, in the Gulf of Cauchin-China.

Further from the Continent, from Iapan Southwards, are many Islands, called by
the names of Lequi^, the greater, and the less, rich in Gold: nigh to the same
is Hermosa: and next to these the Philippinae, so called P. Bert^ tab.
of Philip the second, King of Spain, by whose charge and charges they were
discovered in the year 1564, long after that Magellanus had lost his life in
the discovery of these parts. Some make this name hold some proportion to the
Spanish ambition, calling all the Islands Philippinae, which are between New
Spain, and the Gulf of Bengala, in all, after their account, eleven thousand.
They begin their reckoning at Noua Guin^ae, where first we see Cainam. The next
Banda, which name is proper to an Island so called, and common also to her
neighbors, Rosolarguin, Ay, Rom, Neyra, in four degrees to the South, which
alone in the world are G. Bot.Ben.
said, by some, to bring forth Nutmegs and Mace. The men here are Merchants,
the women attend to Husbandry. The Islands del More abound with Rice and Sagu
(a fruit which yields Meal) where A. Pigafe^ta.
are wild Hens, which sit not on their eggs, but bury them a good depth
under the sand, where the Sun hatcheth them. They have no Kine, but a Fish of
like linea^^^, which they take in their Nets. Gilolo has a Mahumetane Prince,
and is a great Island; the people are Men-eaters. Amboino is the name of many
Islands, rude both in soil and people, which eat their own parents when they
are old. Near to these are the Moluccae, five in number, Ternate, Tidor,
Motir, Machian, and Bachian, famous through the world, as being Natures
Storehouse of Cloves. Their worship is directed to the Sun, Moon, and other
heavenly and earthly creatures. The Selebes.
Selebes abound with Gold, abandoned of goodness, peopleD with Idolaters and
Men-eaters. The Islands of Moratay.
Moratay are more Northerly, where Battata-rootes is their bread, their
neighbors fare in the Islands of Tarrao, Sanguin, Solor, and others.

In those Islands, which more properly bear the Philippine title, Mindano is,
of very large circuit, and has diverse famous Cities: Tendaia, for her
excellence, is by some called the Philippina. Luzzon incompasseth a thousand
miles, in which the Spaniards have built a Town, called Manilia, and have
thither carried Cattle for breed.

Borneo is reputed as big as Spain, richly attended with many Islands of
smaller circuit. It has a City of the same name, founded on Piles, in the
salt water, with sumptuous buildings of hewed Stone, covered with Coco leaves.
The King is a Mahumetan.

The greater Iaua is by Scaliger I. Scal.
called an Epitome, or Sum of the World; rich in many Commodities. The Cabal
is a wild Beast in this Island, whose bones do restrain the blood from
issuing in wounded parties. The South part is Gentiles, as the Countries within
the Land; but toward the shore they are Mahumetans. Touching the lesser Iaua,
there is some controversy which should be it.

Betwixt Malacca and Samatra Nature has (as it were) sowed that Field of
Waters with Islands; the principal of which is Bintam. Samatra, within the
Country, is Ethnikes: toward the Coast are Moors; an Island large, rich, and
populous, divided into many Kingdoms.

The Gulf of Bengala is (as it were) guarded with a double rank of Islands,
which Neptune has set as Garrisons of those Seas. But these ^ll are not worthy
the honor due to Zeilan, called in old times Taprobana. if they guess not
better which so call Samatra. From thence, along the Coast of India, are
seen few Islands of any greatness: But further into the Sea are the Maldiva,
so called of Maldiva, one of their number, whose name signifies a thousand
Islands; some of which are divided by larger Seas, some by smaller Arms; the
Ocean somewhere with his greatness threatening to swallow them, and in other
places as curious of his delightful search, stealing rather, then forcing a
separation, provoking the passengers to communicate in his sports; who
sometimes, helped with some ouer-growing Tree, can leap from one Island to
another. Yet has not Nature, thus diuersifying their situation, yielded them
diversity of her riches, saving that it seems here she has chosen her
chamber for the Palm, or Coquo- Nuts, which in other places she has, in
comparison, but scattered, here stored, that by this store the people might
supply all their other wants. Yea, besides the Land- Coquo, there grows
another under the water bigger then the former; a special Antidote for poison.
The inhabitants are addicted to subtletie and Sorcerie, and in the Islands next
to the Continent, Moors bear sway; in the rest, Pagans. Other Islands, of
smaller reckoning, we reckon not. Diu has long been famous for the wars
therein, vainly attempted by the Turk and Indians against the Fortress of
the Portugalls.

The Persian Gulf has left some remnants of Land extant; the chief is Ormus,
a famous Mart, which the Moors there maintained, under the government of a
Moore, after made tributarie to the Portugal; which Nature has made barren;
Industry, plentiful: the more fertile Element yields barrenness and Sands;
the barrenner brings in a double wealth, Pearls and Merchandise.

In the Discourse of these Asian Seas and this Persian, amongst the rest I
thought it worthy relating, which L. de Vrreta Hist. Ae ^^^
Luys de Vrreta, in his Ethiopian History tells of a certain Jew. He
traveling along the shore of this Persian Sea, by some In^^^ Arms thereof,
which embay themselves within the Land, saw the Sea lofty ^^^ swelling, by
force of the Winds and Tides, seeming to threaten the higher Elements, but even
now ready to swallow up the Earth, roaring out a loud defiance in such sort,
that the poor Jew was amazed, and dreadfully feared therewith: and this
continued the space of some days, whiles the Jew traveled thereby. But on the
Saturday and Sabbath, Superstition commanded the Jew; and Nature (the handmaid
of Divinity) enjoined the angry Elements to rest; a sudden calm followed, as
if waves and winds would accompany the Iewin his devotions, and had forgotten
their former fury and wonted nature, to remember the sanctification of this
day. The Jew having heard before, that there was a Sabbaticall R^^er (which
some place in Aethiopia, some in Phoenicia, others they cannot tell where) in a
credulous fancy persuades himself, that this Arm of the Sea was that
Sabbaticall stream, and that he now saw the experime^t of that relation with
his eyes. Fancy had no sooner affirmed, but superstition swear to the truth,
and credulity tickles him with gratulation of divine favor to himself, that
had lived to see that blessed sight. Ravished with this conceit, he filles his
budget full of the sand, which is of a more gross and cleaving nature, then in
other places, and carries it with him as a great treasure unto the place of
his habitation. There he tells his contrymen that now the Messiah would not
be long before he came, for now he had found this sign thereof, the
Sabbaticall River; showing this sand in proof thereof. Credit I^d^^us Apella,
the Jews believe quickly all but the truth, especially in Portugal, Some say
that the Jews were expelled out of Portugal before these ^^^
whither he came with this report. Many thousands moved by his words, removed
their dwellings, and selling their substance, would needs go into these parts
of Petsia, by the Sabbaticall River to fix their habitation; there waiting for
their promised Messi^^^ One, and a chief of this superstitious Expedition, was
Amanes L^^^^^^, a Physician of great note, accounted one of the most learned of
his profession, and a writer therein; and John Micas, a Merchant of great
wealth. They passed through France, Germany, Hungary, their company (like a
snow-ball) increasing as they went, with the addition of other Jews of like
credulity. When they came to Constantinople, there were of them in many bands
or companies thirty thousand, ^^^^^ ^^^^^^, the Turkish Commander, thought to
gain by this occasion; and would not suffer them to pass over the water into
Asia, without many hundred thousands of ducats, except they would pass on
horseback. This example was soon both spread and followed of the other
Bassaes and Commanders in Asia, as they went; their wealth and substance being
every where so fleeced, that they came into Syria, much lessened in numbers, in
estate miserable and beggarly; new Officers every where, as new hungry Flies,
lighting on these wretched carcasses (so I may call them:) some they whipped,
some they empaled, some they hanged, and burned others. Thus were these
miserable Pilgrims wasted: and Don John Baltasar was present, when Amat^
aforesaid being dead with this affliction, his Physicke-bookes were at an
Outcry to be sold at Damasco, and because they were in Latiue, no man would
buy them, till at last another Jew became Chapman. Micas, one of the wealthiest
men which Europe held, died poor in an Hospital at Constantinople. And this
was the issue of their Pilgrimage to the Sabbaticall Stream, which they
supposed to find in this Persian Gulf; where we have too long holden you the
spectator^ of this Jewish Tragedy.

The Red Sea, or Arabia, Gulf, seemed unwilling to be the Oceans subject: so
many small Islands does she continually muster in resistance, besides her
undermining the Sea with her shallow Channel, conspiring the destruction of
many heedlesse Mariners, that here will adventure as tenants to the Sea in
their moving houses. Once (by a mightier hand) was it helped to prevail
against the Seas force, to discover ^^^ dry Land in the midst thereof, and
with her waterie erected walls to guard these new passengers, till the same
hand reuersed it, orrather rewarded the then empty belly thereof with the
prey of so many thousand Egyptians. Babelmandel, Camaran, and Mazva are
accounted amongst the chief of these Isolets: ^^chen has most Soueraignetie;
being the Seat of the Turkish Bassa for Abassia.

Socotera is without the Strait. The naturals are Christians, of S. Thomas S^^^
who is here said to have suffered shipwreck, and of whose broken ship was
erected a Church. They are great warriors, both men and women, and great
Magicians. They have no use of Traffic, Letters, or Navigations, and yet are
esteemed the noblest people in the world.

(Two Gio. Bol.Ben.
other Islands confront this; of which one (they say) is the habitation of men,
and the other of women, which sometimes have intercourse one with the other,
but the Air (Natures inexorable and heavy handmaid) not suffering any long
abode to each, but in their own allotted portion.

Loath am I to look any further into that boisterous Sea, and therefore leaving
all that huge Tract of Afric, as compassed by a sudden thought, but
unsaluted, we shall find other Asian Islands in the Mediterranean. And
because, being now wearied, the Archipelago would be too tedious a passage for
us, neither are there many Islands worth naming in Propo^tis, or the E^xin^, we
will speak a little of Rhodes and Cyprus, and then remember how long we have
forgotten ourselves.

The former of those contains about an hundred and twenty miles: fertile in
soil, and of most pleasant air, caused by that love which Phoebus bears to
it; there never passing day, in which he does not, in his bright and shining
apparel, salute it. And for this cause happily was that huge Colossus of
Brass (gilded over, and reputed the most wonderful of the Worlds seven
Wonders) here dedicated to the Sun (though some ascribe it to Jupiter.) the
workmanship of Chares Lindi^^, of threescore and ten cubits, ^^or as others
tell, a hundred forty three feet, This inscription was in the basis as
Meursius translates it: Rbodo colossum ^^^ quater cubi^s december Superbientem
Lindius ^ee it Laches which words show both the author Lindius ^^^ and the
height so, ^^^ bites Meursius in trans^^t. Constant.
but it self told fourscore cubits in height, which, falling by an
Earthquake, the Oracle forbad the Rhodians to erect again. But nothing forbad
Mabias, or Mu^^^ the fifth Caliph, after his seven years War about
Constantinople (as says Constant. Porphyroge^itus de ^d imp ^^^, Theophanis
Chronicon.
Constantinus out of Theophanes) inuading this Island, to carry away nine

The Temple of Liber was here enriched with many presents of the Greeks and
Romans, to both which the City of Rhodes was had in friendly and honorable
regard. Much was their force by Sea in ancient times, and for two hundred
years space it was the Seat of the Hospitular-Knights, which now reside in
Malta; driven thence by mighty Solomon.

These Knights had also, by purchase of King Richard the first of England, the
Island of Cyprus, Adrian. Roman. Theat. Vrbium, l.2.
dedicated by the Poets to Venus, to whom the inhabitants were too much
addicted, as appeared by their Temples and other vanities in her honor. At
Paphos she was worshipped in the likeness of a Navel; and round thereabouts
(by the Devils working) it rained not. Trogus writes, That the Cyprians
prostituted their daughters (before they married them) to Mariners on the
shore. We have seen at Rome (says R. Vol^teranus) the attendants of Queen
Carlotta, never a whit better then those ancient.

Of Cyprus thus reports Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. 4. It is ennobled by two
Cities, Salamis, and Paphus; the one famous for Jupiters Images; the other, for
the Temple of Venus. It is so plentiful in all things, that it needs no
help of other Nations, and of her own abundance is able to set forth a
Ship, from the Keele to the Toppe-sayle, with all provision, furnished to the
Sea. Neither grieve I to tell it; the Romans more greedily then justly made
themselves Lords thereof. For Ptolomey the King being confederate with us, was
proscribed without any fault, but the defect of our Treasury, who therefore
poisoned himself, and the Isle became Tributarie. Sextus Rufus faith as much.
Amasis was the first, if we believe H^rodotus, Herod. Thalia.
, that ever conquered Cyprus, and made it. Tributarie. He also says (Lib. 7.)
That the Cyprians were partly from Salamine and Athens, partly from Arcadia,
partly from Cythnus, from Phoenicia, and from Aethyopia. Pli^ie affirms Plin.
1.5.c.31.
, That it was sometime the Seat of nine Kings, and was diversely named, as

In the time of Constantine it was forsaken of the inhabitants, as before
forsaken of the Elements, which refused to water with any drops of rain that
Island (sometime accounted happy) the space of seventeen years together, or
as others have it, six and thirty, re-peopled from diverse parts by Helena,
the mother of Constantine Quadi Geographia.

foundation. In Hak.voyages the taking of Famagusta, etc. is largely related,

For whereas their holy Laws will not suffer any thing to be dedicated to holy
uses, which their own Sword has not conquered, he brake League with the
Venetian, and robbed them of this Island, which they are thought, not with the
iustest title, before to have possessed. But it is high time to bethink us of
our Indian shore, whence we have taken so large a prospect; where we are
stayed to be transported into the chief of those Islands, there to take a more
leisurely view of their Regions and Religions.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of the Islands of Iapon, and their Religions.

THe Jesuits have not more fixed the eyes of the World upon them in the
Western parts, then they have fixed their own eyes on the Eastern; here
seeking to repair, with their vtempered Mortar, the ruins of their Falling
Babylon: there laying a new foundation of their after-hopes: here, by their
Politic Mysteries and Mystical Policies, endeavoring to recover; there, by
new Conquests to make supply to their losses: here, for busy intruding into
affairs of State, suspected by their own, hated by their adversaries; there,
by seeming to neglect Greatness, and to contemn Riches, of the mightiest are
not feared, while others believe, observe, and admire them.

Both here and there they spare not to Mat. 23.15.
compass Sea and Land, to win Proselytes; every of their Residences, or
Colleges, being as so many Forts to establish this new Roman Monarchy, but
with unlike advantage, encountering there with Reason (or rather with the
carcass of Reason) attended with Ignorance and Superstition, whose Owlish eyes
cannot endure the enterview of Truth, though darkened with those Clouds,
wherewith they ouer-cast it: Here with Truth, yea, the Soul of Truth, true
Religion; whose Shield of Faith; and Sword of the Spirit, these (the stronger
part of those strongest Gates of Hell) cannot prevail against. A Spanish
Faction of Spanish humor and success, more easily conquering a world of the
naked Americanes, and esseminate Indians, then keeping all they had in Europe.
Such are the arms of the one, and the preaching of the other.

Yet would I feign be thankful to the one and the other Benefit by the
Spaniard and Jesuit.
, the first for furthering Geographie with knowledge of a new world; the other,
for making a possibility of a better world to some, whereas otherwise there
was a general desperation of all.

Neither are the wounds of Popish superstition so absolutely mortal, as the
Ethnike Atheism; the one having no foundation at all; the other showing the
true foundation: although their Babylonish slime even here supplieth the room
of better matter, besides their stubble, hay and wood built upon it. Better a
mixed Truth, then a total error: and a maimed CHRIST, then none at all. But
howsoever they be beholden to them for their Divinity, it were inhumanity in
us, not to acknowledge a beholdingness to them, for that they give us in the
knowledge of many peoples, although in all their Discourses this caution is
necessary, not to yield them a Catholic and universal credit, where we any
way may spy them dawbing the walls of their pretended Catholic Church. In
relating their Miracles, and such like, we will remember they are Jesuits: in
other things not serviceable to Rome, we will hear them as Travelers, when
lying does not advantage them, nor hurt us. But as the Labors of the Jesuits
may every where breed shame to our negligence in a better quarrel: so in
Iapon it is most of all admirable, that the furthest part of the World should
be so near to their industry. And that you may at last be acquainted with
Iapon, we will borrow of them to pay your hopes, by their long introduction
suspended.

Maffaus (who has translated and set forth more then thirty of those Iaponian
Epistles) in the twelfth Book of his Indian History, does thus describe it.
Besides other less, three principal Islands bear the name of Iapon; which
the Mer^ator thinks Iapan to b^ he Aure^ ^^^ which agrees not with
Ptolomey.l.7.c.2. who places it under the Line.
first and greate^t most peculiarly challenges, contains in it three and
fift^^ Kingdoms or Principalities, the chief City whereof is Meaco: The
second is X^m^m, divided into nine Seg^iories: The third, Xicoc, quartered into
four Lordships, so that there are in all of this Iaponian Dominion, threescore
and six Shires, of petty Kingdoms. The space of land is measured two hundred
leagues in length, in breadth somewhere ten, in other places thirty, between
the thirty and thirty eight degrees of Northerly Latitude: Eastward from China.
The soil is not very fertile, subject to much snow, the air^ wholesome. The
bowels of the earth are stored with diverse metals; the trees are fruitful,
and one A strange Tree.
wonderful, in that it abhors moisture, and if happily it be moistened, it
sh^aketh and becomes withered: which they remedy by plucking it up by the
roots, and after it is dried in the Sun, to set it in dry sand; if a bough be
broken off and nailed on again, it grows. They have two high mountains, one
of which casts forth flames, and in the top thereof the diuellvseth to show
himself in a bright cloud ^^o some, that (by long fasting) have prepared
themselves to this sight: the other, called Figeniana, is by some leagues
higher then the clouds. They much esteem a tall personablenesse: they pluck
off the hairs on their head: children before; the common people half way; the
Nobility almost all) leaving but a little growing behind: to touch which were
to offer great indignity to a man. They can endure much hardship: an infant
newborn in the coldest of winter is presently carried to the River to be
washed: their education is hard: yet are they neat: they use forkes (as the
Chinois) or sticks, not touching the meat with their fingers, and therefore
need no naperie: they sit on carpets, and enter the rooms unshod, their
tables are a hand high, some eighteen inches square, curiously wrought, to
each guest one, and changed at every new service or change of meat,
Quabacondonus, against a solemn and festival entertainment of his Father,
prepared a hundred and thirty thousand of these tablets. Their houses are most
of wood, because of often Earthquakes: and some of Stone. Temples and
Monasteries they have for both Sexes: and more had, till Nubunanga destroyed
them. Their language is one, and yet exceedingly diuersified according as they
differ in State or Sex: or as they speak in praise or dispraise, using a
diverse Idiom. They use Characters in writing and printing, as in China. Their
swords are of a most excellent temper. Their customs differ in many things
from other men. Customs in things indifferent are comely or uncomely, pro more
loci.
Black is a festival color, white a Funeral: their meats, drinks,
perfumes, are as dissonant to ours. Their teeth are colored with black, as
beauties livery borrowed of Art, which we by Art would avoid. They mount on
the right side of the Horse. They sit, (as we rise) to entertain a friend.
They give to the sick persons, salt things, sharp, and raw: never let blood:
we contrary (as in other rites) either to other ridiculous. All their Nobles
are called Toni: amongst whom are diverse degrees: all of them holding their all
in capite, to find so many Soldiers to the Wars, at their own costs.
Genenerally the whole Nation is witty: poverty is a disgrace to no man.
Reproaches, Thefts, periuri^s, Dice-play are hateful: very ambitious they are
in all things, respective to their credit, full of courtesy each to other,
never bralling, no not at home with their houshoulds. The Inconstancy of that
State learneth them by use to prepare for, and to welcome, every State. They
are exceedingly subtle, hypopocriticall and double-dealing: they are also of
cruel disposition, not to their enemies alone, but sometimes will assay the
goodness of their blade and strength of their arm, on some innocent body;
and in case of distress, they esteem it a credit to prevent the sentence of
law by bloody execution done on themselves, which they usually do in ripping
up their breasts a cross, a servant or friend attending to smite off his
head: and if it be a man of any sort, his friends and followers in like manner
with their own hands pluck out their bowels to testify their love. The
Governors have absolute rule over their inferiors: yea, in every private
Family the authority extends to life or death. All ^apon sometime obeyed one
Prince called Vo, or Dairi, who at length addicting himself to his private
delights, and putting off the burden of ruling to his officers, grew in
contempt: and at last every one ^e^^ed on his own province, whereof you have
heard there are threescore and six, Leaving the Dairi a bare title, and a
Heralds Kingdom to give terms of honor at his pleasure, whence he raises
great revenue, otherwise subject (excepting his Title) as are all the rest, to
the Lord of Tensa (so they call the noblest Kingdom adioining to Meaco) This
Cos. Tur^ian.
Vo or Dairi descends by succession from the ancient Kings, out of which he
is chosen, and is honored as a God. He may not touch the ground with his
foot, which if he do^, he is put by the place: never goes out of his house,
seldom is seen of the people. He fitteth in his seat with a bow and arrows
on one hand of him, on the other a Dagger. If he should kill any, or if he
show himself an enemy to peace, he is deprived as well as if he had trodden on
the ground. All great men have their factors with him to procure new titles of
honor, the only fuel of his greatness.

They have another general officer or chief Justice, which denounces War,
and in peace, gives sentence on matters in controversy. But these are but the
instruments of the Lords of Tensa, as are also the Bonzij. These are their
Religious, among whom one is supreme in cases spiritual, by whom all their old
holies are ordered, and all new are confirmed or dashed. The Tundi, (which are
as their Bishops) are by him consecrated and confirmed, although their
nomination be by lay patrons. He dispenses with them in diverse privileges and
immunities: he inioyeth great revenue and soueraintie, and is advanced hereto
by money and kindred. The Tundi give Priestly orders, and dispense in smaller
matters, as eating flesh on days prohibited.

They have many Sects, some reckon them twelve; all truly agreeing, in
disagreeing with Truth: some of them Epicure-like denying Gods providence, and
the souls immortality. They hold that a man has three souls, which one
after another come into, and depart out of the body. Few of their Bonzij will
openly teach this Doctrine, but labor to hold the people in awe. Amida and
Xaca they preach, as Saviors, and to be worshipped. Some of their Sects do
believe an eternal life, and promise it to all such as call upon these
supposed Deities, as Saints which sometime ledd so austere a life, for the
sins of mankind, that for a man to vex his mind, or macerate his body for
his own sins, would not only be superstitious, but offensive and
derogatorie to their merits. And here the kinde-hearted Jesuit Maffaeus.
, is panged with a fit of Charity to yoke the Lutherans with them; as if the
sufferings of JESUS were but the superstitions of Amida, as if either the
sufferings of man, imperfect, borrowed, duty, could be, or the sufferings of
God could not be meritorious; or as if the I utherans denied Christian
contrition (whose affect is Indignation, 2. Cor. 7.11.
effect (selfe-reuenge) as they do Popish confession and satisfaction. These
Gods they call Fotoques. Other Gods of a less mould they call Camis, which
have their charges and peculiar offices, for health, children, riches, etc. as
among the elder (that I trouble not the queasie stomachs of the later) Romans.

These were Kings and Noblemen, or Inuenters of Arts, of whom they have as
true tales as Homer or the Legend yields. Taicosama that died An. Dom. 1598

a few years since, (the first which in these many later ages took the Title
of a King, which, together with the crown, he received of the King of China)
ordained before his death, that his body should not be burned after the wonted
manner, but closed in a Chest, and, in a sumptuous temple for that purpose
built Al. Valignam.
his image should be enshrined and worshipped with the Title of Scinfaciman, or
New Faciman, the name of their Mars or warlike God: which was also done. Thus
he, which in his youth had used to cut wood and carry it into the Market to
sell for his daily fustenance, for his valor promoted in military honors, at
last became the greatest Monarch that Iapon had seen in eight hundred years,
and not contented with humane greatness, would aspire to that divine, whereof
he himself had been a derider in others. His name before was Faxiba, called
after, Quabacondonus, the highest Title next to the Dairi, and signifies the
chief of the treasure: next borrowing a kingly Style from China, would (mad
folly) on his deathbed bequeath Godhead to a man, and immortality to a
carcass: when he could no longer hold out his pride, cruelty, and other
wicked courses, which made his presence dreadful, his memory detestable.
Nabumanga was his predecessor in his state and impiety, arrogating divine
honor to himself L. Frois.
but destroying the Temples of their Gods, together with their Temple-keepers,
the Bonzij. This appeared at Frenoiama, a famous University of those Bonzij,
nine miles from M^aco, wherein eight hundred years past, a Iaponian King had
erected three thousand and eight hundred Temples, with houses adioined for the
Bonzij: allowing to their maintenance the third part of the revenue of the
Kingdom of Vomen. Hence proceeded their orders and government in affairs
both of state and Religion, being a Seminary of Laws and Superstitions. But
these temples in time diminished to eight hundred, and the Bonzian discipline
as much ^mpatred, and altered from austeritie (in some) to wantonness, (in
others) from Arts, to Arms. The Bonzii took part with Nechien, enemy of
Nabunanga, who enraged hereat made truce with the one, to destroy the other.
The Bonzij not prevailing by their suing for peace, fortified themselves for
War in the Temple of Quanon their God of health and long life, much
frequented with Pilgrims from all parts; much solemnized with their pompous
processions (like in all parts if ye believe the Jesuit to their
Corpus-Christi-solemnitie) which grew the more famous for that these were but
the preamble to the like pomp in the Gibon-Feastiuall at Meaco. But all
prevailed not with Nabunanga, who destroyed both Temple and Priests with fire
and sword, burning four hundred other temples for company, in the year 1572.
At Meaco he burned twenty of these Bonzian Cloisters of the greater sort,
besides fourscore less, and in one of them threescore Bonzian women or Nuns,
whose Devotion was employed in begging for the reparation of the Temple of
Daibud. Amongst the rest, as the Grecians had their Mercury with his Caduceus,
so the Iaponians have their I^za with his Trident, to convey souls departed
into their allotted eternal residences: The Bonzij his Chapleines by lots
enquired whither they should remove him, he commanded it, and they with great
solemnity performed it, but out of a place, which then escaped, to another Out
of the Drying Pan into the fire.
wherein, and where with he was burnt. Facusangin was another Bonzian Academy
adorned with many Colleges which he destroyed. Xinguen the King of Cainochun
shaued his head and beard: and professed himself a Bonzi, and not only attired
himself in their habit, but thrice a day did perform their superstitions,
having six hundred Bonzij to his followers. He writ to Nabunanga, intitling
himself the Patron of those Religions: the other in his answer styled
himself the Tamer of Devils, and enemy of Sects. But after that he would be
a God, soon did he cease to be a man; the immortal God, hating corriuals, by
his own subjects destroyed his life, riches, and memory. These Bonzij are for
the most part gentlemen whom their Parents (having many children) for want of
maintenance thrust into Cloisters; Shaven (as you have heard) and Shauers
couetously pilling and polling the people of their money by many devises, as by
selling them scrolles to keep them (by the Devil) from hurt of Devils after
death: borrowing of money here, Bal. Gag^s.
to repay with great interest in the Future world; giving the Creditor a bill
or scroll of their hands for security: by telling of things stolen or lost,
(which they do by Enchantments calling a Devil into a Child, who being so
possessed, answers their questions) by selling their blessings, and curses
like Balaam. Some by vow (the most) live unmarried: as the Bonzian women.

Another Sect, called Ianambuxos, before their admission into that order live
two thousand or more together on a high mountain, for the space of threescore
days macerating themselves with selfe-inflicted penance; the Devil in diverse
shapes meanewhile appearing to them, and after this they are received into that
damnable fellowship, distinguished by white stocks hanging down their necks,
curled hair, and black hats, and so wander from place to place, giving notice
of their coming by a little Bell. Another Sect called Genguis dwell on some
high Hill, black of complexion, and (as is supposed) horned, marry wives of
their own kindred, pass over great rivers by the devils help; who on a
certain hill at times appointed appears to them; of whom by the name of Amida
he is worshipped. In another hill he was wont to appear to his deuoutest
followers, whom then he would lead as they thought to Paradise, indeed to
destruction, they say that a son, not able to persuade his father from this
passage to Paradise, secretly followed him with his bow and arrows, and when
the Devil appeared shot and wounded a Fox, whom he followed by the blood to
a lake wherein he found many dead men's bones. They have another University in
Iapon called Coia, whose Bonzian students are of the Sect of Combendaxis,
supposed the Inuenter of the Iaponian Letters. He in his old age dug a
foure-square Cave, into which he conuayed himself, affirming that he then died
not, but after some millions of years would return in the days of one
Mirozu, which then should be a most worthy King in Iapon. About his sepulcher
burn many Lamps sent thither from diverse Nations, with opinion that such as
enrich that monument shall themselves here be enriched, and in the other life
by Combendaxis patronised. In the Colleges here live six thousand of those
Shauelings: from whom women are restrained upon pain of death. At

trained up witty and proper youths in all tricks of subtlety and guile,
acquainting them with Genealogies of Princes that so they might counterfeit to
be the sons of such or such great men, and borrowing money on that credit
might enrich their wicked College: till the slight being found, they were
killed of the inhabitants.

There be that worship the Sun and Moon, who have an Image with three heads,
which (they say) is the virtue of the Sun, Moon and Elements. Cos.Tur.
These worship the Devil, in visible shape appearing to them, with many and
costly Sacrifices.

Some hold Xacas book in such Veneration, that without it they hold it
impossible to be saved. Other Bonzij have been in other ages in high
reputation of holiness, but Caspar.Vilela.

Icoxos: the ruler or General of which Sect is openly wicked, but so adored of
the people, that if he but look on them they will salute him with tears of
joy, praying him that all their sins may be pardoned, and therewith give him
no small quantity of their Gold. His yearly festival is so honored with
thronging of the people, that in the entry of the Cloister many are trodden
under foot, which yet is of the blind people accounted a happiness, many
willingly yielding themselves to be killed in that press. And in the night,
whiles his praises are sung, there is a great howling and lamentation. Nequiron
was Author of the Sect F^quexan. But of other their superstitions you shall
hear more in the next Chapter.

CHAP. XV.
A Continuation of the former Discourse touching the Religions of Iapon.

MEaco their chief City is chief also in superstitions, having had (if
report lie not) on the hill near to it seven thousand Cloisters or Abbeys: one
of which is so famous, that the Kings in their Wars will vow great sums of
Gold, and after victory pay the same there: the people also in distress make
it their sanctuary, where the Devil by visions deludeth them. In August they
celebrate the Feast of Gibon with Pageants: fifteen or sixteen Chariots,
covered with silk go before, in them are children with Minstralsie. Every
Chariot is drawn with thirty or forty men, and followed by their peculiar
companies or trades: and after them Chariots of men armed, which all pass by
the Temple in the morning. In the Evening, two litters come forth, carried by
men; the one of the God, the other of his Lemman: then follows the third: of
his Wife, with which the men run up and down in such a confused manner, as
may signify her jealousy. Here the people weep and pray to their Goddess,
whom yet with a contrary devotion they comfort: and lastly (as if by the
peoples mediation) the Litters are joined together, and carried into the
Temple. In the same month they have their Feast of All souls, in which they
light many Lamps, at their doors, and all night walk up and down the City:
and many suppose at a certain place they meet with the walking Ghosts of
their decta^ed friends, and after welcoming ceremonies, they set vittailes
Baits in the journey to Paradise.
before them, at least in that place, where having a while attended they inuit
them to their houses. The reason of this refreshing they allege the long
journey to Paradise, which in less then three years space cannot be passed,
and therefore they have need of heartning. Two dales this Feast lasts, in
which they cleanse their graves and give presents to the Bonzii, In March they
have festival plays, in which many mere in the afternoon painted with the
Images of their Gods on their shoulders: and parting themselves into two
ranks, the boys begin with stones, the men continue the fray with arrows,
poles, and swords, always with the death of some, and impunitie of the doers.

At Sacai in July they keep the Feast of Daimaogin, to whom many Temples are
dedicated: in which the Idol is carried with much pomp on horseback,
followed first by the Bonzij, then the Nobility, after them certain Witches,
whom armed troops of soldiers follow. Then comes the Litter of the God,
all gilded, carried by twenty men, answering each other in certain hymns; the
people worshipping.

Some of their Bonzii profess a military discipline, as the Knights of Malta.
The profession called Neugori was instituted by Cacuban (who is therefore
deified) in which some intend their prayers, whiles other fight, and others
perform their task of making five arrows a day. Their government is an
Anarchy; every one obeying and commanding, the meanest person amongst them
having a Negative in all their consultations: And nothing is agreed on till all
be agreed. In the night they often kill one another without remorse, and yet
(such is their religion) this Sect holds it a sin to kill a fly or any
living thing.

They believe diverse Paradises, into each of which their peculiar Gods carry
their own worshippers: And some make ouer-hastie iourneyes thither on this
sort. He watches certain days, and then out of a Pulpit preaches of the
contempt of the world. Others betake them to be his companions, while some
give their alms. On the last day he makes an Oration to his fellows, who
all drinking Wine go into their Ship, carrying a sith to cut up all the
brambles in their way; and putting on their clothes, stufte their sleeves with
stones, and hanging a great stone about their necks to help them the sooner
to their Paradise, hurl themselves into the Sea. And great honor is done to
them being thus dead. I saw one (says Vilela) that had seven of these
companions, which with their great alacrity, and my great amazement, did this.
But they which worship Amida, observe another rite. Being weary of living, they
put themselves in a strait hole of the earth receiving breath only by a Reed,
and so continue fasting and praying till death. Some of them in honor of a
certain Idol do cast themselves down from a high Tower, where this Idol is
placed, and after their death are reputed Saints.

Others Pet Alca^^^^

tells of a strange Confession which is observed in this order. There are
(says he) in Ocaca very high and steep Rocks, which have pikes or points on
them above two hundred fadome high. One of which, higher and more terrible then
the rest, daunteth and terrifieth the Xa^abusis (which be Pilgrims) to look up
unto it: upon the top of the point there is a great rod of Iron of three
fadome long, placed there by a strange devise: at the end of this rod is a
balance tied, whereof the scales are so big, as a man may sit in one of
them. And the Goquis (which be Devils in humane shape) command those pilgrims
to enter therein, one after another, not leaving one of them. All this is
represented to the eye in pictures by Theodor^^ de Bry.America part ^.
Then with an Engine or Instrument, which moves by means of a wheel, they
make this rod of Iron to hang in the air; one of the Xamabusis being set in
one of the scales, which (because there is no counterpoise in the other scale)
presently hangs down, and the empty one rises to touch the rod aforesaid,
whereupon the balance hangs. Then the Goquis tells the poor Pilgrim that
he must confess all the sins that he can remember with a loud voice, that
all may hear: Which he presently does, some of the hearers laughing, some
sighing. At every sin mentioned, the other scale falls a little, till that
having told all, it remains equal with the other, wherein the sorrowful
penitent sits. Then the Goquis turns the wheel, and draws the rod and
balance unto him, and the Pilgrim comes forth, and another enters till all
have passed. If any concealed any sin, the empty scale yielded not, and if
when he was urged to confess, he grew obstinate, the Goquis cast him down
from the top, where in an instant he is broken into a thousand pieces. A
Iaponian who had seven times made trial hereof, being converted to
Christianity reported this. But the terror was such (said he) that few would
conceal any thing. The place hereof is called Sangenotocoro, that is, the
place of confession. Thus, much Acosta, whom as I thank for the Story, so I
would a little trouble (for he would more partiently hear and bear, then
some of his hotter brethren) with a question concerning confession. And if the
question come too late, yet the Society lives (and will longer then a better
thing:) into a College of whom Iapon has brought us, as their names here
testify. The question is, whether every residence of the Jesuits be not a
Sangenotocoro of Ocaca, that is a place of confession (so does Sangenotocoro
signify) of which we may exclaim (...) and if you will (...) the one for the
cruel terror where with it fills the Conscience, and the later for the
fleshly filthiness wherein Ocaca is not blamed, but their Our Chaucer in the
Friars prologue. Cor. Agrippa de vanit.c.64. and many of the Papists themselves

whole volumes for the proof hereof, yet would I rather choose to enter the
Sangenotocoro-scale; then your Confession-schoole. Easy it may be indeed to
seared Jesuitical Consciences that account Treason Religion, yea pleasant and
delightful to such Statists to have Kings upon the knees of their bodies, to
pour out before them the secrets of their souls, and (they are wiser then
Solomon Proverb. 25.3^
which esteemed it impossible) to search out the Kings heart. But to such as
have business enough to know and rule themselves, and do indeed make
Conscience of every duty, what intolerable anguish is here prepared? when my
heart, besides that it is wicked and deceitful above all, who can search it?
is like an untamed heifer, who can rule it? Had I not need always to have a

as an argument of the divine Institution thereof. It is so difficult (says
he) that no power of man or the Church could have imposed it, and therefore it
was divine. I will not say, who instituted the balance of Ocaca, and yet it
was a hard thing, and never the like heard of; I say, that the Gospel imposes
not such hard things (this were to bring us back to the Law) but prescribes

such as like and delight in it. But this, even to those that dote upon it, and
deuote themselves to it, is not only hard, but altogether impossible: Witness
Bellarmine himself, Quid enim mosestius, quid onerosius, quam vt cogantur

sunt, peccata sua omnia detegere, quamuis arcana, quamuis turpia, etc. Witness

as have tried it more nearly then Bellarmines Controversies would give him
leisure, yet living in continual disquietnes, and torment of their
Consciences, in the use of their sacrament of Confession, receiving no rest day
nor night, as serving Gods, who can not give it them. These are the words of
Sheldon (happily brought out of that darkness, wherein, and whereof he was a
Priest and Minister, to a clearer light) who out of his own knowledge adds;
That it is not imaginable what inconsolable lives, some, that are frequent in
the use of Confession (as necessary to salvation) do lead: there is no stony
heart which would not pity them, knowing their torments.

But lest any man think, that some Goquis has hurled me out of the seat of
my history, to fall and split my self upon these Jesuitical rocks, I will
return to our narration of the Iaponites. Diverse of them before their Images
in desperate distress disembowell themselves in that bloody manner before
mentioned.

thousand, betook them to their heels. But Amida is most worn in their
lips; beggars asking and blessing in his name; chapmen in buying and selling
sounding and singing it: the Bonzij promising salvation to all that inuoke it.
Admirable are the Temples L. Frois.

forty else in length, with a huge Image of Amida, having thirty Images about
it of soldiers, besides Ethiopians and Devils, yea winds and thunders
figured, and a thousand Images of Canon (on each side of the Temple five
hundred) all in like, but monstrous shape, with thirty arms, two only holding
proportion to his body, the breast adorned with seven faces; all the Images and
other furniture so glittering with gold, that it dazeleth the beholders eyes.
One Temple is dedicated just by to a Lizard, (which they make Author and Patron
of learning) without Altar or Image in it. He that reads of the huge works
of Taicosama, holding sometime a hundred thousand workmen in labor at once,
may present to his imagination the incredible buildings which those tyrants, by
so many slavish hands, can raise.

They are very curious and ambitious in setting forth their funerals; a matter
of no small consequence to the covetous Bonzij, who follow the corpse, if the
party were rich, sometime two hundred in a company singing the praises of that
GOD which the deceased had most worshipped, beating a basen instead of a Bell,
till they come to the fire, where so many rites are performed. I should do you

to relate them, having been redious in the rest. Only after so much
wickedness of men, let us add somewhat of the admirable works of GOD in
Iapon.

On the two and twenty day of July in the year 1596. it rained ashes round
about Meaco, covering the ground as if it had been snow. Soon after it rained
both there and in other places, as it had been women's hair. And not long
after followed an Earthquake that hurled down Temples and Palaces, which with
their ruins destroyed thousands: six hundred gilded images in the temple of
Ianzusangue were cast down, and broken in pieces, as many remaining whole. It
brought up the Sea a great way upon the maine land, which is carried back with
it into the Sea, not leaving mention that there had been land. So was the
City Ochinofama swallowed, Famaoqui, Ecuro, Fingo, Cascicanaro, the
neighbor-towns, attended her in this new voyage, and became Sea. The ships
in the haven found no more security, but were also devoured. The like happened
in the year of our LORD 1586. to Nagafama, a place frequented with merchants,
which the Sea before had enriched, then with an Earthquake devoured, the earth
in many places opening such wide mouths, that a ealliuer-shot could scarce
reach from the one side to the other, bleching out of that yawning passage such
a ^^in^e, as none were able to pa^e ^y. ^^^ only shook with sear, but
bellowed out such roaring cries under that blow of their Creators hands, as did
make the accident more dreadful. Yet was all ^^^ forgotten, and Taicosama fell
to building of new Palaces.

He that lists further to be acquainted with Iaponian affairs, may resort to
the Epistles of the Jesuits, which, besides these I have named, are many: and
of that society are not many lesle then two hundred in this Island
Gab.Matasus.1603.Eman.A^os^a.
, which also is now become an Episcopal Sea. The first of them was Xauier, one
of Ignatius first companions, and like to have been canonized before him too.
But the first finding of this Island is by Galvanus ascribed to Anthony Mota and
his fellows 1542. But before these M. Polo writes of this Island, which he
calls Zepangu M.Pol.li.3.
whither Cubla^ the great Tartarian Can in the year 1264. sent two Captains
to conquer the Island. The winds (as angry with the Tartarians, and taking part
with the Ilanders) raised so stormy a Sea, that (when there were now thirty
thousand of their company landed in a little Island) they were forced to put off
to Sea, and scattered with tempests. The Ilanders set forth a navy to take
those Tartarians, which so confusedly ordered that enterprise, that the
Tartarians found means to make themselves masters of their enemies navy, and
therewith to sail away. Marcus Paulus reports like things of their
idolatrous Religion, as you have heard: of Idols with heads of Oxen, Hogs, and
Dogs, and other deformed shapes: and some with many hands, as a testimony of
their great power. The enemies which they took in war, not able to redeem
themselves, he says they did eat in solemn Feasts: He adds, that in the
Iaponian language Mangi was called Cin: as now it is Cina or China.

I have presumed to add a piece of a Letter of Quabacondonus to the Viceroy of
India, which after other things has these words. Iapon is the kingdom of
Chamis, whom we esteem to be the same with Scin, which is the beginning of all
things. This Scin is the substance and very being of all things: and all things
are one and the same with Scin, and into Scin are resolved, which in Scina is
called Iutto; and in Tescincu, Buppo. In the observation of the Laws of this
Chamis, consists all the politic government of Iapon, both inward and
outward, etc.

The king Hen.Cuyckius
of Bungo, Arima, and Omur sent their Ambassadors to the Pope (then Gregory
the thirteenth) with Letters of their devotion to his Holiness, and had
audience in the Consistory the three and twentieth day of March Anne 1585.
This was the Jesuits policy (says Linsc.li.i.c.26
Linschoten) to make the Iaponites to know the magnificence of Europe, and by
that means principally to enrich themselves with gifts and privileges. But
for a farewell to these Iaponian Jesuits, I like their being there so well,
that I could wish all of that society in Europe were preaching in that Island.

Touching the kingdom of Iapan, we can not set down the number and order of
their Kings in ancient times. It seems, that these last eight hundred years
they have been much disquieted with civil wars; every one getting as many
shires or kingdoms, which in Iapan are three score and six, as he could.
Nabunanga was a great Prince; and Quabacondonus a greater: both great tyrants.
This last caused his Nephew to be made Quabacondono, contenting himself with
the title of Taicosama; but soon after, jealous of his greatness, he forced
him (after the Iaponian manner) with his companions, to kill himself. He having
no children but one infant, when he was sick and near to death, sent for
Gieiaso the chief of the Iaponian Nobles, Lord of eight kingdoms, and made
him administrator of the kingdom till his son should be of age; and further
to bind him hereunto, he made a marriage betwixt Gieiasoes ne^ce, two years
old, and this infant of his about the same age, causing the same presently to
be consummated. He took an oath of him, and the other nobles for their fealty
to his son. But after his death there arose Arth.Dantis.bist.

CHAP. XVI.
Of the Philippina's.

IT is already showed, that those Islands received this name of Philip the
second, King of Spain, and that this name sometime is in a large sense
attributed to all these Islands in those huge Seas, but more properly to those
which Legaspi discovered in the year 1564, and where the Spaniards have since
that time had some places of abode: Mendenao, Tendaya, Luzon, and their
neighbors, lying far into the Sea before Cauchin-China and Cambaia, betwixt
the seventh degree and the twentieth of Northerly latitude. They are G.Bot.Ben.
many in number, some of them very great, rich in rice, honey, fruits, birds,
beasts, fishes, gold: and enriched further with trade from China. Seventy of
these Islands are subjects or friends to the Spaniards. Of ancient time they
were subject to the Chinois, Discourse of China.
until they did voluntarily relinquish them: the cause of much civil war
amongst themselves, that Anarchy proving worse to them than a Tyranny, or
rather the worst tyranny, every man becoming a Tyrant, and as he had means of
wit, strength and followers, preying upon others, using or selling them for
slaves: which their divisions made an easy way to the Spanish Conquest.

They worshipped the Sun and Moon, and the men and women, which in their
language they called Maganitos, observing in their honor solemn and sumptuous
feasts. In the Illocos they worshipped the Devil, and offered to him many
sacrifices in recompense of a great quantity of gold, which they said he had
given them. Their Feasts and Sacrifices were done by women, which were Witches
(of them called Holgoi) reverenced amongst them as Priests. These had ordinary
talk with the Devil, and many times in public. These wrought strange
witchcrafts; they answered unto all questions that were demanded of them:
(although their answers were often either lies or riddles) they used lottes as
the Chinois, and were obseruers of times. If they began a journey, and met
with a Lizard or other worm, they would return home, saying, the heavens
prohibited their proceeding.

They have now amongst them many Preachers and Monasteries of the Augustinians,
Franciscans, and Iesuitcs. But the wicked life of the Spaniards is so offensive
to the Inhabitants, that the Discourser (himself a Friar) tells hereof a
notable Story. Page.349.
A certain Ilander soon after his baptism, died, and appeared after to many
of his Contrymen, persuading them to be baptized, as a way unto that
happiness, whereof he now had in himself most blessed experience: Only they
must be baptized, and observe the Commandments, of which the Spaniards
preached to them, of whom, and of others like unto them, there were in that
happy place infinite numbers. Here upon he vanished, and some were persuaded:
but others of them refused, saying; that because there were Spaniard-souldiers
in glory, they would not go thither, because they would not be in their
company. A like History Bartholom de las Casas Crudel.Hisp.
relates of a Western Indian, at the time of his death answering to a
Dominicke Ftier, which counseled him to die a Christian, and so to be capable
of heaven: (when he heard there were Spaniards in heaven) he would rather be
in hell with his fore fathers then in heaven with the Spaniards.

The Spaniards Francis. Va^z 1601.
have their Bishop and Archdecon, and besides other Religious, seven Colleges
of Jesuits. Boterus G.B.B.part 4. lib^.3.
says, that the King of Spain had thought to have made Manilla an
Archibishopricke, and added three other Bishoprics. Captain Noort ^^ Noort
1600.
(a Dutch man that compassed the world) lost a ship here in fight with the
Spaniards, and suncke one of theirs: he affirms that the conuerts of these
parts, are more popishly Christian then in the midst of Rome or Spain, and
more addicted to their superstitious follies. In Mendenao they are Mahumetans,
as they are in Burnco.

some carue and cut their skin, with sundry strakes and devises all over
their body. Moreover, as we have spoken of Balls worn in their yards, by the
men of Pegu, so here, the men and men-children amongst them have nails of
tin thrust quite through the head of his privy part, being split in the lower
end, and riueted, which is done when they be young, and the place grows up
again, without any great pain. They take it out, and put it in as occasion
serves. This here, as that in Pegu, is said to have bin practiced, to avoid
the sin of Sodomy, whereto before they were prone. The males also are (at
least in On the I Will Capul.
some of the Philippina's) circumcised. The people worship the devil, who
often times appears to them in conference, in most ugly and monstrous shape.
There is amongst them an Island of Negro's inhabited with black people, almost
as big as England, in nine degrees.

Here also be those Ant.Galuano
black people called Ospapuas, Man-eaters and Sorcerers, among whom Devils
walk familiarly, as Companions. If these wicked spirits find one alone, they
kill him, and therefore they always use company. Their Idols they adorn with
Ostrich feathers. They use to let themselves blood with a certain herb laid
to the member, and licked with the tongue: with which they can draw out all
the blood in their body.

When as Magellan, first of all men, by the West discovered these Eastern
Islands, in the Islands of Buthoan and Caleghan he could learn no other
Religion observed amongst them, but that lifting up their hands closed
together, and their face toward heaven, they called on their God by the name
of Abha. In Zubut (in token of friendship) he and the king did let themselves
blood on the right arm, for so was their wont to confirm leagues of amity.
The king had his skin painted with a hot iron Pensile: he and his people at
Magellan's persuasion were baptized; and burned their Idols, which were made
of hollow wood, with great faces and four teeth, like borestuskes in their
mouths; painted they were all over, but had only a forepart, and nothing
behind.

They wear in their yard a nail of gold. They had many wives, but one
principal. They observed many Ceremonies in killing a hog, in sacrifice, as
it seemed, to the Sun. After the sounding of their cimballs, and certain
cates set down in platters, two old women came forth with Trumpets or Pipes
of Reed, and did reverence to the Sun, and then clothing themselves with
sacred vestments, one of them put about her forehead a haire-lace with two
horns, holding another hairelace or skarse in her hand, and so began to sound,
dance, and call upon the Sun, wherein she is followed by the other, both of
them in this manner dancing about the Hog, which is there fast tied. A.
Pigasetta. in ^^^.
The horned Beldame still muttereth certain words to the Sun, and the other
answers her: then does she take a cup of Wine, and after some Ceremonies,
pours it on the Hog: and after that with a lance, after dances and
flourishes, she kills the Hog. All this while a little Torch is burning,
which at last she takes into her mouth, and biteth it: and the other woman
washes the Pipes with the swines blood, and with her finger, embrewed with
blood, marketh the forehead of her husband first, and then of the rest. Then
do they vntire themselves, and only with women associates, ^ate the cheer in
the platters: and after singe the Hog, and eat him.

From hence Magellan went to Mathan, where in a battle with the Ilanders he
was slain. In Puladan they keep Cocks for the Game, but eat not of their
flesh, forbidden by their superstitions. In Ciumbubon they found a tree, which
had leaves like those of the Mulbery, having besides on each side of the leaf,
as it were, two feet, with which (as if it had bin moving and sensible) it
would stir and go up and down. Pigafetta kept one eight days in a platter,
and when he rouched it, presently it would ^lee from him, and move up and
down: he thought it lived of the air.

In Burneo the people are, partly Moors, and partly Gentiles, and according to
their Religions, have two Kings and two royal Cities, situated in salt water.
The Moors when they kill a hen, or a goat, use first certain words to the
Sun. The Gentiles Mas. Transil.
worship the Sun and Moon, esteeming the one Male and the other Female, him
the Father, this the Mother of the Stars, whom also they reckon in the
Catalogue of their demigods. They salute the Sun in his morning-approch,
with certain verses and adoration: which they also perform to the Moon, and
demand of them children, riches, and other their necessaries. After death they
expect no future state. The Spaniards heard of great Pearls, as big as
eggs, which the King of Burneo had: and if you believe them, they took an
Oyster themselves, whose fishie substance weighed seven and forty pounds. The
Moore-King in Burneo was served in his Palace and attended only by women and
maidens.

In Gilolo Pigafetta.
they are likewise some of the Arabian Sect, the others Gentiles. The Moors
had two kings of their law, each of which had six hundred children. The
Gentiles used to worship the first thing they encounter in the morning all the
day following. They Got. rthus page.396.
were sometime man-eaters; some of the Ilanders were by the Portugalls
converted: but the King being poisoned by a Mahumetan, they declined. Yet one
Noble man named John, first killed his wife and children with his own hands,
left they should apostatize, and then offered himself to endure any torment.

The Moluccos are usually reckoned (as before is said,) but many other Islands
are subject to them, and by some Authors called also by that name. The King of
Ternate is said Sir Fr. Drah^.
to have seventy Islands under his subjection, and in his port represents
great majesty. Both here and in Banda the Mahumetan superstition has set
footing, and prevailed, as in the other adjoining Islands, the Moors being as
zealous to win Proselites, as to enrich themselves. None of these Islands is
above six leagues in compass, enriched with cloves, but of other fruits
barren and poor. One Mass.libr. 5.
tree they have, which out of the cut branches yields a white, wholesome, and
fauourie liquor for drink, they call it Tuaca, and the pith thereof affoordeth
them meat called Sagu, tasting in the mouth like sour Curds, melting like
Sugar, whereof they make certain Cakes, which will endure good for food ten
years. The cloue-trees not only suck up all the moisture of the Earth, where
they grow, disdaining any other plant should grow near them (like our
Inclosers) suddenly drinking up all the heavens liberality in showers, but
with their thirsty appetite intercept the running waters that descend from the
Mountains, before they can betake them to their mothers lap, the Oceans
refuge. In this Island Galuan^.
are men having anckles with spurs, like to Cocks; here are hogs with
horns: a river stored with fish, and yet so hot, that it flaicth of^ the
skin of any creature which enters it: there are Oisters so large, that they
christen in the shells: Crabbes so strong, that with their claws they will
break the iron of a picke-axe: stones which grow like fish, whereof they make
lime.

In Ternate Iac. ^^^
is a mountain, which (as it were) angry with Nature, for being fastened to the
earth, does not only lift up his high head above the airy regions of clouds,
but endeuoreth also to conioyne it self with the fiery Element, where with it
seems to hold some intercourse, with dreadful thunders belching out light
flames, mixed with a dark smoke, like proud Greatness, wasting it self with
it own flames, and filling the neighboring-valley with ashes, It is not much
above a hundred years, since first the Sect of Mahumet entered the Moluccas. But
now Lud.Fernand. La.Masonius.
both here and in Amboino the Jesuits have their residences, and have
persuaded many to their Catholic faith. Stephan Got. Arthus page 403.
ab Hagan in the year 1605. wanne this Island of Amboino, and the fort of the
Portugals, to the States: it is a cloue-Iland.

Much conflict was sometime between the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal,
about these Islands: and some war since betwixt. the Portugalls and
Hollanders, ended with the Hollanders loss. These Moluccians are treacherous,
faithless and jealous: they suffer no man to see their wives; yea themselves
see not their wives until they be contracted.

In Ternate Holland Nauig. 1598. and 99: per Bilibald. Strobe^^^
Theft is never suffered unpunished: the Hollanders saw a boy of eleven or
twelve years, for stealing a leaf of Tobacco, led up and down with his hands
bound behind him, for a public spectacle and derision to other boys. They
maintain deadly wars with the Portugalls, and spare none of them that they
can get. If an Eclipse of the Sun or Moon happen, they howl and make
piteous lamentation, persuading themselves, that their King, or some great man
amongst them will die. Experience thereof was the sixth of August 1599. when the
Moon was eclipsed about eight of the clock at night, they every way by crying
out, by strange gestures, praying, and beating their basins and drums,
expressed a lamentable passion of grief, for the fear aforesaid. And the
Eclipse being past, when they see, that neither the King, nor any other is
dead, they observe the next day solemnly festival with public Procession of
old and young, of all sorts. They esteemed it a Miracle when the Hollanders told
them that there were in their Country which could prognosticate of Eclipses
long before. Columbus Gas.Ens li. I. ca. 5.
used the simplicity of the Iamaicans to his preservation: for when they
forsook him he threatened unto them the anger of GOD, whereof they should see
an evident token in the darkening of the Moon within two days, which
according to the natural revolution of the Heavens (known to Columbus)
coming to pass, the Ilanders with dread and fear showed all readiness to
his service.

The water about Ternate is so clear, that they fish by the eye, and can see
the Ankers in the bottom of the water, at sixteen or seventeen fadome depth,
as if it were but a foot: and epsy every fish which passes, to no small
advantage of their fishing.

When the King goes to the Mesquit, a boy goes before, which bears his
Sword on his shoulder, and in the other hand a kidde: after him follow the
kings soldiers. After them another with a Censer. Next to whom comes the
King with a Tiresol over his head, to keep off the Sun. When they are come
to the doors, there are Vessels of water to wash their hands and feet, before
they enter; and then the floor is covered with white Cloth, whereon they
prostrate themselves, with their faces to the Earth, softly mumbling their
Mumpsimus-deuotions. In the midst is a Pulpit, spread with white Cloth. In
stead of a Bell they have a great Drum hanged up, which they beat with
clubbes: They have in every Temple also one Bell, but without a Clapper. All
come at that Peale, or Sound, with their weapons armed.

The Moluccians Iat Neccij Nauig.in octaua part. Ind. orient. de Bry.
are better proportioned then other Indians, have more beard (which the elder
men nourish and wear long for their greater authority) brown of color, and
mean of stature. For valor they have not their like in all India, especially
those of Ternate, choosing rather to die then flee, and esteeming it a great
credit to fight against greater multitudes. Their shields are of Wood, two
spannes broad, and four foot long. They are exceedingly addicted to sloth
and ease, none working in any handicraft; their houses are of timber and
reeds, without one nail in them, which their slaves build, and do also their
other labors. They have no money, and the silver which they have is employed to
vessels of plate. Their riches are their Cloves, wherewith they provide them
of other necessities. They never see their wives till they be married; nor the
wives them. Makian and Moher are now subject to the king of Ternate: Tidore and
Batian have their peculiar kings. This people have the power to elect their
king, so that they choose one of the royal and ancient family. The king of
Ternate calls himself king of Golilo, whereof he has but a part, and that
by conquest. The Birds of Paradise (says this Author) have two feet, as well as
other Birds; but as soon as they are taken, they are cut off, with a great
part of their body, whereof a little is left with the head and neck, which
beng hardened and dried in the Sun, seem to be so bred. The Moors Pig^setta.
made the Ilanders believe that they came out of Paradise, and therefore call
them Manucodiata, or holy Birds, and have them in religious account: They are
very beautiful, with variety of feathers and colors.

Amboyna brings forth Orenges, Citrons, Limons, Cloves, Coquos, Bonana's,
sugarcanes, and other fruits, being a very fertile Island. The Inhabitants are
simple, live sparingly, and are attyred like other the Moluccans. They spend
much Rice, whereof they make loaves like Sugar-loaues. They have Galleys Nauig.
Holland,^^^.per. B. Strobaeum. De Bry, part.5. Ind. Or. has the pictures of
these Galleys, etc.
after their manner, formed like Dragons, which they row very swiftly: they
call them Karkollen. The Admiral came to the Hollanders with three of these,
full of armed men, which rowed round about them, expressing manifold signs of
joy with Songs and Drums: the slaves singing as they rowed. They had three
pieces of Ordinance in every Galley, which they discharged, answered in that
kind by the Hollanders. But two of the Holland-shippes not finding sufficient
store of commodities for them all, went to Banta, passing by Poel Setto, an
Island not inhabited, bearing Northwest from Banta five Dutch miles. They say
it is inhabited of Devils, and whosoever must pass by, makes all possible
have to be gone, much affrighted either by selfe-fancies or deuillish
impostures.

Banta is four and twenty Dutch miles from Amboyna^ and divided into three
parts, which comprehend five miles. The chief City is Nera. In this Island
are more store of Nutmegs then elsewhere in the Moluccas: for which cause they
resort hither from Iaua, China, and Malacca. They profess Mahumetisme so
devoutly, that they never go to their Watches before they have prayed in the
Mesquit, whereinto they enter, being first washed (after the Mahumetane manner)
but pray so loud, that they may be heard a great distance: their words of
Prayer are Stofferolla; Stofferolla; Ascehad an la, Ascehad an la; Y^lla,
Ascehad an la; Ill lolla. ill lolla, Mahumed die Rosulla: At the pronouncing of
which last words, they stroke their hands over their face; in which gesture
they think is much holiness. Other prayers they mutter over very softly, with
little moving their lips. THey stand upon Mattes, and lift up their eyes
twice or thrice to Heaven: after which, they kneel down, bowing their head
twice or thrice to the earth. Thus they do often every day, both at home and
in the streets. They have their public Meetings and Bankets in their Temples
very often, every one bringing his part of the cheer: which sometimes they do
in the Woods, a hundred in a company. At these times they consult of public
affairs.

They have civil Wars, Nera and Lontoor holding together against three other
Towns. Two little Islands, Pollerviin and Poelvuay take part with Nera, and
when occasion requires, come thither with their Boats to consultation, where
they are entertained in public Feasts: the manner whereof is, that they sit
down in order; in stead of a Table every one has a piece of a leaf of the
Bonanas Tree: then is set before each a piece of Sagu bread, after that, a dish
made of the leaf of another Tree, with a little sodden Rice and Flesh-pottage,
which they hurl by handfulls into their mouths, devouring rather then eating
the same. In the mean while the Gentlemen arise with their weapons, and
exercise themselves in martial Games, with Daunces. The quarrel betwixt these
Islanders grew about the cutting of certain Trees, from whence it is come to
cut and kill one another with cruel butcheries.

They exercise Sea Fights in their Caracorae, or Galeots, with great
dexterity, with great shouts and cries, the Gentlemen dancing on the Hatches
very actiuely. They are very bloody and barbarous, yet bury the heads of
their enemies with sweet odours.

If any of their friends die, the women made a shrill and loud cry to call him
again; which not effected, they provide a great Feast, whereunto all the
kindred and friends are invited.

They bury them almost after our fashion, in a white sheet, the corpse being
carried on men's shoulders, the men first, and women after, following. A Censer
is there left fuming all the day and night; and in the night they keep a light
burning in a little House, which they have set over the Grave. In the morning
and evening all of all sorts come and say their Prayers a long while together
at the Grave: and being asked wherefore? they said, That the dead should not
arise again.

They have a play with the ball, exercised by many of them, not as amongst us
with the hand, but with their feet, tossing the same up into the Air, and
taking it one of another with admirable slight.

Before we leave these Moluccas and their dependant Islands, we may conclude
with a Tragedy, wherein blind Superstition, and beastly cruelty, were
principal Actors. When Menesius Art. Hist. Ind. Orient.c. 46.
was Governor of the Portugal Fort in Ternate, he kept a Sow, which some of
the deuouter Mahumetans killed. He getting the chief Priest (accessorie to the
fact) into the Castle, at his delivery made his face be greased with Bacon by
the Iaylor, which caused the people to offer abuse to some Portugalls. Menesius
in revenge cut off the hands of two of them, the third had his hands bound
behind him, and was baited with two dogs on the Seashore: which his
implacable enemies transported him into like dogged humor (though he were not
with H^cuba transformed into the shape) insomuch, that fastening with his teeth
on one of their ears, he held fast, till his strength failing, he sunk into
the Sea with the dog, and was drowned.

In Celebes they Od. Barbosa.
eat man's flesh. Hak.^^.3
The King of the Moluccas was wont to send condemned persons to Celebes, to be
devoured. Castrius converted the King. Southward of Celebes is situated a
little Island, where Sir Francis Drake graued his ship. This Island is
thoroughly grown with Woods, in which every night certain fiery Flies made
such a light, as if every twigge or tree had been a burning Candle. Here they
found Battes as big as Hens, and plenty of Cray-fishes so great, that one
would suffice four men to their dinner: they dug themselves holes in the
Earth, like Conies.

From hence they sailed to Iaua; of which name M. Paulus and Nic. di Conti
re^kon two great Islands, ascribing to the one two thousand, and to the other
three thousand miles in circuit. The less is near to the firm Land of the
South Continent, where Beach, and some other Provinces, are named by Paulus and
Vertomannus, of Heathenish Superstitions. The less Iaua had in the days of M.
Paulus eight Kingdoms, in six of which himself had been, which he names
Felech, wherein the rural inhabitants were Idolaters, the Citizens Moors: the
Idoll-worshippers ear any flesh whatsoever, of man, or beast, and observe all
day what they first see in the morning.

Basma M. Paul. l. 3.
the second, acknowledged the great Chams Sovereignty, but paid him no
tribute. Here were certain Unicorns, headed like a Swine, footed like an
Elephant, with one ^or^e on their forheads (with which they do not hurt any,
but to that end use certain prickles that grow on their tongues;) They delight
also in the Mire like Swain. Here are little Apes, much resembling men in
their countenance, which they used to preserve with certain Spices, having
flayed off their skins, and left the hair growing in those parts, where
Nature causes men to be hairie, and fell them to Merchants, to be carried over
the world as the bodies of little men; happily the only true Pygmies the world
yields.

In Samara, the third of those Kingdoms, none of the North-starres can be
seen. They are Man-eaters, and Idolaters; but not so brutish as in Dragoian,
the next Kingdom: where, if a man be sick, his kinsmen consult with their
Sorcerers, who enquire of the Devil, Whether he shall escape, or no? And if
the answer be Negative, they send for certain men, specially designed to that
villainous Mystery, which strangle him; and then they dress and eat him
amongst the kindred, even to the very marrow in his bones. For (say they) if
any flesh should remain, it would putrify, and worms would breed thereof,
which after (for want of sustenance) would perish, whereby the soul of the
dead party would be much tonnented. The bones they bury safely, that no Beast
should touch them: such dread have they of Beasts and cruelty in a more then
beastly cruelty, and such a care to observe humanity and piety in a most
impious inhumanitie.

Lambri, the next Kingdom, has in it some men with tails, like dogs, a
spanne long.

The last is Fanfur, where they live of bread made of the pith of Trees, the
wood whereof is heavy, and sinketh to the bottom, if it be put in water, like
iron, and therefore they make Lances thereof, able to pierce Armor: for it is
three-fingers thick betwixt the hollow and the bark.

To let pass Pentan, Sondar, and other idolatrous Islands, and come to Iaua
Mayor: This Country is very rich, but in times past of most abominable
custom. di Conti.
Nic. Conti says, That they seed on Cats, Rats, and other vermin, and were
most vile murderers, not sticking to make trial of the good cutting or thrust
of their blades on the next body they met with, and that without punishment,
yea (if the blow or' thrust were delivered with fine force) with much
commendation. Vertomannus Ver. l.6.
affirms of them, That some observe Idols, some the Sun or Moon, others an
Ox, and many the first thing they meet in the morning, and some worship the
Devil. When men were old, and not able longer to work, their children or
parents carried them into the market, and sold them to others, which did eat
them. And the like they used with the younger sort in any desperate sickness,
preventing Nature with a violent death, and esteeming their bellies sitter
sepulchers then the earth, accounting others fools which suffered the worms
to devour so pleasant food. For fear of these man-eaters they stayed not
long there. It seems that they have much left these brutish customs, since
won to more civility by the trading of Moors and Christians; especially
such as are of the Arabian Law: although, as our own countrymen report, which
have there lived, a man's life is valued to the murderer at a small sum of
money. They are a proud Nation: Scot.
If a man should come in where they are set on the ground after their manner,
and should sit on a Chest, or high thing, it were as much as his life were
worth.

for composing their Blades and Armor, of which they are conceited, that, being
tempered with their Charms and Superstitions, with the least drawing blood of
another, they will kill him; themselves, in their enchanted Armor, safe from
others blows. They abide in expectation of these Martial minutes, for their
coniured Armours, sometimes eight or ten years, before they can finish them.

say, That their ancestors came from China, which Country they forsook,
because of the tyranuie where with they were oppressed, and in great multitudes
peopled this Island. They wear their hair and their nails long. They are
dutiful to their superiors. The great men stir^e not forth, without a great
troop of followers. They are seldom idle, much busied about their Scabberds
and Weapons, which they use to poison. They are not without their weapons night
or day, which they will not suffer another man to touch. They are so eager of
revenge, that they will press on their adversaries weapon, drawing it through
their own body, to kill him that has wounded them. They have Mahumetane
Temples, where they do their devotions with great silence. They acknowledge
JESUS, Mahomet, David, and Moses four Prophets. They observe their hours, and
two Fasts, or Lents. The great men's wives never go out of the doors to be
seen. Their Cities are Ballambua, and Panarucan, (a little from whence is a
burning Hill, which first brake forth 1586, and oppressed infinite numbers of
men, and cast great stones into the City, for three days space making one
continued night of darkness) Passarua, the King whereof married the King of
Ballambuas daughter, and the second night after he had lain with her, slew her
and her attendants, because she would not turn Mahumetan. Ioartam, Surrabaia,
Tuban, Matara, are also royal Cities, as are Daunia, Taggal, Charabaon, and
many others. But Bantam is of most traffic, frequented by Portugalls, Dutch,
and English, in which every day are three several Markets. Here Merchants,
when they come, may buy a woman for their ^leshly and worldly business (you
may add the Devil too, to make up the number) which at their departure they
fell again. Public affairs are treated and handled by night, at which time
the Counselors of State meet, and ascend some tree, or the roof of the house,
viewing the heavens till the Moon arise, and then go into the Senat-house.

live certain of the Passarrans, which being there oppressed by their King,
came hither, and here obtained a piece of ground, to build them a City, which
is called Sura. They have a King, or Governor, and live quietly, following
Husbandry: they eat nothing that has life (a common Superstition of the
Indians) wear white Clothes of Paper, made of the leaves of Trees, and never
marry (herein resembling the Jewish Essees) yet never want succeeding
generation: Many of the Iauans daily consecrating themselves unto their
Society. The Chinois in Iaua do sometimes bring up Crocodiles, and eat them.

The King of Tuban Bilib. Strobaus
is the richest King, and mightiest in all Iaua. They have many Horses, and
make great account of them, decking them with gallant furniture of Gold,
Silver, and the counterfeits of Dragons and Devils on their Saddles: they ride
and manage their Horses with great skill.

Madura is North from Iaua, a fertile Island of Rice, the soil whereof is so
moist and waterish, that their Buffalls and men go almost knee-deepe, when
they sow it. Arosbay is the chief City. They are theeuish, and given to
spoil, and captiued many of the Hollanders, which went thither on shore, to
buy commodities; which they were forced to redeem at a dear rate. In these
parts, are Battes as big as Hens, which the people roast and eat.

The Island Bali is very populous, containing (as is thought) six hundred
thousand inhabitants; they are Ethnikes, and worship that which they first
meet in the morning. Here and in Pulo Rossa the women are burned with their
dead husbands: one man is said Nauig. Bat. 1594.c.39.
to have had fifty of his wives (for they marry as many as they please)
burned with him, whiles the Hollanders were there. The Island has many Bulls,
Buffals, Goats, Swine, Horse, with many kinds of Fowls, Fruits, and Mettalls:
The chief men are carried by slaves on seats borne on their shoulders, or else
in Chariots drawn with Buffalls.

In the Voyage of M. Thomas Candish Th. Candish. Hak. 10.3.page.822.
is mention made of a Iauan King, called Raia Balombam, very aged, which had a
hundred wives, and his son had fifty. Their custom is, that when the King
dies, they burn the body, and preserve the ashes. Five days after the wives
of the dead King go to a place appointed, and there she which was dearest in
his favor, throws a ball from her; and where that ball rests, thither they
go all, and turning their faces Eastward, stabbe themselves with a Crise or
Dagger to the heart. They are very resolute people, and dread no attempt which
the King shall enjoin them, be it never so dangerous. All the race of this
King Ballamboam was rased and utterly destroyed by the Passarvan, after a long
siege: which War was begun in the blood of the King of Ballamboams daughter,
whom he slew, as is before said, and added this Drunkenness unto his thirst.

Iortam, or Ioartam N^nig. Oliver Noort.
contains about a thousand households. The inhabitants are Ethnikes, and have
their Temples in Woods, to which they resort to say and do their Holies at
noone, before their deformed Deuill-formed Pagodes. In this City dwells the
chief Pope, or High Priest, of that Superstition, whose authority is great in
all those parts. He was a hundred and twenty years old, and had many wives
which nourished him with their milk, being not able to take other sustenance:
a deadly enemy to the Christians, whom the King did yet with some Privileges
favor.

Of Samatra, and Zeilan.

SAmatra is esteemed by some Gi. Bot. Ben. Mass.l.4 O.Arthus Hist. Indiae

the greatest of the Eastern Islands, stretching it self almost seven hundred
miles in length, in breadth above two hundred. The Air is not very wholesome,
by reason of the situation under the Line, and the multitude of Lakes and
Rivers, whereout the Sun drinks more then he can well concoct, and
therefore (as it were) belcheth out here continually such crude and undigested
vapors. Their food is Millet, Rice, Sagu, and Fruits. Their riches are
Pepper, Ginger, Cassia, Silk, Benioyn, Gold, Tin, Iron, etc. The Kingdom of
Campa is full of Trees, whose pith or marrow is Aloe, which is prized in India
at the like weight (some say) of Gold; the Bark is called Aquila. In the
Seacoast they are Moors in Religion, and so have been about these last two
hundred years: up within Land they are Pagans, and in many places, as in the
Kingdoms of Andragiri and Aru, they are Man-eaters. They were divided, before
the Portugalls entered India, into nine and twenty Kingdoms, whereof the
chief was Pedir, after that Pacem, and now Acem. For Abram, sometime a slave,
since King of Acem, has conquered almost all the North part of the Island, and
with help from the Turk and the Arabians distresseth sometimes the affairs
of Malacca. This King Linsch^t.
gave in marriage with his daughter, to the King of Ior, a piece of Ordinance,
such as for greatness, length, and workmanship can hardly be matched in all
Christendom. Here is a P. Bertius Tab.

writes, That the Bacas, or Man-eaters, in the Mountains of Samatra, gild
their teeth, and esteem the flesh of black people sweeter then of the white.
The flesh of their Kine, Buffes, and Hens, is as black as Ink. They say,
That there are certain people there called Daragni Dara, which have tails
like to Sheep. Here is said also to grow a Tree, the juice whereof is strong
poison, and if it touch the blood of a man, kills him, but if a man drink of
it, it is a sovereign Antidote. As for those tailed-people (a slander by
Beckets Legend See Lamberts perambul.
reported of some Kentish men, injurious to that angry Saint, and after
applied to our whole Nation; many indeed esteeming the English to be tayled)
Galvano affirms, That the King of Tidore told him, that in the Islands of
Batto-China there were some which had tails, having also a thing like unto a
dugge between their coddes, out of the which there came Milk.

Nicolo di Conti N.di Conti.
says, in his time the Samatrans were all Gentiles, and the Maneaters amongst
them used the skulls of their eaten enemies in stead of money, exchanging the
same for their necessaries; and he was accounted the richest man, which had
most of those skulls in his house. In Vertomannus time they had money in Pedir,
narked on the one side with a Devil, on the other with a Chariot, drawn with
Elephants. Their L. Vert.
Religion (he says) is the same with those of Tarnasseri, burning heir wives
in like manner. The inhabitants are cunning Artificers, Merchants, and Sailors:
their Ships have at each end a Prow, which with marvelous agilitie they can
dispose forwards, or backwards, making use of the same, according to he
diversity of Wind and Channel, which there are very changeable.

In Acen Herman. de Bree. Arthus page.359
are Mesquits of Timber and Reed, with the Vessels of Water at the entry for
them to wash, according to the Arabian custom. The King comes little abroad,
nor may any go to him, except he be sent for by an Officer with a gilded
Staff, or Dagger.

To his Palace they pass through seven Gates one after another, guarded with
women, expert at their weapon, and using both Pieces and Swords. He has none
other guard for his person. In saluting the King, they lay their hands foulded
on their head, which in other salutations they lay on the forhead. It is
thought, that the present King was sometime a Fisherman. He is a Mahumetan.

In Macazar (an Island not far from the former) the most are Ethnickes, some
also Moors, and some Christians. They use the Malaican, or Malaian, Tongue,
which is general through the Indies. Their Arrow-heads are of Fish-bones,
enuenomed with incurable poison. In Macazar the Priests conform, or rather
deforme, themselves to the fashion of women, nourishing their hair on the
head, and plucking it out of the face: they guild their teeth, and use broken,
wanton, and effeminate gestures. They are called Becos; they marry one
another. For them to lie with a woman, is capital, and is punished with
burning in Pitch. These Men-monsters, Women-Deuills, were great impediments to
the Portugalls, in drawing them to Christianity.

Zeilan (which some call Seylon, other Ceilan) is by Barrius auerred to be
Taprobana: sometimes (according to M. Paul M. Paul. lib.3.
his Reports) thought to have comprehended three thousand six hundred miles in
circuit; since much impaired by his ouer-mightie neighbor the Sea, which has
now left not above two hundred and fifty miles in length, and a hundred and
forty of breadth unto it. Barbosa.
The Indians call it Tenarisim, or the delitious Land, and some are of opinion,
that this was Paradise. So just are the judgments of the Highest, that, when
as man wandered from him, caused him also to wander from himself, and from his
habitation: yea, the place it self has also wandered, in men's wandering
conceits, over the World, yea, and out of our habitable World altogether, as
before is showed; men now seeking it as vainly as before they lost it. It is in
fashion Lib. 1.
resembling an egg, by a shallow channel separated from the Cape Comori. The
Heavens with their deawes, the Air with a pleasant holesomenesse and fragrant
freshness, the Waters in their many Rivers and Fountains, the Earth
diuersified in aspiring Hills, Iow^^^ Vales, equal and indifferent Plains,
filled in her inward Chambers with Mettalls and Jewels, in her outward Court
and upper face stored with whole Woods of the best Cinnamon that the Sun
sees, besides Fruits, Oranges, Leimons, etc. surmounting those of Spain;
Fowls and Beasts, both tame and wild (among which is their Elephant Linschot.
An. Corsali.
, honored by a naturali acknowledgement of excellence, of all other Elephants
in the world.) These all have conspired and joined in common League, to present
unto Zeilan the chief of worldly treasures and pleasures, with a long and
healthful life in the inhabitants, to enjoy them. No marvel then, if sense
and sensuality have here stumbled on a Paradise. There, wooddie Hills (as a
natural Amphitheatre) do encompasse a large Plain: and one of them, as not
contenting his beetle-browes with that only prospect, disdaineth also the
fellowship of the neighboring Mountains, lifting Maff. 1.3.
up his steep head seven Leagues in height; and has in the top a Plain, in
the midst whereof is a stone of two Cubits, erected in manner of a Table,
holding in it the print of ^ man's foot, who (they say) came from Deli thither,
to teach them Religion. The Iogues and other devout Pilgrims resort thither,
from places a thousand Leagues distant, with great difficulty of passage both
hither and here. For they are forced to mount up this Hill by the help of
nails and chains fastened thereto. Nature having prohibited other passage.
Maffoeus and Boterus could persuade themselves, that this foot-steppe is a
relike and memory of the Ethiopian Eunuch: others will have it farther fet,
and father it on Adam, the first father of mankind, of whom the Hill also is
named, Pico de Adam. The Moors Od.Barbosa.
call it Adam Baba, and say, That from thence Adam ascended into Heaven. The
Pilgrims are clad in their Pal^ners-weed, with iron chains, and skins of
Lions, and other wild Beasts. Upon their arms and legs they wear buttons
with sharp points, that cut the flesh, and draw blood, which (they say) they
do in GODS service.

Before they come at the mountain, they pass by a fenny valley full of water,
wherein they wade up to the waste, with knives in their hands, to scrape from
their legs the bloud-leeches, which else would end their pilgrimage and life
before the time. For this durtie and watery passage continues eighteen miles,
before they come at the hill, whose proud top would disdain climing, if Art
did not captive Nature, and bind the hill with chains of iron, as is said.
When they are mounted, they wash them in a lake or poole of clear springing
water, near to that foote-stone, and making their prayers, do thus account
themselves clean from all their sins. This holy journey is generally
performed by the Ilanders (says Vertomannus) once a year. He adds
Vert.^^.3.c.4.
that a Moore told him, that his foot-print was two spannes long: and that Adam
here a long time bewailed his sin, and found pardon. But Odoricus affirms,
that they reported this mourning to have been for Abel, and to have lasted
three hundred years, and of the tears of Abel and Eve this purifying water to
have proceeded: which Odoricus Odoricus.
proved to be a tale, because he saw the water springing continually, and it
runs thence into the sea. He says that this water had in it many precious
stones; and the King gave leave at certain times of the year to poor men to
take them, that they might pray for his soul; which they could not do, but
first anointed with Limons, because of the horseleeches in that water. Adams
hill is supposed to be seven leagues in height. In Candy Her.de Bre^.
were statues artificially wrought five or six fathomes high, which these
Symmetrians proportioned to the stature of Adam, gathered by that print of his
foot.

In Vintane, Georgius Spilbergins.
is a Pagode or Idol-temple, the compass whereof is an hundred and thirty
paces: it is very high, and all white except on the top, which has the
spires thereof gilded, in so much that men are not able, when the Sun
shines, to look thereon. It has a Tower or square Steeple of excellent
workmanshippe. There are many other Temples, and a Monastery also of Religious
persons, which are attired in yellow, have their crowns shaven, with Beads in
their hands, and always seem to mumble over somewhat of their devout orisons,
being in high estimation of sanctity with the vulgar, and freed from public
labors and burdens. Their Monastery is built after the manner of the Popish,
being also gilded with gold. In their Chappells are many Images of both sexes,
which they say represent some of their Saints: they are set on the Altars, and
are clothed with garments of gold and silver. Before them are the Images of
Boys, which bear up great Candle-stickes, with waxe-candles burning therein
night and day. Every hour they resort to these Altars to their Mumpsimus. They
held a solemn Procession, whiles the Hollanders were there, in which their
Abbot rode on an Elephant richly attired, lifting up his hands over his head,
with a golden rod therein: the Monks went two and two before him in order,
partly bearing, and playing on many Instruments of Music, partly bearing
waxlights and torches: the men also, and after them the women and maids,
followed in like order: and the fairest Virgins were busied with games and
dances, being naked from the navel upwards, beneath covered with smockes of
diverse colors, their arms and ears adorned with gold and jewels. Any man
that should see it (says our Author) would think, our Western Monks had
hence borrowed their Ceremonies. Their Images are in every corner of the way,
which they adorn with flowers. In Candy, the chief City of that Kingdom,
were Pagodes innumerable. The houses or Temples were of stone, like the Temples
in these parts: some statues were as high as the mast of a ship. The people
here, if they have once touched meat, which for quantity or quality they
cannot eat, they cast it to the dogs: neither will any man (be he never so
mean) eat that which another has touched. The women go naked from the waste
upwards. They marry as many wives as they can keep.

The King makes use of their superstition: For pretending to build Temples, he
after leaves them imperfect, excusing himself, that they had not contributed
sufficient sums of money, and therefore exacteth a new. There is one statue
of great stature, with a sword in his hand, which by illusion of the Devil (if
it be not the delusion of fabulous reports) made as though he would strike the
King with his sword, as he was entering the Temple, and put him in great fear,
whereas before he had made a mock of it. The Singales or Native Inhabitants
say that the world shall not perish as long as that Image continues safe. When
any one is sick, he sacrifices to the Devil, having a box hanging in his
house to that end, therein to gather somewhat for his offering. Some pray unto
the Image of an Elephants head, made of wood or stone, that they may obtain
wisdom (whereof this prayer argues their great want): some eat no quick
creature. They eat no beef, nor drink any wine; they worship whatsoever first
meets them in the morning.

George Spilberge was bountifully entertained of the King of Candy, Herman. de
Brec, ap.de Bry.part. 8.Ind. Or.
but Sebald de Weert was with diverse of his companions slain, after he had
received much kindness of the King; his importunity to get the King into his
ship, making him suspect some treachery.

The King of Morecalo had ears adorned with jewels, and hanging down (the
lappets of them were so stretched) to his shoulders. He was kind to the
Hollanders: but they incensed him against them by killing certain Kine; for
some of them said, that the souls of Kine slain after that manner, were
hurled forthwith into hell. He observed one Pagode, to whose feast he went
while the Hollanders were there, the solemnity whereof was to continue ten
days, till a new Moon, with great concourse of devout persons.

thought to have been there left by the Chinois, sometimes Lords of Zeilan.
Yet in M. Paulus his days the Tartarians had not pierced thus far. For the
King then reigning, refused to sell to Cublai Can (then the greatest Monarch in
the world) at a price, a Ruby which he had left him by his Ancestors,
esteemed the richest jewel in the world, being (as he Paul l. 3.c.19.
says) a spanne long, and as big as a man's arm, clear and shining, as if
it had been a fire. In this Island were reckoned nine Principalities or
Kingdoms, but Linschoten.
not long since their chief King was murdered by a Barber, who drove the
other Kings out of the Country, and usurped the Monarchy to himself,
practicing hostility against the Portugalls.

The Cingalas are very cunning Artificers in all mettalls. One of them
presented the Arch-bishoppe of Goa with a Crucifix, so cunningly wrought, as if
he had given life to the Image of one dead. He sent it to the King of Spain
as a rare jewel, not to be equalled in Europe.

The Inhabitants here are active and expert in Iugling, both men and women,
traveling through India with their strange Hobby-horses, to get money by this
vanity. The Seacoast (as in other Indian Islands) is inhabited with Moors,
the Inland with Pagans.

The Portugalls have a fortress at Colombo. The Ilanders Od. Barbosa.
are not warriors: they give themselves to pastime and pleasure: they go
naked from the girdle upward: they make wide holes in their ears, which they
stretch out with the weight of their jewels to their shoulders.

The Hollanders found exceeding, both good and bad, entertainment with the King
of Candy. Now for that question, whether Zeilan or Samatra be that Taprobane of
the Ancient is very doubtful. Yet that report in Pliny Plin.l.6.c.22.
of Taprobane seems more to incline for Zeilan. For he says, that in
Claudius time, a servant of Annius Plocamus, which was Customer for the
Red Sea, was carried from the Coast of Arabia, besides Carmania, in fifteen
days, which I think could not possibly be done to Samatra. Likewise the
excellency of the Elephants beyond all the Indian agrees to Zeilan: and had
Samatra been so known at that time, the other parts of India (it is like) had
been better discovered then they were in those times. This Taprobane was
discovered to be an Island, by Onesicritus, Alexanders Admiral of his Fleet in
these parts. It was then accounted another world, and therefore shall be the
Period of our PILGRIMAGE, and Perambulation in this Part of the World: which
(by the gracious goodness of his Almighty guide) the Pilgrim having passed:
before he venture upon the Monster-breeding Africa, he thinks it not amiss to
repose himself in so pleasant an Island; where he may at leisure look back,
and view the ruins of so many mighty Monarchies, puissant Kingdoms, stately
Cities, and renowned States, which by the wise, just and provident hand of the
Disposer of Kingdoms, have had their fatal Periods, and given place; some to
Barbarism, and some to their succeeding heirs (sprung out of their ashes)
flourishing in greater glory then their predecessors.

Here may he likewise behold many beauteous Nymphs (daughters of Asia)
lifting up their Virgin-lookes to view the world: which, putting off their
maskes (that have heretofore veiled their beauties from the bright eye of
fairer Europe) do give good hope of future discoueries in those parts, which
yet lurk under that obscure curtain of Terra Incognita. Acknowledging both in
the one and the other (as the Almighty power of him that brings all this to
pass, so) his bountiful mercy to that land, which he has separated from the
rest of the world; not so much by a sea of waters, as by that boundless Ocean
of his grace and favor, from whence flow those eternal waters of life, which
this Nation above other Nations enjoys. Here has he built a Temple for his
TRVTH, and planted Olives round about it. Here has he crowned that TRVTH,
with prosperity and plenty of all things. Here has he decreed to establish
that TRVTH, to be a faithful witness on Earth, so long as the Sun shall
endure in Heaven; if the ingratitude of such people, so favored, do not
compel him to turn away his face in displeasure. Which fearful Curse to
auert, the Pilgrim does again betake him to his Beads: beseeching the LORD of
Heaven and Earth, who does whatsoever he will both in Heaven and in Earth, to
turn away that wrath (which by manifold examples he has warned us of in other
parts) which we have as deeply deserved as any. And that he would still be
pleased to lift up the light of his loving countenance upon us, in vouchsafing
us that Saint (his Vna Veritas) to be our guide for ever. To that Saint is this
voyage intended: which (after a Psalm 24.1.
Domini est terra, and a Gloria Patri, for the conclusion of his Orisons) the
Religious Traveler shall be ready to prosecute.

RELATIONS OF THE REGIONS AND RELIGIONS IN AFRICA. OF Egypt, BARBARY, NVMI,
DIA, LIBYA, AND THE LAND OF NEGROS; AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS.

Of AFRICA, and the Creatures therein.

can give more probable Etimologie of the Name, I list not to contend. Nor is
it meet for me to be religious in these questions of names, in this quest and
inquire of Religions. It is a great Peninsula, by one Isth^^^^, or neck of
land between the red sea, and Mediterranean, joined to the continent, which
with the red sea aforesaid is the Eastern limit of Africa, as the Mediteranean
on the North, and elsewhere the Ocean.

For Nilus is a more obscure, and uncertain vmpire. It is twice Magin.
as big as Europe, and yet not so much peopled: Nature having made here her
solitary place of retiring, attended by scorching heates, and showers of
sands, as a counterfeit of those heavenly raines, and moving waters, which the
air and seas afford in other places.

Such are the many deserts in Africa, only fertile in barrenness: although in
other parts it is both fruitful and populous. The Equinoctial Circle does in
manner divide it in the midst. And yet old Atlas never sheddeth his snowie
hairs, but has always on his huge and high ^op^es vnmolten snow, whence
sometime it is dispersed as from a storehouse, in such incredible quantity,
that it covers carts, Horses, and the tops of trees, to the great danger of
the inhabitants: and the fountains are so cold as a man is not able to endure
his hand in them. Mount Atlas aforesaid stretches from the Ocean, Oc.
Atlanticus.
bearing name of him almost to Egypt. Other Mountains of name are those of
Sierra, Leona, and the Mountains of the Moon, etc.

One Lake Zembre, yields three mighty Rivers, disemboking themselves into
three several seas: Nilus which runs Northwards forty degrees from hence,
in Astronomicall reckoning; Cuama which runs into the Eastern; and Zaire
into the Western seas: of which Rivers, and of other like, the Reader shall
find more in due place spoken.

The Romans reckoned six Provinces in Africa: Ptolomey numbereth twelve. But
then was not Africa so well known as now. John Leo Io Leo.lib.I.
(a Moore, both learned and experienced) having spent many years in travel,
divides Africa into four parts; Barbaria, Numidia, Lybia, and the Land of
Negros. Numidia he calls Biledulgerid, or the Region of Dates: and Lybia, he
calls Sarra, for so the Arabians call a desert. But he thus excludes Egypt,
and both the higher and lower Aethiopia, which others Maginus. Pory.
add hereunto, and make up seven parts of Africa.

Many are the Io.Leo lib.9.
Creatures which Africa yields, not usual in our parts. Elephants are there
in plenty, and keep in great herdes together: The Giraffa or Camelopardalis;
a beast not often seen, yet very tame, and of a strange composition, mixed of
a Libard, Heart, Buffe, and Camel, P. Bellon. l.2. cap.49. does largely
describe him.
and by reason of his long legs before, and shorter behind, not able to
grase without difficulty, but with his high head, which he can stretch forth
half a pikes length in height, seems to feed on the leaves and boughs of
trees. The Camels in Afrike are more hardy then in other places; and will not
only bear great burden, but continue to travel fifty days together,
without carrying with them any corn to give them, but turn them out at night
to feed on thistles, boughs, and the little grass they find: And no less
patient are they of thirst, being able to endure fifteen days without drink
upon necessity, and five days ordinarily. The Arabians in Africa count them
their greatest wealth: for so they defcribe a man's riches, saying, He has so
many thousand Camels: and with these they can live in the deserts without dread
of any Prince.

Of Camels they have three sorts: the first called Hugiun, of great stature,
and strength, able to carry a thousand pound weight: the second lesle, with two
bunches on the back, fit for carriage and to ride one; called Becheti, of
which they have only in Asia. The third sort, called Ragnahil, is meagre and
small, able to travel (for they are not used to burdens) above an hundred
miles in a day. And the King of Tombuto can send messengers on such Camels to
Segelmesse or Darha, nine hundred miles distant in seven or eight days,
without stay or change by the way.

Their Camels also are docile: they will more be persuaded to hold on a journey
further then ordinary by songs, then blows. In the spring they are mare-wood,
and mad of copulation, in which time they are very ready both to hurt their
followers, and to kill their masters, or any that have whipped or hurt them.
Of horses they have both wild (which they entrap by subtil^ie) and tame: of
which the Barbary ho: se is famous, in Europe and Asia highly prized. The Lant
or Dant is a kind of wild Kine, but swifter then almost any other beast. They
have also wild Kine, and wild Asses. The Adimmain is as big as an Assle,
otherwise resembling a Ram. They have other sheep, whose Tails weigh twenty
pound, and sometime fourscore or more, carried on little Cart behind them.
But those Adimmain are found in the Deserts and kept to profit, yielding them
Milk and Cheese. The Females only have horns. The Lions in cold places are
more gentle, in hotter are more fierce, and will not flee the onset of two
hundred horsemen armed. Mr. John Vassal Of Eastwood in Essex.
(a friend and neighbor of mine) told me that he brought once out of Barbary
a Lions skin, which from the ^noute to the top of the Tail contained one and
twenty foot in length. Strange it is that a Lioness by showing her hinder
parts to the Male, should make him run away. In time of their coupling, eight
or ten will follow one Female, with terrible and bloody battles amongst
themselves.

They engender backward, Plin.l.8.c.16. Solinus c.36.
as do the Camel, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Ounce, and Tiger. They spare such men
as prostrate themselves, and prey rather on men then women, and not at all on
Infants, except compelled by hunger. Plinis tells that Alexander set thousands
on work by hunting, hauking, Fishing, or other means, to take and learn the
Natures of creatures, that Aristotle might by them be informed thereof, who
wrote almost fifty Treatises of that Subject, whereof it seems most are
lost. He cites out of Aristot. histor. ^nimalium.
him, that Lions bring forth small deformed lumpes, at the first time five, and
(every year after) one less, after the fifth burden remaining barren. It
cannot stir till it be two months old, nor go till it be six, if you
believe him. The Lybians believe that the Lion has understanding of prayers,
and tell of a Getulian woman, which lying at the Lions mercy besought him so
Noble a beast not to dish mour himself with so ignoble a prey and conquest as
she a weak woman was. The like is told Ovied.hist.Ind. l.16.c.11. Urban.
Calueto in Benzon.l.3.
of a Spanish Dog, of one Didacus Salazara Spaniard. This man, according to
the bloody practice of that Nation, minding to fill his Dogs belly with an
old woman's flesh which was his Captive, gave her a Letter to carry to the
Governor and so soon as she was a little past, loosed his Mastife, who
presently had ouer-taken her. The woman terrified, proftrates her self to the
Dog, and sues for her life; Good Master Dog, Master Dog (says she) in
her language, I carry this Letter to the Governor (and shows it him.) Be not
fierce on me Master Dog. The Dog (having changed, it seems, with his
master his doggednesse for the others humanity) made a stay, and lifting up
his leg only pisted on her and departed, to no small wonder of the Spaniards
that knew him.

But to return to the King of beasts. His Tail seems to be his Scepter,
whereby he expresses his passion. He shrinkes not at danger, except some
covert of Woods shroude him from witnesses, and then he will take the benefit
of flight, which otherwise he seems to disdain. Mentor, a man of Syracusa,
was encountered with a Lion, which in stead of tearing him, fawned on him, and
with his dumb eloquence seemed to implore his aid, showing his diseased
foot, wherein Mentor perceived a stubbe sticking, which he pulled out. The
like is reported by Gellius A Gellius Noct.A^tic^
, out of Polyhistor, of a Fugitive servant, who having performed this kind of
office to a Lion, was by him gratified for a long space with a daily portion of
his prey, But after the man was taken and presented to his Master (a Roman
Senator) who exhibited games to the Romans, wherein servants and condemned
persons were exposed to the fury of the beasts, amongst whom he placed this
servant; and by a wonderful Fate, this Lion also was a little before taken and
bestowed on him for this solemn spectacle. The beasts running with violence to
their bloody encounter, suddenly this Lion stayed, and taking a little better
view fawned on this his guest, and defended him from the assault of the other
beasts: whereupon, by the peoples entreatie (who had learned the Story of him)
he was freed, and the beast given him: which followed him with a Line in the
streets, the people pointing and saying; Hic est homo Medicus leonis, hic est
Leo hospes hominis. One Elpis a Samian performed a cure on another Lion,
pulling a bone out of his throat, at the Lions gaping and silent moan: and in
remembrance hereof built a temple (at his return) to Bacchus at Sango, whom
before he had inuoked, being in fear of a Lion. Pliny and Solinus among other
African beasts mention the Hyaena, which some think to be Male one year, and
Female another, by course: This Aristotle Arist hist. animal.l.6.32.
denies. This beast has no necke-ioint, and therefore stirs not his neck,
but with bending about his whole body. He will imitate humane voice, and
drawing near to the sheepe-coates, having heard the name of some of the
shepherds will call him, and when he comes, devour him. They tell that his
eyes are diuersified with a thousand colors, that the touch of his shadow
makes a dog not able to bark. By eng^ndring with this beast, the Lioness
brings forth a Crocuta, of like qualities to the Hyaena. He has one continued
tooth without division throughout his mouth. In Africa also are wild Asses,
among which, one Male has many Females: a jealous beast, who (for fear of
after encroching) bites off the stones to the young Males, if the suspicious
female prevent him not by bringing forth in a close place where he shall not
find it. The like is told of Beners, Flin.l.8.c.30. Whitney Einbl. Solinus.
which being hunted for the medicinable quality of their stones, are said to
bite them off when they are in danger to be taken, paying that ransom for
their lives. It cannot be true that is reported of the Hyaeneum, Marbod^us de
Gemmis.
a stone found in the Hyaena's eye, that being put under the tongue of a man,
he shall foretell things to come, except he foretell this, That no man will
believe what our Author before has told.

The Libard is not hurtful to men except they annoy him: but kills and
eats Dogs. Dabuh is the name of a simple and base creature like a Wolf,
save that his legs and feet are like to a man's: Sol in c. 33. calls them
Celphos.
so foolish, that with a song, and a Taber, they which know his haunt will
bring him out of his den, and captive his ears with their music, while
another captiuateth his legs with a Rope.

The Zebra of all creatures for beauty and comeliness is admirably pleasing:
resembling a horse of exquisite composition, but not all so swift, all
ouer-laide with party colored Laces, and guards, from head to Tail. They
live in great herds, as I was told by my friend Andrew Battle, who lived in
the Kingdom of Congo many years, and for the space of some months lived on
the flesh of this Beast, which he killed with his piece. For upon some
quarrel betwixt the Portugales (among whom he was a Sergeant of a band) and
him, he lived eight or nine months in the woods, where he might have view of
hundreds together in herds both of these, and of Elephants. So simple was the
Zebra, that when he shot one, he might shoot still, they all standing still
at gaze, till three or four of them were dead. But more strange it seemed
which he told me of a kind of great Apes, if they might so be termed, of the
height of a man, but twice as big in feature of their limbs, with strength
proportionable, hairie all over, otherwise altogether like men and women in
their whole bodily shape. They lived on such wild fruits as the Trees and
woods yielded, and in the night time lodged on the Trees: He was accompanied
with two Negro-boyes: and they carried away one of them by a sudden surprise:
yet not hurting him, as they use not to do any which they take, except they
then look upon them. This slave after a months life with them conuayed
himself away again to his Master. Other Apes there are store, and as Solinus
reports, Satyrs (if there be any such) are thought to be conceived of humane
copulation with Goats. ^. raudius in Soli^.
Satyrs with feet like Goats, and Sphynges, with breasts like women, and
hairie, whereof Pierius says he saw one at Verona, and a kind of Conies also
at the same time, four times as big as the ordinary, and (which is more
incredible) had each of them four genitall members. Philippo Pigafetta
speaks in his Relation Congo translated by A. H.
of Congo, of other beasts in Africa, as of the Tiger as fierce and cruel as
Lions, making prey of man and beast, yet rather devouring black men, then
white: whose Mustachi^s are holden for mortal poison. and being given in
meats, cause men to die mad. The Empalanga is somewhat like to an Ox. Their
sheep and goats never bring forth less then two, and sometimes three or
four at a time. They have Wolves, Foxes, Dear, (Red and Fallow) Robuckes,
Ciuet-Cats, Sables and Marterns. They have Snakes and Adders, whereof some are
called Imbumas five and twenty spannes long, living in Land and water, not
venomous but ravenous, and lurk in trees (for which taking purpose, Nature
has given it a little horn or claw within two or three foot of the Tail)
waiting for their prey, which having taken, it deuoureth horns, hoofes, and
all, although it be a heart. And then swollen with this so huge a meal, it is
as it were drunk and sleepie, and unwieldy or the space of five or six days.
The Pagan Negros roast and eat them as great dainties. The people do eat
them. The biting of their Vipers kills in four and twenty hours space.
Africa for monsters in this kind has been famous, as in the Roman History
appears. Attilius A Gel.l.6.c.3.
Regulus the Roman Consul in the first Punike war, at the River Bagrada
encountered with a huge Serpent, and planted his Engines an 1 Artillery against
the same, whose skin, sent to Rome for a Monument, was in length a hundred
and twenty foot, as Gellius out of Tubero reports. The Scales Oros.l.4.c.8.
armed it from all hurt by darts or Arrows, and with the breath it killed
many, and had eaten many of the Soldiers before they could with a stone out
of an Engine destroy the destroyer. The Rivers of Niger, Nilus, Zaire, and
others, have store of Crocodiles, whereof some are of incredible bigness and
greedy denourers. Mount Atlas has plenty of Dragons, gross of body, flow of
motion, and in biting or touching incurably venomous. The Deserts of Lybia have
in them many Hydra's. Dubh is the name of a kind of great Lizard, not
venomous, which never drinks, and if water be put in his mouth he presently
dies. He is counted dainty meat, and three days after he is killed, at the
heat of the fire hec moves as if he had life. In Congo is a kind of Dragons
like in bigness to Rams, with wings, having long Tails, and Chappes, and
diverse jaws of Teeth, of blew and green color, painted like scales, with two
feet, and feed on raw flesh. The Pagan Negros pray to them as Gods, for
which cause the great Lords keep them to make a gain of the peoples devotion,
which offer their gifts and Oblations. The Chameleons are known among us,
admirable for their acrie sustenance, (although they also hunt and eat Flies)
and for the changeablenes of their colors. Solinus c. 3.3.
The Tarandus, a beast somewhat resembling an Ox, living in Aethiopia, is of
like fearefulnes and changeablenes. An other Serpent has a rundle on his Tail
like a Bell, which also ringeth as it goes. But if any desire to know the
variety of these Serpents, Solinus in his thirteenth chapter will more fully
satisfy him: and Bellonius in his observations.

Manifold are these kinds of Serpents in Africa, as the Cerastes, which has a
little Coronet of four horns, whereby he allureth the birds unto him (lying
hidden in the sands all but the head,) and so deuoreth them. The Iaculi dart
themselves from trees on such creatures as pass by. The Amphisbena, has two
heads, the Tail also onerated, (I cannot say honored) with a head, which
causes it to move circularly with crooked windings: a fit Emblem of popular
sedition, where the people will rule their Prince, needs must their motion be
crooked, when there are two heads, and therefore none. The Scythale is
admirable in her varied iacket. The Dipsas killes those whom she stingeth,
with thirst. The Hypanale with sleep, as befell to Cleopatra. The Hemerois
with vnstanchable bleeding. The Prester with swelling. And not to poison you
with names of many other of these poisonfull creatures, the Basiliske is said
to kill with her sight or hissing. Galen Gallen.lib.de Theriaca. Pliny says it
is twelve fingers long, and nine inches. 1.8.c.21.
describes it: and so do Solius and others. It is not half a foot long, and
has three pointells ( Galen says) on the head, or after Solinus, strakes like
a Mitre. It blasteth the ground it touches, the Herbs, and trees, and
infecteth the air, that birds flying over fall dead. It frayeth a way other
Serpents with the hissing. It goes upright from the belly upwards. If any
thing be slain by it, the same also proves venomous to such as touch it.
Only a Weasill killes it. The Bergameni bought the carcass of one of them at
an incredible sum, which they hung in their Temple (which Apelles hand had
made famous) in a Net of Gold, to preserve the same from birds and Spiders.
The Catoblepas is said to be of like venomous nature, always going with her
head into the ground, her sight otherwise being deadly. As for the monsters,
that by mixed generations of unlike kinds Nature unnaturally produces lo.
Baptistu Porta, etc.
I leave to others discourse. Leuinus Lemnius de occultis.14.c.12.
Lemnius tells, that of the marrow in a man's backbone is engendered a Serpent;
yea of an Egg which an old Cock will lay after he is unable to tread Hens
any longer, is (says he) by the same Cocks sitting, produced a basilske: and
tells of two such Cocks at Zirizea, killed by the people, which had found them
sitting on such Eggs.

Ostriches keep in companies in the Deserts, making shows a far off as if
they were troops of Horsemen: a ridiculous terror to the Carauans of
Merchants: a foolish Bird, that forgets his Nest, and leaves his Eggs for
the Sun and Sands to hatch, that eats any thing, even the hardest Iron:
that hears nothing: They have Eagles, Parots, and other Fowls. But none more
strange then that which is termed Nisr, bigger then a Crane, preying upon
Carrion, and by his flight burieth his great body in the clouds that none may
see him, whence he espyeth his prey: and lives so long that all his feathers
fall away by age, and then is fostered by his young ones.

Other fowls they have too tedious to relate. Grasshoppers do here often renew
the Egyptian plague, which come in such quantity that they intercept the
shining of the Sun like a cloud, and having eaten the fruits and Leaves,
leave their spawne behind (worse then their predecessors) devouring the very
barks of the Leafe-lesse Trees. The old depart none knows whither: and
sometime with a South-East wind are carried into Spain. The Arabians, and
Lybians eat them before they have spawned, to that end gathering them in the
morning, before the Sun have dried their wings, and made them able to fly.
One man can gather four or five bushels in a Morning. P. Oros.l.5.c.11.
Orosius tells that once they had not only eaten up Fruits, Leaves, and Bark,
while they lived, but being dead, did more harm: for being carried by a wind
into the Sea, and the sea not brooking such morsels, vomiting them up again on
the shore, their putrified carcasses caused such a plague, that in Numidia died
thereof eight hundred thousand: and on the Sea coast near Carthage and Vtica,
two hundred thousand: and in Vtica it self thirty thousand soldiers, which
had been mustered for the Garrisons of Africa. In one day were carried out of
one gate one thousand and five hundred carcasses. They are said to come into
Barbary seven years together, and other seven not to come, at which times
corn before so dear, is sold for little, and sometimes not vouchsafed the
reaping, such their soil and plenty. The juice of the young is poison. Aluares
in his 32. and 33. Chapters, tells of these Grasshoppers in Aethiopia, that in
some places they made the people trusse up bag and baggage, and seek new
habitations where they might find victual: The Country all desert and
destroyed, and looking as if it had snowed there, by reason of the vnbarked
Trees, and the fields of Mais, the great stalks whereof were trodden down, and
broken by them: and in another place a Tempest of rain and Thunder left them
more then two yards thick, on the Rivers banks. This he saw with his eyes.

But the studious of Natures rarities in these parts may resort to Leo, and
others, as also for their further satisfaction in the Fishes and Monsters of
the water; as the Hyppopotamus, in shape resembling a horse, in bigness an Ass:
The Sea Kine, lesser then the land Kine, the Tartaruca a tortuise, which lives
in the Deserts, of huge bigness, etc,

The people which inhabit Africa are Arabians, Mores, Abissines, Egyptians,
and diverse sorts of the Heathens, differing in rites from each other, as shall
follow in our discourse. The Monsters which Pliny and others tell of, besides
Munster and Sabellieus out of them, I neither believe, nor report.

CHAP. II.
Of Egypt and of the famous River Nilus: and her first Kings, Temples, and
Monuments, according to Herodotus, Diodorus, and others.

AFter our general view of Africa, Egypt may justly challenge the principal
place in our African discourse, as being both in situation next to Asia (whence
we are lately come) and consequently from thence first peopled; besides that
Religion, our Load-Starre, has here found the soonest and solemnest
entertainment. And not in Religion alone, but in Polity, Philosophy, and
Arts, the Graecious Iamblichus.
which would seem the first Fathers of these things have been Disciples to the
Egyptians, as Am.M.l.22.D.S.l.1. Plin.de Os. and is. Volat.l.12. Lact.l.4.c.9.
Hieron.ad Paul.
Am. Marcellinus and D. Siculus, Plutarch, and many others affirm. Hence
Orpheus, Musaus, and Homer fetched their Theology; Lycurgus and Solon their
laws; Pythagoras, Plato, Anaxagoras, Eudoxus, Democritus, Daedalus, here
borrowed that knowledge for which the world has ever since admired them. Let
it not then be imputed to me as a tedious officiousness, if I longer detain
the Reader (otherwise delighted with the view of those rills which hence have
flowed among the Greek and Latin Poets and Philosophers) in surueying these
Egyptian Fountains and well-springs, whence have issued especially a deluge
of Superstition, that in elder times drowned all the neighboring parts of the
world. Nor let it be tedious unto us to behold (in this historical Theater)
those Egyptian Rarities; the sight whereof has drawn not Philosophers alone,
but great Princes too, and mighty Emperors, to the undertaking of long and
dangerous iourneyes: As Aelian.Spart.Seuerus.
Seuerus, who though he forbade Iudaisme and Christianity, yet went this
Pilgrimage, in honor of Serapis, and for the strange sights of Memphis,
Memnon, the Pyramides, Labyrinth etc. Vespasian also and others did the like.

The name of Egypt (says Antiq.l.1.c.6. Broughtons Concent.
Josephus) is Mesre, of Misraim, the son of Cham, and the Egyptians of
themselves Mesraei. So the Arabians at this day call it (as Leo Ie. Leo l.8.
affirms) but the inhabitans they call Chibth. This Chibth they say was he
which first ruled this Country, and built houses therein. The inhabitants also
do now call themselves thus: yet are there not now left any true Egyptians,
save a few Christians: the Mahumetans having mingled themselves with the
Arabians and Africans. The Turks D. Chylr.
call both the country it self, and principal City ( Cairo) by the name of
Misir. The name Egyptus is derived from Aegyptus brother of Denaus after the
common account: as others say, of Ai Copti, the land of Copti, (a chief City
of Egypt) so Lydiat and some others.
Ai and Copti.

Egypt has on the East, the gulf, and some part of Arabia; on the South the
falls and mountains of Aethiopia; on the West, the Deserts of Libya; on the
North, the Mediterranean Sea: all which Nature has set not only as limits,
but as fortifications also to this Country. Nilus runs through the midst
thereof, threescore miles from Cairo making by division of himself that Delta,
to which some appropriated the name of Egypt, refuted by Jupiter Ammon, whose
Oracle (says Herodotus) reckoned all that Egypt, which Nilus ouerflowed.
Ptolomaus Ptol.li.4.c.54.
numbreth three of those Deltas. Touching the head of Nilus; Bredenbachius (as
Adrichomius cites him) affirms, that many Soldans have sent men on purpose
furnished with skill and provision for the Discovery, who, after two or three
years, returning, affirmed that they could find no head of this River, nor
could tell any certainety, but that it came from the East, and places not
inhabited: both of like truth. For indeed this River arises (as by late
discoueries is found) out of a Lake in twelve degrees of Southerly Latitude,
out of which not only this River runs Northwards into the Mediterranean,
but Naire also, Westward, Zuama, and Spirito Santo Eastward into the Ocean, as
is said: all ouer-flowing their Territories in the same time and from the same
cause. What this cause should be, many both old and later writers have labored
to search. Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny, and Solinus, have lent us the
conjectures of Antiquity herein: Ph.Pigafetta.l.2.c.vlt.apud Ram.
Fracastorius and Ramusins, have bestowed their discourses on the Subject, as
Goropius also and others of later years have done. The most probable cause is
the raynes, which Gorop. Gorop.in pecees. Niloscopium.
in his Niloscopium, deriueth from a double cause. For the Sun, in places
near the line does show more mighty effects of his fiery presence, exhailing
abundance of vapors, which in terrible showers he daily repaieth, except some
Natural obstacle do hinder (as in someplaces of Peru Acosta.hist.Ind.
where it seldom or never raineth:) And hence it is, that the Indians both
East and West, and the Africans, reckon their Summer and Winter otherwise then
in these parts of the world: for this time of the suns near presence with
them they call Winter in regard of these daily storms: which he seems to
recompense them with other six months continual serenitie and fair weather;
not then raising (by reason of his further absence) any more exhalations then
are by himself exhausted and consumed, which time for that cause they call
Summer. Goropius therefore out of his conjectures tells us of a two-fould
Winter, under both Tropikes at the same time; under Cancer the rainie Winter,
which in manner (as ye have heard) attendes on the same; under Capricorn the
Astronomicall Winter in the Suns absence, where also he supposes it to rain
at that time by reason of the high hills there situate, and the great Lakes,
which minister store of moisture, besides that Cancer is then in the house of
the Moon. Again, the Winds P.Pigafetta. l.^.^.^.
Etesij (that is to say ordinaris every year) in their annual course, every
Winter lift up the clouds to the tops of the hills, which raelt them into
rain, whereby all the Rivers in Aethiopia are filled: and cause those
ouer-flowings, which in Nilus is strangest, because it is in Egypt, furthest
off from the raines that cause it. The like ouerflowing is common to many other
Rivers; as to Niger, in Africa; to Menan of Pegu; and the River of Siam in
Asia; and to the Rivers of Amazones, and Guiana in America. Friar Luys Historia
de la Etiopia.l.^.c.28.
de Vrreta ascribes the ouerflowing to some secret passages and pores, whereby
the Ocean and the Mountains of the Moon hold mutual commerce. This increase
of Nilus begins about the midst of June, continuing forty days, after
which follows the decrease as long. In the middle of Nilus, (says Leo Lib.8.
Leo) over against the old City of Cairo, stands the I Will Michias, or the
measuring I Will, containing one thousand, and five hundred Families, and a
Temple, and a foure-square Cisterne of eighteen cubits depth, whereinto the
water of Nilus is conuaied by acertaine sluice under the ground, in the midst
whereof is a pillar marked also with eighteen cubits, to which Officers for the
purpose resort daily from the 17. of June, to observe the increase, which if it
amount to fifteen Cubits, and there stay, it does portend fertility, and how
much over or under, so much less abundance. In the mean time the people
devoutly exercise prayer and almes-giuing: And after, the price of victuals,
(especially of Corn) is proportionably appointed for the whole year. The
Cities and Towns of Egypt, whiles this inundation lasts, are so many Islands.
And thus says Herodotus, The land of Egypt does not only owe the fertility,
but her self also, unto the slimie increase of Nilus: for Rain is infectious
if at any time it fall in Egypt: except in and about Alexandria, where
Pigasetta says it raineth. Terra suis contenta bonis, non indiga mercis, Aut
Iouis, in solo tanta ^^^^ fiducia Nile. Lucea^.Bell. Sac.l.^.19. Nilus solus ex
amnibus vniuersis nullas expirat auras.Solin.
rain is a stranger in this Country seldom seen, and yet ostner then
welcome; as unwholesome to the inhabitants. But Goropius reasons largely in
confutation of the opinion of Herodotus. The mouths or falls of Nilus,
numbered by the Prophet Esaias Isay 11.15.
and other in old times, seven, and after Pliny (who reckons the four
smaller) eleven: are now (as Willielmus Tyrins out of his own search
testifies) but four, or, as other writers, but three worthy of consideration,
Rosetto, Balbitina, Dameiata, where the saltnes of the earth, and shelles found
in it, may seem to confirm Herodotus opinion, that Nilus has won it from
the Sea. Egypt was anciently divided into Thebais, Delta, and the region
interiacent: and these subdivided into six and thirty Nomt, which we may call
shires, whereof Tanite and Heliopolite were the assignement of Jacobs family

also witnesses. The wealth of Egypt, as it proceeds from Nilus, so is it
much increased by the fit conueyance in the natural and hand-laboured
channells Sesostris, Ptolomai, Traiani sossa.
thereof. Their harvest begins in April, and is threshed out in May. In
this one Region were sometimes (by Herodotus and Plinies report) twenty
thousand Cities: Diodorus Diod.lib.1.
Siculus says eighteen thousand: and in his time, three thousand. He also was
told by the Egyptian Priests, that it had been governed about the space of
eighteen hundred years, by the Gods and Heroes; the last of whom was Orus:
after whom it was under kings until his time, the space almost Olymp.180.
of fifteen hundred years. To Heredotus they reported of three hundred and
thirty kings from Menas to Sesostris.

The Scripture, whose Chronology conuinceth those lying Fables, calls their
Kings by one general name, Pharao (which some Morn deuer.fos Antiq libr.3.ca.2.
interpret a Savior, Josephus says signifies Authority) and makes ancient
mention of them, in the days of Abraham. Some begin this royal Computation
at Mizraim. If our Berosus which Annius has set forth were of authority,
Pseudo-Berosiu.
he tells, that Cham, the son of Noah, was by his father banished for
particular abuse of himself, and public corruption of the world, teaching
and practicing those vices, which before had procured the Deluge, as sodomy,
incest, buggery: and was therefore branded with the name Chemesenua, that is,
dishonest Cham, in which the Egyptians followed him, and reckoned him among
their Gods, by the name of Xenoph.de aquiuocu, calls Cham Saturnus
Aegyptius.c Psalm.75.and108.
Saturn, consecrated him a City called Chem Min. The Psalms Psalm.75.and.108.
of David do also thus entitle Egypt, the land of Cham: which name was

days. Chemmis after Diodorus was hallowed to Pan, and the word signifies
Pans City: in Herodotus his time it was a great town in Thebais, having in it
a Temple of Perseus, square, and set round with Palme-trees, with a huge Porch
of stone, on which were two great statues, and in it a Chapel, with the Image
of Perseus. The Inhabitants want not their miraculous Legend, of the
Apparitions of their God, and had a relic of his, a sandale of two cubits
which he sometimes ware. They celebrate festival games in his honor, after
the Greek manner. Herodotus also mentions an Island called Chemmis, with the
Temple of Apollo in it.

Lucian Lucian.Dis sir.
says, the Egyptians were the first that had Temples, but their Temples had
no Images. Their first Temples are reported Diod.Sic.li.1
to have been erected in the times of Osiris and Isis, whose parents were
Jupiter and Juno, children to Saturn and Rhea, who succeeded Vulcan in this
Kingdom. They built a Magnificent Temple to Jupiter and Juno, and two other
golden Temples to Jupiter Calestis, and Jupiter A^^^, or Cham, which we before
spoke of, instituting unto them Priests and golden Statues. Menas is reckoned
the first King after those Demigods Mors.de vera Christ.rel.ca.26.
who built a Temple to Vulcan, and taught the people to sacrifice, and other
rites of Religion. Long after him, Busiris built Thebes, which was said
Herodot.li.^.
to have a hundred Gates, and many stately erections of Temples, Colosses,
Obeliskes; by the one Name they call their more then Giantly Images; by the
other, their Pillars of one stone, fashioned like a Needle. Of four Temples,
there was one containing in circuit thirteen furlongs, in height five and
forty cubits, the wall four and twenty foot thick. Cambyses robbed it.
Amongst the seven and forty Sepulchers of their Kings, that of Simandius was
reckoned most sumptuous, the gates whereof were two hundred foot long, and five
and forty cubits high: within was a square Cloister, containing in each square
four hundred foot, borne up with Statues of Beasts in stead of Pillars, of
sixteen cubits, the Roof made of stones, of two paces broad, beautified with
Stars. Then was there another gate like to the former, but fuller of work,
with three huge Statues to himself, his mother, and daughter. Within this was
another Cloister, more beautiful then the former. This cost, although it might
happily be enlarged in the telling, yet does not disagree to that Egyptian
opinion, esteeming their houses their Innes, and their Sepulchers their etern
all Habitations. Of the race of Simandius was Ogdous, that built In 69.51. and
19.50
Memphis (called in the Scripture Noph) compassing a hundred and fifty
furlongs, at the parting of Nilus, into that Delta-diusion, where the
succeeding Kings abode, forsaking Thebes, till Alexandria was after built by
Alexander.

Thebes was called Diospolis, or Jupiters City, where (as Strabo St.lib.17.
reports) was consecrated to Jupiter a beautiful Virgin of noble birth, who,
until the time that she had her natural purgation, had the carnal company
of whomsoever she pleased, and at this her menstruous accident was bewailed as
dead, and after married. Such Virgins the Greeks (says he) called Pallades.
Many years after Ogdous, succeeded Sesostris. Josephus Antiq.lib.8.4.
is of opinion, That Herodotus erred in the name, and ascribed the deeds of
2.Chron.12.9.
Shishak to Sesostris; to which also the computation of Herodotus does agree
reasonably in the time. Volater.li.12.Lud.Reg.libr.4.
Others account him the same with Sesachis in Diodorus. The huge Conquests of
this Sesostris are beyond all that ever Alexander achieved, if we credit
Authors. At his return he builded in every City of Egypt a Temple to their
chief God at his own costs; and offered a ship of Cedar, two hundred and
eighty cubits in length, filuered on the inside, gilded on the outside, to
the chief god at Thebes, and two Obeliskes one hundred and twenty cubits high,
wherein were engraven the greatness of his Empire and revenues. At Memphis in the
Temple of Vulcan he dedicated Statues of himself and his wife, thirty cubits
high, of his children twenty. And when he went to the Temple, or through the
City, his Chariot was drawn by Kings, as Lucan sings: Venit ad Occasum
mundique extrema Sesostris;
Et Pharios currus Regum cernicibus egit.

Tacitus Annal.2.15.
tells of Rhamses an Egyptian King, who conquered the East and South parts of
the world, helped herein, (as the Priests told Germanicus) with the forces of
Thebes, who had then seven hundred thousand fighting men. This was written in
Egyptian Characters at Thebes, interpreted by one of the Priests, together with
his revenues not inferior to the Roman or Parthian Empires. Pheron, the son
and successor of Sesostris, enraged at the rage of Nilus, swelling above
eighteen cubits, cast a dart against the stream, Her.lib.2.
and thereupon lost his sight, which by the advice of the Oracle in Butis, was
restored by the urine of a woman, which had never known man but her husband:
which caused him to burn his own wife and many other, failing in this new
experiment, and to marry her whom at last he found by this proof to be honest.
He set up in the Temple of the Sun two Pillars, each of one stone of 100
cubits high, and eight broad. After, succeeded Memphites, Rhamsinitus, and
Cheopes. This last shut up all the Temples in Egypt, and busied them in his
own works, one hundred thousand by course ten years together, in building a
Pyramid for his Sepulcher. The least stone was thirty foot, and all graven.
Nilus passes under it by a trench. It was reckoned among the Wonders of the
World. His daughter and brother made two other; odious therefore to the
Egyptians, who will not once name them. Bellon.l..2.c.42.
Bellonius out of his own sight reports, that the Pyramides (vet remaining)
do exceed that which Histories have related of them. He measured one of the
four squares of one of them, which contained three hundred and four and
twenty large paces. This was hollow, the other solid. They did it (says he)
in hope of the resurrection. For they would not interre their dead bodies,
because of the worms; nor burn them, because they esteemed Fire a living
creature, which feeding thereon, must together with it perish. They therefore
with nitre and cedar thus preserve them. Some also report, Gi.Bot.^^^
That they used hereunto the slimie Bitumen of the dead Sea, which has
preserved an infinite number of Carcasses in a dreadful Cave (not far from
these Pyramides) yet to be seen, with their flesh and members whole, after so
many thousand years, and some with their hair and teeth. Bellonius thinks
the fables of Lethe and Styx to have flowed from that Lake, by which the dead
bodies were brought hither. Of these is the true Mummia. Not far hence is
that Sphynx, a huge Colosse, with the head of a Maid, and body of a Lion,
supposed by Bellonius to be the monument of some Sepulcher. It yet continues
all of one stone, and is a huge face, looking toward Cairo. The compass of the
head, says P. Martyr, Leg.Bab.lib.3
an eyewitness, is 58. paces. Plmy Lib.36.ca.12.
numbreth ^^^. Pyramides and says, That the compass of this Sphynx, about the
head, was 102. foot, the length 143. 360000 men were 20. years in making one
of the Pyramides, and three were made in 78. years and four months. The
greatest (says he) covers eight acres of ground; and Bellonius affirms,
That the Pyramides rather exceed then fall short of the reports of the
Ancient, and that a strong and cunning Archer on the top is not able to shoot
beyond the fabric of one; which Villamont being there, caused to be tried and
found true. But I would be loath to bury the Reader in these sumptuous
Monuments, the witnesses of vanity and ostentation; of which, besides the
Ancient, Martyr, Bellonius, Euesham, Villamont, and other eyewitnesses have
largely written.

Mycermus is reckoned the next King, better beloved of his subjects, whose
daughter was buried in a wooden Bull in the City Sai; to which every day were
odors offered, and alight set by night. This Ox once a year was brought out to
the people. Next to him was Asychis, who made a Pyramid of bricks; and these
bricks were made of earth, that claue to the end of a pole for this purpose, in
a vain curiosity thrust into a lake. Yet were all these wonders exceeded by
the Labyrinth, the work (say some) of Hons.Cos.li.3.

Herodotous says he saw the upper rooms, the lower he might not, as being the
Sepulchers of the Founders, and of the sacred Crocodiles: all was of stone, and
graven. The lake of Maeris was not less wonderful, compassing 3600. furlongs,
and 50 fadom in depth, made by Maeris, whose name it bears. In the midst were
2. Pyramides 50. fadom above, and as much beneath water, one for himself, the
other for his wife. The water flows 6 months out, and 6 months in, from Nilus.
The fish were worth to the kings coffers twenty of their pounds a day the first

Nilus to the red sea, which Strabo ascribes to Sesostris. Pli. Plm.li.6.c.29
makes Sesostris first author, seconded by Darius, who in this business was
followed by Ptol. 100. foot broad, 37. miles long; but forced to leave the
enterprise, for fear of the red sea ouerflowing Egypt, or mixing his water
with Nilus. Reg.23.29.


Tremellins thinks it to be the labor of the Israelites, in that servitude,
from which Moses freed them. He consumed in this work 120000. Egyptians. After
him reigned Sammi, and then Apries. About these times Anton.Galux.
Nabuch. conquered the Egyptians, according to Ezech. prophecy, Ezec.30. But
they had also civil wars. Amasis Philostrat.de vita Apollon.lib. 5.ca.^^^.
says that Apollonius, seeing a Lion (which one had tamed) offer to fawn on
him, withal, uttering certain murmurings; interpreted that speech of the Lion
to the people, saying, that be sometime had been Amasis the Egyptian King:
whereupon he was sent with pompous procession of the Priests, to Leontopolis,
and there placed in the Temple.
deprived Apries, who, being of a base birth, of a great basin of gold in which
himself and his guests had used to wash their feet, made an Image, and placed
it in the most convenient part of the city; and observing their superstitious
devotion thereunto, said that they ought now no less to respect him,
notwithstanding his former base birth and offices. When he was a private man,
to maintain his prodigal expenses, he used to steal from others: and when
they redemaunded their own, he committed himself to the censure of their
oracles. Such oracles as neglected his thefts, he being a king, did neglect. He
brought from the city Elephantina 20 days sailing, a building of solid stone,
the roof being of one stone, 21 cubits long, 14 broad, and 8 thick, and
brought it to the Temple at Sai. He ordained, that every one should yearly give
account to the Magistrate, how he lived, and maintained himself. Psammenitus
his son succeeded, whom Cambyses deprived.

CHAP. III.
Of the Egyptian Idols, with their Legendary Histories and Mysteries.

IF we stay longer on this Egyptian Stage, partly the variety of Authors may
excuse us which have entreated of this subject, partly the variety of matter,
which, adding some light to the Divine Oracles, (not that they need it, which
are in themselves a light 2.Pet.t.19.
shining in a dark place; but because of our need, whose owly eyes can not so
easily discern that light) deserve a larger relation. For whether the
Histories of the Old Testament, or the Prophecies of the New be considered,
both there literally we read of Egyptian rites practiced, and here mystically
of like superstitions in the Antichristian Synagogue revived, therefore
Apoc.II.8.
called spiritually Sodom and Egypt. No where can Antiquity plead a longer
succession of error; no where of superstition more multiplicitie; more blind
zeal, in prosecuting the same themselves, or cruelty in persecuting others
that gains aied. Oh Egypt! wonderful in Nature, whose Heaven is brass, and
yet thine Earth not Iron, wonderful for Antiquity, Arts and Arms, but no way
so wonderful, as in thy Religions, wherewith thou have disturbed the rest of
the world, both elder and later, Heathen and Christian; to which thou have
been a sink and mother of Abominations. Thy Heathenisme planted by Cham,
watered by Iannes, Iambres, Hermes, ouerflowed to Athens and Rome: Thy
Christianisme, famous for many ancient Fathers, more infamous for that Arrian
heresy, which rising here, eclipsed the Christian light; the world wondering
and groaning to see it self an Arrian: I speak not of the first Monks, whose
egg, here laid, was fair, and beginnings holy: but (by the Devils brooding)
brought forth in after-ages a dangerous serpent: Thy Mahumetisme entertained
with like lightness of credulity, with like eagernes of devotion, no less
troublesome to the Arabian Sect in Asia and Afrike, then before to the Heathens
or Christians in Europe. The first Author (it seems) of this Egyptian, as of
all other false Religions, was Cham (as before is said) which had taken deep
rooting in the days of Joseph the Patriarch, and in the days of Moses; their
Priests Gen.41.8. Exodus1 7.
Wisemen and Soothsayers, confirming their devotions with lying miracles, as
the Scriptures testify of Iannes and Iambres; and Her.Asc.lep.
Hermes Trismegistus, of his grandfather and himself. The Grecians ascribe
these devotions to Osiris and Isis: of whom the History and Mystery is so
confused; that Typhon never hewd Osiris into so many pieces, as these vain
Theologians, and Mythologians have done. They are forsooth in the Egyptian
throne, King and Queen: in the heavens, the Sun and Moon: beneath these,
the Elements: after Herodotus, they are Bacchus and Ceres: Diodorus makes
Osiris the same with the Sun, Serapis, Dionysius, Pluto, Ammon, Jupiter:
Isis, the Moon, Ceres and Juno. In Macrobius and Servius she is the nature of
things; he, Adonis and Atis: Plutarch adds to these Interpretations Oceanus
and Sirius, as to Isis, Minerua Proserpina, Thetis. And if you have not enough,
Apulcius will help you, with Venus, Diana, Bellona, Hecate Rhamnusia: and
Heliodorus nearer home, makes Osiris to be Nilus, the Earth Isis. So true is
it that l.Cor.8.4. Io. 4 12.
an Idol is nothing in the world, and Idolaters worship they know not what.

But to search this fountain further, you may read the Egyptian opinion in
Diodorus, Diod.Sic.li.1.
how that the world, being framed out of that Chaos, or first matter, the
lighter things ascending, the heavier descending, the Earth yet imperfect, was
heated and hardened by the Sun, whose violent heat begat of her slimie
softness certain putride swellings, covered with a thin filme, which being
by the same heat ripened, brought forth all manner of creatures. This muddy
generation was say they) first in Egypt, most fit, in respect of the strong
soil, temperate air, Nilus ouerflowing, and exposed to the Sun, for to
beget and nourish them: and yet retaining some such virtue. at the new flaking
of the river, the Sun more desirous (as it were) of this Egyptian Concubine,
whom the waters had so long detained from his sight, ingendring in that
lustful fit many Creatures, as mice and others, whose forepartes are seen
moving before the hinder are formed. These newly-hatched people could not but
ascribe Divinity to the Author of their humanity, by the names of Osiris and
Isis, worshipping the Sun and Moon, accounting them to be Gods, and
everlasting: adding in the same Catalogue, under disguised names of Jupiter,
Vulcan, Minerua, Occanus, and Ceres, the five Elements of the world, Spirit,
Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. These eternal Gods begot others, whom not
Nature, but their own proper merit made immortal, which reigned in Egypt,
and bare the names of those celestial Deities. Their Legend of Some think that
this Osiris was Mizraim the son of Cham.Morn.
Osiris, is, that he having set Egypt in order, leaving Isis his wife
governor, appoynting Mercury her Counselor (the inuenter of Arithmetike,
Music, Physic, and of their superstition) made an expedition into far
countries, having Hercules for his General, with Apollo his brother, Anubis
and Macedon his sons, (whose Ensigns were a Dog and a Wolf, creatures
after for this cause honored, and their counterfeits worshipped) Pan, Maron,
and Triptolemus, and the nine Muses attending with the Satyrs. Thus did he
invade the world, rather with Arts, then Arms; teaching men husbandry in many
parts of Asia and Europe, and when Vines would not grow, to make drink of
barley. At his return, his brother Typhon slew him, rewarded with like death
by the revenging hand of Isis and her son Orus. The dispersed pieces, into
which Typhon had cut him, she gathered and committed to the Priests, with
iniunction to worship him, with dedication unto him of what beast they best
liked, which also should be observed with much ceremony, both alive and dead,
in memory of Osiris. In which respect also Lactant.lib a
they observed solemnly to make a lamentable search for Osiris with many
tears, making semblance of like toy at his pretended finding, whereof Lucan
sings, Nunquamque satis quaesitus Osiris; always seeking (says Lactantius)
and always finding. To establish this Osirian Religion she consecrated a third
part of the land in Egypt for maintenance of these superstitious rites and
persons: the other two parts appropriated to the King, and his soldiers. This
Isis, after her death, was also deified in a higher degree of adoration then
Osiris self. One thing is lacking to our tale, which was also lacking a long
time to Isis in her search. For when she had with the help of wax made up of
six and twenty parts, which she found so many Images of Osiris, all buried in
several places: his priuities, which Typhon had drowned in Nilus, were not
without much labor found, and more solemnity interred. And that the devil might
show how far he can besot men, the Image Arnob. contr Gent lib.5.aliam resort

hereof was made and worshipped; the light of this darkness shining as far
as Greece, whose Phallus, Phallogogia, Ishiphalli, Phallophoria, and Phallophon
issued out of this sincke, together with their membrous monster Priapus.

tells of Ptol. Philadelphus in a solemnity wherein he listed to show to the
world his madness; or (as it was then esteemed) his magnificence (a place
worth the reading to them, who are not here glutted with our tedious Egyptian
banquet) he among many sumptuous spectacles presented a Phallus is the image
of a man's yard.
Phallus of gold, painted, with golden Crowns, of one hundred and twenty
cubits length, having a golden star on the top, whose circumference was six
cubits. This was carried in a Chariot, as in others the Images of Priapus,
and other Idols.

that brazen Table (supposed to have been some Altar-couer) after possessed by
Card. Bembus, full of mystical Characters, explaned by Laurentius Pignorins in
a Treatise of this Argument, may further acquaint the desirous Reader. Diodorus
thinks this the cause why they consecrated Goats, and erected Images of
Satyrs in their Temples; affirming that their Priests are first initiated in
these bawdie rites. Their canonized beasts, of which the Egyptians and Syrians,
(says De Not. Deorum. lib.1.
Tully) conceived stronger opinions of Devotion, then the Romans of their most
sacred Temples, were Philo. Jud. de december praec. Ios.cont.App.
Dogs, Cattes, Wolves, Crocodiles, Ichneumaons, Rams, Goats, Bulls, and
Lions, in honor of Isis: their sacred Birds were the Hawke, Ibis,
Phanicopterus: besides Dragons, Aspes, Beetles, amongst things creeping: and of
fishes, whatsoever had scales; and the Eele. Yea their reason did not only to
sensible things ascribe Divinity, but garlike and onions were free of their
Temples, derided therefore by Iuuenal.

think the Hebrews were in such abomination to the Egyptians, that they
would not eat with them, as eating and sacrificing those things, which the
other worshipped. Example whereof Diodorus an eyewitness tells, that when
Ptolomey gave entertainment to the Romans, whose friend he was declared; a
Roman, at unawares having killed a Cat, could not by the Kings authority,
sending Officers for his rescue, nor for fear of the Romans, be detained from
their butcherly fury. For such was their custom for the murder of those
sacred creatures, to put to death by exquisite torments him that had done it
wittingly, and for the Bird Ibis and a Cat, although unwittingly slain. And
therefore if any epsy any of them lying dead, he stands aloof lamenting
and protesting his own innocence. The causes of this blind zeal, were the
metamorphosis of their distressed Gods into these shapes; secondly, their
ancient Ensigns; thirdly, the Tusc.Qu.li.5.
profit of them in common life. Origin Orig.contra Celum lib.4.
adds a fourth, because they were used to divination, and therefore (says
he) forbidden to the Israelites as unclean. Eusebius out of the Poet cites a
fifth cause, namely, the Divine Nature diffused into all creatures, after that
of the Poet: Deum namque ire per omnes
Terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum.
God goes through Sea, and Land, and lofty Skies.


I might add a sixth, that metempschosi or transanimation which Pythagoras (it
seems) here honored. If I might, with the Readers patience, I would add
somewhat of their Mystery of iniquity, and the mystical sense of this
iniquity. For, as many have sweat in unfolding the mysteries of that Church,
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, as Ambrosius de Armariolo,
Amalarius, Durandus, Durantus, and others: so here have not wanted mystical
Interpreters, Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Plutarch and the rest. Such is the
deepnesse of Satan in the shallowness of humane both reason and truth. Water
and Fire they used in all their Sacrifices, and do them deuoutest worship
(says Apud Eusebius. de Praep.li.3.c.2.
Porphyry) because those Elements are so profitable to man's use: and for this
use sake they adored so many creatures: at Anubis they worshipped a man. But
especially they held in veneration those creatures which seemed to hold some
affinity with the Sun. Even that stinking Beetle or Scarabee did these more
blind then Beetles in their stinking superstitions observe, as a living Image
of the same, because forsooth, all Scarabees are of male sex, and having shed
their seed in the dung, do make a ball thereof, which they roll to and fro
with their feet, imitating the Sun in his circular journey. Eusebius
follows this Argument in the several beasts which they worship: but to avoid
tediousness, I leave him, to look on Plutarchs pains in this Argument. De
Os. and Is.
He makes Isis to be derived of the verb (...) to know, as being the Goddess
of Wisdom and Knowledge: to whom Typhon for his ignorance is an enemy. For
without Knowledge Immortality it self could not deserve the name of Life, but
of Time.

Their Priests shaued their own hair, and ware not woollen but linen
garments, because of their professed purity, to which the hair of man or
beast being but an excrement, disagreed: and for this cause they rejected
Beeues, Mutton and Porke, as meats which cause much excrements. Yea their Apis
might not drink of Nilus, for this rivers fatning quality, but of a fountain
peculiar to his holiness. At Heliopolis they might not bring wine into the
Temple, holding it unseemly to drink in the presence of their LORD. They had
many purifications wherein wine was forbidden. Their Kings, which were also
Priests, had their sacred stints of wine; and did not drink at all before
Psametichus time, esteeming wine to be the blood of them, which sometime warred
against the gods, out of whose slain carcasses Vines proceeded, and hence
proceeds drunkenness, and madness by wine. Their Priests abstain from all
fish: they eat not Onions, because they grow most in the wane of the Moon,
they procure also tears and thirst. Their Kings were chosen also either of the
Priests, or of the soldiers; and these also after their election, were
presently chosen into the College of Priests. Osiris signifies many eyes, in
the Egyptian language. Os, is much, and Eri, an eye. The Image of Minerua at
Sai, had this inscription, I am all, which is, which has been, which shall
be, whose shining light no mortal man has opened. Ammon (...). Opifex

they call Am (the same as is before said with Ham or Cham the son of Noah)
in the vocative case, as inuocating him, whom they hold the chief GOD of the
world, to manifest himself. They esteemed children to have a divining
faculty, and observed the voices of children playing in the Temples, and
speaking at adventure, as Oracles, because Isis seeking after Osiris, had
enquired of children. They interpret Astronomically the Dog-starre to belong to
Isis; the Bear, to Typhon; Orion, to Horus.

The Inhabitants of The bais acknowledged nothing for GOD which was mortal;
but worshipped Cneph, which they said, had neither beginning nor ending. So
many are the interpretations in their mystical Theology, that Truth must
needs be absent, which is but One: and these may rather seem subtle fetches of
their Priests, to gull their people, then the true intents of their first
authors of Idolatry. Because Typhon was of red color, they consecrated red
Bulls, in which yet there might not be one hair black or white. They esteemed
it not a sacrifice acceptable to the gods, but contrary, as which had received
the souls of wicked men: and therefore they cursed the head of the sacrifice,
which they hurled into the river: and since have used to sell to strangers. The
devil happily would teach them an apish imitation of that sacrifice of the red
Cow, Numb. 19. The Priests abhor the sea, as wherein Nilus dies; and salt is
forbidden them, which they call Typhons spittle. In Sai, in the Porch of
Mineruaes Temple^, was pictured an Infant, an old man, a Hawk, a Fish, and a
Seahorse. The mystery was, O ye that are borne, and die, GOD hates
shameless persons. The Hawk signified GOD, the Fish hatred, the Seahorse
impudency.

By their Osiris and Typhon, they signified the good and evil, whereof we have
not only vicssitudes, but mixtures, in all these earthly things. And here
Plutarch is large in showing the opinion of these wisemen, which when they saw
so much evil, and knew withal that good could not be the cause of evil,
they imagined two beginings, one whereof they called GOD, the other Devil: the
good, Orimazes; the bad, Arimanius. This opinion is fathered on Zoroastres,
Betwixt these two was Mithres, whom the Persians called a Mediator. So the
Chaldaeans had among the Planets, two good, two bad, three of middle
disposition. The Grecians, their Jupiter and Dis, and Harmonia begotten of
Venus and Mercury. Empedocles called the one Friendship, the other Discord:
the Pythagoreans Vid.Soc.lib. I.cap.17.
call the good, One, bounded, abiding, right, square, etc. The other,
Duplicitie, infinite, moved, crooked, long, etc. Anaxagoras, the mind and
infiniteness; Aristotle, Form and Privation. Plato, the Same, and Another.
Hence appears how true it is, that I.Cor.2.14.
the Naturallmen perceive not the things of GOD, nor can know them: and hence
grew the Manichaean heresy.

the deformity and defect of things, Plutarch ascribes to Typhon (whom they
also called Seth, Bebon, and S^^y, says Pignorius) that which is good, to

ascribed to that fable of Io, which some say is Isis.
, to this the matter, to him the form. In the Town of Idithya they burned
living men, whom they called Typhonians, scattering their ashes, and bringing
them to nothing. This was openly done in Dog-daies. But when they sacrificed
any of their sacred beasts, it was done closely, and at uncertain times. He
that would further be acquainted with these mysteries, let him resort to
Eusebius and Plutarch. Iamblichus has written a large Treatise, De Mysterijs,
where the more curious Reader may further satisfy himself. He mustereth in
their ranks and order, first the Gods, then Arch-angles, next Angels, then
Daemones, after them Heroes, Principalities and Souls in their subordinate
orders. Marsilius M. Fic. in lamb. translated according to Proclus.
Ficinus does thus dispose his Egyptian mysteries, or mystical opinions of
GOD. The first in order is, Vnum Super Ens. The second, Vnum Ens, or Vnitas
Entis. The third, Intellectus Intelligibilis, Prima Icthon. The fourth, Emeph,
the Captain of the heavenly Deities. The fifth, Captain of the workmen of the
world, the understanding of the soul of the world, called Amun, Phtha, Vulcan
Osiris. But these ways are too rough, cragged and thornie for a dainty
traveler: they that will, may read Iamblichus, Proclus, Porphyrius,
translated by Marsilius Ficinus.

Mercurius Trismegistus (so called, GenesisDier. lib.2. cap.8.
because he was thrice greatest King, Priest, and Philosopher) was (says
Lact.lib.1.c.6.
Lactantius) called Thoth or Thoyth, of whom they named their first month,
acknowledging to have received their laws and letters from him. He built the
City Hermopolis, and of the Saits was honored for a god. Of him also Augustine
De Ciuit, 'Dei.lib.8. cap.26. illustrated by the Annotations of Vines, will
further acquaint you.

Fran. Patrici^ Zoreaster.
Franciscus Patricius (as he has taken great pains, out of Psellus, Ioannes
Picus, and others, for the opening of the Assyrian, and Chaldaean opinions, and
has collected three hundred and twenty Oracles, and sacred sentences of
Zoroaster, so he) has with F. P. Her. Trismegist. Gracolat
no less industry published twenty books of Hermes or Mercury Trismegistus.
He affirms that there were two of that name, the one Grandfather to the
other: the elder of which was counselor and instructor of Isis, and the
scholar of Noah. He had a son named Tat, which begat the second Hermes, which
Hermes had a son also called Tat, by which likeness in name great confusion and
vnlikelihoods have happened in history. This second Hermes (he supposes)
lived in the days of Moses, but was somewhat more ancient. Both the elder and
younger were writers, as he shows out of their works: and called Trismegists,
not for that he was greatest King, Priest, and Philosopher, as Ficinus, says,
nor for their clear sentences touching the Holy Trinity, but (as the French
use the word thrice, for the Superlatiue) as men thrice or most excellent in
learning. The same Patricius has set forth three Treatises of Asclepius: of
which name were three learned Egyptians, Asclepius Vulcani, inuenter of
Physike, Asclepius Imuthes, inuenter of Poetry, and another which had no
sur-name, to whom Asclepius de sole and damonib. l.^.
Hermes dedicated some of his books; and the same Asclepius in the beginning
of his first book, calls himself the scholar of Hermes. In the writings of
these Egyptians, translated into Greek, and explaned by the Egyptian
Priests, the Greek Philosophers, especially the Platonikes and Pythagoreans,
learned their Divine, Moral, and Natural Philosophy. Antiquity and Learning
hold us longer in these men's company; the more curious may have recourse to
their own works. Twenty thousand books are ascribed to Hermes: some say
thirty six thousand five hundred twenty five.

He in his Asclepius, Asclep.cap.9.
translated by Apuleius, thus writes. Egypt is the Image of heaven, and the
Temple of the whole world. But the time shall come when the Aegyptia^ devotion
shall prove vain, and their piety frustrate: for the Divinity shall return
to heaven, and Egypt shall be forsaken of her gods. And no marvel, seeing
that these gods were Idols, the works of men's hands, as himself Cap.13.

or coniured into them the souls of devils or angels, by which the Images
might have power to do good or evil. For thy Grandfather, O Asclepius, says
he was the first inue^ter of Physike, to whom is a Temple consecrated in a
mountain of Libya, where his worldly man (his body) rests: for the rest or
rather his whole self is gone to heaven, and does now heal men by his Deity,
as then by his Physike. The same does This might be that Mere. of whom Tully

willing Reader learn further of their superstitions, which he thus freely
confesses in that Author, whose prophecy, GOD bethanked, by the bright and
powerful Sunshine of the Gospel, was long since effected.

CHAP. IIII.
Of the Rites, Priests, Sects, Sacrifices, Feasts, Inventions; and other
observations of the Egyptians.

THus far have we launched out of their History, into their Mysteries. To
return to the relation of their Beasts and bestiall superstitions. Lucian
Lucian. de Astrologia.
says, That this Apis represented the Celestian Bull, and other beasts which
they worshipped, other signs in the Zodiake. They that respected the
Constellation of Pisces, did eat no fish, nor a Goat, if they regarded
Capricorn,. Aries a heavenly Constellation, was their heavenly devotion: and
not here alone, but at the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon. Strabo lib.17.
Strabo says, That they nourished many, which they accounted sacred, but not
gods. This nourishment, after Diod. Sic.l.1.
Diodorus, was in this sort: first they consecrated unto their maintenance
sufficient lands. Such Votaries also as had recovered their children from some
dangerous sickness, accustomed to shave their hair, and putting it in gold or
silver, offered it to their Priests. The Hawks they fed with gobbets of flesh,
and birds catched for them. The Cats and Ichneumons, with bread, and milk,
and fish: and likewise the rest.

When they go their Processions, with these beasts displayed in their Banners,
every one falls down and does worship. When any of them dies, it is
wrapped in fine linen, salted and embalmed with Cedar and sweet ointments,
and buried in a holy place, the reasonlesse men howling and knocking their
breasts, in the exequies of these unreasonable beasts. Yea, when famine has
driven them to eat man's flesh, the zeal of devotion has preserved untouched
these sacred Creatures. And if a Dog die in a house, all in that household
shave themselves, and make great lamentation. If Wine, Wheat or other food be
found, where such a beast lies dead, superstition forbids further use of
it. Principal men, with principal meats, are appointed to nourish them in the
circuit of their Temples.

They bathe and anoint them with odoriferous ointments. And they provide to
every one of them a female of his own kind. Their death they bewail no
less, then of their own children: In their funerals they are exceeding
prodigal. In the time of Ptolomaeus Lagi, these Apis or Bull of Memphis being
dead, the Keeper bestowed ou his funeral, over and above the ordinary
allowance and offerings, fifty talents of silver borrowed of Ptolomey. And in
our age, says Diodorus, an eyewitness of these his relations, some of these
Nourishers have bestowed an hundred talents on this last expense. After the
death of this Bull, which they call Apis, was made a solemn and public
lamentation, which they testified by shauing their heads, although their purple
locks might compare with those of Nisus, says Luc.de Sacra.
Lucian: and after his burial Solin.Am.Marc.
were an hundred Priests employed, in search of another like the former; which
being found, was brought to the City Nilus, and there nourished forty days.
Then they conveyed him into a close ship, having a golden habitacle, in which
they carried him to Memphis, and there placed him in the Temple of Vulcan for a
god. At his first coming Euseh. praepar. Euang.lib.2.c.1.
only women were permitted to see him, who I know not in what hellifh
mystery, lifting up their garments, showed him Natures secrets, and from
thence-forth might never be admitted the sight of him. At his first finding,
the people cease their funeral lamentations. At his solemn receiving into
Memphis, they observe a seventh days festival, with great concourse of
people. His consecration was done by one wearing a Diadem on his head. They
made the people believe he was conceived of lightning. He Strabo l.17.
had a Chapel assigned to him, and called by his name. He was kept in a place
enclosed, before which was a Hall; and in that another enclosed room, for the
Dame or Mother of Apis. Into this Hall they brought him, when they would
present him to strangers. Psammetichus was the founder of this building, borne
up with collosses, or huge statues of twelve cubits, instead of Pillars, and
graven full of figures. Once a year Solinus. Plutarch.
he had sight of a female, chosen by especial marks, and slain the same day.
On a set day, which he might not outliue, according to their rituall books,
they drowned him in the bottom of a sacred fountain: and then buried him as
aforesaid, with much mourning. After this solemnity it was lawful for them to
enter into the Temple of Serapis. Darius to curry favor with the Egyptians,
offered an hundred talents to him that could find out a succeeding Apis. Of
this Apis, thus writes De Ciuit.Dei.lib.18.cap.5.
Augustine. Apis was the King of the Argiues, who sailing into Egypt, and
there dying, was worshipped by the name of Serapis, their greatest god. This
name Serapis was given him (says Varro) of his funeral Chest called in Greek
(...), and from thence Sorapis, as if one should say, Sorosapis, after Serapis.
It was enacted, that whosoever should affirm, that he had been a man, should
be done to death. Hence it is, that in the Egyptian Temples Harpocrates, an
Image holding his finger on his mouth, is joined a companion to Isis and
Serapis, in token of concealing their former humanity. Suidas Suidas.
says, that Alexander built unto him a magnificent Temple, of which, and of
this Serapis we shall largely declare in the next Chapter. Viues out of
Nymphoderus says, that this carcass in that Chest, whereof the name Serapis
was divided; was of a Bull, not of a man. Eusebius Eusebius. Chron.
names two Kings called by this name Apis, one a Sicyonian, the other of
Argos: the first more ancient; the other the son of Jupiter and Niobe, called
after Serapis. But Apollodorus affirms him the son of Phoroneus, and brother
of Niobe. and therefore the Sicyonian King is more likely to be the Egyptian
Apis, builder of Memphis: for the other (says Scal.in Eus.
he) died in Peloponnesus, which of him was called Apia. The marks Viu. in
Aug. de Ciu Dei. lib. 13.cap.5.
of the next Apis were these; All his body was black, with a white star in
his forehead, after Herodotus, or in his right side, says Pliny, like unto a
horned Moon. For he was sacred to the Moon, says Marcellinus. On his back he
had the shape of an Eagle, a knot on his tongue like a Beetle. If such an one,
might seem to some impossible to be found, as no doubt it was rare, and
therefore costly; Augustine Vbi supra.
attributes it to the devils working, presenting to the Cow in her conception
such a fantastical apparition, the power of which imagination appears

But what a beastly stir have we here (me thinks I hear some whining
Reader say) about beasts Varijsq, coloribus Apis. Ovid. Met 9.
and Bulls. I answer that it deserves the more full relation, both for the
multitude of Authors, which mention something of this History, for the
antiquity, and especially for the practice of the same superstition, Bulling.

in Aarons and Ieroboams Calves, after their return from Egypt, the school
of this Idolatry. Besides this Apis of Memphis, they in other places observed

Moon: with his hairs growing forward, worshipped at Heliopolis. Bacis Macrob.
another that was fained to change color every hour, at Hermunthus besides
Onuphis, and Menuphis other where. Thus by sin beasts became gods, men
became beasts, if this be not a baser degree of baseness to worship beasts,
and in them devils: to content themselves with mean houses, and never to be
contented with the magnificence and sumptuousnes of their Temples to beasts.

We are further to know, that although Egypt worshipped beasts, yet not all,
the same: These Strabo lib.17. Stuckius de sacris sacrificijsque Gentilium, de
his fusion.
only were universally received: three beasts, a Dog, a Cat, a Bull: two
fowls; the Hawk and the Ibis: two fishes; Lepidotus and Oxyrinchus. Other
beasts have their sects of worshippers; as a Sheep among the Thebans and
Saits; the fish called Latus among the Latopolitans: a Cynocephalus at
Hermopolis (which is a kind of great Ape or Monkie naturally circumcised, and
abhorring from fish) a Wolf at Lycopolis. The Babylonians near to Memphis,
worshipped a beast called Cepus, resembling in the face a Satyr, in other
parts, partly a Dog, partly a Bear: likewise other Cities, other beasts, which
caused great distention, whereof Iuuen. Sat.15.

Strabo saw, in the nomus or shire of Arsinoe, diuino honot given to a
Crocodile, kept tame in a certain lake by the Priests, and named Suchus,
nourished with bread, wine, and flesh, which the Pilgrims that came to visit
him offered. Now the Tentyrites, and those of Elephantina killed Crocodiles.
And in the City of Hercules they worshipped an Ichneumon, a beast that
destroys Crocodiles and Aspes, and therefore even at this day of much
estimation, as Bellonius P. Bell. ob.
observes, where you may see his description. These imagined that Typhon was
transformed into a Crocodile. At Hermopolis they worshipped a Goat: and Goats
had carnal mixture with women. Volat.
The Ombites (more beastly) esteemed themselves favored of their Crocodile
god, if he filled his paunch with the flesh and blood of their dearest
children. King Menas built a City called Crocodile, and dedicated the
neighbour-fenne to their food. They were as scrupulous in the use of meats:
some Diodor.Sic. lib.1.
abstained from Cheese, some from Beans, some from Onions, or others after
their own fancy. This multiplicitie of sects is ascribed to the policy of
their ancient Kings, according to that rule, Divide and Rule. For it was not
likely they would join in conspiracy, whom Religion (the most mortal
makebate) had disioyned.

They held Serpents in so sacred account, L. Pig.men's. Isiac.exp.
that Osiris is never painted without them: and Iosophus Ios.cont.Ap.lib.2.
says, That it was reckoned a happiness (which I think few would envy them) to
be bitten of Aspes, as also to be devoured of Crocodiles. Venomous was that old
Serpent, which both here, and in other Nations, then, and at this day, has
procured divine honor to this first instrument of Hell: As if he would thus
exalt this trophee of his ancient conquest, in despite both of GOD and Man, in
that Creature whereby man perished, and which GOD had cursed: except we will
rather attribute it to a devilish malice, or apish imitation of that brazen
Serpent set up by MOSES John 3.14.
in the wilderness, the figure of CHRIST crucified, who brake this Serpents
head. Jeremy the Prophet was stoned (some Vines in August.
say) at Tanis in Egypt, and was after worshipped of the Inhabitants there
(such was their difference of Sects) for his present remedying the Stings of
Serpents.

I think by this time, either my relation, or their superstition is tedious:
and yet I have not mentioned other their gods, both stinking and monstrous.
Loath am I to search the waters for their deified Frogs, and Hippopotami, or
play the scauenger, to present you with their Beetle-gods out of their priuies:

and farts had their unsavory canonization, and went for Egyptian Deities;
lettice suitable to such lips. Less brutish, though not less Idolatrous, was
it in Ptolomaeus Philopator, Ael. Var.lib.13.cap.22.
to erect a Temple to Homer, in which his Image was placed, comely sitting
environed with those Cities which challenged him for theirs.

Their sacrifices were so diuersified in their kinds, that Peucer Peuc. de
Diuinat.
says, They had six hundred three score and six several sorts of them: some
they had peculiar to special gods, Sard.lib.3.15.
as to the Sun, a Cock, a Swanne, a Bull; to Venus, a Dove; to the
celestial signs, such things as held correspondent similitude. Besides their
sacrifices of red men to Osiris. Busiris Tristesque Busiridis ara^
is said to have offered Thrasius (first author of that counsel, worst to the
counselor) thereby to appease angry Nilus, that in nine years had not
ouerflowed. They offered every day three men at Heliopolis, instead of which
bloody Rites Amasis after substituted so many waxen Images.

Thus were their gods beastly, their sacrifices inhumane, or humane rather too
much: Other things they observed of their own invention, framing to themselves
deformed and compounded shapes, whose Images they adored. Such were their
Canopi, swadled as it were in clouts (so resembling Orus) with heads of Dogs
or other creatures. Osiris Tab. Isiaca Bembi.
is sometime seen with the head of a Hawk, Isis with the head of a Lion,
Annbis always with the head of a Dog, and contrariwise beasts pictured with
the heads of Osiris and Isis: monstrous misshapen figures, of misshapen monstrous
mysteries.

They borrowed of the Jews abstinence from Swines-flesh and circumcision of
their males, to which they added excision of their females, still observed of
the Christians in those parts. They so abhor Swine, Herod.lib.2.
that if one by the way touch them, he presently washes himself and his
garments. Neither may a Swineheard have access into their temples or marry
with their daughters. Yet do they offer wine to the Moon and Bacchus ( Isis
and Osiris) when the Moon is at full. In this sacrifice they burn the tail,
milt and leaf: and (which on another day would be piacular) on that day of the
full they eat the rest. The Egyptians Drus.de 3. sectis lib.2.
swear by the head of their King, which oath, whosoever violated, lost his life
for the same, without any redemption.

Their Priests in old time renowned for their learning, in Straboes time were
ignorant and unlearned. No woman Io. Bocm.lib.1.cap.5.
might bear Priestly function. These Priests might not eat eggs, milk, or
oil (except with sallads) they might not salute mariners, nor look upon their
children or kinsfolks. They Sard.l.3.c.18. Herod lib.2.
washed themselves in the daytime thrice, and in the night twice: they were
shaven, ware linen garments always new washed, were daily allowed sacred
meats. Du Bartas Colonies.
Of their ancient Priests, thus Du Bartas sings in Sylusters tune; The
Memphian Priests were deep Philosophers,

And curious gazers on the sacred Stars;
Searchers of Nature, and great Mathematickes,
Ere any letter knew the ancient'st Attickes.
When they sacrificed, they made choice of their Beasts by certain religious
marks: (a Cow they might not sacrifice, as consecrated unto Isis:) they
kindled a fire, and sprinkling water over the sacrifice, with invocation of
their God killed it, cut off the head, which either they sold to the Graecians,
if they would buy it, or cast into the River, with imprecation, That whatsoever
evil was imminent to them or their country, might be turned upon that head.

been as liberal of their rites since to the Catholics (for so they will be

speaks of Gymnosophists, which some ascribe to India; Heliodorus to
Aethiopia; he to Aethiopia and Egypt. These, says he, dwelt abroad without
house, on a hill a little off the banks of Nilus, where grew a Grove, in which
they held their general Aslemblies, to consult of public affairs, having
otherwise their studies and sacrifices apart, each by himself. Thespesion was
the chief of this monkish College, when Apollonius after his visitatio^ of the
Babylonian Mag^, and Indian Brachmanes. Domitiano imperatore.
came thither. These held the immortality of the soul, and accounted Nilus for
a god. If a man at Memphis had by chance-medly killed a man, he was exiled till
those Gymnosophists absolved him.

Hercules Temple at Canopus was privileged with Sanctuary, to give immunity to
fugitives, and malefactors: thus elsewhere Osiris; Apollo, in Syria; Diana, at
Ephesus; every Cardinals house (says Pius 2 Asia.
a Pope) in Rome; Saint Peter, Pol. Vir.l.3.
at Westminster; and other Popish Oratories, privileged dens of thieves.

Their Feasts were many: of which, Herod. lib.2.
Herodotus reckons one at Bubastis, in honor of Diana. To this place the men
and women, at this festival solemnity, sailed in great multitudes, with
Minstrelsie and shoutings; and as they came to any City on the waters side,
they went on shore, and the women, some daunced, some played, some made a
brawle with the women of the place: and thus resorting to Bubastis, they there
offered great sacrifices, spending in this Feast more Wine then in all the
year besides. Hither resorted of men and women, besides children, seven
hundred thousand. In Busiris was solemnized the Feast of Isis, in which, after
the sacrifice, many thousands beat themselves: but with what they did beat
themselves, was not lawful to relate. The Carians that inhabited Egypt did
also cut their forheads with swords, signifying thereby, that they were
foreiners. This City was in the midst of the Egyptian Delta, and in it, a
very great Temple of Isis. A third Feast was at Sai, in honor of Minerua,
where assembling, by night they lighted candles full of Salt and Oil, and
therewith went about the walls of the City: This solemnity was called ^^^
Light-burning, or if you will, Candlemasse. This night they which came not
hither, yet observed the setting up of lights throughout Egypt. A fourth was at
Heliopolis, in honor of the Sun. A fist at Butus, of Latona, wherein only
sacrificing was used. At Papremus was observed the solemnity of Mars, with
sacrifices, but till Sunne-set, only a few Priests were busied about the Image:
a greater number of the^ stood before the doors of the Temple with wooden
clubbes, and ouer-against them above a thousand men that paid their vows, each
with clubbes in their hands, who the day before carried the Image out of a
gilded Chapel of Timber into another sacred room; those few which were
chosen for the Idoll-seruice, drawing a Wagon with 4. wheels, on which the
Chapel and Image were carried. Those that stood at the Porch, forbad these to
enter; but the Votaries, to help their God, beat and drove them back. Here
began a great clubbe-fray, in which many were wounded, and many (although the
Egyptians concealed it) died of the wounds. The cause (forsooth) was because
here was shrined the mother of Mars to who^ her son, at ripe age, resorted to
have lain with, but was repelled by her servants: whereupon, he procuring help
elsewhere, was revenged of them. Hence grew that solemnity.

On the 7. day of the month Tybi Hospin. de F. st. c. 7.
(which answers to our January and December) was solemnised the coming of
Isis out of Phenscia; in which many things were done in despite of Typhon. The
Captites then hurled down and Ass from a steep place, and abused ruddie men
for this cause. They had Plut. ^^^
also, in their Bacchanall-solemnities, most filthy Rites, in which being
drunken, they carried Images of a cubit length, with the pnuie member of a
monstrous size, with Music, accopanied with the elder Matrons. This yard,
which they called Phallus, was usually made of Fig Tree. Herodotus, l.2.
says, That besides their Swine-Feast they observed another to Bacchus, without
Swine, in like sort as the Grecians: in which, they had cubitall Images made of
sinews, or, as Coelius Coel. Rhod l.^^. 16.
reads it, made to be drawn to and fro with sinews or strings, carried by
women. In the month Thoth (which most-what agrees to September) the 19. day
Plut. ibid.
was holy to Mercury, in which they did eat Honey and Figs, saying withal,
Truth is sweet. On the 9. day of this month they observed another Feast,
wherein every man before his door did eat roasted Fish: the Priests did not
eat, but burn the same. Before was mentioned the seeking of Osiris, always
sought (says Lactantius) and always found. This was an Egyptian Feast
observed in the month Athyr (which answers some what to November) from the
seventeenth day (in which they imagined that Osyris perished) four days were
spent in mourning: the causes were four; Nilus slaking, the Winds then
blowing, the Days shortening, the Winter approaching. Here is the mystery
unfolded. On the nineteenth day they went by night to the Sea, and brought
forth a sacred Chest, in which was a golden Box, into which they poured water,
and made a shout, That Osyris was found. Then they mingled the Earth with
Water, adding Spices and costly Perfumes, and made an Image of the Moon,
applying these mystical Rites to the nature of the Earth and Water. About the
Winter Solstice they carried a Cow seven times about the Temple Hosp. c.27.
, in remembrance of the Suns circuit, which in the 7. month would be in the
Summer Solstice.

The original of Isis seeking Osiris, is before showed. Some make Typhon the
husband of Isis, which slew Osiris her son, or brother (as diverse diversely
esteem him) for Incest committed with her, and cut him in pieces. Anubis her
Huntsman, by help of his dogs, found out the pieces again. This (says
Minutius M. F.octav. Arnob. contra gentles, l.2.
Felix) is resembled every year, Nec desinunt annis omnibus vel perdere quod
inneniunt vel innenire quod pordunt. Hac Aeptia quonda^ nunc and sacra Romana
sunt. Truly the Plays of CHRIST his Crucifying and Resurrection, which is
observed in all Churches of the Romant Religion yearly, might seem to have
had this Egyptian original. Once, Index expurgatorius has cut out Viues
Tongue, where he speaks against them, in annot. Aug. de Crv. Dei, cap.vlt.
This Feast is also mentioned by Julius Firmius and others.

They had another Feast called Pamylia, of Pamyle the nurse of Osiris, who
going to fetch water, heard a voice, bidding her proclaim, That a great King
and Benefactor, was borne. On this holiday was carried in Procession an Image
with three stones, or (as Plutarch de Osir.
says) with a threefold yard, in which beastly Rite he finds a foolish
mystery, not worth the telling. But I think this Feast of Feasts has glutted
every man.

The Egyptians had many Oracles of Hercules, Apollo, Minerua, Diana, Mars,
Jupiter, and others. The Oracle of Latona at Butys Peucer de Diuinat.
told Cambyses, That he should die at Ecbatana, whereby he secured himself for
Syria, and yet there died, in an obscure village of that name, whereas he had
interpreted it of the great City in Media. Their Apis and Serapis were also
esteemed Oracles. Annibal was deceived by the Oracle of Serapis, telling him of
his death, which he construed of Libya, and fell out in a place of the same
name in Bithynia. At Memphis a Cow, at Heliopolis the Bull Mneus, at Arsinoe
the Crocodiles were their Oracles. But it were too tedious to relate the rest.

Geometry is more like to be theirs, driven to seek out this Art by Nilus

Lactantius:) for lying on the roofes of their houses (as yet they do) without
any other Canopie then the Azure Sky, first they beheld, then studied, lastly
adored them. Magic is also ascribed to them; of whose timely professors
Iannes and Iambres are an instance. Physic is fetched also from hence; and

accounts Mercury the first inuenter of their Laws. The women in Egypt did
perform the offices which belonged to the men, buying, selling, and other
business abroad; the men spinning and performing household-taske. This Elogie
or commendation is given them by Martial:

Niliacis primum puer hic nascatur in oris,
Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis:
From Egypt (sure) the boys birth may proceed,
For no Land else such knauerie can breed.
And Propertius: Noxia Alexandria dolis aptissima tellus,
The place where Alexandria does stand,
Is noisome, and a Conny-catching Land.
We may here add out of Flauius Vopiscus Flav. Vopisc. Saturninus. Trebellius
Pollio testifies the like in his Triginta Tyranis.
a testimony of the qualities of the Egyptians. They are (says he)
inconstant, furious, braggarts, injurious; also vain, licentious, desirous of
novelties, even unto common Songs and Ballads, Versifiers, Epigrammatists,
Mathematicians, Wisards, Physicians both for Christians and Samaritans; and
always things present, with an unbridled liberty, are distasteful to them. He
brings also, for witness of this assertion, Aelius Adrianus, who in an
Epistle to Servianus, affirms thus.

I have learned all Egypt to be light, wavering, and turning with every blast
of fame. They which worship Serapis, are Christians, and even they which call
themselves Bishops of CHRIST, are devoted to Serapis.

No Ruler is there of the Jewish Synagogue, no Samaritan, no Christian Priest,
which is not a Mathematician, a Wizard, a Surgeon (or annointer of
Champions.) This kind of men is most seditious, most vain, most injurious:
The City (Alexandria) rich, wealthy, fruitful, in which none lives idle.
Goutie men have somewhat to do, blind men have somewhat to do, or have
somewhat which they may make; nor are the goutie-fingered idle. They have one
GOD; him do the Christians, him do the Jews, him do they all worship. I
wish them nothing else, but that they may be fed with their own Pullen,
which how they make fruitful, I am ashamed to tell. Thus much Adrinaus.

The Pullen he speaks of, it seems, are such, as even to this day they use
to hatch (not under the Hen, but) in furnaces of dung and ashes, wherein
thousands of Eggs are laid for that purpose. That which he speaks of the
Christians, is either of some Heretics, or lukewarm Time-seruers to be
understood: or else remember, that it was Adrian, an Ethnicke, whose
intelligence was from such as himself, in those times hating the Christians;
of whom, through blind zeal of their Idolatry, what did they? What did they
not feign and deuile? Even more odious then here is expressed, as
Ecclesiastical Histories show. The Jews had given Adrian cause, by their
Treasons, to hate them, and flatterers opportunity to belie them. Let him that
loves me, tell my tale.

But a man would marvel to hear Adrian blame the Egyptians so much for that,
for which himself in Authors is so much blamed; namely, Superstition and
Sorcerie. For he made Images of Antmous, which he erected almost in all the
World, says Dionis Nicai Adr.
Dion. This Antinous was in high estimation with him (some think, his minion:)
He died in Egypt, either drowned in Nilus, as Adrian writes, or (which is the
truth) was sacrificed. For whereas Adrian was exceeding curious, and addicted
to Diuinations and Magical Arts of all kinds (in the hellish Rites whereof
was required the Soul of such a one as would die voluntarily) Antinous refused
it not, and therefore was thus honored, and had a City in Egypt newly
repaired from the ruins, and dedicated in his name. Yea, Aelius Spa^tianus in
Adriano.
he reported he saw a new Star, which (forsooth) was the Soul of this
Antinous. The Greeks made a God of him, and a giver of Oracles.

Ammianus Marcellinus Am. Marc. l.22.
ascribes to the Egyptians a contentious numour, addicted to lawing and
quarrels, assuetudine perplexous litigands semper laetissimum.

Their vanity and superstition may further appear by that which Diophantes
Diophantes Lacedem. apud Stuckium de saecris.
records of one Syrophanes, a rich Egyptian; who doting on his son yet
living, dedicated an Image in his house unto him, to which the servants at any
time, when they had displeased their Master, betook themselves, adorning the
same with Flowers and Garlands, so recovering their Masters favor. Some
Coelius Rhodig. Lectionum antiq. l.16.3.
make the Egyptians first inuenters of Wine (which, they say, was first made in
the Egyptian City Plinthis) and of Beer, to which end they first made Malt
of Barley, for such places as wanted Grapes.

When a man proved more in show then in substance (as hypoctites, whom the
Truth it self calls Whited Tombs) the Proverb termed him an Egyptian
Temple, because those buildings were sumptuous and magnificent for matter and
form to the view, but the Deity therein worshipped, was a Cat, Dog, or such
other contemptible creature.

The natural fury Polyb. Hist.l.15.c.31. Exodus.1. ^^^
and cruelty used amongst the Egyptians, has also made them infamous among
Authors, both Profane and Divine. But least I also should impose too cruel a
task on my more willing Readers, I will proceed to other observations. I have
here, in this Egyptian Relation of their Rites, Manners, and Mysteries, been
the larger, both because Authors are herein plentiful, and especially because
Egypt has been an old storer and treasurer of these mystical Rites for that
later vpstart, the Mystical Babylon, in the West; which, as she is spiritually
called Sodom and Egypt, so like that strumpet mentioned by Pro.7.10.
Solomon, has not a little decked her bed with the Ornaments, Carpets, and
Laces of Egypt. Wiser were the Romans Dion.Cass.l.54
of old, which made diverse Laws to expel the Egyptian Rites out of their
City, which the later Popes entertain.

CHAP. V.
Of the manifold alterations of State and Religion in Egypt by the Persians,
Graecians, Romans, Christians, Saracens, and Turks: with the Egyptian
Chronology, since the beginning of that Nation till our Times.

THe last Egyptian Pharao was Psamminitus, vanquished by Cambyses, son of
Cyrus the Persian, who quite extinguished that Egyptian Government, and much
eclipsed their superstitious solemnities. For Herod.l.3.
Cambyses proclaimed desiance, not to the persons only of the Egyptians, but
to their Gods also: yea, he set their sacred Beasts in the forefront of his
battle, that being thus shielded by their own devotion, he might easily
ruinate the Kingdom. Such a disadvantage is Superstition to her followers,
being indeed but a life-lesse carcass of true Religion, which always breeds
true Fortitude; as Ptolomey and the Romans used the like stratageme against
the Jews on their Sabbath, which (in it self a divine Commandment) they
construed to a superstitious Rest, a Sacrifice without Mercy, wherein they
might help their Beasts, but suffer themselves, like Beasts, to be led to
the slaughter.

Cambyses having pulled down their Temples in Egypt, intended Justin. l.1.
as much to the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon, in which Exploit he employed fifty
thousand men, which (as the Ammonians report) were ouer-whelmed with a tempest
of Sand. Other news of them was never heard. Himself meane-while, meanly
provided of victual for such an Enterprise, made an Expedition against the
Aethiopians; in which, Famine making her self Purueyor for the Army, fed
them with the flesh of each other; every tenth man being allotted to this
bloody service.

Thus with a double discomfiture altogether discomforted, he retyreth to
Memphis, where he found them observing their festival solemnity of the
Newfound Apis, and interpreting this joy to have proceeded from his loss, he
slew the Magistrates, whipped the Priests, commanded to kill the Citizens that
were found feasting, and wounded their Apis with his Sword, unto death. He
practiced no less hostility upon their Obeliskes, Scpulchres, and Temples:
The Sepulchers they esteemed Sacred, as their eternal Habitations: (and no
greater security could any Egyptian give unto his Creditour, then the dead
bodies of their Parents:) The Temples Strab.l.17. describes the form of their
Temples.
, every where accounted holy, here were many, and those magnificent.

At Memphis they had the Temples of Serapis, Apis, Venus, and the most ancient
of them all, of Vulcan, with the Pigmcy-Image of Vulcan in it, which Cambyses
derided: of Serapis at Canopus, where Pilgrims by dreams received Oracles: at
Heraclium, Sai, and Butis, to Latona; at Mendes to Pan; at Momemphis to Venus;
at Necropolis, Nicopolis, and other places, to other supposed Deities. Cambyses
also burned the Images of the Cabyrians, and the Temple of Anubis at
Heliopolis, whose stately building and spacious circuit Strabo describes, as
likewise at Thebes. They write, That after, as he was taking Horse, his sword,
falling out of the Scabberd, wounded him in the thigh (where he before had
wounded Apis) and slew him. Thucidol. 1.
In the time while the Persians enjoyed Egypt, the Athenians, by instigation
of Inarus, King of Libya, invaded Egypt, won Nilus and Memphis: but after
six years lost all again.

Ochus, one of his successors (called of the Egyptians, Ass) killed their
Apis, and placed an Ass in his room, which kindled such indignation in Bagoas
an Egyptian (one of his Eunuchs) that he murdered Ochus, whom he hurled to
be rent and torn of Cats, that this Beast, sacred to Isis, might revenge the
indignity offered to Apis. But this Eclipse of the Egyptian Superstition,
caused by this Persian interposition, had an end, together with that Monarchy.

sacrificing to their Apis, and solemnizing Games in his honor, but added
further glory to their Country, by erection of that famous City, named of

greatness of Alexandria. As for the devotion there Ruff. l.2.c.23.
Theod.l.5.c.22.
practiced, we may read in Russinus of the Temple and Image of Serapis, in
his time destroyed by Theophilus, successor to Athanasius, Bishop of
Alexandria.

This Temple was borne up with Vault-worke, with great lights and secret
passages, the space of an hundred steps: on the top whereof, round about,
were lofty Rooms, in which the keepers of the Temple, and they which made
themselves chaste (^^^) remained. Within these were Galleries, or Cloisters, in
squared ranks, and in the midst of all was the Temple, lifted up on costly
Pillars, and built of Marble. Post Capitolium nihil orbis terrarum cernit
ambitiosius, says Am. Marcell. l.22. Inter Serapidis templa celeberrimum apud
Alexand. Vetustiss, Memphi. boc fanum subire nec hospitib. nec sacerdotib.

another: Except the Capitol, the world has not a statelier Piece. Here was
the Image of Serapis, reaching with his right hand to the wall on one side,
with his left hand unto the other, being framed of all kinds of Wood and
Mettalls. It had on the East a little window so fitted, that when on a solemn
day the Image of the Sun was admitted to salute this Serapis, the iuggling
Priests so observed the time, that even then the Sunne-beames, through this
window, should seem to kiss Serapis. They had also another trick, by a
Lodestone placed in the Roof, to draw up the iron Image of the Sun, as if
it did then bid Serapis Farewell.

The superstitious Ethnickes had a Tradition among them, That if ever man's hand
did offer violence to that Image, the Earth should presently return, and
resolve it self into the first Chaos, and the Heavens would suddenly fall.
All this notwithstanding, a Christian souldior dismembered the same, and burned
Serapis openly, the Mice running out of his divided trunk.

Some (says Russinus) esteemed this Serapis to be Jupiter, and that he ware a
Measure ( Modius) on his head, as he which governed all things in measure, or
else, did liberally feed men with the Fruits of the Earth. Others coniectured
him to be Nilus; others, Joseph Oros.l.1.c.8. affirms, that of Joseph's act
Egypt is still witness unto his time, continuing the payment of the fist part
of their profits to the King.
, that fed Egypt in the seven dear years.

Others thought him to be one Apis, (a King in Memphis) who in the time of
famine, with his own store, supplied the peoples want: for which benefit they
built a Temple to him after his death, wherein they nourished an Ox, in
remembrance of him, whose Husbandry and Tillage had nourished them. This Beast
they called also Apis.

He Story of Yrannus, Saturnes Priest.
mentions the Temple of Saturn, whose Priest called Tyrannus (under pretense
of Saturnes commandment) would demand the company of what Lady he liked,
to bear the God company at night: which the husband did not much stick at,
esteeming it an honor to have a God his corriuall. But Tyrannus shutting the
woman into the Temple, by secret passages conveyed himself thither, into the
hollow Image of Saturn, in which he held conference a while with the woman,
and after by a deuife putting out the lights, satisfied his lust in committing
those works of darkness, which after being brought to light, caused the
Temples destruction.

They had Breast-plates of Serapis in every house, in the Walls, Entries,
Posts, Windows; in stead whereof they after fastened Crosses. The Cross in
the Egyptian Mysteries signified life to come. They had a tradition, That
their Religion should continue, till there came a Sign, in which was Life.
Socrat. l. 5.c.16.
And by this occasion many of their Priests were converted. Sozomen Sor.
l.7.c.15.
reports the same, That in purging of Serapis Temple at Alexandria, the
Cross, being found among other their Hicroglyphickes, was occasion of the
conversion of many unto the Christian Faith. This Niceph. l.12.26.
Theodor.l.5.22.Hist.trip.l.10.c.29.
Temple, and the Temple of Bacchiu, were turned into Christian Churches.

Olympius a Philosopher, with a company of seditious Ethnickes, fortified
themselves in Serapis Temple, and caused many by force to sacrifice: and when
the Christians burned their Images, he answered, That the Images were but
corruptible matter, but the Virtues, or Divine Powers, which inhabited them,
were fled to Heaven. This I thought to mention for their sakes, who to their
Image Worship have borrowed the like Heathenish plaster.

Ruffinus adds, That in destroying the Temples, they found Relics of their
bloody Superstition, the heads of infants cut off, with the lips gilded. The
devotion of Canopus was not inferior to that of Alexandria. Here, through the
subtletie of the Priest, the Chaldaeans were vanquished. For whereas they
challenged their God Fire to be the strongest, as devouring other Wooden and
Mettall-Gods, he conveyed an Earthen pot full of holes, which he had stopped
with Wax, and filled with water, into the Image: and when the Chaldaeans made
their fiery trial hereof, the Wax melting, the water issued, and quenched
the fire. Hence it is, that they made the Image of Canopus with feet and neck
short, and a Belly like a Barrel, or water-Vessell.

Tacitus Cor.Tac.l.4. c.35.
reports certain miracles wrought at Alexandria by the instigation of
Serapis: the curing of a lame and blind man, whom that God had moved to seek
this help at Vespasians hand; which he also performed. He consulting with
this Oracle, saw suddenly behind him in the Temple one Basilides, whom by
present inquiry he found to lie sick four score miles thence in his bed. The
name yet was an ominous sign to him of the whole Empire, as derived of ^^^ The
original of this God (says he) is by some imputed to Ptolomoeus Lagi, who
having in Alexandria erected Temples, and instituted religious rites, seemed in
his sleep to see a tall young man, warning him to send into Pontus, to fetch
thence his Image, suddenly after vanishing in a flame of fire. When the
Egyptian Priests could not satisfy him in the interpretation of these things,
Timotheus an Athenian, whom he had sent for to be chief Master of
Ceremonies, willed him to send to Sinope, wherein was an ancient Temple of
Pluto, having in it the Image of Proserpina. Ptolomey neglecting this; and with
a second Vision terrified, sent to Scydrothemis King of Sinope for the same;
being (in the way) further hereunto encouraged by the Delphian Oracle.
Scydrothemis protracting the business was by diseases and manifest anger of
the Gods, enforced to assemble and persuade his people to suffer the carrying
away of their God. But whiles they resisted this enterprise, the ambitious
Idol, without once taking leave, conveyed himself into the ship, which
also, together with himself, he made to arrive at Alexandria in three days,
where was this Temple built to him, in the place wherein sometime had stood I

sacrifices which they used to offer to the Sun. And thus was the state of
religion in Egypt during the co^quests of the Persians, Greeks, and Romans,
each rather seeking to settle here their Empires then opinions. But when the
Sun of Right consnes the Son of GOD, the Savior of man, appeared to the
World, he honored Egypt with his infancy, as after with a Religious conquest,
by weapons (not carnal) casting down the holds which these hellish spirits
had here so long possessed; thus fulfilling truly what Esaias had prophesied
and Mercury foretold. Alexandria became a Patriarchall Sea (the first Bishop
whereof was Saint Mark) enjoying in Lybia, Pentapolis, and Egypt, the same
power that the Roman Bishop had in Italy, by decree of the Con.Nic. Can.6.
first Nicene Council. Here also lived the first Heremites (the Hist. Tripar.

the sandy Deserts, by occasion on of those bloody persecutions wherein many
thousands lost their lives. Of these Eremites read Io. Cassianus and Severus
Sulpitius de vita Martin. l.3. But when as the Mahumetan Religion and arms
began first to peep into the World, Egypt Vincent Spec.li.24.
was made a slave to those superstitions under which it groneth till this day.

which was after built, two miles from hence, by one Gehoar, who of a Dalmatian
slave had been advanced to be a Counselor unto Elcain the Mahumetan Calipha,
and was General of his Army about the four hundred year of their Hegeira.

He walled it round, and built in it that famous Temple called Gemih Hashare,
as Hamrus had done before at Fustato. In this Town of Fustato stands the
Sepulcher of a famous Saint of their Sect, called Nasissa, of the line of
Mahomet, whose beautiful shrine the Schismatic Patriarchs of Egypt adorned
with silver lamps, carpets of silk and other precious ornaments. No Mahumetan

yearly oblations and alms here offered for the releese of the poor kindred
of Mahomet, and maintenance of the Priests that keep it, (which want not their
counterfeit miracles to delude the peoples zeal) amount to one hundred
thousand Sarassi. And when Zelim conquered Cairo, the lanisaries risling this
Sepulcher, found in it five hundred thousand Sarassi in ready coin besides
other riches. Some report that this Nafissa being a dame of honor, yielded her
body, without reward, to any that required the same, Pilgrim to Mecca apud Hak.

think her an honester woman. Fustato is reckoned as as suburb to Cairo,
containing (in Leo's time one thousand five hundred twenty six) five thousand
families: besides many Sepulchers adored of the fond people, which cover the
pauement with rich carpets. Hither resort every Friday great multitudes for
devotion, and bestow liberal alms: P. Mart. Leg. Bab.l.3.
They here sprinkle cold water with sweet herbs and leauie boughs.

Bulach is another Suburb of Cairo upon the banks of Nilus, of like distance,
and has in it four thousand families with stately Temples and Colleges. Beb
Eiloch stands a mile from Cairo, and has about three thousand families.
Gemeh Tailon was adorned by Tailon sometime governor of Egypt with a sumptuous
Temple and Palace. Beb Zuaila, another Suburb, contains twelve thousand
families. Cairo, it self within the Walls has not above eight thousand
families, and is full of stately and magnificent Temples. Here is an Hospital
built by Piperis, the first Sultan of the Mamalukes race: the yearly revenues
whereof amount to two hundred thousand Saraffi, or as some reckon, five hundred
ducats a day. It is open to all sick and diseased persons, and heir to all
that die there. The Plague is sometime so hot at Cairo, that there die twelve
thousand persons daily. This was the state of Cairo in Leo's time. Solomon Sal.

In this place, An. one thousand five hundred threescore and six, in the month

think also that Mecca will in short time be conquered by the Christians, and
her devotions shall be removed to Rosetto. Neander Neon. Or. Te^^^. Par.3.
his conceit is ridiculous, that Cairo should hold as much people as all Italy,
and that there are two and twenty thousand Temples. John Evesham out of their
own registers numbreth but two thousand four hundred: and though Cairo
considered together with these suburbs is great, yet is it not all the way
continued with houses and buildings, P.Mart.
but has Gardens also and Orchards between.

Alexandria is very unwholesome, as the grave of that Alexandria we before
mentioned. Under the foundations are great habitations, as if they were two
Alexandria's built one upon another. Under the houses of the City are cisterns
sustained with mighty Arches to receive the inundation of Nilus. When the
Saracens had spoiled it, it remained long desolate until a subtle Caliph
proclaimed that Mahomet had left great indulgences to such as would here
inhabit. And thus he replenished the City with inhabitants, building houses
for them, as he did colleges for the Students, and Monasteries for the
Religious. Here yet remains a little Chapel, wherein they say that the
high prophet, and King Alexander the great, lie buried: to which resort many
Pilgrims that adore the same, and bestow there their Alms. Thebes, that
sometime was so famous a City, contains not now above three hundred
families: and still retayneth some bones of the carcass of old Thebes, many
Pillars, Walls, inscriptions in Latin, Greek, and Egyptian characters.
Memphis, her next successor, is utterly ruinate. The Mahumetans entered Egypt
about Anno six hundred thirty seven. After, their state sinking under the
weight of it self (which is the ordinary sickness of greatness) they grew to
dissentions and sects, as is said in our Saracen History. For the seat of the
Saracenicall Caliphas being by Macamat removed to Bagdat, which he had

But in Elcains time, while he sought to win the East from the Caliph of

Egypt, where Gehoar had built Cairo. The Sect of Hali had before also prevailed
in Egypt, for which cause Nasissas father was forced to flee the Country, yet
this Sect after was restored by Asmulinus, and Solinus his son, first Caliph
of Egypt. But when the Western forces, under Godfrey of Bullen, grew terrible

Noradine of Damasco sent Saracon his son to help Sanar the Sultan against

makes the Egyptian Chaliphs to be Schismatic from their first entrance,
which was (as he says) in Anno, 703. which reigned in Egypt, four hundred
forty and seven years, of the profession of Hali. Curio writes otherwise, as
Read.l.3.c.2.
in their History we have showed. So also does Leo diffenting from ^em both,
a man learned in his own Religion. He says that the Caliph of Cairo had
continued two hundred and thirty years, when as Saladine slew him and
subjected himself to the Caliph of Bagdet^, the only Caliph then remaining.
This Saladine was Nephew to Saracon, who chased the Christians out of Syria.
His Children reigned after him, of which Melechsala was last, who first
invented the order of the Mama'ukes, which were Circassian slaves, bought in
their youth, and trained up to Arms, Arts, and Religion of the Saracens, whom
he made of his guard. But they slew their Master, and usurped the Kingdom to
themselves, always electing one of their company, the first of which Mamaluke
Kings was Turquemenius, who was slain of his fellow Cothus, and he of
Bendocader, who was also poisoned etc. Leo says, that Saladines Family reigned
a hundred and fifty years, and Piperis was (says he) the first-Mamaluke
King. Gampson Gaurus, and Tomumbeius, the last of these Kings were overthrown
by Zelim the Turk. Anno 1517. whose successors still hold Egypt, and have a
Bassa resident at Cairo, from whence was carried by water many ornaments to
Constantinople. The Caliph as at Bagdet, so here retained some spiritual
pre-eminence. So says P. Mart. Leg. Bab.3.
that the Caliph sells the Sultan this dignity at a price, and ascending the
Throne, does give unto the Sultan, there standing on foot, the absolute power
of life and death, and then descending disrobeth himself, attiring the Sultan
with the same robes. So it appears, that the name and power of the Caliph,
all the time of the Mamalukes (as the Ghost of it self) had some almost
breathless shadow left: the life and substance being in the Sultan. There is
(says Leo) in Cairo, and in all Egypt 4 Sects, differing from each other in
Canon and Civil aws, all Mahumetans. He which professes one of these sects,
cannot at his pleasure betake him to another, except being learned be show
reasons therefore. Each of these Sects has his peculiar Judge, from whom yet
lies an appeal to a higher Judge, being governor of the Sect called
Essafichia. Whosoever attempteth ought against the precepts of his own Sect,
is secretly punished by the judge thereof: And although the Priests of these
several Sects use differing Liturgies and rites, Example for Christians, in
ending Controversies of Religion.
yet do they not take one the other for enemies, with hatred or mutinies: but
if any question arise, learned men by conference debate the same. No man upon
pain of grievous punishment may reproach any of the four Doctors, first
authors of those four sects. There is one Sect of religious men in Cairo,
called Chenesia, which live upon horseflesh: therefore are lame Iades bought
and set up a fatting, and sold to these Chenesians, which sect is rise in all
Asia. There go certain women up and down the city crying, whose office is to
excise or circumcise the women, which is observed in Egypt and Syria, both by
the Mabumetans and Iacobite Christians. Neither have the Turks (although in
superstition by themselves acknowledged short of the Arabians and Egyptians)
been altogether idle in their deu^tion, which they testify by their
Pilgrimages, and Good works among Turks.
Almesworkes. Bellonius tells of one Turk that caused water to be brought
daily on Camels backs for the case of Travelers in that Desert space between
Alexandria and Rosetto. Egypt has in it many Jewish Synagogues, who speak the
Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Arabian, and Greek languages, and are great
Merchants. We have had amongst us Vagabonds, which call themselves Egyptians,
the dregs of mankind. Of these Egypt it self has, no less foreign to
them then to us. They wander (says Bellonius) through all the Turkish Empire,
and are cunning in Iron-workes. They seem to be Christians of Wallachia. Thus
we see the judgments of God by the Persians, Graecians, and Romans for their
pristine Idolatry: and a greater judgment for their haeresie, hatched by
Arrius, punished by a Saracenicall Apostasy.

Among the differing Sects of the Mahumetans, (of which we have spoken in the
third book) Africa, and specially Egypt, and herein Cairo most of all is
pesteredy with them, which may be called the naked, or the wicked Sect, roguing
up and down naked, and practicing their fleshly villainy, in the open sight of
the people, who yet hold them for Saints. Leo l.3.


The inst hand of divine justice, that when men forsake God, not Religion and
Truth alone, but reason, but sense shall also forsake them. As for the
Christians in Egypt, ye may read in the Histories Hist.Sar.G.Tyr. Fox Act.
and Mon.
of the Holy-land-warres, what attempts were often made by the Western
Christians against these unbelievers. Concerning the present state of
Christianity there, Leo, Boterus, G.Bot.Ben. Pory in Leon. Chytr. Chron.
and Master Pory in his additions to his Englished Leo, may acquaint you.
Besides, the foreign Christians, which resort to these parts for traffic
there, are thought to be fifty thousand Native of the country, which have
Churches, and Monasteries, whereof there are three Christian Churches at
Alexandria. They are called Cofti, and Christians from the Girdle, because of
their Circumcision, which together with Baptism they admit. In their Liturgy
they use the Chaldean language. But they read the Gospel again, in the
Arabian. They are accounted of Entiches haeresie. Their Patriarchall Sea is

which from Saint Mark to this day has had a continued succession, as
appears by the late Letters of Gabriel to the Pope, calling himself the
fourscore and seventeenth of the Patriarchs from Saint Mark. How Christian
Religion was first planted in Egypt by Saint Mark, and the Apostles, and their
successors, and how persecuted by the Ethnikes: after by the Arrians; and how
Ethnike Religion was again by Valens permitted to all that would embrace it,
the forenamed Ecclesiastical Histories make mention: how it was persecuted by
the Persian invasions, and after by the Saracens in time brought to this

mention them both in this sort. Pray for our Prince, the Prince of our

much of this Egyptian Prelate, as a taste of that which is to be declared in
our Christian Relations. Adrianu Romanus, Theat. Vrbium.
in his Theatrum Vrbium says, that besides the Patriarch of the Coptites, here
is also a Patriarch of the Greeks and Arabians, which have their Liturgy in
Greek, but scarce understand the same.

CHAP. VI
The Egyptian Chronology, out of Manetho high Priest of the Egyptians, and
others.

AFter this so long a History of Egyptian affairs, I have here added the
order of times, wherein those things happened, that this our Relation might be
the more complete, although perhaps it may seem to some more then taedious
already. Varro divided times into three sorts; the first he called Uncertain:
the second, Fabulous: the third, Historical: Joseph Sealiger, a man happily
more studious in this Subject of times, then all Times before have yielded us,
reckons the two former for one, as not easily to be distinguished. He has
also published to the world not only his own learned Observations on Eusebius
Chronicle, but such fragments Excerpta Barbaro-Lat. Manuse. Chron. Causab.
Collectan^^ bist. etc.
as out of Cedrenus, Syncellus, and others, he could find both of Eusebius
Chronicle in Greek, (for before we had only the Latin translation of Hierome,
much whereof also is utterly lost) as also of Africanus, from whose Storehouse
Eusebius took his Chronicle, both for matter and words, almost by whole sale,
And whereas Annius had before cousened the world with countersets of Berosus,
Manetho, Metasthenes, with other Fabulous tales, falsely fathered on the
ancients: He has helped us likewise to some Relics of those Histories,
which others have inserted into their works; the very bones of such carcasses
being worthy of admiration, if not of veneration. The true Manetho therefore in
three Tomes, wrote the Egyptian History unto Ptolomaeus Philadelphus: his
Greek Epistle Dedicatorie, being but short, I have thus translated.

To the Great King Ptolomaeus Philadelphus ^^^ Venerable, appropriated after to
Augustus, and his successors.
Augustus, Manetho High Priest and Scribe of the sacred sanctuaries, throughout
Egypt, of the Sebennite Family, a Heliopolitan, to my Lord Ptolomaeus,
Greeting. It behoneth us (mighty King) to give account of all those things
which you counsel us to search out. The sacred Books, written by our
forefather Trismegistus Hermes, which I have learned (according as you,
enquiring what things shall come to pass in the world, have commanded me)
shall be declared: Farewell, my Lord King.

Hence appears the time of Manetho, and his Pontisicall dignitle, with the
Original of his Antiquities borrowed of Hermes, and the occasion of his
vvriting in the Greek, as to a Grecian King.

Patricius out of a holy book sets down this Genealogy; Horus, the son
of Osiris, he of Chus, and he of Cham or Chamephes.
He first sets down the years of the reigns of their Gods. Vulcan, Sol.
Agathodoemon, Saturn, Osiris and Isis, Typhon. Then of the demigods: Orus, who
reigned five and twenty years: Mars, three and twenty: Anubis, seventeen:
Hercules, fourteen: Apollo, four and twenty: Ammon, thirty: Tithoes, seven
and twenty: Sosus, two and thirty: Jupiter, twenty. Things both false in
themselves and in the copy imperfect. After these he reckons in order two
and thirty Egyptian Dynasties.
Dynastiae, Lordships, or governments in Egypt.

1. The first of the Thinites; of eight Kings, whose names and years of reign
are, Menes, threescore and two: he was slain of an Hyppopotamus, or
Riuer-horse. Athothis his son, seven and fifty. He built a Palace in
Memphis, and wrote of Anatomy. Cen^cenes, his son, one and thirty. Enephes,

which were nineteen Kings, that reigned four hundred and nine years. The
first of them was Achthoes a cruel Tyrant, devoured by a Crocodile. 10. The
tenth was of nineteen Kings: whose reign endured a hundred fourscore and
five years. 11. The eleventh of the Diospolitans: whose sixteen Kings reigned
three and forty years. Here ends the first Tome of Manetho: whose second
Tome contains the twelfth Dynastie of the Diospolitans; The first of which
was Cosongoses, six and forty: Ammamenes, eight and thirty: Sesostris the
great Conqueror, eight and forty: Lachares, eight Ammares, eight; Ammenenes,
eight: Semiophris, four. 12. The thirteenth, of threescore Kings which reigned
four hundred fifty and three years. 14. The fourteenth of threescore and

of Phaenicians, Shepherds, the first of which was Saites, nineteen: Anon,
three and forty: Pachnan, threescore and one: Staan, eight: Arcles, forty
nine: Aphobis, threescore and one: In all two hundred forty and two. And the

In the third tome. The twentieth Dynastie lasted one hundred and five and
twenty years. The Kings were twelve. 21. The one and twentieth, of the Tanites:
Smerdes, six and twenty: Psusennes, two and forty: Nephelcherres, four:
Amenopbtis, nine: Opsochon, six: Psineches, nine: Susennes, fourteen: called
Sesac in Scripture: in all, one hundred and ten. 22. The two and twentieth, of
the Bubashtes: Sesonchis, one and twenty: Vsorthon, fifteen. The third,
fourth, and fifth, are not named: to them are ascribed five and twenty years:
In this space Zara the Ethiopian ouer-ranne these parts. Takellothis,
thirteen: his successor, two and forty: in all, one hundred and sixteen. 23.
The three and twentieth of the Tanites: Petubastes, forty: Osorchos, eight:
Psammus, ten: Ze, -- one and thirty: in all, four score and nine. 24. The

out of Manetho: here follow out of Herodotus; Psammeticus, forty four:
Nechao, seventeen; he slew Josias: Psammis, sixteen: Vaphres, five and
twentieth; with him Zedekiah entered league. Herodotus calls him Apnes. The
Masorites, by their Hebrew points (through ignorance of foreine History, as
Scaliger says) have made it Hophra, of whom Jeremy Iere.44.30.
prophesied that destruction which Amosis executed (as Herodotus reports) who
reigned four and forty years. The sum of the years of this Dynastie is one
hundred fifty and nine. 27. Here follows again out of Manetho: The seven and
twentieth Dynastie of the Persians: Cambyses, four: Darius Hystaspes, six and
thirty: Xerxes, twenty: Artabanus, seven months: Artaxerxes Longimanus,
forty: Xerxes, two months: Sogdianus, seven: Darius Nothus, eleven: in all,
one hundredth and thirteen. 28. The eight and twentieth, of the Mendesians;
Amyrtaus Saites, six. 29. The nine and twentieth, Nepherites, six: Achoris,
twelve: Psammites, one: Nepherites, two months. 30. The thirtith, of the
Sebennites; Nectanebis, eighteen: Teos, two: Nectanebos, eighteen. 31. The
one and thirtith, of the Persians: Artaxerxes Ochos, ten: He recovered Egypt in
the seventeenth year of his reign: Arsos, four: Darius Codomannus, six:
subdued by Alexander. Hitherto Manetho. The whole sum of whose one and
thirty Dynasties amount to five thousand three hundred fifty and five years.
32. The two and thirtith Dynastie, of the Macedonians: Alexander Mag. five.
Ptelomoeus Lagi, forty: Ptol Philadelphus, eight and thirty: Ptol. Energetes,
six and twenty: Ptol. Philopator, seventeen: Ptol. Epiphanes, four and
twenty: Ptol. Philometor, five and thirty: Ptol. Energetes 2. nine and
twenty: Ptol. Physcon, seventeen: Ptol. Alexander, ten: Ptol. Cleopatra,
eight: Ptol. Dionysius, thirty: Cleopatra, two and twenty: in all, three
hundred and one.
If the former Catalogue do not agree with therelations of Josephus, Cont. Ap.
Theoph.lib.3.
Theophilus or others, who have cited some parts of Manetho in their works, it
is not much marvel; the Graecians being always audacious, ready to pervert
Authors to their own purposes; besides the ouersights of Writers, through
negligence or ignorance in foreine names. Neither is Manetho's word an Oracle,
who reckons so long times before any time was: but either it is to be
ascribed to the arrogancy of the Egyptian Priests desirous to be accounted no
less ancient then the Chaldaeans: for Berosus and Manetho (as if they had been
agreed) derive their Histories from like Antiquity (says Scaliger out of
Syncellus) which would better appear, if we had the entire bodies, and not a
few scattered bones of their Histories: or else we may ascribe it to their
confounding of Histories, applying to an order of Succession, the diverse
reigns of several Dynasties, which happily governed at the same time in
several parts of Egypt, as in so small a Region as Canaan, Joshua destroyed
one and thirty Kings. This Scaliger Can. Isageg.l.3
coniectureth, Lydyat L. deemen. T. Some suppose the first of these Dynasties
were soon after the Creation, and soon after the flood: see the History of the
World.
affirms. Neither yet is Scaliger to be blamed for acquainting the world with
these fragments of Manetho, considering that the middle part thereof holds,
not only likelihood in it self, but in great part correspondence with the
Scriptures. If the Egyptians devised otherwise to Herodotus and Diodorus, it
was easy for them to deceive strangers, or be deceived themselves. The like
history of prodigious Antiquities Augustine De ciu. Dei lib.12.c.10.
relates of an Egyptian Priest that told Alexander of the continuance of the
Macedonian kingdom eight thousand years, whereas the Graecians accounted but
four hundred and fourscore. Yea, the Scriptures themselves have not escaped
that mis-reckoning of Times; almost all Antiquity being carried down the
stream of the Seventy Interpreters, which add many hundred years to the
Hebrew Text, either of purpose, as some Brou.Concent.
suppose, or as Augustine De ciuit.h.15.ca.13.
thinks, by error of him that first copied the Scriptures out of Ptolomeis
Library.

That which we read of the Dynasties of the Shepherds, Scaliger interprets
of that baser servile sort, which Moses Genesis 46.34
says were abominable to the Egyptians, and seem to have been strangers,
that inhabited some Fenny places which Nature had fortified, if we believe
Heliodorus Hist. Aeth.l.1
, and thence made forrages into the Country (the custom of Borderers) and
were called therefore Robbers. These (it seems) driven to their shifts, by
the hard and tyrannous usage of the Egyptians, procured (as we read of the
Tartars) their own freedom, and thraldom of their Lords. The Romans in their
times were forced to maintain a garrison against them, therefore called (...).
And Hierome mentions In vita Hilar.
the Bucolia where no Christians dwelled, but only a fierce nation. Josephus
Ios. cont. Ap. Eusebius, Chron.
and Eusebius think them to be the Israelites, which is unlikely, because,
they lived in servitude, and never reigned there. Lydyat supposes the
Philistims under Abimelech and Phicol to be the men.

Nothing is more obscure in this Egyptian Chronology, then the time of the
departure of the Israelites thence under Moses, whom Iu^lin Paraen^ad genesis
Martyr affirms out of Diodorus to have been the first that wrote the
Egyptian Laws. Tatianus Affyrius Orat. contra Groec.
(who after became an heretic) says (and alleges Ptolomey Mendefius a
Priest for his Author) that this departure was in the days of Amasis king of
Egypt, who lived in the time of Inachus. Theophilus and Josephus Theopb. lib.3.

Pont. Pbrigio. Wol^h. tpis. Chron^gr. Dagli. Mu^st. etc.
otherwise, according to the diverse interpretation of Manetho. The Scripture
shows, it was after four hundred and thirty years, from the promise first
made to Abraham, as all that I know both elder and later, Greek and Latin
Chronographers, except Genebrard and Adriehomius, reckon it. Lydyat thinks
that the drowning of the Egyptian Pharao was the cause of those tumults in
Egypt, about succession, which are ascribed to Aegyptus and Danans. Of this
Aegyptus some derive the name of the Country: which he supposes rather to be
compounded of Ai and Capti or Copti, that is, the Region of Copti the chief
city, as of Ai and Thebets or Thebais, Aethiops. Scalig.de Em. Temp.lib.5.
Ignatius the Patriarch of Antioch, in his Arabian Epistle to Scaliger, calls
Egypt the land of Copti, where he says, by a cruel edict of Dioctesian, were
slain one hundred forty four thousand, and other seven hundred thousand were
by the same Tyrant exiled. Orosius Or. lib.1.c.10
reports that the prints of the Charriot-wheeles of the Egyptians, then
pursuing the Israelites through the Sea, do yet remain in the sands on the
shore, and vnder-water, which no curiosity or casualty can so disorder; but
that Divine Providence does re-imprint them in their wonted form.

Hard it is to apply the years of the Egyptian Chronology, to the true
account of the worlds generation, by reason of the disagreement of Authors,
touching the Egyptian Kings, until Sesacs time: which (after Lydyat) was in
the year of the World 3029. although even from hence we have but slippery
footing. Augustus (after the same Author) made Egypt a Province, in the year
3975. Under which Roman government it continued until the Saracens conquered
it, in the time of Omar the third Chalipha, who began his reign, after
Scaligers computation, in his Catalogue ^^^ Scalig. ^^^ ^^ag. lib.2.
of the Chalipha's, in the year of CHRIST 643. The names of the Caesar's belong
to another place, and were tedious here to relate the years of their several
reigns. Otmen the fourth Chalipha began in the year of CHRIST 645: whom the
rest succeeded in order, until the year 869. And then the Chalipha's were
divided. Mutemad reigning in Bagded Among all the 13. pro^^^ces subject to the
Chalipha of Bagdet. Egypt had the second place, as C^nstan^^ Porphyro^^^
shows out of Theophanes. Constant. de admin. ^mp ca. 25.

Muchtaphi the Bagdet- Chalipha slew, about the year 907. Afterward, about the
year 943. Achshid Muhammed son of Tangi reigned in Egypt, to whom a few
years after succeeded his son Abigud, whom Meaz Ledin Illahi of the
posterity of Phetima, Mahumets daughter, deprived in the year of our Lord

and Etzar ledin Illahi his son was the last of the Phecimaean race. To him
succeeded Asareddin Shirachoch of the family of A^ub (which were Curdi) after
his death Iusaph ^z^lat eddin was constituted king by the Chalipha: and the
Bagded Chalipha's were again acknowledged in Egypt. This is that Saladine that
took Jerusalem, in the year of CHRIST 1190. Heg. 586. He conquered

him in the kingdom of Damascus, Melich Elaziz in Egypt, Taher Giazi in Halep,
or Aleppo; Melich Elazis exchanged Egypt for Damascus, with his uncle Eladel.
The Egyptians made Aphtzal their King, in the year of our Lord 1202. After
Eladel succeeded Elchamel 1219, who died in the year of our Lord 1237. Hegeira
635. Essaloch followed: and after him Elmatam 1242. The Turkemen conspi^ed
against him: he fled into a Tower of wood, which they fired: and half burned,
he leaped into a stream that passed by, and there perished. Turcoman Az^ddin
Ibik was made king in his place, in the year of our Lord 1245. Here began
the reign of the Mamalukes or slaves. He being slain an other slave succeeded
whom they called Melich Elmntaphar. This seems to be he that Leo calls
Piperitis. Thus far out of Scaliger, collected by him out of Abraham Zacuthi,
which adds much light to the Egyptian History of these times, wherein I
could never before satisfy my self concerning the erection and alteration of
the schismatic Egyptian Chalipha's, which with much labor (little auailing)
I had sought.

These Kings were not called Chalipha's (as the posterity of Phetima or
Fatima) but Sultans. A certain catalogue of the names, times, and affairs of
these Mamaluke-Sultans, I can not perfectly exhibit. Pencerus Peuc. Chron.

Elpis, Melech seraph, Melechnasar, Melechadel, and after many others,
Caithbeius, a stout enemy of the Turks P.Mart. Leg. Bab. li.3.
This Caithbeius was chosen Sultan, in the year of our Lord 1465. and reigned
three and thirty years. Two of his principal Mamalukes Acbardin and
Campsous, full of emulation, were a principal cause of the ruin of that
Dynastie. For whereas the Sultan was always chosen out of the Mamalukes, by most
voices amongst themselves, Campsous fearing left Acbardin should have succeeded
after Caithbeius, fained that his master had taken order on his deathbed,
that his son Mahomet should obtain the room: and used means to effect it,
both by the voices of those Mamalukes he could suborne, and confirmation of
their Chalipha, whose horns these Soldans had shortened, abridging his power,
(as before is said.) This Mahomet proved so cruel a tyrant, and those two
Mamalukes so banded themselves in factions, that all became confused, and
within six years after Caithbeius his death the Sultans throne was five times
vacant. Tomumbeius kills Mahomet: Campsous Ciarchesius is chosen. Zanballat,
President of Damascus, rebelleth, and by Tomumbeius means imprisoneth him, and
usurps the Scepter: but for his cruelty soon after is deprived and captiued
by Tomumbeius, and after, strangled; He also succeeding in authority,

Of the Oracle of Jupiter Anmon; and of Cyrene: and the Regions adjoining.

which Pliny Plin.li.5.c.5.

was sometime sacred, famous for the garden of the Hesperides, near to which
is that river of Lethe so much chaunted by the Poets. Nigh to this place also
are the Psylli, a people terrible to Serpents, and medicinable against their
poisons both by touching the wounded party, and by sucking out the poison, and
by enchaunting the Serpent.

The Oracle of Jupiter Ammon is famous among the ancient. The place, where
this Temple was, has on every side vast and sandy Deserts, in which they which
traveled, as we find in Arrianus Arrian.l.b.3. ^^^.lib.4.
and Curtius seemed to war with Nature. For the Earth was covered with sand,
which yielded an unstable footing, and sometime was blown about with the windy
motions of the Air: Water was hence banished, neither clouds nor springs
ordinarily affording it. A fiery heat did possess and tyrannize over the
place, which the sands and Sun much increased. Neither was here tree, or
hill, or other mark for Travelers, to discern their way, but the stars. In
the middle of this Desert, was that sacred Grove (which Silius Italicus calls
The fortunetelling Grove.
Lucus fatidicus) not above fifty furlongs in circuit, full of fruit bearing
trees, watered with wholesome springs, seasoned with temperate air, and a
continual spring. The Inhabitants, called Ammonians, are dispersed in
cottages, and have the midst of the Grove fortified with a triple wall. The
first munition contains the Kings Palace; the second, the Serail or lodgings
for his women, where is also the Oracle; the third the Courtiers inhabit.
Before the Oracle is a fountain, in which the Offerings were washed before
they were offered. The form of this God was deformed with rams horns
crooked, as some paint him: But according to Curtius, without form of any
Creature, but like a Vmbilicus.
round Bosse, bes^t with Jewels. This, when they consult with the Oracles, is
carried by the Priests in a gilded ship, with many silver Bells on both sides
of the ship. The matrons follow: and the Virgins singing their dis^tuned
Procession, by which they provoke their GOD to manifest what they seek. These
Priests were about four score in number. Rams horns are said to be
ascribed to him, because Bacchus wandering in these Deserts with his army, was
guided to this place by a seely Ram. Likewise Pausanias Pausan. lib. 4.
in his Messenica says, that one Ammon (which built the Temple) a shepherd,
was Author of this name to their God. Plutarchs De O^^^^

Pencerus. This Strabo Strabo 17.
in his time says was not in request. as no other Oracles besides. For the
Romans contented themselves with their Sibills and other diuinations. This
Oracle was not given by word, but by signs. This defect of Oracles in
general, and especially of this, occasioned that treatise of Plutarch Plut.de
dese^. Orac.
of this subject, enquiring the cause of the Oracles failing. Never had he read
that ^^^^^. 10.11
the Gods which had not made heaven and earth should perish out of the earth:
nor had he eyes to see that Sun of Righteousness, the light of the world, whose
pure beams chased and dispersed the mists of darkness. And therefore are his
conjectures so far from the mark, as notable with a natural eye to see the
things of God. The Dtod Stc.li.3 ca.5.
antiquity of this Oracle appears, in that Semiramis came to it, and
inquired of her death; after which, the Oracle promised to her divine honors.
Besides this Grove, C^vt ibidem. Pom^on mela. plin. solu^. etc.
there is another of Ammon, which has in the midst a well, they call it the
fountain of the Sun, whose water at Sunne-rising is luke warm, and cools
more and more till noone, at which time it is very cold: and from thence till
midnight, by degrees exchangeth that coldness with heat, holding a kind of
natural Antipathv with the Sun, hotest in his furthest absence, coldest in
his nearest presence. Pliny and Solinus place this fountain in Debris, a
Town not very far from those parts amongst the Garamants. The Ammoman women
have such great breasts, that they suckle their children over their shoulder;
the breast not less, if Inuenal be believed, then the child; In Meroe crasso
maiorem infant mamillam.
In Meroe, the monstrous Pappe
Is bigger then the child in lap.


Pausanias pausan.lib.3.
reckons an Ammonian Juno among the Libyan deities, as well as this Jupiter.
He adds, the Lacedaemonians had this Ammon in much request, and built to him
diverse Temples, as at Gytheum one, which had no roof: and the Aphytaeans did
him no less worship then the Libyans.

Ortelius who has bestowed a Description of this Temple, supposes that his
Image was painted with horns, but that Umbilicus was accounted the Deirie it
self, or the sign of his presence, which shapelesse sh^pe he sampleth by many
like in other Nations. The ship he coniectureth to signify, that the
Religion was brought from some other place. But if Ammon be that son of Noah,
it might rather be a memorial of the Arc, wherein Noah and his sons were
preserved: as that also of Ianus, (who is imagined to be Noah) may more fitly
be interpreted, then according to the Poets Glosle.

The Hammientes are not much distant in place, or differing in name, from the
Ammonians: which build their houses of falt, digging the salt-stones out of the
mountains, which they with mortar apply to their buildings. Mela joins to
these aforesaid the Atlantes, which curse the Sun at the setting and rising,
as bringing damage to them and their fields. A practice not unlike to the women
of Angola at this day, who (as Andrew Battle my friend told me) salute the new
Moon when they first see her, by holding up their naked bumme against her, as
the cause of their troublesome menstruous purgation.

These Atlantes have no proper names, nor feed of such things as have life. He
afurmeth of the Garamantes, that they had no wives, but lived in a beastly
community. The Augilae acknowledge no other Gods but Ghosts, or souls
departed, by which they swear; with which they consult as Oracles; to which
they pray at their tombs, receiving answers by dreams. The women the first
night of marriage are prostituted to all that will see them, the more the
greater honor, but after, must observe their own husbands. The Trogloditae
dwell in Caves, and feed on Serpents, and rather make a found or noise, then
humane voice: they used circumcision: they named not their children by the
parents names, but by the names of sheep or other beasts which yield the^
norishment. And unto these does Pliny add the Blemmyae with faces in their
breasts, the Satyrs. Aegypanes Himantopodes and other monsters, scarce worthy
relation or credit. These parts I have thus joined in-one Discourse, as living
(for the most part) a wild life, as the Arabians and Tartars do at this day:
and for Religion having nothing notable that I find, but as you have heard.
The Arabians which under Elc^m about the four hundredth year of their Hegeira
gave a ducat a man to pass into Affricke, are Lords and Inhabitants of the
deserts to this day, living (as we say) a Dogs life, in hunger and ease,
prosessing Mahumets Sect.

hued near to the Egyptians both in situation and custom. The Nasamones had
many wives, with which they had company publicly. The first night of the
marriage, all the guests had dealing with the Bride, and rewarded her with some
gift. The Gnidanes had a more beastly custom, whose women glorying in their
shame, ware so many fringes of leather as she had found Lovers. The Machlyes
ware the hair on the hinder part of their head, as the Iaponians now do. The
Auses used the contrary: whose Virgins in the yearly feast of Minerua, divided
themselves into two companies, and skirmished with staves and stones. If any
Virgins died of the wounds, they accounted them false maids. The most martial
Virago of the company, they arm and crown, and place in a Chariot, with
great solemnity. They used not marriage, but had women in common: the child
being reckoned his with whom he choosed to live, To add a word of the
Cyrenians, they held it unlawful to smite a Cow, in honor of Isis, whose
fasts and fea^^s they solemnly observed: and in Barca they abstained both from
beef and hogs flesh. They scared The like does Villam^^t report of the
Turks.
the crowns or temples of their children, to prevent the distilling of the
rheum. In their sacrificing, they first cut off the ear of the beast, as
first fruits, and hurled it over the house. Their Gods were the Sun and
Moon. The Maxes shave the left side of their heads, leaving the hair on the
right side. The Zigantes feed on Apes, whereof they have plenty.

The Meogauares make no account of Sepulchers, in stead whereof they cover the
corpse with stones, and set up a Goats horn on the stone-heape. They have many
skirmishes for their pastures, which are ended by the mediation of old women,
who may safely interpose themselves, and end the fray (or battle if you will
so call it.) When men are so old that they can no longer follow the heirds,
they strangle him with a Cowes tail, if he will not prevent them by doing it
himself. The like medicine they administer to such as are dangerously sick.
Of the Macae, Caelius thinks the Roman Priests borrowed their shaven Crowns.
Other things which our Authors add of these people and others adjoining, as
seeming too fabulous, I list not to express.

Of that part of Barbary, now called the Kingdoms of Tunis and Tripolis.

ALl the Tract of Land, between Atlas and the Sea (stretching in length from
Egypt to the Straits) is Leo, l.1.
called Barbaria, either of Barbar (which signifies to murmr) because such
seemed the speech of the inhabitants to the Arabians, or of the word Bar, which
signifies a Desert, doubled. It comprehends Magin.
both Mauritania's, Africa Minor, Libya Exterior, besides Cyrenaica and
Marmarica, whereof we have spoken. The inhabitants some fetch from Palestina,
some from Arabia. It was conquered by the Romans, and taken from the Greek
Emperors by the Vandals, and from them again by the Saracens and Arabians,
and is now partly subject to the Turk, partly to the Xeriffe. It is usually
divided into four Kingdoms, Marocco, Fesse, Tremisen, and Tunis; for of Barca
is said already.

The Kingdom of Tunis contains all that which the Ancients called Africa
propria, or Minor, and Numidia Antiqua. The Soil is fertile, especially the
West part. The inhabitants are sound and healthful, seldom vexed with any
sickness. Hereof are reckoned five parts; Bugia, Constantina, Tunis, Tripolis,
and Ezzab. This Ezzab is the most Easterly part, having many Towns and
Regions, amongst which, some account Mesrata. From these parts unto Capes, is
the Tripolitan Region. The chief Town is Tripolis, wherein the Great Turk
has his Bassa, or Viceroy, a Receptacle of the Pirates, which roue and rob
in those Seas; Nic.Nic. was there present.
in the year 1551 won from the Knights of Malta by Sinan Bassa. From Capes
to Guadilbarbar is the Tunetane Territory. From thence unto the Mountain of
Constantina is that Region, hereof bearing name: and from thence Leo, l. 5.

the principal City, sometime adorned with Temples, Hospitals, Monasteries,
and Colleges of Students in the Mahumetan Law. Here is also Necaus, a very
pleasant City; and Chollo, very rich. Constantina is an ancient City,
containing eight thousand families, and many sumptuous buildings, a great
Temple, two Colleges, and three or four Monasteries, much resorted to by
Merchants: Every Trade has their peculiar streets. A little from the City is
a hot Bath, having in it abundance of Crab-fishes, or little Tortoises, which
the women take for evil spirits, and ascribe unto them the cause of their
sickness, or ague, if any befall: and therefore kill white Hens, and set
them on an earthen Vessel, with their feathers, enuironing the same with
little Waxe-candles, and so leave them near to this Bath, or Fountain. How
ever it fare with their Fever, their meat shall not stay long, but some or
other that see the women's devotion, will envy the evil spirits so good
cheer, and for that time will be the spirits themselves, to dress and cat
their provision. Not far hence is a Marble building, with Images graven
therein: the people have a conceit, that it was sometime a School, and those
Statues the Scholars, by divine judgment so transformed for their wickedness.

In this Region is situated Bona sometime called Hippo, famous through our
Christian World for the most famous of the Fathers, that since the Apostles
days have left us their writings, AURELIUS AVGVSTINVS; a name fitting to him,
which indeed was Aureus and Augustissimus, Bishop of this Sea, while he lived;
and yet living (in his Works) a Bishop, not of Hippo, but of the Western
Church. Witty, Learned, Wife, and Holy Father, that have with thee carried
these Titles from Hippo: where, after thee, the Arian Vandals, and since, the
Saracens, have lived and Lorded, and at this day is possessed of such as have
no possession of Wit, Learning, Wisdom, or Holiness: but have testified
their banishment of all these, by ascribing them to fools and mad men, whom
they honor and admire as Saints. Nic. Nicolay, l. 1.
This Bona (then brooking this name better) contains now three hundred
Herthes, and a sumptuous Mosque, to which is adjoined the house of the Cadi.

Tunis is now a great City, since the ruins of Carthage, near unto which it
stands. Carthage Vrbs Carthago peninsule ad figuram accedens, binc mari, inde

contained (says P. Oros.l. 4.22.
Orosius) in the circuit of the walls twenty miles; Livies Epitome says,
four and twenty; all engirt with the Sea, except three miles space, which had
a wall of squared stone, thirty foot broad, and forty cubits high. The Tower
Byrsa environed above two miles, and had in it the Temples of Juno,
Aesculapius, and There were in Carthage the Temples of Juno, Memoria, Apollo,

are witnesses; in the second of which, Annebal (whom his father Hamilear, then
General in Spain, had caused to swear at the Altar of Jupiter, never to hold
friendship with the Romans, he then being but nine years old, as Aemilius
Probus, or as other will have it, Cornelius Nepos reports:) he, I say, passed
over the Pyrenaean Mountains, through France, and over the Alps, into
Italy, with an Army of a hundred thousand footmen, and thirty thousand
horse. The Rivers Ticinus and Trebia, the Lake Trasimenus (running with Roman
blood, by three overthrows of Scipio, Sempronius, and Flaminius the Roman
Consuls) witnessed the Punike might Of the Punike wars and greatness the
Roman Histories are full: so also Polybius and others among the Greeks. Erant

. But the victory at Cannae against Varro did pierce the breast, and had rent
the heart of Rome, had Annibal known to have used the victory as well, as to
have gotten it. There did Rome seem to breath her last: the Sun, the Wind,
the Dust helping the Carthagiman with Natures forces; yea, the River Gellus,
against Nature, stayed it self, whether with wonder, fear, or necessity,
accepting a Bridge or Damme rather or Roman bodies for a passage to the African
Army. These were golden days to Carthage, when three. Modij.

Hannibal have dined in the Capitol: and poor help could she find when she

bestowed their private state on the public Treasury: all which could not make

thereby procuring Annibals return, as the outward members are forced to yield
their blood, to succor any sudden oppression of the heart.

But how is my heart oppressed with sudden passion, thus to transport the
Reader, with my self, from Afric into Spain, France, Italy, there to
behold this Tragedy? Let the matter it self answer: and now we are returned
to Carthage, and find the Tragedy here. For in the third Punike war the
Romans (says Lib.2.c. 15.
Florus) rather fought with the City it self then with men. And alas, what
could that Hermaphrodite-army do, wherein were five and twenty thousand armed
women Oros.l. 4.23.
? Yet had women then the greater courage: Hasdrubal the King yielded. His wife,
with her two children, and much people, burned themselves in the Temple of
Aesculapius, that could not cure this disease of his City and suppliants; the
like fate befalling the first and last Queens of Carthage. Seventeen days

together did Carthage burn, seven hundred years after the first building.

In this last war, after they had delivered up their Navy and weapons, being
commanded to remove ten miles from thence, Anger kindled new forces, and
taught them to supply the want of iron, with Silver and Gold, in making
weapons, with pulling down their houses to build a Navy, the Matrons giving
their hair (the feminine Ornament) to make bands for their manly and warlike
Engines; their private glory, for public necessity; all which served but to
augment the pomp of this funeral of Carthage. Caesar did after restore it
with a Roman Colonie, never attaining the Tyrian glory, Leo, l. 5.
afflicted with Vandales and Goths, and by the Saracens made desolate; until
the time of Elmahdt, in heretical Caelipha; who procured the reinhabiting
hereof. But not above the twentieth part was inhabited: The rest remains as
scattered ruins, dispersed bones of the carcass of old Carthage. Master
Pountesse, a friend of mine, told me, That he has been rowed in his Boat over
the walls of Carthage, or their ruins, the Sea having made the last conquest
by eating into the Land. The condaits are whole (says Leo) which bring water
from a Hill thirty miles from Carthage, twelve miles under the earth, the rest
above. And now (says he) are not above five and twenty shoppes and five
hundred houses therein, one fair Temple, one College, but without scholars,
the inhabitants poor, proud, and superstitious. Master Ap.Hak.
Evesham says, That this City is now ruinated and destroyed. He mentions
these Arches, wherein water was hither conveyed, and one street three miles
long.

As for the Sea-discoueries attempted by the Carthaginians, Hanno compassed all
Africa, from the Spanish to the Arabian Straits, and committed his discoueries
to writing; Himilco at the same time was employed in the search of Europe.
Diodorus Sicubis Diod. Sic.l.5.c.7.
writes a whole Chapter of their discovery of a pleasant and fertile Island
Westward, in the Ocean, which cannot fitly agree with any other Region then
some part of the West Indies. And some GenesisChron.
think, that the Indians of America were a Colonie of the Carthaginians.
Aristotle has also the like relation in his book De admirandis Auditionib. In
the beginning of the War Dom.Nig.
they had three hundred Cities in Libya, and seven hundred thousand persons in
their City.

Tunis was a small Town, till after the destruction of Carthage it grew in
some reckoning (as before is said.) It has in it about ten thousand
households. Abdul Mumen joined it to his Kingdom of Marocco. And when that
Kingdom declined Leo, l. 5.
, the Viceroy (which before was subject to Marocco) now usurped the State to
himself, calling himself King of Africa. In our fathers Sleid.Com.l.5^. Fr.

days, Muleasses, son of Mabomet, King of Tunis (by murder of his elder
brother Maimon, and either killing or putting out the eyes of twenty other his
brethren) obtained the Crown. But Rossette the only brother remaining, when
with his Arabians he could not gain the Kingdom, he went with Barbar^ssa to
Solomon the Turk, who so used the matter, that Muleasses was chased out of his
Kingdom, and Tunis subjected it self to Selyman. But Mulcasses craved and
obtained aid of Charles the fist, who in the year 1535 passed De bac
expeditione Diatrium ser^^sit Joan. Etrobius.
with an Army into Afric, and repossessed Muleasses of his Kingdom, who
became the Emperors Vassal.

Our Histories tell of Edward the first his arrival at Tunis, and Henry the
fourth with English Arches; at both which times the Tunetanes were forced to
composition. It was, before either of them were Kings; Fro^ssart, for Henry,
has his son John de Beaufort.

Muleasses, about the year 1544, crossed over the Sea into Sicilie, leaving
his son Amida in the government. Surius Comm.
The costlinesse of his diet was admirable, and of his Perfumes. One Peacocke
and two Phesants, dressed after his order, were observed to amount to a hundred
ducats, and more. He was a superstitious obseruer of his Religion, and of the
Stars, which portended to him the loss of his Kingdom, and a miserable end.
To avoid this, he departed out of Africa (for fear of Barbarussa) but so fell
into the danger. A rumor was spread at Tunis, that he was dead; whereupon
Amida possessed himself of the Kingdom. Muleasses hasted home to recover it,
and lost himself: for he was taken captive, and after both his eyes put out
with a burning knife, and of his two sons Nahasar and Abdalas he was
committed to prison. But Abdamelech his brother got the Kingdom from Amida,
and soono after died, to whom succeeded Mahomet his son, a child: whose
Tutors were so tyrannical, that Amida was again sent for by the Tunetans, and
Muleasses is brought to sanctuary, whence by the Spaniards means he was
conveyed to Guletta, and thence to Sicilia, where he was maintained at the
Emperors charge Knolles, page 902.
. He derived his pedigree from the Chorean Family, in right line from Homar,
Mahomet disciple. Amida obtained the Kingdom, thus tossed betwixt Moors,
Turks, and Christians, but was after taken and sent prisoner to Sicilia.
Mahomet (brother of Amida, now a slave in Sicilia) was made King of Tunes,
under the Spaniard, 1573, by Don John of Austria: but the next year after,
Selym the Turk took Guletta, holden by the Spaniards almost forty years;
and at last took Tunes also: Mahomet the new King was sent to Constantinople
prisoner.

It has (says Leo, l.5.
Leo) many Temples, especially one of singular beauty and greatness, furnished
with store of Priests and Revenue: also, many Colleges of Scholars, and
Monasteries of Religious persons, to which the people yield liberal alms.
They are so befooled, that they esteem fools Saints: and while I was at
Tunis, the King built a fair Monastery for one Sidi el Dahi, that went up and
down with his head and feet bare, hurling stones, and crying like a mad man,
endowing the same with great revenue for him and all his kindred.

Cairaoan has been a City famous, built by Hucba, General of the wars of
Ozmen, or Otman, the third Chalifa, 36. miles from the Sea, and from Tunis 100,
to secure themselves from any sudden invasion, which the commodity of the
Sea might cause them. He built therein an admirable Temple, on Pillars of
Marble. To Hucba in this government succeeded Mucas.
Muse, who from hence made an Expedition into Spain, and overthrew the Spanish
King and his Gottish forces, and took Toledo: Iezul his son, his brother,
and nephew, succeeded each other in his government, which Elagleb (that
followed them) turned into an independent and free Seignorie, by occasion of
the Chalifa's leaving Damasco, and removing the Seat Royal, or Popedom, to
Bagdat. This house here ruled 170 years, at which time Mahdi an heretical
Chalifa deprived them. These Saracens wanne Sicilia in those times to the
Cairaoan dominion. About the 400. year of the Hegira, Elcain was Chalifa in
Cairaoan, whose Captain Gehoar conquered unto him Barbary, Numidia, and as
far as Sus Westward: and after being employed in the East, subdued Egypt and
Syria. He, for securing himself and his army, built Cairo. After this, he
sent to his Lord Elcain to come thither in person, assuring him, That the
Chalifa of Bagdat was not able to abide his presence and puissance. Elcain
liftening to Gehoar, appointed a Lieutenant in Cairaoan, and went to Cairo. But
his Lieutenant of Cairaoan rebelled and offered his obedience to the Chalifa of
Bagdat, who therefore gave him large privileges, and made him King of all
Africa. Elcain in these Straits knew not which way to turn him, till by
counsel of his Secretaire he took this course. The Arabians at that time were
exceedingly multiplied, insomuch, that the Country, otherwise barren, could
not sustain them and their Cattle. To these he gave leave to pass into
Africa, paying for every Poll a Duckat, and taking an oath of them to be
enemies to his rebel. These in short time sacked Tripolis and Cabis, and,
after eight months siege, Cairaoan also, and remained Lords of Africa, till
Joseph the first, King of Marocco, who gave aid to the kinsmen of that rebel,
wanne the Cities from the Arabians, which still kept possession of the Fields.
The Lord of Cairaoan fled Westward, and reigned in Bugia and the parts
adjoining, and others of his kindred ruled in Tunis, till the King of Marocco
swallowed all; that City being built presently after the Arabians had
destroyed this, in the year 424 of their Heg^ra, as Leo Leo, l. 2.
reckons. Cairaoan Surius Comment.
has in it an ancient Temple, and College of Priests: Hither the great men
among the Moors and Numidians, are brought to be buried, hoping by the prayers
of those Priests to clime to Heaven. For this cause ( Boterus says) they enter
into this City unshod, with great reverence.

Concerning the Religion of these Africans: in ancient times, Leo says, That
they worshipped the Fire and the Sun, as did the Persians, erecting in honor
of each of these, fair and sumptuous Temples, in which the Fire was
continually kept burning, as in the Temple of Vesta at Rome. The Numidians and
Libyans sacrificed to the Planets. And some of the Negros worshipped Guighimo,
which signifies the LORD of Heaven. These afterward (he says) were of the
Jewish Religion, and after that of the Christian, till the 268 year of the
Hegira, that some Negro Kingdoms became Mahumetan, although there remain some
Christians to this day: but those which were Jewish, both by the Christians and
Mahumetans, were utterly destroyed. But those of Barbary (whereof we
especially entreat) remained (says he) Idolaters, till 250 years before
Mahomets birth, when they became Christians. This must be interpreted of the
universal and public profession about the time of Constantine: For otherwise
Afric had in it Christians before. Dorothaeus in Synopsi says, That
Epaenetus, one of the 70 Disciples, was Bishop of Carthage; and that Simon the
Apostle preached in Mauritania, and among the Africans, as Matthias also in
Aethiopia. But the Goths soon corrupted Christian Religion with Arrianisme,
the forerunner of Mahumetanisme, both here and elsewhere. The Moors (says
Alex.ab. Alex.Genesisdier.l. 6.4.
another) worshipped Iuba as a God; and the Poeni, Vranus; the Libyans,
Psaphon. This Psaphon (otherwise a base fellow) had taught birds to sing,
Psaphon is a great God, and then let them fly into the Woods, where chanting
their Lesson, they enchanted the rude people with this superstition. Aelianus

tells the like History of Annon a Carthaginian, whose birds, at liberty in
the Woods, forgot this their Masters Lesson. The Poeni Dom.Niger.Perfidi Poeni

being (as is said) Phaeni, or Phaenicians, brought (in all likelihood) the
Phoenician Religion with them from thence. Silius reckons one of their
damnable Rites like to come thence, of humane Sacrifices.

Mos fuit in populis quos condidit advena Dido,
Poscere caede Deos veniam, ac flagrantibus aric
(Infandum dictu) parvos imponere natos.
Carthage, to appease the offended Deities,
Was wont to offer humane Sacrifice:
And tender Babes (abominable shame)
Were made the fuel of the Altars flame.
To Saturn (says Sar.l. 3.
Sardi^ss) were humane Sacrifices offered by the Rhodians, Phaenicians,
Curetes, and Carthaginians: the Sardi, their Colonie Suidos.
, offered the fairest of their captives, and such as were above threescore and
ten years old, who to show their courage, laughed; whence grew the Proverb,
Sardoniusrisus: this was done also to Saturn. The Carthaginians, in time of
plague, offered their children to Saturn, which Gelo caused them to leave.
Being overcome by Agathocles, they sacrificed 200 of the chief men's children
to Saturn. Ch^tarchus and others write, cited by Suidas, That in their solemn
supplications at Carthage they put a child into the arms of Saturnes Brazen
Image, under which was set a Furnace, or Oven: which being kindled, the child
being burned, seemed to laugh. This custom might happily be the occasion of
that desperate act before spoken of in the destruction of Carthage by the
Romans, so many perishing in Aesculapius Temple. Other their Rites are likely
to be the same with those which we have reported of the Phaenicians, somewhat
perhaps in time inclining also to the Greekish superstition. Their devotion to
Venus, the Phaenician goddess, Augustine August. in Psalm. 98.
mentions in these words, Regnum Veneris quale er at Carthagini, vbi nunc est
regnum Christi? The Punicke Tongue was, according to the same Author, very
near to the Hebrew in many words Contra lit. Petil.l. 3.
, yea almost in all: a surther testamonie either of their Canaanite or
Phaenician offspring, as we may gather out of Precopius, the Punikes in

Carthage was called Iustiniana, of Justinian, Iunonia of Graeccbus.
Hadrianopolis of Hadrian, and of Commodus. Alexandria Commodiana Togata. It was
sacked the second time of Capellianus, President of Mauritania; thirdly, under
Genserichus, of the Vandals; fourthly, of the Maurusians; fifthly, of the
Persians; sixthly, of the Egyptians; lastly, of the Mahumetans.

Tripolis of Barbary (for there is another of that Plin.l. 5.c.20.
name in Syria, so called, because the Arcadians, Tyrians, and Sidonians
inhabited it) was so named of three Cities, whose Colonies planted it,

others, Cesa, or Taphra, or Oea, Sabrada, and Leptis. It was built by the
Romans, conquered by the Goths, and after by the Saracens. And after the
destruction thereof, the Africans built a new Tripolis, wherein were many fair
Temples, Colleges for Students, and Hospitals. Corn is always dear, because
their Fields are Sand. Io. Lco.l. 5.
It was subject unto the King of Tunis, till the King of Fez carried away the
King of Tunis prisoner. At which time the Genovese Fleet of twenty sail took
Tripolis, and sold it to the Fezan for fifty thousand ducats. But the Kings
of Tunis recovered it after. Zacharias being King, played the Tyrant, and
therefore was expelled, and a certain Citizen was advanced to the Throne; who
at first governed modestly, but declining to tyranny, was marthered: And a
Courtier of Prince Abubacer, who had made himself an Heremite, was forced to
be their King, who ruled Tripolis, till Ferdinando sent Peter Navarre thither,
who came thither in the evening, and the next day took it: and the King
remained captive, till Charles the fifth freed him. Charles gave the City to
the Knights of Malta, whom the Turks Nic. Nicolay l.1.c. 18. G. Bot.Ben. Of
Tripolis read T. Sanders in Hak. ^o. 2. part. 1.
dispossessed by force, Anno 1551, and there have their Beglerbeg or Viceroy
to this day. This was one and forty years after Navarre had taken it.

The Kings of Tunis lived in great delicacie among their women, Musicians,
Players, and such like, committing the government to the Munafid, or high
Steward, and other Officers. When he calls for a Musician, he is brought in
hood-winked like a Hawke. The inhabitants are exceeding prodigal in perfumes.
They have a compound called Lhasis.
Lhasis, one ounce whereof being eaten, causes laughing dalliance, and makes
one as it were drunken, and maruelously provoke to lust. In the Kingdom of
Tunis is placed the Lake Tritonia, where Minerna is said to have showed her
self the inuenter of Spinning and of Oil, and therefore worshipped.

Ezzab is the most Easterly part of the Tunetan Kingdom, the chief Province
whereof is Mesrata. The inhabitants are rich, and pay no tribute. There grow
Dates and Olives, and they traffic with the Numidians, to whom they carry
the wares which they buy of the Venetians. The Great Turk swayeth with his
Ottoman Scepter, at this present, this Kingdom of Tunis, and all Africa, from
Bellis de Gomera to the Red Sea (except that little which the Spaniard has.)
At this day Leo.l 1.
they are Mahumetan, and have been about these nine hundred years past, from
the time of Hucba. The inhabitants of the Cities differ much from the
Mountainers and ruder Rustikes. For they are studious, especially in matters of
their law, as in times past they were also in Philosophy and the
Mathematickes. But these last five hundred years their Princes and Doctors
have prohibited many Sciences, as Astrology and Philosophy: according to the
Mahumetan custom they use much washing and resorting to the temples. They are
very faithful in their promises: and exceeding ielous. They go through the
world as Merchants, and in many places are interteined as Readers and Masters
in diverse sciences: and are well esteemed in Egypt, Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia,
India, Turkey. The younger sort yield much reverence to their Elders and
Parents: and will not hold discourse of love or sing love-songs in their
presence. But these citizens are very proud and revengefull. The Lords esteem
more of their beasts, then of the common people. The The Countrey-people in
the fields and Mountains live hardly in labor and want. They are beastly,
theevish, ignorant, unfaithful. Their women, before they be married, may live
as wantonly, as they list: yea, the father makes (hateful love to the
daughter, and the brother is vnlovely loving to the sister. The Numidians are
traitors, homicides, thieves, and, for reward, will do any thing. Such also
are the Libyans; without any kind of letters, Faith, or Law, without Heaven or
Earth; living (if that may be called a life) like Wild beasts, for ignorance;
like Devils, for wickedness; like Dogs, for poverty. These things reports
Leo of them, who lived among them: which may provoke us to thankfullness to
that Great GOD, who has given us such abundance for body and soul, in things
present and future, temporal and eternal.

Of the Kingdoms of Tremisen, Algier, and other places, anciently called
Mauritanis Caesariensis.

beginning Westward from the River of Zha and Muluia; Eastward, it bordereth on
the Great River; Southward, upon the desert of Numidia; and Northward, upon the
Mediterran Sea. It was by the Romans called Mauritania Caesariensis: the name
came of the Inhabitants called Mauri, and of the Greeks, (...) some say (...)
of their color, because it is obscure and dark. They were supposed to come
hither first with Hercules out of India. More likely it is that Arias Mont. in

testifies, That in ancient coins it is read Mauretania, and so Tacitus

reads. Ptolomey divides it into Mauritania Caesariensis, which Victor
Victor. Persecutionis lib. 3.
Vticensis calls Mayor, and Tingitania. Pliny Plin lib.5. cap. 1. and 2.
ascribes this division to Caligula; Dion, to Claudius Casar: of whom it was
surnamed a Caesariensis of the mother City Caesarea, where he planted a Roman
Colony, before called Iol, the Royal seat of Iuba, a man famous, for that he
first reigned over both these Mauritania's, but more famous for his learning,
whereby he still lives in the learned moniments of Pliny and others; author
of much of our African reports. He in his childhood was led in triumph at Rome;
his father Caesar. Comment. de bello civilly Africano lib. 5. Orosius l. 6. c.
16. R. Volater. l. 12.
Iuba, the successor of Bechus, had before slain himself in the civil
wars. Augustius restored him to his fathers Kingdom, to which he left his
son Ptolomey, borne of the daughter of Antonius, and Cleopatra, whom Caligula
slew, and then divided Mauritania into two Provinces, whereof this is called,
as is said, Caesariensis of the Colony of Claudius Caesar. That which Procopius
Precop. de bello Persico and Vandilico. lib. 4.
has written of the original of these Maurusij, as he terms them, although
in our first book mentioned, here also may seem to deserve relation. When
Joshua, or Jesus the son of Nun or Nane, had invaded the Land of Canaan, the
people fled into Egypt, and there multiplying, pierced into Africa,
replenishing with people all that coast unto the pillars of Hercules, using a
semi-phaenician dialect. For all the Seacoast from Sidon to Egypt, was
anciently called Phaenicia. They built the town Tinge in Numidia, where they
erected two pillars of white stone near a great fountain, wherein was
engraven in Phaenician letters, We Flee from the face of Jesus the These, the
son of Naue. These are supposed the first inhabitants of Africa, and for that
cause Antaeus their King, which encountered in single combat with Hercules, was
said to be the son of the Earth. Afterward when the Phaenicians came hither
with Dido, they were here received for kindreds sake, and permitted to build
Carthage; which after grew so mighty, that it subdued and expelled the Maurusy
themselves. The Romans made the Carthaginians, and other Africans Tributaries,
and caused the Maurusy to inhabit the furthest parts of Africa: But in process
of time they, obtaining many victories against the Vandils, seated themselves
in Mauritania, til Justinian removed them. Thus far Procopius. Paulus Pauli
Diaceni lustinianus.
Diaconus records also the same history, saving that he says the Egyptians
would not receive them, and therefore they passed into Africa. The Maurusy in
the time of Justinian were destroyed, and captiued in such multitudes, that a
Maurusian slave was valued but at the price of a sheep. The author of this was
Solomon, an Eunuch, according to a prophecy which they had amongst the^, that
one without a beard should destroy the^. But captivity could not much empaire
their happiness, whose very freedom was misery. Procop. Eadem Coelius Rodig. l.
18. c. 38. Suidas says that they were bold: and fought fleeing and returning
upon advantage, like as we read of the Parthians.
For they lived in small base cottages, exposed to the Summer Suns, and Winter
snowes, sleeping (except a few of the better sort) on the bare ground, always
wearing the same garment howsoever the season differed, and that torn and
ragged: wanting bread and all other necessaries, neither grinding nor boiling
that corn they had. Thus miserable were their bodies and their souls more.
For they had neither fear of GOD, nor reverence of men, nor respect of pledge,
nor regard of oath, nor peace with any, but where fear constrained them. They
had their women Prophetesses, which diuined by their sacrifices: a thing
unlawful for their men to attempt. Of the numbers of their wives they bragged,
In Epistola ad Salomonem.
that the Christians which had but one wife, might fear the loss of their
children, they which might have fifty wives need not misdoubt issue and
posterity. And yet they were by many wars brought to small numbers, and a few
tribes or families. Leo Leo.lib.4.
says, that after the Romans were expelled, the ancient Governors called Beni
Habdulguad of the family of Magraua repossessed these parts: who were after
dispossessed by Ghamrazen, Son of Zeijen, whose posterity reigned here almost
380. years. But they were much vexed by the Kings of Fesse and Tunis. It was
in later times called the kingdom of Telensin, or of Tremisen, stretching in
length from East to West 380. miles, in breadth not above five and twenty. The
Kings could never satisfy the Numidians couetise, whose friendship they have
with great cost sought. It has two frequented haven towns, Oram and
Mersalcabir, both taken and holden by the Spaniards. They were taken in the
time of Ferdinando King of Spain; for which cause Abuchemmen the Telensin King
was expelled by his own subjects, and Abuzeijen placed in his room, which he
could scarcely warm before he was slain by Barbarussa the Turk, who
conquered this Kingdom. Anno 1515.
But Abuchemmeu sought to Charles the fifth for aid, by whose help he
recovered his Kingdom, and paid a tribute to the Emperor. But Habdulla his
successor detained the tribute, and submitted himself unto Soliman the great
Turk. Algior remained to Barbarussa.

This Munster Cosniog.lib.6.
Barbarussa or Barbarossa was a mean fellow of base condition, who in his
youth sold cheeses in Spain for his living, and by his industry attained to
great matters. There Knolles page 635.
were of them two brethren, borne at Mytilene in Lesbos, their mother a
Christian, their father a renegate Grecian, Horucius Barbarussa. and this
Hariadenus Barbarussa. They first stole a Galliot, and so committing themselves
to sea, by piracy under Camales, a Turkish Pirate, they grew rich: and from one
Gally, came to have a Navy of their own, with which they scoured the coasts
of Barbary. At the same time Surij Comment, in Annum 1534.
two brethren contended for the Kingdom of Algier, one of whom requesteth aid
of Horucius, who so helped him against his brother, that he helped himself to
the Kingdom, by the murder of the King his patron and ally, which he did not
long enjoy, being taken and slain of the Spaniards, and his head sent into
Spain. But his brother Hariadenus succeeding him, became mighty both by sea
and land, to the great damage both of the Moors and Christians: and Soliman
moved by his same, sent for him, and made him Admiral of all the Turkish seas,
and sea-forces, under whom he grew dreadful, not to these parts of Barbary
alone, which he subjected to the Turk, but to those countries of Christendom
which are washed with the Mediterran: even Rome it self quaking for fear of a
second Hannibal, who after so many ages should by sea from Africa avenge the
angry ghost of old Carthage. In the year 1538. The Pope, Emperor and
Venetians, had with joint forces set forth a Navy of above two hundred and
fifty sail against him, but by mutual discords (the wonted advantage of the
Turks against the Christians) they made themselves both sport and spoil to
this Turkish Pirate. The sea could no longer endure the success of this
Barbarian, but mad to see the Christians unchristian madness, and unwilling to
submit his proud waves to the base thraldom of this base Turk, swelling with
indignation, conspired with the neighbor element, which pretended equal
quarrel for so often darkening his light, and poisoning his breath with those
hellish smokes, and for usurping those thunders, which had wont to be the airy
privilege of his middle regio^s: these both agreed in their disagreeing with
tempestuous fury to spoil the spoilers: the winds from the Acroceraunian
hills, and the seas on the Dalmatian shore, so girt in the Turks, with their
equal unequal siege, that twenty thousand of them were captiued and shut up
in Neptunes prisons, to become food to his family, and the new conquerours on
every shore, made their markets of Turkish commodities, and by wrackes
testified to the Earth, that they had wrecked themselves on her and their
enemies. And yet did Barbarussa recover himself by new forces, and having
won Rhegium; came to Ostia, where he rode three days; the Romans trembling
mean while, and ready to leave Saint Peter alone to lock out the Turks if
they came, So much more fortunate were his proceedings, then of Hali Bassa, who
in the fight at Lepanto lost his life and Navy, whereof Knolles says forty
sunk; an hundred threescore and one Galleys and sixty Galliots taken. page

eighty fell to the seas share, and an hundred and thirty sail to Don John

Homer to sing it. But me thinks I feel some Cynthius pulling me by the ear,
and asking if the Pirates have robbed me of my Religion, the most proper subject
of my discourse. Truly that irreligious crew while they seek to win other
things, care not to lose that. But this Algier having been of old, and still
continuing a receptacle of Turkish rouers, could not be passed over, especially
in these Piraticall times, without some observation, being also the gate
whereby the Turkish forces first entered into Barbary. John Io.Leo.lib.4.
Leo writes a little otherwise of Barbarussa and Algier. The Moors call this
City Gezeir, the Spaniards Algier: and of old was called Mesgana of that
African family which founded it. It contains It has now eighty thousand
persons, as Boterus affirms.
about four thousand families: the buildings very sumptuous; Innes,
Bath-stoues, and Temples very beautiful: every occupation has a several
place by it self. It has adjoining plains very pleasant and fertile, one
whereof is five and forty miles long, and almost thirty broad. For many years
it was subject to the Kingdom of Telensin: but hearing that Bugia was governed
by a King, they submitted themselves to him, paying him a tribute, otherwise in
manner free. Then did they build themselves galleys, and molested with Piracies
the Spanish Islands of Maiorica, Minorica, and Ieuiza. Ferdinando therefore
provided an Armada against them, and built a Fort within shot of the Town:
whereupon they requested peace, and promised tribute. But Barbarussa, when
Ferdinando was dead, was sent for by the Citizens, and made Captain over all
their forces. He soon after murdered Selim Etteumi an Arabian Prince, which
had been created Governor of Algier, when Bugia was taken by the Spaniards:
and possessed himself of the government, and there coined money, calling
himself King; the neighboring people yielding him obedience and tribute. This
was the beginning of Barbarussas greatness: and at the most part hereof Leo was
present, and lodged in his house which had been Ambassador from Algier to
Spain, from whence he had brought three thousand books written in Arabian.
And whiles I was at Tunis, I heard that Barbarussa was slain at Telensin, and
his brother This was Hariaden the Turkish Admiral.
Cairadin succeeded. It was told me also that the Emperor Charles the fifth
had sent two armies to surprise Algier, the first whereof was destroyed in the
plain, the second slain and made slaves by Barbarussa, in the year of the
Hegira 922. Thus far Leo. In the year 1541. N c. Villagagnon. de bac
expedit. Sury Comm.in Ann. 1541.
Charles himself with his Imperial Navy passed the seas, to like both purpose
and effect, more ouercomming himself in the patient bearing his losses, then
his enemies whom he sought to assail. He was moved to this expedition by the
complaints of his subjects, against the Turkish Pirates, which under Asanaga,
Barbarussa's Lieutenant, infested all those seas. But the tempestuous weather
both at land and sea disappointed him, and after the loss of many, both men
and ships, was forced to return, and, to make room for his soldiers,
caused his horses (their gallant breed notwithstanding) to be cast ouerboord.

Thus does Algier still continue a sink of Pirates; and now says Maginus,
there are in it not many less then five and twenty thousand Christian slaves;
which in likelihood at this time are increased. Tripoli is also a seat of a
Turkish Viceroy or Beglerbeg, and of Turkish Rouers. In the Kingdom of
Telensin is the desert of Angad, wherein are store of Roes, Dear and
Ostriches, Arabian thieves, and Lions. The Castle of Izli was sometime stored
with Inhabitants, and stately walled. Since, it was inhabited with religious
persons, much reverenced by the Kings of Telensin, and the Arabians, which give
free entertainment for three days unto all travelers. A little off runs a
River, out of which they water their fields, which else would yield them no
fruit. Guagida betwixt two stools had unquiet sitting, paying tribute both to
the kings of Telensin, and the Arabia^s. Ned Roma was built by the Romans, as
the name testifies, for Ned signifies like; and like it was, if
Historiographers fail not, unto Rome. Here and at Tebecrit dwelt great store
of Weauers. Haresgol was sometime famous, but being destroyed by a King and
Patriarch of Cairaoan, it bequeathed as it seems the greatness thereof to
Telensin, which after grew in renown. This town gives name to this Kingdom.
When Abu Tesfin reigned, it had in it sixteen thousand families. Joseph King
of Fesse besiege^^ it seven years together, and almost famished them: but he
being slain by treason, they found victuals enough in their enemies camp
(which they assailed and spoiled) for their relief. Forty years after
Abulhesen King of Fez after thirty months siege took it, and beheaded their
King. Here are many and beautiful Temples, having their Mahumetan Priests and
Preachers. Likewise here are five Colleges most sumptuously built by the Kings
of Telensin and Fesle, curiously wrought with Musaike work, for the Arabian
Muses and Students, which have their maintenance there. Their Bathes and Innes

their yellow Turbants from the other Citizens, which being very rich, in the

are now Lords thereof, between who^ and Charles the fifth, who had undertaken
their protection, the City is much impaired, as also by the wars betwixt the
Seriffe and the Turk. Barbarossa subjected it. Batha is a great City, or rather
was such: now ruined by wars. Not far hence in Leo's time kept a famous
Heremit, much esteemed for his holiness: who in short time grew so rich in
horses and other cattle, that none in that region were co^parable to him. He
paid nothing, nor any of his to the King, or to the Arabians, because they
supposed him a Saint. I was told by his disciples (says Leo) that the tenth of
his corn is eight thousand bushels a year. A rich Heremite.
He has five hundred horses and mares, ten thousand small cattle, and two
thousand oxen, besides that, he has yearly sent him from diverse parts of the
world, of alms and offering, between four thousand and five thousand
ducats. His fame is spread over Asia and Africa. His disciples are five
hundred, which dwell with him, and live at his charge, to whom he enioyneth
neither penance nor labor, but to read ordinary prayers: and gives them some
names of GOD to observe in their prayers, which they are to mumble so many
times a day. For which cause multitudes resort to him to be his disciples,
which after such instruction he sends home again. He has an hundred tents,
some for strangers, some for shepherds, and others for his family. This good
and lusty Heremit has four wives, and many slaves, and by them many sons and
daughters gallantly attired. His children also have wives and children, in so
much that the whole family of this Heremite and his sons exceed five hundred.
He is honored of the Arabians; and the King of Telensin is afraid of him. I,
being desirous to know him, was entertained of him three days, and supped with
him every night in secret rooms, where he showed me among other things, books
of Magike and Alchimy: and would have proved to me that Magike was a true
Science, whereby I thought him to be a Magician, because I saw him so much
honored, and yet used neither sayings nor doings, but those inuocations of GOD
by certain names. Thus far Leo lib. 4.

abou^ded with men of learning and Poets. But he which would further be informed
of the Cities of this Kingdom, let him read Leo. The people of Bresch use to
paint a black cross on their cheek, and another upon the palm of their hand.
The same is observed of diverse others, which yet know not the reason thereof,
being Mahumetans. The story says, that the Goths inuading and ruling these
parts proclaimed freedom from tribute to all such as would become Christians,
a badge of which Christianity was this cross, still kept, now their Religion
is lost.

The government of these parts is, as is said, Turkish, The Beglerbeg has
chief title, but the Dinano has chief power of judgments and jurisdiction.
The Corasan or Captain of the Ianizaries, being in many matters as great as
the Beglerbeg. The Beglerbegs of Algier and Tunes make their principal profits
of their places (which they hold three years, having first bought them at a
dear rate) by their Piracies, which with joint consent they exercise on these
seas, all in manner being fish that comes to net, if they meet them
conveniently notwithstanding any league, or peace holden with the Grand Signor.
They also give entertainment to such Pirates of other places as resort to them,
either to sell their ill-gotten goods, or to join their strength with them. As
of late Pirates.
Dansker and Ward have been famous in this infamy; the first, after his
service with them and for them, receiving his reward, by them suddenly killed
at Tunes (where he was known notwithstanding his disguising himself, with
purpose to have surprised their Fleet): the other (a shame to our Country, of
which he was) grew so rich by his Piracies, that he showed at one time to (the
Author of these reports) John Pountesse, a bag of Jewels, containing almost
half a bushel, besides his other purchases: And at last, that the end might
manifest the wickedness of these proceedings, Many English Christians unworthy
either of these names, turn from that faith (which they never had, but in
profession) to profess themselves (for hell) Turkish.

Tunes: leaving his goods (for his goodness he had left before) unto the
Turks, his body unto a foreign sepulcher, and his soul; let Pirates and Robbers
(if they think they have any soul) say whither.

Algier was by Barbarussa subjected to the Turk, about the year 1534. Tunes
An. 1574. three and twenty year after that Tripoli, in Barbary, another cage
of like birds, and seat of a Beglerbeg, was taken from the Knights of Malta by
Sinan Bassa. These Kingdoms the Turk has in Africa, besides the great
Kingdom of Egypt, and what he has taken from Prester John. In Egypt Knolles.
are said to be an hundred thousand Timariots, or horse-mens fees, which for
that tenure of their land, without any charge to the Great Turk, are to serve
where it pleases him to employ them. In this Kingdom of Algier are forty
thousand.

vnwealdie for any man of later times, and holden in great veneration. Next to
this Tingi (which gave name to the Country, after by Claudius Caesar, who sent
a Colony thither, called Traducta Iulia) was a high mountain called Abyla, to
which on the Spanish coast was opposed Calpe, which two hills bare the name of
Hercules pillars; Hercules himself (if we believe fabulous antiquity) making
there a passage to the Ocean and Mediterran seas, for mutual view and
entertainment. They are now called, Seuta on that side, and Gibraltar on this.
A little hence was Iulia Constantia, a Colony of Augustus, and Lixus, a Colony
of Claudius. In this, Natal.Comes.Mythol.l.7.c.2.

Hesperides. Antaeus, if his Legend be true, was Some say threescore and ten,

threescore and four cubits long, a cruel and inhospitall tyrant, who in his
encountering with Hercules, was three times hurled dead to the earth, and so
many times by his mother (the earth) revived: which Hercules perceiving, held
him up in the air till he had strangled him. Whereby they intend, that the
Sun reuiueth the Earth, signified by Antaeus and Hercules, but with his
excessive heat does kill it. The Hesperides were the daughters of Hesperus,
brother of Atlas; Aegle, Arethusa, Hespertusa. In their gardens grew those
golden appels (the dowry of Juno to Jupiter) kept by a Dragon, engendered of
Typhon and Echidna, which had an hundred heads, and many voices, attended by
the Priest of the Hesperides: These Hercules fetched away. This was the
Poetical tale; the truth whereof is said to be, that the daughters of Atlas
were by Pirates and thieves, sent from Busiris King of Egypt, stolen; and
redeemed by Hercules, who slew those thieves. These were borne to Atlas, of
Hesperida, daughter of Hesperus his brother, called therefore Atlantides and
Hesperides, six in number. Atlas had an excellent kind of sheep, with yellow
fleeces, which for this exploit he bestowed on Hercules; and taught him also
the knowledge of Astronomy: in regard of which Science, Atlas is said to have
borne up the Heavens with his shoulders, and Hercules to have undertaken his
burden. Whereas Natalis Bib.7.cap.7.
Comes places these Gardens with Pliny, near to Lixus, and yet nigh to Meroe
and the red sea, betwixt which places is such a world of distance, it argues
how great errors great scholars may fall into by want of that
so-much-neglected study of Geography, without which, History that delectable
study is sick of a halfe-dead palsy: one cause that has moved me to join in
my studies and in this work, the history of Time, with her manifold cha^ges and
chances, and of Place together. Besides the Altar of Hercules, and wild
Olives, there remained nothing in Plinies days of that Hesperian Garden. Niger

finds there a tree Mallow, twenty foot high, and above a fathom about. Of
Mount Atlas they tell wonderful tales, of the selfe-fertility thereof, the
inhabitants never seen by day, the desert-like silence, the fires therein
shining by night, the music and mis-rule of the Aegypanes and Satyrs, and the
labors of Hercules and Perseus there. John Leo shall better acquaint us with
the truth, then those fables of credulous antiquity. Out of him therefore and
other later Writers we will take view of the present face of Africa, there
being little that can be said of their ancient Rites, more then is already
observed. The Romans brought hither their language and Religion. The Vandals
under Gensericus passing out of Spain, made conquest of all in manner which
the Romans had in Africa, of whose cruellty Victor Victor Vitcensis

soil, says Mela, is more noble then the people: of the miraculous fertility

thought that Christian Religion was here preached in the Apostles time.

Leaving those things of more age and uncertainty, we will come now to the
Kingdoms of Fez and Marocco, which have been of Saracenicall erection in this
Province of Tingitana. Io.Leo.lib.3. G.Bot.Ben. Maginus.
That of Fez stretches from Azamor to Tanger, and from the Atlantike Ocean to
Muluia. This River is the Eastern border, on the North it is washed with the
Sea, on the South is the Kingdom of Marocco, on the West, the River Ommirabih.
The Rivers Subu, Luccus, and others, water it. Therein are numbered seven
Provinces, Temesna, the territory of Fez, Azgar, Elhabet or Habat, Errif,
Garet, and Chaus or Elchauz: every of which, says Leo, had in old times a
several Governor. Neither was the City of Fez the royal seat, but was built
by a Schismatic Rebel, in whose family the government continued 150.
years. And then the Marin family prevailing, gave it first the title of a
Kingdom, settling their abode and strength therein.

Temesna begins at Ommirabih, thence stretching Eastward to Buragrag,
between Atlas and the Ocean. It is a plain Country, eighty miles in length,
containing in it forty great Towns, besides three hundred Castles. In the
year of the Hegeira 323. Chemim the son of Menal, an Hermeticall Preacher,
persuaded them to pay no tribute, nor yield subjection to Fez, because the
Lords thereof were unjust, bearing himself for a Prophet, and in small time
gate into his hand the spiritual and temporal sword, holding the same by
force and arms. But after that Joseph had built Marocco, he sought by
Catholic Doctors of the Mahumetan Religion, to reduce them from their Heresy,
but they slew them, and with an Army of 50000. marched toward Marocco to
expel thence the house of Luntuna, but by this means brought destruction to
themselves; Joseph getting the better, and spoiling their Country, ten months
together, with great cruelty. It is thought that a Million of people by famine,
sword, rocks, and rivers, were consumed: and Temesna was left to be inhabited
of Wolves, Lions, and ciuet-Cats, 150. years: at which time King Mansor gave
the possession of Temesna to certain Arabians, who fifty years after were
expelled by the Luntune Family, recovering the Kingdom from the house of
Mansor; and after, the Marin Family prevailing gave it to the people of Zenete
and Haora, in meede of their service, which they had done to the Marins against
the King and Patriarch of Marocco. From which time they have enjoyed the same
almost two hundred years. Anfa was a Town of great trade with the English and
Portugals, and by these utterly rased: and so the Arabians served the next City
Mansora. Nuchaila, sometimes famous for their plenty of corn, of which it is
recorded, that they would give a Camels burden for a pair of shoes, has now
but a few bones left of her carcass, namely a piece of the wall, and one high
steeple, where the Arabians, after they have ended their tilth, lay up their
instruments of husbandry, none daring to steal his Neighbors tools, in
reverence of a Saint of theirs, there buried. Rebat is a Town furnished with
Colleges, and Temples, the model of Marocco. At Sella was King Mansor buried,
where he had built a stately Hospital, and Palace, a beautiful Temple, and a
Hall of Marble cut in Mosaike work, with glass windows of diverse colors,
wherein he and his posterity were buried. I saw, says Leo, the Sepulcher, and
copied out the Epitaphes of thirty of them.

Madur Anvan by the ruins testifies her sometime proud buildings, hospitals,
Innes, and Temples. In Thagia is visited the Sepulcher of a holy man, which
lived in the time of Habdul Mumon the Calif or Patriarch, who wrought great
miracles against the Lions, where with the Town is much molested. Ettedle, a
Mahumetan Doctor, wrote a Legend of his miracles, which Leo says he had read,
and supposed that they were done either by Natural or Deuillish Magike. The
Fessans after their Easter, yearly resort to his Tomb with such numbers of
men, women, and children, and their Tents, that they seem an Army. It
stands from Fesse 120. miles, so that their going and returning in this
Pilgrimage lasts fifteen days. My Father carried me yearly thither when I
was a child, and since, I have been there many times, by reason of many vows
which I made, being in danger of Lions. Where Zarfa stood, the Arabians now

fow corn.

The Territory of Fez has on the West the River Buragrad; on the East, Inaven;
on the North, Subu; and Atlas on the South. Sella was built by the Romans,
sacked by the Goths, subject since to Fesse. The buildings are of Mosaike
work, supported with marble pillars: even the shops are under fair and large
porches, and there are arches to part occupations. All the Temples are
beautiful. In this Town the Genowaies, English, Flemings, and Venetians, used
to trade. The Spaniards took it in the 670. of the Heg. but lost it again
within ten days. Fanzara was destroyed by Satrid. who with certain Arabians
besieged Fez seven years together, and destroyed the Villages in the Country
about. Mahmora was made famous by the slaughter of the Portugals, whose blood
dyed the Sea three days together, blushing to see the barbarous Barbarian
spill so much Christian blood. Leo was there present, and numbreth the slain
Christians at ten thousand, besides the loss of their ships and Ordinance,
whereof the Moors took up four hundred great brass pieces out of the Sea,
in the year of the Heg. 921.

Fez, or Fesse, was built in the time of Aron the Calif, in the 185. year of
the Heg. or Mahumeticall computation. It had this Fez signifies gold, in
Arabian.
golden title, because on the first day of the foundation there was found some
quantity of gold. The Founder was named Id^is is, Arons near Kinsman, to whom
the Califaship was more due. For he was Nephew of Hali, Mahumets Cosen, who
married Elsewhere called Fatima.
Falerna, Daughter of Mahomet, and therefore, both by Father and Mother of that
kindred: whereas Aron was but in the half blood, being Nephew to Habbus, the
Uncle of Mahumet. Howbeit both these families were deprived of the Califate:
and Aron by deceit usurped Of this read our third book: the difference seems
to be more in names then truth.
For Arons grandfather fained himself willing to transfer that dignity to
Hali, and caused the house of Vmene to loose it, and Habdulla Seffec became the
first Caliph who persequuted the house of Hali openly, chasing some into Asia,
and some into India. But one of them remained in Elmadina, of whom (because he
was old and religious) he had no great fear. His second Sons grew in such
favor, with the people, that they were forced to flee, and one being taken and
strangled, the other, which was this Idris, escaped into Mauritania, where he
grew in such reputation, that in short time he got both swords into his hand,
and dwelt in the Hill Zaron, thirty miles from Fez, and all Mauritania paid
him Tribute. He dyed without issue, only he left his slave with child; she was
a Goth become Mahumetan, and had a son, which after his father was called
Idris. He succeeded in the Principality, and was brought up under the
discipline of a val^ant Captain, named Rasid: and began to show great
prowess at fifteen years. He afterward, increasing in power, built on the
East Side of the River a small City of three thousand Families. After his
death, one of his sons built an other City on the West Side: both which
Cities so increased, that there was small distance between them. An 180.
years after, there arose civil wars betwixt these two Cities, which
continued a hundred years. And as Esops Kite ^erued the Mouse and Frog, so
Joseph of the Luntune Family, apprehending this advantage, took both their
Lords, and slew them, and thirty thousand of the Citizens. He brake down the
walls which parted the two Cities, and caused many Bridges to be made, and
brought them both to be one City, which he divided into twelve Wards. The City
is now both great and strong. The sweet situation of Fez.
It seems that Nature and Art have play the wantons, and have brought forth
this City, the fruit of their daliance: Or else, they may seem corriuals,
both, by all kind offices, seeking to win her love: So does the earth seem
to dance, in little Hillocks and pretty Valleys, diuersifying the soil: so does
the River disperse it self into manifold channels, no sooner entering the
City, but it is divided into two arms, where with it embraces this lovely
Nymph: and these subdivided, as it were, into many fingers, in variety of
watercourse, insinuating it self unto every street and member thereof: and
not contented thus in public to testify affection, finds means of secret
intelligence with his love by conduit-pipes, closely visiting every Temple,
College, Inn, Hospital (the special chambers of his Spouse,) Yea and almost
every private house: from whence with an officious service he carries the
filth that might offend either sight or sent of his Bride, which still
enjoying, he wooeth, and ever wooing enjoys. Neither is Art behind in his
proffered courtesies, but still presents her with Mosaike works, as chains and
Jewels to adorn her: with fine bricks and stones framed into most artificial
Fabrics, both lovely for delight, and stately for admiration. The roofes of
their houses are adorned with Gold, Azure, and other excellent colors, which
are made flat for the Inhabitants use and pleasure: whose houses are richly
furnished, every chamber with a press curiously painted and varnished. And who
can tell the exquisitnesse of the portals, pillars, cisterns, and other parts
of this Cities furniture? Once, let the Temples therein a while detayne your
eyes, whereof there are in Fez, together with smaller Chapels or Moschees,
about seven hundred, fifty of which are great and fair adorned with marble
pillars, and other ornaments, the chapiters thereof wrought with Mosaike and
carved works. Every one has his Fountains of marble, or other stones not
known in Italy. The floores are covered with mats, closely joined, and so are
the walls a man's height lined therewith. Every Temple has his steeple after the
Mahumetan manner, whereon they, whose office it is, ascend and call the people
at the appointed hours to prayer: there is but one Priest thereunto, who says
their service there, and has charge of the reuennue of his Church, taking
accounts thereof, to bestow it on the Ministers of the said temple, namely
those which keep the lamps light in the night, the Porters, and them which cry
in the nightime, to call them to Church. For he which cries in the daytime,
is only freed from tenths, and other payments, otherwise has no salarie or
stipend. There is one principal and (if we may so term it) Cathedral
Church, called the Temple of Caruven, so great, that it contains in This

yards long, and little less then 80. broad. The steeple is exceeding high.
The roof hereof is supported with 38. arches in length, and 20. in breadth.
Round about are certain Porches on the East, West, and North, every one in
length 40. yeards, and in breadth 30. Under which Porches or Galleries are
Magazines or Storehouses, where in are kept lamps, oil, mats, and other
necessaries. Every night are lighted 900. lamps; for every arch has his lamp,
especially that row of arches which extends through the mid-quire, which alone
has 150. lamps, in which rank are some great lights made of brass, every of
which has sockets for 1500. lamps. And these were bells of certain Cities of
Christians, conquered by the Fessan Kings. About the walls of the said Temple
within, are pulpits of diverse sorts, wherein many learned Masters read to the
people such things as pertain to their faith and spiritual law. They begin

one hour of the day. In Summer they read not but after 24. hours or
Sunne-set, and continue till an hour and half within night. They teach as well
moral Philosophy, as the Law of Mahomet. Private men read the
SommerLectures, only great Clerks may read the other, which have therefore a
large stipend, and books, and candles, are given them. The Priest of this
Temple is tied to nothing but his Mumpsimus, or Service. Also he takes charge
of the money and goods, which are offered in the Temple for Orphans: and
dispenses the reuennues that are left for the poor: every holy day he deals
to the poor of the City money and corn, according as their necessity is more
or less. The Treasurer of this Church is allowed a Ducat a day. He has under
him eight Notaries, each of which have six Ducats a month: other six Clerks
gather the Rents of Houses and Shops, which belong to the Church, retayning the
twentieth part thereof for their wages. Moreover, there are twenty Bailiffs of
the husbandry, that ouer-see the laborers. Not far from the City are twenty
Lyme-kills, and as many Brick-kills, serving for the reparations of the Temple,
and the houses thereto belonging. The reuennues of the Temple are This may be
reckoned as old rent with us, which now is exceedingly improued: for L^o wrote

two hundred Ducats a day. The better half is laid out on the premises. And
if any Temple of the City or Moschee be without reuennue, they are hence
furnished with many things. That which remains goes to the common good of the
City.

In the City are two principal and most stately Colleges of Scholars, adorned
with Mosaikes and carved works, paued with marble and stones of Maiorica. In
each of them are many chambers; in some Colleges are a hundred, in some more,
and in some less. They were all built by diverse Kings of the Marin Family.
One is most beautiful, founded by King Abu Henon. It is adorned with a goodly
Fountain of marble, and a stream continually running: there are three
Cloisters, or Galleries, of incredible beauty, supported with eight square
Pillars of diverse colors, the arches adorned with Mosaike of Gold and fine
Azure. The roof is of carved work. About the walls are inscriptions in Verse,
expressing the year of the foundation, and praises of the Founder. The gates
of the College are of brass, fairly wrought, and the doors of the chambers
carved. In the great Hall where they say their prayers is a Pulpit, that has
9. stairs to it, all of Iuorie and Ebonie. This College cost the founder
480000. Ducats. All the other Colleges in Fesse hold some resemblance with
this, and in every of them are Readers or Professors in diverse Sciences,
provided for by the Founders. In old times the Students were wont to have their
diet and raiment allowed for 7. years, but now they are allowed only their
chamber: for the Bellona, enemy to the Mu^ ses.
wars of Satrid consumed their possessions. So that now there remains but
little wherewith they maintain their Readers, and of them some have 200.
Ducats, some 100. yearly, and some less. And there abide in the said
Colleges, only a few strangers maintained by the alms of the citizens; When
they will read, one of the auditors reads a Text, and the Reader then
reads his Comments, and brings some exposition of his own, and explaneth the
difficulties. And sometimes in his presence the Students dispute of that
argument which he handles.

There are many Hospitals in Fesse, not inferior in building to the Colleges
aforesaid. In them strangers were entertained three days at the common charge.
But in the time of Satrids war the King sold their reuennues. Now, only
learned men and Gentlemen receive entertainment, and poor persons relief.
There is an other Hospital for diseased strangers, which have their diet, but
no physic allowed them. Here also mad men are provided for. In this Hospital
Leo in his youth had been a Notarie. There are in Fez a hundred bath-stoues
well built, with four Halls in each, and certain Galleries without, in which
they put off their clothes. The most part of them pertain to the Temples and
Colleges, yielding them a great rent. They have a yearly festival wherein all
the servants of the Bathes with trumpets and great solemnity go forth of the
Town, and gather a wild Onion, which they put in a brazen Vessel, and bring
it solemnly to the hot-house door, and there hang it up in token of goodluck.
This Leo thinks to be some sacrifice, observed by the ancient Mores, yet
remaining. Every African town had sometimes their peculiat feast, which the
Christians abolished.

Innes here are almost two hundred, built three stories high, and have a
hundred and twenty chambers a piece, with Galleries before all the doors. But
here is no provision of bed or board for strangers. The Inne-keepers of Fez are
all of one family, called Elcheua, and are attired like women, shave their
beards, become womanish in their speech, yea degenerate even to the wheel and
spindle. They are so Infamous Inn keepers.
odious (except to base villains that resort thither) that the better sort of
people will not speak to them: and may not enter the Temple, Burse, or Bathe,
nor into those Innes next the great Temple, where Merchants are entertained.
There are thousands of mils, all almost pertaining to the Temples and Colleges
reuennue. Each trade in Fesse has a peculiar place allotted thereto, the
principal whereof are next the great Temple: as Scriueners, Booke-sellers etc.
every trade by themselves.

The Christian captives rest only upon Fridaies, and eight other days in the
year festival to the Mores. There are six hundred fountains walled about,
the waters whereof are conveyed by conduicts to the Temples, or other places,
because the River is sometimes dry. They have in Fez a Judge for criminal!
causes, and an other for questions of Religion. A third that deals in
Matrimonial cases. From these there lies an appeal to the high Advocate. The
Judges of Mahomets law in matters of conscience have no allowance for the same.
Their marriages are thus. When the Father of the Maid has espoused her to her

lover. They go with their friends to Church, and have with them two Notaries
which draw the couena^ts agreed betwixt them into writing. The Father bestows
a dowry or portion of money, apparel, and such like; seldom, of land. When
the Bridgrome setcheth her home, she is set in a cabinet, covered with silk,
and carried by Porters, accompanied with her Kins-folks, and much minstrelsie:
and the Bridgromes friends go before with torches, and her kinsmen after,
toward the great Church. Then he hastes home, expecting his Bride in his
chamber, whom her Father, Brother, and Uncle, bring and deliver to his Mother:
and he setting his foot on hers, shuts the chamber door. At which a woman
stands and receives of him a napkin stained, which she shows to the
assembly as a testimony of the Brides virginity: but if she be not found a
Maid she is returned to her friends with shame, and the guests go home
without their feast. They hold great feasting also at the circumcision of their
malechildren, which is the seventh day after they are borne. The Barber or
Circumciser is presented with gifts of all the invited guests. Then follows
mirth and iollitie. They use dancings, but the women apart by themselves
without men.

There is a remainder of holy days instituted by the Christians which
themselves understand not. On Christ-masse Even they eat a sallet made of
diverse herbs, and sees all kinds of pulse which they feed upon. On
New-yeares day the children go with maskes on their faces to the houses of
Gentlemen, and have fruits given them for singing certain songs. On the feast
of S. John Baptist they use to make bone-fires. They make a feast, called
Dentilla, (when their childrens teeth begin to grow) unto other children. When
a man dies, the women put on sackcloth, and defile their faces with dirt. They
call to them those wicked men in women's attire, which have four square drums,
to the sound whereof they sing mournful ditties, in praise of the dead party.
At the end of every verse the women utter most hideous shrikes and outcries,
tearing their hair and beating their breasts and cheeks, till they be all
embrued with blood. And thus they continue seven days, and then intermit their
mourning forty days, after which space they resume the same for three days,
as before. But the better sort behave themselves more modestly. At this time
all the widows friends come about her to comfort her, and send her diverse
kinds of meats: for in the mourning house they may dress no meat at all, till
the dead be carried out. The woman which loses her Father, Brother, or
Husband, never goes forth with the Funeral. At some festiuals, the youths of
one street will fight with clubs against the boys of an other street, and
sometimes betake them to other weapons, and kill one an other. Sometimes they
use these bloody fraies without the City, the Officers forcing them to better
order. There are many Poets which pen amorous Sonnets: and on Mahomets
birthday make verses in his commendation, resorting early to the Palace, and
there ascending the Tribunal, read their verses to the people: and he whose
verses are best, is pronounced that year Prince of the Poets. The Marin Kings
on that day used to entertain the learned men, and to reward the best Poet
with a hundred ducats, a horse, a woman-slaue, and the Kings robes which he
ware that day. In Fez are two hundred Grammar Schools, built like great Halls.
Every day they learn one lesson of the Alcoran. They read and write not in
books, but in great These tables are boords like horn books, when one lesson
is learned, that is wiped out, and an other written: and so throughout the
Alcoran, till all be learned.
tables. In seven seven years they learn the whole Alcaron by heart. And then
the father inuiteth his sons Schoole-fellowes to a banquet: and his son
rides through the street in costly apparel, both which are lent by the
Governor. The other boys ride and sing songs in praise of GOD and Mahumet. On
Mahumets birthday every boy must carry a torch to school curiously wrought,
some weighing thirty pound, which they light before day, and let them burn
till Sunrising, singing all the while the praises of Mahumet. The
Schoolemasters have the remnant of the wax which sometimes they sell for a
hundred ducats. They are free Schools anciently built. In the Schools, and
also in the Colleges, they have two days of recreation every week, wherein
they neither teach nor study. There be three kinds of Fortunetellers, or
Diuiners. One of which uses Geomanticall figures: others power a drop of oil
into a glass of water, which becomes clear as a seeing glass: in which
they say they see strange sights, ranks of Devils, like armies, some
traveling, some passing over a River, etc. When the diuiner sees them quiet,
he demands such questions of them as he will, and the Devils with gestures
return answer. The third sort are women-witches, which make the people
believe that they are acquainted with Devils of diverse sorts, red, white,
black: and when they will tell any man's fortune they persume themselves with
certain odors, whereby (as they say) the Devil enters into them, and their
voice is presently altered, as if the Devil spoke within them. And then they
that come to enquire ask their questions, and so having left their present for
the Devil, depart. These Female fifthinesse.
women use unlawful lusts between themselves in mutual silthinesse: and if
fair women come to them they will demand the Devils fee, that they may have
such dealing with them. Yea some addicting themselves to these abominable
practices will feign themselves sick, and send to one of these witches, which
will affirm, that she is possessed with a Devil, and cannot be cured, except
she become one of their society. The foolish husband believes, consents, and
makes a sumptuous feast at that her deuillish admission. Others will conjure
this Devil with a cudgel out of their wives: others faining themselves to be
possessed with a Devil, will deceive the witches, as they have deceived their
wives. There are Exorcists or Diuiners, called Mubazzimi, which cast out
Devils, or, if they cannot, they excuse themselves, and say it is an Aerie
spirit. They write characters, and frame circles on an ash-heape, or some other
place: then they make certain signs on the hands or foreheads of the
possessed party, and perfume him after a strange manner. Then they make their
enchantment, and demand of the spirit, which way he entered, what he is, and his
name: and then command him to come forth. Others there are that work by a
Cabalisticall rule, called Zairagia, and is very hard: for he that does this
must be a perfect Astrologer and Cabalist. My self (it is Leo's report) have
seen an whole day spent in describing one figure only. It is too tedious here
to express the manner. Howbeit, Mahomets law forbids all divination, and
therefore the Mahumetan Inquisitors imprison the Professors thereof.

There are also in Fez some learned men which give themselves the sirnames of
Wisemen and moral Philosophers, which observe laws not prescribed by Mahumet:
some account them Catholic, others not, but the vulgar hold them for Saints.
The law forbids loue-songs, which they say may be used. They have many
rules and orders, all which have their Defenders and Doctors. This Sect sprang
up fourscore years after Mahumet. The first Author thereof was Elhesen Ibnu
Abilbasen, who gave rules to his Disciples, but left nothing in writing. About
an hundred years after came Elbarit Ibun Esed, from Bagadet, who left volumes
of writings unto his Disciples: But by the Lawyers was condemned. Fourscore
years after, under an other famous Professor, that law revived, who had many
Disciples and preached openly. But by the Patriarch and Lawyers, they were all
condemned to loose their heads; the giddie receptacles of such fantastical
devotions. But he obtained leave of their Caliph or Patriarch, that he might
try his assertions by disputations, with the Lawyers whom he put to silence.
And therefore the sentence was revoked, and many Colleges built for his
followers. A hundred years after Malicsach the Turk destroyed all the
maintainers thereof, some sleeing into Cairo, some into Arabia. Not long after,
Elgazzuls a learned man compounded the controversy; so reconciling these and
the Lawyers, that the one should be called Conseruers, the other Reformers of
the Law. After the Tartars had sacked Bagdat in the year of the Hegeira 656.
these Sectaries swarmed all over Asia and Africa. They would admit none into
their Society, but such as were learned, and could defend their opinions: but
now they admit all, affirming Anabaptisticall fancies in Fez.
learning to be needless, for the Holy teaches them that have a clean heart.
Therefore they addict themselves to nothing, but pleasure, feasting, and
singing. Sometimes they will rend their garments, saying, They are then
ravished with a fit of divine love. I think rather superfluity of
belly-cheare is the cause: for one of them will eat as much as will serve
three, or else it is through wicked lust. For sometimes one of the principals
with all his Disciples is invited to some marriage feast, at the beginning
whereof they will rehearse their devout Orizons and Songs: but after they are
risen from table, the elder begin a dance, and tear their garments, and if
through immoderate drinking any catch a fall, one of the youths presently take
him up, and wantonly kiss him. Whereupon arises the Proverb, The Heremites
banquet, signifying, that the Scholar becomes his masters Minion. For none of
them may marry, and are called Heremites.

Among these Sects in Fez are some rules esteemed Heretical, of both forts of
Doctors: Some hold that a man by good Works, Fasting, and Abstinence, may
attain to the nature of an Angel, the understanding and heart being thereby
so purified, say they, that a man cannot sin, though he would. But to this
height is ascended by fifty steps of discipline. And though they fall into
sin before they be come to the fiftieth degree, yet will not God impute it.
They use strange and incredible fastings, in the beginning, but after, take all
the pleasures of the world. They have a severe form of living set down in
four books, by a certain learned man, called Essehrauar de Sehranard in
Corasan. Likewise an other of their Authors, called Ibnul Farid, wrote all his
learning in witty Verses, full of Allegories, seeming to treat of Love.
Wherefore one Elfargano commented on the same, and thence gathered the rule and
the degrees aforesaid. In three hundred years none has written more elegant
Verses, which therefore they use in all their bankets. They hold that the
Heavens, Elements, Planets, and Stars, are one God, and that no Religion is
erroneous, because every one takes that which he worships for God. They think
that all knowledge of God is contained in one man, called Elcorb, elect by God,
and wife as he. Forty, among them are called Elanted, which signifies blocks.
Of these is Elcoth or Elcorb elected, when the former is dead: threescore and
ten Electors make the choice. There are seven hundred and threescore and five
others, out of whom those threescore and ten Electors are chosen. The rule of
their order binds them to range unknown through the world, either in manner of
fools, or of great sinners, or of them the vilest man that is. Thus some
wicked persons of them go up and down naked, shamefully showing their shame,
and like brute beasts will sometimes have carnal dealings with women in the
open streets; reputed nevertheless by the common people for Saints,
Vide.l.3.c.7,
as we have showed elsewhere. There is an other sort called Caballists, which
fast strangely, eat not the flesh of any living creature: but have certain
meats and habites appointed for every hour of the day, and of the night, and
certain set prayers according to the days and months, strictly observing the
numbers of them, and carry square tables with characters and numbers engraven
in them. They say that good spirits appear to them, and talk with them,
instructing them in the knowledge of all things. There was amongst them a
famous Doctor, called Boni, which composed their rule and orders, whose book I
have seen, seeming to favor more of Magic then the Cabala. Their notablest
works are eight. The first, called Demonstration of light, contains fastings
and prayers. The second, their square Tables. The third, fourscore and
nineteen virtues in the name of GOD contained, etc.

They have an other rule among these Sects, called S^uach, the rule of
Heremites; the Professors whereof inhabit woods, and solitary places, without
any other sustenance then those deserts afford. None can describe their life,
because they are estranged from all humane society.

He that would see more of these things, let him read the book of one
Elefacni, who writes at large of the Mahumetan Sects, whereof are threescore
and twelve Principal, each maintaining his own for truth, and the way to
salvation. Two are most predominant in these days; that of Leshari in Africa,
Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and Turkey; and the other of Imamia in Persia, and
Corasan, more lately broched. Although I have spoken before of the Saracen
sects, yet could I not but follow Leo in his reports of them here. As for these
Gold-finders and Alchymists.
Coniurers, which by art magic profess to find gold, which indeed loose
gold to find it; and the Alchymists, which seeking to turn other metals into
gold, turn their gold into other metals, and the books that both these have
of their sciences: likewise the Snake-charmers, and other baser people, I pass
over.

In the Suburbs of Fez are a hundred and fifty caves, hewn out of excellent
marble, the least of which will hold a thousand measures of corn. This is the
sink of Fez where every one may be a Vintner and a Bawd. An other suburb
has two hundred families of Lepers, which are there provided for: and all of
that quality forced to keep there.

In new Fez the Jews have a street, wherein they have their houses, shops, and
Synagogues: and are meruailously increased since they were driven out of
Spain. They are goldsmiths: for the Mahumetans may not be of that trade,
because they say it is usury to sell things made of gold or silver for more
then their weight, which yet is permitted to the Jews. They live in exceeding
contempt, not being permitted to wears shoes, but in steed thereof use socks
made of rushes. They wear a black turbant, and if any will wear a cap he
must fasten a red cloth thereunto. They paid to the King of Fez monthly in
Leo's time one thousand and four hundred Ducats.

The Mahumetan temporal Lords are not by their law to hold any other reuennue,
then of every subject which possesses an hundred Ducats, two and a half for
Tribute, and of corn the tenth measure yearly. Yea, this is to be paid into
the Patriarch or Califs hand, who should bestow that which remains over and
above the Princes necessity, on the common profit; as, for the poor, and
maintenance of wars. But now the Princes have tyrannised further, especially
in Africa, where they have not left the people sufficient for their needments.
And therefore Courtiers are odious (no less then the Publicans sometimes among
the Jews) no man of credit vouchsafing to inuit them to their tables or
receive gifts from them; esteeming all their goods theft and briberie. Nor may
any Mahumetan Prince wear a Diadem, which yet it seems is now broken.

In Gualili a Town of Mount Zarhon is Idris, of whom before is spoken, buried;
all Barbary religiously visits his Sepulcher. Pharao is the name of a Town,
by the vulgar supposed the work of Pharao, which fond conceit grew from a
book, entitled, The book of the words of Mahomet, taken out of an Author,
called Elcalbi, which says with Mahomets testimony, that there were four
Kings which ruled all the world; Two faithful, and two unfaithful: the two
former, Solomon and Alexander Magnus: the two later, Nimrod and Pharao. The
Latin inscriptions there seen show it was the work of the Romans. In Pietra
Rossa, a Town by, the Lions are so tame that they will gather up bones in the
streets, the people not fearing them. The like Lions Tame Lions.
are in Guraigura, where one may drive them away with a staff. At Agla the
Lions are so fearful that they will flee at the voice of a child; whence a
coward braggart is prouerbially called a Lion of Agla. Shame is the name of a
Castle, so called of their shameful covetousness; which, when they once
requested the King then entertained amongst them to change, he consented. But
the next morning, when they had brought him vessels of milk, half filled up
with water, hoping the King would not perceive it, he said that none could
alter nature, and so left them, and their name to them. We have now passed two
Provinces of the Kingdom of Fez: the third is named Azgar, which has the
Rivers Buragrag, on the West; Bunasar, on the South; the Ocean, on the North;
and Eastward, the Mountains. Here stands Casar Elcabir, which King Mansor
gave to a poor Fisher, who had given him kind entertainment in his cottage one
night when he had lost his company in hunting. In it are many temples, one
College of Students, and a stately Hospital. Habat, the fourth Province or
Shire of this Kingdom, is next hereunto, and contains almost 100. miles in
length, and 80. in breadth. Ezaggen, a Town of Fez, are permitted by an
ancient privilege of the Kings of Fez to drink wine, notwithstanding Mahomets
prohibition. Arzilla, says Leo, was taken by the English, then worshippers of
Idols, about 900. years after Christ. The Religion, I think, deceiues him. He
ads, that the Town remained without habitation 30. years, and then one of the
Mahumetan Patriarchs of Cordoua, then Lord of Mauritania, reedified it. Of the
acts of the English it is not unworthy the rehearsing, T. Walsingham hist.Hen.
^c.5.
That Seut or Ceuta (there written Sunt) was taken by the Portugals, through
the assistance of English Merchants, An. 1415. Julian, the Earl of Seut,
brought the Mores first into Spain, in the year of the Heg. 92. In it were
many Temples, Colleges, and learned men. Errif begins at the Streits of
Gibraltar, and stretches Eastward to the River Nocor 140. miles. The
Inhabitants are valiant, but are excessive drinkers. Mezemme and Bedis, or
Velles de Gumera, are chief Towns in it. On Mount Beni Ierso was built a fair
College, and the Mahumetan law publicly taught therein: the inhabitants
therefore freed from all exactions. A tyrant destroyed this College, and slew
the learned men. The books therein were valued worth four thousand ducats.
This was An. 1509. In Mount Beni Guazeual is a hole, that perpetually casts
up fire; wood cast in, is suddenly consumed to ashes: some think it
hell-mouth. In Mount Beni Mesgalda were maintained many Mahumetan Doctors, and
Students, which would persuade the people to drink no wine, which themselves
will not abstain from.

Garet the sixth Shire of this Kingdom, lies between the Rivers Melulo and
Muluia. The seventh is Chauz, reputed the third part of the Kingdom, between
the River Zha and Guruigara. Herein stands Tezza, adorned with Colleges,
Temples, and Palaces. A little River springing out of Atlas runs through the
chief Temple, which is greater then that at Fez. There are three Colleges, and
many Bathes and Hospitalls. Each trade dwells by themselves, as at Fez. I was
acquainted (says Leo) with an aged fire in this City, reputed a Saint, and
enriched exceedingly with the peoples offerings. From Fez did the people resort
to visit him with their offerings, which is fifty miles: he seemed to me to be
a deceiuer. In Mount Beni Iesseten are many iron mines, and the women in great
bravery wear iron rings on their fingers and ears. Ham Lisnan was built by
the Africans, and borrowed the name from the Fountain of an Idol, whose
Temple was near the Town: to which at certain times in the year resorted
men and women in the night: where, after Sacrifices, the candles were put out,
and each man lay with the woman he first touched. Those women were forbidden to
lie with any other for a year after. The children begotten in this adultery,
were brought up by Priests of the Temple. The Moors destroyed this
Holy-Stewes, and the Town, not leaving any mention thereof. In Mount
Centopozzi are ancient buildings, and near thereto a spacious Hole, or dry
Pit, with many rooms therein: they let men down into the same by Ropes with
lights, which if they go out they perish in the pit. Therein are many Bats
which strike out their lights. In the Mountains of Ziz there are Serpents so
tame, that at dinner time they will come like Dogs and Cats, and gather up the
crumbs, not offering to hurt any. Thus much of the Kingdom of Fez out of Leo, a
learned Citizen of Fez, and great traveler, both in the places and Authors of
Afrike: whom Ortelius. Maginus; Boterus follow, commended by Bodin. Method c.^.
Ant.Pess. de hist. Apparat. l.16. ser.7. c.2.
Bodinus, Posseuinus, and others, as the most exact writer of those parts, and
translated into English by Mr. Porie, from whom if I swerve in diverse things,
impute it to the Italian Copy of Ramusius, which differs not a little,
especially in these things I have here set down, from the English.

I thought good here also to add out of others some such customs and rites as
they observe in Fez, and other parts of this Kingdom History of Barbary.
To.C.
Their circumcision is used in their private houses. Women may not enter the
Moschee for their often uncleanness, and because Eve first sinued. The eight
day after a child is borne the Parents send for a Ialby or Priest, and some old
men and women, where after a few prayers said, the women wash the child all
over with water, and give the name, making a banker. But sometimes the
circumcision is deferred diverse years after this ceremony, as the Father
thinks meet.

Their fasts they observe very strictly, not so much as tasting water till the
Stars appear. Yea, diverse have been seen by their rigor in this
superstition to faint, and some to die. A certain More in the time of their
Lent (which continues thirty days) in the company of an English Gentleman,
being thirsty with heat and travel, went to a conduit in Marocco (where the
same religion is professed as in Fez) and there drinking, was so reviled of the
people, that in a desperate anguish he slew himself with his dagger. Yet does
their law allow an exchange some days of this Lent, with other days in the
year following, if travel then hinder. Their feasts and fasts are at the same
times and in the same manner that the Turks observe, of which is before
spoken. Their Easter they call Rumedan: their Whitsontide, Lidhiber: their
Michaelmasse, Lashour: their Candlemasse, Lidshemaw: (if it be lawful thus to
parallel those vain superstitions with Christian observations.) In this last
feast, which seems to be the same that Leo calls Mahomets birthday, every
one must have a candle for himself, and for every Son in his house. The King
has that day candles carried to him, some like May-poles, other like Castles,
six or eight men carrying one of them: so artificially composed, that some are
in making six months. That night the King does hear all the law read: the
like is done in all other Churches. The Talby that cannot read all their law
in a night is held insufficient for his place. They go (says my Author) six
times in four and twenty hours, (which is once oftener then is written of the
Turks, except on their Sabbath) to their prayers, first washing themselves, as
they do also after the offices of nature, and after company with their wives,
thinking thereby to be washed from their sins. Their times of prayer are, two
hours before day, the first: when the Monde^, or sexten cries in the steeple
(as you may read in our Turkish relations) and then may no man touch his wife,
but prepare himself to pray (with washing or other devotions) either in his
own house, or at Church. After their public prayers the Talby sits down and
spends half an hour in resolving the doubts of such as shall move any
questions in matters of their law. The second time of prayer is two hours
after, when it is day. The third at noone. The fourth at four of the clock in
the afternoon. The fifth at the twilight. The last, two hours after. In the
first of these they pray for the day; in the second they give thanks for it; in
the third time they give thanks for that it is half passed; in the fourth they
desire the Sun may well set on them; at twilight they give thanks after their
daily labors; the lasttime, they desire a good night. They think it unseemly
to eat meat with their left hands, and hold it unclean, and do all with
their right hand. Their Sabbath or Friday is not exempted from work: Only they
are then more devout in going to Church.

Their Churches are not so fair generally as in Christendom, nor have seats
in them; ornaments, or bells: (only the floores are matted) they are also poor
for the most part; as are their Churchmen. Their Lyturgie is very short, not
so long as the Pater ^oster and Creed: other set form they have not, but every
one prays after his own pleasure. Although the Moore may have four wives,
and as many Co^cubines as he can purchase, yet few marry four, because the
wives friends will have a sufficient bill of Dowry for her maintenance, which
none but rich men can perform: and again, the wives challenge his nights
company, and that in course: if any be neglected, she complains to the
Magistrate, and he forces the husband to his duty, or else to send her home
with her Dower, and a bill of divorce. The Concubines are embraced with more
stolen pleasures. That bill of Dower holds the husband in awe, which else
would make a slave of his wife, or still change for younger flesh. The Bride is
bedded before her husband see her: and if he find her not a Virgin, he may
turn her home and keep her portion by law. For their funeral rites; when one
is dead they presently wash him, and speedily put him into ground (the heat so
requiring) and after that, the women at convenient times have a custom to
meet, and make memorial of their deceassed friends with remembrance of their
virtues, which they think causes men to have more respect to their good name.
Their other obsequies are before declared. The King uses to sit in judgment
on Fridayes in the afternoon: and the Musti sits with him at other times in
judgment: but on the Friday he sits alone by himself. Of these Mufties are
three; one at Marocco; an other, at Fez; the third, at Taradant in Sus, an
other part of this Seriffian Kingdom. Other Judges sit all the year long two
hours before noone, and as many after. Before these every man pleads his own
cause: and if the witnesses can be proved to be infamous of life, or not to say
their prayers six times a day, their testimony is disabled. The Scriuanos are
Talbies, which assist the Judge, and in his absence supply his place. The
Fokers or Saints ( Leo before calls them Heremites) dwell in the best places of
the Country, keep great hospitality for all travelers, whither any man may
come for a night, and be gone in the morning. They give great example of moral
living, and alms to the needy, comprimising matters of difference betwixt
parties and repressing disorders. They are much loved and respected, and their
houses are holden sanctuaries, whose privileges the King will not break, but
upon weighty reasons.

Of the Kingdom of Marocco, with a discourse of the Kings thereof, and of the
Seriff, xarif, or Iarif, and his posterity, now beginning in Barbary.

THis Kingdom is situate Boter.part.I.Maginus.
between Atlas and the Atlantike Ocean, bearing name of the chief City
thereof: fruitful of corn, oil, grapes, sugar, honny, and cattle. They make

which hence is called Marocchine. This Kingdom is divided into seven
Provinces, through which we intend our next perambulation, taking Leo Leo.
part. 2.
for our guide: beginning at Hea, which on the North and West has the Ocean,
Atlas on the South, and the River Esisnual on the East. The people feed on
cakes of Barley, and on a pappe, or hasty-pudding of barley meal, which being
set in a platter, all the Family compass about, and rudely with Natures
spoones claw forth those dainties. Napery they use none, a mat laid on the
ground serves for table and cloth, and stools too. Cappes are the privileges
of age and learning. Linen shirts are almost banished their Country: and so
are Arts liberal and mechanical, except some simple Lawyer which can make
some shift to read, and a Surgeon to circumcise their children: Their physic
is cauterising as men deal with beasts. They are always in mutual wars one
with an other, yet will not they injury a stranger, who if he would travel
amongst them, must take some harlot, or wife, or religious man, of the adverse
part with him. At Tednest, one of their Cities, such respect is had to
strangers, That if a Merchant come thither and has no acquaintance, the
Gentlemen of the City cast lots who shall be his Host, and they use him kindly,
looking only for some present at his departure, in token of thankefullnesse.
And if he be a meaner person, he may choose his Host without any recompense
at all. In the midst of the City was a great and ancient Temple with many
Priests attending their devotions, besides other meaner Oratories. This City
has since been ruined and desolate. In Teculeth were 1000. households, four
hospitals, one beautiful Temple, and a house of religious persons: destroyed
it was by the Portugals, An. 1514. as Hadecchis had bin the year before.
Ileusugaghen is another town of Hea, or of Hell rather, so full is it of
confusion, blood, and murders, besides the want of learning, civility Judges,
Priests, or whatsoever else may detain those men from a beastly or
diuelishMetamorphosis. The Seriff, being made a Prince of Hea, brought me
thither to be a Judge, but for fear of Treason amongst them we were glad to
leave them. How far off in manners is their near neighbor Tesegdelt? Where
a guard is set at gates not so much to keep out enemies, as to entertain
strangers, whom at his first coming they ask if he have any friends in the
City: if not, they must provide him entertainment at free cost. They have a
most beautiful Temple, furnished with Priests. Taglesse, the next town, is a
den of thieves and murderers. When I was there, such a swarm of Locusts
ouer-spread the Country, that scarce might a man see the earth, eating up
their fruits.

Culeihat was built of a cetraine Sectary in our time, first a Preacher,
attended with troops of Disciples, after, a cruel and merciless tyrant,
murdered at last by one of his wives for lying with her Daughter: and then his
villainies being manifested, the people put all his followers to the sword.
Only a Nephew of his fortified himself in a Castle, which he held maugre all
their might, and burying his Grandfather, taused him to be adored as a Saint.
Homar Seijef was the name of that Rebel. The other parts of Hea are like the
former, some exceeding Hospital and courteous, some brutish without divine or
humane learning or living. Great store of Jews live here, and in Mount
Demensera are of those Jews which are called Karraini Scripture-Iewes.
Carraum, of the rest accounted Sectaries. These reject the Traditions, and
hold them only to the written Scriptures (as in our Jewish relations ye have
read.) In Mount Gebelelhadih are many Heremites, which live on fruits of Trees,
and water, so reputed of the simple people, that all their doings are accounted
miracles.

Sus is the second Region of this Kingdom, lying Southwards from hence on the
other side of Atlas, so called of that River which is the Eastern border
thereof, otherwhere bounded with the Sea and the Deserts. At Messa near the
Sea side is a Temple holden in great veneration. Many Historians affirm that
from this Temple shall come that just Califa, of whom Maho^^^et Prophesied.
There also they say the Whale vomited up Jonas. The Rafters and beams of the
Temple are of Whales bones; which usually are there left dead on the Shore.
This the common people esteem to proceed from some divinity of that Temple:
but the true cause is certain sharp Rocks a little off in the Sea. I my
self was invited by a Gentleman, who showed me a Whales fibbe, so huge, that
lying on the ground in manner of an Arche, under it, as it were through a gate,
we rode on our Camels, our heads not reaching to touch it. It had been there
kept a hundred years for a wonder. Amber is there found in abundance, which
some think proceeds from the Whales, and is either the Ordure or the Sperme
and feed thereof. Teijent is a City of Sus, wherein is a great Temple, and an
Arm of a River passes through the same. There are many Judges and Priests,
whom in their Ecclesiastical affairs they obey. Tarodant has three thousand
Families: sometimes the place where the Kings Lieutenant or Deputy resideth.
Tedsi is much greater, adorned also with a Temple, and furnished with Priests
and Ministers: Judges and Lecturets paid at the common charge.

In mount Hanchisa it snowes in all seasons of the year, and yet the
inhabitants go thinly clothed in the sharpest Winter.

The Region of Marocco is three-square: confined with the mountains Nefisa, on
the West; and Hadimeus, on the East; between the Rivers Tensist, and
Esifinuall. The country in fertility of soil resembles Lombardy. Marocco
(which some think to be Bocanus Hemerus of Ptolomey) was built (says Leo) by
Joseph son of Tessin, King of the people of Lontuna. It was built by the
advice of excellent Architects, and cunning workmen. In the time of Hali son
of Joseph, there were in it ten thousand fires or Families, and more. It had
four and twenty gates: was strongly walled: furnished with Temples, Bathes.
Colleges, Innes, after the African manner. One most slately temple was built
by Hali, and called by his name. But a successor of that kingdom, called Abdul
Mumen caused to berazed, and built again, and called after his own name,
howbeit the name of Hali is still continued in the Title, all that his cost not
withstanding. This Abdul Mumen, who was the second that by rebellion succeeded
in the kingdom, built an other Temple, which Mansor enlarged fifty yards or
else on every side, adorning it with many Pillars fetched out of Spain. He made
a cisterne or vault built under it, as large as the temple it self; and
covered the Temple with lead, with leaden pipes from the roof, to convey the
rain water that fell thereon, into the cisterne. He built thereon a steeple
like the Coliseo or Amphitheatre at Rome, of great hewn stone. The compass of
this steeple or tower is a hundred Tuscan yards or else, higher then the
steeple of Asenelli at Bononia. There are seven losts one above another, very
fair and light some. Upon the top of this tower is built a little turret,
the top whereof is as a needle or spire: and it contains five and twenty
yards in compass, and is as high as two great lances, with three lofts
therein, one higher then the other. On the top of this spire is a broch with
three globes of silver one under an other, the greatest below, and the least
highest. From the top hereof the mountains of Azafi may be easily seen, a
hundred and thircie miles off: and a tall man on the ground seems as little as
a child of a year old. The plain country fifty miles about is hence
discerned. It is one of the greatest Temples in the world; and yet not
frequented, the people assembling thither to their devotions, but on fridays:
the city it self near this Temple is ruinate, so that the passage is made
difficult by the ruins of houses. Under the porch or gallery of this Temple
were sometimes a hundred shops of Booksellers, and as many ouer-against them,
but now An. Dom. 1526
there is not one in all Morecco: Scarcely is the third part of the city
inhabited: the rest being planted with vines and trees, the Arabians not
suffering them to exercise any husbandry without their walls. It was built anno
424. of the Hegeira. After Joseph the Founder, and Hals his son, Abraham
succeeded, in whose time, a rebellious preacher called Elmahels, borne and
brought up in the mountains, rebelled, and with an army incountred king
Abraham, and overthrew him. The king fled, and was so hardly pursued by Abdul
Mumen, whom Elmabels had sent after him, whiles himself be sieged Marocco,
that the poor king in danger to be surprised at Oram, mounting on his horse,
and taking his wife behind him, set spurs to his horse, and so came all 3.
down together on the merciless rocks. Abdul Mumen returning victorious,
found this addition to his happiness, that Elmabeli was dead, and himself was
chosen King and Prelate (or Chalipha) by the forty disciples, and ten
secretaries of Elmaheli, a new custom in the Mahumetan law. He maintained the
siege, and at the years end, entered by force, and took Isaac, the little and
only son of Abraham, and stabd him with his own hands, killing most of the
soldiers he there found, and many of the citizens. His posterity reigned
after him, from anno 516 of the Hegeir. to the 668. at which time the family of
Marin deprived them, in which the kingdom continued til the 785 year. Then the
same decreasing in power, Marocco became subject to certain lords of the old
hill, near to the city. But of none received they so much damage, as of the
Marin family, which held their court in Fez, and had a Lieutenant only in
Marocco; Fez being made chief city of Mauritania. Let me borrow of Cali. Sec.
Call Sec Curio de regno Mar. page.356.
Cario in his history of the kingdom of Marocco, which (for the most part) is
taken out of Leo. He says that Abdul Mumen subjected to his empire all
Barbary, from Messa to Tripolis; his Empire in Africa comprehending 90 days
iourny in length, and 15 in breadth. He also possessed the kingdom of Granada
in Spain, sometime called Betica, and from Tariffa to Tarracon, and a great part
of Castilia and Portugal. Neither had he alone this large Empire, but his Leo
reckons them in this Order. Abdul, Joseph Mansor, Jacob Mansor, and this
Mahomet Enasir: whereas Curio seems to insinuate a longer line of posterity:
these being all, directly and immediately succeeding.
son Iasippus, after him, Iacobus Mansor his nephew, and their posterity, til
Mahumet Enasir, who an 1212 in the kingdom of Valencia was overthrown of
Alphonsus (as I take it) the ninth king of Castil, in that place which is
called Las navas ds Tolosa; loosing in the battle 60000 men. In memory of
which battle and victory, that Alphonsus adorned his Scutchion with a Castle
Or, in a field purple: which custom his successors do still observe, because
that day that golden Kingdom, as a strong Castle, confirmed to him by the
blood of his enemies, was delivered from those miscreants: And thereupon that
Kingdom of the Bastitanes (so it was before that time styled) was entitled
Castile. Moreover, he instituted that Knightly Order of Saint James, who have
in their habit purtraied a purple sword, in token of blood. This Mahumet our
Historians call Miramulinus. For Abdul Mumen entitled himself Miralmumin, the
name signifying, The Prince of believers, which others corrupting call
Miramulin, as they did him Abed Ramon. Howsoever it stands for the name and
arms of Castile; certainly Curio was not curious, nor careful enough in
adding, that this Abdul Mumen was in the time of Rodericus the Gottish King,
about seven hundred years after Christ, as also in his Saracenicall History
he relates, and we before have observed, seeing that Marocco was long after
built, and diverse hundreths of years were interposed betwixt Rodericus, and
this Abdul Mumen; Curio herein Curio, fault a^iseth from con^ounding the
Histories of Abea Kamon and Abdul Mumen, which lived some Centuries of years.
after the former.
differing not only from Leo, is best guide in the rest of his History, but
from himself, as will easily appear to any that list to compare his
Saracenicall History with the Marochian.

I cannot omit that which Matthew Mat.Par.in Johan p. 233.
Paris has written of John King of England, about these times, and in his own
days. He sent, says he, Thomas Herdinton and Radulph Fitz Nicholas Knights,
and Robert of London Clerk, to Admiral Murnselius, king of Marocco, Africa,
and Spain, whom they commonly call Miramumelius, to make offer unto him of his
Vassallage, and that he would not only hold the Land of him with payment of
Tribute, but would also change his Religion, and accept the Mahumetan. The
Ambassadors having declared their message, the King (or Emire Elmumenin to
call him rightly) shut up the book whereon they found him reading, and after a
little deliberation thus answered. I was now reading a Greek book of a
certain wise man, and a Christian, called Paul, whose words and deeds well
please me; this only I like not, that he forsook the Religion wherein he was
borne, and inconstantly embraced another: and the same I say of your Master.
GOD Almighty knows that if I were without the Law and now to choose, this
above all other should be my choice. And then, by diverse questions enforming
himself better of the state of the Kingdom and of the King, he grew into
great passion and indignation against the King, protesting that he thought him
unworthy to be his confederate, and commanded the Ambassadors never more to
see his face. The Author heard Robert of London, one of those which were sent,
relate these things.

But to return to our Marocchian buildings. In it is a great Castle, in the
mids whereof is a fair Temple, and thereon a goodly Tower, and on the top of
the same an iron broche, with three golden Globes weighing a hundred and
thirty thousand Barbary Ducats, in form like those before mentioned. Diverse
Kings have gone about to take down the same, but always some strange misfortune
has befalne them, whereby they have been forced to leave their attempt.
Insomuch that it is holden a sign of ill luck to take them from theuce. The
vulgar conceit is, that some influence of the Plane^s is cause hereof. And also
that she that set them there, by Art Magic enchanted certain spirits to a
perpetual Station there for to guard them. The people indeed are the spirits
which in our time kept the Kings fingers from them, who else would have
adventured all those phantasied dangers to have possessed himself of the gold
for his wars against the Portugales. The Wife of King Mansor is reported to
have set them there as a Monument of her memory, having sold her Jewels to
purchase them. Adrianus In Theatt. vrbium.
Romanus says, that the Talofi, Numidians, and all Barbary come to Marocco, to
study and learn Grammar, Poetry, Astrology, and the Laws. There is also in
the said Castle a College for the receipt of Students, which has thirty
Chambers, and beneath, a spacious Hall, where in old times Lectures were read:
and all the Students had their expenses allowed them, and raiment once a year:
and the Readers for their stipend had, some a hundred ducats, some two hundred,
according to the quality of their profession. No man might be admitted into
that College which was not well instructed in the Principles of Arts. The
excellency of the matter and workmanship might well detain us longer in the
view thereof, but that it is now rather become a Sepulcher of Sciences, then a
Theater, there being not above five Students under a senseless Professor,
left in Leo's time, as the ghosts of those sometimes renowned numbers of
Scholars. There were built also by Mansor, twelve stately palaces in the said
Castle, for his Guard, Officers, Armories, and other purposes fitting both Mars
and Venus. There were also goodly and spacious Gardens, and also a Park with
many kinds of wild beasts, as Giraffas, Lions, Elephants, etc. There was a
Leopard made of Marble, the spots not borrowed, but Natures handy-worke. But
alas, Devouring Time, that swalloweth his own offspring, was not content to
have inglutted his insatiable paunch with the flesh of those beasts, and men,
branded with Natures stamp of mortality; but even those curious and costly
stones are now become graue-stones to themselves provoking the beholders at
once to compassion and amazement; the Relics of laborious Art still
contending with Time, to restifie what greater excellence has been. The
Garden is now become the City dunghill, the Library in steed of books is
furnished with nests of Doves, and other fowls. That overthrow which Mahomet
the King of Marocco received in Spain, was the occasion of the ruin of that
Family, which was furthered by his death, leaving behind him ten sons which
contended amongst themselves for the Kingdom, and slew one another. H^revpon
the people of Marin, entered into Fez, and possessed themselves of that
Kingdom: the Habduluad Nation seized on the Kingdom of Telensin, and removing
the Governor of Tunis made whom they pleased King. After the ruin of Mansors
progeny, the Kingdom was translated to Jacob, son to Habdulach, first King of
the Marin Family. Lastly, this Kingdom declining, the Arabians by continual
outrages have further distressed it, forcing the people to what pleased them.
Thus far Leo: who saw not the influence of a Star, even in his days, in
his eyes, and of his acquaintance, arising, which after in his exaltation
brought a new alteration to Marocco, and all those parts of Barbary. I mean
the Seriffo, a name usually given unto such as profess themselves descended of
Mahomets kindred, from whence also this we speak of derived his Pedigree. The
History I think here worthy to be inserted: the rather because this Western
star is now declining, and by his fiery gleames, seems to be near his
setting. And thus in effect does Boterus G.B.B. part 2.l.2. out of whom
^^^aister Pory and the Description of the world has translated the same.
relate the same.

About the year 1508, began to grow in name, through Numidia, a certain
Alfaique, borne in Tigumedet in the Province of Dara, being a subtle man, and
no less ambitious in mind, then learned in those Sciences, whereunto the
Mahumetans are most addicted. He, by confidence of his blood (descended of
their Prophet) and of the divisions of the States of Africa, and the exploites
there daily achieved by the Portugales, attempted to make himself Lord of
Mauritania Tingitana. For this cause he sent his three sons Abdel, Abnet and
Mah. to visit the sepulcher of Mahomet. Much was the reverence, and reputation
of holiness, which they hereby acquired amongst that superstitious people, which
now beheld them as saints, and kissed their garments as most holy relics.
These failed not in their parts of the play to act as much devotion, as high
contemplative looks, deep-fetched sighs, and other passionate interiections of
holiness could express. Ala, Ala, was their yernfull no^e, their food was the
peoples alms. The old Father ioying to see his proiects thus far proceed,
and minding to strike whiles the Iron was hot, sent two of them to Fez; Amet,
and Mahumet: where one of them was made Reader in the Amodorac^ia, the most
famous College of Fez, and the younger was made Tutor to the Kings young sons.
Advanced thus in favor of the King and People, by their fathers advise, they
apprehended the present Occasion of the harms sustained by the Arabians and
Mores under the Portugales Ensigns: they demanded license of the King to
display a Banner against the Christians, putting him in hope easily to draw
those Mores to him, and so to secure the Provinces of Marocco. In vain were
Mulley Nazer the Kings brother his allegations, not to arm this Name of
Sanctity, which being once victorious might grow insolent, and forget duty in
minding a Kingdom. They obtain their desires, and with a Drum and Banner,
with Letters of commendations to the Arabians, and people of Barbary, they are
so attended with forces and fortunes, that Ducala, and all as far as Cape de
Guer stoupes to their command: the people willingly yielding their Tents to
this Holy war against the Portugales, enemies of their faith. Hereunto was
added the overthrow which they gave to Lopes Barriga, a famous Portugal
Captain, the brightness of that sunshine being somewhat ecclipsed with the
loss of their elder brother, if rather a Monarchy were not hereby furthered.
By fair words they entered into Marocco, and there poisoned the King, causing
Amet Serisso to be proclaimed in his steed, King of Marocco. The Arabians of
Ducala and Xarqu^a, about this time trying their quarrels by dint of sword in
mutual conflicts, presented as it occasion to the Seriffs, to prey upon them
both; their strength having made them weak, and their weakness making the
other strong. And now did they begin to usurp souereinty, presenting their
Fessan King, with six Horses, and six Camels, and those but simple, whom before
they had acknowledged their Sovereign, with payment of the if fifths of their
spoil. The King of Fesse before applauding his own victories in theirs, began
now to distaste, and to distrust: he sends to them to demand his fifths, and
the tribute also formerly paid him by the King of Marocco. Death, the common
enemy of mankind, here interposed her self on the Seriffian part, and took
the King of Fez out of the world; the Scepter descending to his son Amet, the
scholar of the young Seriff: who not only proceeded not in his fathers
demands, but confirmed Amet in the Signiorie of Marocco, so that in some small
matters he would acknowledge the souereintie of Fez. But now the Seriffs, whose
hearts continually increased with their fortunes, sent him word; that being
lawful successors to Mahomet, they owed no man tribute, and had more right in
Africa then he: if he would respect them as his Friends and Allies, so it
were, it otherwise, they which had power to offend the Christian, should not be
destitute in defending themselves. The sword; the vnequallest arbiter of
equity, is now made vmpire; the Fess in proclaims wars, besieges Marocco,
is dislodged, and in his return vanquished. Thus have the Seriffs acquitted
themselves of that yoke, and now intend new conquests on the other side of
Atlas, and in Numidia, and in the mountains, which happily they archieued.
Yea, the Portugales wearied with the wars, which they were forced to
maintain in defense of those places they held in Africa (the expenses so much
^u^ mounting the revenue) abandoned them to the Seriffs. And now the want of
enemies procured enmity betwixt the brethren, who trying that valor against
each other, which before they had exercised jointly against their enemies, the
issue was, that the younger, in two battles having overcome the elder, and at
the second, which was Anno 1544, having taken him prisoner, confined him to
Tafilete. He now sole Monarch of Marocco, conuerts his forces against the King
of Fez, to try if he could be his Mr. in the field, as he sometimes had been in
the school, and failed not of his attempt, but having once taken and freed
him, the second time because he had broken promise, he deprived him and his
sons of estate The end of the Reign of Marins.
and life. He also by means of his sons took Tremizen, which soon after
was recovered from them by Sal Araes Viceroy of Algier, and Fez also added, by
an overthrow of the Seriff, to the Turks conquest, who gave the government: of
Fez to Buasson, Prince of Veles. But he in an unfortunate battle with the
Seriff, lost his life and state. Mahomet going after to Taradant, was by the
way slain in his Pauilion, by the Treason of some Turks suborned thereunto by
the King of Algier, of whom all (but five) in their return were slain by the
people: Anno 1559. Mulley Abdala, the the Seriffs son, was proclaimed King.

Some R^.C. his History of Barbary. Capit.1.
write that by occasion of a rebellion in Sus, he sent to the bordering Turks
for aid, who first helped, after murdered him, and having sacked Taradant,
and ouerrunne the country two months together, were in their return by the
Mountainers cut off. Mully Abdala having reigned fifteen years died, leaving
behind him thirteen sons; the eldest, Abdela, commanded the rest to be
killed: but Abdelmelech the second brother escaped into The Turks fingers have
i^ched to be dealing with these parts, ever since Solimans time: Nic.Honiger:
and have therefore willingly entertained all occasions to effect their ambitious
designs.
Turkey, and Muley Hamet, the third brother, esteemed of a simple and quiet
spirit, not any way dangerous to the state, was spared. The other ten were put
to death in one day at Taradant, where they had been brought up. This Abdela
dying, left behind him three sons; Muley Mahomet, Muley Sheck, Muley Nassar:
the two younger escaped into Spain, where Sheck is yet living, and turned
Christian. Nassar returned in the fourteenth year of Muley Hamets reign, and
had almost driven Muley Sheck, then Governor of Fez under his Father, to his
heels, had not superstition more prevailed with Nassars followers, then
Allegiance. For when Lent came, his Soldiers would needs home to keep their
Easter at their own houses: for fear whereof Nassar hastily giving battle,
was there slain. Abdelmelech before fled into Turkey, now came back with
Turkish forces, and got the Kingdom from Mahomet who sleeing, or as others
write, sending for succor to Sebastian King of Portugal, obtained it. In the

has it, setting in order his Armada of five hundred sail, and blessing his
Royal Standard with thirty six thousand footmen, and four thousand horse,
set forth toward Africa: Where Abdelmelech being sickely, had assembled an
Army of fifteen thousand footmen, and four and forty thousand horsemen. On
the fourth day of August, they joined battle, and the Duke of Auero, with his
Portugals, made a great impression into the Mores host, which Abdelmelech
laboring beyond his natural force to withstand, saved his people, but lost
his life, not by the sword of the enemy, but by the weakness of his body
delivered up to death. His brother Hamet ruled the Army (as yet ignorant of
what had befalne) and made such slaughter of the Portugales that the Duke of
Auero, the King of Portugal, and other great Personages there fell, and
Mahomet himself was drowned, in fleeing over a River. Thus remained Hamet,
victorious, and at one time had the dead corpses of three Kings in his Tent.
Such is the fury of war, the force of death trampling under foot the
meanest, and triumphing over the greatest. Stukely among the rest, received due

the inhabitants of the plain and Champaine Countries of Marocco, Fez, and Sus)
in peace and subjection receiving their tenths duly paid. The Brebers or
Mountainers, a people of another language and disposition, he could not so
easily came, and therefore in policy he drew them into foreign expeditions,
especially against the Negros, thereby extending his Empire so far that way, as
by Camel it was six months ionrney from Marocco, to the extr^amest bounds.
Likewise he used them to go with the Carauan is a company of merchants going
together with their goods and beasts
Carauans to Gago to fetch home his yearly Tribute. He conquered Tombuto and
Gago, about the year 1594. as appears by the letters of Madot. Hackluyt.
Laurence Madoc, who saw thirty mules laden with gold come from thence to
Marocco, and says that Tombuto rented threescore quintals of gold. His
provisions for his Iugenewes or Sugar-gardens, for his buildings, maintenance
of his women (rather for the pomp then the sin) I let pass. For passed they
are now and gone, together with himself, his three sons, by civil wars,
leaving scarf hope of good, or place for worse estate then is now in Barbary,
and has been these many years. His sons were Mahomet, commonly called
Sheck, a title proper to the Kings eldest son. Boferes was his brother by the
whole blood: Sidan, by another woman; as were, Nassar and Abdela. Muley is a
title of honor, given to the Kings children, and all of the blood Royal.
Muley Sheck was made governor of Fez in his fathers life time; Boferes, of
Sus; and Sidan, of Tedula, in the mid way be^weene Fex and Marocco. Muley Sheck
so displeased his Father by his unbridled courses, that he went with an Army
to Fez to displace him, and to set things there in order, leaving Boferes
(lately returned from Sus, because of the Plague) in the government of Marocco.
Sheck took Sanctuary with five hundred of his best Soldiers, from whence
his father caused him to be brought by force, and sent him prisoner to
Mickanes: but before he could finish his purposes, the 14. of August, 1603.
he died. Sidan had followed his father in this expedition, and taking
advantage of his presence, seized on the treasures, and proclaimed himself
King of Barbary, and heir to his Father. What Sidan had done at Fez, the like
did Boferes, at Marocco, and at Taradant. Nassar made some stirs, but soon
after died of the P^ague. Boferes sends Basha Iudar to encounter with Sidan,
who was now come with his forces against him, and because himself had not the
heart, to hazard his person in battle, knowing that it would be no small
discouragement, if there were none his equal in blood, he on certain
conditions, freed his elder brother Muley Sheck, who the sixth of January, 1604.
chased Sidan out of the field. Hence all old quarrels, and seuds, and
robberies, and a world of other mischiefs now Of these wars and the
Genealogy of this Seriffian Family, See Laur. Bayerlincki opus Chron. 10.2.in
Ana. 1603.
began to fill all the parts of Barbary. Muley Sheck in Fez proclaims himself
King. Thus is all inuerted, many Kings, and few Subjects: none now in this
uncertainty paying their accustomed tenths, intending rather mutual feuds and
battles, betwixt their several Tribes and kindreds, then common fidelity and
allegiance. Sidan by aid of the great Foquere, or Heremite, obtains Sus, the
people yielding obedience to none but whom that Religious person shall appoint
them: by means of him also, a peace was concluded betwixt Boferes, and Sidan
in August. 1604. Thus was the War continued between Sheck and Boferes.
Abdela, Shecks son, drives Boferes out of Marocco, in the latter end of the
year: 1606. using his victory with bloody cruelty, besides the rifling and
pillage of the goods in the city. Blood is a slippery fundation, and pillage a
pill'd wall: so fell it out to Abdela, who soon lost the city to Sidan, which
he had taken from Boferes, after a bloody field fought betwixt them in April
after. Here Sidan puts to the sword 3000. Fessans, which had taken sanctuary,
and came forth disarmed, upon promise of pardon, which Boferes after with like
persidiousnes, and breach of promise requited on 3000. Marochians. The Shracies
(which are mountainers, near to Algier, but no more respecting the Turks
there, then the Brebers do the Serif) fell at variance, and began to mutiny in
the Army of Sidan, whom they served and cut off the Bashas head, who was their
General, which caused Sidan to execute unjust cruelties against all of that
Tribe in Marocco giving the Shracees goods to the murderer whomsoever. On the
six and twentieth of November, 1607. Abdela ioineth in battle with Sidan,
provoked by those Shracees who thirsted for revenge of Sidans Tyrannies, where
many English, under Captain Gisfard, and other Captains, were slain, Sidan
chased, and Marocco recovered.

But whiles these brethren contend, Muley Hamet Bosonne their Cousin, rich in
reasure, richer in hopes, thought it fit time to take up that kingdom, which
these with warring for it, lost. He gathering together whatsoever forces he
could make, came toward Marocco: Abdela heard and feared, and having spied a
man upon a Hill with a spear in his hand, with white lin^en like a flagge upon
it: his fear (an untrusty messenger) told him, that all Bosonnes Army was
behind the Hill, (although it were then a full days March from thence) and
lent him wings to fly to Fez. The man was but a silly More, which had washed
his linen, and dried it on his spear point. Bosonne enters Marocco, and
proclaims himself King, but loses both City and Kingdom in April
following, 1608. and after a second overthrow received by Sidan now Master of
Marocco, he was by Alkeid Azus his means poisoned. Muley Sheck loath to leave
Marocco to Sidan, sends Etina an Italian Merchant into Spain, with promise,
to the Catholic King, of Allaroche, Saly, Alcasar, and other towns to turn
Spanish, if he would help him to his right in Afrike. This Negotiation was
well entertained, and the Spaniard (they say) now has Allaroche; the cause
that he which now has obtained the State will not be called King, till he
has regained it. For the opening of this (I suppose you are weary of those
unnatural and bloody spectales which this History presents unto you, and
therefore I have) you must now conceive that according to the report of such as
came lately from thence, Boferis is dead, Muley Sheck shifts for himself
where he can, Abdela rules in Fez, and Sidan has lately lost Marocco. The
history, or (if you will) the Mores report of the present state, as by a
friend of mine lately come from thence I am given to understand, is this. A
certain Foquere, Heremite, or Saint, (names given by diverse to the same)
called Habet Ben Abdela, lived in the mountains of Atlas, where sometime he
entertained Sidan to his great content, fleeing then to his The Mores call
their protection or defense, a horn, as is usual in the scriptures.
borne or defense, in time of distress. This man the Mores report to be a
great Magician, that he could feed three hundred Horse at one pit of Barley,
and the same no whit diminished, that he foretold of plenty the last year,
which came accordingly to pass, that he could by his Art secure men from the
danger of Gunshot. If any believe not these things, yet let him believe that
the credulous and superstitions More (which easily conceiueth and receives any
thing but truth) believes it, and then it belongs to our discourse, who
rather attend what they do believe, then what they should. This is that they
tell, that Hamet Ben Abdala, being in great reputation for wealth, learning,
and holiness, gathered a band of men, and conducted them this last spring to
Marocco. He challenged not the Kingdom to himself, but said that the first of
the Family of the Xerisfe had done well, though he usurped, but his posterity
had broken the kingdom, and God was not pleased with them. (This is the
opinion of that Religion, to measure Gods approbation of things by the event
and success.) He further alleged a certain prophecy of the reign of one
All. This they say is his son, or some other which he carries with him.
For he has two tents, the one white, wherein himself lodges: the other red,
wherein abides (they say) one which they suppose shall be their King, whom
they never see. Sidan with an Army of sixteen thousand, gives him battle at
Marocco, the 5. of June, this present year, 1612. and was overthrown. For he
went himself, and led his company on the mouth of the ordinance without
harm: he causing (as the Mores report) that the Bullets should still remain
in the pieces when they were discharged, as he had often for the confirmation
of his people made trial before, setting forty Gunners to shoot at as many
others without harm, by the like Art. Thus he lost none of his own, and many
of the other were slain. Sidan fled to Sali, and embarkes his two hundred
women in a Flemming; his riches, in a Marsilian: this was taken by Don Luys,
the Spanish Admiral, wherein were thirteen Chests of Gold: the other at S.ta
Cruz, met Sidan, and delivered him his women. Men were more necessary, which he
wanted, and yet (worse then their want) some offered their service for pay, and
receiving it, forsook him, whereby he was forced to flee into the Mountains,
where he is said yet to remain. Hamet, now called Mully Side Hamet Ben Abdala,
placed a, Governor in Marocco, another at Taradant, the chief Gitie of Sus.
His march was in great hypocrisy (I may rather call it then simplicity) in a
Straw Hat, and a patched garment, while crown and Robes imperial are the
marks he shootes at. And so we leave him, and these relations to your censure.
We must forward on our Pilgrimage, we have sufficiently filled our eyes with
blood in this Barbarian Tragedy. Now let us take more quiet view of the other
parts of this kingdom.

Agmet was sometimes called a second Marocco, l.eo l.2.
from whence it stands four and twenty miles. The hills and valley about
it, adorned with Gardens and Vineyards, a fair River, and fertile fields,
yielding fiftie-fold increase, have assembled Natures forces to join with Art,
(if Magike may be so termed, and the Histories write true) for the common good
of Agmet, and Marocco. The River runs (as is thought) to Marocco under the
ground; which secret passage is attributed to the wizards of Joseph, founder of
Marocco, left the vvater-course should be cut off from the City. This
fruitful Agmet in Leo's time was peopled only with Foxes and wild beasts,
saving that a certain Heremite held the Casdtle, with a hundred of his
Disciples.

The The Mountains of Marocco.
mountains are very rude, according to their rough and cold places of
habitation, many of them covered continually with snow. In Nififa they gaze and
wonder at strangers: in Sem^^e they forced Leo to play the Judge and Notarie
(accepting no excuse) eight days: and then set him in a Church Porch, and
after a certain prayer, presented themselves with their presents before him,
cocks, hens, nuts, garlike; and some of the better sort, a goat, which all he
gave to his host: money they had none for him. In Secsiua there is at all times
of the year, snow. There are many great Caves wherein they winter their
beasts, in November, January and February. They wear no shoes, but certain
sandals, and are lusty men, at ninety or a hundred years old: Temnelia is an
heretical Hill and Town, which has a fair Temple. They are of Elmaheli his
Sect, and challenge any stranger which comes amongst them to dispute. In
Hantera are many Jews of the Carraim Jews.
Carraim Sect.

The fourth Region of this kingdom is Guzzula, confining with the hill I^da on
the West, Atlas on the North, Hea on the East. They have no walled Towns, but
great Villages: neither have they King or Governor; the cause of civil wars
amongst them: yet do they observe three days in a week truce, when every man
may travel or barter safely. A certain Heremite, who was reputed a Saint, was
Author of this three days truce in each week. He had but one eye. I my self,
says Leo, saw him and found him to be trusly, courteous, and liberal.

Duccaia the fifth Region lies between Tensift and the Ocean, Habid and
Omirabih. At Azaph^ the Prince was (in Leo's time) murdered at Church, whiles
he was in his Devotions, by a subject, who was chosen Governor; but the
Portugals obtained the place. Az^^, a city exc^edingly addicted to Sodomie,
was also punished with Portugal slavery, and most of the Country thereabouts.
In the hill called Greene-hill live many Heremites, of the fruits only there
growing. Here are many Altars and Saints after the Mahumetan fashion. Mahumet
King of Fez, in the year of our Lord 1512, passed this way with his army, and
at every Altar made a stand, and there kneeling, would thus say: My God, thou
know that my intent of coming to this wild place, is only to help and free
the people of Duccala from the wicked and rebellious Arabians, and from our
cruel enemies the Christians: and if thou do not approve it, let thy scourge
light only on my person: for these people that follow me deserve not to be
punished. Hence he sent me Ambassador to Marocco.

Hascora the sixth region of Marocco is situate between the river Tensift and
Quadelhabid. Ale^din in Hascora was conquered to the King of Fez by a merchant,
whose paramour the Prince had taken away; for which adultery he was by the
Judges condemned to be stoned. The Prince of Temcenes was so addicted to
Arabian Poetry, that he gave Leo, then a youth of sixteen years old, fifty
ducats for certain verses he had made in his prai^e, and twice as much he
sent to his uncle for the same cause, with a horse and three slaves.

Tedles is the seventh Province of this Kingdom, lying between Guadelhabid
and Ommirabih. Tefza the chief town is beautified with many Temples, and has
store of Priests. The towne-walls are built of a kind of marble called Tefza,
which gave name to the town. Mount Deeds is in this Province, where the people
(for the mo^ part) dwell in Caves under the ground: they have neither Judges
nor Priests, nor honest men among them. For other places, if any think us not
more than tedious already, let them resort to Leo, whom all follow in their
relations of these parts.

Of the Arabians and natural Africans; and of the beginnings and proceedings
of the Mahumetan superstition in Africa: of the Portugalles forces and exploits

Having often mentioned the Arabians in our former Chapters, it seems fit to
speak somewhat of the coming of that Nation, and their religion, into Africa
from the East, as also of the Arms of the Portugalls (before often spoken of)
which from the West have made some impressions in these parts. The Arabian

Theophanes, and I here from him. The first of these was Persia or Chorost^^;
the second, Egypt; the third, Africa; the fourth, Philistiem or Rhamble; the
fifth, Damascus; the sixth, Chemps or Emessa; the seventh, Chalep; the eight,
Antiochia; the ninth, Charan; the tenth, Emet; the eleventh, Esipe; the
twelfth, Musel; the thirteenth, Ticrit. But when as Africa shook off the yoke
of the Ameras of Bagdad, and had an Amera of her own, afterward by occasion
of the weakness of the Amera of Bagdad, the Amera of Persia or Chorasan freed
himself also, and called himself Amerumnes, wearing the Alcoran hanging down
his neck in Tables like a chain, and says he is of the kindred of Alem: and
the Amera of Egypt (to whom the Amera of Arabia Faelix, had always been
subject, became also his own man, calling himself Amerumnes, and deriuing his
pedigree from Alem. This as it gives light to the Saracen History in general,
so it shows the greatness of the Arabian or Saracenicall power in Africa,
where first they made head against their masters, in the time as is said
before of Elagleb then Deputy or Amera in Cairaoan, whose example became a
president to the Amera's of Persia and Egypt: and (which is more to our present
purpose) was occasion of further spreading their superstition through Africa;
the fountain or sink thereof being n^w not far off in Damasco or Bagdad,
but in the heart of Africa, Satan there choosing his Throne for these his
Vicars, or Chalipha's (for so the word says ^^^ Scal. Can. ^^^.li.3. Chalipha
est Vicarius, quonomine ^^^ qui^^^ ^^^ M ^^^ ^^^ sunt, qui and duna's and
bonomis ^^^.
Scaliger signifies) which as you have heard, were too faithful in that their
infidelity. And because I have mentioned Scaligers interpretation of the word
Chal^pha, it should not be amiss to add out of the same place, that the
first Governors or Generals after Mahumet (or as he calls him, Muhammed) were
called Emirelmumenin, that is, Captains of the Orthodox or right Believers.
Afterward, because under color of Religion, they sought, not only of
Priestly Primacie, but a tyrannical Monarchy, they chose rather to be called
Chalipha. The first Emirelmumenin was Abubecher. When his successors sent
their Lieutenants into Africa and Spain, they governed a while under them,
doing all in the name of the Emirelmumenin, although nothing in a manner but a
Title was wanting of the fullness of power to themselves. But after, they
entitled themselves Emire Elmumenin, and of Deputies became Kings: which was
done by the petite Kings of Spain, and the Governors of Africa. And now the
King of Marocco and Fesse uses it. For it is not a proper name, but as the
French King is called Christianisimus, and the Spanish Catholicus. Thus far
Scaliger: which serves as a gloss for those former names of Amera, Amerumnes,
Chalipha, Miramuldinus, and many other hence corrupted.

The means of these and other Saracens enlarging their Sect have been
principally by Arms; and where they were not of force, by traffic and
preaching, About 200. years after the death of Mahamet, all Barbary was
infected with that pestilence. Leo.lib.1.
as on the other side of Ethiopia, eve to Cabo de los Corientes in the
kingdoms of Magadazo, Melinde, Mombazza, Quiloa, and Mosambique, besides the
Islands of Saint Laurence, and others. But the greatest mischief that happened
to Africa, by the Arabians, was about the sour hundredth year of the Hegeira.
For before that time, the Mahumetan Chalipha's, or Amera's, had forbidden the
Arabians to pass over Nilus with their tents and families, that so the
Country was still peopled by the ancient Inhabitants, howsoever it were
governed by them. For such multitudes of unbridled and barbarous nations were
not likely to prove dutiful subjects to the Empire. About that time, eone
Elcain the schismatic Chalisa of Cairaoan, as is before in part showed,
having by his General Gehoar conquered all the Western parts, as far as
Sus, employed the same man's valor for the conquest of the East. And Egypt
being now together with Syria subdewed; Elcain himself seeing the Chalipha of
Bagdet, made no preparation to withstand him, by the advice of Gehoar, (which
at that time sounded Cairo) passed into Egypt, thinking to inuest himself with
the Saracenicall soueraignetie, committing the government of Barbary to a
Prince of the tribe Zanhagia, who in this absence of his Lord compacted with
the Chalipha of Bagdet, and acknowledged his Title in Barbary, receiving in
reward of his treason from that Bagdet Prelate the kingdom of Africa. Elcain
having lost his morsel, to snatch at a shadow, was in great perplexity what
course to take, tilla Counselor of his persuaded him that he might gather
great sums of gold, if he would let the Arabians have free liberty to pass
through Egypt into Africa: which, though he knew, that they would so waste it
by their spoils as it should remain unprofitable, both to himself; and his
enemies, yet incited by two vehement Orators, Couetousnesand Revenge, at last
he granted. And permitted all Arabians, which would pay him ducats a piece,
freely to pass, receiving their promise, that they would become deadly enemies
to the Rebel of Cairaoan. Whereupon ten Tribes or Kindreds of the Arabians
(half the people of Arabia deserta) and a multitude also out of Arabia Faelix
(as writes Ibnu Rachu a famous Historian, out of whom Leo has drawn a great
part of his African History) accepted the condition, and passing the Deserts,
they took Tripolis, sacked Capes, and after eight months siege, entered into
Cairaoan, filling with blood, and emptying with spoil, all the places where
they prevailed. Thus did these kindreds of Arabians settle themselves in these
parts, and forced the Provinces adjacent to tribute: and remained Lords of
Africa till Joseph founded Marocco, who aided the posterity of the Rebel
against them, and brake their yoke from the Cities tributary.

But Mansor the fourth King and Chalipha of the Sect of Muoachedin, begun, as
is said, by Elmahels and Abdul Mumen, preferred the Arabians, and induced them
to make war upon those their enemies, whom easily they conquered. He also
brought all the chief and principal of the Arabians into the Western
Kingdoms, and assigned them more noble places for habitation, to wit, the
Provinces of Duccala and Azgar: to those of mean condition he appointed
Numidia, which at first were, as it were, slaves to the Numidians, but after
recovered their liberty, and obtained the dominion of that part of Numidia
assigned them, every day increasing in power. Those which inhabited Azgara and
other places in Mauritania, were all brought into servitude. For the Arabians
out of the Deserts, are as Fishes out of the Water. Atlas on the one side, and
the other Arabians on the other side, suffered them not to pass into the
Deserts, and therefore they laid down their pride, and applied themselves to
husbandry, dwelling in their tents, and paying yearly tributes to the Kings
of Mauritania, from which those of Duccala, by reason of their multitudes were
free. Many Arabians remained still in Tunis, which, after Mansors death, they
took and made themselves Lords of the Regions adjoining: where some of them
bare great sway till Leo's time: the other deprived of their wonted pay at
Tunis, committed great robberies and slaughters of merchants and travelers.

The Arabians, which inhabited Africa, are divided into three Peoples, Hile^t,
and C^achin, which are said to descend of Ismael, therefore by the Mahumetans
esteemed more noble: the third is termed Machill, derived from Saba, and came
thithet out of Arabia Faelix. The divisions and subdiuisions of these into
their several Tribes and Families, which Leo has done, would perhaps to our
nicer Readers seem but an harsh heap of strange names, and for their sakes I
will refer the studious hereof to that our Author.

The Tribe Etheg, which Manser placed in Duccala, and in the Plains of Tedles,
in later times suffered much damage by the Portugalles on the one side, and the
Kings of Fez on the other: they are about one hundred thousand men of war,
half horsemen. The Sumaites in the Deserts near Tripolis can arm four score
thousand men: Sahid in the Deserts of Libya, can bring into the field almost an
hundred and fifty thousand of their Tribe. The Ruche are not rich, but in
agilitie of body miraculous, and account it a shame if one of their footmen be
vanquished of two horsemen: nor is any amongst them so slow that he will not
outgoe any the swiftest horse, be the journey never so long. The Vode dwell
between Gualata and Guadin, and are esteemed about three score thousand
warriors. The other kindreds of them are exceeding many, dispersed through
Africa, some-where commanding, other-where subject. And as they live in diverse
places, so do they observe differing customs. Those which do dwell between
Numidia and Libya live miserably: they make merchandise of their Cameils with
the Negros, and have many horses in Europe, termed horses of Barbary. They are
much addicted to Poetry, and make long Poems of their wars, huntings, and
lo^^es, with great elegance, and that in rithme, like the vulgar Italian
Sonnets. They are (the destiny of Poets) courteous, but poor. The Arabian
Inhabitants between Atlas and the Sea, are more rich in corn and cattle, but
more base and barbarous in conditions. Amongst the Arabians near Tunis, a good
Poet is highly esteemed, and amply rewarded of their great men, neither can the
neatnes and grace of their verse easily be expressed. When they go to war,
they carry their wives with them on camels, and that (to make up the wonder) to
encourage them. The Arabians between Barbary and Egypt lead a wretched life
in those barren deserts, forced, not only to exchange their cattle for corn,
but to pawn their sons in great numbers to the Sicilians, who if they break
day, make slaves of them: and therefore they exercise all robberies, and sell
any stranger (they can lay hold on) to the Sicilians for corn.

Now for the natural and native Inhabitants of Africa, the white men (so they
are in comparison of the Negros) are divided into five peoples, Sanhagia,
Musmuda, Zeneta, Haoara, and Gumera. The Musmuda inhabit the regions of Hea,
Sus, Guzula, and Marocco. Gumera inhabiteth the mountains alongest the
Mediterranean, from the Streits to Tremizen. These two dwelseuered from the
others, and maintain continual wars one with another. As Authors say, they
were wont to have tents, and the wide fields for their habitation, and those
that were conquered, were sent to inhabit Cities, the Conquerours were Lords
of the fields. The Tribes or Peoples Zeneta, Haoara, and Sanhagia, inhabit
Temesne. The Zeneti chased the family of Idris from the dominion of Africa and
Fez: and were again themselves, after that, deprived by the Sanhagian families
of Luntuna, and of Abdul Mumen. The Benemarini a Zeneran family recovered the
Empire long after.

They are in these times To. C. history of Barbary.
divided into Brebers and Alarbies. The Brebers inhabit the Mountains: The
Alarbees, the Plains. Both of them maintain deadly ^^udes, and will fight
forer battles in such quarrels, then in service of their King. Insomuch, that
upon loss of any great man, cruel battles have been fought, and ten thousand
men slain at a time. The Alarbees have their fairest Virgin riding on a
Camel, with a flagge in her hand, decked in all pomp to solicit her Kindred
to revenge, and goes foremost in the field encouraging them to follow. The
kindred spares no blood to save their Virgin, which the other side strives to
win, holding that a continual glory to the seventh generation. When a man
is killed, his Tribe seeks not revenge on the murderer only, but on the
first man of that Tribe he meets with. The Brebers do likewise. Their women
follow them in their battles, with a certain color in their hand called
Hanna, which will stain, and therefore they throw it upon such as offer to
run out of the field, the basest ignominy that can befall them.

The Larbie and Breber do differ as much in language, as Welsh and English;
the one is given to Husbandry, the other very much to Robbery. Mully Sidan in
these late wars seeing the Larbees also become robbers, caused the next
Dwarre (a town of Tents) belonging to that Tribe which herein had faulted, to
be destroyed, man, woman, child, kine, sheep, and whatsoever belonged to
them; by his soldiers. But after he had lost the field in the battle with
Muly Sheck, they foraged up to Marocco gates, trusting to the strength which
that Tribe could make, being fifteen thousand horse. This Tribe or Kindred was
called Weled Entid.

In Africa they are much subject to the cough: insomuch ^ ^^^ lib. 1.
that on the Fridayes, when they are at their Mahumetan sermons, if one fall a
coughing, another follows, and so from hand to hand all take it up, and hold
on in that sort, till the end of their sermon, no man hearing what has been
said.

For their moral ^he general vices of the Africans, chap.8.
conditions, Leo thus describes them, as we have somewhat mentioned before:
The Inhabitants of the Cities in Barbary are poor and proud, irefull, and
writing all injuries in marble: intractable, and unfriendly to strangers:
simple, and credulous of impossibilities. The vulgar is ignorant of Nature, and
esteem all works thereof divine and miraculous. They are irregular in their
life and actions, exceedingly subject to choler, speak aloft and prowdly, and
are often at buffets in the streets. Thus base is their disposition, and no
less is their estimation with their Lords, who make better account of their
beasts. They have no chief men or Officers to rule or counsel them. They are
ignorant of merchandise, being destitute of bankers and money changers, and
every Merchant is constrained to attend his wares himself. No people under
heaven more covetous: few amongst them, which for love of God or man will
entertain a stranger, or requite a good turn: always encombred with
melancholy, they addict themselves to no pleasures: the reason where of is,
their great poverty and small gains.

The shepherds, both in the mountains and fields, live a labor some and
miserable life; a beastly, th^^uish, ignorant kind of people, never repaying
any thing committed to them. The young women before they marry may have their
lovers in all filthiness, none of them bestowing her virginity on her
husband; if they be once married, their lovers do no more follow after them,
but betake them to some others. The brutish father makes this odious love to
his daughter, and the beastly brother to his whoorish sister. The most of them
are neither Mahumetans, Jews, nor Christians, but without faith, and without
so much as a shadow of Religion, neither making any prayers, nor having any
Churches, but live like beasts. And if any has any smacke of devotion, yet
having no Law, Priest, nor any rule to follow, he is forced to live like the
other. Many of them, both in Cities and fields, are found favoring of better
things, both for Arts, Merchandise, and Devotion, as the same Leo shows: but
thus are the most inclined.

Now, to add somewhat further of the Mahumetan Religion in Africa. Anno 714.
(as some do Ant. Gueuara Epistol. ^^ de Barros Asia dec. 1. lib.1
reckon) the Saracens, by the incitement of I^^^us Earl of Seuta, as in our
third Book is related, invaded and conquered Spain. Leo in his fifth Book
attributes this to Muse Governor of Africa, under Qualid Some will have this
Qualid or V^, robe the Miralmu^min of Africa a Maraunian, whom Leo makes the
Eastern Chalipha.
the Chalipha of Damasco, whose next successor deprived Muse, and sent Iezul to
Cairaoan to succeed in his room, whose posterity there governed till that
house was deprived of the Chaliphshippe, and the seat thereof removed from
Damasco to Bagdet. Then was Elagleb made Lieutenant of Africa, and held it with
his posterity after him one hundred and seventy years. After which time El
Mahdi an heretical Chalipha dispossessed them. Of this El Mahdi, and Elcain,
and their supposed heresies, I have no certain History. Certain it is, that
the Mahumetans from the beginning were divided, as appears of Idris in our
History of Fez: and more fully in the Catalogue of Mahomets next successors,
which were the next, not in blood, but in power. So did Bubac, or Abubacer
challenge it, and after him Homar and Ottoman: contrary to the Testament of
Mahomet, who appointed Hali his heir. Muavias also murdered Hali and his
son, to obtain the soueraignetie. Thus were they divide about the true
successor of their false prophet; which fire is not yet extinct. Another
division was about the interpretation of their law. G. B. E. Hist.Sar.lib. 1.
Abubacer gave foundation to the Sect Melchia or Melici embraced by the
Africans: Homar was author of the Sect Anesia, which the Turks and Zaharans in
Afrike receive. Odman or Ottoman left behind him the Banesia, which has also
his followers. Hali was head of the Imemia, which is followed by the Persians,
Indians, many Arabians, and Gelbines of Africa.

Curio calls these Sects Melici, embraced of the Africans, and as he
affirms. Asafij of the Syrians and Arabians, Alambeli of the Persians, and
Bnanisi of the Alexandrians and Assyrians. Foreign names can scarcely be
translated, but withal are traduced, and of diverse diversely called. Of these
four grew three score and eight Sects of name, besides other more obscure.
Amongst the rest were the Morabites, who led their lives (for the most part) in
Hermitages, and make prosession of moral Philosophy, with certain principles
differing from the Alcoran. One of these was that Morabite, which certain
years past showing Mahomets name imprinted in his breast, being done with
aqua fortis, or some such thing, raised up a great number of Arabians in
Africa, and laid siege to Tripolis, where being betrayed by his Captain, he
remained the Turks prisoner, who sent his skin to the grand Seignior. These
Morabites affirm, that when All or Hali fought, he killed ten thousand
Christians with one blow of his Sword, which they say was an hundred cubits
long. The Cobtini is as foolish a Sect, one of which showed himself, not many
years since, at Algier, mounted on a reed, with a bridle and reins of
leather, affirming that he had ridden an hundred miles on that horse in one
night, and was therefore highly reverenced. Somewhat also is said before of
these African Sects in our Chapter of Fez.

An other occasion divided Africa from other of the Mahumetan superstition. For
when Muavia and Iezid his son were dead, one Marvan siezed on the
Pontificality, but Abdalam the son of Iezid, expelled him. He also had slain
Holem the son of Hale a little before, whom the Arabians had proclaimed
Chaliph, and therefore made the Maraunian flock, of which he descended, odious
to the Arabians. They therefore at Cusa chose Abdimelic for the Saracenicall
sovereign, who was of Halis posterity, which they call the Abazian stock or
family. He sent Ciafa against Abdalan, who fled and was slain; Ciafa
exercised all cruelties against all that Maraunian kindred, drew Iezid out of
his Sepulcher, and burnt his carcass, and slaying all of that house, cast
their bodies to the beasts and fowls to be devoured. Whereupon one Abed Ramon
of that family, (some suppose him the son of Muavias) fled into Africa, with
great troops of foilowers and partakers, where the Saracens received him very
honorably. Barrius Dec. i. lib. I. Asia.
tells that Ciafa himself was Caliph, and that he descended of Abaz, of whom
that stock was called Abazian: and that he took an oath at his election, to
destroy the Maraunians, which he executed in manner as aforesaid by Abidela his
kinsman and General. To Abed Ramon resorted the Mahumetans in Afrike, who
equalling his heart to his fortunes. called himself Miralmuminin, which is
^is-pronounced Miramuli^, and signifies the Prince of the Believers; which he
did in disgrace of the Abazians, Some attribute the building of Marocco to him,
which others ascribe to Joseph, as before is said, and some to some other
Prince, built (as they say) in emulation of Bagdet was built long after Abed
Ramons time.
Bagdet, which the Eastern Calipha builded for the Metropolitan City of their
Law and Empire. Barrius adds, that he became a Nabuchodonofor, to whip and
scourge Spain, which Vlit his son, by Musa his Captain, wholly conquered in
the time of Rhoderious. But Pelagius soon after with his Spanish forces
began to make head against the Moors, and recovered from them some towns:

had done him in these wars, gave him his daughter in marriage, and for her
portion, those parts which he had taken from the Moors in Lusitania, since
called the kingdom of Portugal, withal, that he or his could conquer from
them. Thus were the kingdom of Portugal planted in the blood of the Moors,
whereby it has been so fatned, and has so batned ever since, that all their
greatness has risen from the others loss. For they not only cleared those
parts of that kingdom of them, by an hereditary war, but pursued them also
into Africa, where John the first took Seuta from them, so making way to his
Posterity, to pierce further, which happily they performed.

Cities, and a great part of Mauritania; the Arabians not refusing the
Portugals service, till the Seriff arose in Africa, as even now was showed, and
chased the Portugals thence.

Thus Spain has revenged herself of the Mahumetan injuries by her two arms;
of Castile (which at last drove them out of Granada, and took diverse Towns in
the Maine of Africa from them, and in our days has expelled the remainders of
that Race quite out of Spain;) and Portugal, which thus freed it self, and
burdened them, and by another course did yet more harm to the Mahumetan
profession. For Henry, son of John the first, set forth Fleets to discover
the Coasts of Africa, and the Islands adjacent, diverse of which were by the
Portugals possessed; made way to the further discoueries and conquests of that
Nation in Africa, and India, to these our days, where they have taken diverse
Kingdoms and Cities from the Moors. Of which, other places of this History

Dantiscanus. P. Iarric lib. 3.
Barrius in his Decades, of Osorius, Maffaeus and Arthus, Iarric, and others,
are ample witnesses.

CHAP. XIII.
Of Biledulgerid and Sarra, otherwise called Numidia and Libya,

WE have now, I suppose, wearied you with so long discourse of that part of
Africa on this side Atlas, but such is the difference of the minds weariness,
from that of the body, that this being wearied with one long journey, if the
same be continued with a second, it is more then tired: the other after a
tedious and irksome way, when another of another nature presents it self, is
thereby refreshed, and the former wearinsse is with this variety abated, yea
although it be, as this is, from a better to a worse. Even the mounting up this
cold hill, and thence to view the Atlantike Ocean on the West, Southward and
Eastward the deserts, will neither make the soul breathless with the steep
ascent, nor faint with so wild prospects of manifold wildernesses; this of
barren Earth, and that of ba^^ Waters; a third seeming to be mixed of both, a
sea without waters, and earth without soliditie, a sand not to hazard ships
with her privy ambushments, but with open violence swallowing men, and
disdaining to hold a footprint as a testimony of subjection; a wind not
breathing air, but sometimes the higher element in fiery heats, and sometimes
the lower in sandy showers: once, a Nature mocking Nature, an order without
order, a constant inconstancy; where it is Natures pastime to do and undo;
to make mountains and valleys, and mountains of valleys at pleasure.
Strange is the composition of these places, but stranger is that of the mind,
which feeds it self with the cruel hunger, and satiates thirst with the
insatiable thirstinesse of these deserts. And whereas the body fears to be
drowned, even there, where it as much fears to want water, in this sandy
journey: the Soul (model of Divinity, life of Humanity) fears no such
accidents to it self, but in a sweetness of variety delights to survey all
that her first and ancient inheritance (howsoever since by sin mortgaged and
confiscated) and being sequestered from all societies of men, can here
discourse with GOD and Nature in the Deserts. Hither now, after so long a
preamble, we bring you, and at first present unto your view Numidia, where you
shall be feasted with Dates, which have given the name Biledulgerid (that is
Date-region) thereundo, and before is made one entire part of seven, in our
Lib.6.cap.1.
division of Africa. L^d^ui^us L. Marmelius.
Marmelius writes it Bild el Gerid

The Eastern Border is Eloacat, a City distant 100 miles from Egypt; the
Western is the Atlantike Ocean; the Northern, Atlas; the Southern Libya.
This is the basest part of Africa Leo lib.1.
; the Cosmographers not deigning it the name of a Kingdom, the inahbitants
thereof are in many places so far distant from any other. As for example,
Tesset a City of four hundred households, is separated from all other
habitation three hundred miles. Some places thereof are better peopled. The
Numidia described by Ptol. lib.4. Plin.lib. 5 cap 3. P. Mela.l.1.c.6. Olinarius
in Melam. Cael. Rhod.lib. 18. cap. 38.
Ptolomey, Mela, and Pliny, is of far less bounds, and is rather a part of
Barbary, then of this which we here describe: called (says Pliny)
Metagonitis, and famous for nothing but Marble and wild beasts: the Numidae
called Nomades of their pastoral life, and change of pastures, carrying their
houses on their carts. The Cities whereof were Cyrtha, called now Constantina
and Iol, now as some write Bugia. The Numidians are notorious for excessive
venery. For the Religion of these, whom Leo terms Numidians, he says, That
in old time they worshipped certain Planets, and sacrificed to them: and were
like to the Persians in worship of the Sun, and the Fire, to both which they
built Temples; and like the Vestals in Rome, kept the fire continually burning.
Christian Religion began to quench this fire (as is Mermannij Theatrum.
thought) in the Apostles days, which after was perverted by Arianisme,
subverted by Mahometisme. Jewish religion had here some footing also, before
that Christianity was preached to them.

The Numidians live long, but lose their teeth betimes (sour sauce for their
sweet Dates) and their eyes also pay untimely tributes to the sands, which the
winds very busily and often send as their searchers and customers, till at
last they can see to pay them no more. In all Numidia the French disease (as we
term it) is unknown, and in Libya. I have known, says Leo, an hundred
persons that have been cured of that malady, only by passing over Atlas and
breathing this air. This disease was not heard of in Africa, till King
Ferdinand expelled the Jews out of Spain, and the Moors by lying with the
Jews wives got the same; and generally infected Barbary, calling it therefore
the Spanish disease. The Plague also infecteth Barbary once in ten, fifteen,
or five and twenty years, and destroys great multitudes, because they have
little regard or remedy for it. In Numidia it is scarce known once to happen
in an hundred years, and in the Land of Negros never. Worse diseases then Pox
or Plague possess the Numidians, namely, ignorance of Divine, Moral, and
Natural knowledge, Treason, Murder, Robbery, without all respect of any
thing. If any of them are hired in Barbary, they are employed in base offices,
Scullians, Dungfarmers, and what not? Neither are the Libyans or Negros much
better.

Of the Numidians and Libyans are five peoples, Zenaga, Guenzaga, Terga, Lemta,
and Berdeua, and live al after the same manner, that is, without manners or
order at all. Their garments of base cloth, scarce cover half their body.
The Gentlemen (Gentlemen must pardon me the abasing of the name) to be
distinguished from the rest, wear iacket of blew cotton with wide sleeves.
Their Steeds are Camels, on which they ride without stirrops or saddles, and
use a goad in stead of spurs, and a lether fastened in a hole bored through
the gristles of the Camels nose, serves them for a bridle. Mattes made of
rushes are their beds, and wool growing on their Date-trees yields matter for
their tents. Their food is oftentimes patience with an empty belly: which when
they fill, bread or meat after any sort is absent: Only they have their Camels
milk, whereof they drink a dish-full next their heart: and certain dry
flesh sodde in butter and milk, every one with his hands raking out his share
of these dainties, and after drinking the broth; and then drink up a cup of
milk, and supper is done. Whiles milk lasts they care not for water,
especially in the Springtime; all which soason, some never wash hands or face,
because they never go to the places where they may have water. And the Camels
have joined with their masters in this neatness, not regarding water, whiles
they may feed on grass.

All their life (or that space rather before they die, not worthy the name of
life) is spent in hunting, and robbing their enemies; not staying above three
or four days in a place, as long as the grass will serve their Camels. They
have over every tribe one, in manner of a King, whom they honor and obey. Very
rarely is a Judge found amongst them, and to him such as are litigious ride
sometimes five or six days journey. Him will they amply-reward with a thousand
ducats, more or less by the year. As for Letters, Arts, Virtue, they dwell
not in these deserts. They are very jealous, which is the death of many. Yet
are they liberal after their manner to strangers, as I my self (it is Leo's
report) can testify. For going over the deserts with a Carauan of Merchants,
the Prince of Zanaga encountered us with five hundred men on Camels, and caused
us to pay our customs: and then invited us to his tents. There did he kill
many Camels to feast us, both young and old, and as many gelt, and Ostriches,
which they had taken in the way. And when the Merchants showed themselves loath
that he should make such slaughters of them, he said that it were shame to
entertain them with small cattle only, being strangers. So we had roast, and
boiled: and bread of Panike, very fine; and Dates great plenty. He honored our
company with his presence; but he ate together with his Nobles separate from
us: and had with him certain religious and learned men, to sit with him, which
all the meale-time touched no bread, but only flesh and milk. The reason the
Prince gave us, because they were borne in the deserts where no corn grew.
Only they ate bread on certain solemn Feasts, as at their Easter, and day of
Sacrifices. Thus did this liberal Prince spend on us ten times the value of
his customs. After this manner also live the Africans called Soaua.

The Tracts of Numidia Leo lib. 6.
most in name, are these: Dara, which extends it self two hundred and fifty
miles in length, where are great store of Date-trees, whereof some are male,
and some female; the first brings forth only flowers, the other, fruit. And
they take a flowred bough of the male, and engraft it in the female: otherwise,
the Dates prove naught, and almost all stone. They feed their Goats with the
stones of the Dates beaten, and there with they grow fat, and yield store of
milk. Segelmesse was built (if any list to believe Bicri an African
Cosmographer his error.
Bicri, an African Cosmographer) by Alexander the Great. Here were certain
Colleges and Temples. The people of the Country lived on Dates. They have no
Fleas; a small privilege, for they have infinite store of Scorpions.

Fighig, has industrious and witty people, whereof some become Merchants,
others Students, and go to Fesse, where having obtained the degree of Doctors
they return into Numidia, and are made Priests and Preachers, and so become
rich. Tegorarin has traffic with the Negros. They water their corne-fields
with Well-water, and therefore are forced to lay on much soil. In which
respect they will let strangers have their houses rent-free, only the dung of
themselves and their beasts excepted. They will expostulate with that stranger,
which shall in some nicer humor go out of doors to that business, and ask
him, if he know not the place appointed thereunto. Here were many rich Jews,
which by means of a Preacher of Telensin, were spoiled, and most of them
slain, at the same time that Ferdinand chased them out of Spain. Techort is a
Numidian Town, exceeding courteous to strangers, whom they entertain at
free-cost, and marry their daughters to them rather, then to the natives.
Pescara is exceedingly insested with Scorpions, whose sting is present death,
wherefore the Inhabitants in Summer time forsake their City, and stay in their
countrey-possessions till November.

Libya extends it self from the confines of Eloachat unto the Atlantike,
betwixt the Numidians and Negros. It is one other of the seven parts, into
which we have divided Africa. The Arabians call it Sarra, that is, a Desert.

in the beginning of his fifth book, says, that all Africa by the Grecians
was called Libya. Taken in a more proper sense, it is diversely Strabo lib. 17.

description. The name Libya is derived from Libs, a Mauritanian King, as some

for their god, induced thereunto by his subtilty. For he had taught birds to
sing, Psaphon is a great god; which being set at liberty, chaunted this note in
the woods, and easily persuaded the wild people to this devotion. It was the
custom of women to howl in their Temples, Cael. Rhod.lib. 12. cap.2.
whence some of the Bacchanal rites were borrowed by the Grecians. Unto the
Libyans are reckoned those nations, whose barbarous rites are before related in
the seventh Chapter of this book. We will now come to later observations. G.
Bot. Ben. part.1.lib.3. Maginus.
Men may travel eight days or more in the Libyan deserts, ordinarily without
finding any water. The deserts are of diverse shapes, some covered with gravel,
others with sand, both without water: here and there is a lake, sometime a
shrubbe, or a little grasle. Their water is drawn out of deep pits, and is
brackish, and sometimes the sands cover those pits, and then the travelers
perish for thirst. The Merchants that travel to Tombuto, or other places this
way, carry water with them on Camels; and if water fail them, Leo. lib.1.
they kill their Camels, and drink water which they wring out of their guts.
Their Camels are of great ability to sustain thirst, sometimes traveling
without drink twelve days or more. Otherwise they were never able to travel
through those deserts.

In the desert of Azaoad there are two Sepulchers of stone, wherein certain
letters engraven testify, that two men were there buried; one a very rich
Merchant, who tormented with thirst, bought of the other, which was a carrier
or transporter of wares, a cup of water, for ten thousand ducats, and died
nevertheless; both buier and seller, with thirst.

Their lives for lewdness resemble the Numidians before mentioned, but for
length come much short of them, few attaining to sixty years. A. Cadamoste.
They are (as little need as they have thereof) often plagued with those clouds
of Grasshoppers, which cover the air, and destroy the earth.

The Libyan desert of Zanhaga beginning at the Western Occan, extends it
self far and wide between the Negros and the Numidians, to the Salt Pits of
Tegaza. From the Well of Azaoad, to the Well of Araoan, an hundred and fifty
miles space, is no water; for lack whereof, many both men and beasts there
perish. Likewise in the desert Gogdem, for nine days journey no drop of water
is found. In the desert of Targa is Manna found, which the Inhabitants gather
in little vessels, and carry to Agadez to sell. They mingle it with their
drink, and with their pottage: It is very wholesome. Tegaza is an inhabited
place, where are many veins of Salt, which resembles Marble, they dig it out
of pits, and sell it to Merchants of Tombuto, who bring them victuals. For they
are twenty days journey from any habitation, the cause that sometimes they all
die of famine. They are much molested with the South-east wind, which makes
many of them to lose their sight. Bardeoa was found out lately by one Hamar, a
guide unto a Carauan of Merchants, who lost his way by reason of a malady which
fell into his eyes; yet blind as he was he rode on a Camel; none else being
able to guide them: and at every miles end caused some sand to be given unto
him, whereon he smelled, and thereby at last told them of an inhabited place,
forty miles before he came at it: where, when they came, they were denied
water, and were forced by force to obtain it. The Rivers that arise out of
Atlas, and by the unkindness of their Kind, fall this way, finding these
thirsty wildernesses to yield them the readiest chanells, are trained along
by the allurements of the sands, stouping and crouching to them, till being
further from witnesses, they are either swallowed up of great lakes, or else
whiles they hold on their pursuit for the Ocean, lose themselves in the search,
and whiles they are liberal to the thirsty sands in the way, at last die
themselves (I cannot say, diue themselves, as elsewhere in the world) for
thirst in the deserts. And yet through these way-lesse ways, does
covetousness carry, both the Arabians in their roauings, and Merchants with
their Carauans to the Negros for wealth: whither, I think, at last you expect
the coming of this our Carauan also.

CHAP. XIIII.
Of the Land of NEGROS.

NIgritarum terra, or the Land of Negros, Maginus. Gi. Bot. Ben.
either is so called of the River Niger, or of the black color of the
Inhabitants: some think the River is named Niger of the people: It has on the
North those deserts which we last left; on the South, the Aethiopike Ocean, and
the Kingdom of Congo; on the East, Nilus; on the West, the Atlantike. Leo
makes Gaogo in the East, and Gualata in the West, the limits thereof. On the
side of the River Canaga it is sandy and desert, beyond, it is plentiful,
being watered with Niger, which runs through the midst of it. There are no
hills near the banks of Niger, but woody places diverse, receptacles of
Elephants. Raines do neither good nor harm: only Niger Ministers them plenty,
as Nilus in Egypt: Their increase is likewise alike; forty days together after
the midst of June does Niger increase, at which time the Negro towns are
Islands, and the way to them by boats; and as many it decreaseth. The Merchants
in July, August and September, trade in boats made of a hollowed tree (like the
Indian Canoas) lo. Leo lib. 7.
This River, some think, arises out of a desert called Se^, from a great
lake: some with less likelihood, think it an arm of Nilus: Cadamosto.
and some with no truth, think it to be derived from Paradise. It is by
Geographers Ortel. Ramusius, etc.
brought from a lake, which they call Niger, within two degrees of the
Equinoctial, and running thence Northwards, hides himself from the violence
of the Suns fury, under a mantle of earth, sixty miles together; and then the
Earth discovering him, he runs not far, but in revenge he couers a great
part of the Earth, and drowneth the same in a lake called Borneo, till the
Earth again with her strong arms claspes him in streiter banks, and forces
him to turn his stream Westward, in which way having gotten fresh help of
some other streams, that send in their succors; he again prevails, and
overthrows the Earth in the lake Guber: but shegetting up again, makes him
flee to the Ocean for aid, with whose tide-forces assisted, he rendes the
Earth in to many Islands, which he holds as captives between his watery
Ortelius and others in their Mappes, make Senaga and Gambra to be arms or
mouths of Niger. Sanutus thinks it to be Rio Grande, Leo alleges the
opinion of some which think it to come from Nilus by some vnder-earth passage.
The Truth is uncertain, the angry deserts not admitting due search.
Arms of Senaga, Gambra, and diverse others, which ever let slip their hold,
and hold them yet in everlasting captivity. In this combat whiles both parts
sweat in contention, a fatter excrement is left behind, which all this way
heartens the Earth with admirable fertility: especially then when the clouds
in the Summer time take Nigers part, and daily marshall their mighty showers
to the Rivers aid, shooting off continually in their march their airy
Ordinance, with dreadful lightnings, whereat the amazed Earth shrinkes in her
self, and the insulting waters for three months space trample over all, and
send colonies of fishes to inhabit the soil, engirting mean while all the
towns with a strait siege. But when the Sun, in his Autumn progress, sends
forth the winds to summon the clouds to attend on his fiery Chariot; The
Earth by degrees looks up with her dittie face, bemired with washing, and
makes use of the slime, which cannot run away with the fleeting waters, to
serve her all the year after, as harbenger of plenty and abundance.

Bichri and Meshudi, ancient African Writers, knew little of these parts: Leo
lib. 7.
but a Mahumetan Preacher in the 380. year of the Hegeira, made the people of
Luntuna, and Libya, of his faithless faith: and after that, they were
discovered. They lived, says Leo, like beasts, without King, Lord,
Commonwealth, or any government, scarce knowing to sow their grounds: cladde
in skins of beasts: not having any peculiar wife; but lie ten or twelve men
and women together, each man choosing which he best liked. War they wage with
no other Nation, nor are desirous to travel out of their country. Some
worship the Sun at the rising: Others, as the people of Gualata, the Fire:
and those of Gaoga are Christians, like the Egyptians: Joseph King of Marocco
subdued them: and after that the five peoples of Libya; of whom they learned
the Mahumetan Law, and other Arts, and the Merchants of Barbary frequented
those parts. The Libyans divided them into fifteen parts, each third part of
those five peoples possessing one.

But the Anno 1526.
present King of Tombuto, Ab^aci Izchia, being made General of the Forces of
Soni Heli the former King, which was a Libyan, after his death slew his sons,
and brought the Kingdom to the Negros, conquering many Provinces. After which
he went to Mecca on Pilgrimage, and thereby set himself in debt an hundred and
fifty thousand ducats. A great part of those parts by their difference of
language, and Religion, is yet unknown to us.

Gualata was subdued by the King of Tombuto, a beggarly Country. This Region
adioyneth to Cape Blanco. The Portugals, when they discovered these Coasts for
Henry the Infanta, traded here for slaves as is far as Canaga, or Senaga (to
which our Nation Rich. Raia^lds, Hack.
has since traded) and is an arm, as is said, of Niger. These people
inhabiting on this River, Aluise Cadamosto.
di Cadamosto, a Venetian, calls Azanaghi, and says, that when first the
Portugals sailed thither, their simplicity was such, having never before seen
a ship, they took the ships for great birds with white wings, out of some
strange place coming thither: but when they saw them strike sail, they
changed their opinion, and thought them to be fishes, seeing them a sarre off:
but when they saw them the next day so far off from that place, they took
them for night-goblins or spirits.

This did he learn of diverse of the Azanaghi, slaves in Portugal. They hid
their faces no less then the priuities, esteeming the mouth unmeet to be
seen, whence they belched such sour breath. They had a kind of muffler to
hide it, and part of the nose, only discovering the same at meat. Other
Governors they then had not, only more reverence was done to the most rich. A
beggarly, theeuish, lying, treacherous Nation, as any in the world. They annoint
their hair every day with fat of fish for great gallantry, whereof they
stink exceedingly. And lest you should think better of their eyes then of
their nose, their women esteem it the greatest part of goodly feature, to have
large breasts, which by Art and industrious stretching of them, they enlarge,
and some of them have them hanging to their Nauill.

Near unto those are certain Negros, which suffer not themselves to be seen
of any, nor to be heard speak: but have excellent gold which they exchange
with other Negros, which bring unto them Salt, such as the mineral salt of
Tagazza, and leaving the same, they go away from thence half a days journey:
the Negros come down in certain Barks, and lay at every heap of Salt a
quantity of gold, and go their ways. When the Salt-Merchants return, if they
like the sum, they take it; if not, they leave the gold still with the Salt,
and go their ways: and then the other return, and what heaps of Salt they
find without gold, they take for their own: the other, either they leave more
gold for, or else leave altogether. This seems hard to believe, but many of
the Arabians and Azanhagi testified it to our Author for truth. The Merchants
of Melli affirmed to me, that their Prince had once by a plot taken one of
them, thinking to have learned the condition of that people, but either of
sullenness, or because he could not, he neither eat nor spoke, and within
three days died. Their stature, they which had taken him, affirmed to be a
hand higher then themselves: and that their nether lip was thick and read,
and so great that it hung down to their breast, and it together with their
gummes bloody: their teeth great, and on each side one very large: their eyes
standing out: terrible they were to look upon. And because they had
apprehended this man by their ambushment, they returned not in three years:
but after forced by the need of Salt to cure their diseases (whence happily
that deformity proceeded) they renewed that traffic.

To leave these far within Land, and come to the Barrius dec.1. lib.3. cap.8.
and Maffaeus hist. Ind. lib.1. says that Senaga and Gambea were by the
Ancients called Sta^biris and D^ ratus. This name Senaga was given by reason
that the Prince was so called.
River Senaga, Cadamosto justly marvelled at the partition which that River
caused: for on the one side the Inhabitants were well proportioned, very
black, and the soil very fertile: on the other side, the Inhabitants meagre,
small, swart, and the ground barren. The people, that dwell on the banks of
Niger, are called Gilofi. The Kings name in my time (which was 1455.
almost a hundred and threescore years since) was Zuchali. He had thirty
wives. When Richard Hak. to.2.
Rainolds was there 1591, the Kings name was Amar Melik. All that Region
betwixt Sanaga and Gambea is called by one general name, Gia Lof: of which,
Maffeus Maff. l.1. Bar.Dec. 1.l.3. c.6,7,8.
and Barrius write, That in an accident of civil wars Bemoin came to the
King of Portugal for aid, and was there royally entertained and baptized with
his followers; of which, some were of such admirable dexterity and nimblenesse
of body, that they would leap upon a horse as he galloped, and would stand
upright in the saddle, when he ran fastest, and turn themselves about, and
suddenly sit down; and in the same race would take up stones laid in order on
the ground, and leap down and up at pleasure. This Bemoin was shamefully
murdered by Peter Vaz, the Portugal General, and the hope of Christianity
in those parts disappointed. This was Anno 1489.

From thence Al.Cadam.
Cadamosto went to Budomel; the Prince whereof was had in great respect by his
people: which when they come into his presence, kneel on both their knees, and
bowing their heads to the ground, cast sand over their shoulders, and on their
heads, with both hands, and then go toward him on their knees; and when they
speak to him, cast sand over their shoulders still, with their head bowed
down, the Prince scarcely deigning them a look, or word. For every light
offense he would sell their wives and children. He suffered our Author to go
into his Moschee, where his Arabian Chaplains, after their manner, mumbled
their Mattens ten or twelve times in half an hour; all the company rising
and falling again to the earth, and kissing it. He also heard him willingly
confute the Mahumetane, and prove the Christian Faith: but said, he thought it
was harder for a Christian to be saved then a Negro, because GOD was a just GOD
and LORD, who had given to us many good things in this world; to them nothing
in comparison, who should therefore in the other world have their Paradise,
which here they wanted. Easily might he have been turned to Christianity, but
for fear of loosing his State. His wives provide him his diet, as it is usual
among the Negros, and none but his Priests and some principal men eat with
him; which is after a beastly sort lying on the ground, the dish set in the
midst, and all taking out the meat with their hands. They eat little at
once, but eat often, four or five times a day. From October to June it raines
not there. They have great Serpents, and many, which they use to charm: and
the Prince when he would poison his weapons, did (as was reported) make a great
Circle, and enchaunted by his Charms all the Serpents thereabouts thereinto,
and then killed that which seemed to him most venomous, letting the rest go:
with the blood thereof, and the seed of a certain Tree, he tempered a poison
for that purpose, with which a weapon infected, drawing never so little blood,
did kill in a quarter of an hour. They have great store of Parrats, which are
instructed by a marvelous natural cunning to prevent the Serpents, which
would else destroy their neasts. They build therefore on high Trees, and on the
end of some tender bough thereof they fasten a Bull-rush, which hangs down two
spannes, thereunto weauing and working their neast in such sort, that the
Serpents, for fear of falling, dare not adventure to deal therewith. The
Negros came about Cadamosto, with wonder to see his apparel, and the
whiteness of his color (never before had they seen any Christian) and some
of them with spittle rubbed his skin, to see whither his whiteness were
natural, or no: which perceiving to be no tincture, they were out of measure
astonished. They would then give nine, or sometimes fourteen slaves, for a
horse furnished. And when they buy a horse, they will bring some of their
Enchaunters, which make a fire of herbs, and set the horse over the smoke,
uttering certain words; and after that anoint him with a thin ointment,
and shut him up twenty days, that none may see him, hanging certain
trumperie about his neck, thinking that hereby they are more secure in
battle. Gunnes seemed to them, for their hideous noise, to be of the Devil.
Bagge-pipes they thought to be a living creature, that thus sang in variable
accents. But when they were suffered to handle them, they thought them to be
some heavenly thing, that GOD had made with his own hands, to sound so
sweetly. They beheld the Ship with great curiosity; and Eyes that were
carved in the Prow of the Ship, they took to be eyes indeed, by which it
saw how to direct the course at Sea. They said, the Christians that could thus
make voyages by Sea, were great Enchaunters, and comparable to the Devil;
themselves had enough to do to travel by Land. Seeing a Candle burn in the
night, they which knew not to make any light but their fires, esteemed it
wonderful. Honey they have, which they suck out of the combs, but the Wax
they hurled away, till they were instructed how to make Candles thereof.

Senega ( Boterus says) comes from the Lakes Chelonidi. A hundred and fifty
Leagues from the mouth it has certain Falls, or Cataracts (as Nilus has)
that men may pass under the fall of the stream, without wetting.

Cadamosto doubled the Promontorie, called Cape Verde, or the green Cape,
because of the green Trees which the Portugalls (who had first discovered it
in the year before) found there growing in abundance; as Likewise Cape Sierra
Liona is so called of the Lionlike terror thereof, alwais covered on the top
with Clouds, which yield dreadful thunders and lightnings. It seems to be the
same that Ptolomey and Hann. call the Chariot of the Gods. G. ^ot. Ben.
Cape Blanco, or the White Cape, was so called of the White Sands there. The
inhabitants they found were of two sorts, Barbacini, and Sereri. They have no
Prince. They are great Idolaters, and have no Law: but are very cruel. They
poison their arrows; with which, and the situation of their Country, they
have preserved themselves from the Kings of Senega.

In Gambia they were, some Idolaters of diverse sorts, some Mahumetanes. They
were also great Enchaunters. Their living, as at Senega, save that they eat
Doggesflesh. Here the Prince hunted an Elephant, and gave them to eat: the
flesh is strong and unsavory. The Elephants delight in mire like Swine. They
hunt them in the Woods: for in the Plains an Elephant would, without running,
soon take and kill the swiftest man; whom yet they hurt not, except they be
first provoked.

Here was a kind of Fish ( Cadamosto Cadamosto apud Ramus. No^us. 47.
calls it Cavallo, and his Latin Interpreter, Piscis Caballinus; I take it for
the Hippopotamus, or Riuer-Horse) which is (says he) as big as a Cow; his
legs short, with tuskes like to a Bores, but so great, that I have seeue one
of two spannes, and longer, clouen-footed, and headed like a Horse: he lives on
both Elements, sometimes in the Water, otherwhiles on the Land. The women upon
their breasts, necks, and arms, had certain works, done with a Needles
point, heated in the fire, in manner as with us they work hand-kerchiefes.
This being done in their youth, would never out. The like flesh-branded works
they use at Cape Sagres, as Pietro Pietro di Sintra.
di Sintra, a Portugal, observed upon their bodies and faces. The inhabitants
there are Idolaters, and worship Images of Wood, to whom they offer some of
their meat and drink, when they go to their meals. They go naked, covering
their privy parts with the Barks of Trees. This is The Hollanders were
entertained of a King in Guinee, but very miserably: an old woman naked, three
times went about the Captain, with certain murmuring words, and cast ashes on
his clothes. The Nobles about the King were naked. Hol. Nauig. 1599.
in Guinea.

A little from thence they found men who used as great bravery in their ears,
which they bored full of holes, and ware therein rings of gold in rows or
ranks. They ware one great ring in an other hole bored through their nose, like
to buffles in Italy: which, when they eat their meat, they took away. The
men and women of sort wear such rings also in their lips, in like sort as in
their ears, an ensign of their Nobility and greatness, which they put in
and out at pleasure. Beyond the River of Palms they found others thus
beringed, and for greater gallantry ware about their necks certain chains of
teeth, seeming to be the teeth of men. They took a Negro whom they carried
into Portugal, who affirmed, if a woman which only could understand him, did
interpret him rightly, that in his Country were Unicorns. On this coast the
Portugals erected a Castle, called Mina, for their better trading. And these
Countries have since been sought to The Guineans esteem well of the French,
ill of the Flemish, and not well of the Portugalls. Arthus Hist.Ind.Or.c.9.

Thomas Windam and Antonie Ponteado, a Portugal, in two English ships traded
along those coasts, as far as Benin, where they presented themselves to the
King, who sat in a great Hall, the walls whereof were made of earth without
windows, the roof of thin boords, open in diverse places. His Nobles about
him never look him in the face, but sit cowring upon their buttocks, with
their elbowes upon their knees, and their hands before their faces, not looking
up till the King command them. And when they depart out of his presence, they
turn not their backs upon him. Such reverend regard does that Negro-King
receive of them.

The next year John Lock.
Master John Lock went for Captain into those parts, to trade for Gold,
Grains, and Elephants teeth. And after that, diverse Voyages were thither made
by William William Towerson.
Towerson, who observed at the River of S. Vincent strange Trees, with great
leaves like great Dockes, longer then that a man could reach the top of them;
and a kind of Pease by the Seaside growing on the Sands like Trees, with
stalks seven and twenty paces long. Diverse of the women had breasts
exceeding long. At the Cape Tres puntas they made him swear, By the Water of
the Sea, that he would not hurt them, before they would trade with him. King
Abaan, a Negro, entertained our men kindly; he caused a pot of Wine, of Palm,
or Coco, which they draw forth of Trees, as we have elsewhere observed; but
their ceremonies in drinking are thus: First, they bring forth their pot of
drink, and then make a hole in the ground, and put some of the drink into it,
and after that cast in the earth again, and thereon set their pot, and with a
little thing made of a Gourd, take out of the same drink, and put it upon the
ground in three places: and in diverse places they have certain bunches of the
pills of Palme-trees set in the ground before them, and there they put in some
drink, doing great reverence in all places to the same Palme-trees. All these
ceremonies done, the King took a Cup of Gold, in which they put Wine, and
whiles he drank, all the people cried Abaan, Abaan, with certain other words;
and then they gave drink to every one. The like ceremonies they use in all the
Country.

In Benin James Welsh.
the people go naked till they be married; and then are clothed from the waste
to the knees. Their Bread is a kind of Roots, called Inamia; which, when it is
well sodden, may be preferred before ours. They have here great Spouts of water
falling out of the Air, which if they light on a Ship, do endanger the
same. They fall like the Pillars of Churches. As for those Voyages to these
parts, made by Willid Rutter. George Fenner. Antonie Ingram.
Rutter, Fenner, Ingram, or others, I refer them to Master Hackluyts
Collections.

These Coasts are usually called Guinea, by a more general appellation,
although that be properly one Region only. About the Castle of Mina they are
subject to such Worms, as Master Ienkinson Ant. Ienkinson Hak. to. 1. These
worms come out of their legs, or some fleshie part.

the skin, with three lines drawn to their Navel, esteeming it necessary to
salvation. They will not easily do injury to any, especially a stranger. They
have Birds in such respect, that it is deadly to any that shall hurt them. And
some are appointed to have a peculiar care of them, and to provide them soode;

come and eat.

give religious respect also unto certain Trees. And in the year 1598
certain Hollanders cutting them, and not ceasing at the persuasion of the
Negros, whose Superstitions in that case they derided, it passed from words to
blows betwixt them, and the Dutchmen were forced to get them to their ships;
one of their company being slain in the chase. But the murderer was offered
to the Hollanders to be punished: which they refusing, his countrymen cut off
his head, and quartered his body, bestowing the one as a monument of revenge,
over the slain parties grave, the other on the Fowls, unburied. Their noses

prisoners. And in some more important wars which they undertake, they will
burn their dwellings before they go, least either the enemy might possess
them by conquest, or themselves become too mindful of a return. In these
wars they provide themselves of some light armor, wearing at such times no
other apparel. Some men, of greater sort, had a white confection, wherewith
they whited their faces and bodies. Their women are unfaithful Secretaries in
Natures most hidden secrets, using in the sight of men, women, boys, and
girls, to be delivered of their children, whom after they circumcise, whether
they be of the male or female sex. Their funeralis they celebrate with much
singing and solemnity. They believe, that men, when they die, go into another
world, where they shall have like need of many things, as here they have, and
therefore use to put with the dead corpse some part of household. And if they
loose any thing, they think, that some of their friends, which in the other
world had need thereof, came thence and stole it. Of The Religion of the

GOD being asked, they said he was black and evil, and did them much harm;
their goods they had by their own labor, and not by his goodness.
Circumcision they use, and some other Turkish Rites. They hold it unmeet and
irreligious to spit on the ground. They have no Letters, nor Books. They
observe a Sabbath, herein agreeing, and yet disagreeing, with Turk, Jew, and
Christian, for they observe Tuesdayes rest, from their Fishing and Husbandry.
The Wine (of the Palm Tree) which is that day gathered, may not be sold, but
is offered to the King, who bestows it on his Courtiers, to drink at night.
In the midst of the Marketplace (this was in the River Gabam, and the
Hollanders the reporters) they had a Table standing on four Pillars, two elnes
high, whose flat cover was made of Straw and Reeds wouen together. Hereon were
set many strawen Rings, called Fetissos, or Gods, and therein Wheat, with Water
and Oil, for their God, which they think eats the same. Their Priest they
call Fetissero, who every festival day places a Seat on that Table, and
sitting thereon, preaches to the people; which done, the women offer him their
infants, and he sprinkleth them with water, in which a Newt does swim, and
then besprinkleth the Table aforesaid with the same water, and so uttering
certain words very loud, he dismissed his devout assembly. Many wear such
Rings of Straw next their bodies, as preservatives from those dangers, which
else their angry God might inflict on them. In honor of the same Deity (or
Devil, as it seems they conceive him to be) they bechalke themselves with a
kind of chalkey earth, and this is unto them in stead of their morning Mattens.
The first bit at meals, and first draught, is consecrate to their Idol, and
therefore they besprinkle therewith those Rings, which I said they wear on
their bodies. If Fishers cannot speed at Sea, they give a piece of Gold to the
Fetissero, to reconcile their frowning Saint. He therefore, with his wives,
walks a kind of procession through the City, smiting his breast, and
clapping his hands with a mighty noise, till he come at the shore: And there
they cut down certain boughs from the Trees, and hang them on their necks,
and play on a Tymbrell. Then does the Fetissero turn to his wives, and
expostulates with them, and withal hurleth into the Sea Wheat and other things
as an offering to Fetisso, to appease his displeasure toward the Fishermen.
When the King will sacrifice to Fetisso, he commands the Fetissero to enquire
of a Tree, whereto he ascribes Divinity, what he will demand. He, with his
wives, comes to the Tree, and in a heap of ashes, there provided, pricks in a
branch plucked off the Tree, and drinking water out of a Basin, spouts it out
on the branch, and then daubeth his face with the ashes: which done, he
declares the Kings question, and the Devil out of the Tree makes answer. The
Nobles also adore certain Trees, and esteem them Oracles: and the Devil
sometimes appears unto them in the same in form of a black Dog, and
otherwhiles answers without any visible apparition. There are which worship a
certain Bird, which is spotted and painted (as it were) with Stars, and
resembles the lowing of a Bull in her voice. To hear this Bird lowing in
their journey, is a luckie boding, saying, Fetisso makes them good promises,
and therefore set him, in that place where they hear it, a Vessel of Water
and Wheat. And as the Earth and Air yield them Deities, so the Sea is not
behind in this liberality, but yields certain Fishes to their canonization.
In this respect they take not the Tunie at all, and the Sword-fish they take,
but eat not till his sword be cut off, which is dried, and holden in great
veneration. The Mountains would bend their sullen brows, if they should not
have some read letters in their Calendar, to which their tops aspire,
threatening to scale Heaven, or ouer-whelme the Earth, if this Fetissan portion
did not pacify their angry mood, by daily presents of meat and drink set
thereon. Neither can Nature alone usurp this Prauiledge, but Art, in other
things her e^ulous corriuall, and far unequal competitor, in this matter of
God-making, commonly gets the upper hand. And therefore they with their
ceremonious Art can make them Fetisso's, or Gods, at pleasure. Principally in
their Funerals they observe it: for when one is dead, they make a new Fetisso,
or Funeral rites.
Ring of Straw, and pray it to bear the dead party company, and protect him
in his journey into the other world. The friends and kinsfolks assembling,
prepare a Hen, and then setting themselves in a corner of the dead man's
house, they place all his Fetisso's on a row, the greatest in the midst,
adorning the same with garlands of Pease and Beans, like to the Popish
praying-Beades. Then they sprinkle the same with the blood of the Hen, and
hang a chain or garland of herbs about their necks. After this, the women
set the Hen, now sodden, in the midst of the Fetisso's, and the Fetissero
takes water in his mouth, which amiddest his Exorcismes and Charms he spouts
on those Fetisso's, and taking two or three herbs from his neck, he rolls
the same in form of a ball, which after certain ceremonies he lays down,
and so does, till all his Hearbe-garland be spent; and then makes them all into
one great Ball, and therewith besmeareth his face, and thus is it made a
Fetisso; and the party deceased is now at rest. In the mean time the dearest
of his wives fills all the house with mourning, the neighbors and friends
with Songs and Music (such as they have) and Daunces. And at last they take
up the Corpse, and carry it to the Grave, which is dug four foot deep, and
cover it with stakes, that nothing may fall therein. The women creeping about
the Sepulcher, expostulate with him, Why he would leave them? Then do they
hurl on earth, so that none can get into the Corpse; for he has with him his
Household, Armor, and whatsoever he used in his life time; Wine also (if
before he loved it) to drink in the other world. Lastly, they cover the
Sepulcher with a Roof, to defend all from rain. If the King dies, not only
greater solemnity is used: but the Nobles thinking it necessary for so great
a Personage to have attendants, they offer unto him one, a servant; another, a
wife; a third his son or daughter, till there be many of both sexes in that
other life to attend him. All which are suddenly slain at unawares, and their
bloody carcasses buried together with the King. Yea, the Kings wives, which
loved him best, refuse not this last and everlasting service, as they suppose;
but yield themselves to die, that they may live with him. The heads of all
these, thus slain, are set upon poles round about the Sepulcher: Meat, Drink,
Raiment, Arms, and other Vtensils are added for their use, and buried with
them. They, in uncertainty of criminal accusations, as of Adultery,
Murder, and such like, have a certain water offered them to drink by the
Fetissero, made of those herbs whereof their Ball- Fetisso is made, and in
effect like the cursed water, Number. 5. none daring to drink, for fear of
sudden death thereby, if he be guilty.

And now leaving the Coasts of Guinea, Benin, Melegete, and other Regions of
the Negros, adjoining to the Sea, we will look back again into the inland
Countries: whereof Gualata is a hundred miles distant from the Ocean, and has
already been mentioned. The next thereunto, in Leo.l.^.
Leos Relations, is Gheneoa, which is not the same with Guinea
beforementioned, if Leo had true intelligence, but is situate betwixt Gualata,
Tombuto, and Melli, and in one place bordereth on the Ocean, where Niger
falls into the Sea. They had great Traffic with the Merchants of Barbary.
They have Gold uncoined, and use also iron money. There is neither Town, nor
Castle, but one, where the Prince, with the Priests, Doctors, and Merchants
reside. Those Priests and Doctors go apparrelled in white, the rest in black
or blew Cotton. In July, August, and September, Niger ouerfloweth it. Izchia,
the King of Tombuto, conquered it, and kept the King prisoner at Gago, till his
death. Melli is the head City of a Kingdom, which hence takes name, and has
in it great store of Temples, Priests, and Readers or Professors, which read
in the Temples, because they have no Colleges. They are more ingenious then
other Negros, and were the first that embraced the Mahumetan Law. Izchia also
subdued them.

Tombuto was founded in the year of the Hegeira 610. And it is situate within
twelve miles of a branch of Niger. There are many Wells, to receive the
ouerflowing waters of Niger. Salt is brought them five hundred miles from
Tagazza, and is very dear. I, at my being there (says Leo) saw a Camels
burden sold for fourscore ducats. The King had many Plates and Scepters of
Gold, some whereof weighed thirteen hundred pounds. They which speak to him,
cast Sand over their heads, as Cadamosto observed at Budomel. The King would
admit no Jews into his City, and hates them so extremely, that he would
confiscate the goods of such Merchants as held traffic with them. He greatly
honored men of Learning, and no merchandise yielded more gain then Books.
There were many Judges, Doctors, and Priests, to whom he allowed their
stipends. The people used much dancing in the streets, from ten to one a
clock at night. They mingle Fish, Milk, Butter, and Flesh together in their
gallimausrey kind of diet, neither toothsome, nor wholesome. Hamet, King of
Marocco Pory.in translat. To C. History of Barbary.
, conquered the same Kingdom 1589, and also Gago, and other Countries of the
Negros, extending his Empire six months journey from Marocco, by Camels; whose
riches thereby acquired, appear in the letters of Lawrence Hak. to.2. Madoc.
Madoc, and we before have touched.

Gago is much frequented by Merchants, and things sold at excessive rates. In
an hundred miles space you shall scarce find one in those parts that can read,
or write: and the King accordingly oppresses them with taxations.

In Guber they sow their Corn on the waters which Niger, with his
ouerflowings, brings upon the Country, and have abundant recompense. Izchia,
King of Tombuto Leo, l.7.
, conquered the King of Guber; of Agadez also, and of Cano, which have great
store of Merchants: Likewise, of Casena, and Zegzeg, and Zanfara; in which I
find little worth the remembrance. Cano has some Relikes of Christianity,
and they are named by the Apostles names. Guangara was not only oppressed by
the said Izchia of Tombuto, but by Abraham King of Borno.

Borno confineth with Guangara on the West, and extends Eastwards five
hundred miles. The people have no Religion, neither Christian, Jewish, nor
Mahumetan; but like Beasts live with their wives and children in common: and as
a Merchant which lived long amongst them, and learned their Language, told Leo,
they have no proper Fuen our ancestors, the Saxon, had no surnames, but by
some accidents, as White, Long, Short, etc. And the Normans brought over their
customs of naming men by the place of their habitation; as the Town, Oak,
Style, or their Occupation. And in ancient Writings few proper names, but
their Christian, may be found. So the Roman Craessi, Nasones, etc.
names, as in other Nations, but as they give him some name of distinction by
his height, fatness, or other peculiar accidents. The King warreth with his
neighbors: he is descended of the Libyan people Bardoa. For maintenance of his
Wars he will give great prices for Horses, exchanging fifteen or twenty
slaves for one, which slaves he took from his enemies. When I was in this
Kingdom, I found there many Merchants that were weary of this traffic,
because they stayed for their slaves till the King returned from his Wars.
Yet the King seems to be rich: all his Horse-furniture, Stirrops, Spurs,
Bridles, Bitts, were of Gold; and his dishes, Platters, or whatsoever he did
eat or drink in: yea, his chains for his Dogs were for the most part of
most fine Gold. He has many, both white and black people, subject to him.

Gaoga bordereth Westward on Borno, and thence trendeth to Nubia, between the
Deserts of Setta on the North, and another Desert confining on a winding crook
of Nilus, about five hundred miles square. It has neither Civility, Letters,
nor Government. The inhabitants have no understanding, especially they which
dwell in the mountains, who go naked in the Summer time, their priuities
excepted. Their houses are made of boughs which easily take fire. They have
store of cattle. A hundredth years before Leo's time they were brought in
subjection by a Negro slave, who first slew his Master, and by help of his
goods made preyes in the next Regions, exchanging his captives for horses of
Egypt: and so became King of Gaoga. His Nephews Son Homara then reigned, and
was much respected by the Sultan of Cairo. Leo was at his Court, and found him
a man passing liberal. He much honored all that were of the lineage of Mahomet.

The Nubae in old times were many Kingdoms, as Strabo Strabo.l 17.
affirms, not subject to the Aethiopians: and were then Nomades, or
wanderers, and robbers. As it is now taken ( John Leo being our Author) Nubia
stretches from Gaoga unto Nilus, having the Egyptian confines on the North;
and the Deserts of Goran on the South. They cannot sail out of this Kingdom
into Egypt. For the River Nilus, whiles it is covetous of largeness, loses
his deepnesse, and covering certain plains, becomes so shallow that both
men and beasts may wade over. Dangala is their chief Town, and has ten
thousand Families, but ill built, their houses being chalk and straw. The
Inhabitants with their traffic to Cairo become rich.

There is in this Kingdom great store of Corn and Sugar, Ciuet, Sandall; and
I^orie. They have a strong poison, one grain whereof, given to ten persons,
will kill them all in a quarter of an hour, and one man, if he alone take it,
presently. An ounce hereof is sold for a hundred Ducats. It is not sold but to
strangers, which first take their oath that they will not use it in their
Country. And if any sell thereof secrety, it costs him his life: for the King
has as much for custom as the Merchant for price.

Some G. ^ot Bed.
Portugals traveling through Nubia saw many Churches ruined by the Arabians,
and some Images. The Jewish and Mahumetan superstition have there almost
prevailed. In old time they had Bishops sent them from Rome, which by means of
the Arabians was after hindered.

The Nubian King warreth with the Inhabitants of Goran, called Zingani; who
speak a language that none else understand; and with others in the deserts, on
the other side of Nilus, toward the Red Sea, whose language seems to be mixed
with the Chaldaean, and resembles the speech of Suachen, in the Country of
Prester John. They are called Bugiha, and live very miserably. They had once a
Town on the Red Sea, called Zibid, whose Port answers directly to that of
Zidem, which is forty miles from Mecca. This Zibid for their robberies was
destroyed by the Sultan. Ortel^^s Ortel. Theat.
says, that in Nubia they were sometimes Christian, and now are scarcely of
any religion at all. They sent into Prester John's Country for Priests, when

Now if any would look that we should here in our discourse of the Negro's
assign some cause of that their black color: I answer, that I cannot well
answer this question, as being in it selse difficult, and made more, by the
variety ^nc^^^de^. apud Strabode^^. lib.15.
of answers, that others give hereunto. Some allege the heat of this Torrid
Region, proceeding from the direct beams of the Sun; And why then should all
the West Indies which stretch from the one Tropike to the other, have no other
people? except a few in Quareca, which happily were not naturalls of the place.
And if this were the cause; why should Africa yield white people in Melinde,
and near the Line, black, at the Cape of Good hope in five and thirty? Some
leaving the hot impressions in the Air, attribute it to the dryness of the
earth: as though the Libyan Deserts are not more dry, (and yet the people no
Negro's) and as though Niger were here dried up. Some, to the hidden quality
of the soil; And why then are the Portugalls Children and Generations white,
or Mulatos at most, that is tawnie, in St. Thomez and other places amongst
them, and the Inhabitants of Melinde, Madagascar, and other places, in the same
height, in and adjoining to Africa? Some ascribe it (as Herodotus) to the
blackness of the Parents sperme or seed; And how made they the search to know
the color thereof, which if it has (a thing by others denied) by what reason
should it imprint this color on the skin? Some ascend above the Moon, to
call some heavenly constellation and influence into this consistory of Nature;
And there will I leave them: yea, I will send them further to him that has
reserved many secrets of nature to himself, and has willed us to content our
selves with things reueiled. As for secret things, both in Heaven and Earth,
they belong to the Lord our God, whose holy name be blessed for ever, for that
he has reueiled to us things most necessary, both for body and soul, in the
things of this life, and that which is to come. His in comprehensible unity,
which the Angels with covered faces in their Holy, holy, holy. hymns resound
and Laud in Trinity, has pleased in this variety to diuersifie his works,
all serving one humane nature, infinitely multiplied in persons, exceedingly

RELATIONS OF THE REGIONS AND RELIGIONS IN AFRICA. OF AeTHIOPIA, AND THE
AFRICAN ISLANDS; AND OF THEIR RELIGIONS.
THE SEVENTH BOOK.
CHAP. I.
Of Aethiopia Superior, and the Antiquities thereof.

OVT of Nubia we needed neither Palinurus help, nor Char^n, to set us on the
Ethiopian Territory: the Sea is far distant, and the River Nilus which
parts them, (whether loath to mix his fresh waters, with the Seas saltness,
or fearing to fall down those dreadful The falls of Nilus down from steep
Rocks.
Cataracts, or dreading the multitude of pits, which the Egyptians make in his
way to entrap him) here shows his unwillingness to pass further forward,
and distracted with these passions, has almost lost his channel, diffusing
himself in such lingering and heartlesse manner, as man and beast dare here
insult on his waters, and I also have adventured to take the advantage of these
shallowes, and wade over into this anciently renowned Aethiopia. The name
Aethiopia came from Aethiops, Aethiopia dicta a Coryneta, Aethiope Vulcani,
F.N. Com. l. 2.
the son of Vulcan: before, it had been called Aetheria, and after that
Atlantia. Lidyat.in emend. Temp.
Lydiat deriueth Aethiopia of Ai, and Thebets, the land of, or beyond Thebais,
which was called Aegyptus Superior, next to Aethiopia. Chytraeus says, it is
derived of (...) splendeo, and ^^^ visus; of the Suns burning presence. Two
Aethiopia's are found in Afrikes as Pl^ie Plim. l.5.c.8.
witnesses out of Homer (so ancient is the division) the Eastern and
Western. And this partition is by some still followed, as namely by Osor.de
rebut gest.Emanuelis.lib 4.
Osorius. Others divide the same into the Asiatike and African: Author here of
is Heredotus Herodot.l.7.
in his Polymnis, which reckons two sorts of Aethiopians in Xerxes huge
Army; the Eastern, mustered under the Indian Standards; the other, of Africa
by themselves, differing from the former in language, and their curled hair.
Eusebius Eusebius. Chron. in A. hl. 3580.
mentions Aethiopians near the River Indus. And to let pass Pausanias
Pausan. l.6.in fine.
his search among the Seres, or Philostratus Philostrat.l.3. devit. Ap.
at Ganges, for some Asian Aethiopians; the Scriptures seem to mention an
Aethiopia in Asia. For Cush, the Son of Cham, (of whom Josephus Joseph.
Antiq.I.c.6
says the Aethiopians called themselves, and were called by others, Chusaei)
was Author, not only of the Ethiopians in Africa, but of many peoples of Arabia
also in Asia, as Moses Genesis 10 Vide Annot. Tremel. and Iun.^
relates. And hence perhaps it was that Miriam Number.12.and Exodus.2.
and Aaron contended with Moses for his wife Zippora, because she was an
Ethiopian. And yet was she a Midianite: but called an Ethiopian, in respect of
the Neighborhood which Midian had to Aethiopia Orientalis, as F. Vatablus. in
Number. 12.
Vatablus observes out of the Jewish writers, or for that Midian is also
assigned to Ethiopia, taken in larger sense, as says Genebr. Chron. Page 71.
Genebrard. Iunius says, because the Midianites dwelt in that Region which was
assigned to Cush.

Saint Augustine Aug. de Mirabil.sac.Scripture.l.1.
affirms, that the Region Northwards from the red Sea, and so even to India
was called Aethiopia Orientalis. This distinction is still acknowledged by
later F Ribera.^^ in sophon.c.3. Lira n Postill. Calui^ in Comment. Number. 12.
Chiraeus in Onoviastico.
Writers. And therefore it is needless to fetch Moses a Wife out of Ethiopia
beneath Egypt, to interpret that place. For so Josephus Iosep.Ant.l.2
, as we shall after see, tells of a Wife which Moses in his prosperity,
before his flight, married from thence.

This observation is very necessary, because the Scriptures often mention
Ethiopia, when no part of Africa can be understood Gibbins. in Genesis 2.q.6. v.5.
, as Genes. 2. 13. where one of the Rivers of Paradise is said to compass the
whole land of Cush, or Ethiopia. And so in other places, Cush, or Aethiopia.
Learned Iunius Iun.in Gen.2 Praelectionib.
observes, that Cush is either a proper name as Genes. 10. or common to the
people that came of him: It is also a name attributed to the three Arabia's, to
the two (African) Ethiopia's, and to all the Southern tract by the Persian
Gulf.

Leaving now that Asian Ethiopia, which already we have handled under other
names, we will now proceed in our African journey, where we find in
Ptolomie Ptol.l.4.c.6.and 7.
not so exact description thereof, as in later Geographers, being then in the
greatest part unknown. Maginus Maginus.
makes Ethiopia to contain two of those seven parts, whereinto he divides
Africa: one of which he calls Aethiopia Superior, and Interior, which for the
most part is subject unto the Christian Prince, called in Europe Priest or
Prester John: the other, Inferior and Exterior, is all that Southerly part of
Africa, which was not known to the Ancients.

This does not altogether agree with Homers Hom.Odys. in initio.
division, (whose Geographi^ Strabo Strabo.l.1.Pertotum.
has so largely trauersed and admired.) For how could Homer, or any in his
time attain to the knowledge of those remote parts? Neither yet may we reject
that renowned Poet, seeing this partition may serve us now in the better
discovery of places, where we may reckon all that to the Westerly Ethiopia,
which from Guinea stretches to the Cape of Good hope: and thence to the Red
Sea Northwards, to the Easterly; Nilus, and a line from the head thereof unto
the aforesaid Cape, being the Arbiter in this division. But to let pass this
curiosity in caruing, when all is like to be eaten, we will begin at
Ethiopia under Egypt, and so take the Country in our way, going from the Red
Sea, till having doubled the Cape, we come from the Abassine Christians to
those of Congo on the Ethiopian Ocean. Aethiopia sub Aegypto, (so the
Geographers Ptol.l.4.c.7. Dom. Niger. Aphric.com.4.
call this part) has on the North, Egypt; on the West, Libya Interior; on the
South, Aethiopia Agisimba; on the East, the Red and Barbarian Seas, to the
Promontory Raeptum, which Ortelius Ortel. Thesau.
places about Quiloa, Porie Market.Tab.Vniuersalis. Porie before Leo.
calls it Quilimanci: Mercater Ortel. Theat. Moginus. Description of the World.
interpretes Magala. The Abissine Empire, is by our late Writers intended
further, receiving for the Southern limits, the mountains of the Moon; and
for the Western, the Kingdom of Congo, the River Niger, and Nubia: and
therefore contains Aethiopia sub Aegypt^, and besides Trogloditica,
Cinnamomifera Regio, and part of the inner Libya.

True it is, that the Great Neguz his titles comprehend thus much, yet rather
(say some) as a monument of what he has had, then an evidence of what he
has: The Turks in the North, the Moors on the West, and others otherwhere
circumcising this circumcised Abissine: and now according to G.Bo.Ben.Io.di
Barros.
Boterus and Barrius, the Lake Barcena is the center of his Dominion. But even
still Friar F.I.^ys. hist.or. de Etiopia.
Luys de Vrreta, gives him both all before named and more. The name Abissine or
Abassine, which is given to this Region, Niger D^^.Niger.
deriueth from the Egyptian word Abases, which ( Strabo Strabo.l.17.
reports) they gave to all inhabited places compassed with great Deserts, and
situate therein, in manner as the Islands in the Sea: three of which Abases, he
says, were subject to the Egyptians.

To take now some exacter view of these parts; leaving Vide Munster. in fine
6.lib.
those Jewish monstrous fables of Monsters of threescore and ten cubits, and
their great lies of the little PigmeyChristians, with such other stuff, fit
for them to write, who are justly credulous of 2.These.2.12.
lies because they believed not the Truth: let us see what others have written,
both of the people and place, and first of the first, and most ancient
Relations.

The Cataracts or falls of Nilus, which separate Aethiopia from Egypt, are by
the most Authors reckoned two, the greater and the less: Stephanus adds a
third at Bonchis, an Ethiopian City. These are Mountains which encroch upon
the River, and with their lostie loobes and undermining treachery, having
drawn up the earth, which should afford him a channel, into their swelling
and joint conspiracy, as with a mixed passion of fear and disdain, make the
waters in their have and strife overthrow themselves down those steep
passages: the billows bellowing and roaring so terribly with the fall, that
the inhabitants (as some This reporateth Cicero in So^ scip. and calls these
falls Catadupe.
affirm) which dwell near, are thereby made deaf: and the River amazed and
dizzie, whirles it self about, forgetting his tribute to Neptune, till forced
by his own following waters, he sets, or rather is set forward on his journey.

They are Iean. Bermudesius in Legate. Aethiopica.
now called Catadhi, which signifies Noise, of those dreadful and hideous
outcries which there are caused. Betwixt these falls and Meroe, Strabo
Strabo.l.17.
places the Troglodytae, of which we have already spoken: and the Blemmyes,
Nubae, and Megabari. They are Nomades, without Town or habitation, and
addicted to robbery. Procopius Procop.de Bello Persico.l.1
testifies, that these were accustomed to do much damage on the Roman
consines: and therefore Dioclesian brought them out of their barren
Territories, and gave them Elephantina, and the Region adjoining for
habitation, communicating to them the Roman rites and superstitions, and built
the City Philas, in hope of future friendship. Caelum non animum; they changed
the soil not the soul, but were no less injurious to Oasis, and other the
Roman subjects. They worshipped some Gods, borrowed of the Grecians; Isis, and
Os^is, of the Egyptians; and Priapus. The Blemmyes also offered humane
sacrifices, with cruel inhumanity, to the Sun, till Justinians time, who
took away those bloody devotions. As for the tale that those Blemmyes wanted
heads, and had their eyes and mouths in their breasts, the Authors had either
no eyes to see the truth, or more head then they should to devise lies: as we
may say of other shapelesse and monstrous shapes of people, which
Plin.l.5.c.8.and 6.c.29. Solinus, cap.39.
Pliny and Solinus, out of other Authors report, to inhabit these unknown
parts: some wanting lips, some nostrills, some tongues, or mouths, etc.
indeed all wanting truth. Rather would I counsel the studious of Geographie,
to learn the names of the Peoples and Nations of these Regions, of Pliny and
Solinus: which because we have but names of them, I forbear to name.

Meroe does inuit me to a longer entertainment, being an Island which Nilus
with lovely embraces claspeth about, according to Josephus and Cedrenus,
sometimes called Saba, as now also the Abissines name it; the Egyptians call it
Naule Babe; the inhabitants, Neube; our Maps, Guegere; to which Theuet adds

They cast their dead into the River, others reserved them at home in glass
shrines, others in earthen receptacles buried them near to their Temples. They
esteemed them for Gods, and swear by them. They ordained him King, who excelled
in strength, or in person, or in husbandry of cattle, or in wealth. Their
Priests enjoyed the chief rank of honor, who sending their Herald or
Messenger, enjoined the King his death, and set up an other in his room. At
length a certain King abolished this custom, and rushing with his armed
Soldiers into their Temple, where was a golden Chapel, slew all those
Priests. This was at Meroe the head City of the Island, where ( Pausanias
Pusanias.l.1
says) they showed the Table of the Sun, and that they were the iustest men
of all the Aethiopians.

Concerning that Table, and the expedition of Cambyses into these parts,
Herodotus Herod-Thalia. l.3.
relates: He affirms, that Cambyses designed at once three invasions;
against the Carthaginians, the Ammonians, and Macrobians (all in Africa.) These
last have their names of their long lives, which they draw forth far beyond
the usual course. He places them on the South shores of Africa, but Mela
Pomp.Mel. l.3.c.10.
in Meroe: Seneca, Pliny, and Solinus beyond. That Table of the Sun,
Herodotus and Mela, thus describe. Near to the City was a place always
furnished with variety of roasted meats, there set in the night by the
Magistrates, and eaten on the day by such as listed, and therefore of this open
feasting, called the Suns table: whom the ignorant people also thought to be
the Cater of these dainties. Cambyses sent an Embassage unto the King with
presents, but principally to epsy the Country: whom the Ethiopian requited
with a Bow, and bad that the Persians should then invade the Macrobians, when
they were able to shoot in such bows: thanking GOD that he was contented
with his own. And because he had sent him golden chains, he asked to what
use they were, they said, for ornaments; he answered with smiling, thinking
them to be chains for punishment, That he had stronger fetters then those.
The like account he made of his purple Robes, ointments, and wine: and asked
further what the Persians eat, and when they told him bread made of wheat,
(the nature whereof they declared) and withal, that the oldest Persians
exceeded not fourscore years; he said, that it was no marvel of their short
life, that fed upon dung: neither could they live so long, were it not for that
drink of wine which they used; It was not extraordinary Valor. Max.l.3.c.14.
there to attain to a hundred and twenty years, their meat was boiled flesh,
and their drink milk. He brought them to a Fountain, wherein being bathed
they smelled as of Violets, it was so subtle that nothing could swim thereon,
not wood, or other lighter matter: this water was supposed to lengthen their
lives. He brought them also to the Prisons, where they saw many manacled and
bound with chains of gold.

Lastly, he showed them their Sepulchers made of glass, in this manner. After
they have embalmed the dead corpse, they annoint it with a kind of pargetting
mortar, and then put it in a case or coffin of glass, through which it
shines, and is apparent without any ill savor. This they keep one year in
the house, offering thereto Sacrifices, and the first fruits of all things:
and then carry it out of the City. Thus far Herodotus.

Wherein, that which some penny-father would most admire, their golden fetters,
how common and rife is it in an other sort with us? every covetous miser,
manacling, fettering, strangling himself with his gold, in show his ornament,
in affect his God, in effect his Devil, Iaylour, chains, and hell. The
Macrobiy ( Mela adds) used brass for honor, gold for punishments.

Of the table of the Sun before mentioned, thus writes Friar Luys de Vrreta,
Luys de Vr.Hist. de la Etiopiae.l.prime.c.2.
in that his large history, which he has composed in Spanish, of Aethiopia:
that the King in a curious bravery and sumptuous vanity, caused there to be
set by night in a certain field store of white bread, and the choicest wines,
hanged also on the trees; great variety of Fowls, roast and boiled, and set on
the ground, Mutton, Lamb, Veale, Beef, with many other dainties ready dressed.
Travelers and hungry persons which came hither and found this abundance,
seeing no body which prepared, or which kept the same, ascribed it to Jupiter
Hospitalis his bounty and hospitality, showing himself a Protector of poor
travelers: and called this field the Table of the Sun. The report hereof
passed through the world, and brought many Pilgrims from far Countries, to
visit the same. King Cambyses sent his Ambassadors to see it: Plato, the Prince
of Philosophers having traveled through Asia as far as Caucasus, and gone
also to the Brachmanes, to see and hear Hiarchas in a Throne of gold, amongst
a few Disciples, disputing of Natures mysteries, and discoursing of the Stars
and Planets, and returned by the Persians, Babylonians, Arabians, and other
Nations, entered into Aethiopia, led with desire to see this renowned Table, and
to eat of those delicacies. The Aethiopians, since their Christianity in
zealous detestation of Idolatry, will not so much as name this field, and
these ancient rites, and give in charge to the Priests at this day, that they
handle not, or treat of the like vanities, because they were inventions of
Idolaters. Caelius Cael. Rhod.l.10.
Rhodiginus affirms, That this Table of the Sun grew into a proverb to
signify a house well furnished and provided. Thus far Friar Luys.

Of the Pillar of Semiramis is before spoken out of the relation of Xenophon de
Aequivocis: concerning which, and his other Companions, and Brethren, howsoever
Posseninus, Goropius, and others, do reprove Annius for abusing the world with
those glorious Titles Beros.Metasthencs. Cato, Mar.c^^^,etc.
and ancient names, and prove them to be counterfeit: yet, in my mind that of
Xenophon seems to savor of some true antiquity, and that more then others
of the same edition. In that pillar, consecrated to the memory of Ninus, the
inscription testifies, that Cush or Cuz was the Ethiopian Saturn; as Cham,
the Egyptian; and Nimrod, the Babylonian. When Cush was dead F.Luys l.x.c.3
, they say, Regma his son succeeded in the Ethiopian Kingdom, and after him
Dodan: after whose time is no record of certain succession. Diodorus says,
they chose him which was most comely of Personage for their King. Memnon is
chanted by Homer and the Poets, which lost his life at Troy in defense of
Priamus and was (some say) King of Aethiopia. Of the speaking image of Memnon,
ye have seen in our Egyptian relations. As for the wife of Moses. whereof
Josephus Ios.Ant.l.2. Zon.Annal.to.1.
says, that the Aethiopians having overrun, and almost subdued Egypt, and
none daring to make head against them, Moses (whom Thermutis, Pharaeohs
Daughter, had brought up) was chosen General of the Egyptian Army, which he
conducted into Aethiopia, and coming to the siege of Saba, Tharbis the
Ethiopian Kings, daughter fell in love with him, and sent her servants to
entreat of a marriage with him: which he accepted, upon condition of delivering
the Town unto him; and that being done, married her: all this seems rather
to be a Jewish fable, thinking hereby to credit their Lawgiver, then agreeing
to Moses, the Truth, and Scripture; and might happily arise from that speech,
that Moses Number.12.1.
his wife was an Ethiopian; of which we have spoken already. Neither is it
likely that Moses would accept of Treason for the dowry with his wife, sealed
with the blood and overthrow of her Country and Citizens. And yet from hence
do some derive the original of their Nation. After the father of this
supposed Tharbis, Derianus is said to reign, who valiantly withstood Bacchus
(which is thought to be Osiris, the Egyptian King, and after, their God) when
he invaded Egypt with an Army. Diodorus mentions Actisanes, a King of
Aethiopia. Cepheus also is numbered in that royal Catalogue: but of all, Ganges
Suidas.
was most famous, who with his Ethiopian Army passed into Asia, and conquered
all as far as the River Ganges, to which he left that name, being Plut.de
Flum.
before called Chliaros. He conquered as far also to the West, unto the
Atlantike Ocean, and gave name to the Country of Guinea; which name, some F.
Luys.
say, is corrupted of Gangina, the name it had received of Ganges. These things
are written by some, and I will not swear for the truth, as safely we may do
for that which the Scripture mentions of some of their Kings, in the days of
Asa and Hozekiab, Kings of Judah: whose puissance then was such, that 2. Chron.

blasphemous Sennacherib, in suit for the Monarchy of the world. Before that
time the Aethiopians had warred under Shishak King of Egypt, whom somem take
for Sesostris. The Babylonians in Nabuckodonosors time conquered Egypt and
Aethiopia, as Lauat.in Ez. 300 Est.8.
some expound the prophecy of Ezechiel. And the Persian Empire extended from
India to Aethiopia. Of the history of the Queen of Saba, we shall have more
cause to speak afterward. Some think P.Mart in ^. R.g.
that she came from Arabia where the Sabeans inhabit: Others Iosep. G^^ssa,
comestor, Iunis, etc.
bring her from hence, and say, that she was an Ethiopian. The mention of her
and of Candace (which name Pliny Plin.l.6.c.29.
says continued to the Ethiopian Queens in many successions) has made some
Mat Drisse.^atio Lipsie bauita.
think (as it seems) that Aethiopia was governed only by Queens. But let us
observe further concerning their rites and ancient customs, as diverse Authors
have related the same.

CHAP. II.
A continuation of the Ethiopian Antiquities, and of the Queen of Saba.

HELIODORVS in his History (which although for the substance it be fained, as
a loue-discourse, yet must hold resemblance with things done) and for the
variety and conceit thereof, commended by that learned Phil. Melanct. in
Epist.cd Operinum.
German Philip, and by our English Sr Ph.Sidney.
Philip (the soul of Poesy) mitated in his Arcadia, tells of Hydaspes his
Ethiopian King, that after his victory at Syene, and having there performed
his devotions, and seen their Niloscopium (like to that at Memphis, and now at
Cairo) and enquired the originalls of their feasts, and holy rites done in
honor of that River: when Heliod.histor. Aethiop.l.9 et 10
he came to the Cataracts, he sacrificed to Nilus, and the Gods of the Borders.
He then sent messengers to the Wise^^^en, whom he calls Gymnosophists, which
are the Kings Counselors, at Meroe, to certify them of his victory, and to
call a public assembly wherein to gratify the Gods for the same with
sacrifices and solemn pomps, in the field consecrated to the Sun, the Moon,
and Bacchus. Persina, the Queen, delivered those letters to the Gymnosophists,
who dwelt by themselves in a Grove, consecrated to Pan; and before they would
give answer, consulted with the Gods by prayer, and then Sisimures the chief
of them promised all should be fulfilled. The Sacrifices were to be done to
the Sun and Moon. and therefore, except Persina the Queen, which was Luna's
Priest, no woman for fear of contaminating the Holies of those Pure and Bright
Deities, might be present. Hydaspes was Priest of the Sun. Much preparation
was made of Beasts for their Hecatombe's, and much concourse of people crossing
the River in those boats of Canes or Reeds. There was presented the Images of
their Gods, Memnon, Perseus and Andromeda: and nigh to them sete the
Gymnosophistae. Three Altars were erected; two jointly to the Sun and Moon;
a third to Bacchus by himself, to him they offered all sorts of Beasts; to
Sol, white Chariot-horses; to the Moon, a yoke of Oxen. And when all things
were ready, the people with shouts demanded the sacrifice, which usually was
accustomed for the health of their Nation. That was, some of the strangers
taken in the wars, to be offered: First, trial Our English and the German
Histories mention the like clearing of adultery, by going with bare feet on
burning plowshare. Bale.
was made by spits of gold, heated with fire, brought out of the Temple,
whether the captives had ever known carnal copulation: for treading on the
same with their bare feet, such as were pure Virgins received no harm, others
were scorched. These were offered in sacrifice to Bacchus; the other, to those
purer Deities. These things have I here inserted, not as done, but as like to
such things, which among the Meroites used to be done, and agreeing with the
general devotions of those Ethiopians. Philostratus Philo^t.de^vta
Apaltonu.l.6.c.4.
reports like matters of their Gymnosophits and of the Grove where they kept
their general consultations: otherwise, each of them by themselves apart,
observing their studies and holies. They worshipped Nilus. intending in their
mystical interpretation the Earth and the Water. They entertained strangers in
the open air. Thespesion was then (in Apollonius his time) chief of their
society. At his command, an Elm did speak. They held the immortality of the
soul. The Aethiopians sacrificed to Memnon and to the Sun.

Lucian, after his scoffing manner gratulates the Aethiopians that favor,
which Jupiter vouchsafed them, in going on feasting, accompanied with the rest
of the Gods, and that twelve days together, if Homer Hom.Iliad.and Lucia^.de

reckoned truly. But more Idem de Astrologia.
seriously elsewhere he vnsoldeth that mystery, showing that the Aethiopians
were inuenters of Astrology, helped therein by the clearness of the sky in
that Region, and like temperature of the seasons. Of them the Egyptians
learned, and furthered that science. In his Treatise Idem de Sultatione.
of Dancing, he affirms, that the Aethiopians used their hair in steed of a
quiver, and never drew arrow from thence to shoot in battle, but with a
dancing iesture.

Diodorus D.Si^.l.4.c.1.
Siculus tells, that the Ethiopians were accounted most ancient of all other
men: and that not only Humanity, but Divinity, was borne and bred amongst
them: solemnities, pompes, holies, and religious rites, were their invention.
And therefore (says he) Homer brings in Jupiter, feasting with the Ethiopians.
The reward of their piety, was the immunitie of their region from foreign
conquests. Macrob.in S^mn.Scip. l.2. cap.10.
Macrobius interprereth Jupiters banquet with the Ethiopians of that Ocean,
which Antiquity imagined to be under all the Torrid Zone, that the fiery
bodies of the srarres, supposed to be nourished with moisture, might there
quench their thirst. So would those good men drown a great part of the African
and American world, in hospitality to the Stars, by their imagined
middle-earth Ocean: which experience has now sufficiently confuted.

Cambyses attempted and lost his Army; and Semiranits entered, but soon
returned: Hercules and Dionysisus ouer-ranne the rest of the World, the
Ethiopians either for their devotion they would not, or, for their strength,
could not conquer. The Egyptians, some say, were Colonies from hence; yea,
Egypt it self the dregs of that soil, which Nilus carries out of Ethiopia.

The Egyptians borrowed of the Ethiopians, to esteem their Kings as Gods, and
to have such care of their Funerals, the use of Statues, and their
Hieroglyphicali letters. Pierius Pier. Hieroglyphica.
, and others, have written thereof ^^ large. Their best men they chose for
their Priests: and he among them, who, when the God is carried about, shall
be possessed with some Bacchanal fury, is chosen King as by divine
appointment, and is of them worshipped as a God. His government is governed by
Laws. They do not put a Malefactor to death, but an Officer is sent to him
with the sign of death The like is used in Japan.
, whereupon he goes home and slays himself. One would have sled out of his
Country; but the mother of the malefactor killed him, because he would not
after his Country manner kill himself.

The Priests in Meroe exercised this authority (as it before said) over their
Kings, and would send them word that the Oracles of the Gods commanded them to
dye, neither might they reject the divine dispensation: and thus with
arguments, not with arms, they persuaded them to a voluntary death. But in
the time of Ptolemaeus Secundus, King of Egypt, King Ergamenes well skilled in
the Greek sciences, and Philosophy, rejected that superstition. They say,
that the custom yet (till Drodorus time) remains, that if the King be
maimed, or by some accident want any member, his Courtiers also will deprive
themselves of the same. Yea, when the King died, his friends thought it good
fellowship to die with him, esteeming that death glorious, and the surest
testimony of friendship.

The Ethiopians Diod.Sit.Strabo.l.17.
dwelling nearer to Arabia, armed their women in their wars, till they attained
to a certain age: the most of which ware a ring of brass in their lip. They
which dwelt further up into the Country, were diversely conceited of the Gods.
for some they think immortal, as the Sun, Moon, and the World: some
mortal, as Pan, Hercules, Jupiter, for their virtues exalted to that dignity.
Strabo tells it in the singular number, that they thought that God to be
immortal, which is the cause of all things. Their mortal God was uncertain,
and wanted name: but they most commonly esteemed their Kings, and Benefactors,
for Gods. Some that inhabit nearer the Line worshipped no Gods: and were much
offended with the Sun, and hiding themselves in the Fennes, cursed him when
he did rise. These things you may read gathered out of Diodorus, and Strabo,

that the Aethiopians were circumcised: as were also (besides the Jews,
Egyptians, and Arabians,) the Trogloditae, Macrones, Creophagi, and
inhabitants of Thermodoon. As we have showed of the Macrobij, or longliued
Aethiopians, so there were others called Brachobij, of their shorter lives,
whereof were reckoned two sorts: the Sidonij, near to the Red Sea, and the
Erembi, which some Raph. Volaterianus Geograph. l.12.

tells, that they and the Arabians could not endure myce: and that the
Persian Magi did likewise, esteeming them creatures odious to God. Alexander

ab Alexandro writes, concerning the education of their Children, that, the
Aethiopians feared their newborn Infants in the foreheads, to prevent the
distillations of Rheumes from the brain. And when they are somewhat grown,
they make trial of their forwardnes, by setting them on the backs of certain
Fowls, on which if they sit in their flying, without fear, they bring them up
very carefully: but if they shrink and quake with fear, they expose them as a
degenerate issue, unworthy education. Their Letters they wrote not side-waies,
after the Greek or Hebrew manner, but after the present Chinian custom,
downwards. They had seven Characters, every of which had four significations.
What manner of writing they now use appears in Dam a Goes. Zaga Zabo de fide

exploites, we have no continued History.

About the time of Christ, it appears, that Candace was Queen of
Aethiopia.Sho was a manly Virago, as Strabo testifies, who lived at the same
time, and followed Aelius Gallus in this expedition. He forced Candace to send
her Ambassadors to Augustus for peace, which she obtained. Sextus Sexti.

Victor mentions this Ethiopian Embassage. Dioclesian relinquished that part
of Aethiopia, which the Romans held beyond Egypt, as not able to bear the
charges. Justinian Procop. de Bello Persico.l.1.
sent his Ambassadors unto Hellisthaeus, the Ethiopian King, and to
Esimiphaeus King of the Homerites, his Arabian neighbor, to aid him against
the Persian. This Hellisthaeus had warred against the Homerites, for quarrel of
Religion, because they were many of them Jews, and others Gentiles, himself
being a Christian: and because they made many forrages into the Christian
Countries. He so far prevailed, as he made that Esimiphaeus, a Christian,
their King: whose yoke they shook off soon after: and Abram, a slave, usurped
the State. He had been servant to a Roman at Adulis, a City of Aethiopia,
worthy mention especially in this matter, for the ominous prosperity of
servants. For the City it self was built by fugitive servants, which ran
from their Egyptian Masters: and this Abram a servant there, obtained to be a
King: neither could the Ethiopian with all his might depose him. The like

embassage to Archetas king of Ethiopia was sent by Instinus for aid against
the Persian: both which I mention, to show the greatness at that time of his
state, nothing comparable notwithstanding to that which after besel them. Among
the Ethiopian Antiquities, Plato testifies, as Orosius Oros.lib.t.c.
cites him, that many plagues and uncouth diseases infested, and almost
altogether destroyed Ethiopia, about that time that Bacchus in uaded India. If
any delight himself in such Legendary draffe as the cou^terfet Abdias, Abdias

Enchantments, and some other ceremonies of Ethiopia, I am loath to blot my paper
with them: not because we are not certain of the truth (for in others we may be
deceived) but because we are certain of the errors, so gross that they may be
seen and felt. Marvel that Wolfg. Lazius.
Lazius, an historian, would with his Notes illustrate such a hotchpotch of
darkness. And yet our countryman Jewel and Harding.
Harding, leaving the clear waters of truth, has swallowed the same swill, as
the Jewel of our Church has taught him. The Eunuch of Candace was the first

do show.

But before we come to their christian conversion, we are first to declare
their conversion to Iudaisme (if it be true the Ethiopians write) in the time
of Solomon. The Ethiopians having lived before a vagrant life, like the Nemades
of old; and the Arabians, and other Libyan nations, not far from them in Asia
and Africa at this day; Arue the Ethiopian king first fixed a settled abode at
Axvms, and made it the royal city, Genebr. chron. page.118.
after whom followed Agab, and in the third place, Ghedur or Sabanut, which
subdued al Ethiopia, and left the kingdom to his daughter Makedae that reigned
80 years. An. 50 of her reign she visited Solomon. After her they reckon these
kings til Christ's time, Melic, Andedo, Auda, Gigasio, Zangua, Guasio, Antet,
Bahara, Canada, Chanze, Endur, Gnaza, Endrath, Chaales, Setija, Aglaba, Anscua,
Breguas, Guase, Beseclugna, Baazena, in whose time they say CHRIST was borne.
Genebrard setts down the times of their reign, which he confesses, and it
self conuineeth to be false. This Queen of Saba before mentioned, is by Ios.
Antiquit libr.8.ca.2.
Iosephius called Nicaule, the Queen (says he) of Ethiopia and Egypt. But Zaga
Zabo Zaga Zabo Episcopus Ethiop.
in the Ethiopian history which he writ, and caused to be done into latin by
Damianus a Goes, calls her Maqueda, whose history the Ethiopians have written
in a book as big as all Paul's Epistles. The sum of his report is this; She
was a worshipper of Idols, as her auncesters had bin, when as Fame filled her
ears with the renown of Salomons name: and then sent a messenger to Jerusalem,
to learn the truth, who at his return confirming those former reports, she went
her self to visit him. Of him, besides many other things, she learned the Law,
and the Prophets. By him she conceived also a son, of whom she was delivered in
her journey homewards, and named him Meilech. After 20. years education in
Ethiopia, she sent him to Solomon his father, to be instructed of him in
wisdom, desiring him to consecrate her son king of Ethiopia, before the Arc
of the Covenant; she ordained also that women should not henceforth inherit, as
before had bin accustomed. Solomon did this, and changed his name to David: and
after long instruction, sent him back to his mother, attended with many noble
companions, among whom was Azarias the son of Zadock the priest. This Azarias
caused tables to be made like to those in the Ark, and pretending to sacrifice
for the good succes of his iourny, went in and stole the tables of the Law,
leaving in their room these later counterfets, which he revealed not to any,
till he came to the borders of Ethiopia. Then David being made acquainted with
the fact, daunced for joy, as his grandfather David had done before the Arc
wherein the Tables were enclosed, his people making great joy. His mother
resigned to him the Empire, and from that time to this, the kingdom has
passed in a right line, from Candace was the name of diverse Ethiopian Queens,
contrary to this report.
male to male: circumcision also with the law of Moses has bin observed. The
Officers which Solomon appointed his son, are still continued in the same
families and order; nor may the Emperor choose the^ out of any other stock then
these of the Jews. This long Legend I report, not for the truth, but for that
religious conceit wherewith it is accepted in Ethiopia. For who knows not,
that none but the high Priest, and that but once a year, entered into that holy
place, where the Ark was, and Nadabs and Abihu's fire, with other divine
judgments; Vzzahs touching; and the Bethshemites viewing the Arc at so dear
a rate; could not but make dreadful so damnable an attempt. Besides, we should
have looked for our blessed Savior out of Ethiopia, where Salomons ^oires still
reign (if these say true) and not go to Salathiel and Zorobabel, descended of
another brother, and therefore further off from the throne of their father
David, on which Christ was to sit, and to which he was borne, next and apparent
heir, even according to the flesh. And yet does Genebrard credit these
reports, and Baronins also in part as Luys de Vrreta reports, This Luys has
written 3. large books in Spanish, collected (as he says) out of Don Iuan de
Baltasar an Ethiopian of great account, who had been Ambassador from his Mr.
Alexander 3. the great Negus, into Persia and other places, and came into
Spain with his license to imprint his Ethiopian history. Out of him Luys
reports that the former book, whence Zaga Zabo the Bishop, Ambassador to the
King of Portugal, had taken those things, is Apocripha: yet so, as that it is
true concerning that report of Maquedas conception, and the royal descent from
thence till these times. The stealing of the tables he denies; and affirms,
that the truth was, that Solomon had bestowed on the Queen of Saba a fragment
of the tables, which Moses brake in his zeal for the Israelits idolatry with
the golden Calfe. For that conception by Solomon, he proves it by, the
Ethiopian Records, the title of their King, and his arms; which are the same,
which the tribe of Judah gave, viz. a Lion rampant, crowned, in a field Or, with
this inscription, The Lion of the Tribe of Judah has overcome. Since they were
Christians they have added to these arms a cros^e, which the Lion holds in
his right foot. And in this right they lay challenge to Jerusalem for their
inheritance. Now for the fragment of the table which Moses brake, it is
received for a truth throughout Ethiopia, and it is still preserved in the hill
Amara, as the greatest Jewel in the world. Baltasar had often seen and
handled it. It seems to be of the Chalcedonie stone, shining, and
transparent, and is a corner of a square table, the broken edges yet being
manifest, with the letters, some broken, some whole, much differing from the
common Hebrew (which Genebrard says the Jews invented, thereby to differ from
the schismatic kingdom of the Israelites, of the ten tribes; the Samaritans
still retaining the former, as both he and Scaliger affirm.) But these letters

where the poole of Bethesda was made afterward, and by virtue thereof wrought

needs not the officious help of Romish Saints in this kind. As for that
succession of Jewish officers; Luys denies it, and says the Jews are no where
more hated the^ in Ethiopia: and Alexander the 3. late Emperor among them,
banished all Jews and Mores out of all his dominions. The officers of the
Emperor are the sons of the tributary kings his vassals, and the noblest of his
subjects. And for the Jews which came with Meilech, or Meilolec, (after called
David) his next successor Joshua (so he calls him) becoming an Apostata, reduced
idolatry: and whereas David his father had given them one of the Temples
dedicated to the Sun in Mount Amata, to make it an house of Prayer to the God
of Israel, casting forth the Idols therein; now in this Iosues days, some of
them returned to Jerusalem, or to other provinces of Africa, and some inhabited
the utmost parts of Africa, nere the Cape of Good Hope, and Deserts not before
inhabited And the said Don Iuan de Baltasar, being sent by the Emperor into the
lands of Monopopata (so he calls it) and of Galofes, of Barbizin, of Mandinga,
and of Zape, which are inhabited of idolatrous Gentiles, he found among them
some of these Jews descended of that exiled stock (as themselves also hold)
which had forgotten their Iudaisme, and all knowledge of the scriptures, only
had retained some relics of it, and abstinence from swines flesh, differing
also from those Gentiles, in worshipping one God, whereas the other acknowledge

Spiders, Snakes, Lizards, and whatsoever first meet them in the morning. These

call the Jews Tabayqueres, and will not admit them to purchase houses, or
inheritance, but either use them as interpreters or factors for Merchants
(which is the highest step they can attain to) or else employ them in base
drudgeries, to be their Porters, slaughter-men, and such like, that they seem
rather slaves to those barbarous Nations, then to enjoy any liberty of
freemen. Rightly may those Nations be called Barbarous, which seem rather to
bark then to speak, and yet they scorn that any should abase them, with the
basest of Titles in their opinion to call them Tabayquero, and revenge it with
the death of the wrong doer. In these reports, though there be many things
fall yet may some be probably true: let the Reader Judge.


CHAP. III.
Of Presbyter John: and of the Priest-Iohns in Asia: whether that descended of
these.

Having now declared the Antiquities of Aethiopia, drawn out of ancient
Authors, let us nearer hand behold, what nearer out times, Authors have
reported thereof. Wherein first we will here insert out of I. Scal de Emend.
Temp. l.7.
Scaligers Annotations, upon the Ethiopian Ecclefiasticall Calendar or
Computation of times, somewhat remarkable, and fitting to our present purpose.
The name (says he) of the Christian Aethiopians is not now first made known
to us. For their Church not only at Jerusalem and Constantinople, but at Rome
also and Venice, has had liberty a good while to use their own rites. The
Portugales, and Francis Aluares have further discovered them: Before we only
heard the name of Aethiopia. A wonder it is, that some ages since, Castaneda
seems al. o to hold that the N^gas is that Presbyter John of Asia; though not
of his race.l.1.c.1
their Emperors name was made known to us out of Asia, rather then out of
Aethiopia it self. Three hundred years ago, the Ethiopian Kings reigned in
Asia, especially in Drangiana, the borders of Susiana, India and China, until
the Tartars dispossessed them of the Asian Empire. For Cingis first, the first
Tartar King, slew Vncam, the Ethiopian Emperor: and his posterity chased the
Abissines out of Moin and China, and forced them to flee into Africa. Often
have I marvelled that a people of no knowledge in these times of sea affairs,
could atchieue so mighty exploits, as to propagate their Empire, from Aethiopia
to China. Since that time the knowledge of that Emperor has come to us in the
name of Prestegiano: which in the Persian tongue (as much now of reckoning in
Asia, as the Latin in the West) signifierh, So with us, the French King is
called Christianissmus; the Spaniard, Catholieus: the English, Defe^der of the

Hanariya, which in Ethiopian is as much to say, as, Apostle: which Marcus
Paulus falsely expounds, a Holy-man. (This name in the Author seems to be
given not to the Church, but to the Apostles himself) Paulus adds that the
remainder of the Christians subject to Prestegian abode in Tenduch. The
neighboring Arabians call them now Habassi, and we from thence Abissines, or
Abassenes: they call themselves Chaldaeans: for their ancient and elegant
language, in which their books are written, is near to the Chaldaean and
Assyrian. Moreover, the Eccesiasticall History testifies, and out of the same
Nicophorus l.9.c.18, that many Colonies were sent out of Assyria into
Aethiopia. They are there called Axumitae, of their chief city but by
themselves as Aluares affirms Chaschumo. More may we say hereafter of their
rites and other things worthy of knowledge, in the Institutions Scaligers

of that tongue which we have diligently, and methodically written. These words
of Scaliger have made me take some pains in the search of the premises; for
he differs from the opinion of others which have written any thing of
Presbyter, or Priest John (as they term him) in Asia, whom the Tartars
subdued. Ortelius Ortelli Theat. in the Map of Tartaria. P. Bertius and ddil
Geograph.
makes a Presbyter John in Asia, and an other in Africa, if I understand him.
As for that Vncam, William de Rubruquis, which traveled those parts in the
morning of the Targar-greatnes, An. 1523. reports that one Con Can reigned in
Kara-Catay, or black Catay, after whose death a certain Nestorian Shepherd
(a mighty Governor of the people called Yayman, which were
Nestorian-Christians) exalted himself to the Kingdom, and they called him
King John, reporting of him ten times more then was true, as is the Nestorians
wont. Willi.de Rubruquis ^tinerarium ap. Hak. to.1.Cap.19.
For notwithstanding all their great boasts of this man, when I traveled along
by his territories, there was none that knew any thing of him, but only a few
Nestorians. This John had a brother, a mighty shepherd called Vut, which
inhabited three weeks iourny beyond him: he was Lord of a Village called Cara
Carum, his subjects, called Crit or Merkies, were also Nestorians. But their
Lord abandoning Christianity, embraced Idols and retained with him Priests of
the said Idols. Ten or fifteen days journey beyond his pastures, were the
Pastures of Moal, a beggarly Nation, and near them the Tartars. John dying,
this Vut became his Heyte, and was called Vut Can (whom others call Vnc Can)
and his droues and stocks ranged unto the Pastures of Moal. About the same
time one Cyngis a Blacksmith in Moal, stole many of Vut This Vut or vncam was
called Prete or Priest as Boterus coniectureth, because he had the cross borne
before him he is said, with no great likelihood of truth, to have ruled 7^.
Kingdoms
Cans Cattle: who in revenge with his forces spoiled the Moals and Tartars.
They aggreeued, made Cyngis their Captain, who suddenly brake in upon Vut, and
chased him into Cataya; took his Daughter and married her, and had by her
Mangu, that was then the Great Can when our Author wrote this. These relations
savor not any such Monarchy as should extend from Aethiopia, to those parts of
Asia.

M. ^^ Paul.l.1.c.24.
Paulus tells that the Tartars were tributaries to this Vmcan (so he calls
him) which, says he, after some men's opinion signifies in our language Priest
John, but through his tyranny provoked to rebellion, they under the conduct of
Cingis, slew Vncam. And afterward he says that C.52. The Latin Copy wants
these things.
Tenduc was under the subjection of Priest John: but all the Priests John's that
there reigned after Umcan, were tributarie to the Great Can and in his time
reigned one George, who was a Priest and a christian, as were the inhabitants.
But he held not so much as the Sir Io'm Mandeuiles story of Presbyter John, is
fabulous.
Priests John's had done: and the great Cans did still join in affinity with
this family, marrying their daughters unto these Kings. This George was the
fourth after Priest John, and was holden a great Signior. He ruled over two
Nations, called by some Gog and Magog. by the inhabitants, Vng Happily the
Prince before mentioned was called Vncam of Vng, and Can: for Can signifies a
diumour or ruler.
and Mongul, where some were Mahumetans; some Heathens, other Christians. It
appears by their Histories, that Scaliger was deceived, to think that this
Priest John had so large an Empire, seeing Rubruquis in the same Age, or son
after M.P.l.3.c.37
could in his own country hear so little of him: and his posterity in M.
Paulus his time, continued tributarie Kings under the Tartar. The name Priest
was given them of that function, which he testifies, George received, and John
perhaps of that first Shepherd that usurped Con Cans estate. To let pass
therefore that Presbyter John in the Northeast, we slumble on an other midway
betwixt that and Aethiopia. For so Ioannes Josi^. de Pl. Carp. ^inerar um ca.5.
deplano Carpini (sent Ambassador to the great Can, from Pope Innocent. An.
1246.) and Vincentius Vincentij Beluacensis Spic. historiale l.32. c.10.
in his Speculum, tell of the King of India Major, called Presbyter John, being
invaded by the Tartars under the leading of Tossut Can, son of Cingis, who
before had subdued India Minor: He by a stratageme acquired his Realm of
them. For making men's images of Copper, he set each of them upon a saddle on
horseback, and put fire within them, placing a man with a pair of bellows on
the horseback behind every Image. And so with many images and horses in such
fort furnished, they marched against the Tartars: and when they were ready to
join, by kindling a fire in each Image, they made such a smoke that the
Indians wounded and slew many Tartars, who could not see to require them
through the smoke: but were forced to leave that country, and never after
returned. Here now we meet with a new Presbyter John in India Major, which
whether he were the same with the Ethiopian, let us a little examine. India is
by M. M.P.l.3.c.37
Paulus divided into three parts, the Lesser, Greater, and Middle; the first of
them he boundeth from Ciamba to Mursili, and says, it had in it eight
Kingdoms; the Middle called Abascia, had in it seven Kingdoms, three whereof
were Saraceus, therest Christians. Six of them were subject to the seventh. It
was told me, says he, that after their baptism with water, they used another
Baptism with fire, branding three marks on their forehead and both their
cheeks. The Saracens used one brand from the forehead to the middle of their
nose: They war with the Sultan of Aden, and with the inhabitants of Nubia,
and are reputed the best warriors in India. The greater Abdias nominat Indian
quae in Aethiopiam vergit. 1.8.
India extends from Malabar, to the Kingdom of Chesmacoran, and had in it
thirteen Kingdoms. This Abascia by the bordering enemies of Nubia and Aden is
apparent to be this Aethiopia where we now are: even by their brands we may
know them: And this the Ancients called India. For Sidonius Sidonius ap. Ortel.

calls the Ethiopian Memnones Indians: and Aeltanus Aelionus l.17. animalium.

10.l.8.
reckons the Sabeans and Ho^merites people of Arabia unto India. Sabellicus
Sabell. Aen. 10.lib.8.
complains of the confounding of these names India, and Ethiopia, saying,
that most men did think Ethiopia next to Egypt, to be that India, where
Alexander overthrew Porus. This confusion of names, I think, did first grow
from confusion of Nations. For as is before observed out of Eusebius, the
Ethiopians arose from the River Indus, and settled their habitation near to
Egypt. Perhaps they brought the Indian name also to these parts. Or else the
ignorance of those remote countries might do it: in which respect, not only a
third part of the old world, but another newfound world, is named India.
Therefore Acosta Ios. Acost. hist. Ind. l.1.c.14.
esteems India to be a general name to all countries which are far off, and
strange to us, although it be properly attributed to the East Indies. Now if
any wonder at such an extrauagant discourse of India here, let him know that in
our search for Presbyter John, which then was known to withstand the Tartarts
in Asia, I cannot see how he can be the Abissine or Ethiopian: but rather
think that when a mighty Christian Prince was found in Ethiopia, they did
imagine him to be that Presbyter John, of which they had heard in Asia; being
furthered in this error by the name, India, which, as is said, did generally
comprehend both the true India, and this, more truly called Ethiopia. Now for
that Presbyter John in India, I take him for some Christian King: for at that
time there were many Christians, as appears by Venetes, in manner dispersed
throughout Asia: and some, called S. Thomas Christians, remain in India to
this day. Why I think it not to agree to the Abissine, my reasons besides the
former are, the distance of place: all that huge tract of Arabia, with the wide
seas on each side, separating India from Ethiopia: the impassable Deserts by
land: No mention in history who should dispossess them of that India Mayor,
where the Tartar had never any great power: the Histories Of these Indian
Histories touching the same times See Linschoten l.1.ca.12. and 27. and G.B.B.
which we have of those Indian Princes, the Kings of Malabar, of Decamo, the
Samorin, etc. are against it: the difference of Religion; for those Indian
Christians of S. Thomas are not branded with hot irons, nor circumcised, not
agree in other rites with the Ethiopian: the Ethiopian History challenges no
such large extents to their Empire, except in Africa, where they seat them in
a continual descent, from the time of Solomon, till now, whereas those
Presbyter-Iohns had their dwelling and abode in Asia, as their Stories
signify. And further, the name Odoardo Lopez. l.2.vlt.
Priest- John is a name unknown in Ethiopia, and by ignorant mistaking of the
Europaeans, applied to that Ethiopian Emperor when first they heard of him, as
says Zaga Zaga Zabode 33. Fide Ethiopu^^^.
Zabo his Ambassador to the King of Portugal, who reproves the men of these
parts Luys de Vrreta Hist. Eiiop. L 1.c.7.
saying that he is named of them Belul, which signifies Excelcellent, or
precious, and in the Chaldaean tongue, Ioannes Encoe; which signifies the
same. Sabellieus says, the Ethiopians called him Gyan; Linschoten affirms,
Bell Gyan: ( Bell signifies the highest, and Gyan, Lord. But Friar Luys out of
Baltasar the Ethiopian, shows that in the hill Amara are ancient records,
which testify that from the time of that Queen that came to Solomon, the
Emperors have been called Beldigian, the signification whereof is, a precious
stone, or a thing of great value: which Title has continued to those
Emperors, as Pharao to the Egyptians, and Caesar to the Romans, Some also of
the Royal blood (which are usually kept, as after shall appear, in the hill
Amara) when they are elected to the Empire, if there be many of that Imperial
issue; take orders and become Priests, not procreating any Children. Such says
he in our times have been Daniel the second, Paphnutius, that succeeded to
Naum, and Alexander the third his succes^our, all which were both Priests and
Kings; and therefore by the Aethiopians which resort to the Holy Sepulcher at
Jerusalem, and used to speak Greek, were called Priest Beldigian. This by
corruption of the name by Merchants, and such as knew not the signification,
and also for breuities sake, was pronounced Priest Gian or John. Now for the
Priest John in Asia, he tells that when S. Thomas was martyred in India, the
three Mat. 2.l.
Magi, who had visited Christ by the leading of a Star in his Infancy, and
had after been consecrated Bishops over their several Kingdoms (you must not
deny their royalty) by the Apostle; chose one amongst themselves to be Priest
and King, who was called Priest John. If you believe not Peter de Natalibus,
out of whom the Friar cites this, I should be too much troubled in persuading
you. He tells also out of Otho Frisingensis, that about the year 1145. one
John a Christian, both King and Priest. Priest, reigning in the furthest parts
of the East, warred upon, and overcame the Medes, Assyrians. and Persians, and
had intended to free Jerusalem out of Saracenicall servitude, but not finding
passage over Tigris, was forced to return. This is like to he that Presbyter
John, whose posterity used that Stratageme before mentioned against the
Tartars. And to him I think might fitly agree that Title of Prestegian (easily
deflected and altered to Priest. John) whereof you have heard out of Joseph
Scaliger. I have seen a Manuscript Communicated to me, by that industrious and
learned Gentleman, Master Seldom, of the inner Temple.
in old French, pretended to be a Letter from Prester John, to the Emperor
Frederike, wherein is discoursed of the site, greatness, puissance, wealth, and
other rarities of his estate: but finding so many monsters, and uncouth
relations therein, I could not be so prodigal of faith or penurious of
judgment, as to value his authority at any high rate: wherein Sir John
Mandeuill seems to have been a lender or borrower, so justly do they agree,
in disagreeing from both probability and possibility of truth: yet both in
the one and the other, we may observe the like situation of Prester John's
dwelling in these parts of Asia, near Persia: and that such a multitude of
Fables could not but have some truth for their ground. My conclusion is, that
for that name of Prestegian, I like well Scaligers interpretation, and think
that it may agree either to this, or some other Christian Prince at those times
in India, which is far nearer to Persia, and from whence the Indians borrowed
their Royal titles, both in those times and since, as, Garciasab Herto Garc. ab
Hor. l.2.c 28. Linschoten l.1. c. 27.
and Linschoten show. Idalham or Adelham, the Title of the King of Goa is the
seat of the Portugal Vice^roy.
Goa, and the countries about, commonly called Idalcan, is not a proper name,
but a Title of honor, (signifying (as Adonizeack Josh. 10.1. ^^ ord) or King
of Justice: Nisamaluco, the spear of the Kingdom; and such like: Ismael the
Sophi (which name also is by some interpreted Elect, because they pretended to
be or do so, and others, the reprobate followers of a reprobate Religion)
added the Title of Xa or Sha, to such as embraced his new sect, as Nisomoxa,
etc. If the borrowing of names from the Persian language (so general in those
parts) be still observed: no marvel if some Christian King in those times
might Style himself Prestegian, or Apostolical, (which others not
understanding called Priest John, or Prete Iannt) as being compassed with so
many Saracens the enemies of the Apostles, besides Heretics, and Heathens. At
Mosul is yet a Patriarch, who in Paulus M. Paul.l.1.c.6.
time was of far greater jurisdiction, and as an Eastern Pope ordained
Archbishops and Bishops, through all the parts of India, besides Cairo, and
Baldach: and therefore no marvel if in India there were some Great Carishan
Prince, able to make head against the Tartars in those times: For even in
Cranganor G. Bot Ben. part 3.l.2.
are yet supposed to be 70000. Christians: besides a great number in
Negapatan, and in Matipur: and very many in Angamale, and 15000. on the North
of Cochin, where the Archbishop that depends on the Patriatch of Babylon, or
Mosul, resideth: All which have no communion with the Greek, Roman, or
Ethiopian Churches. And for the Ethiopian names or crosses, either their
Merchants when their state was great, or slaves, which taken from them are even
in these times sold dearest of any other, and mount to great preserments of
war, under these Lords, might leave such impressions: or, some other, which
as they professed One Christ, so might have some words and ceremonies common
with the Ethiopian: although I must needs acknowledge, that many of those
crosses have not crossed my way, nor any other Ethiopian foote-prints.

Pardon me gentle Reader, if I seem tedious in this dispute, seeing it is
necessary both for the understanding of the extent of the power and Religion of
this Precious or Priest John: and Scaliger having ascribed such large bounds to
his Empire, I could not but examine the same, otherwise professing my self (
sinon magts amtca veritas) even willing, if I must needs err, to err with
him, who has in many tongues, and Arts, showed himself perhaps the worthiest
General, and generallest Worthy, against Error that ever we have had, the
Alpha of learned men in our Age, as our learned D. Morton against Brerely.
Morton testifies of him, and a great light of learning, acknowledged by

testimony. His authority I would not seem to contemn, and therefore have
entered this long search: contented, if any like better to follow the opinion of
Sealiger in this, as I have done in many things else, that he take his choice.

was the cheese hinderance in this business: neither party being able (if
willing) to reconcile their long-receiued differences from each other, and the

says he had conference with some Aethiopians, which said that their Lord
ruled over threescore and two Kings. They called him Gyam, which signifies
mighty. They wondered why the Italians called him a Priest, seeing he never

make that their harvest of Abissine captives. Of this their fasting Aluares
says, that they begin their Lent ten days before us: and after Candlemasse,
fast three days, in remembrance of Niniuehs repentance; many Friars in that
space eating nothing: and some women refusing to suckle their children above
once a day. Their general fast is bread and water, for fish is not easily had,
being ignorant to take it. Some Friars eat no bread all Lent long for
devotion; some, not in a whole year, or in their whole life, but feed on
herbs, without oil or salt: that I speak not of their girdles of iron, and
other their hardships, which my Pen would willingly express, if my Method
forbade me not. This fasting (as exposing their State to hostile invasions and
insolences) may find place and mention here. Their Friars and Priests in
Lent eat but once in two days, and that in the night. Queen Lit. Helen. ad
and in. Reg. Portug.
Helena, that sent her Ambassador to King Emanuel, was reported to eat but
three times a week, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. On Sundays they fast not.
In Tigray and Tigremahon they fast neither Saturday nor Sunday: and they marry
(because they have two months privilege from fasting) on Thursday before our
Shrouetide. They that are rich, may there marry three wives, and the Justice
forbids them not; only Alvarez.
they are excommunicated from entering the Church.

In the kingdom of Angole, iron, and salt is current money. The Moors of
Dobas have a law, prohibiting marriage to any, that has not first slain
twelve Christians. The divorces Alvar.c.2^.
and marrying the wives of their brethren deceased, is here in use much like
as with the Jews.

In Bernagasso, Alvarez and his company, in their travel, were incountred with
many great Apes as big as Weathers, their fore-parts hairie like Lions, which
went not less then two or three hundred in a company: they would climb any
rocks: they dug the earth, that it seemed as it had been tilled.

In the Country of the Giannamori, Ca.50.
as they traveled, they crossed a certain brook or river, that came down
from the mountains, and finding a pleasant place, shaded with the Sallowes,
there they reposed themselves at noone: the water of the brook was not
sufficient to drive a Mill. And whiles the company stood, some on one side the
brook, some on the other, they heard a thunder, which seemed a far off, but
saw no likelihood of rain or wind; when the thunder was done, they put their
stuff in order to be gone, and had taken up the Tent, in which they dined,
when one of the company going by the brook about his business, suddenly cried
out, Look to your selves: whereupon turning about, they saw the water come
down a spears deapth with great fury, which carried away part of their stuff:
and had they not (by good hap) taken up their tent, they together with it had
bin carried away with the stream. Many of them were forced to clime up the
Sallowes. Such was the noise of the water, and the rattling of the stones, which
came tumbling down the mountains together, that the earth trembled, and the
Sky seemed to threaten a down fall. Suddenly it came, and suddenly it
passed. For the same day they passed over, and saw very many and great stones
joined to those which they had seen there before.

the river Nilus springs, it is there called Gion, and comes from two lakes,
which for their greatness may seem to be Seas, in which (report goes) that
Mermaides, Tritons, or Men-fishes are seen, and some have told me (says
Alvarez) that they have seen it. Peter Covilian a Portugal, which had lived a
great part of his life in those parts, told me, that he had been in that
kingdom by order from Queen Helena, to build there an Altar in a Church built
by her, where she was buried. Beyond that kingdom, I was told, there were
Jews.

are round, all of earth, flat roofed, covered with thatch, compassed with
yards. They sleep upon oxe-hides. They have neither Tables nor Table-clothes,
but have their meat served in on plain wooden platters. Some eat flesh raw;
others broyle it. Artillery they had not until they bought some of the Turks.
Writing is little (and scarce a little) used amongst them: the Officers
dispatch matters of Justice by Messengers, and word of mouth. There is no wine
made of the grape (but by stealth) except in the Pretes and Abuna is their
Patt-arch.
Abunas: others use wine made of Raisins, steeped ten days in water, and
sirained, which is cordial and strong. They have plenty and want of mettalles;
Gold, Silver, etc. the soil yields, but they have not Art to take it. They
have no coin of gold or silver; salt is the most current money. Sugar canes
they have, but want skill to use them. The mountains and woods are full of
basil and other odoriserous plants. They have store of bees and honey: but
their Hiues are placed in Chambers, where making a little hole in the wall the
bees go in and out. There are some places very cold. The Commons are miserably
oppressed by their superiors. No man may kill an Ox though it be his own,
without license from the Governors: there were no Shambles but at the Court.
The common people seldom speak truth, no not upon an oath, except they are
compelled to swear by the head of the king; they exceedingly sear
excommunication. Their oaths are in this fort: The party to be deposed goes
with two Priests, carrying with them fire and and incense to the Church-doore,
whereon he lays his hand. Then the Priest adiures him, saying; If thou shall
swear falsely, as the Lion deuoureth the beasts of the forest, so let the
Devil devour thy soul: and as corn is growned under the mil-stone, so let
him grind thy bones: and as the fire burns up the wood, so letthy sou'e
burn in hell: (the party answers to every to these clauses, Amen.) But if
thou speak truth, let thy life be prolonged with honor, and thy soul enter
into Paradise with the Blessed, Amen. Then does he give his testimony. They
have Books written in Parchment.

affirm that the Princes of Egypt have time out of mind paid to Prester John
a great tribute, (continued by the Turks, which Luys says is three hundred
thousand Zequis, every Zequibeing sixeteene ryalls, and with us eight pence)
for that by him the furious spirit of Nilus is stoked and cooled, being
detained in the way by many sluices, for that purpose made. The great Turk
denying this, Alfons. Albuquerque devised to divert Nilus into the red Sea.
the Abissine caused those dammes to be broken, and by drowning Egypt in
uncouth manner, forced that great Monarch to composition. Alvarez denies both
the mountains of Luna, and the melting of snow, which is supposed the cause of
this rivers hastiness; and ascribes the ouerflowing or Nilus to the extreme
raines in Ethiopia, whose Fountains diverse Portugalles have seen (he says)
in Goyame. The Turk notwithstanding has (by warring upon him) erected a new
B-glerbeg-ship in his Dominions. Alvarez lived there six years, and was once
within thirty miles of Nilus, but in all his trauells never saw that river.
So little access have the Ethiopians (barred out by impassable passages)
usually to the same.

Andrea Andrea Corsali liter^. at R.
Corsali r^porteth that the Prete David, was of Olive color, but showed his
face but once in the year, having at other times his face covered for greater
stare, and therefore also spoke to none, but by an interpreter. The Inhabitants
are branded with fire, which they use, not for Baptism, but in observation of
a Custom of Solomon, who so marked his slaves, as they affirm. Friar Luys
gives a more probable reason thereof, saying that when the world groned under
Arrianisme: the Abiss^^e Emperor caused his subjects to brand themselves with a
threefold mark or stamp in the forehead, to testisie their faith of and in
the Trinity: which now since their commerce with the Roman Christians is in
mannet wholly left, except in the ruder and more uncivil parts of Barnagasso,
the borders of the Empire. The same Author Luys de Vr^^^st de la Ethiopia libr.

says, that in Aethiopia are Elephants, the Rhinoceros, and (besides other
beasts) the Unicorn in the Kingdom of Goyame, and in the hills of the Moon,
but seldom seen, only the horn is found, which he casts in manner as the
Harr. There are also (he says) birds of Paradise: and such store and variety
of flowers ail the year long, that their Eunuchs are alwaie decked with them.
There is one Flower not anywhere else known, called Ghoyahula, much resembling
a Mary-gold, but exceeding fair in variety and excellency of colors,
fragrant smell, abundance of leaves in the Flower, and with a more rare
quality; beginning to open at noone, and so by little and little opening more
and more tiil midnight, always the sent increasing with the opening: after
midnight it shuts by little and little, till noone: denying by the same degrees
her pleasing offices to both senses, of sent, and sight. He mentions Page 344.

also a bird, called the Rhinocerot of the air, much bigger then an Eagle, and
having a bowe-fashioned bill or beak four foot long, and a horn between the
eyes, with a black line along it. It is a cruel soul, and attends on
battles and camps. The Portugalls had sight of one at the red Sea, when
Solomon the Eunuch had his navy in the red Sea. The horn is of the same
property with that of the Unicorn and Rhinoceros. There are fishes also
called Rhinocerotes of the Sea; many of which are paid the Prete for tribute.

CHAP. V.
Of the Hill Amara: and the rarities therein.

THe hill Amara has already been often mentioned, and nothing indeed in all
Ethiopia more deserves mention, whether we respect the natural site, or the
employment thereof. Somewhat is written thereof by Geographers, and Historians,
especially by Alvarez, F. Alvarez ^^ Cap.58.ad 62.
whom we have chiefly followed in the former relations of this Country, as
an ^^^witnesse of the most things reported; but neither they, nor he have any
thing but by relation, saving that he passed two days journey along by the
said hill, and that also had almost cost him his life. But John de Baltasar
lived in the same a long time, and therein served Alexander which was
afterward Emperor, and was often by commandment of the same man, when he
was Emperor, sent thither: out of his relations, Friar Luys de Vrreta de la
historia de la Ethiopia lib. mim. c. 8. and deiucept.
Luys says, he has borrowed that which here were offer you. And here we offer
you no small favor, to conduct you into, and about this place, where none may
come but an Ethiopian, and that by express license, under pain of leaving his
hands, feet, and eyes behind, in price for his curiosity; and not much less
is the danger of such as offer to escape from thence; Alvares himself being an
eie-witnes of some such cruel executions insticted for that offense. This hill
is situate as the nauil of that Ethiopian body, and center of their Empire,
under the Equinoctial line, where the sun may take his best view thereof, as
not encountering in all his long journey with the like Theater; wherein the
Graces and Muses are Actors (no place more graced with Natures store, or
furnished with such a storehouse of books) the Sun himself so in love with
the sight, that the first and last thing he vieweth in all those parts, is this
hill, and where Antiquity consecrated unto him a stately Temple: the Gods (if
ye believe Homer, Hom. ll. ^^^
that they feasted in Ethiopia) could not there, nor in the world find a fitter
place for entertainment, all of them contributing their best store (if I may
so speak) to the banquet, Bacchus, Juno, Venus, Pomona Ceres, and the rest,
with store of fruits, wholesome air, pleasant aspect and prospect; secured by
Mars, left any sinister accident should interrupt their delights, if his
garrisons of soldiers were needful, where Nature had so strongly fortified
before; only Neptune with his ruder Sea-Deities, and Pluto with his
blacke-Guard of barking Cerberus, and the rest of that dreadful train (whose
unwelcome presence would trouble all that are present) are al, save Charon, who
attends on every feast, yea has now ferried away those supposed Deities with
himself, perpetually exiled from this place. Once, Heaven and Earth, Nature
and Industry have all been corriualls to it, all presenting their best
presents, to make it of this so lovely presence, some taking this for the place
of our Forefathers Paradise. And yet, though thus admired of others, as a
Paradise, it is made a prison to some, on whom Nature had bestowed the greatest
freedom, if their freedom had not bin eclipsed Iam nacet esse Deum. Ou^.
with greatness, and (though goodly stars, yet by the Suns brightness, are
forced to hide their light, when gross and earthly bodies are seen) their
nobleness making them prisoners, that one Sun only may shine in that
Ethiopian throne. It is situate in a great Plain, largely extending it self
every way, without other bill in the same for the space of 30, leagues, the
form thereof round and circular, the height such, that it is a days work to
ascend from the soot to the top; round about, the rock is cut so smooth, and
even, without any unequal swellings, that it seems to him that stands
beneath, like a high wall, whereon the heaven is as it were propped: and at the
top it is ouer-hanged with rocks, jutting forth of the sides the space of a
mile, bearing out like mushromes, so that it is impossible to ascend it, or by
ramming with earth, battering with canon, scaling, or otherwise to win it. It
is above twenty leagues in circuit, compassed with a wall on the top, well
wrought, that neither man not beast in chase may fall down. The top is a
plain field, only toward the South is a rising hill, beautifying this plain,
as it were with a watchtower, not serving alone to the eye, but yielding also
a pleasant spring, which passes through all that Plain, paying his tributes
to every garden that will exact it, and making a lake, whence issues a river,
which having from these tops espied Nilus, never leaves seeking to find him,
whom he cannot leave both to seek and find, that by his direction and
conueiance he may, together with him, present himself before the Father and
great King of Waters, the Sea. The way up to it is cut out within the rock,
not with stairs, but ascending by little and little, that one may ride up with
ease; it has also holes cut to let in light, and at the foot of this ascending
place, a fair gate, with a Corpse du Guarde. Half way up is a fair and
spacious Hall cut out of the same rock, with three windows very large
upwards: the ascent is about the length of a lance and a half: and at the
top is a Gate with another guard. The air above is wholesome and delectable;
and they live there very long, and without sickness. There are no Cities on
the top, but palaces, standing by themselves, in number four and thirty,
spacious, sumptuous, and beautiful, where the Princes of the royal blood have
their abode with their families. The soldiers that guard the place dwell in
tents. There are two Temples, built before the reign of the Queen of Saba,
one in honor of the Sun, the other of the Moon, the most magnificent in all
Ethiopia, which by Candace, when she was converted to the Christan Faith, were
consecrated in the name of the Holy Ghost, and of the Cross. At that time,
(they tell) Candace ascending with the Eunuch (whose proper name was Indica) to
baptize all of the royal blood, which were there kept, Zachary the eldest of
them, was in his baptism named Philip, in remembrance of Philips converting
the Eunuch, which caused all the Emperors to be called by that name, til John
the Saint, who would be called John, because he was crowned on S. John's day:
and while they were busy in that holy work of baptising the Princes, a Dove
in fiery form came fleeing with beams of light, and lighted on the highest
Temple dedicated to the Sun, whereupon it was afterward consecrated to the
Holy Ghost by Saint Matthew the Apostle, when he preached in Ethiopia. Those
two Temples were after that given to the Monastical Knights of the Military
Order of Saint Anthony, by Philip the seventh, with two great and spacious
Couents built for them. I should loose both you and my self, if I should lead
you into their sweet, flourishing and fruitful gardens, whereof there are
store in this Plain, curiously made, and plentifully furnished with fruits
both of Europe plants there, as pears, pippins, and such like; and of their
own, as oranges, citrous, limons, and the rest; with cedars, palm trees, with
other trees, and variety of herbs, and flowers, to satisfy the sight, taste
and sent. But I would intertaine you, only with rarities, no where else to be
found; and such is the Cubayo tree, pleasant, beyond all comparison, in taste,
and whereunto for the virtue is imputed the health and long life of the
Inhabitants; and the balm tree, whereof there is great store here: and hence
it is thought Joseph. Ant. libr. 8.ca.2.
the Queen of Saba carried and gave to Solomon, who planted them in Iudaea,
from whence they were transplanted at Cayro long after. The plenty of grains
and corn there growing. the charms of birds, alluring the ears with their
warbling Notes, and fixing their eyes on their colors, jointly agreeing in
beauty, by their disagreeing variety, and other creatures that adorn this
Paradise, might make me glut you (as sweet meats usually do) with too much
store. Let us therefore take view of some other things worthy our admiration in
this admired hill.

The stately building of the two Churches aforesaid, with their Monasteries,
with the pillars and roofes of stone, richly and cunningly wrought, the matter
and the workmanship conspiring magnificence; that of Iaspar, Alabaster, Marble,
Prophyry; this with painting, gilding, and much curiostitie, with the two
Monasteries, containing each of them 1500, religious Knights and Monks: each
monastery has two Abbats; one of the military Knights, the other spiritual,
of the monks, inferior to the former. In the monastery of the Holy Cross are
two rare pieces, whereon Wonder may justly fasten both her eyes: the Treasury
and Library The Library of the P^^te.
of the Emperor, neither of which is thought to be matchable in the world.
That Library of Constantinople Zuta^^^. An. to 3
wherein were 120000 books nor the Alexandrian Library, wherein Gellius Gill
h.6.c.17
numbreth 700000, had the fire not bin admitted (too hasty a Student) to
consume them, yet had they come short, if report ouer-reach not, this whereof
we speak; their number is in a manner innumerable, their price inestimable. The
Queen of Saba (they say) procured Books hither from all parts, besides many
which Solomon gave her, and from that time to this, their Emperors have
succeeded in like care and diligence. There are three great Halls, each above
two hundred paces large, with Books of all Sciences, written in fine
parchment, with much curiosity of golden letters, and other works, and cost
in the writing, binding, and couers: some on the floor, some on shelues about
the sides: there are few of paper: which is but a new thing in Ethiopia. There
are the writings of Enoch copied out of the stones wherein they were engraven,
which entreat of Philosophy, of the Heavens and Elements Others go under the
name of Noe, the subject whereof is Cosmographie, Mathematikes ceremonies and
prayers: some of Abraham, which he composed when he dwelt the valley of Mamre,
and there read publicly Philosophy and the Mathematikes There is very much of
Solomon, a great number passing under his name: many ascribed to Job, which he
writ after the recovery of his prosperity: many of Esdras, the Prophets, and
high Priests. And besides the four canonical Gospels, many others ascribed to
Bartholomew, Thomas, Andrew, and many others: much of the Sibylles, in verse
and prose: the works of the Queen of Saba: the Greek Fathers, all that have
written, of which, many are not extant which us: the Writers Fr- Lays has a
very large catalogue of them l.1. c.9 taken out (as he says) of an Index,
which Anthary Gricus and L Cremones made of them, being sent thither by the
Pope Gregory 13. at the instance of Cardinal ^arl^, which saw and admired
the variety of them, as did many others then in their company.
of Syria, Egypt, Africa, and the Latin Fathers translated, with others
innumerable in the Greek, Hebrew, Arabike, Abissine, Egyptian, Syrian,
Chaldee, far more Authors, and more of them then we have; few in Latin; yet T.
Liui^s is there whole, which with us is imperfect; and some of the works of
Thomas Aquinas: Saint Augustines works are in Arabike: Poets, Philosophers,
Physicians, Rabbines, Talmudists, Cabalists, Hierogliphikes, and others would
be too tedious to relate. When Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus; when the
Saracens ouer-ranne the Christian world; many Books were conveyed out of the
Eastern parts into Ethiopia; when Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the Jews
out of Spain, many of them entered into Ethiopia, and for doing this without
license, enriched the Pretes Library with their books: when Charles 5.
restored Muleasses to his kingdom, the Prete hearing that there was at Tunis a
great Library, sent and bought more then 3000 books of diverse Arts. There are
above 200 Monks, whose office is to look to the Library, to keep them
clean and sound; each appointed to the Books of that language which he
understands: the Abbot has straight charge from the Emperor, to have care
thereof; he esteeming this Library more then his treasure. And yet his treasure
is such, The Treasury of the Prete.
as leauestall others of all Princes in the world behind, quite out of sight:
It is a Sea, that every year receives new rivers, never running out: the
Emperors, even from the time of the Queen of Saba, laying up part of their
revenue here. And therefore Literae David.
David the Prete, in Letters to King John the second of Portugal, said, that
he had gold as the sands of the Sea, and the Stars in the Sky. The first
that coined money, was Alexander the third, which died in the year of our Lord
1603, stamping in the one side, the figure of Saint Matthew the Ethiopian
Patron, and on the other, the Lion and Cross, which is the Arms of Ethiopia.
His Jewels, here kept, are incomparable; Topazes, Amethists, Saphires,
Diamonds, and others. He has one Jewel which was found in the river Niger,
(that brings forth more gemmes then any river in the world) which is one piece
of stone or rock diuersifed with a thousand varieties of stones: it is square,
about two palms and a half, and thick withal: there are in it a hundred and
sixty Diamonds, one as large as the palm of ones hand, others of one, two or
three fingers, and some less: it has above 300 Emeraldes, Rubies the greatest
in the world; above fifty Saphires, Turqueses, Balazes, Amethists, Ipinels,
Topazes, Iacinths, Crysolites, and all other kinds. Nature here playing the
leweller, and representing a Map of the worlds gemmes in one Jewel, without
and infinitely beyond all Art of man. Being set in the Sun, it seems a combined
marriage of heavenly and earthly Excellence, that no mortal eye has seeue the
like, not is able to endure the sight of this. When Bernardo Vecheti a Ieweller
was sent thither by Francis de Medices Duke of Florence, he accounted it beyond
all estimation or value. The Emperor keeps it in a box of gold. By the
persuasion of that Bernardo he has made him tables set with thousands of
stones in them. Corrall is more esteemed in Ethiopia then gold, and therefore
friar Luys denies that coralls in the bottom of the red sea, make it red, as
some affirm: and that which Barros Barros dec. 2 lib. 8.ca.1.
says has been found there, is imperfect.

But greater Jewels then those are kept in Amara, the princes of the blood
roial, which are sent to this hill at eight years old, and never return
thence, except they be chosen Emperors. The first Author of this custom was
Iosue the nephew of Solomon, and son of Meilet or Melilec, to remove all
occasions of civil wars about succession. And their continued succession in
one line, without alienation, is imputed to this. Some Emperors for a time had
left it, til Abraham being Emperor had, or pretended to have a revelation, to
renew that custom, if he would continue the Scepter in the lineage of David.
The Princes which live there, are six, eight, twelve, and sometimes more: Anno
1608 they were six; every of which lives by himself, and that in great estate
and majesty in royal palaces with spacious halls richly hanged, removing to
another palace at pleasure: they meet all together when they will play, hunt,
walk, and on holidayes to divine Service: they take place according to their
age; each has his ten servants for ordinary attendance, which are the sons, or
descended of the tributary kings: for baser Offices, the great Mr or military
Abbot employeth the soldiers that guard at the foot of the hill, which without
license may not ascend. They have other grave persons to instruct them in
virtue and learning. Every city, that is, every habitation of a thousand
houses, is at their own charge to send thither three men, a gentleman, a
citizen, and a plebeian, for the guard of the hill, which make up the number of
7500, there being 2500 cities in the Empire. The military Abbats order them in
their several wards, the baser at the foot of the hill, the citizens at the
middle, and the gentlemen at the top; their capitains changed at every two
months end. Besides the soldiers tents, are many other of Merchants and
Officers. No woman may ascend, nor has done since Queen Candace was here
baptized by her Eunuch: the the Princes live single, and marry nor, as Aluares
has untruly affirmed of them.

CHAP. VI.
Of the Election of the Emperors: of their Schools, Universities, and royal
Cities.

WHen the Emperor is dead, many solemn ceremonies are observed, both religious
and civil about the election of another, which is in the authority of the 2
military Abbots of S. Anthonies order in the mount. Oaths are taken both of the
Electors and Elected, the first, to use sincerity, the other to reign justly,
observing, and causing in his Empire to be observed, the laws of God, Christian
religion, the sour first Councels, of Nice, Ephesus, Chalcedon, and
Constautinople: and (if the F. Luys de vrret.hist.Ethiop.
Friar reach not, for in their holy Fathers case Irelie not much on their
holiness) to acknowledge the Florentine Counsel, and the Popes Supremacy, and
lastly, the Constitutions of John the Saint, and Philip the seventh, ancient
Emperors: which done, in solemn Procession of all estates they go to the
Church, and having set the Emperor in his throne, the Princes of the blood are
brought out of the Palace, where in the time of the election they had been
enclosed, to kiss his hand, and swear sidelity, clothed in the habit of the
Knights of Saint Anthony: the same oath is given also by the Kings, his
vassalls (four of which are present at the election) the Counselors,
Prelates, and others, according to their place. After this, fires are made on
the towers of the Mount, to give notice of this election, which being seen by
the nearer Cities, they also by the like fires (as it were) proclaim the same
in a moment through all the Empire: which is confirmed by Posts sent thence on
Dromedaries, by the Abbat of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost, one of the Electors,
and the Council, unto the City of Saba, and the mother of the New-Elect, if
she be living, and to his near kindred, to come and rejoice with him. The next
day the Emperor goes in black habit to the Palace where the Princes are,
and saluteth them with kind embracements, one by one, with his bonnet in his
hand: which is done in the next place by the Prelates, whom in honor of their
Ecclesiastical dignities the Princes resalute standing, with their heads
uncovered. The tributarie Kings follow, not with embracements, but kissing
their hands, rendering their salutations, and after them the Ambassadors. The
Emperor, having remained some time in private talk with them, goes to the
Abbey of the Holy Ghost, and putting off his black habit, is clothed in
Scarlet; and being on horseback, attended with his Family, the Abbats, and
Counselors, passes to the Abbey of the Holy Cross, where the two Abbats of
that Abbey meet him; and after oath given to preserve the ancient Customs,
present him with the Keys of the Treasury and Library: the Emperor
bestowing as much of the said Treasure as he pleases. After all other
ceremonies, the Counselors of the Court come to the Hill with twelve thousand
Knights of S. Antonies Order (which are the Emperors guard) and the eldest
sons of the King, to convey him solemnly to Zambra the City, where the Court
and Council reside, where with all solemnity and magnificence he is likewise
received, and conducted into the Palace, and placed on his Throne of twelve
steps, with acclamations of long life and happiness on all hands. Five days
festival being here passed in all public reioicings, he goes to Saba to take
the oaths of all his subject Kings in person (whereof only four had been
present at the Election) and one holding the Crown, another the Scutchion of
the Arms of that tributarie King, he swears on the Scepter (which is a
golden Cross) true sidelitie and obedience, and the Emperor puts on the
Crown again on his head: and the said Scutchion, with his Arms, he gives
into his hand, and licenseth him to depart to his Pauillion without the City.
These Kings are truly Kings, and succeed in the inheritance of their fathers,
receiving tribute of the subjects of their several Kingdoms, and are not
Deputies, or Vice-royes, at the mere pleasure of the Emperor: but if one be
upon just cause displaced, his son succeeds: and therefore the Prete is
called King of Kings. The eldest son of every of these Kings attend always
on the Emperor, and have attending on them ten servants of the sons of the
Nobles of their Kingdoms. The Emperor is bound by ancient custom to take a
wife of the posterity of those three Magi which adored CHRIST in his infancy,
whom the Ethiopian and Roman Traditions calls Kings, by the names of
Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar; of which, the Aethiopians say, that Melchior was
of Arabia, and Balthazar of Persia, which being forced by persecution of Arians
When were the Arians of such power in Arabia, but especially in Persia?
, came into Aethiopia, in the time of John the Saint, which reigned after
Philip the seventh, and received of his hands the Kingdoms of Fatigar and Soa,
the former given to the posterity of Balthazar, the other to the lineage of
Melchior. The F^^er adds, That all the legitimate descendents of these three
Families are borne with a star on one of their sides; and that at the
Iubilee, in the time of Gregory the thirteenth, 1575, there were three of
those three Families at Rome, with that natural ensign of the supernatural
and miraculous star. Yea, the legitimate Mahumetanes in Arabia and Persia,
remaining of those kindreds, have the same sign, as Don John swear to him,
that he had seen. The Council governs according to the 127 Statutes made by
the first Philips, and John the Saint. Nothing is punished with death but
Treason, under which name they also comprehend Murder and Adultery: of this
mortal sentence the Lions are the executioners, which in every City are kept
for that purpose. Some Italians had been found guilty of the sin against
Nature, a thing for which the Aethiopians (as some of the Ancients Ci^ ^^^
for Parricide) had no law, as not thinking any would so far degenerate; and
therefore knew not how to punish them: but it was committed to the Latin
Council, which adjudged them to be burned; a punishment not known before in
those parts, yet fitting to those unnatural burning The fault and the
punishment being of equal strangeness, the Emperor would not have it
executed there, but sent them to Goa to the Portugal Viceroy for that purpose.
Heresy and Apostasy are likewise punished with death. That Latin Council
was instituted by Alexander the third, for Causes and Persons of Europe to be
tried and judged by Judges of their own, resident at the Court (as the Grand
Council is) and chosen of each Nation two, of the Venetians, Florentines, and
Portugalls: the two former come thither by the way of Cayro. Andrew Oniedo a
Jesuit, sent thither by the Pope with the title of Bishop of Hierapolis, was
Author and Counselor to the Emperor of this Institution, and by him made
President of the same. This man ( G. Bot. part. 3. l.2. Mess.Hist.Ind.l.16.
^ma^.A.osta.
Botero, Maffaus, and others say) had miserable entertainment, with the residue
of his Society: but Friar Luys (from the relation of Don John) tells, That he
had lived and died in great honor amongst them, as he does elsewhere magnify
exceedingly their respect to the Roman Papacy and Religion. Credat Iudaus
Apella. Cui bono Cic. pro Milone.
is the rule of my Faith to Friars and Jesuits in their Relations: in Natural
and Moral Histories, which serve not to the building of Babylons Tower, I
receive them with attention, with thanks, and if need be, with admiration in
some things: but when they come with Slime instead of Mortar, and would get
Rome a name, I remember their Vows and Profession, and yield no further
attendance. That Claudius which was then Emperor, and his successor Adamas,
were of schismatic and tyrannical qualities, as other Historians affirm,
Friar Luys not only denies, but extolleth their good parts.

He which now is Emperor, was elected An. 1606, and called himself
Zaraschaureat, asprout or budde of the lineage of David, assister of S. Peter
and S. Paul. He is a man haughty and valorous, and was therefore chosen,
because the Turkish Empire was so full of seditions, and the Sophi had sent his
Ambassador to them, to choose a fit warrior, that they might with joint forces
assault the Ottoman.

There are in all the Cities of Aethiopia two Schools or Colleges for the
instruction of youth; one for the male sex, the other for the female: each
divided into three parts; the first, for the Gentlemen's children; the second,
for Citizens; the third, for the baser vulgar, with their several Instructers,
and without communion, meddling, or conuersing of the one with the other. The
Seminary of College of boys is a quarter of a league without the City, the
other within. There are they taught Letters and Religion. All, even the Kings
themselves, are bound to send their children thither to be instructed: and the
Priests resort theither for Confession, and ministering the Sacrament to them.
They may resort home at festival times: otherwise they are there detained; the
Virgins, from ten to twenty; the other, from ten to sixteen years of
their age. They have not only this order in their well-ordered Schools, but
in their disordered misorderly Stews, the Devils worke-houses, and suburbs of
Hell, which yet in Rome and places of that Religion are permitted and admitted
the Cities, and his Holiness self is not a little enriched with (that which
GOD prohibited) Deuteronomy. 23.18.
the price of the Dog, and of the Whore. The Aethiopians permit not any to be
strange women, but strangers of other Countries, which may not enter into their
Cities: Nor may the Nobles enter into the common houses which belong to the
Citizens, or these to those of the Plebeians, nor any but to those peculiarly
designed their state, under pain of death, as Adulterers, to be cast to the
Lions. These women are hired by certain Officers at a common price, and are
not to take any thing of particular men: They go in pale-coloured Garments,
and if they distaste and forsake that beastly Trade, they send them to some
places subject unto the Portugalls, not admitting them to converse with their
women, for fear of infection.

But to leave these Beasts, the Aethiopians give great respect to their
Physicians, which are only of their Gentry, and that not all that will, but
only such as certain Officers shall choose, of every City to be sent to their
general Universities (of which there are seven in Aethiopia) there to be
taught Natural Philosophy (Logic, and other Arts they know not) together
with Physic, and the Arts of the Apothecarie and Chirurgian. They are there
maintained at the public charge of the Cities that send them. When the Doctors
and Instructers see them sit to be Graduates, they go with them to the Monks
of Alleluya, and of Plurimanos, who with a Monks Cowle, of Hood, and other
Doctorall Ensigns, do inuest and inaugurate them in that Degree. They are
great Herbarists. They make Making of Mummie.
Mummia otherwise then in other parts, where it is either made of bodies buried
in the Sands, or taken out of ancient Sepulchers, where they had been laid,
being embaulmed with Spices. For they take a captive Moore, of the best
complexion, and after long dieting and medicining of him, cut off his head in
his sleep, and gashing his body full of wounds, put therein all the best
Spices, and then wrap him up in Hay, being before covered with a Scarecloth;
after which, they bury him in a moist place, covering the body with earth.
Five days being passed, they take him up again, and removing the Seare-cloth
and Hay, hang him up in the Sun, whereby the body resolves and droppeth a
substance like pure Baulme, which liquor is of great price. The fragrant sent
is such, while it hangs in the Sun, that it may be smelt (he says) a
league off. The privileges of Physicians are, that they are freed from the
common custom of giving one in three of their sons for the Emperors Wars,
that they may ride on Elephants in the Cities, which is allowed only to the
Emperors, Prelates, and Priests, that are Virgins: They may also wear
Miniuer-Hoods, and are free from Subsidies and Payments. Theology and the
Chaldee Tongue is taught only among their Priests and Ecclesiastical persons
in their Churches and Monasteries. They read Divinity in their native Tongue:
the Text is the four first general Councels: the Scripture they read in
Chaldee, which is with them as Latin with us. They handle not questions as the
Schoolmen, in Logical Disputations and Arguings, but copiously and eloquently
interpret the Scriptures.

Because we have mentioned their Cities Saba and Zambra, let us take some
briese view of them, and so leave this Spaniard, whose Discourse has (I hope,
not without some delight and profit) thus long holden you. Besides these two
Cities, none have above three thousand houses in them. But these are populous
and magnificent, with Towers, Temples, triumphant Arches, Obeliskes, Pyramides,
and the like tokens of Industry, Antiquity, and Majesty. Saba was founded by
that Queen which visited Solomon, and was the mother-Citie of the Empire. It
has five thousand houses, great and sumptuous, the streets spacious, with
Portalls, or Penthouses, that men may walk safe from the Suns violence. It
has four chief Gates, all of Alabaster and Jasper, wrought with
Antique-workes; the gate-dores of Cedar curiously carved. The ways that lead
to these Gates, for the space of two leagues, are set with Palms, Planes,
Oranges, Cedars, Cypresses, and other Trees on both sides, for shade and fruit:
the four high streets go through the City acrosse, and where they meet, is
an Arch or Vault erected on high Pillars, fairly wrought and gilded, with the
brazen Image of S. Matthew, their supposed Patron, as big as a Giant, gilded
also; the work of Architects sent by Francis, Duke of Florence. Near to this
City are Mines of Gold, Gardens, and other places of pleasure and profit.

Zambra is greater, containing thirty thousand houses, and innumerable
concourse of people. It stands in the Kingdom of Cafates, and high that great
Lake, which hereof is called Zambra: where the Emperor leaving his wonted
manner of removing up and down in Tents, has fixed his Court royal: and yet
without the City are many Tents that belong to the court. Here the Prete
lives, with two and forty sons of Kings, and with his Great Council, and
the Latin. Alexander the third built the Palace here 1570, with the Duke of
Florence his workmen.

CHAP. VII.
Of other Countries between the Red Sea and Benomotapa.

AEthiopia Exterior, or Inferior, is that Southerly Tract of Africa, which to
Ptolomey and the Ancients was unknown. It comprehends all that great wedge
of Land (such is the form) which beginning in the West, at the Countries above
Zaire, stretches to five and thirty degrees of Southerly latitude, and from
thence, Northwards, to the entrance or mouth of the Arabian Gulse; all this way
besieged and environed with the Ocean Bot.Ben.part.1.l.2. maginus. Pory before
Leo.
Maginus divides it into five parts, Aian, Zanguebar, Benomotapa, Cafraria,
and Congo: but Congo is here taken in a very large sense. Aian, after the
Arabians account, contains all that Region which lies between the mouth of
the Red Sea, and Quilimanci; being, for the most part, on the SeaCoast
inhabited by the said Arabians: but the inland parts thereof are peopled with
a black Heathenish Nation. It comprehends two Kingdoms, Adel, and Adea; the
former of which extends from that mouth of the Sea before mentioned, to the
Cape Guardafu, by Ptol.l.A.c.7.
Ptolomey called Aromata. South and West it bordereth upon the dominions of
Prete Ianns, about the Kingdom of Fatigar. The chief City is Arar. Zelia
also and Barbora pertain to this Kingdom, Cities without the Strait, on the
Sea, much frequented with Merchants. Zeila is situate in eleven degrees, where
Ptolomey places the Avalites. It is stored with variety of Merchandise, and
yields some representation of Antiquity in the buildings thereof, consisting
of Lime and Stone. The King is a Moore, and esteemed a Saint among the
superstitious Mahumetans, for his continual Wars with the Christian
Abassines, whence he transporteth innumerable slaves to the Arabians and
Turks, receiving in exchange Armor and other helps for his Wars. Anno 1541
Guad tameth the King having before done much harm, by the help of some
Portugalls which Claudius the Abassine had in his wars, was slain, and his
Army overthrown: but his successor, Anno 1559, slew Claudius in battle,
and the Moore acknowledging divine assistance in this victory, triumphed on an
Ass. Zeila was burnt and sacked by the Portugalls, Anno 1516: as Andrea Andrea
Corsali
Corsali, who was then present in the Action, testifies.

Adea is situate between Adel, Abassia, and the Sea. The inhabitants are
Moors, descended of the Arabians, who many hundred years ago, partly by
their rich Traffic, and especially by force of Arms, became Lords, not only
of A^an, but of all the Seacoast, to Cape dos corrientes, which is somewhat to
the South of the Southerly Tropicke. In all which space, before the Portugal
Discoueries, that part of the Cities which lay open to the Sea, was open and
unfortified, but toward the Land were walled, for fear of the inland people.
Adea pays tribute to the Abassian. In this Kingdom is Magadazzo, being it
self a petty Kingdom of the Moors, which are of an Olive color. Lud.
Roma^^^, l.7.
Brava was a free Town, which, with Pate and Gogia, were taken by the
Portugalls, under Tristan de Cugna.

Zanzibar, or Zanguebar, is a name by the Arabians and Persians given to that
Tract, extending from the River Qualimanci, which Ptolomey calls Raptus, to the
borders of Benomotapa. Some, in a larger extent, include Benomotapa and
Cafraria. Sanutus affirms, That it is a low, fennie, and wooddie Country,
with many Rivers, which by extremity of moisture cause the air to be
intemperate. From the waste upwards they go naked. Herein are contained the
Territories of Melinde, Mombaza, Quiloa, Mosambique, and others. Melinde ^o.di
Barros, Dec.1. l.4. c.6. ^^^ faith, At Melinde G^nma received kind
entertainment, and Pilots to convey hun to India, when it was first discovered
by the Portugalls.
is the name of a Kingdom, and of the chief City thereof: The inhabitants,
especially near to the Sea, are Moors, and build their houses after the
manner of Europe. The women are white, and the men, of color inclining to
white, notwithstanding the situation under the Line. They have black people
also, which are Heathens for the most part. Of like condition is Mombazaf

Non^ius, Acuna. Osor. dereb. Eman.
(which is said to have some resemblance with Rhodes) but enemy to the
Christians, and was ruinated by Thomas Cotigno, in the year 1589, for
receiving Alebech the Turk; as Ampazi in the same Coast, by Alfonso Mello the
year before.

Quiloa stands nine degrees to the South of the Line: the name of a City and
Island, which is a Kingdom of the Moors, and extends her dominion fair in
the Coastg. Ma^^. hist. indic. l 2. Arthus bist. ind. c.2.o.
The King grew mighty by the Trade of Sofala; but it was made tributarie to
Portugal by Vascus Gamma, Anna 1500. In the year 1505 the Portugalls for
deniali of that tribute, deprived Abrahem, the Arabian Ring, of his Scepter,
and built a Fort there; which the Moors soon after destroyed, together with
the new King, made by the Portugalls. The people are whitish, their women
comely, rich in attire: their houses fair built, and richly furnished.

Between Coava and Cuama, two Rivers which spring out of the same Lake with
Nilus, are the Kingdoms of Mombara, Mozimba, Macuas, Embcoe, and against them
the Promontorie Prassum. Here is Mosambique See Linschot l ^^ c.4. Paludanus
ibid.
, by which name is signified a Kingdom in the Continent, and an Island also,
with a safe Harbor, which with two other Islands are in the mouth of the River
Moghincats, in fifteen degrees South. Mosambique is inhabited by Portugalls,
which have there a strong Castle: here the Portugal ships Winter. In this
Island are Sheep, with tails of five and twenty pound weight (a Beast common
in Africa:) Hens black both in feathers, flesh, and bone, and sodden, look
like Ink, yet sweeter then other in taste: Porke very good, but for the decre
sauce. There are some Mahumetans, as they were all, before the Portugalls
arrival there. They have Trade in the Continent, in Sena, Macurva, Sofala,
Cuama, a people for the most part differing in speech and behavior, each
Village fighting with her neighbor, captiuing them: and some (as at Macurva)
eat them. Their chiefest ^^^^^ is by Hunting, and by flesh of Elephants. In
every Village is a new King. The Captain of Mosambique, in his three years
Government, makes thre^ hundred thousand ducats gain, especially by Gold,
from Sofala.

Up further wi^^nin Land the people go almost naked, and were so simple when
first the Portug^is traded ^^ ^ther L Romanus, l. g.
, that Ludonico Barthema, or Vertomannus, for his shirt; and another, for a
^^sor, and a little Bell; bought fifteen Cowes of them; and then were ^eadie
to fall together by the ears among themselves for the Bell, who should have
it. But they could not enjoy their purchase, being driven to their heels by
three female Elephants, which having young ones, were very fierce, and made
them leave their Ki^^ to save themselves. In these Seas the Moors sail in
Vessels fow^^^^^^ Lea^^r, the sails of Palm Tree leaves, calked with Gum,

S^^ ^^^ between Cuama and Magnice, two Rivers. Here the Portugals have on a
little ^^nd (whence the whole Kingdom has this name) a Fort and Factorie of
^^^ rich Trade, the people bringing great quantity of Gold (whereof they have
plentiful Mines) for their Cloth and other commodities: it is supposed that it
amounts to two millions yearly. Ortelius Ortel, Thesaur.
is of opinion, That this Cephala, or Sophala, is that which in Salomons time
^^eg 9.28. 2. chron.9.21.
was called Ophor, from whence so great quantity of Gold was brought by his
Navy. Josephus ^^^seph. Antiq.

Montanus. Philip Morn^y. Post^lls, Geropi^s, would by their authority much
move us to think with them, that Ophir is Peru, if the ignorance of the
Lodestone, and those huge Seas, esteemed by Antiquity vnnauigable, did not
detain us from consent: And where should Peru yield him Ivorie, where never
was yet seen an Elephant? Josephus ^Ios. Acosta, l.I.6.14.
Acosta takes Ophir and Tharsis to signify no certain places, but commonly
to be taken in a general sense, as the word India is now with us; a name given
to all remote Countries, East and West. He thinks, that Salomons Gold,
Ivorie, etc. came from the East Indies.

But some reasons do yield great cause of conjecture for Sofala, both because
of the plenty of the commodities which Salomons servants are said to bring
with them, and because of ancient buildings of Stone-worke, which the Io.di
Barros Dec.i.l.10.c.1.
inhabitants call, the work of Devils; supposing it impossible for men
(guessing of others by their own ignorance) to have built: Which also have
strange Letters, that the Moors (though learned) could not read: (And why
might they not be the old Hebrew Letters, which the Phoenicians of old, and
Samaritans to this day observe, as elsewhere we have showed?)

And further, Thomas Nauigationi di Thome Lopez ap. Ramusium.
Lopez tells, That certain Moors related unto them of the riches of those
Mines; that Ships from Mecca and Zidem used to trade there; and that yearly
there were taken forth of the Mines two millions of Mittigalls, every Mittigall
being a Duckat of Gold, and a third part: That the Wars in those Countries at
that time had ceased the Traffic: and that they had Books and ancient
Writings, which testified, That these were the Mines whence Solomon, in his
three years Voyages, fetched his Gold, and that the Queen of Saba was
natural of the parts of India.

As for India, ye have Cap. sup.
even now read, that it was a name given to many Nations, and among the rest,
to Aethiopia. And if a man consider the small skill which that Age of the world
had in marine affairs, still as much as might be holding their course within
fight of Land, he can scarce think, that long Nauigations could then be
performed. Barrius accounts all Sofala to the Empire of Benomotapa, of which
we shall speak anon: we have now mentioned the same, by reason of the Isle
which is subject to the Portugalls. These, beside Gold, here have great Trade
for Ivorie, of which Barrius says, That in Benomotapa are yearly slain four
or five thousands, and of Water-horses (whose teeth are accounted Ivorie also)
all the great Rivers in Africa are full. These feed sometimes on the Meadows,
where the Mariners have chased them, as Lopez Th. Lopez.
reports: and after long chasing by Land, they have taken the water; where,
in revenge, they have assaulted the Mariners in their Boats, and bitten
chippes of the same, being, by the thickness of their Hides, armed against
their Pikes, and have made them afraid, that they would ouer-whelme the Boat.

Within the Land, behind these parts, is the Kingdom of Monoemugi, which is
rich in Gold: their unfortunate wars with Monomotapa have made them known.
Nilus is their Western border, and Abassia on the North. They have little
read Balls made of a kind of Clay in Cambaya, and resembling Glass, which
they wear for ornament, and use for money. This King warreth with the
Benomotapa, and has terrible soldiers, called Giacqui, or Agab, or Ag^g, who
inhabit between the Lakes, whence Nilus and Zaire take their beginnings;
which live a wandering life, like the Nomades, in Cottages, which they make in
the Fields. They are of stature tall, and of countenance terrible, making lines
upon their cheeks with certain iron Instruments, and turning their eyelids
backward, eating their enemies.

These not long since (as Od. Lopez, I.2.C.5.
some say) invaded the Kingdom of Congo, and forced the King to keep in a
small Isle, where himself was taken with a Dropsy, and his people famished,
as after shall follow in due place. The Amazones of Monomotapa are every way
equal unto them in prowess. Little is known of the Religion of these
Heathenish Nations, nor of other Kingdoms, whereof we have little but the
names to relate, Goroua, Col^a, Anzuga, Moneulo, Baduis.

Now for those Moors which inhabited the Seacoasts, as we have said, they
are not all Io. di Barros, Dec.I.lib.8.c.4.
Catholic Mahumetans, especially such of them as have conuersed, and taken
their habitations further within Land. And the first Moors or Arabians that
came to inhabit those coasts, were banished persons, called as in the
Chronicles of Quiloa is reported, Emozaidin, of Zaide, the nephew of Hocem the
son of Hali, whose Doctrine they followed in some opinions, contrary to the
Alcoran, and therefore esteemed Heretics.

Long after them came three ships with great multitudes of Arabians, that
fled from the King of Laza their enemy, under the conduct of seven brethren,
which built Magadazzo, and after that, Braua; which, in manner of a
Commonwealth, was till the Portugals time governed by twelve Aldermen, or
chief Governors, that descended of the seven brethren.

These Moors and the former differing from each other in their superstitions,
could not agree, and therefore the Emozaidin were forced up higher into the
Country, and there by marriages mixed themselves with the Cafers (so the
Arabians call all Heathen people) and became Mungrels in a galli-maufrey of
devotions, whom therefore the Sea-cost-Moores called by a general name, Boter^.
Baduini: which in Arabia and Egypt, is the title of the people that live in
the Champaine, and Inland countries: and those that live near the Seacoast
are called Arabians, and c. They make no difference of meats. The Heathens in
those parts are given to Auguries and Witcher^es: and in their highest attempts
and greatest resolutions, yet will leave off, if any of these fantasies bode
unluckiness. The fruits, birds, beasts, and seeds, are in manner like to the
people, all wild. The air is unwholesome. But what vnhealthsomenesse can there
be found, where gold is found? which makes men commit themselves (no marvel
what they commit with others) to the most scorching heats, to contagious aires,
to tempestuous seas, and the darkest prisons of the disembowelled Earth.

CHAP. VIII.
Of Benomotapa, and the parts adjoining.

BEnomotapa, called also Benomotaxa, and Monomotapa, is a large Empire, so
entitled after the name of the Prince thereof (for Benomotapa is with them a
title, as Caesar or Emperor with us) extends after some men's reckoning
almost a thousand leagues in compass, between the great Lake, whence Nilus
springs on the North-east, Magnice and Toroa on the South, and the Seacoast
of Sofala on the East. It is between the sea and the fresh waters, accounted a
huge Island. Between Cuama and Corrientes it is pleasant, wholesome, and
fruitful: And from the Cape Corrientes to Magnice, it abounds with beasts; but
it is cold. Their principal Cities are Zimbas (happily the same which Ptolomey
Ptol. Geogr^ lib.4.cap.9.
calls Agisymba) and Benamataza; that one and twenty, this fifteen days
journey, from Sofala. Of the abundance of Elephants in Benomotapa is said
before; whereof Aethiopia is every where stored with manifold herdes: lo. di
Barros, Dec.I.l.10.c.1.
although I dare not subscribe to their opinion, that esteem Elephants as
common there, as here we have Oxen. It is a creature nine cubits high (in
their largest stature) and five cubits thick: with long and broad ears,
little eyes, short tails, and great bellies. Of their disposition is spoken
already.

The Mines nearest to Sofala, are those of Manica, which are in wide Champaines
compassed with mountains, ninety miles in circuit. The places where the gold
is, appear and are known by the dryness and barrenness of the soil, as if
Nature it self could not hord up gold in her spacious chests, but she must
needs prove bare and barren of her wonted good works; and how much less
unnatural and degenerate mankind? The Province is called Matuca, the people
Botonghi, which (although they are between the Line and the Tropike) yet in
Winter have such snowes in the mountains, that if any abide there, they die
frozen in them; and in Summertime the air in the tops of those hills is so
clear and pure, that some of our men, which were then there, saw the new
Moon, the same day that she had kissed her bright and bountiful brother.

And who can now charge the bright eye of the world, with the obscure
darkness of this Peoples hue, which so cold Winters, nor pure Summers, can
lessen or lighten? Yea even in the cold Countries near the Cape of Good-hope,
the Aethiopians have no hope or hap of better color; whereas the hotter
Countries of Libya, and in manner all America (notwithstanding the Suns
strait looking, and neerenesse, not allowing them a shadow to attend them in
the greatest height of his bounty) know not this black tincture in the
naturalls thereof.

But to return (and who will not return?) to the Mines: There are other Mines
in the Provinces of Boro and Quiticui, in which, and in the rivers, is found
gold not so pure. The people are careless and negligent to get, and the Moors
which traded with them, were feign to give their wares in trust, with promise
by such a time to pay them in gold, and the people would not fail in their
word.

Other Mines are in Toroa, wherein are those buildings which Barrius
attributes to some foreign As the Portugals have ^^ eir Castles Mina, Sofala,
etc. so some Prince, Master fometimes of those Mines.
Prince, and I, for the reasons before alleged, to Solomon. It is a square
fortress, of stone; the stones of marvelous greatness, without any sign of
mortar or other matter to ^oyne them. The wall five and twenty spannes thick,
the height not holding proportion. Over the gates are letters, which learned
Moors could neither read nor know what letters they were. There are other
buildings besides, of like fashion. The people call them the Court; for an
officer keeps it for the Benomotapa, and has charge of some of his women,
that are there kept. They esteem them beyond humane power to build, and
therefore account them the works of Devils; and the Moors which saw them,
said the Portugals Castles were no way to be compared to them. They are five
hundred and ten miles from Sofala, Westward, in one and twenty degrees of
South^ly Latitude: in all which space is not found one building ancient or
later; the people are rude, and dwell in cottages of timber.

All the people of this Region is of curled hair, and more ingenious then
those which are against Mosambique, Quiloa and Mclinde, among whom are many
that eat man's flesh, and let their kine blood to satisfy their thirst. These
seem prone to receive the Faith: for they believe in One GOD, whom they call
Moz^^o and have no Idols, not worship other thing: They punish nothing more
severely then Witchcraft, whereunto other Negros are exceedingly addicted; no
such person escapes death. The like detestation they conceive against Adultery
and Theft. Every one may have as many wives as they will: but the first is
principal, the other serve her; and her children are heirs. A woman is not
marriageable with them, till her Natural purgation testify for her ability
to Conception: and therefore they entertain the first flux thereof with a
great Feast.

In two things they are religious; in Observation of days, and Rites
concerning their dead. Of days, they observed the first day of the Moon, the
sixth, the seventh, the eleventh, the sixteenth, the seventeenth, the twentieth,
and the eight and twentieth, because in that day their King was borne. The
religion is in the first, sixth, and seventh, all the rest are repetitions,
above ten. When any is dead, after his body is eaten, his near kindred, or
his wife which has had most children by him, keep the bones, with some signs
whereby to know, whose they were: and every seventh day they observe Exequies
in the same place where they are kept: They spread many clothes, and set
thereon tables furnished with bread and sodden flesh, which they offer to the
dead with prayers and supplications. And the principal thing they request of
them, is, the good success of their Kings affairs. These prayers they make,
being clothed in white garments: after which, the good man and his family eat
their offerings. The Benomotapa must wear clothes of the same Country, for
fear of infection; others may wear foreign cloth. He is served on the knee,
and when he drinks or cougheth, all they which are about him make a shout,
that all the Town may know. None may cough in his presence: also, every one
must sit in token of reverence; to stand, is a sign of dignity, which he
affords the Portugals and Moors, and is the chief honor can be yielded any.
The second honor is to sit on a cloth in his house: the third, that a man may
have a door in his house, which is the dignity of great Lords. For meaner
persons, they need not fear to have any thing stolen out of their open houses,
seeling the severity of Justice does secure them. Doors are not for
necessity, but for honor. Their houses are of pyramidall or steeple form, all
the timbers meeting in the midst at the top: covered with earth and straw.
Some of them are made of timbers, as long and big as a great ships mast:
the greater they are, the more honorable.

The Benomotapa has music whither so ever he goes, with singers: and more
then five hundred iesters, which have their captain or master of Mis-rule. The
royal ensign is a little plow-share, with an iuory point, which he carries
always at his girdle; by which is signified peace, and husbanding of the
ground. He bears likewise one or two Porta vna ^^ due Zagaie. Bot^^^^ says,
vna Zapoa, ^^ due dardi: a mattocke and two darts.
swords in token of Justice, and defense of his people. The Country is free;
and gives him no other payments, but presents, when they come to speak with
him: and certain days service. No inferior comes before his superior
without some present, in token of obedience and courtesy. The Captains of
war with all theirs bestow seven days in thirty in his husbandry or other
business. He must confirm all sentences of Judgment in his own person:
there needs no prison, for matters are presently dispatched, according to the
allegations and testimonies that are brought. And if there be not sufficient
testimonies, then the matter is tried by oath, in this manner. They beat the
bark of a certain tree, and cast the powder thereof in water; Of such like
water, see the next Chapter.
which the party drinks, and if he do not vomit, he is cleared; if he
vomit, he is condemned. And if the accuser, when the accused party vomiteth
not, will drink of the same, and does not vomit, he is then acquitted, and the
matter dispatched. If any sue to him, he speedeth not, but by mediation of a
third person, which also sets down the sum that the King must have, sometime
at so dear rate, that the suter rather refuses the Kings grant. They have no
horse, and therefore war on foot: The spoils are generally shared amongst
all. When he marches, in the place where he is to lodge they make a new house
of wood, and therein must continual fire be kept, without ever going out;
saying, that in the ashes might be wrought some witcheries to the indamagement
of his person. And when they go to the wars, they never wash their hands nor
faces, till they have obtained victory. They have their wives with them, which
are so loved and respected, that if the Kings son meet with one of them in
the street, he gives her way. Benomotapa has more then a thousand women; but
the first is Principal, although she be inferior in blood, and her son
succeeds. And in seed-time and harvest, the Queen goes to the field and
ouer-seeth the stuff, esteeming it a great honor. Thus far out of Barrius.

Johannes Boterus Gi.Bot.B^^.pageI.
tells, That his chief warriors are women, namely, certain Amazones, which
fear off their left pappes, as Odoardo Od. Lopes Co^go hist.lib.^.cap.9.
Lopez reports, least they should hinder their shooting, after the manner of
the ancient Amazones: they are quick, bold, courageous, and constant in
battle, and most constant in inconstancy: for when they make show of flight,
they will return (espying their advantage) with the greatest fury. They dwell
in certain countries by themselves, and at certain times have men to
accompany with them for generation, to whom they send their males; reserving
all the female children which they have. Thus we find Amazons, which the
Ancients reported in Asia, and Diodorus Libya, now in these times, if this
report be true, in Aethiopia: and Huldericus Shmidel historia Nautgat. in
Am.cap.37.
Shmidel has told of the like in America.

In the year 1560. Consalvus Eman. Acosta Rerum in orient gest. Comment.
Silueria, with two other Jesuits, went from Goa to the Kingdoms of Inhamban,
and Monomotapa: and coming to Inhamban, they went to Tongue, the City royal,
where they baptized the King and all his people in a short space, naming the
King, Constantine, the Queen, Mary. Thence went Consalvus to Monomotapa, and
so prevailed with his Images, Preaching, and Contempt of the world, that he
wanne the King and his mother, with multitudes of others to Baptism. But soon
after the King, by suggestion of the Moors, slew him. Schastian in revenge
raised an army of sixteen hundred, R^ter^ part.2. lib.3.
most of them being Gentlemen, which he sent under the conduct of Francis
Barretto. The Benomotapa fearing the Portugals forces, offered reasonable
conditions, which Barretto refusing, was discomfited, not by the Negro, but by
the air; the malignitie whereof (the sour sauce of all these golden Countries
in Africa) consumed his people. There are other Kingdoms adjoining to
Monomotapa, and the mountains of the Moon, Matana, Melemba, Quinbebe,
Berteca, Bauagul, of which I can give you but the names.

Caphraria, or the Land of the Caphars is next to be considered, which Maginus
boundeth between Rio di spirito sancto, and Cape Negro, extending to the Cape
of good hope Southwards. Why he should call this part the Caphars, I know not:
for the Arabians, of whom this word is borrowed, give that name to all the
Heathen people in Africa: yea both the Arabians, and all of their religion,
call all such as receive not that superstition, Caphars, even Christians also,
as Master Ienkinson A. Ienkinson in Hakl. tom.^. page 327.
long since told us. And for the Heathens in Africa, Barrius affirms, that it
is by the Moors given to them all: signifying, Without Law, or lawless
people. Zanguebar is in this respect called Cafraria. It should seem it is
appropriated to these the Southerliest Nations of Africa; for want of other the
more true proper names which were unknown. With the names of the Capes, and
other places of note, Master Pory Pory before ^.c^.
has already acquainted his English Reader: Only that notable and famous Cape
of good hope (so named Osor. de reb. ^m. lib.I. This was An. 1487. The
discovery thereof is lagely related by Io.di Barros in his first Decade of Asia
lib.3.
by John the second, King of Portugal, for that hope which he conceived of a
way to the Indies, when it was first discovered) deserves some mention. It
has three head-lands, the Westermost whereof bears name of Good hope, the
middlemost, Cabo fals^, because they have sometimes, in their return from the
Indies, mistaken this for the former: between which two Capes runs into the
Sea a mighty River, called by the Portugals, Rio dul^e, which springs out of
a Lake called Gale, situate among the mountains of the Moon, so much
celebrated by the ancient Geographers: The third and Eastermost, is that of
Agulhas or Needles, about five and twenty leagues from the first: both which
seem as two horns, wherewith it threatens the Ocean, which in these parts is
found oftentimes 'Bartholom^^ Dias, who first discovered this Cape, called it
Ca. Tormeut^s, in regard of the troubles and dangers he there sustained.

testisieth of his own experience. True it is, that sometimes it is passed
with more ease; but not so usually: and Lins^hoten tells, that at his return
from India, the Saint Thomas, a new Carrick, was here cast away, They found it
there in April as cold as with us in Winter, when it freezeth not: and yet the
people are black.
and their ship, wherein he sailed, in such danger, that one while they
prayed, another while murmured, another time would return back, and the
Captain professed no small marvel why our LORD suffered such good Catholics
to endure such torments, and the English Heretics, and blasphemers to pass so
easily. The waves there (says he) strike against a ship, as if they stroke
against a hill, that if it were of stone it would at last be broken. Here
Captain Sir James Lancaster. Hakl.tom.2. part.2.
Lancaster traded with the people, and for two knives bought an ox, for one, a
sheep, etc. in good quantity. Their sheep are great, with great tails, but
hairy, not woolled. Their oxen great, not fat, but well fleshed. The Captain
killed there an Antelope as big as a Colt. There were diverse great beasts
unknown to them. When they had passed this Cape, they lost their Admiral
Captain Raimond, and never saw them, or heard of them more. And four days
after they found as terrible an enemy from above, and encountered with a
thunderclap, which slew four of their men outright, their necks being wrung
asunder: And of fourscore and fourteen men there was not one untouched, but
some were blind, others bruised in their legs and arms, or breasts, others
drawn out, as if they had been racked; which all yet, GOD be thanked, did
after recover.

The Hollanders in the year 1595. traffiked with the Cafres, which were
valiant, but base in apparel, covered with Ox or sheepe-skinnes wrapped about
their shoulders, with the hairy side inward, in form of a mantle: their
priuy-parts covered with a sheep tail, fastened before and behind with a
girdle. But now we see it made a daily matter to the Portugal, English, and
Dutch, so capable of hope of Good, that the Cape of Good hope is nothing
feared: although at home many have no good hope of public good, and wish that
they would carry out of Europe less money, and bring home more men. For my
part, I wish so well to Navigations and discoueries, that I could wish such
complaints to be but calumnies, and to be the knauigations of false
discouerers. I cannot omit, Botero.
that upon the top of this Promontory, Nature has as it were framed her
self a delightful bower, here to sit and contemplate the great Seas, which
from the South, East and West bea^ upon this shore: and therefore has here
formed a great plain, pleasant in situation, which with the fragrant herbs,
variety of flowers, and flourishing verdure of all things, seems a
terrestrial Paradise. It is called the table of the Cape. That which from
hence lies to Cape Negro, has not to our purpose any thing notable. This also
deserves mention, that notwithstanding all the damages of this dreadful
Promontory, and the seas on this side and beyond, Moff^us hist. Ind.l.II.1535.
James Botellius a Portugal, to recover the favor of his Prince, John the
third, by the first bringing news of a happy accident that then befell in
India, in a little boat or vessel scarce eighteen foot long, and six broad,
sailed from Cochin to Dabul, and from thence along the Arabian and African
shores, doubling this Terrible Cape, and missing Saint Helena, came yet safe to
Lisbone, worthily welcomed both for his message, and the messenger, that durst
adventure to encounter Neptunes strongest forces, notwithstanding so weak
furniture.

The Hollanders De Bry Iad. Or. part.3.
at the Cape of Good hope, had of the inhabitants two kine for two rustie
knives, and one much greater for a new one: two fat bulls and three sheep for
a bar of iron, weighing threescore and ten pounds. The people make much
account of iron: they are of short stature: darkish color: their arms are
adorned with copper and iuory, their fingers with rings of gold, and with beads
of bone and wood. They brand their bodies with diverse marks. And because they
always anoint themselves with grease and fat, they yield a rank smell. If we
killed a beast for our use, they would ask the inwards, and eat them raw, the
filth being not well cleansed from them. At their Feasts they would sees a
beast in his hide, fastened on four sticks with fire underneath. They lived
miserably, yet for gallantry ware bones and pieces of dried flesh about their
necks. Near this Cape are weeds growing in the sea five and twenty fathom
long.

The Ascension Cap.Rob.Covert.
built their Pinnesse Anno 1608. at Soldania, about fifteen or sixteen
leagues from the Cape of Good Hope, and there took in for their provision
about four hundred head of cattle, as Oxen, Steeres, Sheep, and Lambs,
together with fowls and fresh water. They filled their boat with Seals at the
I Will Pengwin, a little from thence. Such was the brutish nature of the
inhabitants, that when the English had cast out of their ship one of those
Seals, and the same had lien fourteen days, and now swarmed with crawling
Maggots, they would take them up and eat them; as they would also do the
guts, garbage, and panch of the beasts. They more esteemed iron, then gold or
silver. Here the first night after they weighed anchor, The Ascension lost the
Vnson and the Good Hope, their Pinnesse (so near the Cape of Good Hope) which,
me thinks, observing what after besell them, seems an ommous presage, written
in these names, of their other losses which followed, concluded with the loss
of their ship on the coast of Cambaya. It is morally true, that ascending and
aspiring minds lose Union ( Prou.13.10.
for only by pride does man make Contention) Union being gone, Good Hope
follows, Qn^^ concordia cres^nnt discordia and res and spes pereunt: and so
it befell in this their tragedy, after the loss of those vessels which bare
such names. The ship was lost by the Masters indiscretion, but yet has the
honor (suruiuing her fates) that she was the first English ship that ever
sailed on those seas. The people were saved, and traveled from Surrat to
Brainport, a City bigger then London, of great trading, and so passed till
they came to the Great Mogors Court at Agra, where they saw the beginning of a
goodly Monument, which he has been nine years in building, for his father,
with five thousand workmen continually: the matter is fine marble, the form
nine-square, two English miles about, and nine stories in height, whereon the
Mogor said (as a Friar there reported) that he would bestow an hundred millions
of treasure. From thence some of them passed by land to Bucker and Sucker, (as
he calls them) and thence through Persia to Baydat, and so to Aleppo, from
whence they came for England: which land-trauell through three so mighty
States of the Great Mogor, Soph^, and Turk, had deserved mention elsewhere in
more proper place, if then it had come to my hands. But let us return(left
this Ascension or extension of our Discourse bring it to the like shipwreck)
unto the Ethiopian Cafres.

Modesty had almost forbidden me to recite that, which may with some easily
obtain a Plaudite, in the last Act and finishing of this Chapter, concerning
the Caffares. Linschoten Linschot.c.41.
shall recite it for me. They live, says he, like beasts (he speaks of those
which live near Mosambique, and those especially more within the Land) they
are black as pitch, with flat noses, thick lips, some have holes both above
and under in their lips, and, as it were, other mouths in their cheeks,
wherein they thruft small bones to beautify themselves: for which cause they
raze and sear their bodies with irons. If they will make a devilish form and
picture, they represent a white man in his apparel, as thinking nothing more
ugly. Some also file their teeth as sharp as needles. They have Villages
wherein they dwell together, and in every Village a Lord or King, to whom they
are subject. Religion and Faith are unknown to them. They use mutual wars,
and some eat man's flesh. When they take prisoners in war, or kill their
enemies, they observe a more then beastly testimony of their great valor,
which is after this manner. They cut off their privy members (to deprive them
of all hope of generation) and then dry them well for preservation: after
which, they come before the King with great reverence, in the presence of the
principal men of the Villages, and there take these members, so dried, one by
one in their mouths, and spit them on the ground at the Kings feet, which the
King with great thanks accepts; and the more to honor them, causes them all
to be taken up, and given to them again, which is from thenceforth an ensign
of their Knighthood. For they take all those members, and tie them on a string
like a bracelet or chain; and at all solemn meetings, as when they marry, or
go to a Wedding or Feast, the Bride, or wives of these Knights, do wear that
chain about their necks, being, says our Author, among them as great an
honor as the Golden Fleece, or the renowned Garter with us, and their wives as
proud, as if some Crown or Scepter had befallen them.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Kingdom of Congo, and the other Kingdoms and Nations adjoining.

THe Kingdom Maginus. Gi. Botero Ben.part.I.
of Congo (understanding so much by the name, as in times past has been
subject thereto) has on the West, the Occan; on the South, the Caphars, and
mountains of the Moon; on the East, those hills from which the Rivers issue
and run into the fountains of Nilus; and on the North, the Kingdom of
Benin. Of these Countries, Pig^^fetta Od.Lop.per Pigafet. translated by
A.H.P.du Iarric. hist. Ind. Orient. part.3.
from the relation of Odoardo Lopez, a Portugal, has written two books, out
of whom P.du larric, Boter^ and others, have taken most of their reports.

And in this we will begin with the most Southerly parts; in which we first
come into the Kingdom of Matama (this is the Kings proper name) who being a
Gentile, rules over ^uers Provinces, named Quimbebe. This is a Kingdom
Od.Lopez lib.I.cap.7.
great and mighty, extending from Brauagal to Bagamidri: the air thereof is
wholesome, the earth^ outwardly furnished with store of fruits, in wardly with
mines of Cristall and other metals. The Segniories toward the Seacoast are
very mean, and want Havens. Angola sometime a Province of the Kingdom of
Congo, is now a great Kingdom i^ self, and very populous. They speak the
same language, with small difference of dialect, that is used in Congo, whose
yoke they cast off since the Congois became Christians. Diego Bar. Dec. ^.
lib. 2. cap. 3. Od. Lopez ibid.
Can first discovered these parts for the Portugals, An.1486. And the Portugals
used to trade quietly with the Angolans: but some of them trading as high into
the Country as Cabazza, the royal City, which is an hundred and fifty miles
from the Ocean, were there by order from the King put to the sword, under
pretense of intended treason. This was done 1578. Panlo Dias (to whom the King
Sebastian had given the government of these parts, with license to conquer
three and thirty leagues along the coast to him and his heirs) to revenge
himself for this despite done to his people, armed such Portugals as he had,
and with two Galleys and other vessels, which he kept in the River Coanza, he
went on both sides the River, conquering and subduing many Lords unto him. The
King of Angola raised a mighty army of a million of men, P.Diaz (as some
report) sent a present to Spain, of two buts of Negros noses, which were
slain. A.B.
as is supposed. For they use to leave none at home that is fit to carry a
weapon: and make no preparation for victual, but such, as have any, carry it
upon the shoulders of their servants, and therefore no marvel if their food
being soon consumed, their Camps be soon dissolved. Small likewise is their
provision of armor for offense, and for defense much less. Diaz sent to the
King of Congo for aid, who sent him sixty thousand men: with which, and his
own Nation, he made his party good, against the confused rabbles of the
Angolans. The trade of Angola is yet continued, and from thence the Portugals
buy and carry to Brasil and other parts yearly, a world of slaves, which are
bought within the Land, and are captives taken in their wars. One Thomas
Thom.Turner.
Turner that had lived a long time in Brasil, and had also been at Angola,
told me, that it was supposed eight and twenty thousand slaves were yearly
shipped from Angola and Congo, at the Haven of Loanda. He named to me a rich
Portugal in Brasil, which had ten thousand of his own, working in his Ingenios
(of which he had eighteen) and in his other employments. His name was John de
Paus, exiled from Portugal, and thus enriched in Brasil. A thousand of his
slaves, at one time, entered into conspiracy with nine thousand other slaves in
the Country, and barricadoed themselves for their best defense against their
Masters, who had much ado to reduce some of them into their former servitude.

To return to Angola, we may add the report of another of our Contrymen,
Andrew Battle was taken by the Portugals on the coast of Brasil, and shipped
over to Congo, where (and in the Countries adjacent) he lived very many years,
and was Sergeant of a Band, etc.
Andrew Battle (my near neighbor, dwelling at Leigh in Essex) who served
under Manuel Silnera Perera, Governor under the King of Spain, at his City of
Saint Paul: and with him went far into the Country of Angola, their army
being eight hundred Portugals, and fifty thousand Naturals. This Andrew Battle
tells that they are all Heathens in Angola. They had their Idols of wood in
the midst of their towns, fashioned like a Negro, and at the foot thereof
was a great heap of Elephants teeth, containing three or four tons of them:
these were piled in the earth, and upon them were set the skulls of dead-men,
which they had slain in the watres, in monument of their victory. The Idol
they call Mokisso, and some of them have houses built over them. If any be
sick, he accounts it Mokisso's hand, and sends to appease his angry god,
with pouring wine (which they have of the Palm Tree) at his feet. They have
proper names of distinction for their Mokissos, as Kissung^, Kal^kete, etc. and
use to swear by them, Kissungowy, that is, by Kissango. They have another more
solemn oath, intriall of controversies: This trial is called Motamba.
for which purpose they lay a kind of hatchet, which they have, in the fire,
and the Ganga-Mokisso, or Mokissos Priest takes the same read hot, and
draws it near to the skin of the accused party; and if there be two, he
causes their legs to be set near together, and draws this hot iron
without touching between them; if it burns, that party is condemned as
guilty, otherwise he is freed.

For the ceremonies about the dead, they first wash him, then paint him,
thirdly apparel him in new clothes, and then bring him to his grave, which is
made like a vault, after it is dug a little way down, undermined, and made
spacious within, and there set him on a seat of earth, with his beads (which
they use in chains and bracelets for ornament) and the most part of his goods,
with him in his lasting home. They kill Goats, and shed the blood in the
graves, and power wine there, in memorial of the dead.

They are much given Od. Lopez.
to divination by birds. If a bird fly on their left hand, or cry in some
manner which they interpret ominous and unlucky, they will cease from the
enterprises which they have in hand. Their Priests are Gi.Bot.B^^.part.I.lib.3.
called Gange, and so highly reputed, that the people think it in their power
to send plenty or scarsity, life or death. They are skillful in Medicinal
herbs, and in poisons; and by familiarity with the Devil foretell things to
come.

In Angola cuery man takes as many wives as he will. There are mines of
silver, and of most excellent copper. They have many kine, but love dogs
better then any other flesh, and sat them to the shambles. Andrew Battle told
me, that the dogs in those Countries are all of one sort, prick-eared curres
of a mean bigness, which they use also to hant with, but they open not; (for
because they cannot bark) and therefore they hang clappers made of little
boords about their necks. He has seen a mastiffe sold for three slaves.
Lopez affirms that a great dog was exchanged for two and twenty slaves; which
might happen upon some extraordinary occasion. The money in Angola is
glasse-beads, which they use also, as is said, for ornament. The King of Angola
has seemed willing to become Christian, and has sent to the King of Congo for
that purpose, but could not obtain any Priests in that scarcity to instruct
him.

This Kingdom has many Lord-ships subject thereto, as far on the Seacoast
as C. Negro. Toward a Lake, called Aquelunda, lies a Country called Quizama,
the Inhabitants whereof being governed after the manner of a Commonwealth,
have showed themselves friendly to the Portugals, and helped them in their
wars against Angola. The houses in Angola are made in fashion like a
Bee-hiue. The women at the first sight of the new Moon, turn up their bummes,
in despite, as offended with their menstruous courses which they ascribe unto
her. The men sometimes in a valorous resolution, will deuote themselves unto
some haughty attempt in the wars: and taking leave of the King, will vow
never to return, till they bring him a horse-head, or some other thing very
dangerous in the enterprise, and will either do it or die. Horse-tailes are
great jewels, and two slaves will be given for one tail, which commonly they
bring from the River of Plate, where horses are exceedingly increased and
grown wild. They will, by fiering the grass round about, hemme the horses
about with a fiery circle, the fire still streightning and approaching nearer,
till they have advantage enough to kill them: Thus have the Europaean cattle
of horse and kine so increased in that other world, as they spare not to kill
the one for their hides, and the other for their tails.

Next to Angola Northwards, Od. Lopez.
is the Kingdom of Congo, the Western line whereof Lopez extends three
hundred threescore and fifteen miles; the Northern, five hundred and forty;
the Eastern, five hundred; and the Southern, three hundred and threescore.
The breadth thereof from the mouth of Zaire, crossing over the mountains of the
Sun, and the mountains of Crystal, is six hundred miles. And yet is it much
straightened of the ancient bounds, only the title except, which still holds
the old style: Don Aluaro King of Congo, and of Abundos, and of Matama, and of
Quizama, and of Angola, and of Cacongo, and of the seven Kingdoms of Congere
Amolaza, and of the Langelungos, and Lord of the River Zaire, and of the
Anziquos, and Anziquana, and of Loango. The present Kingdom is divided into
six Provinces, Bamba, Songo, Sundi, Pango, Batta, Pemba. Bamba is the chief
for greatness and riches, then governed by Don Sebastian Mani-Bamba: the word
Mani is a title of honor, and signifies a Prince or Lord: when need requires,
the Mani-Bamba may have in camp four hundred thousand men of war. Therein
are mines of silver: and on the Seacoast, a kind of shells which they use for
money, for silver and gold is not used for money amongst them. In this Prounce
are yearly bought by the Portugals above five thousand Negros. There are among
them very mighty men, that will cleave a slave in the midst, or cut off a
bulls head at one blow. Yea one of them did bear on his arm a vessel of
wine, containing the fourth part of a Butt, and might weigh three hundred and
five and twenty pound, until it was clean emptied. There are certain
creatures as big as Rams, and have wings like Dragons, with long tails and
chappes, and diverse rows of teeth, and feed upon raw flesh. Their color is
blew and green, their skin be-painted like scales, and they have but two
feet. These the Pagan Negro's do worship for gods, and at this day many of
them are kept for a miracle. And because they are very rare, the chief Lords
do curiously preserve them, and suffer the people to worship them, in regard
of the profit which accreweth to them by the offerings which the people make
unto them. Other Creatures of these parts are mentioned in the first Chapter of
this book. Peacockes are not common, and are very dear, their seathers being
used for royal ensigns. The King of Angola brings up some in an enclosed
wood, and suffers none to keep them but himself. To speak at large of the
other five Provinces, would be tedious to the Reader, and Master History of
Congo translated by Abraham Hartwell.
Hartwell has taught Lopez to speak English, of whom such as are desirous,
may be further satisfied. Ouer-against the I Will Loanda, where the shell-money is
gathered, is upon the Continent the Town of Saint Paul, inhabited with
Portugals and their wives.

The Rivers of Congo are many, Bengo, Coanza, Dande, Lembe, Ozone, Loze,
Anibriz, and the greatest of all, Zaire: all which have some, either affinity
in mutual marriages of their streams, or consanguinity in the fountains from
whence they flow, which are certain Lakes, the first of which is Zembre, the
other Aquelunda. In all these Rivers are common the rarities of Nilus, the
ouer-flowing of the waters, Riuer-horses, Crocodiles, and such like. Andrew
Battle told me of a huge Crocodile, which was reported to have eaten a whole
Alibamba, that is, a company of eight or nine slaves chained together, and at
last paid for his greediness: the chain holding him slave, as before it had
the Negroes, and by his vndigestible nature devouring the deuourer; remaining
in the belly of him after he was found, in testimony of this victory. He has
seen them watch and take their prey, hailing a Gennet, man, or other creature
into the waters. A soldier thus drawn in by a Crocodile, in shallower
waters, with his knife wounded him in the belly, and slew him. In their summer
it raineth not, and then the places in their winter (the time of the Suns
nearest presence, attended with daily raines) covered with water, do grow
thick, and matted with abundance of little trees, herbs and plants, with the
fatned womb of that moist soil, conceiueth by the directer beams of the
Sun, which the ouer-flowing waters in the winter carry away, as it were small

Islands, lifting them up together with the roots and soil, the young trees and
dear standing and growing thereon, carried captive unto Neptunes eternal
prisons. In Bengo and Coanza they are forced to set up, for a time, houses upon
cratches, their other houses being taken up for the Rivers lodgings. Zaire is
of such force, that no ship can get in against the current, but near to the
shore: yea it preuailes against the Oceans saltness threescore, and as some
say, fourscore miles, within the Sea, before his proud waves yield their full
homage, and receive that salt temper in token of subjection. Such is the
haughty spirit of that stream, which ouer-running the low Countries as it
passes, and swollen with conceit of daily conquests, and daily supplies, which
in armies of showers are by the clouds sent to his succor, runs now in a
furious rage, thinking even to swallow the Ocean, which before he never saw,
with his mouth wide gaping, eight and twenty miles, as Lopez affirms, in the
opening; but meeting with a more Giant-like enemy, which lies lurking under
the cliffes to receive his assault, is presently swallowed in that wider womb;
yet so, as always being conquered, he never gives over, but in an eternal
quarrel, with deep indented srownes in his angry face, foming with disdain,
and filling the air with noise, (with fresh help) supplies those forces which
the salt-sea has consumed. In this River is a Fish called Ambize, Angulo, or
Hog-fish, that has, as it were, two hands, and a tail like a Target, which
eats like Porke, and whereof they make Larde, and has not the savor or
taste of fish. It seedeth on the grass that grows on the banks of the
River, and never goes out: it has a mouth like the mozell of an Ox: there
are of them that weigh five hundred pound a piece.

About the year 1490. John the second, King of Portugal, sent Consalno di
Sosa, with three ships, and Priests in them, to bring the King and people of
Congo to Christian Religion, Of the conversion of Congo, read 10. di Batros.

which was effected; and although hence arose civil wars amongst them, yet
the matter was at last ended to the advancement of the Christian Religion (such
as the Portugals taught, and no doubt infinitely better then their Pagan
superstition, howsoever spotted with many Romish stains) And from that time to
this, now an hundred and twenty years, has Congo continued Christian, under
John, Alfonso, Piedro, and the rest of their Kings.

When the first Bishop of Saint Thomas went into Congo, to take possession of
his Pastoral charge there (for the Kingdom of Congo was annexed to the
Bishoprike of Saint Thomas) from the Seaside to the City, which is an hundred
and fifty miles, King Piedro caused the ways to be made smooth and trim,
and covered over with mattes, that the Bishop should not set his feet upon
any part of the ground, not adorned: all the ways, trees, and higher places
swarming with people, offering Lambs, Kiddes, Chickins, Partriches, Venison,
Fish, and other necessaries, to testify their zeal. And at last arriving at
the City of Saint Saviors (before called Banza, which signifies a Court, and
is commonly attributed to all the chief Cities, where the King of any of those
Countries holds his residence) he was there received by the King and his
Nobles, and ordained the Church there to be the Cathedral Church of his See,
which had belonging to it eight and twenty Canons, with other Officers, and
ornaments usual.

After Don Piedro succeeded Francisco, and after him, Diego: who being dead,
his son and two other Competitours of the Kingdom were slain, and Henrico,
brother to Diego, was made King, and after his death, Aluar^, whom the Giacchi
drove out of his Kingdom, till King Sebastian sent Francesco di Gone^ to
expel them.

The greatest, and most zealous Prince for Christian Religion, was Alphonso,
who, on pain of death, forbad to all his subjects the having, or worshipping
of Idols, which he commanded should be all brought, and delivered to the
Lieutenants of the Country, together with their Characters and Witcheries. For
before every Lopez.
man adored that which best liked him: some, those Dragons before spoken of;
others, Serpents, which they nourished with their daintiest provisions. Some
worshipped the greatest Goats they could get; some, Tigres; and the more
uncouth and deformed any beasts were, the more in their beastly and deformed
superstition were they observed. Battes, Owls, and Scritch-owles, birds of
darkness, were the objects of their darkened Devotions; Snakes and Adders
enuenomed their souls, with a more deadly poison, then they could do their
bodies. Beasts, Birds, Herbs, Trees, Characters, and the forms of those
things painted and graven, yea the skins of them, being dead, bring stuffed
with straw, had their shares in this diffused variety, and confused mass of
irreligious Religion. The ceremonies they used to them, were, kneeling on their
knees, casting themselves groueling on the earth, defiling their faces with
dust, verbal prayers, real offerings. They had their Witches, which made the
people believe that their Idols could speak: and if any man had recovered of
any sickness, after he had recommended himsefe to them, they would affirm
that the angry Idol was now appeased. All these Idols King Alphonso caused to
be burned in one heap in stead whereof the Portugals gave them Images of
Saints, and Crucifixes to worship. This may seem an exchange rather, then a
ceasing from superstition, were not some fundamental and especial substrance
of Truth communicated, besides those blind shadows, wherewith (no doubt) GOD
draws some out of darkness, this darkness notwithstanding, in a true and
saving, though a dim and shadowed light; wherewith as far going before us
in affection, as we before them in knowledge; I dare not but in the hope of the
salvation of some, thank GOD for this glimse of heavenly light, rather then
rashly to censure and sentence them to a total and hellish darkness.

since sent supplies of religious persons, to confirm them in their
Christianity, and his son, John the third, sent also Jesuits to that
purpose, who erected Schools among them: and they also send their sons into
Portugal to learn the Sciences and knowledge of Europe. GOD Almighty grant
that those fountains may be clea^^ed of all popish mire, that thence more
wholesome waters may flow, to the watering of this Ethiopian Vineyard.

They use in Congo Arthus ca.15. Linschot.lib.2. Andrew Ba'tell says, that the
tree which thus strangely multiplieth it self, is called the Manga tree.
to make clothes of the Enzanda tree, (of which some write the same things
that are reported of the Indian Fig Tree, that it sends forth a hairy substance
from the branches, which no sooner touch the ground, but they take root and
grow up, in such sort, that one tree would multiply it self into a wood, if
Nature set not some obstacle.) The inner-most bark of the Inzanda, by beating,
is made excellent cloth. Other trees there are, which the Tides cover, and are
discovered by the Ebbes, laden at the root with Oisters. But more admirable is
that huge tree called Alicunde, of which my friend Andrew Battle And. Battle.
supposes some are as big (besides their wonderful tallnesse) as twelve men
can fathom. It spreads like an Oak. Some of them are hollow, and the liberal
clouds into those Natural Caskes dispense such plenty of water, that one
time three or four thousand of them in that hot region, continued four and
twenty hours at one of those trees, which yielded them all drink of her
watery store, and was not emptied. Their Negros climbed up with pegges (for the
tree is smooth, and therefore not otherwise to be climbed, and so soft, that it
easily received pegges of a harder wood, driven into her yielding substance
with a stone) and dipped the water, as it had been, out of a Well. He supposed
that there is forty tun of water in some one of them. It yields them good
opportunity for honey, to which end the countrey-people make a kind of Chest,
with one hole into the same, and hang it upon one of these trees; which they
take down once a year, and with fire and smoke chasing or killing the Bees,
take thence a large quantity of honey. Neither is it liberal alone to the
hungry and thirsty appetite, but very bountifully it clothes their backs,
with the bark thereof, which being taken from the younger Alicundes and beaten,
one fathom which they cut out of the tree, will by this means extend it self
into twenty, and presently is cloth fit for Linschot.lib.^.Lopez. These
Boats, says Andrew Battle, are made of another tree, for the A^^cunde is of
too spungie a suostance for that purpose.
wearing; though not so fine as that which the Inzandatree yields. It serves
them also for boats, one of which cut out in proportion of a Scute, will hold
hundreths of men.

Of their Palme-trees, which they keep with watering and cutting every year,
they make Veluets, Sattens, Taffatas, Damaskes, Sarcenets, and such like, out
of the cleansed and purged leaves thereof drawing long and even threeds for
that purpose.

And for their Palme-wiues, which they draw out of the top of a kind of
Palm, which at first is strong and inebriating wine, and in time declineth to
a sour and wholesome vinegar: of the stone of the fruit, which is like an
Almond, they also make bread, of the shale of the fruit, Oil, which also
serves them for Butter: Lopez distinguishes this tree from the Coco tree,
which is there also growing: and another Palm that bears Dates; other that
bear Cola, like a Pineapple, excellent for the stomach, and for the liver
most admirable: it being supposed, that the liver of a Hen or other bird,
putrified, sprinkled with this matter, recouereth the former freshness and
soundness. Other sorts of Palms yield other fruits, and of their leaves they
make mattes, wherewith they cover their houses. Lopez saw a Pomecitron, the
kirnell whereof left within the rind, yielded a pretty tall sprigge in four
days.

Of stones they have such store to build with, that in some places they may cut
out a Church of one piece. There are whole mountains of Porphyrie, of Jasper,
of white Marble, and other Marbles: One especial, that yields fair
Iacinthes, that are good Jewels, straked like as it were with natural veins.

The Port and I Will of Loanda lying ouer-against the Portugal Town of Saint
Paul, famous for many things, deserves especial mention for this, that it
yields, in less then half a yard digging, waters very sweet; but of so
contrary a Nature to the Sea, her mighty neighbor, that when the Sea ebbeth,
the water is salt, and when it flows, the same is sweet and fresh: as if the
Sea imparted that which it self has not, or rather envied that which it has,
and therefore always at his coming, re-demandeth that saltness from those
springs, to attend upon their Ocean-mother. So do we see the silver Lamps of
Heaven in the Suns absence to lighten the World, which yet want light, when
it is most plentiful, to show themselves. Even nature seals and confirms
Monopolies to her principal Courtiers, always provided, that it thereby
better serves for the common good, and therefore no precedent to such dropsy
and splen-like Monopolies, Monie-pollings, with which some exorbitant members
burden themselves, and make others by lighting, heavy: worthily therefore by
the Sun of our Great Britain, at the first rising of his morning
brightness, dispersed from our Horizon. But how far is Loanda from Britain?
And yet our scope is to bring Loanda and all the world else into our Britain,
that our Britains might see the in and outside of the same. Loanda is
reported (as some affirm of Egypt and Nilus) to be the issue of the Oceans
sand, and Coanza's mire, which in process of time brought forth in their
disagreeing agreement, this Island.

In Congo the King is Lord supreme: and none has power to bequeath his goods
to his kindred, but the King is heir general to all men.

CHAP. X.
Of Loango, the Anzichi, Giachi, and the great Lakes in those parts of the
World.

IT follows in the course of our Discovery, to set you on shore in Loango,
the Northerly neighbor of Congo, right under the Line, Lopez l.I.c.5.
whose Country stretches two hundred miles within Land. The people are called
Bramas, the King, Mani Loango; sometimes, as report goes, subject to the King
of Congo. They are Circumcised after the manner of the Hebrews, like as also
the rest of the Nations of those Countries use to be. They have abundance of
Elephants, and wear clothes of the Palm. Andrew Andrew Bat.
Battle lived amongst them two years and a half. They are, says he,
Heathens, and observe many superstitions. They have their Mokisso's or Images,
to which they offer according to the proportion of their sorts and suites: The
Fisher offers Fish, when he sueth for his help in his fishing; the
Countryman, Wheat; the Weauer, Alibungo's, pieces of cloth: other bring
bottels of Wine: all wanting that they would have, and bringing what they want,
furnishing their Mokisso with those things, whereof they complain themselves
to be disfurnished.

Their Ceremonies for the dead are diverse. They bring Goats and let them bleed
at the Mokisso's foot, which they after consume in a Feasting memorial of the
deceased party: which is continued four or five days together, and that
four or five several times in the year, by all of his friends and kindred.
The days are known, and though they dwell twenty miles thence, yet they will
resort to these memoriall-Exequies, and beginning in the night, will sing
doleful and funeral songs till day, and then kill, as aforesaid, and make
merry. The hope of this, makes such as have store of friends to contemn
death; and the want of friends to bewail him, makes a man conceive a more
dreadful apprehension of Death. Their conceit is so ravished with
superstition, that many die of none other death. Kin is the name of unlawful
and prohibited meat, which, according to each kindreds devotion, to some
Family is some kind of Fish; to another, a Hen; to another, a Buffe; and so
of the rest: in which, they observe their vowed abstinence so strictly, that if
any should (though at unawares) eat of his Kin, he would die of conceit, always
presenting to his accusing conscience the breach of his vow, and the anger of
Mokisso. He has known diverse thus to have died, and sometimes would, when
some of them had eaten with him, make them believe, that they had eaten of
their Kin, till having sported himself with their superstitious agony, he
would affirm the contrary. They use to set in their Fields, and places where
Corn or Fruits grow, a Basket with Goates-hornes, Parrats feathers, and other
trash: This is the Mokisso's Ensign, or token that it is commended to his
custody; and therefore the people, very much addicted to theft, dare not
meddle, or take any thing. Likewise, if a man, wearied with his burden, lay it
down in the high way, and knit a knot of Grass, and lay thereon; or leave any
other note (known to them) to testify, that he has left it there in the
name of his Idol, it is secured from the lime-singers of any passenger.
Conceit would kill the man that should transgress in this kind.

In the Banza, or chief City, the chief Idol is named Chekoke. Every day
they have there a Market, and the Chekoke is brought forth by the Ganga, or
Priest, to keep good rule, and is set in the Market place, to prevent
stealing. Moreover, the King has a Bell Recovery of stolen goods.
the strokes whereof found such terror into the heart of the fearful thief,
that none dare keep any stolen goods after the sound of that Bell. Our Author
inhabited in a little Reed house, after the Lcango manner, and had hanging by
the walls, in a Cloth case, his Piece, wherewith he used to shoot Fowls for
the King, which, more for love of the Cloth, then for the Piece, was stolen.
Upon complaint, this Bell (in form like a Cow-bell) was carried about and
rung, with proclamation to make restitution; and he had his Piece the next
morning set at his door. The like another found, in a bag of Beads of a
hundred pound weight, stolen from him, and recovered by the sound of this Bell.

They have a dreadful and deadly kind of trial in controversies, after this
manner. Trial of suspected persons
There is a little Tree, or Shrubbe, with a small Root (it is called Imbunda
about the bigness of ones thumb, half a foot long, like a white Carrot. Now
when any lists to accuse a Man, or Family, or whole Street, of the death of
any of his friends, saying, That such a man bewitched him, the Ganga assembleth
the accused parties, and scrapes that Root, the scrapings whereof he mixeth
with water, which makes it as bitter as gall (he tasted of it:) one Root will
serve for the trial of hundred men. The Ganga brewes the same together in
Gourds, and with Plantaine stalks hitteth every one, after they have drunk,
with certain words. Those that have received the drink, walk by, till they
can make Urine, and then they are thereby freed. Others abide till either Urine
frees them, or dizzinesse takes them: which the people no sooner perceive, but
they cry, Vndoke, Vndoke, that is, naughty Witch: and he is no sooner fallen
by his dizzinesse, but they knock him on the head, and dragging him away,
hurl him over the Cliffe. In every Liberty they have such Trials, which they
make in cases of Theft, and Death of any person. Every week it falls out that
some or other undergoes this Trial, which cosumeth multitudes of people.

There be certain persons called Dunda, which are borne of Negro-Parents, and
yet are, by some unknown cause, white. They are very rare, and when such
happen to be borne, they are brought to the King, and become great Witches:
They are his Counselors, and advise him of luckie and unlucky days for
execution of his enterprises. When the King goes any whither, the Dundas go
with him, and beat the ground round about with certain Exorcismes, before the
King sits down, and then sit down by him. They will take any thing in the
Market, none daring to contradict them.

Kenga is the landing place of Loanga. They have there an Idol called Gumbiri
and a holy House, called Munsa Gumbiri, kept and inhabited by an old woman;
where once a year is a solemn Feast, which they celebrate with Drums,
Daunces, and Palme-wines: and then they say he speaks under the ground. The
people call him Mokissa Cola, or a strong Mokisso, and say, That he comes to
stay with Chekoke, the Idol of the Banza. That Chekoke is a Negro-Image, made
sitting on a stool: a little house is there made him: they anoint him with
Toccola, which is a red color made of a certain Wood This seems to be Red
Sanders. A. Bat. says it is Log^ood.
ground on a stone, and mixed with water, wherewith they daily paint
themselves, from the waste upwards, esteeming it great beauty: otherwise they
account not themselves ready. It is for like purpose carried from hence to
Angola.

Sometimes it falls out, that some man or boy is taken with some sudden
Enthusiasme, or rauishment, becoming mad, and making a whooping and great
clamours. They call them Mokisso-Moquat, that is, taken of the Mokisso. They
cloth them very handsome, and whatsoever they bid in that fit (for it lasts
not very long) they execute as the Mokissos charge.

Morumba is thirty Leagues Northwards from hence, in the Mani-Loango's
Dominion; where he lived nine months. There is a House, and in it a great
Basket, proportioned like to a Hiue, wherei^ is an Image called Morumba, whose
Religion extends far. They are sworn to this Religion at ten or twelve
years old: but for probation are first put in a House, where they have hard
diet, and must be mute for nine or ten days, any provocation to speak
notwithstanding. Then do they bring him before Morumba, and prescribe him his
Kin, or perpetual abstinence from some certain meat. They make a cut in his
shoulder like to an half Moon, and sprinkle the blood at Morumbas feet, and
swear him to that Religion. In the wound they put a certain white powder, in
token of his late admission; which, so long as it continues, does privilege
him to take his meat and drink with whomsoever he pleases, none denying him
the same, at free cost. They also have their fatal Trials before this Image,
where the accused party kneeling down, and clasping the Hiue, says, Mean
quesa ca bamba Morumba, signifying, That he comes thither to make trial of
his innocence; and if he be guilty, he falls down dead; being free, he is
freed. Andrew Battle says he knew six or seven, in his being there, that
made this trial.

Beyond the Country of Loango are the Anzignes Od.Lopez.l.1.^5,
, the cruellest Canniballs which the Sun looks on. For in other places they
eat their enemies, or their dead; but here they take and eat their Kinsfolks
and Countrey-folkes. They keep Shambles of Man's flesh, as with us of Beef and
Muttons. They cate their enemies: Their slaves (if cut out, they will yield
them more in the several Joints, or Pieces, then to be sold alive) they kill,
though it be but to save a halfe-penny. Some of them for weariness of life,
and some (oh cruelty of vainglory) even for valor of courage, in contempt
of Death, and esteeming it an honorable proof of their fidelity and manhood,
will offer themselves to the Butcherie, as faithful subjects unto their
Princes, of them to be consumed and eaten, that with their death, and after
their death, they may do them service.

These Anzichi stretch from Zaire to Nubia. They have many Mines of Copper, and
great quantity of Sanders, read and gray; wherewith (mixed with the Oil of
Palm Tree) they anoint themselves. The Portugalls temper it with Vinegar, for
the healing of the French Pokes: by the smoke thereof they drive away the
headache. It is incredible, or at least would so seem to us, which Lopez
reports, That they carrying their arrows (which are short and slender, of a
very hard wood) in the Bow hand, will shoot off eight and twenty (so many
they hold at once) before the first of them fall to ground; and with a short
Hatchet, with a sudden whirling themselves about, break the force of the
enemies arrows, and then hanging this Hatchet on their shoulder, discharge
their own arrows. They are of great simplicity, loyalty, and fidelity, and
the Portugalls more trust them then any other slaves. They are yet savage and
beastly, and there is no conuersing with them: but they bring slaves of their
own Nation, and out of Nubi^^o Congo to sell; for which they recarrie Salt,
and Shells, which they use for Mon^, Silks, Linen, Glasses, and such like.

They All the Heathen Nations in these parts of Africa are circumcised.
circumcise themselves, and besides that, both men and women, both of the
Nobility and Comminaltie, from their childhood mark their faces with sundry
slashes made with a knife. I asked (says Cap.10.
Lopez) of their Religion, and it was told me that they were Gentiles; which
was all I could learn of them. They worship the Sun for the greatest God, as
though it were a man; and the Moon next, as though it were a woman. Otherwise
every man chooses to himself his own Idol, and worships it after his own
pleasure. The Anzichi G.Bot.Ben. part.1.l.3.
have one King principal, which has many Princes under him.

Of Ambus and Medera, Northern Regions, little besides the names is known.
Biafar is inhabited with people much addicted to Enchauntments, Witchcrafts,
and all abominable Sorceries. Of the Giacchi we have made often mention, and
of their incursions into Congo. These, in their own Language, are called Agag,
as Lopez Lopez.l.1.13. and l.2.c.9.
testifies, and live on both sides of Nilus, in the borders of the Empire of
Mohenhe-Muge. They use to mark themselves about the lip, upon their cheeks,
with certain lines which they make with iron Instruments, and with fire.
Moreover, they have a custom to turn their eyelids backwards, so that their
black skins, white eyes, and cauterized marks seem to conspire a dreadful
and ghastly deformity in their faces. They hold war with the These Amazones
are (as we have observed) doubted of in other places: and Andr.Battle, which
traveled near to those parts, denies this report of Lopez as untrue.
Amazones; and of late years have invaded the neighbor Nations. Their weapons
are Darts, their food humane flesh, without all humanity devoured.

Andrew Battle Andr. Battle lived (by occasion of the Portugalls treachery)
with the lagges a longer time then ever any Christian, or white man had done:
and served the^ with his Musket in their wars: neither could Lopez (says he)
have true intelligence whence they came. For the Christians at that time had
but uncertain co^iectures of them: neither after had the Portugalls any
co^uersing, but by way of commerce: but he being betrayed, fled to the^ for his
life, and after, by stealth escaped from them: the only European that ever
lived in their camp.
lived amongst them sixteen months. He says, they are called Iagges by the
Portugal, by themselves Imbangolas, and came from Sierra Liona. This either is
not the former Nation, but so called of like condition in manners, and invasion
of Countries, or else these reports agree not. Howsoever, he affirms, That
they are exceeding deuourers of man's flesh, for which, they refuse Beef and
Goats, whereof they take plenty. They have no settled habitation, but wander
in an unsettled course. They rise in Harvest, and inuading some Country, there
stay as long as they find the Palms, or other sufficient means of
maintenance, and then seek new adventures. For they neither Plant nor Sow,
nor breed up Cattle: and which is more strange, they nourish up none of their
own children, although they have ten or twenty wives a man, of the properest
and comeliest slaves they can take. But when they are in travail, they dig a
hole in the Earth, which presently receives, in that dark prison of death,
the newborn creature, not yet made happy with the light of life. Their
reason is, that they will not be troubled with education, nor in their
flitting wanderings be troubled with such cumbersome burdens. Once, a secret
providence both punishes the fathers wickedness, and preuenteth a Viperous
generation: if that may be a prevention, where there is a succession without
generation: and as Pliny Plin l.5.c.17.
says of the Esseni; Gens aelerna est in qua nemo nascitur. For of the
conquered Nations they preserve the boys from ten to twenty years of age,
and bring them up, as the hope of their succession, like Negro-Azimogli
Azimogli are the children of Christians ta^^^^ from the parents by the Turk,
the spawne of their lanizaries
, with education fitting their designs. These wear a Collar about their
neck, in token of slavery, until they bring an enemies head slain in
battle; and then are they vncollared, freed, and dignified with the title of
Soldiers. If one of them runs away, he is killed and eaten. So that hemmed
in betwixt hope and fear, they grow very resolute and aduenturous, their
Collars breeding shame, disdain, and desperate fury, till they redeem their
freedom, as you have heard. Elembe the great Iagge brought with him twelve
thousand of these cruel monsters from Sierra Liona, and after much mischief
and spoil settled himself in Benguele, twelve degrees from the Line
Southwards, and there breeds and grows into a Nation. But Kelandula,
sometime his page, proceeds in that beastly life before mentioned, and the
people of Elembe by great troops run to him, and follow his Camp, in hope
of spoil. They have no Fetisso's, or Idols. The Great Iagge, or Prince, is
master of all their Ceremonies, and is a great Witch. I have seen this
Kelandula (says our Author) continue a Sacrifice from Sun to Sun; the
Rites where of were these: Himself sat on a stool in great Pomp, with a
Cappe adorned with Peacockes feathers (which Fowls, in one Country called
Shelambanza, are found wild) and in one place empaled, about the grave of the
King, are fifty kept, and fed by an old woman, and are called Ingilla
Mokisso, that is, Birds of Mokisso. Now about him thus set, attended forty or
fifty women, each of them wearing continually a Zebras tail in their hands:
There were also certain Gangas, Priests, or Witches. Behind them were many
with Drums and Pipes, and Pungas (certain Instruments made of Elephants
teeth, made hollow a yard and half, and with a hole like a Flute, which yield
a loud and harsh sound, that may be heard a mile off.) These strike, and sound,
and sing, and the women weaue (as is said) till the Sun be almost down. Then
they bring forth a Pot, which is set on the fire, with Leaves, and Roots, and
Water therein: and with a kind of white powder, the Witches, or Gangas, spot
themselves, one on the one cheek, the other on the other; and likewise their
foreheads, temples, breasts, shoulders, and bellies, using many inchaunting
terms, which are holden to be prayers for victory. At Sunne-set a Ganga
brings his Kissengula, or Warre-Hatchet, to the Prince (this weapon they use to
wear at their girdles) and putting the same in his hand, biddes him be strong,
their God goes with him, and he shall have victory. After this they bring him
four or five Negros, of which, with a terrible countenance, the Great Iagge
with his Hatchet kills two, and other two are killed without the Fort.
Likewise, five Kine are slain within, and other five without the Fort; and as
many Goats, and as many Dogs, after the same manner. This is their
Sacrifice, at the end whereof all the flesh is in a Feast consumed. Andrew
Battle was commanded to depart when the slaughter began, for their Devil, or
Mokisso (as they said) would then appear and speak to them. This Sacrifice is
called Kissembula; which they solemnize when they attempt any great enterprise.
There were few left of the natural Iagges, but of this unnatural brood the
present succession was raised.

Now that we have thus discoursed of these former Nations, let us take view of
the more inland and Easterly borders, which abutte on Congo: where we shall
find the great Lake Aquilunda, which with her many Rivers aforesaid waters
all that great Country, assisted therein by a far greater Lake, called
Zembre, great Mother and chief Lady of the Waters in Africa. As for the
Mountains of the Moon, now called Toroa, there is a Lake called Gale, of no
great quantity, whence issues a River, named Camissa, and by the Portugalls,
the sweet River, disemboquing at the False Cape, an Arm whereof had before
entered the Sea (in 32.40.) of Infant Io.di Barros Dec.1.l.3.c.4. Od.

, one of Dias his companions, in the first Discovery of those parts, called
Infant because he there went first on Land. But from those Hills of the Moon,
the Lake whence Nilus springs has no help. Neither are there two Lakes,
East and West, distant from each other about four hundred and fifty miles, as
Ptolomey describes; for then the one should be in the confines of Congo and
Angola, the other about Sofala and Monomotapa: where is found but one Lake (for
Aquilunde is no tributarie to Nilus.) This Lake is between Angola and
Monomotapa, and contains in Diameter 195. miles. There is indeed another
Lake which Nilus makes in his course, but stands Northward from the first
Lake Zembre, and not in East or West parallel. Neither does Nilus (as some
affirm) hide it self under the ground, and after rise again, but it runs
through monstrous and desert Valleys, without any settled Channel, and where
no people inhabiteth, from whence that fabulous opinion did grow. This Lake is
situate in twelve degrees of Southerly latitude, and is compassed about like a
vault with exceeding high Mountains, the greatest whereof are called Cafates,
upon the East; and the Hills of Sal-Nitrum, and the Hills of Silver on another
side, and on the other side with diverse other Mountains. The River Nilus
runs Northwards four hundred miles, and then enters into another great
Lake, which the inhabitants do call a Sea. It is much bigger then the first,
and contains in breadth two hundred and twenty miles, tight under the
Equinoctial Line. Of this second Lake, the Anzichi give certain and perfect
intelligence: for they traffic into those parts. And they report, That in
this second Lake there is a people that sayleth in great ships, and can write,
and uses number, weight, and measure, which they have not in the parts of
Congo; that they build their houses with Lime and Stone, and for their fashions
and qualities may be compared with the Portugalls. This seems to be in
Goiame, where the Abassine entituleth himself King, and in his title (as
before Cap.3.
you have read) calls it the Fountain of Nilus: which Alvares F. Alvares,
c.135.
also mentions, that Peter Covilian saw. He affirms, That there are Jews
about those parts, which perhaps are the people that the Anzichi speak of.
From this second Lake in Goiame, the River which is there called Gihon, passes
through the Pretes Dominion to Meroe, and so to Egypt, as elsewhere is showed.
In these two great Lakes are diverse Islands, that we speak not of the
Tritons, and other I know not what monsters, there reported to be found. The
Lake Zembre yields not Nilus alone, but Zaire, a far more spacious River in
wideness, and more violent in force then Nilus, or any other River in Africa,
Europe, or Asia, of which we lately related. And besides her Northern and
Western tributes, carried by those two Rivers to the Mediterranean and Ocean
Seas, she sends her great streams of Magnice, Coava, and Cuama, into the
inner or Eastern Ocean.

Magnice Od.Lopez. l.2.c.9.
springing out of Zembre, receives in his voyage to the Sea three other
Rivers; Nagoa, called S. Christophers; and Margues, which both spring out of
the Mountains of the Moon, by the people there called Toroa: the third is
Arroe, which besides his waters, pays to Neptune, which neither needs, nor
heedes it, a great quantity of Gold, which it washes from the Mountains of
Monomotapa (a Country extending it self between Magnice and Cuama) whose
seven mouths seek to swallow up many Islands which they hold in their jaws,
but through greediness loose that which greediness makes them seek, not able
to swallow so great morsels, which therefore remain and are inhabited with
Pagans. Boterus G.Bot. B^^ part.1.l.3.
says, That this River runs out of that Lake, a great space in one channel,
and then is divided into two; the one called Spirito santo, running into the
Sea, under the Cape Couenti; the other Cuama, receives the Rivers Panami,
Luangua, Arruia, Mangiono, Inadire, Ruina, and is sailed more then seven
hundred miles.

Coava is also a great River. The inhabitants within Land, about these Rivers,
are (as you have heard) Pagans and rude people. Let me now have leave to convey
my self down this River Coava into the Ocean, and there take view of the many
Islands with which Nature has adorned this African world, as with many
Brooches and Jewels set and hanged about the fringes of her garments: and first
learning what we can by hearsay of the Islands in and from the Red Sea
hither, we will in some Portugal Carricke sail round about the African Coast,
and acquaint you with what we shall find worthiest observation: and then not
willing as yet to set foot in Lisbone, as we meet with the fleet of Spain
sailing to the Newfound World, will pass with them for further Discoueries.
For, to go into the Mediterranean, to discover the African Islands there, will
scarce be worth the while. To hear a little of those few may content us.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Seas and Islands about Africa: The ancient and modern Observations,
Nauigations, and Discoueries.

AFter this long and tedious journey over Land, where the steep and Snowie
Mountains, the myrie and unwholesome Valleys, the vnpasiable Wildernesses, swift
Rivers, still Lakes thick Woods, and variety of the Continent-obseruations,
have thus long whiled us; let us now, by a swifter course, take view of the
African Seas, and those Islands which they hold always besieged, but never
conquer. In the first place presents it self to our Discovery that Sea, which
separateth (after the modern reckoning) Africa and Asia asunder. This is
called the Red Sea; which name (says Plin.l.6.c.23.
Pliny) the Grecians call Erythraeum (this word signifies Read) and is
ascribed by some to a King named Erythras; by others, to the repercussion of
the Sunne-beames; by others, to the color of the Sand and Earth (in the
bottom;) and by others to the nature of the water it self. Solinus Solin.c.42.
affirms, it is called Erythraeum, of King Erythrus, the son of Perseus and
Andromade, and not only of the color, alleging M. Varro.
Varro, that learned Roman, for his author: who also mentions a Fountain on
the shore thereof, which changes the color of the Sheep fleeces which
drink there, into a duskish and darker color. Strabo Strab. l.16.
cites the testimony of Nearchus and Orthagoras, concerning the Isle Tyrina,
two thousand furlongs from Carmania, in which the Sepulcher of Erythras is
showed, being a great Hill, planted with Trees: and that he reigned in those
parts, and left his name thereunto: which they learned of Mithropastes, who
flying from Darius, had lived in that Island. Barrius To.d: Borros, Dec.
2.l.8.c.1. Al, Alboquerke.
writes, that Alfonso Dalboquerque (that victorious Portugal, who subdued so
many Islands, Seas, and Kingdoms to that Crown) in a Letter to King Emanuel
affirms, That it may be called the Red Sea, of certain read spots, or
staynes, which are seen therein: and when he entered into the Straits, he
encountered a great vein of red water, extending it self from Aden as far
as they could see from the Ships tops. These read veins of water the
Moors ascribed to the ebbing and flowing of that Sea. John di Castro Ioh. di

(afterward Viceroy of India) sailed to the bottom of the Strait, as far as
Suez, and much labored to find the cause, why it should be called the The
Scripture often mentions this Sea: but calls it, as Tremel. and Iun.
translate, mare algosum, or, after Vatablus, Carectosum; of the weeds
plentifully growing therein. Exodus 10.18. etc.
Read Sea. He, in his Map of these parts, says, That he saw therein many
such read spaces of water, but taking up the water in a Vessel, out of the
Sea, it seemed clearer and more christalline then that without the Straits: He
caused also some to diue, which did bring him out of the sandy bottom a red
matter, braunched like Coral, and some like Oranges. In other places where
were green spots in the Sea, were taken out green branches: and where the
Sea was white, the sand there-vnder was very white: and though the depth in
some places amounted to twenty fathom, yet the purity of the christalline
waters caused this transparent color. Near to Suachen he found most of those
spots, and from thence to Alcocer, the space of four hundred miles. But nearer
the bottom, toward Suez in a great space he saw none. Further, without the
Strait, he saw such read Luys de Vrreta says, That the sands on the shore,
and that the Mountains are red, which the Sun shines on, and by reflection of
the beams causes that redness. Hist. Eth^op. l.1.c.11.
spots or veins of water at Cape Fartach, as if Oxen had been slain there,
yet the water taken up in a vessel seemed clear; and he supposed that this
redness proceeded of the Whales bringing forth their young. Barrius misliketh
that conjecture, and those other of antiquity, in searching the cause of this
name of Read, and is of opinion, That the violent currents of the Tides,
assisted with some tempestuous winds, raise up from the bottom that read
floor, whereof we have spoken, and cause, by the motion of the same under the
water, that redness in the upper face thereof: which is in more spacious
quantity near the Straits, where there is greatest force of the Tides; and
the threeds or strains of this redness are less in the greater and more
spacious Sea-roome. The Portugal Pilots first thought, that the winds brought
out red dust from the dry soil of Arabia, which no man's experience has
confirmed. Andrea A. Corsali let. 2.
Corsali, which sailed and warred under the Portugals in these Seas, An. 1516.
says, he knows not why it should be called red, for the water is colored as
in other Seas: which seems to cross the former reports: and may either be
construed of the water generally not discolored, or perhaps while he was
there, the tides and winds did not conspire so boisterously, as at some other
times they do, against the yielding and weaker soil in the bottom thereof.
How ever it be for, this redness, many deceive themselves in streitning this
name to the Arabian Gulf, which the Ancients Live.l.45.Plm.l.6.c.24.
gave unto all the Seas from Egypt to India: and reckon the Persian and Arabian
Gulfs, arms of the red Sea. Yea Arrianus, (not he that writ Arrian.de reb.
Alexan.1.8.
Alexanders life, who yet in the report of Nearchus his voyage from Indus, to
the River Tigris, calls it the Red Sea: but an other of that name) in his
Arriani Periplus Ortesius. Tepidum Rubenti Tigrim immiscet freto. Senec. T^o^^:
Periplus of the Erythrean Sea; (translated into Italian by Ramusius, and set
forth by Ortelius in a peculiar Map: thereof) comprehends in the title of the
Red Sea, all from Arsinoe and Egypt, to Malacca, or the Chorsonesus aurea.
Having now troubled you with the name, why, and how far, the name extends:
we may view the Isands therein situate: which if any would more fully know, let
him read Arrianus and Barrius, and the voyage of Solomon Bassa, 1538. unto

action: I must but touch the principal. Sues is the beginning of this Sea,

Heroum, is the place where the Turk has his Arsenall, and Galleys, for those
Seas, the matter whereof is brought out of Caramania, by Sea, by Nilus, and by
Camels over Land the rest of the way, at incredible charges. Here in old times
was a channel which conveyed the waters of Nilus to this place, where they had
Cisternes to receive it; all destroyed by the Mahumetans: and now the
Inhabitants fetch the water, which they use, six miles off. Some think that
Pharaoh was here drowned: which passage other set down at Tor where the Sea is
straightened, and is not above nine miles over. It seems that the prints of the
Chariot wheels, which Orosius Oros l.1.c.10
affirms, still remained as testimonies of Pharaohs ouer-whelming under those
waves, and could not by any industry of man be done out, but by the mighty
hand of God were soon restored in the same form, are not now there to be
found: for they would soon end the controversy.

they keep the middle, and have Pilots for that purpose, homewards they have
other Pilots, which direct the ship within the shallowes: and are taken in at

Strabo says, the ancient Kings of Egypt chained to keep the passage. Zidem is
12. leagues from Meca, where the ships have used to unlade their spiceries, as
before at Berenice: without this Town is a Moschee, which the Moors say is
the Sepulcher of Eua. Their water is rain water, reserved in Cisternes.
Passing by the I Will Mehun, the I Will Camaran is famous by the diverse spoils there
made by the Portugals: it is in 15. degrees. This Island (says Corsali) is the
hotest place that ever I saw: not one of us, but had our secret parts chased
and flaied with heat: and many of our company died. Dalaccia is an Island where
they gather pearls. Suachen is the best harbor in all the gulf, which the
Turks have taken from the Abissine: it stands in 19. degrees. and a third. Mazzua
is an Island which makes Ercocco a good haven. But of the haven and Ports on
both sides the Gulf, Barrius Bar.D^c.2.l.^
relates more largely. Of the Isles Achafas and Tuicce we have but names:
likewise of others; whereof Ptolomie Ptol.l.4.c.8
does number a great multitude. The people of these parts are Mahumetans, and
many Baduins, Heretical and theeuish Moors. Many Jews are in Adom, the
chief Town of merchandise in these parts: the King whereof (after much kind
gratulation) Soliman Bassa hung up at the yards arm: and at his return dealt
the like dole to the King of Zibit, subiecting their States under treacherous
pretenses to his great Master. Scaliger Ios.Scalig. Can.Is.
tells of Samaritans dwelling in an Island of the Red Sea, which, when any man
landed there, would religiously forbid to touch them: as we have before
mentioned. The Ascension R.Couerte.
ascended into the Red Sea, An. 1608. to Moha, which is a City of great trade.
In the Ocean with out the strait, near to the African shore, are not many
Islands mentioned by the Ancients. Arrianus in his Periplus speaks of seven
Islands, called Pyralaon: and of an other great Island near to them, called
Menuthesias or Menuthias, now called Madagascar, and S. Laurence: some take it
for the Island of Iambolus, whereof Diodorus Dio.Sic.l.3.cap.13.
has largely related, and Ramusius Ramus.part.1
has discoursed thereon: other seek for that Island in Somatra. That Iambolus
was a Merchant, which trading in Arabia for spices, was taken by thieves, and
made a shepherd: after carried away by Aethiopians, who took these forrainers
according to their rites, to expiate their Country. For they were enjoined by
Oracle to make such expiation once in 600. years, with two men that were
forrainers. For the fulfilling whereof they were put in a boat, fit for two
men, with six months victuaile: and commanded to sail Southwards, and they
should come to a happy Island, where the men lived a blessed life. And if they
came safe thither, their Country should enjoy prosperity 600. years: if they
turned back, they should bring upon them much trouble. The Aethiopians mean
while kept holy days, and offered Sacrifices for their good voyage, which in
four months they achieved: and were exceeding courteously used and
entertained of the Ilanders. These were four cubits higher then other men,
very nimble and strong. The reports of this his voyage savor more of an Sir

commonwealth, then of true history. Yet is it thought (as Ramusius
discourses) not altogether fabulous, but that he was indeed in some remote
Island, to which he applied such fancies, as Diodorus reports. To leave there
the certain fictions, and uncertain conjectures of Antiquity: and come to
more certain relations; the only Island of name without the streit is,
Socotera, in 13. degrees. Corsali A.Corsali. let. 2. was at Soquotera. An. 1516.
thinks it unknown to Ptolomie, (which others suppose to be his Insula
Dioscoridis) he says, that it was inhabited of Christian shepherds, which
lived on milk, and butter: their bread was of dates: like to the people of
Prester John, but their hair was longer, clothed with one only piece of cloth
about their priuities; The Land barren, as in all Arabia Foelix, and the
Seacoasts governed by the Arabians. Hence comes and is named the Aloe
Socotrina Maginus.
. They are Iacobits, and have Churches with Altars, and observe the Cross with
great reverence: they enter not their Churches, but stand in the Churchyard,
or Porch. Their Abuna, or Priest, rules them. Other Governor they have none
of their own. The Portugalls have two Towns there, Coro and Benin. They
Porie.before ^^ co, cap de Insulu.
hold opinion that S. Thomas here suffered ship wrack: and that of his ship was
built an ancient Church, which is yet to be seen, walled about with three
partitions, and three doors. They live for the most part in cabbins of boughs,
or in Caves: their women are as good Soldiers as the men. They are much
addicted to Magic, and bring to pass matters incredible, although the Bishop
excommunicate such as use it. They will with contrary wind hinder men that in
damage them, from failing away. Conceited they are exceedingly of their own
excellence. Two small Isles lie to the North of Socotera, called the two
Sisters; the Inhabitants of an Olive color, without law among themselves or
commerce with others. There M. Pola l.3. Cap. 33.34.
are also those two Isles, the one, of men; the other, of women; which we
mentioned in our fifth book, Cap.^3.page 438.
A matter, how true I know not, but very strange. They are Christians, subject
to the Bishop of Socotera, and he to the Zatoia in Ba^dach.

Many other Islands there be of no great name in that Sea, called Sinus
Barbaricus: as of Don Garcia: the three and the seven brethren, of S. Brandon,
S. Francis, Mascarentia, De Natal, C^m^r^, and many other: besides those of
Quisoa. Mosambique, and some other for their vicinitie to the Land before
handled. The I Will Alaginus.
of St. Laurence (so called by the Portugalls; by themselves, Madagascar) is
meetest in all those parts, to entertain the Readers observation, as being one
of the greatest Islands of the World. It contains in breadth four hundred and
fourscore miles, in length a thousand and two hundred, in compass four
thousand miles. M. Polo M. Polo.l.3. cap.35.
says, the Inhabitants were Saracens, and were governed under four Lords,
eat Camells flesh, use merchandise or arts. Thus far did the great Can
stretch his Tartarian Dominion: and sent hither to spy the Land. That which
Polo says, he heard of a Bird in this Island, called Rush, so big as it could
take up an Elephant, has no likelihood of truth. He calls it Magascar. It is
situate from seventeen to six and twenty. of Southerly Latitude

judge rightly, having many fair and fresh Rivers, safe harbors, plenty of
fruits and cattle; therein are four gouernements, each fighting against
other. They use not themselves to trade with others, nor suffer others to
traffic with them. The Portugalls have some trade with them, but go not on
Land. In the first discovery of them Osor.l.4.
by the Portugalls, 1506. they showed themselves in hospital and treacherous,
rewarding received kindness, in their Canoas or Boats, made of the body of a
Tree, with shot. There Ph.Pigafetta. Congo.l.2.c.9.
are said to be some white people, supposed to be of Chinian offspring.

Of the people of Madagascar the Hollanders report De Bry.part.3 Ind.Or.,
that they are of color black, strong, and well made: they cover their
priulties with cotton: they have large holes in their ears in which they wear
round sticks. They acknowledge one Creator, and observe Circumcision, but know
nothing of praying or keeping festiualls. They have no proper names, whereby to
distinguish one day from another: neither do they number Weeks, Months, or
Years. Nor do they number above ten. They are exceedingly afraid of the
Devil, (whom they call Tainuaddei) because he uses often to afflict them.
They live most-what on fishing. They marry but one wife: their time of
marriage is, for the men, at twelve; the women, at ten years of age. Adultery
and Theft are punished with death. The men use to hunt abroad, the women
spinne their Cottons at home, whereof they have Trees yielding plenty. If any
man kill any of his Kine, all his Neighbors may challenge part. In St. Marie,
an Island by Madagascar, they met with the King, which was observed of his
Subjects with great reverence. Here they buried one of their dead men, the
Ilanders being present, who signified by signs that his soul was gone to
heaven: and would have had them to cut off his legs by the knees. The I Will of
Cerne, they called Manrich Island. They found excellent Eben Trees there, the
wood where of is as black as pitch, and as smooth as Iuorie, enclosed with a
thick bark. They found of the same kind some red, some yellow. There were
Palme-Trees like the Cocos. They found store of Birds, whereof they might take
some in their nests with their hands. There were no people inhabiting. In the
channel between the firm Land, and Madagascar, are many Islands G.B.B.del
Isole.
great and small, all inhabited by Mahumentans: the chief of which is St.
Christopher, more Northwards against Mombaza, and Melinde, are three Islands,
Momfid. Zanzibar, and Pemba: inhabited with Mahumetans of white color. In the
time of M. M. Polo l.3.c.36.
Polo, Zenzibar was Heathenish: the Inhabitants, he says, very gross and
deformed; and likewise the women. Near the Cape of Good hope are the Isles of
Don Aluares and Tristan d'Acunnha: but, of no great note. The deepnesse of
these Seas, make them incapable of many Islands.

ON this side the the Cape Linschot.l.1.94.Hist. of China.part.3.c.vlt.
is the Island of St. Helena, in 16. degrees and 1/4. of Southerly Latitude. It
is very high and hilly: the name was given of the Saint, on whose day it was
discovered. It has in it store of Goats, Hogs, Hens, and other creatures,
which the Portugalls have there left to multiply: for before there was none of
them: there also they have planted Figs, Oranges, Limons, and such like,
whereof the Valleys are full: that it seems an earrhly Paradise, the fruit
growing all the year long. They have great store of fish, of which with
crooked nails they take great plenty: the Rocks yield salt for the furthering
of their provision. It seems God has planted it in convenient place, for the
long and dangerous. Indian Nauigations. There the Portugalls leave their sick,
which stay till other ships come the next year to take them. It was never
inhabited: only an Heremite dwelt there, who under pretense of mortifying his
flesh by penance, butchered the flesh of the Goats and Bucks so fast for their
skins, that the King sent for him home, and will suffer none to dwell there.
Abraham Kendall put in there about the year 1591. and left on shore one Segar
a sick man, whom Edm.Barker. Hak lo.2 part.2

it distracted him, and being otherwise of bodily constitution very well, he

Clerchagen took the same 1598. The Isles of St. Matthew, Santa Cruz, St.Paul,
and Conceptio^ yield small matter of history. Next to Cape Verde stand seven
Islands, full of Birds, empty of Inhabitants, called Barbacen^. But those that
are called the Isles of C. Verde are nine, situate between the Green and White
Capes: Linschoten reckons ten. They were first discovered by Antonio di Nolli,
a Genoway, 1440. None of them are inhabited, but the Isles of Iago, and Del

Gooseberries: which begins at 20. degrees, and continues till 34. far off
in the Sea: for the ships in their going to India keeping near the shore meet
not with any. The Sea seems as a green field, so thick that a man cannot see
the water, and hinders the ships passage, except they have a strong wind. The
coast of Africa is 400. miles distant, neither is any Island near: save that
these weeds seem to make many Islands. Thus do men in ships behold the wonders
of the Lord in the deep, no Land being nigh, nor no ground to be found,
although it is thought to come from the ground. And indeed all those Seas are
full of wonders, as they pass along the coast toward the Indies. Tho. Th.

Steuens complains of the continual thunders, lightnings, and unwholesome
raines which there they met: the rain water, if it stands a little, converting
presently to worms, and filling the meat, hanged up, with worms. An herb
also swamme upon the face of the waters like a Cocks-combe, so venomous, that
it can scarce be touched without peril: Fishes, called Sharks, most ravenous
deuourers, which had other six or seven smaller fishes, guarded with blew and
green, attending like Seruing-men. Fishes also (as big as a Hering) with
wings, which do not so much help them by flying to escape an other greater
fish, that pursues them by Sea, as endanger them to a Sea-Fowle, which waits
that opportunity. Neither can it fly high or far, or longer then the wings

the Superiors to lie with them, before they lay with them. Don Henry conquered
the rest which Batancourt had not possessed. Their former government was by
190. persons, which ruled also in matters of religion, prescribing to the
people their faith, and worship. They had in higher name of authority a King,

therefore committed to their prisoners: they which did this, lived separate

may be showed in some other instances, of which read M. Hakl. his Epistle

Portugalls praises, but to give Antiquity their due; which, I think, could
not ordinarily compass so long a Navigations for want of the compass: yet we
should injury our Authors if we should not believe somewhat: although not so
much as they report.

That of Eudoxus is the most credible: but not without suspicion in so long a
voyage, of a private man.

NOW are we shipped for the New World, and for new Discoueries. But seeing
this Inkie Sea, through which I undertake a Pilots office to conduct my
Readers, is more peaceable then that, which on the backside of this American
World, was called the Mare Pacisicum, and del Sur. Ortel. Theat.
Peaceable, by Magellane the first discouerer: it yields us the fitter

Rotero. Relatifni part.1.l.4. Gomara bist.genesisetc.
the best Authors have thought worthy the first place in their Histories of
these parts. Yet, before we pry into Natures mysteries, the better to know our
intended voyage, let us enquire somewhat of the names, if any notice may thence
arise, of the places thereby known.

The New World, is the fittest name which can be given to this vast and huge
Tract; justly called New, for the late discovery by Columbus, Anno Domini
1492.: and World for the huge extension thereof; (as Master Hak.tom.3. Epist.
Dedicat. Maginus. Ger. Mer. de Fabrica Mundi.
Hakluyt has observed.) A new World it may be also called, for that World of
new and unknown Creatures, which the old World never heard of, and here
only are produced: the conceit whereof moved Mercator to think (which I dare
not think with him) that the great Deluge in the days of Noab, drowned not
these parts, because M^n had not here inhabited, who with a Deluge of sin
might procure that deluge of waters.

America is a more common then fitting name, seeing Americus Vespucius the
Florentine, from whom this name is derived, was not the first Finder, not
Author of that Discovery: Columbus will challenge that, and more justly, with
Munst.Cosm.libr.5.
whom, and under whom Americus made his first voyage, howsoever after that, he
coasled a great part of the Continent which Columbus had not seen, at the
charges of the Caflilian and Portugal Kings Maff histor.Ind.libr.2.
But so it might more rightly be termed Cabotia, or Sebastiana, of Sebastian
Cabor a Venetian, which discovered more of the Continent then they both, about
the same time; first employed by Hak.to.3 pa 7
king Henry the seventh of England, and after by the Catholic King.

Columbus yet, as the first Discouerer, deserves the name, both of the
Country, for the first finding, and of Modesty, for not naming it by himself,
seeking rather effects, then names of his exploits. But leave we these Italian
Triumviri, the Genuois, Venetian, and Florentine, to decide this question among
themselves: and why now is it called the West Indies? To this
Acost.histor.Ind.Ind.Ind.ca.14.
Acosta's Exposition of the word Indies, that thereby we mean all those rich
Countries, which are far off, and strange, is too general an answer, and
gives not the true cause of the name. Gomara says, that a certain Pilot, of
whom Columbus received his first Instructions, took it to be India: or else
Columbus himself, thinking by the West to find a nearer passage unto the
East, by reason of the Earths roundnesse, sought for Cipango, or Iapan, and
Cathay, when he first discovered the Islands of the New World. And this opinion
is probable, Pet.Mart. dec 1.lib.1.
both because he named Hispaniola, Ophir, whence Solomon fetched his gold:
and Sebastian Cabot in the first Voyage, which he made at the charges of King
Henry the seventh, intended (as himself Hak vbi supra.
confesses to find no other Land but Cathay, and from thence to turn toward
India: and the opinions of Aristotle Arist.de coelo and inundo.
and Seneca, that India was not far from Spain, confirmed them therein
Maginus says it was called India, because it was discovered at the same time
that India was found by the Portugals, or else for the likeness of manners in
the Indians.


Now, that we may descend from the Name, to the Nature of this new World: a
World it is to see how Nature does deflect and swerve from those grounds and
principles which the Naturallists, Ptol. Strabo. Plutarch, and some others
mention the Ethiopians beyond the Tropike of Cancer: and Taprobana, Agisimba
etc. It seems that their meaning was, it was very scarcely inhabited, of few
and small nations. Experience has found no place more peopled.
and Philosophers her forwardest Scholars have set down for Rules and Axioms
of Natures working. For, if we regard the ancient Poets, Philosophers, and
Fathers, we shall see them deceived, and that not in few Opinions, which they
seemed to have learned in Natures Sanctuaries and inmost Closets. In the
Heavens, they supposed a burning Zone; in the Earth, a Plage, plagued with
scorching heats: Vtque duae dextra Coelum, totidemque sinistra
Parts crant Zonae quintaest ardentier illis,
Stc --
-- Totidemque plagae tellure premuntur
Quarum quae media est non est habitabilis aestn
Ntx teg it alta du^s, tetide^ inter vtramque locauit:
Temperiemque dedit.


And Oirg. cui A^vas statnit in suo Hypercritico Scalig.Geor. li.^
a greater then Ovid: Quinque toneut Coelum Zone; quaru^ vna c^rasc^,
Semper sole rubens etc.


The sense whereof is, that those parts of the world next the Arctike or
Antarctike Poles are not habitable, by reason of extreme cold; nor the middle
part, by reason of unreasonable heat: the two other parts temperate, and
habitable.

The Philosophers accounted this no Poem, or rather were more Poetical
themselves: For that which those accounted a torrid and scorched earth, these
Cic^o somn. Scipi^nis. Macrob. in some. Srip.l.2.c.9.
made to be a spacious and impassable Ocean, where the Stars, hot with their
continual motions, and the Suns thirsty steedes, wearied with their daily
journey, might find moisture to refresh and nourish their fiery constitutions.
And therefore they divided the Earth into two habitable Islands, compassed
about, and severed in the mids with a huge Ocean: On this side whereof we are
sicuated, and beyond, the Antipodes. Some Philosophers Leucippus. Democritus,
Epieurus. Anaximande^.
indeed held otherwise, but with greater errors, as Leucippus, Democritus,
Epieurus, Anaximander, which multiplied worlds, according to their fancy. Raw
and uncertain were the conjectures of the Aristot.2. meta.c.5. Plin.l.2.c 68.
best. Yea, those whom we reverence, as better then the best Philosophers, had
no less errors in this point. The Golden-mouthed Chrys^st.^u^^ 14 and 17.in
Heb.Th^d.
Doctor had a Leaden conceit that the heavens were not round, whom Theodoret is
said to follow. Theophilact Theophilact.in 8.cap.ad Heb.
alleges Basil for this his assertion, nec mobile esse coelum, nec circulare,
that heaven is neither moveable nor round, How firmly, and confidently does
Firmianus Lact l.3.c.24. Institutionum.
Lactantius both deny and deride the opinion, that there are Antipedes; But
easier it was for him, with a Rhetorical flourish, (wherein I think of all
the Latin Fathers, he deserves highest prize and praise) to dash this opinion
out of countenance, then to confute the Arguments and Allegations. which he
there cites in the Adversaries name. But he that surpassed Lactantius no less
in knowledge of truth, then he was surpassed by him in smoothness of Style,
herein holds equipage, and draws in the same yoke of error. I mean him,
whose venerable name no words are worthy and sufficient to Vshes in, Saint
Augustine: who, though somewhere Aug.to. ^.december Categori^.
he affirms the Antipodes, yet elsewhere Aug.de ciuit. dei l. 16 c.11.
pressed with an Argument, how men should pass from these parts in which Adam
and Noah lived, to the Antipodes, through that unmeasurable, Ocean, he thought
it easiest to deny, that, which certain experience at that time could not so
easily prove: although Viues in eundem.
even then some reports (but obscure and uncertain) had been spread abroad of
sailing about Africa, as Lib.7.c.vlt.
a little before is showed; which must enforce that which Augustine denied.
Some Acosta and Sixth. Senens bibliot.l 5. annot. 3.
also allege Nae^ian^en, Hierome, and Procopius, for this or the like opinion.
But Poets, Phisosophers, Fathers, (in other things worthy our love, for their
delightful Poems; our admriation, for their profound Science; our awefull
respect and reverence, for their holy learning, and learned holiness) herein
we bid you farewell: magis amica very: as; our America, subject to that
supposed burning Zone, with clouds and armies of witnesses in her well peopled
Regions can auerre, that the parts betwixt the Tropikes are both habitable and
inhabited: and for the Perio^eci, Periaeci are those which dwell in the same
paralels, but contrary Meridians. Anlicthones, which dwell in the opposite
Zone or plage of the world. The Peri^ci have Summer and Winter, but not day and
night a like: The Antaci have day and night, a like, but not the seasons of the
year. The Annp^^des differ in both.
Ant oeci, Anticthomes, and Antipodes, the worlds roundnes, and other things of
like nature, this America yeeldes and is sufficient proof: and the yearly
compassing the world (which the Spaniards and Portugales divide betwixt them)
makes more then evident. And let those two English Ships, the only two of one
Nation which ever have failed, and that with admirable success and fortune,
about the Globe of the earth, tell Lactantius Ghost, whether they dropped into
the clouds (as he feared) there to become new constellations, which Antiquity
would easily have artibuted to them The Golden Hind (which trauersed the world
round, and returned a golden Hind indeed, with her belly full of Gold and
Silver) is yet at Deptford, there resting after her long journey, offering up
herself to time, her deeds to eternity. That which beguiled the ancients,
was the neerenesse of the Sun, his direct beams, and the swift motion of the
heavens, which, they coniectured, did chase away cold, and moisture out of all
those parts. And hardly could reason otherwise guess, till experience That all
the world is habitable, see the discourse of George Best. in a Preface to the
Northwest discoueries of M. Frobisher and inserted Hak. voyag to.3.p.48.
has showed the contr^^ie. For never is it moister in those parts, between
the Tropikes, then when the Sun is nearest, then causing terrible storms and
showers every day: as if having drunken too much in his long and hot journey
over the Ocean, he did there vomit it up again. Once, the people of those
parts reckon it Winter, when the Astronomer would call it Summer: because of
this taedious weather which every day happening cannot but cool the air and
earth, with a marvelous temper: and on the other side, they call the time of
the Suns absence, Summer, because of the perpetual cleanenesse, which
continues those six months; the Sun then exhaling no more vapors then his
hot stomach can digest, which with his directer beams being drawn up,
surcharge him with abundance; and in the middle Region of the Air, by the
then stronger Antiperistasis are thickened into raines, and attended with
Thunders and Lightnings, proclaim daily defiance to the Earth: threatening
harm, but doing good: cooling the same, after the morning-Sunne has heated
it, the showers then falling, when the Sun threatens his hotest fury and
violence.

These raines make the like inundations and ouerflowings of Rivers in America
(as before we have observed in Nilus, Niger, and Zaire in Africa) which
breaking their bounds, and driving the Inhabitants, sometimes to dwell on trees
growing, sometimes in their carcasses framed into Boats or Canoes, therein to
retire themselves, till the Waters are retired, cause a cooling and refreshing
to the earth, which they cover and shield by their inundations from the Suns
angry arrows. As in a Limbecke, a strong fire eauseth abundance of vapors to
be extracted out of herbs, or other matter, which being pressed, and
finding no issue, turn into water: and if the fire be small, it exhausteth
the vapors as fast as it raises them: So the Sun (in his greatest strength)
exhaleth these plentiful vapors, which it distilleth in showers, which in
less heat are of less quantity, and more easily consumed. Without the
Tropikes it is contrary: for the Sun is dry, the Winter moist; the cause
being the Suns weakness, not able to concoct and disperse the vapors
which the moist earth, then easily yields: which in his greater force in the
Summer season we see effected: The like we see in green wood and dry on the
fire.

It is no less worthy note, that no part of the World has so many, so great
Lakes, and Rivers: the vapors and Exhalations whereof, can not but cool and
moysten the neighboring Elements of the Air and the Earth. Again, the equal
length of the Days and Nights perpetually sharing the Time in equal portions,
causes Qnodque die Sol^s violento incanduit aestu: Humida Nox reficit
paribusque refrigerat bor^s, Honterus.
that the heat is not so unequal as the Ancients dreamed. The great deawes
also in the night, which are greater then we would think, and comparable for
wetting to pretty showers, increase the freshness and coolness.

We may add heereunto, the neighborhood of so huge an Ocean, the propriety
of the Winds, which in most places between the Tropikes are set, and
certain, no less then the Sun and Tides, and bring with them much
refreshing: Further, the situation of the Land does further the cold not a
little, in those hot Regions; D. Fletcher.
Contrariwise, near the Poles, the continuance of the Sun, and long da^es
make it hoter then in parts nearer the Sun; as in Russia, then in England.
Yea the high ridges and tops of some mountains in the burning Zone, are
insufferable for cold, always having on them, snow, hail, and frozen
waters, the grass withered, and the men and beasts which do pass along that
way (for here is no convenient dwelling) benumbed with the extreamitie of
cold.

-- Paries cum proximus alget,
When the Mountains are subject to this Degree of cold, it can not but temper
the Nighbour-Regions, with some coolness at least. Now to all these Reasons
of the Temperature, under the Line, and between the Tropikes, some add the
influence of some unknown Constellations. Only let this be remembered, That the
former hold not equally in all parts of the Torride Zone, seeing that Nature
has diuersified her self in diverse places, and by natural exceptions has
bounded and limited those general Rules.

In some places, under the Line, it rayneth not at all: in other-some, those
cooling Winds are wanting: neither has every Region Lakes, Rivers, or
Mountains to refresh them. But of these particulars we shall take better view
in their peculiar places. In the same space the winds are most-what Easterly,
and without the Tropikes westerly: so that the Mariners use not to go and
return the same way, but observing the general winds, seek to make use
thereof accordingly. The reason of this Easterly wind under the Zodiake Acosta
l. 3. c. 6.
is ascribed to the motion of the heavens: the first, moveable drawing with his
own motion the inferior Orbs, yea, even those elementarie, of the Fire,
Air, and (where it finds no other obstacle) of the water also, as Pet. Mart.
Dec 3.l.^. Sir H^^f. Gilbert Discou. Master George Best.
some suppose. But for the Air (whereof we now specially speak) the motion
of the Comets, circularly carried in the Air, (where also their motion is
diverse, as is observed in the Pianets) does sufficiently prove. Without the
Tropikes from 27. to 37. degrees, the winds are said to be ^or the most part
westerly, moved as some think by the repercusion of the Air, here prevailing
against that force of the heavens, which mastereth it within the Tropikes: even
as we see waters, being encountered with others of more force, return in a
manner back. This of the Easterly winds is to be understood of the Sea: for
at Land, though there winds be (as before is said) certain and set, yet that
which is the general wind of one country is not general to all: yea, in the
same country they have a set wind in some places for the day, and another
quite contrary blows in the night. Linscboten I. 3.
Also, near unto the coasts they are more subject to calmes in this burning
Zone, then further off in the Sea, the grosser vapors which arise out of the
Earth, and the diverse situation thereof being the cause of these differences.
Such is the force of this natural situation, that in some places it is strange
what effects it produces. There is in Peru a high Mountain called Patiacaca,
whereupon Joseph lof. Acoft. Nature. and Moral Hist. of the Indies.l,3.c.9.
Acosta, says he ascended as well provided as he could, being forewarned and
forearmed by men expert. But in the ascent he and all the rest were surprised
with so sodame panges of straining and casting, and some also of scowring, that
the Sea-sicknes is not comparable hereunto. He cast up Meat, Phlegm, Choler,
and Blood, and thought he should have cast out his heart too. Some thinking to
die therewith, demanded Confession: and some are said to have lost their lives
with this accident. The best is, it lafts but for a time, neither leaves any
great harm behind. And thus it fares in all the ridge of that mountain,
which runs above a thousand and five hundred miles, although not in all
places alike. In four different passages thereof, he found the like
difference and distemper, but not so grievous as at Pariacaca. He ascribes it
to the subtlety of the Air on those high hills, which he thinks are the
highest in the world: the Alps and Pirenees, being, in respect hereof, as
ordinary houses, compared to high Towers. It is desert, the grass often burnt
and black, for the space of five hundred leagues in length, and five and
twenty or thirty in breadth. There are other Deserts in Peru, called Punas,
where the air cutteth of man's life without feeling: a small breath, not
violent, and yet depriving men sometimes of their lives, or else of their feet
and hands, which fall off as a rotten Apple from a Tree, without any pain.
This seems to be done by the force of cold, which in the Northern and
Northeasterne parts of Europe works like effects: some This Master G^^rge
Barkley, a Merchant, which lived long in Liuonia, told me of his own sight.
being found dead suddenly in those sledds in which they came to market,
sitting therein as if they were alive, and some loosing their ioints, by the
like cause. But this makes up the strangeness of these mortal accidents, that
this piercing cold air both kills and preserves the same body, depriving it
of life, and yet freeing it from putrefaction. A certain Dominike passing that
way, fortified himself against the cold winds, by heaping up the dead bodies
which here he found, and reposing himself under this shelter, by these dead
helps saved his life. The cause is, Putrefaction cannot be procreated, where
her parents, Heat and Moisture are confined, and have little or no force. The
Seas which compass this western India, besides the Magellane strcits, and the
Northern unknown, (for the knowledge whereof our countrymen, Sir Mar.
Frobish. Master John Dauis. Tho. Hudson.
Frobisher, Danis, Hudson, have adventured their lives and fortunes, and at
last have given us more hope then ever of the discovery) are the great and
spacious Ocean, which on this side is called the North Sea, and on the other
side of America, is named the South Sea. The qualities thereof will better
appear, when we come to speak of the Islands therein.

Concerning the Land of the New-world, Acosta divides it into three parts,
high, low, and mean: which hold almost the same proportion that Master
Lambert Lambert. Peramb. of Kent. Wealth without health. Health without wealth.
Health and wealth.
observes of Kent, the first having some wealth, by reason of the Havens, and
Ports therein, and of the vines that grow there, but are very unwholesome: the
hills are healthful, but not fertile, except in the Silver bowels, and golden
entralls thereof: the third is the most commodious habitation, where the soil
yields Corn, Cattle, and Pasture, and the Air, health. The principal
thing that has brought this Western India into such request is, the Mines and
mettalls therein. The wisdom of GOD Acosta. l. 4. c. 2
has made mettalls for Physic, for defense, for ornament, and specially for
instruments in the work which God has imposed upon man, that in the sweat of
his brows he should eat his bread. The industry of man has added another

a Golden and Silver Age indeed to the Spaniards, for the condition and state
which hereby accreweth to them, not for the conditions and state of life, which
they observe: In the year 1587. When Acosta came to Peru, eleven millions were
transported in the two Fleetes of Peru and Mexico, almost one half thereof for
the King. In the time when Pollo was Governor of Charcas in Peru, from the
Mines of Potozi alone were drawn and customed every day thirty thousand
Pezoes of Silver, every Pezo amounting to thirteen Rialls, and a fourth part:
and yet it is thought the one half was not customed. And at this day says
Acostel. 4. c. 7.
Acosta, the Mines of Po^ozi yield the King a million of Silver, for his fifth
yearly, besides the wealth that grows by Quickesiluer, and other Prerogative.
In the year 1574. were ent^ed threescore and sixteen millions. That which is
wrought in this country is not entered, besides prinie conueyances. How much
differs Potozi from the Mine Bebello in Spain, one thousand and five hundred
paces deep, admired, and that justly, by Plin.l.2.3.c.6.
Antiquity, for yielding three hundred pounds weight of Silver a day to
Hannibal, but with much more charges, by reason, of the intolerable pains in
drawing out the waters, which therein flowed, and in Potozi are wanting? But
what will not this unlovely love of money do? hereby man encountreth the vast
Ocean, passes the farthest and most contrary climates, drowneth Boots and

where so many bodies are pined, so many souls endangered, so much good lost
for goods, and man, for price, sets himself at the worst and basest price
of all that he has. How happy and golden was the outward state of these
Indians, before they accounted gold any part of their happiness, and found it
the cause of their ruin? Their gold is found either in Grains which they
call Pippins, because they are like the Pippins or Seeds of Melons; which is
pure and has no need of melting: or in powder, which is found in Rivers,
mixed with the soil and sand^ for which Tagus, Pactolus, and Ganges have been
famous: or else in stone, being ^^ vein that grows and engenders,
intermixing it self with the stones ^^ Toose Pippins, or pieces of pure

drown the soul in perdition and de ^ruction. The greatest quantity is
drawn at the Indies in the poulder-gold. The gold in stone is drawn out of
the mines or pits, with great difficulty. They rofine pouldred gold in
basens, washing it in many waters, until the sand fall from it, and the gold,
as most heavy, remains in the bottom. They have other means of refining it
with Quicksilver and strong Waters. In the Fleet 1585. the declaration of the
Firmeland was twelve Cassons or Chests, which was so many hundredth weights of
gold: besides one thousand fifty and six Mares from New Spain, which was for
the King only, not mentioning that which came for Merchants, and private men.

For the Silver: the second place is given to it among metalls, because next to
gold it is the most durable, and less endamaged by the fire, and in the sound
and color, passes the gold. The Mines thereof are commonly in Mountains and
Rocks, seldom in Plains, and Champaines. Sometimes they find it Pl^ny says

and arms of Trees. Strange it is that in some places the fire, kindled with
blowing of bellows, will not serve to refine the Silver, but they use furnaces
called Guayras, set in such places, where the wind continually blows. See of
these labors. Plin. l.33 c.6. and more in Acosta l. 4.
Thus in Peru, the mines of Porco sloupe to artificial fires, which those of
Potozi scorn and contemn. Potozi is a dry, cold, barren, and unpleasant
soil, if the rich Mines did not more then supply all those defectes, and make
it a plentiful both habitation and Mart; not fearing the heavens disasters,
the cold Air, the frowning Earth, the fell showers, so long as the Silver
hook can be sufficient attractiue for foreign store. Hence it is, that they
feel no want of store, and yet have no store but of want; the Mines excepted,
which (I know not how) are both store and want, according as men's minds in a
second refining can digest and dispose them. They which work in the Mines see
no sun nor light, by absence where of they find both extreme cold, and
dreadful darkness, and an air so unwholesome, as makes them no less sick, then
men tosled at Sea. They break the metal with hammers, and split it by force,
and then carry it up on their shoulders, by Ladders made of Neates Leather

of one Ladder begins another with seats of wood between, to rest them. They

stades in height. The most usual manner of refining in these times is by
Quicksiluer: and therefore there are not now above two thousand Guayras in
Potozi, which have been in times past six thousand: a pleasant fight to such,
whose darkened conceits make their heaven upon Earth, to see such a resemblance
of the Starrie heaven in the night, dispersing such a manifold light. The

is admired for his natural properties, that being a metal it is Liquid (not

be called Quicksilver, but) by it own Nature: and being a liquor, is more

be believed. Nothing in this admirable liquor is more to be admired, then the
natural love, and sympathy which it has to Gold: as appears in such, as

if they wear a Gold Ring in their mouth, it attracteth this quick and
willing metal to it, from the Veins and inward parts, into which it had
secretly and dangerously conveyed it self: the Ring plucked out of the mouth
is of a Silver complexion, which mutual copulation nothing but fire can
divorce, or restore the same to the former color. In their gildings of curious
works, it has been observed that the workmen which use Quicksilver to that
purpose, to prevent the secret and venomous exhalations thereof, have swallowed
a double duckat of Gold rolled up, which draws that fume of this liquor which
enters in at the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, unto it in the stomach. Acosta
says, that if it meet with no solid body, where it may congele, it ascends
till the air by cooling the fume causes it to fall in Quicksilver.
And for this fume Lemnius tells, that the Gold-Smithes hanging a cloth over
the place where they Guild, which receives the fume of the Quicksiluer, find
that smoke in the cloth; recovering again his former nature in drops of that

report that this Spettle of man, arising of secret vapors out of the body, as
infectious exhalations out of unwholesome Lakes, especially when a man is
fasting, kills Scorpions, and other venomous beasts, or at least does much
hurt them. Quicksilver disdaineth other metalls, only it is thus ravished
with gold, and not a little affected to silver, for the refining of which, it
is principally in use: it corrupts, forces, consumes, and flees the rest,
as much as may be, and therefore they use to keep it in Earthen Vessels,
bladders, skins, quills, and such vnctucus receptacles. It has pierced and
eaten through the bodies of men, and has been found in their graves.
Quicksilver is found in a kind of Stone, which does likewise yield
Vermillion. At Amador de Cabrera is such a Stone, or Rock, fourscore yards
long, forty broad, interlaced with Quicksilver, with many pitts in it,
threescore Stades deep, and is able to receive three hundred workmen: it is
valued worth a million of Gold. From the mines of Guancauilca, they draw
yearly eight thousand quintals of Quicksilver, As for the manner of resining

Concerning the first knowledge of these parts, it may justly be a question
whether the Ancients ever heard thereof. For to say nothing of that opinion,

but rather forced by weather, then directed by skill; and thus it is likely
that some parts of America have been peopled. This I much doubt; whether their
Science in Navigations was such, as that they would voluntarily adventure, and
could happily effect, this voyage to and from the West Indies. The most
probable History in this kind is (in my mind) that of D. Powell history of
Cambria page.22; A.D. 1 170.
Madoc ap Owen Gwyneth, who by reason of civil contentions, left his Country
of Wales, seeking adventures by Sea, and leaving the coast of Ireland North,
came to a land unknown, where he saw many strange things.

This by D. Powell, and Mr. Humfrey Floyd, is thought to be the Continent of
the new world, confirmed here in by the speech of Muteaeuma, professing his
progenitors to be strangers; and so were all the Mexicanes to those parts, as
the History in the eighth Chapter following will show: and by the use of
certain Welsh words which Dan.lngram Ha^.edit.1.to.3. Mereditih ap Rise and
Gutyn Owen make mention of this Owens Navigations. See Hak to 3.page 1.
Danid Ingram observed in his travel through those parts. The History adds
that he left certain of his people there, and coming home for more people,
returned thither with ten sail. Howsoever, it is certain that the prints of
this British expedition are in manner worn out, and no sign thereof was
found by the Spaniards: Only A.S. Andrews cross in Cumana. A cross ten foot

they used a Cross in Cumaha: in the Island of Acuzamil, the same was
worshipped: but without any memory of Christ, or any thing favoring that way:
and might as well be there without any Christians erecting, as those Crosses
which in the former book we have showed, were in the Temple of Serapis, at
Alexandria. As for Mutezuma being a stranger, it might be so, and yet his
progenitors of some other parts of America. And the words of Welsh are 3.or

very few, which, as it happens in any other language, might by some chance
come to pass. But if any be desirous to believe, that this Madoc peopled the
Continent or Island of America, rather then the Terceras, or some of the African
Islands, I will not hinder: nor will I run too much out of compass, in
pleading for the Compass, as which only can direct in such spacious Seas. Yet
of this opinion is that learned and judicious Author, Josephus Acosta, who
diligently discussing this question, How men passed first to the Indies;
largely, and learnedly contendeth, that they came not thither purposely, if
they came by Sea, but by distress of weather; and yet finds no less
difficulty, (that way) in the transporting beasts; especially wild, and
unprofitable beasts, which it is not like any would take into Ship with them,
much less convey them over so huge an Ocean. At last he concludes, that
although some might arrive there by ship-wracke, and tempest of weather, yet is
it most likely that the first inhabitants (descended of Adam and Noah, of which
one Act.17.26.
blood God has made all mankind, to dwell on all the face of the Earth, and
has assigned the bounds of their habitation) passed thither by some place
where the Continent of our world ioineth with America: or the Islands thereof,
are found fit mediators for this passage, being not far distant from the
land. Ortchus in his map of mare Pacificum, af. firmeth that the people
ofAmerica in likelihood were peopled from Europe by Gronland Ifland, Fri fland,
and.
And this on the North parts of the world, (where they place that strait of
Anian, not yet certainly discovered) may be so: besides that, on the South,
men might pass from the coasts of Malacca to Iaua, and so to the South
Continent, and from thence by the Magellane streights into America. Gronland is
thought also, by some, to be the same Continent with Estotiland on the North.
Some Negro's by force of tempest, it is probable, have passed hither, because
in Careca some have been found, between S. Martha, and Cartagena. Of whom

and those French Worthies, Du Bartas, and Philip Morney. It is not likely that
the beasts could otherwise pass, but by the Continent, or by Islands not far
off from the Continent, or from one another. Here also arises another
question, how these beasts could pass from the parts of the known world,
where none such are known: to which it may be answered, That GOD has
appointed to every Creature his peculiar nature, and a natural instinct, to
live in places most agreeing to his nature: as even in our world, Nonomnis fert
omnia tellus: Every Country has not all Creatures: the Elephant, Rhinoceros,
Riuer-Horse, Crocodile, Camel, Camelopardalis, and others, are not ordinarily,
and naturally in Europe: nor the Zebra in Asia or Europe: and the like may be
said of many other Creatures.

Now, as in the Arc it self, (the Cradle of man, and stall of bests,) we
must not only observe Nature and Art, for the making and mannaging thereof,
but a higher and more powerful hand: even so in dispensing the Creatures which
came from thence, they chole places by their own natural instinct, and man
disposed, by his industry, according as he had use of them; but most of all,
the secret and mighty providence of God co-working in those works of Nature and
Industry, and (in likelihood) infusing some more special and extraordinary
instinct in that replenishing and refurnishing of the world, Act. 7.26.
Assigning their seasons and bounds of habitation, has thus diuersified his
works, according to the diversities of places, and sorted out to each Country
their peculiar creatures. As for the coming by ship, it is for the beasts
improbable, for the men (by any great numbers, or of any set purpose) unlikely,
seeing in all America they had no shipping, but their Canoes. The beasts also
have not been found in the Islands, which are in the Continent. And if any
hereunto will add a supposition, that there might be some Islands or Parts of
the Continent in times past, which is now swallowed by the merciless Ocean, so
that then there might be a way, which now is bu^ied in the waves: (as some Sir
Humphrie Gilberts Discovery of the North-west.

As for the Indians own report of their beginnings, which some ascribe to a
fountain, others to a Lake, others to a Cave, or what other opinion they
conceive thereof, we shall more fitly observe in their proper places,
discoursing of their Religions and Opinions: Now for the first certain
Discovery of this New World, the World generally ascribes it to Columbus, and
worthily: but Columbus himself is said to have received his instructions from
another.

This History is thus related by Gomara: A certain Carauell, sailing in the
Ocean, by a strong East wind long continuing, was carried to a Land unknown,
which was not expressed in the Mappes and Cards. It was much longer in
returning, then in going; and arriving, had none left alive but the Pilot, and
three or four mariners, the rest being dead of famine and other extremities;
of which also the remnant perished in few days, leaving to Columbus was borne
at Cugurco, or (as some say) at Nervi in the territory of Genua: he was a
mariner from a child, and traded into Syria, and other parts of the East.
After this he becam a master in making sea-cards: he went to Portugal, to
learn their nauigations on the coast of Africa, and there married. Gom. ca.14.
R. Eden:
Columbus (then the Pilots host) their Papers, and some grounds of this
Discovery. The time, place, country, and name of the man is uncertain: Some
esteem this Pilote an Andaluzian, and that he traded at Maders, when this
befell him: some, a Biscaine, and that his traffike was in England and France;
and some, a Portugal, that traded at the Mina: some say he arrived in
Portugal; others at Madera, or at one of the Azores: all agree that he died in
the house of Christopher Columbus. It is most likely at Madera. This relation
of Gomara (as it has no witnesses to prove it, the whole company being dead;
nor any good circumstances, so) Benzo Hier. Benzo lib.1.ca.5.
plainly affirms it to be a fable, and a Spanish trick, envying a foreiner
and Italian that glory to be the first finder of the Indies. He cites out of
Peter Martyr an other cause that moved Columbus to this Discovery, and not
that Pilotes Papers or Reports Gaspar E^t libr. 1.ca.2. coniectureth, that
Columbus (moved with his own conjectures to this discovery) was confirmed
further therein by this Pilote, which is said to die in his house.
. For, he being a mariner, used to the Sea from his youth, and sailing from
Cales to Portugal, observed, that at certain seasons of the year, the Winds
used to blow from the West, whch continewed in that manner a long time
together. And deeming that they came from some coast beyond the Sea, he busied
his mind so much here with, that he resolved to make some trial and proof
thereof. When he was now forty years old, he propounded his purpose to the
Senate of Genua, undertaking, if they would lend him ships, he would find a
way by the west unto the Islands lands of Spices. But they rejected it as a
Dream.

Columbus frustrate of his hopes at Genua, yet leaves not his resolution, but
goes to Portugal, and communicates this matter with Alphonsus King of
Portugal: but finding no entertainment to his suites, sen ^eth his brother
Bartholomsew Columbus to King Henry the seventh of England, to solicit him in
the matter, whiles himself passed into Spain, to implore the aid of the
Castilians herein.

Bartholomew F^rnand Colamb-^n vita patris Christopho.i.cap.13.Hack. tom.3.
unhappily lighted on Pirates by the way, which robbing him and his company,
lorced him to s^^laine himself with making of Sea-Cardes. And having gotten
some what about him, presents a Map of the World to King Henry, with his
brothers offer o^: Discovery: which the King gladly accepted, and lent to call
him into England. But he had sped of his suite before in Spain, and by the
King and Queen was employed according to his request. For coming Gomara c.15
from Lisbone to Palos di Moguer, and there conferring with Martin Alonso
Pinzon, an expert Pilote, and Friar Io.Perez a good Cosinographer, he was
counseled to acquaint with these his proiects, the Dukes of Medma Sidoma, and
of Medina Caeli: which yielding him no credit, the F^ier counseiled him to go
to the Court, and wrote in his behalf to F^er Fernand di Telavera the Queens
Confessor,. Christopher Columbus came to the Court of Castile, An.1486, and
found cold welcome to his s^te, at the hands of the King and Queen then busied
with hot wars in Granada, whence they expelled the Moors. And thus remained
he in contempt, as a man meanly clothed, without other Patrou then a poor
F^er, save that Alonso di Quintaniglia gave him his diet, who also at last
procured him audience with the Archbishop of Toledo, by whose mediation he was
brought before the King and Queen, who gave him favorable countenance, and
promised to dispatch him, when they had ended the wars of Granada, which also
they performed. Thus Columbus is set forth with three Caruells at the Kings
charges, who because his treasure was then spent in the wars, borrowed
sixeteene thousand ducats of Jews de Sanct' Angelo: and on friday the third
day of August, in the year of our Lord 1492. set sail for Gomera, one of the
Canarie Island, and having there refreshed himself, followed his Discovery.
After many days he incountred with that herby Sea (whereof before we have

French, English, and Dutch resound thy name, or his name rather, Proverb.30.4
whose name, who can tell? that would acquaint thee and the world by thee, with
news of a New World. But lest we drown our selves in this Sea of Ecstasy and
Admiration, let us go on shore with Columbus in his new discovered Island. And
first me thinks I see the Spaniards, yesterday in mutiny, now as far
distracted in contrary passions; some gazing with greedy eyes on the desired
Land; some with tears of iny, not able to see that, which the joy of seeing
made them not to see: others embracing, and almost adoring Columbus, who
brought them to that sight: some also with secret repinings envying that glory
to a stranger; but biting in their biting envy, and making show of glee and
gladness: all new awaked out of a long trance, into which that stepmother
Ocean, with dangers, doubts, dreads, despaires had dejected them, revived now
by the sight of their Mother Earth, from whom in unknown arms they had been
so long weaned and detained. On shore they go, and felling a tree, make a
Cross thereof, which they erected on the shore, and take possession of that
New World in the name of the Catholic Kings. What worldly joy is not mixed
with some disastre? their Admiral here splitteth on a rock, but the men are
saved by the help of the other ships. This fell out in the North part of
Hispaniola (so named by them, and by the Inhabitants called Haytin) where they
had first sight of Inhabitants, which seeing these strangers, ran all away
into the mountains. One woman the Spaniards got, whom they used kindly, and
gave her meat, drink, and clothes, and so let her go. She declaring to her
people the liberality of this new people, easily persuaded them to come in
troops to the ships, thinking the Spaniards to be some divine Nation, sent
thither from Heaven. They had before taken them for the Caribes, which are
certain Caniballs, which used inhumane huntings for humane game, to take men
for to eat them: Children likewise, which they gelded to have them more fat,
and then to devour them: the women they are not, but used them for
procreation, and if they were old, for other services. The Ilanders had no
other defense against them but the woody hills, and swiftest heels: to which
they betook them at the Spaniards arrival, thinking them (as is said) to be
Caniballs. And such have they since proved, in effect, Bart.del^s Casas,

, that a bearded Nation should spoil their Images, and spill the blood of
their children, as we shall see in the particular Tractate of Hispaniola.
Nothing more pleased the Spaniards, then the gold, which the naked Inhabitants
exchanged with them, for bells, glasses, points, and other trifles. Columbus
obtained leave of Guacanarillus, the Cacike or King, to build a fort The fort
of The Nativity in Hispaniola.
, in which he left eight and thirty Spaniards, and taking with him six
Indians, returned to Spain, where he was ^^^^^ly welcomed of the King and
Queen. The Pope Alexander a wicked Pope. Guicciard.lib. I. and he of whose

(then a Spaniard, Alexander the ^^^^ring of this, divided the World, by his
Bull, betwixt the Portugals and Spaniards. The Bull is become an Unicorn, and
his two horns are now grown into one: in the uniting of the two states.
Columbus, graced with the title of Admiral, and enriched with the tenths of
the Spanish gains in the Indies, is sent a second time, with his brother
Bartholomew, who was made Adelant ado or Deputy of Hispaniola. They had allowed
them for this Expedition, small and great, seuenteen sail. The first Island he
espied in his second navigations, he called Desseada or Desired, because he
had longed to see land. Arriving in Hispaniola, he found the Spaniards which
he had left there, that they were now not left, nor any where to be found. The
Indians had murdered them and laid the blame on the Spanish insolences. He then
discovered Cuba and Iamaica, with the neighbor-isles. Returning to Hispaniola,
he found his brother and the Spaniards in dissension and separation, and
punishing the Authors of sedition, returned home. In the year of our Lord, one
thousand four hundred ninety seven, he made his third voyage, and then
touched on the Continent; discovered Cubagua, Pauia, and Cumans.

But Koldanus Ximenius raising a rebellion, and accusing the Columbi to the
King, effected that Bovadilla was sent Governor into Hispaniola, who sent the
two brethren bound as prisoners to Spain: unworthy recompense of the worthy
attempts of these Worthies. The King sreeth them, and employeth Christopher in
a fourth voyage, 1502: in which Ovandus the Governor forbade Columbus the
first finder to land on Hispaniola. Gasp.En^ lib. 1.ca.5.
He then discovered Guanaxa, Higuera, Fondura, Veragua, Vraba, and learned
news (as some say) of the South Sea. He stayed at Iamaica to repair his
fleet, where some of his men were sick, and they which were sound in body,
were more then sick, f^oward and ^^^^^^ in behavior, and many left him. Upon
this occasion the Ilanders also for sooke him, and brought in no victual.
Herewith Columbus, neither able to abide, nor depart, was driven to his shifts,
no less admirable for suttletie then resolution. Vide libr. 5. ca.16.page 452.
He told the Ilanders, that if they did not bring him in provision, the Divine
Anger would consume them, a sign whereof they should see in the darkened face
of the Moon within two days. At that time he knew the Moon would be
eclipsed, which the simple Ianders seeing, with fear and grief humbled
themselves to him, and offered themselves ready to all kind and duetifull
Offices. At last, returning into Spain, he there died, Anno 1506. His body was
buried at Civil in the Temple of the Carthusians. This was the end (if ever
there can be end) of Columbus. Pinzonus Nauigationes Vine. binzoni Nau.Alb

one of Columbus his companions, by his example invited, made new Discouer^e^^^
and Vespucius, and Cabota, and many other, every day making new searches and
plantations, till the world at last is come to the knowledge of this New world
almost wholly. The particulars will more fitly appear in our particular
relations of each country.

After this discourse of the men in those parts, let us take some general view
of the other creatures, especially such as are more generally dispersed through
the Indies. I have before noted, that America had very few of such creatures as
Europe yields, until they were transported thither: and therefore they have
no Indian names for them, A rule to know what beasts were here natural (or to
such they have names in their own Language) and what transported: for these
the Indians call by their Span. names.
but those which the Spaniards that brought them, give unto them: as horse,
kine, and such like. They have lions, but not like in greatness, fierceness,
nor color to those of Africa. They have bears in great abundance, except on
the North parts. They have store of dear, bores, foxes, and tygres, which (as
in Congo) are more cruel to the Naturalls then to the Spaniards. These beasts
were not found in the Islands, but in the Continent; and yet now in those
Islands, kine are multiplied and grown wild, without other owner then such as
first can kill them: Acost.libr.^.c.21. and l 4 c.34
the dogs likewise march by troops, and endamage the cattle no less then
wolves. The lions are gray, and use to clime trees: the Indians hunt and kill
them From Hispaniola were shipped Anno 1587. 35444 hide., and from new Spain
64350.
. The bears and tigres are like those in other parts but not so many. Apes and
Monkies they have of many kinds and those admirably pleasing in their apish
tricks and imitations, seeming to proceed from Reason. A soldier leuelling at
one of them to shoot him, the sily beast died not unrevenged, but hurling a
stone as the other aimed at him, deprived the soldier of his eye, and lost his
own life. They have monkies with long beards. Acosta Lib.4.ca.39. See Car.
Clus. de exot. and Ouied.genesis histor, and summer. G^sn.de Quadr.
tells of one monky that would go to the Taucrne at his masters sending, and
carrying the pot in one hand, and money in the other, would not by any means
depart with his money, till he had his pot filled with wine: and returning home,
would pelt the boys with stones, and yet have care to carry his wine home safe
to his master, neither touching it himself til some were given him, nor
suffering other. Sheep have much increased, and by good husbandry, in that
plenty of pasture, would be a great commodity: but in the Islands the wild dogs
destroy them: and therefore they that kill these dogs, are rewarded for it, as
they which kill wolves in Spain. The dogs P. Mart.de Insulis.
which the Indians had before, were snowted like foxes; they fatted them to
eat, and kept them also for pleasure: but they could not bark: Such dogs
(we have showed) are in Congo. Their stagges Ouied.summar.22.
and dear in the south parts of America, have no horns. They have store of
conies. The Armadilla is an admirable creature, of which there be diverse kinds:
they resemble a* barded horse, seeming to be armed all over, and that as if it
were rather by artificial plates, opening and shutting, then natural scales:
it digges up the earth as couics and moules.

The hogs Cataphractus equus.
of the Indies have their nauill upon the ridge of their backs. They go in
herds together, and assail men, having sharp talons, like rasors, and hunt
their hunters up the ^ops of trees, whence they easily kill these enraged
Sainos (so they call them) biting the tree for anger. The Dantes resemble small
kine, and are defended by the hardness of their hides. The Vicugne somewhat
resembles a goat, but is greater: they sheare them, and of their fleeces make
rugges and couerings, and stufies. In the stomach and belly of this beast is
found the Bezaar-stone^ sometimes one alone, sometimes, two, three, or four:
the color of which is black, or gray, or green, or otherwise: it is
accounted sovereign against poisons and venomous diseases. It is found in
diue^s sorts of beasts but all chew the cud, and commonly feed upon the snow
and rocks. The Indian sheep they call Lama, it is a beast of great profit, not
only for food and raiment, but also for carriage of burdens: they are bigger
then sheep, and less then calves: they will bear 150.li.weight. In some
places they call them Amidas, and use them to greater burdens. Hulderike
Schmidel Hul. Schmidel.ca.44. Anno Do.1548.
affirms, that he living in the parts about the river of Plate, being hurt on
his leg, rode 40 leagues upon one of them. They will grow resty, and will lie
down with their burden, no stripes nor death able to assuage their mood; only
good words, and fair dealing, with gentle entreaty, sometimes diverse hours
together, can prevail.

Of towles they have many kinds which we have, as partriges, turtles, pigeons,
stockdoues, quails, salcons, herons, eagles: and a world of Parrots, which in
some places flee by flocks, as pigeons. There are also Estriges. Hens they had
before the Spaniards arrived. They have other kinds peculiar: The Tomin^^^ Aug

times doubted (says Acosta) seeing them fly, whether they were Bees or
Butter-flies; but in truth they are birds. Theuet And.Thevet. ca.41. Lerius

and Lerius call it Gonambuch, or Govanbuch. They affirm that it yields
nothing in sweetness of Note to the Nightingale, and yet is not bigger then a
Beetle or Drone-bee: One would say, Voxes, praetereanihil: but so could not any
truly say, for even otherwise is it almost miraculous: Nature making this

Jesuits in Brasill, affirms, as Clusius Car.Clus.Exot.libr.5.
testifies, that the Brasilians called it Ourissia, which signifies the
Sun-beame, and that it was procreated of a fly; and that he had seen one,
partly a bird, and partly a fly: first colored black, then ash-colored,
then rosecoloured, then red: and lastly, the head set against the Sun, to
resemble all colors, in most admired variety. It flies so swift (says Ouiedo
summar. ca.48.
Ouiedo) that the wings cannot be seen. It has a nest proportionable. I have
seen (says he) one of those birds, together with her nest, put into the
scales, wherein they use to weigh gold, and both weighed but two tomin^, that
is, 24 grains. Happly it is therefore call. Tomineios, as weighing one Tomin.

deaw, and the juice of herbs, but sits not on the rose. The feathers,
specially of the neck and breasts, are in great request for those
feather-pictures, or portraitures, which the Indians make cunningly and
artificially with these natural feathers, placing the same in place and
proportion, beyond all admiration: The Indian Battes should not flee your
light, and are for their raritie worthy consideration, but that we have before
spoken somewhat of them.

They have Acost.l.4.c.17
birds called Condores, of exceeding greatness and force, that will open a
sheep, and a whole calfe, and eat the same. They have abundance of birds, in
beauty of their feathers far surpassing all in Europe, wherewith the
skillful Indians will perfectly represent in feathers, whatsoever they see
drawn with the Pensill. A figure of Saint Francis, made of feathers, was
presented to Pope Sixtus Quintus, whose eye could not discern them to be
natural colors, but thought them pencill-worke, til he made trial with his
fingers. The Indians used them for the ornaments of their Kings and Temples.
Some birds there are of rich commodity, only by their dung. In some Islands
joining to Peru, the mountains are all white, like snow, which is nothing but
heaps of dung of certain Sea-fowle which frequent those places. It rises
many else, yea many lances in height, and is fetched thence in boats, to
hearten the earth, which hereby is exceeding fertile.

Mangle is the name of a tree, which multiplieth it self into a wood (as
before we have observed of it) the branches descending and taking root in the
earth. The Plane tree of India has leaves sufficient to cover a man from the
foot to the head: but these, the Coco, and other Indian trees, are in the East
Indies also, and there we have mentioned them. Caecaeo is a fruit little less
their Almonds, which the Indians use for money, and make thereof a drink,
holden amongst them in high regard. They have a kind of Apples Th. Turner.
called Ananas, exceeding pleasant in color and taste, and very wholesome,
which yet have force to eat iron, like aqua fortis. The Acosta libr. 4.ca.24.
Mamayes, Guayaues and Paltos be the Indian Peaches, Apples, and Pears. But
it would be a weary wilderness to the Reader, to bring him into such an
Indian Orchard, where he might read of such variety of Fruits, but (like
Tantalus) can taste none: or to present you with a garden of their trees, which
bear flowers without other fruit, as the Floripondio, which all the year long
bears flowers, sweet, like a Lilly, but greater: the Volosuch^l, which
bears a flower like to the form of the heart, and others, which I omit: The
flower of the Sun is now no longer the Marigold of Peru, but grows in many
places with us in England. The flower of the Grandille they say (if they say
truly) has the marks of the Passion, Nails, Pillar, Whippes, Thorns, Wounds,
exceeding stigmaticall Francis.

For their Seeds and Grains, Mays is principal, of which they make their
bread, which our English ground brings forth, but hardly will ripen: it grows,
as it were, on a reed, and multiplieth beyond comparison; they gather three
hundred measures for one. It yields more blood, but more gross, then our
wheat. They make drink thereof also, wherewith they will be exceedingly
drunk. They first sleep, and after boil it to that end. In some places they
first cause it to be champed with Maids, in some places with old women, and
then make a Leaven thereof, which they boil, and make this inebriating drink.
The Canes and Leaves serve for their Moles to eat. They boil and drink it
also for pain in the back. The buds of Mays serve in fleed of butter and oil.

In some parts they make bread of a great root called Yuca, which they name
Cacavi. They first cut and strain it in a Press, for the juice is deadly
poison: the Cakes dried are sleeped in water before they can eat them. Another
kind there is of this Yuca or Iucca, the juice whereof is not poison. It will
keep long, like biscuit. They use this bread most in Hispaniola, Cuba, and
Iamaica, where wheat and Mays will not grow, but so unequally, that at one
inflant, some is in the grass, other in the grain. They use in some places
another root called Papas, like to grownd Nuttes, for bread, which they call
Chuno. Of other their roots and fruits I am loath to write, lest I weary the
Reader with tedious officiousness. Spices grow not there naturally: Ginger
thriueth well, brought and planted by the Spaniards. They have a good kind of
balm, though not the same which grew in Palestina. Of their Amber, Oiles,
Gummes, and Drugges I lift not to relate further. Out of Spain they have
carried great variety of Plants, herein America exceeding Spain, that it
receives and fructifieth in all Spanish Spanish frui^s thrive well in one
place or other of the Indies.
Plants that are brought thither, whereas the Indian thrive not in Spain: as
Vines, Olives, Mulberies, Figs, Almonds, Limons, Quinces, and such like. And,
to end this Chapter with a comparison of our World with this of America; Our
advantages and preferments are many. Botero Rel. part. prima li.4.
Our Heaven has more Stars, and greater, as Acosta by his own sight has
observed, challenging those Authors, which have written otherwise, of fabling.
Our Heaven has the North star within three degrees, and a third of the Pole:
their Crosier or four stars set a-crosse, which they observe for the
Antartike, is thirty degrees off. The Sun communicates his partial presence
seven days longer to our Tropike, then to that of Capricorn.

The want of the Sun and Stars is one cause of greater cold in those parts
then in these. Our Earth exceedes theirs for the situation, extending it self
more between East and West (fittest for humane life) whereas theirs trends
most toward the two Poles. Our Sea is more favorable, in more Gulfes and
Bays, especially such The Baltike, Persian, Arabian, Caspian seas, etc.
as go far within Land, besides the Mid-land Sea, equally communicating her
self to Asia, Africa, and Europa. This conuenience of Traffic America
wants. Our Beasts, wild and tame, are far the more noble, as the former
Discourse shows. For what have they to oppose to our Elephants, Rhinocerotes,
Camels, Horses, Kine, etc? Neither were the natural fruits of America
comparable to those of our World. Whence are their Spices, and best Fruits, but
from hence, by transportation, or transplantation? As for Arts, States,
Literature, Divine and Humane, multitudes of Cities, Laws, and other
Excellencies, our World enjoys still the privilege of the Firstborne.
America is a younger brother, and has in these things almost no inheritance at
all, till it bought somewhat hereof of the Spaniards, with the price of her
Freedom. On the other side, for temperature of Air, generally America is
far before Africa, in the same height. For greatness of Rivers, Plata and
Maragnon exceed our World. Whether Africa or America exceed in Gold, it is a
question: In Silver, Potozi seems to have surmounted any one Mine of the
World, besides those of new Spain, and other parts, howsoever Boterus doubts.
Yet Exitus acta probat. And now America excells, because, besides her own
store, she is so plentifully furnished with all sorts of living and growing
creatures from hence, as even now was showed.

the other Southern, or Peruana. This trendeth betwixt the Darien and Magellan

it is not yet fully discovered, whether it joins somewhere to the Continent
of Asia, or whether Groenland, and some other parts, accounted Islands, join
with it. These were discovered before the days of Columbus, and yet remain
almost covered in obscurity, and were therefore justly termed Discourse of

Meta Incognita, by Great Elizabeth, the best known and most renowned Lady of
the World. The first knowledge that has come to us of those parts, was by
Nicholas and Antonie Zeni, two brethren, Venetians. Happy Italy, that first,
in this last Age of the World, have discovered the great Discouerers of the
World, to whom we owe our M. Paulus, Odoricus, Vert^mannus, for the East;
Columbus, Vespucius, Cabot, for the West; these noble Zeni for the North: and
the first encompassing the Worlds wide compass, unto Pigafetta's Discourse,
companion of Magellan in his journey: that I speak not of the pains of
Russelli, Ramusius, Boterus, and a world of Italian Authors, that (I think
more then any other Language) have by their historical labors discovered the
World to it self. Unhappy Italy, that still have beaten the bush, for others
to catch the Bird, and have inherited nothing in these Eastern and Western
Worlds, excepting thy Catholic claim, whereby the Catholic and Spanish Sword

nor the Keys of Peter; for both these were 2.Cor.4.
spiritual. But to return to our Venetians. The discoueries of M. Nic. and
Ant. Zeni gathered out of their letters by Francisco Marcolino. They are
related by M. Hakluyt in his 3. vol part.121.
In the year 1380 Master Nicolo Zeno being wealthy, and of a haughty spirit,
desiring to see the fashions of the World, built and furnished a Ship at his
own charges, and passing the Straits of Gibraltar, held on his course
Northwards, with intent to see England and Flanders. But a violent Tempest
assayling him at Sea, he was carried he knew not whither, till at last his
Ship was cast away upon the Isle of Frisland; where the men and most part of
the goods were saved. In vain seems that delivery, that delivers up
presently to another Executioner. The Ilanders, like Neptunes hungry grooms,
or base and black guard, set upon the men whom the Seas had spared: but here
also they found a second escape, by means of a Prince named Zichmui, Prince of
that and many Islands thereabouts: who being near hand with his Army, came at
the outcry, and chasing away the people, took them into protection.

This Zichmui had the year before given the overthrow to the King of Norway,
and was a great aduenturer in feats of Arms. He spoke to them in Latin; and
placed them in his Navy, wherewith he won diverse Islands. Nicole behaved
himself so well, both in saving the Fleet by his Sea-skill, and in conquest of
the Islands by his valor, that Zichmui made him Knight, and Captain of his
Navy.

After diverse notable Exploits, Nicolo armed three Barks, with which he
arrived in Engroneland: where he found a Monastery of Friars, of the Preachers
Order, and a Church dedicated to Saint Thomas, hard by a Hill, that casts out
fire like Vessvius and Aetna. There is a Fountain of hot water, with which
they heat the Church of the Monastery, and the Friars chambers. It comes
also into the Kitchen so boiling hot, that they use no other fire to dress
their meat; and putting their Bread into Brass Pots without any water, it does
bake as it were in an hot Oven. They have also small Gardens, which are
covered over in the Winter time, and being watered with this water, are
defended from the violence of the Frost and Cold, and bring forth Flowers in
their due seasons. The common people astonished with these strange effects,
conceive highly of those Friars, and bring them presents of Flesh and other
things.

They with this Water, in the extremity of the Cold, heat their Chambers,
which also (as the other buildings of the Monastery) are framed of those
burning stones, which the mouth of the Hill casts forth. They cast water on
some of them, whereby they are dissolved, and become excellent white Lime, and
so tough, that being contrived in building, it lasts for ever. The rest,
after the fire is out, serve in stead of stones to make Walls and Vaults, and
will not dissolve, or break, except with some iron tool.

Their Winter lasts nine months: and yet there is a fair Haven, where this
water falls into the Sea, not frozen: by means whereof there is great resort
of wild Foul and Fish, which they take in infinite multitudes. The Fishers
Boats are made like to a Weauers Shuttle, of the skins of Fishes, fashioned
with the bones of the same Fishes, and being sowed together with many doubles,
they are so strong, that in foul weather they will shut themselves within the
same, not fearing the force either of Sea, or Wind. Neither can the
hard-hearted Rocks break these yielding Vessels. They have also (as it were)
a Sleeue in the bottom thereof, by which, with a subtle devise, they convey
the water forth, that soaketh into them. The most of these Friars spoke the
Latin Tongue.

A little after this, Nicole returned, and died in Frisland, whither his
brother Antonio had before resorted to him, and now succeeded both in his goods
and honor; whom Zichmni employed in the Expedition for Estotiland: which
happened upon this occasion. Six and twenty years before, four Fisher-Boates
were apprehended at Sea by a mighty and tedious storm; wherewith, after many
days, they were brought to Estotiland, above a thousand miles West from
Frisland: upon which, one of the Boats was cast away, and six men that were in
it, were taken and brought to a populous City; where, one that spoke Latin,
and had been cast by chance upon that Island, in the name of the King asked
them what countrymen they were; and understanding their case, he acquainted
the King therewith. They dwelt there five years, and found it to be an Island
very rich, being little less then Iseland, but far more fruitful. One of
them said saw Latin Books in the Kings Library, which they at this present
do not understand. They have a peculiar Language, and Letters, or Characters,
to themselves. They have Mines of Gold; and other Mettalls, and have Trade with
Engroneland. They sow Corn, and make Beer and Ale. They build Barks (but
know not the use of the Compass) and have many Cities and Castles. The King
sent these Fishermen with twelve Barks Southwards, to a Country which they
call Drogio: in which Voyage escaping dreadful Tempests at Sea, they
encountered with Canniballs at Land, which devoured many of them. These Fishers
showing them the manner of taking Fish with Nets, escaped: and for the presents
which they made of their Fish to the chief men of the Country, were beloved
and honored. One of these (more expert, it seems, then the rest) was holden
in such account, that a great Lord made war with their Lord to obtain him:
and so prevailed, that he and his company were sent unto him. And in this
order was he sent to five and twenty Lords, which had warred one with another
to get him, in thirteen years space: whereby he came to know almost all those
parts; which, he said, was a great Country, and (as it were) a New World. The
people are all rude, and void of goodness: they go naked, neither have they
wit to cover their bodies with the Beasts skins, which they take in Hunting,
from the vehement cold. They are fierce, and eat their enemies, having diverse
Laws and Governors. Their living is by Hunting.

Further to the Southwest, they are more civil, and have a more temperate
Air: They have Cities and Temples dedicated to Idols, where they sacrifice
men, and after eat them; and have also some use of Gold and Silver.

He fled away secretly, and conueying himself from one Lord to another, came
at length to Drogio, where he dwelt three years. After this time finding
there certain Boats of Estotiland, he went thither with them: and growing
there very rich, furnished a Bark of his own, and returned into Frisland;
where he made report unto his Lord of that wealthy Country. Zichumi prepared
to send thither: but three days before they set forth, this Fisherman died.
Yet taking some of the Mariners which came with him, in his stead, they
prosecuted the Voyage, and encountered, after many days, an Island; where tenene
men, of diverse Languages, were brought unto them, of which they could
understand none, but one of Iseland. He told them, That the Island was called
Icaria, and the Kings thereof called Icari, descended of the ancient pedigree
of Dedalus, King of Scots: who conquering that Island, left his son there for
King, and left them those Laws, which to that present they retained. And, that
they might keep their Laws inuiolate, they would receive no stranger. Only
they were contented to receive one of our men, in regard of the Language, as
they had done those ten Interpreters.

Zichumi sailing hence, in four days descried Land, where they found
abundance of Foul, and Birds eggs, for their refreshing. The Haven they
called Cape Trin. There was a Hill, which burning, cast out smoke: where was a
Spring, from which issued a certain water like Pitch, which ran into the
Sea. The people of small stature, wild, and fearful, hid themselves in
Caves. Zichumi built there a City, and determining to inhabit, sent Antonio
back again, with the most of his people, to Frisland.

This History I have thus inserted at large, which perhaps, not without cause
in some things, may seem fabulous; not in the Zeni, which thus writ, but in
the relations which they received from others. Howsoever, the best Geographers

are beholden to these brethren, for that little knowledge they have of these
parts; of which, none before had written: nor since have there been any great
inland Discoueries.

Somewhat since there has been discovered by Gaspar Cortereale, a Portugal;
Stephen Gomes, a Spaniard, and Sebastian Cabot: and more by later Pilots, of
our Nation; but little of the disposition of the Inland people. Yea, it is
thought to be all broken Islands, and not inhabited, but at certain seasons
frequented by some Savages, which come thither to fish. Such as we can, in due
order we here bestow.

to the threescore and seventh degree and a half of Northerly latitude, minding

Clement Adams, relates, That John Cabot, a Venetian, and his son Sebastian,
set out from Bristoll, discovering the Land, called it Prima Vista, and the
Island before it, S. John's. The inhabitants wear Beasts skins. There were
white Bears, and Stagges far greater then ours. There were plenty of
Seals, and Soles above a yard long. He named (says Peter P. M^rt Dec.3.l.6.
Martyr) certain Islands Codfish.
Baccalaos, of the store of those fish, which the inhabitants called by that
name, which with their multitudes sometimes stayed his Ships. The Bears
caught these Fish with their claws, and drew them to land, and eat them. In

H.7. ( William Purchase being then Mayor of London) were brought unto the King
three men, taken in the Newfound Island: these were clothe^ in Beasts skins,
and did eat raw flesh. But Cabot discovered all along the Coast to that which
since is called Florida; and returning, found great preparations for Wars in
Scotland, by reason whereof, no more consideration was had to this Voyage.
Whereupon he went into Spain; and being entertained by the King and Queen,
was sent to discover the Coasts of Brasil, and sailed up into the River of
Plate more then six score Leagues. He was made Pilot Mayor of Spain: and after
that, Anno 1549, was constituted Graund Pilot of England By King Edward the
sixth, with the yearly Pension of an hundred threescore and six pounds,
thirteen shillings, four pence: Where, in the year 1553, he was chief

Gaspar Corteregalis, a Portugal, minding new Discoueries, set forth a Ship
at his own charge from Lisbone; and sailing far North, at last came to a
Land, which for the pleasantness thereof, he called Green. The men, as he
reported, were barbarous, browne-coloured, very swift, good Archers, clothed in
Beasts skins. They live in Caves, or base Cottages, without any Religion, but
observe Soothsayings. They used Marriages, and were very jealous. Returning
into Portugal, he sailed thitherward again, Anno 1501. But what became of
him, none can tell. His brother Michael Corteregalis the next year set forth
two Ships to make search for his brother, but he also was lost. The King
Emanuel grieved herewith, sent to enquire of them, but all in vain. Their
brother Vasco would have put himself on this adventure, but the King would not
suffer him. The name Green upon this occasion was left, and the Land was
called Corterealis, or Laborador, extends from 60. degrees to the River of S.

This Gomes having been with Magellan a few years before, in his Discovery
of the South Sea, enlarged with hopes of new Straits, in the year 1525 set
forth to search this Northerly passage. But finding nothing to his expectation,
he laded his Ship with slaves, and returned. Gaspar E^s, l.2.c.25 Hist.Ind.
. At his return, one that knew his intent, was for the Moluccas by that way,
enquiring what he had brought home, was told Esclavos, that is, Slaves. He,
fore-stalled with his own imagination, had thought it was said Clavos, and so
posted to the Court to carry first news of this Spicie Discovery, looking
for a great reward: but the truth being known, caused hereat great laughter.

had sight of Frisland, but could not get on shore for the abundance of Ice,
which was also accompanied with an extreme Fogge, as double guard to that Island
(uncertain whether to fortify, or to imprison them.) The twentieth of July he
had sight of an high Land, which he named Queens Foreland, and opposite
thereto Halls Isle, in 62. degrees, 50. min.
Elizabeth's Foreland. Here was he much troubled with Ice: but sailing more
Northerly, descried another Foreland, with a great Gutte, Bay, or Passage,
which he entered, calling it Frobishers Straits, supposing it to be the division
of Asia and America. Having entered threescore Leagues, he went on shore, and
was encountered with mighty Dear, which ran at him, with danger of his life.
Here had he sight of the Savages, which rowed to his Ship in Boats of Seals
skins, with a Keele of Wood within them, like a Spanish Shallop, save only
they be flat in the bottoms, and sharp at both ends. They eat raw Flesh and
Fish, or rather deuo^ red the same ^^^ had long black hair, broad faces, flat
noses, tawnie of color, or like an Olive (which neither Sun or Wind, but
Nature it self, imprinted on them, as appeared by their infants; and seems
to be the general Liuerie of America.) Their Apparel was Seals skins:
their women were painted or marked down the cheeks and about the eyes with
blew streekes. These Savages intercepted five of our men, and the Boat: Ours
also took one of theirs, which they brought into England, where they arrived
the second of October, Gaspar. Ens, l.2.Hist. Ind. Occid. c. 26. affirms,
that one John Scolve a Polonian, this year 1576 sailed beyond Frisland and
Groc^land, and thence, to Estorland and Labrador.
1576. He had taken possession of the Country in right of the Queen, and
commanded his company to bring every one somewhat, in witness of the same.
One brought a piece of black Stone, like Sea-coale, which was found to hold
Gold in good quantity. Whereupon a second Voyage was made the next year 1577,
to bring Ore. And coming to those Straits in July, found them in manner shut
up with a long Mure of Ice, which sometime endangered their Ships, especially
on the nineteenth of that month. They found a great dead Fish, round like a
Porepis, twelve foot long, having Such a horn was brought home two... years
since, found on shore in a desolate Island; and such an one was taken up A.
1588. in the coast of Norfolk, and sold by an ignorant woman for 18. pence,
which proved effectual against poisons, as I was told by M. ^ob. Salmon of
Leegh, who had a piece of it.
a Horn of two yards, lacking two inches, growing out of the Snout, wreathed
and straight, like a Wax Taper, and might be thought to be a Sea-Vnicorne. It
was broken in the top, wherein some of the Sailors said they put Spiders,
which presently died. It was reserved as Jewel by the Queens commandment,
in her Wardrobe of Robes. They went on shore, and had some encounter with the
inhabitants, which were of so fierce and terrible resolution, that finding
themselves wounded, they leapt off the Rocks into the Sea, rather then they
would fall into the hands of the English. The rest fled. One woman, with her
child, they took and brought away. They had taken another of the Savages
before. This Savage had before, in the Ship, seen the Picture of his
Countreyman, taken the year before, thought him to be alive, and began to be
offended, that he would not answer him; with wonder thinking, that our men
could make men live and die at their pleasure. But strange were the gestures
and behavior of this man and the woman, when they were brought together; which
were put into the same Cabin, and yet gave such apparent signs of
shamefastness and chastity, ^ be a shame to Christians to come so far short
of them.

Where they could have any Trade with the Savages their manner of ^ was, to lay
down somewhat of theirs, and go then way, expecting, that ^ men should lay
down somewhat in lieu thereof; and if they like of their Mart, they come
again, and take it: otherwise, they take away their own, and depart. They
made signs, that their Catchoe or King, was a man of higher stature then any
of ours, and that he was carried upon men's shoulders ^^^ They could not learn
what became of the five men they lost the year before: only they found some
of their apparel; which made them think they were eaten. They laded
themselves with Ore, and so returned. And with fifteen sail the next year
1578, a third Voyage for discovery was made by the said Captain and General.

, which was named by them West England, where they espied certain Tents and
People like those of Meta, Incognita. The people fled, and they found in
their Tents a Box of small Nails, read Herrings, and Boords of Firre-tree
well cut, with other things artificially wrought: whereby it appears, that
they are workmen themselves, or have tra^le with others. Some of them were of
opinion, That this was firm Land with Meta Incognita, or with Gronland;
whereunto the multitude of Islands of Ice, between that and Me^a Incognita
induced them. In departing from hence, the Salamander (one of their Ships)
being under both her Courses and Bonets, happened to strike on a great Whale
with her full stem, with such a blow, that the Ship stood still, and
neither stirred forward nor backwards. The Whale thereat made a great and
hideous noise, and casting up his body and tail, presently sanke under water.
Within two days they found a Whale dead, which they supposed was this which
the Salamander had stricken.

The second of July they entered in with the Straits, the entrance whereof was
barred with Mountains of Ice, wherewith Bark Dennis was sunk, to the
hinderance of their proiects. For in it was drowned part of a house, which they
had intended to erect there for habitation. The men were saved. The other
Ships were in very great danger, the Seas mustering Armies of ycie soldiers
to oppress them, using other natural stratagemes of Fogges and Snowes to
further these cruel designs.

These Icie Islands seem to have been congealed in the Winter further North,
in some Bays, It seems they are of fresh waters, because the ice is fresh:
and the Sun melting the tops, causes rills of fresh water to run down,
which meeting together, make a pretty stream.
or Rivers, and with the Summers Sun being loosed, and broken out of their
natural prisons, offer themselves to all outrages, whereto the swift Currents
and cold Winds will conduct them. Strange it is to see their greatness, some
not less then half a mile about, and fourscore fathomes above water, besides
the unknown depth beneath: strange the multitude; strange the deformed shapes:
if this be not more strange, that they sometimes faue with killing, and suffer
men to moore their Anchors on them, and to get upon them to work against them,
for the safeguard of their Ships: That bloody enemies should entertain them
with disports, to walk, leap, shout, forty miles from any Land, without any
Vessel under them (according to M. Bests Riddle) and a hundred and ten miles
from Land should present them with running streams of fresh Waters, able to
drive a Myll. The Flood was there nine hours, the Ebb but three. A strong
Current ran Westwards. The people resemble much the Tartars, or rather the
Samoeds, in Apparel, and manner of living. It is colder here in 62. then 9.
or 10. degrees more Northerly toward the North-east, which (it seems) comes
to pass by the Winds, East, and North-east, which from the Ice bring so
intolerable a cold. The people are excellent Archers; a thing general
throughout America. Besides Seals skins, they use the skins of Dear,
Bears, Foxes, and Hares, for Apparel, and the cases also of Fowls sowed
together. They wear in Summer the hayrie fide outward; in Winter, inward; or
else go naked. They shoot at the Fish with their darts. They kindle fire with
rubbing one stick against another. They use great black Dogs, like Wolves,
to draw their Sleds, and a less kind to eat. They have very thin beards.
In the best of Summer they have Hail and Snow (sometimes a foot deep, which
freezeth as it falls) and the ground frozen three fathom deep. They have
great store of Foul, whereof our men killed in one day fifteen hundred. They
have thicker skins, and are thicker of Down and Feathers then with us, and
therefore must be flayed. The Sun was not absent above three hours and a
half; all which space it was very light, so that they might see to write and
read.

Hence is it, that those parts near (and perhaps under) the Pole are
habitable: the continuance of the Suns presence in their Summer, heating and
warming with lively cherishment all Creatures: and in the Winter, by his
oblique motion, leaving so long a twilight; and the increased light The Moon

of the Moon, the Suns great and diligent Lieu-tenant, the brightness of
the Stars and whiteness of the snow, not suffering them to be quite forlorn
in darkness. The beasts, fowls, and fishes, which these men kill, are their
houses, bedding, meat, drink, hose, thread, shoes, apparel, and sails, and
boats, and almost all their riches. Besides their eating all things raw, they
will eat grass and shrubbes, like our kine: and morsels of Ice, to satisfy
thirst. They have no hurtful creeping things, but Spiders; and a kind of Gnat
is there very troublesome. Timber they have none growing, but as the
undermining water does supplant and bring them from other places. They are
great Inchanters. When their heads ache, they tie a great stone with a string
into a stick, and with certain words effect, that the stone with all a man's
force will not be lifted up, and sometimes seems as light as a feather; hoping
thereby to have help. They made signs, lying groueling with their faces upon
the ground, making a noise downward, that they worship the Devil under them.
There is no flesh or fish which they find dead (smell it never so filthily)
but they will eat it, without any other dressing. Their Dear have skins like
Asses, and feet large, like Oxen, which were measured seven or eight inches in
breadth. There are no Rivers or running Springs, but such as the Sun causes
to come of snow. Sometimes they will perboile their meat a little, in kettles
made of beasts skins, with the blood and water which they drink; and lick the
bloody knife with their tongues: This licking is the medicine also for their
wounds. They seem to have traffic with other Nations: from whom they have a
small quantity of Iron. Their fire they make of Heath and Moss. In their
leather boats they row with one oar faster, then we can in our boats with all
our oars.

Master John Dauis The voyage of Master Dauis, written by John James. Hak.to.3
p.100.
in the year 1585. made his first voyage for this North-west Discovery, and in
threescore and four degrees, and fifteen minutes, they came on shore on an
Island, where they had sight of the Savages, which seemed to worship the Sun.
For pointing up to the Sun with their hands, they would strike their breasts
hard with their hands: which being answered with like action of the English,
was taken for a confirmed league, and they became very familiar. They first
leaped and danced with a kind of Timbrel, which they struck with a stick.
Their apparel was of beasts and birds skins, buskins, hose, gloves, etc.
Some leather they had which was dressed like the glouers leather. The sixth of
August they discovered land in 66.40. They killed white Bears, one of whose
forefeet were fourteen inches broad, so fat, that they were forced to cast it
away. It seemed they fed on the grass, by their dung, which was like to
horse-dung. They heard dogs howl on the shore, which were tame: They killed
one with a collar about his neck: he had a bone in his pisle; these it seemed
were used to the sled, for they found two sleds.

The next year he made his second voyage, wherein he found the savage people
tractable. They are great Idolaters, and Witches. They have many Images which
they wear about them, and in their boats. They found a grave, wherein were
many buried, covered with Seals skins, and a Cross laid over them. One of
them made a fire of turfes, kindled with the motion of a stick in a piece of a
board; which had a hole half through, into which he put many things, with
diverse words and strange gestures: our men supposed it to be a sacrifice. They
would have had one of the English to stand in the smoke, which themselves were
bidden to do, and would not by any means; whereupon one of them was thrust in,
and the fire put out by our men. They are very theeuish. They catraw fish,
grass and ice: and drink salt water. Here they saw a whirle-winde take up
the water in great quantity, furiously mounting it up into the air, three
hours together with little intermission. They found in 63. degrees. 8. min. a
strange quantity of ice in one entire mass, so big, that they knew not the
limits thereof, very high, in form of land, with bays and capes like
high-cliffe land; they sent their Pinnesse to discover it, which returned with
information, that it was only ice. This was the seventeenth of July, 1586. and
they coasted it till the thirtieth of July. In 66. degrees. 33. min. they found it
very hot, and were much troubled with a stinging Fly, called Muskito. All
the Lands they saw seemed to be broken, and Islands; which they coasted
Southwards, till they were in four and fifty and a half, and there found
hope of a passage. In the same voyage Henry Morgan.
he had sent the Sunshine from him in 60. degr. which went to Iseland, and on
the seventh of July had sight of Gronland, and were hindered from harbor by
the ice. They coasted it till the last of July. Their houses near the Seaside
were made with pieces of wood, crossed over with poles, and covered with earth.
Our men played at football with them of the Island.

The third voyage was performed the next year, 1587. wherein Master John Dauis
in his Hydrographical description.
Dauis discovered to the 73. degree, finding the Sea all open, and forty
leagues between land and land, having Groenland (which for the loathsome view
of the shore covered with snow, without wood, earth, or grass to be seen, and
the irksome noise of the ice he called Desolation) on the East, and America on
the West. The Spanish Fleet, and the untimely death of Master Secretary
Walsingham, (the Epitome and summary of Humane worthiness) hindered the
prosecution of these intended Discoueries.

Henry Hudson has since discovered above nine degrees nearer the Pole, and
after diverse voyages, with the loss of himself, by means of his mutinous and
(as is supposed) murtherous companions, which returned the last year, has
gained more hope of this discovery of the South Sea, by a Northerly passage,
then ever before.

Hesselius Hesselius Gerardus.
Gerardus has (I know not by what instructions) set forth this voyage, and
discovery of Hudson, now this last Mart at Amsterdam, together with a Plat or
Hydrographicall Map of the same: affirming that he followed the way which
Captain Winwood had before searched, by Lumleyes Inlet, in 61. degr. and so
passed through the strait to 50. and 51. where he wintered, and once saw a man
girded with a Crisse, or Dagger of Mexico, or Iapon, whereby he guessed that
he was not far thence. After they had stayed here eight months, they set
sail Northwards, and found an open Sea. His Mariners perceiving that he
intended further search for discovery, mutinying for victual, put him with
some others into the boat, and there left him, and returned for England.

And now are men employed in hope of perfecting that, to the glory of our
Nation, which undaunted spirits amongstvs with such cost and danger have
attempted. Resolute, gallant, glorious attempts, which thus seek to tame
Nature, where she is most unbridled, in those Northeasterly, Northwesterly,
and Northerly borders (where she shows her self a As Borderers are most

GOD over all blessed for ever, has imposed on all sensible Creatures to the
Nature of man; resembling in one Image and abridgement, both GOD and the World,
consisting of a spiritual and bodily, visible and invisible ^bsistence. How
shall I admire your valor and courage, ye Marine Worthies, beyond all names
of worthiness, that neither dread so long, either presence or absence of the
Sun, nor those foggie mists, tempestuous winds, cold blasts, snowes and
hail in the air: nor the unequal Seas, which might amaze the hearer, and
amate the beholder, where the Tritons and Neptunes self would quake with
chilling fear, to behold such monstrous Icie Islands, renting themselves with
terror of their own massines, and disdaining otherwise, both the Seas
soueraignety, and the Suns hottest violence, mustering themselves in those
watery plains, where they hold a continual civil war, and rushing one upon
another, make winds and waves give back, seeming to rent the ears of others,
while they rent themselves with crashing and splitting their congealed armours:
nor the rigid ragged face of the broken lands, sometimes towering themselves in
a lofty height, to see if they can find refuge from those snowes and colds
that continually beat them, sometimes hiding themselves under some hollow hills
or cliffes, sometimes sinking and shrinking into valleys, looking pale with
snowes, and falling in frozen and dead swounes: These thing agree with the
relations of those parts, which tell of Earthquakes, breaking of cliffes, etc.
sometimes breaking their necks into the Sea, rather embracing the waters,

whom all names of greatness are little, and less then nothing, let me in
silence admire and worship thy greatness, that in this little heart of man

samplar of this model, can of thine own self, becoming all in all unto
us, fill and more then satisfy. Thee I beseech, to prosper in this and like

From the entrance up to Hochelaga is three hundred leagues. Many Islands are
before it, offering of their good nature to be mediators between this
haughty stream and the angry Ocean: many others all along his passage he
holds in his loving unlovely lap, washing and hugging them with his ruder
embracings. The former are usually frequented, and were first discovered by the
English, the other by the French. Of Sebastian Cabot his proceeding this way is
spoken already. Robert Thorn Rob. Thorn in Master Hakluits Voyages, To. I.

in a Treatise of his, affirms that his father, and one Master Eliot were the
Discouerers of the New-found-Lands: and exhorted K. Henry to undertake the
search of the Indies by the Pole, which he held to be Nauigable. Upon this
motion, 1527. the King sent two ships (as Hall and Master Hall, Master
Grafton.
Grafton mention in their Chronicles) one of which ships was cast away about
the North-parts of New Foundland, the other shaping her course toward Cape
Briton, and the coasts of Arambec (or as some call it Norumbega) returned home.

by famine were brought to such extremities, that many of the company were
murdered and eaten by their fellows. And those which returned were so

The North-part is inhabited, the South is desert, although fitter for
habitation. Besides the abundance of Cod, here are Herrings, Salmons,
Thornbacke, Oisters and Muskies, with Pearls, Smelts and Squids, which two
sorts come on shore in great abundance, fleeing from the devouring Cod, out of
the drying pan into the fire. It is thonght that there are Buffes, and
certain, that there are Bears and Foxes, which before your face will rob
you of your fish or flesh. Before they come at New Foundland by fifty
leagues, they pass the bank: so they call certain high grounds, as a vain
of Mountains, raising themselves under the water, about ten leagues in
breadth, extending to the South infinitely, on which is thirty fathom water,
before and after two hundred. Sir Humfrey Gilbert took possession thereof, by
virtue of her Majesty's Commission. Anno 1583. It is with-in-land a goodly
Country, naturally beautified with Roses sown with Pease, planted with
stately trees, and otherwise diuersified both for pleasure and profit. And now
the report goes, that our English Nation do there plant and fix a settled
habitation.

Near to Newfound land in 47degrees. is great killing of the Morse or Sea-oxe.

In the I Will of Ramea, one small French ship in a small time killed 500. of
them. They are great as Oxen, the hide dressed, is twice as thick as a Bulls
hide: It has two teeth like Elephants, but shorter, about a foot long, dearer
sold then Iuory, and by some reputed an Antidote, not inferior to the
Unicorns horn. The young ones are as good meat as Veale. And with the bellies
of five of the said fishes (if so we may call these Amphibia, which live both on
land and water) they make a Hogshead of train oil. Some of our English ships
have attempted this enterprise for the killing of the Morse, but not all with
like succees^e; nor with so good as is reported of Cherry Island. At Brions
Island is such abundance of Cods, that Master Charies Leigh.
Leighs company with four hooks in little more then an hour, caught two

of Margaulx or Penguins: and might have laden all their ships with them,
without any miss.
in less then half an hour. Besides them which they did eat fresh, every ship
did powder five or six barrels of them. There are an hundred fold as many
houering about, as within the Island. Some are as big as Iayes, black and white,
with beakes like unto crows: their wings are no bigger then half ones hand,
and therefore they cannot fly high, yet are they as swift near the water, as
other birds. They are very fat: these they called Aponatz, a lesler kind which
there abounds, they named Godetz: A bigger, and white, which bite like
dogs, they termed Margaulx. Although it be fourteen leagues from the maine,
yet Bears swim thither to feast with these birds. One they saw as great as a
Cow, says Cartier, and as white as a Swanne, which they did kill and eat, and
the flesh was as good as of a two-yeare-old Calfe. About the Port of Breast,
they found as many Islets, as were impossible to number, continuing a great
space.

The Island of Assumption, Siluest Wyet.
by the Savages called Natiscote^, stands in 49. degrees. The savages dwell in
houses made of fir-trees, bound together in the top, and set round like a
Doue-house. This, as before is said, is at the entry of the River into the
gulf of Saint Lawrence. The banks of this River are inhabited of people that
worship the Devil, and sometimes sacrifice to him their own blood. Botero
part I. lib. 5.
Francis the first, King of France, sent thither James Berton; and Henry his
son, Nicolas Villagnon: but the greatest riches they found, were the Diamonds
of Canada, and those of small value for their brittlenes. Thus Boterus. Jacques
Iaq. Cart. 1.
Cartier made three voyages into these parts. First in the year 1534. Then was
he gladly welcomed of the Savages, singing, dancing, and expressing other
signs of joy, as rubbing his arms with their hands, and then lifting him up
to heaven, giving all to their naked skin (though all were worse then
nothing) for the trifles he gave them. They went naked, saving their priuities
which were covered with a skin, and certain old skins they cast upon them,
Some they saw, whose heads were altogether shaven, except one bush of hair
which they offer to grow upon the top of their crown, as long as a horse
tail, and tied up with leather-strings in a knot. They have no dwelling but
their boats, which they turn vpside down, and under them lay themselves along
on the bare ground. They eat their flesh and fish almost raw, only a little
heated on the coals. The next year Captain Iaq. Car. 2.
Cartier returned, and carried back two Savages, which he before had carried
into France to learn the language. He then passed up to Hochelaga He wintered
this time in the Country.
They found Rats which lived in the water, as big as Conies, and were very good
meat. Hochelaga is a City round, compassed about with timber, with three course
of Rampires one within another, framed sharp, about two rods high. It has but
one gate, which is shut with piles and bars. There are in it about fifty
great houses, and in the midst of every one a court, in the middle whereof
they make their fire. Before they came there, they were forced to leave their
boats behind, because of certain falls, and heard that there were three more
higher up the stream, toward Sanguenay, which in his Iaq. Car. 3.
third Voyage were discovered.

Concerning the Religion in these parts of Canada, even amongst the Savages we
find some tracts and foot-prints thereof, which neither the dreadful winters
have quite frozen to death, nor these great and deep waters have wholly
drowned, but that some shadow thereof appears in these shadows of men,
howsoever wild and savage, like to them which give her entertainment. This
people believes, says Jacques Iaq. Car. 2. Cap, 10.
Cartier, in one which they call Cudruaigni, who, say they, often speaks to
them, and tele them what weather will follow, whether good or bad. Moreover,
when he is angry with them, he casts dust into their eyes. They believe that
when they die, they go into the Stars, and thence by little and little descend
down into the Horizon, even as the Stars do, after which they go into
certain green fields, full of goodly fair and precious trees, flowers and
fruits. The Frenchmen told them Cudruaigni was a devil, and acquainted them
with some mysteries of the Christian Religion, whereupon they condescended and
desired Baptism; the French excused, and promised after to bring Priests for
that purpose. They live in common together, and of such commodities as their
Country yields they are well stored. They wed two or three wives a man,
which, their husbands being dead, never marry again, but for their widows
livery wear a black weed all the days of their life, besmearing their faces
with cole-dust and grease mingled together, as thick as the back of a knife.
They have a filthy and detestable use in marrying their maidens, first putting
them (being once of lawful age to marry) in a common place, as harlots, free
for every man that will have to do with them, until such time as they find a
match. I have seen houses as full of such prostitutes, as the schools in
France are full of children. They there use much mis-rule, riot, and
wantonness.

They dig their ground with certain pieces of wood, as big as half a sword,
where they sow their Maiz. The men also do much use Tobacco. The women labor
more then the men in fishing and husbandry. They are more hardy then the
beasts, and would come to our ships stark naked, going upon snow and ice, in
which season they take great store of beasts, Stags, Bears, Marterns, Hares
and Foxes, whose flesh they eat raw, having first dried it in the Sun or
smoke, and so they do their fish. They have also Otters, Weasils, Beauers,
Badgers, Conies: foul and fish great variety: and one fish, called Adhothuis,
whose body and head is like to a Greyhound, white as snow. Their greatest
jewel is chains of Esurgny, which are shel-fishes, exceeding white, which
they take on this manner. When a captive or other man is condemned to death,
they kill him, and then cut flashes in his most fleshy parts, and hurl him
into the River Cornibots, whence after twelve hours they draw him, finding in
those cuts these Esurgny, whereof they make beads and chains. They are
excellent for stanching of blood. Thus much out of Cartier. In the year 1542.
M. Franci^ Roberual.
Monsieur Roberual was sent to inhabit those parts. He says that he built a
Fort fair and strong: the people have no certain dwelling place, but go from
place to place, as they may find best food, carrying all their goods with them.

It is more cold in that, then in other places of like height, as John Alphonse
of Xanctoigne John Alph^use of Xanctoigne. Hakluit tom. 3.
affirms, because of the greatness of the River which is fresh water, and
because the land is untilled and full of woods. We may add the cold vapors
which the Sun exhaleth in that long passage over the Ocean, the abundance of
ice that comes out of the North-seas, and the winds which blow from them,
and from the cold snowie hills in the way.

Monsieur M. Champlcin in N^^a Francia. lib. 2. cay 5.
Champlein having of late made the same voyage, discoursed with certain
Savages yet living, of whom he learned touching their Religion, that they
believe in one GOD, who has created all things: that after GOD had made all
things, he took a number of arrows, and did stick them into the ground, from
whence men and women sprung up, which have multiplied ever since. Touching the
Trinity, being asked, a Sagamos or Governor answered, The answer of a Sagamos
in cases of Religion.
There was one only GOD, one SONNI, one Mother, and the Sun, which were
four. Notwithstanding, This somewhat agrees with the Manichean and
Pythagorcan error.
that GOD was over and above all: the SON was good, and the Sun also: but
the Mother was naught and did eat them, and that the FATHER was not very good.
Being asked, if they or their ancestors had heard that GOD was come into the
world: He said that he had not seen him; but that anciently there were five
men, who traveling toward the setting of the Sun, met with GOD, who demanded
of them, whither go ye? They answered, we go to seek for our living. GOD
said, You shall find it here: But they not regarding, passed further: and
then GOD with a stone touched two of them, who were turned into stones. And he
said a gain to the three other, whither go ye? they answered, and he replied
as at first: they yet passing further, he took two staves, and touched
therewith the two foremost, and transformed them into staves. Asking the third
man whither he went, he said to seek his living: whereupon he bad him tarry,
and he did so, and GOD gave him meat, and he did eat: and after he had made
good cheer, he returned among the other Savages, and told them all this tale.
This Sagamos also told, that at another time there was a man which had store of
Tobacco, and GOD came and asked him for his pipe, which the man gave him, and
he drank much of it, and then brake the pipe. The man was offended hereat,
believe he had no more pipes, but GOD gave him one, and bad him carry it to his
Sagamos, with warning to keep it well, and then he should want nothing, nor
any of his. Since, the said Sagamos lost the pipe, and found famine and other
distress: this seems to be the cause, why they say GOD is not very good.
Being demanded what ceremony they used in praying to their God, he said that
they used no ceremony, but every one did pray in his heart, as he would. They
have among them some Savages, whom they call Pilotoua, who speak visibly to
the Devil, and he tells them what they must do, as well for war, as for
other things. And if he should command them to put any enterprise in execution,
or to kill a man, they would do it immediately. They because also that all
their dreams are true. So far Champlein.

In the year 1604. Monsieur de Monts (according to a Patent granted him the
year before, for the inhabiting of Cadia, Canada, and other parts of New
France, from the fortieth degree to the six and fortieth) rigged two ships,
and bare with those parts that trend Westward from Cape Breton, giving names to
places at pleasure, or upon occasion. One port was named Saualet of a French
Captain, who was there a fishing, and had made this his two and fortieth
Voyage hither: another was named of Rossignol, whose ship was confiscated for
trading there with the Savages (a poor preferment, to leave name to a Port by
his misery) another was named Port Moutton, and within a great Bay, they named
another Port Royal, where after they fortified. The inhabitants of these parts
were termed Souriquois. From them Westward are the people called Etechemins,
where the next port, after you are passed the River of S. John, is Saint Croix,
where they erected a Fort, and wintered. Threescore leagues West from thence is
the River Kimbekt: and from thence the Land trendeth North and South to
Malabarre. Authors place in that former extension of land betwixt East and
West, a great Town and fair River, called Norombega, by the Savages called
Agguncia. These French Discouerers utterly deny this History, affirming that
there are but Cabans here and there made with perkes, and covered with barks
of trees, or with skins: and both the River and inhabited place is called
Pomtegoet, and not Agg^^^^. And there car be no great River (as they affirm)
because the great River Canada has (like an insatiable Merchant) engrossed all
these water-commodities, so that other streams are in manner but mere pedlers.

The Armouchiquois are a traitorous and theeuish people, next vnneighboutly
neighbors to the Etechemms: they are light-footed and lime fingred, as swift
in running away with their stolen prey, as the Greyhound in pursuing it.
Monsieur du Point arrived in those parts in the year 1605. and du Mont^
removed the French habitation to Port Royal. Monsieur de Poutrincourt sailed
thither in the year 1606. and with him the Author of the book called Noua
Francia, who has written of the rites and customs of these Countries. He
says, that the Armouchiquoit are a great people, but have no adoration. They
are vicious and bloody. Both they and the Souriquois have the industry of
painting and caruing, and do make pictures of Birds, Beasts, and Men, both in
stone and wood, as well as the workmen in these parts. They, as is said,
ascribe not divine worship to any thing: but yet acknowledge some spiritual
and invisible power. I know not by what divine justice, and injustice of the
Devil, it comes to pass, that God has given some men up so far unto the
Devils tyranny, that he has banished out of their hearts the knowledge and
worship of the true God: and yet the nature of man cannot be without
apprehension of some greater, and more excellent Nature, and rather then want
all Religion, they will have a Religious-irreligious commerce with the Devil.
Yea, the more all knowledge of God is banished, the baser service do men, in
doing and suffering, yield to the Devil: as (to leave other parts to their
own places) it falls out in these Regions. The Prince and greatest Commander
of men among them, seems by this means to be the Devils Vicegerent, and by
wisardly and deuillish practices to vp-hold his own greatness. So it was with
Sagamos Memberton: if any body were sick he was sent for, he made inuocations
on the Devil, he blows upon the party grieved, makes incision, sucketh the
blood from it: (a practice used in very many Countries of the Continent and
Islands of America) if it be a wound he heals it after the same manner,
applying a round slice of Beauers stones. Some present is therefore made to
him, of Venison or skins.

If it be a question to have news of things absent, having first questioned
with his spirit, he renders his Oracle, commonly doubtful, very often false,
and sometimes true. He rendered a true Oracle of the coming of Poutrincourt to
du Pont, saying, his Devil had told him so.

When the Savages are hungry, they consult with Memberton's Oracle, and he
tells them the place whither they shall go: and if there be no game found,
the excuse is, that the beast has wandered and changed place: but very often
they find. And his makes them believe that the Devil is a God, and know none
other, although they yield him no adoration. When these Aoutmoin's (so they
call these Wisards) consult with the Devil, they fix a staff in a pit, to
which they tie a cord, and, putting their head into the pit, make inuocations
or coniurations, in a language unknown to the others that are about, and this
with beatings and howlings until they sweat with pain. When this Devil is
come, the Master Aoutmoin makes them believe that he holds him tied by his
cord, and holds fast against him, forcing him to give him an answer, before
he let him go. That done, he begins to sing something in the praises (as
it seems) of the Devil, that has discovered some game unto them, and the
other Savages that are there make answer with some concordance of music among
them. Then they dance with songs in another, not vulgar, language: after which,
they make a fire and leap over it, and put half a pole out of the top of the
Cabin, where they are with some thing tied thereto, which the Devil carries
away.

Memberton carried at his neck the mark of his profession, which was a purse,
trianglewise covered with their imbrodered work, within which there was
somewhat as big as a Nut, which he said was his Devil, called Aoutem. This
function is successiue, and by tradition they teach their eldest sons the
mystery of this iniquity. Every Sagamos signifies a King, or Ruler.
Sagamos either is, or has his Aoutmoin.

The men and women wear their black hair long, hanging loose over the
shoulder, wherein the men stick a feather, the women a bodkin. They are much
troubled with a stinging fly, for prevention where ^^ they rub themselves
with certain kinds of grease and oiles. They paint their faces with blew or
red, but not their bodies.

For their marriages, they are contracted with the consent of Parents, who will
not give their Daughters in marriage to any, except he be a good hunter. The
women are said to be chaste, and the contrary seldom found: and though the
husband has many wives, yet is there no jealousy among them. The widows
here, if their husbands be killed, will not marry again, nor eat flesh, till
their death be revenged. Otherwise they make no great difficulty (which
Cartier reports of Canada) to marry again if they find a fit match.
Sometimes the Savages having many wives will give one to their friend, if he
likes her, so to disburthen themselves. The women eat not with the men in
their meetings, but apart. When they make feasts they end them with dances all
in a round, to which one sings; at the end of every song all make a loud and
long exclamation: And to be the more nimble, they strip themselves stark
naked. If they have any of their enemies heads or arms, they will carry them
(as a jewel) about their necks whiles they dance, sometimes biting the same.

After their feasts they will diet themselves, living sometimes eight days
more or less with the smoke of Tobacco. They are in nothing laborious but in
hunting. They sow but so much as will serve them for six months, and that very
hardly: during the Winter they retire, three or four months space, into the
woods, and there live on Acornes, Fish, and Venison, They wash not themselves
at meals, except they be monstrous foul, and then wipe on their own or their
dogs hairs. Their entertainment is with small complement: the guest sits
down by his Host, if it be the King, takes Tobacco, and then gives the pipe
to him that he thinks the worthiest person in the company. They are dutiful
to their Parents, obey their commandments, and nourish their persons in age.
They use humanity to the wives and children of their conquered enemies, but
the men of defense they kill. Their chief hunting is in winter; they carry
always tinder-boxes with them, to strike fire when hunting is done, or night
takes them. For they follow the game sometimes three days together.

Their Dogs are like Foxes, which spend not, never give over, and have
rackets tied under their feet, the better to run on the snow. They sees the
flesh in a tubbe of wood, by putting stones heated red hot therein. The women's
duty is to flay the beast and bring it home. The Ellan Doare, Stagge, and
Bear, are their game. They take also with their hands Bevers, which are of a
chest-nut color, short legged, his forefeet have open claws, the hinder,
finnes like a Goose, the tail skaled, almost of the form of a Sole-fish: it
is the delicatest part of the beast. The head is short and round, with two
ranks of jaws at the sides; and before, four great teeth (two above and two
beneath) with which he cuts down small trees. He builds on the brinks of a
Lake, cuts his wood, there with raises a Vault; and because the waters
sometimes rise, he has an upper story to betake himself to in such case: he
builds it Pyramidewise, sometimes eight foot high, and daubes it with mud. He
keeps his tail still in the water. They take him with their hands in a frost,
one fraying him on the Ice, whiles an other seizes on his neck. When one dies,
they mourn for him long, every cabin his day by course: after that, they burn
all his goods, and bury the body in a grave: where when they have placed him,
every one makes a present of the best thing he has: as skins to cover him,
bows, knives, or the like.

The Scuruie or Scorbuch much consumed the French in these parts, a disease
that usually attends evil diet, and much salt meats; which, and want of
exercise convenient, are the harbengers of this sickness, Ol. Mag.l.16. cap.51.
in long sieges and nauigations. Cartiers company were in a little time
wonderfully cured hereof by a Tree like to Sassafras.

CHAP. V.
Of VIRGINIA.

Leaving New France, let us draw nearer the Sun to New Britain, whose Virgin
soil not yet polluted with Spaniards lust, by our late Virgin Mother, was
justly called Virginia. Whether shall I here begin with Elogies or Elegies?
Whether shall I warble sweet Carolls in praise of thy lovely Face, thou fairest
of Virgins, which from our other Britaine-World, has won thee Wooers and
Suitors, not such as Leander, whose loves the Poets have blazed for swimming
over the Straits betwixt Sestos and Abydus, to his lovely Hero; but, which for
thy sake have for-saken their Mother-earth, encountered the most tempestuous
forces of the Air, and so often ploughed up Neptunes Plains, furrowing the
angry Ocean, and that to make thee of a ruder Virgin, not a wanton Minion;
but, an honest and Christian Wife? Or shall I change my accent, and plain me
(for I know not of whom, to whom, to complain) of those disaduentures, which
these thy lovely Lovers have sustained in secking thy love? What envy, I know
not, whether of Nature, willing to reserve this Nymph for the treasury of her
own love, testified by the many and continual presents of a temperate
Clymate, fruitful Soil, fresh and fair Streams, sweet and wholesome Air,
except near the shore (as if her jealous policy had prohibited foreign
Suitors:) or of the savage Inhabitants, unworthy to embrace with their rustike
arms so sweet a bosom, and to appropriate with greatest disparagement so
fair a Virgin to Savage Loves: or happily some conceived indignity, that some
Parents should thither send their most unruly Sons, and that our Britannia
should make her Virginian lap to be the voider, for her lewder and more
disordered Inhabitants, whose ill parts have made distasteful those kinder
Offices of other our Britan Worthies, which else had been long since with
greatest gladness, and the recompense of her self entertained: Or whether it
be Virginian modesty, and after the use of Virgins, she would say nay at
first, holding that love surest in continuance, which is hardest in obtaining:
Whether any, or all of these, or what else has hindered; hindered we have
been, and have not yet obtained the full fruition of her Love, and possession
of her gainefull Dowry, which yet now (more then ever before) she seems to
promise, and doubtless will quickly perform, if niggardise at home do not
hinder. And should men be niggardly in this adventure, where Nabal must needs
verify his name, where keeping loses, aduenturing promises so fair a
purchase? Misery of our times, that miserable men should here want what they
already have, and refuse to have there, at no rate, abundant supply to their
too miserable fears of want. Lift up your eyes and see that brightness of
Virginia's beauty: which the Mountains lift up themselves always with wild
smiles to behold, sending down silver streams to salute her, which power
themselves greedily into her lovely lap, and after many winding embracements,
loath to depart, are at last swallowed of a more mighty corriuall, the Ocean:
He also sends Armies of Fishes to her coasts, to win her Love, even of his
best store, and that in store and abundance: the Mountains out-bid the Ocean,
in offering the secret storehouses of undoubted mines: he again offers
pearls: and thus while they seek to outface each other with their puffed and
big swollen cheeks, who shall get the Bride, the one lays hold on the
Continent and detaines the same, maugre the Oceans fury, and he again has
gotten the Islands all along the coast, which he guardeth and keeps with his
waterie Garrisons. Virginia, betwixt these two sower-faced Suitors, is almost
distracted, and easily would give entertainment to English love, and accept a
New Britan appellation, if her Husband be but furnished out at first in sorts
and suits, befitting her marriage solemnity: all which her rich Dowry would
maintain for ever after with advantage.

And well may England ^ourt her, rather then any other Europaean Lovers, in
regard of his long continued amity, and first discovery of her Lands and
Seas: this by Sebastian Cabot with his English Mariners, a hundred and fifteen
years since, and the other by Sir Walter Raleighs charge and direction, Anno
Domini one thousand five hundred fourscore and four.

Sir Richard Greenvile, conuaied thither an English Colonie, which he there
left for plantation, under the government of Master Ralphe Lane, which there
continued until the eighteenth of June in the year following, and then (upon
some urgent occasions) returned with Sir Francis Drake into England. Yet, had
they stayed but a little longer, a ship of Sir Walter Raleighs had supplied
their necessities: and soon after Sir Richard again repaired thither with
three ships, and then also left fifteen men more to keep possession. In the
year 1587. a second Colonie were sent under the government of Master John
White. To their succor Sir Walter Raleigh has sent five several times, the
last Brief Note of a Bark, etc. printed 1602.
by Samuel Mace of Weymouth, in March one thousand six hundred and two, but he
and the former performed nothing, but returned with frivolous allegations. The
same year, Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, and Captain Gilbert, discouecred the
North parts of Virginia, of which voyage John Brereton John Brereton.
has written a Treatise. And in the year one thousand six hundred and five,
Captain George Waymouth made thither a prosperous voyage, and discovered
threescore miles up a most excellent River. His voyage was set forth-in print
by James James Rosier.

After this followed the plantation by the present Adventurers, in the year
one thousand six hundred and six Relat. Cap. Smith. M.S. and W.S. M.S.
, at which time a hundredth of our men were left there for the foundation of a
New Britanian Commonwealth: and the East and West parts of England joined in
one purpose of a twofold plantation, in the North and South parts of Virginia.

True it is, that some emulations did even then becloude that morning Star,
and some disastrous Comets did arise in that Hemisphaere, in place of better
Stars, shining rather with combustion in civil broiles, and bralls, then
comfortable illumination and influence to the common good: these disorders were
attended with idleness of the most, sickness of many, and some dyed. A clear
sky did afterward appear in their agreement on the choice of Captain Smith
for their President, who having before fallen into the hands of the Virginians,
had been presented Prisoner to Powhatan, where he took advantage by that
disadvantage, to acquaint himself with the State and condition of the Country
and Inhabitants.

The Savages were now in good terms with the English, their plantation at
James Town where they had built a Church and many Houses, in some reasonable
manner flourished; the Country was with great pains and perils of the
President further discovered; their Swine, Hens, and other provision,
nourished; and some quantity of many commodities, as Furs, Dies, Mineralls,
Sassafrasse, Sturgeon, and other things sent hither, in testimony of their
industry and success. And (not to mention other supplies,) Virginia grew now
in such request New life of Virginia.
, that nine Ships were furnished with the better part of five hundred men, to
inhabit there, in the year one thousand six hundred and nine.

Sir Thomas Gates was appointed Lieutenant General; Sir George Summers
Admiral of Virginia, and were sent to reside there as Governors of the
Colonie. But the Sea Venture, wherein the two Knights, and Captain Newport,
with a hundred and fifty persons sailed, after long conflict with the two
angry Elements, was sent to be imprisoned in Bermuda, where between two Rocks
the Ship split, the people escaping to Land. In the mean time Man Script.

the other three ships had landed their men in Virginia, some of whom were such
as had been the emulous and envious corriualls of the President, which they
then began to show: and to second the same, a greater hurt by gunne-powder
befell him, which forced him for his recovery to set sail for England, after
he had lived there three years, maintayning himself and his that time
principally, with such food as the Country yielded. He says, he left
behind at his return five hundred men and women, three ships, seven boats,
two hundred expert Soldiers, thirty nine of their Weroances or Kings as
Subjects and contributers to the English, so far subject, that at his command
they have sent their subjects to James Town, to receive correction at his
appointment for wrongs done; and their Countries were free to the English for
travel or trade. But necessity forced him to leave the Country, which it
forced the other appointed Governors not to find. Hine illae lachrymae. Hence
proceeded the disorder and confusion which after happened amongst them. A great
body was here, which acknowledged no head, and therefore grew unwieldy and
distempered. Some sought for rule over others, which were ouer-ruled by unruly
passions of Ambition, and faction in themselves: others sought their ease,
except sometimes they were ouer-busie in diseasing others, and devouring that
which others had carefully labored for: Ruin seiseth on the Church, Rapine
makes prey and spoil of the goods; Rauine deuoureth their beasts; Famine
consumes the men; Injuries make the Indians their enemies; two of the ships
perish upon Vshant, and one man alone was left to bring home news of their
perishing: the rest return laden with letters of discouragement, painting our
Famine, Sedition, and other Furies, which had broken loose amongst them, in the
blackest colors: which were sealed with report of the loss of their Admiral,
to make up the measure of mischief.

All this did not daunt the Noble spirit of Lord de la War.
that Resolute Lord, appointed Lord Governor, who in the beginning of April
one thousand six hundred and ten, set sail from the coast of England, and on
the ninth of June arrived safely at the disfortified Fort in Virginia, where
he found the present State like to the Box Not. Com. Mytholog.l.4.c.6
of Pandora, which Epimetheus had opened, and suffered all evil to fly out,
reserving only Hope, which he shut fast in the bottom.

All evils had now dispersed themselves, and made the Virginian Colonie a
stage of Misery: only Hope remained. But alas even that also proved sick, and
was ready to give up the Ghost, in the dangerous sickness, which befell that
Noble Relation to the Council of Virginia by the Lord de la War. 1611.
Lord, which forced him after eight Months sickness, to return for England
again. He shipped himself indeed for Meuis, an Island in the West Indies,
famous for wholesome Bathes, but by Southerly winds was compelled to change his
purpose, and at last to make home: having left Deputy Governor Captain George
Pearcie, a Gentleman of honor and resolution, with upward of two hundred
persons.

Almighty God that had thus far tried the patience of the English, would not
suffer them to be tempted above that they were able: and therefore in his
secret providence, before any knowledge was here had of his Lordships
sickness, had ordained that Sir Thomas Dale should be furnished out with a good
supply of three ships, Men, Cattle, and many provisions, all which arrived
safe at the Colonie the tenth of May, one thousand six hundred and eleven. He
by his Letters, and the Lord Governor by his Relations, did animate the
Adventurers; the one protesting himself willing and ready to lay all that he
was worth upon the adventure of the action, rather then so honorable a work
should fail, and to return with all convenient expedition, if their friendly
endeavors would therein second his resolutions: the other Sir Thomas Dales

forwardness, that they furnished out Sir Thomas Gates, (who had happily
returned with the rest from Bermudas) with six ships, three hundred men, and a
hundred Kine, with other Cattle, Munition, and provision of all sorts.

Sir Thomas Dale, having news that it was a fleet of enemies, prepared
himself and the rest to an encounter, but it ended with a common joy, in the
shaking of hands, and not of Pikes. Laws are now made (for lawlesnesse had
marred so much before) for the honor of God, frequenting the Church,
observation of the Sabbath, reverence to Ministers, obedience to Superiors,
mutual love, honest labors, and against adultery, sactilege, wrong, and
other vices, harbengers of Gods wrath and man's destruction. The Colonie
consisted of seven hundred men of sundry arts and professions (few of them
sick) which having left the Fort at Cape Henry fortified and kept by Captain
Dauies, and the keeping of James Town, to that noble and well deserving
Gentleman Master George Pearcie, is removed up the River fourscore miles
further beyond James Town, to a place of higher ground, strong and defencible
by nature, with good air, plenty of Springs, much fair and open grounds
freed from woods, and wood enough at hand. Here they burnt bricks, cut down
wood, and every man falls to somewhat: they have built, they say, competent
houses, the first story all of brick, that every man may have his lodging and
dwelling by himself, with a sufficient quantity of ground allotted thereto.
Here also they were building an Hospital with fourscore lodgings, and beds
already sent, for the sick and lame, as the book, called the New life of
Virginia, relates.

Thus have I been bold somewhat largely to relate the proceedings of this
Plantation, to supplant such slanders and imputations as some have conceived or
received against it, and to excite the diligence and industry of all men of
ability, to put to their helping hand in this action, so honorable in it
self, glorious to God in the furtherance of his truth, and beneficial to the
commonwealth, and to the private purses of the Adventurers, if the blooming of
our hopes be not blasted with our negligence.

For the description of the Country; Master Hakluyt from others relations in
his third Volume of voyages has written largely of those parts, discovered for
Sir Walter Raleigh. Concerning the later, Captain John Smith, partly by word
of mouth, partly by his Map thereof in print, and more fully by a Manuscript
which he courteously communicated to me, has acquainted me with that whereof
himself with great peril and pain, had been the discouerer, being in his
discoueries taken Prisoner, and escaping their fury, yea receiving much honor
and admiration amongst them, by reason of his discourses to them of the motion
of the Sun, of the parts of the World, of the Sea, etc. which was occasioned
by a Dyall then found about him. They carried him prisoner to Powhatan, and
there began the English acquaintance with that Savage Emperor.

The sum of his observation in that and other discoueries since, concerning
the Country, is this. Virginia is situate between four and thirty and four
and forty degrees of Notherly latitude; the bounds whereof on the East side
are the great Ocean, Florida on the South, on the North Noua Francia: the
Western limits are unknown. But that part which began to be planted by the
English, in the year one thousand six hundred and six, is under the degrees
seven and thirty, eight and thirty, and nine and thirty.

The temperature agrees with English bodies, not by other means distempered.
The Summer is hot as in Spain, the Winter cold as in France and England:
certain cool Brizes do assuage the vehemency of the heat. The great Frost
in the year one thousand six hundred and seven reached to Virginia, but was
recompensed with as mild a Winter with them the next year.

There is but one entrance by Sea into this Country, and that at the mouth of
a very goodly Bay. The Capes on both sides are honored with the names of our
Britanian hopes, Prince Henry, and Duke Charles; lightsome and delightsome
rays of that Sun which shines from this elder to that New Britania. The
water flows in this Bay near two hundred miles, and has a channel, for a
hundred and forty miles, of depth, betwixt seven and fifteen fadome; of
breadth, ten or fourteen miles. At the head of the Bay, the Land is
Mountainous, and so runs by a South west line: from which Mountains
proceed certain brooks which after come to five principal Nauigable Rivers.
The Mountains are of diverse compositions, some like milstones, some of marble:
and many pieces of crystal they found thrown down by the waters, which also
wash from the Rocks such glistering Tinctures, that the ground in some places
seems gilded.

The color of the earth in diverse places resembles bole Ammoniac, terra
sigillata, and other such apparences: but generally is a black sandy mold. The
River next to the mouth of the Bay is Powhatan, the mouth whereof is near
three miles broad: it is Nauigable a hundred miles: falls, rocks, sholds,
prohibit further Navigations: hence Powhatan their greatest King has his
Title. In a Peninsula on the North-side thereof is situate James Town.

The people inhabiting which have their Weroances, are the Kecoughtans, which
have not past twenty fighting men. The Paspaheghes, have forty.
Chichahamania, two hundred. The Weanocks, a hundred. The Arrowhatocks, thirty.
The Place called Powhatan, forty. The Appamatucks, threescore. The
Quryoughcohanocks, five and twenty. The Warraskoyacks, forty. The
Nandsam^nds, two hundred. The Chesapeacks, a hundred. The Chickahama^^ians are
not governed by a Weroance, but by the Priests. No place affords more
Sturgeon in Summer, (of which at one draught have been taken threescore and
eight) nor in Winter more Foul. Fourteen miles from Powhatan is the River
Pamaunk, nauigable with greater Vessels, not above threescore and ten miles.
Toppahanock is nauigable a hundred and thirty miles; Patamomeke, a hundred and
twenty. To speak of Powtuxunt, Bolus, and other Rivers on the East side of
the Bay: likewise, of diverse places which received name by some accident, as
Fetherstones Bay, so called of the death of one of ours there happening, and
the like: or to mention the numbers which every people can make, would exceed
our scope, and the Readers patience. Captain Smiths Map may somewhat
satisfy the desirous, and his book when it shall be printed, further. This
the Captain says, that he has been in many places of Asia and Europe, in
some of Africa and America, but of all, holds Virginia by the natural
endowments, the fittest place for an earthly Paradise. Master Thomas Hariot
Hak.vol.3. p.267. Theod.de Bry. 1.part.Americae.
has largely described the commodities which the Water and Earth yield (set
forth also in Latin with exquisite pictures by Theodore de Bry) in the
relations of Brereton and Rosier, and others.

There is a grass which yields silk, beside tht store of silke-wormes. Hemp
and Flax surpassing ours in growth and goodness, exceeded by a newfound
stuff of a certain sedge or water-flagge, which grows infinitely, and with
little pains of boiling yields great quantity of sundry sorts of skeines
of good strength and length, some like silk, and some like flax, and some a
courser sort, as hemp.

There is also a rich vein of Alum, of Terra Sigillata, Pitch, Tar, Rozen,
Turpentine, Sassafras, Cedar, Grapes, Oil, Iron, Copper, and the hope of
better Mines, Pearl, sweet Gummes, Dies, timber Trees of sweet wood for profit
and pleasure, of which kind have been discovered fourteen several kinds.
Neither is it needful that here I relate the commodities of Virginia for food
in Fowls, Beasts, Fishes, Fruits, Plants, Herbs, Beries, Grains, especially
their Maiz, which yields incredible recompense for a little labor. One acre
of ground will yield with good husbandry two hundred bushels of corn. They
have two roots Cap.Smith.M.S.
; the one for medicinal use to cure their hurts, called Weighsacan, the other
called Tockawhough, growing like a flagge, of the greatness and taste of a
Potato, which passes a fiery purgation before they may eat it, being poison
whiles it is raw. Yet in all this abundance our men have had small store but of
want, and no fire nor water could purge that poison which was rooted in some,
to the hinderance of the plantation. Idleness in the vulgar, emulation,
ambition, and covetousness in some of the greater, treachery in some
fugitives, all these aiming more at their own ends then at the common good,
have from the beginning (I pray God it be, and I hope now is, ended) been the
poison to this honorable plantation.

The chief beasts of Virginia are Bears, less then those in other places,
Dear like ours, Aroughcun much like a Badger, but living on trees like a
Squirrell: Squirrells, as big as Rabbets, and other flying Squirrells, called
Assapanick, which spreading out their legs and skins seem to fly thirty
or forty yards at a time. The Ouassom has a head like a Swine, a tail like a
Rat, as big as a Cat, and has under her belly a bag wherein she carries
her young. Their Dogs bark not, their Wolves are not much bigger then our
Foxes, their Foxes are like our siluer-haired Conies, and smell not like ours.
They have Eagles, Hawks, wild Turkeys, and other Foul, and Fish, which here
to repeat would to some nice fastidious stomachs breed a fulness.

They are a people Tho Hariot.
clothed with loose mantles made of Dear skins, and aprons of the same,
round about their middles, all else naked: of stature like to us in England.
They use to paint themselves, and their children, he is the most gallant which
is most monstrous. Their women imbroder their legs, hands, etc. with diverse
works, as of Serpents, and such like, with black spots in the flesh.

Their houses are made of small poles, made fast at the top, in round form, as
is used in many arbours with us: covered with barks or mats, twice as long as
they are broad.

Of the Religion and Rites of the Virginians.

NOw for the manners and rites of the people, thus has Master Hariot Tho.

reported. They believe that there are many Gods, which they call Mantoac, but
of different sorts and degrees: one only chief and great God, which has been
from all eternity. Who, as they affirm, when he purposed to make the world,
made first other Gods of a principal order, to be as means and instruments
to be used in the Creation and government to follow: and after, the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, as petty Gods, and the instruments of the other order more
principal.

First, they say, were made waters, out of which by the Gods was made all
diversity of Creatures, that are visible or invisible. For mankind, they say,
a woman was made first, which by the working of one of the Gods, conceived and
brought forth children. And in such sort they say they had their beginning: But
how many years or ages have passed since, they say, they can make no relation:
having no letters, nor other means to keep records of times past, but only
Tradition from Father to Son. They think that all the Gods are of humane
shape, and therefore they represent them by Images, in the forms of men, which
they call Kewasowok: one alone is called Kewas. Them they place in Houses or
Temples, which they call Machicomuck, where they worship, pray, sing, and make
many times offerings unto them. In some Machicomuck we have seen but one
Kewas, in some two, in other three. They believe the immortality of the soul:
that after this life, as soon as the soul is departed from the body,
according to the works it has done, it is either carried to haeuen the
habitacle of Gods, there to enjoy perpetual bliss and happiness: or else to
a great pit or hole, which they think to be in the furthest parts of their
part of the world toward the Sunne-set, there to burn continually. This place
they call Popogusso. For the confirmation of this opinion they tell tales of
men dead and revived again, much like to the Popish Legends.

Thus they tell of one, whose grave the next day after his burial was seen to
move, and his body was therefore taken up again: who reported, that his soul
had been very near the entering into Popogusso, had not one of the Gods saved
him, and given him leave to return again, and teach his friends how to avoid
that terrible place. They tell of an other, which being taken up in that
manner; related, that his soul was alive while his body was in the grave, and
that it had travailed far in a long broad way, on both sides whereof grew
most delicate pleasant Trees, bearing more rare and excellent fruits then ever
he had seen before, or was able to express: and at length came to most brave
and fair houses, near which he met his Father, that had been dead before,
who gave him great charge to go back again, and show his friends what good
they were to do to enjoy the pleasures of that place, which when he had done,
he should after come again.

What subtlety soever be in their Wiroances Wiroance is a chief Lord, or
petty King, which sometime has but one Town: and none that we had dealing
with, had above eighteen Towns under him.
and Priests, the vulgar are hereby very respective to their Governors, and
careful of their manners: although they have also in criminal cases,
punishments inflicted according to the quality of the offense. This I learned
by special familiarity with some of their Priests, wherein they were not so
sure grounded, but that they lent open ear to ours, with doubting of their
own.

The Tho.de Bry. in Pictur.
Priests in Secota have their hair on the crown like a Comb, the rest being
cut from it: only a fore-top on the forehead is left, and that Comb. They have
a garment of skins peculiar to their function. They are great Wisards.

Our artificial Works, Fire-workes, Gunnes, Writing, and such like, they
esteemed the works of Gods, rather then of Men, or at least taught us by the
Gods. They bare much respect to our Bibles. When the Wiroans was sick, he sent
to us to pray for him. Some were of opinion that we were not mortal, nor
borne of Women, but that we were men of an old Generation many years past,
then risen again to immortality: some would likewise seem to prophecy that
there were more of our generation yet to come, to kill theirs, and take their
places: which were now in the Air invisible, and without bodies, and that they
by our entreatie did make men to die which had wronged us.

They have First voyage to Virginia. Hak.tom.3.249.
their Idol in the inner-most room of their house, of whom they tell
incredible things. They carry it with them when they go to the Wars, and
ask counsel thereof, as the Romans did of their Oracles. They sing songs as
they march toward the battle, in stead of Drums and Trumpets: their wars
are bloody, and have wasted much of their people.

A certain King called Piemacum, having invited many men and women of the
Sccontans to a feast, whiles they were merry and praying before their Idol,
came upon them and slew them. When M. Ralph Lane Hak.tom.3.261.
one of their Kings had conspired against the English, a chief man about him
said, that we were the servants of God, and not subject to be destroyed by
them: and that we, being dead men, could do more hurt then while we were
alive. They use to solemnize certain moneths-mindes in their Savage manner for
any great personage dead. James James Rosiers
Rosier from the relation of Owen Griffin, an eyewitness, thus tells of their
ceremonies. One among them, the eldest as he judged, rises right up, the other
sitting still: and looking about, suddenly cried with a loud voice, Baugh,
Waugh: then the women fall down, and lie upon the ground: and the men all
together answering the same, fall a stamping round about the fire, with both
feet, as hard as they can, making the ground shake, with sundry outcries, and
change of voice and sound. Many take the fire-sticks and thrust them into the
earth: and then rest a while. Of a sudden they begin as before, and continue
so stamping till the younger sort fetched from the shore many stones, of which
every man took one, and first beat upon them with their fire-sticks, then with
the stones beat the earth with all their strength. And in this manner they
continued above two hours. After this ended, they, which had wives, took them
apart, and withdrew themselves severally into the wood. This seemed to be
their evening devotion.

When they Theod. de Bry Icone 17.18. and seq.
have obtained some great deliverance from danger, or return from War, they
observe a public and solemn reioicing by making a great fire, encompassed
with the men and women promiscuously, all of them with Rattles in their hands
making a great noise.

They hold one time in the year festival, and then they meet together out of
many Villages, every one having a certain mark or Character on his back,
whereby it may be discerned whose Subject he is. The place where they meet
is spacious, and round about are set posts, carved with the resemblance of a
Nuns head: in the midds are three of the fairest Virgins lovingly embracing
and clasping each other: about this living Center, and Artificial circle, they
dance in their savage manner.

Their Idol called Kiwasa, is made of wood four foot high, the face
resembling the inhabitants of Florida, painted with flesh color, the breast
white, the other parts black, except the legs which are spotted with white;
he has chains or strings of beads about his neck.

This Idol is in Socota, as it were the keeper of the dead bodies of their
Kings. In their Temples are houses of public devotion, they have two, three,
or more of them, set in a dark place. The dead bodies of their Wiroances are
kept on certain Scaffolds nine or ten foot high, this Kiwasa their guardian
being placed with them: and underneath dwells a Priest which night and day
there numbreth his devotions.

But let us take view of our last Colonies observations. Captain Smith, News
from Virginia and a M.S. of Cap. Smith.
was taken by the Virginians, and while he stayed amongst them observed these
their magical Rites. Three or four days after his taking, seven of their
Priests in the house where he lay, each with a Rattle, (setting him by them)
began at ten of the clock in the morning, to sing about a fire, which they
environed with a circle of Meal, at the end of every song, (which the chief
Priest began, the rest following) laying down two or three Grains of Wheat:
and after they had thus laid down six or seven hundred in one Circle,
accounting their songs by Grains, as the Papists their Orisons by Beads,
they made two or three other circles in like manner, and put at the end of
every song, betwixt every two, or three, or five Grains, a little stick. The
High Priest disguised with a great skin, his head hung round with little
skins of Weasils, and other Vermin, with a crownet of Feathers, painted as
ugly as the Devil, at the end of each song uses strange and ves^ement
gestures, casting great Cakes of Dearesuet, and Tobacco into the Fire: thus
till six of the clock in the evening, they continued these howling devotions,
and so held on three days. This they pretended to do, to know if any more of
his countrymen would arrive, and what he there intended. They so fedd this
our Author, that he much misdoubted, that he should have been sacrificed to
the Quiyoughquosicke, which is a Superior power they worship, then the Image
whereof a more ugly thing cannot be described. To cure the sick, a certain
man with Their Ratles are of Gourds or Pompion rindes: of which they have their
treble, tenor, base, etc.
a little Rattle, using extreme howlings, shouting, singing, with diverse
anticke and strange behauiours over the Patient, sucketh blood out of his
stomach, or diseased place.

Not much unlike to that rattling devotion of their exorcising Priests, (at
least in absurdity) was that entertainment M.S. by W.S.
which Powhatans women gave the said Captain then being free and President of
the company, at Werowocomoco; Where thirty of them came out of the Woods
naked, only covered behind and before, with a few green leaves, their bodies
painted, but with some difference each from other: the leader of these Nymphs
resembled both Actaeon and Diana, having on her head a fair pair of Stagges
horns, and a quiver of Arrows at her back, with bow and Arrows in her hand:
The rest followed all horned alike, weaponed with unlike instruments: these (as
if they had been the infernal guard, coming with Cerberus to welcome
Proferpina to her Palace) rushed from the trees with hellish shoutes and cries,
dancing about a fire, which there was made for that purpose: and after an hour
thus spent, they departed. Then did they solemnly inuit him to their lodging,
where he was no sooner come, but all rounded about him with tedious kindness,
crying love you not me? This salutation ended, which Pan and all his Satyrs
would have accepted, they feasted him with plenty and variety, some singing
and dancing whiles others attended: and at last led him with a firebrand in
stead of a torch to his lodging.

When they Cap.Smith.Man.S.
intend any wars; the Weroances or Kings consult first with the Priests and
Coniurers. And no people have there been found so savage which have not their
Priests, Gods, and Religion. All things that are able to hurt them beyond their
prevention, they after their sort adore, as the Fire, Water, Lightning,
Thunder, our Ordnance, Pieces, Horses: Yea, Captain Smith told me; that they
seeing one of the English Bores in the way, were stricken with awful fear,
because he brisled up himself and gnashed his teeth, and took him for the
God of the Swine, which was offended with them.

The chief God they worship is the Devil, which they call Oak. They have
conference with him, and fashion themselves unto his shape. In their Temples
they have his Image ill-sauouredly made, painted, adorned with chains, copper,
and beads, and covered with a skin. By him is commonly the Sepulcher of their
Kings; whose bodies are first bowelled, then dried on a hurdle, and have about
the joints chains of copper, beads, and other like trash; then lapped in white
skins, and rolled in mats, and orderly entombed in arches made of mats, the
remnant of their wealth being set at their feet. These Temples and Bodies are
kept by their Priests. For their ordinary burialls, they dig a deep hole in
the earth with sharp stakes, and the corpse being wrapped in skins and mats
with their jewels, they lay them upon sticks in the ground, and cover them
with earth. The burial ended, the women having their faces painted with black
cole and oil, sit four and twenty hours in the houses mourning and
lamenting by turns, with yellings and howlings. Every Territory of a Weroance
has their Temples and Priests. Their principal Temple is at Vttamussack in
Pamaunk, where Powhatan has an house upon the top of certain sandy hills in
the woods. There are three great houses filled with Images of their Kings and
Devils, and Tombs of their Predecessors. Those houses are near threescore
foot long, built, after their fashion, arbour-wise. This place is in such
estimation of holiness, that none but the Priests and Kings dare enter: yea,
the Savages dare not pass by in boats without casting copper, beads, or
somewhat into the River.

Here are commonly resident seven Priests: the chief differed from the rest in
his ornaments: the other can hardly be known from the common people, but that
they have not so many holes at their ears to hang their jewels at. The
Highpriests headtire is thus made. They take a great many Snakes skins
stuffed with moss, as also of Weasils and other Vermines skins, which they
tie by their tails, so that all the tails meet on the top of the head like a
great Tassell. The faces of their Priests are painted as ugly as they can
devise: in their hands they have rattells, some Base, some Treble.

Their devotion is most in songs which the chief Priest begins, the rest
following: sometime he makes inuocations with broken sentences, by starts and
strange passions, and at every pause the other give a short groan. It cannot be
perceived that they have any set holy days: only, in some great distress of
want, fear of enemies, times of triumph, and of gathering their fruits, the
whole, Country, Men, Women, and Children, assemble to their solemnities. The
manner of their devotion is sometimes, to make a great fire, all singing and
dancing about the same with rattles and shouts, four or five hours: sometimes
they set a man in the midst, and dance and sing about him, he all the while
clapping his hands, as if he would keep time: after this, they go to their
feasts. They have certain Altar-stones, which they call Pawcorances, standing
from their temples, some by their houses, others in the woods and wildernesses;
upon which they offer blood, Deer-suet, and Tobacco. This they do when they
return from the wars, from their huntings, and on other occasions. When the
waters are rough in storms, their coniurers run to the waters sides, or
pass in their boats, and after many hellish outcries and inuocations, cast
Tobacco, Copper, Pocones, or such trash into the water, to pacify that GOD
whom they think to be very angry in those storms. Before their dinners and
Suppers the better sort will take the first bitt, and cast it into the fire,
which is all the grace they are known to use. In some part of the country
they have yearly a sacrifice of children: such an one was performed at
Quiyonghcohanock some ten miles from Iames-towne in this manner.

Fifteen of the properest young boys between ten and fifteen years of age
they painted white: Having brought them forth, the people spent the forenoone
in dancing and singing about them with Rattles: in the afternoon they put
these children to the root of a tree, all the men standing to guard them, each
with a Bastinado of Reeds bound together, in his hand. Then do they make a
Lane between them all along, through which there were appointed five young men
to fetch these children. Each of these fetches a child, the guard laying on
with their bassinadoes, while they with their naked bodies defend the children
to their great smart. All this time the women weep and cry out very
passionately, providing Mosle, Skins, Matts, and dry wood, as things fitting
the childrens Funeral. When the children are in this manner fetched away, the
Guard tears down trees, branches, and boughs, making wreathes for their
heads, or bedecking their hair with the leaves. What else was done with the
children was not seen, but they were all cast on a heap in a Valley, as dead,
where was made a great Feast for all the company. The Werowance being demanded
the meaning of this Sacrifice, answered, that the children were not all dead,
but that the Oak or Devil did suck the blood from their left breast, who chanced
to be his by Lot, till they were dead, but the rest were kept in the
Wilderness by the Young men, till nine Moons were expired, during which time
they must not converse with any, and of these were made their Priests, and
coniurers. This Sacrifice they held to be so necessary, that if they should
omit it, their Oak or Devil, and their other Quiyoughcosughes or Gods, would
let them have no Dear. Turkies, Corn, or Fish; and would besides make a great
slaughter amongst them. They think that their Werowances and Priests, which
they also esteem Quiyoughcosughes, when they are dead, do go beyond the
Mountains toward the setting of the Sun, and ever remain there in form of
their Oak, having their heads painted with Oil and Pocones Pocones is a small

aches, and painting.
finely trimmed with Feathers, and shall have Beads, Hatchets, Copper, and
Tobacco, never ceasing to dance and sing with their predecessors. The common
people, they suppose, shall not live after death. Some sought to convert them
from these superstitions: the Werowance of Quiyoughcohanocke was so far
persuaded as that he prosfessed to believe that our God exceeded theirs, as
much as our Gunnes did their Bows and Arrows: and many times did send to the
President many presents, entreating him to pray to his In that extremity of
misery which ours since sustained, I have been told that both the savages and
fugitives would object our want and their plenty, for theirs, and against our
Religion.
God for rain, for his God would not send him any.

The Wirowance of Acawmacke told our men of a strange accident: two children
being dead, and buried, being reuiewed by the patents, seemed to have lively
and cheerful countenances, which caused many to behold them, and none of the
beholders escaped death.

The Sasquesahanockes are a Gyantly people, strange in proportion, behavior,
and attire, their voice founding from them as out of a Cave: their attire of
Bears skins, hanged with Bears paws, the head of a Wolf, and such like
Jewels: and (if any would have a Spoone to eat with the Devil) their
Tobacco-pipes were three quarters of a yard long, carved at the great end with
a Bird, Bear, or other device, sufficient to beat out the brains of a horse
(and how many Asses brains are beaten out, or rather men's brains smoked out,
and Asses haled in by our less Pipes at home?) the the rest of their furniture
was suitable. The calfe of one of their legs was measured three quarters of a
yard about, the rest of his limbs proportionable. With much ado restrained
they this people from worshipping our men. And M.S. by W.S. collected out of
the writing of T.S.A.T.W.R.N.P.W.P.R.W.R.P.etc.
when our men prayed (according to their daily Custom) and sung a Psalm, they
much wondered: and after began in most passionate manner to hold up their hands
to the Sun, with a Song: then embracing the Captain they began to adore him
in like manner, and so proceeded (notwithstanding his rebuking them) till their
song was ended: which done, one with a most strange action and uncomely voice
began an Oration of their loves. That ended, with a great painted Bears skin
they covered the Captain, another hung about his neck a chain of white
Beads. Others laid eighteen mantels at his feet, with many other ceremonies
to create him their Governor, that he might defend them against the
Massa-womekes their enemies. As these are very great, so the Wighcocomocoes are
very little.

I may also here insert the ridiculous conceits which some Virginians hold,
concerning their first original, as I have heard from the relation of an
English Cap. Argoles boy his name was Henry Spilman.
youth, which lived long amongst the Savages: that a Hare came into their
country and made the first men, and after preserved them from a great Serpent:
and when two other Hares came thither, that Hare for their entertainment killed
a Dear, which was then the only Dear that was, and strewing the hairs of
that Deares Hide, every hair proved a Dear. He said they worshipped toward a
certain Hoope or Sphere doubled a-crosse, which was set upon an heap of
stones in their houses. They had a house without the town for the women, in
the time of their natural sickness to keep in, where no men might come,

The Virginians Cap. Smith.M.S.
are borne white: their hair black; few have beards: the women with two
shells are their Barbars: they are strong nimble, and hardy, inconstant,
timorous, quick of apprehension, cautelous, covetous of Copper and Beads;
they seldom forget an injury, and seldom steal from each other, least the
coniurers should bewray them, which it is sufficient that these think they can
do. They have their lands and gardens in proper, and most of them live of
their labor.

In each ear commonly they have three great holes, whereat they hang chains,
bracelets, or copper: some wear in those holes a small Snake colored green
and yellow, near half a yard long, which crawling about his neck, offers to
kiss his lips. Others wear a dead Rat tied by the tail. Their names are
given them according to the humor of the Parents. Their women they say are
easily delivered: they wash in the Rivers their young Infants to make them
hardy. The women and children do the household and field-worke, the men
disdaining the same, and only delighting in fishing, hunting, wars, and such
man-like exercises: the women plant, reap, bear burdens, pound their corn,
make Baskets, potts, their bread, and do their Cookerie and other business.

Powhatan had above thirty Commanders, or Wirrowances under him, all which
were not in peace only, but serviceable in Captain Smiths presidencie, to the
English, and still as I have been told by some that have since been there,
they do affect him, and will ask of him. Powhatan has three brethren, and
two sisters, to whom the inheritance belongs successively, and not to his or
their sons till after their death, and then the eldest Sisters son
inheriteth. He has his treasure of skins, Copper, pearls, beads, and such
like, kept in a house for that purpose, and there stored against the time of
his burial. This house is fifty or threescore yardes long, frequented only
by Priests. At the four corners of this house stand four images as Sentinels,
one of a Dragon, an other of a Bear, a third of a Leopard, and the fourth of a
Giant. He has as many women as he will, which when he is weary of, he
bestows on whom he best likes. His will, and Custom are the laws. He
executes civil punishments on malefactors, as broiling to death, being
encompassed with fire, and other tortures. The other Wirowances, or Commanders
(so the word signifies) have power of life and death; and have, some twenty
men, some forty, some a hundred, some many more under their command. Some were
sent to enquire for those which were left of Sir Walter Rawleighs Colony, but
they could learn nothing of them but that they were dead.

have before showed that Sebastian Cabota had discovered it in the name of King
Henry the seventh of England. The length of this Region extends to the five
and twentieth degree. It runs out into the Sea with a long point of land, as
if it would either set bars to that swift current which there runs out, or
point out the dangers of those coasts to the Hazardous Mariners.

Into the Land it stretches Westward unto the borders of New-Spaine, and those
other countries which are not fully known: other where it is washed with a
dangerous Sea, which separateth Cichora, Baliama, and Lucaiae from the same.

Pamphilo carried with him six hundred men: about the River of Palms, his
ships were wracked, and most of the Spaniards drowned. A few escaped drowning
but twelve fell mad, and like Dogs, sought to worrie each other. Scarsely ten

three dead men to life: I rather believe, says Benzo, that they killed four
quick men.

Captain and horseman, here found place to spend that which there he had
gotten. For having obtained the government of Florida, and gathered a band of
six hundred men for that expedition, in it he spent five years searching for
mineralls, till he lost himself. Julian Samado, and Ahumada made suit for the
like grant, but could not obtain it. Friar Luys de Beluastro, and other
Dominikes had undertaken by the way of preaching to have reduced the Floridians
to Christianity, and the Spanish obedience, and were sent at the Emperors
charge, but no sooner set foot on shore, then he and two of his companions
were taken by the Savages, and cruelly slain and eaten, their shaven skalpes
being hanged up in their Temple for a monument. This happened in the year
1549. In the year 1524. Francis the first, the French King had sent John John

Chastillon, Champion of Religion and of his country, sent Captain John
Ribault to discover and Plant in these parts, which his Voyage and Plantation
is written by Rene Rene Laud. ^^ Hak.
Landonniere, one employed therein. He left Captain Albert there with some of
his company, who built a fort called Charles Fort: but this Albert was slain
in a mutiny by his Soldiers, and they returning home were so pursued by
Famine, the Pursuiuant of Divine Justice, that after their shoes and Leather
Ierkins eaten (their drink being Sea water or their own Urine) they killed
and eat up one of their own company. Laudonniere was sent thither again to
inhabit, Anno 1564. and the next year Ribauls was sent to supply his place.
But uncouth He was relieved by Sir John Houkins great bounty
. Famine had so wasted and consumed the French, before his arrival, that the
very bones of most of the Soldiers pierced through their starued skins in
many places of their bodies, as if they would now trust the empty hands no
longer, but would become their own purueyours, and look out for themselves.
And yet better it is to fall into the hands of God, then of merciless Men:
Famine being but a mere Executioner to Gods justice, but these executing also
a devilish malice. Such were the Spaniards, who were sent thither under the
conduct of Don Pedro Melendes, which massacred all of every Sex and age, which
they found in the Fort: and Ribault, being cast by ship wrack on the shore,
and received of Vallemandus the Spaniard, with promises of all kindness, was
cruelly murdered with all his company, except some few which they reserved for
their own emploiments. The manner of it is at large handled by Laudon.ap.Hak.

Florida been first courted by the English, wooed by the Spanish, almost won
by the French, and yet remains a rich and beautiful Virgin, waiting till the
neighbor Virginia bestow on her an English Bridegroom, who as making the
first love, may lay the iustest challenge unto her.

Her riches are such that Cabcz.de vaca ap.Hak.in Lp. Dedic. in his Virginia

Cabeza de Vaca, (who was one of Naruaes wracked company, and Sotos Corriuall
in this Floridian suit, and had traveled through a great part of the Inland)

world, and that he had therein seen Gold and Silver, and stones of great
value. Besides there is great variety of Gaspar.Ens l.3 Botero part 1.l.5.

has let us see them in the pictures.

They wall or impale them with posts fastened in the ground, the circle as of a
snaile coming within that point where it began, and leaving a way but for
two men to enter; at either end of that double empaling or entrance, stand two
watch-towers, one within the other without the City, where Watchmen always are
set for defense: their houses are round: their apparel nakedness, except a
beasts skin, or some ornament of Moss about their secret parts. They paint
and raze their skins with great cunning; the smart makes them sick seven or
eight days after; they rubb over those rased works, with a certain herb,
which colors the fame so as it cannot be done away. They paint their faces,
and their skins cunningly (this Morgues a Painter being judge) even to
admiration. They let the nails on their toes and fingers grow long: they are
tall, nimble, comely.

They war Laudonniere.
always one country upon another, and kill all the men they can take, the women
and children they bring up: they cut off the hair of the head together with
the skin, and dry it to reserve the same as a monument of their valor. After
their return from the Wars, if they be victorious they make a solemn.
Feast which lasts three days, with daunces and songs to the honor of the
Sun. For the Sun and Moon are their Deities. Their Priests are Magicians
also and Physicians with them. They have many Hermaphrodites, which are put to
great drudgerie, and made to bear all their carriages. In necessity they will
eat coals, and put sand in their pottage. Three months in the year they
forsake their houses, and live in the woods: against this time they have made
their provision of victual, drying the same in the smoke. They meet in
co^sultatio^ every morning in a great common house, whither the King resorteth
and his senators, which after salutations sit down in a round. They consult
with the Iawas or Priest. And after this they drink Cassine, which is very
hot, made of the leaves of a certain Tree, which none may taste that bath not
before made his valor evident in the wars. It sets them in a sweat, and
takes away hunger and thirst four and twenty hours after. When a King dies,
they bury him very solemnly, and upon his grave they set the cup wherein he was
wont to drink: and round about the grave they stick many Arrows, weeping and
fasting three days together without ceassing. All the Kings which were his
friends, make the like mourning: and in token of their love cut off half
their hair (which they otherwise wear long, knit up behind) both men and
women. During the space of six Moons (so they reckon their months) there are
certain women appointed which bewail his death, crying with a loud voice
thrice a day, at Morning, Noone, and Evening. All the goods of this King are
put into his house, which afterward they set on fire. The like is done with
the goods of the Priests, who are buried in their houses, and then both house
and goods burned.

The women Morgues Icon.18 19.
that have lost their husbands in the Wars present themselves before the King
sitting on their heels with great lamentations sueing for revenge and they
with other widows spend some days in mourning at their husbands graves, and
carry thither the cup wherein he had wont to drink: they cut also their hair
near the ears, strewing the same in the sepulcher. There they cast also their
weapons. They may not marry again till their hair be grown that it may cover
their shoulders.

When any is sick they lay him flat on a form, and with a sharp shell rasing
off the skin of his forehead, suck out the blood with their mouths, spitting
it out into some vessel. The women that give suck, or are great with child
come to drink the same, especially if it be of a lusty young man, that their
milk may be bettered, and the child, thereby nourished, may be stronger.

Ribault Icon.8.
at his first being there had fixed a certain Pillar of stone, engraven with
the Arms of France on a hill in an Island, which Laudonniere at his coming
found the Floridians worshipping as their Idol, with kisses, kneeling, and
other devotions. Before the same lay diverse offerings of fruits of the country,
roots (which they used either for food or physic) vessels full of sweet
oiles, with bows and Arrows. It was gyrt about with Garlands of flowers, and
boughs of the best trees, from the top to the bottom, King Athore himself
performed the same honor to this pillar, that he received of his subjects.
This King Athore was a goodly personage, higher by a foot and half then any
of the French, representing a kind of majesty and gravity in his demeanure.
He had married his own mother, and had by her diverse children of both sexes;
but after she was espoused to him, his father Satourioua, did not touch her.

This Icon.11.
Satourioua when he went to war, in the presence of the French used these
ceremonies: The Kings his coadi^tors sitting around, he placed himself in the
midst, at his right hand had a fire, and at his left two vessels full of water.
Then did he express Indignation and anger in his looks, gestures, hollow
murmurings, and loud cries, answered with the like from his soldiers: and
taking a wooden dish, turned himself to the Sun as thence desiring
victory, and that as he now shed the water in the dish, so he might shed the
blood of his enemies. Hurling therefore the water with great violence into the
air, and therewith be sprinkling his soldiers he said, Do you thus with the
blood of our enemies: and pouring the water which was in the other vessel on
the fire, so (says he) may you extinguish your foes, and bring back the
skins of their heads. Outina Icon.12.
or Vtina another King was an enemy to this Sataurioua: he in his expedition
which he made against his enemies (wherein he was assisted by the French)
consulted with this Magician about his success. He espying a French man's
Target, demands the same, and (in the mids of an army) places it on the
ground, drawing a circle five foot over about it, adding also certain notes
and Characters: then did he set himself upon the Target, sitting upon his
heels, mumbling I know not what with variety of gestures about the space of a
quarter of an hour: after which he appeared so transformed into deformed
shapes that he looked not like a man, wreathed his lims and his bones cracking
with other actions seeming supernatural. At last he returns himself as it
were weary and astonished, and coming out of the circle saluted the King; and
told him the number of their enemies and place of their encamping, which they
found very true. This King was called Holata Outina, which signifies; a King,
of Kings, and yet a few hundreths of men were his army, which he Icon.14.
conducted in their ranks, himself going alone in the mids. They dry the
arms and legs, and crowns of their enemies which they have slain, to make
solemn triumph at their return, which they do, fastening them on poles
pitched in the ground, the men and women sitting round about, and the Magician
with an Image in his hand, mumbling curses against the enemy: over against him
are three men kneeling, one of which beats a stone with a clubb, and
answers the Magician at every of his imprecations, the other two sing and
make a noise with certain Rattles.

They sow or set their corn rather, as in Virginia: and have two seede-times,
and two haruests, which they bring into a public barn, or common storehouse
as they do the rest of their victuals, none fearing to be beguiled of his
neighbor. Thus do these Barbarians enjoy that Content attended with Sobriety
and Simplicity, which we have banished together out of our coasts: every one
distrusting or defra^ding others, whiles either by miserable keeping, or
luxurious spending, he (which is Auarus, Malus omnibus, sibi pessimus. Seneca.
bad to all) is worst to himself. To this barn they bring at a certain time
of the year, all the Venison, Fish, and Crocodiles, (dried before in the smoke
for the better preservation) which they meddle not with till need forces
them, and then they signify the same to each other. The King may take thereof
as much as he will. This provision is sent in baskets on the shoulders of their
Hermaphrodites, which wear long hair, and are their Porters for all burdens.

They hunt Hearts after a strange manner: for they will put on a Hearts skin,
with the legs and head on, so that the same shall serve them to stalk with;
and they will look through the eye and holes of the Hide, as if it were a
visour, thereby deceiving their game, which they shoot and kill, especially at
the places, where they come to drink. Their Crocodiles they take in a strange
manner. They are so plagued with these beasts, that they keep continual
watch and ward against them, as other-where against their enemies. For this
purpose they have a Watch-house Icon.16.
by the Rivers side, and when hunger drives the beast on shore for his prey,
the Watchman calls to men appointed: they come ten or twelve of them, hearing
a beam or Tree, the smaller end whereof they thrust into the mouth of the
Crocodile (coming upon them gaping for his prey) which being sharp and rough,
cannot be got out, and therewith they ouer-turne him, and then being laid on
his back, easily kill him. The flesh N. Chalus.c.3.
tastes like Veale, and would be sauourie meat, if it did not savor so much
of a musky sent. Their sobriety Ic.2.8.

Morgues, that he was Laudon. says two hundred and fifty, but he saw them not

three hundred years old, and his Father, which there he showed me alive, was
fifty years elder then himself: when I saw him, me thought I saw nothing but
bones covered with skin. His sinews was, veins, and arteries, says
Laudonniere in description of the same man, his bones and other parts appeared
so clearly through his skin, that a man might easily tell them, and discern
the one from another. He could not see, nor yet speak without great pain.
Monsieur de Ottigni, demanding of their age, the younger of these two called a
company of Indians, and striking twice on his thigh, laid his hands on two of
them, he showed that they were his sons: and striking on their thighs, he
showed others which were their sons, and so continued till the fifth
generation. And yet it was told them, that the eldest of them both might by the
course of Nature live thirty or forty years more.

They have Morgues Icon.34.
a devilish custom to offer their first borne Male Children to the King for a
Sacrifice. The day of this dismal Rite being notified to the King, he goes
to the place appointed and sittes down. Before him is a block two foot high,
and as much thick, before which the Mother of the Child sitting on her
heels, and covering her face, with her hands, deploreth the death of her
son. One of her friends offers the child to the King: and then the women
which accompained the mother, place themselves in a Ring, dancing and singing,
and she that brought the child, stands in the mids of them with the child in
her hands, singing somewhat in the Kings commendation. Six Indians stand
apart, and with them the Priest with a Clubbe, wherewith after these
ceremonies he kills the child on that block: which was once done in our
presence.

Another Icon.35.
Religious Rite they observe about the end of February: they take the hide of
the greatest Heart they can get (the horns being on) and fill the same with the
best herbs which grow amongst them, hanging about the horns, neck, and
body, as it were Garlands of their choicest fruits. Having thus sowed and
trimmed it, they bring the same with songs and Pipes, and set it on a high
Tree, with the head turned toward the East, with prayers to the Sun, that he
would cause the same good things to grow again in their Land. The King and his
Magician stand nearest the Tree and begin, all the people following with
their Responds. This done, they go their ways leaving it there till the next
year, and then renew the same ceremony.

Bibault R. Laudonn.
at his first coming had two of the Floridians abord with him certain days,
who, when they offered them meat refused it, giving them to understand that
they were accustomed to wash their face, and to stay till sunne-set before they
did eat: which is a ceremony common in all those parts. They observe a
certain Feast called Toya, with great solemnity. The place where it is kept
is a great circuit of ground, swept and made neat by the women the day before:
and on the Feast day they which are appointed to celebrate the Feast, come
painted and trimmed with feathers, and set themselves in order. Three T^ese
3.are lawas, which are Priests, Magicians, and Physicians.
others in differing painting and gestures follow with Tabrets, dancing and
singing in a lamentable tune, others answering them. After that they have sung,
danced, and turned three times, they fall to running like unbridled Horses,
through the midst of the thick woods: the Indian women continuing all the
day in weeping and tears, cutting the arms of the young girls with
muskle-shelles, with hurling the blood into the Air, crying out three times,
He Toya. Those that ran through the Woods, return two days after, and then
dance in the midst of the place, and cheer up those which were not called
to the Feast. Their daunces ended, they devour the meat, for they had not
eat in three days before. The Frenchmen learned of a boy, that in this
meanewhile the Iawas had made inuocation^^ Toya, and by Magical Characters had
made him come that he might speak with him, and demand diverse strange things
of him, which for fear of the Iawas he durst not utter.

To provoke them unto revenge against their enemies, they in their Feasts have
this custom. There is a Dagger in the room, which one takes and strikes
therewith one that is thereunto appointed, and then places the Dagger where he
had it, and anon renews the stroke, till the Indian falling down, the
women, Girls, Boys, come about him and make great lamentation, the men mean
while drinking Cassine, but with such silence, that not one word is heard:
afterward they apply Moss warmed, to his side to heal him. Thus do they
call to mind the death of their ancestors slain by their enemies, especially
when they have invaded, and return out of their enemies country without the
heads of any of them, or without any Captives.

These things following Ortelius Ortel.Theat.
says, he had from his Nephew Caelius Ortelius, by the Relation of an
eyewitness. The King gives, or sells rather, to every man his Wife. If a
woman commit Adultery, she is bound to a Tree, her arms and legs stretched
out all day, and sometimes whipped. A woman, three hours after she is
delivered of a Child, carries the Infant to the River to wash it. They observe
no discipline in their Families with their Children. They have Fleas, which
bite so eagerly, that they leave a great deformity like a Lepry after: They
have winged Serpents, one of which I saw, says Nicolaus Challus. exped. in
Florid.c.3.
Challusius, the wings whereof seemed to enable it to fly a little height from
the ground: The inhabitants were very careful to get the head thereof, as was
thought, for some superstition. Botero Botero Rel. part.1.lib.5.
says, that they have three sorts of Hearts, and of one of them make the same
commodities which we do of our kine, keeping them tame, and milking them. The
Spaniard has three garrisons on the coast of Florida, S. Iacomo, S. Agostino,
and S. Philippo.

They are Gasp.Ens.l.3
much addicted to venery, and yet abstain from their wives after conception
known. When Discovery of Florida and Virginia richly valewed.
Ferdinando Soto entered Florida, he there found amongst the Indians one John
Ortiz a Spaniard, which by the suttlety of the people, under color of
delivering a letter which they had fastened to a clest cane, was taken and lived
twelve years with them. Vcita the Lord of the place made him his
Temple-keeper, because that by night the wolves came and carried away the dead
corpses. He reported that these people are worshippers of the Devil, and use
to offer unto him the life and blood of their Indians, or of any people, that
they can come by: and when he will have them do that sacrifice unto him, he
speaks unto them, and tells them, that he is a thirst, and enioynes them
this sacrifice. They have a prophecy, That a white people should sobdue them;
wherein the French and Spanish have hitherto failed in their attempts. Soto
having in his greedy hopes neglected the many, commodities he might have
enjoyed, to find greater: was brought to such dumps that he thereon sickened,
and after died. But before he took his bed, he sent to the Cacique of
Quigalta, to tell him, that he was the child of the Sun, and therefore would
have him repair to him: he answered. That if he would dry up the river, he
would believe him. And when he was dead, because he made the Indians believe
that the Christians were immortal, the Spaniards sought to conceal his death.
But the Cacique of Guachoya busily enquiring for him, they answered that he was
gone to heaven, as many times he did, and had left an other in his place. The
Cacique thinking he was dead, Benzo libr.2.
commanded two young and well proportioned Indians to be brought thither,
saying it was their custom to kill men, when any Lord died, to wait on him by
the way: which their cruel courtesy the Spaniards refused, denying that their
Lord was dead. One Cacique asked Soto what he was, and why he came thither, he
answered, That he was the son of GOD, and came to teach them knowledge of
the Law. Not so, says the Cacique, if GOD bids thee thus to kill, steal, and
work all kind of mischief.

For their credulity in like case, Laudonniere tells, that a strange and
unheard of lightning happened within a league of their fort, which consumed in an
instant 500 acres of meadow, being then green, and half covered with water,
together with the fowls that were therein. It continued burning three days
together, and made the Frenchmen think, that for their sakes the Indians had
set fire on their dwellings, and were gone to some other place. But a certain
Paracoussy, which is one of their petty Kings, or Caciques, sent to him a
Present, beseeching him to command his men that they should shoot no more
toward his dwelling, thinking that the ordinance had caused all this; which
occasion he used to his own good, by arrogating that to himself which he saw
their simplicity conceived of him. Within two days after this accident, fell
such an heat, that the river (I think) was ready to sees: and in the mouth of
the river were found, dead therewith, fishes enough to have laden 50 carts, whereof
issued, by putrefaction, much sickness.

Calos is near the Cape of Florida. The King thereof made his subjects
believe, that his sorceries and charms were the cause that made the earth
bring forth her fruit Loudon. was told this of certain Spaniards which lived
in those parts.
and that he might the easier persuade them, he retired himself once or twice
a year to a certain house, accompanied with two or three of his friends,
where he used enchantments. If any man offered to see what he did, it cost him
his life. Every year he offers a man in the time of harvest, which was kept
for that purpose, and taken of such Spaniards as had suffered shipwreck on
that coast.

They which further desire to know the riches and commodities of these
Countries, may resort to the Authors in this Chapter mentioned. Sir Francis
Drake, in the year 1586, besides his worthy exploits in other places, took
the sorts of S. John and S. Augustine; whence he brought Pedro Morales and
Nicholas B^^goig^^^^, whose relations concerning that country M. Hackel^^yt
has inserted among other his painful labors.

David Ingram David Ingram ap. Hack. te.3.Edit.1.
reported many strange things which he says he saw in these parts, elephants,
horses, and beasts twice as big as horses, their hinder parts resembling
greyhounds; bulls with ears like hounds; beasts bigger then bears, without
head or neck, but having their eyes and mouths in their breasts: and an other
beast, C^rberus, he calls him Colluchio, which is (says he) the devil in
likeness of a dog, and sometimes of a calfe; with many other matters, wherein he
must pardon me, if I be not too prodigal of my says. He tells also of
punishment of adultery by death, the woman cutting the adulterers throat, and
the nearest kinsman, hers, after many prayers to the Colluchio, and a further
punishment, in that they have no quick body buried with them to attend them
into the other world, as all others have. But they that list to believe, may
consult with the Author.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Countries situate Weslward from Florida and Virginia toward the South
Sea.

HItherto we have discovered those parts of this Northern America, which trend
along the North sea, which the English and French Nations have most made known
unto us: further westward the midland Countries are not so well known; yet
following our Spanish guides we here present them from their relations to your
view. When as Cortez had conquered Mexico, as after follows to be related, he
was made Admiral of the South seas, but the government of Mexico and new
Spain was, with the title of Viceroy, given to Don Antonio de Mendoza. These
two, partly in emulation of each others glory, partly in hope of enriching
themselves, sought to discover unknown lands; the one by Sea; the later, both
by sea and land.

The Viceroy sent In his letter to the Emperor ^p. Hack. to.3.
as he himself testifies, Francis Vasquez de Coronado, and Friar Marco de
Nisae, with Stephen a Negro by land: out of whole relations we have inserted
that which concerns our purpose. Mark Marco de Nisa his relation.
the Friar, and Stephen set forth with certain Indians in this Discovery: and
Stephen going before, came to Ceuola, as Mark related, where he was slain:
the Friar followed with his Indian guides, and passed thorough one place where
was small store of victual, because it had not there rained, as the
Inhabitants affirmed, in three years space. The Indians called him Hayota,
that is, a man come from heaven. He passed on further, led by the fame of
Cevola, which with other six cities were reported to be under the government of
one Lord, and to have houses of stone, consisting of diverse stories, where were
many Turqueses, with many other strange reports of their markets, multitudes,
and wealth. But because the Friar came not there for fear of the Negroes
entertainment, let us listen to F. Vasquez his relation.
Francis Vasques, who came, saw, and overcame. An.1540. he went with his army
from Culiacan which is 200. leagues from Mexico, and after a long and tedious
journey, he at last arrived in this province, and conquered (almost with the
loss of himself) the first City of the seven, which he called Cranado. Twice
he was stricken down with stones from the wall, as he offered to scale the
fame. He says that their houses were of four or five stories or lofts, to
which they ascended on ladders: and that they had sellers under the ground,
good, and paued. But those seven cities were small towns, all standing in the
compass of four leagues, all called by that general name of Cevol^ or
Cibola, and none of them particularly so called, but having other peculiar
names, they were of like building. In this town which he conquered stood 200
houses, walled about, and 300. others not walled. The Inhabitants had before
removed their wives and wealth to the hill. He reports of beasts there,
bears, tigres, lions, and sheep, as big as horses, with great horns, and
little tails, Ounces also and stags. That which the Indians worshipped (as far
as they could learn) was the water, which, said they, caused the corn to
grow, and maintained their life. He found there a garment excellently
embroidered with needle-worke. Vasques went hence to Tiguez, to Cicuic, and to
Quivira, as F.Lop.c. 212. 213. and 214.
Lopes de Gomar a reports. This way is full of crooke-backed oxen. Quivira is
in forty degrees, and the Country is temperate. They saw ships in the Sea with
bare Alcatoazes or Pelicans of gold and silver in their prowes, laden with
merchandise: which they took to be of China or Cathay.

The men in these parts clothe and shoe themselves with leather: they have no
bread of any kind of grain: their chief food is flesh, which they often eat
raw, either for custom, or for lack of wood. They eat the fat as they take
it out of the ox, and drink the blood hot (which of our bulls is counted
poison) and the flesh they warm (for they sees it not) at a fire of oxe-dung.
They rather may be said to raven, then to eat it: and holding the flesh with
their teeth, cut it with rasors of stone. They go in companies as the Scythian
Nomades, Tartarian Hords, and many other nations, following the seasons and
best pasturings for their oxen. These oxen Oxen of Quivira.
are of the bigness and color of our bulls, but their horns ate not so great.
They have a great bunch upon their shoulders, and more hair on their
forepart, then on the hinder: and it is like wool. They have, as it were, a
horse-m^ne on their backbone, and much hair, and very long, from their knees
downwards. They have great tufts of hair on their foreheads, and have a kind
of beard under their chinnes and throats. The Males have very long tails,
with a great knobbe or flock at the end: so that in some respect they resemble
a Lion, in other the Camels, Horses, Oxen, Sheep, or Goats. They push with
their horns, and in their rage would overtake and kill a Horse: for the
Horses fled from them, either for their deformity, or because they had never
seen the like. The people have no other riches: they are unto them meat,
drink, apparel: their Hides also yield them houses, and ropes; their bones,
bodkins; their sinews and hair, thread; their Horns, Mawes, and Bladders,
Vessels; their dung, fire; the Calues-skinnes, budgets, where with they draw
and keep water.

G^mara also mentions their sheep, which they so call because they have fine
wool and horns: they are as big as horses, weigh fifty pound weight a
piece. There are also Dogs which will fight with a Bull, and will carry fifty
pound weight in Sackes when they go on hunting: for when they remove from place
to place with their herds.

The Winter is long and sharp, with much snow in Cibola, and therefore they
then keep in their Cellers which are in place of Stoves unto them. In the
height of seven and thirty degrees, at Tiguez, the cold was so extreme, that
the horses and men passed over the River upon the Ice: They there took a town
Taking of Tiguez.
after five and forty days siege, but with much loss, and little gain. For
the Indians killed thirty horses in a night: and in an other slew certain
Spaniard, sent Ouando up into the country (they could not tell whether for
Sacrifice, or for the show) and wounded fifty horses: they drunk Snow in
stead of water: and seeing no hope to hold out, made a great fire, and cast
therein all they had of worth, and then went all out to make way by by force;
where they were all in manner slain, but not unrevenged, forcing some
Spaniards to accompany them into the Regions of death, and wounding many more,
both men and horses. The Snow continues in these parts half the year.
Quivira is more northerly, and yet more temperate. The Spaniards returned to
Mexico in the end of the year 1542, to no small grief of Mendoza, who had
spent in this expectation 60000 ducats. Some Friars stayed, but were slain by
the people of Quivira, only one man escaped, to bring news to Mexico.

Sir Francis Drake sailed on the other side of America to forty degrees of
northerly latitude, and with cold was forced to retire, although the Sun
followed him all the way from Guatulco hither (which he sailed from the sixth
day of April to the fifth day of June) as if that most excellent and heavenly
Light had delighted himself in his society, and acknowledged him for his
son, more truly then the Spaniards (whereof anon we shall heat) or that

landed on this coast in thirty eight Degrees, where the Inhabitants presented
themselves unto him, with presents of feathers, and kalls of net-worke, which
he requited with great humanity. The men went naked, the women knit loose
garments of bull-rushes about their middles. They came a second time, and
brought feathers, and bags of Tobacco; and after a long Oration of one that
was Speaker for the rest, they left their bows on a hill, and came down to
our men: the women mean while remaining on the hill, tormented themselves,
tearing their flesh from their cheeks, whereby it appeared that they were
about some sacrifice. The news being further spread, brought the King thither,
which was a man of goodly stature: many tall men attended him: two Ambassadors
with a long Speech of half an hour, signified his coming before. One, went
before the King with a Scepter or Mace, whereon hanged two Crowns with three
Chains: the Crowns were of knit-worke, wrought artificially with diverse
colored feathers, the chains of a bony substance. The King followed clothed
in conyskinnes: the people came after, all having their faces painted with
white, black, and other colors, every one bringing his present, even the very
children also. The Scepterbearer made a loud speech of half an hour, taking
his words from an other which whispered the same unto him, which with a solemn
applause being ended, they came all down the hill in order without their
weapons: the Scepter-bearer beginning a song and dancing, wherein all the rest
followed him. The King, and diverse others, made several Orations or
Supplications to the General, to become their King: and the King with a song
did set the Crown on the Generals head, and put the chains about his neck,
honoring him by the name of Hioh. The common sort leaving the King and his
guard, scattered themselves, with their sacrifices, among our people, taking
view of all, and to such as best pleased their fancy, which were the youngest,
offered their sacrifices, with weeping, scratching, and tearing their flesh,
with much effusion of blood. The English misliked their devotions, and directed
them to the living God: they showed again their wounds, whereunto the other
applied plasters and lotions. Every third day they brought their sacrifices,
till they perceived that they were displeasing. And at the departure of the
English, they (by stealth) provided a sacrifice, taking their departing very
grievously.

They found herds of Dear feeding by thousands, and the country full of
strange conies, headed like ours, with the feet of a Want. and tail of a Cat,
having under their chins, a bag, into which they gather their meat when they
have filled their body abroad. There is no part of the earth, wherein there is
not some special likelihoode of gold or silver. The General named the
Country Nova Albion.
Nova Albion. In the year 1581. History of China by Fr. Iuan Gonsalez de
Mendosa.
Augustine Ruiz, a Friar, learned by the report of certain Indians called
Conchos, that toward the north there were certain great towns, not hitherto
discovered by the Spaniards: whereupon, he, with two other companions of his
own Order, and eight soldiers, went to seek these parts, and to preach unto
them. They came unto the Province de los Tiguas, two hundred and fifty leagues
Northwards from the mines of Saint Barbara, where one of the Friars was slain
by the Inhabitants. This caused the soldiers to return back, but the Friars
stayed still behind. The Franciscans fearing the loss of these their brethren,
procured Antonio de Espeio An.de Espeio Nouemb.1512
to undertake this journey, with a company of soldiers. He passing the
Conchos, the Pas^aquates, the Toboses, came to the Patarabueyes, which is a
great Province, and has many towns, their houses flat roofed, and built of
lime and stone, their streets orderly placed. The people are of great stature,
and have their faces, arms, and legs rased and pownced. Here New Mexico.
were many Lakes of salt water, which at a certain time of the year waxes
hard, and becomes very good salt. The Caciques kindly entertained them with
victualles and other presents, especially hides, and Chamois skins very well
dresled, as well as those of Flanders: And passing many days journey further
Northwards, they came where the houses were four stories high, well built, and
in most of them, stoues for the winter season. The men and women wear shoes
and boots with good soales of neats leather, a thing not else where to be seen
in the Indies. In this province they found many Idols, which they worshipped:
and particularly they had in every house an oratory for the devil, whereinto
they ordinarily carry him meat: and as the Papists erect Crosses upon
highways, so have this people certain high Chappells, very well trimmed and
painted, in which they say the devil uses to take his case, and to recreate
himself as he trauelleth from one town to an other. In the province of
Tiguas there were sixteen towns, in one of which the Friars aforesaid were
slain. Six leagues from thence was the province Los Quires which worship
Idols as their neighbors: they saw there certain Canopies, wherein were
painted, the Sun, Moon, and many Stars. It is in 37. Hence they passed,
keeping still their northerly course, and found a Province called Cuuames,
where were five towns, one of which was Chia, which contained eight market
places, the houses were plaistered and painted with diverse colors: they
presented them curious mantles, and showed them rich mettalls. Beyond this they
came to the Ameies, and fifteen leagues thence, to Acoma, which is situate
upon a rock: and has no other entrance but by a ladder, or pair of stairs,
hewn in the same rock: all their water was kept in cisterns. They passed
hence to Zuny, which the Spaniards call Cibola, and there found three Spaniards
left there by Vasques forty years before, which had almost forgotten their own
language. Westward from hence they came to Mohotze, where were exceeding rich
mines of silver, as likewise in some of the other. These parts seem to incline
toward Virginia.

Now that we have heard of the inland Discoueries by the Spaniards, and that
Nova Albion of Sr. Francis Drake, let us take some view of the Spanish
navigations on these coasts.

Cortes the Conqueror of Mexico sent Fran. Vlloa apud Ramus. and Hack. vol.3.
Francis de Vlloa with a fleet for discovery, in the year 1539 from Acapulco,
which came to Santa Cruz in California. They sailed over the gulf, and came to
the river of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, where they beheld, on both sides, a
goodly Country. I am loath to hold on with them in their voyage, lest I sail
from my scope, and leave the offended Reader behind me. Here they found in
their course burning mountains, which cast up fire, ashes, and smoke in great
quantity. They encountered with a cruel storm, and being almost out of hope,
they saw, as it were, a candle upon the shrowdes of the Trinity (one of their
ships) which the Mariners said was Saint Elmo, and saluted it with their
songs and prayers. This is the darkness of Popery, to worship a natural
light: yea that which has little more then being, and is an imperfect Meteor,
is with them more perfect then humane, and must participate in divine worships.
Without the gulf of California they found store of great fish, which suffered
themselves to be taken by hand: also they saw weeds floting on the Sea, fifty
leagues together, round, and full of gourdes, under them were store of fish, on
them store of foul: they grow in fifteen or twenty fadome depth. They caught
with their dogs, a beast very fat, haired like a goat, otherwise resembling a
dear: in this, neither, that it had four dugs like unto a Cow full of milk.
But because they had little dealing with the Inhabitants, I leave them, and
will see what Fernando Fer. Alarchon
Alarchon can show us of his discovery. He was set forth by Antonio de Mendosa
the Viceroy, in the year of our lord 1540, with two ships. He came to the
bottom of the Bay of California, and there found a mighty river, which ran
with such surious violence, that they could scarce sail against ^. Here
leaving the ships with some of his company, he passed up with some pieces of
ordnance, and two boats: and so drawing the boats with hal^ers, they made up
the river called Buena Guia: they were incountered with the Indian Inhabitants,
who forbade them landing, but Alarchon hurling his weapons down, and pulling
out certain wares to give them, appeased their fury, and caused them also to
lay down their weapons, and receive of him some trifles, which he gave them.
Two leagues higher many Indians came and called to him: these were dec^^d after
a strange manner, some had painted their faces all over, some half way, others
had visards on with the shape of faces^: they had holes in their nosthrils,
whereat certain pendants hung, others ware shelles, having their ears full of
holes, with bones and shells hanging thereat. All of them ware a girdle about
their waste whereunto was fastened a bunch of feathers which hung down behind
like a tail. They carried with them bags of Tobacco. Their bodies were
traced with cole, their hair, cut before, hung down long behind. The women
ware bunches of feathers before and behind them. There were four men in women's
apparel. Alarchon perceived by signs, that the thing they most reverenced,
was the Sun, and therefore signified unto them, that he came from the Sun;
whereat they marvelled, and took curious view of him with greater reverence
then before; brought him abundance of food, first flinging up part of every
thing into the Air, and after, turning to him to give him the other part;
offering in their Arms to carry him into their houses, and doing else
whatsoever he would have them. And if any stranger came, they would go and
meet him, to cause him to lay down his weapons, and if he would not, they
would break them in pieces. He gave the chief of them small wares. They
needed not pray them to help draw the boat up the stream, every one labored
to get hold of the rope: otherwise it had been impossible to have gotten up
against the current. He caused Crosses to be made and given them, with
instruction to honor them, which they did with ecstasy of blind zeal,
kissing them, and lifting them up, every one coming for them till he had not
paper and sticks enough for that purpose.

And as he passed further, he met with one which understood his interpreter,
and asked of him many questions, to which he answered, that he was sent of the
Sun, which the other doubting, because the Sun went in the sky, he said
that at his going down and rising, he came near the Earth, and there made him
in that Land, and sent him hither to visit this River and the people, and to
charge them not to make further wars one upon another. But why says the
Indian did he send you no sooner? he answered because before he was but a
child. A long dialogue thus passed betwixt them, the issue whereof was that the
Indian cried out, they would all receive him for their Lord, seeing he was the
child of the Sun, and came to do them good. This use did he make of their
superstitious observation of the Sun, which they worshipped because he made
them warm (said they) and caused their croppe to grow, and therefore of all
things which they eat, they cast a little up into the air to him. They war
one upon an other (a thing common to all savages) for small occasions: the
eldest and most valiant guided the army (for in some places they had no Lord;)
and of those which they took in the war, some they burned, and from some
they plucked out the hearts, and eat them. Alarchon caused a Cross to be made
of timber, commanding his own people to worship it, and leaving it with the
Indians, with instructions every morning at the Sunne-rise to kneel before it.
This they took with great devotion, and would not suffer it to touch the
ground, until they knew it by questioning, how deep they should set it, with
what composition of gesture to worship it, and the like curiosities of Paganish
Christianity. He was told, that this river was inhabited by three and twenty
languages, that they married but one woman to one man, that maids before
marriage conuersed not with men, nor talked with them, but kept at home and
wrought: adultery was death: they burned the dead: widows stayed half a year
or a whole year before they married again. Every family had their several
governor, other Ruler they had none. The river used at sometimes to ouerflow
the banks. These people told Alarchon, that in Cevola they had many blew
stones, or turqueses, which they dug out of a rock of stone, and when their
Governors died, all their goods were buried with them: that they eat with
napkins, many waiting at table: that they killed the Negro before mentioned,
because he said he had many brethren, to whom they thought he would give
intelligence, and therefore killed him. An old man told him the names of two
hundred Lords and people of those parts. This old man had a son clothed in
woman's attire, of which sort they had four: these served to the Sodomites.
sodomitical lusts of all the unmarried yongmen in the country, and may not
themselves have to deal with any woman. They have no reward for this their
beaftial trade, but have liberty to go to any house for their food: when any of
them die, the first son that is borne after, succeeds in their number.

As for the more Northerly parts, both within Land, and the supposed Strait of
Anian, with other things mentioned in Mappes, because I know no certainty of
them, I leave them. The way by sea from these parts to the Philippinas, two of
our own Nation have passed, whose Voyage, Linschoten also in his third book
largely treats of the course of these and other Nauigations.
as also that exact Description of the same, by Franciscode Gualle, a Spanish
Captain and Pilot, Master Haklnit has related, who has in these, and other
labors of like nature, deeply engaged himself for his Countries good, and of
his Countri-men meriteth an everlasting name, and to me (though known at this
time, only by those portraitures of his industrious spirit) has been as
Admiral, holding out the light unto me in these seas, and as diligent a guide
by land, (which I willingly, yea dutifully, acknowledge) in a great part of
this my long and wearisome Pilgrimage.

CHAP. IX.
Of New Spain, and the conquest thereof by Hernando Cortes.

NOw are we safely arrived out of the South The Spaniards call all that the
South sea, which is on the otherside of America.
Sea, and North unknown Lands, where we have wildered our selves, and wearied
the Reader, in this great and spacious Country of New Spain. New Spain is
all that which lies between Florida and California, and confines on the
South, with Guatimala and Iucatan; how it came to be so called, asks a long
discourse, concerning the conquest thereof by Cortes, whose history is thus
related.

Hernando Gomara: the first part of the Conquest of the West Indies, translated
into English by T. Nicolas.
Cortes was borne at Medellin in Andulozia, a Province of Spain, An. 1485.
When he was nineteen years old he sailed to the Island of S. Domingo, where
Ouando the Governor kindly entertained him. He went to the conquest of Cuba in
the year 1511. as Clerk to the Treasurer, under the conduct of James
Velasques, who gave unto him the Indians of Manicorao, where he was the first
that brought up kine, sheep and mares, and had herds and flocks of them: and
with his Indians he gathered great quantity of gold, so that in short time he
was able to put in two thousand A Castlin is seven shillings and six pence, as
The. Nicolas the Translator says.
Castlins for his stock, with Andres de Duero a Merchant. At this time
Christopher Morante had sent ( Anno 1517.) Francis Hernandes de Cordona, who
first discovered Xucatan, whence he brought nothing (except the relation of
the Country) but stripes: whereupon James Velasques in the year 1518. sent
his kinsman John de Girialna, with two hundred Spaniards Of this Voyage, Read
P. Martyrs fourth Decade: and Gomara part. I. and of all which follows in this
Chapter.
in four ships: he traded in the River of Tauasco, and for trifles returned
much gold, and curious works of feathers, Idols of gold, a whole harness or
furniture for an armed man, of gold thin beaten, Eagles, Lions, and other
portaitures found in gold, etc. But while Girialua deferred his return,
Velasques agreed with Cortes to be his partner in the Discovery, which he
gladly accepted, and procured license from the Governors in Domingo, and
prepared for the Voyage.

Velasques afterward used all means to break off, in so much that Cortes was
forced to enlarge all his own stock, and credit, with his friends in the
expedition, and with five hundred and fifty Spaniards in eleven ships, set
sail the tenth of February 1519. and arrived at the Island of Acusamil. P.
Mart. Dec. 5. Gom. ubisupra, and Cortes his own letters to the Emperor.
The Inhabitants at first fled, but by the kind entertainment of some that
were taken, they returned, and received him and his with all kind offices.

They told him of certain bearded men in Yucatan, whither Cortes sent; and one
of them, Geronimo de Aguilar came unto him, who told him, that by shipwreck at
Iamaia, their Caruell being lost, twenty of them wandered in the boat without
sail, water, or bread, thirteen or fourteen days, in which space the violence
of the current had cast them on shore in a Province called Maija, where, as
they traveled, seven died with famine; and their Captain Valdinia and other
four were sacrificed to the Idols by the Cacike, or Lord of the Country, and
eaten in a solemn banquet, and he with six other were put into a coupe or
cage, to be fatned for another Sacrifice. But breaking prison, they escaped to
another Cacike, enemy to the former, where all the rest died, but himself, and
Gonsalo Guerrer a Mariner.

He had transformed himself into the Indian Cut, boring his nose full of
holes, his ears iagged, his face and hands painted, married a wife, and became
a Captain of name amongst the Indians, and would not return with this Aguilar.

Cortes with this new Interpreter passed up the River Tauasco, called of the
former Discouerer, Grijalua, where the Town that stood thereon, refusing to
victual him, was taken and sacked.

The Indians here with enraged, assembled an army of forty thousand, but
Cortes by his horse and Ordnance prevailed: the Indians thinking the Horse and
Rider had been but one Creature, whose gaping and swiftness was terrible unto
them, whereupon they submitted themselves.

When they heard the Horses ney, they had thought the horses could speak, and
demanded what they said: the Spaniards answered, these Horses are sore offended
with you, for fighting with them, and would have you corrected: the simple
Indians presented Roses and Hens to the beasts, desiring them to eat and to
pardon them.

Cortes purposed to discover further Westward, because he heard that there
were mines of gold, having first received their vassallage to the King his
Master, to whom (he said) the Monarchy of the Universal did appertain.

These were the first Vassals the Emperor had in New-Spaine. They named the
Town, where these things were done, Victory, before called Potonchan,
containing near five and twenty thousand houses, which are great, made of
lime, and stone, and brick, and some of mud-walls and rafters, covered with
straw; their dwelling is in the upper part of the house, for the moistness of
the soil. They did eat man's flesh sacrificed.

The Spaniards sailed Westward, and came to Saint John de Vlhna, where
Teudelli, the Governor of the Country, came to him with four thousand
Indians. He did his reverence to the Captain, burning Frankincense (after
their custom) and little Strawes, touched in the blood of his own body: and
then presented unto him Victuals, and Jewels of Gold, and other curious
works of Feathers; which Cortes requited with a Collar of Glass, and other
things of small value. A woman slave, given him at Potonchan, understood their
Language, and she, with Aguilar, were his interpreters.

Cortes professed himself the servant of a great Emperor, which had sent him
thither, whose power he so highly extolled, that Teudilli marvelled, thinking
there had been no such Prince in the world as his Master and Soucraigne, the
King of Mexico, whose Vassal he was, named Mutezuma. To him he sent the
representations of these bearded men, and their Horses, Apparel, Weapons,
Ordinance, and other rarities, painted in Cotton Clothes, their Ships, and
Numbers.

These painted Cottons he sent by Posts, which delivered them from one to
another with such celeritie, that in a day and night the message came to
Mexico, which was two hundred and ten miles distant. Cortes had demanded,
whether Mutezuma had Gold? Tendelli affirmed, and Cortes replied, That he and
his fellows had a disease of the heart, whereunto Gold was the best remedy.

Mutezuma sent him many Cotton clothes of diverse colors, many tuffes of
feathers, two wheels, the one of silver, with the sign of the Moon, and the
other of gold, made like the Sun, which they hold for Gods, and give unto
them the colors of the mettalls most like them. Every wheel was two yards and
a half broad. These with other parts, of the present were esteemed worth
twenty thousand Ducats.

Mutezuma also professed joy, to hear of so great a Prince, and so strange
people, and promised provision of all necessaries; but was very unwilling that
Cortes should come to see him, as he pretended. Yet Cortes persisted in that
his desire of seeing Mutezuma, that he might further acquaint himself with the
knowledge of those parts.

The silly Indians having never seen such strange sights, came daily to the
Camp to see them: and when they heard the Ordnance discharged, they fell down
flat, thinking the heavens had fallen: the ships they thought were the god of
the air, called Quezalcouolt, which came with the Temples on his back, for
they daily looked for him.

Amongst the rest, or rather aloof off from the rest, were certain Indians of
differing habit, higher then the other, and had the gristles of their noses
slit, hanging over their mouths, and rings of Iet and Amber hanging thereat:
their nether lips also bored, and in the holes rings of gold and
Turkesle-stones, which weighed so much, that their lips hung over their
chinnes, leaving their teeth bare. This ugliness they accounted gallantrie,
and such uncouth deformity to be the only bravery. And thou Gallant that
read and deridest this madness of Fashion, if thine eyes were not dazeled
with lightness (light I cannot call it) of selfe-reflected Vanity, might
see as Monster-like fashions at home, and more fashionly monster of thy self;
thy clothes and oaths, thy gestures and vestures, make thy naked Deformity
worse then their thus deformed nakedness: both indeed seem to have received
some hellish character (if there may be bodily representation) of that old
Serpent in thse new fashions, striving who shall shape himself nearest to that
misshapen ugliness, wherein the Indian iagges himself out of humane
lineaments, the other swaggers himself further out of all civil and Christian
ornaments. But these fashion-mongers have made me almost out of my fashion, and
to forget my self, in remembering their forgetfulness.

These Indians of this new Cut, Cortes caused to come to him, and learned that
they were of Zempoallan, a City distant thence a days journey, whom their
Lord had sent to see what Gods were come in those Teucallis, that is, Temples
(so, it seems, they called the ships:) which held no conversation with the
other Indians, as being not subject to Mutezuma, but only as they were holden
in by force. He gave them certain toys, and was glad to hear that the
Indians of Zempoallan, and other their neighbors were not well affected to
Mutezuma, but ready, as far as they durst, to entertain all occasions of
war with him.

He sailed from thence to Panuco, and passed the river farther, till he came to
a little Town, where was a Temple, with a little Tower, and Chapel on the
top, ascended by twenty steps, in which they found some Idols, many
bloody papers, and much man's blood, of those which had been sacrificed; he
block also whereon they cut open those Sacrifices, and the razors made of
flint, wherewith they opened their breasts, which struck the Spaniards with
some horror and fear. They passed a little further, and there having taken
possession, in the Emperors name, of the whole Country, they founded the
Town Delavera Crux, Cort^^ resigning his authority, and Officers being
elected; and lastly, all with general consent appointing Cortez their Captain.

Cortez went forward to Zempoallan, where he was solemnly received and lodged
in a great house of lime and stone, whited with plaster, that shined in the
Sun, as if it had been silver; so did the silver conceits of the Spaniards
imagine, the desire of that metal having made such an impression in their
imagination, that they told Cortes before he came at it, they had seen a
house with walls of silver.

Here, and at Chiauiztlan, Cortes incited them to rebel against Mutezuma, and
to become servants to the Spaniards, which they did; and he underhand so
wrought, that Mutezuma took him for his friend.

All his intent was to fish in troubled waters, and to set them both by the
ears, that he might watch opportunity to benefit himself. His own people
rebelled, some of whom he chastised with the halter and the whippe for example
to the rest: and after caused all his ships to be sunk closely, that they
should not mind any return. He left an hundred and fifty men for the guard
of the new Town, under Pedro de Henrico, and with four hundred Spaniards,
fifteen horses, and six pieces of Artillery, and thirteen hundred Indians,
they went from Zempoallan, and came to Zaclotan, the Lord whereof was Olintler
the subject of Mutezuma, who to testify his joy, and to honor Cortes,
commanded fifty men to be sacrificed, whose blood they saw new and fresh.

They carried the Spaniards on their shoulders, sitting on beeres, such as use
to carry dead men. He bragged as much of the power of Mutezuma, as the
Spaniards of their Emperor. He said he had thirty vassals, each of which was
able to bring into the field an hundred thousand men of war, and sacrificed
twenty thousand men yearly to the gods: in this he somewhat exceeded; the
other was true, although some years the sacrifices also were thought to amount
to fifty thousand.

This Town was great, and had thirteen Temples, in each of which were many
Idols of stone of diverse fashions, before whom they sacrificed men, Doves,
Quails, and other things with great perfumes and veneration.

Here Mutezuma had five thousand soldiers in garrison. Cortes passed from
thence to Mexico by the frontiers of Tlaxcallon, which were enemies to
Mutezuma, whom he might easily have overcome, but reserved partly for the
exercise of his subjects to the war, and partly for the sacrifices to his
gods.

These joined an hundred and fifty thousand men against Cortes, taking him for
Mutezuma's friend: and yet every day sent him Guinney-cockes and bread, partly
to epsy his strength, and partly in a bravery, lest their glory should be
obseured in the conquest of men already steruen.

But when in many skirmishes and fights they could not prevail against that
handful of Spaniards, they thought they were preserved from harm by
enchantments: and sent him three presents with this message; That if he were
that rigorous god which eats man's flesh, he should eat those five slaves
which they brought him, and they would bring him more: if he were the meek and
gentle god, behold frankincense, and feathers: if he were a mortal man, take
here foul, bread, and cherries. At last they made peace with him, and
submitted their City to him.

Their City Tlaxcallan was great, planted by a Rivers side, which issued into
the South Sea. It had four streets, each of which had their Captain in the
time of war. The government was an Aristocratie, hating Monarchy no less
then tyranny. It had eight and twenty Villages, and in them an hundred and
fifty thousand households, very poor, but good warriors. They had one
marketplace so spacious, that thirty thousand persons in a day came thither
to buy and sell by exchange: for money they had none.

Mutezuma had sent before to Cortes, and promised tribute to the Emperor,
whatsoever should be imposed; only he would not have him come to Mexico. And
now he sent again, that he should not trust that new friendship with the
beggarly Nation of Tlaxcallan, and they again counseled him not to adventure
himself to Mutezuma.

Cortes held his determination for Mexico, and being accompanied with many of
the Tlaxcantlexas he went to Chololla, a little from whence Mutezuma had
prepared an army to entrappe him in the way; but he finding the treachery, it
redounded upon Cholollois, the same day they had thought to have executed the
same upon him. For this end they had sacrificed ten children, five males, and
as many females, three years old, to Quezalcouatl their god, which was their
custom when they began their wars. He out-going them in their own art of
subtlety, entrapped their Captains in Counsel, and sent his army to spoil
the City, where were slain many thousands. There were twenty Gentlemen, and
many Priests which ascended up to the high Tower of their Temple, which had an
hundred and twenty steps, where they were burned, together with their gods
and Sanctuary.

This City had twenty thousand households within the walls, and as many in the
Suburbs. It showed outward very fair and full of Towers, for there were as
many Temples as days in the year, and every one had his Tower. The Spaniards
counted four hundred Towers. It was the City of most devotion in all India,
whither they traveled from many places far distant in Pilgrimage. Their
Cathedral Temple was the best and highest in all New Spain, with an hundred
and twenty steps up to it. Their chief god was Quezalcouatl, god of the
Air, who was (they say) founder of their City, being a Virgin, of holy life
and great penance. He instituted fasting, and drawing of blood out of their
ears and tongues, and left precepts of Sacrifices. He never ware but one
garment of Cotton, white, narrow, and long, and upon that a mantle, beset with
certain red crosses. They have certain green stones which were his, and are
kept for great relics: one of them is like an Apes head. Eight leagues from
Chololla is the hill Popocatepec, or smoake-hill, which the Earth seems to
have erected as a Fort to encounter and assault the air: now with smoakie
mists endeavoring to choke his purer breath, another while with violent
flames, and natural fire-workes threatening to join league with his elder and
superior brother to disinherit him: sometimes with showers of ashes and
imbers, as it were, putting out the eyes, and sometimes with terrible and
dreadful thunders, rending the ears of that Airy Element; always (such is
the event of war) hurting and wasting it self, to endamage the enemy.

The Indians thought it a place of Purgatory, whereby tyrannical and wicked
officers were punished after their death, and after that purgation passed into
glory.

The Spaniards adventured to see it, but two only held on their journey, and
had there been consumed, had they not by a rock been shadowed from the
violent eruption of the fire which then happened.

It chanced that the Earth, weary it seems of the war, as having spent her
store and munition, agreed on a truce which continued ten years: but in the
year 1540. it brake forth into more violent hostility then before, quaking
and renting it self with unbridled passion: and whereas the Air had always a
snowie garrison about her high tops, and frontires to cool and quench her
fiery showers, yet these did but kindle a greater flame, the ashes whereof came
to Huexozinco, Quelaxcopan, Tepiacac, Chololla and Tlaxcallan, and other
places, ten, or as some say, fifteen leagues distant, and burned their herbs
in their gardens, their fields of corn, trees, and clothes that they laid a
drying. The Vulean, Crater, or mouth whence the fire issued, is about half a
league in compass. The Indians kissed their garments (an honor done unto
their gods) which had adventured themselves to this dreadful spectacle.

Cortes drawing near to Mexico, Mutezuma feared, saying, These are the people
which our gods said should come and inherit this Land. He went to his Oratorie,
and there shut up himself alone, abiding eight days in prayer and fasting,
with Sacrifice of many men, to aslake the fury of his offended deities. The
Devil biddes him not to fear, and that he should continue those bloody Rites,
assuring him that he should have the gods Vitziliputzli and Tescatlipuca to
preserve him, saying, That Quezalcouatle permitted the destruction at Chololla,
for want of that bloody sacrifice. Cortes pasted a hill six miles in height,
where by the difficulty of the passage, and of the cold (being always covered
with snow) the Mexicans might easily have prevented his passing further. Hence
he espied the lake, whereon Mexico and many other great Towns did stand,
Iztacpallapan a Town of ten thousand households, Coyoacan of six thousand,
Vizilopuchtli of five thousand.

These Towns are adorned with many Temples and Towers, that beautify the
Lake. From Iztacpalapan to Mexico is two leagues, all on a fair causey, with
many draw-bridges, through which the water passes, Mutezuma received Cortes
with all solemnity on the eight of November 1519. into this great City,
excusing himself of former unkindness the best he could. Of his house, and
Majesty, and the divine conceit the people had of him, we shall speak after
more fully, as also of the Temples, Priests, Sacrifices and other remarkable
things of Mexico.

Mutezuma provided all things necessary for the Spaniards and Indians that
attended them: even beds of flowers were made, in place of litter for their
horses. But Cortes disquieted with those thoughts which commonly attend
Ambition, discontent in the present, hopes and fears of the future, used the
matter so, that he took Mutezuma prisoner, and detained him in the place
appointed for the Spaniards lodging; with a Spanish guard about him, permitting
him otherwise to deal in all private or public affairs, as before. Hereupon
Cacama, Lord of Tezcuco, nephew to Mutezuma, rebelled, but by treachery of his
own people was presented prironer to Mutezuma. He, after this, summoned a
Parliament, where he made an Oration unto his subjects, saying, That he and his
predecessors were not naturalls of the Country, but his forefathers came
from a far Country; and their King returned again, and said, he would send
such as should rule them. And he has now sent these Spaniards, says he.
Hereupon he counseled them to yield themselves vassals to the Emperor, which
they did at his command, though with many tears on his part and theirs, at
this farewell of their liberty. Mutezuma presently gave to Cortes, in the name
of tribute, great quantity of gold and other jewels, which amounted to
sixteen hundred thousand Castlins of gold, besides silver.

Cortes had hitherto a Continual victory in Mexico without any fight: but
news was brought him of Pamphilo de Naruais, who was sent with eighty horse,
and some hundreths of Spaniards by Velasques, to interrupt the proceedings of
Cortes: who leaving two hundred men in Mexico, with two hundred and fifty
other came suddenly in the night, and took Naruaes Prisoner, and returned to
Mexico with Naruaes his company, now his followers also, where he found his men
exceedingly distressed by the Citizens, for a murder committed in the great
Temple at a solemn Feast, where in a religious dance, they were slain, for
the rich garments and jewels they ware, by the Spaniards.

Cortes came in good time for the relief of his men: and Mutezuma caused the
Mexicans to bridle their rage, which presently was renewed, and when Mutezuma
was again by his guardians, the Spaniards, caused to speak to the people: a
blow of a stone on his temples wounded him, whereof three days after he died.

Cortes had some thousands of the Tlaxoltecas to help him, but was driven to
flee from Mexico with all his Spaniards and Indians, which he did closely in
the night, but yet an alarm was raised, and the bridges being broken, much
slaughter of his people was made by the Mexicans, and all his treasure in
manner lost. They pursued after him also, and had two hundred thousand in the
field: when it was Cortes his good hap to slay the Standard Bearer, whereupon
the Indians forsook the field. This battle was fought at Otumpan.

At Tlazcallan, he and his were kindly entertained; they had prepared before
fifty thousand men to go to Mexico for his help, and now they promised him
all offices of loyalty and services. With their help he subdued Tepeacac: and
built certain Brigandines, or Frigates, which were carried many leagues on the
backs of those Indians, and there fastened and finished, without which he
could never have won Mexico.

In Tezcuco certain Spaniards had been taken, sacrificed and eaten, which
Cortes now revenged on them. Eight thousand men had carried the loose pieces
and timber of this Navy, guarded with twenty thousand Tlaxcallans, and a
thousand Tamemez or Porters, which carried victuals attending. They caiked
them with Tow, and for want of Tallow. ^^^-Oyle, they used man's grease, of such
as had been slain in the wars. Fo^^^^^ the Indians used to take out the
grease of their sacrifices. Cortes had here nine hundred Spaniards, of which
fourscore and six were horsemen, three cast pieces of iron, fifteen small
pieces of brass, and a thousand weight of powder, and 100000. Indian soldiers
on his side. He made a sluice or trench above twelve foot broad, and two fathom
deep, half a league long, in which 40000 men wrought fifty days. He
launched his Vessels, and soon overcame all the Canoas of the Lake, of which
were reckoned in all five thousand. The Spaniards brake the Conduits of sweet
water, wherewith the City was wont to be served. Quahutimoc, now the new King
of Mexico, receiving encouragement from the devilish Oracle, caused to break
down the Bridges, and to exercise whatsoever wit or strength could do in
defense of his City, sometimes conquering, sometimes (as is the doubtful
chance of war) conquered. Cortes had in Tezcuco ordained a new King, a
Christian Indian, of the royal blood, who much assisted him in this siege. The
Spaniards being Lords of the Lake, and of the Causeyes, by help of their
Galliots and Ordinance, they fired a great part of the City. One day the
Mexicans had gotten some advantage, and thereupon celebrated a Feast of
Victory. The Priests went up into the Towers of Tlatelulco, their chief
Temple, and made their perfumes of sweet Gummes, in token of victory, and
sacrificed forty Spaniards, which they had taken captives, opening their
breasts, and plucking out their hearts for offerings to their Idols, sprinkling
their blood in the Air, their fellows looking on, and not able to revenge it.
They slew likewise many Indians, and four Spaniards of Alvarado's company,
whom they ate in the open sight of the Army. The Mexicans daunced, drank
themselves drunk, made bone-fires, struck up their Drums, and made all
solemn expressings of joy. Dread, Disdain, and all the Furies that passion or
compassion could conjure up, had now filled the Spaniards hearts and their
Indian partakers: and Cortes, that hitherto had hoped to reserve some part of
the City, now did the utmost that Rage and Revenge could effect, helped no
less within with Famine and Pestilence, then with Sword and Fire without. At
last Mexico is rased, the Earth and Water sharing betwixt them what the Fire
had left, and all which had sometime challenged a lofty inheritance in the
Air. Their King also was taken; all that mighty State subverted: and as the
Mexicans before had prophesied, That the Tlaxantleca's should again build the
City, if conquered, for them; if conquerors, for the Spaniards. It was
re-builded with a hundred thousand houses, fairer and stronger then before. The
Siege lasted three months, and had therein two hundred thousand Indians, nine
hundred Spaniards, fourscore Horses, seventeen Pieces of Ordinance, thirteen
Galliots, and six thousand Cannons. Fifty Spaniards were slain, and six
Horses: of the Mexicans a hundred thousand, besides those which died of Hunger
and Pestilence. This was effected Anno 1521, on the thirteenth of August, which
for that cause is kept festival every year.

CHAP. X.
Of the ancient inhabitants of New Spain, and the History of their Kings.

Having now declared the subversion of this State and Kingdom by the
Spaniards, I hold it not amiss to look back unto the first people which here
inhabited, with the beginnings and proceedings of the Mexican Empire. The
Botero, part. ^^.
first inhabitants of New Spain were very barbarous and savage, which ^^^ed
only by Hunting, and for this reason were called Chieh^^ ^^^. Ies Acosta, l.7.
Lop de Gom part. 1.
They lived naked, solitary in the Mountains, without Tillage, Policy or any
Religious Ceremonies: their wives followed the same Hunting exercise, leaving
their children tied in a Panier of Reeds to the boughs of some Tree. They did
eat what they got in Hunting, raw. They eat also Snakes and Lizards, which
they offered likewise in sacrifice to the Sun, whom only they worshipped,
and that without any Image: they offered to him Fowls, from the Butterfly to
the Eagle. And some remnants of the like beastly men are yet found, which do
great hurt, and will not, by either cunning or force of the Spaniards, be
reduced to any other course. They seem to have learned the savage nature of
the wild Beasts, of whom and with whom they live. By this means it came to
pass, that this wild mountainous people left the best and most fertile part
of the Country unpeopled, which certain remote Nations possessed, whom they
called Nauatalcas signifies wellspeakers.
Navatalcas, for their civility. These came from those Northern parts, which
now they call New Mexico. The Navatalcas paint their beginning and first
Territory in manner of Caves (because of their seven Tribes) and men coming
out of them. By the supputation of their Books this departure was above eight
hundred years since, and (by reducing to our account) about the year of our
Lord 720. Fourscore years they stayed on the way, the cause whereof they
ascribe to their Gods, which spoke visibly to them, and bad them seek new
Lands that had such signs as they notified.

Thus they proceeded in seeking those signs, and peopled the best parts, still
removing their habitations as they found more fertile Countries, leaving only
the aged, sick, and weary, with a few others to remain in the former. And by
these leisurely proceedings they entered the Land of Mexico, about the year
902, after our account. Those seven Nations came not all at once; but first the
Suchimilcos, next the Chalcas, and thirdly the Tepanetans, fourthly those of
Tescuco, after them the Tlalluicans: the sixth were the Tlascaltecans, which
helped the Spaniards to conquer Mexico, and therefore are exempted from tribute
to this day. These expelled, as their Histories say, certain Giants, whom in
pretense of friendship they had invited to a banquet, and in their drunkenness
stole away their weapons, and slew them. Neither does this seem a fable; for
at this day are found dead men's bones, of incredible bigness. I saw a tooth
(says Acosta) at Mexico, in the year 1586, as big as the fist of a man, and
according to this, all the rest was proportionable. Three hundred and two
years after the first transmigration, those of the seventh Cave or Line
arrived, which is the Mexican Nation: they worshipped the Idol Vitzliputzli,
and the Devil spoke and governed this Nation. He promised to make them Lords
over all, which the other six Nations possessed, and to give them a Land
plentiful in riches: whereupon they went forth, carrying their Idol with them
in a Coffer of Reeds, supported by four of their principal Priests, with
whom he talked, and communicated his Oracles and Directions. He likewise gave
them Laws, and taught them the Ceremonies and Sacrifices they should observe.
And even as the pillar of Cloud and Fire conducted the Israelites in their
passage through the Wilderness, so this apish Devil gave them notice when to
advance forwards, and when to stay. The first thing they did wheresoever they
came, was to build a house or Tabernacle for their Vitzliputzli, which they set
always in the midst of their Camp, and there placed the Arc in the midst
of the Altar. This done, they sowed the Land, and if their God commanded to
gather, they did so, and if, to raise their Camp, they obeyed, leaving the
aged, ticke, and weary, to gather the fruits, and to dwell there. The chief
Captain whom they followed was called Moxi, whence came the name of their
Mexico and Mexicans.
City and Nation. Their Idol persuaded them, when some were bathing
themselves in certain Lakes, to remove the Camp closely, and steal away
their clothes: whereat they which were thus forsaken, changed their language
and manner of life, retaining always their hatred to the Mexicans. They peopled
the Province Mechouacan, From hence to Mexico is fifty leagues, and upon the
way is Malinalco, which they say was peopled by a Witch and her family, whom by
the commandment of their god they left behind, closely removing the army by
night. They stayed in a place called Tuta, where by stopping a River, they
drowned a Plain, and planted it round with Willowes and other Trees; and many
liking the place, talked of staying there: whereat their God offended,
threatened the Priests, and in the night slew those which had consulted of
staying. Their hearts were found pulled out, and their stomachs opened, which,
after that, they observed in their Sacrifices. The Mexicans, by the advice of
their Idol, proceeded, and by force made way through the Chalcas, and sent to
the Lord of Culhuacan, who granted them the place of Ticaapan to dwell in,
which was full of Snakes and venomous Beasts, which by the help of their God
they tamed. He would not suffer them to stay there, but commanded them to
proceed, and to seek forth a woman, whom they should name the Goddess of
Discord. Whereupon they sent to the King of Culhuacan, to demand his daughter
to be Queen of the Mexicans, and mother of their God; who easily condescended,
and sent his daughter gorgeously attyred. The same night she arrived, by order
of their God, she was murdered, and flayed, and a young man was covered with
her skin, with her apparel thereon, and being placed near the Idol, was
consecrated a Goddess, and mother of their God, ever after worshipping the
same, making an Idol which they call Toccy, that is, our Grandmother. The King
of Culhuacan hereupon warred against them, and chased them out of those parts,
by which means they came to the place where Mexico now is. Here certain old
Priests or Sorcerers entering into a place full of Water Lillies, they met with
a very fair and clear current of Water, with Trees, Meadows, Fish, and other
things, all very white, which were the signs their God had given them of their
promised Land. In the night following, Vitzliputzli appeared in a dream to an
ancient Priest, saying, That they should go seek out a Tunal in the Lake,
which grew out of a stone, upon which they should see an Eagle feeding on small
Birds, which they should hold for the place where their City should be built,
to become famous through the world. Hereupon the next day they all assembled,
and dividing themselves into bands, made that search with great diligence and
devotion.

In their search they met with the former watercourse, not white (as it was
then) but red like blood, dividing it self into two streams, one of which
was an obscure Azure. At last they espied the Eagle with wings, displayed
toward the Sun, compassed about with many rich feathers of diverse colors,
and holding in his Tallons a goodly bird. At this sight they fell on their
knees, and worshipped the Eagle, with great demonstrations of joy and thanks
to Vitzliputzli. For this cause they called the City, which there they
founded, Mexico Tenoxtiltan.
Tenoxtiltan, which signifies, Tunal on a stone; and to this day carry in
their Arms an Eagle upon a Tunal, with a bird in his Tallon.

The next day following, by common consent, they made an Heremitage, adjoining
to the Tunal of the Eagle, that the Arc of their God might rest there, till
they might have means to build him a sumptuous Temple. This they made of
Flagges and Turfes, covered with Straw. Afterward they consulted to buy of
their neighbors Stone, Timber, Lime, in exchange of Fish, Fowls, Frogs, and
other things which they hunted for in the Lake: by which means they procuring
necessaries, built a Chapel of Lime and Stone, and labored to fill up part
of the Lake with rubbish. The Idol commanded, that they should divide
themselves into four principal quarters about this house, and each part build
therein: to which he enjoined certain Gods of his appointment, called
Calpultetco, which is, Quarter-Gods. This was the beginning of Mexico.

This division seemed not equal to some of the Ancients, who valued their
deserts far above their allotted portion, who therefore separated themselves,
and went to Tlatedulco: whose practices against the Mexicans caused them to
choose a King, to which Soueraignetie was chosen Acamapitzli, Nephew to the King
of Culhuacan, and of the Mexican blood by the fathers side. Him by embassage
they demanded, and obtained in the name of their God, with this answer from
the King of Culhuacan: Let my grandchild go to serve your God, and be his
Lieutenant, to rule and govern his creatures, by whom we live; who is the
Lord of Night, Day, and Winds: Let him go and be Lord of the Water and Land,
and possess the Mexican Nation, etc.

He was solemnly welcomed by the Mexicans: Welcome them art (says an Many
of these Orations are expressed in Acosta's seventh book at large, full of
witty inventions and Rhetorical flourishes.
Orator unto him in their name) to this poor House and City, amongst these
Weeds and Mudde, where thy poor Fathers, Grandfathers, and Kinsfolks endure
what it pleases the Lord of things created. Remember Lord, thou come to be
our defense, and to be the resemblance of our Vitzliputzli, not to rest thy
self, but to endure a new charge: with many words of that effect, expressed in
the Mexican Histories, reserved by tradition; the children to that end learning
them by heart, and these being as presidents to them which learned the Art
Oratorie. After this, they were sworn, and he crowned. The Crown was like
that of the Dukes of Venice. His name Acamapixtli signifies a handful of
Reeds, and therefore they carry in their Armories a hand, holding many
Arrows of Reeds.

The Mexicans at this time were tributaries to the Tapanccans, whose chief
City was Azcapuzalco: who judging, according to the nature of Envy and
Suspicion, that they were so much weaker, how much the stronger they saw their
neighbors, thought to oppress them by a strange policy, in imposing an
uncouth, and (in show) impossible tribute: which was, that they should bring
the Tapunecan King a Garden, planted and growing in the water.

In this their distress, Vitzliputzli taught them to do it, by casting earth
upon Reeds and Grass laid in the Lake, and planting in this moving Garden
Maiz, Figs, Gourds, and other things, which at the time appointed they
carried growing and ripe: a thing often since proved in that Lake, emulous no
less of that glory, to be accounted one of the Wonders in that New World,
then those pensill Gardens, towred up in the Air at Babylon, both here and
there the reason of man, according to his natural privilege, subiecting to
his use the most rebellious Elements of Air and Water.

Acamapixtli, the Mexican King, after he had reigned forty years, died,
leaving it to their choice to choose his successor. They chose his son
Vitzilovitli, which signifies a rich Feather: They anointed him with an
Ointment, which they call Divine, being the same where with they anoint their
Idol.

Of their Coronation thus Lop de Gom. part.I.
Lopez de Gomara says, That this was done by the High Priest, attyred in his
Pontificalibus, attended with many others in Surplices, the Ointment was as
black as Ink. They blessed him, and sprinkled him four times with holy
Water, made at the time of the consecration of their God. Then they put upon
his head a Cloth, painted with the bones and skulls of dead men, clothed him
with a black garment, and upon that a blew, both painted with figures of
Skulls and Bones. Then did they hang on him Laces, and bottles of Pouders,
whereby he was delivered from diseases and Witchcrafts. Then did he offer
Incense to Vitzliputzli, and the High Priest took his Oath, for the
maintenance of their Religion; to maintain Justice, and the Laws; to cause
the Sun to give his light, and the Clouds to rain, and the Earth to be
fruitful, etc. Lastly, followed the acclamations of the people, crying, GOD
save the King, with daunces, etc.

He being crowned, and having received homage of his subjects, obtained the
King of Azcapuzalco his daughter to wife, by whom he had a son called
Chimalpopoca, and procured a relaxation of tribute from his father in law. He
was devout in his superstitions: having reigned thirteen years, he died. His
son then but ten years old, was chosen in his room, but was soon after
slain by the inhabitants of Azcapuzalco. The Mexicans enraged with this
injury, assembled themselves, and an Orator, among many other words tells
them, That the Sun is eclipsed and darkened for a time, but will return
suddenly in the choice of another King. They agreed upon Izcoalt, which
signifies a Snake of Rasors, the source of Acamapixtls their first King. The
common people were earnest with this new King for peace with the Tapanecans,
for the obtaining whereof they would carry their God in his Litter for an
intercessor. This was hindered by Tlacaellec the Kings Nephew, a resolute and
valiant young man, who also, with peril of his life, undertook an Embassage
to Azcapuzalco, and there defied the King, anointing him with the ointment of
the dead, after their manner. The commons of Mexico were herewith offended, and
to pacify them, the King indented with them, That if he lost the Field, they
should eat him and his Nobles: they on the other side promising, if he did
overcome, to become his tributaries (for before they enjoyed much freedom) and
to labor in his Fields and Houses, and to become his servants in War and
Peace. In fine, such was the valor of Tlacaellec the General, that the
enemies were overthrown, their City sacked, and the remainder of them made
tributarie, the lands and goods of the conquered being divided among the
Conquerours, and some reserved to each quarter of Mexico, for the use of their
Sacrifices.

Cuyacan had the next place in the Mexican Conquests: who having invited the
Mexicans to a banquet, in the end thereof sent for the last Service, women's
habites, which they forced them to put on: but Izcoalt and Tlacaellec made them
know, by their ruin, the manhood of the Mexicans. They subdued also the
Suchimilcos, and Cuitlavaca, a City in the Lake; Teseuco yielded it self.
Izcoalt after twelve years died, and Motecuma the first was chosen in his
stead.

Presently after his Election they conducted him to the Temple with a great
train, where, before the Divine Harth-(so called in regard of the continual
fire there kept) they enthronized him. The King there drew blood from his ears
and legs with a Griffons tallons as a Sacrifice, and was congratulated with
many Orations of the Priests, Ancients, and Captains. And whereas before they
had accustomed, in their Elections, to make great Feasts and Daunces, and
wasted many Lights; He brought in the custom, personally to make war in some
Province, thence to procure Sacrifices, to feast their Gods and men. This he
performed at Chalco, from whence he brought many Captives, which on the day of
his Coronation were sacrificed and eaten.

At this Feast all his Tributes were brought in with great solemnity, each
Province marching by it self, besides innumerable Presents. All comers were
bountifully entertained, and the poor were clad with new garments, given them
by the King. The Chalcas had taken a brother of Motecuma, and would have made
him their King, but he enioyning them to make a high Scaffold, ascended
thereon, and telling them, the Gods would not permit, that to be a King, he
should be a traitor unto his Country, cast down himself; whose death
Motecuma revenged with the ruin of that whole Nation, conquering further unto
the North and South Seas, by the counsel and courage of Tlacaellec. This King
instituted new Ceremonies, and increased the number of the Priests: he built
the great Temple of Vitzliputzli and sacrificed great numbers of men at the
dedication. Having reigned eight and twenty years, he died.

Tlacaellec was chosen his successor by the four Deputies, and the two Lords
of Tescuco and Tacuba (these were the Electors) but refused the Empire, as
being fitter for the common good, as an instrument to another, then if himself
welded the Scepter. At his nomination they chose Ticocic; son of the late
King, and piercing his nosthrills, for an ornament put an Emerald therein. He,
in seeking captives for the solemnity of his Coronotion, lost more of his own
people, and after four years was poisoned by his male content subjects.

Axayaca his brother succeeded, altogether of another spirit. In his time died
Tlacaellec, chief author of the Mexican greatness, whom before in his age
they used to carry in his Chair, on men's shoulders, to council. He was
buried more solemnly then any of the Kings, and his son was made General for
the wars. Axayaca conquered Tequantepec, two hundred leagues from Mexico,
thence to furnish the bloody solemnities of his Coronation. He added to his
Conquests Guatulco on the South Sea: in single combat overcame the Lord of
Tlarelulco, and subdued those Mexican-enemies of the Mexicans, setting fire on
their City and Temple. After eleven years he died, and Antzal the eight King
was chosen. He punished the pride of Quaxulatlan, a rich Province, with those
captives, to celebrate his Coronation-Feast, and extended his dominion to
Guatimala, three hundred leagues from Mexico. He much adorned his Royal
City, pulling down the old houses, and in their room erected fairer. He let
in a course of water to the City, because that of the Lake was muddie. But
because they of Cuyoacan used these waters, the chief man of that City, which
was a great Magician, sought to hinder it, whereby the King being provoked,
sent to attach him. He escaped by his Protean Arts; now appearing like an
Eagle, the second time like a Tygre, the third like a Serpent. But at last he
was taken and strangled, and the Mexicans forced a Channel, whereby the water
might pass to their City, the Priests meane-while casting Incense on the
banks, sacrificing the blood of Quails; others winding their Cornets: and one
of the chief went attyred in a habit like to the Goddess of the Waters,
which was saluted and welcomed by all the people. All which things are painted
in the Annals of Mexico: which Book is now in the Vatican Library at Rome.
Thus he environed the City with water like another Venice; and having reigned
eleven years, died.

Motecuma the second was chosen, who before his Sovereignty was of grave and
stayed disposition, much addicted to his devotions. He retired himself into a
Chapel, appointed for him in the Temple of Vitzliputzli, where (they say) the
Idol spoke to him; wherein also he hid himself, after he had intelligence
of this Election. From thence he was led to the Harth of their Gods, where he
sacrificed, with drawing blood from his ears and the calves of his legs.
They attired him with the royal ornaments, and piercing his nosthrills, hung
there at a rich Emerald. Being seated in his Throne, the King of Tescuco, one
of the Electors; made an eloquent Oration, which Joseph Lib. 7. c.20.
Acosta has set down word by word, and-deserued a room here, if our hasty
Pilgrimage would suffer.

This Motecuma commanded, That no Plebeian should serve him in any Office in
his House, providing Knights and Nobles for that purpose. His Coronation was
solemnized with Dances, Comedies, Banquets, Lights, and other pomp: the
sacrificed captives were of a far Province toward the North Sea, which he
subdued. Mechovacan, Tlascalla, and Tapeaca never yielded to the Mexicans;
which Motecuma told Cortes, that he spared for the use of his sacrifices, and
the exercise of his soldiers. He labored to be respected and worshipped as a
God. It was death for any Plebeian to look him in the face: He never set his
foot on the ground, but was always carried on the shoulders of Noblemen; and
if he lighted, they laid rich Tapestrie, whereon he did go. He never put on
one Garment twice, nor used one Vessel, or Dish, above once. He was rigorous
in execution of his Laws, and for that purpose would disguise himself, to see
how they were executed, and offer bribes to the Judges, to provoke them to
injustice; which, if they accepted, cost them their lives, though they were his
kinsmen, or brethren. His fall is before declared: it shall not be amiss here
to mention some prodigious forerunners of the same. The Idol of Cholola,
called Quetzacoalt, declared, That a strange people came to possess his
Kingdom. The King of Tescuco, a great Magician, and many Sorcerers, told him
as much. The King shut up the Sorcerers in prison, where they vanished
presently: wherefore he exercised that rage on their wives and children, which
he had intended against them. He sought to appease his angry Gods by
Sacrifices, and therefore would have removed a great stone, which by no humane
industry would be moved, as refusing his atonement. Strange voices were
heard, accompanied with Earthquakes and swellings of the waters. A prodigious
Bird, of the bigness of a Crane, was taken, which on his head had (as it were)
a Glass representing armed men, and in the Kings presence vanished. A stranger
thing befell a poor man, who was taken up by an Eagle, and carried into a
certain Cave, where he let him down, pronouncing these words; Most mighty
Lord, I have brought him whom thou have commanded. There he saw one like the
King, lying asleep; touching whom having received threatening Prophesies, he
was again by that former Pursuiuant placed where he had been taken up. These
things, as deuillish illusions, abusing GODS Providence and Justice, and
Imitating his Power, to rob him of his glory, deserve to be mentioned.

Mutecuma having intelligence of Cortes his arrival, was much troubled, and
conferring with his Counsel, they all said, that without doubt their great and
ancient Lord Queztzalcoalt who had said, that he would return from the East
whither he was gone, had now fulfilled his promise and was come. Therefore did
he send Ambassadors with presents unto Cortes, acknowledging him for
Queztzalcoalt, (sometime their Prince, now esteemed a God) and himself his
Lieutenant.

Concerning the State of Mexico under the Spaniards, Robert R. Tompson ap. Hak.
Tomson who was there about the year 1555. says, that then it was thought
there were a thousand and five hundred households of Spaniards, and above three
hundred thousand Indians. The H. Haukss dp. Hak. lab. Hortop.
City is environed with a Lake, and the Lake also with Mountains about
thirty leagues in compass; the raines falling from these Hills cause the lake.

In this City resideth the Viceroy, and here the highest Indian Courts are
kept. There are weekly three faires or markets, abounding with plenty of
commodities at a cheap price. Many Rivers fall into the Lake, but none go
out. The Indians know how to drown the City, and would have practiced it, had
not the Conspirators been taken and hanged. The Indians here are good
Artificers, Gold-smithes, Coppersmithes, Black-smithes, Carpenters,
Shooe-makers, Tailors, Sadlers, Embroderers, and of all other sciences, and
work exceeding cheap, living of a little. They will go two or three leagues
to a Fair, carrying not above a pennyworth of commodities, and yet maintain
themselves thereby.

Miles Miles Philips.
Philips says, that when Sr.Francis Drake was on the South Sea, the Viceroy
caused a general muster to be made of all the Spaniards in Mexico, and found
above seven thousand households, and three thousand single men, and of Mestizoes
twenty thousand.

Mr. Chiltou John Chilton.
testifies, that every Indian pays tribute to the King twelve Realls of
Plate, and a Hauneg of Maiz, (five Haunegs make a quarter English) and every
Widow half so much. And all their children, above fifteen years old, pay
after the same rate. He has great gain by his fifths, and by the Popes Bulls:
this leaden ware was worth to the King at first above three Millions of gold
yearly. The greatness of exactions caused two rebellions whiles he was there,
and the King will not suffer them to have Oil or Wine there growing, although
the earth would prodigally repay them, that they may still have need of
Spain. Tlaxcalla, for their merits in the conquest of Mexico, as before is
showed, is free: only they pay a handful of wheat a man in sign of
subjection: but some later encrochers have forced them to till at their own
charge as much ground as their tribute would amount to. There are in it two
hundred thousand Indians.

Some of the wild people in New Spain are deadly enemies to the Spaniards, and
eat as many as they get of them. John Chilton fell into their hands, but being
sick and lean, they thought (as a captive wench told him) that he had the
Pox, and was but unwholesome food, and so let him depart. It is an ill wind
that blows none to good: sickness, the harbenger of death, was to him
preserver of life.

Universities of Europe. This University was Gasp.^^.l.2

Fountains, one of black pitch, the other of red, very hot. To speak largely
of New Galicia, Mechuacan, Guaste can, and other Regions, would not be much to
the Readers delight, and less to my purpose.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Idols and Idolatrous sacrifices of New Spain.

THe Indians (as Acosta Natural and moral Hist. of the Indies. lib.5. cap.3.
observes) had no name proper unto God, but use the Spanish word Dios fitting
it to the accent of the Cuscan or Mexican tongues. Yet did they acknowledge a
supreme power, called Vitziliputzli, terming him the Most puissant, and Lord of
all things, to whom they erected at Mexico the most sumptuous Temple in the
Indies. After the Supreme God they worshipped the Sun, and therefore called
Cortes (as he writ to the Emperor) Son of the Sun. That Vitziliputzli
Hernando Cortes. Acost. l. 5.c.9.
was an Image of wood, like to a man, set upon an Azure-coloured stool in a
brankard or litter; at every corner was a piece of wood like a Serpents head.
The stool signified that he was set in heaven. He had the forehead Azure, and
a band of Azure under the nose, from one ear to the other. Upon his head he
had a rich plume of feathers, covered on the top with gold: he had in his left
hand a white target, with the figures of five Pine Apples, made of white
feathers, set in a Cross; and from above issued forth a crest of gold: At his
sides he had four Darts, which, the Mexicans say, had been sent from heaven.
In his right hand he had an Azured staff, cut in fashion of a wauing Snake.
All these ornaments had their mystical sense. The name of Vitziliputzli
signifies the left hand of a shining feather. He was set upon an high Altar in
a small box, well covered with linen clothes, jewels, feathers, and
ornaments of gold: and for the greater veneration he had always a curtain
before him. Joining to the Chapel of this Idol, there was a pillar of less
work and not so well beautified, where there was another Idol called Tlaloc.
These two were always together, for that they held them as Companions, and of
equal power. There was an other Idol in Mexico much esteemed, which was the
Gemor part 1 calls him the God of Providence.
God of Repentance, and of Jubilees and Pardons for their sins. He was called
Tezcallipuca, made of a black shining stone, attyred after their manner, with
some Ethnike devises: it had eare-rings of gold and silver, and through the
nether lip a small Canon of Crystal, half a foot long, in which they
sometimes put an Azure feather, sometimes a green, so resembling a Turqueis or
Einerald: it had the hair bound up with a haire-lace of gold, at the end
whereof did hang an ear of gold, with two firebrarnds of smoke painted
therein, signifying that he heard the prayers of the afflicted, and of sinners.
Betwixt the two ears hung a number of small Herons. He had a jewel hanging at
his neck, so great that it covered all his stomach: upon his arms, bracelets
of gold; at his nauill a rich green stone, and in his left hand a fan of
precious feathers of green, azure, and yellow, which came forth of a looking
glass of gold, signifying that he saw all things done in the world. In his
right hand he held four Darts as the ensigns of his justice, for which cause
they feared him most. At his festival they had pardon of their sins. They
accounted him the God of Famine, drought, barrennesle, and pestilence. They
painted him in another form, sitting in great majesty on a stool, compassed
in with a red Cu^^in, painted and wrought with the heads and bones of dead men.
In the lest hand was a Target with five Pines, like unto Pine-Apples, of
Cotton; and in the right hand a little Dart, with a threatening countenance, and
the arm stretched out, as if he would call it: and from the Target came four
Darts. The countenance expressed anger, the body was all painted black, and
the head full of quails feathers. Quecalc uatl was their God of the Air.

In Cholula Cholula.
they worshipped the God of Merchandise, called Quetzaalcoalt, which had the
form of a man, but the visage of a little Bird with a red bill, and above, a
comb full of warts, having also ranks of teeth, and the tongue hanging out. It
carried on the head a pointed Mitre of painted paper, a sith in the hand, and
many toys of gold on the legs: it had about it gold, silver, jewels,
feathers, and habits of diverse colors: and was set aloft in a spacious place
in the Temple. All this his furniture was significant. The name imports
Color of a rich feather. No marvel if this God had many suitors, seeing Gain
is both God and godliness to the most; the whole world admiring and adoring
this Mammon or Quitzaalcoalt. Tlaloc was their God of water: to whom they
sacrificed for rain.

They had also their Goddesses Gomara part. 1.
, the chief of which was Toz^. which is to say, Our Grandmother, of which is
spoken before; she was flaied by the command of Vitziliputzli, and from hence
they learned to flay men in sacrifice, and to cloth the living with the skins
of the dead. One of the Goddesses, which they worshipped, had a son who was a
great hunter, whom they of Tlascalla afterward took for a God; being
themselves addicted much to that exercise. They therefore made a great feast
unto this Idol as shall after follow.

They had an other strange kind of Idol which was not an Image, but a true
Man. For they took a captive, and before they sacrificed him they gave him the
name of the Idol, to whom he should be sacrificed, apparrelling him also with
the same ornaments. And during the time that this representation lasted (which
was for a year in some feasts, six months in some, in others less) they
worshipped him in the same manner, as they did their God; he in the mean time
eating, drinking, and making merry. When he went through the streets, the
people came forth to worship him, bringing their alms, with children and sick
folks, that he might cure and bless them, suffering him to do all things at
his pleasure; only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men, lest he should
flee. And he (to the end he might be reverenced as he passed) sometimes
sounded on a small flute. The feast being come, this fat fool was killed,
opened, and eaten.

Lopes Lop. de Gom. part.1.
de Gomara writes, that the Mexicans had two thousand Gods They had their
Venus, and their Bacchus, and Mars, and other such Deities in Mexican
appellations, as the Heathen Greeks and Romans, as after shall appear.
, but the chief were Vitziliputzli and Tezcatlipuca. These two were accounted
brethren: There was an other God who had a great Image placed on the top of the
Idols chapel, made all of that Country seeds, ground, and made into past,
tempered with childrens blood, and Virgins sacrificed, whose hearts were
plucked out of their opened breasts, and offered as first fruits to that Idol.
It was consecrated by the Priests with great solemnity, all the Citizens being
present, many devout persons sticking in the dowie Image gold and jewels:
after which consecration no secular person may touch that Image, nor come in
his Chapel. They renew this Image with new dow many times, and O ter^ quater^
blessed man he, that can get any relics of him. The Soldiers thought
themselves hereby safe in the wars.

At this consecration also a Vessel of water was hallowed with many
ceremonies, and kept at the foot of the Altar for the Kings coronation, and to
bless the Captains that went to the wars, with a draught of it.

Next after their Gods it follows to speak of their Acosta. 15.
Goddess sacrifices: wherein they surmounted all the Nations of the world in
beastly butcheries. The persons they sacrificed were So (some say) from the
like practice of the Ancients Victi^a was so called, and bustia quasi a victe,
and ab boste
captives: to get which, they made their wars, rather seeking in their
victories to take then to kill. Their manner of Sacrificing was this. They
assembled such as should be sacrificed in the Pallisadoe of dead men's skulls,
of which we shall after speak, where they used a certain ceremony at the
foot of the Palisado; they placed a great guard about them. Presently there
stepped forth a Priest attyred with a short surplesse full of tassels beneath,
who came from the top of the Temple, bearing an Idol made of Wheat and Mays
mingled with bony, which had the eyes thereof made of green glass, and the
teeth of the grains of Mays. He descended the steps of the Temple with all
speed, and ascended by a little ladder up a great stone, planted upon a high
terrasse in the midst of the Court. This stone was called Quauxi-ca^^^, that
is, the stone of Eagle: as he went up and came down, still he embraced his
Idol. Then went he up to the place, where those were which should be
sacrificed, showing his Idol to every one in particular, saying unto them,
this is your God. This done, he descended by the other side of the stairs, and
all such as should die, went in Procession to the place where they should be
sacrificed, where they found the Ministers ready for that office. Six of the
Priests were appointed to this execution; four to hold the hands and feet of
him that should be sacrificed, the fifth to hold his head, the sixth to open his
stomach, and pull out his heart. They called them Chachalmna, that is, the
Ministers of holy things. It was a high dignity wherein they succeeded their
Progenitors.

The sixth, which killed the Sacrifice, was as a high Priest, or Bishop, whose
name was different according to the difference of times and solemnities. Their
habits also differed according to the times. The name of their chief dignity
was Papa and Topilzm. Their habit and robe was a red Curtain with tassells
below, a Crown of rich feathers, Green, White, and Yellow, upon his head; and
at his ears like pendants of gold, wherein were set green stones, and under
the lip upon the midst of the beard, he had a piece like unto a small Canon
of an Azured stone.

The sacrificer came with his face and hands shining black: the other five had
their hair much curled, and tied up with laces of leather, bound about the
midst of the head: upon their forehead they carried small roundelets of paper
painted about with diverse colors, and they were attyred in a Dalmatike robe of
white wrought with black, in this attire representing the Devil. The
Sovereign Priest carried a great knife in his hand of a large and sharp
flint, an other carried a collar of wood wrought in form of a Snake, all put
themselves in order before a Pyramidall stone which was directly against the
door of the Chapel of their Idol. This stone was so pointed, that the man
which was to be sacrificed, being laid thereon upon his back, did bend in
such sort, as letting the knife but fall upon his stomach, it opened very
easily in the midst. Then did the guard cause them to mount up certain large
stairs in rank to this place, and as every one came in their order, the six
sacrificers took him, one by one foot, an other by the other; and one by one
hand, an other by the other, all naked, and cast him on his back upon this
pointed stone: where the fifth of them put the collar of wood about his neck,
and the high Priest opened his stomach with the knife with a strange dexterity
and nimblenesse, pulling out his heart with his hands, the which he showed
smoking unto the Sun, to whom he did offer this heat and fume of the heart:
and presently he turned toward the Idol, and did cast the heart at his face,
and then cast away the body, tumbling it down the stairs of the Temple, there
being not two foot space betwixt the stone and the first step. In this sort
they sacrificed them all one after another. Their Masters, or such as had taken
them, took up the bodies and carried them away, and dividing them amongst
them, did eat them. There were ever forty or fifty, at the least, thus
sacrificed. The neighbor Nations did the like, imitating the Mexicans in this
sacred Butcherie.

There was another kind of Sacrifice, which they made in diverse feasts, called
Racaxipe Velitzli which is as much as the flaying of men, because they flayed
the sacrifice (as is said) and there with apparelled a man appointed to that
end. This man Gomara says, that the ancient persons, and sometimes the King
himself, would put on this skin, being of a principal Captive.
went dancing and leaping through all the houses and market places of the
City, every one being forced to offer something unto him: which, if any
refused, he would strike him over the face with the corner of the skin,
defiling him with the congealed blood. This continued till the skin did
stink, during which time much alms was gathered, which they employed in
necessaries for their devotions. In many of these Feasts they made a challenge
between him that did sacrifice, and him that should be sacrificed, thus: They
tied the slave by one foot to a wheel of stone, giving him a sword and target
in his hands to defend himself: then stepped forth the other armed in like
manner. And if he that should be sacrificed, defended himself valiantly
against the other, he was freed, and was reputed a famous Captain: but if he
were vanquished, he was sacrificed on that stone whereto he was tied.

They every year gave one slave to the Priests, to represent their Idol. At
his first entry into the office, after he had been well washed they adorned
him with the Idols ornaments and name, as before is said: and if he escaped
before his time of Sacrifice was expired, the chief of his guard was
substituted to that representation, and Sacrifice. He had the most honorable
lodging in all the Temple, where he did eat and drink, and whither all the
chief Ministers came to serve and honor him: he was accompanied with Noble
men through the streets. At night they put him into a strong prison, and at the
appointed feast sacrificed him.

The Devil ( a Ioh.3.44,
Murderer from the beginning) suggested to the Priests, when there seemed
defect of these Sacrifices, to go to their Kings, telling them that their Gods
dyed for hunger, and therefore should be remembered. Then assembled they their
people to wars to furnish their bloody Altars.

There happened a strange accident in one of these Sacrifices, reported by men
worthy of credit, That the Spaniards beholding these Sacrifices, a young man
whose heart was newly plucked out, and himself tumbled down the stairs, when
he came to the botome, he said to the Spaniards in his language; Knights they
have slain me. The Indians themselves grew weary of these cruel Rites, and
therefore they easily embraced the Spaniards Christianity: Yea, Cortes writ to
the Emperor Charles, that those of Mechoa^an sent to him for his law, being
weary of their own, as not seeming good unto them.

Some of the Spaniards Lop.de Com. part.1.
were thus sacrificed at Tescuco, and their horse-skinnes tanned in the hair,
and hung up with the horse-shooes in the great Temple, and next to them the
Spaniards garments, for a perpetual memory. At the siege of Mexico, they
sacrificed at one time, in sight of their Countrie-men, forty Spaniards.

The Acost.l.5.c.27
Mexicans, besides their cruelties, had other vn-beseeming Rites in their
Religion: as to eat and drink to the name of their Idols, to piss in the
honor of them, carrying them upon their shoulders, to anoint and besmeare
themselves filthily, and other things, both ridiculous and lamentable.

They Gom.pa.398
were so devout in their superstitions, and superstitious in their devotions,
that before they would eat or drink, they would take a little quantity and
offer it to the Sun, and to the Earth. And if they gather Corn, Fruit, or
Roses, they would take a leaf before they would smell it, and offer the same:
he which did not thus, was accounted neither loving nor loved of God.

The Mexicans in the siege of their City, being brought to all extremities,
spoke thus, as Lopes reports, unto Cortes; Considering that thou art the
child of the Sun, why do not thou entreat the Sun thy Father to make an
end of us: O Sun that can go round about the world in a day and a night,
make an end of us, and take us out of this miserable life, for we desire death,
to go and rest with our God Quercanath, who tarryeth for us.

CHAP. XII.
Of the Religious places and persons in New Spain: wherein is also handled
their Penance, Marriages, Burialls, and other Rites, performed by their Priests.

WE have already mentioned the Temple of Vitziliputzli in Mexico, which
requires our further description. It Acost. I.5.c.13
was built of great stones in fashion of Snakes tied one to another: and had a
great circuit, called Coatepantli, that is, a circuit of Snakes. Upon the top
of every Chapel or Oratorie, where the Idols were, was a fine pillar wrought
with small stones black as ieat, the ground raised up with white and red, which
below gave a great light: Upon the top of the pillar were battlements wrought
like Snailes, supported by two Indians of stone, sitting, holding candlesticks
in their hands, which were like Croysants, garnished and enriched at the ends,
with yellow and green feathers, and long fringes of the same. Within the
circuit of this Court there were many chambers of religious men, and others
that were appointed for the Priests and Popes. This Court is so great and
spacious, that eight or ten thousand persons did dance easily in a round,
holding hands, which was an usual custom there, howsoever it seems
incredible. There were four gates or entries, at the East, West, North, and
South, at every Gomara says that the fourth was not a causey, but a street of
the City.
of which began a fair causey of two or three leagues long. There were in
the midst of the Lake wherein Mexico is built, four large causies. Upon every
entry was a God or Idol, having the visage turned to the causie right against
the Temple gate of Vitziliputzli. There were thirty steps of thirty fadome
long, divided from the circuit of the Court by a street that went between
them. Upon the top of these steps, there was a walk of thirty foot broad,
all plastered with chalk, in the midst of which walk was a Pallisado
artificially made of very high Trees, planted in order a fadome a-sunder. These
Trees were very big and all pierced with small holes from the foot to the
top, and there were rods did run from one Tree to another, to which were tied
many dead men's heads. Upon every rod were many skulls, and these ranks of
skulls continue from the foot to the top of the Tree. This Pallisado was full
of dead men's skulls from one end to the other, which were the heads of such as
had been sacrificed. For after the flesh was eaten, the head was delivered to
the Priests, who tied them in this sort, until they fell off by morsells. Upon
the top of the Temple were two stones or Chappells, and in them the two Images
of Vitziliputzli and Tlaloc. These Chappells were carved and graven very
artificially, and so high, that to ascend up to it there were an hundred and
twenty stairs of stone. Before these Chappells there was a Court of forty
foot square, in the midst whereof was a high stone of five hand breadth,
pointed in fashion of a Pyramide, placed there for the sacrificing of men as is
before showed.

Gomara Gomar.part.1
says, that this and other their Temples were called Tencalls, which
signifies Gods house. This Temple, he says, was square, containing every way
as much Pet.Mart. Dec.5.l.4. says that in largeness^ the situation of this
Temple is matchable with a Town of five hundred houses.
as a Crosse-bow can shoot level: in the midst stood a mount of earth and
stone fifty fadome long every way, built Pyramide-fashion, save that the top
was flat; and ten fadome square. It had two such Pyramide stones or Altars for
sacrifice, painted with monstrous figures. Every Chapel had three lofts, one
above another, sustained upon pillars: From thence the eye with much pleasure
might behold all about the Lake. Besides this Tower, there were forty other
Towers belonging to other inferior Temples; which were of the same fashion:
only their prospect was not Westward, to make difference. Some of those Temples
were bigger then others, and every one of a several God.

There was one round Temple dedicated to the God of the Air, called
Quecalconatl, the form of the Temple representing the aires circular course
about the earth. The entrance of that Temple had a door, made like the mouth of
a Serpent, with foul and deuillish resemblances, striking dreadful horror to
such as entered. All these Temples had peculiar Houses, Priests, Gods, and
Services. At every door of the great Temple was a large Hall and goodly
buildings, which were common Armories for the City. They had other dark
houses full of Idols of diverse mettalls, all embrewed with blood, the daily
sprinkling whereof makes them show black: yea, the walls were an inch thick,
and the ground a foot thick with blood, which yielded a loathsome sent. The
Priests entered daily therein, which they allowed not to others, except to
Noble personages, who at their entry were bound to offer some man to be
sacrificed to those slaughter-houses of the Devil. There did continually
reside in the great Temple five thousand persons, which had there their meat,
drink, and lodging; the Temple enjoying great reuennues and diverse Towns for
the maintenance thereof.

Next Acost.l.5.c.13
to the Temple of Vitziliputzli was that of Tescalipuca, the God of Penance,
Punishments (and Providence) very high and well built. It had four ascents; on
the top was flat, an hundred and twenty foot broad; and joining to it was a
Hal hanged with Tapestrie, and Curtins of diverse colors and works. The door
being low and large was always covered with a veil, and none but the Priests
might enter.

All this Temple was beautified with diverse Images and Pictures most curiously:
for that these two Temples were as the Cathedral Church, the rest as
parishionall. They were so spacious, and had so many Chambers, that there were
in them places for the Priests, Colleges, and Schools.

Without Lop. Gom. part.1.
the great Temple, and over against the principal door, a stones cast distant
was the Charnell house, or that Golgotha (before mentioned;) where upon poles
or sticks, and also in the walls (two Towers having no other stuff but lime
and skulles) Andrew de Tapia certified Acost. l.5. cap.15.
Gomara, that he, and Gonsala de Vmbria did reckon in one day, an hundred
thirty six thousand skulls. When any wasted, supply was made of others in
their roome^

Within this great Circuit of the principal Temple were two houses, like
Cloisters, the one opposite to the other, one of men, the other of women. In
that of women they were Virgins only, of twelve or thirteen years of age,
which they called the Maids of Penance: they were as many as the men, and lived
chastely, and regularly, as Virgins dedicated to the service of their God.
Their charge was to sweep and make clean the Temple, and every morning to
prepare meat for the Idol and his Ministers, of the Alms the Religious
gathered. The food they prepared for the Idol were small Loaves, in the form
of hands and feet, as of March-pane: and with this bread they prepared
certain sauces, which they cast daily before the Idol, and his Priests did
eat it.

These Virgins had their hair cut, and then let them grow for a certain time:
they rose at midnight to the Idols Mattins, which they daily celebrated,
performing the same exercises which the Religious did. They had their Abbesses,
who employed them to make cloth of diverse fashions, for the ornaments of their
Gods and Temples. Their ordinary habit was all white, without any work or
color. They did their penance at midnight, sacrificing and wounding
themselves, and piercing the tops of their ears, laying the blood which issued
forth upon their cheeks, and after bathed themselves in a poole which was
within the Monastery. If any were found dishonest, they were put to death
without remission, saying, she had polluted the house of their God.

They held it for an ominous token, that some Religious man or woman had
committed a fault, when they saw a Rat or a Mouse pass, or a Battin in the
Idol-Chappell, or that they had gnawed any of the vailes, for that they say, a
Cat, or a Bat would not adventure to commit such an indignity, if some of
tence had not gone before: and then began to make inquisition, and discovering
the offender, put him to death. None were received into this Monastery, but
the daughters of one of the six quarters, named for that purpose: and this
profession continued a year, during which time, their fathers and themselves
had made a vow to serve the Idol in this manner, and from thence they went to
be married.

The other Cloister or Monastery was of yong-men, of eighteen or twenty
years of age, which they called Religious. Their crowns were shaven, as the
Friars in these parts, their hair a little longer, which fell to the midst
of their ear, except on the hinder part of the head, where they let it grow to
their shoulders, and tied it up in trusses. These served in the Temple, lived
poorly and chastely, and (as the Levites) ministered to the Priests, Incense,
Lights and Garments, swept and made clean the holy Place, bringing wood for a
continual fire, to the harth of their God, which was like a Lamp that still
burned before the Altar of their Idol. Besides these, there were other little
boys that served for manual uses, as to deck the Temple with Boughs, Roses,
and Reeds, give the Priests water to wash, Rasours to sacrifice, and to go
with such as begged alms, to carry it. All these had their superiors, who
had the government over them, and when they came in public, where women were,
they carried their eyes to the ground, not daring to behold them. They had
linen garments, and went into the City four or six together, to ask alms
in all quarters, and if they got none, it was lawful for them to go into the
Cornefields, and gather that which they needed, none daring to contradict them.

There might not above fifty live in this penance, they rose at midnight and
sounded the Trumpets, to awake the people. Every one watched by turn, least
the fire before the Altar should die: they gave the censer, with which the
Priest at midnight incensed the Idol, and also in the morning, at noone, and
at night. They Mexican Votaries, no less strict in that threefold cord which
the Popish Votaries glory of; Poverty, Co^tinencie, Obedience, with other
will worship: yea, for the time, more austere.
were very subject and obedient to their Superiors, and passed not any one
point commanded. And at midnight after the Priest had ended his censing, they
retired themselves apart into a secret place, where they sacrificed and drew
blood from the Calves of their legs with sharp bodkins, therewith rubbing
their Temples and under their Ears, presently washing themselves in a Poole
appointed to that end. These young men did not annoint their heads and bodies
with Tobacco.
Petum, as the Priests did. This austeritie continued a year.

The Priests likewise rose at midnight, and retired themselves into a large
place where were many lights, and there drew blood, as the former, from their
legs, then did they set these Bodkins upon the battlements of the Court,
stickt in straw, that the people might see. Neither might they use one bodkin
twice. The Priests also used great fasts of five or ten days together, before
their great Feasts. Some of them to preserve their chastity, slit their
members in the midst, and did a hundred things to make themselves impotent,
lest they should offend their Gods. They drunk no wine, and slept little, for
that the greatest part of their exercises were by night.

They did use also (that the selfe-tyrannising Catholic should not outvie
merits) to Discipline themselves with cords full of knots, wherein the people
likewise came not behind in cruel Processions, especially on the Feast of
Tezcalipuca, lashing themselves with knotted Manguey-cords over the shoulders.
The Priests fasted five days before that Feast, eating but once a day, and
abstayning from their Wives; the whips supplying those delicacies.

Gomara I.op. de Gom. part.1. page.396.
speaks of others, besides those young ones before mentioned, which lived in
those Cloisters, some being sick, for their recovery; some in extreme
poverty, to find relief; some for riches, for long life, for good husbands,
for many children, and some for virtue: every one abode there as long as they
had vowed, and after used their liberty. Their offices were to spinne cotton,
wool, and feathers, and to weaue cloth for their Gods, and themselves, to
sweep all the holy rooms: they might go on Procession with the Priests, but
not sing, nor go up the stairs of the Temple: their food was boiled flesh
and hot bread, received of alms, the smoke whereof was offered to their Gods:
they eat and lay all together, but lay in their clothes.

Touching their Priests in Mexico Ios.Acost.l.5 cap.14.
there were some high Priests or Popes, even under the same name, called by the
Mexicans, Papas, as they should say, Sovereign Bishops: others, as before you
have heard, were of inferior rank. The Priests of Vitziliputzli succeeded by
linages of certain quarters of the City, deputed for that purpose: and those
of other Idols came by election, or by being offered to the Temple in their
Infancy. The daily exercise of the Priests was to cast incense on the Idols,
which was done four times in the space of a natural day: at break of day, at
noone, at sunne-set, at midnight. At midnight all the chief Officers of the
Temple did rise, and in stead of Bells they did sound a long time upon
Trumpets, Cornets, and Flutes, very heavily; which being ended, he that did the
Office that week, stepped forth attyred in a white Robe with a censer in his
hand, full of coals, which he took from the harth, burning continually before
the Altar; in the other hand he had a purse full of incense, which he cast
into the censer, and entering the place where the Idol was, he incensed it with
great reverence; then took he a cloth with the which he wiped the Altar and
the Curtins. This done, they went all into a Chapel, and there did beat
themselves and draw blood with Bodkins, as is said: this was always done at
midnight. None other but the Priests might intermeddle with their Sacrifices,
and every one did employ himself according to his dignity and degree. They
did likewise preach to the people at some Feasts. They had reuennues, and great
offerings.

The Mexican Priests Acost.l.5.c.26
were thus anointed; they anointed the body from the foot to the head, and
all the hair likewise, which hung like tresses, or a horsemane, for that they
applied this unction wet and moist. Their hair grew so, that in time it hung
down to their hammes, insomuch, that the weight made it burdensome; for they
never cut it until they died, or were dispensed with for their great age, or
were employed in gouernements, or some honorable charge in the Commonwealth.
They carried their hair in tresses of six fingers breadth, which they died
black with the fume of Sapine, Fur, or Rosine. They were always died with
this tincture, from the foot unto the head, so as they were like unto shining
Negros. This was their ordinary unction; they had an other, when they went to
sacrifice or incense on the tops of mountains, or in dark Caves, where
their Idols were, using also certain ceremonies, to take away Fear, and add
Courage. This Unction was made with diverse venomous beasts, as Spiders,
Scorpions, Salamanders, and Vipers, which the boys in the Colleges took and
gathered together: wherein they were so expert, as they were always furnished
when the Priests called for them. They took all these together, and burnt them
upon the harth of the Temple which was before the Altar, until they were
consumed to ashes. Then did they put them in Morters with much Tobacco or
Petum, which makes them loose their force; mingling likewise with these ashes,
scorpions, spiders, and palmers alive. After this, they put to it a certain
seed being grownd, which they called Ololol^chqui, whereof the Indians made
drinks to see Visions, for that the virtue of this herb is to deprive men of
sense. They did likewise grind with these ashes black and hairie worms,
whose hair only is venomous: all which they mingled together with black, or
the fume of rosine, putting it in small pots, which they set before their God,
saying it was his meat, and therefore called it a Divine meat. By means of
this ointment they became Witches, and did see and speak with the Devil. The
Priests, being slubbered with this ointment, lost all fear, putting on a
spirit of cruelty. By reason whereof they did very boldly kill men in their
Sacrifices, went all alone in the night time to the mountains, and into
obscure Caves, contemned all wild beasts, believing, that Lions, Tygres,
Serpents, and the rest fled from them by virtue hereof.

This Petum did also serve to cure the sick; and for children, all resorted to
them as to their Savior, to apply unto them this Divine Physic, as they
called it. They used manifold other superstitions to delude the people, in
tying small flowers about their necks, and strings with small bones of Snakes,
commanding them to bathe at certain times, to watch all night at the Divine
harth, to eat no other bread but that which had been offered to their Gods,
that they should (upon all occasions) repair to their wisards, who with
certain grains told fortunes, and diuined, looking into keelers and pailes
full of water. The Sorcerers and Their witches.
Ministers of the devil used much to besmeare themselves. There were an
infinite number of these witches, diuiners, inchanters, and the like: and still
there remain of them (but secret) not daring publicly to exercise their
superstitions

The Mexicans Their rites unto infants.
had amongst them a kind of Baptism, which they did with cutting the ears
and members of young children, having some resemblance of the Jewish
circumcision. This ceremony was done principally to the sons of Kings and
Noble men: presently upon their birth the Priests did wash them, and did put a
little sword in the right hand, in the left, a Target. And to the children of
the vulgar sort, they put the marks of their callings, and to their daughters,
instruments to spinne, knit, and labor.

The Their marriages
Priests also had their office in marriages. The Bridegroom, and the Bride
stood together before the Priest, who took them by the hands, asking them if
they would marry: understanding their will, he took a corner of the veil,
wherewith the woman had her head covered, and a corner of the man's gown,
which he tied together on a knot, and so led them thus tied to the
Bridegroomes house, where there was a harth kindled. Then he caused the Wife to
go seven times about the harth, and so the married couple sat down together,
and thus was the marriage contracted.

In other parts of New Spain Gomara.part. 1 page 389.
they used other marriage-rites; at Tlaxcallan the Bridegroom and Bride polled
their heads, to signify, that from thenceforth all childish courses should be
laid aside. At Michuacan the Bride must look directly upon the Bridegroom, or
else the marriage was not perfect. In Mixteopan they used to carry the
Bridegroom upon their backs, as if he were forced: and then they both join
hands, and knit their mantles together with a great knot. The Macatecas did not
come together in twenty days after marriage, but abode in fasting and prayer
all that while, sacrificing their bodies, and annoynting the mouths of the
Idols with their blood. In Panuco the husbands buy their wives for a bow, two
arrows, and a net; and afterward the father in law speaks not one word to
his son in law for the space of a year. When he has a child, he lies not
with his wife in two years after, lest she should be with child again before
the other be out of danger; some suck twelve years: and for this cause they
have many wives. No woman, while she has her disease, may touch or dress any
thing. Adultery in Mexico was death: common women were permitted, but no
ordinary stews. The devil did many times talk with their Priests, and with
some other rulers and particular persons. Great gifts were offered unto him whom
the devil had vouchsafed this conference. He appeared unto them in many
shapes, and was often familiar with them. He, to whom he appeared, carried
about him, painted, the likeness where in he showed himself the first time. And
they painted his Image on their doors, benches, and every corner of the house.
Likewise, according to his Protean and diuersified Apparitions, they painted
him in many shapes.

It belonged also to the office of the Priests and religious in Mexico,
Acost.li. 5.c.8.
to interre the dead, and do their obsequies. The places where they buried
them were their gardens and courts of their own houses: others carried them to
the places of sacrifices, which were done in the mountains: others burnt them,
and after, buried the ashes in the temples, burying with them whatsoever they
had of apparel, stones and jewels. They did sing the funeral offices like
Responds, often lifting up the dead body, with many ceremonies. At these
mortuaries they did eat and drink; and if it were a person of quality, they
gave apparel to such as came. When one was dead, his friends came with their
presents, and saluted him as if he were living. And if he were a King or Lord
of some town, they offered some slaves to be put to death with him, to serve
him in the other world. They likewise put to death his Priest or Chaplain (for
every nobleman had a Priest for his domestical holies) that he might execute
his office with the dead. They likewise killed his cook, his butler, dwarffs,
and deformed men, and whosoever had most served him, though he were his
brother. And to prevent poverty, they buried with them much wealth, as gold,
silver, stones, curtins, and other rich pieces. And if they burned the dead,
they used the like with all his servants, and ornaments they gave him for the
other world, and lastly, buried the ashes with great solemnity. The obsequies
continued ten days with mournful songs, and the Priests carried away the
dead with innumerable ceremonies. To the noblemen they gave their honorable
ensigns, arms, and particular blazons, which they carried before the body to
the place of burning, marching as in a Procession, where the Priests and
Officers of the Temple went with diverse furnitures, and ornaments, some casting
incense, others singing, and some making the drums and flutes to sound the
mournefullest accents of sorrow. The Priest who did the office was decked with
the marks of the Idol which the Nobleman had represented: for all noblemen
did represent Idols and carry the name of some one.

Their The Mexica^s honored the best soldiers with a kind of knighthood, of
which were three Orders: one ware a red riband, which was the chief, the second
was the Lion or tiger knight: the gray Knight was the meanest: they had great
privileges. Acost. libr. 6 ca.26.
Knighthood had these funeral solemnities. They brought the corpse to the
place appointed, and environing it, and all the baggage, with pine-trees, set
fire thereon, maintaining the same with gummy wood, till all were consumed.
Then came forth a Priest attired like a devil, having mouths upon every joint
of him, and many eyes of glass, holding a great staff with which he mingled
all the ashes with terrible and fearful gestures. When Lop.de.Gom. part,
1.page 383.
the king of Mexico sickened, they used forthwith to put a visor on the face of
Tezcatlipuca or Vitzilivitzli, or some other idol, which was not taken away
till he mended or ended. If he died, word was presently sent into all his
dominions for public lamentations, and noblemen were summoned to the
funerals. The body was laid on a matte, and watched four nights, then
washed, and a lock of hair cut off for a relike, for therein (said they)
remained the remembrance of his soul. After this an Emerald was put in his
mouth, and his body shrouded in seventeen rich mantles, costly and curiously
wrought. Upon the upper mantle was set the Device or Arms of some Idol,
whereunto he had been most deuote in his life time, and in his Temple should
the body be huried. Upon his face they put a vizor painted with foul and
devilish gestures, beset with jewels: then they killed the slave, whose office
was to light the lamps, and make fire to the Gods of his palace. This done,
they carried the body to the Temple, some carrying targets, arrows, mases and
ensigns, to hurl^ into the funeral fire. The high priest and his crew receive
him at the temple gate with a sorrowful Song, and after he has said certain
words, the body is cast into the fire there prepared for that purpose, together
with jewels: also a dog newly strangled, to guide his way. In the mean
while two hundred persons were sacrificed by the Priests, or more, to serve
him, as is said. The fourth day after, fifteen slaves were sacrificed for his
soul, and upon the twentieth day, five; on the sixtieth, three, etc. The ashes
with the lock of hair was put in a chest, painted on the inside, with
devilish shapes, together with an other lock of hair which had been
reserved since the time of his birth. On this chest was set the Image of the
King: the kindred offered great gifts before the same. The Kings of Mechuacan
observed the like bloody rites: many Gentlewomen were by the new King appointed
their offices in their service to the deceased, and while his body was burning,
were malled with clubbes, and buried four and four in a grave. Many
women-slaues and free Maidens were slain to attend on these Gentlewomen. But I
would not bury my Reader in these direful graves of men, cruel in life and
death. Let us seek some Festival argument, if that may be more delightful.

CHAP. XIII.
Of the supputation of times, Festival Solemnities, Colleges, Schools,
Letters, Opinions, and other remarkable things in New-Spaine

THE Mexicans Acost. l.6.c.2.
divided the year into eighteen months, ascribing to each twenty-dayes, so
that the five odd days were excluded. These five they reckoned apart, and
called them the days of nothing: during the which, the people did nothing,
neither went to their Temples, but spent the time in visiting each other: the
sacrificers likewise ceased their sacrifices. These five days being past, the
first month began about the 26. of February. Gomara Gom. p.317.
sets down their months names in order. The Indians described them by
peculiar pictures, commonly taken of the principal Feast therein. They
accounted their weeks by thirteen days: they had also a week of years
which was likewise thirteen. They reckoned by a certain wheel, which
contained four weeks, that is, two and fifty years. In the midst of this
wheel was painted the Sun, from which went four beams or lines, in cross,
of distinct colors, green, blew, red, and yellow; and so the lines betwixt
these: on which they noted by some picture, the accident that befell any year,
as the Spaniards coming, marked by a man clad in Red. The last night when this
wheel was run about, they brake all their Vessels and stuff, put out their
fire and all the lights, saying, that the world should end at the finishing of
one of these wheels, and it might be at that time; and then what should such
things need? Upon this conceit they passed the night in great fears, but when
they saw the day begin to break, they presently bear many drums, with much
other mirth and music, saying; that GOD did prolong the time with another Age
of two and fifty years. And then began another wheel, the first day whereof
they took from fire, for which they went to the Priest and made a solemn
Sacrifice and Thanksgiving. The twenty days of each month were called by
several names, the first Cipact^ which signifies a Spade, and so the rest a
house, a Dog, a Snake, an Eagle, a Temple, and the like. By this Calendar
they keep things in memory above nine hundred years since. The Indians of
Culhua did believe that the Gods had made the world, they knew not how: and
that since the Creation, four Suns were past, and that the fifth and last is
the Sun, which now gives light unto the world.

The first Sun (forsooth) perished by water, and all living creatures
therewith: the second fell from heaven, and with the fall slew all living
Creatures, and then were many Giants in the country. The third Sun was
consumed by fire: and the fourth, by Tempest of Air and Wind; and then
mankind perished not, but was turned into Apes: yet when that fourth Sun
perished, all was turned into darkness, and so continued five and twenty
years: and at the fifteenth year, God did form one man and woman, who
brought forth Children, and at the end of other ten years appeared this fifth
Sun newly borne, which after their reckoning is now in this year 1612, nine
hundred and eighteen years since. Three days after this Sun appeared, they
held, that all the Gods did die, and that these which since they worship, were
borne in process of time.

At the end of every twenty days the Mexicans celebrated a Feast called
Tonalli, which was the last day of every month. The last day of the first
month was called Tlacaxipevaliztli, on which were slain a hundred captives in
sacrifice, and eaten, others putting on the skins (as is before showed.) Many
of them would go to the staughter with joyful countenance, dancing, and
demanding alms, which befell to the Priests. When the green corn was a
foot above the ground, they used to go to a certain hill, and there
sacrificed two children, a Gerle, and a Boy, three years old, to the honor of
Tlaloc, god of Water, that they might have rain: and because these children
were freeborn, their hearts were not plucked out, but their throats being
cut, their bodies were wrapped in a new mantle, and buried in a grave of stone.

When the fields of Maiz were two foot high, a Collection was made, and
therewith were bought four little slaves, betwixt the age of five and seven,
and they were sacrificed also to Tlaloc, for the continuance of rain: and
those dead bodies were shut up in a Cave appointed to that purpose. The
beginning of this butcherie, was, by occasion of a drought which continued
four years, and forced them to leave the Country. When the Maiz was ripe, in
the month and Feast Hueitozotls, every man gathered his handful of Maiz, and
brought it to the Temple for an offering, with a certain drink called Atuli,
made of the same grain. They brought also Copalli, a sweet gum, to incense
the Gods, which cause the corn to grow. At the beginning of Summer, they
celebrated the Feast Tlaxnehimcaco, with Roses and all sweet flowers, making
Garlands thereof, to set on their Idols heads, and spending all that day in
dancing. To celebrate the Feast Tecuilhustli, all the principal persons of
each Province, came to the City on the evening of the Feast, and apparelled a
woman with the attire of the God of Salt, who daunced among a great company of
her neighbors, but the next day was sacrificed with much solemnity, and all
that day was spent in devotion, burning of incense in the Temple. The Merchants
had a Temple by themselves dedicate to the God of Gain: they made their Feast
upon the day called Miccailhuitl, wherein were sacrificed and eaten many
captives, which they had bought, and all the day spent in dancing.

In the Feast of Vchpaniztli they sacrificed a woman, whose skin was put upon
an Indian, which two days together daunced with the Townes-men, celebrating
the same Feast in their best attire.

In the day of Hatamutztli the Mexicans entered into the Lake with a great
number of Canoas, and there drowned a Boy and a Gerle, in a little boat, which
they caused to be suncke, in such sort, that never after that boat appeared
again, holding opinion, that those children were in company with the Gods of
the Lake. That day they spent in feasting and annoynting their Idols cheeks
with a kind of gum called V^^

When Cortes was gone out of Mexico, to encounter Pamphilo de Narnaes, and had
left Alvarado in the City, he in the great Temple murdered a great multitude
of gentlemen, which had rhere assembled in the great Temple, to their
accustomed solemnity, being six hundred, or (as some say) a thousand, richly
attired and adorned, where they used to sing and dance, in honor of their
God, to obtain health, children, victory, etc.

In the month of May, Acost.l.^. c.24.
the Mexicans made their principal feast to Vitziliputzli: two days before
which, the religious Virgins or Nuns mingled a quantity of beetes with
roasted Maiz, and molded it with honey, making an Image of that paste, in
bigness like to the Idol of wood, putting in insted of eyes, grains of glass,
green, blew, or white, and for teeth, grains of Maiz. Then did all the Nobles
bring it a rich garment like unto that of the Idol, and being clad, did set it
in an azured Chair, and in a Litter. The morning of the ^^st being come, an
hour before day, all the maidens came forth attired in white with new
ornaments, which that day were called the sisters of Vitziliputzli: they were
crowned with garlands of Maiz roasted and parched, with chames of the same about
their necks, passing under their left arms. Their cheeks were died with
vermilion, their arms from the elbow to the wrist were covered with red
Parrots feathers. Thus attired, they took the Image on their shoulders,
carrying it into the Court; where all the yongmen were, attired in red
garments, crowned like the women. When the Maidens came forth with this idol,
the young men drew near with much reverence, taking the Litter wherein the
Idol was, upon their shoulders, carrying it to the stairs foot of the
Temple: where all the people did humble themselves, laying earth upon their
heads.

After this, all the people went in procession to a mountain called
Chapulteper, a league from Mexico, and there made sacrifices. From thence they
went to their second Station called Atlacuyauaya: and from thence again to a
Village which was a league beyond Cuyoacoan, and then returned to Mexico. They
went in this sort above four leagues, in so many hours, calling this
procession Vpanta Vitziliputzli. Being come to the foot of the Temple stairs,
they set down the litter with the Idol, and with great observance draw the
same to the top of the Temple, some drawing above, and others helping below,
the Flutes and Drums, Cornets, Trumpets, meane-while increasing the
Solemnity. The people abode in the Court. Having mounted, and placed it in a
little lodge of Roses, presently came the young men, which strawed flowers of
sundry kinds, within and without the Temple. This done, all the Virgins came
out of their Convent, bringing pieces of the same past whereof the Idol was
made, in the fashion of great bones, which they delivered to the young men, who
carried them up, and laid them at the Idols feet, till the place could
receive no more.

They called these morsels of paste, the flesh and bones of Vitziliputzli. Then
came all the Priests of the Temple, every one strictly observing his place,
with Vatles of diverse colors and works, garlands on their heads, and chains
of flowers above their necks: after them came the Gods and Goddesses, whom
they worshipped, of diverse figures, attired in the same liuerie. Then putting
themselves in order about those pieces of paste, they used certain ceremonies,
with singing and dancing. By these means they were blessed and consecrated for
the flesh and bones of the Idol: which were then honored in the same sort, as
their God. Then came forth the sacrificers, who began the sacrifice of men,
whereof they now sacrificed more then at other times: for this was their
solemnest Festival. The sacrifices being ended, all the young men and Maids
came out of the Temple attired as before, and being placed in order and rank,
one directly against another, they daunced by Drums, which sounded in praise
of the Feast, and of their God. To which song, all the ancientest and greatest
men did answer, dancing about them, making a great circle as the manner is,
the Young men and Maids remaining always in the midst.

All the City came to this spectacle, and throughout the whole land, on this
day of Vitziliputzli his Feast, no man might eat any other meat; but this
paste with Home, whereof the Idol was made: and this should be eaten at the
point of day, not drinking till afternoon: The contrary was sacrilegious:
After the ceremonies ended, it was lawful for them to eat any thing. During
the time of this ceremony they hid the water from their little Children,
admonishing such, as had the use of reason, to abstain.

The ceremonies, dances, and sacrifices ended, they went to unclothe
themselves, and the Priests and Ancients of the Temple, took the Image of
paste, and spoiled it of all the ornaments, making many pieces of it, and of
the consecrated Rolls, which they gave to the Communion, beginning with the
greater, and continuing unto the rest both men, women, and children: who
received it with tears, fear, reverence, and other both affects, and effects
of devotion, saying, that they did eat the flesh and bones of their God. Such
as had sick folks demanded thereof for them, and carried it with great
reverence and veneration. All such as did communicate were bound to give the
tenth part of this seed, whereof the Idol was made.

The solemnity of the Idol being ended, an old man of great authority
slept up into a high place, and with a lord voice preached their law and
ceremonies. This History deserves the longer Relation, because it The New
Catholics of old Spain, and old Cacolikes of New Spain: like in Superstition.
so much resembles the Popish Chimuera, and monstrous conception of
Transubstantiation, and of their Corpus Christ^, Fe^^^ with other their Rites,
to which Acosta also the relater compares it, blaming the Devil, for usurping
the service, and imitating the Rites of their Church, whereas their Church
deserves blame for imitaring the Devil and these his idolatrous Disciples, in
their Stupendous monsters of opinion, and ridiculous, offices of superstition.
But ^ou shall yet see a further resemblance.

Next to this principal Feast of Vitzliputzli, Ac.l.5.c.2.
was that of Tezcalipuca, of chief esti mation. This fell on the nineteenth
day of May, and was called Tozcolt. It fell every four years with the Feast
of Penance, where there was given Mexican Iubilee.
full indulgence and remission of sins. In this day they did sacrifice a
captive which resembled the Idol Tezcalipuca.

Upon the even this solemnity, the Noble men came to the Temple, bringing a
new garment like to that of the Idol, which the Priest put upon him, having
first taken off his other garments, which they kept with great reverence. There
were in the Coffers of the Idol Their Relics.
many ornaments, jewels, eare-rings, and other riches, as bracelets, and
precious feathers, which served to no use, and were worshipped as the God
himself. Besides that garment, they put upon him certain ensigns of
Feathers, with ^annes, shadows, and other things.

Being thus attired, they drew the Curtain from before the door, that all
men might see. Then came forth one of the chief of the Temple, attired like to
the Idol, carrying flower in his hand, and a Flute of earth, having a very
sharp sound, and turning toward the East, he sounded it, and after that to the
West, North, and South, he did the like.

This done, he put his finger into the air, and then gathered up the earth

which he put in his mouth, eating it in sign of adoration. The like did all
that were present, weeping, and falling flat to the ground, inuocating the
darkness of the night and the winds not to forsake them, or else to take away
their lives and free them from the labors they endured therein. Thieves,
Adulterers, Murderers, and all other offenders had great fear and heaviness
whiles the Flute sounded, so as some could not hide nor dissemble their
offenses. By this means they all demanded no other thing of their God, but to
have their offenses concealed: pouring forth many tears, with great repentance
and sorrow, offering great store of incense to appease their Gods. All the
Martialists, and resolute spirits, addicted to the Watres, desired with great
devotion of GOD the Creator, of the Lord, for whom we live, of the Sun, and
of other their Gods, that they would give them victory against their enemies,
and strength to take away many captives for sacrifice. This ceremonious
sounding of the Flute by the Priest continued ten days, from the ninth of May
to the nineteenth, with eating of earth, praying every day with eyes lifted up
to heaven, sighs and groans as of men grieved for their sins. Yet did not

of this Chapter.
any punishments in the other life, but did these things to auert temporal
punishments: they accounted death an assured rest, and therefore voluntarily
offered themselves thereto. The last day of the Feast the Priests drew forth a
litter well furnished with Curtins and pendants of diverse fashions: this litter
had so many arms to hold by, as there were Ministers to carry it: all which
came forth besmeared with black, and long hair, half in tresses with white
strings, and attired in the Idols liuerie. Upon this litter they set the image
of Tezcalipuca, and taking it on their shoulders, brought it to the foot of
the stairs. Then came forth the young men and Maidens of the Temple, carrying
a great cord wreathed of chains of roasted Mays, with which they environed the
litter, and put a chain of the same about the Idols neck, and a garland
thereof on his head.

The young men and Maids wear chains of roasted mais, and the men Garlands,
the Maids Mit^rs made of rods covered with the Mais, their feet covered with
feathers, and their arms and cheeks painted. The image being placed in the
litter they strewed round about store of the boughs of Manguey, the leaves
whereof are pricking. They carried Their bloody processions
it on procession (two Priests going before with incense) in the circuit of
the Court: and every time the Priest gave incense, they lifted up their arms
as high as they could to the Idol and the Sun. All the people in the Court
turned round to the Place whither the Idol went, every one carrying in his hand
new cords of the threads of Manguey, a fadome long, with a knot at the end,
wherewith they whipped themselves on the sholders even as they do here (says
Acosta) on holy Thursday. The people brought boughs and flowers to beautify
the Court and Temple.

This done, every one brought their offerings, Jewels, Incense, sweet Wood,
Grapes, Mays, Quails, and the rest. Quails were the poor man's offering,
which he delivered to the Priests, who pull off their heads, and cast them at
the foot of the Altar, where they lost their blood: and so they did of all
other things which were offered. Every one offered meat and fruit, according
to his power which was laid at the foot of the Altar and was carried to the
Ministers chamber.

The offering done, the people went to dinner: the young men and Maidens of the
temple being busied meane-while to serve the Idol with all that was appointed
for him to eat, which was prepared by other women who had made a vow that day
to serve the Idol. These prepared meats in admirable variety, which being
ready, the Virgins went out of the Temple in procession, every one carrying a
little Basket of Bread in her hand, and in the other a dish of these meats.
Before them marched an old man like to a Steward, attired in a white Surples
down to the calves of his legs, upon a red iacket, which had wings in steed
of sleeves, from which hung broad Ribands, and at the same a small Pumpion
stuck full of flowers, and having many superstitious things within it. This
old man coming near to the foot of the stairs made lowly reverence. Then
the Virgins with like reverence presented their meats in order: this done, the
old man returns leading their Virgins into the Convent.

And then the yongmen and Ministers of the Temple come forth and gather up
their meat, which they carry to their Priests Chambers, who had fasted five
days, eating but once a day, not stirring all that time out of the Temple,
where they whipped themselves as before is showed. They did eat of these
divine meats (so they called it) neither might any other eat thereof. After
dinner they assembled again, and then was sacrificed one who had all that
year borne the habit and resemblance of their Idol. They went after this,
into a holy place appointed for that purpose, whither the young men and Virgins
of the Temple brought them their ornaments, and then they danced and sung, the
chief priests drumming and sounding other instruments. The Noble men in
ornaments like to the yongmen, danced round about them.

They did not usually kill any man that day, but him that was sacrificed, yet
every fourth year they had others with him, which was the year of Iubilee and
full pardons. After sunne-set the Virgins went all to their Convent, and taking
great dishes of earth full of bread, mixed with Honey, covered with small
Panniars, wrought and fashioned with dead men's heads and bones, carried the
same to the Idol, and setting them down retired, their steward Vshering them
as before. Presently came forth all the young men in order, with Canes or Reeds
in their hands, who began to run as fast as they could to the top of the
Temple-staires; every one striving to come first to the Collation, The chief
Priests observed who came first, second, third, and fourth, neglecting the
rest, these they praised, and gave them ornaments, and from thence forward they
were respected as men of mark. The said Collation was all carried away by the
young men as great Relikes

This ended, the yongmen and Maids were dismissed: and so I think would our
Reader, who cannot but be glutted with, and almost surfeit of our so long and
taedious feasting. Yet let me entreat one service more, it is for the God of
game, who I am sure will find followers and Disciples too attentive.

For the Feastiuall of this Gain God, Quetzaabcoalt, the Merchants, his
devoted and faithful obseruantes, forty days before, bought a slave well
proportioned to represent that Idol for that space. First they washed him
twice in a lake, called the lake of the Gods, and being purified, they attired
him like the Idol. Two of the Ancients of the Temple came to him nine days
before the Feast, and humbling themselves before him, said with a loud voice,
Sir, nine days hence your dancing must end, and you must die: and he must
answer, (whatsoever he thinks) In a good hour. They diligently observed if
this advertisement made him sad, or if he continued his dancing according to
his wont. If they perceived him sad, they took the sacrificing Rasors, which
they washed and cleansed form the blood, which thereon had remained, and hereof
with an other liquor made of Cacao, mixed a drink, which they said would make
him forget what had been said to him, and return to his former iollitie. For
they took this heaviness in these men to be ominous.

On the Feast day, after much honoring him, and incensing him, about midnight
they sacrificed him, offering his heart to the Moon, and after cast it to the
Idol, letting the body fall down the stairs to the Merchants, who were the
chief worshippers. These hearts of their sacrifices (some p.Mart.Dec.5
say) were burned after the Oblation to this Planet and Idol. The body they
sauced and dressed for a banquet about break of day, after they had bid the
Idol good morrow with a small dance.

This Temple of Quetzaalcoalt had Chapels as the rest, and Chambers, where
were Conuents of Priests, young men, Maids, and Children. One Priest alone was
resident which was changed weekly. His charge that week, after he had
instructed the children, was to strike up a Drum at sunne-setring, at the
sound whereof (which was heard throughout the City) every one ended his
Merchandise and retired to his house, all the City being as silent as if no
body had been there: at day breaking he did again give notice by his Drum:
for till that time it was not lawful to stir out of the City. In this
temple was a Court wherein they danced, and on this Idols holyday, had erected a
Theater, thirty root square, finely decked and trimmed, in which were
represented Comedies, Maskes, and many other representations to express or
cause mirth and joy.

The Mexicans Acost.l.6.c.7.
had their schools, and as it were Colleges, or Seminaries, where the Ancients
taught the children to say by heart, the Orations, Discourses, Dialogues, and
Poems, of their great Orators and chief men, which thus were preserved by
Tradition as perfectly as if they had been written. And in their Temples, the
sons of the chief men (as Peter P.Mart.Dec.5.l.4.
Martyr reports) were shut up at seven years old, and never came forth
thence till they were marriageable, and were brought forth to be contracted.
All which time, they never cut their hair, they were clothed in black,
abstained at certain times of the year from meats engendring much blood, and
chastned their bodies with often fastings.

And although they had not letters, Acost.l.6.c.9
yet they had their wheel for computation of time, (as is said before) in
which their writings were not as ours from the left hand to the right, or as of
the Eastern Nations, from the right hand to the left, or as the Chinois, from
the top to the bottom: but beginning below did mount upwards; as in that
mentioned wheel, from the Sun which was made in the Center, upwards to the
circumference. Another manner of writing or signing, they had, in circle wise.
In the Province of Yucatan or Honduras, there were books of the Leaves of
trees, folded and squared, which contained the knowledge of the Planets, of
beasts and other natural things, and of their Antiquities, which some
blindly-Zealous Spaniards, taking for enchantments, caused to be burned. The
c.7.
Indians to Tescuco, Talla, and Mexico, showed unto a Jesuit their Books,
Histories, and Calendars, which in figures and Hieroglyphics represented
things after their manner. Such as had form or figure, were represented by
their proper Images, other things were represented by Characters; and I have
seen, says Acosta, the Paternoster, Aue Maria, and Confession thus written.
As, for these words, I a Sinner do confess my self, they painted an Indian,
kneeling on his knees, at a Religious man's feet; To God most mighty, they
painted three faces with their crowns, according to that painting blasphemy
of the popish image-mongers, and so they went on in that manner of picturing
the words of their Popish Confession; where Images failed, setting Characters;
Their Gomara.part 1.page.3.69.
books for this cause were great, which (besides their engrauings in stone,
walls, or wood) they made of Cotton-wooll wrought into a kind of paper, and
of Leaves of Metl, folded up like our broad-cloths, and written on both sides,
Likewise they p.Mart.Dec.4.l.8.
made them of the thin inner-rinde of a Tree, growing under the upper bark
(as did also the ancient Latins, from whence the names of Codex and Liber for
a Book, are derived by our Grammarians.) They did bind them also into some
form of books, compacting them with Bitumen: their Characters were of
Fish-hookes, Stars, Snares, Files, etc. Thus did they keep their private and
public records.

There Gomara vbi sup.
were some in Mexico, that understood each other by whistling, which was
ordinarily used by lovers and thieves, a language admirable even to our wits,
so highly applauded by our selves, and as deeply deiecting these Nations in
terms of feelinesse and simplicity. Yea, in Our Virginia (so I hope and
desire) Cap. Smith told me that there are some, which the spacious divorce of
the wide stream notwithstanding, will by hallowes and howps understand each
other, and entertain conference. The numbers of the Mexicans are simple, till
you come to six, then they count six and one, six and two, six and three; ten
is a number by it self, which in the ensuing numbers, is repeated as in other
languages till fifteen, which they reckon in one term, ten, five, and one,
and so the rest to twenty.

The Mexicans Gom.page.38^.
did believe concerning the soul, that it was immortal, and that men received
either joy or pain, according to their deserts and living in this world. They
held for an assured faith, that there were nine places appointed for souls,
and the chiefest place of glory to be near unto the Sun, where the souls of
good men slain in the Wars, and those which were sacrificed are placed: that
the souls of wicked men abide in the earth, and were divided after this sort:
children which were dead-borne, went to one place: those which died of age or
other disease went to another: those which died of wounds or contagion, to a
third: those which were executed by order of Justice, to a fourth; but
parricides, which slew their Parents, or which slew their Wives or Children, to
a fifth. Another place was for such as slew their Masters or Religious persons.

Acost. l.7.c.^.
Acosta seems to deny that the Indians believed any punishments after death,
and yet sets down an Oration made at Mutezuma's election, wherein he is said
to have pierced the nine Vaults of heaven, which seems to allude to this of
Gomara.

Their burialls also were diverse, as is showed before: and here may ^^^ added
that he which died for Adultery, was shrouded like unto their God of
Lechery, called Tlazonlterel: he that was drowned, like to Tlalos: he that
died of drunkenness like to the God of Wine, Ometochtli, the Soldier, like to
Vitziliputzli. But least you wish me buried in like manner, which trouble as
much my English Reader, with New-Spaines redious Relations, as Old Spaines
fastidious insulting spirits have sometime done in English Nations, I will
adventure further into the adioining Provinces.

is a point of Land extending it self into the Sea, over against the I Will Cuba,
and was first discovered by Francis Hernandes de Cordona in the year 1517. at
which time one asking an Indian how this country was called, he answered
Tectetan Tectetan, that is, I understand you not, which words the Spaniards
corrupting both in the sound and interpretation called it Iucatan, James
Velasques Governor of Cuba, sent his Cousin John de Grijalua the year after,
who there fought with the Indians at Campotan, and was hurt. The Spaniards
P.Mart. Dec. 4.1.
went to a City on the shore which for the greatness they called Cayro of that
great City in Egypt. Here they found Turreted Houses, Stately Temples, ways
pasted, and fair market places. The houses were of stone or Brick, and Lime,
very artificially composed. To the square Courts, or first habitations of their
houses they ascend by ten or twelve steps. The roof was of Reeds, or
stalks of Herbs. The Indians gave the Spaniards Jewels of Gold, very fair
and cunningly wrought, and were requited with Vestures of Silk and Wool,
Glasse-Beades, and little Bells. Their apparel was of Cotton in manifold
fashions and colors. They frequented their Temples much, to the which the
better sort paued ways with stone from their houses. They were great
Idolaters, and were circumcised, but not all. They lived under laws, and
trafficked together with great fidelity, by exchanging commodities without
money. The Spaniards saw Crosses amongst them, and demanding whence they had
them, they said that a certain man of excellent beauty passing by that coast,
left them that notable token to remember him: others said, a certain man
brighter then the Sun died in the working thereof. The Spaniards sailed
thence to This town was taken by Master William Parker. Anno 1596.
Campechium, a town of three thousand houses. Here they saw a square Stage or
Pulpit four cubits high, partly of clammie Bitumen, and partly of small stones,
whereto the image of a man cut in Marble, was joined, two foure-footed
unknown beasts fastening upon him, as if they would tear him in pieces. And by
the image stood a Serpent all besmeared with blood, devouring a Lion, it was
seven and forty foot long, and as big as an Ox. These things I mention as
testimonies of their Art in these barbarous places, and perhaps of their
devotion also, Grijalua or Grisalua seeing a Tower sarre off at Sea, by
direction thereof, came to an Island called Cosumel, agreeing in private and
public manner of life with them of Iucatan: Their houses, Temples, apparel,
and trade of Merchandise all one: their houses some where covered with Reeds,
and where quarries were, with slate: many houses had marble pillars.

They sound ancient Towers there, and the ruins of such as had been broken
down and destroyed: there was one whereto they ascended by eighteen steps or
stairs. The Governor whom they supposed to be a Priest, conducted them to the
Tower: in the top whereof they erected a Spanish Banner, and called also the
Island Santa Cruce. In the Tower they found chambers, wherein were marble
Images, and some of Earth in the similitude of Bears. These they inuoked with
loud singing all in one tune, and sacrificed unto them with somes and sweet
odours, worshipping them as their household Gods. There they performed their
divine ceremonies and adoration: they were also circumcised.

Gomara Gomar.genesis hist.ca.54.
says, that here, and at Xicalanco, the Devil used to appear visibly, and
that these two were great in estimation for holiness; every city had their
Temple, or altar, where they worshipped their Idols, amongst which were many
Crosses of Wood and Brass, whereby some conceive that some Spaniards had
recourse hither when Roderigo was defeated, and Spain ouerrunne by the
Saracens. In both Goma part.1. page.36.
these places they sacrificed men: which Cortes persuaded them to cease. The
Temple in Cosumil or Acusamil was built like a square Tower, broad at the
foot, with steps round about, and from the midst upward very strait: the top
was hollow and covered with straw: it had four windows and porches. In the
hollow place was their Chapel, where stood their Idols. In a Temple by the
Sea side was an uncouth Idol, great and hollow, fastened in the wall with lime:
it was made of earth. Behind this Idols back was the Vestrie, where the
ornaments of the Temple were kept. The Priests had a little secret door hard
adjoining to the Image, by which they crept into his hollow panch, and thence
answered the people that came thither with prayers and petitions, making the
simple people believe it was the voice of the God, which therefore they honored
more then any other, with many perfumes and sweet smells. They offered bread,
fruit, quails blood, and of other birds, dogs, and sometimes men. The fame
of this Idol and Oracle brought many Pilgrims to Acusamil from many places.
At the foot of this Temple was a plot like a churchyard, well walled, and
garnished with Pinnacles, in the midst whereof stood a Cross of ten foot
long, which they adored for the God of rain. At all times when they wanted
rain, they would go thither on procession devoutly, and offered to the
Cross, quails sacrificed, no sacrifice being so acceptable. They burnt sweet
gum to perfume him with, besprinckling the same with water, and by this
means they thought to obtain rain. They could never know, says Gomara,
how that God of Cross came amongst them, for in all those parts of India there
is no memory of any preaching of the Gospel that had bin at any time. What
others think, and what some Indians answered, concerning it, is said before.

Benzo M. Benzo libr.2.ca.15.
writes, that they did not eat the flesh of these men which they sacrificed:
and that they were first subdewed by Francis Montegius, whose cruelties were
such that Alquinotep a Cacique or Indian Lord above an hundred and ten years
old, and a Christian, told him, That when he was a yongman, there was a
sickness of worms, that they had thought all would have died: (they were not
only eiected by vomit, but did eat out themselves a passage through men's
bodies) and not long before the Spaniards arrival, they had two battles with
the Mexicans, in which a hundred and fifty thousand men perished. But all this
was light, in respect of that Spanish burden.

Guatimala Botero libr. 5 part. 1. Guatimala or Saint James.
comes next to our consideration, a Province of pleasant air, and fertile
soil, where grows abundance of their Cacao, which is a fruit that serves
the Indians for meat, drink, and money. The city (which bears the same
name) was first at the foot of a Vulcano or hill which casts fire, but
because in the year 1542, Benzo and Gomara say Sept 8. 1541.
on the six and twentieth day of December, a Lake hidden in the bowels of that
hill, brake forth in many places, and with a terrible violence ruined the most
part of the City: it was removed two miles thence, together with the
Episcopal Sea, and the kings Council. But in the year 1581 there issued from
another Vulcan two miles off, or somewhat more, such an irruption of fire, as
threatened to consume every thing. The day following followed such a shower of
ashes that it filled the valley, and almost buried the City. And yet were not
all the throws passed of this hills monstrous trauells, but the year after,
for the space of four and twenty hours, thence issued a stream of fire, that
drank up five streams of water, burned the stones and rocks, rent the Air
with thunders, and made it a wauing and moving Sea of fire. Before Gas.En.libr.
3.ca.6.
that first eruption of waters, some Indians came and told the Bishop, that
they had heard an incredible noise and murmuirng at the foot of the hill, but
he reproved them, saying, they should not trouble themselves with vain and
superstitious fears; about two of the clock in the night following happened
that deluge, which carried many houses, and whatsoever stood in the way, in
which, five hundred and twenty Spaniards perished, and scarce any mention of
the houses remained.

It is worthy recital which Benzo H. Benzo libr. 2 ca.16. Gomar.bis^er.
genesisca.209.
and Gomara have recorded, that Peter Alvarado the Governor (who by license of
the Pope had married two sisters, the Lady Frances, and the Lady Beatrice della
Culva) having perished by a mischance, his wife not only painted her house
with Sorrows black livery, and abstained from meat and sleep, but in a
mad impiety said, God could now do her no greater evil. Yet for all this
her sorrow, she caused the Citizens to be sworn unto her government (a new
thing in the Indies.) Soon after, this inundation happened, which first of all
assailed the Governors house, and caused this impotent and impatient Lady now
to bethink her of devotion, and betake her to her Chapel, with eleven of her
Maids, where leaping on the Altar, and clasping about an Image, the force of
the water ruined the Chapel; whereas if she had stayed in her bedchamber,
she had escaped death. They tell of uncouth noyses, and hideous apparitions
which then were seen. Benzo observed by his own experience, that this country
is much subject to Earthquakes. The Guatimalans, in manner of life resemble the
Mexicans and Nicaraguans.

Fondura Benzo libr. 2. ca.15.
or Hondura is next to Guatimala, wherein were (says Benzo) at the Spaniards
first coming thither four hundred thousand Indians, but when I was there,
scarcely eight thousand were left: the rest being slain or sold or consumed by
the mines: and those which are left, both here, and in other places, place
their habitation as far as they can, where the Spaniard shall be no cie-sore
unto them. The Spaniards in this province planted five Spanish Colonies, which
all scarcely could number a hundred and twenty houses.

Nicaragua Chap.16.
extends it self from the Chiulatecan mines of Fondura, toward the
South Sea. This Region is not great, but fertile, and therefore called of the
Spaniards Mahumets Paradise, for the plenty of all things; yet in the Summer
time it is so scorched with heat, that men cannot travel but in the night.
Six months, from May to October, are pestered with continual showers, which
the other six wholly want: The Parrots are here as troublesome as Crows and
Rookes with us, and they are forced to keep their corn in like manner from
their spoiling. The people are of like condition to the Mexicans; they feed on
man's flesh. To their daunces they flock two or three hundred in a company,
which are performed with great variety of gestures, vestures, and passions:
Every man in, and, every man out of his humor. Thirty and five miles from
Legeon or Lion, an Episcopal City in this Region, is a Vulcano or flaming
bill, the fire whereof may be seen (in the night) above 100 miles. Some had a
conceit, that molten gold was the matter of this fire. And therefore a certain
Dominican caused a kettle and long chain of iron, to be let down into this
fiery concavitie, where by the violence of the heat, the kettle and part of the
chain was molten. He makes a bigger and stronger, but returns with like
success, and this added, that himself and his 2 companions by eruption of
fire, had almost bin consumed. Gomara Gom genesis bistor.ca.20.
calls this fire Blasio de Ynnesta, and the hill, Masaya. It goes down two
hundred and fifty braces or yards. In this Country they used sodomie and
sacrifices of men. Of this name Nicaragua, Gilgonsales, that first of the
Spaniards discovered these parts, found a King with whom he had much
conference, whom he persuaded to become a Christian: although his prohibition
of wars, and dancing, did much trouble him. This Nicaragua P.M.Dec.6. libr.4.
demanded them if the Christians had any knowledge of the Flood, which drowned
all the Earth, with men and beasts (as he had heard his Progenitors say) and
whether another were to come, whether the earth should be ouer-turned, or the
heaven fall: when, and how the Moon and Stars should loose their light and
motion: who moved those heavenly bodies, where the souls should remain, and
what they should do, being freed from the body, whether the Pope died,
whether the Spaniards came from heaven, and many other strange questions
admirable in an Indian. They worshipped the Sun and other Idols which
Nicaragua suffered Gilgonsales to take out of the great Temple.

In Nicaragua Gom.ca.206.
there were five linages, and different languages: the Coribici, Ciocotoga,
Ciondale, Oretigua, and the Mexican; though this place was a thousand miles
from Mexico, yet were they like them in speech, apparel, and religion: they
had also the same figures instead of letters, which those of Culhua had, and
books a spanne broad, and twelve spannes long, doubled, of many colors. They
differ, as in languages^, so in religions, Of their religious rites thus
writes Gomara: their Priests were all married, except their Confessors, which
heard Confessions, and appointed Penances, according to the quality of the
fault: they revealed not the Confession: they appointed the holidays, which
were eighteen. When they sacrificed, they had a knife of flint, wherewith they
opened him that was sacrificed. The priests appointed the sacrifices, how many
men, whether they were to be women, or slaves taken in battle, that all the
people might know how to celebrate the Feasts, what prayers and what offerings
to make. The Priest went three times about the captive, singing in a doleful
tune, and suddenly opens his breast, annoints his face with the blood, takes
out his heart, divides his body. The heart is given to the Prelate, the feet
and hands to the King, the buttockes to the taker, the rest to the people. The
heads of the sacrifices are set on trees, planted there for that purpose, every
tree has figured in it the name of the Province wherewith they have wars.
Under these trees they many times sacrifice men and children of the Country,
and of their own people, being first bought: for it was lawful for the father
to sell his children. Those which the Pet Mart. dec.6.lib.6. and 7.
Kings bring up of their own people, with better fare then ordinary for
sacrifice, are made believe they shall be some canonized Wights, or heavenly
Deities, and therefore take it gladly. They did not eat the flesh of these, as
they did of the captives. When they eat their sacrificed captives, they made
great feasts, and the Priests and religious men drank much wine and smoke:
their wine is of prunes, Whiles the Priest annoynts the cheeks and mouth of
the Idol with the blood, the others sing, and the people make their prayers
with great devotion and tears, and after go on procession (which is not done
in all Feasts.) The religious have white cotton coats, and other ornaments
which hang down from the shoulders to the legs, thereby to put a difference
between them and others. The Laymen have their banners, with that Idol which
they most esteem, and bags with dust and bodkins, the yong-men have their
bows, darts, arrows; and the guide of all is the image of the Devil set upon
a lance, carried by the most ancient and honorable Priest. They go in order,
the religious singing till they come to the place of their Idolatry, where
being arrived, they spread couerings on the ground, or strew it with roses and
flowers, because their Idols should not touch the ground, and the banner being
stuck fast, the singing cease, and the Prelate beginning, all the rest
follow, and draw blood, some from their tongues, some from their ears, some
from their member, and every man as his devotion likes best, and with that
blood annoint the Image. In the mean while, the youths skirmish and dance for
the honor of their Feast: they cure the wounds, with the poulder of herbs and
coals. In some of these processions they hallow Mayz, besprinckling the same
with the blood of their privities, and eat it.

They may have many women, but one is their lawful wife, which they marry
thus; the Priest takes the Bridegroom and the Bride by the little fingers,
sets them in a Chamber at a fire, and gives them certain instructions, and
when the fire is out, they are married. If he take her for a Virgin, and finds
her otherwise, he may divorce her. Many bring their wives to the Caciques or
Lords to corrupt them, esteeming it an honor. Their Pet.Mart.Dec.6.
Temples were low dark rooms, which they used for their treasury also and
armory. Before the Temple was an high Altar for the Sacrifices, whereon also
the Priest played the Preacher first, and then the Butcher.

Adulterers are beaten, but not slain; the adulterous wife is divorced, and
may not marry again, and her parents are dishonored. Their husbands suffer
them to lie with others in some Feasts of the year. He that forces a Virgin,
is a slave, or pays her dowry: if a slave do it with his Masters daughter,
they are both buried quick. They have common brothels. A thief has his hair
cut off, and is made his slave from whom he has stolen, until he has made
satisfaction, which if he defer long, he is sacrificed, They had no
punishment for him which should kill a Cacique, for (they said) such a thing
could not happen. The riches of Nicaragua Botero.
consists much in a great lake three hundred miles long, and being within
twelve miles of the South Sea, does disemboque it self in the North Sea, a
great way off. In this lake of Nicaragua are many and great fishes. Benzo libr.
2.ca.14. Gamara part.2. ca.32.
One strange kind is that, which the Inhabitants of Hispaniola call Manati: as
for these Inhabitants of the place, the Spanish injuries have chaced them
thence.

This fish somewhat resembles the Otter, is 25 foot long, twelve thick, the
head and tail was like a Cow, with small eyes, his back hard and hairie, he
has only two feet at the shoulders, and those like an Elephants. The females
bring forth young, and nourish them with the vdder, like a Cow. I have seen
and eaten of them (says Benzo) the taste is like swines flesh; they eat
grass. There Pet.Mart. Dec.3.libr.8.
was a King in Hispaniola, which put one of them (being presented him by his
Fishermen) into a lake of standing waters, where it lived five and twenty
years: when any of the servants came to the lake and called Matto Motto, she
would come and receive meat at their hands: and if any would be ferried over
the lake, she willingly yielded her back, and performed this office
faithfully, yea she has carried ten men at once singing or playing. A
Spaniard had once wronged her, by casting a dart at her; and therefore after
that, when she was called, she would plunge down again, otherwise to the
Indians she remained officious. She would be as full of play as a Monkie,
and would wrestle with them: especially she was addicted to one young man,
which used to feed her. This proceeded, partly from her docible nature,
partly, because being taken young, she was kept up a while at home, in the
Kings house, with bread. This fish lives both on land and water. The River
swelling over his banks, into the Lake, this fish followed the stream, and
was seen no more. There was an other strange creature in Nicaragua (they call
it Cascuij) like a black hog, with small eyes, wide ears, cloven feet, a
short truncke or snowt like an Elephant, of so loud a braying, that he would
make men deaf. An other there is with a natural purse under her belly,
wherein she puts her young: it has the body of a Fox, handed and footed
like a Monkie. The Battes in these parts are terrible for biting. The
Inhabitants near the River Suerus are not differing from the rest, but that
they eat not man's flesh. Next, is that neck or narrow extent of Land
stretching between the North and South Seas, and (as it were) knitting the two
great Peninsula's of the North and South America together.

Nombre de Dios signifies the name of GOD, occasioned by the words of Didacus
Niquesa, who after disastrous adventures elsewhere, came hither, and here bade
his men go on shore in the name of GOD; whereupon the Colonie and Plantation
there, was so called: It has a bad situation; and small habitation. Baptista
Antonio the King of Spaines Surueyour counseled to bring Nombre de Dios to
Puerto Bello. It was removed from the former seat, in the year of out Lord
1584. Sir Thomas Baskervile burnt it, and went from thence with his army
toward Panama, in the year 1595.

Darien was called Antiqua Darienis, because Ancisus vowed to our Lady at
Sivill called Maria Antiqua, if she would help him in those Indian Conquests,
he would turn the Caciques house into a Temple: there he planted a Colonie.

It would be tedious to tell of the stirs and civil uncivil brawles betwixt
the Spaniards in these parts Vasques Valboa imprisoned Ancisus, and after
recovered his credit by discovery of the South Sea. For whiles the Spaniards
contended about the weight and sha^ing of their gold which a Cacique had given
them, this Cacique being present, hurled down the gold, not a little
maruelling (as he said) that they would so much contend for that, as if they
could eat or drink it: But if they liked it so well, he would carry them
where their golden thirst should be satisfied. He was deceived in the nature
of that dropsy thirst, which, as a fire quenched with oil, receives thence
greater strength: but he deceived not them in his promise, bringing them to
the South Sea: where Valboa named one province, Golden Castile. And for that
which he spoke of their strife, Benzo libr. ^.ca.23.
as if they could eat or drink those mettalles, the cruelties of the
Spaniards were such, as the Indians, when they got any of them, would bind
their hands and feet, and laying them on their backs, would pour gold into
their mouths, saying in insultation, Eat gold, Christian. This Valboa was put
to death by Arias his father in law.

But now we have mentioned the first Spaniards which planted these parts, it
shall not be a miss to mention some hardships the Spaniards sustained before
they could here settle themselves, which may be an answer to those nice and
delicate conceits that in our Virginian Expedition cast off all hope, because
of some disasters. How the Spaniards dealt one with an other, and how the
Indians dealt with them, you have heard; worse has not followed from any
turbulent emulous spirit of our own; or hostile, of the Virginian, in this
Plantation. And as for famine, Nicuesa's men were so pinched, that (not to
speak of those which perished) one sold Prt.Mart: Dec.2.libr.10.
an old lean mangie dog to his fellows for many castellans of gold: these
flayed the dog, and cast his mangie skin, with the bones of the head among
the bushes. The day following one of them finds it full of maggots, and
shaking: but famine had neither eyes nor sent: he brought it home, sod, and
eat it, and found many customers which gave a Seven shillings and six pedce.
Castellan a dish for that mangie broth. An other found two toads and sodde
them, which a sick man bought for two fine shirts curiously wrought with gold.
Others found a dead man, rotten, and stinking, which putrified carcass they
roasted, and eat. And thus from seven hundred and seventy men, they were
brought so low, that scarce forty (shadows of men) remained to inhabit
D^riena. Much like to this was their success at the river of Plate.

What John Oxenam, Sir Francis Drake, Master Christopher Newport, and other our
worthy Countrymen have a^chieued in these parts against the Spaniards, Master
Hackecluyt in his Voyages relates. It is time for us to pass^ beyond these
Darien Straits, unto that other great Chersonesus or Peruvian America. (***)

CHAP. I.
Of the Southern AMERICA, and of the Countries on the Seacoast betwixt
Dariene and Cumana.

THis Peninsula of the New World extending it self into the South, is in form
somewhat like to Africa, and both Gas.Ens, l.3.c.24.
to some huge Pyramid. In this, the Basis or ground is the Northerly part,
called Terra Firma, from whence it lesseneth it self by degrees, as it draws
nearer the Magellan Straits, where the top of this Spire may fitly be placed.
On the East side it is washed with the North Ocean, as it is termed: On the
West with that of the South, called also the Peaceable. It is Botero, part.1.
l.6.
supposed to have sixteen thousand miles in compass, four thousand in
length; the breadth is unequal. The Eastern part thereof, between the Rivers
Maragnon and Plata, is challenged by the Portugalls; the rest by the Spaniard.
From the North to the South are Ledges of Mountains, the tops whereof are
said to be higher then that Birds will visit; the bottomes yield the greatest
Rivers in the World, and which most enrich the Oceans Storehouse. Orenoque,
Maragnon, and Plata seem to be the Indian Triumviri, Generals of those
Riuer-Armies, and Neptunes great Collectors of his waterie tributes. Orenoque
for Ships is nauigable a thousand miles; for less Vessels, two thousand; in
some places twenty miles broad; in some, thirty. Berreo affirmed to Sir
Walter Raleigh, That a hundred Rivers fell into it, marching under his name and
colors, the leaft as big as Rio Grande one of the greatest Rivers of
America. It extends two thousand miles East and West, and commands eight
hundred miles, North and South. Plata, taking up all the streams in his way,
is so full swollen with his increased store, that he seems rather with big
looks to bid defiance to the Ocean, then to acknowledge homage, opening his
mouth forty leagues wide, as if he would devour the same, and with his
vomited abundance makes the salt waters to recoyle, following fresh in this
pursuit, till in salt sweates at last he melts himself in the Combat.
Maragnon is far greater, whose water having furrowed a Channel of six
thousand miles, in the length of his winding passage, covers threescore and
ten leagues in breadth, and hides his Banks Caelum undiq, and undiq pontus
Nil nisi pontus and aer.
on both sides from him which sayleth in the midst of his proud Current,
making simple eyes believe, that the Heavens always descend to kiss and embrace
his waves. And sure our more-straitned world would so far be accessorie to
his aspiring, as to style him with the royal title of Sea, and not debase his
greatness with the meaner name of a River? This Southern half of America
has also, at the Magellane Straits, contracted, and (as it were) shrunk in it
self, refusing to be extended further in so cold a Climate. The manifold
riches of Mettalls, Beasts, and other things, in the beginning of the former
Book have been declared; and in this, as occasion moves, shall be further
manifested. The Men are the worst part, as being in the greatest parts thereof
inhumane and brutish. The Spanish Towns in this great Tract, and their
Founders, are set down by Pedro de Pedro de Cieza de Leon.Chron. del Peru.

have in this Province of Dariene store of Crocodiles, one of which kind,
Cieza says, was found five and twenty foot long; Swine without tails, Cats
with great tails, Beasts clouen-footed like Kine, otherwise resembling Mules,
saving their spacious ears, and a trunk or snout like an Elephant: there are
Leopards, Lions, Tygres. On the right and left hand of Dariene are found
twenty Rivers, which yield Gold. The men P.M.Dec.3. lib.4.
are of good stature, thin haired; the women wear Rings on their ears and
noses, with quaint ornaments on their lips. The Lords marry as many wives as
them lists, other men one or two. They forsake, change, and sell their wives
at pleasure. They have public Stews of women, and of men also in many places,
without any discredit; yea, this priuiledgeth them from following the Wars.
The young girls having conceived, eat certain herbs, to cause abortion.
Their Lords and Priests consult of Wars after they have drunk the smoke of

a certain herb. The women follow their husbands to the Wars, and know how
to use a Bow. They all paint themselves in the Wars. They need no
Head-peeces, for their heads are so hard Ouiedo calls these Hardheads Cor^^ati.
, that they will break a Sword, being smitten thereon. Wounds received in
War, are the badges of honor, whereof they glory much, and thereby enjoy
some Franchises. They brand their prisoners, and pull out one of their teeth
before. They will sell their children; are excellent swimmers, both men and
women; accustoming themselves twice or thrice a day thereunto. Their Priests
are their Physicians, and Masters of Ceremonies; for which cause, and because
they have conference with the Devil, they are much esteemed. P.Cieza chron.
Per. p.1.c.8.
They have no Temples, nor Houses of devotion. The Devil they honor much,
which in terrible shapes does sometimes appear unto the^; as I (says Cieza)
have heard some of them say. They believe, that there is one GOD in Heaven, to
wit, the Sun, and that the Moon is his wife; and therefore worship these two
Planets. They worship the Devil also, and paint him in such form as he
appears to them, which is of diverse sorts. They offer Bread, Smoke, Fruits,
and Flowers, with great devotion. Any one may cut off his arm which steals
Mais. Enciso, with his Army of Spaniards, seeking to subdue these parts, used
a Spanish trick, telling the Indians, That he sought their conversion to the
Faith, and therefore discoursed of one GOD, Creator of all things, and of
Baptism; and after other things of this nature, less to his purpose, he told
them, That the Pope is the Vicar of CHRIST in all the World, with absolute
power over men's Souls and Religions; and that he had given those Countries to
the most mighty King of Spain, his Master, and he was now come to take
possession, and to demand Gold for tribute. The Indians answered, That they
liked well what he had spoken of one GOD, but for their Religion, they would
not dispute of it, or leave it: And for the Pope, he should be liberal of his
own; neither seemed it, that their King was mighty, but poor, that sent thus
a begging. But what words could not, their Swords effected, with the
destruction of the Indians.

The soil of Vraba is so fattened with a stream therein, that in eight and
twenty days the Seeds of Cucumbers, Melons, and Gourds, will ripen their
Fruits. There is P. Mart. Dec.3.l.6.
a Tree in those Countries, whose leaves, with the bare touch, cause great
blisters: the savor of the Wood is poison; and cannot be carried without
danger of life, except by the help of another herb, which is an Antidote to
this venomous Tree. King P.Mart. Dec.2.l.4.
Abibeiba had his Palace in a Tree, by reason of the moorish situation and
often inundation of his Land. Vasques could not get him down, till he began to
cut the Tree, and then the poor King came down, and bought his freedom at
the Spaniards price.

Carthagena was so called, for some resemblance in the situation to a City in
Spain of that name. Sir Francis Drake took it. The Indians thereabouts used
poisoned Arrows: the women war as well as the men. Enciso took one, who
with her own hands had killed eight and twenty Christians. They did eat the
enemies which they killed. They used to put in their Sepulchers gold, feathers,
and other riches.

Between Carthagena and Martha runs a swift River, called Rio Grande, which
makes the Seawater to give place; and they which pass by, may in the Sea
take in of this water fresh.

In the Valley of Tunia Linschot. l.2.
, or Tomana, are Mines of Emeralds. The people worship the Sun for their
chief God, with such awful devotion, that they dare not look steadfastly upon
it: the Moon also they worship, but in an inferior degree. In their Wars,
in stead of Ensigns, they tie the bones of certain men (who in their lives
had been valiant) upon long staves, to provoke others fo the like fortitude.
They bury their Kings with golden Neck-laces, set with Emeralds, and with
Bread and Wine. The people about Rio Grande are Caniballs, as also about S.
Martha. The Tunians use poisoned Arrows: and when they go to the Wars, they
carry their Idol Chiappen with them; unto whom, before they enter into the
Field, they offer many sacrifices of living men, being the children of slaves,
or of their enemies, painting all the Image with blood; which done, they eat
the flesh. Returning Conquerors, they hold great Feasts, with Dancing,
Leaping, Singing, drinking themselves drunk, and again besmeare their Image
with blood. If they were overcome, they sought by new Sacrifices to appease
Chiappen. They demanded counsel of their Gods for their Marriages, and other
Affairs. For these consultations they observed a kind of Lent two months, in
which they lay not with women, nor eat Salt. They had Monasteries of Boys and
Girls, where they lived certain years. They corrected public faults, as
Stealing, and Killing, by cutting off the ears, and nose; hanging; and if he
were a Nobleman, by cutting off his hair. In gathering Emeralds, they first
used certain Charms. They used to sacrifice Birds, and many other things.

S. Martha stands about fifty leagues from Carthagena, at the foot of
certain Hills, always crowned with Snow. The Indians Nic.Monard, c.53. Gomar.

here are very valorous, and use poisoned Arrows. They make bread of Iucca, a
Root as big as a man's arm, or leg, the juice whereof is poison in the
Islands, and therefore they press it between two stones: but in the firm
Land they drink it raw; and both here and there sodden, they use it for
Vinegar; and being sodden till it be very thick, for Honey. This bread is
their Casaui, not so good as that of Mais. I have seen a Plant of this herb
growing in M. Gerards M.Gerard.
Garden, the picture whereof he has expressed in his Herball. The people are
abominable Sodomites, a badge whereof they ware about their necks; a chain,
with the resemblance of two men committing this villainy. In Gayra the
Sodomites were attyred like women, others were shaven like Friars. They had
women which preserved their Virginity: these addicted themselves to Hunting,
with Bow and Arrows, alone: they might lawfully kill any that sought to
corrupt them. These people were Caniballs, and eat man's flesh, fresh and
pouldered: the young boys which they took they gelded, to make them fatter
for their Tables, as we do Capons. They set up the heads of those they
killed, at their gates, for a memorial, and wore their teeth about their
necks for a bravery. They worship P.Messia, l.5. c.13.
the Sun and Moon, and burn thereto perfumes of Herbs, and Gold, and
Emeralds. They sacrifice slaves.

Venezvel^ is so called, because it is built upon a plain Rock, in the waters
of a Lake. The women of this Country paint their breasts and arms: all the
rest of their body is naked, except their privy parts. The maids are known
by their color, and greatness of their girdle. The men carry their members
in a shell. There are many filthy Sodomites. They pray to Idols, and to the
Devil, whom they paint in such form as he appears to them. They paint
their bodies in this sort. He that has killed one enemy in the Wars, paints
one of his arms; the second time his breast; and when he has killed a third,
he painteth a line from his eyes to his ears: and this is his Knighthood.
Their Priests are their Physicians, who being sent for by a sick man, ask the
patient, if he believe that they can help him; and then lay their hands upon
the place where they say their pains are: if he recover not, they put the
fault in him, or in their Gods. They lament their dead Lords in Songs in the
night time, made of their praises: that done, they roast them at a fire, and
beating them to poulder, drink them in Wine, making their bowels their Lords
Sepulchers. In Zonpaciay they bury their Lords with much Gold, Jewels, and
Pearls, and set upon the grave four sticks in a square, within which they
hang his weapons, and many viands to eat.

From the Cape Vela, the space of two thousand miles along the Coast, is the
fishing for Pearls, discovered by Christopher Columbus, in the year 1498,
which sailed all along this Coast. In P.M.Dec.1.lib.^. Gomar.c.74. to c.84.
Curiana they received the Spaniards with great joy, and for Pinnes, Needles,
Bells, Glasses, and such trifles, gave them many strings of Pearls: for four
Pinnes they would give a Peacocke; for two, a Phesant; for one, a Turtle-doue:
And when they asked, What they should do with this new Merchandise of Pinnes
and Needles, seeing they were naked? they showed them the use to pick their
teeth, and to pick out thorns in their feet. These Indians had Rings of Gold,
and Jewels made with Pearls, after the forms of Birds, Fishes, and Beasts:
They had also the Touchstone for their Metal, and Weights to weigh the same,
things not elsewhere found in India. They make their teeth white with an
herb, which all the day they chew in their mouths.

CHAP. II.
Of CVMANA.

CVMANA is a Province named of a River, called Cumana, Gom.c.76.
where certain Franciscans, Anno 1516, built them a Monastery, and the
Spaniards were very diligent in the fishing for Pearls. About P.M.Dec.7. lib.4.
that time three Dominicans went fourscore miles West from thence to preach
the Gospel, and were eaten of the Indians, which hindered not, but others of
the same Order founded them a Monastery in Ciribici, near Maracapana. Both
these Orders took pains with the Indians to convert them, and taught their
children to write and read, and to answer at Mass, and the Spaniards were so
respected, that they might safely walk alone through all the Country: but
after two years and a half, the Indians, whether for their too much employment
in the Pearle-fishing, or for other cause, rebelled, and killed a hundred
Spaniards, slew the Friars, one of which was then saying Mass, and as many
Indians as they found with them; which the Spaniards of Domingo soon after
revenged.

The loss Gom.c.78.
of Cumana hindered their Trade for Pearls at Cubagua, and therefore the King
sent James Castilion to subdue them by force: which he did, and began the
Plantation of New Caliz, for the Spaniards to inhabit there. Cubagua was
called by Columbus, the Finder, the Island of Pearls, situate in twelve
degrees and a half of Northerly latitude, and contains twelve miles in
circuit. This little Island is exceeding great in commodity, that accreweth by
those pearls, which has amounted to diverse millions of Gold. They fetch
their Wood from Margarita, an Island four miles to the North; and their Water
from Cumana, which is two and twenty miles thence: they have a Spring of
medicinal Water there in the Island. The Sea there, at certain times of the
year, is very read, which those Pearle-oysters by some natural purgation are
said to cause. There are Fishes, or Sea Monsters, which from the middle upwards
resemble men, with Beards, Hair, and Arms. The Cap.79.
people of Cumana go naked, covering only their shame. At Feasts and Daunces
they paint themselves, or else anoint themselves with a certain Gum, in
which they stick feathers of many colors. They cut their hair above the
ears, and will not suffer it to grow on any places of their bodies, esteeming
a bearded man a Beast: They take great pains to make their teeth black, and
account them women, which have them white. They black them with the poulder of
the leaves of a certain Tree called Gay; these leaves they chew, after they
are fifteen years old; they mix that poulder with another of a kind of
Wood, and with Chalk of white shells burned, in manner as the Eastern Indians
use their Betele and Arecca, with Chalk of Oysters: and this mixture they
bear continually in their mouths, still chewing it, that their teeth are as
black as coals, and so continue to their death. They keep it in Baskets and
Boxes, and sell it in the Markets to some, which come far for it, for Gold,
Slaves, Cotton, and other Merchandise. This keeps them from pain, and
rotting of the teeth. The maids go naked, only they bind certain bands hard
about their knees, to make their hippes and thighs seem thick, which they
esteem no small beauty. The married women live honestly, or else their
husbands will divorce them. The chief men have as many wives as they will;
and, if any stranger come to lodge in one of their houses, they make the
fairest his bedfellow, These also shut up their daughters two years before
they marry them, all which time they go not forth, nor cut their hair: After
which, there is made a great Feast, and very many bidden, which bring their
variety of cheer, and also Wood to make the new Spouse a house: A man cuts
off the Bridegroomes hair before, and a woman the Brides, and then eat and
drink, with much excess, till night.

This is the lawful wife, and the other which they marry afterward, obey
this. They give their Spouses to be defloured to their Piaces, (so they call
their Priests) which these reverend Fathers account their Pre-eminence and
Prerogative; the husbands, their honor; the wives, their warrant.

The men and women wear Collars, Bracelets, Pendants, and some Crowns of Gold
and Pearls: the men wear Rings in their noses, and the women Brooches on
their breasts, whereby at first sight the sex is discerned. The women Shoot,
Run, Leap, Swim, as well as the men: their pains of travel are small:
they till the Land, and look to the house, whiles the men Hunt and Fish. They
are high-minded, treacherous, and thirsty of revenge: Their chief weapons are
poisoned Arrows, which they prepare with the blood of Snakes, and other
mixtures. All of both sexes, from their infancy, learn to Shoot. Their meat
is whatsoever has life, as Horseleaches, Battes, Grasshoppers, Spiders, Bees,
Lice, Worms, raw, sodden, fried: and yet their Country is replenished with
good Fruits, Fish, and Flesh. This Diet (or, as some say, their Water) causes
spots in their eyes, which dim their sight. They have as strange a Fence or
Hedge for their Gardens and Possessions, namely, a thread of Cotton, or Bexuco,
as they call it, as high as a man's Girdle; and it is accounted a great sin to
go over or under the same, and he which breaks it (they certainly believe)
shall presently die. So much safer is their thread wouen with this imagination,
then all our Stone-walls.

The P.M. Dec.8.lib.7.
Cumanois are much addicted to Hunting, wherein they are very expert, and kill
Lions, Tygres, Hogs, and all other foure-footed Beasts, with Bows, Nets,
Snares. They take one Beast, which they call Capa, that has the soles of his
feet like a French shoe, narrow behind, broad and round before. Another,
called Aranata, which for the Physnomie and subtletie seems to be a kind of
Ape: it has mouth, hands, and feet, like a man; a goodly countenance, bearded
like a Goat. They go in Herds, they bellow loud, run up Trees like Cats,
avoid the Huntsmans Arrow, and cast it with cleanly delivery again at
himself. Another Beast has a long snout, and feeds on Ants Ouied calls it
a Bear.
, putting his tongue into a hollow Tree, or other place, where the Ants are,
and as many of them as come thereon, he lickes in. The Friars brought up one,
till the stink thereof caused them to kill it, snouted like a Fox,
rough-haired, which voided in the excrements long and slender Serpents, which
presently died. This Beast stinking while he lived, and worse now dead, yet was
good food to the Indians. They have one which will counterfeit the voice of a
crying child, and so cause some to come forth, and then devour them. The like
is written of the Hyena, That she will call the Shepherds by their names, and
then destroy them when they come forth.

They have Parrots as big as Ravens, with bells like Hawks, living on the
prey, and smelling like Musk: Great Battes, one of which was a Physician, by
strange accident, to a servant of the Friars: which being sick of a Pleurisy,
was given over for dead, because they could not raise a vein wherein to let
him blood; in the night a Batte (after the custom of that creature) bit and
sucked him, whereby so much blood issued, that the sick man recovered; which
the Friars counted for a miracle. They have three sorts of Bees, one whereof is
little and black, and makes Honey in the Trees, without Wax. Their Spiders
are greater then ours, of diverse colors, and weaue such strong Cobwebbes,
that they ask good strength to break them. There are Salamanders as big as
a man's hand: they cackle much like a Pullet: their biting is deadly. I might
here hold you too long in viewing these strange Creatures, we will now return
to their stranger customs.

They take great pleasure in two things, Dancing and Drinking, in which they
will spend eight days together, especially at the Marriages, or Coronation of
their Kings. Many gallants will then meet together, diversely dressed; some with
Crowns and Feathers, some with shells about their legs instead of bells, to
make a noise: some otherwise, all painted with 20. colors and figures: he that
goes worst, seems best: taking one another by the hand, they dance in a ring,
some backwards, some forwards, with a world of variety; grinning, singing,
crying, counterfeiting the deaf, lame, blind; fishing, weauing, telling of
stories; and this continues six hours, and then they eat and drink: before,
he which danced most, now he which drinks most, is the most complete and
accomplished gallant: and now beyond counterfeiting, drunkenness sets them
together in brauing, swaggering, quarrelling: others play the swine, spew up
the former to make way for other liquor: and they add hereunto the fume of an
herb, which has the like drunken effect; it seems to be Tobacco.

This perhaps will not seem strange to some, seeing these savage customs of
drinking, dancing, smoking, swaggering, so common with us in these days: it
might indeed seem strange to our forefathers, if their more civil, more
sacred ghosts, might return and take view of their degenerating posterity:
but now he must be a stranger in many companies, that will not estrange
himself from eiuilitie, from humanity, from Christianity, from GOD, to become
of a man a beast; of an Englishman, a Savage Indian; of a Christian, afiend,
save that he has a body, in the diuersified pollutions whereof, he has
advantage, and takes it, to out-swagger the Devil. These are the Gull-gallants
of our days, to whom I could wish, that either their Progenitors had been
some Cumanian Indians, or that they would leave this usurped gallantrie to
those true owners, and resume spirits truly English.

The Gods of the Cumanians are the Sun and Moon, which are taken for Man and
Wife, and for the greatest Gods. They have great fear of the Sun when it
thunders or lightens saying that he is angry with them. They fast when there is
any Eclipse, especially the women: for the married women pluck their hairs,
and scratch their faces with their nails: The maids thrust sharp fish-bones
into their arms, and draw blood. When the Moon is at full, they think it is
wounded by the Sun, for some indignation he has conceived against her. When
any Comet appears, they make a great noise with Drums and hallowing,
thinking so to scarre it away, or to consume it, believing that those Comets
portend some evils.

Among their many Idols and figures, which they honor as Gods, they have one
like a Saint Andrews Cross, which they thought preserved them from
night-spirits; and they hanged it on their newborn children.

They call their Priests Piaces, whose maiden-head-rite we before mentioned.
They are their Physicians and Magicians. They cure with roots and herbs, raw,
sod and pounded, with the fat of birds, fishes, and beasts; with wood and other
things unknown to the people, with abstruse and dark words which themselves
understand not. They suck and lick the place where the pain is, to draw out
the evil humors. And if the pain increases, they say that the Patients are
possessed with evil spirits: and then rub their bodies all-ouer with their
hands, using certain words of Coniuration or Charms, sucking after that very
hard; giving them to understand, that by that means, they call out the evil
spirits. Presently they take a piece of wood, the virtue whereof none else
knows but the Piace, and therewith rub their mouths and throats, so long
till they cast all that is in their bellies, vomiting sometimes blood with the
force thereof; the Piace in the mean time stamping, knocking, calling, and
gesturing: after two hours there comes from him a thick phlegm, and in the
midst thereof a black hard bullet, which those of the house carry and cast
into the fields, saying, Let the Devil go thither. If the sicke-man recover,
his goods die and become the Priests; if he die, they say his time was come.
The Piace is their Oracle, with whom they consult, whether they shall have
war, what shall be the issue thereof, whether the year will be plentiful.
They fore-warne them of Eclipses, and advertise of Comets. The Spaniards
demanded in their necessity, whether any ships would come shortly, and they
answered, that on such a day a Caruell would come with so many men, and such
provision and Merchandise, which accordingly came to pass.

They call upon the Devil in this manner: the Piace enters into a Cave, or
secret place, in a dark night, and carries with him certain courageous
youths, that may move questions without fear. He sits on a bench, and they
stand on their feet, he cries, calls, sings verses, sounds shells: and
they with a heavy accent say many times Prororure, Prororure: if the Devil
comes not, all this Blacke-Sanctus is renewed with grievous sighs and much
perplexity. When he comes (which is known by the noise) he sounds louder,
and suddenly falls down, by visages and varied gesture, showing that the
Devil is entered. The one of those his associates demands what him pleases:
The Friars went one day with their coniuring and coniured holies, the Cross,
Stole, Holy Water: and when the Piace was in that distraction, cast a part of
the Stole on him, crossing and coniuring in Latin, and he answered them in his
native language much to the purpose: at last they demanded whither the souls
of the Indians went, he answered to hell.

These Piaces by their Physic and Divining grow rich: they go to Feasts, and
sit by themselves apart, and drink themselves drunk, and say the more they
drink, the better they can divine. They learn these Arts when they are
children, and are enclosed in the woods two years, all that time eating
nothing that has blood, see no women, nor their own parents, come not out of
their Caves or Cells: and the Piaces, their Masters, go to them by night, to
teach them. When this time of their solitary discipline is past, they obtain
a testimonial thereof, and begin to profess in practice of Physic and
Divination. Let us bury the Cumanois, and then we have done.

Being dead, they sing their praises, and bury them in their houses, or dry
them at the fire and hang them up. At the years end (if he were a great man)
they renew the lamentation, and after many other ceremonies, burn the bones,
and give to his best beloved wife his skull to keep for a relic: they
believe that the soul is immortal, but that it eats and drinks about in
the fields where it goes, and that it is the Echo which answers when one
calls.

CHAP. III.
Of Paria, Guiana, and the neighbor Countries, both on the Coast, and within
the Land.

IN the year 1497. (some add a year more) P. Martyr. Dec.1. lib. 6.
Gom.part.2. cap.84.
Christopher Columbus seeking new Discoueries, after the suffering of
insufferable heats and calmes at sea, whereby the hoopes of his vessels brake,
and the freshwater not able further to endure the hot indignation of that
now-beleeued Burning-Zone, fled out of those close prisons, into the lap of
that father of waters, the Ocean, for refuge, he came at last to Trinidado. The
first Land he incountered, he called by that name; either for devotion, now
that his other hopes were dried up with the heat, or washed into the sea by the
violent showers aboue-boord, and the less (but not less dangerous) which
flowed from his Caske within: or else, for the three mountains which he there
descried. Once, this discovery of land so ravished his spirit, by the
inexpected delivery from danger, as easily carried his impotent thoughts into a
double error, the one in placing earthly Paradise in this Island, (to which
opinion, for the excellency of the Tobacco there found, he should happily have
the smokie subscriptions of many humorists, to whom that fume becomes a fools
Paradise, which with their brains, and all, passes away in smoke) the other
was, that the Earth was not round like a ball, but like a pear, the upper
swelling whereof, he esteemed these parts. Hence Columbus failed to Paria, and
found out the Peare-fishing, of which Petrus Alphonsus, a little after made
great commodity by trade with the Savages. He was assailed with eighteen
Canoas of Canibals, P. Martyr. Dec.1.lib 8. Of the Canibals, see Chapter 13.
one of which he took, with one Canibal, and a bound Captive, who with tears
showed them that they had eaten six of his fellows, and the next day he must
have gone to pot too: to him they gave power over his Iaylour, who with his
own clubbe killed him, still laying on when his brains and guts came forth,
and testified, that he needed not further fear him.

In Haraia of Paria, they found plenty of salt, which the Foreman in Natures
shop and her cheese workman, the Sun, turned and kerned from water into salt:
his workhouse for this business, was a large plain by the waters-side. Here
the Sepulchers of their Kings and great men seemed not less remarkable: they
laid the body on a kind of hurdle or grediron of wood, under which they
kindled a gentle fire, whereby keeping the skin whole, they by little and
little consumed the flesh. These dried carcasses they held in great reverence,
and honored for their household-Gods. In the year Gom.cap.85.
1499. Vincent Pinzon discovered Cape Saint Augustine, and failed along the
coast from thence to Paria.

But why stand we here pedling on the coast for Pearls, Salt, and Tobacco?
let us rouse up higher spirits, and follow our English guides for Guiana.

In the year 1595. Sir Walter Raleigh. Guiana.
Sir Walter Raleigh having before received intelligence of this rich and
mighty Empire, set sorth for the Discovery, and on the two and twentieth of
March anchored at Point Curiapan in Trinidado, and searched that Island, which
he found plentiful. He took the City of Saint Joseph, and therein Antony
Berreo the Spanish Governor: Leaving his ships, he went with an hundred men
in boats, and a little galley, and with some Indian Pilots passed along that
admirable confluence of Rivers, (as by the Corpse dugnard) unto Orenoque, as
great a commander of Rivers, as the Emperor of Guiana of soldiers. And
although we have before mentioned somewhat thereof, yet this, his peculiar
place, requires some further consideration. This River Orenoque or Baraquan
(since, of this Discovery, called Raleana) runs from Quito in Peru on the
East, it has nine branches which fall out on the North side of his own maine
mouth, on the South side seven. Thus many arms has this Giantlike stream to
be his purueyers, which are always filling his never filled mouth (seeming by
this their natural officiousness incorporate thereunto, and to be but wider
gapings of the same spacious jaws) with many Islands and broken grounds, as it
were so many morsells and crummes in his greedy chappes, still opening for
more, though he cannot, even in Winter, when his throat is glibbest, altogether
swallow these; yea these force him, for fear of choking, to yaune his widest,
and to vomit out, between these cleaving morsels, into the Oceans lap, so
many streams, and (so far is it from the Northern and Southern extremes)
three hundred miles distant. The Inhabitants on the Northern branches are the
Tiuitinas, a goodly and valiant people, which have the most manly speech, and
most deliberate (says Sir Walter) that ever I heard, of what Nation soever. In
the Summer they have houses on the ground, as in other places: in the Winter
they dwell upon the trees, King Abibeiba dwelt on a tree, in the Country of
Dariena. Pet. Martyr^ Dec. 3. lib.6.
where they build very artificial Towns and Villages: for between May and
September the River of Orenoque rises thirty foot upright, and then are those
Islands ouer-flowen twenty foot high, except in some few raised grounds in the
middle. This waterie store, when the clouds are so prodigal of more then the
Rivers storehouse can hold, whereby they become violent intruders and
incrochers upon the land, and not the violence of cold, gives this time the
title of Winter. These Tiuitinas never eat of any thing that is set or sown;
Natures nurslings, that neither at home nor abroad, will be beholden to the art
or labor of Husbandry. They use the tops of Palmitos for bread, and kill
Dear, Fish, and Porke, for the rest of their sustenance. They which dwell upon
the branches of Orenoque, called Capuri and Macureo, are for the most part
Carpenters of Canoas, which they fell into Guiana for gold, and into Trinidado
for Tobacco, in the excessive taking whereof, they exceed all Nations. When a
Commander dies, they use great lamentation, and when they think the flesh of
their bodies is putrified and fallen from the bones, they take up the carcass
again, and hang it up in the house, where he had dwelt, decking his skull with
feathers of all colors, and hanging his gold-plates about the bones of his
arms, thighs and legs. The Ar^^cas which dwell on the South of Orenoque,
beat the bones of their Lords into powder, which their wives and friends drink.

As they passed along these streams, their eyes were entertained with a
Pageant of Shows, wherein Nature was the only Actor; here the Dear came
down feeding by the waters side, as if they had desired acquaintance with
these new-come guests: there, the birds in unspeakable variety of kinds and
colors, rendering their service to the eye and ear: the lands either in large
plains, of many miles, baring their beautiful bosoms, adorned with Floras
embroidery of unknown flowers and plants, and prostrating themselves to the
eye, that they might be seen; or else lifting up themselves in hills, knitting
their furrowed brows, and strouting out their goggle eyes to watch their
treasure, which they keep imprisoned in their stony walls, and now, to see
these strangers: the waters (as the Graces) dancing with mutual and manifold
embracings of diverse streams, attended with plenty of foul and fish; both
land and water feasting variety of senses with variety of objects: only the
Crocodile (a creature which seems vassal, now to the land, now to the water,
but to make prey on both) well-nigh marred the play, and turned this Comedy
into a Tragedy, even in their sight, feasting himself with a Negro of their
company.

One level passed hence to Cumana, an hundred and twenty leagues to the
North, wherein dwell the Say^a, the Assawa^, the Wikiri, and the Aroras, a
people as black as Negros, but with smooth hair. Their poisoned arrows, like
cruel executioners, do not only kill, but with uncouth torments make death to
be, as the last, so the least of their fury; especially if men drink after
they are wounded.

At the Port of Morequito they anchored, and the King being an hundred and ten
years old, came a foot fourteen miles to see them, and returned the same day.
They brought them store of fruits, and a sort of Paraquitos, no bigger then
Wrennes, and an Ouied. in Summar. calls it Bardato.
Armadilla, which seems to be all barred over with small plates, somewhat
like to a Rhinoceros, with a white horn growing in his hinder-parts, as big
as a great hunting horn, which they use to wind in stead of a Trumpet. They
after eat this beast. Monardus Monard.c.37.
says, it is in bigness and snout like a Pigge, lives under the earth as a
Moule, and is thought to live on earth.

They passed further, till they came in sight of those strange ouer-falls of
Caroli, of which there appeared ten or twelve in sight, every one as high over
the other as a Church-Tower. They had sight at Winicapora of a mountain of
Crystal, which appeared a far off like a white Church-Tower, of an exceeding
height. There falls over it a mighty River, which touches no part of the
side of the mountain, but rushing over the top, falls to the ground with so
terrible noise, as if a thousand great bells were knocked one against another.
No marvel of these roaring outcries, if we consider that double penalty of
sense and loss, which this River seems to sustain, the one in that
dreadful downfall, bruising and breaking his united streams into drops, and
making it foming and senseless with this falling sickness; the other in
leaving behind his Crystal purchase, further enriched with Diamonds and other
jewels, which even now he embraced in his watery arms, but himself (such is
the course and curse of covetousness) will not suffer himself to enjoy.

Now for the Monsters of men: there are said to be (not seen by our men, but
reported by the Savages and other) an Amazonian nation further South: which
Gomara thinks to be but the wives of some Indians (a thing common, as you have
even now read) shooting and following the wars, no less then their husbands:
once, about Iucatan, about Plata, about the River, called of this supposition,
Amazones: about Monomotapa in Africa; our age has told, but no man has seen
this Vnimammian Nation. Yet here they speak not of searing of the breast: and
what need they, if there be such, seeing the women are so good Archers in
other places, their breasts notwithstanding? Again, L.Keymi^.
they tell of men with mouths in their breasts, and eyes in their shoulders,
called Chiparemai, and of the Guianians, Ewiaponom^s, very strong; and of
others headed like dogs, which live all the day time in the sea. These things
are strange, yet I dare not esteem them fabulous: only (as not to prodigal
of faith) I suspend, till some eye-intelligence of some of our parts have
testified the truth.

It were a hard task to muster all that world of Rivers, and names of Nations
in the parts near Guiana, which they that will, may find in Sir Walter and
Master Keymis their own relations. As for Guiana, this Sir Walter has
written. It is directly East from Peru toward the Sea, and lies under the
Equinoctial: it has more abundance of gold then any part of Peru, and as many
or mo great Cities. It has the same Laws, Government, and Religion; as Manoa,
the Imperial City of Guiana, which some Spaniards have seen, and they call
it The gilded Cit^^.
El Dorado, for the greatness, riches, and situation, far exceeds any of the
world, at least so much of it as the Spaniards know. It is founded upon a Lake
of salt water, two hundred leagues long, like unto the Caspian sea. The
Emperor of Guiana is descended from the Ingas, the magnificent Princes of
Peru: for when Francis Picarro had conquered Peru, and slain Atabalipa the
King; one of his younger brethren fled from thence, and took with him many
thousands of those soldiers of the Empire, called Ore^^nes, with whom and
other his followers, he vanquished all that tract which is between the great
Rivers of Orenoque, and Amazones.

Diego Ordas who was one of the Captains of Cortes, in the conquest of Mexico,
in the year 1531. made search for Guiana, but lost himself, being slain in a
mutiny. Before this, his provision of power was fired, and one Iuan Martinez,
which had the charge thereof, was therefore condemned to be executed. But at
the soldiers request his punishment was altered, and he set in a Canoa alone
without victual, and so turned loose into the River. Certain Guianians met
him, and having never seen man of that color, they carried him into the Land
to be wondered at; and so from Town to Town, till he came to the great City
of Manoa, the seat and residence of Inga the Emperor. He no sooner saw him,
but he knew him to be a Christian (for the Spaniards not long before had
conquered his brother) and caused him to be well entertained in his Palace. He
lived seven months in Manoa, but was not suffered to wander any whither into
the Country: he was also brought thither all the way blindfold, led by the
Indians, until he came at Manoa. He entered the City at noone, and traveled
all that day till night, and the next, from the rising till the setting of the
Sun; through the City, ere he came to the Palace of Inga. After seven months,
the Emperor put him to his choice, whether to stay or go, and he with the
Emperors license departed. He sent with him many Guianians, all laden with as
much gold as they could carry; but before he entered Orenoque, the Orenoqueponi
robbed him of all, but of two bottells of gold-beads, which they had thought
had been his drink or meat. Thus escaped he to Trinidado, and died after at
Saint Iuan de Puerto-rico, where, in his extremes he uttered these things to
his Confessor. He called the City Manoa El Dorado the gilded or golden,
because that at their drunken solemnities (in which vice no Nation under heaven
excells them) when the Emperor carowseth with any of his Commanders, they that
pledge him, are stripped naked, and their bodies anointed with a kind of
white Balsamum, and then certain servants of the Emperor, having prepared
gold made into fine powder, blow it through hollow canes upon their naked
bodies, until they be all shining from the foot to the head; and in this sort
they sit drinking by twenties and hundreds, and continue in drunkenness
sometimes six or seven days together. Upon this sight, and for the abundance
of gold he saw in the City, the Images in the Temples, the Plates, armours,
and shields of gold used in their wars, he gave the City that name.

Iuan Iuan de Castellanos ap. Hak.
de Castellanos reckons twenty several Expeditions of some or other
Spaniards, for this Guianian Discovery with little effect, save that diverse
lost their lives therein. How it now stands, I know nor. Ganzalo Picarro
Lopez Vaz ap. Hak tom 3.
sent a Captain named Orellana, from the borders of Peru, who with fifty men
were carried by the violent current of the River, that they could not return
to Picarro, he descended not in Orenoque the Guianian River, but in Maragnon,
called of him Orellana: which Josephus Acosta lib.2. cap.6.and 3.c.^^.
Acosta writes, from the relation of one of their society; who, being a boy,
had been in the Expedition of Pedro de Orsua for this discovery, and had
sailed the River through, that in the midst men can see nothing but the sky
(as before is said) and the River, and that it is seventy leagues broad under
the Equinoctial. Martine M.Fernand. de E^ciz 1. ap.Hak.
Fernandez makes it seven degrees and a half to the North of the Line, and
fifteen leagues broad, and the Sea of fresh water to be another River of forty
leagues breadth: others have written otherwise, which varying proceeds from
that variety of arms or mouths of Orenoque or Raleana, and Marannon or
Amazones, which since have been better discovered, as L. Keymis. T. Masham.
Master Keymis, Master Masham and others employed in this action, have found by
experience. It Lop. Gom. cap.86.
rises in Quito. Orellana sailed in it six thousand miles. In all these parts
their greatest trelasure is multitude of women and children. Topiawari made a
heavy complaint, that whereas they were wont to have ten or twelve wives, now
they had not above three or four, by reason of the wars with the Epuremei
their enemies: whereas the Lords of the Epuremes had fifty or an hundred, and
their war is more for women, then either for gold or dominion.

Berr^o in the search for Guiana, took his journey from Nueno reyno de
Granado, wherehe dwelt, with seven hundred Horse, but traveling he lost many
of his company and Horse: at Amapaia the soil is a low marish, and the water
issuing through the Bogges, is red and venomous, which poisoned the horses, and
infected the men: at noone the Sun had made it more wholesome for their use.

This Lop. Vaz.
New Kingdom of Granada is two hundred leagues within land, Southward from
Cartagena. It had that name, because the Captain that discovered it, was of
Granada in Spain. The plenty of Emeralds in these parts, has made that Gemme
of less worth. The next Province to this is called Popayan: in both which the
Spaniards have many Towns. And by the River of Orenoque, both may be invaded.

From these Countries issues another great River, P. Martyr. Dec.7.lib.10.and
Dec.3.lib.4.
called of the Inhabitants Dabaiba (the Spaniards have named it Rio Grande, and
the River of Saint John) it passes with a Northern discovery, into the Gulf
of Vraba before mentioned. They which dwell on this River observe an Idol of
great note, called by the name of the River, Dabaiba: whereto the King at
certain times of the year sends slaves to be sacrificed, from remote
Countries, from whence also is great resort of Pilgrims. They kill the flaues
before their God, and after burn them, supposing that odor acceptable to their
Idol, as Taper-lights, and Frankincense (says Martyr) is to our Saints.
Through the displeasure of that angry God, they said that all the Rivers and
fountains had once failed, and the greatest part of men perished with famine.
Their Kings in remembrance hereof, have their Priests at home, and Chapels
which are swept every day, and kept with a religious neatnes. When the King
thinks to obtain of the Idol, sunshine, or rain, or the like; he with his
Priests gets up into a Pulpit, standing in the Chapel, purposing not to
depart thence till his suit be granted. They urge their God therefore with
vehement prayers, and cruel fasting: the people mean while macerating
themselves also with fasting, in four days space not eating nor drinking,
except on the fourth day, only a little broth. The Spaniards asking what God
they worshipped thus, they answered, the Creator of the Heavens, Sun, Moon,
and all invisible things, from whom all good things proceed. And they say
Dabaiba They say Dabaiba was a woman of great wisdom, honored in her life,
deified after death; to whom they ascribe thunder and lightning, when she is
angry.
was the mother of that Creator. They call them to their Devotions with
certain Trumpets and Bells of gold. The Bells had clappers like in form to
ours, made of the bones of fishes, and yielding a pleasing sound, as they
reported: which no doubt, was a pleasing sound and music to the Spaniards
covetous hearts, howsoever it agrees with the nature of that metal to ring
in the ears. One of them, they say, weighed six hundred Pensum exceeds the
Ducat a fourth part.
Pensa. Their Priests were enjoined chastity, which vow, if they violated, they
were either stoned or burned. Other men also in the time of that fast, likewise
contained themselves from those carnal pleasures. They have an imagination on
the soul (but know not what substance or name to ascribe unto it) to which yet
they believed, was assigned future joys or woes, according to their demerits,
pointing up to Heaven, and down to the Center, when they spoke thereof. Many
of their wives (for they might have many) followed the Sepulchers of their
husbands. They allow not marriage with the sister, of which they have a
ridiculous conceit of the spot, which they account a man, in the Moon, that
for this Incest he was thither confined, to the torments of cold and moisture,
in that Mooneprison. They leave trenches on their Sepulchers, in which they
yearly power Mayes, and some of their wine (to the profit) as they think of
the ghosts. If a mother die while she gives suck, the poor nursling must not
be Orphan, but be interred with her, being put there to her breast, and buried
alive. They imagined that the souls of their great men and their familiars
were immortal, but not others: and therefore such of their servants and
friends as would not be buried with them, they thought should lose that
privilege of immortality, and the delights of those pleasant places, where was
eating, drinking, dancing, and the former delicats of their former lives. They
renew the funeral pomp of these great men yearly, assembling thither with
plenty of wine and meats, and there watch all night (especially the women)
singing drery lamentations, with inuectiues against his enemies, if he died in
the wars, yea cutting the image of his enemy in peece^ in revenge of their
slain Lord. This done, they fall to drinking of Mays-wine till they be weary,
if not drunken. Yet after this, they resume their songs to his commendation,
with many dances and adorations. When day appears, they put the image of the
deceased into a great Canoa (a boat of one tree, capable, of threescore oars)
filled with drinks, herbs, and such things as in his life he had loved: which
some carry upon their shoulders in procession about the Court, and set it down
there again, and burn it with all the contents. After which, the women,
filled with wine, and emptied of all modesty, with loose hair, secrets not
secret, and variety of Bacchanall gestures, sometimes go, sometimes fall,
sometimes shake the weapons of the men, and conclude with beastly sleeping on
the ground. The young men exercise their dances and songs, piercing the middle
of their privy member with the sharp bone of the Ray-fish, bedewing the
pauement with the blood. And their Bauti, who are their Physicians, and
Priests, heal the same again in four days. The have in those parts
Magicians, without whose advice they attempt nothing: and neither hunt, fish,
nor gather gold, except the Tequenign^ or Wizard think it fit.

To end this Dabaiban Story, Martyr says (for I will not further engage my
credit for the truth) that in Camara, which is at the head of this River, there
happened most terrible tempests from the East, which threw down trees and
houses, and in the last act of that tragedy, were brought (not by
representation) two foul monsters of monstrous fowls, such as the Poets
describe the Harpies with wome^s faces; one of them so great, that her legs
were thicker then a man's thigh, so heavy, that the boughs of the trees could
not bear her, so strong, that she would seize on a man, and fly away with him,
as a Kite with a chicken: the other was less, and supposed to be the young one
of the other. Corales, Osorius, and Spinosa, told Martyr that they spoke with
many who saw the greater killed, which was done by a stratageme; for they made
the image of a man, and set it on the ground, attending in the woods with their
arrows, till she the next morning seized on this prey, and lost her self; the
young was never seen after; and happily you think, not before neither. But they
added, that the killers of her were honored as Gods, and rewarded with presents.

these parts, form golden Castile, and the Gulf of Vraba to Paria, yield
Caribes or Canibals, which eat man's flesh, and geld children, to make them more
fat and tender for their diet. And all the Inland parts near Peru, and in the
hills called Andes, which some call Golden Castile, they little differ. Cieca
Cieca part.1.cap.15.
says, That in the Valley of Anzerma, they keep certain tablets amongst the
reeds, wherein they carue the image of the Devil, in a terrible shape, also
the figures of Cats and other Idols which they worship. To them they pray for
rain or fair weather: they have commerce with the Devil, and observe such
superstitions as he enioyneth them. They are great maneaters. At the doors of
their houses they have small Courts, wherein are their graves in deep vaults,
opening to the East: in which they bury their great men with all their wealth.
The Curies are not far from them; they have no Temple, nor Idol. They have
conference with the Devil. They marry with their neeces and sisters, and are
man-eaters. They call the Devil Xixarama. They esteem Virginity little worth.
In the Province of Cap.19.and d.
Arma the Devil does often appear to the Indians: in honor of whom they
sacrifice their captives, taken in war, hanging them up by the shoulders and
pulling out the hearts of some of them. In Paucora they have like devilish
devotions, and their Priests are their Oracles.

Before the house of the chief Lord was an Idol, as big as a man, with his
face to the East, and his arms open. They sacrificed two Indians every Tuesday
in the Province of the Devil. In the Province of Pozo, in the houses of their
Lords, they had many Idols in such resemblance as the Devil had assumed in his
apparitions. And in those Idols he would also speak and give answers. In
Carrapa Chap.23.
they are extreme drunkards: when any is sick, they offer sacrifices to the
Devil for his recovery. In Quinbaya is a hill which casts forth smoke: but a
more hellish smoke is their conference and commerce with the Devil, like the
former. In the Province of Cali they likewise confer with the Devil: they
have no Temples or houses of Religion. They make deep pits for Sepulchers of
their great men, where their armor, wealth, and food is set about them. Their
lust subiecteth the niece and sister to their marriages. In Popayan Chap.32.
they are man-eaters, as also in the forenamed Provinces. They observe the same
Caninall and Devilish Rites with the former, framing their superstitions to
the Devils direction in their mutual colloquies. They bury with their Lords
some of his wives and provision. Some of them are great Wizards and Sorcerers.
In Pasto they talk also with the Devil, a thing common to all these parts of
the Indies. But let us leave these steep and cold hills, these men of the
Devil whom they worship, and devils to men whom they devour, and see if in
the lower Countries we can find higer and nobler spirits.

CHAP. IIII.
Of Brasil.

AS Guiana is bounded with those mighty Rivers of Orenoque and Marannon, so
Brasil extends it self North and South, between Marannon and the river of
Plata or Silver, which three we have already showed to be the greatest Rivers
in the World. The Western Borders are not so well discovered. The Eastern are
washed by the Sea. Maffaus P. Maffaeus hist. Ind. lib.2.P. Bert.Geograp. Mag.

has largely described the same, whose words Bertius, Maginus, and Gasper Ens
have transcribed: the sum whereof Iarric and Boterus have inserted into their
French and Italian Relations.

Petrus Alnarus Capralis, being sent by Emanuel, King of Portugal, in the year
1500. unto the East Indies, to avoid the calmes on the Guinnee shore, fetched a
further compass West, and so discovered the Continent, which now of that red
wood there plentifully growing, is called Brasil, but by him was named the Land
of the Holy Cross, because he had there erected a Cross with much ceremony.
This Brasil was soon after by Americus Vesputius, at the charges of the said
King, further discovered. The Region is pleasant and wholesome, the hills and
valleys equally agreeing in their vnequalnesse, the soil fat and fertile:
there are plenty of Sugarcanes; a kind of Balm expressed out of the herb
Copaibas, and many fruits which the Country naturally produces; besides those
which our Europe has communicated. Many sorts there are of beasts, as a kind
of Swine Which feeds on grass, sleeps in the water. Boterus.
which live in both Elements, their forefeet, being short in proportion to the
hinder, make them slow in running, and therefore being hunted, commit
themselves quickly to the water. Anta, resembling a Mule, but somewhat less;
slender snouted, the nether chappe very long, like a Trumpet, with round ears
and short tails, hiding themselves in the daytime, The Spaniards call it (of
the contrary) the ligh^ dog. The Portugals Sloth. The Indians, Hay. Some have
written that it lives of air; and seldom or never has it been seen eating.
and feeding in the night, the flesh tastes like Beef: there is also the
Armadillo; the Tygre, which being hungry, is very hurtful; being full, will
flee from a dog: there is a deformed beast of such slow pace, that in
fifteen days it will scarce go a stones cast. It lives on the leaves of
trees, on which it is two days in climing, and as many in descending, neither
shouts nor blows forcing her to amend her pace. The Tamendoas are as big as a
Ram, with long and sharp snouts, a tail like a Squirrell, where-vnder they
hide themselves, will put out their tongue two foot, to gather plenty of Ants
into their mouths, having scraped up the places where they keep with their
paws. The Portugals have there raised plenty of horses and sheep. The men
worship no God at all, but are given to sooth-sayings. The men and women go
altogether naked, are flat-nosed, make themselves black with the fruit
Genipapi, wear their hair hanging from the hinder part of the head, not
suffering it elsewhere to grow: in their nether lips wear long stones for a
gallantrie (which being removed, they seem in deformed manner to have a double
mouth) they go together by companies with great silence, the wife going before
her husband. They entertain and welcome strangers at first with weeping and
deep sighs, pitying their tedious journey, and presently dry their eyes,
having tears at command. Women in travel are delivered without great
difficulty, and presently go about their household business, the husband in
her stead keeps his bed, is visited of the neighbors, has his broths made
him, and iunkets sent to comfort him. They are ignorant of They know no numbers
further then five, the rest they supply as they can with their toes and
fingers: and if the things numbered exceed, they number by the toes and fingers
of many persons assembled together. Stad. lib.2. c.29.
numbering and letters: some Tradition they are said to have touching Nae and
the Flood. Under the same roof (which is like a boat with the keele upwards)
live many families, they lie in nets or beds hanging above the ground (which
is usual in a great part of the Indies) to avoid hurtful creatures: they
mind the day, and are not careful for the morrow, easily communicate what
they have, are very patient of labor and hunger, feasting if they have
wherewith, from morning till night, and fasting other-whiles, when they want,
three days together. In swimming they are miraculously skillful, and will diue
whole hours to search any thing under the water. They believe not any reward
or punishment after this life ended, but think that as men die, so they go to
the other world, maimed, wounded, sick or whole: and therefore, bury the
bodies with a net to lie in, and food for some days, thinking that they both
sleep and eat. They are excellent archers, and what enemies they take in their
wars, they feed well many days, and then kill and eat them for great dainties.
They dwell in houses scattered and separated from each other; their language is
almost generally the same; they have no laws nor Magistrates; the women call
certain things by one name, and the men by another. They have no use of three
letters It seems otherwise by Lerius his dialogue of that language.c.20.
in the Alphabet, L, F, R, a reason whereof some have wittily given, because
they have no Law, Faith, nor Ruler. They are unmindful of good tarnes, and too
mindful of injuries: impotent of lust and rage, and in sum, more like
beasts then men. Thus far Maffaeus.

Let us in the next place hear such as have lived in the Country: of which
Lerius and Theuet, two Frenchmen, and Ioannes Stadius a German, have written
several Treatises.

Ioannes Stadius Io.Stad. Hessi cum picturis. a^. T.de Bry in 3. part Americae.
in the year 1554. was prisoner to the Tuppin Imbas, and because he served the
Portugals, should have been slain and devoured. But by GODS mercy he
escaped. He was the Gunner in the Fort of Saint Vincent, and going into the
wood to provide somewhat wherewith to entertain some friends then come to him,
became himself a prey to those men-hunters. When they had taken him, they
contended which of them had been the first taker, and that controversy ended,
he was stripped naked and led away. He was given to one of their Kings, and
this victory by them was ascribed to their Tamaraka, or Idols, which they said
had by Oracle prophesied thereof. But their Kings were no other then the chief
in every cottage, which consisted of one kindred, and these Tamaraka were
certain rattles, as shall after appear. The manner is, that it gets them a
great name, to exhibit this feast of a slain captive, and therefore some that
have taken, will credit some other friend with the gift of a captive to this
solemn butchery, on condition to repay him the next captive he takes. This
was Stadius his case, who was thus tossed by exchange from one to another, till
at last he escaped altogether. But when he had been newly taken, the women came
about him, and one while buffeted him, one saying, this is for such a friend of
mine, that the Peros or Portugals had slain; another fixing on his flesh the
memorial of another friend of hers, and then lead him with a rope about his
neck, almost strangling him, making him also to dance in the midst of them,
with rattles tied to his legs: but he after grew in some credit and respect
amongst them, and saw diverse others eaten, while himself could not be free
from fear of the like destiny. The Savages, that they take, put on a great
show of resolution, and little regard (in seeming) that their tragedy,
supported with this comfort, that their friends will revenge it. In time of
sickness or sudden dangers, they would resort to him to pray to his GOD for
deliverance; and this conceit of his GOD, which they observed in his Devotions,
was the principal means of deferring his execution. Such as are mortally
wounded in their fights, they would spend presently, or at least kill and
dress them, for a feast near at hand: and one man that had lived long amongst
them, and was desperately sick, left Death should deptiue them of their
cheer, they slew, and (because of his sickness) hurling away the head and
inwards, eat up the rest. They take great pride in this their cruelty, and when
K^nyan Bebe their King, having a basket full of pieces of man's flesh, on which
he was feeding, offered Stadius a piece, who told him that it was more then
beastly, he answered, I am a Tigre, and I delight in these delicacies. This
Stadius after escaped in a French ship.

Nicolas Durantius, Lerius hist. Nu^g.in Amer.
a Knight of Malta, sir-named Villagagnon, in the year 1555. (malcontent with
his estate at home) sailed into Francia Antarctica, or the Southern parts of
Brasil, under the Tropike of Capricorn, and pretended there to worship GOD
according to the purity of the Gospel, and to fortify, both for the
habitation of his own, and for a Sanctuary unto such as at home were
persecuted for the truth. He fortified and sent thence to Geneua for assistance
in this his holy intent: whereupon Richerius and Charterius, two Ministers, with
diverse others, among whom was John Lerius, were sent, and landed there in the
year 1577. Lerius has written his observations of these parts, as Theuct
also, another of Villagagnons company, but (as Lerius testifies) in many
things falsely. The first Savages that Lerius and his fellows saw, were the
Margaiates, which hold friendship with the Portugals, and are enemies to the
French, and to the Touou Pinambaulsy, or Tuppin Imbas, confederates of the
French, and as deadly enemies to the former. In the mean way they passed by
the Tapem^ry, Paraiba, Ouctacates, all which, howsoever they exercise
hostilities, and mutual disagreements, yet agree in like barbarous and
rightlesse Rites. With the Touou-Pinambaulsy he conuersed familiarly about a
year. They are in habit of body like the Europeans, but stronger, and less
subject to sickness, not subject to our bodily distempers, by like
intemperance, or vexation of mind, by turbulent and distracting passions of
covetousness, envy, ambition. They are all naked, except sometimes the old
men, rather to hide their disease in those parts, then their shame, cover their
priuities. They wear in their nether lip a Great at one end, and little at
the other: in their infancy it is a bone: and after a green stone, in some as
long as ones finger: they will thrust out their tongue at the hole, when the
stone is removed.
Pyramidall stone, which bravery weighs down their lip, and subiecteth the
face to great deformity. Some also not content with this, add two others in
their cheeks to like purpose. They press down the noses of their Infants to
make them flat. They annoint themselves with a kind of gum, which they cover
with the down of feathers sticking thereto. They wear also frontlets of
feathers: in their ears they wear bones. They which will excel the rest in
gallantry, and would seem to have slain and eaten the most enemies, slash and
cut their flesh, and put therein a black powder, which never will be done
away. They use rattles of the shell of a certain fruit, in which they put
stones or grains, and call them Maraca, of which they have some superstitious
conceit. The women differ from the men in nourishing their hair, which the men
shave off before, and make not those holes in their lips; but in their ears
wear earings of the form and bigness of a mean candle. They paint also their
faces with diverse colors, and wear bracelets of little bones, of which the
men wear chains or collars. They would not wear clothes, pretending their
custom of nakedness, and often washing (sometimes ten times in a day) whereto
clothes would be a hinderance: and our captive women further then the whip
forced them, would not accustom themselves to the apparel we gave them. The
women make two kinds of meal of certain roots, which they use in stead of
bread, which they do not put, but hurl, into their mouths without loss.
Their office is also to make their drink of roots sliced, and chewed in their
mouths, and thus prepared, boiled, and stirred in a great pot over the fire:
the like drink they make of chewed Mayes, which they call Anati: the men would
account it a disgrace to do these things, and that they would not taste so
well. They call this drink Caouin, it is thick, and tastes like milk: I have
seen them continue (says Lerius) drinking this liquor three days and nights
together: they hold it a disparagement not to be able to hold out at this
Bacchanal exercise, which they celebrate with dancing and singing, especially
at their beastly man-feasts. The women dance apart from the men. One of them
reported to our Author, that they had taken a ship of the Peros, or Portugals,
and eaten the men: they found therein great vessels, which they could not tell
what it was, but drank so much thereof, that they slept three days after: it
is likely that it was Spanish wine. They eat Serpents and Toads (which with
them are not venomous) and Lizards: Our Author saw one Lizard as big as a man,
with scales on her back like Oisters. They have a kind of Monkey called
Sagouin, of the bigness of a Squirrell, the fore-halfe in shape resembling a
Lion: they have another strange beast, called Coaty, as high as a Hare, with a
little head, sharp ears, and a snout or beak above a foot long, the mouth so
little, that one can scarsely put in his little finger; it feeds on Ants.
They take The Brasilian Petum, is neither in form nor virtue, the same with
Tobacco, as Lerius says. The women take it not.
Petum (it is not Tobacco) not in pipes, but put four or five leaves in
another greater, and firing it, suck in the smoke, and therewith, in time of
war, will sustain themselves three days together, without other sustenance.
They wear this herb about their necks.

CHAP. V.
Of the Wars, Man-eating, and other Rites of the Brasilians.

THe Brasilians exercise irreconciliable hostility, not to enlarge their
dominions, but only to be revenged for the death of their friends and
ancestors, slain by their enemies. The Elder men, as they sit or lie in their
hanging beds, will make an Oration of the virtue of their Predecessors, and of
their sustained wrongs, and so excite the younger to take arms: these Orations
last sometimes six hours. Their arms are clubs or wooden swords, five or six
foot long, and a foot broad, a finger thick, and very sharp. One of these men
being thoroughly moved, would trouble two of our Fencers. Their bows are as
long as ours, the string made of the herb Tocon, little, yet able to endure
the strength of a horse: their arrows an ell long, which they will shoot twice
as fast, as our men: they have leather shields: Their elder men lead the ranks
(if they may be so called, which have none to marshall or order them) and with
great shouts, and showing the enemies the bones of their slaine-friends, they
enter into a fierce battle. Their captives they convey in the midst of their
army home to their territories, and thereunto the men will not stick to give
their sisters or daughters, to perform all the duties of a wife, and feed them
with the best, till they redemand the same out of their flesh: the men are
employed (if it be long before the slaughter) in hunting, fowling, fishing; the
women in gardening, or gathering, Oisters. When that dismal day approaches,
knowledge is given, and the men, women, and children assemble to the place
appointed, and there pass the morning in drinking; and the Captive (although
he knows the dreadful issue) danceth, drinks, and frolickes it with the
best. After six or seven hours thus spent, two or three of the strongest
fasten a rope about his middle, leaving his arms at liberty, and so lead him
up and down the Village in triumph. Neither does he for all this hang down
his head, as men fiere going to be hanged, but with incredible courage
emblazoneth his own worthiness. Thus, thus, says he, have I sometimes bound
your kindred, and thy father, says he to one, have I devoured, and thy
brethren (to another) have I bouc^ned and eaten: and what innumerable numbers
of you Touou Pinambausy have these hands taken, this throat swallowed? Neither
will the Margaiates suffer this my death unrevenged. Then they bring him
stones, and bid him revenge his death. He hurleth them at those which stand
about him, whereof there are some four thousand, and hurts diverse: I saw one
(says our Author) whose leg I had thought had been broken by the violence
of one of those blows. After this comes one, which all this while had been
hidden, with the This Clubbe they call ^wara Pern^m, which is consecrated to
this mischief by certain ceremonies of singing and painting.
fatal clubbe, and, Art not thou one of the Margaiates? says he: and have
thou not devoured our kindred? the other answers, O how lustily I have done
it, how prompt have I been in taking them, how greedy in eating? And
therefore, replieth the other, shall thou be killed and roasted on the Boucan.
What then? says he, my death shall not be This confidence is as well in the
women as in the men.
unrevenged. The club ends their dialogue, with one blow striking him dead. His
wife (if he had any, as they sometimes use to bestow on their capitues) comes
to the carcass, and spends a little time and passion in mourning, but her
Crocodiles tears are soon dried, and the humor falls into her teeth, which
water for the first morsel. The other women, especially the elder (which are
most cruel and greedy) bring hot water and wash the body, and rub it till it
look like the skin of a Pig: then comes the Master of the feast, which owed
the captive, and cuts it out as readily, as any Butcher with us can do a
Wether. They daub the children ^o.Stad.lib.2.cap.^9.
with the blood: four women carry about the arms and legs for a show, with
shouts and cries: The trunk is divided into two parts, the upper part being cut
and separated from the lower: the inwards are left to the women, which sees
and make broth of them called Mingau, which they sup up, with their children:
they eat also the flesh about the head. The brain, tongue, and that which
within the head may serve for meat, is the childrens share. The author of the
feast has a new name added to the former (for they have so many names as they
have slain captives, the chief of the Cottage branding him on the arm, with
an honorable mark for the memory thereof) and all that day he must spend in
quiet. The Wayganna Stad.l.2.c.3.
are a kind of Brasilians, which hold confederacy with no other nation, but
kill all which come to their hands, and that so cruelly, that they will cut off
their arms and legs while they are alive. These live in the mountains. They
cut them with stones, and those which have trade with the Christians, use
knives. Their Boucan is a grediron of four cratches, set in the ground, a yard
high, and as much asunder, with billets laid thereon, and other sticks on them
gratewise. On this they roast the flesh, putting fire under, all the people
standing about the same, and every one gets a little piece of him. But me
thinks I see horror expressed in the countenance of him that reads this, and
every one weary of viewing this tragedy, loathing this inhumane feasting with
humane flesh: I will therefore leave their shambles, and (which better beseemes
a Pilgrim) will visit their holies and holy places. But alas, where or what
are they? Maffaeus has already told us, that they observe no Gods; and Lerius
confirms the same, yet shows that they acknowledge a Devil, whom they call
Aygnan: not that they worship him, but are tormented by him. Even in speaking
of him, Ler.cap.16.
they tremble, and the remembrance breeds a compassion at amazement in the
hearer, an amazed passion in the speaker, while he applauds our happiness,
free from such tyranny, deplores his own misery: he sometimes in the form of
a beast, sometimes in form of a bird, and other-whiles deformed in some
monstrous shape, does grievously torment them. Even whiles the Christians were
in conference with them, they would pitiously cry out, Hei, Hei, help, Aygnan
vexes me. Nor could this be counterfeit in the judgment of any that conuersed
with them. They believe the immortality of the soul, and that the souls of
the virtuous, that is, (in their fense) of such as have killed and eaten many
enemies, shall fly beyond the highest mountains, and be gathered to the souls
of their progenitors, and there live in pleasant gardens, and perpetual
dancings and delicacies. The cowardly ghosts shall be carried unto torment, by
Aygnan, without end. They have no name, whereby to signify GOD unto them, but
wondered to hear what the Frenchmen told of the Creator of Heaven and Earth.
And because they are afraid of thunder, which they call Toupan, they told them
that GOD was author thereof: the foolish Indians reply, that he was then naught
which would make them afraid. But the fear of Aygnan made them sometimes
flexible to embrace the Christian Religion, hearing that this Devil was
inferior to the Christians GOD. So that even in these, the most degenerate of
all, which I have observed in this long and tedious Pilgrimage, there is some
spark left of Religion, even in the acknowledgement of a Devil, and of
eternal rewards and punishments.

This is further confirmed by that which is written of certain Magicians or
Priests amongst them: which persuade the people, that they have dealings with
spirits, that by their means they have their roots and sustenance, and may by
them have fortitude. I (says Lerius) was present at one of their Assemblies,
where six hundred were gathered together, which divided themselves into three
parts; the Men went into one house, the Women into a second, the Children into
a third. The Caraibes forbad the women and children to depart their houses, but
to attend diligently to singing: and we (says he) were commanded to abide
with the women. Anon the men in one house fell to singing, He, He, He, answered
by the women in the other with the same. They howled it out for a quarter of an
hour, shaking their breasts, and foming at the mouth, and (as if they had had
the falling sickness) some falling down in a swoune, the Devil (in seeming)
entering into them. The children also followed in the same harsh devotions.
After this, the men sung pleasantly, which caused me to go thither, where I
found them singing and dancing in three several Rings, in the midst of each
three or four Caraibes, adorned with Hats and garments of feathers, every one
having a Maraca, or Rattle, in both his hands. These Rattles are made of a
fruit bigger then an Ostriches egg, out of which they said, that the Spirit
would speak, and they continually shook them, for the due consecration. These
Caraibes daunced to and fro, and blowed the smoke of Petum on the standers by,
saying, Receive ye all the Spirit of Fortitude, whereby ye may overcome your
enemies. This they did often: the solemnity continued two hours, the men
ignorant of Music, and yet rauishing my spirit with the delight I conceived
in their Song. Their words sounded this, that they were grieved for the loss
of their progenitors, but were comforted in the hope, that they should one day
visit them beyond the Hills; and then threatened the Ovetacates ( Ler.c.5.
which dwell not far from them, and at enmity with all their neighbors, as
swift as Hearts, wearing their hair to the buttockes, eating raw flesh, and
differing from all others in Rites and Language) and now prophesied their
destruction at hand. Some what also they added in their Song of the Flood, that
once had drowned all the world, but their ancestors, which escaped by climbing
high trees. That day they feasted with great cheer.

This Solemnity is celebrated every third year; and then the Caraibes appoint
in every Family three or four Maraca, to be adorned with the best feathers,
and sticked in the ground, with meat and drink set before them; and the people
believe they eat it. They minister unto their. Maraca fifteen days; after
which, in a superstitious conceit, they think, that a Spirit speaks to them
while they rattle their Maraca. They were exceedingly offended, if any took
away any of this Provision, as the French sometimes did; for which, and denying
other the Caraibes lies, those Priests hated them exceedingly. Yet do they not
adore their Maraca, or any thing else.

Stadius Stad.l.2.c.23.
tells (as you heard) that they ascribed his taking to the prediction of their
Maraca. He tells of their consecration, that the Le^tu^ says, That the
Ca^^ibes and the Paygi are two kinds: Thevet but one: and Stadius mentions no
more but the Paygi.
Paygi (so he calls them) enjoin that every one should carry their Tamaraka
to the house, where they should receive the faculty of speech. Every ones
rattle is pitched in the ground by the stele or stalk, and all of them offer
to the Wizard which has the chief place, arrows, feathers, and eare-rings;
he then breaths Petnn on every rattle, puts it to his mouth, shakes it, and
says, Nee Kora, that is, Speak if thou be within: anon follows a squeaking
voice which I, says Stadius thought the Wizard did, but the people ascribed it
to the Tamaraka. Then those Wizards persuade them to make wars, saying, that
those spirits long to feed on the flesh of Captives. This done, every one
takes his Rattle and builds up a room for it to keep it in, where he sets
victuals, requires and asks all necessaries thereof, as we do of God: and
these, as Stadius affirms, are their Gods. These Paygi do initiate women
unto witchcraft by such ceremonies of smoke, dancing, andC. till she fall as
in the falling sickness, and then he says, he will revive her, and make her
able to foretell things to come: and therefore when they go to the war they
will consult with these women, which pretend conference with spirits.

Andrew Thenet A. Thevet Antarct.
(which was in France with Villagagnon) agrees in many of the former reports:
he adds, that for fear of Aignan they will not go out, but they will carry
fire with them, which they think is forceable against him: that the Paygi
exercise poysonings, coniuration, and other things, which I know not with what
authority he auerreth against the former witnesses, whereas Thevet, sometimes
taken in lying, deserves less credit in the rest. When there is any tempest
in the water, he says they attribute it to the souls of their progenitors,
and cast something into the water, to appease it.

They have a tradition, That one, in habit like to the Christians, had long
since told their progenitors of divine matters, but to so little effect, as he
forsook them; and ever since had those bloody Wars continued amongst them.
How little the Jesuits can prevail, in bringing the Brasilians to
Christianity, Maffaus Maff. l.15. Piecre du Iarric l.3.a.c.22. ad finem.
has written somewhat, and Pierre du Iarric, a Jesuit, very largely; which is
not so pertinent to our present purpose.

In Marriages Ler. c.17.
they abstain only from mother, sister, and daughter: they observe no
Marriage-Ceremonies, but upon consent of her friends and her own, take her
home. It is a credit to have many wives, amongst whom is no Leah to envy
Rachels greater portion of love: the husband may kill the Adulteress; but for
their unmarried maidens they are not serupulous. Our Author, hearing a woman
cry in the night, thought she had been in some danger of devouring by a wild
Beast, but found her husband playing the homely Midwife to her in her travel,
biting off the nauell-string, and pressing down the nose. The father washes
and painteth him. They use to put to their male infants little Bows and
Arrows into the bed, and chat out their hope of the child's valor, in being
avenged when he shall be a man, upon his enemies. They name their children at
adventure, by the name of a Beast, Bird, or otherwise, as this child was called
Orapacon, that is, Bow and Arrows. The men are modest, in accompanying with
their wives secretly. The women have not the ordinary feminine sickness.
Lerius thinks, that humor was diuerted in their youth, seeing the mothers cut
their daughters side down to the thigh, at twelve years of age. But twice
while he was there, did he see any in private brawling, or contention: if such
happens, as they began, so they are suffered to end it: if any hurt, or kill
other, he sustaineth the like in his own person, inflicted by the kindred of
the party wronged. They have their proper pieces of ground, which they husband
with their Roots and Mais. When they entertain a stranger, the Moussacat, or
good man, seems to neglect him a while, and the guest sits him down silent on
the bed, the women sit by on the ground, and hold their hands before their
eyes, weeping, with many praises, that he is a good man, a valiant man, that
(if he be a Christian) he has brought them fine wares. The stranger must
endeavor, in some measure, to imitate the like weeping gesture. The Moussacat
is all this while whittling his arrow, not seeming to see his new guest, till
anon he comes: And are you come, says he? How do you? with many terms of his
best Rhetoric: and then asks, if he be hungry; and if he be, sets his
cheer before him on the ground: which kindness is repayed with Glasses,
Combs, or the like. They are very kind both to their own, and to such
strangers as they are enleagued with. They would carry burden, or man, for
the space of some miles, when they needed: their love and hatred are in like
extremes; the one to their own, the other to their enemies. They have
Physicians, called Pages. They use much mourning at the death of any, and
making a round pit, bury him upright therein, six hours after his death, with
that wealth they had. In their Villages live some six hundred persons: they
remove their Villages often, which yet carry the same name. Stadius
Sted.l.2.c.5.
says, there are few Villages of above seven houses, but those houses are a
hundred and fifty foot long, and two fathomes high, without division into
plurality of Rooms; and therein live many Families, all of one kindred.

What our Countrymen have done on this Coast, I refer the Reader to M.
Hakluyts Discoueries.

CHAP. VI.
Of the River of Plate, and the Countries adjoining: and of the Magellanc
Strat. s.

THis River we have already mentioned; the Indians Botero.
call it Parana: and John Dias di Solis discovering the same in the year 1512,
for some show it seemed to have of that Metal, called it the River of Plata,
or Silver. It is forty leagues wide in the entrance, and prevails so far
against the Oceans saltness, that the taste of the fresh water sooner discernes
his waters, then the eye can see his banks. It ouerfloweth the Country; as
Nilus in Egypt, and Orenoque, Marannon, with the other great Rivers in America.
It ebbeth and flows a hundred miles up the stream. Sebastian Cabot may
rather be called the first discouerer.
Dias, whom some call the first Discouerer, was, with fifty of his
companions, there slain and eaten. But he which has most fully discovered the
Nations that dwell near this River, is Huldericus Admiranda Nauig. H.S.
Schmidel, who sailed thither in the year 15^4, and continued in those parts
almost twenty years. He sailed thither with Peter Mendoza, who carried with
him five and twenty hundred men, to discover, conquer, and inhabit those
Regions.

They built the City Buenas aeres, so called of the wholesome air, near to an
Indian town, named Carendies, of three thousand inhabitants; if that may be
called a town, whose inhabitants stay not long in one place. They will drink
the blood of the beasts they kill, for thirst. The Spaniards destroyed them,
whose parts Famine seemed to take against that cruel people, which with
invisible darts so pierced their entrails, that vile and venomous creatures
were applied to the cuting of their wounded stomachs: and when such medicines
failed, three of them stole a Horse These horses so multiplied in these parts,
that now they are dispersea in wild troops, and they will hunt and kill them
for the Hides, and (which is a great commodity in Angola) for the tails.
, minding to flee from Famine on that dead Beast, but were therefore horsed on
a Gibbet; where three others, that by his example were terrified from
Horseflesh, adventured upon these carcasses, cutting thence large gobbets, to
pay that cruellest tyrant, and greediest exactor, Hunger, his tribute. Another,
whose brother died, buried him in his own body: half their company were
consumed with this plague.

The Indians of Carendies, Bartennis, Zeechu^vas, and Tiembus, taking this
advantage, assailed their Town of Good Aires, turning it into good fires, by
shooting a^rowes, fired at the end, thereinto. They after passed up the River,
and came to Tiembus, where the men are tall and great, their women always
deformed, with scratched and bloody faces. The Tiembus could make five
thousand men. Of the Spaniards were not left five hundred in a small time; and
Mendoza dies, returning homewards. The Curenda, the next people, are like the
Tiembus. The Macverendas live only on Fish, and a little Flesh. There they
killed a Serpent five and twenty foot long, and as big as a man. The
Salvaisco go starke-naked, and live only on Fish, Flesh, and Honey. The
Curemagbas are of huge stature: the men bore a hole in their nose, in which
they wear a Parrots feather. The women paint their faces with indeleble lines.
The Carios Country is large, near to the Brasilians in Rites and Site. They
go naked: they will sell; the father, his daughter; the husband, his wife; the
brother, his sister: The price of a woman is a Hatchet, Knife, or such like.
They sat such as they take in their Wars, and then devour them with great
solemnity. The Lampere made near unto their Town Pits, with sharp stakes
set up in them, covered with sticks and earth: these they made for the
Spaniards, but in a confused flight fell therein themselves. Here the Spaniards
built the Town of Assumption. The King of the Scherves, attended with twelve
thousand men, met the Spaniards, and gave them friendly entertainment, with
Dancing, Music, and Feasting. The women go naked, and paint themselves as
artificially as any of our Painters could do: they wear Carpets of Cotton,
with the figures of Indian Beasts.

The King asked the Spaniards, What they sought? who answered, Silver and Gold:
He then gave them a silver Crown, which he said he had taken in the wars
which he had waged with the Amazones, that dwelt two months journey thence. Of
these Amazones the Indians told the same things that Orellana told of, near
that river, which has received name of this supposition.

The Spaniards, with some of the Scherves for their Guides, set forth for this
Amazonian Discovery, but were encountered by the way with hot waters, in which
they waded up to the waste, and so continued diverse days, till they came to a
Nation called Orthuesen, who were then infected with a Pestilence, caused by
Famine; which Famine the Grasshoppers had effected, two years together eating
up all the fruits which Nature or Husbandry had provided for their sustenance.

Thus the Amazones, the Martial and Venerean Wars of the Spaniards, wanted
food to hold out further: if there were any such people, and that they were
not, as before I said, the warre-like wives, or happily some gallant Viragoes,
that by themselves would let the world see what women could do: but yet I
cannot subscribe to the rest of their Story.

But I am weary of leading you any further in this discovery of this great
River and the near inhabitants, seeing little is observed in our Author of
their Religions. Some of these barbarous Nations, he says, hanged up the
hairie skin of their slain enemies in their Temples, or Houses of devotion:
This people is called Icperi. To give you a Catalogue of the names of the
Indian Nations that inhabited these parts, would be but tedious: These
iourneyes of the Spaniards were to see what gold, and not what Gods, the
Indians had. They passed up through the land into Peru.

Between Peru Bot^ro.
and these more Easterly parts, are the Hills Aud^, or Andes, which lift up
their Snowie tops unto the Clouds, and reach unto the Magellane Straits. In
them inhabit many fierce Nations, bordering upon the Nations of Brasil and
Plata. The Ciraguans, the Viracans, the Tovi, the Varai. These last exercise
their children unto Arms betimes, unto them they commit their Captives, for
trial of their bloody forwardness; and he which at one blow can kill a
Captive, is of the greatest hopes, and rewarded for his encouragement. To this
end they name their children Tygre, Lion, that their names might teach them the
like beastly fury. At the new and full Moon they wound themselves with sharp
bones, to inure themselves to things of War. They weep in the
entertainment of a friend, as the Brasilians doc. In seventeen degrees stands
the Spanish City of Holy Cross of the Mountain. The River Vapai in those
Valleys rises and falls, as Nilus does. There is a Brook at Holy Cross of
a wonderful nature: it is but little above two yards broad, and shallow
withal, not running above a league, but is drunk up of the thirsty sands.
yet does this brook provide the City water, and three sorts of good Fish, and
that in great plenty, from the end of February to the end of May. At other
times there are few. They use diverse means of shauing their heads, which, they
say, they learned of one Paicume. In the woman's lying in, the man keeps his
bed, as is said of the Brasilians.

More toward the East dwell the Itatini people, which call themselves Garay,
that is, Warriors; and others, Tapuis or Slaves. The language of the Varai is
common to all these Nations with the Brasilians, that as in the other world
Latin, Sclaon, and Arabian, so in that New World the Varay, Cuscan, and Mexican
language, will generally serve a man's turn.

The Kingdom of Tucuma stretches two hundred leagues between Chili, Brasil,
Holy Cross, and Paraguay. The Spaniards have therein five Colonies. It is a
plain Country. The Paraguay inhabit along the River, so called, whereof they
take name. From Plata Southwards is the great Region of Chica, washed on the
South, East, and West by the Sea. The Inhabitants are called Patagones.

The Spaniards Pigafetta ap. ^am.
which with Magellane first discovered the Straits, saw Giants on this coast,
of which he carried away one with him to Sea, where after for want of
sufficient food he dyed.

Edward Ed. Cliffe, ap. Hak.
Cliffe, that wrote Master Winters Voyage, who first, of all others, returned
out of the Straits by the same way homewards, because he saw on this Coast men
of common stature, he excepteth against that report of Giants, as a Giant-like
report, exceeding the stature and measure of Truth. But besides that some of
our own M. T. Candishes Voyage ap. Hak. to.3. written by Fr.Pretty.
at another time measured the print of men's feet eighteen inches in the
Sands, Oliver Nauig.Ol^^. and Seb. W. in Additam.9. part. Americae.
Noort in his World-Compassing Voyage, had three of his men slain by men of
admirable stature, with long hair, not far from Port Desire, about seven and
forty degrees of Southerly latitude, and after, in the Magellane Straits
discomfited a band of Savages, which neither would yield, nor flee from their
wives and children, which were in a Cave just by, till every man was flaine.
Four boys the Hollanders carried away: one of which, learning their Language,
told them of three Families, or Tribes, in those parts of ordinary stature,
and of a fourth which were Giants, ten or eleven foot high, which warred upon
the former.

Sebalt de Weert being detained five months in the Straits by foul weather,
sent his men to fish for their provision (which exceedingly failed them) who
there were suddenly assailed by seven Canoas of Giants, which they guessed to
be so high as is mentioned: who being put to flight by their Pieces, fled to
land, and plucked up Trees, in their rude manner barricadoing and fortifying
themselves against the further pursuit of the Hollanders, who were no less
glad that they were rid of such company.

These men, both Giants and others, went either wholly naked, or so clothed, as
they seemed not to dread the cold, which is yet there so violent, that besides
the Mountaine-toppes, always covered with Snow, their very Summers, in the
midst thereof, freeth them not from Ice. Yea, at that time of the year those
Hollanders encountered an Island of Ice in the Sea, which the cold Air had
there mounted and maintained in despite of Neptunes rage, or the Suns volley
of shot, in his nearest approach. The Trees in these parts, and the men (it
seems) are naturally fortified against those Colds; the one (as is said)
always in manner naked, the other always clothed, out-brauing the Winters
violence in their Summer-like Green Liuerie, seeming to stoop under the
burden of continual Frosts and Snowes, and in a natural wisdom cloth
themselves, and hold their leaves the suren^^.

Those Giantly men Th. Candish.
about Port Desire, when they die, are brought to the Cliffes, and there
buried, with their Bows, Arrows, Darts, and all their (almost no) substance.
The Savages about the Straits feed (as both the same Author and the Hollanders
report) on raw Flesh, and other filthy food, and are Man-eaters.

It is no small credit to our Nation and Navigations, that these Straits have
more enlarged themselves, and given oftener and freer passage to us then to any
other. Drake See Hak.to.3.

(as Drake had done) about the World in his Circuit. The Delight of Bristol
entered them, and with small delight spent six weeks in them: and Captain
Danies, companion of Master Candish in his last Voyage, three times entered the
South Sea, which three times forced him back into the Embracing Arms of the
untrusty Straits. Some others have attempted, but not attained them, as Fenton
and Ward, and the Voyage set forth 1586 by the Earl of Cumberland. The Land on

although they be for their height wonderful, yet (as we have said of the
differing statures of the men) they have more Giantly ouer-lookers, with Snowie

The Voyage of Sir Francis so vexed the Spaniard Lopez Vaz.
, that he sent Pedro Sarmiento to inhabit there, that he might prohibit other
Nations to pass that way: but Tempest and Famine hating the Spanish insolence,
whose ambitious designs always aimed at a Plus vltra, brought them to a Plus
vltra indeed, further then ever they had designed, diverse of the Ships
(which at first were three and twenty, with three thousand five hundred men)
perishing in the devouring jaws of the Ocean, and others in their
selfe-deuouring Mawes of Hunger, which eat them up with not eating. The Name
of JESUS, and Philips City were their two newly erected Colonies, peopled with
four hundred men and thirty women, which by Famine were brought to three and
twenty persons, when Master Candish took Hernando, one of that company, in
his prosperous Voyage; another W.Magot^^ ap.Hak.
, who had maintained himself by his Piece, and lived in a house alone a long
time, was taken by the Delight of Bristol, two years after. The English gave a
name fitting to this distressed City, calling it Port Famine.

The last Voyage of Master Candish proved unfortunate, both in the loss of
himself, and many men: the black Pinnace was lost in the South Sea: the
Desire returned, but lost diverse of her men, surprised (as was John Jane.
thought) and devoured by the Savages, near to Port Desire. The Savages here
presented themselves, throwing dust in the Air, leaping etc. and either had
Vizards on their faces, like Dogs faces, or else their faces were Dogs
faces indeed.

CHAP. VII.
Of Terra Australis, and Chili.

AS for the Land on the Southern side of the Straits, it is Botero.
called the Land of Fire, either because the Discoueres saw fire thereabouts,
or because that cold Climate so much needs Fire. More Easterly, against the
Cape of Good Hope, is the Land Terra di Vista. This Land about the Straits is
not perfectly discovered, whether it be Continent, or Islands. The most take it
for Continent, and extend it (more in their imagination then any man's
experience, toward those Islands of Solomon and New Guinnee, esteeming (of
which there is great probability) that Terra Australis, or the Southern
Continent, may, for the largeness thereof, take up a fifth place in order, and
the first in greatness, in the Division and Parting of the whole World.

Lopez Vaz writes, That the Governors which the King of Spain sends for
Peru and New Spain, have a custom to discover New Countries. The Licentiate
Castro being Governor of Peru, sent forth a Fleet from Lima; which sailing
eight hundred Leagues Westward, found certain Islands in eleven degrees to the
South of the Equinoctial, with a kind of people of yellowish complexion, and
all naked. Here they found Hogs, Dogs, Hens, Cloves, Ginger, Cinnamon,
and some Gold. The first Island they named Izabella, the greatest Guadalcanal,
on the Coast whereof they sailed a hundred and fifty Leagues, where they took
a Town, and some grains of Gold hanged up in the houses. They burnt their
Town, because they had in a sudden surprise killed fourteen of their men.
They spent fourteen months in this Discovery, and named them the Islands of
Solomon, that by that name men might be further induced to discover and inhabit
them, imagining, that Solomon had his Gold from thence.

N^va Bot. part.1.vol.2.
Guinea was discovered by Villalobos, sent from New Spain in the year 1543,
going to discover the Moluccas. The inhabitants are black of hue, and witty.
The Spaniards have coasted it seven hundred Leagues, and yet cannot tell
whether it be an Isle or Continent.

Hesselius Gerardus has largely set forth the Petition or Memorial of P Fer.
de Quir, Detecti^ Australis Incogenit^.
Peter Ferdinandez de Quir, unto the King of Spain, about his Discovery of
those Southern unknown Lands, for the Plantation of the same: wherein he
declares unto his Majesty, that fourteen years space he had busied
himself to no small endamagement of his State and Person about the same. The
length thereof he equalleth unto all Europe, and as much of Asia, as thence
extends to the Caspian Sea: and for the wealth and riches he calls it a
Terrestrial Paradise.

The Inhabitants, he affirms, are innumerable, some white, some like the
Mulatos, and some otherwise, in color and habit of body diuersified. They
neither have King, nor Laws, nor Arts. They are divided and war one upon
another, with Bows, Arrows, and other weapons, all of wood. They have their
Oratories and Places of Burial. Their bread is made of three forts of roots.
They have variety of fruits, Cocos, Almonds of four sorts, Pome-citrons,
Apples, Dates: there are also Swine, Goats, Hens, Partriches, and other
Fowls; and as the Indians report, Kine, and Buffals. He saw amongst them
silver, and pearls, others added, gold: and the Coast-Countries seemed to
promise great wealth within Land: Many Rivers, Sugar Canes, Bays, Havens, and
other commodities of Lands and Seas, making show of an other China: the air
very wholesome and temperate.

He took possession thereof in the name of the King, and set up a Cross and a
Chapel, in the name of The Lady of Loretto. These Regions trend even as high
as the Aequinoctiall. When this Discovery was made he mentions not; only he
sueth to the King for employment therein. It is rightly called Terra Australis
Incognita, and therefore I will not take upon me to be your guide: in an other
sense one Mercurius Britannicus.
of our Countrymen has wittily and learnedly (according to his wont) described
this Country, and parallelled therewith the Countries of Europe, and has let
us see that we are acquainted in those coasts too much, and need no Pilot or
guide to conduct us.

But let us come back to our Streits of Magellane, that we may coast from
thence and visit the Countries of Chili and Peru: for of the Western borders
of Chica, girt in between the salt waves and cold Hills, little can be said
fitting our purpose.

Having sailed out of the Streits, we have a wide Sea before us, and on our
right hand the Country is so barren and cold, that I would not hold the Reader
in any cold or tedious Narration thereof. We will hasten rather nearer to the
Sun, where we first encounter with Chili. This name Botero.

sends Day with his light horse troop of Sunne-beames, to break up those

ornaments.

Arequipa Some reckon this Town to Peru.
one of her fairest Towns, by such disaster, in the year one thousand five
hundred fourscore and two, fell to the ground. And sometimes the neighbor
hills are infected with this pestilent Fever, and tumble down as dead in the
plain, thereby so amazing the fearful Rivers, that they run quite out of
their Channells to seek new, or else stand still with wonder; and the motive
heat failing, fall into an uncouth tympanie, their bellies swelling into
spacious and standing Lakes: the tides seeing this, hold back their course, and
dare not approach their sometime-beloued streams by diverse miles distance, so
that betwixt these two stools the ships come to ground indeed. The sick earth
thus having her mouth stopped, and her stomach ouer-laied, forces new mouths
whence she vomiteth streams of oppressing waters.

I speak not of the beasts and men which in these civil wars of Nature must
needs be subject to devouring misery. These are the strange effects of cold
and earthquakes, not strange in Chili, where we are now arrived. The people
are fierce and cruel, and some (as is reported) Giants. Almagro one of the
first Conquerours of Peru, in hope of gold, passed from thence hither: but was
deceived by the Indians which led him the wrong way. In passing the Deserts of
Chili, the Air is so piercing (as before is observed) Acost.l.3.c.9
that men fall down dead, or else loose their members suddenly, in manner
without feeling. Jerome Costilla the General, one of Acosta's acquaintance,
had lost three or four Toes which fell off without any pain: many of his
Army dyed, whose bodies at his return he found lying there without stink or
corruption, and one Boy remained alive which had maintained himself by eating
horse flesh.

The horses also were found whole as Apollonius L: Apollon.hist.Peru.l.3.
writes, and the men sitting on them, as if they had been alive, with the
Bridles in their hand. In six and thirty degrees is that famous Valley of
Arauco, which defend their persons and freedom, maugre all the force and fury
of the Spaniards Nuno da Silua.
. These killed two of Sir Francis Drakes men, and wounded himself: they
destroyed also three and twenty Hollanders, of the company of Cords: both
which they did in detestation of the Oliu.de Noort.
Spaniards, of whom they esteemed the English and Dutch, because of their
apparel. They have destroyed many of the Spaniards: they took the City
Baldiuia in the year 1599. and slew the Spaniards. Twice before, if not
oftener, they had burnt and spoiled it. Yea Baldiuia himself, the first
Conqueror of Chili, (for Almagro stayed not) and of whom that City received
name, was taken by these Indians, his horse being slain under him. They bid
him fear nothing, he should have gold enough: and making a great banquet for
him, brought in the last service, which was a cup full of molten gold, which
they forced him to drink, saying; Now glut thy self with gold. This Baldiuia
had entered Chili with four hundred horse, and easily conquered that part which
had been subject to the Kings of Peru: but the other which was the richer part
held out. The Spaniards sent them word they were the Sons of GOD, and came to
teach them the word of GOD: and if they would not yield to them, they would
shoot fire among them. The Indians would try this argument in the field, and
there the great Ordnance so well pleaded the cause, that they believed and
subjected themselves. The Spaniards employed them in the Mines, whence they
gathered such plenty of gold that others had twenty thousand, but Baldinia
himself had three hundred thousand Pezos by the year.

The Indians after, perceiving the Spaniards to be but mortal men, rebelled:
and whereas they had used to carry grass into the Folt for the Spaniards
horses, they conveyed, in the same, weapons, by which means, being assisted of
their fellows without, they won the Fort, and when Baldiuia would have
recovered it, he lost himself as you have heard.

Ever since, this hostility has continued, and the Araucans are the lifts and
bars to the Spanish conquests. Their Country (to consider Arauco by it
self) is but small, about twenty leagues in length: neither could the Ingas
or Kings of Peru conquer it: their manner of War is much like the Christians,
in pitched battles placing their Bow-men among their ranks of Pike-men. To
speak of other Towns which the Spaniards have built in this coast, is not our
purpose: when they sacked Baldiuia 1599. they feasted the Spaniards with the

cut of the Images heads, triumphing over the Spaniards Gods, as they termed
them. They were then at the siege of Imperial, an other Spanish City, having
before taken Baldiuia. They pluck out the hearts of the Spaniards which they
kill, and drink in their sculls.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, and of their Ingua's or Emperors.

FRANCIS PIZARRO Gomar.c.144
was the Bastard Son of Goncallo, a Captain in the Kingdom of Navarre: he
was borne at Trusiglio, and exposed at the Church door, and none being found
that would give him the breast, he was nourished by sucking a Sow for certain
days: at last his Father acknowledged him, and when he was grown, set him to
keep his Swine, which being one day strayed and lost, he durst not return
home for fear, and therefore went to Civil, and thence passed to the Indies.
In this swinish education he had not so much as learned to read. He went to
Vraua with Alonso de Horeda; with Valuoa, to the discovery of the South Sea;
and with Pedrarias de A^^la Governor of Golden Castile, to Panama. In this
City Gom.c.108. Benzo.l.3.c.1.
were diverse which affected golden discoueries. Pedrarias intended Nicaragna;
but Diego di Almagro, Hernando Luche, or Luques, a rich Priest, and this
Picarro now grown rich, agreed to join their purses and best industry to
search Southwards, where they had heard was store of wealth. They provided a
Navy and two hundred and twenty Soldiers, and Almagro with Picarro, in the
Anno 1525. or (as Benzo has it) 1526. set forward.

Almagro and he parting company, Picarro, offering to land his men, was
wounded and forced to retire to Panama: Almagro in an other place had better
success, the Indians using him kindly, and giving him three thousand Ducats of
gold. But seeking to land in that place of Picarro's misfortune, he was set
upon by the Indians, and lost in fight one of his eyes. They meet at panama,
and having cured their wounds, repair their forces, and with two hundred men
and many slaves, set sail, and land in an other place, but are repelled to
their ships by the Inhabitants, and go to Gorgon, a little Island, six miles
from the Continent, where Picarro stayed, while Almagro went back for better
supply. At his returene Picarro and his company were almost starued, but being
refreshed, and all of them now together attempting the Indian shore, were
repelled with loss to the I Will, which they called Galli. Almagro is again sent
back for new aid, the Soldiers would have passed with him, and curse this
Land and their covetousness. Picarro and his company agree to search further,
and having sailed five hundred miles, came to Chira, a Province of Peru, and
taking some of the Inhabitants to learn them the Spanish tongue, returned to
Tumbez.

Having learned of the Indians the great wealth of those parts, he set one
Peter, a Candian, on shore, who was kindly entertained of the Governor, who
showed him a Temple dedicated to the Sun, wherein were unspeakable riches,
which when he related to Picarro at his return, the Spaniards go back with
these news to Panama. His two fellows Almagro and the Priest (called after,
the fool, because he had spent his estate on this business, and was after
excluded by his companions) agreed with Picarro to go to Spain to get license
for this conquest, and borrowed one thousand and five hundred Ducats, to set
him forth. Pizarro seeks and obtaines this Faculty only for himself, never
mentioning his Partners, and with letters Pattents returns to Panama with his
four Brethren, Hernando, Gonzalo, John, and Martin di Alcantara, his Brother
by the Mothers side. His two Partners were not a little grieved when they heard
how things passed, but after much stir, Almagro and Picarro became friends
and agreed to communicate Purses and Titles. Picarro goes before with a hundred
and fifty Soldiers (taking order that Almagro should follow with all the
strength he could make) and lands in Peru, a River so called, which gave name
to those mighty and rich Provinces, because the Spaniards by this way
discovered them. They went by land, enduring much misery by the way to Coache
where they were well refreshed. But a disease worse then the French Pox there
warred upon them, called Pori. Yet did 'Picarro hold on his resolution; he
passed over to Puna, where the Governor entreated the Spaniards well, till the
abusing of their Wives caused the Indians to take arms, and so made their
riches become a prey to the prevailing Spaniards.

There had Picarro the first intelligence of Atabaliba. The Governor of this
Island, to satisfy his jealousy, cut off the noses, the members, and the
arms, of his Eunuchs or Keepers of his Women. Picarro sent to Tumbez six
hundred prisoners, which the Governor of this Island had taken of the party of
Atabaliba, who at that time maintained War against his Brother Guascar about
the Soueraignetie, and this Governor had taken Guascars part. This civil
discord was much to the Spaniards advantage.

Picarro Gom.c.112. Apol.l.2. Ben. l.3.c.3.
sent three Messengers to Tumbez to demand peace and safe entrance, but they
(notwithstanding the freedom of their Captives) delivered them to the Priests
to be sacrificed to their Idol of the Sun. He takes Tumbez and sacketh the
Temple and City.

From thence he proceeded in his way to Caxamalca: and Guascar sent some unto
him with great promises to demand his aid against his brother Atabaliba: soon
after Atabaliba sent one to him, to charge him to return to his ships. Picarro
answers, That he came not to hurt any, but for their good, as his Emperor
had given him in charge, nor could he now, (being the Ambassador of the Pope
and Emperor, Lords of the World) return without great dishonor before he
had seen his Royal person, and communicated to him such instructions as might
be good for his body and soul.

As he passed the Province of Chira, the Lords thereof provoked him against
Atabaliba, who had lately conquered their Countries. And on the River of Chira
he founded the Colonie of St. Michael, for the safe keeping of his spoils,
and for his ships. He marches on to Caximalca, and sends Messengers on
horseback, to give him notice of his coming. This strange beast made the
Indians afraid, but Atabaliba was nothing moved therewith, more moved to see
those bearded men give him so little reverence. Atabaliba sent Pizarro a pair
of shoes, cut and gilded, that (as he pretended) he might know him: others
thought, that he might be known and designed to imprisonment or slaughter.

The next day the King was carried, as in solemn triumph, upon men's shoulders,
guarded with five and twenty thousand Indians in rich pomp and magnificence.
Vincentius de Valle-viridi, a Dominican Friar, holding in one hand a Cross, in
the other his Breuiarie, or (as some say) a Bible, came before him with great
reverence, and blessing him with the Cross, said: Gom.c.11^.
Excellent Lord, it behooves you to know, That GOD in Trinity and Unity made
the World of nothing, and formed a man of the Earth, whom he called Adam, of
whom we all have beginning. Adam sinned against his Creator by disobedience,
and in him all his posterity, except JESUS CHRIST: who being GOD, came down
from Heaven, and took flesh of the Virgin MARIE; and to redeem Mankind,
died on a Cross like to this (for which cause we worship it;) rose again the
third day, and after forty days ascended into Heaven, leaving for his Vicar
in Earth Saint Peter, and his Successors, which we call Popes; who have This
he spoke according to the Bull of Alexander the sixth, which had given the
southern and Western world to the Spanish Kings. The horns of the Bull, and
not of the Lamb, are the Popish weapons.
given to the most puissant King of Spain, Emperor of the Romans, the
Monarchy of the World. Obey the Pope, and receive the Faith of CHRIST; and if
ye shall believe it most holy, and that most false which ye have, ye shall
do well; and know, that doing the contrary, we will make war on you, and
will take away and break your Idols; therefore leave the deceivable Religion
of your false Gods. This Preaching of the Friar might well seem strange to
Atabaliba, which it seems he learned of the Mahumetans, and not of the
Apostles. He answered, That he was free, and would not become tributarie to
any, nor did acknowledge any greater Lord then himself: and for the Emperor,
he could be pleased to be the friend of so great a Prince, and to know him:
but for the Pope, he would not obey him, which gave away that which was not his
own, and took a Kingdom from him whom he had never seen: as for Religion,
he liked well his own, and neither would nor ought to call it in question,
being so ancient and approved, especially seeing CHRIST dyed, which never
befell the Sun or Moon, and how (says he) do you know that the GOD of the
Christians created the World? Friar Vincent answered, That his Book told it
him, and gave him his Breuiarie. Atabaliba looked on it, and in it, and saying,
it said no such thing to him, hurled it on the ground. The Friar took it up
and went to Picarro, crying, he has cast the Gospels to the ground, Revenge
it, O Christians, seeing they will not our friendship, nor our Law.

Picarro commanded to bring forth the Standard and the Ordnance: the Horsemen
in three Bands assailed Atabaliba's people, and slew many: he himself arrived
with his footmen, which laid about with their swords: all charged upon
Atabaliba, slaying them which carried him, whose room was presently supplied
by others, till at last Picarro pulled him down from his litter by the
clothes. All this while not one Indian fought, because they had no
commandment, and therefore no Spaniard was slain, and many Indians perished
upon the thrust, for so the Friar had bidden them fight, for fear of breaking
their Swords: neither were any wounded, but only Picarro, by one of his own,
thrusting at Atabaliba in his taking, and wounding Picarro therewith in the
arm. Thus are the Indians chased, their King with other great spoils
remaining with the Spaniards.

The next day the Spaniards scoured about for spoil, and found five thousand
women of the Kings with much treasure. Atabaliba was much grieved with his
imprisonment, especially in regard of the chain which they put upon him.
Lop.Vaz.
And when they had spent much reasoning about his ransom, a Soldier named
Soto (of whom you have heard in our History of Florida) said unto him, will thou give us this house full of gold and silver thus high Gomara says that it
was a great room, and they made a red line about it: it was all of wrought
metal in vessels, etc.
? lifting up his sword and making a stroke upon the wall: Atabaliba answered,
That if they would give him liberty to send into his Kingdom, he would
fulfill their demand. Whereat the Spaniards much marueiling gave him three
months time, but he had filled the house in two months and a half, a matter
scarce credible, yet most true: For I (says Lopez Vaz) know above twenty men
that were there at that time, who all affirm that it was above Gom. has
252000. pou^ds of silver, and 1326000.pezo^ of gold.
ten Millions of gold and silver. Howbeit they killed him notwithstanding, and
in a night strangled him. But God the righteous Judge, seeing this villainous
act, suffered none of those Spaniards to die by the course of Nature, but
brought them to evil and shameful ends.

During the time of Atabaliba's Gom.c.1^5.
imprisonment, his Captains had taken his Brother Guascar, who spoke with
Captain Soto, and promised that if they would restore him to his liberty and
to his Kingdom, he would fill up the room at Caximalca to the roof, which
was thrice as much as Atabaliba had promised: and added, that his Father
Guaynacapa on his death bed had commanded him to be friend to the white and
bearded men, which should come and rule in those parts. Atabaliba hearing of
these things, fained himself sorrowful for the death of Guascar, whom he said
Quisquiz his Captain had slain: this he did to try how the Spaniards would
take his death, which when he saw they little respected, he sent and caused him
to be slain indeed. This was done in the year 1533.

The Indians hereupon hid the treasures of gold, silver, and gemmes, that were
in Cusco and other places, and had belonged to Guaynacapa, which were far
more then ever came to the Spaniards hands.

The quarrel between these two brethren grew about their inheritance: Guascar
succeeding his Father in the rest, and Quito being assigned to Atabaliba, who
seizing on Tumebamba, a rich Province, provoked his brothers forces against
him, who took him prisoner. But he escaping to Quito, made the people believe
that the Sun had turned him into a Serpent, and so he escaped through a hole
in the Prison: and on conceit of this miracle drew them into arms against
Guascar, with which he made such slaughter of his enemies, that to this day
there are great heaps of bones of the slain: he slew threescore thousand of
the Canari, destroyed Tumebamba, and conquered as far as Tumbez and
Caximalca: he sent a great Army with Quisquiez and Calicucima, two valiant
Captains, with such success as you have heard, against Guascar, whom they
took, and by his direction slew.

Gomara attributes the death of Atabaliba to Philippilius the Spanish
Interpreter, who to enjoy one of his wives, accused him of conspiracy against
the Spaniards, but Benzo Benzo.l.3.c.5.
with more likelihood affirms, that Picarro from his first taking had
intended it. For he might have sent him into Spain as Atabaliba requested, if
he had feared such secret practices: but his request and purgation were
rejected, and four Negro's which he used for that purpose, strangled him at
his command. He had many wives, whereof the chief was his Sister, named
Pagha. He seeing the glasses of Europe, maruailed much that they having so
fair a thing would go so far for gold. His Murderers dyed, as is said, the
like bloody ends; Almagro was executed by Picarro, and he slain by young
Almagro; and him, Vacca de Castra did likewise put to death. John Picarro was
slain of the Indians. Martin an other of the Brethren was slain with Francis.
Ferdinandus was imprisoned in Spain and his end unknown; Gonzales was done to
death by Gasca^ Soto dyed of thought in Florida; and civil wars eat up the
rest in Peru.

Before the times of the Ingua's, their Government Acost.l.6.c.19.20.21.22.
in these parts was (as still it is in Arauco, and the Provinces of Chili) by
Communalties, or the advice of many. The Government of the Ingua's continued
between three and four hundred years, although for a long time their
Signiorie was not above five or six leagues compass about the City of Cusco,
where the original of their Conquests began, and extended from Pasto to
Chili, almost a thousand leagues in length between the Andes and the South Sea.

The Canaries were their mortal enemies, and favored the Spaniards, and at
this day if they fall to comparisons, whether the Ingua's or Canari were the
more valiant, they will kill one another by thousands, as has happened in Cusco.
The practice which they used to make themselves Lords, was a fiction, that
since the general Deluge (whereof all the Indians have knowledge) the world
had been preserved, peopled and restored by them: and that seven of them came
out of the Cave of Pacaricambo, and that they also were the Authors of the true
Religion. The first of these Ingua's was Mangocapa, which came out of the Cave
of Tambo, six leagues from Cusco. Of him came two Families, the Hanancusco, of
whom came these Lords, and the Vrincusco. Ingaroca the first Lord was no great
Lord, but was served in Vessels of gold and silver. And dying, he appointed
that all his treasure should be employed for the service of his body, and for
the feeding of his Family. His Successor did the like: and this grew to a
general custom, that no Ingua might inherit his Fathers goods, but he built a
new Palace.

In the time of Ingaroca, the Indians had Images of gold. Yaguaraguaque
succeeded. Viracocha, the next successor was very rich. Gouzale Pizarro with
cruel torments forced the Indians to confess where his body was, for the
report of the treasures buried with him: the body he burnt, and the Indians
reserved and worshipped the ashes. They took it ill that this Ingua called
himself Viracocha, which is the name of their God, but he to satisfy them,
said, that Viracocha appeared to him in a dream, and commanded him to take his
name.

Pachacuti Ingua Yupangus succeeded him, who was a great Conqueror, Politician,
and Author of their ceremonies; he reigned threescore and ten years, and
fained himself sent of Viracocha to establish his Religion and Empire.

After him followed Gnaynacapa, the Father of Guascar and Atabaliba, which
brought this Empire to the greatest height. The Indians opened him after his
decease, leaving his heart and entrails in Quito, the body was carried to
Cusco, and placed in the Temple of the Sun. He was worshipped of his
Subjects for a God being vet alive, which was not done to any of his
Predecessors. When he dyed, they slew a thousand persons of his household, to
serve him in the other life, all which dyed willingly for his service, insomuch
that many offered themselves to death, besides such as were appointed. His
treasure was admirable. He used always Gom.c.120.
to have with him many Oregioni, which were his men of War, and ware shoes
and feathers, and other signs of Nobility: he was served of the eldest Sons
and Heirs of all his chief Subjects, every one clothed after his own
Country Rite; he had many Counselors and Courtiers in differing degrees of
honor. Every one at his entrance into the Palace put off his shoes, and might
not look him in the face when they spoke to him.

All the Vessels of his House, Table, and Kitchen, were of gold and silver,
and the meanest, of silver and copper for strength, and hardness of metal.
He had in his Wardrobe hollow Statues, which seemed Giants, and were of gold:
and the figures in proportion and bigness of all the Beasts, Birds, Trees, and
Herbs, in his Kingdom, and of the Fishes likewise. He had Ropes, Budgets,
Troughs, and Chests of Gold and Silver: heaps of Billets of gold, that seemed
Wood cut out for the fire. There was nothing in his Kingdom, but he had the
counterfeit in Gold. Yea they say, That the Ingua's had a Garden of pleasure in
an Island near Puna, which had all kind of Garden-Hearbes, Flowers, and Trees
of Gold and Silver. He had also an infinite quantity of Silver and Gold
wrought in Cusco, which was lost by the death of Guascar, which the Indians
held (as is said) from the Spaniards. He had two hundred children of diverse
women. Acosta Acost.l.6.c.22.23.
says, That he had (descended from his own loins) above three hundred
children and grandchildren.

When his sons Guascar and Atabaliba were dead, another of his sons, called
Mangocapa, continued the Wars a while with the Spaniards, and after retired
himself to Vilia Bamba, where he kept in the Mountains, and there the Ingua's
reigned, until Amaro was taken, and executed in Cusco. Some remnants of them
have since been christened. The other Family of the Ingua's, which descended
of the first Mangocapa, called Vrincusco, had their Successions also and
Government; which, here to discourse of, were to my proposed scope impertinent.
Leaving therefore the Conquerours and Conquest of Peru, let us consider the
Country it self, with such observations as we shall there find touching
their Religions.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Country of Peru, Natural, Occonomicall, and Political observations.

THE Kingdom of Peru extends P.de Citea.part.1.c.36.
seven hundred leagues in length, in breadth a hundred in some places, in some
threescore, in others forty: more, or less, according unto the difference of
places. Quito and Plata are the utmost Cities thereof, the one bordering on
Popayan, the other upon Chili. It is not here meant of that spacious Kingdom
of the Ingua's, for that reached twelve hundred leagues, whereof this of Peru
was but a part. Acosta Acost. libr.3. ca.20.
numbreth diverse strange specialties, excepted from the general Rules of
Natures wonted course.

The first, that it blows continually on all that coast with one only wind
(and, that also differing from that which usually blows between the
Tropikes) namely, the South and Southwest. The second, that this wind (in
other places unhealthful) is heer^ so agreeable, that otherwise it could not
be habitable. The third, that it never raines, thunders, snowes, nor hailes in
all this coast: And yet (which is a fourth wonder) a little distance from the
coast, it snowes and raines terribly. Fifthly, there are two ridges and
mountains, which both run in one altitude; and the one in view of the other,
almost equally, above a thousand leagues: and yet on the one part are great
forests, and it raines the greatest part of the year, being very hot; the
other is all naked, and bare, and very cold. So that Peru is divided into
three parts, which they call Llanos, Sierras, and Andes: the first ran
along the Seacoast; the Sierras be hills with some valleys, and the Andes
be steep and craggie mountains. The Llanos or Plains on the Seacoast have
ten leagues in breadth, in some parts less, and in some a little more. The
Sierra contains with equal inequality twenty leagues: and the Andes as
much, sometimes more, and sometimes less. They run in length from North to
South, and in breadth from East to West: and in this so small a distance it
raines almost continually in one place, and never in the other. In the Plains
never, on the Andes in a manner continually, though some times it be more
clear there then other. The Sierra in the mids are more moderate, in which
it raines from September to April, as in Spain, but in the other half year,
when the Sun is further off, it is more clear. The Sierras yield infinite
number of Vicagues, which are like wild Goats; and Pacos, a kind of
sheepe^asses, profitable for fleece and burden: the Andes yield Parrots,
Apes, and Monkies. Some Botero.
report that monstrous births do sometimes proceed (as by Natures unwilling
hand) from the copulation of these Barbarians and these Monkies. The Sierre
opening themselves, cause valleys, where are the best dwellings in Peru, and
most plentiful of Maiz and Fruits. It is strange Cieza.pa.1 ca.72.
that in the valley of Pachacama, neither the higher Element yields rain,
nor the lower any stream, and yet there is plenty of roots, Maiz, and fruits.
They have large and deep ditches, in which they sow or set, and that which
grows is nourished with the deaw: and because the Maiz will not grow, except
it first die, they set one or two Pilchards heads (which fish they take with
their Nets very plentifully in the Sea) therewith, and thus it grows
abundantly. The water which they drink, they draw out of deep pittes.
Acost.libr.3. ca.21.
Coming from the Mountains to the Valleys they do usually see (as it were)
two Heavens, one clear and bright, the other, obscure, and (as it were) a gray
veil spread underneath, which couers all the coast: and although it raines
not, yet this mist is wonderful profitable to bring forth grass, and to
raise up and nourish the seed; and where they have plenty of water, which
they draw from the Pooles and Lakes, yet if this moisture fails, there
follows great defect of grain. And (which is more worthy of admiration) the
dry and barren sands in some places, as in the sandy Mountain near the
City de Loy Reges, are by this deaw beautified with grass and flowers. Insome
places they water their fields out of the rivers.

Beyond the City of Cusco the two ridges of Mountains separate themselves,
and in the midst leave a plain and large champaine, which they call the
Province of Callao, where there are many Rivers, and great store of fertile
Pastures. There Acost.ibi.c.16. Cieza p.1.c.103.
is also the great Lake of Titicaca, which contains four score leagues in
compass, and robs ten or twelve great rivers of their waters, which they
were carrying to the Sea, but here are drunk up (by the way) of this Lake.
They sail in it with ships and barques: The Water is not altogether sour
nor salt, as that of the Sea, but is so thick, that it can not be drunk.
Upon the Banks of this Lake are Habitations as good as any in Peru. The great
Lake passes by a River into a less Lake called Aulagas, from whence it has
no manner of passage, except there be any under the earth. There are many other
Lakes in the Mountains, which seem to arise rather from Springs then from
Raines or Snowes, and some of them yield Rivers. At the end of the Vallie of
Tarapaya near to Potozi, there is a round Lake, whose water is very hot, and
yet the Country is very cold: they bathe themselves near the banks, for
further in, it is intolerable. In the midst is a boiling above twenty foot
square: it never increases nor decreaseth, although they have drawn from it a
great stream for mettall-mills.

But to return from this plenty of water in lakes to that want thereof in the
plains of Peru. The Natural reason which some yield of this want of Rain,
is, partly their sandy and dry quality, which of themselves can yield no
further exhalations, then to produce those mists or dewes: partly the height of
the Hills, which shadow the plains, and suffer no wind to blow from the Land
upon them, but intercept them wholly with their vapors and clouds; so that
their wind is only from the Sea, which finding no opposite, does not press
nor strain forth the vapors which rise to engender rain. This seems the
rather to be probable, for that it raines upon some small Hills along the
coast which are least shadowed. In the same coast also, where the Easterly or
Northerly winds be ordinary, it raineth as in Guayaquill. The South wind in
other places is Tell^s Nubibus assiduis plutiaque, mad^l cit ab A^.stro. Ovid.
accounted a causer of rain, which here reigns without rayning.

As strange is the difference of seasons, after the Indians account. For in the
Cieza, c.59.
Sterras their Summer begins in April, and ends with September: October
begins their Winter, which not the absence, but the presence of the Sun
does cause. Contrariwise in the Plains, just by in site, they have their
Summer from October to April, the rest their Winter.

The raines in the Hills are cause why they call it Winter, and the dewes or
mists in the Plains, so that when the raines fall most in the Hills, it is
clear weather in the Plains, and when the dew falls in the Plains, it is
clear on the Hills: and thus it comes to pass, that a man may travel from
Winter to Summer in one day, having Winter to wash him in the morning, and ere
night a clear and dry Summer to scorch him.

About the point of St. Helena in Peru, they Cieza.c.25.
tell that sometimes there lived Giants of huge stature, which came thither in
Boats, the compass of their knee was as much as of another man's middle: they
were hated of the people, because that using their women they killed them, and
did the same to the men for other causes The like does Apollodorus, and the
Poets tell of Trphon, and other Giants. Ap.de Dcor. Orig.l.1.and Hyginus, sab
152.
. These Giants were addicted to Sodomie, and therefore, as the Indians report,
were destroyed with fire from heaven. Whether this be true or no, in those
parts are found huge and Gyantlike bones. Contrariwise, in the Valley of
Chincha Cieza c.74.
they have a Tradition, that the Progenitors of the present Inhabitants
destroyed the native people, which were not above two cubits high, and
possessed their rooms: in testimony whereof they allege also that
bone-argument.

Concerning the Indians conceit of their own original: we have mentioned
their opinion of a flood, and the repeopling of the World by them, which came
out of a Cave Acost.l.1.c.25
. They have an other Legend that all men being drowned, there came out of the
great Lake Titicaca, one Viracocha, which stayed in Tiaguanaco, where at this
day is to be seen the ruins of very ancient and strange buildings, and from
thence came to Cusco, and so began mankind to multiply. They show in the
same Lake a small Island, where they feign that the Sun hid himself, and so
was preserved Cieza, page.1. cap.103.
: and for this reason they make great sacrifices unto him in this place, both
of sheep and men. They held this place sacred, and the Inguas built there a
Temple to the Sun, and placed there women and Priests with great treasures.

Some Acost.ibid.
learned men are of opinion, that all which the Indians make mention of is not
above four hundred years; which may be imputed to their want of writing. In
stead of writing they used their Quipos Ac.l.6.c.8.
. These Quippos are memorialls or registers made of cords, in which there are
diverse knots and colors, signifying diverse things: these were their books of
Histories, of laws, ceremonies, and accounts of there affairs. There were
officers appointed to keep them called Quipocamayos, which were bound to give
account of things as Notaries, and Registers. They had according to the
diversity of business, sundry cords and branches, in every of which were so
many knotts little and great, and strings tied to them, some red, some green,
and in such variety, that even as we derive an infinite number of words from
the letters of the Alphabet, so do they from these kinds and colors, And at
this day they will keep account exactly of them. I did see (says Acosta) a
handful of these strings, wherein an Indian woman did carry (as it were)
written a general confession of all her life, and thereby confessed her self,
as well as I could have done in written paper, with strings for the
circumstances of the sins. They have also certain wheels of small stones,
by means whereof they learn all they desire, by heart. Thus you shall see
them learn the Paternoster, Creed, and the rest: and for this purpose they
have many of these wheels in their Churchyardes. They have another kind of
Quippos, with grains of Mays, with which they will cast up hard accounts which
might trouble a good Arithmetician with his pen in the divisions. They were no
less witty, Id.lbid.c.16.
if not more, in things whereto they apply themselves then the men of these
parts. They taught their young Children all Arts necessary to the life of
men, every one learning what was needful for his person and family, and not
appropriating himself to one profession, as with us, one is a Tailer, an other
a Weauer, or of other trade. Every man was his own Weauer, Carpenter,
Husbandman, and the like. But in other Arts, more for ornament then
necessity, they had Gold-Smithes, Painters, Potters, and Weauers of curious
works for Noble men, and so of the rest. No man might change the fashion used
in his own country, when he went into another, that all might be known of
what country they were.

For their marriages, they had many wives but one was principal, which was
wedded with solemnity, and tha^n this sort. The Bridegroom went to the Brides
house and put Ottoya, which was an open shoe, on her foot: this, if she were
a Maid, was of Wool, otherwise, of Reeds: and this done, he led her thence
with him. If she committed Adultery, she was punished with death; when the
husband died she carried a mourning weed of black a year after, and might not
marry in that time which befell not the other Wives. The Ingua himself with
his own hand gave this woman to his Governors and Captains, and the
Governors assembled all the young men and Maids in one place of the City,
where they gave to every one his Wife, with the aforesaid ceremony in putting
on the Ottoya: the other wives did serve and honor this. None might marry with
his Mother, Daughter, Grandmother or Grandchild: and Yupangui, the Father of
Gnaynacapa was the first Ingua that married his Sister, and confirmed his fact
by a decree, that the Inguas might do it, commanding his own children to do
it, permitting the Noble men also to marry their Sisters by the Fathers side.
Other incest, and murder, Theft, and Adultery were punished with death. Such
as had done good service in war were rewarded with lands, arms, titles of
honor, and marriage in the Inguas lineage.

They had Chasquis or Posts in Peru, which were to carry tidings or Letters:
for which purpose they had houses a league and a half a funder, and running
each man to the next, they would run fifty leagues in a day and night.

When the Ingua was dead, his lawful heir borne of his chief wife succeeded.
And if the King had a legitimate brother, she first inherited, and then the
son of the first. He inherited not the goods (as is said already) but they
were wholly dedicated to his Oratorie or Guaca, and for the entertainment of
the Family he left: which, with his offspring, was always busied at the
sacrifices, ceremonies, and service of the deceased King: for being dead, they
presently held him for a God, making images and sacrifices to him. The Ensign
of royalty was a red roll of Wool finer then silk, which hung on his
forehead, which was as a diadem that none else might wear in the midst of
their forehead; at their ear the Noblemen might. When they took this roll,
they made their Coronation feast, and many sacrifices with a great quantity of
Vessel, of Gold, and Silver, and many Images in the form of Sheep of gold
and silver, and a thousand others of diverse colors. Then the chief Priest
took a young child in his hand of the age of six or eight years, pronouncing
these words with the other Ministers to the Image of Viracocha; Lord, we offer
this unto thee, that thou may maintain us in quiet, and help us in our
wars: maintain our Lord the Ingua in his Greatness and Estate, that he may
always increase, giving him much knowledge to govern us. There were present at
this ceremony, men of all parts of the Realm, and of all Guacas and
Sanctuaries. It is not found that any of the Inguas subjects ever committed
treason against him. He placed Governors in every Province, some greater, and
some smaller. The Inguas thought it a good Rule of state to keep their
Subjects always in action, and therefore there are seen to this ^^y long
Causeis of great labor, dividing this large Empire into four parts.

Having conquered a Province, they presently reduced them into Towns, and
Commonalties, which were divided into Bands: one was appointed over ten, an
other over a hundred, and an other over a thousand, and over ten thousand an
other. Above all there was in every Province a Governor of the house of the
Inguas, to whom the rest gave accounts of what had passed, who were either
Borne or Dead. At the feast called Raymer, the Governors brought the Tribute
of the whole Realm to the Court at Cusco. All the Kingdom Cicza, page.1.cap.92.
was divided into four parts, Chinchasuyo, Co^asuyo, Andesuyo, and Condesuyo,
according to the four ways which went from ^usco, East, West, North, and
South.

When Acost.i.6.c.15.
^^e Ingua conquered a City, the Land was divided into three Parts, the first
for Religion, every Idol and Guaca having his peculiar Lands appropriated to
their Priests and Sacrifices; and the greatest part thereof was spent in Cusco,
where was the General and Metropolitan Sanctuary, the rest in that City where
it was gathered, which a^ had Guacas, after the fashion of Cusco, some being
thence distant two hundred leagues. That which they reapt on the Land was put
into Storehouses built for that purpose.

The second part of that division was for the Ingua for the maintenance of his
Court, Kinsmen, Noblemen, and Soldiers: which they brought to Cusco, or other
places where it was needful.

The third part was for the Comminaltie for the nourishment of the people, no
particular man possessing any part hereof in proper. As the Family increased
or decreased, so did the portion. Their Tribute was to till and husband the
Lands of the Ingua, and the Guacas, and lay it up in storehouses, being for
that time of their labor nourished out of the same Lands. The like
distribution wa made of the Cattle to the same purposes, as that of the lands,
and of the wool, and other profits that thence arose. The old Men, Women, and
sick Folks, were reserved from this Tribute. They paid other Tributes also,
even whatsoever the Ingua would choose out of every Province. The Chicas sent
sweet woods; the Lucanas, Brancars to carry his litter; the Chumtilbicas,
Dancers: others were appointed to labor in the Mines: and all were slaves to
the Ingua. Some he employed in building of Temples, Fortresses, Houses, or
other works, as appears by the remnants of them, where are found stones of
such greatness that men cannot conceive how they were cut, brought, and laid
in their places, they having no iron or steel to cut, engines to carry, nor
mortar to lay them: and yet they were so cunningly laid that one could not see
the joints; some of eight and thirty foot long, says Acosta, eight broad,
and six thick, I measured, and in the walls of Cusco are bigger.

They built a Bridge at Chiquitto, the River being so deep, that it will not
admit Arches: they fastened bundles of reeds and weeds, which being light, will
not sink, which they fasten to either side of the River, they make it passable
for man and beast: it is three hundred foot long. Cusco Gom.c.124.
their chief City stands in seuenteen degrees: it is subject to cold and
snow, the houses are of great and square stone. It was besieged by Soto, and by
Pizarro and him entered, where they found more treasure then they had by the
imprisonment of Atabaliba: Quito Gom.c.125.126
is said to have been as rich as Cusco. Hither Ruminagui fled with five
thousand Soldiers, when Atabaliba his Mr. was taken by the Spaniards, and
slew Illeseas his brother, that withstood his tyrannical proceedings, flaied
him, and made a Drum of his skin; slew two thousand soldiers that brought the
body of Atabaliba to Quito to be interred, having in show of Funeral pomp and
honor, before, made them drunk; and with his forces scoured the Province of
Tamebamba: he killed many of his wives for smiling when he told them they
should have pleasure with the bearded men, and burnt the Wardrobe of Atabaliba:
that when the Spaniards came and entered Quito, which had almost dispeopled
Panama, Nicaragua, Cartag^na and other their habitations in hope of Peruvian
spoils, they found themselves disappointed of their expected prey, and in
anger set fire on the town. Aluarado with like news came from Guatimala into
those parts, with 400, Spaniards, but was forced to kill his horse to feed his
farnished company (although at that time horses were worth in Peru above
1000.ducats a piece) was almost killed with thrist, was assaulted Not far from
Lima, on the South Sea, Oliver Noort was bemisted two days on the Sea, with
such a shower of Ashes, which made them seem as they had been sprinkled with
Meal. The Spaniards say they are there common.
with showers of Ashes, which the hot Vulcane of Quito dispersed 240. miles
about, (with terrible Thunders, and lightnings, which Pluto had seemed to
steal from Jupiter, and here to vent them) and after with snowes on the cold
hills, which exacted 70. Spaniards for tribute in the passage, found many men
sacrificed by the inhabitants, but could find no gold, till Pizarro bought his
departure with 100000. ducats. He gave, thanks (he said) to God for his
deliverance, but that tract, by which he had passed, to the Devil. This was
he that afterward being bruised with the fall of his horse, (whereof he died)
and asked where he was most pained, Benzo l.2.c.17.
said, in his soul, as guilty to himself of his former cruelties and
covetousness. Let us add one thing more (added perhaps and more somewhat then
truth) of the riches of these parts. Francis Xeres F Xeres ap. Ortel. Theat.
writes that in Cusco there were houses, whose floores, walls, and roose were
covered with plates of gold. Giraua says, that the inhabitants of Anzerma,
were in their wars armed with co^plete harness of Gold: and that about Quito
there were mines, whence more gold was taken then earth. I tie no man's credit
to these reports, but sure it is, that they had these metals in abundance,
which the Spanish wars have made our Europaean world to feel, more managed
and maintained by Indian wedges, then Spanish blades.

But let us come from their Mines, to their Minds, which for heavenly things
were as full of dross, as the other were of purer metalls.

CHAP. X.
Of the Gods or Idols of Peru, and other their opinions.

THe Peruuians acknowledged a supreme Lord and Author of all things,
Acost.l.5.c.3.
which they called Viracocha, and gave him names of great excellence, as,
Pachacamac, or Pachayachachic, which is, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and
Vsapu, that is, admirable, and other the like. Him they did worship as the
chiefest of all, and honored him in beholding the heavens. Yet had No name in
the Cuscan or Mexican tongues to signify God.
they no proper name for God no more then the Mexicans, but such as in this
sort might signify him by his attributes or works, and therefore are forced to
use the Spanish name Dios. In the name of Pachacamac, or Creator, they had a
rich Temple erected to him, wherein they worshipped notwithstanding the Devil
and certain figures. The name of Viracocha was of the greatest sound in their
devotions, and so they called the Spaniards, esteeming them the sons of
heaven. Benzo Benzo l.3.c.21
alleges another cause of that name given to the Spaniards. It signifies
(says he) the froth of the Sea, (Vira is forth, Cochie the Sea) because they
thought them ingendered of Sea-froth and nourished therewith, in regard of
covetousness and cruelty devouring all things: applying that name to them in
respect of their wicked practices, and not for Divine Original. Yea, they
curse the Sea, which seen such a cursed brood into the land. (The Spaniards
came thither by Sea, as you have heard.) If I, says Benzo, asked any of them
for any Christian by that Title, they would neither look on me nor answer,
but if I enquired for them by the name of Viracochie, they would presently make
answer. And there (would the father point to the Child) goes a Viracochie.

To reconcile these two wholly, is impossible; not so, to show some reason why
the same name might be given both to their Idol, and the Spaniards. These
might be so termed, as coming thither at first by Sea: and happily because at
the first they thought somewhat more then humane to be in them, and that which
at first they gave for hosnour may now be continued in an Ironie, or
Antiphrasis, whiles they thought them better then men, and found them little
inferior to Devils.

Viracocha their great Author of Nature, may be called by this Sea-name, See
cap.12.
for some especial, Sea-rites observed in his honor, or for the same cause
that the Mythologians ascribe to Venus her Sea-generation. For they pictured
Venus swimming on the Sea (as Albricus de Imag.dcorum.
Albricus affirms) and the Poet sings, Venus, Orta Mari: which the
Mythologians apply to the motion and moisture required to generation, and to
that frothie nature of the Sperme. So says Ph^rnutus: Ph^rnuti de Not. dier.
Speculum.
Venus a Mari nata perhibetur quod ad omnium generationis cansa^ motu and
humiditate ^pus sit; Et forte quod spu^^sa fi^t animantium semina: therefore
(says Fulgentii Mytholog.l.2.
Fulgentius) she is called Aphrodite: for ^^^^ is froth, and so is Just in
regard of the vanity: and so is seed, in regard of natural quality. Perhaps
also the first Master of Virarochas Mysteries, which taught them first in
Peru, came thither by Sea.

But to return to Acosta, Ac.l.6.c.21.
he tells that the Ingua Yupangui (to make himself more respected) devised,
that being one day alone. Viracocha the Creator spoke to him, complaining, that
though he were universal Lord and Creator of all things, and had made the
Heaven, the Sun, the World, and Men, and ruled all, yet they did not yield
him due Obedience, but did equally honor the Sun, Thunder, Earth, and other
things: giving him to understand, that in Heaven where he was, they called him
Viracacha Pachayachachia, which signifies universal Creator: promising also
that he would send men inuisibly to assist him against the Changuas, who had
lately defeated his brother.

Under this color, he assembled a mighty army, and overthrew the Changuas:
and from that time commanded that Viracocha should be held for universal Lord,
and that the images of the Sun and Thunder should do him reverence. And from
that time they set his image highest: yet did he not dedicate any thing to him,
So have some reasoned In Templis quid facit aurum? Pers.
saying, that he being Lord of all had no need. As for those invisible
Soldiers (a conceit like that which we have mentioned of the Turks) he
said that no man might see them but himself: and since they were converted
into stones: and in that regard gathered a multitude of stones in the
mountains, and placed them for Idols, sacrificing to them. He called them
Pururancas, and carried them to the wars with great devotion, making his
soldiers believe, that they had gotten the victory through their help. And
by this means he obtained goodly victories.

Next to Viracocha they worshipped the Sun: and after him the Thunder, which
they called by three names, Chuquilla, Catuilla, and Intijllapa, supposing it
to be a man in heaven with a Sling and a Mace, in whose power it is to cause
Rain, Hail, Thunder and other effects of the aerie Region.

This Guaca (so they called their Idols) was General to all the Indians of
Peru: and in Cusco they sacrificed to him Children, as they did to the Sun.
These three, Viracocha, the Sun, and Thunder, had a more especial worship
then the rest: they put as it were a Gantles or Glone upon their hands, when
they lifted them up to worship them. They worshipped the earth in the name of
Pacha^^a^a, and esteemed her the Mother of all things: the Sea also, and called
in Mamacocha: and the Rainbow, which with two Snakes stretched out on each
side, were the arms of the Ingas. They attributed diverse offices, to diverse
Stars, and those which needed their favor worshipped them: so the Shepherd
sacrificed to a Star, by them called Vrcuchillay, which they hold to be a
sheep of diverse colors, and two others stars called Catuchillay and
Vrcuchillay, which they fained to be and Ewe and a Lamb. Others worshipped a
star which they name Machacuay, to which they attributed the power over
Snakes and Serpents, to keep them from hurting them. To another Star called
Chug ^inchinch^y (which is as much as Tigre) they ascribed power over Bears,
Tigres, and Lions. They have generally believed that of all the beasts in the
earth, there is one like unto them in heaven, which has care of their
procreation and increase. Many other Stars they worshipped, too tedious to
rehearse. They worshipped also Rivers, Fountains, the mouths of Rivers,
entries of mountains, Rocks or great stones, Hills, and the tops of
mountains, which they call Apachitas. They worshipped all things in Nature,
which seemed to them remarkable and different from the rest.

They showed me, (it is Acostas speech) in Cazamalca, a Hill or Mount of sand,
which was a chief Idol or Guaca of the ancients. I demanded what Divinity
they found in it; they alleged the wonder, it being a high mount of Sand in
the midst of the thick mountains of stone. In the City de los Reyes, for
the melting of a Bell, we cut down a great deformed Tree, which for the
greatness and Antiquity thereof had been their Guaca. They attributed the like
divinity to any thing that was strange in this kind, as stones, or the Roots
Papas and Lallatrecas (which they kissed and worshipped) Bears also, Lions,
Tigres and Snakes, that they should not hurt them. And such as their Gods be,
such are the things which they offer unto them in their worship. They have
used, as they go by the way, to cast in the crosse-waies on the hills and
topps of mountains, old shoes, Feathers, and Coca chewed. And when they had
nothing else, they cast a sloue as an offering, that they might pass freely
and lustily; hence it is, that they find in the highways great heaps of
stones offered, and such other things. They used the like ridiculous offering
in pulling off their hairs of the eyebrows to offer to the Sun, hills,
winds, or any other thing which they fear. They report of one of the Inguas
that said he did not take the Sun to be a God, because he labors so much in
his daily journey. In fine, Ac.l.5.c.5.
every one worshipped what liked him best. The Fishers worshipped a Sharke or
some other Fish: the Hunter, a Lion, Fox, or other Beast, with many birds; the
countryman, the water, and Earth. Gom.c.121.
They believed that the Moon was Wife to the Sun: when they swear they
touch the earth, and look up to the Sun. Many of their Idols had Pastoral
staves and Miters like Bishops, but the Indians could tell no reason thereof:
and when they saw the Spanish Bishops in their Pontificalibus, they asked if
they were Guacas of the Christians.

They worshipped also (as before is said) the dead bodies of the Inguas,
preferuing them with certain Rosin, so that they seemed alive. The body of
Yupangui, the Grandfather of Atabaliba, was thus found, having eyes made of a
fine cloth of Gold so Artificially set, as they seemed natural, having lost
no more hair then if he had died the same day, and yet he had been dead
threescore and eighteen years. There also the Spaniards found his servants
and Mamacomas, which did service to his memory.

In some Province Cieza.c.50.
they worshipped the image of a Bull, in an other of a Cock, and in other,
others. In the principal Temple of Pachicama; they kept a sheFoxe and
worshipped it. The Lord of Manta kept a great and rich Emerald, as his
ancestors also before him had holden it, in great veneration: on some days it
was brought forth in public to be worshipped. They which were sick came in
Pilgrimage to visit it, and there offered their gifts, which the Cacique and
Ministers turned to their own profit. The Devil in many places did appear
unto them, and he indeed was Author of all these superstitions.

They have a Tradition concerning the Creation, Gom. hist. genesisc.122.
Apollon.l.^.
that at the beginning of the world there came one from the North, into their
country, called Con, which had no bones, went very light and swift, cast down
mountains, lift up the hills, onley with his will and word: He said he was
the son of the Sun, and filled the earth with men and women which they
created, giving them fruits and bread and other things necessary for humane
life. But being offended with some, he countermanded that former good, and
turned the fruitful lands into barren sands, as they are now in the Plains,
and took away the water that it should not rain (hence it came that there it
raines not) only leaving them the Rivers, of pure compassion, that they should
maintain themselves with labor. Afterward Calueto in Benz. l.3.c.2^.
came another from the South, called Pachicama, the son also of the Sun and
Moon, who banished Con, and turned his men into Cats, Monkeyes, Bears, Lions,
Parrats, and other Birds, and created the Progenitors of the present Indians,
and taught them to husband the earth and the Trees. They again to gratify
him, turned him in their imaginations and superstitions unto a God, and named
the province four leagues from Lima of his name. He Cieza c.72.
continued till the Christians came to Peru. He was their great Oracle, and as
some Indians affirm, he still continues in secret places with some of their
old men and speaks to them. Of this Temple we shall after speak.

They hold opinion Gom. vbi sup.
also, that on a time it rained so exceedingly, that it drowned all the lower
Countries, and all men, save a few, which got into caves upon high hills
where they shut up themselves close, that no rain could get in: there they
had stored much provision and living creatures. And when they perceived that it
it had done raining, they sent forth two Dogs, but they returning all myrie
and foul, they knew that the waters had not yet ceased: after that they sent
forth more Dogs, which came back again dry. Then did they go forth to
people the Earth: but were mightily afflicted with multitudes of great Serpents
which had sprung up out of those mirie Relics of the Flood: This is like
Ouids tale of Pyth^n, etc. Met.1.
but at last they killed them. They believe also that the world shall have an
end, but before the same shall go a great drought, and the Sun and Moon,
which they worship, shall be consumed: and therefore they make grievous
lamentations when there is any Eclipse, especially of the Sun, fearing the
destruction of it and the world. They believe the immortality of the soul, as
we shall more fitly see when we come to their Buriallrites.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Religious Persons, Temples, Confessions, and sacrifices in Peru.

NO man might come to the Guacas or Idols but Priests. These were clothed in
white, and when they came to worship, they prostrated Apoll^^.l.^.
themselves on the ground, and holding in their hands a white cloth, did speak
to their God in a strange language, that the people should not understand.
These have the authority in their holies, and consecrate both the things
living, and the offerings of other things. In the sacrifices they diuined by
inspection of the inward parts, especially by view of the heart, if it were of
a man. And if they find not signs answerable to their expectation, they never
cease off from sacrificing till they do find them, believing, and making the
people believe, that God is not till then pleased with their sacrifices. They
bare incredible show, and were had in great reputation, of holiness. When they
were to sacrifice they abstained from women, and if they had committed any
trespass, they did expiate and purge the same with fasting: in sacrificing
they did bind, and blind their eyes, and were sometimes so transported with
Zeal, that with their nails they scratched or pulled out their eyes, as has
been seen. Neither did the people alone admire their holiness, but the
Princes also, who would do nothing of moment without their advise. They also
without fear or flattery, declared unto them what they had received from
their Oracles. The manner of their devil consultation was this. In
Acost.l.5.c.12.
the night time (commonly) they entered backward to their Idol, and so went
bending their bodies and heads after an ugly manner, and thus consulted with
him. The answer he made was for the most part like unto a fearful hissing,
or to a gnashing, which did terrify them. These Oracles are now ceased.

Apollonius speaks of two mighty Princes, Leu.Apol.l.1.
not far from Chili, one of them named Lychengorme, they are able to bring
into the field two hundred thousand men, and are very rich: but the cause why I
here mention them is that number of Priests which he says are reported to
belong to one of their Temples to the number of two thousand.

In every Province of Peru, there was one principal house of adoration. The
ruins Gom.c.121.
of the Temple of Pachacama are still to be seen. That, and the Temples of
Colia^, and Cusco were lined within with Plates of Gold and Silver, and all
their service was of the same, which proved great riches to the conquerours. In
Pachacama the Sun was worshipped with great devotion. There were kept in the
same many Virgins. Francis Pizarro Cieza.c.72.
sent his brother Hernando (when he had taken Atabaliba) to spoil this Temple,
but the Priests and chief men had carried away above four hundred burdens
of Gold before he came, and none does know what became of it. Yet did he find
there some quantity of Gold and Silver remaining. They sacked the Sepulchers
also, and thence drew abundance of the said metals. From that time hitherto,
the Temple went to ruin.

The Temple of Cusco Acost.l.5.c.12.
was very sumptuous, the pauement and Stones yet remain witnesses of the
ancient splendour and magnificence. This Temple was like to the Pantheo^ of
the Romans: for that it was the house and dwelling of all the Gods. For the
Inguas did there behold the Gods of all the Nations and Provinces they had
conquered, every Idol having his proper place, whither they of that Province
came to worship it, with excessive charge for the same. And thereby they
supposed to keep safely in obedience those Provinces which they had conquered,
holding their Gods as it were in^ hostage. In this house was the Pincha^, which
was an Idol of the Sun, of most fine Gold wrought with great riches of
Stones, the which was placed to the East with so great Art, as the Sun at
his rising did east his beams thereon, which reflected with such brightness,
that it seemed another Sun, They say that at the spoil of this Temple, a
Soldier had for his part this goodly Pincha^, and lost the same in a night at
play, whence grew a proverb of Gamesters in Peru, They play the Sun before
sunne-rising. In some parts of Peru, Cieza.c.64.
as at Old Port and Puna, they used the detestable sin against Nature: yes,
the Devil so far prevailed in their beastly devotions, that there were boys
consecrated to serve in the Temple; and at the times of their sacrifices and
solemn Feasts, the Lords and principal men abused them to that detestable
filthiness. And generally in the hill-countries the Devil under show of
holiness had brought in that Vice. Every Temple or principal house of
adoration kept one man or two or more, which went attired like women, even from
the time of their childehood and spoke like them, lmitating them in every
thing. Under Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum.
pretext of holiness and Religion, their principal men, on principal days,
had that hellish commerce. A Friar dealt with two of these Ganimedes, about the
filthiness of this Vice, and they answered that they held it no fault; for
from their childehood they had been placed there by their Caciques, both for
that employment, as also to be Priests and to keep the Temple. Thus far had
they banished Nature, to entertain Religion, and thus far had they exiled
the soul of Religion, retaining only a stinking carkaffe.

At Ganada in Cieza c.77. and 80.
in Ca^imalca the Inguas built a Temple in honor of the Sun. There were
Virgins kept which intended nothing but to weaue, and Spinne, and Dye clothes,
for their Idolatrous services. The like was in other places. In Guanuco was a
stately palace of great stones, and a Temple of the Sun adioining, with a
number of Virgins and Ministers, which had thirty thousand Indians for the
service thereof. The service which most of them did is like to be the tilling
of the ground, feeding of Cattle, and such like before mentioned, which they
were bound to do for the Inguas, and also for the Guacas, that is, Idols, and
Idoll-houses. But it were a wearisome Pilgrimage to go and lead my Reader
with me, to every of their Temples, which for the most part had the same rites,
according to that proportion of maintenance which belonged to them.

Gomara Gom.c.121.
reports that their houses of women were as Cloisters or Monasteries,
enclosed, that they might never go forth. They guelded men, which should
attend on them, cutting off also their noses, and lips, that they should have
no such appetite. It was death for any to be found false and incontinent. The
men that entered in to them were hanged up by the feet. These made robes for
the Idols, and burned the overplus with the bones of white sheep, and hurled
the Ashes into the air toward the Sun. If they proved with child, and swear
that Pachacama did it, the issue was preserved.

Of these Monasteries or Nunneries thus writes Acosta. There were in Peru,
many Monasteries of Virgins, Acost..1.5.c.15.
but not any for men (except for their Priests and Sorcerers) at the least one
in every Province. In these were two sorts of women; one ancient, which they
called Mamacomas, for the instruction of the young; the other of young Maidens,
placed there for a certain time, after which they were drawn forth, either
for the Gods, or for the Ingua. They called this house or Monastery Aelaguagi,
that is, the house of the chosen. Every Monastery had his Vicar, or Governor,
called Appopanaca, who had liberty to choose whom he pleased, of what quality
soever, being under eight years of Age, if they seemed to be of a good stature
and constitution. The Mamacomas instructed these Virgins in diverse things
needful for the life of man, and in the customs and ceremonies of their Gods.

Afterward they took them from thence, being above fourteen, sending them to
the Court with sure guards, whereof some were appointed to serve the Idols, and
IdollTemples, keeping their Virginity for ever: some other were for ordinary
sacrifices that were made of Maidens, and other extraordinary sacrifices, they
made for the health, death, or wars of the Inguas: and the rest served for
Wives and Concubines to the Ingua, or such as he gave the^ to. This
distribution was renewed every year. These Monasteries possessed rents, for
the maintenance of these Virgins. No Father might refuse his daughter, if the
Appopanaca required her: yea, many fathers did willingly offer their Daughters,
supposing it was a great merit to be sacrificed for the Ingua. If any of these
Mamacomas or The young VirginNunnes.
Aellas were found to have trespassed against their honor, it was an incuitable
chastisement to bury them alive, or to put them to death, by some other cruel
torment.

The Inguas allowed a kind Acost.l.5.c.26. Sorcerers.
of Sorcerers or Soothsayers, which (they say) took upon them what form and
figure they pleased, flying far through the air in a short time. They talk
with the Devil, who answers them in certain stones, or other things, which
they reverence much. They tell what has passed in the furthest parts, before
news can come. In the distance of two or three hundred leagues, they would
tell what the Spaniards did or suffered in their civil wars. To work this
divination, they shut themselves into a house and became drunk, till they lost
their senses: a day after, they answered to that which was demanded. Some
affirm they use certain unctions. The Indians say that the old women do
commonly use this office of Witchcraft, especially in some places. They tell
of things stolen or lost. The Anaconas (which are the servants of the
Spaniards) consult with them, and they make answer, having first spoken with
the Devil in an obscure place; so as the Anaconas hear the sound of the
voice, but understand it not, nor see any body. They use the Herb Villea, with
their Chica (drink made of Mays) and therewith make themselves drunk, that
they may be fit for the Devils conference. The conference with these Witches is
one of the greatest lets to the proceeding of the Gospel amongst them.

Among their Religious persons, I may reckon their Confessors. They Id^m.c.^5.
Confessions.
held opinion that all Adversities were the effects of sin: for remedy
whereof they used sacrifices. Moreover, they confessed themselves Verbally
almost in all Provinces, and had Confessors appointed by their superiors to
that end, with some Reservation of Cases for the Superiors. They received
Penance, and that sometimes very sharply, when they had nothing to give the
Confessor. This office of Confessor was likewise exercised by women. The manner
of the Ychuyri Ychuyri.
was most general in the Provinces of Collasuio. They discovered by lotts, or
by the view of some beasts, if any thing were concealed, and punished them
with many blows of a stone upon the shoulders, until they had revealed all:
after that they enjoined them Penance, and did sacrifice. They likewise used
Confession, when their Children, Wives, Husbands or Caciques were sick, or in
any great exployt. When the Ingua was sick, all the Provinces confessed
themselves, chiefly those of Collao. The Confessors were bound to hold their
Confessions secret, but in certain cases limited. The sins which they
chiefly confessed were, killing one another out of war, stealing, to take
another man's Wife, to give poison, or Sorcerie, to do any harm, to be
forgetful in the reverence of their Guacas, not to observe Feasts, to speak
ill off, or to disobey the Ingua. They accused not themselves of secret sins.
The Ingua confessed himself to no man, but to the Sun, that he might tell
them to Viracocha, of him to obtain forgiveness: which done, he made a
certain bath to cleanse himself, in a running River, saying; I have told my
sins, to the Sun, receive them then River, and carry them to the Sea, where
they may never appear more. Others that confessed used likewise those bathes.
When any man's Children died; he was holden for a grievous sinner, saying, that
it was for his sins, that the son died before the Father. Such therefore,
after they were confessed, were bathed in the said bathe, and then came a
deformed person, to whippe them with certain Nettles. If the Sorcerers or
Inchanters by their lotts or diuinations affirmed that any sick body should
dye, the sick man makes no difficulty to kill his own son, though he had
no other, hoping by that means to escape death, saying that in his place he
offered his son in sacrifice. The Penances enjoined them in Confessions were,
to fast, to give apparel, gold or silver, to remain in the mountains, and to
receive many stripes upon the shoulders.

The Sacrifices of the Indians may be Gom.c.121 Acost.l.5.c.18.
reduced into three kinds; of insensible things; of beasts; of men. Of the
first sort were their sacrifices of Coca (an Herb of much esteem) of Mays,
Feathers, Gold, and Silver, in figures of little beasts, or in the form of
that which he sought for: also of sweet wood, and diverse other things, whereby
their Temples became so rich. They made these offerings Sacrifices and
offerings.
to obtain a good wind, health, fair weather and the like.

Of the second sort of Sacrifices, were their Cuyes, which are like Rabbets,
and for rich men in matters of importance, Pacos (the great Camell-fashioned
sheep) with curious observation of the numbers, colors, and times. The manner
of killing their Sacrifices, is the same which the Mores now use, hanging the
beast by the right fore-legge, turning his eyes toward the Sun, speaking
certain words, according to the quality of the sacrifice. For if it were
colored, they directed their words to the Thunder, that they might want no
water; if white, to the Sun, that he might shine on them; if gray, to
Viracocha. In Cusco they did every year kill and sacrifice with this
solemnity, a shorn sheep to the Sun, and did burn it, clad in a red
Wastcoate, casting small baskets of Coca into the fire. They sacrificed also
small birds on this manner: they kindled a fire of Thorns, and cast the small
birds in, certain officers going about with round stones, wherein were carved
or painted Snakes, Lions, Toads, Tigers, and saying Vsachum, that is, let the
victory be given us, with other words. They drew forth certain black sheep,
called Vrca, which had been kept certain days without meat, and therefore
used these words: So let the hearts of our enemies be weakened as these beasts.
And if they found, that a certain piece of flesh behind the heart were not
consumed by fasting, they took it for a bad sign. They sacrificed also
certain black dogs, which they slew and cast into a Plain, with certain
ceremonies, causing some kind of men to eat the flesh, which they did, lest
the Ingua should be hurt with poison. And for this cause they Fasting.
fasted from morning till the stars were up, and then glutted themselves.
This was fitting to withstand their enemies gods. They offered shelles of the
Sea to the Fountains, saying, that the Shelles were the Daughters of the Sea,
the Mother of all waters. These shelles they used (in manner) in all
Sacrifices. They offered Sacrifice of whatsoever they did sow, or raise up.
There were Indians appointed to do these Sacrifices to the Fountains,
Springs, and Rivers, which passed through their Towns or by their Farms, that
they might not cease running, but always water their grounds. Gomara Gom.qu^
supra.
says, that their Priests married not, went little abroad, fasted much,
although no Fast lasted above eight days; and that was in their Seed time,
and in Harvest, and in gathering of gold, and making war, and talking with
the Devil: yea some of them (I think) for fear, because they are blindfolded
when they speak with him, put out their eyes; they enter into the Temples
weeping and lamenting, which the word Guaca signifies Mourning.
Guaca signifies. They touch not their Idols with their hands without clean
and white linen, they bury in the Temples the offerings of Gold and Silver,
in their Sacrifices they cry alowd, and were never quiet all that day nor
night: they anointed with blood the faces of their Idols and doors of their
Temples; they sprinckle also their Sepulchers. The Acosta qu^ supra.
Sorcerers did conjure, to know what time the Sacrifices should be made, which
being ended, they did gather of the contribution of the people what should be
sacrificed, and delivered them to such as had charge of the Sacrifices. In the
beginning of Winter, at such time as the Waters increased by the moisture of
the weather, they were diligent in sacrificing to the Waters. They did not
sacrifice to the Fountains and Springs of the Deserts. And even to this day
continues this their respect to these Springs and Rivers. They have a special
care to the meeting of two Rivers, and there they wash themselves for their
health, first annoynting themselves with the flower of Maiz, or some other
things, adding thereto diverse ceremonies, which they do likewise in their
baths.

Their third kind of Sacrifices was the most unkind and unnatural, namely of
men: We have showed before of their butcheries, at the burialls of their great
Lords. Besides this they used in Peru to sacrifice young children, from four
or six years old to ten: the greatest part of Sacrifices were for the
affairs that did import the Ingua, as in sickness for his health, for
victory in war, at the Coronation or giving him the Royal Roll. In this
solemnity they sacrificed two hundred children. The manner of the Sacrifice,
was to drown and bury them with certain ceremonies: sometimes they cut off
their heads, annoynting themselves with the blood from one ear to the other.
They did likewise sacrifice Virgins, of such as were brought from their
monasteries. The common sort (as you have heard) being like to die, would
sacrifice their own sons to the Sun or Viracocba, desiring him to be so
content, and spare the fathers life.

When they sacrificed, they Gomara.
observed the heart and other the inward parts for divination, and if they saw
a good sign (after their bad construction) they daunced and sung with great
merriment; if a bad, they were very heavy: but, good or bad, they would be
sure to drink deep. They eat not their humane Sacrifices, but sometimes
dried them and preserved them in coffins of silver.

It were an endless toil, to reckon up all the superstitions of Peru, in
which were so many Nations, agreeing in disagreeing from truth, yet disagreeing
in their diuersified errors. To let pass Pa^cura, which fat, sacrifice, and
eat their captives, and every tuesday offer two Indians to the Devil; and the
drunken Province of Carrapa, where they eat little, and drink much, at once
drinking in, and pissing out; the Mitimaes which are early at their meat, and
make but one drinking in the day (which lastes from morning till night) by
Bacchus Privilege enjoying without control any woman they like: The Canari
put their wives to the drudgery abroad, whiles themselves spinne, weaue,
trick up themselves, and perform other womanish functions at home: The Galani
make their Captives drunk, and then the chief Priest cutteth off their heads,
and sacrifices them. Sansovin and Selva pa.5.
Generally, in the mountains they were more cruel, but all observed bloody,
beastly, diabolical ceremonies, the recounting whereof must needs weary the
patientest Reader.

CHAP. XII.
Of their supputation of Times, of the Feasts, Sepulchers, and other Peruvian
superstitions.

BEfore we speak of the Peruvian Festival times, it is not amiss to take
some more general view of their Calendar. They Acosta libr.6.^a.3.
divided their year into so many days just as we do, and into so many
Months or Moons. To make the Computation of their place certain, they used
this industry: Upon the mountain about Cusco there were twelve pillars set in
order, and in such distance, as every month one of these pillars did note the
rising and setting of the Sun. They called them Saccanga; by means whereof,
they taught and showed the Feasts, and the seasons fit to sow, and reap, and
for other things. They did certain Sacrifices to these Pillars of the Sun.
Every month had his peculiar name and Feasts. They sometimes began the year
in January: but since, an Ingua called Pachacuto, which signifies a Reformer
of the Temple, began their year in December, by reason, as it seems, of
the Suns return from Capricorn, their nearest Tropicke. I read not of any
weeks they observed: for which they had not so certain a rule, as the Suns
course was for the year, and the Moons for the month.

They observed in Peru two kinds of Feasts: some ordinary, which fell our in
certain months of the year, and others extraordinary, which were for
certain causes of importance. Every month of the year they made Feasts and
Sacrifices: and had this alike, the offering of a hundred sheep, but of unlike
color and form, according to the month. In the first month they made their
first and principal Feast, therefore called Capacrayme, that is to say, a rich
and principal Feast. In it they offered a great number of Sheep and Lambs in
Sacrifice, and burnt them with sweet wood: then they caused Gold and Silver to
be brought upon certain Sheep, setting upon them three Images of the Sun,
and three of the Thunder, the Father, the Son, and the Brother. In these
Feasts they dedicated the Knights of Peru.
Inguas Children, putting the Guaras or Ensigns upon them, and they pierced
their ears: then some old man did whippe them with slings, and annoint their
faces with blood, in sign that they should be true Knights to the Ingus. No
stranger might remain in Cusco during this month, and this Feast, but at the
end thereof they entered, and were made partakers of the Feasts and Sacrifices
after this manner. Acosta libr.5. ca.23.
The Mamacomas or Nuns of the Sun made little loaves of the flower of Maiz,
died and mingled with the blood of white Sheep, which they did sacrifice that
day: Then they commanded that all Strangers should enter, who set themselves
in a certain order: and the Priests which were of a certain lineage,
descending from Liuqui Yupangui, Arite resembling the Christians Communion In a
deuillish Apishnesse,
gave to every one a morsel of these small loaves, saying that they gave it
them to the end they should be united and confederate with the Ingua: and that
they advised them not to speak or think any evil against the Ingua, but
always to bear him good affection: for that this piece should be a witness
of their intentions, and, if they did not as they ought, would discover them.
They carried these small loaves in great platters of gold and silver,
appointed for that purpose; and all did receive and eat those pieces, thanking
the Sun and the Ingua. This manner of communicating they used likewise in the
tenth month called Coyarayme, which was September, in the Feast called Cytua.
They likewise sent of these loaves to all the Guacas of the Realm, whither the
people assembled to receive them: to whom they said that the Sun had sent
them that, in sign that he would have them honor him, and the Caciques. This
continued from the time of Ingua Yupangui, whom we may call the Perovian Num^,
till the Spaniards substituted in place thereof their Mass, a mass of
Corruptiooptimi pessima. Powlder traitors.
more monstrous absurdities, (in their transubstantiation, bread-worshipping,
God-eating, which they can also use to combine subjects, not to their Inguas or
lawful Princes, but against them, as our Powlder-traitours did) then the
former, notwithstanding the fairer pretexts of Christian and Catholic titles.

But to return to our Capacrayme, it is strange that the Devil has not only
brought in an apish imitation of Christian Sacraments, but of the Trinity also
in their Pagan rites. For the Father. Son, and Brother, called Apomt^,
Churunti and Intiquaequi, that is, Father Sun, Son Sun, Brother Sun, had some
show of that great mystery. In like manner they named the three Images of the
Chuquilla, or God of the Air, whence are thunders, raines, and snowes. They
had one Guaca where they worshipped an Idol called Tangatanga, which they said
was one in three, and three in one. Thus does the Devil despite the truth,
which he would seem to imitate. In the second month, called Camey, besides
the sacrifices which they made, they cast the ashes into the River, following
five or six leagues after, praying it to carry them into the Sea, for that the
Viracocha should there receive this present.

In the third, fourth, and fifth month, they offered a hundred sheep, black,
speckled, and gray, with many other things. In the sixth month they offered a
hundred sheep more, of all colors: and then made a Feast, bringing Maiz from
the fields into the house, which they yet use. This Feast is made, coming from
the farm to the house, saying certain songs, and praying that the Maiz may
long continue. They put a quantity of the Maiz (the best that grows in their
Farms) in a thing which they call Pirua, with certain Ceremonies, watching
three nights. Then do they put it in the richest garment they have, and being
thus wrapped and dressed, they worship this Pirua, holding it in great
veneration, and saying, it is the mother of the Maiz of their inheritances, and
that by this means the Maiz augments, and is preserved. In this month they
make a particular sacrifice, and the Witches demand of this Pirua, if it has
strength enough to continue until the next year. And if it answers no, then
they carry this Maiz to the Farm whence it was taken, to burn, and make an
other Pirua as before: and this foolish vanity still continues. In the
seventh month they made the Feast Intiraym^ and sacrificed a hundred Guanacos
in honor of the Sun ^ they made many Images of Quinva-wood carved, all
attired with rich garments, they daunced, and cast flowers in the high ways,
and thither came the Indians painted and singing.

In the eight month they burned a hundred sheep, all gray, of the color of
Viscacha with the former solemnities. In Yapaguis their ninth month, they
burnt a hundred sheep of Chestnut color: and likewise a thousand Cuyes (a
kind of Rabbets) to the end the frost, air, water, and Sun, should not hurt
their Farms. In the tenth month called Coyarami, they burnt a hundred white
sheep that had fleeces: and then they made the Feast Sitna in this manner.
They assembled together the first day of the Moon before the rising thereof,
carrying Torches in their hands: and when they saw it, they cried alowd,
saying, They which did this were called Panco^co^.
Let all harm go away, striking one another with their Torches: which being
done, they went to the common Bath, to the rivers and fountains, and every one
to his own Bath, setting themselves to drink four days together. In this
month also the Mamacomas made their loaves (as is said) of communicating with
the Sun, and the Ingua. The bathes, drunkenness, and some relikes of this
feast Sitna remain still, with the ceremonies a little different, but very
secretly. In the eleventh month they offered also their hundred sheep. And if
they wanted water to procure rain, they set a black sheep tied in the
midst of a Plain, pouring much Chica about it, and giving it nothing to eat
till it rained. This Acost.libr.4.ca.16. Chica, what it is.
Chica is a drink or wine made of Maiz, sleeped and boiled, and will sooner
make one drunk then wine of grapes: they have an other way to make it, by
champing the Maiz, which they hold then best, when it is done (after the
beastliest manner) by old withered women. This drunken people will spend whole
days and nights in drinking it, and it is therefore forbidden by the Law. But
what Law can prevail against the Devil and the drunkard? We need not go to
Peru to prove this.

The twelfth and last month they sacrificed a hundred sheep, and solemnised
the Feast called Raymacantar Rayqnis. In this month they prepared what was
necessary for the children that should be made Nouices: the month following,
the old men made a certain show, together with the Children, in Rounds and
Turnings, which they commonly do, when it raineth too much, or too little, and
in the time of Plague.

Among the extraordinary Feasts (which were many) the most famous was that
which they called Ytu. This had no time prefixed, but by Necessity or
Distress. And then the people prepared themselves thereto, by fasting two
days; during which they did neither company with their wives, nor eat any
meat with salt or garlic, nor drink any Chica. All did assemble together in
one place, where no stranger, nor any beast might be admitted; they had
garments and ornaments which served only for this Feast. They marched very
quietly Procession.
in Procession, their heads covered with their vailes, sounding of drums,
without speaking one to an other. This continued a Day and a Night: The day
following they daunced and made good cheer for two days and two nights
together, saying that their prayer was accepted. Even still they use one which
is somewhat like this, called Ayma, with garments only serving to that end,
and make procession with their Drums, having fasted before, concluding with
good cheer. And although the Indians forbear sacrifices because of the
Spaniards, yet they use many ceremonies still, which had their beginning from
their Ancient superstitions.

Now concerning their funerals. The Indians Acost.l.5.ca.7
of Peru believed commonly, that the soul lived after this life, and that the
good were in glory, and the bad in pain. They used a wonderful care
Funerals.
to preserve the bodies, which they honored after death: their successors
gave them garments, and made sacrifices to them, especially of the Inguas, of
whom we have spoken before. In their bloody funerals the woman he loved best
was slain, and multitudes of other attendants of all sorts for his new family
in the other world, and that, after many songs and drunkenness. They
sacrificed to them many things, especially young children, and with the blood
they made a stroke on the dead man's face, from one ear to the other. This
cruelty is common through a great part of the East and West Indies, as in their
places this History does show you: wittily avoided once by a Portugal Witty
escape
, who was a captive, and to be slain at the funerals of his Lord, and having
but one eye, saw better to save his life then if he had had both. For he told
them that such a deformed and maimed fellow would be a disgrace to his Master
in the other life, and so persuaded the Executors, or Executioners (if you
will) to seek a new choice. The Indians have another ceremony more general,
which is to set meat and drink upon the grave of the dead, imagining they did
feed thereon. At this day, many Indian Infidells do secretly draw their dead
out of the Churchyard, and bury them on hills, or upon passages of mountains,
or else in their own houses. They have also used to put Gold and Silver in
their mouth, hands, and bosom, and to apparel them with new garments,
durable, and well lined. They believe, that the souls of the dead wander up
and down, enduring cold, thirst, hunger, and travel: and for this cause they
use their Anniuersaries, carrying them clothes, meat, and drink.

Pedro de Cieza Cieza pa.1.ca.62.
reports, that in Cenu in the Province of Cartagena (which we here mention
for proximitie of rites, rather then of place) near to a Temple built in
honor of the Devil, there was taken forth an innumerable quantity of
Sepulchers, more then a million of them, old and new. Himself was there
present. Much treasure is found in the graves. Iuan de la Torre took forth of
one Sepulcher Rich Sepulchers.
more then five hundred thousand pezos. The great men adorned their Sepulchers
with Vaults and Towers, and had with them interred their women, servants, meat,
chicha, arms and ornaments. He adds, that the Devil (in the shape of some
principal person deceased) would sometimes appear, and show them news out of
that other world, how he lived and fared there. And hence (it seems) came
that spoil of so much wealth, and so many persons, for their funerals. But
take heed (Reader) that you do not believe it was the Devil that was wont to
appear in some habit of afflicted souls, and demanded Dirges and Masses for
their manumission out of Purgatory: alas the Devil was confined to the
Indies, and would never have been so good a Purueyor for the Popes kitchen.
And certes, if our Christian auncesters had not their wives and goods buried in
their graves, with food, raiment, and ornaments: yet these things were also
buried with them, whiles the fears of Purgatory made them willing to endow
the Priests and Monasteries, and bestow on Lights, and other rites, that which
should have maintained their houses, their wives, and children. But how come
we from Peru to Rome? Nay, how comes Rome, if not from Peru, as more lately
discovered, yet with Peru, and with, and from, other heathen nations in the
world, in her manifold ceremonies and superstitious rites? as this Relation of
Peru, for their Confessions, Processions, and many other rites will show, and
one day I hope more fully to acquaint the world, when we come in our Pilgrimage
to visit Christian-Antichristian Rome.

And thus we take our leave of this Continent, and must into the adjoining Sea,
to observe matters of principal note we shall there find.

not come home to fill English ears with the news. The Reader also, by this
time wearied, will be glad to hear of an end.

In this Sea we may see many Islands which Nature has seemed to set, as
Centinells, along the coast, to hold their watch, as skowts to epsy, and as
Garrisons to defend their Sovereign, Earth, lest the Ocean (by secret
underminings, or by violent and tempestuous force, should be too busy an
incroacher.

sommoned them all home to her borders, and placed them for her better defense
in st^^ions near ^ir, not suffering them to stray abroad, as in other Seas is
usual: so that there are almost no Islands in this wide^^ of Seas, the
Peaceable, but near the maine. If there be any, they are obscure, small, and
not worthy our re^ation. As for those of Salo^^qi and New Guinea, with their
neighbors, they are reckoned to Teira Australis.

Archipelago of Saint Lazaro, these Islands may be reckoned vn^uely borderers,
which wh^^e ^t is uncertain, whether they should acknowledge the soueraignetie
of Asia, Terra Australis, or America, are loyal to none; and therefore, where
they are best known, are known by the name of The Ladrones or Islands of
Thieves.

closely, or openly, any thing they could lay hold on. They shot at them in

if they had been ^^^ted alike to both Elements. The women also, no less then
the men. They are a beastly people, pollo^ing themselves in promiseuous lusts,
and branded (many of them) with the marks of their inte^perance; the pockes
having eaten their no^es and ^^ppea. They are b^owne, fa^e, long of slature:
the men go naked; the women wear a lease before them, so that they bear some
resemblance to the Pictures of Adam and Eve. Their boats are twenty soote
long, and but a soot and half broad, cunningly wrought. They are extremely
greedy of iron, of which metal the Hollanders cast five pieces into the Sea,
to try them, and one of them fetched them all our. But left these Thieves rob
us of our intended Devotions, and our Reader of patience in longer stay here,
we will look back toward the Straits, and so compass the other side of
America. Many Islands we may see here near the shore, all along as we pass.
But what should we trouble the Reader with names? I have small devotion to
them, unless I had some intelligence of some devotion in them, further then
that wherein they agree with the Peruuian rites, wherewith you were last tired.

In the Straits are some Islands of small quantity, of smaller dignity: and
who would stay there, where the Penguins Csrtaine fowls which breed on the
Islands.
are your best Hosts? the rest are Giants or Man-eating Savages: and in the
next, out of the slraits, but seals, who all can yield but an inhospitall
hospitalitiy. Neither has provident Nature in all those coasts of Chica, or
Brasil, bin prodigal of her Iland-store, foreseeing that they would, either be
usurped by Seals and Sea Monsters, or other more unnatural and monstrous in
humane shape, of deuillish inhumanitie, from the land. It seems she has been
the more sparing in the numbers, nobleness, or quantity of Islands in all those
Seas, which we have most swiftly surrowed, that she might in the great Bay more
bountifully impart her plenty, and show her excelience in that kind. This is a
great field, as it were, sown with Islands of all sorts; the Earth seems a
loving mother, which holds open her spacious lap, and holds out her
s^etched arms between Paria and Florida: the Ocean also, as jealous of the
earths more natural inheritance and claim unto them, seems to neglect his
course to the Southward, and here sets in with a violent current, always forcing
his waterie forces to walk (or rather to run and fly) these rounds, to see
that the Continent keep her hand off, and not once touch his conquered
possessions; that though (like Tantalus) she seems always to be closing her
open hands, and mouth upon them; yet are they kept by this officious
watchfulness of the Sea, that she can never incorporate and vnice them to her
self. Easily can they unfold this mystery, that are acquainted with the site
of the Earth, Pet. Mar.dec. 3.libr.6.
and the swiftness of the Current in this vast space of Earth and Sea, setting
in at Paria, and after out again at Florida, with admirable and incredible
violence.

To begin then at P^ria: (for of Orenoque and his mouth-full of Islands, and of
Trinidad, that has escaped the River, and betaken her self wholly to Neptunes
Loves, we have already spoken.) Here two rows and ranks of Islands make show
and muster of themselves: the one extending East and West, the other North and
South. Of the former is Margarita, which (like many a Gallant, whose back
robs his belly, whose bowels empty of necessaries, always are croaking and
complaining of superfluity in ornament and fashion) so has she a Mundus
m^^iebris.
World of Pearls to adorn her, but wants water to satisfy her thirst:
store of Pearls she can communicate of her plenty; water she is feign to
borrow of her neighbors.

The like we may say of Cubagua her next neighbor, that by her store of
Pearls has won suitors from our, and the American world, whom she can
neither bid eat or drink of her Land-hospitalitie, where Grass and Water
are wanting. But as it usually comes to pass with these Fashion-mongers, which
neglecting necessaries, must at last be neglected of their ornaments too: So
this Island which sometime was so rich, notwithstanding all her Pearls, she
pawned for her diet, that the Kings Botero del lsole, l.3.
fist amounted ordinarily to fifteen thousand ducats a year, yet now seems
almost beggered, her Pearle-fishes and Pearle-fishers, most of them gone: and
now it is time for us to be gone from her too.

Little business can we find any further, in following that Western rank,
Orchilia, Oruba, and the rest, and therefore will look Northwards, to that
other Rank we spoke of: where leaving Tobago on the right hand, we see
before us Granata, Saint Vincent, Saint Luciae, Dominica; and then circling to
the Northwest, Desiderata. Saint Christopher, Holy Cross, and others, whose
names, without other matter of History, would be but tedious to the Reader.
These, and a multitude of others unmentioned, are called the Islands of the
Caribes, or Cannibals. The inhabitants P.Mart, Dec.3.l.6.
eat man's flesh, and pass to other Islands with their Boats to the hunting
of Men, as other Hunters do for Beasts. Carib signifies stranger; for so the
more innocent Indians esteem them. At home they only cover their priuities,
but in time of War they use many ornaments. They are nimble, beardlesse
(using little Pincers to pull out the hairs) shoot poisoned Arrows, bore
holes in their cares and nosthrills for elegancie, which the richer sort deck
with Gold, the poorer with shells. From the tenth or twelfth year of their age
they carry leaves, to the quantity of Nuts, all the day in either cheek,
which they take not out, but when they receive meat or drink. With that
medicine they make their teeth black: they call other men Women, for their
white teeth, and Beasts for their hair. Their teeth continue to the end of
their lives without ach or rottenness. When the men went on man-hunting,
(which they did sometimes in long and far expeditions) the women manfully
defended the coast against their Enemies: and hence it is in Martyrs P.Mart.

judgment, that the Spaniards tell of Islands inhabited only with women: which
may be Paloephatus fab.l.1. says the Amazones were Thracian men, close shaven,
in long garments, and therefore called women: but denies, that there was ever
any such Amazonian Expedition, as Histories speak of.
the true interpretation, happily, of I know not how many places in America,
besides those of Asia and Africa, reported Amazonian. Pontius P.M.Dec.1.l.2.
would war upon the Caniballs, but on the Island of Guadalupea his women were
taken, his men slain, himself forced to depart from that both Place and
Enterprise. Colnmbus in his second Voyage landed on this Island, where he saw
their round houses, hanging-beddes of Cotton, and certain Images, which he
had thought had been their Gods: but by interpreters after learned, that they
were but for ornament, and that they worshipped nothing but the Sun and
Moon, although they make certain Images of Cotton, to the similitudes of such
fantasies as (they said) appeared to them in the night. They found earthen
Vessels, like ours, also in their Kitchins, Man's flesh, Duckes flesh, and
Goose flesh, all in one pot, and other on the Spits, ready to be laid to the
fire. Entering into their inner lodgings, they found faggots of the bones of
men's arms and legs, which they reserve to make heads for their Arrows. They
found in their Villages one Hall, or Palace, to which they assemble, as to
their Theater, or Playing place. The inhabitants at the sight of the Spaniards
were fled. In their houses they found about thirty children Captives, which
were reserved to be eaten, but they took them for their Interpreters. Here
they had Parrots bigger then Phesants, with backs, breasts, and bellies of
Purple color. They used to prey on Hispaniola, and S. John's Island, or
Buriquen: and if these, in their wars with the Caniballs, took any of them,
they were sure to go to pot (even in the first sense) and to be eaten.

A little before Master Hawkins was there, in the year 1564, Nau.M.John
Hawkins, ap. Hak.to.3.
a Spanish Caravell coming to water at Dominiea, one of the Caniball Islands,
the Savages cut her Cable in the night, and so she drove on shore, and all her
company was surprised and eaten by them. In Tortuga they tolled certain
Spaniards a shore, under pretense of Traffic, and then eat them. Boriquen
Botero, vol.2.
is three hundred miles long, and threescore and ten broad, trauersed with a
rough Mountain, which yields many Rivers. The Spaniards have there some
Towns. These Islands are not so well peopled as in former times: and many of
them are retyring places of Rebels and Fugitives, which take this shelter
against the Spanish cruelties. Hispaniola is the next Island of name, but shall
have a place by it self, as a Map and Summarie of all the other.

Iamaica is almost as large as Boriquen. It is extremely subject to the
Vracani, which are such terrible gusts of Wind, that nothing can resist them.
They turn up Trees, ouer-turne Houses, transport the Ships from Sea to the
Land, and bring with them a most dreadful and horrible confusion. They reign,
or tyrannize rather, in August, September, and October Mar.Dec.^.l.2.
. The inhabitants are of quicker wits then the other Islands.

Cuba is more Northerly, and extends it self three hundred Leagues in
length, and twenty in breadth, full of Mountains, Woods, Fennes, Rivers,
Lakes, both salt and fresh. This Ort^l.Theat.
Island has had many names given by the Spaniards; Fernandina, Ioanna, Alpha
and Omega. The Woods are replenished with Swine and Kine; the Rivers yield
golden Sands. It has six Spanish Colonies. Saint Iago, a Bishops See, is the
chief Town in the Island; and Havana is the chief Port of all the Indies.
Ouiedo reckons two things most admirable therein: one a Valley, trending
between two Hills three Leagues, which produces abundance of Stones, enough
to lade many Ships, of a perfect round form, like Bullets: The other a
Fountain, whence Bitumen, or a certain Pitchie substance, flows and floteth
even to the Sea, excellent for pitching of Ships. In this Island the common
people were prohibited the eating of Serpents, as being reserved for Royal
dainties, and the Prerogative of the Kings Table.

Columbus Mart.Dec.1.l.2.
sailing by this Island, lighted into a Nauigable River, the water whereof was
so hot, that none might endure his hand long therein. He espied also a Cano^
of Fishermen, which after a strange fashion used to hunt Fish, and take them by
the help of another Fish, which they kept tied in a cord by the Boats side;
and when they espied a Fish, loosed the cord; this hunting Fish presently lays
hold on the prey, and with a skin like a purse growing behind her head,
graspeth it so fast, that by no means it can be taken from her, till they draw
her up above the water, and then not able to abide the air, she resigneth her
prey to the Fishers, which leap out into the water, and take it; in recompense
whereof they give her part of her purchase. He found also in this Coast Waters,
for the space of forty miles, white and thick like milk, and as though Meal
had been strewed through that Sea: other Waters he found Botero.
spotted with white and black, and others all black. An old man of
fourscore years being a Governor in this Island, came to Columbus, and with
great gravity saluted him, and counseled him to use his victories well,
remembering, that the Souls of Men have two Iourneyes, after they are departed
from their bodies: The one foul and dark, prepared for injurious and cruel
persons; the other pleasant and delectable, for the peaceable, and lovers of
quiet.

Many other Islands might be here mentioned, and but mentioned: little to our
purpose I find in them. Of Acusamil, near Iucatan, is already spoken. Of the
Lucaiae, or Iucaiae, the greatest thing is their great number, which some
P.M.Dec.7.1.
esteem above four hundred. Lucaio is a general or collectiue name, as
Zeland, Lequio, Malucco. The Spaniards had carried the inhabitants, as Martyr
testifies, into servitude, to satisfy their insatiable desire of Gold. The
women of these Islands were so fair, that many of the bordering Countries
forsook their own Country, and chose this for their love. These women wear
nothing till the time of their menstruous purgation, at which time the parents
make a Feast, as if she were to be married; and after that, she wears
before those parts Nets of Cotton, filled with leaves of herbs. They obey
their King so strictly, that if he command them to leap down from an high
Rock, alleging no other reason then his will, they perform the same. But
they are now, and were long since, desolate Dec.7.8.
, being wasted in the Mines of Hispaniola and Cuba, or by diseases and famine,
to the number of twelve hundred thousand.

But I am loath to wilder my self further in this Wilderness of Islands (for
so have the Spaniards made them:) Dec.1.l.2.
Columbus in one Voyage gave name to seven hundred Islands; of which I can
report little, fitting this our Pilgrimage. Hispaniola is Lady and Queen of
them all, and (as it were) the common Storehouse of all their excellencies: and
therefore we will there make some longer stay.

CHAP. XIIII.

HIspaniola or Spagniola Ortel.Theat.
is Eastward from Cuba. It was of the first Inhabitants called Quisqueia,
afterward Haiti, and by Columbus Columbus called it Cipanga, thinking it to be
that Island which Marcus Paulus call, by that name in the East. Ens, l.2.

He called it also Ophir, thinking it to be that whence Solomon had his Gold.
Mart.Dec.3. l.7.


Cipanga and Ophir. The Spaniards call it as we first mentioned, and also S.
Dominike or Dominge of the chief City an Archiepiscopall Sec. It contains
in compass five hundred and fifty leagues. They called the Island Quisqueia,
which signifies Great and All, thinking that the Sun gave light to no other
world then this and the other Islands adioining. Haiti signifies Craggie, and
such is the Island in many places, with high Craggie Hills, ouerlooking the
deep and dark Valleys. But in many places it is most beautiful and
flourishing. It seems to enjoy a perpetual spring, the trees always
flourishing, and the meadows clothed in green. The air and the waters are
wholesome. It is in manner equally divided with four great Rivers descending
from high mountains, whereof Iunna runs East; Attibunicus, West; Na^iba, to
the South; and Iache, Northward. Some divide it into five Provinces, Caizcimu,
Hubaba, Caibabo, Bainoa, Guaccaiarima. In the first of these there is a great
Cave, in a hollow Rock, under the root of a high Mountain, about two furlongs
from the Sea; the entry is like the doors of a great Temple. Many Rivers stole
their waters from the sight of the Sun, the use of men, and the ordinary
officers of Neptunes Custom House, and by secret passages came and hid
themselves in this Cave. So the Islanders imagined, seeing diverse Rivers
swallowed up of the Earth, after they had run fourscore and ten miles, and
such a Sink or Channel of waters in the Cave.

The Islanders believed, That the Island had a vital Spirit, and that there it
does breath: and a hole therein is the female nature thereof (for of that sex
they deem it) even as Antiquity conceited the ebbing and flowing of the Sea
to be the breath of Demogorgon.

Andreas Dec.7.8.
Moralis entered in with his Ship, which was almost swallowed with the
Whirle-pooles, and boiling of the water. Clouds, engendered of those waterie
conflicts, and Darkness, laid hold on his eyes; terrible noise, as of the
falls of Nilus, made deaf his ears, that when with labor he had gotten out,
he seemed to have escaped the barkings of Cerberus, and the obscure Vaults of
Hell. Upon the tops of high Mountains, the same Moralis saw a Lake, three
miles in compass, into which many little Rivers ran, without any other
apparent issue.

In Bainoa is a Lake of Salt water, notwithstanding it receives four great
fresh Rivers, from the East, West, North, and South, and twenty smaller: and
within a furlong of the Lake, on the North side, are two hundred fresh Springs.
It is thought to have a large intercourse with the Ocean, because there are
Sharkes (great Seafishes, which devour men) in the same. Here are storms and
tempests, which seem to be the Caters and Purueyors for those Fishes, in
drowning many. Diverse other Lakes are mentioned in this Island; one whereof,
partly salt, partly fresh, is five and twenty miles long, and eight broad.
They are all in a large Plain, a hundred and twenty miles in length and
breadth, between eighteen and five and twenty. There is another Vale two
hundred miles long, and broader then the former: and another as broad as that,
which is a hundred and fourscore miles long.

Bart, de las C^sas tells of a Kingdom in Hispaniola, called Magua, which
signifies a Plain, compassed about with Hills, which watered the same with
thirty thousand Rivers and Brooks; twelve of them were very great: and all
which come from the West (twenty thousand in number) are enriched with Gold.

Cotobi is a Plain on the tops of Hills, so high, that it is subject to the
four seasons of the year. There is also another Region of the same name, most
barren, and yet most rich; full of Mines, otherwise unfruitful; a thing common
in Nature, that great Mines undermine fertility; and not strange amongst men,
that the greatest hoorders of Treasures are the most unfruitful, and barren in
good works. The Gold (they say) is as a living Tree, which rooting in the
center of the Earth, sends forth branches unto the uppermost face of the
Earth, and there shows forth certain beautiful colors in stead of Flowers,
round stones of golden Earth in stead of Fruits, and thin plates in stead of
Leaves. From this Island Dec.3. l.4.
was yearly brought four or five hundred thousand ducats of Gold yearly.
They imagine some divine nature to be in Gold, and therefore never gather it,
but they use certain religious expiations, abstaining from women, delicate
meats and drinks, and all other pleasures.

There is an Island a little from Hispaniola which has a Fountain in it,
coming by secret passages under the Earth and Sea, and rises in this Island:
which they believe, because it brings with it the leaves of many Trees, which
grow in Hispaniola, and not in this Island; the Spaniards call the Isle,
Arethusa

The Isle R.Tomson ap. Hak.to.3.
of Hispaniola is much infested with Flies, or Gnats, whose pricking causes
wonderful swelling: also there is a Worm which creeps into the soles of
men's feet, and makes them grow as big as a man's head, with extremity of
pain; for which they have no remedy, but to open the flesh sometimes three or
four inches, and so dig them out. The Gnats Mart.dec.7.9.
are so troublesome, that the inhabitants do therefore build low houses, and
make little doors, which they keep close, and forbear to light Candles.
Nature has to this disease ordained a remedy, namely, certain creatures,
called Cucuij, which is a kind of Beetles. These have four lights, which
shine in the night; two in the seat of his eyes, and two which he shows when
he opens his wings. The people get these and bring them to their houses,
which there do them a double service: they kill the Gnats, and give so much
light, that men may see to read letters by the light of one; and many of them
seem as so many candles. They had but three sorts of foure-footed Beasts, and
those very little. Now men are exhaust, and Beasts multiplied, in so strange
manner, that one Deane, of the Conception, carrying a Cow thither, she was
alive six and twenty years after, and her fruitful generation was multiplied
in the Island to eight hundred. They are now grown wild, as their dogs
also. They kill their Kine for the Hides: five and thirty thousand were
transported to Spain when Acosta returned 1587.

Before the discovery of this Island by Columbus and the Spaniards, these
Ilanders of Hispaniola were forewarned thereof by Oracle. Their Mart.
Dec.1.l.9.
Cacikes and Botritij (that is, their Kings and Priests) reported to Columbus,
That the father of Garionebius, the present King, and another Cacike, would
needs be importunate demaunders of their Zemes, or Gods, of future events, and
therefore abstained five days together from all meat and drink, spending the
time in continual mourning. The Zemes made answer, That there would come, not
many years after, unto that Island a strange Nation, clothed, bearded, armed
with shining swords, that would cut a man asunder in the middle; which should
destroy the ancient Images of their Gods, abolish their Rites, and slay their
children. To remember this Oracle, they composed a mournful Dittie, which
they call Are^to, which on some solemn days they used to sing.

Now concerning these Zemes (which could foretell that which they could not
auert) and the superstitions of Hispaniola, Mart.ibid.
the Spaniards had been long in the Island before they knew, that the people
worshipped any thing but They worshipped the Sun, and prayed to it at
Sunne-rising.
the Lights of Heaven; but after, by further conuersing and living amongst
them, they came to know more of their Religion, of which, one Ramonus, a
Spanish Heremite, writ a Book, and Martyr has borrowed of him to lend us. It
is apparent by the Images which they worshipped, that there appeared unto them
certain illusions of evil spirits. These Images they made of Gossampine
cotton hard stopped, sitting, like the pictures of the Devil, which they
called Zemes; whom they take to be the mediators and Messengers of the Great
God, which they acknowledge One, Eternal, Infinite, Omnipotent, Invisible. Of
these they think they obtain rain, or fair weather, and when they go to
the Wars, they have certain little ones which they bind to their foreheads.
Every King has his particular Zemes, which he honors. They call the
eternal GOD by these two names, Iocauna, and Gua^^aonocon, as their
predecessors taught them, affirming, That he has a father called by these five
names, Attaberra, Mamona, Guacarapita, Liella, Guimazoa.

They make the Zemes of diverse matter and form: some of Wood, as they were
admonished by certain Visions appearing to them in the Woods: others, which
had received answer of them among the Rocks, make them of Stone: some of
Roots, to the similitude of such as appear to them when they gather the
Roots, whereof they make their bread, thinking, that the Zemes sent them
plenty of these Roots. They attribute a Zemes to the particular tuition of
every thing; as sometimes the Pagan and now the Popish Romans: some assigned
to the Sea, others to Fountains, Woods, or other their peculiar charges. When
the Boitij consult with the Zemes, they go into the house dedicated to him,
and with the poulder of the herb Cohobba, snuffed into their nosthrills, are
distracted; after which, returning as out of a trance, he tells, That the
Zemes had spoken to him, and utters his revelations. They say, That a
certain King, called Guamaretus, had a Zemes, whose name was Corochotum, which
often used to descend from the top of the house, where Guamaretus kept him
close bound: the cause of his breaking loose was either to hide himself, or to
go seek for meat, or else for the act of generation: and that sometimes being
offended, that the King Guamaretus had not honored him diligently, he was
wont to lie hid for certain days. In this Kings Village were some children
borne with two Crowns, which they supposed to be the issue of this Zemes. And
when this Village was burned by the enemy, this Zemes brake his bands, and was
found a furlong off, without any harm. He had another Zemes, called
Epileguanita, made of Wood, being in shape like a foure-footed Beast, which
went often from the place where he was honored, into the Woods. When they
perceived that he was gone, a great multitude gathered together to seek him,
with devout prayers: and when they had found him, brought him home religiously
on their shoulders, to the Chapel dedicated unto him. But after the Spaniards
coming into the Island, he fled for altogether, and could never be found,
whereby they diuined the destruction of their Country.

They honored another Zemes, in the likeness of a woman, on whom waited two
other, like men. One of these executed the office of a messenger to the Zemes,
that had authority of Clouds, Winds, and Rain, and are at command of this
woman: the other performed the like to the Zemes of the Waters, that fall from
the Hills, that being loosed, they might break into Floods, and ouerflow the
Country, if the people do not give due honor to her Image.

Let us add to this relation of the Zemes of Hispaniola an accident in
Mart.Dec.2.l.6.
Cuba. A Mariner being sick, was there left on shore, who recovering, grew
into favor with the King, and was employed in his wars with great success
against the enemy: He attributed his victories to the Virgin Marie, whose
picture he had in his bosom. The King by his persuasion rejected his Zemes,
and dedicated a Chapel and Altar to this Picture, whither he and all his
family resorted a little before the Sunne-set, bowing their heads, and saying,
Aue Maria, Aue Maria, further they could not say. They be^et the same with
Jewels, and many earthen pots, some with sundry meats, some with water, round
about the Tabernacle, which they offered in stead of sacrifice, as before they
had done to their Zemes. Being demanded, why they did thus, they answered,
least it should lack meat, for they believe, that Images may hunger, and do
eat and drink.

They told of this picture, That being carried with them into the Wars (as
they use to bring their Zemes with them into the battle) this made the Zemes
of the enemy turn his back, yea, a woman (a lie, or a Devil) descended in
the sight of them all to play the Bellona for her followers; and in a
contention betwixt them, whether the Zemes or this Lady were more excellent,
two young men of each side were bound, and whether Deity should loosen her
party, that should be their God. Both inuoke, the Devil appeared in ugly
shape, and by and by a fair Virgin, whereat the Devil vanished (do you
believe it?) and the Virgin with touch of a rod loosed her man's bands, which
were found on the other adverse party, being now double-bound. Thus can the
Devil transform himself into an Angel of Light at Loretto, in Hispaniola,
and where else soever he can be entertained; the name of Saints, and promise of
Heaven, shall further his hellish designs.

They had festival Solemnities in Hispaniola Dec.7.10.
to their Zemes, whereunto the Kings summoned their subjects by public Criers:
and they, neatly dressed after their manner, and painted with diverse colors
of herbs, resorted thither, with their arms, thighs, legs, adorned with
shells, to make Music in their dancing. Thus they presented themselves
before the King, who sat drumming at the entrance of the gate. When they were
to sacrifice, they purged themselves first, thrusting down a sacred hook into
their throat, and by vomit emptied their bodies. After, they went into the
Kings Court, and all sat in a ring about the Idol, crosse-legged like
Tailors, and wrynecked for reverence, praying, that their sacrifice might be
accepted. The women in another place, when the Priests gave warning, fell to
dancing and singing the praise of their Zemes, and offered Cakes in baskets,
concluding with Songs in praise of their ancient Kings, and prayers for future
prosperity. After this, both sexes kneeled down, and offered their Cakes;
which the Priests receiving, cut in pieces, giving to every man a portion,
which he kept untouched the whole year, for a holy Relic, esteeming that
house in danger of Fire and Whirlewinds, that is not preserved with this
reserved piece of Cake. They seemed sometimes to hear a voice from their
Zemes, (whether by the illusion of the Priests, or the Devil) which the
Priests interpreted by their behauior: for if they daunced and sung, all was
well: but if they went sorrowfully, the people went forth sighing, and gave
themselves to fasting, even to extreme faintness with weeping, until they
thought their Zemes reconciled.

Touching the original of Man, thus they fable. There is in the Island a Region
called Caunana, where they feign that mankind came first out of two Caves of a
Mountain called Cauta: and that the biggest sort of men came forth of the
mouth of the biggest Cave, and the least sort out of the least Cave: this Cave
they name Amaianna, the greater, Caziba^agua. Before men might come out of the
Cave, the mouth thereof was kept and watched nightly, by a man whose name was
Machoshael, who departing further to look abroad, was by the Sun (the sight
of whom he was forbidden) turned into a stone. They feign the like of others
turned into trees, for going so far a fishing in the night, that they could
not return before the rising of the Sun. A certain Ruler also, called
Vagoniona, sent one forth of the Cave a fishing, who by the Suns surprisall,
was turned into a Nightingale, which therefore in the night bewaileth his
misfortune. Vagoniona sore troubled with this loss, leaving the men in the
Cave, brought forth the women and sucking children, and leaving the women in an
Island of that Tract, called Mathinine, carried the children away with him,
which being oppressed with famine, fainted; and remained on the banks of a
certain River, where they were turned to Frogs, and cried toa, toa, as
children with them use to cry for the dugge. And hence also come those
pitiful cryings of the Frogs in the Springtime. As for Vogoniona, he by
special privilege was not transformed: wandering in diverse places, he
descended to a certain fair woman, whom he saw in the bottom of the sea, and
received of her bright plates of Laten, and a kind of stones which their Kings
greatly esteemed. Another Cave they had (for the former tale is endless, as
superstition commonly is) called Ionana boina, adorned with pictures of a
thousand fashions. In the entrance were two graven Zemes, whereof one was
called Binthaitel, and the other Marohu. Out of this Cave they say the Sun
and Moon first came to give light to the world. They made religious concourse
to these Caves, as men go on Pilgrimage to Rome, Compostella, or Jerusalem.

They had a superstitious conceit of their dead: who (they thought) walked in
the night, and eat the fruit Guannaba (which is like to a Quince) and that they
would deceive women, in taking the shape of men; making, as though they would
have to do with them, and suddenly vanish away. If any feeling a strange thing
in his bed, made doubt whether it were a dead body, he might be resolved by
feeling on his belly, because these ghosts could take all other members of man's
body, but not the navel (as some with us imagine that the Devil can take the
whole shape of a man, only his claws excepted): these dead men, they say,
often met them by the way, and if a man were not afraid, they vanished; but if
he were afraid, they would assault him, and many hereby have been taken with
the loss of their limbs. These superstitions were left them by tradition in
rithmes and songs from their forefathers, which it was lawful for none to
learn, but only the Kings sons. They sung them before the people on solemn
Feasts, playing on an instrument like a Timbrel. Their Boitij or Priests
instruct them in these superstitions: these are also Physicians, making the
people believe that they obtain health for them of the Zemes. They tie
themselves to much fasting, and outward cleanlineffe and purging; especially
where they take upon them the cure of great men: for then they drunk the
powder of a certain herb, which brought them into a fury, wherein they said
they learned many things of their Zemes.

Much ado they make about the sick party, deforming themselves with many
gestures, breathing, blowing, sucking the forehead, temples, and neck of the
patient; sometimes also saying that the Zemes is angry for not erecting a
Chapel, or dedicating to him a Gro^e or Garden, or the neglect of other
holies. And if the sick party die, his kinf-folkes by witchcraft enforce the
dead to speak, and tell them whether he died by natural destiny, or by the
negligence of the Boitij, in not fasting the full due, or ministering convenient
medicine: so that if these Physicians be found faulty, they take revenge of
them. They used in ministering their Physic, to put certain stones or bones
in their mouths, which if the women can get, they keep religiously, believing
them to be profitable for them in travel, and honor them, as they do their
Zemes.

When their Kings died, they buried the best beloved of their concubines with
them, who also had other women buried for their attendants, together with their
jewels and ornaments. They had in the sepulcher beside them a cup full of
water, and some of their Casaui-bread.

Having thus wearied you with this long stay in Hispaniola (by which ye may
guess of the neighboring Islands) we will have homeward, and not touching in
any Island by the way (for we could but touch and away) we may adventure,
notwithstanding the wonted danger, upon Bermuda. Danger has made it now not so
dangerous: nocuments have been documents. For while some have bin wracked
there, they have made virtue of Necessity, and so well observed the coast, that
skill has almost secured that which Nature had seemed to set there in
defiance, both of Habitation and Navigations, to both which it is now subjected
by our Nation. It was called Bermuda of that ship which first discovered it:
Boter^.
it is also called the Island of Devils, which they suppose inhabit there; and
the Enchanted Island: but these are enchanted conceits. Sir George Summers has
deserved that it should bear his name, by his endeavors thereabouts testified
in life and death. He with Sir Thomas Gates, as before is said, were wracked on
the Island, which loss turned to some gain, as if GOD would give them this
into the Virginia-bargaine. Before in the year 1593. Henry Henry May ap.Hak.
tom.3.
May, an Englishman, in a French ship was wracked thereon, and has given us
some discourse thereof: more fully has Syluester Syl. Iourdan.
Iourdan, one of that Virginian Company, one of the company of those worthy
Knights, in a Treatise of that ship-wracke, and the discovery of Bermuda. The
commodities whereof he reckons, variety of fishes, plenty of hogs (which it
seems have escaped out of some wracks) diverse fruits, Mulberies,
Silke-wormes, Palmitos, Cedars, Pearls, Amber-grife: But the most strange
thing seems the variety of foul, of which they took a thousand of one sort
in two or three hours, being as big as a Pigeon, and laying speckled eggs,
as big as Hens eggs, on the sand, where they come and lay them daily,
although men sit down amongst them.. When Sir Thomas Gates his men have taken
a thousand of them, Sir George Summers men have staid a while by them, and
brought away as many more. Another foul there is, that lives in holes like
Cony-holes; their eggs like in quantity and quality to Hen-egges. Other
birds were so gentle, that whistling to them, they would come and gaze on you,
while with your stick you might kill them. Other eggs they had of Tortoises,
a bushel in the belly of one, very sweet: they took forty of them in a day:
and one would serve fifty men at a meal. Two were there borne, and other two
married, to take the most natural possession thereof for our Nation; which now
in hope of good success has there planted an habitation. That wracked company
built there a ship and a pinace, and set sail for Virginia. From hence and
thence I am now passing in an English ship for England, where to pass away
tediousness of the Voyage, I will entertain my Reader with a discourse of the
more then tedious and fastidious Spanish cruelties.

CHAP. XV.
Of the Spanish cruelties in the West Indies: and of the perverse conversion of
the Indians unto Christianity.

FOrasmuch as the Papists do usually glory in the purchase of a new World
unto their Religion, and would have men believe, that since this
Scripture-Heresie has made new Rome to tremble now, no less then Hannibal did
her Pagan-Mother, they have a new Alan. Cop. velpoti^s N. Harpsfield, Dialogi,

the trueness and Catholicisme of their Church: it shall not be amiss to
observe the proceedings of the Spaniards in these parts. And herein we will use
the witness of men of their own Romish Religion. Josephus Acosta lib.4. de
procurand. ind. salute.ca.3.
Acosta, a Jesuit, writes, that the Indians conceive an implacal ^^hatred
against the faith, by the scandal of the Spaniards cruelties: and that they
^^^ue baptized some by force. Vega And. vega de f.and operibus q.3.
accuses them of Baptising without making them know the faith, or taking
knowledge of their life. He that will read what they lately have done in
Spain with the remnants of the Moors, may perhaps satisfy himself with the
reasons of Friar F. Damia^o Fonseca delgiuflo scacciamento de Moreschi da
Spagna.
Fonseca in defense thereof. But for the poor Indians, Bartholomaeus de las
Casas, Bar. Call. Hispan. Crudelt^at.
a Dominike Friar, of the same order with Fonseca, and after a Bishop in
America, has written a large and unanswerable Treatise of the enormious
cruelties, and unchristian Antichristian proceedings in the new World, the
sum whereof is this, that the Indians were a simple harmless people, loyal
to their Lords, and such as gave no cause to the Spaniards of dislike, till
they by extreme injuries were provoked: they are also docible and pliant, both
to good doctrine and living. To these Lambs, says he, the Spaniards came as
cruel and hungry Tygres, Bears and Lions, intending nothing those forty
years (he wrote this An. 1542.) but blood and slaughter, to satisfy their
Avarice and Ambition: in so much that of three millions of people, which were
contained in Hispaniola of the Natural inhabitants, there scarce remained at
that time three hundred. Cuba, and the other Islands had endured the like
misery, and in the firm Landten Kingdoms, greater then all Spain, were
dispeopled and desolate, and in that space there had not perished less then
twelve millions by their tyranny; and he might truly say that fifty millions
had paid Natures debt.

In the Island Hispaniola the Spaniard had their first Indian habitations, where
their cruelties drove the Indians to their shifts, and to their weak defense,
which caused those enraged Lions, to spare neither man, woman, nor child: they
ripped up the great-bellied women, and would lay wagers, who could with most
dexterity strike off an Indians head, or smite him asunder in the middle: they
would pluck the Infants by the heels from their mothers breasts, and dash out
their brains against the stones, or with a scoff hurl them into the River.
They set up gibbets, and in honor of CHRIST and his twelve Apostles (as they
said, and could the Devil say worse?) they would both hang and burn them.
Others they took, and cutting their hands almost off, bid them carry those
letters (their hands dropping blood, and almost dropping off themselves) to
their Contrymen, which (for fear of the like) lay hidden in the Mountains.
The Nobles and commanders, they broiled on gridirons: I once (says our Author)
saw four or five of the chief of them thus roasted, which making a lamentable
noise, the nicer Captain bad they should be strangled, but the cruel
tormentor, chose rather to stop their mouths, so to prevent their outcries,
and to continue their broiling till they were dead. They had dogs to hunt
them out of their couerts, which devoured the poor souls: and because
sometimes the Indians, thus provoked, would kill a Spaniard, if they found
opportunity, they made a law, that an hundred of them should for one Spaniard
be slain. The King of Magua offered to till the ground for them fifty miles
space, if they would spare him and his people from the mines. The Captain in
recompense deflowred his wife, and he hiding himself, was taken, and sent into
Spain; but the ship perished in the way, and therein that admirable P.Mart.
mentions this grain of gold: and likewise the Spanish cruelties; though not
so largely as Casas^
grain of gold, which weighed in the first finding, being pure, three thousand
and six hundred Crowns.

In the Kingdom of Xaraqua in Hispaniola, the Governor called before him
three hundred Indian Lords, which he partly burned in a house, and put the rest
to the sword, and hanged up the Queen, as they did also to Hiquanama the
Queen of Hiquey. Of all which cruelties our Author an eyewitness affirms,
that the Indians gave no cause by any crime, that had so deserved by any law.
And for the rest that remained after these wars, they shared them as slaves.
They which should have instructed them in the Catholic faith, were ignorant,
cruel, and covetous. The men were spent in the mines, the women consumed in
tillage, and both, by heavy burdens which they made them carry, by famine, by
scourging, and other miseries.

And thus they did in all other parts wheresoever they came. In the Isles of
Saint John, and Iamayca, were six hundred thousand Inhabitants, whereof then
when the Author wrote this, there were scarsely left two hundred in either
Island. Cuba extends furthest in length of any of these Islands. Here was a
Cacique named Hathuey, which called his subjects about him, and showing them a
box of Gold, said, that was the Spaniards God, and made them dance about it
very solemnly; and lest the Spaniards should have it, he hurled it into the
River. Being taken and condemned to the fire; when he was bound to the stake, a
Friar came and preached heaven to him, and the terrors of hell: Hathuey asked
if any Spaniards were in heaven, the Friar answered, yea, such as were good;
Hathuey replied, he would rather go to hell, then go where any of that cruel
Nation were.

I was once present, says Casas, when the Inhabitants of one town brought us
forth victual, and met us with great kindness, and the Spaniards without any
cause slew three thousand of them, of every age and sex. I, by their counsel,
sent to other Towns to meet us, with promise of good dealing, and two and
twenty Caciques met us, which the Captain against all faith caused to be
burned. This made the desperate Indians hang themselves (which two hundred did,
by the occasion of one man's cruelty): and one other Spaniard seeing them take
this course, he made as though he would hang himself too, and persecute them
in the regions of Death, which fear detained some from that selfe-execution.
Six thousand children died, says our former Author, in three or four months
space, while I was there, for the want of their parents which were sent to the
mines: they hunted out the rest in the mountains, and desolated the Island.
Neither did the other Islands speed better. The Lucaiae they brought to an utter
desolation: and shipping multitudes of men for the mines in Hispaniola, wanting
food for them; the third part commonly perished in the way; so that an
unskillful Pilot might have learned this way by Sea, by those floting marks of
Indian carcasses. This Spanish Pestilence spread further to the Continent,
where they spoiled the shores, and the Inland Countries of people. From Dariena
to Nicaragua, they slew four hundred thousand people with dogs, swords,
fire, and diverse tortures. Their course Mark this way of converting Infidels.
of preaching was, to send, under pain of confiscation of lands, liberty,
wife, life, and all, to acknowledge GOD and the Spanish King, of whom they had
neues heard. Yea, they would steal to some place half a mile off the City by
night, and there publish the Kings decree in this sort, being alone by
themselves. Ye Caciques and Indians of this or that place (which they named) Be
it known to you, that there is one GOD, one Pope, and one King of Castile, who
is Lord of these Lands, Come quickly and do your homage. And then in the
night, whiles they were asleep, fired their houses, and slew and took
captives at their pleasure, and then fell to search for Gold. The first Bishop
that came into these parts, sent his men to be partakers of the spoil. A
Cacique gave the Spanish Governor the weight in Gold of nine thousand crowns;
he (in thankfulness) to extort more, bound him to a post, and put fire to his
feet, and forced him to send home for a further addition of three thousand.
They not satisfied, persisted in their tormenting him, till the marrow came
forth at the soles of his feet, whereof he died. When any of the Indians,
employed by the Spaniards, failed under their heavy burdens, or fainted for
want of necessaries, lest they should lose time in opening the chain wherein
he was tied, they would cut off his head, and so let the body fall out. The
Spaniard robbed the Nicaraguans of their corn, so that thirty thousand died
of famine, and a mother eat her own child: five hundred thousand were carried
away into bondage, besides fifty or sixty thousand slain in their wars:
and now, says Casas, remain four or five thousand, of one of the most
populous Regions of the World. Here did Vaschus P.Mart.Dec.3. lib. Cortes
accustomed himself to have four Kings attend on him. Dec.8. lib.3.2.

He burned sixty Kings, their heirs looking on.


give at one time four Kings to be devoured of dogs.

In New Spain, from the year 1518. to 1530, in four hundred and fourscore
miles about Mexico, they destroyed above four millions of people in their
conquests by fire and sword, not reckoning those which died in servitude and
oppression. In the Province of Naco and Honduras, from the year 1524. to 1535.
two millions of men perished, and scarsely two thousand remained. In Guatimala,
from the year 1524. to 1540. they destroyed above four or five millions under
that Aluarado, who dying by the fall of his horse, as is before said,
complained (when he was asked where his pain was most) of his soule-torment:
and his City Guatimala was with a threefold deluge of earth, of water, of
stones, oppressed and overwhelmed. He forced the Indians to follow him in his
Expeditions, in Armies of 10. or 20000. not allowing them other sustenance,
then the flesh of their slain enemies, maintaining in his army shambles of
man's flesh. In Panuco and Xalisco their state was much like; one made eight
thousand Indians wall about his Garden, and let them all perish with famine. In
Machuacan they tortured the King that came forth to meet them, that they might
extort gold from him. They put his feet in the stocks, and put fire thereto,
binding his hands to a post behind him; and a Boy stood by basting his roasted
feet with oil, another with a crosse-bow bent to his breast, and on the other
hand another with dogs; of these tortures he died. They forced the Indians to
deliver their Idols, hoping they had been of Gold, but their golden hope
failing, they forced them again to redeem them. Yea where the Friars had in
one place made the Indians to cast away their Images, the Spaniards brought
them some from other places to sell them.

In the Province of Saint Martha they had desolated four hundred and fifty
miles of land. The Bishop wrote to the King, that the people called the
Spaniards Devils, or Yares, for their Diabolical practices; and thought the
Law, GOD, and King of the Christians, had been authors of this cruelty.

The like they did in the Kingdom of Venezuela, destroying four or five
millions, and out of that firm Land, carried to the Islands for slaves at
times, in seventeen years, a million of people.

But why do I longer trace them in their bloody steps; seeing our Author
that relates much more then I, yet protests that it was a thousand times
worse. Or what should I tell their sparing no persons, plucking the child from
the breast to quarter it to his dogs? torturing Kings with new devises,
borrowed either from the Inquisition, or from Hell? cutting off the noses and
hands of men and women that lived in peace with them? selling the father,
mother, child, to diverse places and persons? lying with the women (as one of
them bragged) that being with child, they might yield more money in the sale?
How was Nature become degenerate in these prodigious monsters? Even the Nature
of things might be abashed with the sense of this unnatural senselessenesse.
The Tygre would but devour his prey, and not curiously torment it; the Lion
sometimes spares it; nay their dogs have sometime been less dogged, then
their doggish Devilish matters. How may we admire that long-suffering of GOD,
that rained not a flood of waters, as in Noah's time, or of fire, as in Lots, or
of stones, as in Ioshuas, or some vengeance from Heaven upon these Models of
Hell? And how could Hell forbear swallowing such prepared morsels, exceeding
the beastliness of beasts, inhumanitie of wonted tyrants, and diuellishnesse,
if it were possible, of the Devils? But these you will say were Nulla sides

There perhaps you shall see their Priests reading, praying, and (this they
most glory of) preaching to convert the Indians by their word and works. Ask
Colmenero, a Priest of Saint Martha, who being asked what he taught the
Indians, said that he devoted them with curses to the Devil, and this
sufficed, if he said to them, Persignin Sanctin Cruces. You have heard what
good Divinity the Dominican preached to Atabaliba, King of Peru (which wanted
not her wants of millions by their cruelties, as well as the former). They
teach them (says Acost.de Proc. Ind.sal.l.4.c.3.
Acosta) a few prayers in the Spanish tongue, which they understand not; and
they which are more painful, a Catechism without explanation.

Their teaching is but a jest and shadow to get money: they follow dicing,
hunting, whoring; in so much that Baptism is scorned, and the Indians are
forced to it against their wills: and a sincere Io. Metell: Seq. prefat.in Osor.
and upright Judge was wont to say, that if he came into Spain, he would
persuade the King to send no more Priests into America; such is their
dissoluteness. They have indeed three Archbishoprickes; that of Dominico,
which has six Suffragane-Bishops; the second of Mexico, which has seven; the
third of Los Reyes, to which are subject three Bishops: yet these teach the
people vices by their practice and ill example; in so much that the Indians
(says Casas) are of opinion that the King of Spain (which has such subjects,
as the Spaniards show themselves) is himself most cruel, and lives on man's
flesh; and that of all Gods, the GOD of the Christians is the worst, which has
so bad servants, longing for their own Gods, of whom they never received such
ill, as now by this of the Christians. The Spaniards cannot endure the Indians
to hear a Sermon, thinking it makes them idle (as Pharaeoh said Exodus.5.8.17.
of the Israelites) and captious: they learn them Usury, lying, swearing,
blasphemy, repugnant to their Nature. Thus did a Cacique Benzo lib.2.cap.16.
describe a Christian to Benzo, by the unchristian course of the Spaniards.
Christian (says he, looking Benzo on the face) what are Christians? They
imperiously demand Mays, Honey, Silk, Raiment, an Indian woman to Iye with
them; they call for Gold and Silver, they will not work; are Gamsters, Dicers,
Wicked, Blasphemers, Back-biters, Quarellers: and concluded, that Christians
could not be good. Benzo said, that evil Christians did such things, not the
good ones: he replied, where are those good, for I never saw any but bad. He
was threescore and ten years old, and spoke Spanish perfectly. Benzo says,
that they would not look on the Christians, but curse them, and as before is
said, called them Virarochie.
Sea-froth. He being very inquisitiue to see what they thought of our faith,
reports, that some of them taking a piece of Gold, will say, Lo here the
Christians God: for this they kill us, and one another, for this they play,
blaspheme, curse, steal, and do all manner of villainies. Cap.1.8.
A Franciscan publicly said, that there was neither Priest, Monk, nor Bishop,
good in all India: and the Priests themselves will say, they came thither for
gain. A Caciques son which was towardly in his youth, and proved after
dissolute, being asked the reason thereof, said, Since I was a Christian I have
learned to swear in variety, to dice, to lie, to swagger, and now I want
nothing but a Concubine (which I mean to have shortly) to make me a complete
Christian. These indeed are the miracles that the Spaniards work in the
Indies, says our Author: I asked an Indian once if he were a Christian; he
again asked me if he should be the Bishops Groom a dozen years to keep his
Mule. Others of the Indians, save a little washing and some cold ceremonies,
know nothing of our religion.

The Indians have lived at more quiet with the Spaniards, since the King
proclaimed them free; yet still hate them: and for their Christianity,
Franciscus F. a Vic.Rel.5. De Indis.
a Victpria protests, that it does not appear to him, that Christian
Religion had been propounded in meet sort to the Indians: Miracles he heard
not of, but on the contrary, scandals, villainies, and many impieties. This is
the Preaching and Conversion the Romists boast of, and gull our European world
with musters of their miracles, and thousands of their Profelites, which we
rather pity then envy.

How the case is altered, since that new generation of the Ignatian brood has
taught (especially the Spaniards, whose they are, and whom they serve) a better
Catholicisme; let Arnauldus Arnauld. against the Jesuits.
tell you: he says, that they have indeed wrought miracles amongst the
Indians: among which he reckons Converting the Pagans, by butcherly
subuerting and ^^oting them out. In Hispaniola, by keeping the husbands and
wives in diverse works asunder, the old generation being thus worn out, and a
new prevented. In Peru they had public places of torture within the Marches,
wherein they might put a thousand at once, by tortures to draw forth
confessions of their hidden treasures: such as escaped, hanged themselves in
the mountains, and their wives by them, with their children at their feet. By
their dogs at land they worried them: and in their Pearle-fishing exposed
them to the ravening Sharkes, themselves more dogged and sharking then the
brute creatures; by fire and sword consuming twenty millions of the people. I
would give the Devil his due, and therefore would not ascribe all this to
those later Locusts, the Jesuits: who are yet accounted the most cunning and
zealous Architects, in setting up the roof of that aspiring Spanish Monarchy,
these and the like bloody foundations notwithstanding; and therefore may be
called Accessories after. As for the Spaniards, we see them, by testimony of
their own, accused of the same things. And how the Ignatians wash their hands
(not from, but in) blood, our Europe can testify.

What Devil brought the Inquisition (his fair daughter much resembling his
accursed presence) I know not: our Contrymen, Miles Phil. Job Hort.ap. Hak.
Philips, Hortop and others, knew to their cost. But what should we speak of
the Spanish cruelty to others? Look on their dealing with each other in
civil broils: thus dealt they with Columbus, rewarding him with chains, and
sending him prisoner to Spain, by that way which he first of all, and for
Spain, had discovered. What Roldanus and his rebellious faction did in
Hispaniola, and Vaschus in the Continent, Martyr relates. But the bloudiest
butcheries passed in Peru: where Covetousness, which before had joined, now
divorced the hearts of Pi^arro and Almagro; and after that, that nearer
conjunction of the head and body of Almagro; See Gomara, Apollonius, Benzo,
etc. of these civil wars in Peru.
revenged in the persons of all the Pi^arri, which again retorted the like
vengeance upon the Almagrists; their ghosts seeming, or some hellish Furies
rather, to be loosed on that Peruuian stage, and to have brought like
mischiefs to the beholders and actors in this Tragedy. Vengeance seemed to
have broken forth of Atabalibas tomb, armed with sword, fire, halters,
chains, yea the Spaniards themselves offered themselves her officious vassals,
to become cruel Executors of her bloody Will, in mutual executions upon
themselves. The awful names of Viceroyes, Governors, and Captains, were no
less subjected to imprisonment and death, then the poorest soldier. But for
these civil uncivil cruelties amongst themselves, they require a good Orator
to describe them: and those former tyrannies upon the Indians, are beyond all
oratory and description. Thunders from heaven had need be the voice to utter
such hellish and unheard of massacres, Devils from Hell were fittest scribes,
with the fiery characters of their infernal workehouses to register them, the
reading whereof might astonish the sense of the Reader, amaze his reason,
exceed his faith, and fill his heart with horror and uncouth passions. For me,
I want fit words to paint them in their black colors, my hand with
reluctation trembles at the writing, my tongue faltereth in the speaking, and
wholly I seem to my self surprised with distraction, and not to be my self,
whiles the view of this Spanish Medusa transformeth me into a stone: the rather
when I think such should our English Conversion have been, if in that dismal
year 1588. England had as well succeeded to them as the Indies: or if since,
our Catholic Preachers had prevailed in their Powder-proiects, in the year
1605. who for a Temple, chose a Vault, that their works of darkness might
be done in the dark, and their workhouse might be nearer to Hell, thence to
borrow at hand supplies of devilish devises, and in nearer familiarity to
consult with the Devil: for words they had prepared a sulfurous breath, the
smoke whereof might darken the Heavens; the fire might rent the trembling and
astonished Earth: the noise might make the Hearers past hearing, and being,
together: Once, those Hellish Cerberi by such preaching, had intended there to
have opened the mouth of Hell upon us, which should have swallowed our Laws,
our Religion, our Sun, Moon, and Morning-Starre (the King, Queen, and
Prince) Our fairest Sky of fixed and well ordered lights, then shining in
their greatest splendour of Parliament-brightnesse. The Giants of old were said
to be the sons of the Earth, but these, as they were engendered of Earth, so
had they incestuously violated that their mother (whether you understand it in
a literal or mystical sense) and begotten in her womb this Hell-monster of
their bloody Catholicisme; they had designed the time of her Travel, and
themselves would have been the Mid-wiues; the Devils had bidden themselves as
Gossips, and at that opening of the Earthes womb in her fiery travel, would
have sent that way into the world (to attend the babe) all the blacke-guard of
Hell, Treason, Superstition, Atheism, Ignorance, Fire, Sword, and all
Confusion, in a revolution of a worse Chaos, then that The words of Moses,
Genes.1. interpreted, without form and void:
Tohu and Bohu of old could have effected. Then should it have been no
marvel, if Rome, France, Spain, or any other had exercised tyranny or
cruelty, seeing all must have come short of the first Cruelty, which our
English Catholics had executed, to open the floudgates of blood unto them. And
all this was the Catholic cause, and these the Preachers, or the Vshers rather
to the Preachers (for the Jesuits will be angry if we take from them their
bloody privilege) of this new Catholicisme, which the Devil (till now he is
an older and cunninger Serpent) had never learned himself, not could learn
others, till he had gotten Ignatian Vshers in his hellish School. But whither
is your Pilgrim transported? Friend, I draw near my port, and leaving America
behind me, still red with this blood; now also having England in sight, which
(as from a greater height) was near to a more dangerous fall: and in this
subject, which is of the Spanish Cruelties, not written in hatred of their
Nation, because they are Spaniards, but of their Pseudo-chatholike Religion,
under show whereof, they there did, and here would have executed those
butcheries: and for thankfulness to GOD for our later Deliverance, of which
the time when I relate these things (being the return of that very November 5:
day, wherein those things should have been effected) justly demands my best
testimony: I have thus told out my Story. And now me thinks I see the shores
of England, from which my lingering Pilgrimage has long detained me: I hear
the Bells, and see the Bon-fires, with public acclamations of thankfulness
for that Deliverance, all singing their Hallelu-iahs, and saying, Psalm.118.24.
This is the Day which the LORD has made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.
And now I see a better sight then all my Pilgrimage could yield, Christian
Churches, without Heathenish, Jewish, or Antichristian pollutions: a Royal
King, truly entitled Desender of the Faith: a learned Clergy, wise and
Honorable Counselors; peaceable and loyal Commons; in a word, England
presents it self to mine eyes, representing to my mind a Map of Heaven and
Earth, in the freedom of body and soul, yea where our subjection and service
is freedom (which I have not elsewhere found in all my Perambulation of the
World) I feel my self herewith ravished, and in a joyful ecstasy cannot but
cry out: Matthew.17.4.
It is good for us to be here (in the true Church and Suburbs of the true
heaven): Here then Reader, let me rest me, till I see whether thy kind
acceptance of this, will make me willing to accept another and nearer (but
harder) European Pilgrimage.
