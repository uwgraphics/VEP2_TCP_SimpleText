MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Jtalian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE.

Newly Englished.

IN LONDON

PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please him self, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare ye well.

Your well-willer R. H.

MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Jtalian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE.

Newly Englished.

IN LONDON

PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please him self, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare ye well.

Your well-willer R. H.

MVSICA SACRA: TO Six Voices.

Composed in the Jtalian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE.

Newly Englished.

IN LONDON

PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assign of William Barley. 1608.

To the virtuous Lovers of Music.
THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco
Bembo a Gentleman of Italy; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most
excellent Musicians of the world; as well for their Poesy, as Piety (the
Substance of them being drawn from those seven notable Psalms called
Penetentials; indicted by that Sweet Singer of Israel, inspired of the holy
Spirit) as that he thought it worthy of his skill in Music, to apply them to
this Harmony of Six parts; as well to honor their Author and his
Composition, as to give a profitable Delight unto the virtuous. And my self
often observing the general applause given these Songs when I have heard them
soong, (though sometimes without the words) thought it would be very grateful
to many of our English lovers of Music, if they were translated, or imitated
in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of understanding the
Italian, they are deprived of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that
the very concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sense of the ear;
yet it is the Dittie, which conuayed with the Music to the intellectual
Soul, by the Organs of hearing, that does touch the heart, and stir the
affections either to Iocondnes, or Sadness, Leuitie, or Gravity, according to
the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especially) the articulate
voice of man excels all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides
I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not only in our tongue, but in all other
vulgars) of Music in this kind, whereby men may be edified and God
glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peradventure be a motive
to some of our excellent Musicians to dedicate their divine skill to the
Service of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kind* In which respects; and
for that I was encouraged thereto by some, Skillful in this Art: I have
adventured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) unto the view of
the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to
run the ordinary fortune (even of more exact labors) upon the Shelues of
ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spy
them: As for the Supercilious Critic if (after he have compared them with the
Original) he dislike them: he may please himself, and do them all better:
But do Ye accept them with a Serene browe, and use them to the glory of God,
and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare ye well.

THIRD SONNET
Ex Psalm. 38 LOrd, in thine Anger do no more reprove me,
Nor in thy Fury multiply my Sorrows;
