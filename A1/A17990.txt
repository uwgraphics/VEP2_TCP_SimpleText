A Preface to the skillfull Musician.
SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit the first fruits
of these my labors to your judicial opinions, then generally to the common
censure of the ignorant: knowing you will favorably conceal or amend what is
amiss and give the rest their due, (if they shall deserve any thing at all) I
have labored somewhat to imitate the Italian, they being in these days (with
the most) in high request, yet may I not nor cannot forget that I am an English
man. So wishing to you as to my self I end. From Norwich the xxviij. of
March. 1601.

^ THe love of change has changed the world throughout, ^ ij. ij. and what is
counted ^ ^ good but that is strange, New things wax old, old new, all turns
a- ^ bout, turns a- bout, and all things change, ij. except the ^ love of
change, Yet find I not that love of change, that love of change ^ in me, but
as I am, I am, ij. so will I always be. ij. ^ ij. ij. ^

II. CANTVS.
^ COntent thy self with thy estate, seek not to climb a- ^ boue the skies,
for often love is mixed with hate, and twixt the flowers ^ the Serpent lies,
where Fortune sends her greatest joys, There once ^ possessed they are but
toys* there once pos- sest they are but toys, where ^ Fortune sends her
greatest ioies, there once possessed they are but toys. ^ there once pos- sest
they are but toys.

What thing can earthly pleasure give,
That breeds delight when it is past?
Or who so quietly does live
But storms of cares do drown at last?
This is the lone of worldly hire,
The more we have the more desire.
Wherefore I hold him best at ease,
That lives content with his estate,
And does not sail in worldly Seas,
Where mine, and thine, do breed debate:
This noble mind even in a Clown,
Is more then to possess a Crown.
III. CANTVS.
^ THe self same thing that gives me cause to die, is ^ only means for which
I life de-sire, The self same could by which ^ as dead I^^ie, is only means
to kindle greater fire, the less I feel ^ my self in hope to speed, the more
desire this want to hope does breed, ^ the less I feel my self in hope to
speed, the more desire this want ^ of hope does breed, of hope does breed. ^

A Preface to the skillfull Musician.
SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit the first fruits
of these my labors to your judicial opinions, then generally to the common
censure of the ignorant: knowing you will favorably conceal or amend what is
amiss and give the r^st their due, (if they shall deserve any thing at all) I
have labored somewhat to imitate the Italian, they being in these days (with
the most) in high request, yet may I not nor cannot forget that I am an English
man. So wishing to you as to my self I end. From Norwich the xxviij. of

What thing can earthly pleasure give,
That breeds delight when it is past?
Or who so quietly does live
But storms of cares do drown at last?
This is the lone of worldly hire,
The more we have the more desire.
Wherefore I hold him best at ease,
That lives content with his estate,
And does not sail in worldly Seas,
Where mine, and thine, do breed debate^
This noble mind even in a Clown,
Is more then to possess a Crown.

Illustriac venerabili viro to: M Thomae Fermor Armigero Norfolciensi.
MVsica vt est musarum prima (generosissime vir) ita eis speciali gratia
indulget summus naturae parens, quibuscum tam coeleste donum communicate, et
quos capit, vera tantae bonitatis dulcedine: Men's enim humana, qua nihil
nobilius, coelum, quo nihil splendidius, elementa, quibus nihil vtilius, arctam
cum ea vendicant assinitatem, cuius vim vt olim mortuos ab inferis reuocasse,
et res non predit as tantum, sed et priuatas sensu miris modis affecisse
legimus, ita nunc vndiquaque cernimus omnes, eam saepissime tristiores ad
gaudia petulantes ad modestiam, impios ad pietatem excitasse. Tentamenta tamen
haec, et prima libamina facultatis meae quaecunque fuerint tibi volui, tum
optime de me merito dedicare, tum Musices studiosissimo censenda committere, vt
et animi in te mei monumentum refer posuerint, et tam sincero, perito et

A Preface to the skillfull Musician.
SInce I am come in the view of the world, I had rather commit the first fruits
of these my labors to your judicial opinions, then generally to the common
censure of the ignorant: knowing you will favorably conceal or amend what is
amiss and give the rest their due, (if they shall deserve any thing at all) I
have labored somewhat to imitate the Italian, they being in these days (with
the most) in high request, yet may I not nor cannot forget that I am an English
man. So wishing to you as to my self I end, From Norwich the xxviij. of
March. 1601.

I. QVINTSV
^ THe love of change has changed the world through- ^ out, ij. and what is
counted good but that is ^ strange, New things wax old, old new all turns a-
bout, all turns a- bout, ^ and all things change, except the love of change,
Yet find I not ^ that love of change, yet find I not that love of change in
me, but as I ^ am, ij. but as I am, So will I always be, so will I always
be, ^ So will I always be, so will I always be, so will I always be, ^
so will I always be.

II. QVINTVS.
^ COntent thy self with thy e- state, seek not to climb ^ above the skies,
not ij. for often love is mixed with hate, ^ ij. and twixt the flowers the
Serpent lies, where ^ Fortune sends her greatest joys, greatest joys, There
once possessed they ^ are but toys. ij. there once pos- sest they ^ are but
toys, where Fortune sends her greatest ioies, greatest ioies, there ^ once
possessed they are but toys. ij. ij.

What thing can earthly pleasure give,
That breeds delight when it is past?
Or who so quietly does live
But storms of cares do drown at last?
This is the lone of worldly hire,
The more we have the more desire.
Wherefore I hold him best at ease,
That lives content with his estate,
And does not sail in worldly Seas,
Where mine, and thine, do breed debate:
This noble mind even in a Clown,
Is more then to possess a Crown.
III. QVINTVS.
^ THe self same thing that gives me cause to ^ die, me cause to die, is
only means for which I life, is only ^ means for which I life de- sire, The
self same could by which as ^ dead I lie, is only means to kindle, to kindle
greater fire, the less I ^ feel my self in hope, in hope to speed, the more
desire this want of ^ hope, the less I feel my self in hope, in hope to
speed, the more de- ^ sire this want of hope, this want of hope does breed. ^

to repress, And mighty ^ hands forget their manlynesse, drawn with the
power, of an heart ^ robbing eye, robbing eye, of an heart robbing eye, robbing

melting plea- saunce mollifye, that can with milting plea- ^ saunce mollifye,

OEtean knight, for his loves ^ sake, his Lions skin vndight, And so did
warlike Antonye neg- ^ lect, And so did warlike Antonye neglect the worlds
whole rule, for ^ Cleopatras sight, such wondrous power, such power, such
wondrous ^ power has women's fair aspect, to captive men, and make the^ all
