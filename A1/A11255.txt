thou tarriest in thy house, and as thou walk by the way, and when thou lie
down, and when thou risest up. Sperando spiro.

Imprented at London, for William Ponsonby. 1583.

To the Church of God, in Walsingham, beloved in Christ, and called to be
Saints: grace, mercy, and the hope of salvation, from God the Father, thorough
Christ Jesus his Son, be multiplied unto you.
AS your place has been before (my brethren) famous* or rather for Idolatry
infamous: non tam nobilis, quam nota, not so noble as notorious: so would I
now, (if I were able) persuade you, to redeem, and purchase a new the loss
of that long time so euilly spent: with the gain of greater knowledge, and more
conscionable practice, in old and young of that glorious Gospel, which now
thorough Gods mercies has driven away ignorance, enlightened your hearts,
beegotten you to GOD, taught you his fear, and whereof you have no farther
hold, then at the Mat. 21. 33.
will of the Lord. If Ephesus must redeem the time spente in the honor of
Diana, and Acts. 19. 28.
dishonor of God, which walking now in the Ephe. 5. 17.
knowledge of his will: what price think you of repentance must Walsingham
lay down, to recover the loss of those days, in the worship of an Idol* and
neglect of Gods service? If Adam be Gene. 3. 17*
curssed, for pleasing his own fancy, and displeasing God: how sharp a
curse think you, deserved that serpent, that first Gene. 3. 4.

Bethel: shall H^eroboam go free, that moved them to sin? If the days of
Josiah must 2. King. 23.
mourn, for the time of his Fathers: what tears must Manasses shed that
caused them to err? And if all places in this land had need to lament the
filthy Idolatries of the former ages: how much more ought thou (
Walsingham) bewail, that have reached forth that Cup of poison to infect
them with all? The brazen Serpent was ( ^. King. 18. 4.
) pouldred to dust, as the instrument of the peoples fall: fear least God in
judgment make thee as dust, which have caused many to slumber in their
sins. The Temple, and house of that Idol Baal was ( ^. King. 10. 27
) broken down, and the Lord in his hoate displeasure made thereof a place of
vile use: thou have been the seat and throne of many Balimes. Fear thou, and
repent: least the Lord in his fiery wrath, make of thy proud shrine of Satan,
a poor and miserable cottage. Thou have shaken the state, and enchaunted the
minds of kings, and princes, with the banefull dregs of men's inventions:
Now nourishe the souls of thy children that are in thee, with that ( Pet. 2.
2.
) sincere milk of Gods holy word: thou have been the puddle to defile
thousands, now become that same Bethesda ( hn. 5. 2.
) to heal thy self: thou have been to England as the waters of ( ^od. 15.
23.
) Marah to Israel, now sweeten thy self with the tree of life: thou have been
to all inhabitants as the unfruitful water of ( Kings. 2. 19.
) Hiericho, now become seasoned with the salt of grace: thou have by thy former
filthiness, drawn many to Hell: repent thee of that, and now let thy ( atth.
5. 16.
) light shine forth, to call many to God. To conclude, thou have been the very
( ^ue. 16. 2.
) foul cage of all hateful and ugly birds: now pray and labor that thou
may become the happy haven, and safe harborough of all godliness, and
integrity of life.

Amen. Thine to do thee good. S. S.

to fall into utter destruction.

Q. What means the condition? As we forgive them that trespass against us.

A. Here we desire, that it may be his pleasure to give us grace that we may
be ready to pardon those that have offended us.

Q. Why do you say? Lead us not into temptation?

A. Here we pray that God will not suffer us to be overcome of temptation: but
that being for our profit or trial, we might boldly be strengthened in him to
abide that which his pleasure is to lay upon us.

Q. Why is this added? For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory for
ever.

A. This does teach us to confess that all rule and authority does come from
God, and rules all things according to his will.

A. Why say thou, Amen, in the latter end of the prayer?

A. By that word I desire the Lord God to grannt all things which before I
prayed for.

Q. Tell me the effect in few words of all that thou have said upon the
Lords Prayer?

A. I desire Gods grace to do his will, and things necessary both to body
and soul.

A Prayer.
THe Lord give us grace to lay these things up deeply in our hearts, and
always to be mindful of them, as it behooves his true and faithful Children
in Christ Jesus. So be it.

FINIS.
