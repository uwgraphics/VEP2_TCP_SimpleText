LO (...) (...) (...) is not my (...)
Nor such as (...) of (...) (...)
But mine intent is only for to write
The mysery of such as live in need
And all their life in idleness does led
Whereby does sue such inco^u^nce
That they must end in meschaunt indygence
Christ in this world right pouerte did sue
Gyuyng us example to follow that degree
Sayng / beati pauperes spiritu
Beati mites / beati mundo oorde
Blyssed be they that poor in spyryte be
And ben clean in heart / and meke therewith all
For they shall possede the realm celestyall
They be not poor that have necessyte
Except therewith they ben right well content
Nor they be not rich that have great plente
If that they think that they have competent
And ever pleased with that god has them sent
For surely it is our lords ordinance
That each should be pleased with suffysaunce
That man that has more than suffycyent
With goods at will / and daily dyth increase
And ever is bare / hungry and indygent
Scrapynge / and ^dgynge / without any cease
Ever coueytynge the mind has no pease
But lives by rapyne and usury
And cares not how he comes thereby
Eke in dystres / doyngno benyfyte
Letyng the poor / dye in great mysery
His neighbor in prison / does not vysyte
Nor yet forgive / small parcel of duty
Weary traueylers / in the streets letly
The deed bodies / without any buryall
His goods / his god / a man may full well call
Of such rich men recyteth the gospel
Making lykenes of impossy bylyte
Saying that more casyly a great Camel
May pass and go through anedyls eye
Than a rich man in heaven for to be
For who so mys uses that god has him sent
with cursed Dives in hell shall be brent.
These tree want beggars begging fro place to place
Nor yet these nedy of all manner facyon
These apprentyces that do ren^e from all grace
These hired servant that keep no condycion
Nor all that feyne parfyt devotion
Nor many other living in need covert
Though they lack good / be not poor of heart.
Seye not daily of all manner estate
How in the law they trauers and coniect
How neighbors do fall at anger and debate
Twene man wife eke the life imperfect
The father and child / from quyetnes abject
And all for good / they make each other smart
Which is a sign they be not poor of heart.
If that our prince do ask a subsedy
From our e^emyes us to defend
Or if our credytours demand their duty
To confess pouerte than we do pretend
But if our neighbor in ought us offend
Than we find money to play overthwart
Which is a token we be not poor at heart
How many poor that have little in store.
Is content with his small substance
But ever they grudge and wysh for more
To be promoted and have furtheraunce
The very beggars for their pytaunce
From bag and staff are loathe for to depart
Which is a token they be not poor at heart
Of these two estates there be four degrees
A rich rich, a poor poor / aryche poor also
A poor rich in all necessytees
The two can agree / but the other no
A proud heart / a beggars purs thereto
The rich purs / and the poor spyryt
May well agree / and be in one parfyt.
Exhortacion of the compyler.
I pray all you, which have enough with grace
For the love of god, to do your charity
And fro the poor, never turn your face
For Christ says, what ever that he be
That to the least of mine, does in the name of me
Unto my self, I do accept the deed
And for reward my realm they shall possede.
Finis.
Here begins the casualyte Of the entrance in to hospytalyte


TO write of Sol in his exaltacyon
Of his solstyce or declynacyon
Or in what sign, planet, or degree
As he in course is used for to be
Scorpio, pisces, or sagyttary
Or when the moon her way does contrary
Or her eclypse / her wane / or yet her full
It were but lost / for blockysh brains dull
But plainly to say / even as the time was
About a fourtenyght after Halowmas
I chanced to come by a certain spyttell
Where I thought best to tarry a little
And under the porche for to take socour
To bide the passing of a stormy shour
For it had snowen / and frosen very strong
With great ysesycles on the eues long
The sharp north wynd hurled bytterly
And with black clouds / darked was the sky
Like as in winter / some days be natural
With frost and rain / and storms over all
So still I stood / as chanced to be
The porter of the house / stood also by me
With whom I reasoned of many diverse things
Touching the course of all such wetherynges
And as we talked / there gatered at the gate
People as me thought / of very poor estate
With bag and staf / both crooked / lame / and blind
Scabby and scuruy / pocke eaten flesh and tynde
Lowly and scalde / and pylled like as apes
With scantly a rag / for to cover their shapes
Brecheles / bare foted / all stynkyng with dyrt
with. M. of tatters / drabblyng to the skyrt
Boys / gyrles / and luskysh strong knaves
Dydderyng and dadderyng / leaning on their staves
Sayng good master / for your moders blyssynge
Give us a halfpeny / toward our lodgyng
The porter said what need you to crave
That in the spyttell shall your lodgyng have
Ye shall be entreated / as ye ought to be
For I am charged / that daily to se
The systers shall do their obseruaunce
As of the house is the due ordinance.
Copland. Porter said I / gods blyssyng and our lady
Have ye for spekyng so curteysly
To these poor folk / and god his soul pardon
That for their sake / made this foundacyon
But sir I pray you / do ye lodge them all
That do ask lodgyng in this hospytall?

Porter. Forsooth yea / we do all such ^olke in take
That do ask lodgyng for our lords sake
And in deed it is our custom and use
Sometime to take in / and some to refuse.

Copland. Than is it common to every wight
How they live all day, to lie here at night
^s losels / mighty beggars / and vacabonds
And tree wands that walk over the londs
Mychers, hedgecrepers / fylloks and luskes
That all the somer kep^ dyches and buskes
Lewtryng and wandryng fro place to place
And will not work / but the bypaths trace
And live with Haws, and hunt the blakbery
And with hedge brekyng make themself merry
But in the winter they draw to the town
And will do nothing / but go up and down
And all for lodgyng that they have here by night
Me thynk that therein ye do no right
Nor all such places of hospytalyte
To confort people of such iniquyte.
But sir I pray you / of your goodness and fauoue
Tell me which yeleaue / and which ye do socour?
For I have seen at sundry hospytalles
That many have lain dead without the walls
And for lack of socour have dyed wretchedly
Unto your (...) on / I think contrary
Much people resort here / and have lodgyng
But yet I marvel greatly of one thing
That in the night so many lodge without?
For in the watch when that we go about
Under the stalles, in porches and in doors
(...) (...) (...) (...) they be thieves or (...)
^ut surely every night there is found
^ne or other ly^ng by the pound
In the sheep cootes / or in the hey loft
And at saint Barthylmews church door full (...)
And even here always by this brycke wall
We do them fyud, that do both ^hyde and ^rall
and like as beasts / together they be throng
Both lame and seek / and hole them among
And in many corners where that we go
(...) and wondre greatly why they do so
But (...) when that they us (...)
(...) do ren^e a great deal faster than we.

Porter. (...) folks be they that we do abject
(...) are not bound to have ^o them aspect
(...) be mychers, that live intre (...)
Hespytalyte (...) them always despise.

Copland. Sir I pray yo^, who has of you (...)


Porter. Forsooth they that be at such myschefe
(...) sor their living can do no labor
And have no friends to do them socout
As old people / seek / and impotent
Poor w^men (...) (...) have here easement
(...) men sore wounded by great vyolence
And sore men eaten with pockes and (...)
And honest folk (...) in great pouerte
By myschaunce or other infyrmyte
Way faryng men, and maimed souldyours
Have their relyef in this poor house of our^
And all other which we seem good and plain
Have here lodgyng for a night or twain
Bedred fo^ke / and such as can not crave
In these places / most relyef they have
And if they hap / within our place to dye
Than are they buried / well and hones^ly
But not every vuseke stoborne knave
For than we should over many have,

Copland. How say you by these common beggars tha^ ^rye
Daily on the world / and in the hye ways lie
At westmynster^ and at saint Poules
And in all streets they sit as desolate souls
Me think it it a very well done deed
With devotion such people to feed

Porter. Where any gives alms with good intent
The reward can not be no wise mysspent

Copland. Ye but sir I will not lie by my soul
As I walked to the church of saint Poule
There sat beggars: on each side the way two
As is seen daily, they be wont to do
Sir one there was, a mighty stoburne slave
That for the other began to beg and crave
Now master, in the way of your good speed
To us all four / behold where it is need
And make this farthyng worth a halfpeny
For the five joys of our blyssed lady
Now turn again for saint Erasmus sake
And on my bare knees here a vow I make
Our ladies psalter three times even now
Now turn again / as god shall turn to you
Now master, do that no man did this day
On yone poor wretch / that rotteh in the way
Now master for him that dyed on tree
Let us not dye for lack of charity
Thus he prated / as he full well can
Till at last an honest seruyng man
(...) by the way / and by compassyon
Of his words / did his devotion
When he was gone a little fro thens
I saw the beggar pull out. xi. pens
Saying to his felaws. se what here is
Many a knave have I called master for this
Let us go dyne / this is a simple day
By master therewith shall I scantly pay
(...) these folks hither good master porter?

Porter. No in sothe / this house is of no such supporter
They have houses / and keep full ill gestyng
And to the resort all the hole ofspryng
(...) Berbycan / and in Turnmyll street
In Houndesdyche / and behynd the Flete
And in twenty places mothan there
Where they make truell and gaudy chere
(...) fill the pot fill / go fill me the can
^ere is my penny / I am a gentylman
(...) there they bid / and fill as does a gull
And when that they have their heads full
^han ^hey fall out / and make reuyiyng
(...) this wise make the dronken rekenyng
Thou beggarly knave, bag nor staf have thou none
But as I am feign daily to lend the one
Thou getest it no more / though it lie and rote
Nor my long cloak / nor my new patched cote
This ru^e make they / every day and night
Till like as swyne they lie slepyng vpryght
Some beggarly churles to whom they resort
Be the maynteners of a great sort
Of mighty lubbers / and have them in seruyc^
Some journey men / and some to their prentyce
And they walk to each market and fair
And to all places where folk do repair
By day on styltes / or stoupyng on crowches
And so dyssymule as falls le (...) ^owches
With bloody clowtes all about their leg
And play sters on their skyn when they go beg
Some countrefayt lepry / and other some
Put soap in their mouth to make it (...)
And fall do wue as saint Cornelys evil
These dysceyts they use wors than euy devil
And when they be in their own company
They be as hole as either you or I
But at the last / wha^ sekenes comes in deed
Than to the spyttell house must they come need

Copland. Ah Jesus mercy / what man coud coniect
The mysery of such a wretched (...)
None honest man, but yet I you hertyly pray
Tell me of other that come these way
Come here any of these maysterles men
That every where do go and ren
That have served the king beyond these
And now that they out of wages be
They must beg / or else go brybe and steal
Me thynk it is a great soul heal
To hel^ them till they were pouruayd
Into some service for if they were arayd
Some of them were propre men and tall
And (...) to go why^ they shall

Porter. That is troth, but they use one ill thing
For they do were (...) clothyng
And so beggyng (...) ^lke over all
For they (...) (...) most in general
(...) (...) abide no laborous subjection
(...) honest persons vader correction
For when they be weary they will (...) a way
And parcha^ carry with them what they may
And so when a man would bring them to thry^
They will him rob / and fro his good him (...)

Copland. Though some so do they do not all so
^or so^ might chance well as many one do.

Porter. That is true / but it has been seen long agone
That many have (...) the wors for one
(...) of these (...) two sorts moo^ comynly
The one of them (...) by open (...)
^gged and lowsy with bag / dysh / and staf
(...) (...) haunteth among such (...) raf
Our time to this (...), another to that
(...) and pochyng to get somewhat
(...) (...) door / lumpes of bread or meat
For (...) the staf in his hand ones catch heat
Than farewell labor / and has such delight
That thryft and (...) fro him is quyte
And in such mysery they live day by day
That of very need they must come this way

Copland. Of the other now what is their estate


Porter. By my faith nyghtyngales of newgate
These ben they that daily walks and (...)
In their hose trussed round to their do dowblett^
And say / good masters of your charity
Help us poor men that come from the se
From the (...) we were cast to land
God it knows as poorly as we stand
And so^ty me they say that they were take in France
And had been there. vii. years in duraunce
In Muttrell / in Breast / in Tourney or (...)
In Morlays / in Cleremount or in (...)
And to their countrees they hau^ (...) to gone
And among them all penny have they none
Now good menues bodies will they say then
For gods sake help to keep us true men
Or else they say they have in prison be
In newgat / the kings benche or marchalse
As many true men take by suspecyon
And were quitte / by proclamacyon
And if any axe what co^ntrey men they be
And like your maystershyp / of the north all three
Or of Chesshyre / or else nygh Cornewale
Or where they list for to gabbe and rail
And may parchaunce the one is of London
The other of york / and the third of Hampton
And thus they lewter in every way and street
In towns and chyrches where as people mete
In lanes and patthes / and at each cross / way
There do they prate / babble lie and pray
But if ye be clenly and happily come alone
your purce and clothing may fortune to be gone
But at no door for bread / drink / nor potage
Nor scoules of meat / nor no such bagage
They none desire / to put in bag nor male
But very white threde / to sewe good ale
And when they have gotten what they may
Than to their lodging / they do take their way
In to some aley / lane / or blind hostry
And to some corner or house of bawdry
Where as (...) solke of their affynyte
Brothelles / and other such as they be
And there they mete / and make their gaudy chere
And put on their clothing and other gere
^heyr (...) and boclers / and their short daggebs
And there they revel as unthrifty braggers
(...) horyble oaths / (...) as they were wood
Arms / nails / wounds / heart soul and blood
(...) / foot / mass / flesh / bones / life / and body
With all other words of blasphemy
Bostyngethem all in deeds of their myschefe
And thus pass the time / (...) dau^ce hoar / pipe thief
The hang man shall led the dance at the end
For noue other ways they do not pret^nde
An^ when that they can get nothing by beggyng
To maynteyne such life they fall to stelyng
And so this way the come at the last
(...) on the galowes make a tomlyng cast

Copland. More pity / to se our own nacyon
For to behave them on such facyon
Surely there is an act of parlyament
That y fony strong vacabond be hent
To be set in a pair of stocks openly
Certain days / with bread and water only
And than to be banysht from town to town
I thynk that act is not yet put down
If it were execute / as to my reason
Men should not se within a little scafon
So many of them / nor idle slouches
And mighty beggars / with their pokes and crouches
But they be mayntened by this noughty sect
That all this land is with them infect
I mean these bawdy brybrous knaves
That lodges them that so powles and shaues
It were alms that they were looked on
For they be wors than any thief or felon
But to our purpose / comes not this way
Of these Rogers? that daily sing and pray
With Au^ regina / or De profundis
Quem terra ponthus / and Stella maris
At every door there they toot and frydge
And say they come fro Oxford or Cambrydge
And be poor scolers / and have no manner thing
Nor also friends, to keep them at lernyng
And so do lewtre only for crust and crum
with staff in hand / and fyst in bosum
Passing time so both day and year
As in their legend I purpose shall appear
An other time after my fantasy

Porter. Such folks of troth comes here daily
And ought of right this house for to use
In their a^ge / for they fully do refuse
The time of virtuous (...)
whereby they should unto honor arise

Copland. Sir yet there is another company
Of the same sect / that live more subtylly
And be in manner as master wardayns
To whom these Rogers obey as capytayns
And be named ^lewners, as I here say

Porter. By my sothe all falls harlots be they
And (...) of people ouerall
In the country most of them find ye shall
They say that they come fro the university
And in the scoles have taken degree
Of preesthod / but friends have they none
To give them any exhybytion
And how that they forth would pass
To their (...) / and sing their first mass
And there pray for their benefactours
And serve god all times and hours
And so they lewtre in such rogacyons
Seven or eight years walkyng their stacyons
And do but gull / and follow beggary
Feynyng true doing by ypocrysy
As another time shall be showed plain
But yet there is of a like manner train
Of falls brybours, deceytfull and fraudelent
That among people call themselfs Sapyent
These ride about in many sundry wise
And in strange array / do themself dysguyse
Sometime in manner of a physycyan
And another time as a hethen man
Countrefaytyng their own tongue and speech
And has a knave that does him englysh teache
With, me non spek englys by my fayt
My servant spek you what me sayt
And makes a manner of strange countenance
With admyracyons his fallnes to auaunce
And when he comes there as he would be
Than will he feyne merueylous grauyte
And so chances his hosts or his host
To demand, out of what strange land or coost
Comes this gentylman: forsothe hostess
This man was borne in hethennesse
Says his servant. and is a connyng man
For all the seven scyences surely he can
And is sure in Physyk and Palmestry
In augury, sothsay^ng, and vysenamy
So that he can right soon espy
If any be dysposed to malady
And therefore can give such a medycyne
That makes all accesses to declyne
But surely if it were known that he
Should meddle with any infyrmyte
Of common people, he might get him hate
And lose the favor of every great estate
Howbeit of charity / yet now and then
He will mynyster his cure on pore men
No money he takes, but all for gods love
Which by chance ye shall se him prove
Than says he / qui speak my hostess
Graund malady make a great excess
Dys infant rumpre (...) (...) (...)
By got he ala mort / tuk under thum
What says he? says the good wife
Nostesse he swereth, by his soul and life
That this child is vexed with a bag
In his stomach, as great as he may wag
So that or two or three days come about
It will choke him withouten dout
But than he says / except ye have his read
This child there with will suddenly be dead
Alas says she / if she love it well
Now sweet may ster / give me your counsel
For gods sake I ask it, and our lady
And here is twenty shyllyngs by and by
Quid est, says he? Forsooth she does offer
Uiginti solid^, pour fournir vostre coffre
To do your help / says this false seruyture
Non point dargent layth he / par deu ie non cure
He will no money / hostess I you prompt
For gods sake / he does it each whyt
Than calls he anon for his casket
That f^antly is worth a rotten basket
And takes out a powdre of experyence
That a carte lode is not worth two pence
And in a paper he does fair fold it up
Fasting three days / he byddeth that to sup
Than for a space he takes license
God wot as yet he paid for none (...)
And so departs and on the next day
One of his felawes will go the same way
To bolster the matter of his false (...)
He sytteth down / and makes good (...)
Which in like wise looks on the child
Saying / that heavenly vyrgyn vndefylde
Our lady Mary, preserne this child now
For it is seek / hostess I tell it you
For or three days / but our lord him save
I ensure you it wylbe in a grave
Good sir says she / alas and weleaway
Here was a gentylman even yesterday
That told the same access and disease
Hostess says he / if that it woid you please
What manner man was it? I pray you tell
Good sir she says / in sothe I know not well
But englysh speech / in deed he can none
And is a Jewe / his man told us echone
Yea was, says he / I know him well in de^
I would I had spoke with him or he ye^.
But hostess, in faith took he any thing
By my troth says she / not one fart^yng
I wot says he / but I marvel that he wol^
But of charity, in such a mean household
Do say so much / for yfgreat estates it knew
His company than would they all eschew
Good sir says she / yet of your gentylnes
Help this poor child, of this said sekene
And hereis. xx. shyllyngs for your pain
And your exspence for a weke or twain
Well hostess says he. I will do more than (...)
For you. but I shall tell you what
For my labor I ask nothing at all
But for the drogges / that occupy he shall
The which be dear / and very precious
And surely I will never out of your house
Till he be hole as either you or I
Than gooth his knave to a town to bye
These drogges that be not worth a torde
And there they lie / at fourtenyght at board
With these good folks / and put them to cost
Both meat and money clearly have they lost
Yet god wot what waste they made and revel
So at the last departs this Iauell
With the money / and straight rydeth he
Where the thief his felaw / and diverse other (...)
And there they prate / and make their auaunt
Of their deceytes / and drynk adieu taunt
As they live / I pray god them amend
Or as they be / to bring them to an end
For the spyttell is not for their estate
Howbeit they come daily by the gate

Copland. A shrewd sort by our lady / and a comberous
Jesus keep them out of every good man's house
But comes any pardoners this way?

Porter. Yea sir, they be our proctours / and fayn they may
Chyrs^y sith their falls popery was known
And their bullysh indulgence overthrown
They be all naught / reken each with other
Subtilte is their father / and falshod their mother
For by l^ttres they name them as they be
P. (...) pardoner. Clewner a. C.
B. a Roger. A an Iurium / and a Sapyent. S.
Thus they know each other doubtless
But when their iuggelyng oores do fail
They ren^e ashore / and here stryke sail

Copland. By my sothe I am weary to here of their living
Wherefore I pray you / if ye be pleasyng
Tell me shortly of all folk in general
That come the hye way to the hospytall

Porter. IT is tedyous / but for your mind
As nigh as I can / I will show the kynds
Of every sort / and which by lykelynes
To the spyttell his way does adres
But as for order I promise none to keep
For they do come as they were scattered sheep
Wandryng without reason / rule / or guide
And for other lodgyng do not provide
But to our purpose. there comes in this vyage
They that toward god have no courage
And to his word give none aduertence
Eke to father and mother do not reverence
They that despise folk in aduersyte
They that seek strife and iniquyte
They that for themself do keep nothing
And such as hate other in their well doing
They may be sure or ever they dye
Lest they lack lodgyng here for to lie.
Priests and clerks that live vycyously
Not caryng how they should do their duty
Unruly of manners / and slack in lernyng
Ever at the alehous for to sit bybyng
Neglectyng the obedyence to them dew
And unto Christ's flock take none auew
But like as wolves that rauysh the fold
These people do this right way hold
young heirs that enjoy their heritage
Rulyng themself / or they come to aege
Occupyeng unthrifty company
Spendyng up their patrimony
Whiles they be young, and use dyssolute plays
Of very need they must come these ways
All such people as have little to spend
Wastyng it, till it be at an end
And when they be seek / and have nothing
Toward the spyttell than they be coming
They that have small lands and tenements
wearyng daily costly garments
That at the last they must be feign
To sell their rentes / themself to sustain
Which is a token of very experyence
This way for to come by consequence
Bayllyfs, stuardes, caters, and renters
Pay masters, credytours, and receyuers
That beneclygent to make rekenyngs
Delyueryng and trustyng without wrytyngs
Uncaryng for to ren^e in ar^rage
By this way they must need make passage
Landlordes that do no reparacyons
But leave their lands in desolacyons'
Their housyng unkept wynd and water tyght
Letyng the pryncypals rot down right
And suffers their tenauntes to run away
The way to our house we can them not denay
They that sew / in the court daily
For little business and spends largely
With great gifts and yet their labor lost
This way they come to seek for their cost
Fermours and other husbandmen that be
In great fermes / and does not over se
Their housbondry / but leteth their corn rote
Their hey to must / their sheep dye in the cot^
Their land vntyld / vndunged / and vnsowen
Their meadows not defenced and vnmowen
Their fruit to perysh / hangyng on the trees
Their catell scater / and lose their honey bees
All young heirs borne in a rich estate
And would live still after the same rate
Being young brethren of small possybylyte
Not having where with to mayntene such degr^
But make shyftes / and borow ouerall
Such trace prison to be their hospytall
Selfwylled people that can not be in rest
But in the law do ever wrythe and wrest
And will not fall to any agreement
Till in their necks is laid by Jugement
The costs and charges / and so are made full bare
Lodgyng for such folk we do ever spare
People that always will be at dystaunce
And on their neighbors euertake vengeance
Being auengyng on every small wrong
From this way they cannot be long
They that will meddle in every man's matter
And of other folks deeds does always clatter
Mayntenyng their own saying to be true
And is no^ believed / they can not eschew
But they must needs come hytherward
For by much medlyng their credence is mard
Marchaunts that beyond the sea bye dear
And lend it good chepe when they be here
And be never paid / but by the law
Her^ have no beddyng / but lie on the straw
They that sell good cheap in despyte
L^tyng all their gaynes for to go quyt^
Byeng ware dear / and s^ll for a little
They be very gestes to lie in our spyttell
Crafts men that do work day and night
Having great charge and their gaynes light
Wastyng their tools / and can them not renew
Full well may say / farewell good thryft adieu
He that wynneth much / and when he has done
with waste and games spends it soon
Leauyng not wherewith again to begin
In this hye way he hastes to ryn
He that has a good occupacyon
And will live on the courtly facyon
(...)
Wenyng for to live more ^asyly
Sometime does make an unthrifty change
With bag and staf in our park to raunge
Rufflers / and masterles men that can not work
And slepeth by day / and walks in the derke
And with delycates / gladly does feed
Swerynge and crakynge an easy life to lead
With common women daily for to haunt
Making revel and drink a dieu taunt
Saying make we merry as long as we can
And drink a pace / the d^uyll pay the malt man
Wine was not made for every haskerde
But bear and ale / for every dasterde
And when their money is gone and spent
Than this way is most conuenyent
Tauerners that keep bawdry and pollyng
Marryng wine with brewyng and rollyng
Inholders that lodge hoores an^ thieves
Seldon their getyng any way preues
So by reason / their gayues be geason
This way they ren^e many a season
Bakers and brewers / that with musty grain
Serve their customers, must take it again
And many times have they no vtteraun^
For their weight and measure is of no substance
And lose both their credence and good
Come this way by all lykelyhood
For they do infect that should be man's food.
^
And will pay more than they of right be set
for to be named a man (...)
And in manner he has (...) at all
Such folly (...) facers when their good is spent
To the spyttell ward they run incontinent
young folk that wedde or they be wise
And always charges on their haud does rise
House rent and chyloren / and every other thing
And can do nothing for to get their iyuyng
And have no friends them for to sustain
To com this way / at last they must be feign
They that sell away all their rentes and lands
And bestows it for to be merchandes
And auentreth till then have all lost
And turmoyleth always fro pyler to post
And ever leseth all that they go about
Comes this way among the other rout
They that in hope to have their friends dye
Will do nothing / but live wantonly
Trust ynge to have the treasour that is left
But many times it is them bereft
And have nothing and nothing can do
Such come this way with other to
They that does to other folks good deed
And has themself of other folk more need
And quenches the fire of another place
And leueth his own, that is in wors ca^e
When it is (...) and (...) not where to (...)
To the spyttell than must he needs hye
They that will not suffer their clothe hole
But iag and cut them with many a hole
And pays more for making than it cost
When it is made / the garment is but lost
Patchyng them with colors like a fool
At last they be ruled after our scole
They that do make to much of their wives
Suffryng them to be naught of their lives
Letyng them have ouermoche of their will
Clothyng them better than they can fulfill
Letyng them go to feestes / daunces / and plays
To every brydale / and do nothing on days
And gives them all the soueraynte
Must needs come this way / for they cannot pthe

Copland. Come hither any of these woeful creatures
That besore wounded / and much woe endures
With a shrewd wife / and is never quiet
Because that she would have all her diet
But bralle and ^hyde / babble / cry and fight
Ever discontented both day and night

Porter. C^ine this way quod a: yes I warraunt you
Of them always come this way ynow
We have chambres purposely for them
Or else they should be lodged in Bedlem

Copland. Mary god forbid it should be as ye tell


Porter. By good faith, the very devil of hell
I trow to my mind has not much more pain
One were in a manner as good be slain
For there is no idye / but ever anguysh
On both sides they do always languysh
For the one gooth hither, and the other thither
Both they spend, and ly nothing together
So at the last of very necessyte
Hither they come / to ask lodgyng of me

Copland. I do know it is the right facyon
A realm stryuyng in it self gooth to desolacyon
God amend all / I have herd what it is
Tell of some other / I am weary of this

Porter. Ill masters that let their servant play
Fedyng them deyntyly every day
And does cloth and pay them as they should be
Being ne^lygent their work to ouerse
Suffryng them waste / and their good spyll
In their presence to do their lewd will
And all those that pay not their hyre
Uengeaunce of god it does desire
Th^se on both parts do each other wrong
This way they come with a great throng
All such servant as be neclygent
In their service / and wylnot be content
To do their werk / but slack their besynes
Brybe and convey fro master and maystres
Chaungyng masters, and ren fro town to town
And are late rysyng / and betyme lie down
Playeng by night / and try (...) by day
Of ryghtousnes they do here stay
Such folk as take on them great rent
In soyles for them inconueny ent
Unto their faculte, and often do remeue
Entreprysyng that they cannot acheue
Doing curyous labors, and have small wage
Unto our house they come for hostage
They that borow on their garments and (...)
And do not fetch them again shortly
But let them be worn / and than pay the som^e
In to our hye way they be far com^e.
They that borow, and purpose not to pay
Tyll^n prison they spend all away
And do forswere that is their dew
They that law for a debt untrue
And receives money in another man's name
Not being content to restore the same
They that forget that to them is ought
They that strive with all folk for (...)
And they that lend / and set no time to pay
Reason will drive them to come this way
Old folks that all their goods do give
Keeping nothing whereon to live
And put fro their house when they have need
Toward our house fast do they speed
They that give children money to spend
And causes (...) (...) at they (...) attend
But does (...) them in their lewdnes
And f^o syne will them not (...)
In idle (...) (...) them to be
Nor teach them virtuous faculte
Are the cause that wha^ they be old
To take the way toward our household
They that evermore have a delight
To feed, and make feasts at their appeiyte
With costly dysshes, and deynty drink
Letyng their stock evermore shrynke
Making a great port, and be little worth
To come hither they come straight forth
They that take no head to their household
But let their implements molde
Their hangyngs rot, their napery unclean
Their furs and woollen not ouersene
Their vessel mar / and their goods decay
Cannot choose / but needs come this way
Lechours / for^ycatours / and aduouterers
Incestes / harlots / bawdes / and bolsterers
Applesquyers / entycers / and rauysshers
These to our place have daily herbegers

Copland. No marvel of them / and happy they be
If they do end in so honest degree
For surely their endyng is fairest
If that with pouerte they be (...)
For I do find written of aduoutry
That these five sorrows ensues thereby
(...) (...) patietur quisquis (...)
Aut erit hic pauper / hic aut subito morietur
Aut aliquod (...) casu vulnere perdet
Aut erit infamis / per quod sit carcere vinctus.
Either they shall be poor / or dye suddenly
Or lose by wound / some membre of the body
Or to be s^launored to suffer sharp prison
Therefore pouerte is fairest by reason
And yet beside that / they be so beaten
That with great pockes their lymmes be eaten
Now say ye by these horrible swerers
These blasphemers / and these god terers
Come there any this way to have socour?

Porter. Do they? yea / I warraunt every hour
All rotten and torn / arms, heads, and legs
They are the most sort that any where begges
And be the people that most anoy us.

Copland. I believe well, for I find wrytenthus

^ir multu^ iurans replebitur iniquitate, and a do: moeius non recedet plaga.
(...), xxii.

A great swerer is full of iniquyte
And fro his house the plage shall never be
In the commandments is written plain
Thou shall not take the name of god in vayn
For who sow does use it customably
The stroke of god can not eschew truly.
That be so (...) (...) (...) and lyther
That care not how the world does go
Neither halydays / nor workyng days also
But lie in bed till all masses be done
Lew^ryng their work till it pas noone
And so enjoy to linger and to sleep
And to their living they take no manner keep
Porter. These folks come in so great nombre
That all the ways they do encombre
And with them does come all these folk that spare
To assay their friends for their d^vne welfare
But follow their own minds always
Nor to their fr^ndes in no wise will obey
And of their promesses / they be no more set by
But to this way they must them needs apply

Copland. And how by these people so full of coueytyse
That all the worlds good can them not suffyse
But by usury / rapyne / and extorcyon
Do poull^ the pore folk of their porcyon
And they that (...) news by tyranny
Upon poor men's lands fraudelently
And like as wolves the sheep does take and tease
For their own lucre / and to live in ease
And day by day / in every (...) degree
They do prolonge their (...)

Porter. As for with them we have to do nothing
Unto the law it is all be longyng
Now be it if they chance to be poor
Then often in deed they do come by our door

Copland. But then I pray you how say ye by these
That break this precept (Non furtum facies)
Thieves and murderers / and these watchers of ways
That rob and steal / both by nights and days
And that delight in murder and in theft
Whose condycyons in no wise can be left
Do not they often times come hither by you?

Porter. Of them there comes daily ynow
But they be led / and comenly fast bound
Because their lodgyng may sooner be found
And ben conveyed by men of charity
Where that they have hospytalyte
And ben well kept / and wrapped surely
And when time comes that they must dye
They be buried aloft in the air
Because dogs shall not on their graves repair.

Copland. Almighty Jesus of his mercy defend
Every good man's child from such and end
And how say ye by all these great dronkardes
That suppe all of / by pottes and tankardes
Till they ^e so drunk / that they can not ^rande
That is but (...) used in this land
Except it be among duche folk or flemynges
For english men know not of such reke^inges

Porter. No do: yes yes. I ensure you hardely
They can do it as well as any body
With dowble bear / be it wine or ale
They ceas not (...) (...) (...) (...) (...)
With (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...)
An ortkyn / or an half (...) (...) (...) (...)
yea rather than fail (...) (...) (...)
With fill the pot ones again round about
Give us more drink / for sparyng of bread
Till their cappes be wyser than their head
And so sit they / and spend up all their thryft
And after come here / they have no other (...)

Copland. How say ye by these folks full of ire
That bren^e in wrath / hoter than fire
And never be quiet / but chyde and brall
With wrath and anger fretyng heart and gall
Way ward / wode / furyous / and fell
For where they be / quyetnes cannot dwell
But always strife / mystrust / and great disease
And in no wise none man can them please

Porter. Hither they come / and I will tell you why
None can live by the^ / well nor quyetly
But with each one they fall out and make bate
Causyng people them for to hare
And will suffer them to dwell nowhere
But are feign for to remain here

Copland. It may well be so, for where is none agree
Neither (...) nor welfare cannot be
But I (...) it be not between man and wife
(...) it (...) pity / and (...) a sorry life
For (...) is no peace at bed nor at board
I (...) their thryft is not worth a torde
But of these people that (...) so (...)
That in wealth and woe bear it so out
That pride will not suffer them for to fall
Me think this way they come not all

Porter. O yes yes / god wot of them be not few
For here all day they assemble in a rewe
And here they crake / babble and make great boste
And among all other would rule the ro^te
With stand back you lewd vylayne beggarly knave
I will that thou know my wife and I have
Spent more in a day with good honest
Than thou in thy life ever was like to be
For I tell the I have kept or now such report
That all my neyghtbours did to me resort
And have or now kept a great household
And had enough of silver / and of gold
In all our parysshe was none better decked
And I think (...) for to be thus checked
Of such lewd persons that never had good
And eke I am borne of as good a blood
As any in this town / and a gentylman
But if I had as much as I wist when
I should make a meyny of these poor carles to know
What manner thing a gentylman is I trow

Copland. Lo here one may se that there is none wors
Than is a proud heart and a beggars purs
Great boost and small roost / this is (...)
For a proudo heart well never be shent
But good porter I pray you be so kind
To tell me of them out of mind
As for the enuyous I let them dwell
For their hospytall is the deep pyt of hell

Porter. How say ye by this lewd Ipocrysy?
That is used so superstycyously
I cry god mercy if I make any lie
Of them that devout prayers se me to occupy
As if god fro the cross by them should be undone
And sit in the church till it be noone
Never speaking in any folks presence
But it sounds to virtue and reverence
Yet when they be moeued to anger and wrath
(...) we to my mind / that other folk has
Not half the spyte, vengeance and rygour
As they will have to their poor neighbor
For some of them / if they might be a lord
Would hang another / they be of such dyscorde
And where they ones take hatred or enmyte
During their life have never charity
And who that has no charity nor love
Can never please the amyte above
And so this way they be feign to come.

Copland. I believe well / for truly there be some
That neither have love to one nor other
For I beneyfit if it were sister or brother
They would no more pity them nor rewe
(They be so fell) / than on a thief or Jewe
For when ye to have them most in reason
(...) their hertes full of deadly poison
(...) in their fury they be so vyolent
That they will bring one to an exegent.
And never pardon / nor no man forgive
Till their neighbor has nothing on to live
And so they make by their own consyence
Between god and the devil no dyffrence
But hey alas / do none this way trace
That (...) take wives of small (...)
Which cannot get / bestow / nor yet save
And to go gay they will spend and crave
Making men (...) that they love them alone
(...) (...) falls unto them echone
(...) their goods without any care
Without good gowns / but not of hoodes (...)

Porter. They must come hither / for they cannot choose
For they that will them self so use
The one to (...) / and the other spend
And when all is brought to an end
(...) they come to have conforte
Sir I beshrew all the hole sort
Such (...) keeps many one low
Their husbands must obey as dog to bow
Alas (...) men^ye are ill at ease
These deynty huswyues for to feed and please
For so they sit and sew half an hour on a clout
Their hole days work is patched out
And so by their (...) and living naught
With other means they be hither brought

Copland. Well good porter / I pray you let them alone
Fyr happy is he that has a good one
I pray you show me of other gestes
For against women I love no iestes
the shower is (...) (...) / and I have fer to go
Come none of these pedlers this way also
With pak on bak / with their bousy speech
Iagged and ragged / with broken hose and breche

Poster. I now, ynow / with bousy coue maund nace
Coure the patryng coue in the darkman case
Docked the dell for a coper meke
His watch shall feng a prounces nobchete
Cyarum by salmon / and thou shall pek my iere
In thy gan-for my watch it is nace gere
For the b^ne bouse / my watch has a wyn
And thus they babble till their thryft is thyn
I wot not what / with their pedlyng french
But of the spyttle / they have a party stenche
And with them comes gaderers of cony skynnes
That chop with laces / points / nedles / and pyns

Copland. Come any maryners hither of Cok lorels bote


Porter. Every day they be always a flote
We must them receive / and give them costs fre
And also with them the fraternity
Of vnthryf^es / which do our house endewe
And never fail with brethren always new
Also here is kept / and holden in degree
With in our house the ordres. viii. time three
Of knaves only / we can them not keep out
They swarm so thyke as bees in arout
And chyef of all that does us encombre
The order of fools / that be without nombre
For daily they make such preas and cry
That scant our house (...) (...) (...)

Copland yet one thing I wonder that ye do not tell
Come there no women this way to dwell?

Porter. Of all the sorts that be spoken of before
I warraunt women ynow^n store
That we are weary of them every day
They come so thycke that they stop the way
The systerhod of drabbes / sluttes and callets
Do here resort / with their bags and wallets
And be parteners of the confrary
Of the maynteners of ill husbandry

Copland. Alewd sort is of them of a surety
Now master porter / I thank you hertyly
Of your good talkyng / I must take my leave
The shoure is done / and it is toward eve
Another time / and at more leaser
I will for you do as great a pleaser

Porter. There be a. M. mo than I can tell
But at this time I bid you farewell.

Lenuoy of the auctour.
_^O little quayre to every degree
And on thy matter desire them to look
Desyryng them for to pardon me
That am so bold to put them in my book
To eschew vice, I the undertook

I were to blame y^ I (...) forsook
None in this world or wel^h can be sure.
