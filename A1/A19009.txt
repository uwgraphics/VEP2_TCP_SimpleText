A pleasant new Dialogue: OR, The discourse between the Serving-man and the
Husbandman.
The lofty pride must bated be,
And praise must go in right degree.
To the tune of, I have for all good wives a Song.


AS I went through the meddowes green,
that are most lovely to be seen,
I heard two men in great discourse
o many things better or worse:
The one a Serving-man, and he
stood much upon his bravery:
The other was a Husbandman,
which no man speak against him can.
The Serving-mans speech.
I am a Serving-man that is fine,
and feed on dainties, and drink wine,
I am for Ladies company,
who can have pleasures more than I?
I have the love of Maidens fair,
that are their Parents only heir,
Although they go in garments gay,
with me they will yield to sport and play.
The Plough-man.
Though you in garments go most brade,
yet you must yield to what I crave,
No serving-man shall make me yield,
I Will show the cause whereon I build.
A Servingman cannot come nie
to that which I will verify:
A young Serving-man may compare
to be an old beggar man's heir.
The Serving-man.
I wait on Ladies, Lords, and Knights,
where pleasure flows with much delights,
My time I spend with Venus Nymphs,
whose features rare desire attempts.
We Serving-men have pleasure at will:
and Plough-men they have labor still,
Then how can they with us compare,
seeing we have pleasure, and they have care?
The Plough-man.
Though you in pleasure do exceed,
who is it that does serve your need?
You might go pine and starve with want,
then at a Plough man do not tant.
We till the ground which brings increase:
and all would lack if we should cease.
Such bragging Ia^^s might do full ill,
then to a Plough-man yield thee skill.
The Serving-man.
Our parell many times is silk,
our shirts as white as any milk,
Our fare is of the very best,
and that which is most neatly dressed,
And often when we sup or dine,
we taste a dainty cup of wine:
Our Masters Cellars yield good beer,
and in his Hall we find good cheer.
The Plough-man.
It Is true: there many goes in silk,
and have their linen white as milk,
And yet perhaps not worth a groat,
but much like you, will lie and prate:
The Proverb of a Serving-man,
as always I do understand.
In prime of years he will roar and swagger,
and being grown old he turns a beggar.
The Serving-man.
Why should a Plough-man me deface,
and urge me with such foul disgrace*
I dare to challenge you sir fool,
to meet me at the Fencing-schoole:
I will not so out-braved be,
nor rank with such base pedigree,
I am a man of courage bold,
by Plough-men I Will not be controlled,
The second part.
To the same Tune.


The Plough-man.
INdeed you are of perfect mettle,
your nose shines like a copper kettle,
It Is true you are of courage bold,
the pipe and pot you will uphold,
You hold it rare to drink and smoke,
all this is true which I have spoke:
But it is a Husbandmans delight,
to work all day and sleep all night.
The Serving-man.
We have no labor toil and care,
we Serving-men no drudges are,
Our care is for the chiefest pleasure,
which seems to us a daily treasure:
My Ladies Waiting-maid most fine,
with us does often sup and dine,
Sometimes a courtesy we crave,
a kiss or so, and this we have.
The Plough-man.
If you the Proverb truly mark,
Ioan^ is as good as my Lady in'th dark,
A Country Less in russet gray,
with her I love to sport and play:
O she will dance and sweetly sing,
much like the Nightingale in Spring.
She Is fresh and fair, and firm and sound.
in her much pleasure may be found.
The Serving-man.
Well Countrie-man my mind is brave,
I will not yield to what you crave:
No Plough man ere shall make me yield,
I will not so much be compeld:
My youthful days yields me much joys,
my nights I pass with merry toys:
My time is pleasure and delight,
which I do spend with Ladies bright.
The Plough-man.
O hold thy peace, thy fond delight
does pass away like day or night.
Thy aged head appearing gray,
then does thy pleasure soon decay,
Then from thy service must thou pack,
and all things quickly will thou lack:
Then warning take ere it be long,
and learn to work while thou art young
The Serving man.
Why should I labor, toil, or care,
since I am fed with dainty fare?
My Gelding I have for to ride,
my cloak my good sword by my side,
My boots and spurs shining like gold,
like those whose names are high inrold:
What pleasure more can any crave,
then such content as I now have?
The Plough-man.
It Is true indeed, thy pleasure's great,
and I have what I get by sweat,
My labor gives my heart content,
and I do live in merriment.
He that true labor takes in hand,
does far surpass the Serving-man,
He passes some with house and lands,
when that decays, he cries, Help hands.
The Serving-man.
Thy reasons I have understood.
and what thou speak is very good.
I would I were a Plough man now,
and labor could at Cart and Plough,
Then would I work and till the land,
and never more be Serving man,
For what they have is truly got,
they are contented with their lot.
Thus to conclude and make an end,
let none with Husbandmen contend:
You see here yields a lofty mind,
and to good counsel is inclined.
Thus will we all like lovers gree,
the painful man shall p^^ised be,
For by the labor of the hand,
we do receive fruits from the land.
