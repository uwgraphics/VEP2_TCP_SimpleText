Here begins the orcharde of Syon / in the which is contained the
reuelacyons of saint Katheryne of Seen / with ghostly fruytes and precious
plants for the health of man's soul.

Ecce ancilla domini.


The prologue.
Marcus Cinilis (a Bryxian) writes an Epistle in latin to a devout fader /
Friar Paul Sauche / an Aragon / obseruaunt of ye fcere prechers / in to the
commendacyon of the dyalogys or reuelacyons of ye blessed vyrgyn saint
Katheryne of Seen / of ye which Epistle in sentence / here follows part /
translated i^ to english.
Among many ylles of them that be professed to crystes rely^y on / one there
is far out of of the way of health that we were in stytute in / and greatly
to be reproved. That men now a days (and that relygyous) do not regard those
holy works / rules / and doctrynes / that be necessary to their ghostly health
/ but take the^ in vain and as things of no valor / which they ought
dylygently to look upon / and to apply the^ both night and day to work and
live after the same. And those that be vain and superfluus / little savor
having of ye sweet name and love of Ihesu christ / smally condusynge to health
of souls / be much set by and desired / daily had in hand as things much
beloved. Doubtelesse it is a great ^efaute and a deedly blyndenesse of mind.
if they would learn and follow those techynges / whereby the soul and the mind
might be lyghtned to spyryall and heavenly things / atte^dynge and lokynge to
their end that they be ordained unto / they should full besyly search and look
what way and means should conduce them to it / and follow ye same. But no man
desires greatly that good thing / nor excheweth that ill / that he has no
knowledge of. who is so froward and unkind unto himself / that if he knew
that heavenly Jerusalem and the joy therein (but only after the manner / as the
charity of god has showed it unto our weyke understanding / by his own
words / and by the doctrine of holy seyntes) And again ward if he would sadly
ponder those ylles that be prepared for the^ that shall be exyled fro thens /
would he not lose himself from all erthely affeccyons / and full fast run
unto it / and all things contrary and le^tynge / exchewe as death / as truly
they be much worse tha^ death i^ deed. This have I thought always / but than
most specially and appeared manifest unto me / when I took on hand to read the
dyaloges of the holy vyrgyn saint Katheryne of Seen / a meruaylous myrtour of
holiness. Whom our sauyoure Ihesu chose unto his spouse / and induced her
with many graces / after a synguler manner. And for her most fervent love /
profounde meekness / meruaylous pacyence / and wonderful compassyon yt she
had / he impressed in her body the pryntes of his wounds / and preserved her
long time in this life / without bodyly sustenaunce. Pope Pius the secunde /
and Raymundus with diverse other holy men / beside the cronyculers / testyfy her
holiness / and write great books of her life / and the acts that she has
done / greatly to the edyfyenge of crystes church. O meruaylous goodness of
god / that has chosen so weyke a parson of woman kind / to confound the
great men of might and all their pusaunce. what techynges be there set
furthe: to compounde and order the manners of men? what precepts be there given
to chastyce and subdewe the bodyly affeccyons? what counseyles have we there
showed / to keep us under the bonds of reason? No where can man more
pleasauntly be alle^ and drawn to the love of god. No where more terryble can
he be made afered to committee sin. No where more profou^dely the truth is
showed without error / nor the dygnyte of virtue more clearly opened / and ye
abhomynacyon of vice more openly dyscouered. There is the rule and learning of
chastyte and clennesse to be conserved. There is gadered together compendyously:
dyscyplyne of lowlynesse / and virtue to be noryshed and incresced. There be
opened secret counseyles of god. There is showed the excellency of his
prouyde^ce. There to them that be blind by malice or ygnoraunce / is restored
the light of truth. And to them that have knowledge of truth / it is there
preserved for to defend errors. There to them that be curyous in reasonynge /
it is answered and satysfyed to their arguments. To the^ that be good and wise
/ is showed things worthy their knowledge. And truly it is so plentefully / so
holsomely / so holyly / provided all manner ways / for man's pilgrimage here
in this life / that (after my Judgment) there can no erthely creature
counseyle or provide more wisely for ye health of man / nor more surely. Nor no
marvel / for very often (and in manner when she would) she was rauyshed in
spyryte unto god / and so she was acustomed in ecstasy to have reuelacyo^s and
dyologes between christ and her / and after to endyte them. Wherefore I will not
fere to say and affirm this / that there is no man of so paruerse and
obstynate malice / but if he look upon the^ with good auysement not hastily nor
enuyously) not only parceyuynge ye words with his eres outwardely / but also
the sense with his mind inwardely he shall not repent him / but find great
grace thereby / and pleasure in his soul. Who should not be greatly moved
meruaylynge much / such a young maid of tender age / to be like in learning
to noble clerks / and to w^yte so profounde sentences / so depely draw fro ye
well of the hye dyuyne wisdom / that it is hard for many to parceyue /
except they have meke learning and ghostly wisdom. So though that her
glorious and excellent holiness should give none auctoryte to her doctrine
and precepts / yet from what soever condyte they come out of / they bear
most sure testymony of themself without doubt / that they flow out fro none
other / but fro the godly funtayne and spring of grace. Nor they have none
other begin nynge but that (where unto) they enforce besyly to bring the reder
unto / which is god himself. The bryghtnesse of ye son / can proceed from
none other thing / but from the son. So heavenly things come not / but from
heaven. And that thing yt belongs to god / himself only does know / and
they whom it pleases hy^ to show it unto. Therefore all you yt be lovers of
your own health (and not only you) but only al you yt have little feythe
and affection to heavenly things / you that be ylecte and snarled in the
dysceyuable pleasures and lusts of the flesh and the world. if you covet to
have eternal Joy / come hyder and fill the vessels of your hertes at this
well / with ye water of wholesome doctrine. Feed you here with the sweet meet of
ghostly counsayll yt comes fro heaven. He that lacks this ghostly sight /
here may receive light. He that is in sorrow or heaviness / here may have
comfort and consolacyo^. He that is weary / here may take rest. He yt is dull
and slow / shall be quyckened and made dylygent. He yt is weyke / here may
receive strength. He yt is rude and unlearned / may get here lerny^ge and
holy manners. And more over he yt has good sight in lerny^ge / a quiet my^de /
and is strong / constant / and virtuous / if he dry^ke of this well / it shall
not help only to enorme hy^ and preserve hy^ therein / but also it shall
enlarge and increase hy^ in all goodness. I any man think yt I say or
promise other wise than it is in deed / let hy^ look well upon this work / and
compare my sayenges unto it / and if he find not yt I have said much less
for the matter (than I ought to do) let hy^ take me for a babbeler / and point
me with his finger / as a man of no fydelyte. Let no man dysdayne it or set
less by it / by reason of the rude style / or of the simple translacyon / for
he yt translated it / intended more ye eloquence of manners tha^ of words. The
eloquence of good life ought not to be contempned nor hated for lack of
eloquent speech. This book is not ordained for to delight and please the eeres
and the outward senses / but to instruct the soul / and to comfort the
inward senses. It conteyneth no precepts of eloquence / but it is full of
heavenly speech and of virtuous doctrine. Therefore let not ye little bytternesse
of the outward husk / keep you fro ye plesaunt tastynge of ye sweet kernel
within (that is) let not the symplenesse of the style / nor labor of redynge:
keep you fro the sweet doctrine and ghostly comfort yt ye may have in this
book / which promyseth truth and shows it clearly. It she with heavenly
things and brings the^ forth habu^dantly. It grau^teth eternal Joy / to
all the^ yt will work after it parseuerantly. which our lord grant us to
do (In whom) all ye reders / fare ye well.

Another prologue.
RElygyous mother and devout sustren / called and chosen bes^^y to labor at
the house of Syon / in the blessed vyneyerde of our holy sauyoure / his parfyte
rule which himself endyted / to keep co^tynually unto our lives end / under
the governance of our blessed lady / her service only to read and to sing /
as her special servants and doughtren. And she your most sovereign lady
and chese Abbes of her holy covent / I sinful unworthy to bear any name to the
worship of that holy saueoure / and at the reverence of his glorious mother / to
your ghostly recreacyon / with help of your prays (compelled by charity)
for ghostly affeceycyon / purpose to write to you after my simple selynge / the
relelacyons of our lord to his chosen maid Katheryne of Seen / this book of
reuelacyons (as for your ghostly comfort) to you I call it a fructyferous
orcharde. This orcharde by gods grace / my will is to deupde in to seven
parts / and each part in to five chapyters / as ye may se and read in the
calendar following. In this orcharde when ye will be conforted / ye may walk
and se both fruytes and herbs / and all be it yt some fruytes or herbs seem
to some sharp / hard or bitter / yet to purgynge of ye ^oule they be full
spedefull and profitable / when they be dyscretely take and received by
counseyle. Therefore relygyous sustren / in this ghostly orcharde at reasonable
time ordained / I will that you dysporte you and walk about where you will
with your mind and reason / in what alaye you like / and namely there ye
fauouren best / as ye be dysposed. You may chose of.xxxv. aleys in which you
will walk (that is to say) of.xxxv. chapyters / one time i^ one / another
time in another / but first my counsel is / clearly to assaye and search the
hole orcharde / and taste of such fruit and herbs reasonable after your
affection and what you lyketh be / afterward chewe it well and ete thereof
for health of your soul. And now sustren I cease^ of this prologue / and in
the manner of a calendar here I will show unto you / the ordinance of this
orcharde / in time coming by gods grace / as it pleases hy^ of his mercy to
grant me bodyly hele and time of life / to plate it and set it with such
fruytes and herbs / as our lord showed to the foresaid maid in her
contemplacyon / when her body was rauyshed fro all bodyly feeling / as
witnesses her clerks and all her dyscyples. And for as much as I said
before that this book should be de^pded in to.vii. parts / and each part in
to.v. chapyters. Here therefore I begy^nne the calendar / and comme^de me to
your prayers.

The chapyters of the first part.
Capitulum primum.
THe first chapyter of this first part / shows how ye soul of this maid
is one^ to god / and how when that soul was lytte up in to co^templacyon: made
four petycyons to our lord. Also how the desire of this soul increased /
while the necessyte of the world was showed to her of our lord. Also how ye
works of a man in ye world suffyse not to punysshe his sin i^ purgatory /
nor to be rewarded in bliss / without contynuall affection of charity. Also
how desire and contrycyon of a man's heart makes satysfaccyon for his sin
and for the pain of his sin / when he trauayleth for his own soul and for
all other men's souls / and sometime it makes satysfaccyon for the sin /
and not for the pain.

Ca. ij.
THe secunde chapyter is how each virtue and defaute is by some manner or mean
of a man's neighbor. Also how virtues be wroughte in man by some mean of his
neighbor. Also why there is somoche dyffere^ce in virtues the which be put
in creatures. Also how virtues be proved and stre^gthed of their contraryes.

Ca. iij.
THe third chapyter treats of the virtue of dyscrecyon / and first how a
soul shall not put his affeccyo^ nor effectual workynge in penance
pryncypally / but in virtues / and how dyscrecyon comes of meekness / and how
dyscrecyon yeldeth to each creature that lo^geth to him. Also our lord god
shows here a symplytude / how that charity / meekness / and dyscrecyon be
oned together / to the which lykenes a soul conformeth her asmoche as she
may. Also how ye bodyly penance and other bodyly excercysesholde be take for
an instrument to come to virtues / and not for pryncypall affection. Also of
the light of dyscrecyon (that is to say) in diverse manners and in diverse
workings. Also here he shows a repetycyon of some words said before / and
how that god ye fader promyseth to his servants refresshy^ge and ghostly
comfort / and to holy church reformacyon / by the mean or medyacyon of
fufferynge peynes and trybulacyons.

para; Ca. iiij.
THe fourth chapyter is how the workynge of the soul of this maid by the
answer of our lord / both increased and failed in ye bytternesse of her
soul / and how she made her prayer for his spouse holy church / and for his
people. Also how god made his moon of his christian people / and specially of
his mynysters. Also here he touches somewhat of the sacrament of his holy body
/ and of the benefyte of his incarnacyon.

Ca. v.
ALso how sin is more grievously punyshed after cryites passion than before /
end how ye god promyseth to do mercy to the world and to holy church / with
intersescyons of prayers and sufferau^ce of penance and dyseases. Also this
soul having knowledge somoche of the goodness of god / prayed not all only
for christian people and for holy church / but she prayed also for all the
world in general. And also how that god made his co^playnt of his reasonable
creature / and specially for their own proper love ye which reygneth in them
/ where he conforteth this soul to prayers and to teeres. Also how that no man
may ascape the hands of god / but that he must abide / other of his
ryghtwysenes or of his great mercy. And also how this devout soul upon a
time wha^ that she did sweet water / for an holy ghostly bre^nynge hete / in
time of prayer she desired that her swetynge should have be blood rather than
water / and how that she repreued herself / that she had not swette blood.
And i^ this repreuy^ge she made a special prayer for her ghostly fader. Also
how a man may not please god / but he bear trybulacyons and anguyshes with
pacyence.

The chapyters of ye secu^de part.
Ca. i.
THe first chapyter of ye secunde part makes mencyon of a bridge / and how
the fader of heaven made a bridge of his sone / when the way of going to heaven
was broke by ye m^hedye^ce of the first man Adam / by the which all true
christian men may over pass. How god induces and styrreth this soul to
behold the greatenesse of this bridge that is to say) how that it recheth fro
ye earth to heaven. And also how that all we be laborers / and how that we be
send fro god to labor in ye vyneyerde of our mother holy church / and how
that every man and woman have a vyneyerde of them self / and how that we the
which be the cyons or the branches which be oned in ye very vine of the sone
of god our sauyoure Ihesu christ / ye very lamb of meekness. And also by
what manner christ bears the branches with the soresayde vine / and that is to
say his servants. Also how that the vyneyerde of every man is oned with ye
vyneyerde of his neighbor (in somoche) that no man may set or norysshe or
till or dystrye his own vyneyerde / but he set or till or dystrye his
neighbors vyneyerde. Also how yt this foresaid soul when that she had
given praysynges to god / she prayed to him that he would show to her them
that were goy^ge by ye bridge / and them that were not going by that bridge.

Ca. ij.
ALso how ye blessed bridge gods sone has three grees / by the which be
betokened three states of a soul / and how this bridge wha^ it is araysed up i^
to ye heyghte / yet is it not departed fro the earth. Also how these words
shall be understand. Si exaltatus fuero a terra: om^ia traham ad me. Also how
this bridge is walled with stones / and how that they betoken ryall and very
virtues / and upon this bridge there is a house / or a place ordained where
meet shall be given to the wayegoers / and who that goes by that bridge gothe
to eternal and everlasting life / and who that goes under ye bridge by the
floode / gothe to pardycyon and to the death of everlasting pain. How that
men go with travail in these two ways (whyder he go that one or that other)
and of the delight the which a soul has / that goes to the bridge.

Ca. iij.
THe third chapyter makes mencyon / yet of this same bridge gods sone Ihesu
christ / and it tells wha^ our lord Ihesu christ was ascended up in to heaven
in the day of his ascencyon / he departed him not fro the earth. Also how that
this soul as she wondered on ye mercy of god / she noumbred in her soul the
multitude of the gifts of god / and the great graces which came to mankind
of that same dyuyne mercy. Also of the unworthiness of them the which went
by the floode / under the foresaid bridge. And how that god calls that soul
that gothe under the tree of death / which has his root pry^cypally in
four vices.

Ca. iiij.
ALso how the fruit of this tree is much diverse / as is the dyuersyte of
sins / and here he shows first of the voluptuosyte of carnal delectacyo^
or lechery. Also how yt the truyte of of some teeres is auaryce / and of the
evil that comes of sin / and how vnryghtfulnesse is the fruit of some
men's teeres / which have the state of domynacyon. Also throw his
vnryghtwysenesse and throw other defautes / a man comes in to false demynge.
And also of the unworthiness in to the which a man falls throw these
defautes. Here also god speaks upon that word which christ said. O go mittam
paraclitum. etc. Christ said / I shall send the holy ghost / which shall
repreue the world of vnryghtwysenesse and of false domes or Judge me^tes / and
here he says that one of these repreues be contynuall and without end.

Ca. v.
THe fyfte chapyter is of the secunde vndernymynge or blaming / wherein
vnrygthwysenesse and false domes be repreued / both in general and in
pertyculer. Also of four pry^cypall turmentes of the^ that be dampened / which
all other turmentes do follow / and specially and syngulerly of the foul
syghte of of the fend. Also of the third reprefe and blaming that shall be
in the day of Judgment / how they that be dampened may not desire any
goodness / and of the Joy of them that be blessed. Also that after the
general Judgment / the pain of them that shall be dampened shall be encreaced
with peynes not able to be thought.

The chapyters of ye third part.
Ca. i.
ALso of ye profit of temptacyons / and how each soul in his last end of
this life sees and tastes or feleth his place or he be departed fro the body
(that is to say) he shall know the pain or joy which he shall have here
after. How ye fend catches ever souls under color of some goodness / and
how they that be set in the floode and they that go not by the bridge be
dysceyued / for they think to ascape fro peynes and yet they fall therein. Here
is also made mencyon of a fair vysyon which this soul had / which vysyon
apered to her syghte as it had be a tree. Also how the world for sin
brought forth thorns and breres / yet some there be that be not ynoyed with
them / how be it no man may come to ever lasting life / without that he have
suffered and borne peynes and trybulacyons before yt he come thither. Also ye
evil that comes of the ghostly eye or syghte. Also how good deeds that be not
in the state of grace / avail not to everlasting life.

Ca. ij.
THe secunde chapyter tells how the precepts may not be kept / but that a
man should of parfeccyon keep the cou^seyles / and how in every state ye
which a man choseth (so that he have an holy and a good will) that state is
pleasynge to god. Also how worldely men with all their substance and goods
may not be fulfilled / and of ye pain ye which they deserve by their wicked
w^lles (as well in this life as after) how a dread which is bound suffyseth
not to obtain the everlasting life in heaven / and how with excercyse of this
dread / a man may come to the love of virtues.

Ca. iij.
ALso how this soul fell in to a mornyge for yt blyndenesse of them the which
were drenched in the foresaid floode. And also how three grees be fygured in yt
foresaid bridge (that is to say) in the sone of god Ihesu christ / between ye
three myghtes of the soul / and how these three myghtes of the soul if yt they
be oned together / there may no parseueraunce be had (without the which
parseueraunce) no man may come to ye end of parseccyon. Also in this chapyter
is an exposycyon of the word of Ihesu christ / wha^ he said thus. Siquis sitit,
etc. That is to say / who that thrusts / come to me and drink. And also how
that every reasonable creature generally may keep a manner governance / so
that he may pass out fro the sea of this world / and go by the foresaid
holy bridge. And also here shall be rehearsed a repetycyon of some words said
before.

Ca. iiij.
THe fourth chapyter tells wha^ our lord would show so this devout soul
/ that the three grees of the bridge be fygured by ye three states of the soul /
than he bad her lift up her self above herself to behold this
sothefastnesse. Also how that this devout soul beholdynge in the myrcoure of
god / saw diverse creatures go i^ diverse ways. And how the dread of seruage
without love of virtues / is not suffycyent to ever lasting life / and how the
law of dread and the law of love be oned together. And also how that a man
that has ye dread of seruage or thraldom dread / the which is the state of
imparfeccyo^ / by the which state is understand the first gre of the
foresaid holy bridge / he may come soon to the secunde gre / which is the
state of parfeccyon. Also of the imparfeccyon of them that loue^ and serve god
for their own profit and love / or for their own comfort.

Ca. v.
ALso how that god shows himself sometime to a soul that loves him. Also
why christ said not. O go manifestabo. I shall show my fader / but he said I
shall show my self what manner of governance a soul shall keep / that he
may come up to the secu^de gre of the holy bridge. How he yt loves god
vnparfytely / loves vnparfytely his neighbor / and also of the very tokens of
this vnparfyte love.

The chapyters of ye fourth part.
Ca. i.
THe first chapyter of the fourth part speaks of prayer / and first i^
what manner a soul shall govern him / yt he may come to pure love and
lyberall. And much of this third part speaks of prayer and of teeres / but
first god shows here a doctrine of the holy sacrament of crystes body on the
auter (that is to say) the holy sacrament of crystes body) and how that a
soul shall come fro vocal prayer to mental prayer. And here is showed a
vysyo^ which this devout soul had on a time. Also of a dysceyte that
creatures have sometime / which louen god and serve him for their own conforte
and their delectacyon. Also of ye dysceyte that they have / which set all
they affection in confortes and ghostly vysyons / and how that such that
delight them in such co^fortes and vysyo^s may be dysceyued and receive a
wicked spyryte under the color of a god spyryte / and of tokens how it may be
know wha^ it comes of god / and wha^ of ye devil.

Ca. ij.
ALso of the^ yt will not help or comfort their neighbors in their need /
because they would not be let nor leave their own conforte and peace and
rest. Also of the dysceyte which gods seruau^uauntes have / and locien god
with such vnparfyte love before said. How a soul yt knows her self wisely
i^ sothefastenesse / keeps her from all these dysceytes. Also by what manner a
soul comes fro imparfyte love and comes to perfyte love.

Ca. iij.
THe third chapyter is of tokens whereby it is know yt a soul is come to the
parfyte love. Also how imperfect me^ will only follow me yt fader / but
perfyte me^ follow ye sone. Also god shows a vycyon / which this devout
maid had / in ye which vysyon is showed of diverse baptyms / and of other
fair things and profitable. How that a soul when that it is come to the
third gree of the bridge (that is to say) after the time it is come to the
mouth / anon it takes the door of the mouth / and wha^ the proper will of
a man is deed / it is a very token that it is come thither. Also of the
worky^ges of ye soul / after time that it is ascended to the third holy gree.
Also of the states of them that be departed fro the third / and of workings
of the soul which is come to this state / and how god goes never away fro
the soul by co^tynuall feeling. Also how god goes not away fro the foresaid
parfyte me^ by feeling nor by grace / because of the union bytwyxe them. Also
how worldely men yelde^ glory and worship to god / whyder they will or not.
Also how the fendes do yield worship to god against their wylles.

Ca. iiij.
ALso how a parfyte soul yt is passed out of this world / se^th fully the
glory and laud of the name of god in every creature / and how i^ the soul is
a pain of desire / and no desire. Also how saint Paul after time he was take
to se the glory of them that be in bliss / he coueted to be unbound and
unloosed fro the body / and so do they the which be come to ye third and
fourth state / for which causes a soul desires to be losed fro the body /
and though it be not as he coueteth / it contraryeth not the will of god / but
much rather it gives and yeldeth worshyppes and thanks to almighty god in
that pain / and i^ every other pain for ye worship of god. How they the
which be come to the foresaid state of union / be lyghtned in the eye of
intelleccyon by grace with a light above nature. And how it is better to go to
have counseyle for the souls health to a meke man with an holy conscience /
than to a proud lettered man. Also here is a profitable repetycyo^ of many
things / which of many things be said / and how that god induces this
devout soul to pray for every creature / and in general for all holy
church.

Ca. v.
THe fyfte chapyter of this perte is much of the state of holy teeres / and
first how that this holy soul desired to know of the states and the fruytes
of holy teeres. And of the dyfference of the foresaid teeres / aod how that
there be five manner of teeres. Also a short repetycyon of the matter before /
and how that the wicked spyryte flees away fro them / the which come to the
fyfte teeres. And how the angers of the fend by a true way to come to this
state of teeres. Also how that they that desire to have teeres of eyes / and
may not have them / all such have teeres of fere. And also for what cause god
with draws bodyly teeres. And how ye.iiij. states of ye.v. states of teeres
given dyuersyte of teeres. And how god will be served with thing that has
none end / and not only with that thing the which has an end. And lso of
the fruytes of teeres of worldely men / and how yt such worldely wepers be
smytte with four wyndes. Also how the fruit of the secunde and the third
state of teeres / and of the fruit of ye fourth and the fyfte state of
teeres. Also how that this devout soul when that she gave thankynges to god
for ye foresaid states of teeres / made three petycyons to god. Also how the
light of reason is necessary to a soul that will serve god i^ sothfastenesse
and truly with the light of grace.

The chapytets of the fyfte part.
Ca. i.
ALso of the^ that put their desire more to suffer bodyly pain / than in
mortyfycacyo^ or in dystrye^ge of their own wylles / which is one parfyte
light / or a light of parfeccyon / more than yt general light / and it is
the secunde light of parfeccyon. Also of the third and most parfyte light of
reason / and of the works that a soul does when it is come to that state.
Also there is showed a fair vysyon which this soul had / in the which
vysyo^ is showed fully of ye manner of comy^ge of parfyte purete of the soul.
Also by what manner they receyne the ernest of sykernesse of ever lasting life
/ in this life such as abide in ye third light / which is the most perfyte
and pure light. Also how our neighbor shall be vndernome / that he fall not
in to no false domes nor Judgments. Also if a man pray for a parsone / and
god shows in ye soul of him that prays / that same soul is full of
derkenesse for whom he prays / yet this soul shall not be demed nor Judged
amys. Also how bodyly penance shall not be take for a pryncypal fundament /
nor for a pryncypall desire / but desire and love of virtues shall be take for
a pryncypal fundament. And of a short repetycyon of words said before / with
an addycyon of vndernymynge of our neighbor.

Ca. ij.
THe secunde chapyter is tokens to know when vysytacyons or ghostly vysyons /
come of god our maker / or of the wicked fend our enemy. Also how that god
is the fulfyller of devout and holy desires of his servants / and how yt it
pleases god much when that a man asks with parseuctau^ce / and that he knock
at the gate or the port of his sothefastnesse. And how that this devout soul
meketh her and yeldeth meke thankynges to almighty god the fader of heaven / and
how she prays for all the world / and specially for holy church / and for
her ghostly dyscyples / and for her two ghostli faders / and afeer this she
asks to here the deeds of ye mynysters of holy church. Also how god
beholds yt business of this soul about prayer / and answers to some of
her petycyo^s.

ALso here god speaks to this soul of ye dygnyte of prestes and of ye
sacrament of his holy body / and of the^ yt receive ye sacrament worthyly and
unworthily. Also how all the bodyly wits or fely^ges be dysceyued in ye
foresaid sacrament / but not the felynges of the soul / therefore with yt
felynges or wits of ye soul / yt holy sacrament shall be seen / tasted / and
feled. And here is of a vysyo^ which this devout soul had of this same matter.
Also of ye excellence in the which a soul stondeth / yt receives this
sacrament in grace. How ye words yt be said of ye excelle^ce of yt sacrament
/ be said yt ye dygnyte of prcestes should be ye better know / and how god
asks more purete and clennesse of body and soul / tha^ in other of his
creatures. Also how ye sacraments should another be boughte nor sold / and
they yt receive ye sacraments should help ye mynysters with their te^porall
goods / which goods ye mynysters should dyspose and ordeyne in to three
parts.

Ca. iiij.
THe iiij. chapyter speaks in ye beginning of ye dygnyte of precstes / and
how yt virtues of sacraments be not lessed throw ye sins of them yt
mynyster / nor throw the sins of ye receyuer. And how god will not yt
secusers correcke his mynysters. Also how god arecteth ye psecucyon yt is done
to holy church or to yt mynysters / as it were done to himself. And how ye
sin is more grievous / tha^ any other sin. Here also god speaks against
the^ yt do persecucyon to holy church / and of yt mynysters of holy church in
diverse manners. And a short repetycyon of yt yt is said before of holy church
/ and of yt mynysters. Of the excellence of virtues / and of ye holy works of
virtues and holy mynysters / and how they have ye co^dycyo^ of ye son^e and of
ye correccyo^s to their subjects. A repetycyon of words before. And of ye
reuer^ece yt shall be done to priests / whyder they be good or bad. And of the
deeds and wicked life of evil priests and evil mynysters. Also how
vnryghtwysenes reygneth in bad mynysters / and in the^ yt correcke not their
subjects. Of many other defautes of ye foresaid mynysters / and specially of
going to tauernes / and of their vain plays / and of holding of their
concubynes. Also how ye sin against kind reygneth in some of ye foresaid
mynysters / and of a fair vysyon which this soul had. Also how subjects
which be in the fore said defautes amend the^ not / and of defautes of
relygyous persons / which correcke not ye foresaid defautes. Also how ye
syn^e of lechery reygneth in evil mynysters of holy church / also ye auaryce
reygneth in wicked mynysters in lendynge for usure / and specially in byenge
and selling benefyces and prelaces / and of much evil yt has come in holy
church for his couetyse. Also how pride reygneth in ye foresaid mynysters / by
the which pride the feeling in god is lost / and when yt feeling is a way /
than fall they in to this defaute (that is to say) such men faynen them to
make consecracyon / and they make none. Also of many other defautes / which be
in wicked mynysters. And of many other defautes / the which come of pride /
and of man's own proper love.

OF the dyfference of the death of ryghtfull men / and the death of great
sinful men / and first of the death of ryghtfull men. Of the death of great
sinners / and of of their peynes in the end or point of death. And a
repetycyo^ of much that is said before. And how god forbyddeth that priests
should not be touched by the hondes of seculer men. And how god styrreth this
soul to pray and to weep / by compassyo^ of such myslyuynge prestes. And how
this devout soul yeldeth thankynges to god and praysynges / and prays

The chapyters of ye syxte part.
Ca. i.
THe chapyters of the syxte part treats much of ye prouydence of god / and
first of his prouydence generally (that is to say) how god provided man to be
man / and how he formed him of naught to his image and lykenes / and how god
provided man to his salvation / with the incarnacyon of his sone / wha^ the
gate of paradyse was shut / for the sin of the first man Adam. And how he
provided himself / gyuynge himself contynually to us / in to meet in the
auter. Also how god provided to give hope in his creatures / and how he that
most parfytely hops / most tastes the prouydence of god. Also how god in
the old testament provided the law and the prophecyes / and afterward he
send his word by ye apostels / martyrs / and by other holy men / and how no
thing falls to creatures / but that it is ye prouyde^ce of god. Also what
that ever god suffers to be done to us / it is only for our good / and for
the health of our souls / and they be blind and dysceyued that deem the
contrary.

Ca. ij.
THe secu^de chapyter shows how that god prouydeth in some special case to
that soul that falls. Also the secunde chapyter of this perte / tells how
god shows his prouyde^ce anendes his creatures (by diverse manners) and hows he
makes his complaynte of the untruth of his creatures / and how he expowneth a
figure of the old testament / and of a right profitable doctrine. How god
prouydeth for us / that we may have trybulacyons for ye health of our souls
/ and for the mystery of the^ that trust in themself / and not in yt
prou^dence of god. And of ye extelle^t grace of them yt trusten in ye
prouyde^ce of god. How god has provided for every soul / gyuynge them the
sacraments for their health. And how he prouydeth for his servants / the
which be full hongry and right desirous / when he ordeyneth them to be fed
with his sons body Ihesu christ / where he tells that often sythes he
provided crystes body by a wonder full manner to a soul that was full hongry.

Ca. iij.
THe third chapyter is of the prouydence of god / anendes them yt be abiding
i^ deedly sin / of the prouydence which god uses and ordeyneth for the^
that be in vnparfyte love / and for them that be in parfyte love and charity.
And a short repetycyon of ye foresaid words. And how god speaks afterward
of that word / which christ said to Peter. Mitte rethe ad dextera^ perte^
nauis et i^uemetes. That is to say / cast ye the net on the right side of
the ship / and ye shall find. And how somema^ casts his net more parfytely
than another / wherefore he catches more fysshe than another. Ind of ye
excellence of such parfyte me^.

Ca. iiij.
THe fourth chapyter is of ye prouydence of god in general / that he uses in
his creatures in this life and that other. Also of the prouyde^ce of god for
his pore servants / helping them with temporal goods. And of the euyls yt
come in keeping and desiring temporal goods vnordynately.

Ca. v.
THe fyfte chapyter is of the excelle^ce of the^ yt be poor i^ spyryte / and
how christ taught us of this pouerte / not only by word / but by ensample.
Also of ye prouydence of god / for them that take this pouerte. And a short
repetycyon of the foresaid dyuyne prouyde^ce. And how this soul wha^ she gave
worshyppes and tha^kynges to god / she prayed yt he would speak to her of the
virtue of obedyence.

The chapyters of ye seueth party.
Ca. i.
THe first chapyter of this seueth party / and all the chapyters of this party /
speak of the virtue of obedyence. And first how obedience is had / and what is
that thing which puts away obedience fro us. And what is the token of
obedyence / that a man has it ^r has it not. And who is the fellow of
obedyence / and of whom it is noryshed. How obedyence has a keye / wherewith
heaven is opened / and how ye keye must have a tho^ge and be borne by a
gyrdell. Here also he speaks of ye mystery of them that be not obedyent / and
of the excellent grace of them yt be obedyent.

Ca. ij.
THe secu^de chapyter is of the^ that set somoche love to obedyence / that it
suffyseth not to them to obey to the general obedyence / as to the
commaundyme^tes of god / but if they take and be bound to some special
obedience. Also how a man comes and by what manner fro the general obedyence
to the special / and of the excellence of the relygyo^. Also of the excellence
of them that be under obedyence and be obedyent / and of the mysery of them
that be inobedyent / which be in ye state of relygyon. How they that be very
obedyent receive an hundredth for one / and ever lasting life. And what is
understand by that one / and what by that hundredth.

Ca. iij.
THe third chapyter is of the paruersyte / mysere / and labors of him that is
not obedyent / and of the miserable fruytes yt come of inobedye^ce. Of the
Imparfeccyon of the^ that be slow or unlusty in relygyon / all be it they keep
them fro deedly sin / and of the remedy how they may come out of that
vnlustynesse. Of the excellence of obedyence / and of the goods that obedyence
gives to hy^ that takes it in sothefastnesse.

Ca. iiij.
THe fourth chapyter is of dystynccyon of two manners of obedyence (that is to
say) of obedyence of relygyous folk / and of obedyence that is done to a
certain parsone out of relygyon for god. How god rewards not after ye
travail of obedyence / nor after the length of the ryme / but after ye
magnytude of charity. Also of the redynesse and quyckenesse of them that be
very obedyencers. And of the miracles ye which god shows of this virtue. and
of dyscrecyon in obedyence / and of the works and reward of him that is very
obedyent.

Ca. v.
THe fyfte chapyter of this last party is a repetycyo^ of all ye hole book /
and how this devout soul yeldynge worshyppes and thankynges to god / made a
prayer for all holy church / and for all ye world. And here is commended ye
virtue of feythe / and so is fulfilled ye ^ude of this book.

Here follows a prologue.
TO sustren I have showed you what ympes and trees I have found and gadered to
plant and to set in your ghostly orcharde. The aleys of your ghostly orcharde
be full long and brod^ / wherein be many walking paths / which shall led
you truly to what manner fruit you list to feed you / in what party they be
set or planted. But sustren like it to you to know that in gaderynge
delectable fruit / I found full bitter wedes / bitter and sour they be to
taste / but profitable to know. Such wedes I purpose to set ymonge good
fruit (not for fedy^ge) but to your knowing. Taste you of them and know
them / that ye may beware yfony ghostly enemy profer you any such wedes.
Savor you the^ not for full fedynge / for than peryously they work / and full
often to death / but by grace the sooner it may be remedyed. But sustren though
my fruit be gadered / yet a time I must have of setting and of plantynge /
and ymo^ge recreacyons to the parfeccyo^ of my spyryte. Great laborer was I
never bodyly nor ghostly / I had never great strength myghtely to labor:
with spade nor with shouell. Therefore now devout sustren help me with prayers
/ for I lack cunning / against my great feblenesse / strength me with your
pity. Also have me recommended in your ghostly excercyse: to our blessed lady /
and salute her in my name with devout aues / hauy^ge my^de sometime on her five
joys / and sometime on her five sorrows / which she had in earth. With this
labor I charge you not / but as your charity styrreth you / with that virtue
help me forth / for hastily I go to labor / in purpose to parforme this
fruytefull and ghostly orcharde / as it shall be plesy^ge to almighty god to
give light to my soul / with true fely^ge and clear syghte. Which Ihesu
christ for his moderly love / grant only to his worship and to our ghostly
learning / and conforte all to creacyon. Ame^.

Here begins the book of dyuyne doctrine. That is to say of gods
techynge. Given by the person of god the fader / to the intelleccyon of ye
glorious vyrgyn saint Katheryn of Seen / of the order of saint Domynycke.
which was wryte^ as she endyted i^ her mother tongue / wha^ she was in
co^te^placyo^ / and rapt of spyryte / she herynge actualy. And i^ ye same time
/ she told before many what our lord god spoke i^ her.


And here follows ye first chapter of this book. which is how ye soul of
this maid was oned to god and how yt she made.iiii. petycyons to our lord in
that time of contemplacyon / and of the answer of god / and of much other
doctrine / as it is specyfyed in ye calendar before. Capi. i.
A Soul that is raised up with heavenly and ghostly desires / and affeccyo^s to
ye worship of god / and to the health of mantles soul / and with a great
desire langoreth virtuously / inhabyted by the space of a long time / full
besyly laboreth in ghostly exercise / and mekely abides in her inward
beholdynge / to know herself / to that intent only / that she might better
know in her self / ye goodness of god. For as she well feleth by grace / after
that knowing the love that loves is knytte / and joined with a love / to that
that is loved / and forces and besyeth her to love / and follow that knowing
/ and with contynual excercyse inhabyteth her / with the sothefastnes. And for
asmoche as a soul in no manner tastes nor sauoureth somoche / it is i^ no
manner somoche lyghtned with knowing of that sothefastnes / as it is by ye
mean of a meke co^tynuall / and of a devout prayer / founded and grounded in
the knowing of god / and or it self. Therefore such a prayer / oneth such a
soul to god / sorowynge the sleppes of ^^yite in his passion / and so by
desire / (...) you / and union o^^oue / the soul (...) an other than she (...)
this seems well of crystes words / when he said. Si ^s diligit me: sermone^
mea^ seruauit. That is to say. Who yt loves me shall keep my word. Also he
says in another place. Qui diligit me: diliget^ a patrimed / and ego diliga^
eu / and manifestabo illi meipsum / and erit vnum mecum / et ego cumillo. That
is to say. He that loves me / shall beloved of my fader / and I shall love
him / and shall show myself to him / and he shall be one with me / and I with
him. And in many places of scripture / we find words like to the same
purpose / by the which we openly know that a soul is alterate / and made
himself another than he was / in the sothefastnes of love and desire / and
that we may se this more clearly / I remember me yt I have red of an holy maid
/ servant of god Katheryne of Seen that when she gave her self ententyfly
to prayer / with enhaunsynge up her mind to god / to behold heavenly things
in manner of contemplacyon. Tha^ the holy god hyd not his love ye which may not
be mesured / which he had to his servants with the gift of intelleccyon by
the ghostly eye. But specially among other words / our lord god spoke to her
/ and said. Open ye eye of thy intelleccyon / or of ghostly understanding /
and behold in me / and you shall se the dygnyte / and the fayrenes of my
reasonable creature / and the fayrenesse which I have given to thy soul /
making it of naught / to my image and likeness. Behold them that been arrayed
with ye precious clothy^ge of ghostly weddy^ge That is to say / virtuously
arrayed with charity / and with many diverse virtues / contynually they ben
joined to me by love. Therefore if yt should ask me which ben they. I should
answer the again. They yt be clean purged from sin / they have my lykenes.
For such have lost and mortyfyed their own propre will / and ben conformed to
my will / and in all things with my will they ben clothed / and precyously
arrayed. Therefore it is full sothe / yt such a soul oneth it self to god / with
desire and affection of love. Also this soul / yet moreover willing to know
the holy sothefastnes of knowy^ge / and to follow it by excercyse. Considered
first as for her self with an high desire / that a soul may by no way of
doctrine / nor of ensample / nor of prayer / profit to his neighbor / but it
profit first to his self / that is to say i^ purchasing and having in
possessyon ye perfeccyo^ of virtues i^ it self. Therefore in that holy desire
of sothefast knowing / mekely she asked.iiij. petycyons / of the ever being
fader in heaven. The first petycyon was for her self. The second for
reformacyon of holy church. The third in general / for ye health of all ye
world / and specially for the health of cryste^ people / which with great
presumpcyon and great persecucyon / is rebel to holy church. The.iiij.
petycyon was / that the prouydence of god should puruaye for each derke case
or doubt / or need in general / and i^ special. How the desire of this soul
increased / when she knew ye necessyte that was in the world. This desire was
in her full great and abiding contynually / which desire increased in her the
more fervently / when the great wretchedness of this world was showed to her
of almighty god the, maker of all the world. And wha^ that she saw so great
trouble in the world and somoche offense done to god in ye world. Also in
this time of this holy desire / she had understanding by a wryty^ge which she
had of her ghosty fader. In the which writing / he showed her ye great pain
and sharpnes of intolerable sorrow ordained for syn^e. And for ye offense done
to god / and of ye cause of losing of souls / and for the persecucyon yt is
done to holy church / which words have kyndled in her a fire of a desire /
with a loving / and a bytternes / for ye offense done to god. And tha^ she with a
gladness / and joy of a trusty hope / mekely abode the meekness of god / ye
which mercyfully would puruaye for all the euylles and perelles. And for
asmoche / yt in receyuynge of the holy sacrament / a soul more swetely / and
more ferue^tly cleueth to god / and better knows his sothefastnes. Because
that tha^ a soul is in god / and god in ye soul. Right as the fysshes abyden
in the sea / and the sea in the fysshes. Therefore upon the next morrow
following / she had a full fervent and a bru^nynge desire to here mass. which
day was on a feast of our lady gods mother. And wha^ she had herd mass /
at a certain hour / with a full great desire / to have an inward knowy^ge of
herself / and of her own iperfeccyo^ / it seemed to her a great shamfastes /
yt she was pryncypall cause of all the euylles / or dyseases done i^ ye world
/ and conceived i^ herself a synguler hate / and dyspleasaunce of herself. And
than with a desire of an holy ryghtwysnesse puryfy such fylthes of sin ye
which she saw in ye world and i^ her own soul she list up her heart to
the fader of heaven and said. Everlasting fader in heaven / to the I make my
co^playnt of myself / and to yt I plain and accuse my self / to ye entente
that i^ this life you punesshe my sins / And for asmoche as I ye pryncypal
cause of the pains (throw my sins) which chryste^ people should suffer.
Therefore mekely I beseech you to put those pains upon me. How the works good
or evil in this world only suffysen not to be punysshed i^ purgatory / nor
to be rewarded in bliss / without contynual desire of charity. Than yt
sothefastnesse of the godheed took this desire / and ferue^tly drew it to him
/ and did like as it was in the old testament. For than when the sacryfyces
were accepted to god / fire came down from heaven and drew such a sacryfyce
to him. In the same manner that holy sothefastnes did to that soul / for that
sothefastnes / the fader of heaven send ye fire of the holy ghost / and took
the sacry fyce of her great desire / which sacryfyce she made of herself to
god. And wha^ our lord had resygned this sacryfyce of her / he spoke to her
and said. Daughter knows you not that all the pains that me^ suffren / or any
creature may suffer in this world / ben not worthy at the full / nor even
worthy penance / nor suffycye^t to punesshe the lest sin. And ye cause is /
for the offense that is done to me / which am god / and goodness that has
none end / asks a blame without end. Therefore I will yt you know / that all
ye pains that been given / or send of god in to this world ben not for
penance / but for correccyon / to amede and correcke the child wha^ he
trespaseth. And yet forthermore it is sothe / that a man makes or does
satysfaccyon by a fervent desire of ye soul (that is to say) with a veraye
contrycyon / and a dyspysynge of sin For veraye contrycyon / makes
satysfaccyo^ to the sin / and to the pain for sin / not for the pain ye
ye soul suffers for ye time / which time has end / but for the desire
that the soul has / which has no end / and that is for god / which is
without end. Ask you sorrow in heart for sin without end / and love god
contynually without end. Sorrow it asks without end (that is to say) without
ceasynge in this world / and that is in two manners. One is that a man have
veraye co^trycyon for his own offense that he has done against his god / and
his own maker. The second is that a man have sorrow for ye offense yt he
sees or knows done to god of his neighbor. Of such men / for asmoche as
they have such contrycyo^ i^ both manners. Also for they have such a desire
that has none end / for they be^ coupled to me with a desire of love /
therefore they sorowen when they offend themself / or wha^ they se / or know
any creature offend god / for that contynuall sorrow for themself / and for
other / and for desire of love / all the pain of such men that they suffren
bodyly or ghostly / of what ever part it comes / that pain deserves / or
shall have merytes ye which have none end / and does satysfaccyon for the
sin / which syn^e worthily asks and dyscerneth a pain that should have no
end. Not withstondynge the deed of sin had an end / and it was done such a
time yt it had and end / and the cause is thus / for that sin parauenture
was done with some virtues / and with desire of love / with contrycyon and with
dyspleasaunce of all fautes yt were done. Therefore the pain of ye trespass
that should have no end was modyfyed and shall have an end / and make full
satysfaccyon for that sin. Thus shows the apostle when he said. if I shall
speak with the tongues of men / and of angels and if I have prophecy / and if yt
I deal all my goods in to poor men's meet / and if I take or put my body to
ye fire / and it to brunne / yet all this profyteth me not / if I have not
charity. Saint Paul also shows / that all such works / bodyly or ghostly /
the which have an end in this world / ben not suffycyent to punesshe ye
wretchedness of sin / nor to give reward / with out salt or fatness / and
sweet savor of the desire of the holy charity. How desire and contrycyon of
heart makes satysfaccyon for sin / and pain for sin / and sometime it
makes satysfaccyo^ for sin / and not for pain. Now daughter I have showed
the how sin in this time that shall pass / is not punyssed only with such
penance that is done here / but it is punysshed with penance inwardely / that
is suffered by desire and with love oned to god / and by contrycyon of men's
hertes / not by virtue of pain oneli / but throw the virtue of a fervent dysyre
of souls / and as holy desires and other desires of virtues have life / or be
acceptable and merytory wha^ they ben taken and used / for ye love of my sone
crucyfyed. For asmoche as ye soul takes love of him / and follows his
steps with virtues / fastings / and prayers. In such manner such penaunces
done they profit the (and in none other) and so they make satysfaccyon to the
pain for sin / and that is by the union / or knyttynge together of that holy
love the which is gotten and purchased in ye knowing of my amyable goodness /
and in the bytternesse and sorrow of the heart / and i^ knowing and
knowlegynge of his own defautes / which knowing bry^geth forth an hatered
of his own unworthiness and mysery / and a great dyspleasaunce of sins.
Wherefore he demeth himself unworthy any grace / and holds him worthy to have
tourment and pain. And thus the holy sothefastnes spoke of all other / which
suffered all things with pacye^ce / and demed them self with meekness in all
things / unworthy to receive the gracyous gifts of god / and worthy to have
punyssheme^t throw love of heart with the fervent bru^nynge of pasyence and of
meekness. After this informacyon / forthewith god spoke to her and said. Take heed than intentytly in thy inward wit / in what manner it is said to the /
how that satysfaccyo^ is made for sin. Thou does ask pains of me / ye
which might make satysfaccyon / for ye offenses done to me of my creatures.
Also thou did ask of me which am the life of all things / to know / and to
love perfytely. This is the way / thou shall be in will to ascend to ye
heyght of perfyte knowing / and thou shall be in will to taste me / the which
am ever lasting sothefastnesse / so that thou never go out of the way of
knowing of thy self. And when thou art cast down i^ to ye vallaye of
meekness / than know me in the / of whom you shall have all things that been
to ye necessary / or behourable. There may no virtue sto^de / nor abide / but it
come of charity / or yt it be grounded in charity / and mekenes does nouresshe
most and best / ye virtue of charity. Tha^ thou shall be made meke in knowing
of thy self / if you consider the that thou hase no being of thy self / but
you shall know thy being of me / the which loved the and you all / or ever
that ye were borne / and of my great love which may not be meiured / my will
was to reform you again to grace / and in my reformynge you again / with the
brennynge of so great a love / ye which I had to you / I washed you with the
blood of my sone / the which was shed for you. The shedynge of that blood /
makes a man to know the sothefastnes / the which has put away the cloud
of his propre love / by knowing of hy^ self / ye which sothfastnes he might
not else know. And tha^ in ye knowing of me / the soul is closed with such
a fervent love / that for that brennynge love / the soul is in contynuall
pain / but not in pain which greueth the soul / nor makes it to tall / but
rather that pain makes the soul more virtuous / and refressheth it / and
comfort more the soul / for he suffers pain / because he knows my
sothefastnes / and his own sins and unkindness / and the great
bly^denesse of cryste^ people. And for ye great love that ye soul has to me
/ he is troubled and soroweth for his unkindness / and other men's. And if
he loved me not / yet he should have no pain / nor trouble. Therefore you and
my other servants / anon as ye have knowing of my sothefastnes i^ such
manner (as I have rehearsed to you before) to my laud / and worship and glory of
my name / you must suffer many wrongs / trybulacyons / vnderstondynges /
reprtues / in words and indedes to the day. Bear therefore easily and with
pasyence you and my other servants trybulacyons / and sorrow with teres of
eyes for ye offenses that be^ done to me / for the love of virtues to my
worship. And if you so do / I shall do satysfaccyo^ to your sins / in somoche
that what penance ye suffren / shall suffyce for satysfaccyo^ in you and other
/ by ye virtue of your charity. And than for a reward / ye shall have
forgyuenesse of all your ygnorau^ce / and I shall no more remember me of your
trespace. In other of my creatures I shall do satysfaccyon by mercy. And for
the affection of your charity / and to the^ I shall give grace after the
dysposycyo^ / which they should receive / as thus. They dysposen them mekely
with reverence / to receive ye techy^ge and the doctrine of my servants / al
those that so done / partly I shall forgive them their sins / and the pains
for sin / and the cause is. For by yt / they dyspose the^ somekely to the
techynge of my servants / by that they shall have such grace that they shall
come to very knowing of themself / and to have compunccyon of al their
trespaces / and to be co^tynually in devout prayer. And by the seruent desire
of my servants / I shall receive them benyngely / and they shall receive the
fruit of a special grace / and also a grace special / in some gre more or
less after that they will labor / and have excercyce with virtues. This I say
generally / yt they shall have forgyuenesse of their sins / but if it so be /
that they be so obstynate / yt by their dyspayre they will be repreued of me /
no regard taking to ye blood of my sone / the which so louyngely has
washed them with his pcyous blood for your saluacyo^. Now daughter what
fruit of grace as you suppose / or thy^ke they shall have. Their fruit it is
this. That by ye prayer of my servants / I am constrained / and in a manner
compelled / by the which I abide their tournynge / and chaungynge to virtuous
living / and I give them light of conscience / and I styre them to beware and
withstonde sin / and I make them to taste ye savor of virtue / and to have
liking in the conuersacyon of my servants. Also sometime I suffer that this
wretched world / be contrary^ us to them / and that they suffer and feel many
passions / yt they may know ye little stablenes yt is in this world / and
that they lift up their hertes and desires to me / to get and purchase their
own health of ever lasty^ge life. And so in these foresaid manners / and in
many other manners / which no eye may se / nor tongue speak / nor heart
suffyseth to thyke / how many diverse way as there ben which I hai^^ ordained
only of love / that they may be brought to grace / and that my sothefastnes
may be fulfilled i^ the. And to this I am compelled / for I formed the^ and
made the^ of naught / of my charity yt may not be spoke / nor told with
tongue. Also for ye prayers of my servants / and for their fervent desires
and sorrow / I forsake not / nor I despise not their reres and labors / and
their meke prayers / but gladli I receive them / and they ben to me full
acceptable / for I am he the which do make my servants to love them / and to
make inwardely sorrow for their harm / and reparynge of their souls / but yet
in all these general labors / and ghostly excercyses / satysfaccyon for
pain and for sin is not made / but only satysfaccyo^ for sin. For in
their party they dyspose them not with a very parfyte love / to be oned to me
with my love / nor with the parfyte love of my servants / also they have not
that bitter sorrow / with parfyte contrycyon for the offenses that they have
done to me / as my servants have / but the love and co^trycyon which they
have is imperfect. Therefore they have not / nor yet receyuen not full
satysfaccyon for pain / as the other that been parfyte / but only satysfaccyon
for sin / for the dysposycyon must come on both the parties (yt is to say)
as well of the receyuer / as of him that is the gyuer. And for asmoche as they
ben not parfyte / therefore they receive imparfytely yt parfeccyon of their
desires. That is to say / the parfeccyon of my servants / the which done
offer their desires for them that been not parfyte / with pains before me.
Wherefore I say to the that they do satysfaccyon for their sin / and it shall
be forgyuen them. And that is right and sothefastnesse that it so be / in the
manner as it is said before / for throw the cle^enes of their conscience / and
other ghostly excercyses / their syn^e is forgyuen. For when they begin to
have knowy^ge of themself / they casten out fro them the rotten fylthe of
their sins / and by that they receive a special grace / and such ye so done
be^ in comy^ charity / if they pacyently take all thing that they suffren / as
for their correccyon / and quenchen not the goodness and the grace of the holy
ghost. Ye se when they leven their sins / they receyuen a life of grace / but
it so be that they be^ wrapped with wickedness not taking head to my
goodness / nor to the great labors of my servants. For if they ben so
ygnorau^t and so unkind / than anon all that which should have be^ for their
correccyon / and was forgyuen them by mercy / tourneth them to preiudyce and
hyndrynge / not in the defaute of mercy / nor in the defaute of my servants /
which had gotten mercy for him that is so unkind / but only throw the
hardenesse of his heart / which with the hand of his fre will set a stone as
of an hard Adamaunt upon his heart / which stone may not be broken but with
blood / but it profyteth not the. Not yt with stondynge / his hardenesse /
while he has time here of fre choice / if he will ask the blood of my sone /
and with the same hand wylfully will put it up to ye very hardenesse of his
heart / he shall receive ye sweet fruit of the blood / the which was shed for
him. if he tarry over the time yt he have a fre will / than is there no remedy
afterward / for he brought not again the gift that he had of me / for I gave
him mind / that he should have my^de of my benefytes / I gave him intelleccyon
and understanding / that he should well se and know sothefastnes. Also I gave
him affection of love and desire / yt he should love me / which am
euerlasty^ge sothefastnes / by the which sothefastnes and clear intelleccyon
he sees and knows best. This is the gift and the ghostly dowre which I
have given only to you by grace / which dowre should turn again to me
which am the fader / but he that is the wicked man sells that dowre and
bytaketh it to ye fend / which wicked man wha^ he dies / he bears with him
that he wanne i^ his life / fulfyllynge his mind all with delytes / and with
thoughts and remembrance of his sins without co^trycyon / as with pride and
couetyse / and with his propre love / and with hatered and dyspleasaunce to his
neighbors / which ben my servants / and in all that he may parsueth and
vexes them grievously. To all such her reason and intelleccyon is made full
derke with her wretchydnes by an vnornately love and desire / and so with their
sins / they receive everlasting pain without end / because they were
neclygent to do satysfaccyon for their sin / with contrycyo^ of heart / and
had no hatered nor dyspleasau^ce for their sins. Therefore daughter now thou
may se yt satysfaccyo^ for sin is not only by penance bodyly / which
has an end in this world / but satysfaccyo^ for sin is ye veraye parfyte
co^trycyon of the heart / and not only satysfaccyon for sin / but also
sometime it is satysfaccyo^ for the pain that follows for sin / to all them
that have this parfyte contrycyon / and other general people which stonden in
common charity / and taken mekely all that they suffren (as for their pain)
with co^trycyon of heart / make satysfaccyo^ for sin only (as it is said
before) because they receive the gift of grace / and ben without deedly sin.
Also all they yt have not so full parfyte contrycyon / nor parfyte love to make
satysfaccyon for pain / nor for sin / they shall to ye pains of purgatory.
Also take heed and se that throw the desire of ye soul / which desire is
coupled in me / which am all good without end / makes satysfaccyon more or
less / or suffycye^tly after ye measure of parfyte love / both of him yt
yeldeth / and of hy^ that receives prayers and desires. And that same mesure
of love / both of the yelder and of the receyuer / is mesured and comes of my
benignite and goodness. Therefore daughter increase you by ye fire of thy fervent
desire / and bru^nynge heart of love / and suffer not that excercyse of so good
a trayuale / and goodly Iournaye of so great virtue to over pass / but that
you call and cry to me evermore / for the same increase of desires / and for
my contynuau^ce of excersyse / with a meke and a lowly voice / and with a
contynual devotion. Thus I say to the and to thy ghosty fader / whom I have
ordained to the inerth that myghtely ye bear such trayuayle bodily and ghostly
for your self and for other for my love / and that ye put away and
withsto^de your propre sensualyte. How it pleases much our lord / to let us
suffer for hy^. A great and a strong desire and will to suffer all labors and
pains unto ye time of death / for health of souls is full pleasynge to me.
For ye more that is suffered for me / somoche more the token of love to me is
showed / and in ye loving much more is take and comprehended of my
sothefastnes / and the more yt a man knows / ye more he feleth a pain
intolerable in his soul for offense done to me. Thou daughter mekely did
ask a will to suffer / and to bear other me^nes fautes upon the. Also you did
alke a love and a light / and ye knowy^ge of my sothefastnes / not taking nor
beholdy^ge what I have said to the now / yt how much more is ye love /
somoche the pain and sorrow increases / for where love increases to me /
there sorrow increases for offense done to me. Therefore forsothe I say to
you. peretiteet accipietis. That is to lay / ask and ye shall have that you
ask / I shall never deny them yt aske^ in sothefastnes. And think well
daughter yt ye brenny^ge of everlasting charity / ye which is in the soul it
is oned to god with a parfyteopasyence / so yt one may not be parted fro the
other. Therefore a soul when she purposes to love me / she shall with purpose
only / and right symply suffer pains for the glory of my name / in what manner
/ or for what cause I have or dryned it to suffer. For pasyence is not pryued /
but in pains. And as it is said before / pasyence is oned to charity /
therefore manly and myghtly he bears such labors / or else ye might not be
faithful / nor true tasters / nor sauourers of the faith / nor spouses of my
sothefastnesse / nor desire parfytely my worship / nor lovers of the health of
souls.

The second chapter is how each virtue and defaute is by some mean or manner
of a man's neighbor. And how virtues ben wroughte in man by some mean of his
neighbor. And so forth of the same matter as it is specyfyed in the kale^der.
Ca. ii.
ONe thing forthermore I will yt you know / that each virtue or defaute yt is
done / it is done by some mean of thy neighbor / as thus. He that hates me
he harmeth his neighbor / and himself generally / he does harm to his
neighbor and partyculerly to himself. Generally / for ye be^ bound to love
your neighbor as yourselfe. Louy^ge hy^ ghostly with prayers / cou^ceylynge
him with words / and comfortynge him ghostly and te^porally / ye should help
him in all his needs with your will / if ye have not wherewith to help him / and
to socoure him / for he yt loves not me / loves not his neighbor / and he yt
loves not his neighbor / than he helps not his neighbor / and such a man
first of fendeth himself / for he pryueth hy^ self of grace / and after yt
grace fro his neighbor / because he helps him not ghostly / and gives him
no prayers nor holy desires / which he is bound to show out before for his
neighbor / all the help which he has shall begin of love / ye which a
soul has to his neighbor for my name. Also in ye contrary wise each fault
is done by some mean of a man's neighbor. For he that loves not me / he is
not in charity with his neighbor / of this comes al euylles and wickedness /
because the soul lacks charity / and has no love to me nor to his
neighbor / in that he works no good / he does evil first to himself / and
to his neighbor / not to me / for he may not harm me / but for asmoche as I
take it done to me / yt is done to ye neighbor / therefore he harmeth himself
by the peril of sin / which sin pryueth him of grace / and so he may be
no worse to himself. He offends his neighbor wha^ he yeldeth not dew love
and affection to his neighbor / wherewith he should help him. That is to say
/ with devout prayers and holy desires / which he should offer before me for
his neighbor. This yt I have said now is ye general help and comfort /
which should be given to each reasonable creature. Forthermore a partyculer
profit is ye / which is done to the^ yt ben nyghe to thy syghte / for ye be
bound the one to help the other in word and good worky^ge and in ensample
gyuynge / and in all things that the behooves purely and clearly / and gyuynge
counsel as a man would do to himself / without any passion. This does not
he that has no love to his neighbor. Also you sees well yt he which does not
so does his neighbor a partyculer harm / and not only i^ that he harmeth
him / for asmoche as he does him not ye good yt he might / but co^tynually
harmeth him / and that is in this manner / he does sin both actually in deed
and wylfully / or mayn tayneth it in the soul. Sin is done myghtly and
inwardely in the soul / wha^ a man conceyueth a pleasau^ce in ye soul of
sin / and an hate of virtue / which comes of his propre sencyble love /
which love has pryued him ye affection of charity / which charity he owes
to yield to me and to his neighbor / and after he has conceived / thus by
meyntenynge / tha^ brings he forth one thing after another on his neighbor
/ by diverse manners as it pleases and lyketh his wicked sencyble will. Sometime
he bry^geth forth and bears a cruelte generally and petty culerly. Generally
wha^ he sees himself and other creatures in perel of death and damnacyo^ for
lack of grace And therewt he is so cruel yt for love of vices / and for hate
of virtues / he gives no comfort to hy^self nor other but as a lover of
cruelte / he stre^gheth more and more his cruelte / yt is to say / not only
he shows no vertuouslyuy^ge / but wyckedly taking on him the office offendes
/ and withdraws himself and other fro virtues / and with all his might he
bry^geth other creatures to vices / this is the office of a wicked cruelte /
for he makes himself an able instrument / to ye pryuynge of euerlasty^ge life
/ and to ye gyuynge of everlasting death. He uses this bodyly cruelte with
concupyscence / for not only yt he helps not his neighbor / of of his own
good / but turmenty^ge poor persons / taking away their good. Sometime by
extorcyon / or lordeshyp / sometime by fraud / begylynge / or with dysceyte.
They ransom them and take of their good and their bodies / which is much
worse. O you wretched cruelte / says our lord / thou shall be pryued of my
mercy / but thou turn again to venyuolence and pity with thy neighbor. Also
sometime this pleasauce of sin / and hatered of virtue / bry^geth sorry /
wicked / and wrongefull words / wherewith full often comes ^^^slaughter. And
sometime beestly dyshoneste / full of all fylthes / and stynky^ge wretchedness
/ which vehemeth not only one or two / but al those yt cleueth t^ hy^ / and
draws to him by love or by conuersacyon / be corrupted / or venymed. Sometime
such a man shows pride to his neighbor only / in yt he holds himself in
more reputacyon tha^ his neighbor / and by his pride he purposes wrong to
his neighbor / and does him wrong. if he be a lord / or a man of great
state / by cruelte or wrong / he dysceyueth his neighbor / and dystroyeth
him. Look here daughter / take heed what is said. And fro this time forward
sorrow for ye offense that is done to me / and weep fore for such as ben deed
ghostly / that by holy prayers they may come to life. Thou sees that in every
place / what wrong is done to ye neighbor / and yt much evil is done to man
/ by the cause of man / so that a man's neighbor is mean to evil. Orels no
syn^e should be moved at all / pryue / nor aperte. It is pryue / wha^ it is
not done to his neighbor / yt is dew to his neighbor. It is open / wha^ the
vices ben showed openly. Therefore it is sothe / yt each offense done to me / is
by some means of a man's neighbor. How yt virtues ben wroughte in man by
some mean of his neighbor. And which virtues in man ben so dyfferent. Now I
have declared to ye how al defautes comen by some mean of a man's neighbor.
And ye cause is / for they have no affection of charity / which charity
strengheth all virtues and gives them life / and co^fyrmeth them in grace. And
so a man's proper love / which takes the charity and love of his neighbor /
is fundament and ground of all euylles. All sclaunders / hatereddes / crueltes
/ and all inconuenyentes / comen forth of this wicked and venomous rote. This
styuky^ge love deedly has wounded all the world / and brought in a sekenes to
ye pryue body of our holy mother the church / and to the universal body of
chryste^ relygyon. For as I said to the / al virtues ben founded in a man's
charity to his neighbor / and yt charity gave life to al virtues. And sothly
so it is For there may no virtue be gote^ with out that charity. That is to say.
Virtue may not begote^ / if merit of virtue may not be gotten. For after time /
a soul knows her self As it is said before. Tha^ the soul syndeth mekenes
/ and an hatered of his own sensyble passion. Knowing than / that the wicked
law of ye flesh / how that it is annexed to his me^bres. which law
evermore impugneth / and contraryeth ye spyryte. Therefore the spyryte aryseth
against the flesh / with hate / and dyspleasau^ce / of ye sensualyte /
tredynge her down / under ye root of reason. The soul also fyndeth the
affluence and ye great ple^te of my goodness / when it has received my
benefytes, which benefytes she brygeth / and gadereth them often in her mind
with tha^kynges / till she have savor / and parfyte knowledge of ye plentuous
goodness of god in herself. Right as a best ofte^tymes cheweth his meet to have
savor therein So ye soul gadereth to his mind my benefytes / and ye knowing
of him self. And when this knowing is found by a spyryte of mekenes / he
yeldeth al to me / knowing that with a synguler grace. I have lad him out of
derkenes / and called hy^ again to ye light of very knowledge. And when my
goodness is known / the soul loves it / both with mean / and without mean.
That is to say without mean of it self / or of his propre profit / and with
mean of virtue / which he conceived of my love / for he sees well. But he
have sin in hate / and virtue in love / he should not be accepted of me / in
none otherwise. But if he hate sin / and love virtue / he should not be to me
loving and kind. After time he has conceived this knowing of my goodness /
by affection of my love / anon he shows it to his neighbor / or else that
he has conceived / were no virtue. But for asmoche as he loves me i^
sothefastnes / so he profyteth his neighbor / or else he should not proryte
his neighbor. For my love / and ye love of thy neighbor / ben all one. And ye
more yt a soul loves me / somoche more he loves his neighbor. For he has
such love to his neighbor / as comes fro me. And that is yt I have put to
you a mean / that you have experyence of virtues togyders / and preue virtues
i^ you. For you should do profit to your neighbor / wha^ ye may not do to
me that profit. And yt shows well / that you have me in your soul by grace
/ bringing fruit in your neighbor / your excercyse i^ many holy prayers /
and in holy and amyable desires / only seeking my worship / and health of
souls. A soul that is enflammed with my sothefastnes. which sothefastnes /
should beloved of all creatures in general. And in special more or less /
should never cease to profit al creatures / after each man's dysposycyo^ /
and as he yt pray^eth / asks of me by a bre^ny^ge desire / as it is expressed
before / where it is declared that bodyly pain only / it is not suffycyent to
punesshe sin / without a great desire. Than afterward yt he has profyted
to each creature / after each man's dysposycyon / for the union of love /
which he has made in me / gyuynge help and comfort to the health of all
the world / with his affection and desire / which he has spredde so broad.
Than he forseth hy^ first to behold his own necessytes ghostly / and that is
wha^ he profyteth first to himself / by co^ceyuy^ge of virtues / by which
virtues he has drawn to him grace to se and to put his eye partyculerly to
the necessytes / or needs of his neighbors. Therefore wha^ he has done thus
generally / to each creature / by the desire of charity / than at ye last he
helps the^ yt ben nyghe to him / to increase them in virtues / after ye
nombre of diverse graces / which I have given to him / and ordained to hy^ to
depart. For to some man I grant the virtue of doctrine / to give counsel to
his neighbor / by reason of word / without any other man's techynge. To some
man I grant and give example of good living. Each man owes to give
edyfycacyo^ of good and honest living to his neighbor. These ben ye virtues
and many mo / which thou ca^ not nombre / which comen of man's love to his
neighbor / and I have put them so dyuersly in man / for I have not given all
virtues to one man alone / I give some man one virtue / and to some an other /
to an other partyculerly. Not withstondynge that a man may not have one
parfytely / but he have all other virtues / for all virtues ben knyte together /
but I give many virtues specially / as for the chief and heed of all other
virtues / that is to say. Pryncypally I grant the virtue of charity to some
man. Also to some the virtue of ryghtwysnesse / to some man mekenes / to some
man full says and to other dyuersly the virtue of prudence / te^poraunce /
pasyence / and to some ye gift of streynghe. These virtues I shall give to
many creatures / dyffcre^tly in a man's soul / all be it that these virtues
ben put for a pryncypalyte of virtues in a soul / more dysposed or better to
ye pryncypall conuersacyon with the virtue / than with other virtues / and of
this / by desire of that virtue / he draws to hy^ other virtues. For as it is
said before / throw the desire of charity / al virtues be^ knytte together.
And so many gifts and graces of virtues ben dyuersly departed / both bodyly
and ghostly. I say bodyly / for necessary things bodyly / which a man needs
in this life. I have given all things so dyfferently / or so dyuersly / for I
gave not all virtues to one man / that by compulsyon ye should have cause to
use charity / each to other. I might well have endowed men after ye body and
the soul / with all things yt to the^ belo^ge / but I would that one should
have need of an other / and that they sholden be my dyspensers and servants /
to give and to deal forth ye gifts and the graces which they have received
by my goodness. For a man will he or not / he may not avoid nor eschew / but
yt he shall use the deed of charity with his neighbor. Nevertheless sothe it
is / if such a deed that seems in charity be not done in me / nor for me / it
profyteth not him yt does it / as to ye increase of grace. Also daughter
behold and se / yt I have ordained me^ my mynystres / to yt intent yt ye
virtues of charity sholden be used togyders among them / and I have set the^
in diverse states and degrees / and ye scripture shows you well / where I
said. In domo mea ma^siones multe sunt. That is to say In my house there be^
many dwelly^ge places / I will no other thing but love. For in the love of me
/ the love of thy neighbor is fulfilled and ended / and wha^ the love of a
man's neighbor is fulfilled / the law of god is ended. Wherefore he yt is
joined / or knytte / or oned i^ love to god / he works / or does yt he may
to yt profit of his neighbor / after his degree and state. How virtues ben
preued / and stre^ghed of their co^trarytes. Now daughter I have said to ye /
how he that is set in charity / does profit to his neighbor / in which
profit / he shows the love yt he has to me. Now forthermore I say to ye /
yt sometime a man i^ his neighbor by experye^ce of wro^ges feleth ye virtue of
pasyence in himself in yt time of wrongs / which wrongs he receives. Also
a man has experye^ce of meekness / throw the pride of a proud man / and so
faith in an unfaithful man / and trusty hope / i^ hy^ ye mystrusteth / and
ryghtwysnesse in hy^ yt is vnryghtful / pity also in a cruel man / and
softness and benygnyte in an yrous man. Right as wicked me^ receyue^ vice by
their neighbor / so an other man receives virtue by his neighbor. As thus.
if thou take good head / thou may well se / that meekness is pryued in pride
/ for a meke man quenches pride / therefore a proud man may not harm a meke
man. Also ye untruth of wicked me^ / which louen me not / may not make less
yt faith of him that is true to me. Also ye folly of a man shall not make
less the hope of hy^ / yt has trust of love in me / but rather such
untruth and folly / streyngheth faith and hope / and preueth it in him by my
love / and by charity to his neighbor. For wha^ he sees his neighbor vnfay
the full / and mystrusteth both me / and hy^ / because he that loves not me /
may not have faith nor hope i^ me / but rather has set yt faith and hope
where he loves by his own sensualyte. My true servant cease not for all
that / but he loves him that is so untrue / and with a trusty hope yt he
has i^ me / he seeks the help of his neighbor. Thus you may se / yt in ye
untruth of hy^ / and in thode fault of hope / the virtue of faith is asayed
and had in other. In these examples and in other when need is a man preueth
virtue in himself / and his neighbor. Also a man's ryghtwysenesse decreaseth
not by his neighbors vnryghtwysenes / but rather he is showed ryghtful by ye
virtue of pasyence. Right so benygnyte / or meekness / or softness is preued
by pasyence in time of wroth. Therefore I say to the ye virtues is not only
assayed in them / ye besyen the^ to yield good for ill / but often he shall
cast out coals kyndled with the fire of charity / yt sets at naught ye
hatered / and rancour of the heart / and of the foul of an yrous man Also fro
the hate of a man / comes again benyuolence / and yt comes fro ye virtue of
charity / and of parfyte pasyence yt is in hy^ ye suffers ye wroth of wicked
men / berynge and supporting / the defautes of the same me^. If you behold /
you may se ye virtue of streynghe and of parseuerau^ce / how much yt virtues
be^ preued with wrongs / and detraccyons of me^ / which full often with dyspytes /
sometime with staterynges / will hyndre a man and draw hy^ back ward / yt in
no wise he should follow ye wait of doctrine and of sothefastnes. Therefore he
is all strong and parseueraunt / if ye virtue / or gift of streynghe be
parfytely grounded within him / for tha^ he seleth by experye^ce the same virtue
by medyacyon of his neighbor and if it had no good experyence / and were not
preued with such many contrarytes / there should no virtue have be^ founded nor
grounded in the way of sothefastnesse.

The third chapter is of ye virtue of dyscrecyon / and first how a soul shall
not put his affection nor effectual workyngel bodyli penance pryncypally /
but in inward virtues / and forth of the same matter / as it is specyfyed in
ye calendar before. Ca. iii.
THese ben devout and holy worky^ges which I ask of my creatures (that is to
say) the inward virtues of ye soul / which ye soul has in co^tynuall
expeoye^ce / as it is said before (yt is to say) not only ye virtues which
be^ used with ye instruments of ye body / as wtoutwarde workynge / with diverse
bodyly penau^ces / which be^ ye i^strume^tes of virtues but they be^ no
virtues in themself. For if it were so / and yt those instruments were not so
gettes to virtues rehearsed before / it were little pleasy^ge to me. But rather
if a soul did not dyscretely his penance (yt is to say) if his affeccyo^ be
rather pry^cypally set i^ his bodyly penance / tha^ should his perfeccyon be
let thereby. Therefore he shall set his heart pry^cypally on affeccyo^ and desire
of love / with an holy hatered of himself by very meekness and parfyte pasyence
/ and all other in ward virtues of ye soul / with a desire of my worship / and
of the health of souls / which virtues shown yt a man's own will is deed /
and that contynually the sensualyte is mortyfyed / throw the desire and love
of virtues. With such dyscrecyo^ he shall do his penance (that is to say)
put pryncypally his love and desire in virtues / rather tha^ i^ bodyly penance
/ for penance shall be as an instrument / to work for encreas of virtues / as
it seems it needful. And as a man may work after reasonable mesure of his
might / for if it were done in any other manner / as to set his ground and
fundame^t pry^cypally upon ye penance / tha^ should his perfercyon be let and
hyndred (and the cause is) for ye penance was not done dyscretely / with the
knowy^ge of my sothefastnesse / nor with the light of his own knowing / nor with
the clear light of my goodness / but indyfferently it was done / not louy^ge
yt / which I love more than that / and not haty^ge yt / which I most hate.
For dyscrecyon is not but a sothefast knowy^ge which a soul should have of
herself / and of me. In ye knowing of this dyscrecyo^ / he holds and keeps
his root. Dyscrecyon is a sone / or a child / which is planted or oned / or
set with charity. Nevertheless sothe it is / dyscrecyo^ has many children / or
sons / as a tree that has many bows or branches / but he yt gives life to
ye tree / and to ye branches / is ye root / so yt it be planted in ye earth
of meekness / which is mother and norce of charity / where this sone and tree
of dyscrecyon is set and planted. Orels it were no virtue of dyscrecyon / and
also it should not bry^ge quycke scuyte / but it were planted in virtue of
mekenes For mekenes comes of ye knowy^ge which a soul has of himself. I
said to the yt the root of dyscrecyon was a man's very knowing of himself
and of my goodness. Therefore an high dyscrecyon is it / yt each man ye^^e to
each state yt longs to hy^ / and pryncypally ye^^y^ge me praysynge and glory
to my name. To me also he yeldeth all goods and gifts of graces / the which
gifts and graces / he knows well and sees / yt he has received the^ of my
goodness. And yet he unkindly yeldeth the^ to himself. Also sometime he
knows and sees yt he has deserved no being of himself / his being he
knows well / he has had of me by a synguler grace yt grace and all other
graces which he has above himself / he should yeldethe^ to me / and not to
himself. Wherefore he consydereth hy^ unkind / yt he yeldeth not tha^kynges
for my benefytes / and yt so necly gohtly he has mysse spended his time / and
mysse used the graces which he has received / therefore he yeldeth him worthy
to have endelesse pains. Than after this by dyscrecyo^ / in his defautes he
has an hatered / and a dyspleasau^ce to hy^self. This virtue of dyscrecyo^
wha^ a man has knowing of himself / he works full besyly / if it be
grounded with very meekness / for if his meekness were not in ye soul (as it
is said before) tha^ were it dystroyed / which indyscrecyon is set in pride /
as dyscrecyo^ is set in meekness. Therefore he yt is thus dystroyed feleth
vndyscretely my worship as a these / and holds al to hy^ self yt comes
from / and yt is his / he gives to me sorowynge and grutchynge pryuely in
speech of my pryuy workings / and pryuytes / and is sclau^dred i^ me / and in
his neighbor in all things yt I work in him / and in all my creatures / but
they yt use and ben rooted co^tynually in ye virtue of dyscrecyon / worken ye
contrary / for after time they have given me again that longs to me / and
given to themself / yt longs to the^. Tha^ at the last they give to their
neighbor / ye pryncypall debt of charity / and of meke affection / and of
contynuall prayer. This det is dew each to other / and not only this
pry^cypall det of charity / and of affection and of prayer / but also techynge
and examplyfyenge of a right holy and honest life / and gyuynge counsel and
help to each of your neighbors (as ye may) and as ye se it spedefull to
each man's need / as I said in other matters before. For in each state yt a
man is set / whether he be lord / prelate / or soget / if he use this virtue /
what he does in charity and parts forth to his neighbor / he does than
dyscretely and with charity in good intent / for dyscrecyo^ and charity ben
knytte and planted together in ye ground of mekenes / which meekness comes
of the knowing that a man has of himself. Asymylytude how charity / mekenes
and dyscrecyon / ben oned together. Daughter these three virtues abyde^ together /
and ben so joined with outen any end / as you sees arounde cyrcle set about ye
earth / and as there came out a tree in the mids of ye cyrcle / with a young
spry^ge comy^ge out beside the tree. Understand tha^ first by this example /
ye love is norysshed in the earth / which earth conteyneth the largeness of
the cyrcle / for if it were without the earth / ye tree should be deed / and
should bry^ge forth no fruit / till it were planted. Right so think yt a
soul is a manner tree / which comes out of love / therefore ye soul that is
the tree may not be norysshed / but of a love of the soul / oned to the great
love of god. Sothe it is that if ye soul have not dyuyne love of parfyte
charity / it brings not forth lyfely fcuyte / but deedly. Therefore it is
spedefull that ye root of the tree (yt is to say) love / or desire of the
soul abide in the earth / and so show him out / and and come forth fro the
cyrcle / by ye very knowing of her self. Which knowing is vndersto^de^ in
me which have no begy^ny^ge / nor end as a cyrcle that is all roude. The
while a man gothe about in a cyrcle / he fyndeth no beginning / nor end /
and yet he is i^ the cyrcle. This knowing of himself / and of me / he fyndeth
in himself / and abides vp^ the earth of very meekness / which knowing is
no less / than ye greatenesse of the cyrcle (that is to say) yt knowing
which he had of himself knytte and fastened i^ me / is no less tha^ ye
gretenesse of ye cyrcle / as it is said before / or else it were no cyrcle
without end / and without beginning / but abiding / which knowing he
should have / if he had begone to to know himself. And than at ye last that
knowing should end in confusyon / if it were not oned in me. Thus than of all
this that is said before / you may se yt the tree of charity is norysshed in
meekness / bringing out of him beside ye tree an ympe of perfyte dyscrecyo^.
The marum of the tree (yt is to say) of ye loving charity / when it waxes
and grows in the soul. Than is that marum the pasyence / which is an open
and euyde^t toke^ / and an open showing / yt I live and wax in the soul /
and yt the soul is conformed in me. This tree when it is meryly planted / it
burgyneth with sweet smelles / or sweet flowers of virtues / with many and diverse
savors / and bry^geth forth fruit of diverse graces to ye soul. That same
soul yeldynge to his neighbor the fruit of profit after ye need of my
servants which have will to receive such ghostly fruit. It yeldeth also to
me tha^ kings / and presynges to my name. And this he does / for asmoche as I
have brought him out of ye earth. And fro yt time for ward / be goes till he
come to the end (that is to say to me) which am a durable life without end
/ for I may not be take away fro him but he will himself. For all the
fruytes which come^ out of such a tree ben fast ned with dyscrecyon / and oned
together. How bodyly penance / and other bodyly excersyses / sholden be taken
for an instrument to come to virtues / and not for the pryncypall affeccyo^.
^Orther more I show to ye here / that these ben the fruytes and works /
which I abide to receive of a soul (that is to say) experyence of virtues in
the time of oportunyte. Therefore I say to the / and long time before this I
said to the / if thou will remember the / what time thou did covet to do great
penance for me / and said. Lord what might I do to do penance for the. And
tha^ in thy soul / and in thy my^de / I answered the and said. I am he the
whidelyte me in few words / and i^ many good works / and that I should show
more largely / and more clearly / that he was not much acceptable to me / the
which only called me with the sown of words / and said thus. Lord / lord
/ I would do somewhat for the. Also another he that coueteth to grieve his body
for me with many penau^ces / without that he forsake his own will. But I did
covet many works / in suffrynge manly and meghtly all things with pasyence /
and in other virtues / diverse and many of the soul inwardly / the which I
have told and rebersed to the before / and how that all such inwardly
workings worken and bryngen, fourth fruytes of grace. All other works done
in any other manner than is said before / I hold them not worthy to be called
/ but only the sown of words / for such works have an end I that have no
end / I ask worky^ges which have no end. My will is that ye deeds of
penance / and of diverse other excercyses the which ben bodyly / be take and
used for an instrument of virtue / but not for the pryncypall desire nor intent
to that / for if the pryncypall effect of love were set there / than should be
yielded to me the thing that has end. And that should be seen thereby for as a
word that comes fro the mouth / yt when it is passed forth vndyscretely /
it is naught. But if yt word were said with effect of the soul / which
effect conceyueth and bry^geth forth virtues in sothefastnes. For if a work
yt has end / which I call a word / were oned to me with virtue of charity /
tha^ were it pleasynge to me / and acceptable / for than it should not be alone
/ but coupled with the selyshyp of very dyscrecyon. Reason would that there were
a head / and a beginning only in penance / and in ethe other bodyly worky^ge.
For as it is said before / they ben deeds that have end An end they have /
for wha^ they den done in time / or for a time that nathe end / and what for a
man yt must sometime leave the^ / for sometime he leueth them of necessyte /
because he mayemot parforme yt was begone for accydentall or casual. Things
or causes which comen in yt time / as parauenture by obedyence / because his
prelate will not suffer hy^ / for if he vred such penance agay^st his prelates
will or suffraunce / he should not only have no merit for vettu / but sooner
and rather he should do sin / and offend me. Therefore thou mayeses that all
such works have an end. A man should take them as for to use them i^ time /
but not for pryncypall beginning / for if it were taken so / as for a
pry^cypall beginning / than of necessyte / he must sometime leave it. And when
it were forsaken and lest of / tha^ should the soul stand alone / and void
as of any merit. This shows well saint Paul wha^ he said thus / mortyfy ye
your bodyly ly^mes which ben on the earth / fornycacyon / uncleanness /
lechery / and evil concupyssence (yt is to say) mortyfy ye so your lymmes / yt
ye may refrain your body wha^ it will strive against the spyryte. That will
of the flesh must be all deed / and soget utterly to my propre will / and
such a will of a creature is mortyfyed i^ a dew manner (as it is said before)
ye which dew manner / yt virtue of dyscrecyon gave to the soul (yt is to say)
dyscrecyon gave hate and dyspleasaunce of yt offenses of his own sensualyte /
ye which hatered he purchased first by knowy^ge of himself. This is yt sharp
sword yt cutteth and sleeth each man's porpre love / yt is grounded i^ his
own propre will. Such me^ yt thus sleen their propre love / yelde^ to me
contynually, (not only words) but many good works in ye which I have delight
and am pleased. Therefore I said to the yt I loved few words / and many
works Wha^ a man says many words / I no^vre the^ not. For yt love / and
desire of yt soul / which gives life to all other virtues / shall have yt
thing ye which has none end. And yet I despise not words utterly.
Nevertheless I said I would yt had few words shewy^nge to the that all
penance which has end / was an actual doy^ge / therefore I called such
penance / few words. Nevertheless they pleasen me / so they be take or used
as for an instrument of virtue / and not for the pryncypall virtue. Therefore a
man should not deame an other man in hyer degree of parfeccyon / which greueth
his body with many penau^ces / nor an other man in less degree of parfeccyon /
which does less penance or none. For as I have said / it is not their
virtue nor merit. For ill it were than to them / that for reasonable causes be^
let / and done not such actual penance. But the merit abides only in the
virtue of charity / which is made fair with the light of dyscrecyon / or else
it should not profit. Dyscrecyon yeldeth to me this love without end / and
without manner (that is to say) another in this manner / nor in that / but
without manner. For in asmoche as I am yt sovereign everlasting goodness /
dyscrecyon puts no law / nor term / nor manner to that love / with the
which he loves me Nevertheless as agay^ste hig neighbor / dyscrecyon puts
an ornate love and charity / for the light of dyscrecyo^ which comes out of
charity / gives an ornate love to his neighbor / and yt is gyuy^ge such a
charity to other / yt he give him no cause of sin / but keeps him fro sin
to his power / yt he map profit to his neighbor. For if a man did only one
sytie / so yt by yt trespass al yt world should escape fro yt pain of hell / or
else so yt some great virtue should come thereof / than were not their charity
ordained with dyscrecyon / but rather it were indiscreet. For it is not lawful
to do any virtue / nor virtuous thing to thy neighbor / with any medlynge of
sin / but holy dyscrecyon is ordained in this manner. Wha^ a soul yt is besy
/ and ordained myghtly in all his my^ghte and streynghe me to serve / loving
his neighbor with good affection of love / and dyspyseth his bodyly life for
health of souls / or to suffer pains or turme^tes a thousand times if it
were need and possible / so yt by yt his neighbor might receive the light of
grace. And forthermore he puts his substa^cy all te^porall good / to do
profit to ye bodies of his neighbors / all this works the light of holy
dyscrecyon / ye which light comes out of charity Also thou may well se / yt
dyscretely each soul which desires grace which is infynyte (that is to
say) that has no end / shall ye elde to me a love without any mean (that is
to say) he shall yield me a love / whithe only shall come of specyal grace
and only for god. He shall love also his neighbor with a love oned to my
love / ye which has no end. But that love shall be with a manner / and with
a mean / as with the order of charity coming toward himself / for yt
profit of an other without any sin. And of this saint Paul taught you to
begin first charity at yourselfe / or else it were to no parlyte profit. For
when there is no parfeccyon in the soul / althynges ben vnparfyte / both he
yt works in himself / and in other It were not co^uenye^t yt I should be
offended of my creatures / which am the goodness of all things / the which
have none end / and than my creatures with such offens should be saved / which
have end / and be^ made and formed only of my goodness. Se tha^ well that
thou shall in no manner way do any syfte / this knows well very charity / for
charity bears with him the light of holy dyscrecyon / she is ye very light
that lyghtneth all derknesse / and does away ygnorau^ce. Also it makes all
virtue / and each actual instrument of virtues is made of her. She has also a
manner prudence / which may not be dysceyued / she has a streynghe yt may not
be overcome She has also a parseueraunce in yt end / which draws fro
heaven in to dry earth (that is to say) fro the knowing of me / to a man to
know himself. Also fro my charity / in to the charity of his neighbor. It
gothe about with very meekness / and throw her prudence she ouerpasseth yt
grynnes of fe^des / and of other creatures (that is to say) with suffrynge of
wrongs and aduersytes. Also with this glorious light / a man shall overcome
the flesh and the fend / for by that he knows his own freylte. For wha^
that is known / he gives hate to himself / refrenynge and dyspysy^ge
himself / holding hy^ under the foot / and so does co^tpnu in dyspysynge of
himself / than is he made lord of all (yt is to say) he has vyctory of al
/ as of the flesh / and of the fend. Here is a repetycyon of words spoken
of before / and how god promised to his servants refresshynge and comfort of
reformacyon to holy church / with medyacyon of penance / and pasyence i^
aduersyte. Now daughter thou may se / that I which am ye high sothefastnes /
have showed to yt a truth and a doctrine / whereby thou shall go to the most
highest parfeccyon / if you keep my techynge. Also I have declared to yt before
how that satysfaccyo^ for sin and for pain / may be fulfilled both ^ yt /
and in thy neighbor. And there I showed the / yt no penance whis the a deedly
body may suffer (that is to say) that pain only is not suffycyent to make
satysfaccyon for sin / but it be oned and joined with desire / or with the
affection of charity / and with very true contrycy on / and great
dyspleasaunce of sins. While yt penance is knytte to charity / than that
penance makes satysfaccyon / not by the virtue only of actual pain / which
a ma^suffreth / but for sorrow that a man has for sin / and for the merit
of his charity / the which charity a soul has purchased with a light heart
/ and with a lyberall / and fre light of intelleccyo^ / beholdy^ge in me wh^the
am yt charity. All this I ordained to be showed to the / for mekely and
fervently thou vyde ask a will to suffer penance bodyly for thyselfe and for
all other. Therefore I have showed to the / yt thou and my other servants
should know how and in what manner ye shall make sacryfyce of yourselfe. For
that sacryfyce must be actual / and oned together by might. Right as a vessel
is oned to the water / the which shall be presented to a lord. For yt water
may not be presented without a vessel. Also if yt vessel be presented to a
lord without water / it is not acceptable to the lord. Right so I say to you /
that ye shall offer up to me / a vessel full of actual labors in such manner
as I will grant you that ye shall offer / not in such manner as you will
your self / but by such manner as I will put it to you / ye not chosy^ge
place / nor time nor labors / this vessel shall be full / for all men shall be
supported of you with very pasyence / and affeccyo^ of love / suffrynge and
supporting defautes on your neighbors / with hate and dyspleasaunce of sin.
Than may these be take for labors / and called labors / which I purposed to
the. For a vessel full of the water of my great grace / shall gyuelyfe to
souls And than I take to me this present of my amyable spouses (yt is to
say) of each soul which saythefully does me service. I receive of the^
their fervent desires / their teeres / their syghy^ges / and their meke
co^tynuall and devout prayers / which be^ in a manner yt mean and way
bytwyxe the^ and me. For throw yt love the which I have to the^ / they maken
the^ wrothefull upon mine enemies (that is to say) upon wicked men / which
every day full grievously offe^de^ me. Therefore shode ye stydefastly / and
suffte myghtly unto the death / and that shall be a toke^ that ye shall love me
in all truth and sothefastnes. Ye shall not turn the heed behodynge the
ploughe backwarde / for no dread of any creature / or of any aduersyte / but ye
shall rather Iope in trybulacyo^s. The world makes joy i^ much wrong that
is done to me / but ye that been yet in the world / shall be sorry of the
wrongs / and of the offenses done to me / throw the which ye all off^den me.
And they that been wicked men offende^ you. Your offense done to me / which is
mine offense / for I am made one with you. Thou may well parceyue in thy wit /
yt when my image / and symylytude / or likeness was given to the / and wha^
grace was lost by dute for sin / while I lived in yt / and with yt / I hid
my nature i^ thy humanite / by ye which I gave again to the / yt grace that
was lost. And so ye being in my image / I took your likeness wha^ I took
man's nature. Also I am one with you / but ^f yt soul go fro me by deedly
sin. But he that loves me / dwells i^ me / and I in hy^. Therefore the
world parsueth him for yt world has no conformynge with me / and therefore he
parsueth mine only sone to yt most cruel death of yt cross. And so he
parsueth you to the death / for he loves not me / for if yt world had loved
me / he should have loved you. But be ye joyful / for your joys shall be
fulfilled i^ heaven. Also I tell the that yt more yt sclaunders / and try
bulacyons encreasen in the ghostly body of yt mother of holy church / yt more
shall he have of sweetness / and of comfort afterward. This softness of
sweetness / and the sweetness of softness / shall be the reformacyon of
curates and good heddes of holy church / which ben the flowers of glory / for
in yeldynge to my name glory and laud / they show out the savor of
sweetness of virtues / which be^ founded in sothefastnesse. And this is the
sothefastnesse and softness of sweet ftoures. That is to say / the
recormacyon of my mynysters / and curates. Not for yt fruit of this spouse
(that is to say) of the church needs to be reformed / for the fruit is not
dystryed / and it is nevertheless / by the defautes of the mynystres. Thus you
/ and thy ghostly fader / and my other servants shall coye in aduersyte and
bytternesse. For I that am everlasting sothefastnesse / have promised to give
to you refresshynge. And after such sharp'enesse and bytternesse / I shall
comfort you in the reformacyon of holy church / by'cause ye suffre^ many
contrarytes for my love.

The.iiii. chapter is how that the workynge of ye blyssed soul of this maid
by yt answer of our lord / both increased and failed in yt bytternesse of
her soul / and how that she made her prayer for his holy church / and for his
people / and of other matters i^ the same chapyter / as it is rehearsed to you
before in the calendar. Ca. iii.
After this holy techynge of our lord / the soul of this maid was kyndeled
and sore styred by a great desire in to the love of god / and taking head /
and knowing his plentuous charity / which charity with great comfort and
sweetness / ordained to make an answer to her petycyon / gyuynge a trust and
hope of remedy to her / which she desired / which was to the bytternesse of
her soul / which she had received for offenses done to her maker / and for
harm done to holy church and for her own mysery which she conceived throw
knowledge of her self. Which hope of remedy swaged yt inward bytternesse /
which she had conceived. And tha^ was showed to her by yt everlasting fader /
yt was so offended / what way of parfeccyo^ they should use / and do
satysiaccyo^ for their own offenses and for their neighbors / as shall be
more clerly showed after. Right parfyte is the knowledge which a soul has
of herself / by the which she knows her god the better / tyght well feeling
the goodness of god in her / and in the holy and amyable myrtour / or
beholdynge of god / she knows her own unworthiness / and the high
worthynesse of her god which formed her and made her of nough^e / seeing well
herself the image of god / not of dewte / but only of specy all grace. Also
the beholdynge in the myrrour of the high dyuyne goodness / this soul knews
her own unworthiness / in to which unworthiness she fell / throw her own
defaute and sin. For right as a spotte / or fylthe in a man's vysage / may
lightly be parceyued in a myrrour / so a soul which with a very knowy^ge of
herself she lyfted up her intent and affection by a fervent desire / to
behold inwardly / with the eye of her ghostly intelleccyon / to se herself in
the holy myrrour of god / by the which suparuysyon / she parceyued more tha^
ever she did the foul spots of her soul / throw the great pureness / or
clerenesse / which she had in the sight and knowing of god. And in asmoche as
this comfortable knowing and desire / with an inward bytternesse / for
offense to god / was greatly knytte together within the foresaid soul / yet
throw the hope the which our lord had put in her / the bytternesse and the
mourning was lassed and decresed in her. And right as a fire encreseth wha^
fuel is added thereto / so the fire of love ye which was oned to god / waxcd
so greatly i^ her soul / that it had not ben possible her life to remain with
her body / but yt the soul must pass fro the body / but yt she was preserved
with strength above nature / only of him of whom comes all strength / or
else she might never have escaped with the ly^ hy poss^byly te. Therefore wha^ this
soul was thus puryfyed / with thefyre of the dyuyne charity / which she
found in the knowing of herself / and of ger god / and when that holy desire
/ with hope of man's faluacyon / and hope of resormacyon of holp church was
thus encresed in her / an^ne she lift up her heart with a geete love before the
fader in heaven / which had showed her the mysery of yt world / and yt foul
i^ fyrmyte of holy church and much like to yt word of Moses she spoke to
our lord and said thus. My lord turn thy merciful eyes to thy people /
and to ye ghostly body of holy church / for i^ sparynge so many creatures /
and in gyuynge the^ the light of knowing / much yt more thy name shall be
gloryfyed of all thy creatures / ye which sholden give presynges to the /
parceyuy^ge and beholdy^ge / how by thy endelesse goodness / they have scapen
from the bo^des of deedly sins / and from parpetuall pa^pnacyon. And wha^
they known what grace thou hase done to me (a wretch) ye which so greatly
have offended thy majesty / and I knowledge me the most cause of al me^nes
sins. Therefore lord I pray thy dyuyne charity / that you take no grefe with me
/ and spare thy people / I shall never go fro the presence till I se yt have
merey on thy people What were it to me to have ^yte and to se thy people have
death / or yt derkenesse should arise ^^ thy spouse holy church / which is the
pryncypall light / for my defautes / and for other defautes of thy creatures.
Therefore lord my will is / and I ask this petycyon of thy special grace /
which styrred yt to form me / and to make man of naught to thy image and
likeness / when you said (make we man to our image and to our likeness) and
this you did holy and ever being trynyte / willing man to be partener of all the holy trynyte. And for this cause / you gave to man a mind or a memory / with
ye which he should keep and remember thy benefytes in the which mind a man
should be partener of thy might / which art the ever being fader. Also thy
goodness gave unto man intelleccyon / by the which he should se how you
departes the wisdom of thy only sone with man. And you gave hy^ a will / yt he
should love yt thing yt his intelleccyo^ did feel / or know / and you parted
with hy^ ye mercy and benygnyte of thy most parfyte sothefastnesse of thy holy
spyryte of god. O lord what was the cause yt thou hase set and put man in so
great a dygnyte? Lord none other cause / but a love vnestytnable / where with you
beheld thy creature in thyselfe / and to him thou gave a love / and a synguler
pleasau^ce Therefore you made that creature and formed hy^ only for love /
gyuynge to him a being / yt he should Joy with the / in thy euerlasty^ge
goodness Moreover lord I se that thy creature sost his dygnyte / for ye
which you exyled him / by his own defaute and sin which he did. And for
that sin / he came in to hatered with thy suffrau^ce / for by his trespass /
all we became thy enemies. Therefore lord wha^ thou was ltyrted by ye bre^nynge
love / with ye which thou made us al of naught / to yt entente that you would
recounsyle mankind which became in to yt great petell of endelesse death.
Than it plesed the to put thy only sone (which is thy word) in yt mids of
yt world which suffered and bare on hy our sorrows (which we dyde^ deserve)
yt maden the offens / and he was to yt that art the endelesse fader made
obedyent / and as yt enjoined and commanded hy^ / wha^ you clothed him with our
humanyte / wha^ he took our nature and ye likeness of man. O holy depernesse
of charity / which may not be thought / what heart is there (and if it were as
hard as a marble stone) yt may se himself / but that it must be opened /
co^syderynge his comy^ge fro so hye a place / to one so low (as is our
humanyte) full of mysery. Doubtelesse we ben made to thy pmage / and also thou
art of our likeness / throw yt union which thou made in man / hydynge and
covering thy endeles godheed / with yt vile slyme of earth or corrupcyon of
Adam. Lord what was yt cause of this? Truly love was yt cause thee of. O god
thou art made man / and man is made as god. For this holy love that is given
to us thy creatures / so full or delectacyon and plesau^ce (replete with thy
grace) lord I beseech the / to give mercy to thy synful creatures. Here
shows of the holy sacrament of yt auter / and of the benefyte of his
incarnacyon. THan our blyssed lord / almighty god full of pity / turned his
merciful eye to this maid / and he suffered her teeres to be constrained / and
to be bound with the chains of her holy desire / and therewith speaking to her
/ and with a lamentacyon / began thus to say. Louy^ge daughter thy teeres
strenen me / for they ben knytte with my charity / and shed for my love / and
your fervent desire by^deth me. But daughter behold ye face of my amyable
spouse (that is to say) holy church / how it is defaced / and foul spotted /
as yt face of a lepre is blowe^ / or swolle^ of their own unclean living /
and of their sorry desire of auaryce / and of their foul couetyse / yt may not
be quenched in them. I mean yt courtyse of those me^nes goods / to ye which
her teeres given milk / yt is to yt cryste^ people of each relygyo^ / and to
yt ghostly body of the mother of all holy church. This yt I speak is of my
mynysters of yt church / they be^ those which ben norysshed of yt sweet milk
/ and not only they / but all yt christen people should be nourysshed of those
holy breasts. But daughter sees you not with how great ygnoraunee / and with so
great blyndnesse / and with so many unkindness / and with unclean hands / this
holy milk / and glorious blood is mynyftred. This blood gives all thing yt
longs to man's health / and all things it works yt longe^ to man's
perfeceyon / so yt he ye which receives it be well dysposed in soul (yt blood
I say) right as it gives life / and endoweth a soul with all garce (both more
and less) after yt dysposycyon and affection of the receyuer. Right so it
gives death to him yt lives evil and wyckedly / as for his part that
receives it / if he receive it unworthily (yt is to say) with the fylthe of
deedly sins / tha^ it brings in to him death / and not life Not throw
defaute of that glory ous blood / for there may no fault be found / nor
throw yt defaute of yt mynystres / all be it they be^ i^ yt same defautes / or
in greater sins / for their sins can not dystroye that gracyous blood / nor
wtdraweth the grace nor virtue. Therefore yt blood harmeth not hy^ to whom it is
given but yt wickedness of his syn^e harmeth hy^ / and loses hy^ / and
bry^geth hy^ to pain / but he amend hy^ with very co^trycyon / and dysplesaunce
of his sins. I say that he the which receives it unworthily, does harm to
himself / not in the defaute of the blood / nor in the mynystre / but throw
his evil dysposycyons and defautes / ye which maken foul his soul and body
with so many and so great wretchydnesse and uncleaness / and throw his malice
/ yt he had such cruelte to himself / and to his neighbor. Cruelte he has
to hy^self / put ty^ge away or wtdrawy^ge his grace / tredynge it under yt fete
of his affeccyons / yt fruit of that holy blood. Which fruit he took of the
holy baptym / and yt time were washed away the foul spots of orygynal
sin / ye which fylthe he did take when he was conceived of fader and
mother. And this washing away was by the virtue of that holy blood / which
fruit he took of yt holy baptyme / and at yt time all ye were clean wasshe^ /
therefore I have given you my word (yt is my sone) because yt nature of
mankind was corrupt / throw yt sin of yt first man Adam. So yt all ye
were corrupt vessels of yt nature / and not dysposed to receive everlasting
life. And for yt / I which am above al things / have ordained an union / and
joined / and coupled / with the foul nature / of your humanyte / to yt intent
that remedy should be given to the corrupcyon / and to the death of mankind /
and that I should restore that nature to grace / which man had lost throw
syn^e. The ryghtwysenesse of god / asks of mankind to suffer condynge pain
for this syn^e which man might not suffer / nor bear / for man only was not
suffycyent to make satysfaccyon for that forfet / and to restore grace. For if
he should have made satysfaccyon lony point / yet he should have done it for
himself / and not for other reasonable creatures / notwithstondy^ge yt he
might not do satysfaccyon for himself / nor for other / for yt sin and
trespass was done agay^ste me / which am infynyte goodness. And therefore I
willing to restore man which might not do satyssaccyon (as it is said
before) and for because yt man was come into so great devylyte. I beholdy^ge
fro above / se^de my sone to be clothed with your nature (wherwt ye be^) yt is
with yt nature of Adam / that hesn yt nature / which nature had offended /
should suffer pain / and pease / and swage my wroth / fuffrynge in his body
horrible pains / in to the death of the most cruel death of the cross. And
so I made a faith to my right wysenes and fulfilled my dyuyne mercy / which
mercy would do satysfaccyon to man's trespass / and dyspose him to the blyssed
goodness / to the which I made him / and formed hy^. Also you shall
understood yt the nature of man annexed / and knyte to yt dyuyne nature / was
able and mighty to make satysfaccyon for all mankind / not only throw the
pain / nor for the pain the which my sone suffered / in yt fynyte nature of
Adam. But throw yt virtue of dyuyne nature / by the vnyo^ of yt ever bey^ge
godhed did draw together ye one nature in to yt other. I received that
satysfaccyon / for the sin of Adam / and for man's sin / and the sacryfyce
of my sons blood / oned and foyned with dyuyne nature / throw yt fire of my
dyuyne charity. Which charity was this / for your sins he was sold / to a
pyller bound / scourged / fyled in yt face with spytre / buffyted / and on the
cross crucyfyed. By these pains with many more / the nature of mankind was
mighty to make satysfaccyon for man's sin / only by the virtue of the dyuyne
nature. By this / yt sin of Adam was wasshe^ clean. But yet he left a toke^
of syn^e (yt is to say) a freylte / or redynesse to fall i^ sin / and other
defautes of the body / like to a token of yt wound / which is seen after the
wounded is heled. Right so the leche mine only sone / has delivered yt sour
wound of yt seek man Adam / wha^ he drank yt most bitter drink / and such a
drink yt no man might taste / nor drink. Also he was to you a true lord and
master / which suffered a full bitter medyeyne / as gall / which was to yt
pain of a cruel death / throw the streynghe of the godheed / oned to your
nature / because he would save you and give you life / i^ asmoche as ye were
made feeble throw your sin. The token and the mark of orygynall sin is
left only with you / which mark you took of your fore faders / when ye were
begoten of them / which token or mark is done away partly fro yt soul /
but not all. For there remains yt holy baptym / ye which baptym has a
great virtue / gyuy^ge yt life of grace throw the virtue of this precious and
glorious blood. Anon as yt soul is clothed and kyuered with this holy baptym
/ yt orygynal syn^e is washed away / and a special grace is put in to that
soul. And yt redynesse to enclyne to sin / which enclynynge is the mark /
and the token that byleueth still / of the orygynall sin / is remedyed by
virtue of yt holy blood / as it is said before. And the soul may reftayne that
freylte if she will / for than yt soul is open to receive grace in to herself
more or less / as she will dyspose her with these affeccyons and desires / to
have a will to love me / and serve me And in the same manner she may turn
herself to evil / as well as to good / not withsto^dynge yt she has taken
the grace of baptym. Wherefore after time / she comes to the gyuers of
dyscrecyon / because she has a fre choice to turn to good or evil /
therefore she may use good / or evil / as she is styred of her own fre will.
And that fredome of will that a man has / is so very much / and made so
strong by virtue of this precious blood / yt yt fend may not compel him to do
the leest sin / nor no creature more / than he will himself. He is come^ to
yt goodness of fredome / and all seruage voyded / yt he should if he will / be
lord and have domynacyon of his own propre sen sualyte / and have yt blyssed
end / to ye which he was made and formed. O wretched mysery of man / the
which somoch delyteth hy^ i^ a foul sloughe / as an unreasonable best / and
knows not me / nor will not know lege yt great gifts / the which he has
of me / so full he is replete with ygnorau^ce. For more than this / no wretched
creature may receive.

How that sin is more greuousli punisshed after cry stes passion / than
before / and how god does promise us to show us mercy i^ this tra^sytory
world / and to the holy church / by the menes of good and holy prayer with
penau^nce. Ca. v.
Daughter therefore I will that thou know ye grace which deedly men dyde^
receive when they were reformed of me / i^ ye precious blood of my sone / I
restored the^ to grace (as I have said) and mankind knows not / nor
knowlegeth not ye grace / but ever he enclyneth from evil to worse / psuynge
me always with infynyte wrongs / setting at naught ye graces which ben given
to him / and which I give hy^dayly / and often. Not only yt they acounte it
not to grace / that is given them / which is much worse / but rather it
seems to them yt they have wrong / as though I should have desired of them
much other things / than satysfaccyo^ for their sins.. And I say to the /
yet it shall be much harder with the^ / for asmoche as they sholden be worthy
greter pains. And so now after the time / that they have taken the redempcyo^
/ by the blood of my sone they sholden be punysshed ye more sharply / than
before redempcyon. That is to say / ye before Adams (...) should be washed
away / it was worthy and ryghtfull / that he that much received / should yield
much again / and more should be bound to by^ / of whom he received somoche A
man was much bound to me of his being / that I gave hy^ such a gift to
make him to my image and to my likeness / he was therefore bound and beholden
/ to yield again tha^kynges to me. But he takes fro me the thankynges / and
holds it to himself / wherefore he trespaseth against the obedyence which
was taken to him in charge / and in that he is now made mine enemy. And I by
ye virtue of meekness have dystroyed his pride. For by meekness / I have loved
dyuyne nature / taking your humanyte. And so I have delivered you / and
drawn you from the captynyte of the fend. And not only that fredome should
be given to you of me / but if you behold right well / man is made as god /
and god is man throw the couplynge of one heed of dyuyne nature / in the
nature of your humanyte. O debt that they toke^ / and for which they owen to
yield tha^ky^ges / is ye tresure of my sons blood / whereby they be^ reformed
to grace. Se also how much they ben bound to yield me thanky^ges after their
redempcyon / more than before. Now for their redempcyon / they ben bound to
yield to me laud and thankynges / following ye steps of my sone / which was
incarnate / and than they gave me my debt for themself / and for the love of
their neighbor / with true and pryte virtues / as it is said before. So
that they that done it not / for asmoche as they ben much bound to love me /
they fallen in to ye more grievous offenses. Therefore of ye dyuyne
ryghtwysenesse / they fallen in to more grievous pains / and I yield to them
everlasting pain. Wherefore a false christian man shall be punysshed more
grievously than a paynym / by the ryghtwysenesse of god. The paynefull flame of
fire brenneth them withouten wasty^ge and so they feel afflyccyo^ and turme^t /
throw full cruel fretynges and bytynges of their own conscience / and yet ye
fire wastes them not. For they that been dampened / losen not their being / for
any turment that they have. So that sin is punysshed / much more after
redempcyon / than before / because man had received more of grace / and it is
not seen that they take any head thereof / nor besy them therefore to abstain
them / nor to withdraw them fro their wickedness. Therefore such ben made
mine enemies / for as much as I recounseyled the^ with the blood of my sone /
and they rewarde^ it not But yet one remedither is / which I have ordained to
pease and swage my wroth (that is to say) by the mean and help of my
seruautes. They known well how I am constrained with their charytable
business / and with their teeres / and how they bind me with their fervent
desires. And thou daughter knows well / that thou hase bound me with that
chain / which I gave to the / when thou did desire me to give so great a
mercy to the world. And therefore to my worship and for health of souls / I
gave to my servants a great ghostly hongre / and a fervent desire / that
when I am constrained with their teeres / I may aswage ye freylnesse of my
ryghtwysenes. Bear therefore easly / and suffer thy teeres / and thy swerynge
labors / and draw the^ out / thou and my other servants / and with ye
plentuous see of my dyuyne charity / wasshe the and all them therewith / before
the face of my holy and amyable spouse / the which I call the church. For I
say to ye sothely / that their bewte shall be restored again to the^ / only
by this mean / the which I have showed to the. But they sholden not have that
same bewte again / another in the dread of swered / nor in great wars / nor
crueltes / but in a great desire of the goodness of pease / and contynuall
prayers / in meke and devout excercyses / in shedy^ge of holy teeres and in
the fervent desire of my servants. And so with pasyence / and with the
suffrynge of many and diverse trauayles / and co^trarytes / I shall fulfill
their great desire / if it so be that your pasyence shine out bright / as
light in ye derkenesse of wicked and deedly men. Therefore dread you no thing /
though the world parsu you al day / for I shall always be with you / and in
time of need / my prudence shall not fail you. How this soul knows somoche
of the goodness of god / prayed not only for christian people / and holy
church / but prayed also for all the world. AFter this techynge / that soul
arose with better knowledge than she had before / and with a full great
gladness and joy / stood for the before ye divine majesty / what for the hope
which was given to her of the mercy of god / and what for love the which she
had / beholdy^ge and considering / that throw holy desire and love / the
goodness of god has done merey / and ordained it to man / not with stondynge
/ ye man was become enemy to him. And i^ toke^ yt he would do mercy / he showed
a manner way to his servants by the which way / they myghten refrain and
make soft his wroth which he had to man. She was thanne toyfull in all
worldly parsecucyo^s / voydynge always all dread and myghtly took to her ye
streynghes of holy desire / to pray for all ye world in somoche yt she was not
full rested with yt she should have mercy only for all christian people / and
for all holy church / but ever with a great hope and trust / mekely she asked
mercy for all ye world. And not with stondynge / that her second petycyo^
contained the profit / both of untrue people out of the faith / and of all
christian / in the reformacyo^ of the church. Yet never the later she was so
desirous of the faluacyon of all / that her holy prayer and charyre thanne
stretchyd ab^ode to all the world / as god himself made her to ask the same
petycyon / which petycyon myghtly she asked with a loud voice / and said.
Holy god bow down the mercy / to thy ghostly flock of sheep / as a good and
a very crewe shepeherde. Lord hye the fast to help all the world / tarry not
to give them mercy / for now they latken grace. O gracyous lord the
sothefastnesse withouten end / it seems that man is pryued of thy charity
(that is to say) of the love the which should be grounded in ye charitably
loving themself together / and the above all. How that god made a compleynt on
his reasonable creatures / and specially for their own propre love / which
reygneth in them / where he styrreth the soul to prayers / and teeres. THa^
our lord was fore styrred to mercy and for our health / he ordained in this
soul / how her love and sorrow might be increased to help man's soul /
showing her with how great love he had mad the world (as it is said before)
and said to her thus. Thou sees how ye every man offends me / and I of my
goodness made them of naught / with ye flamme of great love / and how I have
endowed the^ with the gift of plentuous graces / and gifts with out no^bre /
only of my specyal grace and of no dewte. Behold daughter how that they gone
against me / with diverse / many / and innumerable sins / and daily done
offend me / and namely with their own wret chydnesse / and sinful living of
themself / of the which wicked love / comes out all sin and wickedness
With this this wicked love / all the world they have venymed. For right as my
love ye is onede to their love / with the love of their neighbor / holds and
keeps all sothefastnesse i^ them (as it is showed before) right so the
sencyble love holds in them / all evil and untruth and that love comes of
pride. So in the contrary wise / as my love comes of charity / so that falls
love co^teyneth in the^ all evil. And this evil they do by ye mean of some
creature / that is not in very charity of his neighbor / for they louen not me
/ and they love not their neighbor. For those two loves must be knytte
together. Thus I said to the before / ye every good thing and every evil
thing / is done by some mean of his neighbor. In many other wyses I may make
my compleynt on man / for he received nothing of me but good / and he yeldeth
to me again hatered and does all evil. Therefore I said to the / ye I should
aswage my wroth / by the shedynge of my seruaun tes terres / and so I say to
the now again. Therefore ye that been my servants / tourne^ my dyuyne dome with
your devout prayers / and great desires / and with sharp and with byt ter
sorrows / for offenses done to me (and to their harms) and so my wroth shall
assuage. How no man may escape the hands of god / but he must abide his
ryghtwysnesse / or his mercy. Daughter know it for a truth / yt no man may
escape my hands / for I am he ye am everlasting being / ye be^ not nor have
no bey^ge of your self / but asmoche as ye have being of me / the whiam maker
and former of all things ye haue^ being / out take sin that is naught.
Because it is not made of me / therefore in no manner it is byloued. Therefore a
creature that is blinded he offends / for he loves that which he should not
(that is to say) sin / and has me in hate / whom he is bound to love. I
am all good / and I gave to man be ynge / with a fervent love / and he may not
escape from me / for of my right wysenesse / he shall abide here in my hands
and power for his sins / or here by my mercy and pity. There fore open thine
eyes of intelleccyon and behold my power / and you shall se / that it is true
that I said to ye Than she lift up her gostly eye / to obey to the fader in
heaven / and she saw i^ his hand all the world closed. Than our lord spoke
to her and said. Go daughter and se that no man may be take fro me (for as I
said) al those that abyden here / abyde^ of my ryghtwysenesse / or else of my
mercy. For all they be^ mine and al of me they have brought forth and I love
them more than may be spoken. Therefore not wtstondy^ge their wickedness / with
the help and good menes of my servants / I shall give them mercy. And for
thy great love / and also for thy great sorrow / I shall fulfill thy
peryeyon. How this soul when she swette water for a brennynge desire / in the
time of prayer / desired yt she might sweet blood. THis soul than for great
enerese of hely desire / was made blyssed / and fulfilled with an holy sorrow.
Blyssed she was / for the oneheed she made i^ gody tasty^ge and sauourynge his
goodness / all fulfyled woith Joy in his mercy. She was also fulfilled with
sorrow when she knew the high majesty of god / so greatly offended. And than
she gave tha^kynges to ye good nesse of god / and knowing ye same goodness /
and the manyfolde defautes of mankind / she rose quyckly as it had been fro
death / throw a great desire. And after this when she knew in herself / the
selynge of her soul / so wonderfully renewed in that ever beyngt godheed / that
her holy love / and delectable brenny^ge was somoche e^cresed / ye she swette
water throw the might and vyolence / ye which ye soul did to ye body. For
the oncheed which the soul made in god / was more parfyte than is ye bond of
the oneheed / bytwyxe the soul and the body. Therefore of ye streynghe of love
/ she had that swetynge hete / but she despised ye swerynge / for the affeccyo^
that she had / was with greare desire to have swe tynge to come out of her
body all of blood. And in that desire she spaketo her self / and said. Alas
my soul that thou hase lost thus ye time of this wretched life / and for the
loss of thy time / many harms and wyckednesses out of nombre have sall in all
the world / both partycu l^tly / and in common / and specially i^ all holy
church. Wherefore I will and desire / that thou remedy over all these harms /
with the sroety^ge of blood. Behold systren and se / how swetely that soul
has kept in my nd^ / the noble doctrine / e which ever being
sothefastnesse had raughte her / and betake her (that is to say) in knowing
herself and ye goodness of god in her / and spedefull remedies for reparacyon
of all the world / that were in perell of perysshynge / so that the Judgment
of god might be peased / and his wroth aswaged (that is to say) with holy /
contynuall / meke / and devout prayers. Aster all this / the soul was
compelled to rise more fervent ly throw an holy desire / and beheld her self
in wardly i^ the Dyuyne charity / with the eye of intelleccyon. In the which
charity / she sauoured and tasted / how much we be^ bound to love / and seek
/ and to purchase the glory / and the preysynge of ye name of god / for the
health of all men's souls. And to ye intent / she saw you servants of god
called and ordained (and specially to that) the good lord ever being
sothefastnes / had chosen her a ghostly sader / whom she presented before ye
dyuyne goodness / prayenge god inwardly / ye he should verily follow ye
sothefastnes / and ye he would show him a light of a special grace. How a
man may not plese god / but he bear tryvulacyons / with the virtue of pasyence.
THan our lord god answering to the third petycyon (that is to say) to the
perycyon / or desire the which right mekely she asked of god for the health of
souls / said to her thus. My daughter I will that thy ghostly fader / the
which thou hase now / parsue to my goodness / in fervent desire / and great
business / for the health of all souls. But he may not have that / nor thou
/ nor none other / but with pasyence in many parsecucyons. Also but as I will
grant you / as I said to the before. For right as ye des sire to se my worship
i^ holy church so ye sholde^ desire to love (...) suffer parsecucyons / with
very great pasyence. By that I shall parceyue that ^e (...) and my other (...)
and desyren my (...) in sothefastnesse / than be shall be to me a dear beloved
sone / and he and suthe other shall rest them full merely upon the breast of my
only begoten sone / of the which sone I have made a bridge / the which shall
receive him and althose that have ta (...) love / and they shall come (...) to
th^^ gra^^ and merry which they (...) and the one neighbor to (...) we other
^^ hym^^^ and be you sure and steadfast in (...) / and than dread you not / but
ye shall ascend upon this brydgs / and ever after that to live in joy / with
all the holy company of heaven.

Here now mother and systre^ e^deth the first part of your ghosty orcharde /
the which treteth (...) of meekness / dysccecyon / lone / charity / holt
desires and of palye^ce. These virtues fervently for them to la bour / for his
moders love he grant us all his dear blessing Amen.

The second book.
The first chapter of the second party / makes mencyon of a bridge how god
made a bridge of his love when the way of going to (...) was broke by
inobedyence of (...) by ye which bridge (...) people may suer / pass.
Also how god iduced and (...) this soul to behold the greatenes of this
bridge / that is to say / how it recheth fro ye earth to heaven. And here after
shat folo we of the same matter / as it is showed in the calendar before. Ca. i.


Daughter because I did say to the that I had made a bridge of my sone I will
that it be un known to you / ye the way of my be loved sone is broken / by
the inobedyence and trespass of Adam / in somoche ye no man might come to
euerlasty^ge life. And to me they gaue^ no tha^kynges / as they sholden have
done / and had no part of ye great goodness / for the which recoysynge of
bliss / I made the^ and formed the^ to my image and likeness. And for they
hsd not ye goodness / which I ordained for them / my sothefastnes was not
fulfilled / which sothefastesse is this / that I made that same man / for he
should have ever lasting life with me. And for he should savor and thst my
ever be y^ge goodness and sweternesse / and hethrowe his offense did trespass
against my co^mau^dyme^t / and so that sothefastnesse was not fulfilled. And
this myschefe befell / because ye foresaid sin had shut up heaven / and
closed the gate of my mercy. This same sin has gendren / and but gyned full
pryckynge thorns / and full many trybulacyons / with mfynyte grefes. This
creature found anon a rebellyon against himself and was made contrary to me
/ his flesh made a battle against ye spyryte / and there he lost the noble
state of innosency / and became as an unreasonable best. Each other creature
was to him rebel / where before that / they sholden have obeyed to him / yshe
had kept that innosency in him / in ye which I had made him. But sythen he
kept him not still in that state / but trespased against my obedyence /
therefore he deserved ever lasting death in soul and in body. Also of
trespass and sin / same forth an vny uetsall flode / the which smote him
always with his waters / and multyplyed many greuaunces. Also ye people bare
many great labors on themself of ye world / and of the devil in diverse and
many manners withouten no^bre / for ye which they were^ perysshed. For no man
might asce^de to ye ever bey^gelyfe / though he had be the most ryghfullest
liver at that time. Wherefore I desired to ordeyne a remedy against your
suylles / and now I have given you a bridge of my own sone / ye when you will
pass over that ftode / ye sholden not perysthe / which flode is a meruaplous
fervent see of this wretched life. Daughter sees you not / how much my creature
is beholden to me / and how much he is blinded with the unsteadfastness of
himself / in will to slay his soul / and not in will to take the remedy that
is ordained and given to him of me. How god induced and styrred this devout
soul / to behold the great nesse of this holy bridge (that is to say) how it
recheth fro earth to heaven. OPen noowe the eyes of thy ghostly intelleccyon /
and thou shall se deedly men by diverse manners made bly^de with ygnorau^ce. Thou
shall se imparfyte men / and parfyte men / ye which folowen me in
sothefastnesse / that thou may sorrow for the dampnacyon of wretches / and for
their ygneraunce / and that thou may joy for the parfeccyon of my well
beloved children. And thou shall se moreover ye diverse manners which some me^
holde^ / and what way they kepe^ yt gone in light / and ye manners of them that
gone in derkenes. But first I will that thou look the bridge of my sone / and
that thou behold in the inwardely the gretenes of that bridge / which recheth
fro ye heyghte of heaven / down to the earth (yt is to say) that the earth of
your humanyte / is oned to ye gretenesse of the godheed. And therefore I said
/ ye that bridge recheth fro the hyeheuen / to the low earth And that is of ye
oueheed which I have made in man / ye was nedeful (as I have said before) to
reform ye way ye was broken / ye ye myghten come again to life / and pass
over the bytternesse / and wretchedness of this world. He might not have been
only of ye earth / if he should be suffycyent to pass over the ftoode / and
take euerlasty^ge life. For ye earth of nature of man only / was not
suffyeyent to make a mendes for sin ye was done / nor do away the sin of
Adam / which dyshoneste and wyckeduesse / brought mankind in to thraldom
myschefe / and bytternesse / and drew out thereof / much foul / rote^ / and
stynkynge fylthe / as I have deelared before. Therefore it behooves needs to
bedned to ye heyghnes of my nature / the ever being godheed / that it might be
able to make satystaccyon to all mankind / so ye the kind of man should
suffer pain and that the dyuyne nature / oned to ye nature of man should so
accept to me the sacryfyces of my sone offered for you / that it should put
from you death / and give to you the ever lasty^gelyfe. Also the heyghte of ye
godheed / mekely did dysce^de to the earth (the vallaye of mysery) and than
of his great love / he loyned his godheed / with the heed of our humanyte /
and for the bitter penes that he suffered i^ this vallaye or place of mysery (as
crucyfyed / deed / and buried) for the trespass of Ada^ / for by those penes
(with many mo) ye bridge is mercyfully made / and the way that was broken /
gracyonsly edyfyed / and made new again. And why made he himself to be the
way? But ye ye sholde^ come to sothefastnes / and loye ever lasty^gely / with
the nature of angels And yet were it not suffycye^t for you to have ye life
(all be it my sone be the bridge) but it were so / ye ye die den pass by him.
How we ben al laborers / and ben send fro god to labor in ye vyneyerde of
holy church and how every man has a vyneyerde of himself. IN this party the
ever being sothefastnes showed that he made you without you / but he shall
not save you without you. He will give to you a fre will with a fre choice / to
spend your time in excersyce of virtues / or after the voluptuosyte of your
own mind. Therefore he added thereto and said. It behooves you al to pass by
that bridge / and to seek the laud and the glory of my name / for health of
souls / in suffrynge with great pene many great labors / and so follow the
steps of my sone / fuffre and bear you penes for his love / the which has
showed you so great love / for ye may not pass by none other way. Ye ben my
land tyllers and laborers the which I have hired / for ye sholden labor /
or besy you in the vyneyerde of your mother the holy church. Now ye done
labor and trauaylem the body of rely gyon (hired of me by a syn guler grace)
with the light of the holy baptym (given to you) which baptym ye token in the
ghostly body of holy church / throw ye hands of ye mynysters of your mother
the holy church. They plant in you a synguler grace / draweynge you out of
the pryckynge thorns of deedly sins. They ben my laborers and tyllers / in
the vyneyerde of your souls / fastened in the vyneyerd of ye mother holy
church. All manner of creatures that have reason in themself / they have a
vineyard of themself (that is to say) a vyneyerde of their souls / whose
wylles with a fre choice / shall be their tyller (for the space of their syfe)
for after this transytory life / they shall not have operacyo^s / or works /
no there good nor evil. While a man lives / he may till and labor in his
vyneyerde / to ye which I have brought him. And the tyller of the soul has
taken here so great a might / that another the fend / nor no creature lyuy^ge
/ may take away from him that strength / but he will himself. For wha^ he
takes the holy baptym / he becomes very strong / and than is given to him a
sword sharp on both the sides (that is to say) love of virtues / and hate of
sins / the which love and hate / he found in holy blood. For the very
great love of virtues / and for the great dysplesaunce of vices my sone
suffered death on the cross only for your redempcyon / and ye time he redeemed
you with his precious dlode / by the which ye ben brought out of the captyuyte
of the devil / by the virtue of the holy sacrament baptym. Also ye have a
sharp sword / with ye which sword while ye have time / ye sholden use withal
your dylygence / to dystroye thesechornes / and pluck them up by the roots /
and plant for them the hyghnes of virtues / for otherwise / yeshal not rereyue
the fruit of the blood / of christ's tyllers / which I have setle and
ordained in holy church / of ye which tyllers I have said to the before /
that they voyde^ away deedly synues / from ye vineyards of your souls. And
wha^ they dyde^ mynystre to you the holy blood of the sacrament ordeyued us
holy church / they gave you thanne grace. It behooves you therefore that ye
arise first by a meke co^try cyon of the heart / and by an high dyspleasaunce
of sins / and by lous of virtues / and than ye shall reccyue the fruit of
that holy blood / or else ye may not teceyue that holy fruit (as by your
part) for ye dysposed you not (as in the branches oned to the vine of my
only begote^ sone) the which said. I am the vine / and ye ben the branches
/ and my fader is the land tyller. I say to the that treuthe it is / for I am
a tyller / for all thing ye comes from / has being. My might is
inestymable / every man is governed by my might / and by my great virtue /
there is nothing done without me Also I am that tyller / ye which have pl^ated
a very vine of my sone in the ground of your humanyte that ye which ben the
branches joined with the vine / may bring forth fruit. And therefore he ye
brings not forth fruit of good works / shall be cut away from the vine
/ and shall wax dry. For wha^ he is departed fro yt vine / tha^ he leseth the
vine of all graces / and is send forth in to the ever lasty^ ge fire / as a
branch that brings forth no fruit is cut of the vine and cast in to
the fire / for it is not good for none other thing. There fore the
ryghtwysenesse of god sends them that been so cut of / in to ye fire ever
lasting / for their own defautes deynge in decdly sins / for asmoche as
they ben not good in theyrselfe. They done not labor nor they tyllen not their
vyneyerde but much sooner they done dystroye their vyneyerde / and other me^nes
also. And not only that / they pla^ten no good plants in their vyneyerde /
but rather they taken from ye vyneyetde the sede of grace / ye whische they
vyden receive in the light of holy baptym / and token the holy pertycypacyo^ of
my holy sons blood / which treuly was the wine that this sothfast vine my
sone brought forth to you / but they have drawn up this noble led / and have
taken it to be eten of diverse beestes / (that is to say) they have cast it
under the fete of an vnordynate affection / by many and diverse by ^des of
sins / by the which they have offended me / and put themself to dam^nacyon
/ and there neighbors also. My servants done not so / but follow you the
fair / and sweet paths of my holy servants (that is to say) ye shall be
oned and joined together / i^ this sothefast and very vine / and than ye shall
be part takers of much fruit. For than ye shall take of the oncheed of ye
very vine / and as long as ye abide in the oneheed of my sone / so long ye
dwellen with me / for I and he ben all one. And as long as ye stonden in him /
so long ye done follow his doctrine / and in that that ye done follow his
doctrine / ye shall have part of the great substance of my sone (that is to
say) ye shall be part takers of the ever benge godheed / oned and oned in the
man heed / and he shall have a manner of dyuyne love. In ye which / a soul is
made fer from herself / putty^ge in oblyuyon all vain delectacyons (and for
that cause) I said ye sholden be part takers of the substance of the
foresaid vine. In what manner god bears the branches / ye which ben oned
with the vine / and how that the vyneyerde of each m^a is oned / or joined with
the vyneyerde of his neighbor. B Now ye not what manner of workynge ye have
had / after ye time that my servants ben oned to my sone / that they may
follow his doctrine. I purge them / and cut them / yt they may bry^ge forth
much fruit that their fruit may abide / and yt it be not become bareyne. As
a good branch joined to the vine / which the tyller purges and cle^seth /
because it should bring forth better fruit / and more in quantyte / but he
cutteth of the branch that bry^geth forth no fruit / and casts it in to
ye fire. So do I / which am the ever being tyller / I purge and cleanse my
secuauntes which abyde^ in me / with many and diverse trybulacy^os / yt they
may bring forth better and more fruit / yt virtue may be preued in them.
Other servants which brynge^ forth no fruit / ben cast from the vine /
and put to the fire / as it is said before. My servants doubtelesse ben
good tyllers / which tylle^ well for their souls / putting away fro the
soul all their own soue / and tournen al their affeccyons in to me / and
thereby they norysshen / and encresen the sede of grace / ye which they did
receive i^ the holy baptym. And so well they done labor in their own
vyneyerde / that they tylle^ the vyneyerde of their neighbor / for ye one may
not be tylled / without ye other. And if thou remember the well (I said to the
before) that all good or evil that a man does / it is done by some mean of
his neighbor. Also ye ben my tyllers comen fro me / which am the chief / and
euet being tyller / I have set you in the vine by ye oneheed which I made
i^ you. Think well and have in mind that all reasonable creatures have their
own vyneyerde by themself the which is oned to their neighbor / without any
other mean (that it to say) one so joined with an other / that no man may do
good to himself / nor harm / but that he must yield the same to his
neighbor. Of you all (that is to say) of all the hole christian relygyon / a
general vyneyerde is gadered togydet / the which all ye be^ knytte together /
in the dyneyerde of the ghostly body of your mother the holy church / of the
which ye taken life. This sothefast vine / is the precious body / and parsone
of my sone / in whom ye ought to be knytte and fastened with parfyte love of
heart / and charity in thy neighbor. For when ye ben not set parfytely in him
/ anon ye rebel greatly against ye holy church / and ye ben the members
cut of (as rotten members) fro the body of ye church. Now while ye have time
/ ye may arise from the corrupcyo^ of sins with very dysplesaunce of them /
and fle to my servants for help (as to the tyllers) which kepen the keye of
the vyneyerde (that is to say) of ye blood which came out of the vine / which
is of so great virtue and parfeccyon / yt the fruit of this very precious
blood / may not be taken you / by ye defaute of my mynysters. The bond of
charity is that / the which byndeth them with very meekness / in the
sothefaste knowing of themself (and of me) which wnowynge they have sought.
And yet thou may parceyue / that I have set you as tyllers. And now I call you
again to labor / for now the world fails / the thorns ben somoche multy
plied / that they have almost over grown the said (in somoche) yt they will
give no fruit. I will therefore that ye be true tyllers (that is to help
besyly souls to travail) i^ the ghosty body of your mother the holy church.
To yt I chose you / for I will give mercy to the world / for ye which thou
hase prayed me fervently / and full mekely. How this soul when she had given
tha^kynges to our lord / the prayed him to show her / which wentn by the
bridge / and which wente^ not by ye bridge. O Ha^ this soul fulfilled with
love began to speak to our lord / and said. O lord vnestymable love of
charity / who is he that does not brenne with somoche love / that for that love
may so defend him / that first the heart fail not. Thou lord the very
depenes of charity / thou semes to have great deyntes of thy creatures / as
though thou might not live without them / and yet you hase no need of us which
art our lord and god. And for asmoche as thou art innumerable / there is
nothing added to the / throw ol^re goodness. And for asmoche as thou art
the high ever bring goodness / our evil enpereth the not. O good lord who
is he that styrreth the to somuche mercy (lord it is love) that styrreth the /
and no need that thou hase to us / for we be^ to ye right evil detters. O ever
being goodness / if I behold well about / I am myself a brybour and a these
/ lord thy sone was crucyfyed on a tree / for me a wretched sinner / and I
behold thy sone nailed on the cross / of the which sone thou made a bridge
to me / as it is showed of thy goodness to me / which am thy creature and
servant. Wherefore if it be acceptable to thy goodness / I desire that thy
benygnyte would show me / which ben those that passen by the bridge / and
which not.

The second chapter is how that blissed bridge gods sone has three grees /
by ye which ben betokened three states of a soul. And how this bridge wha^ it
is raised up in to the earth / it is not departed fro the earth. Also how this
reason shall be understood. Siego exaltatus fuero a terra: omnia traham ad me.
And forthermore of the same matter / as it is rehearsed before to you in the
kalendre. Ca. ii.
THe ever being almighty god / thanne to stir this soul much more / and to
heart her more seruently in labor (about the health of man's soul) answered
to her and said Or that I show to the / the which I will show to the / and
of that which thou does ask of me / first I will put the in a certain
knowledge how it is of ye bridge. I said to the before / that the bridge recheth
from heaven to earth (that is to say) by the union which I have made in man /
whom I formed of slyme / or earth. This bridge my only begoten sone has three
ladders in hy^ self / of the which three ladders.ii. were made in ye tree of
ye holy cross. The third he field in full great pain of bytternesse / when
the jews gave him to drink both aysell and gall. In these threladders / thou
shall know ye three states of ye soul / which I shall declare to the here
after. The first ladder is at ye fete / and it betokens the affection and
the desire of the soul. For as the fete beren up the body / so the desires and
affeccyons bere^ up ye soul. The fete nailed / be^ madeladers to the / that
thou may attain / or reche up to the wound of the side / which wound
shows the pryuytes of the heart. For after time you hase ascended up / by ye
fete of desire anon the soul begins to taste ye love of the heart /
fastnynge the eye of intelleccyon / in ye heart of my dear sone / where the
soul shall find the ended parfyte love (I say ye ended love) for he loves
not you for his own profit / for ye may do to him no profit / for he is al
one with me. Than this soul saw how ye she was byloued of god / and than she
was replete with love a thousand times more / than she was before. Forthermore
when ye soul has ascended by the second ladder / she recheth up to ye
third ladder (that is to say) to the company of heaven / where she fyndeth the
pease yt she desired / out of the war / or battle yt she had before /
throw her sin. For in the first ladder of affection and of desire / wha^
she raised up the fete fro ye earth / tha^ she voydeth her from the derkenesse
of vices. In the second ladder / she fulfylleth herself with virtuous love.
And in the third ladder / she tastes a full sweet pease. And thus the
foresaid bridge has three ladders / that when ye pass the first and the
second ladder / ye may blyssedly come to the third / that is the last. This
bridge is raised up on heyght / which shall not be hurt of the rennynge water
/ for in him is no venomous spots of sins. This bridge is raised up / and
yet it is not parted fro the earth. Thou knows well wha^ he had raised
himself up (as when he was tourmented on the cross) yet the dyuyne nature
voyded hy^ not fro the lowness of your humanyte. Therefore I said to the /
that when he was lift up on heyghte / he was not departed fro the earth (as by
that) for with the humanyte he was knytte verily and coupled. And ye time that he
was so areysed / there was no man that might go on yt bridge. Therefore he said
himself / if I be exalted from the earth / I shall draw all things to me.
And I beholdynge of my goodness / that ye myghten none other wise be drawn /
I send him to be arrysed up to the tree of the holy cross. Therefore I made a
ghostly Anduelde / whereon ye sone of mankind should be forged / so yt man
should be walshed and cleansed fro ever lasting death / and that he should be
clothed with the durable life / by a synguler grace. And therefore my sone
draws to him all things / m ye manner (as it is said before) ye he should she
me his great love / which may not be spoke / which love he had to man / for
yt heart of me^ is drawn by love. He might show you no more love / tha^ so
put his life for you. Therefore by the strength of love (man is drawn) but he
make resystence in himself / and will not suffer him to be drawn. I said
therefore / that when my sone was lift up from ye earth that he should draw
all things to him / and that is sothe / but that is vndersto^den two manner of
ways. The one is / that a man's heart he drawn by desire of love / with all
the myghtes of the soul (that is to say) with mind / intelleccyo^ / and
will. When these three myghtes ben accorded / and gadered together in my name /
all other works / actu all / and mental / which he does / ben drawn in me
peaseably / and oned with desire of love / for he has arey sed himself /
following and parsuynge the love / which my sone showed on ye cross. Wherefore
my sothefastnesse said trewly (wha^ I said) I shall draw all things to me /
if I be exalted above (that is to say) when the heart of man is drawn / and
the myghtes of the soul be^ drawn / all his works / or deeds sholden be
drawn. Also these words ye which I shall draw to me / ben un derstonden in
an other manner / as thus. All things yt ben made and formed to the service of
man / they ben made to help ye reasonable creatures / but a reasonable
creature is not made for them (that been not reasonable) but only for me / and
he serve me with all his affection / and with his heart. Also when a man is
drawn up / thou may well parceyue that al things ben drawn up / for all
things ben made for him. Therefore it was spedefull ye that holy bridge should
be exalted / and that it should have in it ladders that ye might ye more
lightly pass over ye bridge. How this bridge is walled with stones / ye which
betoke^ very virtues. Also upon this bridge is a shop ordained / where meet
shall be given to wayegoers. O His worthy bridge is walled with stone / that
great reyne should not let waygoers. Those stones be^ sothefast virtues / but
those stones were not leyd / nor the wall made / before my sons passion. They
weren so greatly let before / that no man might come to the end / for by all ye virtuous ways that he went (heaven was not unto that time undone with ye
keye of his precious blood) and the reyne of ryghtwysenesse / would suffer no
man to pass. But after his passyo^ the stones were set and laid upon the body
of my holy sone / he made up the wall of stones and meddled it with chalk / and
forged and formed it up with his precious blood (that is to say) the blood is
meddled with ye chalk / and strengthed of the godheed / and with ye great fire
of charity. The stones of virtues ben set upon the bridge by my might / for
there is no virtue / but that it is preued in him / and virtues have life of
him. Therefore no man may have such virtues / the which sholden give the life
of grace / but they come of him (that is to say) he must receive his doctrine
/ and follow his steps. For he made up ye wall / and parformed the virtues /
and he planted them as stones of life / with his holy blood / that all
faythefull me^ myghte^ pass freely upon that holy bridge / withoute^ dread of
any great reyne / by the right wysenesse of the godheed / for he is covered
with the large mercy / which came down from heaven / in the incarnacyon of my
beloved sone / which heaven was made open with the keye of his blood. And so ye
sholden behold ye bridge / made and covered with the great mercy. On the
which bridge / the vyrydary of my holy church / stonteth in battle and
fyghteth. Which church has breed of life / and gives the drink that is
mynystred (that is the holy blood) that by that / my creatures which ben
pilgrims and gone in the way / faylen not in the way. And of my charity /
daily I fed you with the precious body and blood of my very parfyte sone /
which is both god and man / by ye mynystracyon of my ghostly servants.
Forthermore wha^ a man is passed over the bridge / tha^ comes be to the gate /
which gate is that same bridge / by ye which gate / all ye must enter.
Therefore my sone said / I am ye way of sothefastnes and life. Who yt goes by
me / goes not in derkenesse / but by light. Also he said in an other place /
there may no man come to my fader / but by mean / and that is sothe. And if
thou remember the well / I showed the why he said thus (I am the way of
sothefastnesse / and life) and so he is. And now I have showed the which is
the way / in likeness of a bridge. He said also / I am ye treuthe / or the
sothefastnesse / and that is sothe. For he is coupled to me / which am all
sothefastnesse / and he that foldweth him gothe in sothefastnesse. He is also
life / and he that follows this sothefastnesse / gothe in to life / and he
may not peresshe in derkenesse that follows him / for he is ye very light of
treuthe / and fer fro all vntreuthe for he dyscryed with his treuthe / ye
vntreuthe. And ye losing of the fend / which he affyrmed with false suggestyon
to Eve / ye which loss brake the heavenly way / and sothefastnesse made it
new again with his glorious blood. They that folowen his way / be^ the
children of sothefastnesse / for they done follow sothefastnes. And wha^ they
pass over by ye gate of sothefastnesse / tha^ comen they to me / ye which am
the peaseable see / oned to the foresaid gate and way (that is to say) oned
with my dear beloved sone / ye which is ye ever being sothefastnes. And he ye
goes out fro this way holds him by the brynke of this stood / which way is
not walled up with stones / but all with water. And for asmoche as water has
no sustentacyon / nor berynge up / therefore by that way no man may pass over
that floode with life / but needs he must be drowned. So by the wretchydnesse
and the lykekynges of the world / and ye states fulfilled and done / for the
desire of them / the stones of life b^e not set up / but rather when their
desire and affeccyo^ is set on a mysse governed love (as only / or pryncypally
i^ creatures) or in other things that be^ bayne / and holden them and louen
them without me / than al those things ben like to the rennynge water for as
the water renneth / so re^neth the man that so sets his love (all be it
throw his blyndenesse) such things semen to him good and not bayne. He that
slydeth forth with a swyfte course of water / against the end of his death /
would hold a back / and keep himself well (that is to say) he would save
his life / and all such creatures / and things which he loves / that they
sholden not pass away. But anon they faylen and passen away / other by death
/ or by my ryghtwyse ordinance / so that all things ben taken away fro them /
before the syghte of other creatures. And they ben the men that gone out of the
way / and gone to the way of pardycyon / and they ben the children of the
fader of loss (that it to say) the children of the fend. And for asmoche as
they gone by the gate of pardycyo^ / they ben punysshed with ever lasting
dampnacyon. And now you may well parceyue / that I have showed the both of the
way of sothefastnes and the way of pardycyon (that is to say) I have showed
the my way which is the high sothefastnes / and the way of the fend /
which is the very way of pardycyon / or dampnacyo^. How me^ gone with great
travail these two ways / whyder they gone by ye bridge / or by ye stood and
of ye delight that a soul has / ye which gothe by ye bridge. O Hese ben the
two ways / and whyther way a man gothe / he passes with great dyffyculte.
Behold therefore and se what ignorance and bly^denesse is in man / that when
there is made to him a sure way / and also showed how he should go that way /
and yet he will hold him by the bry^ke of ye water. The way ye is made and
showed / is so delectable to them that gone thereby / that all their byrternesse
is turned into great joy and swetenes / and eurry heavy bur then / is made to
them full light. And they that be^ in bodyly derkenesse / fynden here a great
light. Also they that lyue^ deedly in this world / they shall find a life /
the which shall be still in pain and never dye. And all those that sauouren
the life of the holy faith (by ye desire of love) I find here ye sothefastnes
ever bey^ge. Which sothefastnesse / promyseth him that trauayleth for me /
comfort and refresshynge of me / which am lyberal and knowy^ge who does for
me. And also I am ryghtful / yeldynge to every man after his works ryghtfully.
Wherefore it is said / there is no evil unpunished / and no good deed
unrewarded. Thy tongue suffyseth not to tell the myrthe and gladness that he
has which gothe by this way / nor it may not be herd nor seen. For i^
this life partly he tastes / and as he has part of ye taste / so he
sauoureth partly that same gladness / which is ordained and made ready to
himself / in ye life that lasts ever. Than he may well be called a fool /
that voydeth such a goodness / and takes him rather in his life to taste the
bytternes of hell / going by a lower way with infynyte labor / and without
any comfort or refresshynge. For by their own defautes / they be^ utterly
pryued of me / which am the highest and ever being goodness Therefore I will
that thou / and my other servants / abide in contynuall bytternesse and
sorrow / for wrongs done to me. Also that ye have compassyon of the harm and
ygnoraunce / with the which y^no rance / they offende^ me greuoufly. And now
thou may comprehe^de in the / how it is of this bridge / that it may be
opened in the / after thy desires / and bitter wepynges / as I have said to
the before.

The third chapitre shows how our lord when he ascended up to heaven / he
departed him not fro the earth Also hold this soul as she wo^dered on ye mercy
of god / she besyed her to think on the multitude of his gifts and graces /
which came of that mercy. Ca. iii.
AFter that my sone came again to me / the forty day after his resurreccyon /
tha^ was this bridge lyfted fro the earth (that is to say) fro the
conuersacyon of deedly me^ / and by my dyuyne nature / he ascen ded i^ to heaven
/ sytty^ge on the right side of me / that am his fader / as ye angel said to
his dyseyples / in the day of his ascencyon / when they stoden as deed men and
amassed / by cause their hertes were^ rauysshed up in to heaven. At the words of
this angel / when he said / throw the wisdom of my sone / he wylleth not to
abide here longer / for he sytteth on ye right hand of his fader. And when he
was raised up on heyghte / and came again to me yt am his fader / tha^ I send
a master (that is to say) the holy ghost / which came with my might / and
with the wisdom of my sone / and with the mercy of that same holy ghost /
for he is one with me that am the fader and with my sone. Therefore that holy
ghost has strenghed ye way of doctrine / which my sothefastnesse left in
the world. Wherefore all be it ye doctrine went away (that is to say) his
presence went away. Nevertheless yt doctrine which is the way of parfeccyon
/ went not fro you / the which way this glorious and amyable bridge made to
you. For first he made and wroughte the way with his virtuous works / she
wynge to you doctrine more by ensample than by word. For first he began rather
to do / than to teache. The mercy of the holy ghost certyfyed and made sure this
true doctrine / and stre^gthed the hertes and the souls of his dyscyples / to
trust on this sothefastnes and to show this way. That is to say / ye
doctrine of christ my sone crucyfyed / repreuynge the world of vnryghtwysenesse
/ and of false judgments. Of the which vnryghtwysenesse and false
judgments / I shall tell ye afterward more dyffusely. This have I said to
the / that there should be no derkenes in their souls that heren this / as
thus. If there be any that would say / we se well that there is made a bridge /
of this body of cry st / for the the oneheed of byuyne nature / with our
nature of ma^heed. This we se well is true / but this bridge wha^ he ascended
in to heaven / he went fro our presence. He was to us the way of
sothefastnesse / and taught us with his virtuous works and examples. What is
left to us now / and were shall we find the way? I speak now to ye / as
though I spoke to them / which ben thus blinded. Ye have the way of this
parfyte doctrine confyrmed of the apostles / and declared in ye blood of
matyrees / lyghtned with the clear light of doctors / and knowleged of the
confessors. And of yt way were^ made open instruments / by ye holy
euangelystes / the which abyden as wytenessers / to make a sothefastnesse in
the ghostly body of holy church / they ben as a lantern bre^nynge / and set
upon a ca^dlestycke / that they sholden deem the way of sothefastnesse /
which ledeth to the way of life / by the parfyte light of clerenes. Also
these wytnessers hadden knowing by experyence / for they hadden assayed that
way theyrselfe. Also each reasonable creature is lyghtned by knowing of a
sothefastnesse / if he will himself (that is to say) that no man be not in
will to lose the light of reason / for his own love and profit. There fore it
is truly said / my sons doctrine is treue / which abode as a boot / to
draweout souls of the tempest of ye great see / and to lead them to the haven
of health. And thus I said / I have made an actual bridge of my sone / with his
conuersau^t being first with men. But wha^ the actual bridge of the parfyte
doctrine was taken fro you / tha^ abode the bridge / and my doctrine with my
might / that am the fader / and the same doctrine joined and knytte with the
wysoome of my sone / and with the mercy and pity of the holy ghost / this might
gives strength to the^ that done follow this way / ye weysdome of my sone
gives to man light that he may know yt sothefastnes in the way / the holy
ghost gives to him love / which love puts away / and dystroyeth the venym
of his propre will / and makes ye love of vertus only to abide. Also he is ye
way of sothefastnesse and life actually or by doctrine / the which way is
the bridge / ledynge and bringing you to the heyght of heaven. Therefore it was
sothely said / when my sone said / I came down fro my fader / and came down
in to the world / I leave yt world again and I go to my fader (yt is to say)
my fader send me to you / and ordained and made me your bridge / yt ye might
ascape over the floode / and come to the life that is ever durable He said
also / and I shall come a gain to you / I shall not leave you faderlesse
children / but I shall send you comfort (that is to say) the holy ghost / as
though my sothefaste sone incarnate had said thus. I shall go to my fader /
and shortly after come again to you / wha^ the holy ghost comes / which is
the spyryte of comfort. Which spyryte of comfort shall show you more
clearly all thing / and co^fyrme the way of sothefastnesse / that is ye most
parfyte doceryne that I have given you. He said also / I shall come again to
you / and so he did. For the holy ghost comes not alone / for he comes with
the might of the fader / with the wisdom of the sone / and and with yt mercy
of the holy ghost. Therefore you may se that he came again not actually / but in
virtue strengthynge the way of doctrine which way may never fail / nor be
taken fro them / yt ben in will to follow yt doctrine. For it is strong and
stable / for asmoche as it came fro me / ye which am not chaungeable. Therefore
ye sholden myghtly follow that way of doctrine / without any cloud / with
the light of very faith / which is given to you for a pryncypall vesture /
in the sacrament of holy baptym. Now daughter I have declared and showed to yt
pleynly ye actual bridge and his doctrine / which is all one / and the same
with the bridge. I have said also yt there were apostles / euangelystes /
martyrs / co^fessours / and holy doctors / ordained and set / as la^terns in
holy church. I have showed yt also how my sone / after time ye he came to me /
that he came again to you / not by his bodyly presence / but in virtue (that is
to say) when that the holy ghost came upon the apostles. For in that bodyly
presence he shall not come to you again / but in yt last day of Judgment /
wha^ he shall come with my ma^^ste / and with my dyuyne might / to Judge the
quycke and ye deed / and to yield rewards to the good / and to reward them with
great gyftesin soul and body for their labors / and he shall yeldefull
bitter penes / to all them that wyckedly have led their life here i^ this
world. Now daughter forthermore I will say to yt / ye I sothefastnesse made
promise to she we all to the / that is to show the the^ that gone in that way
vnparfytely / and them also that gone parfytely / and them ye gone in ye most
parfyte way and how they go. I have showed the also the wicked men / which with
their wickedness drownen themself in the floode / and gone to ever lasting
derkenesse. And now I speak to you that been my dear children / that ye go by
the bridge besely and not under the bridge / for that is not the way of
ryghtwysenesse / but rather it is the way of pardycy on and untruth / and by
that way wicked men go / of the which men I shall speak here after. Those be^
sinners / of the which / I pray you that ye pray to me besyly / and for ye
halthe and the faluacyon of the^. I ask of you teeres and labors / that they
may have of me my great mercy. Than this soul was so fulfill sed with all
ghestly sweetness / that she might not refreyne herself / but as she slode in
our lords prefence / she began to speak / and said. How this soul as she
wondered on the great mercy of our lord / she remembered her on the multitude
of his great benefytes. O Mercy without end / and ever being goodness / the
which dydhyde the great wyckednes of thy creatures. Dear lord I would not
wondre (if thou did say) I shall not remember me of their wyckednes / which
comes out of deedly sins / and at the last tournen to the again. O you
inestymable mercy / I will ueuer wonder / if thou say ye word to them that
comen out of sin / sythen thou did say to us / I will ye ye pray to me for
them / that dysplesen me with their syntul lyuy^ge / that I may give to them
mercy. O most ple^tuous mercy / which comes of eteruyte ever being of the
almighty fader / which governs the world we his everlasting might. Also
we weren made and formed in thy mercy / and we ben reformed by thy mercy / in
the blood of thy sone / for thy amyable mercy keeps us. Lord thy mercy made
thy sone to sprede his arms on the cross / there played death with life / and life
with death. Than he send utterly ye life / which was the death of our sins /
and that death of our sin / took away the bodily life / fro the meke lamb
/ that is thy dear sone. O lord who was ouercomen? Lord death was ouercome^.
Lord who was the cause? Thy great mercy was ye cause. Thy mercy gave life /
thy mercy gave light / by which mercy / thy goodness is known in every
creature / in sinful men and in vnryghtful me^. Thy mercy shyned in ye hyghnes
of heaven (as in thy seyntes) if I speak of thy earth / thy mercy is there al
ple^tuous. That mercy shyneth i^ ye derkenesse of hell / not yeldy^ge somoche
pain to the^ ye ben dampened / as they be^ worthy / with thy mercy you did swage /
and refresshe thy ryghtwysenes. Of thy mercy you hase washed us i^ thy blood /
and of ye same mercy you was co^uersau^t we me^ O lord how great mercy it is
of somoche love. O lord was it not suffycyent to ye to be incarnate / but yet
moreover thou would suffer the death. Whether than that death was not
suffycyent because you went down in to hell / taking fro thens holy faders /
that thy mercy and sothefastnesse should be showed in them / but moreover thy
sothsastnes does give to them / that serue^ ye in truth goods that may not
be spoken. Thou dyscended to hell / because thou would deliver them fro pain
and mysery (the which hadden serned the) thou yielded to the^ ye fruit of
their labors. Yet gracyous lord (as me seems) thy mercy constreyned the to
give to man moore larger gystes (that is to say) gyuynge the to man in to meet
/ ye we feeble wretches sholden receive comfort and solace / that vncunnynge
men sholden not forgo the memory of thy benefytes. Therefore when thou gyues
every day that sacrament to men / thou showed the as christ in thy holy
sacrament of ye auter / in the ghostly body of the holy church. Lord who
wroughte all this? Thy mercy lord wrought it. O great mercy / my heart is
full replete / thy^kynge on the. For i^ what party I turn me / and thy^ke on
ye / I find no other thing / tha^ the broad see of thy great mercy. O holy
fader / have pity and spare my ygnorau^ce / because I presume to speak thus
before thy image / nevertheless ye love of thy mercy hath^ me a wretch excused
/ before thy be nygnyte. Wha^ this soul had opened her heart by speaking to ye
mercy of god / tha^ she asked mekely ye she might have knowledge of ye that our
lord promised her before. Than our lord began to speak again and said.
Dear daughter thou hase showed / and told to me of my great mercy / for I
said to ye that ye should se that mercy / and thou shall have taste in ye
words ye were^ said before to ye (that is to say) I said I would show the
which they be^ / for whom I pray you / to pray to me. Nevertheless daughter
know it for certain / ye my mercy is to you much more ple^tuous / tha^ you
sees it. For thy syghte is fynyts / and vnpar fyte. Also co^paryson may not be
made / bytwyxe thy sey^ge and my and merci / but as it were bitwyxe a deed
fynyte / and a deed ifynyte. I would that you should taste this great mercy /
and also moreover that thou taste or know the dygnyte of man / that thou may
know more openly the cruelte and untruth of wicked me^ the which gone by ye
way of derkenesse. Open the eyes of thy intelleccyon / and behold them that
wylfully drowne^ themself / not going by the very sure pathe way of the
bridge. And se into how much unworthiness they ben fallen / by their own
sins and defautes. The syrste cause of their unworthiness is / yt they
become seek / and ye is wha^ they have sinned deedly in their hertes and wylles
/ and than after that / they parforme^ it in deed / and losen the life of
grace. As a deed man which has no wit / nor may not move himself / but
he be moved of another. In the same manner / they that been sleen in the wicked
stood / of ye worldely mys governed love / ben deed as to grace And because
they be^ deed / their minds have forgoten the great benefyte of my large
mercy. Also their eyes of intelleccyon seen not / nor known not my
sothefastnesse / for his wit and feeling is deed / and for his intelleccyo^
puts nothy^ge before hymselte / but his own will with the love of his own
propre sen sualyte / therefore his will is deed / as fro my reasonable will /
for his will loves not / but things that been deed. And throw these three
diverse myghtes of the soul / al his works actual and mental / ben utterly
departed and dyuyded as froony grace / and as by himself / he may not be
defended fro his enemy es / but he be helped throw my good nesse. But
forthermore sothe it is as often as he has right frechoys while he is i^
deedly body asks my help / heshall have it / but by himself he may never
have it. For to himself is made vnportable / and there he coueteth to be made
lord over all thing. Therefore that that is naught / has the maystre and
lordeshyp over him / and that is sin. Sin is naught of himself / and all
such as ben naught / ben the servants of sin. I made them fair trees of
love / with the life of spercyall grace / the which grace they dyden receive
in the holy baptym. But now they waxen roten trees / for they ben deed as I
have said besore. And this deed tree fastneth his roots / in the highness of
pride / ye which pride nourysheth venym / of ye love of his propre sensualyte.
And ye bytternesse within / is impasyence / and all these come^ of indyscrecyon
/ or lack of wit. These four pryncypall vices done slay utterly the souls
of them (of the which I have told ye before) how they be^ ye trees of death
for they have no life of grace. Also within that tree the worm of conscye^ce
is nourysshed / which worm as long as a man lives in deedly sin / that
man is made blind throw his own propre love / therefore he feleth bu little of
ye fretynge / or bytynge of he worm. Also the fruytes of this wicked tree be^
deedly fruytes / for of the root of pride / they draw out the moisture of
the tree. And the wretched soul is al clothed / and covered with great
unkindness / of ye which unkindness / there romen all other euylles and
wyckedues. If she would gladly with thankynges receive the benefyres the which
ben given her / than should she know me / and wha^ that she knew me verily /
than she should know herself right parfytely / and so she should still abide
and dwell in my love. But as a blinded wretch / she puts herself to the
great floode / no regard taking / nor head / how slyper and how swyfte the
water is / and how it abides no creature.

The.iiii. chapter is how the fruit of this tree is asmoche diverse / as is ye
dyuersyte of sins And here he shows first of the fiesshly sin / and the
fruit of some trees is auaryce. And of some comen vnryghtwysenesse / and
specially of such me^ that have the state of domynacyon / and so forth of
other sins / as is made me^cyon before to you in the kalendre. Ca. iiii.
OVre lord here speaks to this maid / and says thus. Without doubt there
ben as diverse evil fruytes of this tree / which bryngen death / as be diverse
kinds of sins. Thou may se some kind of vnreasenable beestes / and those
ben lykened to such men that lyuen vncle^ly / which done with their body and
soul / as a sow that waloweth in a stynkynge mire / and that is when such
wretches defoulen the^ self / in the fylthe of flesshly sin. O wretched /
foul / and full of sins / where hase you left thy dygnyte thou became a dear
beloved sister of angels / and you art made as an unreasonable be / in
somoche and in so many myseres (that not only) you shall not be suffered of me
in that fylthe / ye which am al pure and clean. But also those fendes / to
whom you art become as a friend / and bound / may not se nor suffer somoche
vnclenesse be done in their sight. There is no sin so abhomynable / nor no
syune that someche takes fro the soul the light of intelleccyo^ / or of
ghostly vndersto^dy^ge / as this wretched sin of flesshly lust. Phuosophers
hadde^ knowledge of this / but not throw the light of grace / for they hadden
not ye grace / but only nature gave them that light / ye such sin blinded
and stopped their eyes of intelleccyon. And therefore to ye intent / that they
myghten the more lightly give them to their study / many of them were night well
content / and dyden abstain the^ fro that sin. They took on the^ abstyne^ce
/ and they vyden despise riches / yt the business about riches should not let
them fro their study. Thus done not the wicked christian men / nor he that loses
grace throw his sins. How the fruit of some trees is auaryce / and of the
evil that comes of that sin. THe fruit of some other men / ben erthely
f^uytes / and those ben covetous men / and mysse kepers of their good / which
done as a molle / which is always nourysshed in ye earth till she dye. And wha^
ye cruel death comes / tha^ is there no remedy. They with their great desire of
erthely goods / dythysen my goodness / and sellen them to ye world. They be^
usurers to their neighbors / for they have such my^de on their goods / y
they forgoten me and their neighbors. For and they dyde^ love me / they
sholde^ not be so cruel to themself. But they sholden have pity and mercy /
and work virtuously to themself / and serve their neighbor charitably. O
what wickedness and evil comes out of this wicked syn^e / how many man
slaughters / thieves / rauyners / with many unlawful lucres and crueltes of
death / that comen out of this sin. Also the vnryghtwysenes of the^ sleeth ye
soul of their neighbor / and make^ the soul not lady / but servant of
richesse (that is to say) she puts behind / the keeping of my precepts.
Such a soul loves not other things / but only his propre profit / and
that vice comes of pride / and that vice noryssheth pride / that one comes of
ye other / for this vice bears evermore with him / a man's extollynge / and
his own reputacyon / and anon it falls in to an other vice / and so he
falls fro evil in to more evil / by that wretched pride / which is full of
evil will / and it is a great fire / smiting out a smoke of vain glory /
and vahyte of the heart / and reioyseth him of good that is not his. It is also
a rote that has many branches / of the which a man's own excellence / is
the pryncypall branch. And that is wha^ a man holds himself more worthy /
and more cunning than he is. Of such reputacyon / comes vnordynate desire
(that is to say) desire to be more worthy and at more reputacyon tha^ his
neighbor / showing forth an her^e fened / not true nor fre / but double.
For he feneth the one in ye monye / and has an other in the heart / and
hydeth the trewethe and makes lies / for his own profit. Also of this rote
of pride / comes a wicked branch of envy / and ye is a worm / which is
always fighting and frety^ge / and suffers them never to hold them plesed /
nor to be glad for their own profit / nor for the profit of their
neighbors. How shall this wicked kind of such sinners / ye ben set in so
great mysery / do any sacryfyce to poor men / with ye substance of their
good when they taken away other men's goods. How shall a man bry^ge forth
a clean soul fro ynclennesse / when they putten the soul in uncleanness / for
sometime they ben become so beestly / that they dreden not to take their own
daughters / or other of their kynne / but with the^ they fallen in to much
wretchedness and fylthe / and nevertheless my mercy abides and supporteth
them. And I bydde not that the earth should swalowe them / but I abide and
suffer them to amend their lives. How shall they be able than to put their
lives for health of souls / when they done not ye substance of their own
health. O wicked vices full of mysery / which draws down ye heaven of the
soul. I call the soul heaven / for I made the soul an heaven / in the which I
ordained me to abide by grace / and reave rende me in her. And for love I made
me a bydynge place in her / and now she is gone fro me / as a voutrer loving
herself / and other creatures more than me (and not only that) but more over
she makes a god of herself / and parsueth me with diverse sins. And all this
she does / for she bethynketh her not / of that great benefyte that I did for
her / when I shed my blood for mankind / by my endeles charity. How
vnryghtfulnes is the fruit of some men's teeres / the which stonden in the
state of dampnacyon. OTher there ben which bere^ themself full high by their
lordeshyp / in the which hyghenesse / they vsen much vnryghtwysenesse
against me / against their neighbor / and against themself. Against
themself / for they lyuen not virtuously. Also vnryghtwysely they bear the^
against me / for they yelde^ not worship to my name / nor they given no
thankynges nor presynges to me as they ben bound / but as thieves they taken
away fro me yt is mine gyuy^ge it to their own propre sensualyte. Also they
done vnryghtwysenesse to me / and against themself / as bly^de men and
vncunnynge / not knowing me in the^. And all this comes by their own love /
which desire may not be fulfilled / nor they ben never contented / as the
Jews and the mynysters of the law dyde^ to my sone. For they maden them self
blind / throw envy / and throw their own propre love. Therefore they knew
not the sothefastnesse of my sone. And wha^ they knew not the cuerlastynge
life / which was withi the^ / they dyde^ not their dewte / and that very^yed
my sothefastnesse / and that is my sone / wha^ he said thus / ye kyngedome of
god is within you / but that knew they not. And the cause was / for they
hadden lost the light of reason / and in this manner they lef^e^ their dewre
undone / which dewre should have be to give tha^kynge and worship to me and to
my sone / which is all one with me. And therefore as blind men they dyde^ such
vnryghtwysenesse to me / parsuynge my sone / to the dyspytefull death of the
cross / with repreues and wrongs woute^ end. So they yt ben like to them /
done unworthiness to me / and to themself / and to their neighbor /
selly^nge vnryghtfully their own flesh / and of their sogetes / and of
other. Of the unworthiness in to which a man falls throw these defautes.
Also it speaks of these words. Paraclitus autem que^ mittet pater. etc. ALso
throw this sin and for other defautes / they fallen sometime in a false
Judgment / as I shall shewethe after. They ben ever sclan^dred in my works /
ye which ben all ryghtfull / and all be^ ordained in sothefastnesse / throw
mercy and love. With this wicked and falls Judgment / the Jews dyde^ repreue
wyckrdly the ryghtfull works of my sone / throw wicked ve / nym of envy / and
pride / demynge them with their falsenes and their lesynges (and said) this is
he that casts out in ye virtue of Bellabub. So the wicked Jews weren so
fulfilled with their own propre love / and grounded so in uncleanness / as in
pride / auaryce / and lose of dyscrecy on / with impasence / and many other
defautes that been used / that always they ben sclaundred in me / and in my
servants / demy^ge falsely / those virtues ben fened / and not true. And ye
cause is / for their heart is infecte / and has no right nor true rast of
the soul / nor ghostly savor / wherefore all good works semen to them
unsavory and wicked. O blyndnesse of mankind / why will thou not behold thy
dygnyte / fro great thou art become full little / fro a lord you art made a
servant and bound / for thou art made servant and soget to sin. And you
art made such as he is / whom you serves. Sin is naught / therefore thou
art become to naught. Sin has taken thy life fro ye and has betaken ye
to death. This life and dominacyon was taken to you / of the doctrine and the
glorious bridge / of my dear sone. Wha^ ye weren servants of the fend / my
sone took you out of that seruage because ye ye sholden not perysshe. I
ordained my sone a servant and I put in him obedyence / that the inobedyence
of Adam should be put out. And that pride should be confounded / he meked
himself to the most cruel death of the cross. He dyscryed all vices by the
virtue of his death / that no man might say that such a vice was unpunished /
for throw his passion and bitter death / all vices were^ punysshed in him. All
remedies weren given / for he would deliver them fro everlasting death. They
dyden despise that holy blood / and they dyden trede it under the fete of an
vnordynate affection. This is that vnryghtwysenesse / and their false Judgment
/ with the which the world is repreued. And so it shall be repreued / in the
great day of ye Judgment (so wytnesed my sone) that is my sothefastnesse /
when he said. The comforter that is called the holy ghost / whom my fader
shall send in my name / he shall undermine ye world of vnryghtwysenes / and
ye world was repreued wha^ I send my holy spyryte in the apostles. Here is
how christ speaks this reason. O go mittam paraclitu^ qui mu^du^ arguet. etc.
And how ye one of these repreues is contynuall. THere be^ three under mynynges
of ye world. One was when the holy ghost dyscended on crystes dyscyples (as I
said before) for wha^ they were^ strengthed by my might / and lyghtned with
the wisdom of my sone / than they dyden receive both grace and virtue / in the
fullness of the holy ghost. Than the holy ghost which is one with me / and
with my sone / repreued the world / by the monycyons of his dyscyples / with ye
techynge of my holy sothefastnes / that is my sone. They and such other which
came of them / following that sothefastnesse / which they knew by their
techynge / dyden repreut the world. This is a contynuall vndermynynge / which
I d^ to the world (as ye techy^ge of holy scripture says) and by the
prechy^ge of my servants / when the holy ghost put himself in their tongues
/ and showed them my sothefastnesse. And right so in the contrary / the fend
receives him on the tongues of his servants (that is to say) on the tongues
of them / which gone by the wicked floode. This holy vndermynynge / is put to
ye world co^tynually (in the manner as I said before) throw the great love
that I have to ye health of souls. And they may not say / we hadden no man
to excuse us / for ye truth thereof is clerly showed / wha^ virtue and vice was
showed to them. And I made them to se the fruit of virtues / and the harm of
vices / to ye intent that I should grant to the^ both to love and to dread
me / with the hate of vices / and love of virtues. And now that doctrine is not
showed by an angel / for they sholde^ not say / an angel may not offend for
be is a blyssed spyryte. He feleth no greuaunce of the flesh / as we feel.
This they may not say / for that doctrine was given to the^ of my sone / the
which was incarnate / with very deedly flesh as ye have. Also other there
weren / the which dyde^ follow crystes techy^ge (suffrynge creatures as ye
ben) reasonable and deedly / with strife of ye ftesshe against ye spyryte / as
saint Paul was / and full many seyntes the which weren trauayled with many
passions. Which passyo^s weren suffered of my goodness / for yt encrese of
grace and virtues in their souls. And they weren borne in sin / as ye ben /
and nouryshed with the same meet / and as I was god than / so I am god now.
For my might was not made less / nor it may not be made less. Also I will /
I can / and I may / give my help to all that been of will to ask to have
help of me. A man desires to be helped of me / wha^ he gothe out of that
floode / and goes upon the bridge / following the way of my fothefastnesse /
that is the way of my beloved sone. Wherefore the Jews / and wicked christian
men / sholden have no excusacyo^ / for they ben repreued. I showed the^
contynually the sothefastnesse / and they wolde^ not receive it. And for that
if they dyspose them not wha^ they have time / all such shall abide / and be
condemned in the second repreuynge / which shall be in the last time / where
my ryghtwysenes shall cry. Ye that been deed / arise you up and come to your
Judgment (that is to say) you that been deed to grace / and deed to bodyly
death arise ye up and come ye with your vnryghtwysenesse / and false
Judgments / and with the light of very feythe / which is quenched in you /
which light was brennynge in ye time of holy bapty^. This light was quenched
with thy pride / and with ye vanyte of thy heart / which pride and vanyte /
thou hase nouryshed with thy propre love / and with thy own extolly^ge /
throw thy propre repuytacyon. Wherefore by thy own propre will / thou hase
rennen throw the floode of delytes / following the wy^cked and grievous
temptacyons of the fend / and thy frele flesh. To the which perell / thy
own wicked will has lad yt / by a lower way / in to the floode that is
rennynge. And thus the fend and ye peryllous floode / has brought the to
everlasting derkenesse and tourment.

The fyfte chapter is of ye second vndermynynge / in ye which vnryghtwysenes
ben repreued / both in special and in general. Also of four pryncypall
tourme^tes of them that been dampened / which all other tourme^tes follow / and
in special of the foul syghte of ye fend. Also of the third reprefe in the
day of dome. Also of the Joy of them that been saved and blyssed / as is
rehearsed i^ the kalendre. Ca. v.
OVre lord god did show to this maid of ye second vndermynynge / and did
say to her thus. Dear daughter this second vnderminy^ge is when the soul
comes to the last end of this life / where is the remedy / for it is come to
the extremytes of the death / where the worm of conscience has life. And now
in ye, time of death / for in asmoche as he sees yt he may escape not fro my
hands / than he begins to se this worm. Therefore the soul freteth
herself with full great reprefe and vndermynyge / beholdy^ge that clerly
throw her own defaures / she enters in to peynes i^tollerable. Yet if this
soul had that light of grace with the which she might know what evil she
had done / and would sorrow therefore / not pry^cypally for dread of helpenes
/ but for she has offended my ever being goodness tha^ might she find
mercy. But if the time of death passes forth without light of grace / only
with the worm of consyence / and withoute^ hope of merit / of my sons blood
shed for her / or if she sorrow more for her own harm wylfully / than for
me / she gothe tha^ to euerlasty^ge dampnacyon. And than shall she myserably /
and wretchydly be punysshed / and cas under the fete of ye ^als Judgment of
vnryghtwysenesse. And not only of vnryghtewysenesse of falls Judgments
generally i^ all her works / but much more sharply she shall be put under the
fete of vnryghtwysenesse and of falls Judgment in special / which she used in
her last end / and that is in demynge and falls weny^ge / that her mysery and
sin was more than my mercy. That is the greatest sin / which shall not be
releshed in this world nor after / if she dye so there with / for by her own
will / she despised and forsook my mercy / for that is more grievous to me /
than al ye sins that she did. Wherefore ye dyspyracyo^ of Judas / was more
dysplesaunce and greuaunce to my sone / tha^ his betray^ge. Also they ben made
blind in this false dome / where they dyde^ think that their trespases weren
more / tha^ my mercy / that is so large / which may not be nou^bred / therefore
they ben tourmented with fendes. Also they be^ repreued of vnryghtwysenesse /
and that is when they sorrow more for their penes and harms / than for my
offenses. There they done vnryghtwysenesse / for they yelden to me that is not
mine / nor to the^ that longs to them. They sholden yield to me love / with
contrycyo^ of heart / they sholden yield to me / and offer up to me bytternesse
of soul / and sorrow for offenses done to me / but they done the contrary /
gyuynge to themself the love and sorrow for their peynes that they abyden.
They done also vnryghtwysenes / as thou sees / therefore when they have put
behind my mercy / they sholden be tourme^ted for both. For I of my
ryghtwysenesse have ordained the^ to be tourmented / of my mynysters the fendes
/ with ye seruau^te of their sensualyte / and with the cruel spyryte of the
fend / to whom they be^ made sogettes and servants / as they of their
propre sensualyte dyde^ offe^de me / my ryghtwysenes has send them to be
tourmented right sharply / for they dyde^ wretchydly Of four pryncypall
tourmentes of them that been dampened / and of ye foul sight of the fend. My
daughter no tongue suffyseth not to tell ye great peynes of such wretched
souls / as these three pryncypall vices deseruen and sholden have (that is to
say) a man's own propre love of ye which love comes forth the second
(that is to say) ye extolly^ge / and reputacyon of himself. And of that
reputacyon comes forth ye third (that is to say) pride / with false
iustyfyenge themself / and with cruelte / and with other unclean and wicked
sins / which done follow here after. So I said to the / y they receive four
tourme^tes afterward pryncypally in hell / which ben these. The first is /
that they se well how they ben pryued of my syghte / for ye gives to the^ so
great apeyne / ye if it were possible / they wolden rather chose the fire /
and al other tourmentes and se me / tha^ to be out of tourmentes / and not to
se me. This pain increases ye second pain / that is of the worm of
consyence / which freteth always / beholdy^ge how I have worthily pryued them
of my sight / and of the co^uersasyon of angels / seeing well themself / that
for their sins / they be^ made worthy / to have the conuersacyon of fendes /
and to have the horrible syghte of the^. Which sight of the fend / that is ye
third pain doubleth to the^ al labor / al sorrow / and all pain. For right
as in the syghte of me / all seyntes have gladness / with Joy of ye fruit of
their labors / the which they broughte^ for my name / with the plentuousnesse
of my love / and great dysplesau^ce of themself. Right so in ye co^trarywyse
/ these synful wretches ben increased in tourmentes / by yt horrible syghte of
fendes. For in such a syghte they known themself / more fully than they
dyde^ / for there they se yt throw their own defautes / they ben worthy to
have those tourme^tes. And in this manner their worm freteth them more myghtly
/ and the fire of this conscience ceseth never of bre^nynge. Also it is to
such wretches as be^ dampened more pain / to se and to behold the fend / as
he is in his propre figure / which beholdynge and sight is so horrible / that
no man's heart may think it. And thou boughter if thou remember the well /
thou knows i^ what form he was show ed to yt / as in yt mynute of an hour.
And at the last when thy spyrytes weren comen again together / an thy own
choice / thy will was rather to go in a way brennynge (as to hell) thy life
during / unto the day of Judgment / than to se that syghte any more. And yet
not wtstondynge thou saw it in such a form / yet you knows not how horrible
it is. For by ye power of my dyuyne ryghtwysenesse / the fend shows hy^ more
horrible in a wicked soul / which has pryued herself of me / and more or
less / after ye greuaunce of her sins. The fourth tourment is fire / this
fire ceseth never of brennynge / and yet he wastes not. For the being of the
soul may not be wasted / nor yt fuel of the fire may not be wasted / for it
is not bodyly. Nevertheless I suffer the^ to be burnt of that fire by my
dyuyne ryghtwysenesse / as by way of tourment / which fire tourmenteth them /
and wastes not / and tourmenteth and brenneth the^ with great penes / by many
diverse ways / after the dyuersyte and multitude of sins. Beside these four
pryncypall tourmentes be other / and of these tourmentes come^ all other with
cold / here / and gnastynge of tethe / and after they gone wretchely to yt
everlasting fire that is death after the time they ben Judged / at the day of
Judgment / of their unrightful lyuy^ge in their lyte / and they that done not
amend them before death / in ye first vndermyny^ge. Also if they dye in the
second un dermynynge (that is to say) if at ye point of death they will not
have hope nor trust in my mercy / nor sorrow for offenses done to me
pry^cypally / but rather sorrow for their own penes which they sholde^ suffer
/ after they have received ye ever lasting death. Of the third vndermynynge /
which shall be at the day of Judgment. Now thou shall here of yt third
vndermyny^ge (that is to say) of the last day of Judgment / yt thou may se
how much a soul dysceyueth herself. First I shall tell the of the general
Judgment / in ye which Judgment / the pain of a wretched soul shall be
increased throw yt oneheed which the soul shall make with ye body / with an
intolerable vndermynge / the which shall bring her in to confusyon and shame.
Thou shall know it forsothe / that in the last day of ye Judgment / wha^ my
sone shall come with his ryghtwysenesse / to Judge the world with yt dyuyne
might. For tha^ he shall not come as a little poor child / as when he was
borne of a maidens womb / in a stable with beestes / afterward he dyed with
great dyspyte / hanging on the cross between.ij. thieves. And that time I hyd
my might in him / and I suffered him to have pain and tourment vntolletable /
as a very man. Not in that wise that the dyuyne nature / as for that was
departed fro him / but I suffered him to bear that passion as a man / that he
should make satysfaccyon for your sins. But daughter he shall not come so
down in the last end of the world / for he shall come than with a full
great might with his own propre person / to make correccyo^. And there shall no
creature be tha^ / but yt he shall have great dread / and he shall yield to
every creature after his works. To souls that shall be dampened / he shall
give many tourmentes / and the beholdynge on him shall be so dredful that a
tongue suffyseth not to tell / he shall give to ryghtfull souls in his
beholdynge / a dread of reverence / with full great joy and gladness. Not in
that wise that he shall be changed in face / for he is unchangeable / for he
is all one with me / with my dyuyne nature / and after nature of man / so yt
his face is not chaungeable / after his glorious resurreccyon. He shall show
him dreadful to yt eye of the^ yt shall be dampened / for they shall se him with
the dredefull and derke eyes which they have in themself / as an eye yt is
hurts may not comprehend but derkenesse in a sayre shynynge son. An hole eye
beholds light / and that is not throw the defaute of yt light / which
shall give more and rather alteracyon to a blind man / tha^ to him yt has
syghte / but it is throw yt defaute of yt sore eye. So shall they yt shall be
dampened / behold my sone with a dredefull sight / and intolerable in great
confusyon and hatered. Not throw defaute of my divine majesty / in the which
majesty / he shall come to Judge all the world / but they sholden se him so
dredefully by their own defautes. How a soul dampened / may not desire no
goodness. THe hatered of dampened souls / that they have in them is somoche /
that they may not desire nor will any goodness / but always they dyspysen me
with blasphemy^ge. And will you know why they have no appetyte nor desire to
goodness / for yt life of a man wha^ it is deed yt fre choice to good or ill is
co^streyned / and fro that time passed / they may go no forther. If they dyen
in hatered with deedly syn^e / always after the soul is bound with the bo^des
of hatered / of yt dyuyne ryghtwysenes / and he abides obstynate i^ ye pain
yt he suffers / always frety^ge himself with peynes / which be^ added and
encresed to hy^ / fro time to time. And specially they be^ partyners of their
peynes / of whom they were^ ye pry^cypal cause of their da^pnacyo^ as the rich
man yt was dampened gave you ensample / when he asked for grace / that Lazarus
should go i^ to the world to his brederne for to show them his cruel peynes.
He asked not for compassyo^ / nor for charity that he had to his brederne / for
he was pryued of that compassyon and of charity. And he might desire no
goodness / another to my worship / nor to their health (for as I said to
the) they may do no good to their neighbor. Me they blasfeme / because they
did end their lives in hatered of me / and in hate of virtues. Why does you
ask tha^ the rich man yt Lazarus should show to his brederne / what peynes
he suffered (this was the cause) for yt rich man had many brederne / and he was
ye oldest of the^ / and he noryshed the^ in sin and wretchydnesse / in ye
which he was used always himself / wherefore he was cause of their da^pnacyon
parpetual / for which cause he saw before what encrese of peynes he should
suffer / wha^ they were^ comen to tourme^tes to him / in which peynes evermore
they frete themself with hatered. Of the bliss and joy of chosen souls. IN the
contrarywyse a ryghtfull soul / ye which ends her life in affection of
charity and is k^yte with the bond of love / may not be encresed in virtues /
after ye time her life is passed. But such a soul may always love / with the
same love yt she comes to me / and with the same mesure / she shall be mesured
again. He that coueteth me / always has me / wherefore his desire is not void
/ but when he has me / he is filled with repleccyon. And when he is replete /
yet he is made hongry for desire / but werynesse is fer tro repleccyon / and
pain is far from such hongre. With love they Joy together / in the
euerlasty^ge sight of me / and to be partetakers of that I have i^ my self.
Every soul as he has deserved / more or less (that is to say) in the same
mesure of love / in ye which they came to me / the very same shall be mesured
to them / for all they dyden live in the love of me / and of their neighbors.
And so in that common charity / with ye which they were all joined together /
and also with a special and a profounde love the which comes out of the bond
of the same charity. They be^ in joy together with gladness / and they be^ all
made glad with joy together / and every man's goodness meddled together the one
with the other / with affection of charity besides the universal goodness /
the which they rejoice together. They done joy also with great gladness /
with the nature of angels / with the which angels / the souls of seyntes ben
set after the multitude of diverse virtues / which they hadden pryncypally
being in the earth / and all ben knytte together with chain of charity / the
which may not be dyssolued. Also they joy with them in a synguler
partycypacyo^ of blys with whom they were knyte together with a partyculer love
in yt world. Throw the which love they dyden encrese here in grace and
virtues wha^ one gave cause to an other / to show and to give laud and glory
to my holy name / in the^ and in their neighbors. Therefore they losen not yt
same love / when they comen to the life that shall ever endure. But rather they
have yt same / and part together / with much more plente of love / tha^ they
did here. And wha^ they have this special gift / which is added for encrese
of their blys I would not that you suppose / that they should have this
partyculer only for themself / it is not so. For that same goodness is had of
all the holy souls in heaven / which be my dear beloved and chosen children /
and of all ye court / and of all the ordres of angels. Therefore when a soul
is come to that blys of everlasting life / all that be there / shall have
part of the goodness of that soul / and that soul has part of their
goodness and blys that be in heaven. But not so yt ye souls need any array /
but thou shall understand that they have a manner of gladness / and a synguler
joy which is called Iub^lus (that is to say) a soul of a glad song / which
may not be told by word nor showed by sown of voice. For gladdenes and joy
/ which joy they have by the knowing which they had in such a soul. They
behold such a soul take up from ye earth by my mercy with ple^tuousnes of
grace. Also they joy together in me / and be glad in the possessyon of goodness
/ yt they know in yt soul / for that grace / the which ye soul received of
my goodness. That same soul is glad in me / and in the holy spyrytes / and in
the blyssed souls in heaven / beholdynge in the^ yt fair heed / and tastynge
the swetenes of my charity. And the desire of the^ cry always to me / for the
saving of al before my majesty for yt life of the^ was ended / in yt charity
of their neighbor. That charity they left not / but with yt charity they did
pas throw ye gate of my dear sone / in the manner yt I shall tell ye
afterward. Wherefore thou may well conceive yt with yt bond of yt same love /
wherein they did end their life / in yt same they dwell and abyd / and
euerlasty^gely they endure They be somoche conformed to my will / yt they may
not desire / but yt is my will. For their fre choice is so bound with ye bond
of my charity / that when ye reasonable time of a creature / fails after his
death he may no more sin. And his will is somoche co^formed with my will /
that though they se and know the souls of their fader and mother and of their
children / or of their other friends they charge them not / but rather they
beholden they in as my enemies. And when they se them tourme^ted / they
dyscorde i^ not hy^ge fro my will / for their desires be fullfylled / the
desire of souls in bliss is to se and behold my worship fullfylled in you /
that yet be walkers in ye way / ye which be strangers and pilgrims / going
fast to the end of death. All your souls health / they that be in bliss done
cover / for the desire yt they have to my worship. Therefore they pray always for
you whose desire is fulfilled of my party / so yt ye wtsto^de not my mercy /
for tomoche ignorance and blyndenesse. Forthermore those souls yt be in blys
/ desire to take again their bodies for encrese of blys / that they should
have / wha^ yt soul and the body come together / but yt desire noyeth the not /
though they have not their desire / i^ act or in deed. But they joy with a
ghostly desire of knowing / and they feel and taste ioyenge of yt sykernes /
which they have of their desire / yt shall be fulfilled. Therefore though they
have not their desire in act / it noyeth them not / for though they have it
not / their blys fayl^^ not / therefore ye lack of their (...) / causes the^
no pain. And ^^^nke you not yt the body gives (...) blys to ye soul after
the resur^^^^on. It is not so / for if it were ^o / ^^d^s (...) would follow /
yt in to ye ^yme they had again their body^^^ they should have in partyte blys
(...) may not be / for they lack no ^^yon. Wherefore there is no (...) man yt
brings blys to his (...) / but ye soul shall give blys to (...)y. Tha^ shall
ye soul give (...) yeweher habu^daunce of new (...) in the day of Judgment
so (...) ^^othynge of her own flesh (...) iefte / when the soul de^^^^^
(...) ^ody by death. Right (...) is made vndeedly / and al (...) in engthed in
me / so shall (...) be made in the same union (...) ^oly. And all the heaviness
and ^^rosyte of the body shall away and shall be made sotell and light.
Wherefore thou shall understand yt every body gloryfyed / may pass throw ye
stonen walls. Another fire nor water may noye them / and yt is not by the
virtue of ye body / but by yt virtue of you soul. Which soul is properly mine /
given to the body by grace / and by love / throw the which grace and love / I
formed the^ / and made the^ to my image and lykenes. The eye of thy
intelleccyon suffyseth not to se / nor thy eres to here / nor tongue to tell /
nor man's heart to thy^ke / ye great goodness other blys / which is
inestimable. O daughter what great joy have they / which ever behold me yt am
all good. O how much solace they shall have / when they shall be gloryfyed in
their bodies. Which solace al be it they sholden not have in to the day of
dome yet should the souls have no pain for yt lack of their bodies / for yt
blyssed heed of the soul fails not / for she is ever full of blys in
herself / to ye which blys / she shall come with the body / as I have said
before. I told ye of ye goodness yt may not be thought / ye which a body
gloryfyed shall have in ye humanyte gloryfyed of my dear sone / which humanyte
gives to you clearly a sykernes of your resurreccyo^. There they joy and make
the^ glad in his wou^des / which wou^des cese not to cry every day mercy for
you to me yt am the fader. All blyssed souls be comforted with him in joy and
gladness / eye with eye / and with hand / and with all yt hole body of my only
sone. All ye should be confyrmed in me a bydynge / and so ye should dwell in
him / for he is all one with me. The eye of your body as I said / shall have
gladness i^ the humanyte gloryfyed of my sone. And this is the cause / for their
lives ended in ye love of my charity. And therefore with yt charity they ben
parseuer au^te / and abyd^ euerlasty^gely. Not so yt they may do any good / but
they Joy in that love which they had (yt is to say) for they may not have
any merytory deed in excersyce. For here in this life only / me^ sin and do
merytory deeds as the^ like at their own wy^ with their fre choice. They yt
abide i^ blys / abide not ye dyuyne dome with dread / but with joy. The face of my
sone shall not be seen dread full to the^ nor full of hate / for asmoche as
their life ended in my love / and in ye benyuole^ce of their neighbors. Thou
shall also understand / yt there shall no chau^gy^ge of face be i^ hy^ to
their sight / wha he comes to Judge in my majesty / but in the^ yt shall be
^udged of hy^ / to the^ there shall be dredefull chau^gynge of loky^ge. He shall
appear to yt souls yt shall be dapned with ryghtwysenes and hatered / and to
the^ yt shall be saved / with mercy and love Tha^ after ye general Judgment
the pain of dampened souls shall encrese. Daughter I have told yt of the
dygnyte of ryghtfull men / by the which you may know yt more lightly / ye
mysery of the^ yt be dampened. This is an other pain to their myseryes / for to
behold somoche blys of ryghtful me^ / which beholdynge is to the^ encrese of
peynes / as it is to ryghtfull me^ ye da^pnacyon of them that be dampened / an
addycyon of gladness of my goodness / for light is better know for derkenes /
and derkenes for light. Therefore ye sight of seyntes shall be to them pain /
and with pain they adyde the last day of Judgment / for they se well thereby
great encrese of pain to them / and so it shall be. For wha^ it shall be said
to the^ with an hortyble voice / Arise ye yt be deed and come to ye Judgment /
than shall ye soul go again to the body. And in ryghtfull me^ ye body shall
be gloryfyed / of the^ yt shall be dampened the body shall be tourmented without
end. And great stryues shall be ymonge them / and repreues in beholdynge of my
sothefastnes / and of blyssed seyntes. And tha^ ye worm of conscience freteth
yt marowz of yt tree that is the soul / and the utter rynde of the tree that
is the body / ye holy blood that was shed for them they should vndernyme. Also
their deeds of mercy temporal and spyrytual / they should repreue / and that
they did to their neighbor / and other deeds yt they did in their wicked
living for they would not leave their sin al shall be put in reprefe to the^
than. Also they should be repreued of the crueltes / yt they did to their
neighbors / and of yt syn^e of pride / with love of uncleanness / and their
avarice. And when they so yt great mercy which they might have had of me /
their vndernymy^ge shall be much harder tha^ the soul had in time of death.
For at yt general dome yt soul and yt body of such shall be tourmented both
together / for asmoche as ye body was fellow with the souls / and instrument to
work both good and ill / at their own will. Every worky^ge good or ill / is
wrought by some manner of a man's neighbor. Therefore daughter goodness and
glory without end is given ryghtfully to my chose^ souls / with their bodies
gloryfyed / and gracyously they be rewarded for their labors / ye which they
had together body and soul in my name. In yt same manner everlasting pain
shall be give to wicked men with body and soul. Because yt body was instrument
of evil / therefore yt pain shall be made new and increased in yt sight of my
sone / when the soul and the body shall come together / tha^ shall ye wretched
sensualyte be repreued with his uncleanness / beholdy^ge yt humanyte of christ /
joined with yt iy^e of cle^nes of my godheed / and wha^ they behold your nature
of Ada^ / enhau^sed above yt court of angels. Also they shall se themself put
down in to ye depenes of hell / beholdynge yt largenes and yt mercy given to
them yt be blyssed. And wha^ the blyssed souls receive the fruit of my sons
blood / which sone is called ye la^be of god. Also yt blyssed souls do se all
yt peynes which they suffer in yt world / ordained for yt or name^tes of the
bodies / as a raye of gold is put upon a clothe / and yt is not by yt virtue of
yt body / but only by yt ple^tuous blys of yt soul / which represents to
his body yt fruit of his trauayles / because that yt body was assocyate to ye
soul and to ye excersyces of virtues. Also yt body shall be know outewardely
/ and right as a myrrour represents and shows the face of a man / right so
the fruit of his labors shall be presented and showed in his high body as it
is said before. And wha^ al these other souls full of mysery and derkenes
behold somoche dygnyte i^ blyssed souls / of ye which dygnite they be pryued
and excluded / than their pain and co^fusyon increases / for the token of
their wickedness and sins which they did / shall be showed in their bodies
/ with peynes and tourmentours to their tourme^t. Wherefore in that dredefull
word which they shall here / go ye to yt fire euerlasty^ge tha^ shall their
bodies with ye souls go down ever to abide with yt fendes wtoute any remedy of
hope. There they shall sorrow together in their peynes / and to ye encrese of
their peynes / and their wretchydnes with al their fylthes / every man by
himself in diverse wyses / after yt their evil works were diverse in earth. A
covetous man with yt fylthe of his auaryce / bre^nynge there in yt fire with
worldely substance / mhiche wyckedly and falsely he purchased / and loved in
yt world The cruel man shall be tourmenteb with his cruelte / yt unclean man
with his uncleanness and with his wretched co^cupyssence An vnryghtful man with his
untruth and vnryghtfulnes. The enuyous man with his envy. An hatered man with yt
hatered of his neighbor. And forthermore there shall be b^ende^ vnordynate
love o^ ^ma^nes love / of the which ^al^e (...) comes all evil. And ye (...)
a passy^ge pain intolerable / for asmoche ^s yt sin was begynny^ge of all
evil and mother to pride / which is mother of all sins. Wherefore every soul
and body together / shall be punysshed together. And thus myserably they go to
their end / which go by yt lower way of the flode / and will not turn to
knowledge their own defautes / and ask mercy as I said before. But so they
gone to the gates of hell / for they have followed the techynge of yt fend. And
he is their gate / and their entering to hell / as it is said before. And in
yt contrary wise my chosen children which go upon yt bridge above / those go
by yt way of sothefastnes / and yt sothefastnes is to the^ yt gate of entry^ge.
Therefore my sone which is my sothefastnes fayde / (...) m^mdy come to my sader
but by me. He is yt gate and yt way by ye which they pass ou^t yt they may
^^ntre to me / which am yt peaseble see. And so in yt contrary / they yt went
by yt way of pardycyon / which way gives to them a deed water / and so be
peryshed and lost. To yt perel yt fend calls and ^tyrreth such blind
souls and fools / by full peryllous te^ptacyo^s / and false suggestyons
which for blyndenes and lack of grace do not parceyue / nor they take no head
/ how they have lost yt light of very feythe / and follow yt will and the
words of the fend as though he spoke to them and said. Who so has thrust
and desires water of death / let hem come to me / and I shall give it to him.

And here now mother and systren ends the second part of this orcharde / in
the which we be taught the way to he uen. And how we be ordained to labor
in this world / every man in his own vyneyerde. And of three ladders which
help a soul to the love of god. In this party also our lord speaks full
comfortably of his great mercy / and of dyuersyte of sins. And how souls
shall be repreued at the day of Judgment. And of the pryncypall tourmentes in
hell / and of the joys of heaven. Our lord than grant ^^ so fervently to
labor / every man in his own vyneyerde / that b^ the prayer of his blyssed
mother / and by his great mercy / yt we may gracyously escape that drefull day
of Judgment / (...) with his chosen children / to enter in to the gates of
bliss / the glorious sight of him ever to rejoice. Ame^.

The.iii. book.
Tertia. The first chapter of the.iii. party / shows of yt profit of
temptacyons / and how every soul in yt last end of his life shall taste and
feel by knowing ^^ he fully pas / what pain or joy he shall have after he is
passed.
Also how ye fend catches souls budet the color of some goodness / also
this book makes mencyon of a vysyo^ that this blyssed vyrgyn had with diverse
and many matters / as it is rehearsed before i^ the calendar. Ca^ i


THe fend a mynystre ordained of my ryghtwysenesse to tourment souls / which
grievously offend me. And I ordained them in this life / that they should
tempte and do great greuaunce to my creatures. Not for my creatures sholden be
overcome / but forthey sholden overcome the fend / and yt they should receive
of me the glory of vyctory / throw the virtue that is pryued in them. And
therefore no man shall dread the temptacyons of the fend / for any battle that
shall befall hy^. For I have ordained me^ to be strong / and I have given the^
the strength of a will / the which is made mighty in the blood of my sone /
which will no fend nor creature may remove / for your will is toyned to you
of me with a fre chose therefore ye may keep that will at your own choice (as
you like) and releshe it if ye will. That will is an armure / which ye put in
ye ho^de of your adversary. And but yt ye take heed / it is a sword wherewith
he smyteth you / and sometime sleeth you. Nevertheless if a man take not this
sharp sword of his will in to the hondes of the fend (yt is to say) that he
assente not to his temptacyons and greuaunces / he shall never be hurt with
deedly sin throw any temptacyo^s / but rather those te^ptacyo^s shall
strength hy^ so yt he open his eye of intelleccyon to behold my charity /
which charity suffers you to be tempted only / yt ye should come to the
reward that is ordained for virtue. No man may attain to virtues / but throw
the knowing of me / and of himself / which knowing is most parfytely had in
the time of temptacyons. For than a man knows himself / that he is naught of
him self when he may not remove and put away the peynes and greuaunces the
which he desired to void. And than he knows me also in his propre will /
for his will is made strong of my goodness / for asmohce as he co^senteth not to
such wicked thoughts. More over the eye of his intelleccyon sees that my
charity suffers those thoughts / for yt fend is feeble of himself / he may
do naught / but i^ asmoche as I suffer and withdraw my hand. I suffer him not
for hatered that I have to you / but for great love / not for ye should be
overcome of hy^ / but that ye should overcome him / that ye may thereby come to
the parfyte knowledge of me / and of youreselfe. Also that virtue may have
experyence thereby / for virtue has no experyence / but by his contraryte.
Therefore behold well and se that the fendes be but my mynystres / other to
tourment the that be dapned in hell / other to tourmente men in this world for
excersyce in virtues / and experyence in the soul. And yet their intent is for
no excersyce in virtues / nor for experyence / for they have not somoche
charity / but to that intent / that they would take away from them virtues /
and that may they not / but ye will. Sees thou not daughter how much is the
folly of deedly men which make them so feeble / so that I have fulfilled them
with so great strength / and they put themself i^ to ye hondes and power of
fendes. And therefore I will that thou know / yt at ye end of their death / for
asmoche as they made themself soget to the power of the fend / without
constrenynge / for the fend may not compel them / but wylfully they put
themself in to the power of ye fend / therefore at the last end wha^ they
come to death / they abide not other judgment / but with that wicked domynacyo^
/ they deem themself by wickedness of their conseyence. And so without any
hope they pas forth to everlasting peynes of hell / and hell is streyned of
the^ with hatered and or ever that they come to hell / here they have take it
for their hyre and reward / this thou may se by ensamble of a ryghtfull man.
As ryghtfull men which lived in charity / and dye in love when the end or
death comes / y^ they have lived party^^ly in this life in virtue / and be made
light and bright with the light of feythe with crylte shewth ye cye of parfyte
hope / the good and yt profit of the blood of ye holy lamb my sone which I
have ordained to them / than that goodness they coll and clyppe with arms of
love / and ^^reyne me to them in the last end ^theyr lives / with hausynges
of love / which am ye most sovereign and everlasting love. Than in this manner
such men taste the everlasting life / or they leave the heavy but then of their
body (that is to say) or the soul be departed fro the body Other there be ye
lived in comune charity / yt were not in so great parfeccyon / and when they
came to the time of death / they did trust to my mercy with ye light of feyth
and hope / which light the parfyte souls had as I have said before. But yet
they have not ye light of teythe nor hope so parfytely / as parfyte souls have
/ but they have light and hope vnparfyte. And all be it they be vnparfyte / yet
they have my mercy when they know and knowledge yt my mercy is more and larger
than their sins. But wicked men work in the contrary / they se and behold
their abydy^ge place of pain without any hope / and yt they take wtoute my
charity / as I said before Wherefore another of these twain abide other
Judgment / but wha^ they should pas / eueryone knows ye place and abiding
whyder they should go / or they be departed fro the body (that is to say) they
ye should be dampened know their place with pain without charity and with
hatered and dyspyracyon. They also that been partyte and shall go to blys know
their abydy^ge in blys with the light of feythe / and with love / and with
trust of the virtue of the holy blood shedynge / of ye holy meke lamb of my
sone. And other that be vnparfyte with trust on mercy and with the light of
feythe / pass forth to ye place of purgatory / where they shall be purged and
made parfyte / and so to obtain the bliss of heaven. How that the fend always
catches souls under the color of some goodness / and how they that gone by
the great floode and not by the bridge be dysceyued and go to loss. TAke thou
head nowehowe I have told the / how the fend calls and styrreth men to the
water of death (that is to say) to ye water that bly^deth them with worldly
delyces and high states / and catches them with a false hoke of delectacyon
under color of good / for otherwise he may not have them / for they wolden
not suffer themself to be taken nor dysceyued / if they dydynot feel no
goodness in themself. For a soul of his own nature / ever desires goodness
/ but yet sothe it is that a soul sometime is blinded throw his own love /
and tha^ he knows not the venym / nor the dysceyte of the fend / and no
dyscrecyon he has to know yt very goodness / nor what is profitable to the
soul nor to the body. Therefore ye fend when he sees a man so blinded throw
his own propre love / he puts to him diverse states under diverse colors of
some profit or of some virtue or goodness. And that he puts to every man
after his state / and after the pryncypall vices / in ye which he knows
every man after his dysposycyon more ready to fall. Some false suggesty ons he
putteh to a relygyous man / an other thyngehe puts to prelates / an other to
seculers / an other to lords / and an other to servants / to every man after
the degree of diverse states. This I have rehearsed and told the of them / ye
which drownen themself in the floode of the water of death / having no
reward but only to themself (that is to say) louyge themself / and taken
no head of offenses done to me / and of such men I have told the theyrende.
And now forthermore I will she we the / how they dysceyuen themself. The cause
in general is / for when wylfully they wolden fle fro peynes / they fallen in
to peynes. For it seems to the^ / that it a full great labor to follow me
(that is to say) to go by ye way of ye bridge of my sone / therefore they
drawn abacke for dread of the thorn / that is for dread of sharpness / and
that is for they ben utterly blinded / by the which they seen not / nor known
not the way of my sothefastnesse / as thou did know / when I showed it ye in
the begynny^ge of thy life / when thou did pray to me / that I should give
mercy to all the world and to draw them fro derkenesse of deedly sins. Thou
knows well that at that time / I showed me to the in a figure of a tree / of
the which tree thou sauoured begynny^ge nor endy^ge / but only thou did
parceyue that ye root of that tree was joined with ye earth / and that was the
dyuyne nature was knyt with ye nature of your hamanyte. In the foot of the
tree if thou have good mind / there was a thorn / fro the which thorn / all
that dyden love their own sensualyte / dyde^ draw themself fer away fro the
thorn / and stedden in have to an hill / and there was a pot / in ye which
hill I showed the by a figure / all the delyces and vanytes of the world. In
the pot it seemed as there had be where / but there was none / therefore thou saw
well yt many souls dyden perysshe therein for hongre. Some yt known the
perelles of the world / dyden return again to the tree / and wenten myghtly
by the thorn (that is to say) some toke^ a purpose of good will / to take a
way of sharpness / which purpose of sharpness / or it be parformed / is
such a thorn which seems to a man should be followed / to go in to the way
of sothefastnesse. And yet on the one party ye conscience grutcheth / and on ye
other party yt sensualyte grutcheth. Nevertheless anon as a man with hatered
and dysplesaunce of himself / takes a purpose myghtely / and says thus in
his heart / I will follow my lord crucyfyed / than suddenly that purpose
breketh the throw (that is to say) the good will does away the sharpness
/ and than shall he fyude a wonderful sweetness / as I have declared to the
before / some man more / and some man less / after the dysposycyon and besynes
of diverse men. Thou knows at yt time how I said to ye / that your lord was
immovable / and sothe it is / for I am not changed. I withdraw me fro no
creature that will come to me / I have showed ye sothefastnesse to all / and I
have showed me to them and made me vysyble / where I was and am inuysyble. What
is it to love any thing wtoute me / they known not me / nor themself /
because they were made blyde / throw a cloud of vnordynate love and of
desire. Sees you. not how much they ben dysceyued / for they had much rather
to be perysched in ye great see / than to pass throw a little sharpness.
And there may none pass out of this life without the cross / save they that
gone by the highest way / and yet they passen not without some pain / but that
pain is to them a refresshynge. And for asmoche as the world for syn^e
brings you forth thorns and breres / as I told the before / and renneth
throw a stood ye is a see without rest / therefore I have ordained / and given
to you a sure bridge / whereby ye may pass fro yt world and you will. To this
time I have showed the / how that such men dysceyue^ themself with an
vnordynate dread / and how I am pour lord god / which am not changed. And
that I take no head to ye parsones / but to the holy desires of the parsones /
and this I have showed the in a figure of a tree. How the world for sins
brought forth thorns and breres / yet some there ben yt ben not noyed with
them / all be it ye no man may come to bliss / wtoute some pain here suffered
or he pass. NOw I am purposed to show ye which they ben that be harmed of
the thorns and breres / and which not. And for asmoche as to this time I have
showed to the dampnacyo^ of such men (and my goodness) and I told the how
they ben dysceyued of their own propre sensualyte. Now therefore I will show
to the / how they ben hurt of thorns only. Soth it is / no man that is comen
in to this life lives forth with bodyly labor or ghostly. My servants bear
great bodyly labors / their souls be full fre fro that travail / for they
feel no travail / and yt is for their will holy accords with my will. And ye
will it is / yt makes me^ have pain / they beren both bodyly pain and
ghostly (as I said before) which begin to taste and feel here in this life
tokens of hell peynes / as my servants in the contrary do begin here to
sele and savor the tokyns and sykernes of euerlasty^ life. Knows thou not
daughter that it is a full synguler and a great good and reward / which the
blyssed company in heaven have. It is their full will to have his will / whom
they desire and love / they covet me / and for that they covet me / they have
me / and savor me without any rebellyon or withstondynge / for they have left
of and forsaken the heaviness of the body / which was a wicked law of ye
flesh / which stryued against the spyryte. The body was a mean to man /
which body would not suffer him to know ye sothefastnes and that they might
not se me face to face / that might not be / for ye body did let them fro that
sight. After that that the soul has forsake the grievous heaviness of the
body / than is his will fulfilled. For wha^ he desires me / he sees me / i^
whose sight abides al your blys. Wha^ the soul sees he knows / and when he
knows he loves. When he loves me most sovereign and ever lasting goodness
/ than he tastes and sauoureth me. When he tastes / he fulfylleth his will
(that is to say) his desire yt he has to know and behold me / and i^ the
desire he has me / and when he has me / he desires me. And as I said
before / pain is fer fro that desire / and werynes is fer fro replecyon. Also
thou sees that my servants pryncypally should receive their bliss in
knowing of me / and i^ ye sight of me / which sight and knowing of of them /
fulfylleth the will of them in all things. And what the will desires / it
has / and so it is pleynly fulfilled / therefore I said to the / that
syngulerly to taste and sauoure everlasting life / was that which ye will
desires to have. But yet thou shall know / that wha^ yt soul sees me and
knows me / it is fulfilled. And in this life as I said he receives as for a
reward a sykernesse of everlasting life / beginning here i^ a manner to
savor and taste / that they should have after in full replecyo^ without end.
But here thou asks how a soul may feel a sykernesse in this life / I tell ye
it is in the sight of my goodness in him / and in the knowlegynge and knowing
of my sothefastnes / which knowy^ge ye bright and clear intelleccyon he has
in me / which intelleccyo^ is yt eye of the soul. This eye has a little
black in ye eye / which gives sight of holy feythe / which light of ye
feythe / makes a soul to know and to follow ye way and ye doctrine of my
sothefastnesse / that is of my sone incarnate / without this clear sight of
feythe / that way and doctrine is not seen / but as a man sees that has
only the form of an eye / and not ye sight / a cloud covers yt little
black which gives light to the eye. For that little black of of ye
intellectual eye / which gives clear sight / is the holy feythe which black
wha^ a cloud of untruth or of mysbyleue is cast there upon / it sees right
naught / which cloud of mysbyleue comes of a man's own propre love / and
sothe it is / it sees not / for it has a lykenes and form of an eye / but
it has no light For throw his own propre love he has take fro himself /
his own propre light. Thou sees also that in the sight of the intellectual
eye / they have knowing / and when they know / they love / and when they love
/ they leave and forsake their propre will. And wha^ they put their own will /
than they take my will / which desire not but your satysfaccyon. Such that
forsake their own will / they gone away myghtly / fro the party of the lower
way / and begin to ascend up by the bridge / and gone upon thorns. And for
their feet (that is to say) their affeccyons ben according with my will /
therefore the thorns do them no harm. Therefore I told the yt they did suffer
pain bodyly / but no pain to their soul / for their sencyble will is deed /
which brings and causes ye pain / and tourmenteth the soul of a creature.
And when yt sencyble will is voyded / tha^ is yt pain avoided. And more over
they bear all things and do suffer with great reverence / and take it to a great
grace / for my name to be troubled / and they desire nothing / but that I
will. If I suffer them to have any pain throw temptacyon of ye fend to preue
virtue in them / as I said before / they make resystens with a good will / which
will they have made strong and mighty in me / and have meked and loved
themself. And with pease and rest of soul / they thy^ke themself unworthy
any grace or rest demynge themself worthy to have manyfolde peynes / and so
without any pain / or disease / they pass out of this world / with a full
knowing of themself / and with an inward ghostly joy. And this shall be /
wheder they be troubled of ye fend / or wheder sickness tourment them or
pouerte / or any promocyo^ of state in the world / or death of children / or
of fre^des / which be^ al full sharp thorns / the which ye earth brought
forth for sin. And al these thorns they do suffer right pacyently and full
benyngely / with the clear light of reason / and light of the holy feythe /
beholdynge me most soue rain goodness. For I may nothing desire but all
good / if passions and penes I send to the^ it is not for hatered / but for a
faderly love. After time they have known a parfyte love i^ me / anon they
come again to themself / knowing their own defautes. And than they seen
with the light of feythe / that al goodness shall be rewarded / sin shall be
punysshed / and a little sin continued / shall have an infynyte pain / for it
was done against me / the which am infynyte goodness. Also by the light of
this feythe / they take it for a special grace / yt I will amend the^ and
punesshe the^ here in this life / and in this time yt shall have end. So they
reken their sins together / and as they purchase merit / with contrycyon of
heart / or with parfyte pasyence / they ben rewarded with good without end for
their labors. And yet they know well / that all the travail of this short
life is full little. The time only is asmoche / as ye point of an nelde and no
more / and so passes the labor with ye time / for pacye^tly they suffer and
pass throw the actual sharpness of the thorns / and it touches not the
hertes / for their hertes draw out fro them (that is to say) fro the dread of
sharpness / throw the sensyble love that is put in me / and confyrmed throw
desire of love. Than ye sothefastnesse is / yt such that passen pacyently ye
sharpness of the thorn / yt they tasten the life yt shall last / taking in
this life a token / or an ernest / or a sykernesse of yt everlasting life.
When they stand in the water / they bathen them not / when they passen by the
thorns / they feel not the sharpenes. For with all their business they
sought me / which am sovereign goodness. And this they have sought / where it
is pleynly found (ye is to say) i^ ye word of my only begoten sone. Of evil
that comes of blyndenesse of ye eye of intellecyon / and how good deeds done
out of ye state of grace / avails not to the everlasting life. THis I
purpose to declare the / because thou should know it ye better. Also I have
declared to the how they taste the ernest of sykernesse of hell / of the which
manner me^ I have told you they ben dysceyued. Now I shall tell the how sorrow
comes to them and how they receyue^ the ernest or sykernesse of hell. And that
is / for throw their untruth that comes of their own propre love / ye eye
of ye intelleccyon is bly^ded. For right as all sothefastnes is purchased and
won mith ye light of feythe / right so lesynge and dysceyte be^ get and had
with untruth. I speak of untruth and of infydelyte / of them yt have received
the holy baptym / in ye which baptym the light was impressed to ye eye of ye
intelleccyon. And when the time of dyscrecyon was come / if they have excersyce
in virtues / they keep the light of feythe / and bring forth virtues of life
/ and fruit to their neighbor. For right as a woman brings forth and
bears a quycke sone / and yeldeth that quycke sone to her spouse right so they
that keep the light of feythe given to me virtues of life / which am the
spouse of the soul. These other ye which kepe^ not ye light of feythe / work
ye co^traty / for wha^ they come to ye time of dyscrecyo^ / in which time they
should use ye light of feythe and bry^ge forth virtues with ye life of grace /
tha^ bry^ge they forth deed souls (they be^ deed) for all their deeds be^
deed / wha^ they be^ indeedly sin / as to to the way of sanacyo^. And if ye
light of feythe be taken away fro the^ / yet they have ye form of ye sacrament
of baptym / but they have no light / for ye light is taken away by a derke
cloud of sin / ye which is cause of their propre love / which sin
covers the round black in the eye / by ye which he had sight. For such it
is laid feythe without works is deed / wherefore right as a deed man which sees
not / so the ghostly eye sees not / wha^ that is covered ye gives light Also
he knows not / yt he has no bey^ge of himself. Also he knows not his
own defautes / nor my goodness that I do to him / of the which goodness he
had his being and all other grace above him. So that when he knows another me
/ nor himself / he has not his own propre sensualyte / but he loves it and
seeks it to make a way to his appetyte. And so he brings forth deed
children of many deedly sins / and me he loves not / and wha^ he loves not
me / he loves not yt yt I love / yt is his neighbor. And he has no manner
lyky^ge to work nor yet to do that is plesynge to me (that is to say) to do
virtues / which pleseth me to se the^ done in you / not for my profit / for
ye may not profit me / for I am he that have being / and nothing is done
with out me / save syn^e which is naught in himself / for it takes fro me
the soul. Wherefore it ^elyteth me for your profit / that I may have you
nombred in my everlasting life. And thus as thou sees euedently ye feythe of
that other party is deed / for it is without good works / and the works that
they done / done not profit to them / as to ye euerlasty^ge life / for they
have not ye life of grace Nevertheless it is not to leave of good works /
whether they be done with grace or without grace. For there is no good deeds
unrewarded nor the evil deeds vnpunyshedde. Good deeds those ben done in the
state of grace / without the infeccyon deedly sin / and they done give to him
the life euerlasty^ge. And al those good deeds that been done in deedly sin /
they done not profit to him to have ye everlasting life. Nevertheless in
diverse manners it is rewarded / as I have said before. Whereby sometime I gave
them time of repentance / or else I impresse them in the mind of my servants
and in their prayers / throw whose prayers / they void the^ fro their sins.
Sometime when they ben not rewarded with time of abiding / nor with ye prayers
of my servants / for ye lack of grace / with such other / they ben rewarded
than with temporal prosperyte / or with temporal things and make of them as
of beestes to be made fat in the flesh / so those wretched and right
sinful men the which always have been contrary to my will / and have done good
works / not in the state of grace / but in deedly sin / when they wolde^ not
in their workynge receive prayers nor other ghostly helps nor socours with ye
which help I have called them to grace in ye time y they were repreuable /
throw their defautes. Than of my goodness my will is to yield them and reward
them / in temporal things / there they ben wretchydly made fat / and if they
amend not theyrselfe / they gone to everlasting derkenesse and pain.
Therefore daughter se how they be^ dysceyued. who dysceyueth the^? They
themself. They call themself the light of very feythe / and gone as blind
men gropynge and cleuy^ge to that they touch / and because they se no thing
but with a blinded eye which is set by affeccyo^ / i^ passing things and
vanytes. Therefore they ben dysceyued and done as fools which only done
behold yt gold and not the veny^. Therefore know thou for certain that
worldely vanytes that been take and kept wtoute me / or with their propre and
vnordynate love ben repreuable / as I showed it to ye before i^ the lykenes of
a tree / when I said to the / yt such men dyden bear gold before / and venym
bevynde. The venym was not withouten gold / and the gold was not without
venym / but the first beholdynge is gold / and no man kept himself fro the
venym / but all those that weren made clear in syghte / with the very light of
parfyte feythe.

The second chapter tells how the precepts of god may not parfytely be
kept but a man keep the counseyles. And how i^ every state oflyuynge / the
which a man she weth with a good will and holy to god is acceptable and
plesynge to god / and how worldely men with all their riches and goods can not
hold them contented / and of their pain which they deserve for their wicked
will / as well in this life / as after their death / and of other matters / as it
is showed in the kalendre. Ca. ii.
THis that I say is for the^ yt ben made clear in sight with the light of very
feythe with which they cutten away fro my love / the will of their propre
sensualyte / with a sword of two points (ye is to say) with hate of vices /
and love of virtues / and which with the light of reason did keep and get
gold i^ the world. And this I say of the^ / which will have good and keep
good. But they that would use great parfeccyo^ / dyde^ despise temporal
goods / both in will and in deed. Those dyde^ keep ye actual counsel (that
is to say) they kepten ye counsel in deed and actualy / and ye was given to
the^ of my sothefastnes. And they ye hadde^ goods and kept in ye manner / as
it is said before / be^ they that kepe^ ye commau^dyme^tes / and also the
counseles as in will but not actualy / for the counseyles ben so knytte together
with the precepts / that no man may keep the precepts / without he keep the
cou^seyles (not actualy) but in will and good intent (that is to say) because
he keeps such richesse with meekness / and with no pride / but holds them as
goods lend / and has the^ not as for his own goods / but as goods taken
to his use of my goodness. So yt wha^ ye have goods ye kepen the^ to your
propre use / in asmoche as I leave them. And ye keep them asmoche as I suffer /
and I give them and forgive asmoche as I se they be^ spedefull for you. In this
manner wise ye sholden use riches / and otherwise. And when a man so does /
than keeps he my precepts / and loves me above all other things / and his
neighbor as himself. And so a man lives with a fre heart / and casts such
worldely richesse from his desire (that is to say) for he loves them not /
nor he keeps them not / except I grant them to him. And all he it that he
has actually / yet in affeccyons he keeps my cou^seyles (as it is said
before) and casts away fro him ye venym of an unruled love / such manner of
men abyde^ and live in common charity. Other that kepen the foresaid counseyles
both actually and mentally / and as in affection / those be^ in parfyte
charity. For with a very sym plynesse / they kepen the counseyles with my
sothefastnesse which was incarnate / said to him that asked. Master what
shall I do / if yt I shall have euerlasty^ge life? Our lord said again to
him. Keep the commaundymentes. He said to him again. I have parfourmed al
those. Ihesu said again if thou will be parfyte / go and sell all the goods
that you hase / and give them to poor me^. This man was sorry than / for he
kept the good that he had with to much love. Parfyte men kepen the counseyles
/ the which dyspysen the world with all his richesse. Leave they maken their
bodies with great penance as with waking / with meke prayer / and devout
and co^tynuall prayers / and with other afflyccyons. Other that abyden in common
charity and risen not actually fro ye world / yet therefore they losen not the
life euerlasty^ge. For they be^ not bounden to leave those riches /
nevertheless they sholden hold them as I have said. And when they kepe^ the^
so / they offenden not / for all things ben good and parfyte that been made of
me / for I am the highest and the most sovereign goodness / and all goods ben
made to do service to my reasonable creatures. Not so that those creatures
sholden be servants of the richesse of the world / but that my reasonable
creatures sholden lawefully keep such richesse / and have the^. And if it like
them to have richesse / and not to go to greater parfeccyon / so yt the
richesse ben not preferred / but yt they be ever under / and do service to my
creatures / than sholden they yield to m^theyr desire only / and love other
things / and hold them not as their things / but as goods that been lend
them / and granted to their use. I take no head nor nor reward / as for my
parsones nor for states / for in every state ye a man will take and keep / so
that he have a good and an holy will / it shall be acceptable to me. Who is he
than that shall have such riches / in the manner as I have said / they only
that have cast away the venym of their riches / with hate of their propre
sensualyte / and with love of virtues / and utterly putten fro them ye venym of
vnordynate and unruled will. And they yt have set their wylles with my love and
dread / such men and women may chose and keep each state what pleseth them /
and shall be able in every state / to come to the bliss ever endurynge. Not
with stondynge that the parfyte and pleseable state be more acceptable to me
(yt is to say) to arise parfytely / actually / and mentually fro all the
riches of the world. And that feleth himself not able to yt parfeccyo^ throw
his own freylte / may than stand in the common state of living / every man
after his own state. And yt ordained my goodness / so that no man shall he
excused in what state he stand (for sothe it is) they have no excusacyon. For
by compassyo^ I condyscended to their feblenesse and passions / in somoche that
who so will abide in ye passing world may have richesse / and abyden in ye
state of matrymonye / and noryshe their children / and besy them in ye world
for them / and keep what state they will. So yt they cut away the venym of
their propre sensualyte / which brings in the pain and death ever
endurynge. And sothely venym it is / for right as venym brings pain to the
body / and at the last death / but he cast it out yt sooner fro him / or take
some medycyne / right so it is of this cursed scorpyon and veny^ of worldely
love. I say not that they should cast away temporal goods fro themself /
for temporal goods in themself ben good / for of me they ben made and
ordained that am most sovereign good. And therefore a man may use them as he
will / with holy love and very true dread. But I say of the wicked will of a
man / ye which poysoneth the soul bringing in death / but it be cast out
hastily with all manner desires of the heart by devout confession / the which
confession / is ye most sovereign medycyne / that delyuereth a man fro such
veny^ / though it seem right bitter in the sensualyte. Sees you not how now all
such be^ dysceyued that might and they would have me / and also have comfort
and ghostly gladness and put away fro the^ heaviness. And yet rather they
coueyten evil under color of good thing / ever with all manner business and
vnordynate love to gader together gredyly gold. Nevertheless because they ben
blinded with much mystrustynge of infydelyte / they known not this veny^. And
they known well that they be^ poisoned and venymed / and yet they will not
receive no medicyne. Such people done bear the fendes cross / and tasten
without any doubt the ernest of hell. How worldely men with all their richesse
and goods / can not hold them contented / and of the pain yt they deserve
for their wicked wylles / as well in this life / as after their death. I Said
before to the / that will alone is cause why man is punysshed and peyned all
with my servants in asmoche as they lack their own will / and be^ governed
after my will / therefore they feel no pain that greueth the^ but they be^
fulfilled in their souls fely^ge me i^wardeli by grace. And all such that
have not me / may in no wise be fulfilled / and if they had all the world.
For all things yt ben made / ben less of dygnyte than man / for they ben made
for man / and not man for them / and therefore he may not be fulfilled with
the^. I alone may fulfill him / and none but I. Therefore all such worldely
wretches / ben so clypped with yt derke cloud of blyndenesse. Ever they ben besy
/ and labor in vain / always desiring to have such as they shall never have
/ and so they may never be filled. For of me ye may fulfill the^ / they will
no thing ask I tell ye how it stondeth with the^ in peynes / thou knows well
yt love causes pain / when that thing ye is lost / to the which al worldely
me^ ben holy conformed. Worldely me^ conformen them in all manner wyses by
vnordynate love to erthely things / and there by they ben made all earth. For
they have a manner of ghostly impressyon of lykenes with riches. Who is that /
what ever state he stondes in / yt would for any service done to creatures /
have the loss of me. Or who is that ye which makes of his own body by
uncleanness of living / an unreasonable be? All such feden them of the
earth / by desiring of diverse worldely states. And they wolde^ yt they sholden
euerlast / but it will not be / for they passen away as the wind / other by
mean of death / or else I by ryghtwyse ordinance depryue them / fro such
things that they so love vnordynately / and than is their pain intolerable /
for by asmoche as they had such good in possessyo^ by an vnordynate love / by
somoche they lose the^ with sharper pain. Nevertheless if they hadde^ kept
them as goods lent / and not as their propre goods / doubtelesse they
sholde^ have forsake them without pain. And therefore their pain is ye more /
because they have not yt they desire. For as I said the world may not
fulfill the^ / and than they have a great pain / what ben the pains of his
conscience / and what peynes he suffers that will be venged for worldely good
/ I shall tell the. Contynually he freteth himself / and first he sleeth his
own soul / sooner tha^ his ghostly enemy. He is first deed / for he has
sleyne himself / with ye sword of hate. O what pain such a covetous
worldely man ye is enuyous suffers in his conscience / ever so fretynge
himself / and will not suffer himself to have no delight of his neighbors
prosperyte. By this you may know what pain a worldly covetous man suffers of
yt thirst of his auaryce / the which will never fulfill his own need / nor
ye necessyte of other. Thus than of all such things that a man loves in ye
sensualyte of his flesh / he draws to him by many inordinate dredes / and
much pain of conscience. They take upon them wylfully for to bear ye deuylles
peynefull cross in tastynge here of the ernest of hell. And the seek people
lyuen in this world / in many manner diverse wyses of ghostly peynes at the last
but if they amend them / for to receive death everlasting. All such ben in
the way of sothefastnes / that in this world ben hurt by thorns of many
trybulacyons / tourmenty^ge themself by their own, vnordynate and mysruled
will. All such have tourmente of body and of soul / for with peynes and
tourmentes ye body and the soul ben torn in pieces / in asmoche as they gate
gold / and wanne riches of ye world / with an vnordynate and myse ruled love.
And so they be^ depryued of ye life of grace and affection of charity / and
they ben made trees of death / and therefore all their works ben deed / for
they lyuen in great peynes / walowynge in the floode that ledeth to the water
of death / passing forth with hate by the fendes gate / and so they receive
endelesse da^pnacyo^. Now thou knows how they that maken them wylfully the
deuyls martyrs dysceyue^ themself / and with what peynes they dyscende and
gone down to hell. What is that trowes thou that blyndeth them? Nothing else
/ but a cloud trewely of their own mysruled and dysordynate love laid over
the clear syghte of ye holy feythe. Thou knows also how worldely trybulacyons
/ i^ what manner they come. They hurten only bodyly my special servants /
because they be^ cast out of ye world but yet they ben not hurt spyrytually
(that is in the soul) in asmoche as with a very true will / they ben
conformed and made like to me / and therefore it is to them great comfort and
joy / to suffer pain for me. The servants of the world ben tourmented /
both within and without and specially within / for the great dread they have
to lose their temporal goods / and also for love / desiring yt they may not
have. Other manner vexacyons yt they have beside these / ben two pry^cypall
causes / that is dread of losing / and love of wynny^ge / which thy tongue is
not suffycyent / nor yet able to tell. Sees thou not now therefore ye in this
life ryghtwysemen be^ at more ease in soul tha^ sinners (me thy^ke thou
should) for thou hase now seen the living and ye ending of both. How a
dread that is bounden / or a seruyle dread ben not suffycyent to obtain
euerlasty^ge life / and how with excercyse of this dread a man. may come to ye
excercyse of virtues. NNw I have said to the and declared / that there be some
ye which felen them tourmented of worldely try bulacyons / and I will that it
be so / that a soul may know her imparfeccyo^ and end / and also to know
that this wretched life / and yt worldely vanyce is vnparfyte and tra^sytory.
This a soul may know by this token / when she desires inwardely me / that
am her end by such inwardely desire / a soul begins first to put away
the cloud that has long blinded her fro ye clear syghte of virtue. And than
by seruyle dread of trybulacyons / she begins to come out of the floode yt
she had long be dre^ched in / casty^ge out fro her the venym / with ye hate
that she was poisoned with / ye which was cast out of the scorpyon in ye
likeness of gold / and so was received unmannerly / and nothing manerly /
wherefore it was turned to them that did receive it / in to veny^ They knowy^ge
this begy^nynge gracyously to arise / and toward the haven begin to set their
pases / cle^ynge first to the same bridge / of the which I spoke of before.
Nevertheless it is not enough only for to go to this bridge with seruyle
dread / for that dread does nothy^ge else but purges a soul fro deedly
sins / but it fulfylleth not her with virtues grounded i^ love. And therefore
it is not enough only in seruyle dride to wynue everlasting life / but if
the fete be set upon the tyrste step of the bridge / that is desire and
affection / the which be ye fete of the soul / bryngy^ge her in to affection
of my very sothefastnesse / of the which as I said before / I have made a
bridge. This is the ladder / upon the which I would ye should step up / for my
very sone has made ladders to step upon. Nevertheless sothe it is / that this
is a general rysynge / which comynly worldely men do use / that is for to
rise first for dread of pain. And also because that often times aduersytes of
this world brings them in to great heaviness / and therefore a man begins
to be despised with them. And if they use this dread with light of true feythe /
doubt not but they shall come to the love of virtue. There ben some yt gone out
so dull and so slugyshly out of this deep floode of worldely love / yt often
times they fallen therein again. For after time they come to ye haue^ of yt
stood / by coming against them of contrary wyndes / the ben ouertyrued again
by ye reawes of the sea / unto the cloudy vallaye of derkenesse of the
wretchydnesse of this life. And though there come a happy wind / they will not
in no wise quyckely step upon the first degree / that is affection and love of
virtue to ghostly delyces / but as me^ ye were made dull / and slugyshly they
gone forth / I doubt not but that with such a myse ruled plesaunce / they
shall turn backewarde. Also if the wind or tempest blow by vnpasyence / they
will turn their backs / because they hate not verily sin / only for the
offense done to me / but only fro dread of pain / ye which pain follows
them / as them seems. This is no parfyte rysynge / for all virtues rysynge go
forth with parseuerau^ce / without whom / no man may come to the effect and
speed of his desire / that is to that end for whom he brgan / to ye which he
shall never come with out parseueraunce / and therefore yt his desire may be
fulfilled / parseuerau^ce is right nedeful. I said also to the that such
tournen them after diverse styrrynges / that fall to the^ / other by impugnynge
of their own sensualyte within themself against the spyryte / or else by
tournynge of their affeccyons / by vnordynate love to all creatures without me
/ or else by vnpasyence of wro^ges that ghey do suffer / other offendes / or of
diverse outward batayles / and other while by styrrynge and chastysynge or
vexynge of ghostly enemies / that they might bring them the sooner in to shame
and confusyo^ / saying thus to the^. The good thing the which thou hase
begone / shall be to the no profit / for thy sins and defautes be more than
those. This ye enemy does / for he should leave of / and cees of such virtues
and desires / that he has begone. Otherwise also he te^pteth him with to
much delight and delectacyon of his good deeds / that is with the hope that he
receives of my mercy / saying thus to him. Why will thou labor and vex
thyselfe / be glad and joyful in this life / thinking that at the last thou
shall have mercy. In this wise and in many other sotell and diverse manners of
temptacyons wretchydly they gone abacke / and in no wise they ben parseuerau^t
and stydfast. And ye cause of all this is nothy^ge else / but that the root of
her own propre love is not fully put away. And therefore they ben not stable
and abydy^ge / but with right great presumpcyon they receyuen mercy by the hope
that their enemy has put them in. Not for they should worthily receive my
mercy / but yt vncu^nyngly as presumptuous people they should trust therein / ye
which mercy is every day offended by the^. I give not my mercy to the^ / they
for to offend it by presumpcyo^ / but because they sholden defend them thereby
fro wicked desires of fendes fro the mysruled and dysordynate confusyon / and
shame of the soul. But they done the contrary / for with the arm of my mercy
/ they offenden me / and that is because they use not / nor have not in
excersyce / their first chaungynge that they began / for to arise with dread fro
pain / and fro manyfolde pryckynges of trybulacyons / and fro wretchydnesse of
deedly sins. And therefore by cause they withdraw them out fro this depenesse
none otherwise / therefore they may not attain for to come to ye love of
virtues / nor they may win no parseuerau^ce. A soul is ever mouy^ge / and
therefore if it go not forth by virtues / it must needs go back ward in vices
/ to stand still (ye may it not) all such may never profit in virtue / as
long as they atteyne not the love thereof / but they must needs go still
backewarde.

The.iii. chapter tells / how this soul fell in a mourning for the
blyndenesse of them which were drowned in the floode before said. Also how
the grees be^ fygured in the foresaid bridge / that is to say in gods sone /
betokens the very.iii. myghtes of the soul / and of other matters / as is
written before in ye calendar. Ca. iii.
THan this devout soul anguysshed by great desire and coueted to know her
imparfeccyo^ / both of herself and of other / having ruthe and pity upon the
blyndenesse of such wretchyd creatures. And when she had long beholden the
goodness of god / that in what state any creature reasonable sto^deth in / if he
will himself / he may win ways of sanacyon / and not be let. For all thing
may be to him for excersyce and experyence of virtue. Yet nevertheless by their
own propre love and vnordynate affection / they go backewarde and will not
amend them / but rather walk in the water of the fallen floode beforesayde /
and so as she seemed / they went first to hell. And many of them that did
begy^n to go / went fast back ward / when she had herd by the goodness of god
/ ye was his pleasure to show her of him self / the cause of all this by the
which she was brought in to great sorrow / tha^ she set stydfastly her eye of
understanding to the endelesse fader of light / and said thus. O meruaylous
love of goodness / great dysceyte is ymonge thy creatures / I would if it were
plesy^ge to thy endeles goodness / know more largely and dyffusely the three
degrees / fygured in the body of thy only begoten sone / and what manner men
may hold and keep / that they may come parfytely out of ye floode / and to
go virtuously in the way of thy truth / and also who be they that ascend
upon the ladder. How three degrees ben fygured in the foresaid bridge (that is
to say) in gods sone / be to keneth the three myghtes of the soul. Than ye
meruaylous goodness of god / beholdy^ge the desire and ghostly hongre of that
soul / with the eye of his mercy / answered and said thus. Right well byloued
daughter / I am no dyspyser of holy desires / but rather a devout receyuer of
holy desires / and therefore I will declare to the / all yt thou does ask of
me. Thou does ask three degrees to be declared to the / and also I shall tell
the what manner of wise they should have the^ that comen out of this floode /
and will ascend upon this bridge. And though I told ye before ye dysceyte and
blyndenesse of man / and how he tastes in manner in this world the ernest of
hell / and how they receive everlasting dampnacyon / as ye beuyls martyrres /
whose manner of living is rehearsed before / ye which I told the took of the
wicked works of fendes / where also I told the by what manner wise they may
wtdrawe the^ fro such manner living if they will. Nevertheless to till fill
thy desire / I shall declare to the them more largely. Thou knows right well /
that all manner of wylles be grounded in a man's propre love / the which love
is a manner of a cloud / that takes away ye light of reason / that is the
light of very feythe / which the reason keeps wtin her / and that one may not
be lost without the other. At the beginning when I made man's soul I made it
to the image and likeness of me / gyuynge to her mind / understondynge and
will. But the worthyer party of the soul is intelleccyon or understanding /
for understanding is moved of affeccyo^ / and understanding moves affection.
The mouynge or styrrynge of love (that is to say) of affection / enformeth the
mind and teeheth it how that it should not forgete the benefytes received of
me / by the which mind / the love is made belly and nothing slow nor dull /
and ye love or the affection of love / makes the mind kind and nothing
unkind. And thus one might or power of the soul / is helping and
contrybutory to an other / and so is the soul fed in the life of grace. A
s^nle may by no manner of way live without love / but ever it must love some
thing / for of love it is made. And therefore I said to the (if you have good
remembrance) that affection of love is moved or styrred by understanding / as
though he said thus. I will love / for the meet that I use / is love, Tha^
efte sons she feeling herself styrred by the effect and speed of love /
anon she aryseth (as though love said thus) if thou will love well / that you
asks I shall give ye. And anon with that she arysethe up / and beholds so
great worthynesse of me and vnworthynese of the soul / in the which
unworthiness / she is fall by her own sins. And how by the worthynesse of
their own being / she tastes my uncreate charity and meruaylous goodness /
by the which I made her / and in beholdynge of her own wretchydnes she
fyndeth and tastes my mercy / for by my mercy I have draw her out of
derkenesse / and lend her a time and space of amedement / tha^ is affection
noryshed in love / opening ye mouth of her holy desire / by ye which
sheeteth and deuoureth by dysplesau^ce and hate her propre sensualyte with very
mekenes and parfyte pasyence / ye which she has won by ye hate of
herself. After time therefore virtues be conceived / whether a soul work with
them parfytely or vnparfytely / as she uses parfeccyon / or vnperfeccyo^ in
herself / as I shall tell the afterward. If it so be that ye outward feeling
of affeccyo^ move herself so / that ye eye of her vnderstondy^ge only love
outewarde sensyble things / than ye affection moves herself / and only
puts before the eye of understanding with her own propre love worldely and
tra^sytory vanytes / with dysplesaunce of virtue and love of vices / whereby she
draws to her both pride and vnpasyence. And so the mind is with nothing
else fulfilled / but with such thing that ye mysse ruled affection has
given unto her. This most wretched love has so blinded ye eye of intelleccyon
/ yt it can another deserne nor take more clear light / than it has received.
For that is to hy^ as him seems right clear (and it is vice colored) by the
color of his own propre good / and the soul so offended. But because the
eye of understanding sees not herself for her own blyndenesse / she may in
no wise know ye truth / and therefore the erreth and goes out of the way /
searching other delyces and other goods than (...) me. (...) In an other place
I said so the ye all worldely delytes be not (...) without me / but rather they
be (...) / gethornes tha^ delyces. In the same wise intelleccyo^ or
understanding is dyseeyued in her own ^^ght and will in her own love loving
such things as she should not love. And in the same wise mind in her keeping
and retencyons / understanding follows the manners of a thief / ye reueth an
other fro his good. In the same wise mind co^tynually remembers of such
things yt be utterly without me. And of such things / the soul wylfully
depryueth her from grace. These three myghtes of the soul be so myghtely knytte
together / ye I may not be offended of ye one / but ye I be offended of all
three / for one takes of an other good or ill / as it is declared before. What
yt ever lyketh or pleases ye fre choice / yt same pleases the affection. And
therefore as ye affeccyo^ lyketh / so she styrreth and moves fre choice / or
with out light of reason. Nevertheless ye have ye use of reasou knytte in me so
yt fre choice fall not in you by vnordynate love. Ye have also a contrary law
of the flesh repugny^ge contynually against the spyryte. Two parties
therefore ye have in youreselfe / that is sensualyte and reason. Sensualy is a
servant ye which is ordained to serve ye soul / that ye may have
experye^ce of virtue by the instrumente of the body. The soul is fre fro sin
/ delivered by the blood of my sone / and therefore she may in no wise be
brought in bondage / but if she consent by her own will / the which is
bound and knytte by fre choice / for fre choice is made one with will
according with her. The which fre choice is knytte to the same will / in the
mids of sensualyte and reason / that to which of both she wyltourne she
may. Forthermore sothe it is / that when that ever the soul will gadre
together her myghtes in my name / by the hand of fre choice / as I have
declared to the before / that what that she does / or yet all that she
gadereth be spyrytuall thy^nges And so fre choice with sensualyte is losed and
knytte to reason / tha^ with truth / I rest in the mids of the^. This it is
that my sothefastnes spoke of (saying thus) when two or three ben gadered
together in my name / I am in the mids of the^. Also I said to the that no
man may come to me / but by my only sone / that is the way of sothefastnes.
And therefore I have made a bridge of him / with three grees / the which grees
be fygured by ye three states of the soul / as I shall tell the afterward. How
these three myghtes of the soul / if they be not oned together / there may no
parseuerau^ce be had / without the which parseueraunce / no man may come to
ye end of parfeccyon. THe figure of these three grees i^ general I have
declared to the / be the three myghtes of the soul / the which by manner of
symylytude be three ladders. And he that will pass forth by ye bridge and
doctrine of my truth / he may not ascend up by that one ladder / but if he
ascend also by the other. Right so a soul may have no parseuerau^ce of virtue
/ but if she knytte and Join together these three myghtes / of the which
parseueraune I told ye before / when thou did ask of me the manner / the
which those yt comen out of the floode should hold for to be delivered out of
the perell of the same floode. And there also I said to the / that I would
declare to the more openly those three degrees. And than I said that without
parseueraunce / there may no man come another to the end of parfeccyon / nor
of vices / for virtues and also vices do ask parseueraunce. If thou do covet
to come to life / thou must contynu and parseuer in virtue / and he ye desires
to go forth to endelesse death / he must parseuer in vices. So than a man may
come to me that am life of all things / with parseuerau^ce of virtue / and also
with parseuerau^ce of vice he may come for to taste the deed water of fendes. An
exposycyo^ of the word of christ / where he said. Si quis sitit. etc. That is
to say / if any man have thruste let him come to me and dry^ke. ALl ye be bid
generally / and specially of my sone (ye lamb of truth) ye which did cry in
the temple with a great desire / seeing thus to you. Si quis sitit veniat ad
me et bibat. if any man have thrust / let him come to me and drgnke / for I am
a well of water of life / he said not go to my fader and drink / but he said
come to me. Why / For in me that am the fader / might never pain fall / but it
was than in my sone. And therefore while ye be pilgrims and passyngers in this
world ye may in no manner wise pass without pain. For of sin as it is
said before / ye earth has brought forth thorns and breres. And why said
he so / come to me and drink? By cause all that did sue his doctrine / or
such that did draw nyghe to him / otherby keeping of his commaundymentes with
the cou^seyles mentally / or by his precepts / with the counseyles actually.
That is in going by ye way of parfyte charity / or by the way of comune
charity / as I have told the before / by what manner of wise in these ways ye
come to him by showing of his doctrine / ye find anon what ye should drink
/ that is the fruit of his precious blood. And also by tasty^ge of his dyuyne
nature knytte and oned in mankind / and than ye so abiding in him / shall also
find yourselfe in me / that am the peaseable see / for I am one with him / and
he one with me. In this manner ye be bid for to come to the well of lyfely water
of grace. Therefore it behooves to you for to keep virtue and hold it with
parseuerau^ce / that ye may come to the same bridge before said / so ye
another thorns / nor contrary wyndes / nor prosperyte / nor aduersyte / nor no
other tolerable pain / remove you away from your holy purpose / but rather
ye should parseuer and dure till ye come to me that shall give you water of
lyfely grace / the which I shall deliver you by ye medyacyo^ of my sweet and
right dear byloued sone Ihesu But why saydehe / I am a well of water of life?
Because he was and is a well which conteyneth me / yt gives lyfely water of
grace / by the knyttynge together of ye dyuyne nature / with the pure nature of
ye ma^heed. Why said he also / come to me and drink / for ye may not pass
without pain / and in me might never pain fall / but i^ him. And because I
have made of him to you a bridge / therefore there may none come to me / but by
him / as he says himself. Nemo potest venire ad patre^. etc. There may none
come to the fader / but by me / and so my only sone that is the very
sothefastnesse / has spoke my truth. Now thou may well parceyue what way
and what manner behooves the to keep and to hold yt is with parseyueraunce. For
by no other way ye drink of my well of life / for parseueraunce is a virtue
that lives vyctoryously by life everlasting in me / and receives joy and a
crown of a special reward. How every reasonable creature generally may keep
all manner of governance / so that he may pas out fro the sea of the world /
and go by ye foresaid holy bridge. ANd therefore eftesones I take again those
three grees by whom ye must needs walk / lest ye stood arise and ye peryshe
therein. And that ye may also come parfytely to ye water of life / to whom ye
be byden swetely for to come. And if you will that I be in ye mids of you
(that is to say) within your hertes / with parfyte love and charity / tha^
may ye pass forth much ye better upon ye bridge that is my only begote^
sone. For when I am in the mids of you / there is great habundaunce of
virtues / with benefytes and great gifts innumerable / when ye suffer me there
to have a dwelly^ge place by perfyte pusyence of heart and my^de. Therefore they
that coueter for to walk / they must needs have thrust for only all they that
have thruste / be bide to dry^ke of this well of grace for he says himself /
he yt thrusts come to me and drink. He that thrusts not / pseuereth not in
his Iournaye / but without contynual passing forth / he abides and taryeth /
other by delectacyon / other by werynesse of his labor. And such one cares
not nor yet gives no force though he bry^ge no vessel with him / wherwt he
might draw water and bring it with him / nor he is not sorry in his mind if
he go alone without company / nor to assocyate virtue / and yet he gothe not
alone for there as virtue fails / vices do follow. And therefore he gothe
abacke when he sees the pryckynge of parsecucyons come / the which ben full
enemies to his good purpose. He dredeth also for to have felyshyp / and yet of
a truth if he had virtuous fely ship / such dredes should than pass away
from him. And also if he had ascended up perfytely those three grees
beforesayde in truth / he should be sure enough. Ye must have therefore
thruste / and gader yourselfe together virtuously for my sothefast sone says /
where two or three be gadered together i^ my name / in ye mids of them am I.
And why says he.ii. or.iii? For ii. be not wtoute.iii. nor.iii. wtoute.ii.
nor.iii. nor.ii. without many.i. is fully excluded fro me / for in the mids of
him may I not be / and because he has no felyshyp / I may not stand in the
mids / he lacks a fellow and is a lone / that abides and taryeth in his
own propre love Such one is departed from my grace / and also he is departed
from the charity of his neighbor / and so depryued fro me because of his
sins / and so he is turned verily to naught. Therefore such one that goes
so by himself alone / and one by his propre love / is not in ye nombre nor
told of the very sothefastenesse of my only begoten sone Ihesu. My sone he
said also / if two or three be gadered together in my name / with parfyte love
and presynge to my name / than I am in ye mydes of them. Also I said to the ye
two without three might not be / nor three may not be nor stand with out two /
and sothe it is. Thou knows right well that the comau^dymentes of the law do
stand in two things only / and without those two no co^maundyment may be
kept / that is to lou^me above all things / and thy neighbor as thy self /
this is the begy^nynge of the law of the commaundymentes / and also it is the
mids and the end. These two without three may not be set nor gadered
togydre in my name / without gadery^ge togydre of the three myghtes of the soul
/ that is of mind / Intelleccyon / and will. So yt by the mind or memory of
my great benefytes or gifts / a man has mind of the before said goodness
in himself. And the intelleccyon or understanding / beholds only and
verily in my vnspectable and meruaylous love / the which love I showed you by
mean and medyacyon of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ / whom I put and
set after the eye of your understanding / that your understanding may se
in him the great might of my most brennynge charity. And than shall the will
be gadered to him loving me and desiring me their end. With these three
myghtes and virtues of the soul gadered together by grace / in ye mids of
the^ I am. Tha^ in asmoche as a man fyndeth him fulfilled and replete / both
with the love and charity of me and also of his neighbor / anon he
parceyueth in himself the great felyshyp and company of many ryall virtues /
and than he dysposeth him to have the thrust and the appetyte of ye soul / ye
which thrust is nothing else / but the thruste of virtue and of my worship /
and also of health of souls. Tha^ he gothe surely without any seruyle dread /
yt thus has ascended the first gre of his affection. For affection is
dyspoyled fro his own propre love / ther^ore he ascends above himself / and
above all transyry things / louy^ge and beholdynge all such transytory
things / if he will keep them and hold them only in my name / and in no wise
without me / that is with holy and very dread / and for love of virtue. Than
such a man fyndeth well that he ascends the second degree / which is the
light of understanding / that beholds and consydereth my excessyue passing
love in my sone christ crucified. By whom as by a mean / I have showed the same
love to mankind / tha^ he fyndeth pease and rest / for his memory or my^de is
not fer fro my fervent charity. Thou knows well ye a void vessel gives a
sown wha^ it is touched / when it is full it does not so. In the same manner
wha^ mind / or memory is full with the understanding or intelleccyo^ / and
with affection full of love / if it be touched tha^ other with trybulacyo^s of
ye world other delectacyons / it cries not by vnordynate joy / nor also by
impasyence weyleth not / for it is full of me that am al good. After time that a
man is ascended thus / he fyndeth him gadered together / for if reason have
those three degrees of.iij. myghtes of the soul as I have said (in my name)
each of them be gadered together. So than when tweyne (that is love of me / and
love of thy neighbor) be gadered together / and mind or memory is brought
thereto. As for the third for to keep and hold retentyfely and understand for
to se and behold / and also will for to love. Than a soul fyndeth her
felyshyp with me / tha^ I am her very sykernesse / and toure of strength She
fyndeth than also the felyshyp of virtue / and so she gothe right surely / and
dwells full parfytely / for I am in ye mids of her. Tha^ she moves
herself with a gredy desire / for to follow and show the very way of truth
/ by ye which way it fyndeth the well of lyfely water of grace. Of the thrust
that it has for the worship of my name / and she desires also ye way of
health both for her own soul / and also for her neighbor / for without
such ways / such may not parfytely walk and go. Than as she goes / she
bears with her a vessel void fro all vnordynate affection of the heart and
worldely love / and anon because it is so void / it is filled again / for it
may not be void / for other it must be fulfilled with some materyal thing or
else with the air. So the heart is a vessel yt may in no wise stand void /
for when it is voyded fro all things of transytory vanyte / it is full of air
/ that is with my heavenly and most swetest dyuyne love / by the which mean
she comes to the water of grace. And than wha^ she is come thereto / she does
pass and go forth by the gate of christ crucyfyed and so tastes the water of
lyfely grace renny^ge as a river quyckly in me / that am the peaseable see.
Here is a repetycyon of some words spoken of before. Now clearly I have
showed to the the manner that every reasonable creature i^ general should hold
and keep / that he might pass out of ye great see of this world / lest he
perysshe and go to everlasting da^pnacyon. Three general grees I have also
showed to the / the which grees be ye three myghtes of ye soul And also that
there may no man assende upon one degree / without he assende on both the
other. Over more I told the of that word that my sothefaste sone spoke /
where he said thus. Where to or three be gadered together i^ my name / in ye
mids of them am I. And how those words be understand / the gadery^ge
together of those three grees besayde / that is of the three myghtes of the soul
/ the which three myghtes according to one / bring with the^ two pryncypall
commaundymentes of the law / that is my love and the love of thy neighbor.
Souereynly to love me above all things / and thy neighbor as thyselfe After
this when ye he has thus ascended the ladders by gaderynge together i^ my name
as I have said he receives the water of grace to slake his thruste. And that
received he sets his foot for to go upon the bridge of my very sothefast
sone suynge and following his doctrine Also I have said / ye run after his
voice / the which calls you / and says thus openly in the temple Who that
has thrust / come to me and drink / that am a well of lyfely water / where I
declared to ye / how these words should be understand that thou might know
the better the habundaunce of my plentuous charity / and also the confusyon and
shame of them that wylfully run by the way of the fend / the which byddeth
and calls them to the water of death. Now also thou hase seen and herd of
that thing ye which thou does ask of me / that is of the manner of rete^cyon
and keeping that they perysshe not (and there he he said) they that have the
manner of retencyon and keeping / must have it by ye ascendynge on the bridge /
in the which ascendynge up they be gadered together and knytte in one /
dwelling and abiding in ye love of their neighbors / offry^ge to me the
affection of your hertes / as a vessel voyded fro all manner worldely and
transytory loves / to the which vessel I put or power in lycoure of lyfely
graces / to them yt ask such drink / keeping the same drink with
parseuerau^ce / passing forth in the way of my only sothefaste sone christ
crucyfyed / unto the last end of their lives. This is that manner / ye which
al ye owe to to keep in what state ye ever ye stand in / for there shall no
state excuse him what ever he be / but that he may keep this manner / and is
bound to keep it. And also he may do it / and therefore he should do it / and
ther^o is bound every reasonable creature. There may no reasonable creature
excuse hy^ fro it / though he said (I have letty^ge) other by his state of
lyuy^ge or by his children / other by worldely impedyme^tes / wherefore he
says that he may not follow such a way of living. Nor also they may not
excuse them / for dyffycultes and hardenes that they find in ye same way. For
I told yt yt every state is to me plesaunte and acceptable / so it be kept
and had with an holy good will. For all things be good and parfyte made of me /
yt am most sovereign good. They be not made and granted of me to you / yt ye
take by them your death but your life. There is nothing so delectable to me
/ as is love / and therefore I ask nothy^ge else of you / but love / that is
love of me / and love of your neighbors / the which may be had and kept in
all times / all places / and in every astate that a man is in / loving and
keeping / to worship and glory of my name all things. Also knows thou not how
I said to the / yt some pass forth in this life dysceyued with worldely goods
/ not going with light / but covering them by vnordynate love / and louy^ge
creatures / and keeping such temporal goods without me. All such I told the
be so greatly tourmented / that they be passyngely intolerable to themself.
And if they with draw not / and put away such vnordynate love in the manner
before said / they pass very fast to endeles dampnacyon. And now at the last
I have told the / what manner a man shall keep most generally.

The fourte chapter tells when our lord would show to this devout soul
/ yt the three grees of the bridge be fygured by the three states of the soul.
Than he bad her lift up herself above herself to behold this sothefastnesse.
Also how this devout soul beholdynge in the myrrour of god saw diverse
creatures go in diverse ways / and of other matters / as is rrhersed in ye
kalendre. Ca. iiii.
Because I said to the before how they should go yt be in common charity (that
is for to say / they yt keep the counseyles mentally / and the co^maudyme^tes
actually. Now therefore I purpose to show to the of the^ that have begone to
ascend upon the ladder / and begin to go in the way of parfeccyon / that is
in the obseruau^ce of the commau^dymentes and counseyles actually / wherein I
shall show to the three degrres and states of the soul / also three degrees the
which I put to the before in general for the myghtes of the soul / of the
which degrees / one is vnparfyte / an other parfyte / and ye third is found
most parfyte. One is to me a hired servant / an other as a true servant /
and the third is a well byloued sone / because he loves me only without any
other cause but only for myself. These ben those three states the which must
be in many creatures / and also they must be in one creature alone. In one
creature they must be / when such a creature with parfyte business / renneth
by the same way beforesayde / spending well his time So that he may with
such good use of his time spe^dynge / come fro the dread of bondage / unto ye
dread of fredome / and so at the last come fro fre dread / unto ye chyldely
dread yt is to ye love of chaste dread. Lift up therefore thyselfe above thyselfe
/ and open thy eyes of vnderstondy^ge and behold these pilgrims and
strangers how they pas forth. Some by the way of counsel vnparfytely gone /
and some partytely holding and using the same way. Se and behold clearly by
the^ / where is parfyte parfeccyo^ / and also how great ye dysceyte is / that
a soul receueth in herself / for the root of her own love / is not yet put
away fro her. In what state that ever a man stondeth in / him needs therefore
to slay and dystroye his own propre love in himself. Than this soul
brennynge in love / and gredy in desire beholdynge herself / saw in ye sweet
myrrour of the godheed creatures going in diverse manners and in diverse wyses /
atteynynge to the same end / that they seken. Also she saw many that did
begin to ascend up / because they field them prycked of seruyle dread (that
is to say) dredynge their own propre pain they left of. And some she saw
by excersyce of her first calling / come by ascencyon to the second gree /
but sewe she saw come to the most parfyte degree of parfeccyon. How this
devout soul beholdynge in ye myrrour of god / saw diverse creatures / go in
diverse manners. THan the goodness of god yeldynge satysfaccyon to the desire of
such a devout soul / sa^de thus Sees thou not these that with seruyle dread
have cyse fro ye vomyte of deedly sins / if they rise not with love of virtue
/ seruyle dread is not suffycyent alone to give them everlasting life / but
it be meddled with holy dread and chaste / that is with my love of virtue / for
in love and holy chaste dread / the law is set. The law of dread is ye old
law / the which I gave to Moses / that was grounded only in dread / because
as soon as they had sinned in his days / anon they did suffer pain
therefore. But the law of love / is the new law / given of my very sothefast
sone Ihesu / the which is grounded in charytable love. And yet the old law
is not broke for the new / but rather fulfilled / so says my sothefaste sone
Ihesu / I came not for to break and unloose the old law / but for to fulfill
it. He coupled and knytte ye law of dread / with the law of love / the
imparfeccyo^ of the dread of pain only / was withdraw fro it / only by
abydy^ge the imparfeccyon of holy dread. I call that holy dread / that will not
of send me / that am most sovereign good / and that rather is aferde to
offend me / than for any pain that it should have for any offense ye whi^^
does. And the law of impar^^ccyon is made parfyte and holy / by the parfyte
law of love. After ^^me ye bre^nynge chare of my only ^othefast sone was come
to the which brought with him fere of my brennynge charity in to mankind / the
pain of hasty punishment of sins done i^ this life / was done away by the
habundaunce of my mercy. For creatures were not / nor be not punyshed anon as
they had done offe^ses against me / as it was done in old time in ye law of
Moses / without any interuall of time / but now mercyably / I abide the
repentance of mankind. Nevertheless sin shall not yet be unpunished / for
though it be not amended here / it shall be correcked in an other place / but
if it be worthily punyshed here / by dew and parfyte co^trycyo^. As long as a
man lives here / it is time of mercy to him / and after time he is deed / than
is time of right wysenesse. Therefore every man should now arise fro seruyle
dread / and besy him for to come to my love and holy dread / or else with out
any remedy he shall be drowned in the floode beforesayde / by the waves of
trybulacyo^s comy^ge against him. And by ye covetous thorns of worldely
comfort / the which be very thorns pryckynge the soul / and loves them
vnornately / and keeps them. How the dread of seruage without love of virtues /
is not suffycyent to ever lasting life / and how the law of dread and the
law of love be oned together. I Said to the that there may no man go by the
bridge / nor pass out of ye floode but needs he must ascend upon three grees.
And sothe it is / that some asce^de vnparfytely / some parfytely and some with
great parfeccyon. All such therefore that with seruyle dread ben only lad and
governed / ascend vnparfytely gadery^ge together the myghtes of the soul. That
is wha^ ye soul sees pain follow sin / for fere of that pain it ryseth
out fro sin / and asce^deth up and gadereth the mind together / thereby to
pull away the remembrance and mind of sin. The The vndersto^dy^ge also is
draw to for to se and behold what pain is ordained for sin / and than his
will is moved to hate sin. And though this be the first ascencyon / and the
first gaderynge together of the myghtes of the soul / yet must the soul
excersyce and use the same ascencyon and gaderynge together of the same myghtes
/ by the light of the inwardely understanding in the clear syghte of very
feythe / not only beholdynge ye pain for sin but also and rather the deed
of virtue / and the love that they should have to virtue / so that their
affeccyo^ may ascend up with the fete of love / put tynge away seruyle dread.
If they do thus / tha^ they be made my true servants / and not untrue /
serving me only for love / and not for dread. To this they may come / if
they myghtely orawe up by ye rote and put away with hate / the root of their
own propre love. And also if they be wise and pr^udent / styd fast / and
parseueraunt. But there be many such begynners / the which begin to asce^de
/ that be so dull and full of slothe / and so feyntly yel den to me my dewte /
and with such neclygence / and ygnoraunce / yt they feynt and defayle / anon
rennynge to the sail for the lest wind that comes. And so they gone
backewarde / for they did ascend vnparfytely / and took ye first gre of ye
bridge of my only fothefast sone / and most byloued Ihesu crucyfyed / and
therefore they may not come to ye second gre of the heart of love. How a man
yt has excersysed him in ye dread of seruage which is the state of
imparfeccyo^ / by which state is under sto^de ye first grees of ye foresaid
holy bridge / he may come so to the second gre / which is yt state of
parfeccyon. SOme there be that be become true servants / that be those
which seruen me trewly / without any seruyle dread or bondage / that serue^
not me for dread of pain / but for love / and with love. That manner of love by
the which men serue^ me for their own profit and advantage / and for love
and plesaunce that they find in me / is utterly vnparsyte / and that may well
be known in this wise. As soon as my comfortes be withdraw fro the^ / anon
they give of their love / and therefore it is vnparfyte. By such manner of love
imperfect / they loue^ their neighbors / and therefore such love is not
suffycyent nor durable / but rather such love cease and often times fails.
It cease anendes me / for this cause / often times I wtithdrawe fro them
ghostly co^fortes of ye soul / that they may the sooner arise from imparfeccyon
/ and be excersysed in virtues / suffrynge the^ to have tourment and heaviness
of heart / yt they may the more purely come to me. The which is done also
because they should the sooner come to the parfyte knowledge of themself / for
they know not themself / nor they have no grace of themself. And also yt in
time of trybulacyo^s they might learn for to run to me / yt am their refute
and comfort / knowing me to be to them gyuer of al goodness and graces / and
so to search me feythfully with very meekness / and for this cause / all such
trybulacyons to fall to the^ / withdrawynge fro the^ ghostly co^fortes / but
not my grace. All such manner of me^ go than full sloly with great vnpasyence
of soul. And otherwhyle they leave and forsake their ghostly excercyses in many
manners and diverse / and often times under color of virtue / they say within
themself thus. This ghostly excercyse and workynge is nothyge profitable to me
/ and that is when they find them and feel them faylynge and lacking of
inward ghostly comfort. Such one holds and keeps the condycyon of an
vnparfyte man / for he has not yet right well lift up and put away ye veyle
and the clothe of his ghostly love / fro the clear syghte of the eye of very
bryssed feythe. For if he had well lyfted it up / and put away that clothe /
in sothe he should severyly / yt all the try^bulacyons comen fro me to prove
him / for ye leest lefe of a tree may not fall down without my ordinance and
prouyde^ce. And therefore all that ever I granted to them by suffrau^ce of
such trybulacyons / I suffer it to come to them for their increase o^ virtue.
That is that they may have a good end / to the which end I have made the^.
This they should behold and se and verily know that I desire nothing of them
/ but virtue and good / in the precious blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu /
in ye which blood they be washed fro all their wyckednes in the same blood
they may know my very truth. For that I would give to them everlasting life
/ I made them to the image and symylytute of me / and have made them freslhe
and quycke to grace as children of grace / in ye blood of my only sone Ihesu.
But because they be imperfect / they do to me seruyse only for their own
profit / wtdrawynge the^ in ye same wise fro the parfyte love of their
neighbors. The first ^o fail for dread the which they have for suffcynge of
pain. The second withdrawynge of the^ fro ye profit / that they should show
and do to their neighbors / and so withdraw the^ fro charity / because they
parceyue in them that they be depryued / as they think fro ghostly comfort /
which they were used to have / and that is for their love is not parfyte. But
with ye same imparfeccyon that they love me only for their own profit / with
ye same imperfyte lour / they love their neighbors. And but if they did know
their own imparfeccyon by great desire of parfeccyon / they must needs go
back. Therefore it is right needful for them / if they will have yt durable
lasting love / for to love without beholdynge of any manner reward. It is not
enough for to fle syn^e for dread of pain / nor for to live virtuously only
for his synguler auau^tage and profit. For these be no great things for to
wyn^e thereby heaven bliss / but it is spedefull for to eschew sins only for
they dysplesen me / and only for my love for to love virtues and get them.
Nevertheless the fy^ste calling of euety creature (is that) for first a
soul is vnparfyte / rather tha^ parfyte / and fro imparfeccyon it should come
to parfeccyo^. Whyther every virtuous soul living in this life has always
loved me only with out beholdy^ge of any other thing / or if that it have in
the hour of departing fro the body in this life desired / if it had be time
or space to serve me better than ever she did / without beholdynge of any
other thing than of me alone / knowing than her own vnparfytenes or
imperfeccyon. Such souls I trow there be many / so living in vnparfyte
love. Of the which Peter was one / that loved my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
christ for his blessed bodyly conuersacyon in this life / but when time of
trybulacyo^ came he sailed in his love / and he fell in to such an
inconuenyente / that for very dread of pain he denied him and said yt he knew
him never. And therefore a soul that ascends upon these grees only with
seruyle dread and hired love / she falls in to great incomodytes and
inconuenyence. All they should therefore arise as very true children / serving
me wtoute any b^holdy^ge of their own profit / for I am ye rewarder of every
labor / and yield to every man after his estate and excersyce. And therefore
if they leave not the excersyce of good and holy prayers and of other good
works / but much rather encreasen in virtues with parseueraunce / than they
show come worthily to ye very love of my sothefaste sone Ihesu. And I shall
tha^ love the^ with such love / as I love my own very dear children / for with
such lour as I am loved / I shall love again. If I be loved with such love /
as a servant loves his lord / I as a lord as he has deserved / shall
reward him his dewte. But I shall not make myself open to him by my specyal
graces / for to a true friend and a true lover / my pryue secrets be made
open and showed / ye which is made one with me that am his friend.
Nevertheless a servant may encrees with ye virtues and love that he bears
to his lord / in somocbe yt he may be made a right dear friend. Right so it
happeth of such that love me as hired servants done to thyr lords / to
such I make me not open. But if such pull up by the root with a manner of
hate their own ghostly love fro themself / and asce^de up above ye sete of
their own conscience / not leuynge this seruyle dread and hired love
vnchastysed and vncorrecked with the light of very devout feythe / than may
they be to me tyghte kind and come to my very frendely love. And so shall I
than show me gracyously to them / as my own sothefaste sone Ihesu said when
he was conuersaunt i^ this world / he yt loves me (he say the) shall keep my
word / and my fader shall love him / and we shall come to him / and make a
dwelly^ge place in hy^. Also he says in an other place thus / he that loves
me / shall be loved of my fader / and I shall love him / and show him myself
gracyously. This is ye very knowledge of dear lovers / for in them love is
transformed in the lover / by affeccy on and love / and so there be two bodies
and one soul / if two have but one soul it may not be hyd fro that one / but
it is know also to that other. And therefore my sothefaste sone Ihesu said
thus / we should come and make together one dwelling place. Of the imparfeccyon
of them that loue^ and seruen god for their own profit and love / or for
their comfort. Daughter will thou know how I shall make myself open in a soul
that in truth loves me / showing the techy^ge and the doctrine of my
sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / here now in many manner wyses. I show my virtue
in such a soul / after the desire ye such a soul has. Nevertheless three
pry^cypal shewynges / I made to be had in a dear loving soul. The first is /
that I show the affection of my charity / by medyacyon and mean of the roorde
of my right well byloued sone Ihesu christ / the which affection is made open
in the blood of him shed out by the fervent fere of brennynge charity. In two
manner wyses this charity is showed / one is general comune to all / dwelling
and abiding in comune charity. To such it is showed the which do se and have
experyence of my charity / for many diverse benefytes that they have received of
me / and in diverse manners. The other manner of showing is partyculer to them
specially yt be made truly and feythefully my friends. The shewy^ge of this
comune charity that they do taste / they know they have experyence / and they
feel it parfytely in their souls. The second showing of charity is at ye
time that I do make me open to them (by affeccyo^ of love) not for I am a
special rewarder of one more than of an other / but making me freely open in
their souls / only by holy desire / in the same parfeccyon yt they seek.
Other while I make me open to them by another manner of wise / and this is the
manner of the other showing / gyuynge to them spyryte of prophecye / for to
know things that be to come / and that is in many wyses and diverse manners /
after the indygence and need that I aspy in such a soul / and other
creatures. Other while also in ye third wise / formynge in their souls / the
presence of my truth / yt is ye sothefastnes of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
in diverse wyses and many manners / as a soul desires the which has great
thruste or drynes. Other while they seek me in holy prayers / desiring for to
know my might / and than I do suffer them to taste the very virtue of my
might / other while I am sought in the wisdom of my sone / and than also I
fulfill their desire showing openly to the syghte of the eye of their
understanding / my sone Ihesu. Otherwhyle they do search me in the meekness
of the holy ghost / tha^ my endelesse goodness makes them to taste the
bre^nynge fire of my dyuyne charity / and also makes them to conceive very
ryall virtues / grounded i^ the pure charity of neyghbourhode.

The fyfte chapyter tells how god shows himself sometime to a soul that
loves him Also why christ said not. Ego manifestabo. etc. I shall show my
fader / but he said / I shall show myself what manner of governance a soul
shall keep / that she may come up to the second gree of ye holy bridge And of
other matters / as it is rehearsed before in the kale^der. Ca. v.
IN this wise than may ye clearly comprehend and parceyue the truth / after
the saying of my sothefast sone Ihesu / where he says thus / he that loves
me / he shall be one with me. For all ye show his doctrine / be made one with him
/ by the affeccyo^ of love. And like as ye be one in him / so be ye one i^ me /
for he and I be but one together in substance / and so show I me to you / for
we be all one. Nevertheless if my sothefaste sone had said to you thus / I
shall show you me the fader / he had said sothe / for if he show himself he
shows me / and if he show me he shows himself. But why said he not / I
shall show you my fader only? Truly for three manner causes. One is this /
because he would it were know that I am not departed fro him / nor he fro me /
and therefore it was yt he said to saint Phylyp / yt asked of him thus. Lord
show us thy fader / and it is enough to us? Phylyp he said / he that sees
me / sees my fader / this was truly said / for he was one with me / and that
he had he had only of me / and not I of him. And that was the cause that he
said to the Jews thus. My doctrine is not my doctrine / but his doctrine that
send me in to this world / that is my fader. Thus by this cause my right
sweet and only sothefast sone comes fro me / and not I fro him. And he he
says also we be all one / therefore it was that he said not / I shall not
show you my fader / but he said / I shall show you me / yt is because I am
one / and the same with my fader. The second cause was / in asmoche as he
showed you himself / he showed to you no other / than he had of me his fader
(as though he said thus) my fader has showed me himself / because we be
one. Therefore I shall show you my fader and me / by medyacyon of myself. The
third cause was / for I that am inuysyble / may not be seen of you that been
vysyble / but when ye be departed out fro your deedly bodies / tha^ all ye
shall se me face to face / and my sothefast sone Ihesu christ intellectually /
unto yt time of ye general resurreccyon. Therefore now as I am / ye may not se
me and for this cause I have hyd and covered my dyuyne nature / by the veyle of
your humanyte / yt ye might so se that is inuysyble as vysyble. As though I
give you dwelling among you my sothefaste sone Ihesu / covered in the veil
of your ma^hode. And so he shows me to you / and therefore he said not / I
shall show you my fader / but he said I shall show you me. As though he me^t
thus / like as my fader has given it to me / so shall I show me to you. Thus
thou may know that in this sheweynge of me / he showed himself. And thus
thou hase learned why he said not / I shall show you my fader (that is thus)
because it is impossible to you for you to se me in this deedly body (as it is
said before / and also because he is one with me. And here after shall be
showed what manner of governance a soul shall keep / and how she shall ascend
up to ye second gre of ye holy bridge. NOw thou knows in what manner of
excellence he dwells / that comes to the degree of the love of a friend /
such one goes upon his fete of affection / and so comes to the pryue
secrets of ye heart / that is fro the first grees / to the second be fygured
in the body of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu. I told the that those three
grees were betokened or marked in yt three myghtes of the soul / betokenynge
pryncypally / the three states of the soul. Now therefore or yt he come to the
third gree / I shall show the how he shall come to be a dear friend. And after
time he is come^ to be a dear friend to me / anon he is made a child of my
love that he has to me / and I to him / as to my own dear child. But first
how that he works wha^ he is made a friend / I shall tell it to the. At the
begynny^ge he was vnparfyte / by seruyle dread / and by the parseuerau^te use
of the same dread / he came to ye love of ghostly delectacyon / finding in me
comfort and advantage of his own profit. In sothe this is ye way / and this
way he must ge^ that will come parfytely to parfyte love of a dear child and
of a friend. Why is that love parfyte? Truly for he receives my heritage / in
the love of my sothefast sone Ihesu. And because ye love of adere sone is not
without the love of adere friend / and therefore I said to the / that of a dear
friend / comes a dear child. But what manner of governance must he hold /
that shall come to this parfeccyon / I shall tell ye? Every parfeccyon and
every virtue / comes out of charity / and charity is nouryshed of mekenes /
and meekness comes out of knowledge and of holy hate of himself / that is of
his own sensualyte and his very propre will. And for to come to this a man
must abide parseuerau^tly / and dwell in the Cell of his own knowledge. In
the which knowledge of himself / he shall find my mercy in the blood of my
sothefaste sone Ihesu drawing to him by holy desire my dyuyne charity / and
also by excersysynge himself in dystroye^ge al manner of wicked wylles both
spyrytuall and temporal / hydynge himself i^ his own house / as Peter and
other dyscyples did / the which Peter after the trespass of negacyon or
denyenge / the which he did to my sone / he wept full bytterly. Yet
nevertheless his we pynge was vnparfyte / and so it was unto ye asce^cyon. And
after time my sothefast sone came to me in his manhod / than Peter and all
other dyscyples did hyde the^ in an house / abydy^ge there mekely the comy^ge
of the holy ghost / as my sothefaste sone did promise before to them. And all
that time they for fere abode in an house reclused. For ever the soul dredeth
unto the time it come to the very love. But they were parseuerauntly abiding
in holy waking / and in meke and co^tynuall prayer / unto the time that the
holy ghost came and fulfilled them with plentuousnes of graces. And when they
were fulfilled with that great grace / than they cast away dredes / and so
they followed the steps of my sothefast sone / in prechy^ge his passyo^ over
all. In the same wise asoule that desires to come to this perfeccyo^ before
said / after time she has sinned deedly / and is gracyously arysen / knowing
herself foul and wretched / for dread of pain she begins for to weep. And
after that she aryseth fro ye dread and beholds my mercy where she fyndeth
delectacyon and profit / and yet it is vnparfyte. Therefore like as it was done
to Peter / and to the dyscyples that were closed in / so shall it be do to
such a devout soul that is risen out of sin and comes to my mercy. That
is to say / after forty days I shall make her to come to parfeccyon. That is
after these two states / otherwhyle I shall withdraw me fro such a soul not
by grace / but by feeling. And so showed well my sothefaste sone Ihesu / when
he said to his dyscyples thus. I shall go / and come to you. What that ever he
said partyculerly to his dyscyples / it was said generally and comynly to all
/ both to them that be now on live / and to the^ that be to come. Namely to
them that should come to him / he said thus. I shall go / and come again to
you / and so it was. For he came upon his dyscyples / when the holy ghost came
to them. The holy ghost came not alone / but with my might and power he came /
and with the wisdom of my sothefast sone Ihesu / the which is one with me.
And with the myldenes and mekenes of ye same holy ghost yt comes fro me and
fro my sone / in the same wise I say to the. When a soul ryseth fro her
imperfeccyo^ / I with draw me fro her by fely^ge / taky^ge away ye comfort
that she had. For when she was in deedly sin / she went away fro me / and I
did wtdrawe me tha^ from her sin / because than she had shyt against me the
gate of her desire / by the which the son of grace should go and shine
throw. This is no defaute of the son / but of the creature that shyt ye gate
of desire against the yt son and when she knows herself and her own
derkenesse / than she opens the wyndowes by holy confession / casting out
thereby the fylthe of syn^e. And tha^ I come again in to that soul by grace /
but yet I withdraw me fro her by fely^ge (as I said) and not fro grace. This
I do because she should wax low and meke / and that she should excersyce
herself / in seeking me truly. And also that she should be verily proved in
the holy light of feythe / so for to come to wisdom. Than if she verily /
without lokynge of any reward love me with the light of lyfely and quycke
feythe / and with holy hate of herself / she is joyful in the time of labor /
and demeth her (...) unworthy rest / and quietness of soul. This is ye
second thing of the three / of whom I told the before / for though she feel
me withdraw / she will not therefore go back ward / but rather she uses mekely
her ghostly labor / stondynge stydfastly and abiding enclosed in the house
of her own knowledge. And therefore she abides with a quycke feythe / the
comy^ge of the holy ghost (that is I my self) the which am ye fire of very
charity. How abides she? Truly not with ydlenes / but with bodyly waking / and
contynuall prayenge / and not only with bodyly waking / but with
intellectual waking. For yt eye of understanding or Intelleccyon is not
shytte but it is open and waketh with the light of feythe / dystryenge ye
thoughts of the heart with holy hate / waking in the affection of my charity
/ and knowing that I desire no thing else / but her holiness. And that is
well certyfyed and made ope^ynoughe / in ye blood of my sothefast sone Ihesu.
After time the eye of intelleccyon waketh thus in knowledge of her self and me
/ she prays co^tynually / offering to me prayer with a good will and an
holy. This is the contynuall prayer / and also she uses her in actual prayer
/ that is in such prayers as be ordained by holy church. Thus is a soul
occupied that is departed fro imparfeccyon / and is come to parfeccyon. And
because she should come thereto / therefore I went fro her / not put tynge away
grace fro her / but feeling. I withdraw me fro her / that she should know her
own defautes. And in that she knows herself pryued fro ghostly comfort /
she feleth pain and fyndeth herself feeble / not strong for to stand nor
stydfast. By that she fyndeth the rote of ghostly love in her own self and
therefore she fyndeth i^ them matter of knowledge / and in reysynge up herself
above herself / ascendynge upon the sete of her conscience / therefore to ly in
wait that such fely^ge is not suffered to pass without rebukynge of the
conscience / in dystryenge of the root of their own love with joyful hate
and with the love of virtue. How he that loves god vnparfytely / loves his
neighbor vnparfytely / and of ye tokens of his vnparfyte love. I will also yt
thou know / that all such imperfect love / and parfyte love is sought in me
/ by mean and medyacyon of creatures. They that be simple know this well that
louen oftetymes me and seken me i^ creatures. Nevertheless if a man receive
purely love of me / without beholdynge of any creature / tha^ doubteles he
should receive purely and drink the love of his neighbor / as a man drynketh
of a vessel / which is tylled in a well when it is draw out / and the lycour
is drunk that was therein / than is the vessel void. And if a man drink of
that vessel while it stondeth in the well / it is never idle nor void / but
ever full. Right so love of neighbors / both spyrytuall and temporal / will
be drunk in me without beholdynge and reward of any creatures. I ask not that
of you that ye love me with the same love that I loved you / for that may ye
not do / because I loved you / when I was not loved of you. All manner of love
yt ye have to me / (...) it to me of dewte / not of grace / because ye should
do it / but I love you of grace / and not of dewte. Therefore that love which I
ask of you ye may not yield it to me / and for yt cause I have put a mean
bytwyxe you and me (that is to say) your neighbor that ye do to him / that
ye may not do to me / and that is yt y^e love him of grace / without any
beholdynge / and without any abiding. For I hold it done to me that is done
to him for thy love / and this showed well my sothefast sone to saint Paul
when be parsued me saying thus. Saul Saul why parsues thou me. This he said
holdy^ge me parsued / in that he parsued my true servants. And therefore
such love would be pure / for like with the same love that ye should love me /
ye should love them. If you will know ye tokens of vnprofyte love / I shall
declare them to ye. If a man love an other ghostly and feel pain that
tourmenteth him / in asmoche as the creature that he loves is not seen to him
for to satysfy to his love / i^ louy^ge him again as he loves him / his
louy^ge is vnparfyte. Also if he se his conuersacyon be withdraw or pryued /
or desolate fro ghostly comfort / or if he se an other beloved more than he
himself. All these be takens and many mo / yt his love both in me and in his
neighbor is vnparfyte / and this is for to drink of the vessel without the
well. All be it he took the lycoure of love of me / yet his love was not
abydnge parfytely in me / as in the well of love. Therefore it shows tokens of
imparfeccyon in by / whom he loves ghostly. And all this may be the cause /
for ye rote of his own propre love / was never yet pulled up well. Therefore I
suffer love often times to be had / that he may know his own imparfeccyon /
by my wtdrawynge of feeling fro him / that he may shut him up and enclose
himself in ye house of his own knowledge. In ye which knowledge / he shall get
al manner of parfeccyon. And tha^ shall I enter with a great light / and with
very knowledge of my truth (insomoche) that he shall hold it for a synguler
grace / to mortyfy or sle (for my love) his propre will. And he shall cease
never to cut away the superfluytes of his vine / and to pull up ye thorns
of his thoughts / and build and edyfy very mighty stones of virtue / grounded
and set in yt blood of my sons passion / the which be found by going upon
the bridge of my only sone crucyfyed before said / and grounded upon the
doctrine of my truth in the virtue of his blood. For by virtues ye lyuen in the
strength of his passion.

And here now mdder and systren thus ends the second part of this orcharde
/ in ye which all we be showed ye very way to heaven / and in yt same book we
be showed how to cut of the supfluytes of our vynes / and how we shall pull up
the pryckynge thorns of our thoughts / with diverse matters / as it is
rehearsed in ye calendar before.

The fourth book.
The first chapter of the.iiii. party / speaks of prayer / and first in
what manner a soul shall govern her / yt she may come to pure love and
lyberall / and much of this.iiii. partel speaks of prayers and of teres.
But first god shows here a doctrine of the holy sacrament of crystes body.
And how a soul shall come fro vocal prayer / to mental prayer with other
matters as it is rehearsed to you in the calendar before. Ca. i.


AFter time a soul has entered and gone by ye doctrine of cristes passion /
crucyfyed with very love of virtue / and hate of vices / it stondeth with parfyte
parseueraunce / and namely such a soul that is parfytely come to the house of
his own knowledge / abiding myghtely and co^tynually in holy watch and prayer
/ drpted fully fro ye co^uersacyo^ of ye world. Wherefore has such a soul
closed her in ye house of her own knowledge? In certain for dread / knowing
her own imparfeccyon / and also for desire yt it has / for to come to a pure
and a lyberal love / and also because it sees well that it may come in no
otherwise thereto. Therefore with quycke feythe she abides ye comy^ge of me / by
increase of grace i^ herself But whereby shall a man know quycke feythe? Truly
by parseueraunce of virtue / and not going abacke for nothing that falls /
nor for to cease nor leave i^ dew time fro holy prayers / but if it be for
charity / or for obedyence (or else not) for often times by vnordynate time of
prayer / yt fend comes by many heuynesses and batayles / more than she were
found without prayer / and that he does for to dysceyue her / and for to make
her to leave holy prayers often times saying to her after this manner. This
prayer profyteth yt not / for thou should take heed to no thing else / nor
think nothing else but to that and of that thou sees / thus he says to
make thy prayer to be heavy to the / and for because thou should cease of the
excercyse of holy prayers / the which is an armure by the which a soul is
defended and kept from all her aduersytes with stretchynge forth of the
hand of love / and with the arm of fre choice / defendy^ge her self with the
same armure / and with the light of very feythe. God shows here a doctrine /
of the holy sacrament of the auter (that is to say) of the holy sacrament of
crystes body / and how a soul shall come fro vocal prayer / to mental prayer
/ and here is showed a vysyon / which this devout soul had on a time. THou
knows well dear daughter / that in meke contynuall prayer and feythfull with
parseueraunce / a soul wynneth all virtue / and therefore she should parseuer
and never leave it / another for yllusyo^ of ye fend / nor for their own
freylte yt is by thought or mouy^ge that comes i^ their own flesh / another
by speaking of no creature / for often times yt fend speaks by their tongues /
for to let devout prayers. Of all these dysceytes she should set no store /
but contynu in devout prayers / and ouerpasse such dysceytes / by virtue of
parseuerau^ce. O how sweet is it to such a soul and how plesaunte and liking
to me / holy prayer excersysed in the hose of her own knowledge / and also in
the knowledge of me / openy^ge the eye of understanding / with the light of
very feythe / and with the habu^daunte affection of my pure charity / ye which
charity is made to you vysyble of my vysyble only sothefaste sone Ihesu / when
he made it open in his blood / ye which blood makes a soul ghostly drunk /
and arayeth it ryally with the fire of dyuyne charity / and gives to her the
blyssed ghostly meet of the sacrament of ye auter / the which is kept for the
tresoure of our mother ye holy church / for to be mynystred to you by the
hondes of a priest my vyker / the which keeps the kaye of the same blessed
body flesh and blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu very god and very man.
This blessed ghostly mete is right comfortable to a devout receyuer after the
gretenesse of his desire in what wise that ever he receive it / whether it be
sacramentally or virtuously. He takes it sacramentally when he receives the
blessed host of the auter / and he receives it virtuously and ghostly yt
takes it by desire / hauy^ge mind of yt blessed blood which was shed for ye
rau^some of ma^ky^de. Such one is ghostly drunk with the mystery of that
sacrament / and also it is brenned and fulfilled with holy desire / with the
charity both of me and also of his neighbor. Where gets a soul this?
Truly f ye house of his own knowledge / and with right devout prayer / in the
which she has lost her imparfeccyon / like as the dyscyples and Peter lost
their imparfeyccyon abiding and stondynge wtinforthe in devout prayer and
holy waking and wanne the parfeccyo^. Wherewith trowes you? Truly with
parseuerau^ce knyte with holy feythe. Nevertheless understand not so / that a
soul wynneth only such brennynge of love by long vocal prayer / as many
souls vsen / whose prayer is rather in words than in affection / the which
setten their intent to nothing else / but to say many psalms and many pater
nosters / and when they have fulfilled ye nombre set / they thy^ke tha^ they
have done enough. It seems yt al such setten their intent and their
affection only in vocal prayer / and so should they not do / for if they do in
no other wise / they win full little fruit / and to me all sothe it is but
little worth. Now thou asks me paraue^ture and says / should therefore such
vocal prayer be left / sith it is so yt all be not able to me^tall prayer? To
this I answer and say nay / for I know well like as a soul is first
vnparfyte sooner than it be parfyte / likewise her prayer is first vnparfyte.
She should also eschew idleness / though she be parfyte and use vocal
prayers / that is wha^ she speaks or prays so / she should enforce her in
all her might for to reyse up herself ghostly into mental affection / with
general consyderacyon of her sins / in ye mind of my blessed sone Ihesu /
where is found largeness of my charity / and remyssyon of sins / and that
must be done in this wise / that as often as she consydereth herself both in
general and in comune wise her own defautes / so often she must iwardely know
my excellent goodness / and so proceed in ghostly excersyce with very meekness.
I will not yt she thy^ke upon her sins pertyculerly and specially / but
generally / lest ye soul be fyled by mind of such fylthy partyculer sins.
I said also ye I would yt she had another co^syderacyon of her sins in in
general / nor in special / without consyderacyon and mind of the blood shed
by my sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / and of my large mercy lest she fall into
dyspayre / for if ye knowledge of her and consyderacyo^ of her sysies were not
meddled with ye mind of the bitter passion of my sone Ihesu / and also of my
mercy / often times she should dwell still in that shame and confusyon / and so
to go to endeles dampnacyon with the same confusyon / and with that fend yt
has so lad her under the color of contrycyon / and very dysplesau^ce of her
sins. This is one of the most sotell dysceytes yt the wicked fend shows
to my servants / and therefore for your profit / and that ye might eschew
the dysceyte of the wicked fend / and that ye may be right plesaunte to me /
ye must always sprede out your hertes abroad to affection and besyre with
very meekness in to the sea of my great mighty mercy / for thou knows well
the pride of the fend may not suffer a meke soul / nor his confusyon and
shame may not suffer the bread and the largeness of my goodness and mercy /
wherein such a meke soul hops feythefully and truly / and therefore thou did
well / and as my will was that thou should do / wha^ thou did avoid the fro
that fend / which was about to throw yt down by confusyon and shame /
saying to the that thy living was nothing plesynge to me / yt nor thou
followed nor virtuous living (after my intent and after my will) the which
will is not hid fro him that desires to have it and live there after. And
because yt lift up thyselfe in to my mercy (and said thus) with meekness / I
knowledge to my maker / yt ever unto this time I have lived in derkenesse / and
so lad my life / but yet I shall hyde me in the sweet blessed wou^des of my
lord Ihesu / and wasshe me in his blood / and so shall I waste away my
wickedness / and joy i^ my maker / and than thou knows well the fend fled
fro the / nevertheless he came yet efte sons to the with an other sotel
temptacyon (that is) he was about to reyse the on high by pride (saying thus
to ye) behold thou art parfyte / and god is well plesed with the / now the
needs no more to wayle for thy sins. Tha^ by ye light of my grace / thou
went in the way of meekness / wha^ you an swered to yt fend thus. O what
wretch am I / saint John^ baptyst sinned never / and was hallowed in his moders
womb / and yet lived in right great penance / and I the most wretched of
all living / have done right great sins / and yet never began to know
with very contrycyon and waylynge what god is / whom I have so greatly
offended / and what I am / that have so grievously offended him. Than the fend
not suffcynge such meekness of the soul / and ye hope of my goodness /
said again to you thus. Cursed be you / for I may nothing avail in the / if I
do my great labor to throw ye adowne in to low things by confusyon and
shame / thou lyftes up thyself to mercy / and if I would enhaunce the to high
things by pride / thou descendes lowly by mekenes and parsnes me in to hell /
so yt I shall never tempte the more / for ever thou smytes me with the staff
of charity. In all such manners a soul should meddle the knowledge of herself /
with the knowledge of my mercy / and my knowledge with her knowledge. And after
such manner vocal prayer is profitable to a soul that uses it / and liking
to me / and fro such vnparfyte vocal prayer with excersyce and parseueraunce
/ she may come to parfyte mental prayer. Nevertheless if the intent be set
symply for to fulfill the nombre of the psalms / or pater nosters ytaxed / or
leuy^ge mental prayer for vocal prayer / I tell ye for truth such one shall
never come to mental prayer. Otherwhyse such a soul that when she should
pray and say her nombre of psalms or pater nosters / it is so unsavory that
her tongue is loathe and dull to say / and otherwhyle she has such a
conscye^ce of leuynge vnsayde the psalms and the pater nosters / wha^ I vyset
her sometime one wise / and sometime an other wise as sometime by ye light of my
knowledge with contrycyon of her sins / sometime by largeness of my right
great habundaunte charity / sometime by many manner wyses making open before
the clear light of her soul / as it is liking to me / the presence of my
very truth after the devout and holy desire of ye same foul / yet she will
not leave vnsayde the nombre of psalms or pater nosters / but much rather she
will leave my special vysytacyon that she feleth i^ her soul / and so she
should not do / for that is one of the dysceytes of ye fend. But anon as she
parceyueth her soul touched with my special vysytacyon / than she should leave
vocal prayer and turn thereto. And when that mental vysytacyon is withdraw
fro her / tha^ to turn again to vocal prayer (if she will) and make an end
of her psalms and pater nosters that she was in purpose for to say / and if
she have no time / she should not charge it nor be heavy therefore in her soul /
but if it be dyuyne service / to the which both prestes / clerks / and all
relygyous people be bound for to say / and if they say it not they offend /
for unto the end of their death they be bound there to / if they be in hele /
and if they were touched by special vysytacyon in dew times and hours when
they should say their dyuyne service / they should puruaye an other tym? (other
before or after) for to say their dyuyne service / so yt it be not left
vnsayde / yt should be said of dewte. Such vocal prayer said / as it is
before rehearsed / bry^geth a soul to parfeccyo^ / and therefore vocal prayer
should not be left / and than with excersyce and parseueraunce the sweetness of
prayer shall be tasted in truth / and also ye blessed ghostly meet of the body
of my sothefaste sone / as it is rehearsed. And therefore I told the yt some
receive christ's flesh and his blood virtuously / and some sacrame^tally
comunynge that blessed sacrament with affeccyo^ of charity / for he that gothe
to that sacrament with affcecyon / he fyndeth much sweetness / and he that
goes there to more of custom and use than for affection / he fyndeth little
sweetness / for he that enforces him with all his soul to make open his
affection in me / and knytteth it to me with ye very light of intelleccyon he
knows much / and he that knows much loves much / and he yt loves much
tastes me swetely. By this thou may know ye parfyte prayer is not gote^ with
many words / but with affection of desire (raised in me and of me) with
knowledge of himself and of me. And he that prays thus / he shall have both
mental prayer and vocal prayer / for they dwell together / like as actyue live
and contemplatyue done. By many manner of wyses / vocal and mental prayer ben
understood. For asmoche as I said to the and told the that holy desire is
contynuall prayer / that is for to have an holy desire and a devout will / the
which will and desire do arise actually in time and place ordained / with the
add^cyon of actu / all prayer. And so a soul shall use in time set and
ordained with an holy will vocal prayer / and never out of time ordained for
to use it namely contynually. Parauenture sometime it must be left for
mynystracyo^ of charity used to the health of neighbors / sometime for other
necessary and nedeful causes / as the state and business axeth / that I have
set a creature in. Every man should labor to ye health and necessytes of
souls / after the state that he is called to / for what that ever he labors
actually to ye ease and health of his neighbor / is for to pray virtuously.
For as saint Austyn says / he ceseth never to pray well / that ceseth never
to do well / and therefore it was yt I said / yt prayer is in many manners. For
actual prayer done / (as it is before said) is done by affection of charity /
for with ye affection of charity is co^tynual prayer. Thus I have told the /
how thou may come to mental prayer / that is by excersyce and parseueraunce
of vocal prayer / and how thou should leave vocal prayer for mental prayer
when I vysyte thy soul. I did say to the also what is comune prayer / for I
said it was prayer of good will / that is excersysed of charytable business /
both in the and in thy neighbor the which should be do with a good will.
Thus a soul should never be idle from prayer / but other actually or me^tally
she should pray / lest she fall in to duldesse of spyryte / and in to an
vnparfyte love / for ye more that she loves / the more she shall feel profit
and love both in me and in her neighbor. And here shall be showed of a
dysceyte that creatures have sometime / which loue^ god and serve him / for
their own comfort and delectacyon. Of the which imparfyte love somewhat shall
I tell the / and of a certain dysceyte yt is gotten of ye love / by ye which
they love for her own comfort. And therefore I will that you know that my
servant which loves me vnparfytely / rather he seeks after comfort / tha^
he loves me enterely (only for me) and by that thou may understood when
comfort fails ghostly or temporally / they be troubled in temporal
comfortes / to the which worldely men the which lyuen with some manner outewarde
deed of virtue / for to come to outewarde prosperyte / and when trybulacyon
comes the which I give them for ye profit of their souls / they be
troubled in that little good the which they have done / and if any man would
ask them why they be so troubled / they would answer because they be so
troubled in trybulacyons and an guysshes / and that little good which we have
done (as us seems) sto^deth to none advantage / for us seems we had more
rest of soul before with the good that we dyden than / than we have now /
such be dysceyued in their own delectacyon / and it is not sothe that
trybulacyon is cause / for they should love nevertheless / nor do ye less of
good works. For ye good works that they done in time of trybulacyon / it
shall avail them asmoche as they did defore in time of comfort / and yet it
shall avail the^ more / if they have pasye^ce / it fares by such as does by
a man yt laboreth in his gardayne or in his orcharde the which has delight
and is rested in soul with his la bour / because of his fair orcharde or
gardayne / and so it seems that he has more delight of his fair gardayne or
orcharde than of his labor / nevertheless if the gardayne or the orcharde
were take away fro him / he should soon feel his delight and delectacyon
withdraw. Why? Truly for his pryncypall delight was much more set upon ye
orcharde than upon his labor. But if his pryncypall delight were set rather
upon his labor tha^ upon his gardayne / than should he not lose ye love that
he had to his neighbor. In the same wise a man that does good actual deeds
outewarde / he may not lose the delight of excersyce i^ such workynge but if
he will / though the delight of prosperyte be withdraw / so that he set his
pryncypall intent upon the labor / and not upon ye prosperyte. The cause why
such be dysceyued i^ their own workynge / is their own passion / for often
times they breken out and thus they say / I know right well that I did better
and had more delight for to dwell and more comfort than I have now / because
I am more troubled now tha^ I was tha^ / and now I have no delight nor pleasure
to do good deeds / their saying is false and not true / for if ye good in it
self had delyted them only for ye virtue of that good / they should never
have lost it / nor it should neuet have failed in them / but much rather
encresed / but because ye workynge of their good deeds / was set only in her
own sentyble good / and therefore it failed / this is a dysceyte that comynly
the people receive / all such be dysceyued by their own synful delectacyon.
And now I shall show the here of the dysceyte that they have which set al
their affeccyons in comfortes and ghostly vysyo^s. ANd sometime of such
delectacyo^ he receives very much harm / for if his affection be set in
comfortes and ghosty vysyons / ye which many times and often I give to my
servants / when they be wtdrawe fro him / than he falls in to heaviness and
great bytternesse of soul / as often as I withdraw my comfortes fro his soul
/ so often him seems that I have forsake him / and therefore him seems that he
is in hell / wherefore he falls in to bytternesse / and in to many
temptacyons. He should not do so / nor suffer him so to be dysceyued / of his
own spyrytuall delectacyo^ / but he should lift up his eye to me / and know
me for very sovereign good / ye which receive and keep for him / good (...) me
of dyseases. He should (...) ^^^mselfe / and hold hym^^^^^ unworthy for to
have pease and (...) of soul / and that is the (...) propre cause why I
wtdrawe ^^^ ^rome him / that he should love ^^m and meke hy^ / and know that
my very charity and goodness (the which should be in him) for to be found
with good and parfyte will and never else / the which I conserve and keep in
his time of trybulacyo^. And also I withdraw me for this cause / that he should
not only receive of me the milk of my sweetness / but also that he should
apply him with all his might for to cleue to the breast of my sothefast sone
Ihesu christ / where he shall both seek and find milk and flesh together /
that is drawing to him the milk of my very charity / by mean or medyacyon of
the blessed body of my dear sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed. To them therefore that
gone so and seek my milk of sweetness / with prudence and not with ygnoraunce
of my sons bitter passion / to such I turn with a greter delight / and with
ghostly strength and also with light and brenny^ge fire of charity. And if it
so be yt they take such withdrawynge of ghostly sweetness dyscomfortably with
heaviness and confusyon of soul / they do not win no comfort thereby / but
much rather they should abide in their own dulnes. How all they that delight
them in such co^ fortes and vysyons may be dyscryued / and how that they may
receive a wicked spyryte under the form / or color of a good spyryte / and
also of tokens how it may be known when it comes of god / and when that it
comes of our enemy the devil. After this often times of the fend they
receive an other dysceyte that is when he transformeth him self in to the
likeness of light / for the fend there he fyndeth a man dysposed for to
receive ghostly comfortes / and thereto sets all his desire on such
comfortes and ghostly vysyons / whereon he should not set his desire nor trust
/ but only on very meekness / and think that he is unworthy for to receive
such ghostly comfortes / to such ye fend transfygureth himself / i^ to
light by many manner wyses / other while to the likeness of an angel / other
while in to the form of my sone crucyfyed / and other while in to lykenes of
some of my seyntes / and this he does because he would catch him with the
hoke of his own ghostly spyrytuall delectacyon / ye which has set all his
affeccyo^ and desire upon ghostly vysyons. If a soul rise not up anon with very
meekness / casting away fro her all such manner delight / she is anon take
by the deuylles hoke i^ to his hondes / and if she with very meekness despise
such delectacyon and with love betaketh her in to the affection of me / ye whi
am a lover and not ye gift / ye fend for his own pride / may not suffer yt
mekenes of such a soul. Now if thou will know a toke^ how they ben dysceytes
of the fend and not my reuelacyo^s / I shall tell ye. This is the token of such
a trasformacyon of light that vysyteth ye soul / be of the fend / anon the
soul in ye comy^ge of it loses her ghostly gladness / and is left nothing
but heaviness and derkenesse and sharp pryckynge in the soul / and if it is
verily vysyted of me that am sothefastnesse everlasting / the soul in ye
first apperynge receives an holy dread / and with the same dread she
receives ghostely gladness and sykernesse / with a manner of sweet prudence /
for she dredeth / and dredeth not / but in her own thought / she holds her
unworthy such vysytacyo^s / and says thus to me. Lord I am indynge and
much unworthy to receive such ghoostly vysytacyons / and sithe I am not
worthy / how may this be that I am thus vysyted / tha^ she tourneth her to me
/ considering the wonderful large bread of my charity / and sees inwardely
therein / that I consydre nothing her worthynes / of no merit yt she deserves
to hane such vysytacyo^ / but only my own dygnyte and worthynesse / by the
which I make able and worthy / whom it lyketh me to receive such vysytacyo^s
both of grace and of feeling / for I despise never that desire that calls to
me / and this is the cause that she receives such vysytacyons mekely saying
thus / behold the ha^demayde of god / in me be thy will done / and tha^ she
goes forth to prayer / ever right mekely holding herself indynge and much
unworthy such holy and ghoostly vysytacyons / only as I have said /
considering that it comes of me. This is a very token for to know whether
that a soul be vysyted of me / or of ye fend / for as I have said in the
first apperynge / they find a great dread / parceyuynge both in the mids
and in the end hongre of virtue. Also an other while a soul when that it is
blinded of the wicked fend / first it receives gladness and joy / and at
the last it is brought in to confusyon and derkenes of ye soul. Lo thus have
I showed the a token / for to know the dysceyte of the fend / yt if a soul
will be meke and go wisely / she may not be dysceyued / and if she will
algates go rather with vnparfyte love of her ghostly comfortes / than with the
perfeccyon of my love (as I have said / she must needs be dysceyued of the
fend.

This second chapter tells of them that will not help nor comfort their
neighbors in their need / because they would not be let nor leave their own
comfort / pease / nor rest. Also of the dysceyte the which gods servants
have / that loue^ god with such imperfect love before said / and other matters
as it is rehearsed before in the calendar. Ca. ii.
I Have told the of the dysceytes of them that will receive me and taste me i^
their souls / after their own manner and delectacyon / and nothing after my
will. Now shall I tell the of the second dysceyte of them / that al their
delectacyon is set for to receive ghostly comfortes / insomoche that often times
though they se their neighbor in great need spyrytually or te^porally /
right under the color of virtue they excuse them (and thus they say) if they
should tend to such outward business / they should lose rest and pease of
soul / and also leave their hours vnsayd in dew time / therefore they charge
not to help them / lest they lose their ghostly comfort / and offend me /
as they thy^ke they should do. All such be dysceyued of their ghostly
delectacyon of soul / and they offend me more in that they will not help
their neighbors i^ their necessytes / tha^ in leuy^ge of all their ghostly
co^fortes / for all manner ghostly excersyce / be it vocal or mental / was
ordained of me / which a soul should use for to come to parfeccyo^ / and to
the charity of his neighbor / and that the neighbor should be kept in
charity / so that a man offends me more / leuy^ge undone the charytable
mynystracyon of his neighbor in time of need / for his actual excersyce and
rest of soul / than for to leave such actual excersyce and rest of soul
for his neighbor / for he fyndeth me in the charity of his neighbor and in ye
love of him / and yt they be not charitably mynystred i^ time of their need /
in that they losen their charity / and when charity of neyghbourehode lacks /
my affection is lessed / my ghostli comfort is lessed (insomoche) that that
they would win / they lose / and that yt they would lose they win / that is
by mynystracyon to their neighbors / in time of need / leuy^ge therefore
ghostly comfortes / they receive and win both me and their neighbor / and
so in all times / they may because of their mynystracyon / taste the
sweetness of my charity / and if they do it not / they stonden in pain (as
thus) if they must needs do them some mynstracyon / other by very force / love
/ bodyly or ghostly infyrmyte / that they do suffer / it shall be done so
heuyly and with such pain of conscience and tedyousnesse of soul / that the
one uneath may suffer or bear ye other / and if any man ask them why / it is
so peynfull to them / that they should answer and say / that as them sementh
/ they lose thereby both pease and tranquylyte of soul / and many things that
they should do / they leave undo therefore / and so offend god. It is not so /
but because their inward sight is set upon their own delectacyon / therefore
they can not se nor dyscerne in truth where their offense is / for offense
stondeth not in leuynge of ghostly things / or excersyce of prayers in time of
need of their neighbors / but it stondeth wha^ they be had without charytable
mynystracyon of neyghbourhode / whom they should love for the love of me / and
in time of need for to serve them charitably. Thus you may se and know / how a
man is dysceyued only by his own ghostly delectacyon in himself. Of the
dysceyte which gods servants have and love god with such vnparfyte love /
as is beforesayde. ALso my servants often times be dysceyued / all such
namely that as yet be vnparfyte / by delectacyon / loving with affection of
love / against the ghostly comfort and delectacyon / ye which they find i^
me / for I am the rewarder of al goods yt be done little and much / after the
mesure of love of him yt receives good. Of this I give ghostly comfort / some
time in one wise / and sometime in an other wise in the time of prayer. This do
I not / for yt a soul should receive ghostly comfort vnwytty^gely (that is to
say) that she rather behold the gift of my ghostly comfort / granted to her
by my gracyous largeness (tha^ me) but that she inwardely behold rather the
affection of my endelesse charity / by the which affeccyo^ I give to her such
comfortes / if it so be that she be ygnoraunt and will receive her own
delectacyon without consyderacyo^ of the affection of me she is dysceyued / for
by her own ghostly comfort she is dysceyued / in asmoche as she delyteth
therein. As long as she is thus ygnoraunte / she goes after her own delight /
seeking of the holy ghost such ghostly comfortes after their own lust / as
though she would put a law to the holy ghost / for to give it to her as she
would / so should she not do / but much rather go myghtely forth by my sons
passion / and therefore to receive ghostly comfort / in such wise / in such a
place / and in such a time / as it pleases my goodness for to grant her /
and though I give it not / it is not done of hate / but of love / yt she
should seek me truly and verily / and not only for to love me of delight / but
rather with meekness she should receive my charity / than so to follow their
own delectacyo^ / if she do not thus but only go to ghostly delectacyon i^
her own manner and not after my manner / she shall receive an intolerable pain
and shame / in asmoche as she sees that obiecte or the cause of her delight is
withdrawn / the which obiecte or cause she set before ye cye of her
itelleccyo^. These be they that chosen ghostly comfort after their own manner
/ and would every day be fed withal in their souls for the sencyble
comfortes yt they synden therein. And they be sometime so ygnoraunt / that if I
byset them any other wise than so / they withstonde me in my vysytacyon and
will not receive it / only desiring i^ their own purpose for to have such
vysytacyons / as they feel sencyble comfortes. This is defaute of their own
passion and ghostly delectacyo^ where^^ such a soul is dysceyued. For it is
right impossible for her ever to stand in one manner of ghostly vysytacyon. She
may never stand only in one manner of delectacyon / for my goodness will
vylyte her in dyuets manners of vysytacyons. I give many diverse ghostly delytes
to a soul / that is knyt stydfastly in me / sometime she receives of me
delectacyon / of a manner of ghostly gladness / sometime such contrycyon and
dysplesaunce of her sins / that she seems that she is ghostly troubled in
herself / sometime I shall be in a soul and she shall not feel me / sometime I
shall show and form before her my sothefast sone in diverse mauers before the
eye of her understanding and yet shall he not be parceyued nor felt in the
feeling of ye soul in such fervor and delectacyon as he should be felt. All this I do for love / and for to keep her and encrees her in the virtue of
meekness and parseuerau^ce. And also for to enform her that she put no manner
of rule to me / nor for to set her end i^ such delectacyon / but only in
virtue that is grounded in me / and that with meekness she receive both times
that is of withdrawynge and gyuynge and that also she receive with her own
affection / the affection of me by the which affection I give her such
comfortes / and also that she believe and trust well with a quycke feythe / that
I give such things / wha^ I give it to ye need of her health that she might
come by such vysytacyons to great perfeccyon. Therefore I will that she sto^de
ever mekely / setty^ge ever both begynny^ge and her ending in the affection
of my very charity / and in ye charity for to receive only delectacyon / with
desire after my will / and not after her own will / all this have I said for
to eschew dysceytes. How a soul yt knows her self wisely in sothefastnes /
keeps herself fro all these foresaid dysceytes. FOrthermore I will not hyde
fro the the dysceyte that deedly me^ felen in their own sencyble delectacyo^ /
ye which done them but little good namely of those things that they work by
virtue in time of such sencyble comfortes. Ouermore of the ghostly sencyble
delectacyon of ghostly comfortes of my own servants / how that they with the
love of their own delectacyon dysceyuen themself / ye which delight will not
suffer them lor to know the very truth of me / nor ye sin that they
stonden in / nor the dysceyte the which the fend uses in them. All this I
tell the that thou and all my servants should follow and seek virtues in my
love. and after no other love. These dysceytes and perelles often times be
received namely of the^ / that be yet in vnparfyte love / that is only for to
love me because of my might / and not symply me that am the gyuer. But a soul
that in sothefastenesse has entered the house of her own knowledge / and
excersyseth parfyte prayer and ryseth up in such awyse / as I have told the
where I treted of prayer / for the imparfeccyon of their own love / and also
fro the imparfeccyon of prayer / she receives me by affection of love /
seeking besyly to draw o^ute ye milk of my breast / the sweetness of the
doctrine of my sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / after time she is come perfycely
to the third estate of a sone or of a friend. Than al such have no hired love
/ as servants under bondage / but they be as dear and elect friends having
the love of dear and blessed children / for right as one friend does to an
other / so done they with me / right as a friend gives a present to an other /
for ye eye is not set only upon the gift / but also it is set in the heart
and in the affection of the gyuer / and so he keeps ye gift byloue of
affeccyo^. Right so a soul that is come to the state of the third parfyte
love when she receives my gifts and my graces / she beholds not only my
gifts / but with the eye of Intelleccyon she beholds the affection of
charity of me that am the gyuer / and that a soul may not be excused / but
that she may do so / if she be mekely dysposed / I have puruayed before for to
knytte the gift with the gyuer / and that was when I granted my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu christ ye which is one with me and I with him for to
knytte and join together my dyuyne nature with the kind of manheed / and
therefore by this vnyeyo^ and oneheed ye must not behold my gift / but ye
behold the gyuer. Sees thou not now with how much affeccyo^ of love / ye
should love and desire the gift and the gyuer / if ye do thus / ye shall be in
right pure love / not in hired love / as they be that be ever locked up in the
house of their own propre delectacyo^. By what manner a soul comes fro
vnparfyte love / and comes to parfyte / fre^dely / and a lovely louy^ge love.
Hyderto I have showed yt in many manner wyses / how a soul ryseth fro
imparfeccyon / and attayneth to parfyte love / and what it does after time yt
is to come / to the love of fre^dely and lovely louy^ge love. That is how she
shut herself up / and closed her in the house of her own knowledge / ye which
knowledge of her self will be meddled with the knowledge of me / lest she fall
in to confusyon and shame by remembrance of her sins and also by knowledge of
herself / she may win sencyble hate of her own propre passions / and also
of ye delectacyons of her own ghostly comfortes / and so of hate grou^ ded in
meekness / she may win pasyence / in ye which pasyence she shall be made
strong and mighty / for to withstonde the fendes batayles and assaylynges /
and also against the parsute of me^ / and also against me / when I withdraw
fro her profit and good delectacyon of her own ghostly co^fortes. All these
she sufrreth with these virtues of pasyence / and if that her own sensualyte for
dyffyculte or hardenes will lift up his heed and arise up against reason /
than should the Judgment of ye conscience arise and ascend up above herself /
and give a ryghtwyse Judgment with holy hate against sensualyte / and suffer
not in any wise the styrrynges the which be of yt soul to pass / without
correccyon or examynacyo^ / not only those styrry^ges the which be against
reason / but also the styrrynges that come of my dyuyne charity. For a soul
that slondeth in holy hate / every day she correcketh and repreueth herself /
and foment my servant saint Gregory (when he said thus) it is ye co^dycyo^ of
good souls ever for to fere sin there no sin is / that he said of
cle^nesse and purete of conscience / so should a clean soul do / that will
arise fro imparfeccyon abiding in the house of her own knowledge and my
ordinance and prouydence with yt light of very seythe / as my dyscyples did /
which were dwelly^ge in an house / abiding therein with holy watch / meke
prayers / and co^tynuall parseueraunce / the sendy^ge down of the holy ghost
/ so must a soul do / that is in will for to arise fro imparfeccyo^ to
parfeccyon / that she be ever waking in the doctrine of my sothefast sone
Ihesu / with ye eye of understanding / co^tynuynge ever i^ devout prayer of
holy desire / and so shall she know the affection of my charity.

This third chapter tells of tokens / whereby it is known that a soul is
come to parfyte love. And how vnparfyte men will only follow ye fader / but
parfyte me^ follow the sone. Also god shows a vysyon / ye which this devout
maid had / in ye which vysyon is showed of diverse baptymes and of other
fair things and profitable. And of other matters / as it is rehearsed before in
the kalendre. Ca. iii.
Now shall I tell the how thou shall know when a soul is come to parfyte
love / and yt is by yt same token that was showed to the holy dyscyples after
the time they had recyued the holy ghost. The which went out of their hose
and preched the doctrine of my very sothefaste sone Ihesu / putting away fro
them fere and dread / nothing dredynge the death nor peynes / but rather were
joyful of peynes / they were not aferde for to go before tyrrauntes and wicked
Justices / and there to say before them the truth in glory and presynge of my
name. Right so should a soul do yt has well abyd in knowledge of herself /
as it is rehearsed before. To such a soul I shall come with fire of my charity
/ as long as she dwells and abides with parseueraunce in the house of love
(by affection) she conceyueth virtues / taking part of my might and power /
with ye which might and power / she receives such domynacyon / that she
ouered meth all her own propre sencyble passions virtuously / and in ye same
charity also she takes part of my sons wisdom / in the which wisdom she
sees and knows my very truth with the eye of Intelleccyon. And also she
sees thereby the dysceyte of ghostly sencyble love / yt is ye imperfyte love of
her own ghostly comfort / as I have told yt before. And also thereby she
knows and sees ye dysceyte and malice of ye fend / the which dysceyte he
gives to a soul bound in ye vnparfyte love / and therefore sithe a soul is
verily ryse^ with hate of ye same imparfeccyon / and love of imparfeccyon / in ye
same charity also she takes part / and makes strong her will by grace and
goodness of ye holy ghost / they be of will for to suffer pain for my love /
and to go out i^ my name of their house to inform their neighbors virtuously
in the knowing of truth. I say not that she should go out of ye house of
her own knowledge / but I say that those virtues should go out of ye house of
ye soul / ye which were conceived by affeccyo^ of her own comfort / and to
make the^ encrese and grow i^ time of need / to the health and sanacyon of her
neighbors / for ye dread is go ye let virtues for to be gracyously
conceived / and boldly for to sprede abroad (the which dread) would not suffer
virtues to abide for fere of losing her own ghoostly comfort / as I have
rehearsed before. But after time she is come to parfyte and lyberall love / she
gothe out (as I said before) leuynge and forsakynge her own ghostly sencyble
comfortes. And so this thing joins the^ with yt forth state / that is in
asmoche as a soul is risen fro ye third state / ye which is perfyte / in ye
which third state she has tasted / and put forth virtue for to encrese in
her neighbors / by the which virtue she receives an other / yt is ye last
state of parfyte vnycyon and oneheed in me / ye which two states be knytte
together / for yt one may not be without that other. For right as my charity
may not be wtoute charity of neyghbourheed / nor charity of neyghbourheed may
not be without my charity / ye one may not be departed fro that other. In the
same manner it fares of these two states / ye one may not be without that
other / likewise as I shall show the now suyngly. How imparfyte will only
follow the fader / but parfyte men follow ye sone. HEre I told yt how they have
gone out / ye which goy^ge I said is a token that they be risen fro
imparfeccyon / and come to parfeccyon. Open than the eye of thy understanding
/ and se them how they run by the bridge of the doctrine of my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / ye which was the very way / rule /
and doctrine / before the eye of her intelleccyon / for they put nothy^ge else
before their eyes / tha^ my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / they
put not me the fader before their eyes / as he does that abides and dwells
in vnparfyte love / the which will suffer no pain / and because there may no
pain fall in me / therefore such one will live with ghostly delectacyon that
he fyndeth in me without any pain / suynge me rather than my sothefast sone
Ihesu / for such cause it is yt he sueth me / and yet not me / but ghostly
delectacyon that he fyndeth in me. They that do love parfytely do not so / but
as ghostly dru^ken men they be gadered together / and ascend upon the three
grees or ladders the which I fygured to ye by three myghtes of the soul / and
also upon the three actual grees / ye which I fygured to the actually in the
body of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed. After ye time they be
thus ascended with the fete of affection of the soul / they come to the great
hole of the side of my sone / where they synde the pryue for cretes of the
heart / and know there ye water of baptym / ye which has virtue in the
blood of my sons passion / in the which blood a foul syndeth grace by holy
baptym / where yt the vessel of the soul is dysposed / and made ready for to
receive grace / also where she is oned in ye blessed blood of the la^be
receyuynge so holy baptym of yt blood virtuously. In ye which state she
knows verily and tastes ye brennynge sire of dyuyne charity / and so showed
well my sothefaste sone Ihesu to the / if thou have mind when he was asked of
the in this wise. O sweet and vndefouled lamb / wha^ thou was deed and thy
side was opened / why would you be smyt / and why wholde thou suffer thy heart
to be cut? He answered and said / if you remember yt many causes there were
why / but one pryncypall cause shall I tell the he said / for my desire as to
mankind was infynyte and endelesse / and the actual worky^ge for to suffer
pain and tourment / was fynyte and had an end. And therefore because my desire
and love to mankind was infynyte / I would that my pryuytes of my heart were
seen to mankind / opening to you for ye same cause my side / that ye might
look thereon and understand thereby that I loved mankind much more tha^ I
couthe or might show you of my pain fynyte / shedynge both blood and water.
And also there I showed in two manner of wyses baptym of blood. One was as I
said in them that be baptized in blood shed by martyrdom for me / the which
baptym has virtue of my blood namely for the^ that may not be baptized in the
holy baptym of water. Some also I said were and be baptized in fire /
desyry^ge baptym of water with all the affection of ye soul and may not have
it / al such be baptized in fire / and yet is it not this taptym of fire /
without blood / for blood is meddled with fire of dyuyne charity / because it
was shed out for love. In an otherwise also a soul receives this baptym
before said / the which dyuyne prouyde^ce charitably has ordained / for the
infyrmyte and freylte is known to him / by the which freylte man offe^deth /
not because he is constrained for to offend by freylte / but because as a
frail man he falls in to the trespass of deedly sin wylfully / whereby he
has lost grace yt he had won in yt bapty^ of blood by virtue. And therefore
it was right necessary that my dyuyne charity should puruaye a remedy for to
put away such grievous sins / ye which is co^tynall baptym of blood / yt a
soul wynneth by co^tynuall contrycyon of heart and with holy confession / when
it may be had of my mynysters / the which holden the keye of that blood / and
yt blood they pour down upon the face of ye soul in gyuynge of absolucyon.
And if confession may not be had / co^trycyon of heart suffyseth / for than yt
hand of myldnesse and meekness / largely gives to you the fruit of yt
blood. If that ye may have confession / I will that ye have it and use it / for
if there be any that may have it and will not / he shall be depryued fro yt
fruit of yt blood. Nevertheless sith it is i^ the last end of a man's
death if he will be confessed and may not / yet than my goodness shall also
receive him. Yet should not a man be such a fool / that will therefore under
such hope delay his confession / and abide unto the last end of his life /
for he is not syker whether to go for his obstynacy / I with my dyuyne
ryghtewysenesse will say to him thus. Thou did not think on me in the time of
thy life wha^ thou might / and therefore I shall not have mind of ye now in yt
end of thy death. And thus for this cause / there should none dyfferre and
delay his confession / and if he delay it by his own defaute / yet should he
not cease and abide in to ye last day / for to baptyse himself by hope in the
blood of hertely contynuall co^trycyon before said. Therefore it is called a
co^tynual baptyme / wherein a soul may baptyse herself ever and at all times
when she will unto the last day of departing fro the body / as I have said
before. Also thou knows therefore i^ this baptym that my workynge by passion of
my sons cross was fynyte / but the fruit of that pain ye which ye have
received of me / is infynyte / and that is in the virtue of my dyuyne nature
that is ifynyte / and oned with the nature of man / the which was fynyte and
had an end / the which nature of man suffered pain / arrayed and clothed in
your manhood / and therefore my workynge may well be said and called infynyte
/ not for cause the pain is infynyte / another the actual pain that I suffered
in my body / nor also the pain of my desire ye which I had for to fulfill and
complete your ransom / for that I fynyshed and ended in my cross / when ye
soul went out of yt body / but the fruit ye came out fro the pain / and of
the desire the which I suffered for your health is infynyte / and therefore
infynytely ye should receive the fruit thereof. For but yfthat fruit were not
infynyte / all man kind should never be restored / another they that be now
present / nor they that be passed / nor they that be to come. Nor also a man
that has offended / he should never have might nor power for to arise / if
this most blessed blood were not given to you infynytely. This showed I well
to you mopenyge of my side / where that I showed to you ye priuites of my heart
making so to be known to you / yt I love you more than I can show you with
this fynyte pain. Also I show to the infynyte love / with what thing trowes
thourtruly with haptym of blood oned and meddled with ye fere of my charity /
the which blood was gote^ out by love / and in general baptym also the which
is given to christian men / and to whom that yt will receive it is water meddled
with blood and fere where a soul tourneth her and wyndeth her in my blood / and
yt was ye cause why I would ye blood and water should re^ne out of my side. Now
have I answered to ye that thing / yt thou did ask me before. How a soul
when it is come up to yt third gree of yt bridge (yt is to say after the time
it is come to the mouth / anon it takes yt door of yt mouth / and when the
propre will of a man is deed / it is a very toke^ that it come thither. ALso
thou knows well all that I have told the now / my sothefast sone has cold
the before / yet nevertheless I have rehearsed the same to the again /
speky^gem his person / that thou might the better know the worthy excellence
in the which a soul is set in / that has ascended this second gree / where
she knows and seeks somoche fere of love / by ye which she comes to the
third gre (yt is to ye mouth) where is well showed yt she is come to the
stare of parfeccyon / coming thither by the mids of the heart / that is in
hauy^ge mind of ye blood in ye which she is baptized / leuy^ge vnparfyte love
/ by the knowledge yt she drew out of the hertely love seeing and tastynge and
feeling by experyence the bre^nynge fire of my charity / all such be come to
the very mouth / and therefore they excersyce and show openly the office of ye
mouth. For right as ye mouth speaks with the tongue yt is in the mouth /
and the taste tastes / the mouth receives and yeldeth yt is received to yt
stomach / yt tethe chewe and break that is received / for it may not else be
swalowed Right so a soul speaks with the tongue of his holy contynuall prayer /
such a tongue yeldeth to me both actually and me^tally / for belth of souls
right sweet ghostly desires and merry. Actually it speaks in showing /
admonyshynge / cou^seyly^ge / and knowlegy^ge the doctrine of my very truth /
without any fere of pain / what pain yt ever the world gives / but boldly
and hardyly before every creature she knowlegeth the truth before all
creatures / and to every creature after his estate i^ diverse wyses and manners.
Such a soul eteth the meet of ye health of souls / taking that same meet
upon the right blessed table of ye cross / for otherwise / nor upon no other
table she may in no wise parfytely ete it i^ truth / but it be up on ye table
of ye cross. Also I say yt such a soul eteth it and breketh it with her tethe /
for else she may never chewe yt same ghostli meet / yt is with holy hate and
love / the which two be two orders of tethe in yt mouth of holy desire / ye
which receives ghostly meet / brekynge and etynge it with hate of herself
and with love of virtue / dystryenge and brekynge both in herself and in her
neighbor almaner of miuryes and wrongs / that is derysyons / repreues /
refrenynges / with many other parsecucyo^s / suffrynge hongre and thruste /
cold and hete / heaviness and waylynges / defyres / wepynges and werynesse for
health of souls. All these she breketh and dystroyeth for the love of me /
supporting and susteynynge her neighbor charitably. And after time the meet
is thus broke and the taste has tasted it / that is that it have sauoure in
such ghostly laboute and love of such meet of souls / tastynge it in the
fere of my brennynge charity / and in the love of her neighbor / so that this
meet that comes in to the stomach / the which stomach is dysposed for to
receive such meet of desire and health that it had to souls / the which
stomach is nothing else / but an hertely will for to receive delectacy on and
love of charity with her neighbor / desiring and chewynge him in herself by
habundaunte charytable love. Such a soul gives no force of the tenderness
of the bodyly life / but rather set her with her might for to ete yt meet
before said received and taken upon the table of the cross of doctrine of my
only sothefaste sone Ihesucryst. Tha^ is such a soul made fat in very ryall
virtues / and somoche made fat of the abundaunce of that meet / yt the array
and clothy^ge of her own sensualyte that is of her body breketh of as ye
sencyble appetyte / and if it breketh it / it dies / for what yt ever it
breketh dies / and tha^ with that dies the sencyble will / that is because the
ordynate and well ruled will of the soul leueth arrayed and covered in me with a
parfyte and a very blessed endelesse will. And therefore the sencyble will is
deed / and all this does the parfyte soul that is come in truth and very
sothefastenesse to the third gree of the m^outhe. And the token that it is
come (is this) that she fyndeth her own sencyble will mortyfyed / wha^ she
tastes the affeccyo^ of my charity / and therefore she fyndeth in the mouth
of her soul peace / and such peace that there may none trouble her / because
she has forsaken her own se^cyble will. Al such bry^ge forth virtues
without pain upon their neighbors / not for the pain that they suffer is no
pain to other / but to a will mortyfyed it is no pain / for wylfully and
freely in my name and for my name she suffers pain / such people do run
without neclygence / by ye techynge and doctrine of my only sothefastesone
Thesu christ crucyfyed / and let not their sournaye for no wrongs that be done
to them / nor for no parsecucyon / nor for no delectacyon that the world
might give them / but all these they should lightly ouerpas by ghostly
strength and very parseueraunce / because their affection is verily ^^me out
of the affection of chary^e / tasly^ge yt meet of health of souls / with very
parfyte pasyence. The which pasyence is a to ten that a soul loves most
parfytely and without lokynge of any reward / for is she loved me and her
neyghboare for onye profit or reward / she were impatient / and she should
ware slow and dull in her iournaye / but that they love me for me / because I
am the most sovereign good and worthy to beloved / and also they love
themself for me / and their neighbor for me / that they sholden yield laud
and pre^synge to my name / and therefore they be pacyent and strong / and also
parseueraunte for to suffer. And now I shall declare to the of ye workynge of
the soul / after time it is ascended the third gre of that holy bridge. THese
ben the glorious virtues grounded i^ very tharyte ye which be abydy^ge in ye
heyghte of the tree of that same charity before said / that is pacyence /
stre^gthe / and parseueraunce / which be crowned with the light of blessed
feythe / with ye which light they run without derkenesse by the way of
truth / and also be enhaunsed by holy desire. And therefore there may no man
hurt^ that soul / nor the fend with all^is temptacyons / for he dredeth such
a soul that is brent in the furneys of charity / nor also backebyters nor
wrongs and miuryes of men / and yet though the world parsu her / he is
aferde of such a soul. Thus by my endelesse goodness / such a soul is made
strong and magnyfyed in the world before me / because of meekness in her
own sight / she is made little. This is well know in my seyntes which for my
love made them little by meekness i^ this world / and therefore I have made
the^ great i^ my endeles life above. And also i^ my mysteryal body of yt mother
of holy church / where of the^ is made co^tynuall memory. For i^ me which am
ye book of life / their names be wryte^ / also ye world has the^ in
reverence / because they dyspysen the world. All yt lyuen yet in earth of such
co^dicio^ hyde not virtue for dredt but for meekness / and if their neighbors
have need of their seruyse / they hyde not their mynystracyon for dread of
pain / nor for yt dread of loss of their own ghostly comfort. For in what
manner of wise they excercyse their life and their time for my worship / they be
glad and joyful and find peace and rest of soul. Which is that? In sothe
because they chosen not for to serve after their own manner / but after my
manner / and therefore they charge asmoche the time of ghostly comfort / as they
do ye time of trybulacyons and of prosperyte / as they do of aduersyte /
asmoche greueth the^ that one as that other / for ever in all things they
find my will / and they do besy them with all their desire for to comfort
them in all things / and over all both in thought and deed to seek and work
after my will. They se well and aspy in ye pryuyte of my dyuyne prouydence / yt
without me is made naught / that is to say sin / and therefore they hate
sin / wherefore they be so steadfast and strong in ghostly strength i^ their
own will / ye they go myghtely by ye way and in the way of truth and wax not
weary / but feythfully and truly they seruen and mynystre^ to their neighbors /
taking no head to ye ygnorau^ce and unkindness of their neighbors / nor
though a vycyous man say to the^ other while wrong / and repreue their good
deeds / but much rather they cry ghostly in my syghte / by holy prayer
prayenge for them / hauy^ge more pity and ruthe for ye offense yt is done to me
/ and for yt harm of their souls / th a^ for their own imuryes and wrongs /
al such do say with my chosen servant saint Paul. Daledicimus et
benedicimus. etc. we be cursed of men and said evil of / but we bless again
/ we suffer psecucyo^s / but we bear it pasyently / we be blasphemed / and we
beseech and pray / for we be made as or fail of all this world / ye which
is cast out thereof. Sees you not dear daughter and consyders you not these sweet
tokens / and specially above al to kens / ye synguler virtue of pacyence in the
which a soul shows well in sothefastnes / yt she is risen tro un parfyte
love and come in to perfyte love / following and suynge ye swear and vnde
fouled la^be my only sothefast sone Ihesu / ye which ha^gynge upon the cross
fast held with nails of love come not done fro yt cross for all the cryenge of
ye Jews / yt did cry to hy^ thus. Descendae nunc de cruce. c. Come he down
now fro ye cross and we shall believe in hy^. Nor also he wtdrewe hy^ not nor came
not down fro ye cross for no manner unkindness which was showed of you / but
abode under my ovedye^ce with such pasyence / and yt his cry was not herd / by
no manner grutchy^ ge. In ye same wise these welbyloued children / and my
devout seruau^te^ / se then and folowen ye doctrine and ensample of my
sothfast sone Ihesu. And though ye world would withdraw the^ for to look
back ward / they will not / but only look forward in the myrroure of my very
sothefastnes. such will not go out of ye field of battle for the coote that
is left at home / yt is for their own coote of plesaunce to creatures / and
them dredynge rather than me / but with love and delight in me they dwell still
abiding full ghostly drunk with the blood of my blessed sone Ihesu in the
field of battle / which blood my endeles charity has reserved and put it
before you to be your shield in battle / which is mynystred by the herdes of
holy church / for to be strenghe to them that will be ma^ly knights / and
fight against the fend and the world / and against their own sensualyte
and freylte of flesh / with the sword of hate of their ghostly enemies / and
with love of virtues / the which love is armure by whom they be defended and
kept fro strokes. For the enemies may not hurt none of my knights / but
when they deliver unto their hondes their swerdes and armure / and turn their
backs freely with ye hand of fre choice. My knights will not do so / but
rather they dure and parseuer myghtely to y^ death / for they be ghosty dru^ke
with ye precious blood before said / by ye which parseuerau^ce / al their
ghostly enemies be overcome. O glorious virtue of pasye^ce / how plesaunt and
liking art thou to me / for in the world thou puttes away ygnoraunce / and
gyues clear syghte to derke eyes / the which may not but algates they must
take part of the light of my servants. The meke nesse that my servants
have / shy neth to the souls health of them / in hate of their sins against
ye envy of them / the wydenesse and the bread of theyrgrere charity shyneth
against their cruelte / for they ben cruel against them / and my servants
do show pity agayneward against their wrongs shyneth yt queen of pasyc^ce /
the which has domynacyon and holds the pryncypall ladyshyp of all virtues
/ for it is the pythe and the marow of charity / she it is that shows and
keeps virtues in the soul and makes to be know whether those virtues be
grounded in me or not. She it is that ouercometh / and is never overcome / she
it is (as I have fayde) that is in felyshyppe with ghostly strength and
parseueraunce / she it is that comes home with vyctory / that is after time
she is gone out of yt field of battle / she comes home to me the everlasting
fader / there warder of all her labor / of whom she shall receive and take a
crown of endelesse loye. Of the state that is departed from the third / and
of workings of the soul which is come to this state / and how god goes
never away fro that soul by co^ tynuall feeling. Hyderto I have told the how
they show that they be come to parfyte frendely and lovely loving love. Now
will I tell ye in howmoche love my servants yt yet abide i^ the deedly body
taste me / for after time they ben come to the third state (in the same state
as I said) they win the fourth state. Not for it is depted fro ye third /
but they be together all one / for that one may not be without that other / like
as my charity and charity of neyghbourheed may not be departed / as I said to
the before. But there is a manner of fruit that comes out of this third gre /
of a cer tayne parfyte vnyo^ / which ye soul has in me / where she
receives stre^gthe above stre^gthe / in somoche that not only she bears
wrongs with pasyence / but also she desires with a longing desire for to
have strength to suffer injury and pain for the laud and Joy of my name /
with that longing pasyent desire / she receives i^ wardely ghostly loye in
the repreues and wrongs done to them for my sone Ihesu / as my glorious
precher saint Paul said. Libenter gloriabor. etc. That is to say / gladly and
joyfully I shall be merry in my infyrmytes / that the virtue of christ may dwell
i^ me / for I bear in my body the wounds of my lord Ihesu christ. In this
manner all such be so full of love and fro themself for the worship and ho
noure of my name / and so hongry upon the meet of souls health / that they
run to the mere table of my sons cross / and there desiring to suffer
much grievous pain thereby for to win and purchase virtues to edyfycacyon and
profit of their neighbors berynge contynually the blessed pryuytes of the
wou^des of my sone Ihesu christ in their bodies / that is the inwardely love yt
they have for health of their neighbors souls crucyfye^ge them so in their
bodies / and shewpnge by shy nynge to other / in somoche that they set right
naught by their own bo dies / but rather desire with great delight for to
suffer repreues / heaviness and peynes / recking never in what wise they be gyu^
to them / for health of their neighbors souls. To all such dear children /
pain is lust and delight / and all other lust and delight or comfort that the
world may give to the^ / is no joy to the^ / for though ye world would
favor them (that is) though servants of the world be coarte by
dyspensacyon and ordinance of my endelesse goodness for to have them in
reverence / and for to help them and releue them in their needs / yet they
have no joy therein / but only in me. Nor they set not their heart to receive
no manner of comfort another bodyly nor ghostly / but me alone / whiche^am
endeles comfort that never may fail. This comes of the virtue of very
mekenes / purchased and gotten of holy hate / ye which meekness is norysher of
charity / purchased and gotten of ye knowledge of herself and of me. Thus you
may se virtue shine i^ the gryuytes of crystes wounds / both in the bodies
and in the souls / of such chosen parfyte servants. To all such it is
proffered by grace me never to be departed from them by selynge / as I was and
am fro other / of the which I told the before / fro whom I went and came not
/ going fro the^ withdrawpnge grace and ghostly fely^ge. I do not so to these
yt be my most parfyte chyldret / ye which be come to great parfeccyon /
mortyfyed in all things to their own wylles / but co^tynually both by grace
and feeling I rest i^ their souls (that is) wha^ that ever they will have
themself in me by affection of love they may / and tha^ their desire is come
to such an union by affection of love / yt in no wise it may be departed fro
the^ / but every place is to the^ a place / and every time is to the^ a time of
prayer / for their co^uersacyon is lyfted up above ye earth and araysed up to
heaven (yt is to say) because they have wtdra we and put away fro the^ all
manner erthly affection / and also their own propre sency ble delectacyo^ /
they be risen above themself in to the heyght of heaven by the ladder of virtue
/ after time they have ascended the grees / ye which grees I lykened to the /
by ye body of my only lathefast son^ Ihesu christ. In yt first gree they have
spoiled ye fore of affection fro delectacyon of vices. In the second gree they
have tasted the secret affection of heart / whereby they have conceived delight
in virtue. In ye third gree / that is i^eas and tra^quyllyte of soul / they
have experyence in themself of perfyte virtue / and so they be arysen fro
vnparfyte love / and be come to right great parfeccyo^ / by ye which they
find rest in ye doctrine of my sothefastnes / so yt thereby they find better
you meet table and the meet / and also a servant for to serve them / which
meet they taste with yt mean and medyacyon of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
christ crucyfyed. I am to them both place and meet table / this swear and
delectable word (my own sothefast sone) is to them meet / for in that
glorious Ihesu / they taste meet which is health of souls / the which meet
is granted of me to you / both flesh and blood all hole very god and very
man / the which in sothe ye receive in the sacrament of the auter / granted
to you and given by my endeles goodness / as long as ye be wayegoers / or
pilgrims in the world / lest ye do fail and feynt in the way for fe
blenesse or wekenesse / and lest ye forgete the benefytes of that precious
blood shed out for you with somoche fervent and bre^nynge fire of love that
always ye may be made strong and mighty thereby / and be comforted and have
Joy in your iournaye The holy ghost is seruytour to luche and serves them at
ye meet of that blessed body / that is the affeccyo^ of my charity serves them
/ the which charity mynystreth to them both gifts and goodly graces. This
right sweet and well byloued seruytoure / bears / brings / and offreth to
me both their peynefull / and sweet / and also delectable desires / and than
fro me he brings to the^ for their labor and travail ye fruit of my dyuyne
charity / tastynge and noryshynge it in their souls by ye very sweetness of
my love. Thus thou may se and know yt to them I am a meet table / and my sone
is to them meet / and ye holp ghost is to them a seruytoure / the which comes
both fro me the fader / and also my sone. Thou knows also that ever they
taste me by feeling i^ their souls / and the more that they despise
delectacyon and do coueyte pain / the more they lose pain and win
delectacyo^. Why is that? In sothe because they be bre^ned and scorged in the
here of my charity / where is wasted up and co^sumpte the propre wylles of them
/ and therefore the fend dredeth greatly the state of their charity / and that
is ye cause that he goes ferfro them and dare not touch the^. The world
only smyteth them upon the bark of the body / wenynge thereby for to hurt
them / and he himself is hurt / for the arowe if yt it find no place where it
may enter / than it tourneth again to the shoter. Right so ye world shoteth
arowes of iniuryes parsecucyons and grutchynges to my servants / and they
find no place to them of enter / for the gardayne of their soul is close /
and therefore the arowe tourneth again to ye world that three we it by shotynge
enuenymed with the venym of sysse. Sees thou not how in no wise such a
seruau^te may have harm. Why is that? Truly if yt he hurt the body / he may
in no wise hurt the soul / for it sto^deth ever blessed and doleful / it
stondeth doleful for the offense of her neighbor / and it ston death blessed
by affection and vnyo^ of charity the which it has recey ued i^ herself /
these it be yt do follow the vndesouled lamb my only soth fast sone Ihesu /
ye which being upon the cross both blessed and doleful berynge the
tourment of ye body in suffrynge of pain / and also in be tynge of ye cross of
desire yt he might satysfy and make a seet or place above for the trespass of
mankind. and He was also blessed of dyuyne nature / the which so knytte with
mankind might in no wise suffer pain / and therefore be was both blessed and
dole full. In the same wise / these that be my dear and well byloued chyldred /
after time that they be come to the third and fourth state (before said)
they be doleful berynge the cross of crystes passion (both actually and
mentally) in suffrynge of peynes in their bodies / after ye suffraunce of me.
And also mentally tourmented by the cross of desire / for the offense that is
done to me and harm to their neyohbours. Also I say yt they be blessed for ye
love of charity that makes them blessed / may not be take fro them / by ye
which charity they take and receive both ghoostly gladness and blessydnes.
Therefore this sorrow and dolefulness is not called sorrow that tourmenteth the
soul / ye which sorrow shall sometime pass and defayle / but such sorrow
fatteth theo soul in affection of charity / for such peynes encrese^ virtues
and makes it strong / by ye which pain virtue is preued / therefore pain is
ye which makes fat / and not tourme^teth / for another pain nor sorrow may
draw such a soul out of the fire of charity / because they be all brenned in
the furneyse of my charity. Wherefore there may none take them our fro me /
for they be made one with me / and I with them. I never withdraw me fro them
by feeling / but that their souls sele me every day in themself by specyal
sencyble gra ces / fro other before I went and rame. I went fro the^ by
feeling / and not by grace / and that was because I would they should attain
to perfeccyon. And after time they be full come to parfeccyo^ as it may be
had in this world / I withdraw fro them the game of love in going and
coming / the which may well be called yt game of love / for by love I go fro
them / and by lone I come again to them (not proper ly I) for I am your lord
which is vumoueable / that am never moved fro place to place / but ye feeling
which my charity gives to a soul which goes and comes. Dow god goes not
away o fro ye forelayd partyre me^ by feeling / nor by grace ^^^ause of vuyon
bytwyxe them. Cell the yt to such parfyte folk it is granted never for to
lose me by ^^lynge / but yet in some wise I go fro them / for the soul which
is clo led in the body / is not suffycyent for to receive sne. I withdraw me
not as fro feeling / nor yet grace fro them / but my vnycyo^and oneheed / and
that is the cause why often times souls with longing desires / te^ne with
virtues by the bridge of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ cru cyfyed (that
is by his passyou / and after time they have so long ru^ne / theyt be come to
the great broad gate of the passion / where they drink and taste abu^dau^tly
the precious blood of my only sone Ihesu / till they be very ghostly drunk.
And after time they be so ghostly dru^ke with that blessed blood / and be
brenned i^ the fire of my love / anon they talt in me the endelesse godhecd /
the whi che is to them as a peaseable see (in ye which see) yt soul has
caughte such an union and oneheed / that such a soul has no manner mouynge
/ but in me. And though a man in such a state of vnycyon be deedly / yet he
tastes than the endclesse good of innrortalyte and vndeedlynesse. Whereby they
receive agy lyte and swetenes of body / not with stondynge the ponderosyte of
the body. By the which parfyre union often times the body is lysted fro ye
earth / and so the grievous and ponderous body is made light. This is the union
by the which the soul in me is more parfyte / than is ye union which is
between the body and the soul. Nevertheless yer is not therefore the ponderosyte
of ye body withdraw / though it other while by such vnycyon be lysted / but
it is the strength of the spyryte / ye whis the is oned in me that lyfteth up
yt ponderosyte of the body / and so ye body is all burnt by affeccyo^ of ye
soul (in somoche) that it were possible for to live / if my goodness
byclypped it not with a new strength. And therefore I will that thon know
that it is more miracle for to se / that a soul gothe not out of ye body in
this union and oneheed / than for to se many bodies arise fro death to life.
For this cause it is that I withdraw sometime yt vny on fro a soul / making
it turn again to the body / the which was alyened by affeccpo^ of yt same
soul For I will not that a soul should so depart fro the body / but only by
medyacyon of bodyly death. Neuexthelesse ur such rapt / the myghtes of the
soul and the affection of the soul oned in me passen out fro the body / for
the mind of the soul is not full (but with me) and the intelleccyon on of the
soul is lift up / be holding ye truth of my very sothefastnesse. The
affection that follows intelleccyon loves and oneth herself in that thing
the which yt eye of intelleccyon says. When all these myghtes of they soul
be gadered together / oned and drenched by love in me / the body loses his
feeling in me / for the eye seeing sees not / the ere herynge hereth not / the
tongue speky^ge speaks not / but as I suffer it sometime to speak / after the
abundaunce of the heart of such things that it feleth / for glory and laud
of my name / so though that it speak it speaks not / the hand also feeling
feleth not / nor the foot also going goes not. All these lymmes and felynges
of the body / ben bound and occupied by ye in ward sencyble feeling and bond
of love / by the which bond of love they be so bound and subject to reason
with affrccyon of the soul / that all they cry with one voice to me / endelesse
fader in will for to be departed yt body fro the soul / and the soul fro the
body / ye which is in manner against kind. And such a man so yllumy ned by
such special onynge / cries with saint Paul yt glorious apostle / where he
said thus. Oinfelix ego sum. etc. That is to say. O wretched man that I am /
who shall depart me fro the deedly body that I bear about / I se an other law
in my outewarde wits of the body / the which repugneth ye iwatde law of my
soul. Paul said not this only of the impugancyon the which ye sencyble
felynges did against ye spyryte / for he was in ma ner certyfyed of my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / and made syker thereof when he said to him thus. Paul
sufficit tibi gr^a mea. That is Paul hold yt well apaye / for my grace is
suffycye^t for to keep yt / but wherefore said he so than? Truly for the eye
was bound and might not se me end^ less trynyte / by the syghte and vysyon of
blyssed and un deedly spyrytes / ye which ever yelden to my name joy and
laud / and for because he found himself among deedly creatures that ever
and con tynually offenden me / departed fro my sight / that is not seeing me
verily in my propre essencyal being / therefore he said so / for cuery vysyon
and sight that a soul receives as derke in reward of that syghte ye which a
soul has when it is drpatted fro the body / and so it seemed to saint Paul /
that the feeling of the bodyly syghte impugneth ye vysyon and the light of the
soul (that is) that mannts feeling / or the ponderosyte of the body lets
the eye of mtelleceyon / the which suffers not it to se me face to face. It
seemed that his will was bound / that it might not love asmoche as it desired to
love / for cuery love in this life is vnparfyte / unto ye time that it come to
the parfeccyon that it loves. I say not this for the love of saint Paul /
and ye love of other of my dear servants yt they were vnparfyte to grace /
and to receive the parfeccyo^ of charity / for so they were parfyte / but thy
were vnpar fyte / because theyrloue was not co^plete / and therefore in manner
their love was peyneful / because it was not full / for if their desire had
be fulsylled (as they did love) it should have had no pain / but when yt
soul is departed fro the body / than their desire is fulfilled / and than it
loves without p^yne. Neuerthelesse^et than it has ho^gre and desire for to
love more / but pain is there none in that ho^gre and desire and all because
it is departed fro ye peynfull body. Than is the besfell full in me stabled and
made strong in me in truth / yt it may no thing desire but if it have it.
She desy reth for to se me / and she sees me face to face / she delyreth for
to seloy and praysynge or loving of my name in my seyntes / and she sees one
wise in the nature of angels / and an other wise in yt nature of man. How
worldely men yelden glory and worcester ship to god / whyther they will or will not.
ANd in somothe their sight is parfyte (yt not only they se my worship and
joy pmonge heunly creatures yt dwell in bliss without end) but also ymo^ge
deed ly creatures / for the world will he or not / he yeldeth praysynge and
loving to the name of god / and yet in sothe they yield me no such loving
and preysynge as a true lover does / that loves me above all things / but I
will put out and draw out fro them joy and pray sy^ge to my name / and that
is for asmoche as my joy shyneth in them / and also the abundaunce of my
charity / by the which I grasite thern to have time and le^gthe oflyfe / and
com maunde the earth that he swalowe them not for their defautes / but I abide
them mercyfully / and bydde the earth to give them of his fruit and the sone
to warm them and give the^ light and here / and the fyrmament yt he move and
stir / and all other creatures which I made for the^ / by my great mercy
and chary te I make the^ use the^ / not hynge of them withdrawynge for their
wyekednesse / but I grant it them (and as well to the^) as to theryghtwyse
lyuers / and often times more to sinners than to right wise men. Of ten times I
withdraw fro them abu^dau^ce of goods / ye which can suffer / and be able to
suffer that I might give them more abundasitly ye endeles goodness of heaven
for their pasyence / and thus my mercy and charity shyneth upon worldely me^.
Otherwhyle also in parsecueyo^s that servants of the world do to my
servants / for such parsecucy ons they be preued in pasyence and in charity
/ the which they offer to me with meke contynuall prayer in their parsecucyons
/ and so worship and praysynge is yield to my name. In this manner ye world
(will he or not) he yeldeth praysynge and glory to my name / though his intent
be not therefore / but rather for to do to mereprefe and shame. How that the
fendes do yield worship to god against their will. ALl those that dwell in the
world to the encrese of virtues in my servants by ye ctuell parsecucyo^s /
in manner they live and stand in hell as fendes do / for they be as the fendes
tourmentoures / fulfyllynge the will of fendes which be their may sters upon
my servants / and so they enerese the mede and merit of them / that be my
servants ledynge them against their will to the right way of heaven. They
encrese and exercise the^ in virtues / with many grievous temp tacyons and
heuynesses in many manners. Somryme they make one to do an other wrong / and
sometime to stir him for to take away his goods (and not only for the good)
but for to make them to lose charity wenynge that my servant will be out of
charpte / for loss of worldely goods. And in yt that they wene for to make
them for to lose charity / wenynge that my servant will be out of charity /
for loss of worldely goods / and in ye that they wene for to make them lose
charity / they be the more strengthed in charity / and preued in virtue of
pasyence / strength / and parseueraunce. In this wise they yield worship and
praysynge to my name / and so in the^ is fulfilled my truth yt I made them /
for yt worshy p an praysynge of me / and yt they should take perte of my
fayrenesse. But when ye fend rebelled to me by his pride / he fell adowne and
was departed and delivered fro my syghte. And therefore now because they may
not yield to me praysynge by by love of hery charity in themself. Cherfore I
send them as instru mentes of virtue to my servants / for to excercyse them
to virtue / and also for to punesshe all such endelesly / yt for their dedly
trespases be dampened I have made them to them as Iu^ tyces / and also for to
purge them yt gone adowne to purgatory. And thus thou may know and se it is
fothe that my truth is fulfilled in them / that is that they yield to me loye
and woe / ship / not as cytysyns of endelesse joy / fro the which loye for
their own defautes / they be tul ly and vtrerly departed / but as instrumentos
for virtues to my speeyall servants and as my Justices both to dampnable
souls / and also to those souls yt gone to pains o^purgato ry / to show to
the^ my right wysnes.

How a perfyte soul yt is passed fro this world / sees fully the glory and
the laud of the name of god ieuery creature. And how in ye soul is ended the
pain of desire / and not the delyre. Also how saint Paul after time that he
was take to se the glory of them that be in bliss / he coueted to be vnbou^de
and un losed from the body / and so done they which come to ye third and the
fourth foresaid state / and of other matters as it is showed before in the
calendar. Ca. iiii.
A what is he that sees and tastes verily / bow that all creatures reasonable
and unreasonable and also i^ fendes is seen ye presynge and louy^ge of my name
/ truly a soul that is departed fro ye body and is cme to me his endelesse
joy. Such a soul sees purely and knows the truth in her syghte / for by
the syghte that she has in me everlasting fader / she soueth / and by love
she is fulfilled / and by fulfyllynge she knows ye truth / and by knowing
of truth she is made stydfast i^ her will / stablyshed and knytte to yt mind
in such awyse yt she ma^e in no wise fussre pain / for she has yt ye which
she desired to have before (only for to seem) and ye joy and presynge of my
name / ye which joy and praysynge she sees in my seyntes verily and fully
and in other holy spyrytes / and in all other creatures and in fendes / as I
have said to the before. And though it so be that such a soul se offense
and trespass done to me / whereof before she was doleful and forowful / tha^ wha^
she is in joy than may she have no sorrow therefore / but only compassyon
without pain / louy^ge and prayenge for them that do trespass to me that I
should show them mercy by affection of charity. For all be it that pain is
ended in such a soul / charity is encresed. Right as my only sothefaste sone
I hesu ended pain of his peynful desire in his peynfull death upon ye cross /
which peynful desire he vare fro ye begy^ny^ge yt I send hy^ in ye world for
your health unto ye end of his bodyly life / and yet was not ended ye desire
of your health. Right so a blessed soul by departing fro ye body ends pain
/ but ye charpta ble desire of soul health ends never. For if yt my affection
of charity / ye which I showed to you by mean of him / had tha^ be ended
against you (ye should never be) in asmoche as ye be made of love / and if ye
love were withdraw fro me (yt I should not love) ye should never be / but my
love has made you / and my love has kept you and co^serued you And so my
only sothefaste sone ended i^ his passion pain of desire / but never love of
desire. Thus loserth a soul in bliss / yt every saint and every soul yt is
in bliss / is there without pain of desire of health of souls / for ye pain
ended in her departing fro ye body / but she is not there without affection of
charity. For wha^ such a soul departs fro the body / she passes out
ghostly drunk in ye blood of my only sothefast sone that vndefowled lamb /
and so bathed in his blood / and arrayed with the cote of chary te of neygh
bourheed / enters i^ me yt am ye pease able se. And than for ever such a
soul is departed fro mpatfeccyon / that is fro vnfulfyllyngenesse / and come
to parfeccyon fullylled with all good / ye which good she uses end lesly. And
here it shall be showed how that saint Paul after time he was assumpte and
take to ye gloty of them that be in bliss / he coueted to be unbound and
unloosed fro the body / and so do they the which be come to the third and ye
fourth state before said. O Hat lame good Paul sauoured and tasted / when I
rauyshed him to the third heaven that is to the heyghte of the trynyte by the
which tastynge he knew the sothefastnesse thereof / where he received fully my
spyryte / and learned verily and truly the doctrine of my only sothefalt sone
IIhesu christ crucyfyed / and ye soul of him was oned by right that time to me
the fader by selynge / and arrayed with the shynynge clerenesse or the blessed
endeles life / save that his soul was not departed fro the vody / but only by
feeling and vnycyon. It plesed and lyked me tyght well / for to take up and
rauysshe such a chosen vessel / because he should behold and se in to the
depenesse of my end less trynyte / there for to learn to suffer for my name
by inspeccyo^ of my only fothefaste sone Thesu christ crucysyed / the which
suffered right sharp flagellacyo^s with many byt ter peynes for the salvation
of man kind / by the which bitter passion he was learned and taught for to say
as he said / when ye he said thus. Lord what will thou yt I shall do / tell
me what I shall do / and that tyght gladly will I do. Than I taught him when I
put before the eye of his intelleccyon / the passy on of my sothefast sone
Ihesu christ / endowynge him with the doctrine of my truth and yllumynynge hy^
with the light of very knowledge / by the which very knowledge / he amended him
of his living / and so grounded in very charity / aryde him with the very
doctrine of my sons passion / and that doctrine of the passyo^ he kept so
truly / that as he said himself it went never fro his back / another by
temptacyon of fendes / nor by pryckynge of his flesh / ye which often times
ipugned him / the whthe I suffered him to have for my goodness / that he should
encrese in grace / in mede / and also in meekness. This clothe of crystes
passion after the time that Paul had tasted the very depenenesse of the holy
trynyte / might never be take from him / another by temptacyons nor
trybuiacyo^s / but he kepteit so streyte to him / that he did lose his bodyly
life therefore. In this wise the holy doctoure saint Paul knew the experyence
what it was for to taste me without greuaunce of the body / not by separacyon
fro ye body / but by feeling of oncheed. Therefore wha^ he was come to himself
so arrayed with the clothe of crystes passyo^ / him seemed that his love was
inparfyte / considering the inparfeccyon of love / the which he tasted in me
above (and light) ye which love seyntes departed fro ye body / did taste
euerlasty^gely. Wherefore hy^ seemed that ye ponderosyte of ye body rebelled
against him / and let the great parfeccyon of endelesse plentuous desire or
love / the which after departing fro the body a chosen soul feleth and
tastes. His mind also was as him thought vnparfyte and feeble the which
inparfeecyon and feeble the which inparfeccyon and feblenesse let him for to
have fresshe remembrance of that he had tasted before in truth with
parfeccyon / as seyntes receyuen of me in heaven. So that al things as him
seemed as long as he abode in ye body / were to him a contrary law / the
which inpugned and rebelled against the lpyryte. Not only by inpugnacyon of
sytme / for as I have said to the / I made him syket that he should not fall /
except ye he would wylfully work against grace / for I said to hy^ thus /
Paul my grace is suffycyent to the / for to keep the from falling (if thou
will) bucdy such inpugnacyon / yt is lettynge parfeccyon of the spyryte to se
me / in my own effencyall being / the which syghte was let by grievous
ponderosyte and contrary law of the body / and therefore he gemented / and with
great wemytacyon he cried thus. Infelix ego homo. etc. That is to say. O
wretched man that I am / who shall depart me fro this deedly body / the which
I bear about. I se an other law in the outewarde feeling of my body / the
which repugneth the inward law of my soul / and ledeth me in to the law of
sin / ye which law is belefte in my bodyly sencyble wits. And thus in
sothe it is / that the mind is inpugnynge of the inparfeccyon of the body. The
intelleccyon is also let and bound of the grievous po^derosyte of ye body /
because it may not se me i^ my effncyall bynge as I am. And the will is also
bound / because it may attain not for to taste me endelesse good with the
grievous heaviness of the body / but with great pain / as I have told the
before. And so saint Paul said truth / when he said thus / Ileus my bodyly
lymmes a strange law repugnynge the inward telynge of the soul. Thus in ye
same wise all my special servants the which be come to the third and to
the fourth state or gree of parfyte union / all they do say as saint Paul
said / and desire for to be departed fro ye body. And here after it shall be
showed to you / for what causes yt a soul desires to be losed fro the body /
and though it be not as he desires / it co^traryeth not ye will of god / but
rather it gives worship / and lauds / with presynges to god. ALl such do
give no charge to be departed fro the body / for they desyren it. And with
parfyte hate they have made war with all their bodies / i^ asmoche as they
have forsake yt tenderness which naturally is bytwyxe the soul and the body.
This kyndely love is throw away fro them / by holy hate of ye bodyly life /
and for my love they desyredethe / and thus they say with saint Paul. O upio
dissolui. etc. ye is to say / I desire to be departed fro the body and be with
christ / and also they be like to saint Paul and say as he said thus. Dors in
desiderio. etc. That is to say / death is to me in desire / and life in
pasye^ce / for the soul lift up in this parfyte union desires to se me / and
also to se joy and praysynge to be yelden to me / that is after time it has
ones belyft up and is come down again to the cloud of the body in feeling of
bodyly wits / the which sencybylyte was rapte by affeccyo^ of love to me /
all the bodyly felynges were draw out by strength of affection of the souls
unity / and annexed parfytely to me / by such vnycyo^ as is between a well
dysposed body and soul / the which vnycyon because the body is not suffycye^t
for to bear it / therefore I draw it out of the body by affeccyo^ of love to
me. And therefore it is that often times I with draw me fro such vnyo^ that is
in the body and soul / not by grace but by feeling / as I have made mency on
in the third and in ye fourth state or gree before. But yet nevertheless I
come again to ye souls health with encrese of more greter graces and more
parfyte union and with more depenesse and knowledge of my very truth showing
myself more openly to them. And when that I go as I said before / by the
which going the soul is come to the bodyly feeling / she waxes vnpacyente
for to live i^ earth. In asmoche as she consydereth that she is come fro the
conuersacyon of vndeedly souls in bliss and comen down to co^uersacyon of
deedly creatures / by whom she sees I am right wretchedly offended. This
tourmenteth her desire / for this cause she desires to be with me / and se me
with our cesy^ge. Nevertheless because her will which is not her will (but only
my will) made by love one with me / may nothing will nor desire / but that yt I
will / therefore though they cover for to come / they hold the^ apayde for to
abide (if I will yt they abide) though it be to theyur pain / for more joy
and presynge of my name / and also for more encrese of merit and mede of their
souls. And therefore though they have not their desires / yet they leave never
rennynge with lo^gynge desire / holding them fast by yt bridge of my sons
passion / and so be glad and joyful of repreues and iniuryes done to them for
my name. The more pain they suffer / ye more they joy / the most
refresshynge that they have / is their desire to be departed fro the body. For
right often times for desire and will to fuffre peynes / the pain is mynyshed
and made less that they have / for to be delyurred fro the body. These only
do not suffer with pasyence (as it is rehearse before in ye third state) but
they be glad and joyful to suffer many trybulacyons for my name. in their
suffraunce they be glad (and if they suffer not) they be fory and full of
pain dredynge that I will reward their good deeds in this life or that the
sacryfyce of their desire lyketh me not / and if it so be yt they suffer any
pain they be right joyful and glad / because they be arrayed and clothed with
the clothing and arayme^t of my only sothfast sons passion / without which
passion / or other manner of labors or veracyons if it were possible for them
by grace for to win veriues / they would not have them / but if it come by
labor / if they might chose with out dysplesaunce of me. For they had lever
win heaven bliss by delectacyon in peynes of crystes passion / or by other
manner vexacyons given to them by the suffraunce of me (than other wise) Why is
yt? Certain for they be drenched in the blood of my sons passion / where in
they synde my brennynge charity / ye which charity is fire comy^ge out fro me
/ yt rauysheth both their minds and their hertes / by ye which charity I
accept and take ye holy sacryfyce of their desires / by ye which charity also
they lyften up the eye of their understanding seeing and beholdynge in my good
heed / where their affection is nory shed / ye which affeccyo^ oneth him self
to the same charity and follows understanding. This is one of the vysyo^s and
syghtes the which I make in such a soul by infusyo^ of grace / the which
loves me verily and serves me. How they the which be come to yt foresaid
state of vnyo^ be yllumyned and lyghtned in their eye of Intelleccyo^ by grace
with a light above nature / and how it is better to go for to have counseyle
for the souls health to a meke man with an holy conscience / than to a proud
lettered man. By this same light which is put in the eye of intelleccyon of
such a soul / that ever slepynge and waky^ge desires me / is purchased and
get of very understanding of much cu^nynge. Saint Auslyn / saint Ierom / and
other doctors and seyntes illumyned and lyghtned of my very sothefastnes /
toke^ head and knew verily my truth that is of holy writ / ye which seemed
derke / because it was not understand / that was not for defaute of scripture
/ but of ye vndersto^ders ye which understood it not. And therefore I send
these lau^ternes before said / for to yllumyne the^ that were blind by
understanding / and for to open their eyes to know in derkenesse the truth.
For I ye receyuer of their sacryfyce / rauyshed them and gave them light not of
nature / but above all nature / and so in derkenesse they did receive light /
in such awyse knowing ye truth. Wherefore those things that did seem sometime
derke / it apperetd and shows to rude and boystous folk of what condycyo^
they be / eueryone for to receive after ye he dysposeth him to know me /
which dysposycyons I refuse not. Thus you may se yt the eye of intelleccyon
receives light in feeling by grace above nature / in the which light
doctors and other seyntes did know light in derkenesse / and of derkenes they
did make light by the same grace. For intelleccyo^ was rather made than
scripture / wherefore cunning comes of intelleccyon. In this wise holy faders
and propheres did know and had understanding / ye which did prophecy both
of the coming and also of the death of my only sothefast sone Ihesu. And in
the same wise the apostles did / after the coming of the holy ghost by ye same
light above nature / were yllumyned the euangelystes / martyrs / confessors /
and vyrgynes / and all these were illumyned of this parfyte light. And each of
them had in diverse manners after the need of their health / and after ye need of
creatures. Some did declare holy writ by the same light above nature (as
docters did) some preched as ye apostles did / some did expou^de the gospels of
the euangelystes / and some did shede blood for declaracyon of the truth (as
martyrs) and some did declare the truth by purete and affection of charity /
as vyrgyns did. Some declared ye truth ofobedyence of my only sothefast sone
Ihesu / in that that they do obey in their relygyo^ showing in their living
parfeccyon of obedyence / the which appeared shynyngely in my sone Ihesu christ
/ when by virtue of that obedyence which I put to him / he ran myghtely to ye
cruel death of the cross. All this was done / and is by this light above
nature in the new law / and that may thou well know by the exposycyons and
prechynges of the gospel / how in diverse wyses it is declared to christen men.
In ye old law also how holy faders and prophets did prophecy by the same
light above nature. And therefore because the new law is expouned and declared
/ and the old law prophesied by a light / the new law breketh not nor
loses not the old law / but both be knytte together. And the new law has
take away fro the imparfeccyon of ye old law / for that law was and is
grounded in dread. But when my only sothefast sone Ihesu came in to the world
with the law of love / he fulfilled it gyuynge to it love / remouynge away
dread of pain / and leuynge it full with holy dread? Therefore it was that my
only sone said to his dyscyples thus. No^ venisoluerelegem. etc. I come not
for to break the law / but for to fulfill ye law / as though he said to
them thus. The law is no we inperfyte / but with my blood I shall make it
parfyte / and so I shall fulfill in it ye fails / with drawing and remouynge
dread of pain / and grou^dynge it in love and holy dread. Thus than after the
fulfyllynge of the law by love and holy dread / al ye truth that comes out
of holy writ / comes by this light above nature before said. And therefore
vncunnynge proud clerks / be blinded in that light for pride / and the
cloud of their own love covers and takes away that light fro the^.
Wherefore they understand rather holy writ after the letter / or after their
own feeling / than after the very understanding / and so by tastynge only of
the lettre / they make many books / but they taste not the pythe / and yt mary
of yt same lettre. For they lack the light that I spoke of by the which is
declared all holy writ. Wherefore they wondre and fall in grutchynge for to se
so many rude folk and ydyotes of holy writ as themsemen. And yet neuerthe
lisse they be so yllumyned and light ned by ye light above nature i^ know lege
of the truth / as if they had studied long time therm. This is no wondre /
for they have the pryn cypall cause of the same lyghee / the which is mekenes
/ by the which comes all manner of ^u^ny^ge. But because they have lost that
light ^ the cause of the winning thereof / they se not nor know not my
endelesse goodness in yt light / which is gracyously tecte out or cast out
upon my scruauntes. And therefore I say to the / better it is for the to ask
counsel of soul health to one that is meke and has an holy right co^sye^ce
/ tha^ a proud lettered clerk the which has long studied in holy write /
for he gives nothing else but such as he has within him / the which often
times given derke counsel / after their derkelyuynge. The contrary is had
in many servants / for the light that they have within them / they give it
with desire of health to man's loule. Lo right sweet daughter all this have I
told the / that thou might know yt parfeccyo^ of yt state of union / where
the eye of intelleccyon is rapte by yt fire of my endelesse charity / in the
which charity is received light above nature / with which light I am loved
/ for love ren^eth after understanding. And the more a soul knows / the
more it loves / and the more it loves the more it knows / yt one norysheth
yt other. With yt light / souls come to the endelesse gloryfyed syghte of me
/ where they se me and in truth taste me. When they be departed fro the bodies
/ as I told the wha^ I declared to the of the blessydnesse that a soul
receives i^ me. This is that excellent state the which yet a deedly man
living ymonge deedly creatures may taste / by the which often times he comes
to such union / yt uneath he knows whether he be in his body or out of his
body / and so he tastes the ernest of everlasting life. That might he not do
/ but if his will were morty fyed and sleyne before / by the which ghostly
death / he is made one with me / for else myghthe parfytely feel that blessed
ernest / but if he were depryued from his propre will / the which will does
let him for to receive such a blessed and holy ernest. Here is a profitable
reperycyon of many things which be said / and how god induces this devout
soul to pray for every creature / and for all holy church. NOw hase thou
seen with the eyes of thy intelleccyon / and herd with thy sencyble ere of me
endelesse truth how thou may behave ye for to do both profit to ye and to
thy neighbor / by the doctrine and very knowledge of my sothefastnes (as I have
told the in ye beginning) where I said to the that thou may come to the
knowledge of of my truth / by knowledge of thyselfe oned and meddled with the
knowledge of me / where you may find meekness / holy hate / dysplesaunce of
thy self / and fervent fere of my endelesse charity / by the which thou
ought to come to the love of thy neighbor / showing to hy^ both profit by
bodyly mynystracyon / and also profit of doctrine and holy living. I showed
the also a bridge as it stondeth / and also I showed the the grees general put
for three myghtes of the soul / and how there may none have light of grace / but
if he ascend upon all three grees. That is that they be gadered together in my
name. And also I declared to the the same three grees partyculerly / for ye
states of ye soul fygured in ye body of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ /
which has made ladders for to ascend upon / showing in his fete that were
nay led a ladder to ascend up by the opening of his side / the which is the
second ladder for to ascend up by to his mouth / where a soul tastes peace
and rest in a manner beforesayde. I showed the also inparfeccyo^ of seruyle
dread / and i^parfeccyo^ of such lovers that love me vnparfytely / for
swetenes that they find in that love. And also parfeccyon of the third state
of them the which become to peace and rest of ye mouth / by the rennynge upon
the bridge of my sons passion with longing desire / first ascendynge up upon
the three general grees / that is to gader all ye three myghtes of ye soul /
where they gader together all their virtues workynge in my name / and also of
other three grees partyculers the which they ascede after time they be passed
out of the inparsyte state / and thus in sothe thou hase seen the^ run / and
also I have made the to taste parfeccyon of soul with arayme^tes of virtue. And
also to know dysceytes / the which a soul first tastes or that it come to
parfeccyon. I have also declared to the yt wretchydnes of them that gone and
drenchen them in the floode / not keeping the^ by the bridge of my sothefastnes
/ which I put because they should not peryshe. Yet as fools they had lever be
drenched in wretchydnes and fylthe of this world. Also this I have declared to
the that the fire of holy desire might encrese in the / and compassyon and
sorrow of da^pnacyo^ of souls / that both sorrow and love should co^strayne ye
to come to me with wely^ge and weeping teres. With teres namely of meke and
contynuall prayer offered to me with the fere of most bre^ny^ge desire / and not
only to weep for the / but also for many other creatures / and my servants
that heten all this / be they that should be constrained by charity for to weep
(as thou does) so that thou and they together should pray / and in manner
constrayne me for to show mercy to all the world / and to the mystery all
body of holy church / for whom thou prays to me somoche / if thou have mind
yt I should fulfill their desire / and give the^ refresshynge to their labor.
Therefore for to satysty to your peynes full desires / I grant reformy^ge of
holy church by good and holy curates. Not for to reform holy church by war
or by cruelte / so for to dystroye the enemies of holy church / but by pease
and rest / and by waylynge and weeping of my servants whom I have send as
laborers for winning of souls in the mysteryall body of holy church / and
for to labor to increse virtues ymonge neighbors / offering to me contynuall
mayer for them and for all my creatures for ymonge them is great defaute of
virtuous living. And therefore I will that they and ye labor and show
profit to neighbors / and in such wise ye may yield to me the fruit of
your vine. Yet should ye not cese to give to me encense of your will /
smellynges / and tyghte sweet prayers / for health of souls / for I will do
mercy to yt world / and to holy church. For now late I showed the how her
face is all foul as a leper / and that was the defaute of her mynystres / and
all christian relygyon / the which do noryshe the^ at ye breast of this spouse of
whose defautes I shall tell the in another place.

The fyfte chapyter of this party shows of the state of holy teres. And first
how this holy soul desires for to know of ye states and the fruytes of holy
teres. Also of ye dyfference of the foresaid teres / and how there be five
manners of teres. Also a short repetycyon of the menes before / and of other
matters / as it is showed in the calendar before. Ca. v.
THan that soul with a great louy^ge desire did rise up as a dru^ken soul / as
well by the union that she had in god / as by that she herd and tasted of his
right sweet sothefastnes. And also she had great heaviness of ye ygnorau^ce of
creatures / ye which knew not their maker and gracyous benefactour / the
which tasted not affeccyo^ of his dyuyne charity. And yet she had a manner of
gladness and hope / of the promise which god showed to her / techynge to her
a manner of form / yt she and all his servants owe to keep / for to stir
hy^ to give mercy to ye world. And with yt she lift up ye eye of intelleccyon
to ye right well byloued sothefastnes wherein she was knytte / desiring somewhat
for to know of the said states of the soul / of ye which god told here /
by the which she considered that a soul comes to yt state with teres /
wherefore she desired to know of god the dyffere^ce of teres / and what they
ben and from whense they came / and of the fruit that follows after weeping
teres / and how many kinds there be of teres. Because ye truth of sothefastnes
may not be know / but by endelesse sothefastnes / therefore she asked the
endelesse sothefastnesse. And because also nothy^ge may be verily know / but
it be seen with the eye of intelleccyon / wherefore she desires of sothefastnes
to have clear syghte of very true feythe / in the clear syghte of her
intelleccyon. Tha^ after time she knew of god yt he would give her clear
light / knowing thereof she lift up herself above herself / with a great
longing desire out of the corse of the bodyly feeling / and with the light
of lyfely feythe / she opened her eye of intelleccyon in the endelesse
sothefastnesse / in whom she saw and knew the truth / of ye thing yt she
asked. For god showed to her himself / that is her endelesse benygnyte / and
oned it with her brennynge desire / and so fulfilled her desire. Of the
dyfference of ye foresaid holy teres. THan said the right sweet
sothefastnesse of god to her. O right well byloued and dear daughter / daughter
thou asks and desires to know of me the dyffere^ce in kind of teres / and of
their fruytes / and I have not despised thy desire. Open therefore the eye of
thy intelleccyon / and I shall show yt by the three states of ye soul before
said vnparfyte teres granted and set in dread. But I shall first tell yt of
the teres of wicked men / and these first teres / be teres of dampnacyo^. The
second manner of teres be teres of dread / of such yt rise fro syn^e for dread
of pain / and for dread they weep. The third manner of teres be teres of the^
that after time they be risen fro sin / they begin to taste me / so with
sweetness they weep and begin to serve me. But because their love is
vnparfye / therefore their weeping is vnparfyte / as I shall tell the
afterward. The fourth manner of teres be of them yt become to parfeccyon in
charity of their neighbors / loving me without any manner beholdynge of them
self / such weep and their wepy^ge is parfyte. The fyfte manner of teres / is
oned and knytte with ye fourth before / casting out teres of sweetness / the
which is a virtuous weeping / as I shall tell ye afterward. I shall also tell
the of brennynge teres without weeping of the eye / for to satysfy to the^ that
often times desire teres and may none have. And I will yt thou know that al
these diverse states may be in one soul by rysynge up fro dread and vnparfyte
love / and coming to parfyte charity / and to the state of union. How there be
five manner of teres. NOw I shall begin to tell of these five manner of teres /
and first shortly of the teres of wicked men / whose love is without me
vnornately set. At the begy^nynge I will that thou know / that al teres come
out of the heart / for there is no membre in a man's body / that will somoche
show and satysfy the intent of ye heart / as will ye eye. If ye heart have
sorrow / the eye shows it / and if it be a sencyble sorrow / the eyes do
shede hertely teres / the which teres in a wicked man ben deedly teres and
teres of death / because of his vnordynate love / and affeccyo^ that he has
wherefore his weeping is no thing plesynge to me / nevertheless then
greatenesse of the trespass and weeping is iesse or more after the meture and
qua^tyte of his vnordynate love. All such vnordynate lovers and wicked lyuers
(though they weep) their teres be teres of death. Now shall I tell ye of those
teres that do begin to give life / that is or such that know their own
sins / and for dread of pain they weep. These be teres of the heart and
sencyble teres / that is because they be not yet come to the parfyte hate of
sin / but for offense yt they have done to me / they arysen with a manner
hertely sorrow for dread of pain / the which pain follows after the trespass
done. Therefore the eye wepeth / because he satysfyeth the sorrow of ye heart /
after this that the louie has excersysed her in virtue / she begins to leave
that dread / for she knows well / ye dread is not suffycyent enough to
grant her the bliss of heaven / as I have told the in the second state of
the soul before. And therefore she aryseth with love for to know herself and
my goodness in her / and so begins to presume of hope in my mercy / i^ the
which the heart releth gladness meddled with sorrow of sin and hope of my
merci together. Tha^ begy^neth the eye to weep / yt much weeping gothe out of
the well of ye heart / and because it is not yet come to parfeccyo^ / often times
she casts out sencyble teres / the which be called teres of ghostly love (as
thus) wha^ the soul desires ghostly comfortes by mean or medyacyon of any
creature whom he loves ghostly / when she is pryued of that she loves / or of
inward comfortes or out ward / and than if temptacyons follow or parsecucyons
of men / than the heart anon has a sorrow / and than the eye the which
feleth that sorrow and pain of ye heart / begy^neth to weep by te^dernesse /
and yt is because their own will is not yet fully forsake. Such teres be
called sencyble teres of ghostly love / or of ghostly co^passyon. But when a
soul excercyseth and uses herself in ye light of her own knowledge / she
conceyueth a manner of dysplesaunce and parfyte hate in herself / of ye whiched
if plesaunce and hate / she draws out very knowledge of my goodness / with the
fire of love / and begins to own herself / and to conform her will to my
will / and so she begins to feel joy and compassyon / joy in herself by
affection of love / and compassyon upon her neighbor. For than the eye which
will always satysfy to the heart / wepeth for hertely love in me / and for
compassyo^ of the offense that is done to me / both for ye offense yt her
neighbor does to me / and for her own trespass / and not for the pain that
she or they be worthy for to have for their trespass / but for ye offense that
is done to me. Tha^ such a soul delyteth with longing desire for to receive
ghostly meet and meet of comfort upon the table of the blessed cross that is
the passion of my sone Ihesu christ / conformynge herself with meke pasyence /
to the vndefouled lamb my only sone Ihesu christ / of whom I have made the a
bridge / as it is rehearsed before to the. After time yt she has thus swetely
walked by ye foresaid bridge / suynge the doctrine of my only sothefast sone
Ihesu christ / suffry^ge with very sweet pasyence all manner pain and heaviness
for her soul hele / and not only that she suffer pasyently / but gladly for
my name to suffer parsecucyon / sith it so is yt she has him that she
suffers fore. Than such a soul comes to so great a love and tranquyllyte
of herself / that her tongue is not suffycyent for to tell it. Than she
rests in me that am ye very peaseable see / her heart is oned in me by
affection of love / and so by the feeling of my endeles god heed / the eye
begins to weep teres of sweetness / the which teres be as a manner of milk
/ that norysheth the soul with very pasyence. All such teres / be as a manner
of sweet oy^ntment / the which casts out a right great smell of swetenes. O
my right sweet daughter how glorious is such a soul / that so ryally can
pass out of this troublous see of the world / and come to me yt am the great
peaseable see / and fill the vessel of ye heart in the sea of my everlasting
sovereign godheed. What that ever the soul be that can do so / her eye the
which is the cundyte of the heart / is about to sasatysfy the heart by
shedynge out of teres. This is that last state / in the which a soul stondeth
both blessed and doleful / she stondeth blessed by vnyo^ / yt she feleth in me
hy tasty^ge of my dyuyne charity. She stondeth also doleful of offense that is
done to me / both of herself and of her neighbors. This state of union is
not therefore let / the which shedeth teres of love / for the knowledge of
herself and of her neighbor / of whom she fyndeth co^palsyo^ / for to weep
with wepers / and for to joy with ioyers / but rather increases glory and joy
to my name. Thus ye first weeping and the third let not ye last / but each of
the^ medleth with other / for if ye last weeping / i^ ye which a soul fyndeth
so great union / took nothing of ye first and of ye second state of charity
of neyghbourheed / it were no profit. Therefore it were full necessary yt one
were meddled with an other / else it should turn to presu^pcyon / by the which
should enter a sotyll wind of elacyon / and of her own reputacyon / and so it
should fall from heyghte / to the infyrmyt^ of the first vanyte. For this
cause it is right necessary for to keep co^tynually with very knowledge of
their self charity of neyghbourheed. In this wise she should send out to me
the fervent fire of very charity / for the charity of neyghbourheed is raken of
my charity / yt is of ye charity by the which a soul knows herself and my
goodness i^ herself / whereby also she consydereth well / that she is loved of me
meruaylously / and therefore with the same love / she loves al manner reasonable
creatures / and this is the cause why she extends herfelf as soon as she
knows me for to love her neighbor / by ye which she knows well yt the most
prolyte the which she may do to me is for to yield to me pure love / by the
which she feleth that she is loved of me / and therefore she dysposeth her to
yield to me such love by mean and medyacyon of neyghboureheed / ye which is
that same mean to whom such a soul should show charytable mynystracyo^ (as I
have said to the before) ye which should be loved with such pure love / as I
love you / for like as I have loved you and love you without any manner
beholdy^ge of merytes / and thereto my own increate love without any mean
styrred me to make you of naught to my image and symylytude / ye which love ye
may not yield to me without mean. Therefore ye must yield ye same love to
reasonable creatures / louy^ge the^ without any reward of louy^ge again / and
also without any beholdynge of their own profit ghostly or bodyly / but only
for to love the^ for ye glory of my name / because they be loved of me. And so
should ye fulfill ye bidding and ye precepte of ye holy law / where it is wryte^
yt ye should love me as above all things / and your neighbor as your self.
It seems well tha^ yt a soul may not come to ye high perfyte love with teres
without knytty^ge together of ye second and ye third state before. And yet
though she be come thereto / she may not keep it / if she go fro ye affection
thereof / by ye which affection she comes to the second ky^de of teres before
said. So yt without ye same affeccyo^ to neyghbourheed / ye law of me yt am
endeles god may not be fulfilled. For there be two fete of affeccyo^ / by ye
which both ye precepts and ye cou^seyles be observed and kept as I have
told ye before. Right so these two states of ye which two states is made one
by love / noryshe^ ye soul i^ virtues / encresy^ge ye same virtue in parfeccyo^
by ye state of union / so yt it encreseth riches of grace by new diverse gifts
and meruaylous lystynges up of ye soul / with a manner knowledge of very
sothfastnes as a deedly creature may have in this life / for the feeling of one
sensualyte / and also his will is mortyfyed by such union that he has found
in me. O how sweet is such oneheed and union to a tastynge soul / for that
soul that tastes sees my secrets and pryuytes / by the which secrets /
right often times she receives a spyryte of prophecy for to know things yt
be yet to come. All this is done by my endelesse goodness / and though it so
be that a meke soul should always eschew / not the gift of affection of my
dyuyne charity / but the appetyte and desire of their own ghosty comfortes /
yet she should deem herself unworthy for to have such rest and peace of soul
/ by the which meke Judgment / she may noryshe inward virtues / and encrese
therein / for there is none so parfyte a soul in this life / but that it may
encrese to more parfeccyon / that is to parfeccyo^ of love. My right sweet and
only sone Ihesu christ was and is your heed / to whom may encrese no
parfeccyon / for he was and is one with me / and I with him / his soul was and
is blessed by union of dyuyne nature. But ye that be pilgrims and his members
/ be able evermore for to encrese in to greater parfeccyon. I do not say that
ye may encrese to an other state after time ye be come to the last / but I
say that ye may encrese in ye same last estate with such parfeccyon as it is
liking and plesynge to me for to give to you / by mean and medyacyo^ of my
grace. A short repetycyon of the matter before / and how the wicked spyryte
flees a way fro them / ye which become to the fyfthe teres / and how ye
angers of the fend be true ways for to come to this holy state of teres. NOw
hase thou seen the states of teres and the dyfference of them / as it lyketh my
goodness for to do satysfaccyon to thy desire. First I told the of the teres
of them / that do live in deedly syn^e / where I said that the teres of them
come out of ye heart / as al manner of teres done / for the greuau^ce of their
heart is showed out by weeping / but because ye living of them is corrupt /
therefore the teres that do come from such a corrupt heart must needs be
corrupt and wretched. The second state of teres be of such as do begyn^e for
to know their own sins / and do think on the peynes that longen to them /
and therefore they do begin to weep. This manner of weeping is given to me of
diverse persons and frail / as a manner of a general entente. But there be
some that do know themself without seruyle dread / that is without thynky^ge
of pain / and some that do go with a great hate of the^ self by ye which
hate they hold the^ self worthy to have pain. And some serve me with a manner
of symplenesse / sorowynge hertely for offenses done to me. Nevertheless he
that gothe with great hate of him self / is more able for to come and attain
to the parfyte state than to the other twain / for though those twain
excersyce theymselfe for to come to that perfyte state / yet he that stondeth
in great hate of himself / comes first thereto / that one must be well ware
that he abide not long i^ seruyle dread / and that other that he abide not
long in his symplenesse / lest it fortune him to wax dull and slow. Now
behold my dear daughter / for is this one manner of mune calling. The third
and the fourth manner of teres is of all such ye be lift up fro seruyle dread
/ and be come to love and hope / taslynge my endelesse mercy / and receyuynge
of me many gifts and ghostly comfortes / for whom the eye wepeth /
satysfyenge the sencyble fely^ge of the heart. But because that a soul is yet
vnparfyte / meddled with ghostly sencyble wayly^ge (as I have said) it comes to
the fourth state / excercysynge herself in virtues / where a soul encreseth
by desire / oneth her self with my will / in somoche that she may another will
nor desire / but as I will / arrayed with charity of neyghbourheed / by the
which charity she draws in to herself a manner waylynge of love / and also a
sorrow of love of offense that is done to me / and for harm that their
neighbor receives / by offense yt is done to me. In this wise is a soul o^ed
with the fourth and ye last parfeccyon / where in sothe she is oned and where
also increases the fire of holy desire / f^o the which holy desire the fend
sleeth a way and may not (...) such a soul for no manner in^ury that is done
to her / because she is ^^ade pacyent in very charity of neyghbourheed / not
for no comfort another ghostly nor bodyly / for all such co^for^^ the has
despised / both by hate and also by very meekness. Nevertheless yet ye fend
slepeth not / but his watch may not hurt none such / because he may not
suffer ye here of her charity / nor ye sweet smell of oneheed or union that
they make in me / ye which am yt peaseable se / in whom a soul may not be
dysccyued / as long as she stondeth oned in me / fro whom ye fend flees
away / as does a fle fro a boyly^ge pot for ye fere that he has of ye fire
/ if it were but a little warm / he would not be aferde but he would fly in
though often time he were in point to peryshe / finding more hete there in tha^
he wend. Right so it fares of a soul or that she come to ye state of
parfeccyon. The send because he seems yt she is often a little warm entret in
her by diverse te^ptacyons. And if he find there any manner hete of love or
myslykynge and dysplesaunce of sins / anon he is withstonde so yt he dare
not enere. Every soul therefore may be glad and joyful yt feleth many grievous
heaviness for yt is ye way by ye which she may come to this glorious and sweet
face. There is no time that a soul is so well know if I be in her / as is in
time of trybulacyo^s (and how) I shall tell ye. She did know well yt wha^ she
is in trybulacyo^s and may not be delivered to make resyste^ce ane^des the^ /
but needs she must have them / save only she may wtsto^de ye will of of the^ /
not for to co^set to the^ / she may well know thereby yt she is naught of
herself / for if she were ought / she would avoid yt she would not have. In
this wise she is loved by knowing of herself / and renneth to me her god by
ye light of holy feythe / by whose goodness / she fyndeth yt she keeps i^ her
good will / ye which will co^se^teth not i^ time of many batayles / i^ ye which
/ many times she is troubled. Thus than you be excercysed and taught / by the
doctrine of my right i^ wete and only sone Ihesu christ / troubles and
heaviness and many trybulacyons peynes and aduersytes (both of men and of
fendes) if they be softely and mekely suffered they encrese you to virtues and
make you to come to great parfeccyon. How they that desire to have teres of
eyes and may not have the^ / such have teres of fire. And for what cause god
withdraws bodyly teres. I Have told the of parfyte and vnparfyte teres / and
how all manner teres do come out of the heart / out of that vessel comes every
tere of what condycyon and manner that it be / and therefore all teres may well
be called hertely teres. Nevertheless all the dyfference stondeth between
ordynate and vnordynate love / and between parfyte and vnparfyte love / as is
rehearsed before. Now shall I answer to thy desire / where thou did desire to
know what is ye cause / why parfyte souls i^ this lyte that would weep may
not weep / yt I shall tell the. There is an other manner of weeping than by
teres of eyes / for there is a manner of wayly^ge and weeping of fire / that is
of very holy desire / the which desire is consumed by affection. They would
spend their life in waylynge and weeping / by holy hate of themself / and
health of souls / and they may not have it. All such therefore (as I have
said) have teres of fire / in the which teres of fire / ye holy ghost wayleth
and wepeth for the^ and for their neighbors before me (that is) my dyuyne
charity bre^neth ferue^tly a soul with the flamme of yt holy ghost / ye which
offreth up before me longing desires without teres of eyes / for they be only
teres of fire / ye which I have said / ye holy ghost wepeth for he may not no
otherwise offer up to me ye desire of their will les / but only by fire of
brennynge love. Thus it seems yt the glorious apostle saint Paul meant when he
said thus. Ipse enim spiritus orat pro nobis: gemitibus in ennarrabilibus.
That is to say / ye same holy ghost endeles god prays for us with teres and
waylynges yt be unspeakable. By this therefore it seems yt teres of fire be as
fruytefull as teres of water / and yet often times more / after ye qua^tyre and
mesure of love / and therefore such a soul should in no wise be astonyed / nor
she should not thy^ke yt she is depryued fro me / though she have not such
teres as she would / but she should desire the^ with a will / accordy^ge with my
will. For other while I will not grant her bodyly teres / because I would yt
she co^tynued in lowenes before me / tastynge me often times with contynuall
prayer / and holy desire. For if she should receive ye of me yt she desires /
it should be little profit to her / in asmoche as she shall seem yt her desire
is always rewarded / by ye which she has her asky^ge / and so she should
hold her apayde with yt she has and desire no more. Therefore I only yt she
should encrese i^ virtue / withdraw fro her actual teres of the eyes / for ye
which teres / I give to her mental teres full of fire of dyuyne charity / not
able to be spoken. And so in every state and at all times such mental teres
should be liking and plesynge to me / so that the eye of intelleccyon with ye
light of syghte / be not shut nor closed fro ye rebou^dy^ge of my endelesse
truth with affeccyo^ of love / for I am a leche / and you be seek folk / and
therefore I give to every soul as it is needful or spedefull to their health /
so yt parfeccyon may be encresed in your souls. This is yt very sothefastnesse
and declaracyon of the slates of teres declared beforesayde of me endelesse
truth / to the my right sweet daughter. Forsake therefore parfytely thyselfe
in the blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu encresynge contynually in virtue
/ that the fire of my dyuyne charity may be noryshed in the. How ye four
states of ye five states of teres give dyuersytes of teres / and how that god
will be served with thing ye has no end / and not only with thing that
has end. THese five foresaid states be as five water pottes pryncypall (of
the which) four of them do give infynyte dyuersytes of teres / and al those
do give life / if they be excercysed in virtue (as it is beforefore said) but
how be they infynyte? I say not that ye should be infynytely in such welynge
and teres / but I call them infynyte teres / for the infynyte and endelesse
desire of those that have such teres. And thus every tere comes out of the
heart / and the heart gives it to the eye / the which first is gadered
together with a fervent brennynge desire / that as a grene tree laid in ye fire
casts out water for ye hete of ye fire / because it is grene / for and it
were dry it would not avoid water / as it does when it is grene. In the same
wise an heart that flory sheth by renuynge of grace / sweteth out teres of
love / lyenge in ye chymnaye of dyuyne love / and so fire of love and teres of
love be made all one by brenny^ge desire. And also because desire is never
ended and fulfilled in this life / for the more it loves / the less it seems
that it loves / and so it excercyseth holy desire / the which is grounded in
charity / with ye which desire ye eye wepeth. And all though such a soul
were departed fro the body and come to me fynaly (that am her end) yet she for
saketh not therefore her desire / ever for to desire me and the charity of her
neighbor / for charity it entered with in her / as a lady bryngy^ge in with her
ye fruit of al other virtue. Nevertheless yet as than her pain is ended (as I
have said here before) for she may not than desire with pain / but without
pain / for than in her desire she has me in sothe without pain / and may
not love me with seruyle dread / that so long time has desired me. And thus i^
this wise ghostly hongre is noryshed in a soul / that is though they have
ghostly hongre of the desire of me / yet they be fulfilled / and though they
be filled / yet they be hongry / and yet is there no pain in that ho^gre / for
there may never lack parfeccyon. And in this wise your desire is infynyte
and endelesse / for else it were right naught / nor virtue were nothy^ge
quycke / if I were served only with thing that had end / than because I am
god endelesse / I will be served of you with thing infynyte and endelesse /
and ye have no other thing that is endelesse / but only your affection and
your desire of souls / and so I said ye dyuersyte of teres were infynyte.
Right so in ye same wise it may be said of infynyte and endelesse desire /
the which is knytte and oned with infynyte teres / and when a soul is
departed fro the body / ye teres be left without / but the affection of
charity draws to him the fruit of teres / consumynge outewarde teres /
right as the soul is consumed in the fourneys of love / not for the soul is
out of the furneys of love / but because the fervent hete of that fourneys of
love has soken her up and drawn her to it. In the same wise a soul after
time it is come to cast the fire of my dyuyne charity / and after time it is
passed out of this world with affection of my charity and love of her
neighbor / and with love of oneheed / by the which she shed teres of love / she
ceseth never for to offer to me her right blessed and weeping desires without
any manner pain / not with weeping of the eye / for yt is dried up (as I have
said before) but with weeping of fire of ye holy ghost. This right dear
daughter you hase seen and herd how teres be infynyte / for in this worldly
life / there is no tongue can tell how many diverse waylynges and and wepynges
there be in these fore said wepynges and state of teres. Of ye fruytes of
teres of worldly men. NOw shall I tell the of the fenytes of teres given there
that it is shed out with desire / and what it works in a soul. First I
shall begin of the fyfthe / of the which I made me^cyon in the begy^nynge /
that is of such as live wretchydly in the world / making to the^ their god
of creatures / and of their own propre sensualyte / of the which proceeds
all manner harm / ye comes both to the body and to the soul. I told the if
thou remember ye / that all manner of teres came out of ye heart (and sothe it
is) for an heart of a loving soul soroweth / in somoche as it loves worldely
men / al such souls do wayle and ^epe / wha^ they feel sorrow in heart / that
is wha^ they be depryued fro that thing yt they loved / yet nevertheless
their wepynges and waylynges be much diverse fro wepynges of worldely men. Will
thou know how much? Certain somoche as the love is diverse / and because the
root of her own se^cyble love is corrupt / what ever spryngeth thereof must
needs be corrupt / for that love is as a manner of a tree bry^gynge nothing
else fourth / but fruit of death / stynkynge flowers / spotty leaves / and
branches al ybroke and bowed down to the ground by diverse wy^des / right so
fares the tree of ye soul if souls be well dysposed / than they be trees of
love / for wtoute love they can not live / in asmoche as they be made of me by
love / such a soul ye lives so virtuously sets ye root of her tree in
the valaye of meekness / but al those that do live wretchydly / set their tree
in the mouth of pride / and because it is evil planted and set / it may not
bring forth fruit of life / but deedly. The fruytes be the works of them /
the which be venymed and poisoned with sins / and though it so be that they
do any good deed / in asmoche as ye root is corrupt / therefore all the fruit
that sueth thereof is corrupt (yt is) for as such a soul is in deedly sin /
every good deed that it does may not protyte to life euerlasty^ge / because
it is not done in grace. Nevertheless yet good deeds must be done at all times
/ for there is no evil unpunished / nor good deed unrewarded. Every good deed
done out of grace / is not suffyeyent / nor profyteth in no wise to
everlasting life / as I have said / but my dyuyne bou^^le and ryghtwysenesse
yeldeth therefore an vnparfyte reward / as the work in it self is vnparfyte.
Otherwise I reward such one in te^porall goods for such good deeds /
otherwhyle I give him time and space for to amede hy^ of his lyuy^ge / and
other while I do hy^ this mercy / that is wha^ I give him life of grace by some
manner mean of my servants / the which be to me acceptable and plesaunte /
as I did to my glorious doctor saint Paul the which by the prayers of saint
Steven rose fro his mysse believe and parsecucyons that he did and showed to
true christian folk. So tha^ by this thou may well know that in what state a
creature sto^deth in / he should not cese to do well. I said also that such a
foul is lykened to a tree bry^geth forth stynkynge flowers / and sothe it is
/ the thoughts of ye heart of such a soul be stynky^ge flowers that like me
never adele / and all the thoughts of such a soul be nothing else but hate
and dysplesaunce of her neighbor / having the condycyo^ of a thief that
robs worship and honor fro me that am his maker / and yeldeth and keeps
it to himself. This flower brings forth the fylthe of right wretchyd and
falls Judgment / the which Judgment is in two wyses / one Judgment is
ane^des me / demynge and foriudgynge my pryuy Judgments / and all yt I
grant to him for life / and by my mysteryall pryuytes he tourneth all in to
hate mysse demynge me wyckedly / after his seek sight and vnderstondy^ge /
because he has made bly^de ye eye of his intelleccyo^ by his own sencyble
love / and covered the clear seeing perle of his most holiest feyth the which
suffers not him to se and know ye truth. The other Judgment and the last is
ane^des his neighbor / of the which often times comes much evil / for
asmoche as a wretched man knows not yet himself / and take upon hy^ for to
know the heart and the affection of an other man or woman / by one deed that
he sees or by word / or words that he hereth or says of them / and so
demethe affection of thyr hertes. All my servants deem the best / for they be
grounded in me that am most sovereign good / but all other ever deem evil /
because they ben grounded wretchydly in evil. Of the which Judgments often
times aryseth and spryngeth evil hate / manslaughter / and dysplesaunce
anendes neyghbourheed / and with drawing fer fro the virtues of my parfyte
servants. I said also that such a soul is lykened to a tree that brings
forth spotty leaves / ye which be words going out of the mouth / in the
which vnworshypp of me / and of the blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
christ / and harm of neighbors / and they fere never for to say evil of an
other / and for to blaspheme and condemn my works / and for to say enyll of
every reasonable creature / as it falls i^ to their mysse Judgments / and
they think not such wretched folk / that the tongue is made for to yield to
me honor and worship / and for to knowledge their own defautes / and for to
work by love of virtues / for health of neyghbourheed. Thus such wretches
will not occupy thyr tongues / but rather by myspeky^ge bry^ge fourth spotty
leaves of wretchyd sin / for the heart that they come fro is not clean and
pure / but much defouled with doubleness and much wretchydnesse. Lo how
much perell falls of such myscheuous speky^ge and brings in harm without
ghostly harm of pryuacyo^ of grace which it does in the soul / for because
of words / ye have seen and herd many chaungynges of states / desolacyons of
cytees / and much manslaughter / ynd many other euylles for a wretchyd word
enters in to ye minds of the heart of them that it is said to / where a
sword should not enter. I say also that this tree has seven wretchyd
branches ye be bowed to the ground / of the which both flowers and leaves
gone out / as it is rehearsed before. These seven branches be the seven deedly
sins / the which be full of many diverse sins knytte in ye root fro the
stock of the love of himself and of his own pride / the which makes first
wretched and miserable branches / and flowers of many wicked thoughts. After
that comes forth spotty leaves of words / and fruit of evil works. These
branches do sto^de bowed to ye ground (that is for to say) that the branches
of deedly sins do not turn to none other things / but to the earth of
every frail and vnordynate substance of the world / and they do not look
after none other thing / but in what wise they may be noryshed vnsacyably of
the earth / for they ben never fulfilled. They be insatiable / and intolerable
to the^ self / and therefore it is requysyte and right co^uenyent / that ever
they be unquiet and unrestful / sythen they desire such a thing yt never
may fulfill the^ / as I have said. This is the cause which may not be
fulfilled / for they desire ever a thing that has end / and yet they
themself be endeles (as to their being) for their being has never end /
though they end anendes grace / by the cause of deedly sins. And for
because a man is set and put above all create things / and not vntreate
things be above him / therefore he may not be fulfilled nor stand in
quietness / but in a thing that is greater than himself / and that is no
other / but I god everlasting. And therefore I alone may fulfill them / and for
because he is depryued from me for his syn^e that he has done he sto^deth
co^tynually in pain and tourme^t / after ye which pain follows wepynges and
welynges. How such worldely wepers ben smyten with four manner wyndes. ANd
when that the wyndes come they smite the tree of the propre sensualyte / where
he made all his begy^nynge. Of these four wyndes other it is a wind of
prosperyte / or a wind of aduersyte / or of dread / or of conscience / these
be ye four wyndes. The wind of prosperyte norysheth pride / with great
presumpcyon / with magnyfyenge of himself and little regard on his neighbor
If he be a lord / the wind of prosperyte norysheth this pride with much
vnryghtwysenesse and vanyte of heart / and with uncleanness of body and of soul
/ with his propre reputacyon / and with many other defautes which do follow
after them which thy tongue might not tell. Whether this wy^de of prosperyte
is not corrupt in himself? no / nor this wind nor that other / but the
pryncypall rote of the tree is corrupted / where throw that rote makes all
things corrupt which comes fro that rote. For I that send all things by
my gift with abu^daunce am all sovereign god / what ever it be in this wy^de of
prosperyte / wherefore wayly^ge follows / for his heart is not fulfilled / for
he desires that he may not have / and so when he may not have that he would
/ than he has pain / and that pain he wayleth. Now I have said to ye that
the eye will make a saute to ye heart. After this there comes a wy^de of
seruage dread / in ye which wind a man makes him afraid with his own
shadow or derkenes dredynge to lose that yt he loves / or he dredeth to lose
his own life / or of his children / or the life of other creatures / or he
dredeth to lose his own state / or the state of his fre^des and all for his
own love / or for worship / or for riches. Here this dread has not his
delight in pease / for he has not that that he would ready ordained after my
will / therefore that dread of seruage follows him / and is made tymorate and
the servant of the wretchydful sin / and because he may behold (as is the
thing that he serves) and that is sin which is naught / therefore he is
come to naught / after ye wy^de of dread has smyten him. And after this anon
tha^ comes ye wy^de of trybulacyon and of aduersyte of that same yt he dredde
/ and takes fro him and pryueth him of that he had / sometime in a partyculer
thing / and sometime i^ a general thing Generally is wha^ he is pryued of ye
life for by the stre^gthe of the death he is pryued of all things. Sometime
also the wind of aduersyte is partyculer / which sometime takes fro him one
thing / and sometime an other thing / sometime it takes a way of his health
/ or of his children or of his riches / or of states or of worshyppes / after
that I se that it be needful for your health which am a soft leche / and
therefore I gave the^ to you. And for asmoche as your freyite it utterly
corrupt and with out any knowing / it dystroyeth the fruit of pasyence / and
therefore inpasyence does bry^ge fourth sclau^ders and grutchynges / hateredes
/ and dysplesau^ces / against me and my curates / and they have received in to
death that I have give them in to life / after the mesure that they had of
love. Now it is come to the waylynge of inpasyence yt tourmenteth / and ye
which dries up ye soul and sleeth it / and takes away the grace of life /
and dries up and consumes the body / and makes him blind bodyly and ghostly
/ and pryueth him of all delytes / and takes away all hope / for he is pryued
of that thing / wherein he had delight / wherein he set his affection / hope /
and feythe / so that ever he soroweth and wayleth. And not only his teres make
to him so many inconuenyentes / but his vnordynate desire and ye sorrow of his
heart / for if his heart were ordynate and had ye life of grace / than were his
teres ordynate / and should constrayne me everlasting god / to do him mercy.
But why said I that this was and is ye tere of death? For to ye messanger
which shows you the death or ye life that should be in ye soul. Forthermore
I said that there came the wind of conscience / and that makes the goodness
of my godheed / for wha^ I have proved the^ with prosperyte / to yt intent yt I
should withdraw the fro their propre love / throw my love. Also when I proved
the^ with dread / that throw i^portunyte they should set their love to love me
with virtue. Also after time I have preued them with trybulacyo^ yt they should
know their freylte / and ye little stablenesse of the world to some / there all this profyteth not / I give a prycke or a remors of conscience / for I love
more tha^ can be spoken / and that remors I give them / for they should arise
for to open their mouth / and cast out the rotten fylthe of their sins by
holy co^fessyo^. But they as obstynate ryghtfully renreued of me throw their
own wickedness which would i^ no wise receive my grace / fle fro that prycke
and remors of conscience and led it all about with wretchydfull delectacyo^s
and with dysplesau^ce of me and of their neighbors / and all this falls /
for the root with all ye tree is corrupt / and tourneth all things to them
in to death. They stoude in contynuall peynes / welynges and sorrows / as it is
said before.. And if they amend them not while they have time to use their
fre choice / they pas out of wayly^ge and sorrow in this time which has end
/ and so with yt waylynge they should come to the sorrow yt shall have none
end / so yt that sorrow which has end / shall come to them to ye sorrow
that has none end (and ye cause is) for their teres were shed with an hatered
of virtue which was Infynyte (yt is to say) with a desire of ye soul grounded
in hate red which has none end. Neuertesse if yt they would / they should
have come out of ye hatered by help of my dyuyne grace / in the time yt they
were fre / not withsto^dynge. I said their hatered was infynyte (it is
infynyte) for asmoche as it is of affeccyyon of the being of the soul / but
not that hate nor love / which should be in the soul. For while ye be in this
life / ye may hate and love as ye will / but if your hate or love end in the
love of virtue / tha^ it receives good without end / which is called
infynyte. And if he end in hatered of virtue / tha^ ye stonden in hate that is
infynyte / and receyuen everlasting dampnacyon (as it is said before) when I
showed to the that they drenchen themself in the floode (in somoche) that now
which be so passed may not desire goodness / for asmoche as they be pryued
of me and of my sovereign charity / the which seyntes do savor and taste one
with an other. They be pryued also of your charity / which be put here of me
as pilgrims or wayegoers / so that they may not come to your end / which
is the end of everlasting life. Also prayers nor alms / nor no other goood
workings may do profit to them / they be yt lymmes and the members cut of
fro the body of my dyuyne charity / for while they did live they would not be
oned to the obedyence of the commaundymentes of my servants in the pryuy body
of holy church / nor in the holy obedience of her / whereof ye do draw out to
you the blood of the holy lamb (that is to say) of my only begoten sone
Ihesu christ / and therefore they have received the fruit of everlasting
dampnacyon / with weeping and gnastynge of tethe. These be the deuyls martyrres
/ of the which I told yt before / therefore the devil gives them ye same
fruit / the which he has for him self. Therefore thou sees right well here
that thus waylynge here gives to them the fruit of pain in this time that is
fynyte / and in ye last end it gives to them a co^uersacyon of fendes /
which conuersasacyon shall be infynyte. Of the fruytes of ye second and of ye
third teres. HOw shall I tell the of ye fruytes that they receive / which do
begin to arise fro sin to grace by dread of pain. Some there ben that do
go out fro death of deedly sin / by the great dread of peynes / this is a
general cally^ge / as it is rehearsed before. What fruit thynkes thou such one
receives / the which begins to avoid so the house of his soul from
uncleanness by the messanger of dred / the which dread is send by fre choice
/ I shall the. After time that such one has purged his soul by dread fro
sin / he receives pease and rest of conscience / and begins for to
dyspose his affection / and for to open his eye of intelleccyon / for to se his
place wherein he stondeth / ye which or than it was void / he might not se
clearly / for because it was fufylled with roten fylthe of many diverse sins.
Also he begins for to receive comfort / for the worm of coscyence is in
rest and pease / abiding for to receive the meet of virtue / as a man does /
for after time his stomach is heled and has cast out bad humors / he
makes ready his appetyte for to receive meet. In the same wise all such abide
only that the hand of fre choice make ready within himself for to receive
with love meet of virtue / for after yt time that meet is made ready / he abides
for to ete it (and so it is in sothe) for an excercysed soul in virtue after
time affection of sin is voyded by dread / she begins for to array ye
soul with virtues (though it be yet vnparfyte) for all be it that it be
arysen fro dread / it receives both delight and comfort / for love of the
soul receives delight of very sothefastnesse / because that I myself am love
/ and by the same comfort and delight that she receives of me and in me / she
begins for to love me ye more swetely / feeling the swetenes of my comfort
/ orelles of creatures for me / excercysynge ye very same love in the house of
the soul. And therefore what man that enters in to this house of the soul /
after time that dread has puryfyed and cleansed it / he begins for to
receive the fruit of dyuyne goodness / by ye which dyuyne goodness / he has
a house in ye soul for to rest in. And than after the time that love is entered
for to take possessyon of that house / it begins for to taste / receyuy^ge
by such tastynge / many fold and diverse fruytes of comfort / an so abiding
to the last state / it receives a fruit for to set and make ready the
meettable. That is after time a soul is passed fro dread to love of virtue /
she sets and makes ready the meettable / and that is entering in to the
third teres in the heart / by ye which teres the soul prepares or makethe
ready and sets forth ye meettable of my right well beloved and sothefast
sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed on ye cross / and of his blessed passyo^ / in the
which blessed passion / she fyndeth meet of right great sweetness and
amyable words of health / the which words don^^^ and show the great
honor and worship of me / and your health / for the which health / ye
side of my right dear and well beloved sothefast and only sone Ihesu christ
crucyfyed was opened / gyuy^ge himself to you in to meet. Tha^ such a soul
begy^neth to taste the worship of me and health of souls / with dysplesaunce
and hate of sins / what fruit such a soul receives of this manner state of
teres? I shall tell ye. She receives a manner of stre^gthe i^ holy hate /
against her propre sensualyte / grounded and set stably in the right
plesaunt fruit of very mekenes with a manner pacyence / the which auoydeth al
manner sclaundre / and depryueth the souls fro al peynes / for because the
propre will is sleen with ye sword of holy hate / in the which will dwelled
and is belefte all peynes / for only sencyble will is sclaundred by Iniuryes /
orelles by temporal or spyrytuall comfortes (as I have said to the before)
and so a soul comes to i^pacye^ce. But because will is mortyfyed with right
sweet wepy^ges and desires / therefore ye soul begins to taste the fruit of
teres / as of right sweet pacyence. O fruit of right great sweetness / o
how sweet and presaunt art you to them that tasten the / and to me liking /
for they that dwell in bytternesse tasten thy very sweetness / and all those
that tasten that fruit in time of wrongs / they receive pacyence. And in that
time that the soul of a man is possed up and down in the great storms or
tempests of the sea of this world / by great wawes of pereylous wyndes /
than is such a soul right pacyent and peaseable without any evil covered and
clypped with my right sweet and endeles dyuyne will / where she receives a
clothe of very brennynge charity / in ye which vesture or clothe / may never
water enter. O right well byloued daughter / this pacyence is a quenesette in
the toure of stre^gthe / and such a queen it is that ever ouercometh / and
never is overcome / and yet she is not alone / but she is felyshypped with
parseuerau^ce. Such pacye^ce is called ye right pythe or marowz of charity /
the which shows ye vesture and the clothe of charity openly / so to be
known whether it be a weddy^ge clothe or not. If that vesture or clothe be
strayte in parfeccyo^ / tha^ it is showed by some manner of conrrary thing of
i^parfeccyon. Virtues may otherwhyle be hyd / showing themself parfyte /
when they be vnparfyte (outaken to the) they may not be hyd. For if this right
sweet pacye^t be in thy soul / it shows all virtues virtuously / both
quycke and parfyte / and if it be not in thy soul / it shows all virtues
vnparfyte / the which virtues ben not yet come to the meettable of the passion
of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed upon ye cross / where that
same pacyence is conceived by very knowledge of thyselfe / and by the sweet
knowledge of my endelesse goodness in thyselfe / spronge and brought fourth
by an holy hate / anointed by very meekness. To this pacyence shall not be
denied / another the meet of my worship and honor / nor desire of health of
souls / but she it is that receives and eteth contynually the very same meet
/ and that is sothe. Behold and se therefore right dear daughter / how glorious
martyrs by suffraunce of martyrdom / did ete this meet / that is desire of
health of souls / their death gave life / their death areysed souls fro death to
life / and avoided fro them derkenesse of deedly sins. The world with all his
excellences and worthynesse / and tyrauntes / with all his powers / might never
defend the^ fro the^ / for the might and strength of this pacyent queen was
myghtyly workynge in them. This virtue of pacye^ce stondeth stydfastly / as a
light on high upon a candlestycke / this is yt glorious very light and fcuyte
/ ye which teres has showed after time it is come parfytely to charity of
neyghbourheed / etynge and receyuynge ghostly that blessed charity / with my
only sothefast sone Ihesu christ / yt very vndefouled and vnuenymed lamb in
longing desire / and with an intolerable pain / dredynge the offense of me
that am his endeles maker / I say not that such pacyence is peyned with pain
/ yt tourmenteth in her langynge desire after charity of neyghboureheed / for
love with such very pacyence sleeth al such dredes and propre loves that do
show pain / but I say it is pain with pain comfortable / founded only in my
charity / dredynge the offense of me and hurtynge of neighbors / the which
pain makes a soul set in grace / and joyful in herself / for that is a
token yt shows me to be in a soul by a synguler grace. Of ye fruit of the
fourth and the fyfth state of teres. I Have told the of the fruit of the
third teres / and therefore now shall I tell the of the fourth and the last
state of teres of one heed or of union / ye which is not departed fro the
third state of teres (as I have said) but they be oned and knytte together /
as charity of me and charity of neighbors be coupled together / yt one makes
ye other sauory / but yt profit of it increases so greatly to the fourth
state of teres / yt a soul using such teres / suffers not only pacyently
such wro^ges as it did in ye third state of teres before / but desires
trybulacyons gladly (in so much) that it sets right naught by any manner of
recreacyons / what wise that ever they come / so yt only it may be confyrmed
at all times to crystes passion. This thing receives a fruit of rest and
quietness and one parfyte vnyo^ by feeling / in my right sweet dyuyne nature /
where it tastes milk of a child yt is peased rests at his moders breast and
takethe her milk by ye mean of the flesh / in ye same wise a soul after
time that it is come to this last state / it rests at the breast of my dyuyne
charity / holdy^ge i^ her mouth of holy desire / ye flesh of christ crucyfyed
(yt is to say) yt she follows his steps and doctrine / for she knew well
in ye third state / that by me ye fader / she might not go so / for in me
endeles fader might never pain fall. But she knew well that she might go so /
by my right well by loved or amyable and right sweet sone / ye which suffered
pain. Without pain i^ no wise ye may follow him / by the which peyntull
following / ye should come to virtues / that be well proved by pacyence. And
therefore she has well set her at ye breast of my only sone Ihesu christ
crucyfyed / the which is my endelesse sothefastnes / by the which breast she
draws to her milk of virtue / in the which virtue is contained life of grace
/ yt makes her to taste my dyuyne nature / ye which gives sweetness to
virtues / and sothe it is. For virtues in themself be nothing sweet / but for
because they be holy and oned in me yt am yt dyuyne charity / therefore they be
sweet. For a soul i^ that plyght set upon virtue / has no manner beholdynge to
her own profit / but only to the honor and worship of me / and health of
souls. Behold therefore right sweet daughter how sweet this state is and how
glorious / in ye which state a soul has made such an union / and oned at ye
breast of charity / for right as a mouth that souketh is never found without
the breast / nor the breast without milk / in the same wise yt holy desire of
such a soul is never found without christ crucyfyed / nor without me endeles
fader / ye which soul fyndeth in me by tasty^ge / souereyne and endeles
godheed. O I would a man might se how the myghtes of the soul be fulfilled /
ye mind is fulfilled with contynuall remembrance of me / drawing by love to
her my benefytes / not only the deed of my benefytes / but the affection of my
charity / the which I have given to her / and namely the synguler benefyce of
a creature / seeing herself made to the image of me and likeness / in the
which benefyte rehearsed in the first state before said / she knows in
herself the pain of unkindness / the which followed her. And therefore by
the benefytes of ye blood of Ihesu christ / she arose fro wretchedness / in ye
which blood I have reformed her again to grace / washing ye faces of your
souls fro lepre of sin by the same blood / wherein a soul fyndeth herself
in ye secunde state / tastynge there one manner of sweetness of love / the
which mysse lyketh all sin / in ye which sweetness / she sees well how
sin dyspleaseth me somoche / that I punyshe it upon the body of my only sone
Ihesu upon the cross. After this she fyndeth yt comfort of ye holy ghost yt
has declared and clereth a soul in very sothefastnesse. But when receives a
soul this truth? In sothe after time it knows in herself my benefytes / by
ye first and secunde state. Than it receives a parfyte light of me / yt am
endeles fader / knowing my very truth and ryghtwysenes and sothefastnes that
I have made here by love / for to give her endeles life / this is yt sothe and
truth / which truth I showed you with the blood of my only sone Ihesu christ
crucyfyed. After time she knows this she loves / and by love she shows it
/ louy^ge yt I love / and hatynge yt I hate. Thus she fyndeth herself in the
third gre of charytable neyghboureheed / so that the mind at this breast is
fulfilled with parfeccyon / for it has my benefytes in mind. The
intelleccyon also receives this light / and for inwardely beholdynge in mind
/ it knows the truth / and leuynge the bly^denes of her propre love / it
dwells and remains stydfastly i^ ye clear syghte of eryst crucyfyed / where
it knows both god and man / ye which knowledge comes not of kind (as I
have said) another by workynge of her own propre virtue / but of grace given of
my most swetest sothefastnesse / the which very sothefastnes / dyspyseth never
love nor longing desire / nor labors / nor trauayles / that in such love
lo^gynge is offered to me. Will also and affection yt follows after
intelleccyon / comes and coupleth him with parfeccyo^ / and most brennynge
love. If it were than asked / when the myghtes of ye soul be thus fulfilled /
whether this be a soul? It might be said yes / though it be alterate by
union of love. What tongue were that / that might tell the excelle^ce of this
last vnytyue state / and also of these diverse fruytes that such a soul
receives when the myghtes ben fulfilled so by the techynge of my endelesse god
heed. This it that sweet co^gregacyon of the which I made mencyo^ to the in
the three general grees before / declarynge by the word of my sothefastnesse /
the which no tongue is fuffycyent for to tell. But holy doctors illumyned by
this glorious light / do show well that it is sothe / the which doctors
declared holy writ by the same light / like as it is found of the glorious
doctoure saint Thomas Alquyn / the which had the cunning and science of all
holy write / rather by contynuaunce and excersyce of holy and devout prayers /
and by lyfty^ge up of ye soul / and light of vndersto^dy^ge / than by any
study and business of man. He was a light which I send in to the mysteryall
body of ye mother of holy church / for to que^che the derkenesse of erroures.
And if thou will turn the to the glorious euangelyst saint Johan / thou may
se what light of grace he gate upon that precious breast of my only sothefast
sone Ihesu christ / with the which light by such grace gotten / he preched
about / as long as he dwelled in earth. And so this gracious light ran about
yt it came to all the apostles and doctors of holy church / so yt all they
did show the same truth of crystes doctrine by ye same light / one one wise
/ and an other an other wise. Nevertheless the inward feeling yt they had by yt
gracyous light and unspeakable sweetness / and also perfyte vnyo^ couthe nor
can no tongue tell / for it was and is a thing yt is infynyte / and so it seemed
to saint Paul (wha^ he said thus) no eye may se / nor no ere may here / nor
in to man's heart may ascede the sencyble swetenes and parfyte union that god
has ordained to them that been parfyte lovers. O how sweet is that swear
mansyon / and that parfyte union above all sweetness that such a soul has
in me / for i^ herself has she no will but her will was in me and she is one
with me / such a soul cries ever with the voice of holy desire / not with the
voice of a man in the syghte of my dyuyne majesty after heithe of soul. These
be the vnytyue fruytes that a soul receives and eteth in this life in the
last state of teres / gotten with much labor / wepynges / and syghy^ges / and
so it passes parfytely forth with very parseueraunce fro life of grace yt is
fro this union the which is vnparfyte as long as it is bound in the body /
for in this life it may not be fulfilled / of that thing that it desires.
And therefore because it is yet bound with a contrary us law / the which law
though it be a sleep by affection of virtue / it is not yet deed / wherefore it
may yet be waked / if the instrument of virtue be put aside / ye which makes
it sleep. Nevertheless yet this inparfyte vnyo^ ledeth the soul for to receive
euerlasty^ge durable parfeccyon / that in no wise it may be take away fro her
/ where it shall taste with my very tasters me endelesse life and most sovereign
everlasting good / for I never fail / but always am everlasting / such they
be that receive euerlasty^ge life / for ye endelesse fruit of their weeping
teres / the contrary of them / that receive for the fruit of their teres
endeles death. These they be that be come parfytely fro waylynge to joy /
receyuynge everlasting life for the fruit of their teres / and they cry with
fervent charity / and offer teres to me for you / as it is rehearsed before to
you. Now I have declared to the the grees of teres / and the inparfercyon of
them / and also yt fruit that a soul receives of such manner teres. And also
that parfyte folk receive me yt am endeles life for their mede / and wicked
folk in the contrary wise perpetual dampnacyo^. How this devout soul wha^
she gave thankynges to god / for the declaracyon of ye said states of teres /
made three petycyo^s to god. THa^ that devout soul which was langorynge in
great desire / for yt sweet declaracyon and satysfaccyon ye which she had of
the endelesse sothefastnesse / upon the foresaid state of teres (said) as
though she had be all rapte i^ love to endeles god thus. I thank the
endeles sovereign fader / satysfyer of holy desires / and lover of our helthes
(that for love) thou showed to us love by mean and medyacyon of thy holy sone
Ihesu christ / when we were agynst the in war and battle / by our sinful
living. For this great depenesse of charity / enflammed by grace and mercy / I
ask that I may purely come to the / with light and not with derkenesse / and
that I may run by the doctrine of the sothefastnes / of ye which doctrine /
it has pleased yt to show to me clerly ye truth. And yet I beseech the
endeles fader that thou declare to me openly other things. I would endelesse
fader or that I pass out of these states / that these two were declared to me.
One is that if any of thy servants ask counsel of me / in what wise he
may best plese yt and serve the / what doctrine shall I give hy^. I know right
well endelesse fader thou art he which delytes yt in few words / but all thy
delight is in many good works. Nevertheless if it like thy goodness / of an other
thing also would I pray the / and it is this / if otherwhyle I pray for thy
creatures / and special for thy servants / in ye which prayer I find one
dysposed in soul for to serve the and has great joy in thy service / and
that other I fy^de that he has a soul wrapped in derkenes / whether I should
endeles fader or ought to deem that one in light / and that other in
derkenesse / or if I se one doing great penance / and an other none /
whether I should deem him yt does great penance in greater parfeccyo^ / than
him yt does none / I pray the endeles fader suffer me not be dysceyued of my
little light. And also I beseech ye for to declare to me in special / the token
which a soul receives / when she is vysyted of the / and how it shall be
know / whether it be of the endelesse fader or not. In this matter endelesse
fader I have good mind that thou said / a soul when it is vysyted of the /
it is bylefte in great joy and fervent might / to all true pease and unity.
Nevertheless yet would I know / if that joy might be without any manner
dysceyte of our own spyrytuall passions / for if it were so I would only
behold to the token of virtue. These they be endelesse fader the which I ask
of the / that I may serve the and my neighbor in true living / and that I
fall not in to no false Judgments / upon thy creatures and servants / in to
the which inco^uenyence / I would in no wise fall. How the light of reason is
necessary to a soul / yt will serve god in sothefastnes and truth of a
general light. THa^ endeles god had right great delight of the health / and
hongre of that devout soul and of her purete / and also of her great desire
yt she did ask for to serve hy^. Therefore he turned the eye of his pity and
mercy to her / and said thus. O right dear / o right sweet / o right well
byloued daughter and spouse / lift up thyselfe above thyselfe / and open the
eye of thy intelleccyon for to se me endeles goodness / and the vnspectable
love that I have to the / and all my dear servants / and open the ere of thy
desyrable feeling / for and thou did not se / thou might not here. As thus /
if a soul do not se with ye eye of intelleccyon / ye clear syghte of my truth
/ she may another here nor yet know my very sothfastnes. And if thou will know
it verily / I will thou lift up thy self above thy feeling (yt is above thy
sencyble wits) and I shall than satysfy the of thy asky^ge / not because that
delight might increase in me by you / for I am he that am / and he that makes
you encrese / and not you me. But I delight in my own delectacyo^ / of my
making. Than when that soul did obey / lyftynge up herself above herself /
for to know ye truth of her petycyon. The almighty and endelesses god said
tha^ to her thus. Daughter that thou may ye better understood what I say / I
shall begin at the beginning of thy petycyon / upon the lyghtes which come
out of my very light. One is a general light / to all such that be in comune
charity / though I have told ye of diverse lyghtes / and much yt I have said
I shall reherce again / that thy feeble itelleccyon may the better understand
yt thou desires. Two other lyghtes be of them that be departed fro the world /
and have found parfeccyon / and upon this I shall declare to the of that
thing the which you does ask me / more specially to be declared / that was
first touched in comune. Thou knows well what I have said / that without
light of reason / may no man go by yt way of truth / the which light of
reason ye take of me that am very light / with the eye of intelleccyon and
light of feythe / the which I took you i^ holy baptym / and the form of
feythe ye did receive by mean and medyacyon and virtue of the blood of my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu. The which seythe excercyseth in virtues with light of
reason / the which reason illumyned of this special light (ye which I speak
of) gives you light and makes you to go by the way of truth / and with that
same light ye should come to me / yt am very endelesse light / and with out
that light ye may not come to me yt am light / but rather to derkenes. These
two lyghtes ye which be dependaunte fro this light / be full necessary for you
to have / and in these two I shall give the ye third. The first is / that all
ye be ylluniyned / in knowing of worldely transytory things / ye which
ouerpasse as wy^de / but ye may not well know them / unto the time ye know
first your own freylte / how slypper it is under a co^trarius law / the
which law is bound in your bodyly lymines / rebellynge to me yt am your
maker. Nevertheless there is none constrained by that law for to do yt leest
sin / but if he will / and yet it impugneth against the spyryte / and I gave
never that law yt my reasonable creature should be overcome thereby / but
rather it should be increased in virtue / and be preued in ye soul by virtue /
for virtue is never preued but by the contrary. The sensualyte is ever contrary
to yt spyryte / and therefore i^ that sensualyte / a soul proves ye love that
it has in me her maker. When proves she that? Certain when with hate and
dysplesaunce she aryseth against the sensualyte / and also I have given to her
such a law contrary to ye spyryte / that she should be kept in very
meekness / for thou sees well that in making of a soul to the image and
likeness of me / set in so great a dygnyte / I have felyshypped her with a
thing of right little valewe / that is given to her by a contrary law /
byndynge the same law with yt body yt is made of a right foul earth. That i^
beholdy^ge of such fylthe / she should not lyftup her heed against me by
pride. And therefore a frail body that has this light which I speak of /
has cause for to love her / and not for to enhaunse her by pride / for thereof
has she no matter / but rather matter of very perfyte meekness. Also this
contrary law constreyneth never a creature to sin by no manner inpugnacyon
that it shows / but rather it gives cause for to make you ye better to know
the unstableness of this wretched world. This should se an eye of intellecyon /
with the light of very feythe / the which I said to the before / is named the
ball of ye eye. This is that necessary light / the which generally is
necessary to every creature that has reason / and desires to take part of
the life of grace / in what ever state that ever he stondeth in / if he will
receive the fruit of the blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu. This is a
comune light / that is that every parsone should have comunely (as it is
rehearsed before) and he that has it not / he dwells in state of dampnacyo^
/ and this is the cause why yt all those that have not this light be not in ye
state of grace / for by wa^ty^ge of this light / they may not know ye
wickedness of sin / nor that yt thing which is cause of syn^e. And
therefore it may not eschew offense / nor hate wicked lyuy^ge. In ye same wise
/ he that knows no good nor cause of good that is virtue / he may never love
me nor desire me yt am endeles good / nor he may not know the virtue which I
give as an instrument and mean for to come to ye grace of very good. By this
thou may se how necessary this light is to you for your sins stonden in no
other thing / but in leuy^ge that I hate / and in hau^ty^ge that I love / I
love virtue and hate vice / he that loves vice and hates virtue offends me /
and is depryued fro my grace Such one gothe forth as a very blind man / not
knowing the cause of sin / which is his propre sencyble love / and yet he
has it not / nor he knows not vices nor the evil yt follows vices / nor he
knows not virtue / nor me that grau^teth him virtue / ye which virtue gives
him life / nor also ye worthy dygnyte of virtue / by the which he is conserved
fro vices / and comes to grace. Thus thou may se that he that knows not /
is cause of his own evil / therefore as I said / this light is very necessary
to you.

And now mother and systren I have made an end of the.iiii. book / ye which
does speak for the most part of prayers and teres. And first how god shows
a doctrine of the sacrament of ye auter / as it is rehearsed i^ the beginning
of the fourth book / now fynyshed / with diverse matters.

The fyfth book.
Quinta The first chapter of ye fyfth perty speaks of mortyfycacyo^ and first
of them that put their desire more to suffer bodyly pain / than in
mortyfycacyon or dystroyenge of their own will / which is one parfyte light
or light of perfeccyo^ / more tha^ the general light / and it is the second
light of parfeccyo^.
Also of ye third and more parfyte light of reason / and of the works yt a
soul does wha^ it is come to that state / and of many matters and diverse / as
it is rehearsed and showed to the before in the calendar. Ca. i.


AFter time yt a soul is come and has gotten this general light (as I have
rehearsed before) she should not hold her apayde without more / for the while
ye be in this life as pilgrims / ye be able for to receive more and for to
encrese not forthwarde / ye decrese goy^ge backewarde. Other they should
encrese in the comune light that they have gote^ by mean and medyacyon of my
grace / orelles they sholden enforce them with all business for to come to the
secunde parfyte light / and so fro the vnparfyte / for to come to ye parfyte /
for without light / may none come to parfeccyon. In this second parfyte light
be two manners of parfeccyo^ / they be parfyte / which be risen fro the comune
living of the world. In this parfeccyon be two things (one is) there be some
that parfytely chatyse their bodies with right great penance (and the cause is)
that their sensualyte should not rebel against reason / such have set all
their desire rather in mortyfyenge of ye body / than in dystroyenge of their
own propre will / as I have told the i^ an other place. Al such sede the^ at
the table of penance / and they be good and parfyte / if their purpose were
found in me with ye light of dyscrecyon / that is with very dyscrecyon of the^
and of me. And also that al those were conformed to me with great meekness /
as Judges of my will / and not of the will of men / if they be in no wise so
conformed and arrayed in my will with very meekness / often times they should
offend their parfeccyon / demynge other yt gone not by ye same way of penance
/ as they done. Does thou not know why that to all such this happeth?
Certeynly by cause they have put rather their be synes and desire in
mortyfyenge of their propre will. All such will ever those times and places
and ghostly comfortes i^ their own wise / and also trybulacyons of the world
and batayles of fendes / as it is rehearsed in ye secunde vnparfyte estate
before. All such that be so dysceyued of their own will (say thus) I would
ever have such comfortes / and not such heaviness and temptacyon of fendes /
I say not this for my ease / but because I would ye better please god / and
because I would ever have him in my soul / by gracyous comfortable fely^ge /
for better me seems it were to have him so / and for to serve him in such
wise / than with temptacyons and batales of fendes / and so in this wise such
one falls in to pain and tedyosyte / and is made vnparfyte to himself / and
so is parfyte state offended / and he consydereth not nor will not know / and
there lies the fylthe of pride / and he himself lies therein / for if he lay
not therein / he should be very meke and not presumptuous / and if he were out
of the fylthe of pride / he should think with that light (that is rehearsed
before) that I the first and most swetest truth / grant and give / state /
time / and place / comfortes / and trybulacyons (as it is rehearsed necessary
for your health) and for to fulfill parfeccyon in the soul / to ye which
perfeccyon / I have chosen ye soul before / and than should he se that I
grant all things for love. And therefore with love and reverence / be should
receive all things that I send / as the seeside and ye third state of
perfeccyon down / of whom I shall tell the. For they be two states that abide
and dwell in this most parfyte light. Of ye third and most parfyte light of
reason / and of the works that a soul does wha^ she is come to that estate /
and how I showed there a fair vysyon which this soul had / in ye which
vysyon / is showed fully of ye manner of coming to parfyte purete and cle^nes
of ye soul. ALl such both the second and the third after they be come to
this glorious light / they be in every state perarfyte yt they stonden in. And
what that ever I suffer them to have / they hold it and keep it in dew
reverence / as it is made mencyon before in the third vnytyue state. All such
hold the^ self worthy peynes and sclaunders of the world / and desyren to be
pryued fro their own ghostly comfortes / what comfort that it be / and as
they hold them worthy peynes / so they hold themself unworthy ghostly fruit
or comfort. In ye light ^ they have known and tasted my end less will / the
which will it none other thing / but only your goodness / and that ye made
holy in me. And therefore I give you and suffer you to have such things. After
time ye the soul knew ye will of me / she arrayed her with the same will / and
took heve to none other thing / but for to asspy how she might encrese and
keep the state of parfeccyon / for joy and preysynge of my holy name /
opening her eye of intelleccyon with light of feythe in the clear syghte of
my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / louy^ge and following his
doctrine / ye which is the way both to them that be parfyte / and to them
that he vnparfyte / and so she says yt the lovely lamb / that is my
endelesse sothefast sone gives to her life of parfeccyon / in the sight thereof
/ she herself is rapte with love. This parfeccyon is nothing else but this /
that by such she knows my only sone Ihesu christ / the which noryshed
himself at the table of holy desire / seeking the worship of me endeles fader
/ and health of your souls / and with this desire he came with great haste to
his passion of the cross / the which was yt most horrible death that ever was
/ where he fulfilled his obedyence that was put to him of me yt am his endeles
fader / never eschewynge labors / nor repreues for your sake / nor
withdrawynge never himself for no unkindness that he saw in you / nor for no
manner of ygnoraunce that was in you / that is for none vnknowy^ge of his
benefytes that he gave to you / nor for no parsecucyon of ye Jews / nor for
illusyo^s / repreues / and grutchy^ges and cryenges of the people / but all
this he suffered and ouerpassed / as a very knight / and your capytayne that
put himself so to battle for to fight i^ the field / that ye should be
delivered fro the fendes hondes / and that ye should be fre and out of ye
fendes bondage or danger / ye which ye should have be in / if he had not
foughten for you / and also for to teache you his way / rule / and doctrine /
yt ye might come to me ye gate of endeles life with the keye of his precious
blood / shed with the fire of right great fervent love / and with great hate
and dysplesaunce of your sins / as though my only sothefast sone and lamb
Ihesu christ crucyfyed myghtsay thus to you. Lo I have made away to you and
opened the gate with my blood. Be not therefore neclygent to follow that way /
so to rest only upon your own propre love / and by ygnoraunce not for to
know that way / but rather desiring for to serve me presumptuously after
your own styrrynge and feeling / tha^ after my styrrynge and grace / ye which
have made to you a right way by medyacyon and mean of my sothefast truth /
that is of my only sothefast sone incarnate expressed plainly by shedy^ge of
his precious blood. Arise you therefore and follow him / orelles in no wise ye
may come to me the fader / but by him. He it is that is both way and gate /
by the which ye must enter to me / that am the peaseble see. Tha^ when this
soul comes for to taste that light / because she saw it and knew it /
therefore she ran as she had be all rapte in love to the table of holy desire
/ and she might in no wise se herself / for she herself that is another
seky^ge in herself another temporal comfort nor spyrytuall comfort / but she
was as a p^rsone yt had in all things slain her own propre will / she
eschewed no manner of labor in what wise that ever it was put to her / but
rather she ete with great compassyon and sorrow meet of me endelesse god and
health of souls upon the table of the cross / suffrynge repreues / iniuryes /
and heaviness of the fend / and many gronynges and grutchynges of me^. And she
looked after no reward another of me nor of other creatures / for she was
spoiled fro the love of any mede / in asmoche as she did love me without
consyderacyon of any reward. Thus she was arrayed with this parfyte and most
pure light / loving me purely without any reward / but only to the glory
and praysynge to my name / not serving me by her own propre delectacyon / nor
her neighbor / for her own profit / but for the very pure love of me. Al
such have lost themself / for they have done away the old conuersacyon of
man / that is their own propre sensualyte / and they be arrayed with a new
conuersacyon / yt is my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ my endelesse and
sothefaste truth / suynge him myghtely. These they be that set them at the
table of holy desire and be more besy in dystroyenge and mortyfyenge ^ their
own wylles / tha^ in mortyfyenge of their flesh. And they have mortyfyed
well enough their own flesh / not pryncypally for the chief affection / but
as a very instrument that is for to help and slay the propre sencyble will (as
it is reherced before) where that I declared to the in that word (where I
said thus) that my delight it was in few words / and in many good works. And
this ye should do / for the pryncypall affection should be for to slay ye
propre will / the which affection none other seeks nor desires other thing
than for to follow my ownely sothefast sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / i^ hy^
seeking and fyndy^ge the glory and worship of my name / and health of souls.
They that be in this glorious light / so they do / and therefore they live ever
in peace and quietness of conscience / for there is nothing may hurt it nor
sclaundre it / in asmoche as they have withdrawn fro them that thing that
hurt it and sclau^dred it / yt is their own propre will. And all manner
persecucyo^s yt ye world or the fend may do to the^ they put all under their
fete. And yet they stand in the water of trybulacyons and temptacyons / which
do to them no disease / because they stand bound to ye beam of fervent
desire / such do joy in all things / and they be no Judges / another of my
servants / nor of my other reasonable creatures / but they be glad of every
state that they se / saying to me thus. O endeles fader tha^kynge be to the /
for in thy house be many dwelling places / and yet they be more glad of diverse
states that they se / tha^ if they se thy dwelling places / all they do keep
one way of lyuy^ge / for i^ many states of lyuy^ge / they se ye magnyfysence
of my goodness spread abroad / of al therefore they be joyful. And they will i^ no
wise give no Judgments / nor deem another them that be good / nor them that by
evil and done open sin / but rather with a manner of very holy co^passyon /
prayenge to me for them / and with parfyte meekness say thus. To day thou /
to morrow I / but if the grace of god do keep me. O right well byloued
daughter be you joyful therefore of this right sweet excellent state / and
behold how they run in this glorious light / and se their excellence and
worthynes / for they have their minds full set to me / and ete at the table of
holy desire / and with light they come to noryshe themself of ye meet of
souls / for the honor and worship of me endelesse fader / arrayed with the
sweet clothe of my only sothefast sone that blessed lamb / that is with his
bre^nynge charity. All such do never lose their time / in gyuynge of false
Judgments / never against my servants / nor against the servants of the
world / and they never hurt nor sclaundre themself / for no manner grutchynge
done against the^ or against other / for if it be done against themself /
they be well apayde to suffer it for my name / and if it be against other /
they bear it easily with them yt suffers / and never grutchynge against him
that does it / nor against him yt receives it. For the love of such is
ordynate in me endeles god / and also in their neighbor and never vnordynately
set. All such dear daughter conceive never sclaundre / against the^ whom
they love / nor against none other reasonable creatures / for their sight i^
such things is deed and not quycke / and therefore they will not have to do
with the Judgments of the wylles of men / but only of the will of my
myldenes. All such also keep the doctrine that thou knows well that was given
to the of my sothefastnesse / in the beginning of thy life / when thou asked
with a great desire for to have a will to come to parfyte purete / thinking
tha^ how you might come thereto. I know well than was given to the an answer /
while thou did sleep upon ye holy desire / not only i^ thy soul / but in the
sown of thy ere / a voice fro god spoke to the. For if thou remember the well
/ thou was tha^ turned than to thy sencyble wits of ye body / wha^ my only
sothefast sone Ihesu spoke to the / saying thus. If thou will come to parfyte
purete and be depryued fro sclaunders / yt is yt thy soul for nothing shall
be sclau^dred. Do so that than thou may always live in affection and desire of
love / for I am most sovereign and endelesse purete / and also I am that fire
that puryfyeth the soul. And therefore ye more yt a soul draws and cleueth
to me / the more purer it is / and the forther that it gothe out fro me / the
more unclean it is. And ye cause why that deedly wa^tayne me^ fall in to so
many lyuynges of wickedness / is for they be departed fro me. But ye soul
without yt any mean oneth her to me / she takes part of my purete. Also thou
must do an other thing that thou may come to this union of purete / that is
that thou Judge never in any parsone / that you thou sees the^ do or say /
whether it be against ye or agay^st other / after the will of any man / but
after my will / both in them and in the. And thus if you se a sin or a
defaute in the^ / draw out of ye thornela roof / that is that thou offer that
defaute before me with holy compassyon / and of the wro^ges which be done to
the / Judge that my will does fuffre them to be done in the / that virtue may
be proved in the and in other of my servants / demynge that he that does
this to the or to them / is as an instrument send of me / seeing rather i^
them a good intent tha^ an ill intent. For there is none cau Judge truly the
pryuyte of man's heart / and that thing that thou sees not expressly evil and
openly deedly sin / thou shall not judge it in thy soul / but only judge
that my will suffers many things in them. And if thou se any open express
sin in them / yet as I have said / Judge them not / but offer it before me
with holy compassyon. In this wise you may come to parfyte purete / for if thou
do so / thy soul shall not be sclaundred / another in me nor in thy neighbor.
For all the indygnacyon that falls ymonges neighbors / is because of
Judgments / the which indygnacyo^ and sclau^der departs a soul fro me and
lets parfeccyon / and in some things they wtdrawe grace more or less after
ye gretenes of indygnacyon / and has conceived it in ye neighbor of such
Judgments. The co^trari receives a soul yt demeth ever after my will (as I
have said before) the which will will nothing else but your good and
profit / and what that ever I suffer or give / I do it for the end that ye
should ever set your intent to that end that it is made to / for aslonge as
it stondeth in the love of neyghbourheed / solonge it stondeth in my love / and
so abiding in that that abides in me and is oned to me. And therefore it is
full needful to the / that desires for to come to that purete which thou does
ask of me for to do these three pryncypall things. One is that thou give the
to me by affection of love / for the meruaylous love that I have to the / and
to all creatures. Another is that thou Judge not in the will of another man /
my will. And ye third is that thou give no Judgments of thy own wit /
that my will should be thy will / for I am ye Judge / and not thou. And if thou
keep these pryncypall things / all parfeccyon shall fall to the. This was ye
same doctrine if thou remember yt that was taught to the of my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu christ. Now therefore dear daughter I say to ye that all
such (as it is rehearsed before) the which have learned this wholesome doctrine
and excercysed it / they taste ernest of endelesse bliss in this life. And
therefore if you keep well this doctrine in thy soul / thou shall not fall in to
temptacyon of ye fend / though thou be tempted with him. Nevertheless yet for
to satysfy more clearly thy desire / I shall tell the and declare to ye more
openly / that there should no Judgment of such parfyte souls be used / without
manner but holy co^passyon. By what manner wise they receive the ernest of
sykernesse of everlasting life / such as abide i^ the third light / which
is most parfyte light. ANd why said I to the / that al such receive the
ernest or sykernes of euerlasty^ge life / I shall say to the. They receive
sykernesse / but no deperty^ge fro ye body / for they receive it i^ abydy^ge in
the body of me yt am life everlasting / in such a place where life is without
death / and fullness without need / and hongre without pain / for pain there is
fer fro hongre / because they have yt they desire / and there also is need fer
fro fullness / for I am to them meet of life without defaute. Nevertheless yet i^
this life it is so yt they receive sykernesse and the ernest of bliss / and
they taste it in this wise / that is the soul begy^neth to ho^gre / ye worship
of me endeles good / and also ye meet of health of souls. And like as ye soul
hongreth / so it is fed / that is right as a soul is noryshed by charity of
neyghbourheed / of whom it has desire and hongre the which is to hy^ a meet
of ye which it is noryshed / and never fulfilled because it is insatiable /
therefore his ho^gre is co^tynuall / and right as ye ernest is a begy^nynge of
sykernes yt is give to man / of ye which it desires to have deperty^ge fro ye
body / not yt I say yt / yt ernest is perfyte i^ it self / but it gives
sykernes by feythe to come to ye fullness thereof / and to receive departy^ge of
the body / but such a soul so rapt in love / and arrayed with ye doctrine of
my sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / the which soul has received ernest in her
life of my charity / and of charity of neyghbourheed is not yet parfyte in
herself / for she abides parfeccyon of life that is endelesse. Therefore it is
that I said / that this ernest or sykernesse is not yet parfyte / for the
soul that tastes it / has yet no parfeccyon / but always it feleth peynes /
both in herself and i^ other. In herself she feleth peynes / of the
trespaces that she does to me by the contrary law / that is within her bownde
in her body / for it will ever impungne and fight against the spyryte / in
earth she feleth peynes of trespaces done to me by her neighbors. Nevertheless
yet they have parfeccyon to grace / all be it they have not yet parfeccyon of
my seyntes / ye which become to me that am endelesse life. For as it is said
before / their desires be with peynes. And therefore these yt ben my servants
the which do noryshe themself at the table of holy desire / they be both
holy / blessed / and sorrowful / as my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ stood
upon the cross / for his flesh was so sorrowful which suffered tourment /
but his soul was blessed and holy / by the union of divine nature. In ye same
wise all such be blessed / by union of holy desire of them in me / arrayed with
my right holy will. And they ben sorrowful by compassyon of neyghbourheed /
and also they be sorrowful and peynful in tourme^ty^ge of their own propre
sensualyte / the which may not be done without pain / in with drawing of
delytes and sencyble comfortes. How our neighbor shall be lift up that he
fall not in to a false Judgment. Now dear daughter take thou head of a more
open declaracyon of that thing that thou does ask me. I told the of a comune
light / yt all ye should have in what state that ever be / and namely of them
that dwell in comune charity. And also I told the of them that be in parfyte
light / the which light I dystyngued in two manners that is of them that were
departed fro the world / and besyed them to mortyfye their bodies / and of
them yt mortyfy and destroy their own propre wylles / and these were those
perfyte folk (as I told yt) ye which do noryshe themself at the table of
holy desire. Now therefore I speak to the in special / and by the to all in
general in satysfaccyo^ o^ thy desire I will that thou know and use three
synguler things / ye ignorance let not thy parfeccyon (to ye which I call
the) and that the fend under a ma^tel of virtue / noryshe not in thy soul the
root of presumpcyon / for thereby thou should fall i^ to fulse and vnryghtwyse
Judgments / ye which I have forbode ye / you should tha^ seem that you demes
truly / and yet you should by such presu^pcyo^ deem falsely showing after thy
own feeling. And often times the wicked spyryte should make the to se many and
strange dyuersytes / and all for to bring the in to lesynges / and that would
he do to make the a demer of hertes / and of inward things of reasonable
creatures / the which Judgments as I have said to the / be only reserved
to me. This is one of the three things that I would thou had and did use / that
is that thou give no Judgments without a manner / but I will that thou give
the^ with a manner. The manner of Judgments is this / but if I expressly not
ones or twyse / but often times make open to the defautes of thy neighbor in
thy soul / thou shall never tell it specially to him that thou semes thou
should deem / but you should in general correcke his defautes / if he come to
the and plant virtue charitably with benyngenyte / and other while show
sharpenes if it be need And if it were told to the often times defautes of
other / but if it were opynly showed to the i^ thy soul (as I have said) thou
shall not tell it them in special / but rather take a sure way for to fle the
dysceyte and malice of the fend / for with yt hoke he would take the if he
might / for to make ye often times to deem in thy neighbor that thing that is
not / and so should thou often times slaundre him. Therefore for ye surer party
keep scylence / or if you should speak speak holyly of virtue in oyspysynge of
vices / and in such speaking / the vice that thou semes should be in another /
hold thyselfe gylty of the same with him / yt the seems should be gylty /
ever using very mekenes and if in sothe it were so that such a vice were in
such a parsone / he should rather amend him / considering himself so
swetele cou^seyled there fro / and so he shall be constreyned charitably to
amend his defautes / and than shall he tell the / that thou would tell him.
Stand thou therefore sure / and so shall thou avoid and bow away fro the
deuylles wylles / that he shall in no wise dysceyue the nor let the parfeccyon
of thy soul. I will also that thou know that in no wise thou trust in all thy
conceytes after thy semynge / but cast them behy^de the and regard them not /
and only abide in ye knowledge of thyselfe / and so in the know my largeness
/ and my endelesse goodness / right so do they that be come to the last state
of parfeccyon / for ever they turn again to ye valaye of their own knowledge
/ and yet let they not the union nor the hyghnes that they have in me / and so
this is one of those three things yt I said I would that thou should use /
that thou might serve me in very sothefastnesse. If a man pray for a parsone /
and god shows in the soul of him that thou prays / yt same soul is full of
derkenes for whom he prays / yet it shall not be Judged amys NOw shall I tell
the of the secunde (that is to say) that if otherwhyle it should happethe that
thou should pray specially for any creatures / and in such prayers the seems
in him yt thou prays fore is light of grace / and in another not so / and
both ben my servants / but it should seem to the that the one were in
derkenes of soul / and that other in lyghtnesse of grace / thou would know
whether thou should Judge him i^ derkenes that the seems is in derkenesse / or
not? I say thou should not therefore Judge him in defaute of great sins / for
often times so thy Judgments should be false. And I would yt thou should know
yt other while it happeth that when thou prays me for one person / ye same
perpsone shall seem sometime to ye that he is so full of light and holy desire
before me / in somoche that of his vextuous living / thy soul is so yllumyned
after affection of charity / that each of you shall comune homely your virtues
together. And otherwhyle yt shall seem that his soul is fer fro me and all full
of derkenesse and heaviness / in somoche that to the it shall seem full heavy
for to pray / for him to me. This sometime happeth for the defaute that is in
hy^ / for whom thou prays / and often times it is not for defaute of him / but
rather for with drawing of me fro him / yt I endelesse god show in such a
soul / the which often times I do / because yt such a soul should draw
quyckly to parfeccyon / as I have told yt before in the states of the soul /
I wtdrawe me fro them by feeling / and not by grace / that it but only fro
feeling of comfortes and sweetness / and therefore such a barayne soul is
belefte dry and peynfull / ye which pain I make such a soul to feel that
prays for hy^. This I do of grace and for love that I have to such a soul
yt prays / for such folk that she should help by prayer to put away that
cloud from him that she prays for. And thus you may know dear daughter
how great offense it were for to deem such a man vycyous / in whom no vice
were / though he seemed to the derke / where also thou may know yt he is not
depryued fro grace / but fro feeling of sweetness the which he had of me. I
will also if thou should be of will / both thou and all my other servants /
yt ye know perfytely yourselfe / by ye which know lege ye may come
parfytely to my endeles goodness / and reserueth to me both this and other
manner of Judgments / for to me it longs / and for saketh the Judgment that
lo^geth to me / and take upon you compassyon with ho^gre of the honor of me /
and health of souls / and with love longing desire / shows and tells
virtue / and repreueth vices in you and in them / in the manner that it is said
before. In such manner you may in sothe come to me / and so shall thou well
show that thou hase kept in thy soul ye doctrine that was given to the of my
sothefast sone Ihesu christ yt is for to Judge my will / and not the will of
men. Thus should you do / if thou will have purely virtue / and stand in the
last / most glorious / and most parfyte light / fedynge thyselfe at the table
of holy desire / with ye meet of he^the of souls / to ye glory and praysynge
of my holy name. How bodyly penance shall not be take for a pry^cypall
fou^dament nor for a pryncypall desire / but ye desire and love of virtues
shall betake for a pry^cypall fou^dame^t. I Have said to ye dear dougeter of
two things that you should use / now shall I tell the of the third / to the
which I will that thou take right good heed / and repreue and withdraw
thyselfe therfro. If otherwhyle ye fe^de / or thy own co^ceyte have envy at
the somoche / yt they would stir the for to aspy / and se where all my
servants to go by the same way yt thou goes i^ or would go in / you might
well know that it were a dysceyte / for it is against the doctrine which is
given to the by my sothefastnesse. For often times it happeth ye you should se
many creatures walk by ye way of right great penance / and to some it were
right heavy for to se them walk yt way / for as they seem they do not well.
Sees thou not how al such be dysceyued / will thou se howmoche? Certain it is
sometime that such one so lyuy^ge in great penance / does better tha^ he
that seems he does amysse / for he does more penance and also is more
virtuous / than he that grutcheth of him / and therefore I said to the before /
that they the which feden them at the table of penance / if they do it with
very meekness and that they set not such peynfull living in penance for
theye pryncypall affection / but for an instrument of virtue / often times such
grutchynge turns them in to great parfeccyon / and therefore they should not
be vncu^nynge / but know wisely that parfeccyon stondeth not only in
mortyfycacyo^ of the body / but in destroyenge and mortyfyenge of the propre
wicked will. This is the doctrine of light coming and procedynge of that
glorious light wherein a soul renneth in rapte in love / and is arrayed with my
truth. I despise not therefore penance / for penance is good to mortyfy ye
body / ye which will strive against the spyryte. But I will therefore dear
daughter that thou know this for a general rule / that some in doing of
penance / be more myghtyer of kind than some / and therefore they may suffer
the more and please god right virtuously / if it be done (as it is said
before) and also some it happeth that penance which is begon^e must sometime
beleft for many causes that may betyde / orelles the foundament which is set
in yt and in other of my servants should defayle / for such penance
excercysed / and so should the foundame^t be vnparfyte / and you both ghostly
comfort should defayle / and also virtue of the soul. And where that ye be so
depryued of such thing that ye love by such synguler affeccyo^s by doing of
penance / it should seem to you that ye were depryued fro me and so should ye
come to great heaviness and bytternesse and confusyon. And also in such a
wise ye should lose ye excercyses of devotion and fervent prayer / the which
ye were wont to have / to some yt have long used this penance. This sodeyne
chaungynge should turn them to great heaviness / so for to leave yt they have
so long used / why it is that trowes thou? Certeynly for the ground work or
fundacyon was set in affection for to do penance / and not in love lo^gynge
desire. Therefore where penance is used / as it is to me plesaunte that it be
used / it must be set on a good ground. Thus thou may se that there should
be no grutchynge against none of my servants yt done penance / though it
seems to you they gone not in the same way that ye gone in. For I will be
served of infynyte goods / yt am endelesse and infynyte good / and ymonge al
other mortyfycacyo^ it is good to dystroye evermore and mortyfy ye propre will
and than with that will so made subject to my will / ye should yield to me sweet
hongre and infynyte desire / seeking the worship and honor of me / and health
of souls / and so should ye noryshe and feed youreselfe at the table of desire
/ the which desire is never sclaundred / another i^ himself that has it /
nor in his neighbor / but it is joyful of all states / and it draws out
fruit of every diverse manners of living that I give to diverse souls. Thus
wretches done not / the which do not follow this sweet doctrine / and the
right way given of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / but they do the
contrary / and deem after their own bly^de couetyse / and therefore they do
walk as wode men / and depryuen themself fro the good of charity of heavenly
virtues (and as I have said before) they taste in this life the ernest of
hell. A short repetycyo^ of words yt be said before / with an addycyo^ of the
love of our neighbor. LO dear daughter thus have I satysfyed to thy desire /
and I have declared to the of ye thing that thou did ask of me / that is how
you should love thy neighbor that you be not dysceyued of ye fe^de / nor of thy
own conceyte. And there I said to ye that thou should love him generally and
not specially / where that thou had it by special showing of me in thy soul
of his sins / and than I told the that with meekness and in the manner as I
told ye / thou should repreue i^ love both thy neighbor and thyselfe. Also I
said and yet I say that in nowyse thou Judge any creature / another generally
nor specially / nor the souls of my servants / whether thou find them
dysposed or not / and there I told the the cause why thou should not Judge /
for if thou did give Judgment / thou should be dysceyued in thy own conceyte.
But you should have compassyon both thou and al my other servants / and
commyt Judgments to me. I taught the also a doctrine / as for a pryncypall
fou^dament how thou should behave the to them that do come to yt for to ask
counseyle / of such namely that were in purpose for to have gone out of the
way of derkenesse of deedly sin / and follow ye way of virtue. That is that
thou give to them in ye way of counsel ye pryncypall foundament / that they
set their affection and love in virtue and in knowledge of themself and of my
goodness in them / and that they flee and forsake fully their own propre wylles
/ that in no wise that they be rebel to me. And counseyle them to do penance
/ and that they take it as for an instrument / and not for a pryncypall
affection (as it is rehearsed before) not to each like / but as they be able for
to bear and after their might and state / to some less and to some much as
they may. And because I said to the / that vndertaky^ge was not lefull to ye
for to use it but in general (after ye manner as I have told ye) yet I would
not that thou should suppose / that if thou saw him sin deedly / that you
might not correcke him charitably between the and him / suppose not that / for
so thou may not do / and also if he were obstynate / and would not correcke
and amend him / thou may than tell his sin that thou hase seen to two or
three / and if that profit nor / thou may tell it to the mystery all body of
your mother holy church. But I told the that it was not fefull to ye after
thy fely^ge within thy soul / nor after thy outward feeling / lightly to
stir thyself to undertake hy^ / but if you know verily ye truth / orelles
that you have in thy soul by express reuelacyon / yt you should undertake hy^
under such a form as I have told ye. For that I told the is the surer
party / in the which ye wicked fend may not dysceyue the under the mantell
of the parfyte charity of thy neighbor.

The secu^de chapyter is of tokens to know vysytacyons or ghostly vysyons /
whether they come of god or of ye fend. Also how god is the fulfyller of holy
desires of his servants. And how it pleases god much when a man axeth and
prays with parseuerau^ce / and knocks at ye gate of his sothefastnes / and
of other matters / as it is showed before in the calendar. Ca. ii.
I Have fulfilled here dear daughter to the now and declared that that is
spedefull to co^serue and encrese parfeccyon i^ thy soul. Now therefore I shall
declare that that you asks of me by what toke^ you should know when a soul
receives my vysytacyon / whether it were of vysyons / or of other ghostly
comfortes / where I showed the tokens / how you should know whether it were of
me or not. And it was this token / gladness yt be left after vysyons in a soul
/ and hongre of virtue / and namely when it were oned with the very virtue of
meekness / and also brenned with the fire of charity. But because thou asks me
whether in such gladness may be received any dysceyte of ye fe^de / for if
thou kewe it / thou would cleue to the surer party. Therefore I shall tell the
the dysceyte yt may be received in such gladness / and how thou shall know
when gladness is very true / and when it is not true. Dysceyte may be received
in this wise / I will you thou know that what manner thing a reasonable
creature loves or desires to have / after time he has it / he has it i^
hate. And ye more he loves that he has / the less he sees therein / and the
more vncunnynge he is for to know with prudence whens it comes that he has
/ and that is for the love that he has in that comfort / for the joy in ye
receyuynge of that thing that he loves will not suffer him for to se it / nor
he repents not though he never se it. In the same wise / they that delight
the^ much and love mental comfort / they seek after vysyons / and they set
more their pryncypall affection in delight of comfort / tha^ pryncypally in me
/ as I have said to the before. And of all such namely that be yet in the
state of imparfeccyon the which rather beholden to the gift of comfortes that
I give them tha^ to affection of my charity / which I give them more
specially. In this they may receive dysceytes / how they be dysceyued I shall
tell the. After time such have conceived a great love i^ receyuy^ge of ghostly
co^fortes or vysyons / i^ what wise that ever they come they feel a joy / for
they have ye thing which they love and desire / and this may come of the
fend / for though it come with gladness / yet it ends with pain and pryckynge
of conscience / and void fro ye desire of virtue. For if such gladness be
found without seruet desire of virtue and very meekness / brenned in ye oven
of my dyuyne charity / that vysytacyo^ / comfort / and vysyon / that such a
soul receives is of the fend and not of me / though she feel a token of
gladness / but because gladness is not oned with affection of love (as it is
said) you may openly know that such gladness is of her own propre
delectacyon / and that is the cause of her joy / because that ^he has that
she desires / for ye condycyon of love is this / for to love that joy that it
feleth. Therefore thou may not trust i^ joy alone / though it seem ye enough
in receyuynge of such ghostly comfortes / for an vncunnynge love in such joy
may lightly be dysceyued of ye fend / if it have none other prudence. And if
it be wtyse / it shall se a token without dysceyte of the fend / that is if
it walk with affeccyo^ of virtue / or not. This is a very showing toke^ for to
know wha^ it is dysceyte / and when not. In the same wise it is of the
gladness that you receyues in thy soul of me / and of that gladness which
thou receyues in ye soul of thy own propre spyrytuall delectacyon. For ye
gladness the which is of me / is oned to affection of virtue / and that
gladness the which does come of the fend / is but gladness alone without
following of any virtue / for asmoche virtue he feleth wha^ it is gone as he did
at the beginning. An such gladness comes of the love that they have in the
ghostly comfort / as it is rehearsed before. I will also that thou know that
al be not dyseeyued by such gladness / but only such imperfect folk / that
set all their joy more in the gift of comfort and delight of vysytacyon /
than in me yt am the gyuer. And all such that with any beholdynge of other
thing than of me / beholde^ fervently rather to affection of me that am the
gyuer / tha^ to the gift / and so they love the gift for me / and not for
their own comfort may never be dysceyued of their gladness / in time of
vysyo^s or vysytacyons. And therefore they know right well when ye fend
comes in form of light / for to dysceyue by such manner of gladness / as
soon as they aspy it is he / anon they know themself with their own very
knowledge / and despise such comfort / grypynge and clypped the doctrine of my
charity. And for shame the fend gothe fro them / but all such that love their
ghostly comfort do the contrary. For they may know if they will his dysceytes
(as I have said) that is fyndy^ge in their own souls joy without virtue /
not going out of the same pathe of meekness / and very charity / and hongre
of my worship endeles god / and also of health of souls / like as my parfyte
and true lovers done. Lo daughter my endelesse goodness has provided thus /
for parfyte and vnparfyte / in what state yt they stand / for to know
dysceytes of the fend / in time of vysyons and vysytacyons / that they be not
dysceyued / if they will keep the light of intelleccyon / the which I have
given to you / with the clear syghte of right holy feythe / the which light
lets the fend for to shadow upon you his dysceytes / and therefore never
avoid this light of grace away fro you / for if ye never avoid it away fro
you / there is none that may take it away fro you. How that god is ye
fulfyller of holy desires of his servants / and how it pleases god much
when a man does ask with parseuerau^ce / and knocks at the gate of his
sothefastnesse. NOw dear daughter I have fully declared to the and yllumyned
the eye of thy intelleccyon / against the dysceytes that ye fend may do to
the / and so I have satysfyed thy desire of that thing thou did ask me / for
I am not a dyspyser of the desires of my servants / but I give to the the
asker / and stir the for to ask / and he dyspleaseth me right much that
knocks not verily at the gate of my sothefastnesse (that is Ihesu) suynge the
doctrine of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / shewy^ge his doctrine /
which is nothing else / but a manner knocking and cryenge to me endelesse
fader / by the voice of holy desire / with meke and contynuall prayers. I am that
fader yt gives to you breed of grace / by medyacyon of the gate that is of my
sone Ihesu / and other while sor to prove your desires and perseuerau^ce / I
feyne me as though I understood you not in your asking / and yet I
understand you well enough / and yet in the mean while / that that is
spedefull for you I give you. For I give you both hongre and will / by the
which ye cryen to me. And tha^ I seeing your stydfastnes and parseuerau^ce /
in that that they be ordynately dyrecte to me I fulfill. To this calling my
only sothefaste sone Ihesu has styrred you / where he says thus / knock
and it shall be opened to you / ask and you shall have / search and you shall
find. So I will that thou do / that thy desire never cease i^ asking of my
help / nor bow not away thy voice fro me endelesse fader / that I may show
and do mercy to the world. Nor cese not for to knock at the gate of my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu / in suy^ge of his steps. Delight therefore i^ his
passion / erynge with him upon the table of the cross ye meet of health of
souls / for joy / presynge / and honor of my name / and wayle there
hertefully the bethe of manky^de / whom thou sees fall in great wretchedness.
For there is no tongue in earth suffycyent / to tell the wretchedness that is
used i^ this world / and therefore by such waylynge / weeping / and cryenge /
I will show mercy to the world. This thing it is that I desire and require
of my servants / and that is a toke^ that they love me verily (and therefore
as Isayd) I shall never despise nor set little by their devout desires. How
this devout soul does meke her and yeldeth tha^kynges to god / and how that
she prays for all the world / and specyal for holy church / and also
specially for her ghostly dyscyples / and for her two ghostly faders / and
after this she asks to her of the deeds of mynystres to holy church. T'Han
that devout soul was verily drunk by union of love / by the which she was
alyened and rapte fro herself / and her bodyly felynges / and araysed herself
above herself / beholdynge with the eye of intelleccyon in the endeles truth of
god / and said thus. O sovereign endeles goodness of god what wrecthe am I /
that it shall please the my sweet sovereign endeles fader to show to me thy
sothefastnes / and also the pryue subtyltes of the fend / and dysceytes of my
own sensualyte / ye which dysceytes both I and other might receive in this
weeping word / and know them not / but if we had be informed before. Good
lord who styrred ye here to? Certain thy own love / for thou did love me /
or than I loved the. O fire of love / thanking be to yt endelesse fader / I
vnparlyte and full of derkenesse / and thou parfyte and full of light hase
showed me parfeccyon / and a clear shynynge way of doctrine / of thy only
sothefast sone Ihesu. I was deed / and you hase yraysed me / I was seek and thou
hase given me medycynes / and not only the medycyne of ye blood yt you gave to
mankind by medyacyo^ of thy sons passyo^ / but thou hase given me an other
specyal medycyne against my pryuy sickness / ye which I never knew before /
by yt doctrine that thou hase given me / yt in no wise I should Judge any manner
reasonable creatures and specially thy servants / of whom ofte^tymes as a
blind wretch / and lan gorynge in this sekenes / under color of the honor
and worship of thy name and health of souls / I have give Judgments.
Wherefore I thank the endeles and infynyte goodness / for thou hase made me
know by manyfestacyo^ or showing of thy sothefastnesse / both dysccyte of
the fend / and also the infyrmyte of my own passyo^ / wherefore of synguler
grace and mercy I beseech the / that fro this dare forewarde I go never out
fro thy doctrine / that thy endelesse goodness has taught me / and also for
all those that will follow the same doctrine. For without the is nothing done
/ to the therefore I fle the endelesse fader / and I may not pray for me to
the endelesse fader / but for all the world / and specially for the mysteryall
body our mother holy church / that this truth of doctrine shine in the
mynystres of holy church / and yet specially I pray the for them all / that
thou hase take for to love in special love / whom thou hase made one with me
/ for they should be my refresshy^ge and comfort / when I se them run by
this doctrine vndefouled / and mortyfyed to all their own wylles. And without
any demynge or / sclau^drynge / or grutchynge of their neighbors to the
worship and honor of thy holy name. I pray the therefore infynyte love / that
none of the^ be withdraw fro thy hondes by the fend of hell / but that they
may come to the / that art the end of all their labor. Also I pray yt for
two pyllers / the which be my two ghostly faders / whom thou hase le^de to me
for my keeping and doctrine of me most wretched and seek fro ye begynny^ge of
my lyuy^ge unto this time / that you make the^ both one of two bodies and one
soul / and that none of the^ take heed to none other thing pryncypally / than
for to fulfill the mynystery of their offices the which thou hase put in to
their hondes for health of souls to ye worship of thy holy name. And I
unworthy and most wretched servant (and not a daughter) may te^derly keep
their doctrine with du reverence and holy dread / and that also I may dread
them reverently for thy love / that it be to the worship / and to the^ pease
and quietness and edyfycacyon of their neighbor. I am right certain
endelesse truth / that thou shall not despise my desire / nor my askynges that
I have asked of the / for I know well by the showing that thou hase showed to
me / and much more by experye^ce that thou art accepter and taker of holy
desires. Therefore I thy unworthy servant shall besy me after ye grace yt you
hase given me for to keep thy doctrine and byddy^ge. O endeles fader I have
my^de of thy word yt you told me / wha^ you told me certain things of thy
ministers of our mother holy church and you said yt thou would tell me more
plainly i^ an other place of their wickedness that they use these days /
wherefore if it be lyky^ge to thy goodness / I desire that thou tell me some what
thereof / that I may have matter thereof for to encrese in sorrow and compassyon
and lo^gynge desire for the health of their souls. For as I remember me now /
thou said that to all those that have compassyon / pain / wepynges / sorrows
/ swetynges / and prayers for sinners / you would gracyously refresshe them by
reformynge of holy church / with good and holy pastoures or shepeherdes.
Therefore because al these should encrese in me / I ask the and pray the of
this thing. How that god beholds the besynes of this soul about prayer /
and answers to some of her petycyons. Than endelesse god tournynge to her the
eye of his mercy / not dyspysynge her desire / but rather receyuynge and
alowynge her asking / wylly^ge for to satysfy to the last petycon yt she made
of his behestes / said thus. O ryghteswete and dear daughter i^ that that thou
hase asked of me / I shall satysfy thy desire / so that you be not upon thy side
ygnoraunte and neclygente / for it were more grievous to the and worthy more
reprefe / such ygnoraunce and neclygence now than first / for thou knows now
more of my truth / than thou knew than. Besy the therefore for to pray for all
reasonable creatures / and for ye mysteryall body of holy church / and for
them whom I have committed to ye / that you love them specially / and that you
be not neclygent for to pray for the^ / both by ensample of living and
speaking by word / repreuynge vycys / and co^mendynge virtue after thy power.
Of those pyllers whom I have le^de to ye / of whom thou hase told me / and
sothe it is yt they be pyllers. Do so that thou be a mean for to yield to each
of the^ after the ablenes of them / as I thy maker shall make open to the / for
with out me / you may nothy^ge do. and Tha^ I shall fulfill thy desires / therefore
look thou fail not / nor they never in my hope / for in you shall not lack my
prouydence / and each of the^ shall receive that thing / the which he is able
for to receive. And in the same wise every mynystre shall receive yt thing yt
I shall give hy^ for to mynystre / after his manner as he receives and takes
of my goodness.

In this third chapyter god shows to this soul of ye dygnyte of priests /
and of the sacrament of his holy body / and of them yt do receive yt sacrament
worthyly. Also how all ye bodyly wits or felynges be dysceyued i^ yt foresaid
sacrament / but not ye fely^unges of ye soul. Therefore with yt felynges or
wits of ye soul yt holy sacrament shall be seen / rasted / and feled / and
of other matters / as it is rehearsed before in ye calendar. Ca. iii.
I Shall answer to the of yt thou asks me of the mynysters of holy church /
and that you may verily know the truth / open the eye of thy intelleccyon /
and behold the excellence of them in how great dygnyte I have set them.
But because a contrary is lightly know by his contraryte / I will show the
first the dygnyte of them that have virtuously only excercysed the tresour
that I have betake to their hondes and so by that thou shall the better know
their wretchydnes / yt these days feed them at the breast of this spouse holy
church. Than this devout soul for to obey to his bidding / did behold
co^templatyfely in the sothefastnesse of him / in the which sothefastnesse she
saw virtues shine / in very tasters. Tha^ endeles almighty god said to this
devout soul / dear daughter first I will tell the the dygnyte of them (in ye
which dygnyte) I of my goodness have set them and ordained them / and
showed them love above the general love / that I have to all other creatures /
making the^ first as I have made all other reasonable creatures / to yt image
and lykenes of me. And also in ye reformynge of the^ / as I have reformed all
other reasonable creatures / i^ ye precious blood of my sweet sone Ihesu. Also
above all this I have set you in such excelle^ce by union of my godhed / yt
I have to them in mankind / yt they have more excellence and dygnyte tha^ an
angel / for your kind I have take upon me / and not yt ky^de of an angel
(for as I have said to the) I god was made man / and man was made god / as by
union of my dyuyne nature / in your nature. These things in general I have
given to every reasonable creature / but ymo^ges these creatures I have chose^
my specyal mynystres for your health / that by the^ may be mynystred to you ye
blood of my only meke and vndefouled lamb Ihesu christ. To such I have give
ye sone for to be mynystred / gyuynge also there with to them the light of
cunny^ge and the fire of my dyuyne charity and also oned with light of hete /
yt is with the blood and the body of my sone / the which is one son / for it
is the same with me / that am very son. And in somoche it is oned to me /
that the one of us may not be departed fro that other / no more than may the
hete of the son fro the light / nor the light fro ye hete. That son is
never divided / and yet to all the world / and to any creature that will be
made warm by him / it gives light / and this son is never defouled / for
none uncleanness. In the same wise my only sone that is flesh and blood / is
one son / all god / and all man / for it is one the same with me / and I with
him / my might is never departed fro his wisdom / nor the here of ye fire of
the holy ghost is never departed fro me ye fader / nor fro my sone / for he is
one with us / for the holy ghost goth out fro me ye fader / and my sone / and not
fro the trynyte / and we be one the same son. I am ye same son endeles god
/ of whom gothe out both the sone and ye holy ghost also. To the holy ghost
fire is appropryate / to the sone wisdom / in ye which wisdom my mynystres
do receive a light of grace / for that same light is mynystred with light / and
with kyndenes of benefytes received of me endelesse fader / showing the
doctrine of this wisdom that is of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu. This is
the same light / that has i^ him the color of your manheed / the one is
knytte with ye other / so the light of my godheed was the same only light
with the color of your manheed / ye which color was man shynynge / wha^ he
was impassyble by virtue of the god heed in dyuyne nature / and that by mean and
medyacyon of this my only sothefast sone incarnate / co^myxte and meddled with
the light of my goodheed in dyuyne nature / and with fire and hete of the holy
ghost / ye receyuen light. To whom have I given that light to be mynystred?
Certeynly to my mynysters mynystry^ge in the mysteryal body of holy church /
and that ye may verily have everlasting life / I make them for to give to you
that blessed body in sacrament of the auter unto your ghostly meet / and that
blessed blood in to ghostly drink. I said also to ye / that that body may
not begyue without blood / nor blood and body without the soul of my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / nor soul and body without godheed of me endelesse god
/ for there may none of all these be departed fro other / for byuyne nature
ones knyte to mankind / may never be departed fro it / another by death nor by
yet no other thing / and so ye receive all the sencyble being of god in that
sweet sacrament / under the whytenesse of breed. And right as the son may
not be departed / right so all god and all man in this whytenesse of the
blessed sacrament may not be departed / though the host were divided in to a
thousand parts / i^ every party I am all god and and al man / right as a
myrrour that is dyuyded / in every dyuysyo^ is seen the image of a man / and
yet the image is not divided / right so this host dyuyded / and yet it is not
dyuyded all god and all man / but it is in every party of it hole and al / nor
it is not therefore lessed in it self. For right as the light of a candell /
to the which though all the world come for to fetch part of his light /
his light is nevertheless / and yet each yt fetches thereof have al light
Nevertheless you may parceyue yt all take not light egally / for some take
more and some less / after ye matter yt the fetcher bry^geth with hy^ / and that
you may ye better understood m^ / I shall show ye an ensample. If there were
many yt bare ca^dels or tapers / some of an ounce / some ye weyghte of two
ounces / some of a pound or more / and al should go fetch light with their
tapers / you would say thou saw them all bear light / hete / and color / and
yet nevertheless thou would deem that he bate less light in his taper of an
ounce / than he yt bare the canof a poude. In the same wise it happeth of the^
that do receive this sacrament and bear their candeles / that is their holy
desire / by the which holy desire this sacrament is received / the which
ca^dell of holy desire is quenched in it self / and by receyuynge of this holy
sacrament / it is extyncte and quenched (as I se it in it self) for of your
self you be naught. Nevertheless I give you matter / by ye which ye may
receive and noryshe in yourselfe this light. This matter is nothing else /
but love / for pure of love I have made you / and therefore without love ye may
not live. This essencyall being given to you by love receives dysposycyon in
the holy baptym / the which baptym / ye did receive in yt virtue of ye blessed
sacrament of my only sothefast sone for in none other wise ye may take part
of yt light (that is reherced before) but rather ye should be like to a
candell without wyke / that in no wise may brenne / nor receive that light
within him. In the same wise / if you do not receive in your soul the wyke
that receives this light / the which is called the light of very fey the /
and also be not come to yt grace / the which ye did receive in the holy baptym
/ with affeccyo^ of your soul / formed and abled by me for to love / the
which affection is so apt for to love / that without love it may not live /
for love is his meet. But where catches such a soul light so oned / as I
have said. Certain at the fire of my dyuyne charity / loving me and dredynge
me / and suynge the doctrine of my only sothefaste truth. Nevertheless as I
said some do catch more light / and some less / after ye matter that he
bears / and gives to the fire. For though all ye have one matter / that is
because ye be all made and create / and formed to the image of me. And yt also
ye have received the light of holy baptym / and so be made christian men / each
of you may encrese in love and virtue as it is plesau^te and liking to my
grace for to give you. Not for to change the shappe and form that I have
given you / but that ye make encrese / and yt virtues may grow in you by love
/ using in your virtue fre choys / and using also affection of charity / and
so in love ye may encrese (as it is reherced) with the which love / ye should
come for to receive yt sweet and glorious light / the which I have give to
you for to be mynystred / by mean of my mynysters that I have given to you / in
to your ghostly meet / and ye receive somoche of yt ghostly light / as you
bear of love and holy desire / and though it so be (as I said) ye ye receive
all the light (by ensample as I showed to you by them that bare tapers) that
after the quantyte of ye weyghte / so they did receive light less or more /
all be it thou se hole light in each of those tapers / not dyuyded / for that
may not be for no manner of imparfeccyo^ of you / another of the receyuer nor of
the mynystre / but ye take asmoche of that light in you that is of grace /
which ye receive in this sacrament / as ye dyspose you for to receive by holy
desire. And if any go to this blessed sacrament with trespass of deedly sins /
he shall in nowyse receive grace of it / all though he receive actually all
god and all man in the same sacrament / as it is before said. Will you know
how such a soul stondeth that receives this sacrament unworthily? It
stondeth like a ca^dle / in the which water is fall / ye which never ceseth
to cry and make noise / as long as ye water touches ye fire in ye wyke / and
as soon as the water is fully entered i^ to the wyke / it is quenched and is
lost / than is no fire i^ it / but only smoke. In the same wise ye soul
bears i^ herself a ca^dell of gracyous light / that it received in the
sacrament of holy baptym / in to the which soul enters water of sin / and
quenches the wyke of light of gracyous baptym / where it waxes vndysposed /
and so vnchaufed at the fire of very contrycyon / she is confessed generally of
al her sins / and in that wise she gothe to the auter for to receive that
blessed sacrament actually / and not me^tally. Thus this very gracyous light
dwells not in a soul vndefouled by grace / that dysposeth her not as the
should dyspose her to such a worthy sacrament but it gothe away / and than in
such a soul dwells and abides right great confusyon and shaiue by
greatenes of ye sin / after time yt light is so quenched / for of that
blessed sacrament such a sole feleth none other thing / but only cryenge and
noise by remors of conscience / not for defaute that is in the light / for
that may in no wise be hurt / but for defaute that is in the water which is
found in the soul / and lets affection of ye soul / in such manner that
the soul may not receive this gracyous light. And thus you knows well / that
in no wise this light may be departed / fro the hete and color of ye same
light / another for the little desire that the soul has in receyuynge of
this sacrament / another for defaute that is i^ the soul ye which receives it
/ nor also of hy^ that mynystreth it / as I have told the by ensample of the
son / that though it shine upon a foul thing / yet it is not thereby
defiled. In ye same wise this right well byloued light in this blessed
sacrament in no wise may be defouled / nor divided nor lessed. I said also
that yt light of the sofie may not be deperted fro his spear / though al ye
world take both light and hete of him. In yt same wise this blessed body the
sacrament of the auter / my blessed only sothefaste sone / that very son
may not be departed fro me the son that am endelesse fader / though all it
be mynystred by the mysteryall body of holy church / to what reasonable
creature yt will receive it / but rather it is all hole / and it is all
received both god and man as I gave the ensample by light / where I said /
though all ye world took light of thy candell / yet is thy light never yt
less / but it is all hole / and nevertheless al receive it hole. How all the
bodyly wits or felynges be dysceyued i^ the foresaid sacrament / but not the
felynges of the soul / therefore with felynges and wits of the soul that
holy sacrament shall be seen / tasted / and feled / and here of is a vysyon
which this devout soul did se within this matter following. Dear daughter
open the eye of thy intelleccyon for to se yt depenes of my charity / for there
is no reasonable creature but that he should melte and dyssolue his heart by
affection of love / if ymonges al other benefytes the which he receives of me
/ he behold worthily to the benefyte yt he receives in this blessed sacrament
of ye auter. And with what eye dear daughter should thou and other behold /
and se / touch / and parceyue this blessed mystery? Not only with touching
and syghte of the body / for all the bodyly felynges and wits fail i^ that
sacrament / thy bodyly eye sees nothing / but whytenesse of breed / the same
touches thy hondes / and the taste sauoreth nothing else / but the savor of
breed / and so the great bodyly wits be dysceyued. The feeling and the wits
of the soul may not be dysceyued therein (but if they will) that is in
withdrawynge the light of feythe / by medyacyon of feythefulnesse. Who is he
that tastes / sees / and touches / this blessed sacrament? Certain the
feeling of the soul. With what eye sees the soul that blessed sacrament?
With the eye of intelleccyon / if in that eye be the perle / or clear syghte of
very feythe. This eye than sees in that whytenes all god and all man / dyuyne
nature oned with the nature of man / body / soul / and blood / of christ / the
soul oned in the body / and the body and soul oned with my dyuyne nature /
never fro me dyscordynge (as I told the) if you have mind in the beginning of
thy co^uersyon. And not only with the eye of intelleccyon / but also with the
bodyly eye / and though it so were that thy bodyly eye had lost a great part
of his syghte / yet the eye of intelleccyon has ever clear syghte. I showed
the ones for a declaracyon of the same sacrament / against the battle that
the fend put to the of the same sacrament / and that I did to the for to make
the encrese in love / and in ye light of holy feythe. Also thou knows well
that thou went to the church very erly in a morrow for to here mass / and
before that thou was sore vexed of the fend / and there thou stood before an
auter of the crucyfyxe / where as a priest came and said mass / and all that
mass time thou did consydre thy defautes / and thou was aferde for to offend
me / for all the temptacyons yt the fend did to the. And than thou began for
to consydre the great affection of my endelesse charity / the which has
made the right worthy for to here mass / although you demes thyselfe unworthy
for to enter i^ to my holy temple. Tha^ after time ye priest came to ye time of
consecracyon / thou did behold tyght besyly the priest / and wha^ he said
words of co^secracyo^ / I made me open to the / and so thou saw coming out
of my breast / a light as it had by a son beme coming out fro the whele of
the son / and not departing fro the same whele or rundel of the son / in
the which light came a culuer and flykered or did smite his wings together
about the host of showing joy and gladness / for virtue of those words that
the priest said in time of co^secracyon. And so thy bodyly eye was not
suffycyent for to suffer to se such a light / but thy syghte only belefte in
the eye of intelleccyon / there thou saw and tasted the depenesse of the
trynyte / all god and all man hyd and covered under whytenesse of breed. And
another the great light that thou had of me / nor the worthy presence of
me that thou did feel in the intellectually / took not away nor mynsshed the
wytenesse of breed / for that one was no lettynge to that other / that is for
to se me intellectually very god and very man in that likeness of breed / nor
also that likeness of breed was not yet yletted by me / for fro that likeness
of breed / was never with drawt whytenesse / nor touching / nor savor. This
reuelacyon and vysyon was showed to ye of my end less goodness / the which
endelesse goodness gave to the eye of thy intelleccyon / a clear sight with holy
feythe. Therefore the eye of intelleccyon should be thy pry^cypall syghte / and
with that syghte ye should behold the sacrament of the auter. But who touches
yt sacrament? Certain the hand of love / for that sacrament the which is
seen and known with the eye of intelleccyon / is touched with yt hand of love /
of feythe it is touched / with the ho^de of love / as though he certyfyed
himself of that thing that he sees by feythe / and knew by intelleccyon.
But now what thing tastes that sacrament? The taste of holy desire / ye taste
of the body tastes nothing else but savor of breed / but yt taste of ye
soul that is holy desire tastes both god and man in that holy sacrament /
under form of breed. Sees thou not now how thy bodyly felynges be dysceyued /
and not ye wits of ye soul / for they be claryfyed and cerfyfyed in ye sothe
/ in asmoche as the eye of intelleccyo^ saw it with the perle of very clear
feythe. The taste also of the soul / tastes it with fervent desire of my
brenny^ge charity / by the which brennynge charity / I made the soul worthy
for to receive that worthy sacrament / and also the grace of the sacrament.
Thus thou may tha^ se / that not only without the bodyly wits / ye should
se and receive that blessed sacrament / but also with ghostly felynges /
dysposynge the wits of your soul with affection of love / for to se /
receive / and taste (as I have said) that most blessed sacrament of the auter
/ the body of my blessed sone Ihesu. Of the excellence in the which a soul
stondeth / that receives this sacrament i^ grace. Behold now dear daughter i^
what excellence dwells a soul that receives this blessed sacrament / ye
which is called quycke breed or breed of life / and angels fode. Wha^ such a
worthy soul receives yt blessed sacrament / he dwells in me and I in him /
as a fysshe dwells in the sea / and the sea in yt fysshe. In ye same myse
such a soul dwells in me yt am the peaseable see / and I ye pease able see
dwell in such a soul. In such a soul also dwells grace / for wha^ such
one receives this breed of life / grace dwells in grace after the
consumpcyon of that musteryal quycke breed / and so I leave in you / the image
of my grace. Right as a seyle put upon hot wax / after ye time that it lift
up and taken away / the prynte of the image does remain. In ye same wise ye
virtue of this sacrament remains in the soul / for to you remains the hete
of charity / the meekness of the holy ghost / and ye light of wisdom of my
only sothefast sone Ihesu / by Illumynynge of the eye of intellecleccyon / in
the same wisdom for to know and se i^ him the doctrine of my charity. In yt
same wise a soul is strong / of my strength raky^ge part of my heavenly
might / and so I make such a soul strong against his own sencyble passion
/ against the temptacyo^s of ye fendes / and against the wretched world. And
thus thou may se that there remains always a prynte or an image of grace /
after time yt ghostly matter of the sacrament of the auter is received and
ghostly consumed. This ghostly matter thus received and ghostly consumed / tha^
this very son tourneth again to his whele and roundell / not that it was
departed fro the same whele / but yt it was and is ever oned and knytte with me
together in one. But the depenesse of my dyuyne charity for your health / has
given to you meet in this life / in the which life ye be pilgrims and
strangers / for to receive you / and for ye should not lose ye my^de of my
benefits of my sons precious blood. Also therefore it is given to you in to
your ghostly meet by my dyuyne dyspensacyon / for helping of your necessytes
or needs. Thus than behold howmoche ye be bound to me / for to yield me love
again / for so great love that I have showed to you / and also for because
that I am endelesse and most sovereign sothefastenesse / worthy to be loved of
you. How the words that be said of the excellence of the sacrament / ben
said of the dygnyte of priests that should better know / and how god asks
more purete and clennesse of body and soul of the^ / than of other of his
creatures. ALl this have I told the dear daughter that thou may the better
know the dygnyte in the which I have set my mynysters. And also that thou
have yt more compassyon of their wretchydnes / for if they themself behold
their own dygnyte / they would never dwell in the derkenes of deedly sins /
nor they would never defoule ye faces of their souls with yt spots of deedly
sins / and not only that they should ascape without offense of me and their
own dygnyte / for though y they betake their bodies to the fire it should be
right little satysfaccyon of the trespass / to so great grace / and so great a
benefyte as they have received / for in this world they might never come to so
great a dygnyte. They be only my anoy^ted people for I call them my crystes /
and to them have I betake myself for to be mynystred to you / and also I have
send them in to the mysteryall body of holy church / as right sweet smelly^ge
flowers. This dygnyte has not an angel / but I have given it to me^ / to
such as I have chosen for my mynysters / whom I have ordained i^ earth as
angels / and they should be called angels of earth in this life / for as angels
they should be. In every soul I require purete and charity / by ye which he
should love me pryncypally and his neighbor / and also for to help him in
that he can and may / other by temporal good / or by mynystracyon of prayer /
and so for to dwell together in the love of charity / as I have upon this same
matter told yt i^ an other place. Much more therefore I require purete and love
i^ my mynystres / both anendes me and also anendes their neighbors /
mynystrynge both to themself and to their neighbors / the body and the blood
in the sacrament of the auter / of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / with the
fire of charity / and hongre of health of souls / for the glory and laud of
my name. For right as my mynysters will have clean chalyces for to put in that
blessed sacrament / so I require in them ye purete of heart / and clennesse of
soul in them. I will also that the body of them the which is an instrument of
the soul be kept in parfyte purete and clennesse / and I will not that they
noryshe it in the fylthe of uncleanness / nor yt they be proud nor high of
heart / seeking great prelaces / nor that they be cruel anendes themself and
their neighbors / for they may not use their own cruelte without harming of
their neighbors / ^or if they be to themself cruel / they be cruel in
receyuy^ge of sin / and so they be of ye souls of their neighbors / because
they give to them no ensample of life. Nor all such have no fere ^or to pull
^ute souls out of the fendes hondes / nor for to mynystre to them the body and
the blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu / and also me very light (as I have
said) nor also none other sacrament of holy church. And thus all the while
they be to the^ thus cruel / they be in the same wise to other so cruel. How
that sacraments should never be soulde nor boughte / and they that receive the
sacraments should help the mynystres with their temporal goods / which
goods the mynysters should dyspose and ordeyne for to be dysposed in to three
parts. I will that they be large and not scarce / yt is another for couetyse nor
auaryce / they sell the grace of the holy ghost / so should they not do / another
I will that they do so / but rather of the gracyous gift and the wydenes of
charity that they have received of my endelesse goodness / for to give it freely
of large heart by affection of love for ye worship of me and health of souls /
to every reasonable creature the which asks it mekely / and they should
nothing take therefore / in asmoche as they boughte it never / but they did
receive it of me by grace / for to mynystre it to you. Also they may and
should well by the way of alms receive / and so should the subject do that
receives the sacrament / for on his side he should give that he might for
alms some what give / for in asmoche as they should be ghostly fed of them /
therefore they should help them at their needs of temporal goods. I will that
ye were that without any comparyson / they give to you more tha^ ye give to
them / for there may be set no comparyson bytwyxe things that have none
end / as transytory things of the which ye helpe^ them to me endelesse god
that am infynyte^ whom by prouydence and dyuyne charity I have ordained for to
mynystre to you ghostly things and graces / that is the sacrament of holy
church / and not only of such mynysters / but also of other ghostly graces
and prayers / and of other ghostly things / of what priest that ever it be
that it be given to you / for that ghostly good may not be lykened to no manner
of temporal good / ye ye given to the^. Also now shall I tell the how they
should depart that te^porall good yt they receive of you / I say that they
should depart ye substance of those temporal goods ye which they receive
of you in to three pertes / one for their own lyuelode / an other to poor men
/ and ye third for necessary things to holy church and in none other wise /
for and they do otherwise / they offe^de me gretely.

The.iiii. chapyter speaks in the beginning of ye dygnyte of priests / and
how yt virtue of the sacraments is not lessed nor mynyshed throw the sins of
them that mynystre them / nor throw the sins of ye receyuer. And how god
will not that seculers of the world / correcke ye mynystres of holy church.
Also how god arecteth the parsecucyo^ yt is done to holy church or to the
mynystres / as it were do to himself / and so of other matters / as is rehearsed
in the kalendre / in the begynnige of ye book. Ca. iiii.
I Would that you knew yt excellence of my very sweet and glorious mynystres
whom I have made and called my crystes / as I have said. They yt excercyse ye
virtuous dygnyte i^ virtues / be arrayed with the glorious son yt I have given
to them for to mynystre forth / as you may be hold and se of glorious Gregory
/ Syluester / and other yt went before the^ and also yt did follow them / ye
which did succeed after yt pryncypal high bishop Peter / to whom were
delivered the keys of yt kyngedome of heaven of my only sothefast sone /
saying to him thus. To ye Peter I shall give ye keys of ye ky^gedome of
heuens / and what you vnbyndes here in earth / it shall be vnbou^de and losed i^
heaven. Take heed dear daughter and se how I have made open to the the excellent
virtuous dygnyte of my mynysters / and now more plainly shall I declare to yt
the dygnyte yt I have put the^ in. This keye is the keye of my blood of my
only sothefast sone Ihesu christ / ye which keye has made open to christian
souls endelesse life / that was long time shyt fro mankind for ye sin of
Adam. And after time I granted you my sothefastnesse / yt is my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / for to suffer passion and death for you / with ye same
death he dystroyed your death / making to you of his precious blood a bathe /
and so his blood and his death oned in the virtue of my dyuyne nature with
mankind / have opened everlasting life. But to whom left he ye keys of his
precious blood in kepy^ge? To ye glorious apostell Peter / and to other popes
yt dyde^ succeed after / and so unto yt last day of Judgment they have and
shall have ye same auctoryte and power yt Peter had / and yt auctoryte is never
mynyshed nor lessed / for no manner defaute yt is in the^ / nor it wtdraweth
never away ye parfeccyo^ of yt blood / nor fro no sacrament / for I said ye
right now yt this glorious son may not be defouled / for no fylthy nature /
nor to lose his light for no derkenes of deedly syn^e / yt is other in ye
mynystre / or in him yt receives / for ye syn^e of any mynystre of holy
church may not hurt nor less ye virtue of it / but yet nevertheless grace
may be mynyshed / and sin may encrese in hy^ yt mynystreth / and in hy^ yt
receives it unworthily. And yet christ keeps yt keys of his blood wtin such
unworthy mynysters / as if you have mind / I have showed to ye by a symylitude
where I showed to ye what reverence seculer men should do to my mynysters /
whether they be good or bad / and how much ye vnreuere^ce of the^ to
miministers dysplesed me. Knows you not well yt I put ye in ensample the
mystery all body of holy church / to ye lykenes of a celer / in ye which the
blood of my sone Ihesu was kept in / in ye which blood / all ye sacraments
be made perfyte / and they have received life of ye same blood in virtue / at yt
gate of ye which celler / cuyst was here i^ earth / to whom was committed of
me endeles fader / for to mynystre yt same blood / and therefore to hy^ it
longed to chose such ministers yt might help hy^ for to ministre ye same blod
to all ye universal body of cryste^ relygyo^. He yt was accepted of him / was
made very mynystre under hy^ and none other / but such one. Fro yt accepcyon
comes forth all yt order of clergy / whom he has chosen and set eueryone
of the^ in their office for to mynyster yt precious blood / and like as he
has set / as for his helpers in ye mynystracyon ye sacraments of holy
church / so to hy^ it lo^geth only for to correcke the^ for their defautes /
and so I will it be. For of ye excellence and auctoryte ye I have give to them /
I drew the^ out of bondage and seruage / yt is fro subieccyon of temporal
lords. Te^porall law may nothing punyshe the^ / but he only yt is set above
for to mynystre i^ my law yt am endelesse god (as be such yt be anointed of
me) they should correcke the^ under me when they trespass. And therefore by holy
write I have said thus. Nolite tangere. etc. To te^porall lords / touch not
my crystes yt be my mynysters which be anointed of me / for a man may come to
no greater a fall / tha^ for to defoule and to despise my mynysters. How god
arecteth ye persecucyon yt is done to holy church and to ye mynysters as it
were done to himself / and how yt sin is more grievous than any other sin.
ANd if you will ask me why I say yt the sin of the^ is more grievous ye
which do parsu holy church and my mynysters / tha^ any other sin yt they do
/ and also why I will not yt reverence be mynyshed anendes the^ (not with
stondynge their defautes) I shall tell yt. Every reverence yt is done to the^ /
is not done to the^ but to me / by virtue of the blood yt I have given to the^
for to mynystre (for if ye ne were) ye would do asmoche reverence to the^ as ye
wolden do to worldely men (and no more) and for yt mystery ye be constrained
for to do the^ reverence / for needs ye must come to their ho^des / not to them
for themself (but for ye virtue that I have given to them) if ye will receive
any sacraments. For if ye may have the^ and will not / ye should dye i^ state
of dampnacyon / therefore it is my reverence / and the reverence of this
glorious blood / and not their reverence / for we be one by the vnyo^ of dyuyne
nature / knyte and oned with mankind. And right as the reverence is mine / so
is the irreverence mine (for as I said) ye given them no reverence to
themself for theyrselfe / but for ye auctoryte that I have given to the^ / and
therefore they should not be offended / for wha^ they offend them / they
offend me and them. I have forbid them for to touch my crystes / ye is my
anointed people / with hands of vyolence. There ought no temporal man to
excuse him and say (I do the^ no wrong) nor I am not enuyous to our mother
the holy church / though I punyshe ye defautes of evil curates. Here such
one lies and says not sothe / for he may not se / he is so bly^ded in his
own love (and yet though he se) he feyneth himself blind / for to cover ye
prycke of his conscience. For wha^ that ever they parsu them / they parsu me /
and so they do me wrong / for right as the reverence is mine / so is al yt
harm mine / both scorns / repreues / harms / shames and also blames. Al
those I arecte to me yt be done to them / for I have forbid the^ and warned
the^ / not for to touch i^ vyolence by word nor deed my mynysters / I should
punyshe them when they offe^de / and not they. Thus tha^ what that ever they be
in living / the reverence of them should never be mynyshed / for wha^ they
mynesh it / they offend me / and therefore this sin is more grievous than any
other sin. And though they be wicked in lyuy^ge and done many wyckednesses /
of whose wyckednes it shall be said in an other place / yet if to them be done
reverence only for me / it is arected to me and not to the^. But now three
pryncypall causes there be / why yt sin of irreverence is more grievous sin
than any other. One is / for yt reverence which is done to them is done to me.
Another is / for they break my bidding / in yt I forbade the^ not for to
touch the^ vyole^tly / by ye which vnreuerent touchy^ge / they despise my
blood / which they have take of holy baptym / for they dysobeye / doing yt
thing yt is forbid them. And therefore they be rebel to this blood / for they
have set reverence aside / and be risen with great parsecucyon / and so they
be stynkynge members / cut away fro yt mysteryall body of holy church / and
as long as they dwell obstynate in that rebellyon and with yt irreverence /
without any doubt they run to endelesse dampnacyo^. Nevertheless if they
meke the^ and low the^ and knowledge their defautes / they shall receive mercy
and forgyuenesse. Another cause is why that their sins be more grievous tha^
other / for it is a sin yt is done of their own malice and with a vysement /
for to know well that with good conscience / they must not do as they done / and
therefore in their doing they offend grievously / which offense is a manner of
cursed pride / without bodyly delectacyo^ / for it wasleth both body and soul /
the soul is consumed / for it is pryued fro grace / and often times the worm
of conscience freteth such folk. Also the bodyly substance is consumed in
the service of the fend / their bodies be as deed beestes / and thus this
sin is properly ane^des me / for it is done without any color of his own
profit / and with malice and ye smoke of pride / which pride spryngeth out of
sencyble love / and of that wyeked dread yt Pylate had / that for dread of
losing of his lordeshyppe / he did slay my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / so
done all such. All other sins that they done be done of ygnorau^ce or
symplynes / but this cursed sin is done by malice / for he knows the evil
that he does / it is all done of vnordynate dylectacyon and plesaunce that
they have to that sin / orelles of some manner of profit that they find i^
that sin / and so the offender / dampneth / and hurts / his own soul /
and me / and his neighbor. Me he hurts and offe^deth / for he yeldeth no
thanks to me his maker. His neighbor he offends and hurts / for he
yeldeth not to hy^ love of charity. Also he offends and hurts himself /
though he do it not by actual smiting / ye which offense dyspleaseth me /
for yt harm yt I se i^ hy^. And thus as I have said without any mean / this
offense is only done to me. All other sins have some color / for they be
done with some color and with a mean / for I have said in another place yt
every sin and every virtue was done by medyacyon and mean of neyghbourheed /
for sin is ye cause of ye pryuacyon of ye love of god and of thy neighbor.
Therefore they yt offe^de their neighbors offend me by mean of them. But
ymonge al my creatures yt have reason wtin the^ / I have chosen my mynysters (as
I have told ye) which be called my anointed people for to mynystre ye body and
blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / yt is knytte and oned to the flesh
of your ma^heed with my dyuyne nature. And so such mynystres when they
consecrate yt blessed body and blood / stonden in ye parsone of my only sone
Ihesu. Thus thou may se and know ye offense which is done to my mynysters /
is done to my sothefaste sone Ihesu / and if it be done to hy^ / it must be
done to me / for he and I be oned together. All such wretches yt parsu my
mynysters / they parsu yt precious blood / and pryue themself fro yt tresour
and fruit of yt precious blood / whereby thou may know that the offense so
done to me is more grievous than any other sin. For if all the sins yt ever
they did stood up on yt one side of them / and this sin alone upon yt other
side / this sin should more grieve me than all other sins. Thus than for to
give ye cause to sorrow and have compassyon of my offense / and of dampnacyon
of such miserable wretches / I have declared the how and in what wise I am
offended / that throw ye sorrow and bytternesse both of thyselfe and also of
other of my servants by my goodness and mercy / such wretches may be
known in their own derkenesse / so put out fro the body of holy church /
orelles the sooner may be recounseyled to grace / for I find no manner person
that soroweth verily of the parsecucyon which is done to my precious blood / I
find ynowe that contynually do smite me with arowes of vnordynate love and
seruyle dread / and with their own propre reputacyon / as though they were
bly^defelde / did arecte to their own worship / such as is to them great
shame and reprefe / and that that is to the^ worship / they turn to shame and
reprefe / as is for to meke them and low the^. Here god speaks against them
ye do parsecucyo^ to holy church / and of the mynysters of holy church i^
diverse manners. TAkes you not head yt I said they smite me (sothe it is) i^
asmoche as they parsu my mynysters / they smite me by their intent i^ asmoche
as they can or may. I say not yt I may in myself receive any manner hurt of
the^ / but I do as a stone ye which wha^ it is smytte / it receives no stroke
nor hurt of the^ / but it tourneth again against the smyter / in ye same wise
the smiting of their offenses which is thrown to me may not noye me. But ye
venemousnesse of syn^e tourneth again to the^ / ye which syn^e in this life
pryueth them fro grace / and also they lose ye fruit of that precious blood /
and at the last if they amend them not with holy confession and co^trycyon of
heart / they should go to end less dampnacyon out fro me / and coupled with
fendes without end / and that copulacyon between fendes and the^ is begone i^
this world. For as soon as a soul is depryued fro graces / anon it is
bound in sin / you which is the bond of hate of virtue and love of vices /
ye which bo^de they have put in the fendes hondes with fre choice / and with
ye same bond the fend byndeth them / for otherwise may they not be bound
with the same bond / the parsuers of my blood be bound together / for as
me^bres coupled to ye fend / they take upon the^ the offices of ye fend.
Fendes be about in all that they may for to vex my creatures / and for to
withdraw them fro grace / and bring them to the offense of deedly sins /
that of the same evil that they have of themself / they entyse creatures in
the same. In ye same wise all such that be like to sendes and be as deuylles
members / ouerturnen the children of my spouse / yt is the children of my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / dyssoluynge them fro ye bond of charity / and byndynge
the^ with the wretched bond of sin / so depryued fro the fruit of my sons
blood / and that bond is knytte with the chain of pride / and with their own
propre reputacyo^ with ye bo^de of seruyle dread / ye which for dread and
loss of temporal goods they lose grace and fall in to more co^fusyon and
shame than they might fall in before / or they were depryued fro the dygnyte of
my sons blood. This bo^de is seyled with ye seyle of derkenes / for they know
not in to how many inconuenyences and wretchednesses they be fall / and so make
other to fall in the same / and therefore they amend them not / nor correcke
them not / because they do not know how for derkenes / for as blind folk
they joy both of their da^pnacyon of soul and body. Be sorrowful daughter
therefore / for to se such blyndenesse and wretchedness in such as be washed
in that precious blood (as thou art) and ben noryshed with ye same blood at ye
breast of holy church / and now as enuyous folk for seruyle dread / and under
color of correccyon of defautes of my mynystres / of ye which I have forbid
them yt they should not touch the^ / they be withdraw fro that holy breast.
Wherefore trembling and dread should both occupy the and my other servants /
when thou here is that wretched bond named. Thy tongue were not suffycye^t to
tell how vile it is to me / and yet worst of al it is y they will cover
themself with the ma^tell of correccyon of defautes of my mynysters / wenynge
thereby y they hyde their own defautes / and they think not that there may no
mantell hyde fro my syghte onythy^ge / they may well hyde them fro yt eye of a
creature / but not fro me / for there is nothing hid fro me. I loved you and
knew you or than ye were / and this is one of the causes why deedly
creatutures will not amend their living / for in such they believe not with
ye light of very quycke feythe that I behold the^ / for if they did believe
verily that I beheld their defautes / and that every defaute shall be punyshed
/ like as every good deed shall be rewarded / they should never do somoche
evil as they do / but of that that they had done they would amend them and
mekely ask my mercy / and than I with the mean of my sons blood shall
grant them mercy / but they be as obstynate folk and reprobate folk fro my
endelesse goodness / and they be^ fall in to the vttermoste fall yt they might
fall in / depryued fro light by their own defautes / and they be made as
blind folk parsuers of my blood / ye which should not be for no defaute that
is done of my mynysters / which do mynystre the mysteri of my sons precious
blood. A short repetycyo^ of yt yt is said before / of holy church and of yt
mynystres. I Have somewhat told ye dear daughter of the reverence which should
be done to my mynystres (not withstondy^de their defautes) for ye reverence is
not done nor ought not to be done to them for them / but for the auctoryte that
I have given to them. And also I have told ye that the mystery of the
sacrament may not be divided nor lessed for no defaute that they do / and
therefore shall no reverence be mynushed another made less anendes them / for it
is not done for the^ / but for ye tresour of the blood that I have given in to
their keeping. The contrary of this have I showed the how grievous it is and how
it dyspleseth me / and what harm it is to them / ye irreverence and
parsecucyon of my sons blood. I also have told the of the bond that they
make against me / and how so ybounde they serve the fend / that thou may have
ye more co^passyon. Lo this is one defaute that I have told the in special
for the parsecucyon of holy church / and the same wise generally I say the of
cryste^ relygyon ye which do dwell in deedly sin / and despise yt blood of my
sone Ihesu / depryuynge themself fro the life of grace. In this wise it
dyspleaseth me yt grievous sin. Of the excellence and virtues / and of the
holy wetkes of virtues and holy mynystres / and how they have the condycyon of
ye son / and of the correccyons to their subjects. NOw shall I give the a
little refresshynge to thy soul / I shall swage ye sorrow of derkenes of these
wretched subjects with the holy living of my mynystres / of whom I said to
the they have the condycyon of the son / for with the odor of their holy
virtue / the stynkynge fylthe of their wretchyd living is swaged / and the
derkenesse of them is swaged with their light. Open therefore the eye of thy
intelleccyon / and behold in me the light or the son of ryghtewysenesse /
and thou shall se my glorious mynysters how they mynystre by mynystracyon of the
son that they mynystre / they take upon them the condycyon of ye son (as
Peter the prince of all the apostles) that receyuen the keys of heaven. And
right so of other that in the holy orcherde of holy church mynystred light /
that is the body and the blood of my only sone Ihesu / and also the
sacraments of holy church which auaylen greatly / and given life in virtue
of that precious blood / each of them be set and put in diverse degrees after
the state of their calling / for to mynystre the grace of ye holy ghost.
Wherewith have they mynystred? Certain with the light of grace which they have
take out of this very light / is that light alone. Nay? For ye light of
grace may not be alone / nor it may not be departed / but it must needs other
be hole (or not) and he that is in deedly sin / is depryued fro that light
of grace / and he that has grace / has the eye of intelleccyon illumyned /
in knowing me that have both given him grace and virtue / the which virtue
conserueth and keeps that grace / and in ye light he knows wretchedness of
sins and causes of them (that is the propre sencyble love) and therefore he
hates it / and so by haty^ge / he receives also the het^ of dyuyne charity in
his affection / which affection renewed after intelleccyon / he receives also
the hete of this glorious light / she wynge the doctrine of my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu / Whereby his mind is reformed to remember him of the
benefytes of his precious blood of my sone Ihesu / and he may not have one
power of the soul fulfilled in receyuynge of me very son / but if he have
all three / whereby that they be set in order / and gadered together in my name.
For as soon as the eye of intelleccyon aryseth him with the light of feythe
for to se sencyble himself beholdynge in me / anon affection re^ueth after /
loving ye thing which the eye of intelleccyon sees and knows / and also
the mind is fulfilled with the same thing that affection loves. And than
anon when they be dysposed / they taken part of me endelesse son / and so
they be illumyned in my power / and in ye wisdom of my only sothefast sone
Ihesu / and in the myldenes of of the fire of the holy ghost. And thus thou
may know that they have take upon them the condycyo^ of the son (that is to
say) they be arrayed with me yt am yt very son / and they do as the son.
The son heteth and yllumyneth and with his hete / it makes the earth for to
bry^ge forth fruit. In the same wise my devout ministers chose^ / anointed /
and send in to the mysteryal body of holy church by me / do mynystre me that
am very son / that is ye body and blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu with
other sacraments / which receive life of this sacrament. They do mynystre
that sacrament of the auter actually / for they given light in the mysteryall
body of holy church / which is light above natural cu^nynge / that is
called cu^nynge above kind / with honest living and holy showing of ye
doctrine of my sothefaste sone / and so they do mynystre heet of bre^nynge
charity / with the which brenny^ge charity / they make barayne souls to
burgyon flowers of virtue / yllumynynge them with the light of virtue and
cu^nynge / and which their holy ordynate and well ruled living / they put away
derkenesse of deedly sins and much infydelyte. And also they set in rule
the life of the^ that live unruly / that also live in derkenesse of sins /
and in dulnes of pryuacyon of charity. Thus you may know yt they be ye son /
for they have take upon the^ ye co^dycyo^ of the son / of me yt am very son
/ and by affection of love they be one with me and I with them / as I have told
the in another place. Each of them after their state and lyuy^ge (as I have
chosen them) do give light i^ holy church. Peter gave light with his
techynge and prechyng^ and at the last by shedy^ge of his blood. Gregory with
his cu^nynge and declaracyon of holy write / and also with the myrrour of holy
living. Syluester gave light in holy church when he dysputed against the
paynyms / so bringing in by dysputacyon / and light / and prefe of holy
feythe among them / the which he showed to the both by his words and by
his deeds. If thou turn yt to Austyn and to glorious Thomas / or to Jerome /
or to other doctors / you shall se how much light they have send i^ to my
spouse holy church (dystroynge errors) as lanternes set on high upon a
ca^delstycke / with very parfyte mekenes. And as they that hongre my worship
and honor and also health of souls / that very meet with great delight they
ete upon the table of the blessed cross. Martyrs also with their blood
shedynge / which blood in my sight gave right sweet smell and brought in
light with virtue i^ to my spouse holy church. They spredde abroad the feythe
/ and they that were in derkenesse came to the light of feythe / and in the^
the light of feythe did shine. Prelates also set in the state of prelacy by
my only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / he being i^ earth yielded to me with
holy honest living the sacryfyce of ryghtewysenesse / the ghostly precious
stone of Margaryte / that is called the Margaryte of ryghtewysenesse / the
ghostly precious stone shyned in them and in their subjects with very
meekness / bre^nynge charity / and light of dyscrecyon in the^ pryncypally
right wisely they yelde^ to me my de we dewte / that is glory and laud to my
name. To the^ they yield hate and dysplesaunce of their own propre sensualyte
/ dyspysynge vices and taking virtue with the charity of me and of their
neighbor / with meekness they despise pride / and as angels they went to ye
auter with purete both of heart and of body / and so with great clennes of soul
they said their masses / right fervently brennynge in the oven of charity /
and because they did ryghtwysenesse of themself / therefore afterward all they
did in the same wise ryghtewysenesse to their subiertes / for to make the^ to
live virtuously. They did blame them without seruyle dread / when they were
blame worthy / for they behold nothing to themself / but only to my worship
and health of souls / as good curates suers of my sothefaste sone Ihesu / that
is the high sovereign curate whom I have give to you for to govern you ye be
beestes / and he gave his life for you. All such curates do follow the steps
of him / wherefore they do correcke and will not suffer stynky^ge me^dres to
grow in holy church without correccyon / but charitably with that oyntmente
of benygnyte / and with sharpness of fire curtynge the wou^des of their
defautes away / by vndernymynge and penance much or little after the
greatenesse of the sin. And for such correccyon so truly and feythe fully
done for yt love of me / they did not fere for to dye. These were very
gardyners / that with great business and holy dread pulled up the thorns of
deedly sins / and they did plant the pla^tes of sweet virtue / whereby ye
subietes did live in very holy dread / and they did encrese virtuously / as by
smelling of flowers in the mysteryal body of holy church. And because there
was in their curates no veny^ of deedly sin / therefore they did keep holy
ryghtewysenesse / and without any seruyle dread / they undertook their syntull
subiecces myghtely. This was and is ye very Margaryte / ye which gave both
pease and light in to the souls of reasonable creatures / and made them to
stand stydfastly in holy dread / their hertes were one in me / and each of
them together in very charity / wherefore I will that thou know yt there was
never nothing that brought in somoche derkenesse and dyuysyo^ in to the world
between seculers and relygyous clerks and curates of holy church / as has
the derkenesse of vnryghtful living / by the which the light of
ryghtewysenesse defayleth. There may no state be kept another in temporal law
/ nor in dyuyne law / wtoute holy right wysenesse. For he that is not blamed /
nor vndernome fro his trespass of his curate / he begy^neth ^or to wax a
stynkynge member of the body of holy church / upon the which member if a
leche ye is a curate of holy church lay on oyntement of soft and easy
speaking / and does not search first the wound by represe and vndernymy^ge /
ye wound waxes corrupt by encrese of his deedly sin / and so roteth all the
body of holy church / but it be the sooner cut a way and deperted therfro.
And if he be a true and a good curate of souls / as other glorious curates of
souls have be before / he will not lay an oyntme^t of soft and easy speaking
/ without the fire of blaming / and if ye membre were all obstynate i^ his
evil work / than he will cut hy^ away fro the co^gregacyon of holy church
/ lest he enfecte other with the stynke of deedly sins. Curates as these
days done not so / but they feyne and will not se defautes of their subjects.
Knows you not why? Certain for ye root of their own propre love leueth in
the^ / for ye which they have take a wicked cowherdes dread / for by tere of
losing of their state or te^porall goods or prelacy / they will not correcke
defautes (or dare not) but they to as blind men do / and therefore how their
state should be kept (they know not) for if they wyste how it should be kept
with holy right wysenes / they would keep it to ye uttermost. But for because
they be depryued fro light / therefore they do know not how they should keep
it / they be dysceyued of their own propre sencyble pass^^n / and of desire of
domynacyo^ of prelacy / and also they correcke not defautes of other / for they
themself be gylty i^ ye same or greter / and therefore they lose both sykernes
and boldenes / and be bound i^ ye bo^de of seruyle dread / by the which they
myll not se wha^ they may se / but suffer the^ ^o te^ne forth in their sins.
In the^ is co^plete ye words of my sothefast sone Ihesu / where he says in ye
gospel. Such curates be bly^de and leders of bly^de folk / and if ye bly^de
led yt blind / both fall in to ye dyche. Thus they did not that sometime were
curates (such as I have rehearsed before) nor yet done some ye live now /
such as be my very true mynysters / for they have ye very properte of ye son
/ for in the^ is no derkenesse of deedly sin nor of ygnoraunce / in asmoche
as they do follow the doctrine of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu. Nor they be
not dull / for they be all bre^ned in ye oue^ of my charity / and be dyspysers
of states and domynacyo^s in themself / and other delices of ye world. They
fere not for to vndernyme when / ye time is / for he that desires no benefyce
nor prelacy / is never aferde for to lose it / but myghtyly vndernymeth. He ye
feleth not himself in his conscience repreued by sin (fereth not) and
therefore this derke Margaryte was not / nor is not in my very true mynysters /
but i^ the^ it is shynynge / the which makes them to desire pouerte wylfully
/ when they make search with very meekness / and therefore they do not fere
storms / repreues / detraccyons of men / Iniuryes / peynes / and turmentes /
they were cursed of men wrongefully / and of such as had no auctoryte for to
curse them / and they blessed again / and they did suffer their wrongefull
cursynge / and with very pasyence as heavenly angels and more than angels (not
in kind) but by the mystery and great grace given to them above kind / for
to mynystre the body and the blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ
crucyfyed on ye cross / and in sothe they be very angels / for as an angel
which I give to keep you / he mynystreth holy and good virtues / and right so
my mynysters be angels / and therefore contynually they set their eye upon their
subjects as very gardyners / brethy^ge in ye hertes of their subjects good
works and holy / offrynge for the^ swear desires and merry i^ my syghte by
co^tynuall prayer with the doctrine of my only sothefast sone Ihesu / and with
ensample of good living. Thus may thou se that they be angels set of my
bre^ny^ge charity / as lanterns in ye mysteryall body of holy church for your
keeping and health / that ye blind may have a leder ye may led you in to the
way of truth / brethynge to you virtuous living. They dread never / that
another to the^ nor to their subjects shall fail temporal substance / in
asmoche as they do live ymonge them / with very meekness / hope / and feythe /
and therefore with largeness they do depart to the poor men / the temporal
substance of holy church. And so they did keep to ye full / that y they
should keep and do / for asmoche as they did depart the temporal substance
of holy church to the need and necessyte of pore me^ i^ holy church. They did
not keep no tresour of temporal goods / for to depart to poor men after
their dysceyses. But there were many of them that for largeness that they did
to poor me^ / left their chyrches in debt / and yt was for the great
charity and hope that they had in my prouyde^ce. They avoided fro them all
seruyle dread / and therefore they were aferde of no lacking / another spyrytual
nor temporal. This is a very token yt my creature hops in me and not in
himself / in asmoche as he dredeth not by seruyle dread / but all such that
hope^ in themself / drede^ their own shadow / and ever they think that
heaven and earth will fail them. With yt dread and yt wicked hope that they
put in their little feeling / they take so great wretched besynes upon them in
getting of remporal goods and in keeping thereof / that they put behind them
as it seemed all ghostly goods / and uneath is there any found yt charge
those goods. But such proud vnfeythful wretches / think not alone that I am
he that provide and ordeyne for all in dew times both for bodies and souls /
though it so be that with the same mesure y they hope wtin me / with ye same
shall be yield to you my prouydence and godly ordinance. All such
presumptuous wretches behold not verily / that I am he that am / and they be
they that be not / here being they receive of my endelesse goodness / and
they receive thereto grace above their bey^ge. And therefore he laboreth in vain
yt keeps his Cyte^ / but it were keep with me and for me / all his labor is in
vain / if he think by his labor or desynes for to defend himself without
me / for I am he alone that keeps hy^ (and sothe it is) yt the being and ye
grace that is set above the being of you / I will that in time ye excercyce it
in virtue / using fre choice yt I have given you with light of reason / for I
have made you without you / but without you I may not save you. I loved you or
that ye were / and that my well beloved mynynsters do know and say right
well. Wherefore wo^derly of ye love that they had with so great largeness they
did hope in me / and they had no dread in nothing. Syluester dredde not wha^
he stood before the emperor Constantyne / dysputynge with the twelve Jews
before a great company / but by feythe he byleued as long as I was with him /
there might none be against him / and all my other mynysters did after the same
manner. They were never alone / but they had the felyshyp of me / in asmoche
as they did stand and dwell in me by love of charity / and of me they sought
the light of wisdom / yt is of my only sothefast sone Ihesu. Of me in sothe
they did take might / and being strong and mighty against prynees and
tyrauntes of the world / and also of me they had the fire of ye holy ghost.
This love in them was and is felyshypped to him that will part with other / with
light of feythe / with hope / and stre^gthe / with very pease / and with long
perseuerau^ce / in to ye last end of yt death. Thus you may know that they be
not alone (but they be felyshypped) and therefore they be not aferde. Only he
that feleth himself without me (hoping in himself) and depryued fro the love
of charity dredeth / and every little thing makes him aferde / in asmoche as
he is depryued fro me / which give great sykernes to su^the a soul namely
that has me by affection of love. They prove this well that be my well beloved
children / there may nothy^ge noye their souls / but they themsefe noye
fendes / and often times they be left bound / and may not complete the malice
/ for the virtue and stre^gthe that I have given to them / to work upon such
fendes. Thy tongue is not suffycyent to tell the virtues of them / nor the eye
of thy intelleccyon for to behold the fruit yt they receive in ever lasty^ge
life. They be as precious stones / and so they dwell in my syghte / for I have
received their labor / and the light that they have send in with odor of
virtue in to ye mysteryall body of my spouse holy church / and therefore I have
set the^ in endelesse life ye never shall fail / and in great dygnyte ymonge
ye ordres of angels. And they also receive blessydnes and joy in my meruaylous
sight / for they gave ensample of honest living / and with light they did
mynystre the light of my only sothefaste sons body and blood / and also
other sacraments. And therefore syngulerly they be much loved of me / not
only because they have mynystred my tresoure with meekness and all other
virtues which I have put i^ their hondes / but because they did cease never to
reduce and bring in beestes yt were lost to the field of holy church / as
good shepeherdes or curates should do. For they did dyspose them for ho^gre and
health of souls / by affection of love to dye for souls / yt they might
thereby pull out souls out of the fendes danger. They were seek with seek men
/ that they should not fall to dyspayre / they did weep also with wepers / and
ioyed with ioyers. And so swetely they do covet to give to each soul meet of his
health by co^passyon and ioyfulnesse / conseruynge them that were good by
ioyenge of their virtuous living / and confortynge them therein / they freted
not themself not with envy for their own good living / but they were large
in charity to me and to all their subjects / and they yt were enfected / they
drew out charitably of their defautes / making themself virtuously full of
fautes / and seek with the^ (as I have said before) and so with holy and very
co^passyon / with charytable correccyon and penance for their defautes / they
bare penance with them / that is for the love that they had to their souls /
they bare more pain on themself by compassyon than they did receive of them /
and sometime there were some of the^ that would bear the same penance that they
bare actually / and namely when they saw that their penance was hard to them
and so deedly / and so shortly the penance yt they bare was turned to them in
to swetnes. All such mynysters when they were made prelates / they would
sometime make themself subicctes / and sometime servants wha^ they were lords
/ and sometime (as I said) they would make them by compassyon like old people
/ and wha^ they were strong and mighty / they made themself feeble ymonge
feeble / with fools and right simple people / they showed themself simple /
and so with all manner of people by meekness and charity they couthe led their
lives and give each of them meet. But who did this? Certain the honger of
desire that they did conceive in me / of my worship and health of souls.
They ran for to ete ye blessed meet / upon the table of my blessed sone Ihesu
christ on ye cross / eschewynge no manner labor / but as lovers of souls and
good curates of holy church / for the spredy^ge abroad of holy feythe / they
went ymonge thorns of many try bulacyo^s / and they punyshed themself with
very pasyence / offering to me encens of love longing / and sweet smelling
desires of meke and co^tynual prayer / with weeping and waylynge. And so they
anointed the wounds of their neighbors sores (ye is to say) the wounds of
deedly synses / by the which anoyntynge they were made parfytely hole / if
they with meekness did receive such denoute oyntementes. A repetycyon of
words said before / and of the reverence that shall be done to priests /
whether they be good or badde. NOw my dear daughter I have showed to the a
lyted sparcle of the excellence of them. I call it a sparcle in comparyson of
that excellence that is with me in heaven of them. I have also told unto the
of their dygnyte and worthynesse / in ye which dygnyte I have put the^ s^che
as I have chosen to my special mynysters / and of that dygnyte and auctoryte
that I gave them / I will not that for no defaute yt they done / they be
touched by the hondes of seculer men in vyole^ce / for if they so touch the^ /
they offend me meruaylously. But I will that they have them in dew reverence
(not for themself) but for me / that is for the auctoryte that I have given
them / and that reverence should never be mynyshed / though virtue be mynyshed
in them. I told yt also of virtuous mynysters and of their virtues / for I
said they be mynysters of the son / yt is is of the body and the blood of my
only sothefast sone Ihesu. And also they be mynysters of all other sacraments
/ for that dygnyte touches and lo^geth both to good mynysters and to bad /
each of the^ may do yt mynystracyon. I said to the also yt they that be such
blessed mynysters / have ye condycyo^ of the son / yllumynynge and hetynge by
the love of charity their neighbors / and with yt hete they make verrues to
bur^owne and grow in the souls of their subjects. I said also to yt / yt
they were angels ordained of me for your keeping / for to keep you and brethe
i^ you to your holy co^uersacyo^ of lyuy^ge perfyte prayers and doctrine with the
myrrour of good living / and also yt they may serve you / mynystry^ge to you
ye holy sacraments. Thus you may se how much they be worthy for to be beloved
/ and i^ what reverence they should be had / for every virtuous minyster is
worthy to be beloved and had in reverence / ^or yt auctoryte y they have of me
in mynystrynge of ye sacraments of holy church. And so for their virtue and
dygnyte they should he loved / and their defautes should be hated ye lyue^
wretchedly / yet should ye not make your self Judges (for I will not yt)
because they be my mynysters anointed. Ye know well yt if an unclean man and
ill arrayed should bry^ge to you fro a great lord a worthy tresour / of the
which tresour ye must take gladly / what for ye love of ye tresour and ye
lord yt send it / ye will not hate ye bry^ger / though he be torn and
ragged. I trow ye would besy you for reverence of the lord with all your might
to wasshe or avoid away his uncleanness / and hy^ to array more better. Right
so should ye do after ye order of charity and of dewete to such unworthy
mynysters / and I will yt ye do so to such unworthy mynysters / yt with
uncleaness and torn clothes of vices departed fro charity / bry^ge to you
great tresours / yt is holy sacraments of holy church / of ye which
sacraments / ye receive life of grace / though they be in so great defautes /
of ye which ye receive the^ mekely for ye love of me endeles god / whom I
send to you for to mynystre ye sacraments / as I have said. Their defautes
should be dysplesynge to you / and ye should with all your might charitably with
holy prayer array the^ again in vertuos lyuy^ge / and wash with teeres their
uncleanness away fro them / that is offer them up to me with weeping and
waylynge and holy desire / that I may array the^ again of my endelesse
goodness with ye vesture of charity. Ye know well that I will show and do to
them grace / so that they will dyspose the^ for to receive it / and that ye
also dyspose you for to beseech me and pray me for them / for it is not my will
that they mynystre to you my gracyous son (as I have said) in derkenesse /
nor that they be naked fro ye clothe of virtue / nor yt they be unclean by
dyshonest living / but I have put them to you as angels i^ earth / and as my
son yt should give light. Thus should ye pray for them to me / and not for
to Judge the^ / but suffer me to hane the Judgment of them / and I by your
prayers if they will receive mercy / I shall give them mercy / and if they will
in nowyse correcke the^ i^ this life / ye dygnyte that they have shall turn
them to great harm / for with great reprefe i^ the end of their death /
they shall be send of me to endeles pain / if as I said they amend them not
in their living and receive not the largeness of my mercy. And of the deeds
and wicked life of evil priests / and evil mynysters. NOw take heed dear
daughter / to the end that thou and other of my servants may have more
matter to offer for them to me meke and contynual prayer / I will show the the
wretched living of the^. They that be wicked what ever side thou turn the /
be they seculers or relygyous clerks or prelates / small or great / young or
old / in what manner of kind they stand in ever thou shall find sin and
offenses / and all they cast to me fylthe of deedly sins / and yet that
fylthe hurts not me nor defouleth me / but it defouleth themself. Behold
daughter like as I have told to the the virtuous living of my chosen
mynysters / so now I tell the ye wretched lyuy^ge of wicked mynysters / to make
the have ruthe and compassyon of them / and also to make the to know what
peynes they be worthy to have / like as good mynysters be worthy endeles joy /
that is for to be set in my syghte for ever more / as ghostly margaryte
stones / and yt contrary shall be done to such wretched ministers / for they
shall receive cruel peynes. Knows thou not my dear daughter with sorrow and
bytternesse of thy heart where they have set their begy^ny^ge and ground?
Certain they have set their beginning and ground of sin in their own
propre love / by the which propre love / the tree of pride is sprunge in them
with leaves of vndyscrecyon / for as indiscreet folk they take upon them and
arecte to themself great glory of the world / and they search for hye
prelaces with arayme^tes and delyces of their bodies. To me they do yield
reprefe and blame / so they yield to themself that is not theyrs / and to me
that is not mine / for to me should be yield glory and praysynge / and to the^
should be yielded hate of their own propre sensualyte / with very knowledge of
themself / holding themself unworthy for to have such mynystracyon as they
have received of me / but they do the contrary for they be proud and may not
be fulfilled with no worldeli good / but ever they frete ye earth of worldely
richesse / strayte / covetous / and full of injury / against their neighbors.
And by such wretched pride and injury that they take of their own se^cyble
love / they leave cure of souls / and put them for to keep only temporal
goods / and so send out my beestes which they have in kepy^ge / as sheep
with out a shepeherde / for they another feed them nor noryshe them bodyly nor
ghostly. For all be it that they mynystre to you ghostly the sacraments of
holy church / yet they feed you not ghostly with hertly prayer / with the
hongre and desire of health of your souls / nor yet with holy and honest
living. And also they feed not their subjects temporally with and mporall
goods / as poor folk and such other nedy folk / whose substance of
te^porall goods (as I have said the) should be divided i^ to three parts / one
to the necessyte and releuynge of their one need / another to poor folk / and
ye shyrde to the profit of the church. They do not thus / but they do the
contrary / all that good which they should departe^o poor people (as they be
bound) they do spend it in Symony / and so they sell the grace of the holy
ghost / for winning of benefyces. And of these curates some be so wretched /
yt in no wise they will give to the poor of the substance of te^porall goods
/ such as I h^^e given to the^ / but ever they look for to have of their
subjects. And so much they love their subjects / as they receive te^porall
goods of the^ / and no more. All the goods of holy church they spend in
none otherwise / than about bodyly araymentes and delycate clothes / not as
clerks and relygyous folk / but as lords and courtyers. And they besy
themself for to have formal horses / much silver / vessels / and cups of
gold / with other curyous araymentes of houses / keeping and unright wisely
holdy^ge such thing as they should not hold / with much vanyte of heart /
and often time ymonge such vanytes / their heart speaks and thinks
vnornately / euerdesyry^ge (as never sacyate) more and more. And all theye
desires is in festes or diverse / making to themself a god of their wombes /
etynge and drinking out of time as very gloto^s. Alas alas of such miserable
and wretchedfull living / for that only my sweet sothefaste sone Ihesu christ
has purchased with great pain upon the cross / they spend it with open
comune women. They be deuourers of souls that my sone Ihesu christ bought with
his precious blood / devouring and spyllynge the same souls / with very much
wretchedde living in many manner wyses / and of that good that should long to
poor folk / they do feed and nory she their own children. O you temples of
the devil / I ordained you as angels in earth / and you have co^formed and made
youreselfe deuylles / for ye do the service of deuylles / such derkenes as
they have / they given forth and they mynystre also cruel tourmentry. They
withdraw souls from grace with many diverse temptacyons / so for to bry^ge
them in to deedly sins (yt is to say) they do what they may for to bry^ge a
soul to deedly sin / though it so be yt no soul may fall in to deedly
sin / but if it consent thereto. Right so done all such wretched mynysters
which be not worthy to be called my mynysters / for they be deuylles incarnate
/ in asmoche as they be conformed in will to the condycyon of deuylles / and
therefore they done and fulfill their offices / mynystrynge me that am very
light with derkenesse of deedly sins / and so they mynystre me cursedly to
their subjects / and to other reasonable creatures. Lo thus you may know how
they mynystre confusyon / shame / and pain / in to the souls of their
subjects / the whiche^ subjects se them and behold them how they live
vnordynately / withdrawy^ge them fro the state of grace and way of truth /
and ledynge their subjects in to grievous sins / by ensample of their wicked
lyuy^ge. And yet there shol de no subject follow them in sin / nor behold to
the evil deeds yt they done / but do as my only sothefaste sone Ihesu says
in ye gospel / yt is for to do as they do se by prechynge and techynge my
doctrine of holy church / such doctrine as they have learned by doctors of
holy write / and eschewynge their evil living / nor follow the^ not therm /
nor punyshe them not therefore / for so should ye of send me / but leave you
their evil lyuy^ge and follow their wholesome doctrine. For I am sweet god and
endelesse / that reward all good / and punyshe all evil / I spare not for to
punyshe the^ for their dygnyte because they be my mynystres / but I do punyshe
such when they trespass so of malice more grievously tha^ I do other (but if
they amend them) for they have received of my goodness more tha^ other / and
therefore wha^ they trespass maliciously / they be worthy more pain tha^
another. Thus you may know and se yt such wicked mynysters be deuylles / as I
have showed yt / / like as my chosen mynysters be angels in earth / doing
the offices of angels. How vnryghtwysenes reyneth i^ ill mynysters / and in
the^ specially yt correcke not their subjects. I Said to the that in my
chosen mynysters shyneth a ghostely Margaryte stone of ryghtwysenes / right so
these wretched mynysters bear in their breasts vnryghtewysenesse / which
vnryghtwysenesse comes out of their own propre love / for by yt propre love
they do vnryghtwysenes bot he against their own souls and also against me with
de rknes of vndyscrecio^. They yield me no thanks / and to the^ they yield no
honest / good lyuy^ge / nor desire of health of souls / nor hongre of virtue /
and there fore they trespass i^ vnryghtwysenes against their subtectes and
neighbors / and they direct no defaute / but they be as blind folk that will
not know their defautes for vnordynate dread y they have / for because they
would dysplease creatures / and in such wise they suffer them for to sleep and
ly still in their own sickness. They consydre not that all those which will
please creatures in such wise / they dysplease both themsefe and me that am
their maker. And other while they do correcke the less defaute / because they
would cover themself with a mantell of excusacyo^ for doing of such little
ryghtwysenesse / but they will not correcke the more defaute in greter persons
/ for dread that they have in losy^ge of their state / or therselfe / or their
benefyce. All other less persons that may not noye them / nor disease them /
nor withdraw their benefyce or state fro them / they do correct. This
vnryghtwysenes is done with their own propre wretched love / for a man's
propre love enuenymeth all the worse / and the mysteryall body of all holy
church / and has made the orcharde of this spouse wild / and has arrayed
it with stynkynge flowers / the which orcharde was renewed / when my very true
tyllers (yt is my mynysters yt be holy) were therein with many sweet flowers / for
ye life of subjects were not enuenymed than by ye wretched living of curates
/ for often time it happeth yt of wicked curates / subjects be also wicked. But
now this spouse holy church is full of diverse thorns (yt is of all manner
sins) not for it may receive in her the stynke of sins / for the virtue of
ye holy sacraments may receive no hurt / but all those wretches that feden
themself at ye breast of this spouse / receive in their soul the stynky^ge
fylthe of sin / putting away fro them the worthy dygnyte that I set them
in. Not for ye dygnyte of the^ should decrese / but for their wretched defautes
/ the blood of my sone is set little by / that is seculer men put away dew
reverence / though they should not do so / that they should do to them for
reverence of that blood / and yet if they do to them no dew reverence as they
ought for to do (not withstondynge their wretchyd living) their sin is the
more / nevertheless these wretches be to the^ a myrroure of wretchedness /
there they should be a myrroure of virtue. Of many other defautes of yt
foresaid mynystres / and specially of going to tauerns / and of their vain
plays / and of holding of their concubynes. AS you thynkes whereby receives ye
souls of such wretchyd mynisters such fylthe of syn^e? Certain of their
own propre sensualyte / for they have made their own sensualyte a lady with
their own propre love / and their own soul they have made a tapster.
Notwithstondynge that / first I made this soul fre / with the precious blood of
my only sothefast sone Ihesu at the general delyueraunce / wha^ all mankind
was delivered out of ye deuylles bondage and of his domynacyon. This grace
received every reasonable creature / but all those that I have anointed to my
specyal mynysters / I have delivered out of worldely bondage / and put them
only for to serve me endelesse god / and for to mynystre the sacraments of
holy church / and I have made the^ so fre / that I will not that no temporal
lord Judge the^. And now thou sees dear daughter how they yield me again for
the good deed yt I have do to the^ / the reward that they give me again is
this / that every day they parsu me in right many and diverse cursed sins /
yt thy tongue can not tell them / and if you herd them thou might not suffer
them. Nevertheless somewhat shall I tell the of their defautes / above that I
have told the / yt thou may have the more cause of co^passyon and waylynge.
They should stand at the table of my holy cross / there for to be fed with
holy desire / and to be noryshed with the meet of souls for my love / and
though all creatures that have reason should do ye same / yet much more my
mynysters whom I have chosen for to mynystre to you ye body and the blood of
my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / and that also they give to you ensamsample of
holy living. And so by showing the doctrine of my sothefast sone Ihesu with
holy desire / they should receive hongre of the health of your souls / but
they do no we ye contrary / fro the table of the cross / they enter to the
table of tauernes / there they swear and forswere them openly / and done many
other defautes / being so blinded without light of reason. They be also in deed
light and desolate fro there / and what their office is (they know it not)
and if any time they should say their service / it is is said rather with the
mouth than with ye heart / for ye heart is fer fro thense. They be also
trecherers and venyable rybaudes / and reuelers / and after time they have thus
played with their souls in cursed living / and so put it to the fendes hondes /
tha^ they play the temporal goods and substance of holy church / by the
which poor folk should be releued / and to is holy church begyled / and
poor men defrauded / and it is no wondre / for because they themself be made
the deuylles temples / therefore they fere nothing my temple / but that same
arayment that they should do in my temple / and in church for the reverence of
my sons blood / they do^u in their houses where they do dwell. And the worste
of all is / that they with the goods of holy church array their concubynes /
as an husband would array his wife / so these incarnate deuylles of holy
church goods array their deuylles / that is their co^cubynes / with whom they
live uncleanly and wyckedly / and without shame they make them go stand and come
i^ to yt church / whiles they be at ye auter. They take no thought though
their wretched deuylles do come to their hondes with other children of holy
church / for to offer as other folk done. O ye fendes / and yet more than
fendes / ye should at ye of^e hyde your sins in ye syghte of your subjects
/ for if ye hyde it / yt offense is to me alone / and the harm to yourselfe.
But now ye do evil to your neighbors for to give the^ such ensamples of
cursed lyuy^ge / throw your ensample / they fall in to ye same sins or
greter. This also is another wickedness yt they use / they arise erly by the
morrow / with a defouled soul and a corrupt body that has layen all night
in deedly syn^e / they go and say mass. O deuylles tabernacle / where is the
watch of the night that should be waked with devotion and dyuyne service /
where is contynual prayer and devout in the which you should dyspose ye
ane^des time / for ye mystery yt thou should do on the morrow / with knowledge
of thyselfe to know thyselfe unworthy to that office / and also with knowledge
of me / for of my goodness I have made ye a mynyster / not by thy deseruynge
and merytes / but for my goodness I have ordained the a mynyster for to
mynystre to my creatures the sacraments of holy church. How the syn^e against
kind reyneth in some of ye foresaid mynysters / and of a fair vysyon which
the soul had upon this matter. Dear daughter I make the know that I require
so great purete of you and of them in this blessed sacrament / as may be
had to man in this life / and therefore asmoche as you may on your side and
on their side / each of you should contynually with all your might win
such purete / and think if it were possible an an^els kind to be puryfyed to
that mystery it were right necessary / but it is not possible / they need not
to be puryfyed / for in them may never fall the venym of sin. This I say
the that thou may know what cle^nesse and purere I require both of you and
of them in this worshypful sacrament / and namely of them that be my mynysters
/ but they do the contrary / for all they be unclean / and no only of uncleanness
and freylte to the which ye be prone and ready of your own freyle nature. But
they wretches be so unclean / yt they do the wicked syn^e against kind / and
as blind fools of their intelleccyon they know not the fylthe and stynkynge
wretchedness that they be in. And it dyspleaseth not only me that am
endelesse purete / the which sin is so abhomynable to me / that for ye sin
by my Judgment five Cetees were over turned / for I might not suffer ye vile
stynke of that cursed sin n^ longer / it dysplesed me somoche (and not only
me as I said) but it dyspleseth deuylles (not because the evil does
dysplease the^ / that god should please them) but because their nature was
sometime angels nature / and therefore that nature escheweth to se yt actual
cursed sin / though it so were that the fend three we first an arowe to them
enuenymed with the venym of concupyssence. But when they come to the dort of
that cursed sin / than he gothe his way for the cause that I have told the /
for if thou remember the I towe ye how that cursed sin sometime before the
incarnacyon myslyked me / for all the world was corrupt tha^ thereof. And tha^
thou lyfted up thy self above thy self with holy desire where I showed the
all the world / and i^ that syghte thou saw that almost every parsone was
corrupt with that wretched sin / and thou knows well that it was so great
a pain to the for to se it / and for to smell the stynke of that sin in thy
soul / that the seemed it should be thy death / for thou did se no place where
thou and other of my servants might sto^de for corrupcyo^ / that this lepre
should not defoule you / nor to enfecte you. Thou did se no place where thou
might sto^de another ymonge small nor great / young nor old / clerks nor
relygyous / prelates nor subjects / lords nor servants / but all these were
defouled both body and soul of this cursed sin. This I showed the tha^ in
general / I tell the not what they be in special / for whose vnryghtwysenesse
/ I withholde yet my ryghtwysenesse / for I command not stones to oppress
the^ / nor the earth to devour them / nor beestes to dystroy them / nor fendes
for to bear them away both body and soul. But I find ways for to show
the^ mercy (if they will amend the^) and for intercessoures between me and
them / I send my servants such as be vndefouled in that cursed sin / and
in all other deedly sins / for to pray for them to me / and otherwhyle I
shall show them such wretched sins for to make them more besy about their
soul hele / and with ye more co^passyon for to offer the^ to me by prayer /
for it is a right cursed syn^e. I showed ye but one sparcle of the sty^ke of
that sin / and you was brought to such a plyte / yt thou might no longer
suffer to bear it / and therefore you said thus to me. O endeles fader have
mercy upon me and on thy creatures / orelles take my soul out of my body / for
I may no more / and therefore refresshe me endeles fader / and show me in what
place I and thy servants may rest us / yt this lepre noye us not / nor take
away fro us purete both of body and of soul. I answered ye thus and turned
to the the eye of my pity (and said) and yet say. Daughter your rest is in
gyuynge to my holy name joy and praysynge / and besy you in that ye can and
may for to throw encens to me of contynuall prayer / for these wretches that
have put themself in somoche wretchedness making themself unworthy to be my
mynysters / (...) yt cursed sin. The place there ye should stand / is christ
crucyfyed my only sothefast sone Ihesu / there should ye dwell / and hyde you
in yt holes of his wou^des / and namely in ye great wound of his side / in the
which wound by affection of love ye should be joyful in that open wound of
my sons heart / ye should find the feruente boylynge charity of me and of
your neighbor / which for the reverence of me the endelesse fader / and for
to fulfill the obedyence that I pu^ to him / and for your salvation and health
/ he ran gladly to the most reprouable death of the cross / by seeing and
tastynge of this love you follow his doctrine / noryshy^ge your self upon the
table of the cross that is with pasyence and charity. Also you should bear
peynes for your neighbor / turment / and labor / in what wise yt ever it
come / in this wise ye should escape and fle that cursed lepre. Thus have I
taught other / but yet this thing has not left thy soul fully fro the
feeling of the stynke of yt syn^e / nor withdraw fro thy eye of intelleccyon
the derkenesse / but my prudence puruayde for the thus / that when you did
receive yt body and ye blood of my sone Ihesu all god and all man / as it is
received in the sacrament of the auter / in token that this is sothe that I
say / the stynke of that cursed sin passed away fro the by receyuynge of
that sacrament / and the derkenesse avoided by the light that thou received in
that sacrament. And so that sacrament bylefte with the in a meruaylous wise /
as it was liking to my goodness for to give ye / for i^ thy mouth bylefte a
savor of that blood / and in the taste of thy body in the same wise many days
suynge / as thou knows well. Lo daughter by this thou may se how abhomynable
this sin is to me of all creatures. Think than that it is more abominable
to me of the^ that be my mynysters / whom I have chosen for to live i^ the
state of contynence / ymonge which chaste mynysters / some there be that (...)
departed fro the world / as relygyous men / as very special plants which be
set in holy church. And ymonge such if there be mynysters of the which thou
may not here / how much more the defaute in the^ dyspleaseth me / for it is
more dyspleasaunce to me that sin in the^ than any other minystre of mine /
which be reherced before / for they should be as light set upon a candelstycke
/ mynysters of my very son i^ light of virtue / and of honest and holy living
/ and they mynystre to me in derkenesse of sin / and they be so derke / that
of holy writ which is yllumyned by my chosen doctors / with the light
above kind (as I have told the before) they be so bolned with pride in ye
cunning thereof / and because they be unclean and rechylesse in wa^tayne
lyuy^ge / they another se nor understand the swetenes thereof / but only the
bare bark of the letter / and so they read it with out ghostly favor / in
asmoche as the taste of the soul is not well ruled / but corrupt of the
propre vysyble love / and of pride and uncleanness / by the which uncleaness
they covet for to fulfill their lusts / and so fulfilled with lust and
couetyse without any shame / they trespass and use wretched usury which I have
forbid. How subjects which be in the foresaid defautes amend the^ not / and
of defautes of relygyous persons which do not correcke yt foresaid defautes.
IN what wise therefore may such full of so great defautes do ryghtwysenesse
to other and repreue other of their subjects for their defautes? Certain they
ca^ not for their own defautes withdraws fro themself boldenes / for to
vndernyme other / and also the holy zele of ryghtwysenes / and if they
otherwhyle do it / their subjects ye be gylty as they be / can sayt to the^
thus. Leche first hele thyselfe / and than hele me / and than shall I receive
thy medycyne. Though thyselfe be in more defaute than I / and thou vndernymes
me / full ill does he yt repreueth and vndernymeth such by words / and not
i^ good living. I say not this because he should not vndernyme and blame
defautes of his subjects be he good or ill / but he is bound thereto. And yet
nevertheless he does ill / because he amendeth not him / and set himself
first in good living / or than he vndernyme other / and yet the subject
does much worse that receives not mekely ye repreues and vndernymynges of
his curate (be he good or ill) ymendynge by such vndernymynge his wretched
life / for he hurts himself and none other / and he alone shall be punyshed
for his own defautes / and none other. The cause why all euylles dear daughter
ben so ryue / is for they be not under nyme with good living / and why be they
not correcked i^ good lyuy^ge? Certain for curates be bly^ded with their own
propre love / i^ the which love al their wyckednes is grounded and set / and
they behold and se no forther / but how they may fulfill their own mystruled
delectacyons and lusts / as well subjects as curates / and also as well
clerks as relygyous. O sweet daughter where it ye very obedyence of relygyous
people / which be put as angels in holy relygyon / and be worse than fendes /
for both in techynge and prechy^ge / they should show my word. They only
cry and preche with sown of the mouth / and therefore there may grow no
fruit in ye hertes of yt herers / their prechy^ges be rather for plesynge of
men and for delectable herynge of me^nes eres / than for my worship / that is
the cause why they study rather in curyous speky^ge / tha^ for to please in
good living. All such do not sow my sede in sothefastnesse / for to take heed for to pull up vices and pla^te virtues (and the cause is) for they be not
besy to draw out thorns and breres out of their own gardeyne. Therefore they
endeuer them not to pull them out of the gardeynes of their neighbors. All
their delytes is in arayenge of their bodies and their celles / and for to go
about by towns and Cytees. Of such it happeth / as it fares of fysshes yt
be without water / they dye anon. In the same wise such relygyous folk if
they beoute of their celles with vanyte and unhonest living they dye anon /
they go out of their cell of ye which they should make an heaven to them / and
they run about by broken houses / seeking frenshyp of their kynne and of
other seculer people after their own wretchydnesse / by unlawful lys^te of
their wretched soueraynes which have tied them not short / but long. All
such wretched curates and prelates take no thought though they se their
subjects in the fendes hondes / but often times they send them thither / and
otherwhyle they know well that they be deuylles incarnate by co^dycyo^ / they
send them to monasteryes of Nuns / to such as be incarnate deuylles as they
be / and so one distroyeth the other with many subtyltes and dysceytes. The
begynny^ge of the^ is set in color of devotion / but because their living is
wantayne and wretched / it stondeth not colored long with devotion / but
anon ye the fruyt^ of their devotion is showed. Fyrite they seem to be flowers
of stynkynge dyshonest thoughts / with corrupt leaves of words / and so with
wretchyd manners they fulfill their desires. The fruit that follows thereon /
thou knows well they be but leaves / and often times they be come so ferforthe
that each of the^ go out of relygyon / he follows her over all / and she is
made a comune woman. Of all these wyckednesses and many mo / prelates be ye
cause / for they regard not their subjects but they give them large leave /
for they themself send them thither / and yet they feyne for to se their
wretchedness / and because also the subject had no delight of himself / and
thus on both the parts follows death. Thy tongue may not tell to many
defautes as they offend me with / for they be made the deuylles armure / and
with their c^^sed lyuy^ge they enuenyme both within and without / without they
enuenyme ymo^ge seculers / within they enuenyme ymo^ge relygyous / they be
depryued fro charytable brother heed / and each of them will be more than other
and greater than other / and each of the^ will have more tha^ other / and so
they do against ye precepte and auowe yt they have made. They have made a vow
for to keep their order (and they break it) and not only that they keep it not
/ but they do as hongry wolves do ymo^ge sheep / and they yt will kept their
order / them they deryde and scorn / and such wretches think with such
parscucyo^s and scorns that they do to good relygyous people / which keep ye
order for to cover the^ self / and they dyscouer themself ye more / and
therefore much myschefe falls in the orcharde of holy relygyon. The relygyon
in it self is holy / for it is grounded by the holy ghost / and therefore the
order in himself may not be dysceyued / nor corrupt by the defaute of the
subject. Wherefore he that will enter in to relygyon should not behold to them
yt be evil / but he should row forth under the wings and fynnes of relygyon
/ keeping the same relygyon after the first entente to his power unto the
death / but if he be seek or dyseased. I said to the also that relygyon is
come in to such a co^dycyon by evil prelates and evil subjects / that he
which would keep ye order fully / seems to mysculed relygyous people (in the
same co^gregacyon / that he breketh the order / in asmoche as he follows not
their wa^tayne manner of living in cerymonyes and other manner of dysportes
such as they have ordained ymonges them / and they will keep the cerymonyes
for to please seculers / and so to hyde their defautes. Thus thou may se that
ye first voue that they make to keep their order they fulfill not / of the
which obedyence I shall tell yt i^ another place. They make also a voue for to
keep wylfull pouerte / and ever for to live chaste and contynent / how trowes
thou yt these be kept? Se their possessions and abundaunce of monye that they
keep pryuyly / departed fro the comune charity / not comunynge with their
brederne / nor party^ge another temporal substance / nor ghostly substance /
as the order of charity does ask / and also their own order. They will no mo
make fat but themself and their beestes / and one be noryshehe another /
but his poor brother dies for honger and cold / and after time he is well
fodered and noryshed and has great feestes / he thy^keth not on his poor
brother / nor he will not ete with him at the poor table of the trayter / his
delight is for to stand there where he may fulfill his lust with glotony. It
is impossible to such one / for to fulfill and keep the third voue of
contynence / for a full womb makes no chaste soul / but wantaynly they go
with mysruled lusts / and so they do walk fro evil to worse / and much
myschefe falleh ymonge them for keeping of that properte / for if they had
not for to spend / they would never live vnordynately / nor they should never
have such curyous frendeshyppes / for if they had not for to give / they
should never have love nor fre^deshyp of seculers or of men of the world /
which frendeshyppe is grounded for love of the gift / and for a manner delight
and pleasau^ce that one takes of an other / and not of the pure and parfyte
charity. O wretches so set in so great wretchedness / and of me you be set in
so great dygnyte / they fle fro the quere as they tasted venyme therein. And if
they stand therein / they cry with their voices / ut their hertes be fer fro me
/ to go to yt mass they have it of custom without any dysposycyon / as
though they should go to the meet. All these euylles and many mo / of whom I
shall no more tell the / because it shall not make foul thy eres / nor to
follow the vile / ungracious / and wicked prelates / the which do never
ame^ede / another correcke nor punyshe the stynkynge defautes of their subjects
/ nor yet they have no fere / nor they be no lovers nor well wylly^ge that
their order should be kept / in asmoche as they themself do not keep their
order / but rather break it as I have said before. They will gladly lay upon
the heedes if them the which would keep the order / heavy stones of right
great precepts and commandments / punyshynge them of trespases / that
never they were gylty in. And all this they do because in them shyneth not the
ghostly Margaryte precious stone of ryghtewysenesse / but of vnryghtwysenesse /
and therefore vnryghtwysely they give to them that deserve grace and
benyuolence / penance and hate. To such as be the deuylles lymmes by mysruled
living / they commytte both offices and states of the order (for as blind
they live) and as blind they give offices / and and thus they govern their
subjects / and if they correcke them not and them amend or that they dye /
with the same blyndenesse / they shall go to derkenesse of endelesse dampnacyon.
And yet they must needs to me endelesse Judge / yield a reckoning of the souls
of their subjects. Right evil shall they give to me a reckoning / and
therefore ryghtwysely of me they shall receive as they have deserved. How yt
syn^e of Lechery reygneth in evil mynysters of holy church. Dear daughter
some manner of ^^arcle I have showed the of yt wretched living of them (which
do live in holy relygyon) with howmoche wretchedness they dwell in their order /
as raumpynge wolves in shepes clotynge. Now I shall tell the of clerks and
seculer mynysters of holy church / that thou also may have ruthe and
compassyon of their mysruled lyuy^ge. Three pyllers of sins there be / of the
which I told the in another place / whereof I shall make my complaynt to the /
one is of uncleanness / another is of high pr^de / and the third is of great
couetyse that reygneth ymo^ge them / for they sell the grace of ye holy ghost /
as I have said before. Each of these three vices / one follows and is
dependau^t upon another / and the fundamente and ground of these three wretched
pyllers / is propre love of themself. These three wretched pyllers the while
they stand vpryghte (that is to say) that they fall not down by love of
virtue / they be suffycyent ynought for to hold styfly an obstynate soul in
any manner vice / for every vice (as I said) spryngeth of the propre love. Of
propre love ye pryncypal vice of pride spryngeth / and a proud man is depryued
fro the love of pure charity / and so fro pride / he comes to uncleanness and
auaryce / and thus they chain themself with the deuyls chain together. Se now
dear daughter with what wretchedness of uncleanness they defoule both their
bodies and souls / as I have told the in another place. But now of another
thing will I tell the yt thou may the better know the well of my mercy / and
that also thou may the rather have co^passyon of the^. There be some that be so
devil like / that not only they take that blessed sacrament in irreverence /
wherein I have set the^ for to mynyster it worthily / after the excellence yt
I have set them in / but they for the love yt they have to certain creatures
/ if they may not obtain as they would have / they will have the^ with charms
and incautacyons of fendes / and with the blessed sacrament that is given to
you for meet of live / they work therewith malycyously for to fulfill their
unhonest and wretched thoughts / and that they may there by the sooner bring
their wylles to effect / and those beestes that be under their cure whom they
should feed both i^ body and soul. With such manner wise they tourmente and
in many other manners which I ouerpasse / that thou have ye more pain in
hery^ge of such myseryes. By such mysruled governance they run out of
their minds / and that causes the fend that is incarnate within them / for
to tell the in special how he does this and such other wretchedness / it is
not spedeful yt I tell the. But generally I tell the their life is right
wretched and dyshonest. O dear daughter the flesh that is exalted above all
the orders of angels oned with my dyuyne nature / such wretches given it to
such cursed wretchedness. O abhomynable and wretched man / and yet not a man
but a be / that thy flesh which is oned to and hallowed / gyues to comune
women / and yet thou gyues it a wors thing / fro thy flesh and fro all
mankind / the wound of sin was take away upon the cross / which wound
Adam by his sin brought in. O wretch to ye my sone did worship / and thou
does vnworshyp to him / he heled thy wound with his blood / and thereto made
the a special mynyster of the same blood / and thou smytes him again with
wretched sins. That good shepeherde washed his beestes in his blood / and you
defoules them yt be pure and clean / yt does thy power for to cast them in to
fylthe / you should be a myrroure of honest / and you art a myrrour of
dyshoneste. All the lymmes of thy body you hase put to wretched works / and you
does ye contrary of it yt my sothefastnesse has do to the. I have suffered yt
he should be your drink with gall and eysell / and you as an vnordynate and
mysse ruled be delytes ye in delycate meets and drynkes / maky^ge thy womb
a god. I suffered that his eyes should be blyndefelde for to yllumyne the / and
thou with slyper syghtes in thy soul beholdes venomous darts / and also in
the hertes of them / in whom thou lecherously beholdes. In thy tongue do dwell
dyshonest and vain words / with thy tongue thou art bound to correcke and
amend thy neighbor / and for to tell him and teache hy^ my word / and for to
say thy service both with tongue and with heart / and I feel nothy^ge else but
stynke and sylthe / swery^ge and forswerynge / as it were a baratour often times
it blasphemeth me. I did suffer also that his ho^des should be bound / that
both they and al mankind he should lose and undo fro the bond of sin. And
thy hondes be anointed and hallowed for to mynyster that blessed sacrament / but
thou in wretched and right vile touchynges does use thy hondes / all thy
works the which de understand by thy hondes ben corrupt and put to the
deuyls service. O wretch I have put ye in so great dygnyte for to serve me
only / and thou did dysceyue both me and the and all reasonable creatures. I
suffered his feet to be fastened making to ye of his body a ladder for to
asce^de up to mercy thereby / his side was opened / for to make these the
pryuyte of his heart. I put hy^ all to you as an open shop / where ye might
se and taste ye meruaylous love yt I had to you / finding there also my
dyuyne nature oned in your kind / there may thou se that of ye blood which
thou does mynyster to me / I have given the a bathe / ye your wyckednes may
be washed away thereby / and you of thy heart hase made the deuylles temple.
For thy feet which be thy affeccyo^ bear thy soul to none other place / but
to the deuylles place. Thus with all thy body thou smytes the body of my sone
Ihesu / doing the contrary to him that he does to the / to whom you and al
creatures be hyghly bound. All these instruments of thy body do sown to
evil / for all yt myghtes of the soul be gadered together in the name of the
devil / and not in yt name of me. Thy mind should be full occupied / with the
benefytes of me which thou hase received / and thou does the contrary / for
thou fulfylles it with wickedness and dyshoneste of lyuy^ge. The eye of thy
intelleccyon thou should put full of light of feythe upon the passion of my
only sothefast sone Ihesu christ whose mynyster thou art made / and thou
before him hase set delyces and richesse of the world with wretched vanyte.
Thy affeccyo^ should only love me without any other / and thou hase set
wretchedly for to love creatures and thy own body / and so thou loves beestly
things more tha^ me. What is yt cause of this? Certain the propre vnpasyence
that thou hase to me / what thing that I take away / that thing that thou
loves more than me. And also the dysplesaunce that thou hase to thy neighbor
/ when it seems to the that thou does receive some te^porall harm of him /
and so thou hase him in hate and blaspheme / going away fro my charity. O
unhappy wretch thou art made mynyster of the fire of my dyuyne charity / and
thou for thy own propre mysruled delectacyons and for one harm yt thou
receyues of thy neighbor / thou does lose that mynystracyo^. O dear daughter
this is one of those three wretched pyllers yt I have rehearsed before. How that
auaryce reygneth in wicked mynysters in lenynge to usury / and specially in
byenge and selling of benefyces and prelaces / and of much evil yt has
come in to holy church for his couetyse. NOw shall I tell the of the secunde
that is of auaryce / for that thing which my sone gave in great largeness /
that is al his blessed body hanging upon yt cross full of turme^tes and
peynes / where as my blessed lamb right largely shed his most precious
blood / and thus my sweet la^be paid the rau^some of mankind / with no gold
nor silver / but with yt precious blood. And yet not half ye world he rau^somed
/ but all ye world / both they that be passed / they that be present / and
they that be to come / and yet he gave you not only his blood / but also he
gave you fire of bre^ny^ge love / for he gave himself to you by the fire of
brennynge love / and yet not only his precious blood and ye fire of brennynge
love / without my dyuyne nature. For the nature of the godheed was and is
parfytely owned to the nature of manheed / and if that blood so oned with the
largeness of dyuyne love has made the a mynyster / and thou with so great
couetyse and auaryce that thing which my sone gate on the cross (yt is
souls raunsomed with so great love) and that also he has granted the that
thou should be a special mynyster of that blood / you does sell by such
couetyse the grace of the holy ghost / making thy subjects to by of the that
thou hase freely received of me. Thou hase not dysposed thy throat for to wyn^e
souls by techy^ge but to devour souls by monye taky^ge / and thou art made
so strayte in charity (of that thing the which thou hase take in so great
largeness) that thou may another receive me by grace / nor thy neighbor by
love. The substance of temporal goods that thou receyues by virtue of ye
blood / thou receyues it largely. And thou auarycyous wretch does good to none
(but to thy self) and yet not to thy self / but as a thief worthy endelesse
pain does rob ye goods of thy mother holy church and the goods of poor
men / also you spendes it vycyously with women and dyshonest men / and in
delyces / and with thy kynred / and also there with thou noryshes thy children.
O you vile wretches where be your children of virtue yt ye should have under
your governance / where is your fervent charity with the which ye should
mynyster / where is also ye great desire of my honor and health of souls
that ye should have / where is that great and dole full sorrow that ye should
have for to se the wolf of hell to bear away thy sheep. There is none in thy
strayte heart thou covetous wretch another love of me nor of them / thou alone
loves thyselfe with thy own sencyble love / with the which love thou
enuenymes thyselfe and other. Thou art that wicked spyryte and fend of hell
that deuoures the^ with mysruled love / thy throat desires no other / and
therefore thou takes no thought though the inuysyble devil bear the^ away.
Thou thyselfe art a very instrument for to send them to the inuysyble devil
of hell. Of the goods of thy mother the holy church / thou delycately arayes
thyselfe and other sinful and wretched lyuers with ^he / and thou byes great
horses more for lust than for need / there as thou should have them for need /
and not for lust. These lusts worldely me^ do use / but lusts should be for
to feed and array the poor men / and for vysyte the seek men / helping all
such people in their needs both ghostly and bodyly / for I have ordained ye a
mynyster for none other / nor given the such a dygnyte / but for the^. But
because thou art become a wild be / therefore thou settes thy joy in such
beestes (thou sees not) but you art blind and will not se the tourment yt is
ordained for the. Thou should amend the wretch / and sorrow that thou hase
thus bone / and so amend the. Sees thou not dear daughter what wretchedness
reygneth ymo^ge these wretched sinners what shall I more say. I said to the
that some of the^ lene to usury (not for to beyholde open usurers) but in many
subtle wyses by their couetyse / for seldom times to their neighbors they
lend of their goods / ye which in no wise is lawful to be used. If it were
a gift of little valu / and he with intent receives it for a prys above the
love that he has lent it him (it is usury) and so of all other things that
he receives in the mean while with such intent. I have ordained him for to
forbydde leculers fro that sin / and he does ye same / and moreover if one
come to him for to ask counsel of his matter / because he is gylty in the
same and has lost thereby the light of reason / he gives derke counseyle of
the same passion that he feleth in his soul of the same matter. These and many
other defautes do spring of such streyte covetous hertes / it may be said
of the^ the word that my only sothefaste sone Ihesu said when he went in to
the temple where he found sellers and buyers / and he bette them out with
scourges (saying thus to the^) my house shall be called a house of prayer /
and ye make it a den of thieves. Thou sees well daughter yt this is sothe / yt
of my house which should be a house of prayer / now is made a den for
thieves / they by and sell therein / and make marchaundyse of the grace of the
holy ghost / for they will have great prelaces and been fyces of holy church
/ and they bye the^ with great gifts. And thus they pla^te in the orcharde of
holy church this stynkynge plant. Thus in this wise both the byer and the
seller do use falsenesse and dysceyte / there as they should go vpryght and use
al manner of truth. If the vycar of my sone knew this / he would correcke them
/ and take fro them their offices (both of the byer and of the seller) and if
they amend their wretched living / it shall be lawful for them to receive
their benefyces again. He that boughte it should be put in prison / so for to
amend his defautes / and that other may take ensample thereof / that they do
not ye same. If the vycar of my sone do this in earth / he does duly (and if
he do it not) it shall not be vnpunyshedde when he shall yield his reckoning to
me for his offices. Believe me dear daughter / in these days it is not punyshed
/ and therefore my church stondeth in great defautes and full efabhomynacyons /
for the vycar of my sone sercheth not ye living of them when prelacy is given
to them whether they be good or ill. And if they inquire any thing of their
good co^uersacyon / they ask of such as be ill as they be / for they be hold
nothy^ge else in the^ / but ye greatenesse of their astates / and worthynesse
of the world and richesse / and that they be great spekers (and the worst of
all is) otherwhyle they will choke the officers with gold / and comme^de the
same man to the^ / ye holy church has of hy^ a semely prelate. Here good
daughter be ye deuylles works / for there as they should inquire of virtuous
lyuy^ge and fayrenes of virtue / they behold only yt semelynes and fayrenesse
of body / they should search after meke men and poor for to auaunce them /
such as forsake benefices / and they take vein people and proud. They search
not only after cunning (and cunning is right good and parfyte) there as it
is felyshypped with honest living and very meekness. If cunning be in a
proud man / that is also dyshonest and cursed of lyuy^ge / that cunning is
venym / for such one understands holy write none otherwise but after ye
letter / i^ derkenesse he vndersto^deth it / for he has lost the light of
reason / and his eye of intelleccyon is blinded. In the which light with
light above nature / was declared and understood holy writ of worthy
doctors / as I have said before. Thus thou may se that cunning is good in
it self (but not in such one) for he lives not there after / but his cu^ny^ge
is to him fire of endelesse dampnacyo^ / but if he amend his life. And
therefore they should rather behold to holy living / than to a cu^nynge man
that lives evil / they do the contrary / for all those that be good /
virtuous / and also cunning / they hold them fools (of poor folk for to
auaunce them) they have indygnacyon. Therefore thou may se yt i^ my house
which should be a house of prayer / and in the which should shine the ghostly
Margaryte stone of ryghtwysenesse / and light of cu^nynge / with honest and
holy living / and sweet smell of truth / and now abounds the sin of
lesynges. They should have wylfull pouerte with very business for to co^serue
souls / and to pull them out fro the deuylles hondes / and they gader richesse
and set their business more about temporal goods / tha^ about ghostly
goods / and they take heed to none other thing than to myrthes and games /
and for to encrese and multyply temporal substance / and they wretches do not
consider that this is a manner of losing of te^porall goods / for if the
abounded in virtues / and token upon the^ ghostly business (as they should do)
they should have temporal goods ynowe. They should fuffre deed me^ to bury
their deed men / and they should sewe me and my doctrine and fulfill my will /
ye is for to do yt thing that I have ordained them to / but they do all the
contrary / for deedly things and tra^sytory things they bury in themself
with a mys ruled business and affection / and they do take upon them worldely
men's business. Thus is to me a great dysplesaunce / and a great
hynderaunce to holy church / they should leave such things to the world /
and suffer one of the^ bury an other. A deed man is understand in two manners /
one is wha^ a man of holy church mynystreth and governs temporal goods
with deedly sin of vnordynate love and affection. Another is for to excersyce
only bodyly works and leave ghostly / for the body in himself is deedly and
has no life / but that it has of yt soul / and as long as the soul is in
ye body / so long it receives live and no longer / therefore such bodyly
works only be deed. Wherefore my special anointed servants and mynysters yt
should live as angels / should leave deed things to deed things and they
should govern souls yt be quycke things and dye never / as to the being of
the^ gouernynge them and mynystrynge to them the sacraments of holy church /
and graces of the holy ghost / and the^ fedynge with ghostly meet and and godly
lyuy^ge. And in this wise my house should be a house of prayer / aboundynge in
graces and virtues / and because they do not thus (but rather ye contrary) I
may say yt it is made a den of thieves / for there they bye and sell as
merchants / and it is made a receyuy^ge place of beestes / for they live as
wild beestes unhonestly. And therefore thereof they have made a stable for their
lyenge in the fylthe of dyshoneste / and so they hold with them there in the
church their deuylles / as a spouse holds his wife. Thus you may know
howmoche evil is used ymo^ge the^ / and yet much more without any co^paryson
tha^ I have told you. How pride reygneth in the foresaid mynysters / by the
which pride the feeling in god is lost / and when that feeling is away /
than fall they to this fault (yt is to say) such me^ do feyne them to make
consecracyon / and they make none. NOw I will tell the of yt third pyller
(that is pride) and though I have set it last / yet it is better last than
first / for all vices come of pride / like as all virtues do come of charity.
Pride begins and spryngeth and is noryshed of poor sencyble love / of ye
which love I told the that it was and is the ground and fundament of al
these three pyllers / and also of all manner euylles that creatures do / for he
that loves himself with vnordynate love / is depryued fro the love of me (in
asmoche as he loves me not) and in that he loves not me / he offends me /
because he keeps not the commaundymentes of the law / the which is for to
love me above all things / and their neighbors as themself. This is ye cause
why that they love not me nor their neighbor / for they love themself with
sencyble love / so they may no there well serve me nor love me / but rather
they serve and love ye world. All such sencyble love and ye world may not
acorde with my love nor with me / and they that have none acorde with me they
be fer fro me / for they that louen the world with sencyble love and serves
hy^ sencybly / must needs hate me / and he that in sothe loves me / must
needs hate the world. And therefore my only sothefaste sone said / there may
none serve two contrary lords / for if he serve the one / he shall be hated of
the other. Thus thou may se that propre love pryueth a soul fro my charity /
and arayeth him with the vice of pride / of the which all manner defautes do
spring of every reasonable creature that is in those defautes / it is for to
sorrow and wayle and namely of my mynysters which should be meke (as well so
meke) that they might noryshe charity ymonge their neighbors / as for to be
meke in mynystracyon of the body of my sone yt vndefouled lamb. And they be
not ashamed of their pride / for to se me comen mekely to mankind / in to ye
flesh of my only sone. Yet though ye same body run to the death of the
cross lowly and mekely by obedyence / he boweth there his heed to salute the
and great ye. He spredeth his arms abroad there / the for to clyppe and brace
to him / and he stretches forth his feet for to stand with the / against
thy ghostly enemy. And you wretched man that art made his mynyster flees and
shoues him / and thou byclyppes and enbraces to the unclean creatures. Thou
should dwell stable and stydfaste / showing the doctrine of my only sothefast
sone Iheso / and fastnynge thy heart and thy soul in him / and thou art
unstable and vnstydfaste as the wind / for every thing re^neth about vaynly.
If thou have any prosperyte / thou art moved with all mysse ruled gladness /
and if thou have aduersyte / thou art moved with vnpasyence / and so thou
draws out the mary and ye pythe of pride that is vnpasyence / for right as
charity has meekness / for his pythe and mary / so is vnpasyence the pythe
and mary of pride (for of al things most) proud me^ be troubled / sclau^dred
/ and yrous more tha^ other. Pride asce^deth never to heaven / but plungeth
down into hell (and therefore my only sothefast sone said) he yt exalts hy^
in pride shall be brought low / and he that meketh him shall be exalted. In
every ky^de of folk pride hyghly dyspleaseth me / and much more in my
mynysters / for them I have set in a meke state for to mynyster my meke lamb
/ and they do the contrary. And why is not such a wicked and wretched priest
ashamed / seeing meke so me and lowly i^ my only sothefast sone Ihesu / for
whom I have ordained the^ to be mynysters / and my sone meked himself by
obedyence unto the death of the cross / he bowed his heed corowned with thorns
/ and this wretched mynyster arayseth his heed against me and against his
neighbor. And there as he should be a lamb (mynystrynge to my very lamb) he
is a ram with horns of pride / and he smyteth all those that cleue^ to hy^.
O wretched man thynkes thou not that thou art in my service / is thy office
for to smite me with thy horns of pride / doing both me wrong and thy
neighbors wrong / and so for to live ymo^ge thy neighbors with wrong / is
this thy meekness with which thou should say mass / and mynyster the body
and blood of my sone. Thus thou art made in sothe as a wood be and a cruel
without any dread of me / thou deuoures thy neighbor / and ledes thy life
with dyscencyo^ and debate / and thou art made accepter of parsones. They that
do scrue the and do ye profit thou acceptes / or such as flater and please
the / and those that live as thou dors / them you loves and acceptes and none
other / whom thou should hate and correcke their defautes. But thou does ye
contrary / for thou gyues them ensample to do the same or worse / if you were
good thyselfe / thou would correcke them / but because thou art a wicked man /
thou will not vndernyme them / nor be dyspleased with their defautes. Thou
despises meke / pure / and virtuous people / you goes away fro the^ /
nevertheless you hase a cause to fle fro the^ / though you should not fle fro
the^. For you flees the^ / because ye slynke of vices may not suffer the sweet
smell of virtue. Thou holds a great reprefe to ye / for to se at thy door poor
men sto^de / thou eschewes for to vyset them in need / thou sees them peryshe
for ho^ger and will not help them. All this does the horns of pride / which
will not bow for to use one little deed of meekness. Why will they not bow?
For their own propre love which norysheth pride / they put not away fro them.
And therefore he yt will not co^descende and mynyster poor folk another of
te^porall goods another spyrytual without a thank therefore. O cursed pride
grounded and set in thy own love / how hase you so blinded the eye of thy
intelleccyon in such a wise yt wha^ they wene they love themself and be
tender of themself they be right cruel / and wha^ they wene they wyn^e they
lose / and wha^ they wene they sto^de in delyces / riches / and great highness
/ they stand in great pouerte and wretchedness / for they be depryued fro the
riches of virtue / and be come down fro the heyghte of grace / to ye sickness
of deedly sins / they think they se and they be blind / for another they
know their self nor me. They known not their own estate / nor their dygnyte
that I have set them in / nor they know not the freylte of ye world / nor
their own little stablenesse / for if they knew all this / they would not
make the^ a god thereof. What thing has wtdrawe fro the^ this knowledge?
Certain pride / of all such I have made incarnate deuyls / and I ordained
them for angels / yt they should be erthely angels as in this life / and they
fall fro the heyghte of heaven / to ye depenes of derkenesse. And in so much is
the derkenesse of the^ increased / yt other while they fall to defaute / as I
shall tell ye after. There be some i^carnate deuyls that feyne often times to
consecrate and they do not consecrate for fere of my Judgment / and also
because they would do away fro the^ all manner dread / and the brydell of their
evil deeds. For they rise not by the morrow fro uncleanness / and at even fro
mysse ruled etynge and dry^ky^ge / yet they think it is right needful for to
satysfy the people for to say mass / not wtsto^dy^ge ye people do consider
their wickedness (that is to say) they think they should not so soon by
good conscience say mass / for fere and dread of my Judge me^tes. Sees you not
dear daughter how blind they be / they run not to co^trycyo^ of heart / and
dysplesau^ce of their defautes / for to amend the^. But they go boldly to
mass / as for a remedy to satysfaccyon of the people (not for to consecrate)
but for to say mass / for to ouerpasse at consecracyon the words of
consecracyon / considering nothing that ye last error and defaute is more
and yt by much than the first / because he makes ye people to do ydolatry /
making them to do worship to an host vnconsecrate / as they would do to the
very body and blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / all god and all man.
For that that they worship is very bredde / sees thou not what abhomynacyon
here is / and how great my pasyence is ye does suffer them / if such one
amend hy^ not / he may look after sharp da^pnacyon at the day of Judgment.
But now what should yt people do that they fall not in to such inco^uenyence
/ they should pray with co^dycyo^ thus wha^ they be in doubt. If this
mynyster have said that he should say / I believe that thou art gods sone
on live / given to me to my ghostly lyuelod fro ye fire of thy meruaylous
charity / and in the mind of thy sweet passion where you shed thy blood for
to wasshe us fro our sins / if they do thus they shall so worship verily me
(though the mynyster have wretchedly sinned) i^ doing there they should not do.
O right sweet daughter who wtholdeth ye earth yt it may not swalowe the^
quycke / who wtholdeth my might / yt it might make the^ immovable and yt they
may be deed images for their co^fusyo^ before all ye people? Certain my mercy
/ and I hold myself (that is with my mercy) I hold my dyuyne ryghtwysenesse
/ yt they may be overcome by stre^gthe of mercy / but they as deuyls obstynate
will not know this nor se my mercy / for they think they should have it of
dewte / what yt ever they have of me / so they be blyndefelde for they se not
yt they have it of grace only / but of dewte. Of many other defautes / the
which do come of pride of a man's own propre love. ALl this have I told the
yt thou may have the more cause of waylynge and compassyon of their
blyndenesse / so for to se them stand in state of dampnacyon / and also that
thou may the better know my mercy / so for to trust therein / and for to
receive thereof great sykernesse / offrynge the same mynysters of holy church
and all the world to me asking mercy for them / and ye more sorrowful and
delectable desires you offers to me fro them / the more thou shows thy love yt
thou hase to me / for yt same profit the which thou may not do me / nor none
of my servants / the same ye should show to me by the mean of them / and
tha^ shall I forgive so constrained of your desires / by pepynge and by prayenge
both of the and other of my servants / and also have ruthe of my spouse holy
church / reformy^ge her with good and holy curates / yt by such reformacyon
of good curates / wicked subjects may be correcked / for the euylles that be
done by evil subjects / wicked curates be the cause / for if they were
amended and in them did shine ye ghostly Margaryte stone of ryghtwysenesse with
holy and honest living / they would not do so / and will thou know what is ye
cause of such wretched living / that one follows so another in living /
because ye subjects be not obedyent / for wha^ the prelate was a subject / he
was not obedyent to his prelate / and therefore he receives of his subjects /
such as he gave to his soueraynes / badde is that one / and badde is that
other. Of all this / and of all other defautes pride is the cause / grounded in
their own propre love. The subjects were vncu^nynge and proud / and much
more is the sovereign vncu^nynge and proud / and there is so great ygnoraunce
and vncunnynge ymo^ge the prelates / and they he so blind / that they will
give ye order of prestheed to a man that is an ydyot / which can uneath read
and say his service / and oftentimes of their ygnorau^ce / such priests be
made yt can not say the words of the sacrament / and so of this comes that
defaute / which is rehearsed before / that they consecrate not. And there as
such prelates should chose wyseme^ grounded in virtues / and that couthe
understand such as they did read / they do all the contrary / for they take
no head of their cunning / nor to yt dyscrete age of them / but of lust they
make children and not sad men / nor they do not take heed of yt good and pure
living yt they should have / nor of the dygnyte and mystery to ye which they
be chosen / but only for to multyply people (and not virtuous) they themself
be blind and they gader together the blyndenesse / and they consider not that I
of that shall ask a rekeny^ge at ye day of Judgment. Yet they do more / for
wha^ they have so made blind priests / anon they commytte to them cure of
souls / and they se well they can not govern themself / and yet they make
them gouernoures of other. And thus the sheep that do lack a true shepeherde
/ which should take heed to them and that couthe led the^ ye right way
(lightly they peryshe) and oftentimes be all to rent and devoured of wolfes /
because ye shepeherde is wicked / he recketh not to keep a hounde yt should
berke against the wolf that comes to the sheep / but such one he holds in
keeping as he is. And so these mynysters and shepeherdes be yt cause that they
have no business themself about the^ / they will not have the hounde of
conscience / nor ye state of ryghtewysenesse / nor the rod of co^reccyon (it
is no wonder) for their own conscience will not bark against their own
defautes / and therefore they can not well vndernyme their subjects that be
spread a broad in mysse ruled lyuy^ge / wherefore the hell wolf deuoureth them.
If they would suffer the hounde of conscience to bark / and they to take their
defautes upon them with ye staff of holy ryghtwysenesse / they should avoid
their sheep out of the deuyls crouches / and bring them home again to the
fold / but because such shepeherdes be without the roodde and hounde of
barkynge conscience / their sheep do peryshe / and it is no wonder though ye
hounde of their conscience bark not / for he is made feeble for defaute of
meet. The meet that should be given to this hounde of conscience / should be
the meet of my vndefouled lamb Ihesu christ / for if the mind be full of his
precious blood / ye conscience is fed therwt / that is for mind of that
blood the soul is strengthed to hate vices / and for to love virtues / which
hate and which love do puryfy ye soul fro ye fylthe of deedly syn^e / and it
gives so great strength to ye conscience yt is noryshed thereby / yt as soon
as any enemy of ye soul (which is sin) will enter in / anon ye conscience
as an hounde barketh against it and eycyteth reason to help hy^ for to do
ryghtwysenesse against him / for he yt has conscience has ryghtwysenesse /
and therefore all such unworthy mynysters (ye which be worthy to be called
unreasonable creatures) for they be like to beestes in their lyuy^ge / it may
not be said of the^ yt they have ye hounde of conscience / nor ye staff of
ryghtwysenesse / nor ye yt rod of correccyon / for they have somoche fere /
yt they be afraid of eueri shadow (not for holy dread) but seruyle dread. And
yt cause is that they be encu^bred with their own mysse living / they should
dyspose them to death / for to deliver their sheep fro ye fe^des ho^des / and
they themself fe^de the^ to ye fend / not gyuy^ge the^ doctrine of good
lyuy^ge / nor they will not suffer one word of wrong for the^ / and oftetymes
it happeth yt the soul of his subject is encu^bred with right grievous sins /
and he takes no head to ye / but to his householde / he ordeyneth rather ye
another wretched priest shall here ye confession of such a troubled soul tha^
he himself / which has ye charge thereof. O what wretched leche is he to
whom is committed ye cure of souls / and will not do his dewte / he should live
yt he might fulfill his dewte ymo^ge his subjects / but such a wretch has
fere to do his dewte / other for a word yt is said to him of wre^ge / or for
dread / or such other yt he dare not fulfill his charge / so yt what for dread
and what for dysplesau^re / he shall leave yt soul in yt deuyls hondes and
arms / and dare not say him the sothe / and in that wise shall he take him ye
body and the blood of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / and verily sees he that
/ yt he is not losed fro yt derkenesse of deedly sins / and yet nevertheless
for plesau^ce of worldely men / and for a mysse ruled dread / or for some gift
/ or by the queste that he receives of him / he mynystreth to him the
sacrament / and yet there to he buryeth the same cursed man in holy church with
great worship / where they should rather throw hy^ out as a be / or as a
membre cut fro the mysteryall body of holy church. Who is cause of this?
Certain proper love / and the horns of pride / for if they did love me above
al things / and also ye soul of yt wretch for me / and they themself also
were meke / than without seruyle dread / they would be dylygent about the
health of that wretched soul. Sees thou not what euylles do follow these three
vices / whom I put to ye as three pyllers / of whom all other sins do come /
that is pride / coueryse / and uncleanness / both of their bodies and vf their
souls / thy eres be not suffycyent to here those euylles yt do come of these
three pyllers / as they did come fro the deuylles me^bres / for pride they do
many dyshonestes and much couetysenesse / as sometime thou did know to whom
such things did hap / you knows well sometime there were certain parsones of
good feythe and of good living / which were tarried in the^ self with
certain dredes / weny^ge yt they had in the^ a wicked spyryte / they comen to
a wretched priest / supposing to be delivered there of by his counseyle / and
he as a covetous man receives gifts of the^ / and also as a dyshonest and
wretched man spoke to the^ of dyshonest and wretched lynnes (saye^ge thus to
them) this defaute ye ye fuffre may not be heled (but i^ such a wise) and so
would wretchedly have do cursed sin with the^. O devil above all deuyls / in
all things you art worse tha^ a devil. There be many deuylles yt hate yt
sin / you that art worse tha^ he walowes therein / as a hog in yt mire. O
unclean be / is it the thing that I ask of the / I ordained ye tor to put
out deuyls out of souls by ye virtue of my sons blood / but you puttes in
deuyls. Sees you not wretch how the axe of my ryghtewysenesse is set at the
root of thy tree. One thing I say to the / yt such things should sto^de to
ye to usury / for one time shall be yt I shall ask ye (both of mysspe^dy^ge
of thy time and of thy place) but if you amend the and punyshe thy wickedness
here with penance and co^trycyon of heart I shall not spare the though you be a
priest / but more wretchedly shall thou be punyshed / and greater pain shall
be put to the / and more cruelly than to other. Than look you whether you can
put away the devil fro the / with the devil of couetyse. There was also another
wretch / and yet is such to whom creatures ye be bound in deedly sin come
to for to be assoyled and losed of those sins / and they bind the^ faster i^
some other sin like them or greater / and with new fyndynges and ways of
wretchedness they fall with them in sin / if thou have mind there of thou
kewe such a creature / for thou did se her with thy eyes / to whom such a
thing befell / such a wrethed priest is without a hounde of conscience in
himself / for he aspyeth nothing his own defautes / nor barketh not / in
correckynge of the defautes of his subjects / but rather he strangleth his
own conscience in himself and other / also I ordained such curates for to
sing and read dyuyne service / and they learn for to work malycyous things /
and for to charm and enchau^te deuyls / and for to make women to come to the^
by dysceyte of ye fend about mydnyghte. Ordained I the for to spend thy
waking in the night in such wise? Nay certain / but for to spend the
night in holy waking / and prayer by good dysposycyon / on the morrow thou
may go to mass and give the people sweet smell of virtue / and not the
stynkynge fylthe of vices. Thou art put in the state of an angel / that
thou may be conuersaunte with angels by holy medyacyons in this live / and at
the last come to me with the^ to taste in ever lasting bliss / and thou
delytes ye to be a devil / and to be conuersau^te with him or that thou dye.
But I know well the horns of thy pride has smyten ye clear shyny^ge perle
of holy feythe within the eye of thy intelleccyon / and so thou hase lost thy
syghte / and therefore you sees not in howmoche wretchedness thou dwelles in /
and thou byleues not yt every sin shall be punyshed / and every good deed
shall be rewarded / for if thou believed it in sothe / thou would not do as thou
does / nor such conuersacyo^ thou would not show / but when that ever thou
herd that name of sin named / thou would have abhomynacyon thereof. But
because thou parsues his will / hy^ / and his works / thou hase great delight
thereof. Thou art bly^de / and yet thou art more than blind / I would that
thou would ask of that devil that thou serves what mede he will gyueye / for
the service that thou does to him / I know well he will give the to answer
(and say) yt he will give the such fruit as he has / for he may give the
none other / but such cruel turmentes and fire in the which he brenneth ever
himself / in whom he fell for his pride fro the heyghte of heaven / and you
erthely angel falls fro ye heyght of thy preestly dygnyte by thy high pride /
and fro thy trefour of virtue / in to the pouerte of many wretchednesses / and
but if thou amend the here / thou shall descend i^ to ye depenesse of hell.
Thou hase made the world and thyselfe / thy god and thy lord / behold to the
world with all his delyces / that thou in this life hase received of hy^ / and
also to thy own propre sensualyte / wherewith you hase used worldely things /
where I set the in state of preestheed for to despise them / say therefore to
the^ / that for the they must give a rekeny^ge before me ye sovereign Judge.
They should answer than and say that they may not help the / and so should
they tryffe the forth (and say) that thou thyselfe shall reken or give
acompte / and not they. Lo thus you may conceive se that before me and all the
world you shall be a shamed / all this thou can not se (for as I said to the)
the horns of thy pride has blinded the / but you shall se them at ye end of
thy death / where thou can not with al thy might find no remedy / but only in
my mercy / thrystynge in yt sweet blood that you was made my mynyster of / that
blood shall never be take away fro the / nor fro none other (if you will trust
therein) and in my mercy. If there should never none be so great a fool nor so
blind as thou art / for to abide of repentance to the last hour / yet
should they thy^ke in that last hour on my mercy / for a man that than is
found that he has lived wyckedly / is accused of fendes / of the world /
and of his own freylte / for he will not than gloss hy^ nor stater him / nor
show him tha^ no manner delectacyon / but bytternesse / nor make him than
parfyte / but vnparfyte / nor show him than light for derkenes / as he was
wo^te by his life / but he shows him the truth as he is / the hounde of
conscience that sometime was feeble for to bark / than myghtely he barketh and
rebukes him of his sin / that it is about to bring the soul in to
dyspeyre / though no creature should fall thereto. But than should a creature so
rebuked with great thryste receive my sons blood / not withstondynge all his
defautes that he has done / for without any comparyson / my mercy is more
that they receive in that blood / than all the sins that any creature might
do in yt world / nevertheless I said there should none prolonge the time nor
tarry so long / but repent hy^ ever as he synneth / for hard it is than for
him to be found unarmed ymo^ge his enemies in the field of battle. Of many
other defautes which be in wicked mynysters. Dear daughter these wretches of
whom I have told the have in this no consyderacyon (for if they had) they
would never fall in to so many defautes (no there they nor other) but they would
live right virtuously / and rather the would chose to dye / than for to
offend me in any wise wylfully / and defoule so the face of their souls / and
for to mynyshe the dygnyte and worthynesse wherein I have set them / but much
rather they would encres their dygnyte in ye fayrenesse of virtue (not for the
dygnyte of a priest may encrese by virtue) nor lessed by his defautes / but
virtues be co^nyxed to the dygnyte of preestheed / as ornaments the which do
array yt dygnyte of preestheed / and yet all together is but one dygnyte above
the pure fayrenesse of the soul / which the soul had at the beginning /
when that I made and formed her to the likeness and symylytude of me. At ye
begynny^ge they know right well the virtue of my goodness / ye fayrenes and
dygnyte of the^ / for pride and pure love did blind field them not than / nor
they take not away fro them the light of reason / for ye time they did not
know such things to their harm / but they did love me and health of souls.
But such wretches recke not to go fro vice to vice / till they fall in ye
dytche / for they do lack light / and of the temple of their souls / and of
holy church / which should be my specyal orcharde / they make a place for to
receive beestes. O my dear daughter how abhomynable is this to me / yt their
houses which should be a receyuy^ge place of poor me^ of my servants / and
it should be a place for my spouse / therein to teache and preche / and therein
books to be kept of holy matters and seyntes lives / and they to delight them
therein / and for to give ensample of holy lyuy^ge to their neighbors / and
they make them receyuynge places of uncleanness / and of wicked parsones / and
there they do not trete of chastyte / but of auoutry / and therein they lodge
their concubynes / with whom they live uncleanly. Their books they be not for to
study upon / but ye sight of their children / and with they their children that
they have gotten with such wretchedness without any shame / they have great
delight therein. On holy days / and on solemn days when they should yield
praysynge to my name i^ dyuyne service / and for to offer to me the presents
of meke devout prayer / than they go to play with their incarnate deuylles /
and with seculers hawkynge and hu^tynge / as though they were seculers or
te^porall lords. O wretched man whereto art thou comen now / thou should
hunte and hawk after souls / for the worship and reverence of my name / and
stand in ye orcharde of holy church to preche / and thou goes about in wodes
and feldes. But because you art a be / thou lodges be^stes of deedly sins
within thy soul / and therefore you art become an hunter and hauker of beestes
/ by ye which ye gardayne of thy soul is made wild and full of thorns /
therefore thou delytes the to walk in deserte places / for to search after
wild beestes. Se thou defouled man and behold thy defautes / for you hase a
right great cause to be a shamed / on what side ye ever thou turns the on /
but thou art not a shamed / for thou hase lost the dread of me / and as a
comune woman thou art not ashamed / thou makes great bostes and crakes that
thou hase great states in the world / and that thou hase a fair meyne and a
great number of children. And if thou have them not / thou will have them if
thou may / that thou may have heirs after the. But thou thief thou knows
right well that thou may nothing leave to them / for thy heirs be poor men
of holy church. O thou wicked and incarnate devil / without the pure light
thou serches that thing the which you should not search. Thou makes great
bostes of things / of ye which thou should be ashamed before me / that se the
pryuyte of thy heart / and also before all creatures. Thou art all shent / and
yet ye horns of thy pride will not fuffer the to se thy own confusyon. O dear
daughter I have set him upon ye bridge of doctrine of my only sothfast sone
Ihesu for to mynyster to you pilgrims the sacraments of holy church / and he
stondeth in the wretched floode under the bridge / and in the floodes of
delyces and wretchedness of the world / they mynystre the sacraments to you.
And they consider not yt the floode of death is come to him / in ye which
floode he shall be drowned with his lords that be fendes / whom he has
served. To that endelesse dampnacyon shall he go / but he amend him here /
with great reprefe and shame / the which thy tongue is not suffycyent for to
tell / and much more he than any other seculer / for the same sin that is in
a seculer man shall be moore punyshed in him / tha^ in a seculer man / and with
more reprefe of his enymyes / yt do arise against him in the end of his death.

This fyfte chapyter speaks of the dyfference of the death of ryghtfull men.
Also of the death of great sinners and of their peynes in ye end or point of
their death. And a repetycyo^ of much more that is said after / and of diverse
and many other matters / as it is specyfyed in the calendar before. Ca. v.
Because I told the how you world / deuyls / and proper sensualyte shall accuse
him / therefore now I shall tell the of these wretches / how great it is between
the death of a sinner / and the death of a ryghtwyse man / for the death of a
ryghtwyse man is in great peace / more or less after ye perfyte living of his
soul. Therefore I will that thou know that all the peynes that reasonable
creatures have is in will of the^ / for if their will were well ruled and
ordynately set / and acorded with my will / it should suffer no pain. I say
not therefore their labor should be take away fro them / but to that will yt
suffers wylfully for my love shall no pain be / for he bears it gladly /
seeing that it is my will / and of that holy hate which they have of them
self / they have war with the world with ye fend / and with their own
propre sensualyle. And wha^ they come to the point of death / their dyenge is
in peace / for their enemies i^ their lives were overcome i^ ghostly battle.
The world may not accuse him / for he knew his dysceytes / and therefore he
forsook ye world / and all his delyces / his freyle sensualyte and his flesh
accused hy^ not / for he held him under the brydell of reason / as a servant
chastysynge the flesh with penance / with waking and with meke co^tynuall
prayer / his sencyble will he did slay with hate and dysplesaunce of sin and
love of virtue / dystryenge in all wise the tenderness of the flesh / which
tenderness and love that naturally is between the body and the soul / makes
death to appear the harder / and therefore naturally a man dredeth death. But
because that virtue is in a parfyte ryghtwyse man / he passes nature (ye is to
say) he yt sleeth ye dread which is natural and kyndely / and ouerpasseth it
with very holy hate / and with desire to come to his end / for the natural
te^dernesse of the flesh can not make war / where the conscience sto^deth
in quietness. The cause of a quiet consyence / is in a man's dyenge / because
by his life he had good keeping / barkynge when enemies came by and would
enter the Cytee of the soul / as an hounde sto^dynge at ye gate that sees
enemies and barketh / and so by his barkynge awaketh the kepers / in this same
wise this hounde of the conscience waketh ye keeper of reason / therefore both
co^sye^ce and fre choice together / knew well enough by light of i^telleccyo^
/ who was his friend and who was his enemy. To the friend (yt is to virtuous
and holy thoughts of the heart) they gave love and affection of love /
excercysynge the^ with great ghostly business. And to the enemy yt is to
vices and shrewde thoughts / they gave hate and dysplesaunce / and with the
sword of love / and hate / and with the light of reason / and ye ho^de of fre
choice / they smite myghtely their enemies / so yt afterward in the point of
of death / the conscience freteth not himself / for he has made good keeping
/ and so sto^deth i^ peace / nevertheless a soul of meekness vndernymeth
himself in the time of death / for yt time he knows clearly the tresour of
his time / and the precious ghostly stones of virtue / consdery^ge than ye he
has excercysed that time ryghtely tell / yet that is no pain that
tourmenteth him / but it is a pain that impugneth him / for it makes ye soul
to gader all hole in to herself / putting before her the blood of ye meke and
vndefouled la^be my only sothefast sone Ihesu / and he turns hy^ not to his
virtues that he has used before / for he will not nor he may not hope in his
virtues / but only in that blood / i^ the which he fyndeth my mercy / and as
he has lived in his life / hauy^ge my^de of my blood so in his death / he
shall be fulfilled with the same / and made drunk there with / and he forsakes
than himself in yt blood. Fendes may not than vndernyme him of sins / for
the malice of them he overcame in his life with wisdom / yet they came for to
se him / if they might tha^ any thing win / and of them comes in a man's
death horrible syghtes to make him afraid with their foul lokynge / and with
many and diverse fantases. But because in ye soul is no venyme of syn^e / their
loky^ge shall in no wise make the^ afraid / as they shall make such afraid
ye have lived in the world wyckedly. When the fendes do se that such a soul
is entered in to crystes blood with fervent charity they may not suffer that /
but they stand all a fer throwynge to the soul dattes / yet their battle /
their war / and their great cries may not noye it / because the soul
begins to taste endelesse life in heaven / for with the eye of intellecyon /
he has the clear light of holy feythe / that is me that am his infynyte good
/ which he hops to have of grace (and not of dewte) but in ye virtue of my
sons blood shed in his passion / and therefore the same soul spredeth out his
arms of hope / and with the ho^des of love clyppeth that bold to hy^ /
entering in to the possessyon thereof / or than he be therein. Howmoche galdnes
trowes thou receives than a soul that sees himself parfytely come to this
peace / for he tastes of ye good of angels kind / and right as he lived in
charytable fraternity with his neighbor / right so he than receives ye good
of all true tasters fo charity / and each of the^ with other / generally all
such as do pass out of this world so swetely / receyuen this thing. But my
mynysters of whom I told / the which did live as angels i^ earth / they
receive of it much more / for i^ this life they did live with more knowledge
and with more honger of my worship and health of souls. I say not that they
do receive only of the light of virtue purely (which generally al may have)
but these had the light of of cunning added to the light of virtuous living
/ the which is a light above kind / by the which cunning they know more
of my truth / and he that much knows much loves / and he ye much loves
more receives. and Your mede is mesured to you after ye mesure of love / for
one that has no cu^nynge (this is not comunely said of all) but of certain
special folk / and yet they receive more worthynesse by state of their
preestheed / for properly to them it is given for to ho^ger souls for my
worship (though it longs to all in general) for all should sto^de in ye
dew love of charity of neyghbourheed. But these that be my mynysters / is
given mynystracyon of my sons precious blood and geuernaunce of souls / and
all such yt be so besy with affection of virtue / should receive more tha^
other. O how blessed be their souls wha^ they come to the point of death / for
they were shewers and defenders of the feythe for their neighbors. Also they
have incorporate the same feythe in the pythe of their souls / with the which
feythe they se their places in me. The hope also that they lyuen with / hoping
in my prouydence / losing the hope of their own trust / that is not hoping
in their own proper conceyte / by the which loss of their own trust / they
set no ordynate affection in no manner creature / nor in no manner create
thing / for they do live right poor wylfully / wherefore that same blessed
hope they did extend to me with great delight. The heart also of them which
is a vessel of love that bare my name about with right fervent and brennynge
charity / techynge and prechynge both with ensample of good and holy living
and doctrine to his neighbor / aryseth with meruaylous love / and clyppeth me
with affection of love that am his end / bringing to me the Margaryte stone
of ryghtewysenesse / for ever he bare that precious ghostly stone before him /
doing to every creature ryghtwysenesse / and yeldynge his dewte dyscretely /
and therefore he yeldeth to me with very meekness ryghtwysenesse / he yeldeth
also joy and presy^ge to my name / to himself he yeldeth indygnacyon /
holding himself unworthy to receive so great grace. His conscience also
yeldeth to me good witness / and I yield to him the corowne of ryghtewysenesse
arrayed and set with Margaryte stones of virtue / that is of the fruit that his
charity drew out of virtue. O erthely angel all this is good to ye / for thou
was never unkind of the benefytes that thou received of me / nor thou was
never ygnorau^te nor neclygent / but besyly with very light thou had the eye
of thy intelleccyon open upon thy subjects / and as a true and a ma^ly
shepeherde thou folowes ye doctrine of ye very shepeherde Ihesu christ my only
sothefaste sone and lamb / and therefore thou goes by him all bathed in his
blood with the flock of thy beestes / whom by thy holy living and techy^ge
many of them you base brought to life everlasting / also thou hase left many
of them in the state of grace. O my dear and sweet daughter to these the
syghte offendes may do no damage nor hurt / for by the glorious syghte of me
that they se by feythe and hold by love / because in them is no venyme of
deedly sins / ye derkenesse and their horrible syghte gives the^ another
noyaunce nor dread / for they have in the^ no seruyle dread / but good and holy
dread / wherefore they another dread nor fere of their dysceytes / because they
do know their dysceytes with light above kind / and light of understanding
of holy write / and therefore they do not of them receive another derknesse nor
trouble of ye soul. And thus they do pass gloryously bathed in the precious
blood of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ / with honger of health of souls
fully brenned in charity of neyghboureheed / going by ye gate of my sothefaste
sone Ihesu christ / and so they enter in me and of my goodness / all be set
each in his own state / and to them is mesured of me of the affection of
charity / after the mesure that they bring with them. Of the death of great
sinners / and of their peynes in the end or point of death. Dear daughter the
excelence of these be not so great / but ye cursed and wicked wretches have
more mysery / of the which I have told to the somewhat before / how dredeful
and how derke is the death of them (as thou thynkes) at the point of death
(as I said) fendes accusen them / showing to them with great dread and
terryble derkenesse their proper likeness / for thou knows well it is so
horrible / yt a creature had lever suffer all manner peynes in this world /
tha^ for to se that syghte / and thereto the prycke of co^seyence is renewed that
wretchedly freteth and turmenteth him in his conseyence vnordynately / also
delyces and his own proper sensualyte whom he made his sovereign lady / and
his servant reason wretchedly accuses him / because he knows the truth of
that / that sometime he knew not / whereby he is come to great confusyon in
himself of his error / for in his life he lived not to me as a true man /
but as an untrue and vnfaytheful man / for his own propre love covered the
clear syghte of holy feythe / and that fend therefore vexes him than of
mysbyleue / for to bring him to dyspayre. O how hard a battle is this to him
/ for than he fyndeth his soul unarmed / having no manner armure of the
affeccyo^ of charity / for he is in all wise depryued of charity / and arrayed
with the deuyls armure / they have not than the super natural light / nor yet
the light of cunning / because they understand it not / for the horns of
pride will not suffer them to understood ye sweetness of cunny^ge / why may
they not do some manner of resyste^s i^ this battle? For certainly they be not
noryshed in hope / they had never hope nor confydence in me / nor of the
blood of ye which I have made them mynysters / but only in themself an in
their states / and in delyces of ye world. And yt wretched incarnate devil
consydereth not / that of all that ever was committed to hy^ / he should give
reckoning to me / now he sees hymsefe naked without any virtue / for on what
side that ever he turns him / he hereth nothy^ge else but reprefe and shame
/ the vnryghtwysenesse that he used in his life did accuse him / therefore he
dare none other ask of me / but ryghtewysenesse (and one thing I say) their
confusyon and shame is somoche / that but they had it in use by their life
for to hope in my mercy / they should be brought to dyspayre / if such hope
came by presu^pcyon. For he ye offends in hope of mercy / may not say
effectually that his hope is hope of mercy / but it is rather called
presumpcyon of mercy. Nevertheless yet he took upon him the deed of mercy /
for in the end of death if he knew his defautes / and that he did dyscharge
his conscience by confession / and put away presumpcyon of hope / than mercy
abides / and of that mercy they may receive hope if they will (for if yt were
not) there should none be / but that he should dyspeyre / and go to the
dampnacyon of the fend. This mercy makes the^ to hope in their life of my
mercy / though than I gave them none / lest that they had offended with my
mercy / but is was given to them only for that they should extend themself
in my charity / and in the consyderacyon of my goodness / and they do use my
mercy in the contrary / for with hope that they took of my mercy in the contrary
/ for with hope that they took of my mercy / they did offend me / and yet
nevertheless yet I keep them in hope of my mercy / that in ye end of ye death
they may have somewhat for to lene to / and that they utterly defayle not by
vndernymynge offendes / and so fall to dyspeyre / for it is more dysplesau^ce
to me / and more harm to the^ this sin of dyspeyre than all other euylles
and wyckednesses than they did ever before. And the cause why yt it is more
harm to them / and to me great dysplesau^ce is this. For all other sins
that they do is done with delectacyon for their own proper sensualyte / for
the which sometime they sorrow / and they must sorrow somoche therefore / yt
they may win mercy thereby. But to the sin of dyspeyre they be not moved by
freylte / for they find therein no manner of delectacyon / nor none other thing
/ but only intolerable pain / and in desperacyon they despise my mercy /
making their defaute the more by dyspysynge of my mercy and my goodness. And
after time yt they be fall in to this sin they repent them not / nor they
have no sorrow for ye sin that is done to me / by that sin as they should do
/ they sorrow for their own harm / but nothy^ge for the offense that they do
to me / and so they receive endelesse dampnacyon. Thus thou may se that this
sin only ledeth a man to hell / and there he is both turme^ted both for
this and for other / he should have had my mercy if he had repented him / and
sorowed for the offense that is done to me. And if he had hoped in my mercy /
for with out any comparyso^ (as I said) my mercy is more than all the sins
yt ever were done / and therefore it dyspleaseth me much / that they put
their defautes more than my mercy / for this is that sin that shall not be
forgive / another in this life / nor in that other (that is to say) it shall not
be easyle punyshed / but grievously punyshed / and therefore in ye point of
death / namely after time yt they have thus wyckedly lived / and because
dyspeyre dyspleaseth me very much / I will yt they hope tha^ in my mercy / and
yt is ye cause why i^ their life / when they did live cursedly / I have made
them use that well by loved dysceyte / that is for to largely hope in my mercy
/ for when they be so noryshed i^ this hope / as soon as they come to this
point of death / they be not right glad for to leave it / for yt great
repreues and vndernymynges that they here of other as they would do / if they
were not noryshed therein / somoche has the depenesse of my endelesse charity
given to the^. But because they have used it with derkenes of their own proper
love / of ye which comes all such defautes / they might not know it truly
/ and therefore it was arected to him for great presumpcyon / in asmoche as the
sweetness of the same mercy rested not i^ their affection / and this is
another vndernymynge that the conscience repreueth them within / the syghte of
fendes that also rebukes them / that is that the time and largeness of my
mercy in whom they did hope / they should have increased it in charity and love
of virtue / and spend the time in virtue that I have given to them by love / and
they both with the time / and also with the large hope of my mercy /
wretchedly have offended me. O blind wretch above al blind / thou buryes and
hydes ye precious ghostly Margaryte stone that I have given ye / that you should
win there on / and thou as a presumptuos wretch would not do the will of me /
but thou hydes that same be saunt under the earth of thy own mysruled love /
which now yeldeth ye fruit of death. O wretch how much is thy pain that
thou receyues now in thy end / and thy wretchedness be not now hid to the
/ for the worm of conscience slepeth not now / but freteth the peynfully.
Fendes also do cry and yield to ye thy mede / that they were wont for to
yield to their servants / that is shame and reprefe that is in ye point of
death thou shall not ascape their hondes / they will that thou come to dyspeyre
/ and therefore they give ye confusyon of conscience / that at the last they
may yield to the such as they have for themself. O wretch the dygnyte that
I set ye in seems in the shynynge / and all to thy endelesse shame /
knowing well that you hase had it / and used it in derkenesse of sin. Also he
puts before ye ye substance of holy church / in the which thou was a
thief / for thou did rob poor folk fro their dewte / and holy church also.
Than thy conscience represents ye same to the that yt thou did spend ymo^ge
comune women / also therewith thou noryshed thy children / and thou made rich
thy kynne therewith / and as a gloton it spend in metes and drynkes / and
arayment / housynge / and in silver vessels / where thou should live under
wylfull pouerte. Conscience also than represents to the dyuyne service / that
thou left vnsayde / for the which thou took no thought if you did fall i^ to
deedly syn^e / and if thou said it with thy mouth / thy heart was fer fro me.
And also thy conscience vndernymeth the tha^ of thy subjects / whom you should
have noryshed with charity and truth / showing them ensample of good living /
and chastyse them with ye hounds of merry / and the rod of ryghtwysenesse /
but because thou did the contrary / thy conscience vndernymneth the there in
the syghte offendes. And if thou being and prelate gave prelaces or cure of
souls to any subject of thine unright wisely / that is that thou sees not
before how to whom after a well ruled conscience thou should give the^ / for
thou should not give it to them for no fair words / nor for to please
creatures / nor for gifts / but only for virtue and for my worship and
health of souls / and because thou does not thus / thou art repreued there
for the more pain and confusyon / and there is put before thy conscience and
before the clear syghte of thy intelleccyo^ / that which thou hase done. And I
will that thou know dear daughter that the color of white is better know /
next the color of black / and black next white / than one deperted fro
another. Right so it happeth to these wretches / to them in special / and to
other i^ general / for in ye death where a wretched soul sees more verily his
turmentes / and a ryghtwyse man his blessydnesse / there is both wicked
living showed / and also good living. And it is not needful that any man
before that soul tell ye wicked living thereof / for his own conscience does
that / both of vices yt he has done / and of virtues that he might have
done. Why virtues? Certain for his more confusyon / for if vice and virtue be
nyghe together / by ye virtue ye vice is better know / and the more yt it is
know / yt more is the shame / and for ye defaute and ye parfeccyo^ of virtue is
the more verily know / for the which he has ye more sorrow / because he
sees his living without virtue. And I will also you know / yt in ye knowledge
which they have i^ vice and virtue / they se clearly the good that sueth after
virtue to a virtuous man / and also the pain yt follows to a sinful man. This
knowledge I give the^ not / for they should fall to dyspeyre / but yt they may
come to yt parfyte knowledge of themself / and to shamefastness of their
defautes with hope / that both with knowledge and shame they might repent the^
of their defautes and ask mekely my mercy. A virtuous man thereby increases in
joy and in knowledge of my charity / for he knows well that both grace and
virtue was and is begon^e in hy^ / by me and by ye doctrine of my charity / and
therefore in me he ioyeth with this very knowledge and light. And so he tastes
and receives swetely his end. Thus you may se ye one ioyeth i^ gladness as a
ryghtewyse man yt has lived in fervent charity / and a wicked man by
derkenesse is confounded in pain. To a ryghtewyse man another derkenesse nor
syghte of fendes fereth nor noyeth him not / for it is sin alone that he
receives dread. They yt wantaynly and wyckedly have led their lives /
receive ferefull dread by the syghte of fendes / yet is it not ferefull of
dyspey^re / but if they will themself. But fere of pain / of reprefe / and of
the conscience and of dread and trembling in the horrible syghte of fendes.
Sees you not dear daughter how great dyfference it is between the pain of
death / and the battle that they receive in their death / and how fer that one
is fro that other / and how great dyfference is of the ending of every of
the^. I have told ye leest party and showed it to thy eye of intelleccyon /
and yet it is so little i^ reward of ye pain ye one receives / and of ye
good that another receives / that it is right naught. Sees thou not what
blyndenesse is in man / and specially in these wretches / for ye more they be
yllumyned of holy writ / yt more they be bound / and the more intolerable
peynes of confusyon they shall receive. And the more by their life they did
know of holy writ / the more in their death they know their defautes to be
great / and therefore when they dye / they be said in more greater peynes than
other be / like as good folk be set in greater excellence of bliss / it
happeth to them as it happeth to false christian men / which be in hell in greter
pain and turment tha^ a Jew or a paynym / because he had the light of
feythe and forsook it. In the same wise these wretches shall have more pain
for a like sin yt other men do / than any other christian man / and that is for
the mystery the which I have given to them / for to mynyster the son of the
blessed sacrament / and also because they have received ye light of holy feythe
more tha^ any other / wherefore right wisely for their mys ruled lyuy^ge / they
shall have more pain than other. But such wretches know not that / for if
they had any manner of knowledge of their state / they would not fall in to so
many wyckednesses / but they will be such as they should be / and because they
be not / all the world is more corrupt by them / than by all the mysse
rulynge of seculers / and with their stynkynge sin they defyle the face of
their souls / and corrupt their own subjects / seeking the blood of my
spouse holy church / for whose defautes that same spouse waxes pale for love
and affeccyo^ of charity that they should have to this spouse which they take
to themself / and they take no head to none other thing / than for to take
prelaces and great benefytes / where rather they should give attendaunce to
cure of souls / by the which euyls / seculers do little reverence and
obedyence to holy church / though they should not do so / for their defautes
be never ye less / nor they shall not be excused for fautes of my mynisters.
And now here shall be showed of a repetycyon of much that is said before /
and how that god forbyddeth all seculer parsones to touch his mynysters (in yt
way of hurt to the^) and how that god styrreth this soul to pray and to weep
by great compassyon upon such mysse living priests. MAny defautes I have
for to tell the / but I will no more make foul thy eres / all this have I told
the to satysfy and fully thy desire / that thou may be the more besy for to
offer to me for them / sweet / delectable / and bitter desires. And also I have
told the of ye great excellence wherein I have set them / and of the
tresoure which I have committed to their hondes for to be mynystred / that is
ye blessed sacrament / in whom is all god and all man contained / showing to
the an ensample there of the son / that thou might there by perfytely know
for no defaute the which they done / that the virtue of that sacrament may in
no wise be mynyshed nor made less. And therefore I will not that reverence be
withdraw fro them. And also I showed the the exsellence of virtuous mynysters
/ in whom ye Margaryte stone of virtue does shine / and of holy
ryghtewysenesse. I showed the also howmoche the offense dyspleased me / that
parsuers do to holy church / and ye irreverence which they show to the
precious blood of my only sweet sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / for all those
that parsu my mynysters of holy church / I arecte it done to my sons blood /
and not to them / for I have monyshed them that they be not of will to touch
my priests and my anointed mynysters. I have also told ye of their wretched
lyuy^ge / and howmoche pain they have and confusyon in their dyenge / and how
cruelly that they be turmented after their death / and thus that I did promise
yt I have told the / and I have so satysfyed to the of that thing which thou
did ask of me / for I must keep my promise. Now notwithstondynge al these
defautes (though they were mo) I will not that no seculer meddle with them / in
punyshynge of their defautes (for if they do) their trespass shall not be
unpunished / but if they punyshe it while they live i^ this life / and so
amend their living. But these and such other be incarnate deuyls / and of my
dyuyne ryghtwysenesse / one devil punysheth another / and each offends other.
A seculer is not excused by the sin of a prelate / nor a prelate by the sin
of a seculer. Now therefore dear daughter I stir the and all my other
servants / to weep and wayle upon all these deed wretchesse / and for to
stand as chosen sheep in yt orcharde of holy church to be fed by holy
desire / offering to me devout and co^tynual prayer / for my wretched
mynysters / for I will do mercy to the world / and withdraw you not fro this
pasture / another for wro^ges done nor for no manner prosperyte that is / I will
not yt you lift up your hedes another for vnpasyence nor yet mysse ruled joy /
but mekely to take heed to my worship and to health of souls / and to the
reformacyon of holy church / and this is a very token to me / yt thou loves me
right perfytely and truly. Thou knows right well that I have showed to the /
that I would thou and other were true sheep / ever for to be fed in the
orcharde of holy church / living with labor to the last end (if ye did so)
than would I fulfill your desires. And here it shall be showed how that this
devout soul yeldeth thanks and praysynges to god / and how that she prays
specially for holy church. THan that soul all bre^nynge in love / and ghostly
drunk / was wonderly wounded in heart of so great bytternesse / and so
fervent in love and langorynge / virtuously turned her all hole to the
sovereign endelesse goodness of good / and said thus. O endelesse god / one
light above all other lyghtes / of whom comes all lyghtes / and fire passy^ge
all fyres / for thou art that fire that brennes and wastes not / but thou
consumes all sin / and the propre love that thou fyndes i^ a soul / and yet
thou does not waste it plainly / but thou fyghtes against it with insatiable
love / for though thou did fill it / yet is it not full / but ever it desires
more and more of thy lovely fire. O sovereign endeles and good he styrred the
or moved the infynyte god so for to illumyne me thy creature / that thou shall
have end with the light of thy truth. Thou thy self art yt same fire / and
cause of love / for ever he is love that moved the and moves yet / to make us
of naught to the image and likeness of the / and for to do us mercy. O
goodness above all goodness / thou art only he that art most sovereign
good / and yet nevertheless thou hase given thy only sothefast sone Ihesu
christ to us / for to be co^uersaunte ymonge us that be full of siynkynge and
vile sins derkenesse. Who was the causer of this? Certain love / for thou
loved us or that we were. O good god and euerlasty^ge in magnyfysence / thou
made thyselfe low and little to make us mykell. On what side that ever I turn
me I find none other than the depenesse and fire of thy most sweet charity /
whether I shall be that wretch that shall yield tha^kynges to thy fervent
charity and love that thou hase showed and yet shows to us / that is so great
brenny^ge love in specyal / above comune love and charity that thou shows to
creatures? Nay but thou alone sweet and lovely fader art he that shall take
thanking of thy endeles goodness for me / that is that the affection of thy
charity alone shall yield thankynges to the / for I am she that am naught /
and if I said I were ought of myself I should ly on myself / and I should be
called the lyenge daughter of the fend / ye which is fader of lesynges. For
thou only art he that is / and therefore being / and all grace that thou hase
set and ordained above being / I have of the / for that that I have / thou
gyues me of thy propre love / and not of dewte. O right sweet fader / when
that mankind lay seek for the sin and trespass of Adam / thou send it to
thy leche / that is thy only sothefaste / sweet / and well beloved sone Ihesu
christ. In the same wise wha^ I lay seek (as now) by the sickness of
neclygence and of much ygnoraunce / than thou most sweet and well byloued
leche endelesse god gyues me right sweet and bitter medycynes that I might
thereby be delivered / and to rise out of my sickness. Sweet thou art to me /
for with thy sweetness and with thy charity / thou showed ye to me / also thou
art to me above all ye sweetness that ever was / for thou hase yllumyned the
eye of my intelleccyon with light of holy feythe / in the which light as it
was liking to thy endelesse gooodnesse for to show me / I knew ye great
excellence and grace which thou hase given to mankind / mynystrynge to them
by thy mynysters all god and all man / that is the blessed sacrament in the
mysteryall body of holy church. And also I have know the dygnyte of thy
mynysters / by whose hondes thou hase ordained thy body to be mynystred to us /
I desired yt thou would satysty my desire which I asked of yt / and thou hase
fulfilled that and much more / enformynge me of things that I couthe not ask
/ whereby I know verily that the heart of a man can not ask somoche and desire
/ but yt thou of thy great mercy gyues him more. And so I know well that thou
art he that art infynyte and endeles good / and we be they yt be vile
corrupcyo^ and naught of our self / but thou art infynyte and everlasting
/ and we be fynyte and mutable. Thou gyues that thing the which a reasonable
creature may not nor can not desire in that wise / as thou can and may and
will satysfy a soul / and fulfill it of those things that it asks not nor
in that wise so swetely and so right plesauntely / as thou gyues it to him.
And therefore I have received light in ye magnyfysence of thy charity / for to
se that love the which thou hase showed to mankind / and specially to thy
mynysters which be thy anointed people / and should be erthely angels in this
life. Thou hase showed the blessydnesse and virtue of thy anointed special
mynysters / that live as bre^nynge lanterns / with ye ghostly precious
Margaryte stone of ryghtewysenesse in holy church. And by them I have the
better knowledge of the defaute of such that live wretchedly / by whom for ye
offense of the / and harm that is done to all the world / I have conceived a
sorrow in my soul / because they do so much harm to the world / and so to
be myrrours of wretchedness / there as they should be myrrours of virtue. And
also for asmoche as you hase made the open to me most wretch / which am the
cause and instrument of the defautes of many people / and thou hase complained
the to me of their wickedness / and I find in myself a meruaylous and great
and passing sorrow of bytternesse. Thou that art a meruaylous parfyte lover /
thou hase also showed the to me both sweet and medycynable / and also bitter /
whereby I might arise hole fro ye sickness of ygnoraunce and neclygence / and
with right parfyte business / also with fervent desire of love / that I
might renu me to the / both knowing thy goodness and myself / and also the
offenses which be done to the of men / and specially of thy mynysters / that I
might therefore cas^ water of teeres on me wretch for my wretchedness /
wy^ynge the fruit of such teeres / by knowledge of thy infynyte goodness /
and also upon these deed folk / that do live also wretchedly / for whom I
would endelesse fader (meruaylous fire and love of charity) that my desire be
never weary for to desire thy worship and health of souls / and that my eyes
never cese to weep. But now sweet fader I ask the of grace that I may have two
floodes of teeres. the which floodes may come out from the / that art the
parmanents peaseable see. I thank the fader / and endelesse thanking be to
the / that hase satysfyed to me of that I asked the / and of that I knew not /
which I asked not of the / and also because you hase styrred me to weep / and
taught me matter of weeping / for to offer in prayer / sweet things /
delectable things / and long desires / before the with meke and contynual
prayer. Now therefore I ask of ye / yt thou show mercy to ye world / and to
holy church I pray the that thou fulfill that thing / which you would I
prayed for. Woe be to me most wretch yt am cause of all evil / and yet can not
sorrow it within my soul. Good lord tarry no longer / but have ruthe and pity
on all the world / bow the lord and fulfill ye desire of thy servant. O
what am I / thou art he yt makes both me and thy servants for to cry to
the after mercy / and therefore gracyously here the voices of the^. Thy
sothefastnesse said thus / search and ye shall find / knock and it shall be
opened to you / ask and it shall be granted to you. O endelesse fader / thy
servants cry to the for mercy. Good fader answer them after their desires /
for I know well properly it longs to ye for to have mercy and for to give
mercy / and therefore thou may not deny it / but thou must needs give mercy to
them yt ask it. They knock at the gate of thy sothefastnesse / for in thy
only sothefaste sone Ihesu they knock thy meruaylous love which thou hase to
man / and so they cry at the gate / wherefore the fire of thy charity should
not nor may not wtholde / but that it must needs open ye same gate to the^ yt
knock with parseueraunce. Therefore endelesse fader / open the breestes / and
break the hard hertes of thy creatures (not for the^ that do not knock) but
do it for thy infynyte goodness / and for the love of thy servants / which
for them do knock at the gate. Grant you endelesse fader their asky^ge / whom
thou sees sto^de knocking at ye gate of thy goodness / and what do they ask
good lord? Certain ye blood of this gate / that is the blood of thy only
sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / for in that blood / thou hase washed a way the
wickedness and stynky^ge fylthe of sin / which came by the sin of Adam
(yt is our blood good lord) for of that blood you hase made to us a bathe / I
know well therefore thou may not nor will not deny the^ yt ask ye in
parseueraunce. Give therefore good lord ye fruit of that blood to thy
creatures / put good lord the price of that blood upon yt balaunce of thy
sone / lest the fendes of hell led away thy sheep with him. Thou art a very
good shepeherde that hase given to us a very true shepeherde / that is thy
sone Ihesu / the which for thy obedyence gave his life for his sheep / and of
his blood made a bathe. This is ye blood that thy servants do ask of the as
hongry souls at thy gate (by the which blood) they ask that you show mercy
to the world / and make holy church smell swetely in sweet smelling flowers
of virtue / and devout and holy curates / with whose sweet smell / they put
away the stynky^ge smell of stynkynge flowers. Thou endelesse fader did say /
that for the love which thou hase to thy reasonable creatures / and for the
prayers of thy servants / yt suffer much labor for souls / thou would
show mercy to the world / and array holy church worthyly / and so refresshe
us. Therefore delay not / nor tarry not endeles fader for to turn to sinners
thy eye of mercy (but say to the^ thus) or yt ye cried to me for mercy / I
herd you with my ere of mercy. Open good lord the gate of thy meruaylous
charity / the which you hase granted to us by the grace of thy sone. I know
right well good lord that thou openes ye gate or that we knock there at / for
with the affecyon and love that thou hase given to thy servants / they knotke
to the and cry / seeking thy worship and health of souls. Therefore endelesse
fader grant the^ breed of life / that is the fruit of thy blood of thy only
sone sothefaste Ihesu / which fruit they ask of the / for joy and worship
of thy name and health of souls. For it seems (and sothe it is) that it is
more joy to the / and worship for to save souls of thy creatures / than for
to suffer them obstynately in hardenesse of heart. To the endeles fader all this
is possible / for though thou made us without us / yet thou will not save us
without us. And therefore constrayne their wylles gracyously / and dyspose the^
for to desire and will / that they will not. This I ask the for thy infynyte
mercy / thou hase made us of noughth / therefore now to such as we be / show
mercy / and refresshe the vessels that thou hase made and formed to the image
and likeness of the / reform them to grace / in the mercy and in the blood of
of thy right sweet and well byloued sone Ihesu christ.

LAVS DETVR DEO.

Now mother and systren here I have made an end of this the fyfte book / in
the which you may find ghostly / good / and holy doctrine for ye health of
souls / with great consolacyon and comfort to youreselfe / with sweet herbs
and plants of sweet odor and smell. In the which book is made me^cyon of the
blessed sacrament and of his virtues / with the reformacyo^ of priests and
their subjects / with many and diverse matters / and ensamples of good lyuy^ge /
as is contained in the said book.

Sexta The syxte book.
The first chapyter speaks of ye syxte party / and it treats much of the
prouydence of god / and first of his prouydence generally / that is to say /
how god provided man to be man / and how he formed him of naught to his image
and likeness.
And how god provided man to sanacyon with incarnacyon of his sone / when the
gates of Paradyse were shyt for the sin of Adam.
And how he provided himself / gyuynge himself contynually to us in the meet
of the auter. Also how god provided to give hope in his creatures / and how he
that most parfytely hops / most tastes the prouydence of god. And of other
matters / such as be rehearsed to you before in the calendar. Ca. i.
benedictus qi ve^^t i^ noi^ed^t

THan the most sovereign and endeles fader with his marvelous benygnyte
turned his heed of meekness to yt soul / showing her that his prouydence
never sailed to man / if he will receive it / showing in this wise to her /
with a sweet couplynge saying thus. O my dear daughter / like as I have said
to the in many places / I will show mercy to the world / and provide to
every reasonable creature in all his needs. But an ygnoraunte man takes that
to death yt I give him for life / and so he is cruel to himself / and yet I
will provide for him / for I will that thou know it / that what yt ever I give
to man it is of my sovereign prouyde^ce / for with my prouydence / I made him
of naught. It lyked me and dyspleased me for to make him with great prouydence
/ to the image and likeness of me / by the which I pro uyded so for him /
that I gave him my^de for to keep and think on my benefytes / so to make him
partetaker of the might of me endelesse fader. I gave him also intelleccyo^ /
that in the wisdom of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / he might understand
and know the will of me endelesse fader / that have given hy^ grace with so
great fire of love. I gave hy^ also will for to love ye myldenesse of ye holy
ghost / that he might the better love that thing / which intelleccyon sees
and knows. All this has my prouydence done / only that he might be
partetaker and able for to receive ye grace of understanding and tastynge of
me / and so ioyenge of my endelesse goodness in euerlasty^ge bliss. And I have
told the in many places before that heaven was shytte for the sin of Adam /
ye which knew not his own dygnyte / considering nothing with what prouydence
and meruaylous love I made hy^ of naught. Wherefore he fell by such ygnoraunce
in to inobedyence / and fro inobedyence to uncleanness / by pride and plesaunce
of women / rather willing for to co^descende to please his fellow / in gyuynge
to her credence of yt she said / than for to obey to my bidding / and so he
condescended rather to break my bidding / that for to make her fory. And thus
by this inobedyence came al manner evil / al ye that have take of that venym /
of the which inobedyence I shall tell ye in another place how perylous it is /
in co^mendynge of very obedience. And for because this death should be take
away fro man / I provided and gave to you my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
christ with great prudence and prouydence / so to provide to your need. I
say that I did it with prudence / for with the meet of your ma^heed / and the
hoke of my godheed / I took ye devil which might not know my truth /
which truth yt is my only sone came for to dystroy his lesynge / wherewith he
dysceyued man / and therefore in that I did use g^ete prudence and providence.
Thy^ke dear daughter that more might I not use / tha^ for to give you my sone
/ to hy^ also I gave a great obedience / that I might pull away that venym
which fell to mankind by in obedience. Therefore he as a lover that is
rauyshed / and as a very obedyent lamb ran to ye most shameful death of the
cross / and with that death / he gave you life / not in ye virtue of his
manheed / but in the virtue of his godheed / which for satysfaccyon of syn^e
that was done against me / which am infynyte good / required a satysfaccyon
infynyte (that is to say) for that mankind which had offended and was fynyte
/ should be oned with an infynyte / so to satysfy infynytely / to me that am
infynyte. And as often as a man offends / yfhe will turn to me in his life /
he shall find ever parfyte satysfaccyo^. This is done by my prouydence (that
is to say) for because the pain that my sone suffered on ye cross was
infynyte / therefore ye receive infynytely by virtue of the godheed. Thus
provided the infynyte endelesse prouydence of me god ye fader in euerlasty^ge
trynyte for to array man / after time that he had lost his arayment of
innosency / and so was made naked fro al virtue / and peryshed for ho^ger / and
dyed for cold in this life / and so was subject to all wretchedness. The
gate of heaven was locked / and of heue he lost al his hope / for if he might
have had hope / it had be to hy^ a greterefresshynge in his life / but he
had it not / therefore he stode^^ great afflyccyo^. I therefore with my
seuorayne prouyde^ce provided a remedy to this necessyte / not coacte nor
constrained by your ryghtewysenes nor by your virtues / but of my own
goodness. I gave you raiment by mean of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu /
which vnarayed himself fro life / and arrayed you with innosency and grace /
which innosency and grace ye did receive in holy baptym by virtue of his blood
/ for yt baptym washed away the spotte of orygynall sin / in the which ye
be conceived / taking it o^ your fader and mother / and therefore my prouydence
has provided to you that same remedy of baptym / to put away the spotte /
not with pain of body / as it was used in ye old law when children were
cyrcumsysed / but with swetenes of holy baptym / and so is man arrayed. Also I
made him warm by the fire of charity / which was showed to you by ye holes of
my sons wounds / which was covered with the clothing of your manheed.
Whether ye this might not make warm the cold heart of mankind / that by
obstynacy is made cold / and blind by his own proper love / yet may it if
he will forfake the love of himself / and love me. My prouyde^ce also has
given him ghostly meet for to comfort hy^ / as long as he is in this life a
pilgrim / as I have told the in another place. I have also made his ghostly
enemies feeble / for none may disease him but he himself. And what meet is
this? As I have told the before / it is the body and ye blood of my only
sothefast sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / all god and all man / meet of angels
and meet of life / such meet as fulfylleth yt ghostly honger / of such that
delight to ete of yt meet. That meet must be received in ghostly gladness and
delectacyon / with the mouth of holy desire / and tasted by love Thus thou
may se that of my good and godly prouydence I have provided to him
co^fortacyon in his pilgrimage of this life. How that god provided to give hope
in his creatures / and how he that most parfytely hops / most tastes the
prouyde^ce of god. Forthermore I have given to him refresshynge of hope / if he
be hold with light of very feythe yt price of my sons blood / which was paid
for to give him stydfast hope and sykernesse of health / and yt shame and
reprefe that christ Ihesu suffered in his passion is his worship. For if he in
all the lymmes of his body offended me / as anendes that for a remedy / my
blessed sweet sone i^ all his body suffered grievous tourmente. And also with his
obedyence he releued your inobedyence / of whose obedyence ye have all take
grace / and for inobedyence / al ye have take and received sin. This is
granted and provided by my prouydence / and was fro the begynny^ge of yt
world unto this day / and shall be unto yt last day / ever for to ordeyne a
remedy to your necessytes / and to yt health of mankind / by diverse and
sundry wyses / as I that am a very ryghtewyse leche / se it be spedefull to
your infyrmytes / yt parfyte health may yt sooner be restored / orelles for to
keep him in health. Therefore my prouydence shall never fail the^ / to such as
will receive it and have parfyte hope in me / for all that have parfyte hope in
me they knock and cry in sothefastnesse (not only by word but by affection
/ and so with light of very feythe they shall taste me i^ my prouyde^ce. But
not such that knock and cry in sothefastenesse with the voice of words /
saying thus to me (lord lord) all such but if they cry and ask me other
wise / I shall not know them by my mercy / but by my ryghtwysenes. HOr in
sothe my prouydence shall never fail to him that verily hops in me / but he
that has dyspeyre i^ me and hops in himself (knows you not well) that hope
can not be set in two contraryes / which my sothefaste sone taught you in
the gospel / where he said thus. No man may serve and please two lords / for
if he serve that one / he hates yt other. Service is not without hope / for a
servant that serves serves for hope of his reward and profit that he
sees in his service shall come to him / or else for hope that he has to
please his lord. In ye same wise think dear daughter that it happeth to a
soul / for other it must be that she serve and hope in me / or else that she
serve and hope in ye world and i^ herself / for by somoche she serves ye
world without me / in asmoche as she serves and loves her own propre
sensualyte / of ye which love and service / she hops to have delight /
plesaunce / and sencyble fely^ge. But because their hope is set in vanytes and
transytory things (such as have end / therefore it must needs fail here /
and of that she loved she may have none effect / and as long as she hops
in herself and in the world / she may not hope in me. for the world that is
worldely desysyres of man / be to me hate / and they were to me somoche in hate
and abhomynacyon (that is for dystruccyo^ of them) I send my only sothefast
sone Ihesu to the most repreuable death of the cross. The world and I may
not acorde / but a soul that parfytely hops in me / and serves me with all
her heart / and all her affection / anon by very need it must mysse trust of
herself and of ye world / and of such hope namely yt is set with her own
freylte. This is very perfyte hope (more or less parfyte) after parfeccyo^ of
love which ye soul has in me / and so parfyte and vnparfyte do taste of my
prouydence / but he that setueth and hops for to please me only for my self
/ receives and tastes me more perfytely / than they that serve me with hope of
fruit yt they find in me. These be the first of whom I have told to the
the parfeccyon i^ the last state of the soul. But these that I tell yt now
which go with hope and love of fruit / be the vnparfyte souls / both the
second and the third / of whom I told the before / of ye states of ye
soul. But yet in no w^se another to parfyte another to vnparfyte my prouydence
shall not fail / so that a man presume not / nor hope not in himself / which
presumy^ge and hoping in himself / is cause of nothy^ge else / but by going
out fro my love / and entering in to his own love / whereby ye eye of
intelleccyon is bly^dfelde / he withdrawynge of ye light of very feythe / and
therefore he walks not with light of reason for to know my prouydence.
Nevertheless to a man be he never so sinful or ryghtewyse / I will provide /
and give my prouydence and ordeyne for him / for all things be made by craft
of my goodness / and I it am that am / and without me is nothing / but sin
the which is naught. Thus thou may know that they recerue my prouydence /
and yet they understand it not / and if they know it not / they may not love
it / and therefore they may not receive ye fruit of grace thereof. All that be
right and to such it seemed crooked and as bly^de men / they se in derkenesse /
because they have set their hope in derkenesse / whereby they fall in to
murmuracyon and in to inpasyence / and how be they somoche fobles? O dear
daughter how may they believe ye I most sovereign and endelesse goodness may
nothy^ge will but ye good of them in small things / that every day suffer to
come to the^ for your health / when they prove by experyence / yt I will
nothing have but satysfaccyo^ of them for their health in great things.
Sythen it so is that not wtsto^dynge all their bly^denesse they may nothing do
be it never so little / but if they se my goodness with some manner light above
kind / and also the benefyce of my prouydence which they find / and that
they may not deny / what in the first creacyon / and in the second creacyon
that a man receives in yt blood of my sone / wherein I have reformed hy^ by
grace / as I have said to the. This is so clear and so open that they can not
say the contrary / nevertheless they defayle being afraid of their own
shadow / for they have not used nor excercysed this light with virtue. An unwise
man sees not that fro that time to time I have provided generally to the
world / and specially to some after their astate / for there is none in this
life that sto^deth stydfastly / but that he moves hy^ fro time to time till he
come to stydstast state / always therefore I provide to such one of such
things / as is behouefull to him in time of need. How god in the old
testament provided ye law and ye prophecyes / and afterward he send his
word by apostels / mar tyrres / and by other holy me^ / and how no thing
falls in creatures / but that all is ye very prouydence of god. O Enerally I
have proved / and with the law the which I did give unto Moses in the old
testament / and with many other holy prophecyes. Also I will that thou know
that before yt coming of my only sothefaste and sweet sone Ihesu christ
crucyfyed / the people of the Jews did stand much without prophecyes / that
the people might be informed with such prophecy es / hoping thereby that my
only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ the prophet of all prophettes might the
sooner draw them out of bondage / both them and their children / and that also
he might thereby the sooner open to them heaven / which so long time was shyt
fro the^. But after time my sweet sone came / there roos no prophet ymonge the^
/ yt they might well know / that he of whom they did prophecy was come /
wherefore it was not spedefull that mo prophe tes should prophecy of him to them
/ all though they knew hy^ not / nor would not know hy^ for their bly^de
nesse. After the^ I provided (as I have said) yt my own sone should come /
which was your medyator between me endelesse god and you. After him came ye
apostels / martyrs / and doctors / and confessoures / all this has my
prouydence done and ordained. And as I said to the he shall ordeyne and
provide to the last day / that is by general prouydence given to all
reasonable creatures / which will of that prouydence receive fruit. In
specyal also al things I have given them both life and death / in what whyse
that ever it come to the^ / ho^ger / thryst / loss of state i^ this world /
nakedness / cold hete / wrong / reprefe / scorns / and derysyons. All these I
suffer for to fall to the^ / or for to be said to the^ / and of men / not that
I shall make in them malice of evil will that done evil and wrong. But the
being and the time that they have they have of me / which being I have give
to them / not for they should offend me nor their neighbors / but because
they should serve both me and them with love and charity / wherefore I suffer
them for to do such deeds of wrong / or for to preue ye virtue of pasyence in
the soul which receives such wro^ges / or else to make him known that he
must have pasyence / other while I suffer yt to a right wise man / all yt
world be contrary / and at ye last I make the^ dye so wonderly / yt many men
of ye world wondereth thereon / for it seems to the^ vnryghtewysely done / so
to se a ryghtwyse man peryshe / otherwhyle in water / otherwhyle in fire /
otherwhyle to be devoured of beestes / otherwhyle I suffer a house to fall up on
the^ / whereby they lose their bodyly life. O how much out of reason or manner
this seems to their eyes / in ye which eye is no light of very feythe / but
all this is no wonder to feythfull folk / for they have found and tasted by
affection of love in such great things my prouyde^ce / and so he sees and
holds stydfastly / yt with my prouydence only / all things I provided and I
do for yt health of man / wherefore all things he holds in reverence / and it
is not sclau^dred another in himself nor in his works / nor also in his
neighbors / but all he ouerpasseth with very pasyence. My prouydence is
withdraw fro no creature / for all things ben made for him / other while it
seems to a man that hayle or tempest or darts that I cast upon the body of
creatures is cruelte / n I couthe not / nor will not provide to his health /
and I have done that for to make him ascape fro endelesse death / but he
holds the contrary. And so men of ye world in all things will defoule my
works / and understand them after their vndersto^dy^ge. And here it shall be
showed how that what that ever god suffers be done to us / it is only for
our good / and for our souls health / and how they be blinded and dysceyued
that deem or Judge the contrary. I will yt thou se dear daughter with how much
pasyence I must supporte and suffer my creatures / ye which creatures I have
made and formed to the image and lykenes of me / as I have told the with right
great sweetness of love. Open therefore the eye of thy intelleccyon and
behold on me / and I put the a certain special case that byfell by a
certain person / for whom (if thou remember the well) thou did pray to me
that I should provide / and I have provided for him / as thou knows right well
/ that with out any peril of death he had his state again. And this is a
special partyculer thing / in the same wise generally it is in all manner
people. Tha^ that soul opened the eye of her intelleccyon / and beheld with
yt parfyte light of holy feyth in his dyuyne mageste with great love and
longing desire / for of his words she knew verily many things in his sweet
prouydence / that she should obey to his bidding / seeing herself in ye
depenes of his charity / yt he was and is most sovereign endelesse good / and
yt only of love he made us / and rau^somed us with ye precious blood of his
sone / and yt also by the same love / he gave to us all things / and suffered
all things for to come to us / yt is both trybulacyons and co^fortes /
prouydynge the^ only to ye health of man / and to none other end. The blood
which was shed with so great fire of love / made it know to her as she saw
all this / yt it was verily sothe. Tha^ said yt high sovereign and endeles
fader / such as can not consider my prouydence / be blind in their own
proper love yt they have to theymselfe / swclau^dery^ge the^felfe with much
vnpasyence / I shall now speak to the in special and also in general of yt
thing which I told the / such as I have told yt as deem evil to their
own harm / of yt thing which I do of love and for their good to avoid the^
fro endelesse peynes / and for their lucre yt they may ye sooner receive
euerlasty^ge life. And why tha^ plain they on me? Certain for they in me have
no hope / but only in themself / whereby they come to derkenes and so they
know / and yet they hate yt thing which they should have for their best.
And as proud folk they deem my pryue domes which be right wise / but they
as a bly^de man that with touchy^ge of his ho^de or with tastynge of his mouth
/ or with sown of his voice will deem good for ill / and ill for good after his
feeble knowelege. And they will not trust in me that am very light / and I it
am that both bodyly and ghostly noryshe them / for without me they may
nothing have / and if it hap otherwhyle that they be served of any creature /
I am he yt have given to that creature will / ableness / might / and also
cunning for to serve the^. But he as a bly^de man the which goes after
feeling of his hondes / which is dysceyued in his touchy^ge / for he lacks
light to Judge colors / and in the same wise his taste is dysceyued / and for
he may not se what unclean be sytteth bpon his meet / his ere is also
dysceyued in delight of sown / for he sees him not that syngeth / which with
ye same sown (if he be not well ware by the same delectable sown) may
bytraye hy^ to yt death. In this same wise do they that be made as blind /
lacking the very light of reason / touching with the hand of sencyble
feeling delactacyons and pleasures of ye world (semynge to them good) but for
because they do not se / they can not to eschew perels / for he is a cloth
meddled with many thorns / with much wretchedness / and many anguyshes / (in
somoche) that the heart which feleth them is without me intolerable to
himself. In the same wise also to the mouth of desire / yt thing that he
loves inordynately seems sweet in receyuynge / and yet upon ye delycacyes
there sit unclean beestes / and many deedly sins / which make the soul
unclean / and so they both withdraw the^ fer fro my symylytude and likeness
/ and also fro the life of grace. And therefore if he draw not nyghe again /
with the light of very feythe / to yt likeness and life of grace / for to be
cleansed with my sons blood / he shall have endelesse death. Herynge is to him
his own proper delectacyo^ / of the which delectacyon / it seems to hy^ that
it makes a sweet sown. Why seems it so? Certain for ye soul follows ye
love of his own proper sensualyte / and because he sees it not / therefore he
is dysceyued of the sown / and also because he follows him by vnordynate love
/ where he fyndeth himself in the dytche / bound with the bond of sin / and
led in to the hondes of his enemies. For as a blind soul by his own love /
and with hope which he puts i^ himself / and in his own cunning / he
trusts not to me / yt am both the leder and the way of him / which way is
made to him of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu yt said thus. I am way / truth
/ and life. And he is light / that who yt sees thereby shall not be dysceyued
/ nor walk in derkenesse / and there may none come to me but by him / for he is
one with me / and I with him. Of him (as I have said to the) I made to you a
bridge / yt ye might all come to me yt am your end / and yet nevertheless for
all this / they trust not i^ me / which will nothy^ge else have of the^ / but
their holiness. To this end with great love I give them all things / and
suffer all things to fall to them / both co^fortes and trybulacyons / but
they ever be sclau^dred in me / and I bear the^ always and suffer them with
pasyence / for or they had any love to me / I loved them without their love /
and they always parsu me with much inpasyence / hate / grutchynge / and with
much vnfeythefulnesse / willing and desiring after their own blind syghte
/ deem my pryue domes / which be all ryghtwyse / and done for love / and ye
cause why they deem thus falsely / is for that they know not themself / for
he yt knows not himself may not know me / nor verily my ryghtwysenesse.

The second chapyter shows how that god provided i^ some special case to ye
soul yt falls. Here god shows his prouydence against his creatures in
diverse manners / and makes his co^pleynte of ye untruth of his creatures / and
he expouneth a figure of ye old testament / and shows there a profitable
doctrine / with other matters / as is rehearsed in ye calendar. Ca. ii.
Dear daughter if thou will yt I show ye how much ye world is dysceyued of my
mynysters. Open ye eye of thy intelleccyon / and behold i^ me and so shall
thou se specially of him that I told the of / and right as I tell ye of him /
so may I tell ye generally of other. Tha^ ye soul for to obey to ye
endelesse fader / beheld in herself with a love longing desire / and than
endelesse god showed to her ye dampnacyon of hy^ by whom yt falling did
fortune / saying thus to her. I will yt thou know yt for to make him ascape
fro this endelesse da^pnacyon (in ye which you sees well he was) I suffered him
so for to fall / yt with his blood he might have life / in the blood of my only
sone Ihesu / for I forgate not ye reverence and ye love which he had to ye
sweet mother Mary / yt mother of my oneli sone sothefast Ihesu / to whom
worthily is granted for yt reverence of my sone Ihesu / that who so ever
(right wise or sinner ye has her in dew reverence / he shall not be pulled
away and devoured of ye fend of hell. She is set and put as meet of my
endelesse goodness / for to be take to reasonable creatures / ye which is is
done of my great mercy / not for to cause men thereby to do evil and so for to
hope in my mercy / for yt were rather cruelte tha^ mercy. And all yt causes a
man to do evil / and than to fall / and that is nothing but ye love of
himself / which withdraws fro him light / wherefore he may not know my
truth. If they would / they should lift up the cloulde that is before the eye
of their intelleccyon / than should they verily know and love my sothefastnes
/ and so should they have all things in dew reverence / and receive there of
ye fruit in dew time. But dear daughter be not afraid / for of him whom
thou does pray for to me / I shall both fulfill thy desires / and also the
desires of my servants. I am your god rewarder of all your labors and
trayuayles / and fulfyller of your holy desires / so ye I might find verily
such one that truly knocks with the light of feythe at the gate of my
sothefastenesse / that they another err nor fail in ye hope of my endelesse
prouydence. Here god shows his prouydence against his creatures in other
diverse manners / and how he makes his co^playnte of the untruth of his
creatures / and how he expowneth a figure of the old testamente / and he
shows to us a profitable doctryn. I Have told the of that special and
partyculer falling / but now shall I tell ye in general wise / thou may
never se nor know howmoch a man's ygnoraunce is / he is without any feeling
and knowledge / wha^ he puts fro him ye knowledge of me / hopy^ge and
trusting in himself / in his own knowledge and cunning. O thou fool and
unwise man knows thou not right well / that thou hase not thy own knowledge
of thyselfe? It is my goodness yt has given it to the / which do provide
for thy need and necessyte. Of whom hase thou that the which thou prouydes in
thyselfe / for other while you would do a thing / and thou may not nor ca^ not
do it. Other while it happeth that thou hase cunny^ge / but you hase no power /
other while you hase power and hase no savor therein / and other while thou hase
no time (and if thou had time) yet parauenture thou should lack will. All
this is give to ye of me for thy health that you should know thyselfe naught /
and have the more matter of mekenes / and not of pride / whereby thou fyndes in
all thing chaungynge / and pryuacyon / for they dwell not in thy lyberte and
fredome. Nevertheless only my grace is stable and stydfast / which may not
be take away fro the nor changed / that is not for to be departed fro yt grace
and turn to sin / if thou thy self take it not away fro yt. Therefore how
may thou lift up thy heed so lenynge on thyselfe to me endelesse goodness?
Certain thou may not if thou will lift it up to me / thou may another hope i^
thyselfe / nor trust in thy cunning / but because you art made a be without
reason / thou may not know and se that all things chau^gen outrake my grace
only) and why did thou not trust in me yt am thy maker / but rather trust in
thyselfe? Am I not to the true and feytheful? Yes certain it is not unknow en
to the / for thou hase proved it contynually. O dear daughter / Ada^ the first
man was not true to me and feytheful / for he forfeted my obedyence / which I
put to him / by ye which he dyed / but I was true to him / conseruynge and
keeping hy^ to that thing / for ye which I made him / willing for to give to
him endelesse good / and for to fulfill this / I oned my godheed (that is my
sovereign heyghte) with the insyrmyte of his manheed / wha^ he was rau^somed
and restored by grace / by medyacyo^ of ye blood of my only sothefaste sone
Ihesu. This he provided well / and had it in experyente / but it seems that
they byleuen not / that I am mighty for to help the^ / strong for to socour
them / and for to defend them fro their enemies / wise for to yllumyne the
intelleccyon of their ghostly eye / nor yt I have no mylde meekness for to
give the^ such things as is nedetul to their health / nor that I am not rich
for to make them rich / nor that I am not fair for to give them fayrenes /
nor that I have not meet for to feed them / nor clothes for to array them /
their works do show that they by leave not this / for if they byleued it
verily / they should be full of good works and holy prayers / and yet
nevertheless they have it in experyence and they prove it contynually that I
am strong / which keep the^ in being and defend the^ fro their enemies /
and they se well there may none wtstonde my might and strength / and yet
they se it not / for they will not se it / with my might and strength I of my
goodnessehaue ordained and governed and set i^ such a kind all yt world /
that nothing lacks there in / and no man may put more to / than I have put.
I have also provided for the soul and for yt body / all thing that is
needful thereto / not coacte and constrained for to do it by your will / for
ye were not but only coat of my myldenes and meekness (yt is to say) I made
all thing by myfelfe / as it is earth / see / and ye fyrmame^t / that is heaven
for to move and stir above you / the earth by ye which ye may respyre and
brethe / fire and water yt one contrary might be te^porate with another
contrary / the son that he dwell not in derkenesse / so that all things be
made and ordained for to help the necessyte of men / heaven (which is called
ye air) I have arrayed with birds / ye earth brings forth fruytes and
beestes thereon for man's living / the sea is arrayed with fysshe / all these
things I have made in their kind with great prouydence. After time I had
made all these things good and parfyte / than made I reasonable creature to
the image and likeness of me / and send him in to the orcharde / which
orcharde by ye syn^e of Adam has brought forth thorns / where first it
brought forth flowers of sweet smelling innosency. All these than obeyed to
man / but for sin and inobedyence in which he fell in / he found in himself
rebellyon with all creatures / and so man and the world were wild / and than
I provided for him in this wise / I send my only sothefast sone Ihesu in to
the world for to take incarnacyon / so to avoid the infecundyte and
baraynesse of mankind / and to take fro him ye thorns of orygynall sin /
and made of ye man a manner of orcharde / spryncled with ye blood of christ
crucyfyed / setting therein plants of the seven gifts of yt holy ghost /
taky^ge out of him deedly sin. And all this was done after the death of my
sone / and not before / as it was fygured in the old testament / when Elyse
was prayed for to reyse a young child fro death to life / yet would he not go
thither / but he send Gyezy with his staff / saye^ge to him thus / that he
should lay ye staff above ye chyldes back. Gyezy went forth and did as
Elyse badde hy^ / but ye young child arose not. Than Elyse saw that the
child rose not / he went thither himself parsonally / and conformed him in
all things to the child / with all his lymmes / and he brethed upon the child
seven times / in token yt he should arise. This also was fygured by Moses /
whom with ye staff of the law I send upon the deed lives of mankind / by yt
law it might receive no life. I send than my sonr (which is fygured by
Elyse that conformed him to yt deed child) by union of dyuyne nature of
manheed / so that with all manner of lymmes of ma^ky^de this dyuyne nature oned
him and knytte him / yt is with the might of me / with ye wisdom of my sone
/ and with the mylde meekness of the holy ghost / and so all ye depenes of my
godheed in trynyte was conformed and oned with your nature of manheed. After
this union / my only sone Ihesu and well byloued sothefastenesse made another
union (yt is to say) he ran as he had be rauyshed in love to ye most
reprouable death of the cross / where he pressed himself down / by the
which pressyon he granted to this deed child (that is mankind) by
inspyracyon of holy brethynge / the seven gifts of ye holy ghost / brennynge
in ye mouth of holy desire of the soul / taking away fro him death by holy
baptym. He bretheth in token that he has life / throwynge out of mankind the
seven deedly sins / and thus is this orcharde made with sweet fruit.
Nevertheless the Gardyner of this orcharde (which is fre chose) may make this
orcharde wild if he will / for if he sow therein venym of his own proper love
/ for ye which all the seven deedly sins do spring and many other sins
which come out of these. He puts than away thereby the gifts of the holy
ghost / and so depryueth hy^ fro al virtue / there is no stre^gthe for he is
made all feeble / there is also another temporaunce nor prudence / for he has
lost the light wherwt he used reason / there is another feythe nor hope nor
ryghtwysenesse / for he is made vnryghtwyse / he hops in himself / and
byleueth with deed frythe to himself / he trusts in creatures / and trusts
not in me his maker / there is another charity nor pity / for by himself with
the love of his own freylte is made to him cruel / wherefore he may another be
pyteous to his neighbor nor to himself / he is depryued fro all good / and he
is fall in to an evil / how may such one have life? Certain of this Elyse
/ that is of my only incarnate sothefaste sone Ihesu. How? That the Gardyner
of mankind should dystrye ye thorns of sin with his hate / for if he had
never sin in hate / he might never draw the^ out of his orcharde / and than
with love he must run / and with love for to conform him with the doctrine of
my truth / medly^ge ye same doctrine with the blood / which is laid upon his
heed of my mynyster wha^ he goes to confession / with hertely contrycyon /
dysplesaunce of sin / and with satysfaccyon and purpose never to offend /
and in this wise he may renew this orcharde of ye soul while he lives / for
after the time that he is passes out of this world / he may get no remedy
/ as I have told the in many places before. How god prouydeth for us that we
have trybulacyons for the health of our souls / and of the mysery of them
that have trust in themself / and not in the prouydence of god. THus thou
knows that with my prudence / ye second world (which is called man) I have
made him able to the endelesse world / first he brought forth thorns of
many trybulacyons / and so in all things he fond rebellyon. This was never
done without my prouydence / but with my great prouydence and for your
profit / that the hope of ye world should be take away fro hy^ / and tha^
for to renu and set his pace for to come to me / which am his end. And so at
the last by such inportunyte of greuaunce for to remove his heart and
affection fro it. And nevertheless a man is so vncunnynge / yt he can not
know this truth / and so frail for to sprede hy^ abroad in the world / that
not withstondynge such labors and thorns by the which he was prycked in the
world / it seems that he will not avoid fro them / nor he takes no
thought though he come not to his own cu^tre the bliss of heaven. What
trowes thou daughter he would do tha^ if he found in ye world ever
delectacyo^ and rest wtoute pain? Lo all this I fuffer them for to do by my
prouydence / and I grant that the world burgyne to the^ many trybulacyo^s /
that virtues may be proved ymonges them / and for ye pain and vyolence that
they do to themself / I have cause for to reward them. Thus in all things /
my great prouydence with wisdom has provided and ordained for the^ / I have
given them that they have / for (as I said) I am rich / and I may give them.
My riches be infynyte / for all things be made of me / and without me may
nothing be / for if he will have fayrenesse / I am fayrenesse / benygnyte /
pyteous / ryghtewyse / and mercyable god / I am large and no nygarde / I am he
that grant to the asker his reasonable asking / and open verily to the
knocker / and I answer to him yt calls me. I am not unkind / but full of
kyndenesse / I reward him that labors for me / that is for glory and laud
of my name. I am he that is iorunde and merry / ye which keep a soul in
ghostly gladness / that arayeth herself with my will. I am yt high
prouydence that never fails my servants / ye which hope in me / another
body nor soul. Why will not a man believe in me / ye sees how I feed yt worm
in the dry tree / brute beestes in the field / fysshes in the sea / and al
other beestes both of the earth and of the air upon the pla^tes of the world
/ I send reyne and son for to make yt earth fat / and he byleueth not that
I noryshe it / which is my creature. Sythen it is so yt all this is done for
the service of man of my endelesse goodness / for on what side he turns him
(be he spyrytual or temporal) he fyndeth none other thing than fire of my
endelesse charity / and ye great depenesse of my very sweet prouydence (he
sees not this) for fro himself he has take away light / and so takes no
thought to be blind / wherefore he sclaundereth himself / refreny^ge charity
ane^des his neighbors / and so with Auaryce and nygardeshyp he thinks how he
shallyue on the morrow / which is forbydde hy^ of my sothefaste sone Ihesu /
where he says thus. Thy^ke not on the morrow on nygardenesse and Auaryce /
for the malice and ye business of the day / is suffycyent and enough for
himself. Of this here he repreueth you of your infydelyte / showing to you
my prouydence and shortenesse of time / saying thus. Think not on yt morrow
(as though my sothefast sone said thus) think not on yt thing whereof you be
not syker / and he techeth you first the kyngedome of heaven / that is good and
holy lyuy^ge / for I know well of these small things ye have need / and
therefore I have bydde and commanded the earth to give you of his fruyees. This
wretch which yt of his mysse trust has restreyned his heart and his ho^des
fro charity of his neighbor / has not read this doctrine that my sone has
give him / because he follows not his steps / he is intolerable to himself
/ out of this trust in himself / and mysse trust in me / comes all manner
evil. Also they make themself Judges of other men's wylles / and they se not
that I shall Judge them and not they / my will they understand not nor Judge it
goodly. But when any prosperyte or delectacyo^ or plesau^ce of ye world
falls to them / and what yt fails to them in which al their affection and
hope was set / than they can another sauoure nor feel nor receive my
prouyde^ce nor none other manner goods / but the^ seems they be depry^ed fro
all manner of good / and because that they be bly^ded of their own proper
passion / they know not ye richesse which is within my prouydence / nor the
very fruit of pasye^ce / but rather thereby they taste death / and ye ernesse or
sykernesse of hell in this life / and yet not wtstondy^ge this I cees not / but
that I provide for them / for I bydde ye earth that he give to a syn^er of his
fruit / as he gives to a ryghtwyse man / and so to his feeldes I send son
and reyne / as I do to a ryghtewyse man's feelde / and oftentimes a syn^er
has more than a ryghtwyse man. This do the my goodness / for I will that the
soul of a ryghtewyse man be fulfilled more with ghostly richesse / than with
temporal richesse / in asmoche as for my love he has spoiled himself fro
te^porall goods / forsakynge ye world with all his delyces / and also his
own will. These be those that make their souls fat / in spredynge themself
abroad in ye depenesse of my charity / and they forgote the charge of themself
/ for not only of ye delyces of the world they should no charge have / but
also no charge have of themself. Tha^ to such I am verily made their
governance / both bodyly and ghostly / and I use in them one special
prouyde^ce above other general prouydences / for my mylde meekness of ye holy
ghost puruayeth for such as serve him. This thou knows well if thou remember
ye by redynge of lives of holy faders (as vitas patrum) and such other / for
when a certain solytary man was seek / in asmoche as he verily forsook
himself holy for joy and praysynge of my name / my mylde meekness provided
for him / and I send an angel for to govern him / and for to putuaye for his
necessyte / his body was so releued in his need / and his soul was fulfilled
with meruaylous joy and sweetness of the angels conuersacyon. The holy ghost
to such one is a mother noryshynge hy^ at the breast of my dyuyne charity / he
has made him fre as a lord / by putting fro him the bondage and thraldom
of his own propre love. For where the charity of my fire is / there may be no
water of that love which quenches this sweet fire in the soul. This mynyster
yt is the holy ghost / whom I have given to them by my prouydence / arayeth
them / norysheth them / and makes them ghostly drunk with my sweetness /
gyuy^ge to the^ great richesse / for i^ that he has left all / he fyndeth
all. And for because also he has all spoiled himself of himself / he fond
himself all array ed with me / he has made himself a seruau^te of meekness /
and therefore he is made a lord to the world and to his own sensualyte / and
for he has all blinded himself i^ his own syghte / he dwells in parfyte
light mystrustynge himself / and with quycke feythe he is corowned / and with
parfyte and full hope he tastes euerlasty^ge life / de parted fro pain and
bytternesse yt might turment him. All things he Judges for the best / for
in all things he Judges my will asmoche as he may se by the light of feythe
/ and I desire nor will nothing else of him but holiness / and therefore he
is made pascyente. O how blessed is such a soul / that yet dwelly^ge in yt
deedly body tastes vndeedly good / all thing such a soul has in reverence
/ his lift ho^de weyeth asmoche and as truly as his right hand / asmoche he
charge trybulacyo^ as he does comfort / asmoche honger as he does thyrst /
asmoche meet as he does drink / asmoche cold as he does hete / asmoche
scarsyte of clothes as he does pleynte pf clothes / asmoche life as he does
deeth / asmoche worship as he does shame / and asmoche turmente as he does
romforte and solace. In all things he is stydfast and stable / for he is
grounded upon a quycke stone / he knows well and sees with light of feythe
and stydfast hope / that I give al things with one manner love and one manner be
holding that is for your health / and in all things I provide / for in
great labor I give great strength / and I give a man no more for to bear
tha^ he may bear / so yt he will bear it for my love. In the blood of my sone it
is well known to you / that I will not the death of a sinner / but I will that
he he turn to him and live / and for his life I give him that is needful for
him. Such a soul so dysposed fro herself / ioyeth in all such things yt
she feleth or sees of me in her self or i^ any other / she doubts not that
small things shall fail to her / for with the light of feythe she is certyfyed
and made syker of great things / of the which things in ye begynny^ge of
this tretys I told ye. O how glorious is this light of very feythe / with the
which she sees / knows / and preueth my truth / this light is had of ye
blessed mynyster the holy ghost that I gave to them / which is a light above
kind that the soul purchases of my goodness / using the same supernatural
light / as I have give them. How god has provided for souls / gyuynge them
the sacrament for their health / and how he provided for his servants which
be full hongry of desires / when he ordeyneth them to be fed with his sons
body Ihesu christ / where he tells that oftentimes he provided crystes body
by a wonderful manner to a soul yt was full ho^gry. H Nowes thou not well dear
daughter how I have provided for my servants that hopen in me by two manner of
wyses / for all the prouydence the which I use in my reasonable creatures / is
in the soul and the body. And what manner of prouydence I use in the body / it
is done for the service of the soul that it may encrese and grow in yt light
of feythe / whereby she may hope in me / and mystruste in herself / and that
she may know that I am he that am / which may / will / and can / releue
both her health / and also her necessytes. Sees thou not that I have given to
the soul for her life the sacraments of holy church / for it is her meet /
and not great bodyly meet which is given to the body / but ye soul is
vnbodyly / and therefore it lives with such meet that is vnbodyly / that is
with my word. And therefore my oneli sothefast sone said in the holy gospel
thus. A man lives not he said only by bodyly breed / but with every word
that comes out of my mouth / that is for to follow my ghostly intent / the
doctrine and the word of my only incarnate sone Ihesu / ye which word by
virtue of his blood gives life to you in yt that he gives to you these
sacraments / and so this soul receives ghostly lyuelode / by ye i^strument
of the body. That act only of receyuy^ge should not give life of grace / if
ye soul dysposed her not for to receive it with very holy ghostly desire /
which desire is in the soul and not in the body. And therefore I said to the
that those things be spyrytuall and ghostly / which be given to the soul /
for it is vnbodyly / though they be given by medyacyon and mean of a body (as
I have said before / and so by desire of the soul they be given for to be
received other while for to encres her holy honger / in ghostly honger I made
her for to desire it / and yet she may not have it / and in that she may not
have it / her ghostly honger increases / and in that ghostly honger increases
the knowledge of herself / holdy^ge herself unworthy by meks nesse / and so I
make her worthy. Of tentymes in diverse wyses I prouy ded to her of this blessed
sacrament / and thou knows well that it is so / for if thou remember the well
/ thou hase proved it i^ thyselfe / for my mylde meekness of the holy ghost
yt mynystreth him blysfully of my goodness / enspyreth so the soul of some of
my mynysters / which owen of dewte for to mynyster to them that ghostly meet
the sacrament of yt auter / that they be coacte and constrained of the fire of
my charity / that is of the same holy ghost / which gives them a prycke of
conscience / and styrreth them for to feed hongry souls / with yt ghostly
blessed breed / and so to fulfill their virtuous desires And sometime I make the^
and stir them for to dyfferre their desire to ye last end / tha^ after
such long abydy^ge in holy desire / for to fulfill their desire might I not to
such a soul as well in ye begy^nynge as I do at the later ending? Yes
certain as well / but I do it for to make her to encrese in the light of holy
feythe / and that she never defayle / but that always she must needs hope i^ my
goodness / and for to make her both war and wise that she turn not her
heed abacke unwisely / I leave with her honger of holy desire / and therefore I
delayed it for to make ye have my^de of yt soul which came to holy church with
great ghostly honger / and wha^ my mynyster came to the auter / she asked
crystes body / which is al god and all man / and he answered yt he would not
give it to her / than increased in her waylynge / weeping / and much holy
desire. And in my mynyster wha^ he came to ye oblacyon of ye chalyce / encresed
ye prycke of conscience / constrained and coacte by ye holy ghost / which
provided for yt soul / and right as he provided to yt soul wtinforth / right
so he showed it without forth / saying to hy^ yt should mynyster thus. Ask her
if she will be houseled / and I will give me to her gladly. If she had first a
little sparcle of feythe and of love / her desire encresed so abu^dau^tly / yt
her seemed her life would depart fro ye body / and therefore I suffered yt it
should encrese / and yt her proper love / vnfeythefulnesse / and hope yt she
had i^ herself should be dried up. The holy ghost alone prouydeth this without
any mean of other creatures / ye which oftetyme happeth to my servants. And
ymonge al other I shall tell ye of two great meruayles / that you may delight in
seythe to ye co^me^dynge of my prouydence. Have mind and remember ye in
thyselfe what thou herd of that soul / which while she was in my temple of
holy church upon the day of the conuersyon of saint Paul my apostell / with
so great and brennynge desire for to receive this blessed sacrament / breed of
life / and meet of angels / given to men in earth / that she asked to receive
it of every mynyster of mine / which come to the auter for to say mass / and
of all by my ordinance / she was denied / for I would yt she knew though men
did fail her / I yt am her special lover and maker failed her never / and
therefore in ye last mass I keep this manner as I shall tell the. And I used a
manner of sweet dysceyte / that she should be the more ghostly dru^ke with my
dyuyne prouydence. That dysceyte was this / when she said that she would be
houseled / and receive the holy body of christ / the mynyster which served ye
priest would not warn hy^. She than because she was not denied / wened and
abode with great desire for to be hou seled / and wha^ mass was fynyshed and
she saw that she might not be houseled / she encresed in so great honger and
in so great desire / for she might not receive that blessed body / yt with
veryu meekness she held herself unworthy for to receive it / and so she
vndernymed her proper presu^pcyo^ (for as her seemed) she presumed
presu^ptuousli to yt blessed mystery. I tha^ yt enhau^sed meke folk / drew ye
desire and affeccyo^ of yt soul to me / gyuy^ge to her knowledge in ye
depenesse of my endelesse trynyte / illumynynge her eye of intelleccyon i^ ye
power and might of me endeles fader / in ye wisdom of my sothefast sone / and
in ye mylde meekness of ye holy ghost / which be all one / and yt soul tha^
oned herself i^ to great perfeccyon in yt holy trynyte / yt her body was taken
fro ye earth (for as I have said) ye union of a perfyte man is as well in ye
body as in ye soul / and so in this great depenes / yt soul for satysfyenge
of her desire received of me yt blessed sacrament / and i^ toke^ yt this was
sothe / many days after ward in meruaylous wise / she feled i^ her bodyly
taste sweet odor of yt blessed bodi and blood of my sone Ihesu / wherefore she
renewed herself in ye light of my prouyde^ce / which she tasted so swetely.
All this was vysyble to her / and inuysyble to all creatures / the second time
wha^ she was thus houseled / it was vysyble to ye mynyster which said ye
mass / to whom such a case betell / in a time wha^ yt soul with great desire
would come to church to here mass / and for to behold for bodyly passyo^s yt
she had she might not come thither at dutyme / nevertheless she came thither
late / yt is to ye time of co^secracyo^ wha^ ye priest sacred / tha^ in yt one
end of ye church she kneled down / for she might not long sto^de for bodili
feebleness / and there she kneled with great waylynge / saying thus to herself. O
wretched soul sees you not how much you hase received of grace / for you art
now in holy church and sees yt priest at mass / yt art worthy for thy sins
to dwell i^ hell / and yt more she was oppressed by meekness / the more she was
exalted in my syghte / where she had knowledge of my goodness / and so she
trusted yt ye holy ghost should noryshe her ho^ger. Tha^ I gave to her such a
thing yt how yt it came to her she knew not / and this it was wha^ yt priest
came to ye fraccyon of ye host there he should comune hy^ self / it happed ye
one perte of ye hooste which was i^ his ho^des by virtue of my ordinance / it
passed fro ye auter to ye lower end of ye church / and so entered i^ to yt
soul / and she understood well yt she was houseled / but she we^de it had be
inuysyble / and thought with brennynge desire ye as it befell to her often / so she
supposed yt I had satysfyed to her after her desire inuysyble / and yet yt
seemed not to the priest / because he found not ye resydu of ye host /
wherefore he was in great sorrow / save that the mylde meekness of the holy
ghost showed it in his soul who had it / and yet always he doubts unto ye
time she declared it to him / I might not in her avoid yt impedyme^t of
bodyly feebleness / yt she might in dew hour have gone to ye auter for to
receive yt blessid sacrament thereof ye priest (Ihesus certain) but I would she
should have it in experye^ce and prove it / yt by medyacyon of a creature and
without her / in what state and in what time yt ever it be / and in what wise she
couthe desire it / and yet more tha^ she couthe desire it / I may / ca^ and
will / satysfy her as it is said before. Lo dear daughter thus may you know
how I use my prouydence with ho^gry souls / now shall I tell the somewhat what I
use wtin ye soul with out mean of ye body / that is what I use without outward
i^strume^tes / for though I told ye somewhat of ye states of souls / yet also
I shall tell the my prouyde^ce which I use against them yt be abiding in
deedly syn^e.

The third chapyter is of ye prouydence of god / against the^ yt be abiding
in deedly sin / of ye which prouyde^ce yt god uses and ordeyneth for the^
yt be i^ imperfect love and charity / and a short repetycyon of ye foresaid
words / and of other matters / as is rehearsed in ye calendar. Ca. iii.
A Soul other it is i^ ye state of deedly sin / or vnparfyte in grace / or
else perfyte in every of these states / I use to sprede abroad / and give my
prouydenee in diverse wyses with great wysoome / as me seems is spedeful to the^
/ me^ of ye world which lie in shadow of death (yt is of deedly syn^e) I
shall excyte them with ye prycke of co^scye^ce / or else with vexacyon yt they feel
in ye myddell of their hertes in diverse manners / and in so many wyses yt thy
tongue is vnsuffycyent for to tell the^ / and oftetymes they pass out of yt
i^portunyte of peynes and prycke of co^scye^ce which is wtin ye soul / for
the offense of dedly sins / and other while because I draw out of your
thorns roses / wha^ a man's heart co^ceyueth a love to deedly syn^e / or to
any creature without my will / I shall take fro him both time and place / ye he
shall not fulfill his wicked wylles / in somoche that for werynesse of peynes
of heart / which is caused for wa^tynge of his will / in asmoche as he may not
fulfill his mys ruled will / he tourneth to himself with co^trycyo^ of heart and
prycke of co^scye^ce / and there with he throws fro hit his wretched frenesy /
which may well be called a fernesy / for there he thought for to have put his
affeccyo^ in some thing he tha^ sees well yt it is naught / nevertheless yt
creature which he loves wretchedly / was and is a creature / but ye which he
desired of her was naught / nor is naught / for syn^e is right naught / of
ye ylnesse of syn^e which is a thorn yt prycketh ye soul I have draw out a
rose (as is rehearsed before) yt is to provide to their health. Who co^strayneth
me to do this? Not he yt sercheth me not nor sueth after my prouyde^ce / but in
trespass of sin / yt is in delyces / richesse / and states of yt world / but
my own love co^strayneth me / for I loved you or yt ye loved me / I loved you
meruaylously / yt it is which co^strayneth me / and also ye prayers of my
se^uau^tes / and by ye mylde mekenes of yt holy ghost / yt mynystreth to the^
ye worship of me and love of their neighbors / by ye which they search health
of their souls with meruaylous charity / besyenge the^ to please me / and to
bind my ho^des of dyuyne ryghtewysenesse which a wicked man deserved to have
/ thus I am constrained with meke waylynge and co^tynuall prayer. Who makes the^
so for to cry? My prouyde^ce / for I provided to ye need of this deed creature
/ i^ asmoche as it is said of me thus. Nolo morte^. etc. I will not the the
death of a sinner / but I will yt he be turned and live. In thy soul also dear
daughter you sees my prouyde^ce / if you open ye eye of thy soul / that wicked
me^ which ly i^ so great mysery / yt be made stynkynge fylthe of death / and
derke by wantynge of light of grace / for they go sy^gy^ge and laughing
spe^dynge they^r time with vanytes / in delyces / and in great vnhonestes /
wa^tayne in all things / great gloto^s / eters and dry^kers (so ferforth) yt
of their wombes they make their god / with hate / ra^coure / and pride / they go
also with all wretchedness (as I have told ye in another place) they do not
know their own astate / for they walk in such away yt will bring the^ to
ye death everlasting / but if they amend them in their living and go more
warely. It were a great folly for a man yt were co^de^pned to ye death to go
singing and dau^syng as he gothe by ye way toward his death / should it not as
you thynkes? yes certain. In such folly ben such wretches / and in somoche ye
more without any co^paryson yt they receive more harm tha^ they (yt is pain of
ye death of soul) which is more tha^ ye pain of the body / such lose yt
life of grace / and they but life of body / such receive endeles pain / and
they but pain yt is fynyte / and thus they dye in state of da^pnacyo^ / they
go thither singing / blind / fools / and fools above all other fools / my
servants be in ye state of waylynge and wepi^ge / in afflyccyon and tourme^t
of body i^ holy wakynges / and in co^tynuall prayer with syghynges and sobby^ges
/ maky^ge their bodies lene for the health of their souls. But such syngers
as be rehearsed before / they scorn all such and their own scorns fall on
their proper heeddes / when they be in pain / to them that labor for ye love
of me / shall be given fruit of their labor in ye bliss of heaven / which my
own endeles goodness have made hy^ for to dyscerne / for I god ye fader am
ryghtwyse / yt yield to each after his labor / but sothely my servants cesse
not / another for persecucyo^s / scorns / nor unkindness of the^ / but rather
they encrese in more desire and ghostly excercyse. Who makes this yt they
knock with so great ho^ger at ye gate of my mercy? My prouyde^ce yt makes me
provide to yt health of these wretches / and to encrese virtue and ye fruit of
love and charity in servants. These manners of my prouydences be infynyte
which I use in the soul of a sinner / that I might thereby draw him out fro
yt trespass of deedly syn^e. Now shall I speak to the of such yt be risen fro
sin / what my prouyde^ce does in the^ / and yet be vnparfyte / I shall not
declare yt again by repetycyon the state of the soul / for thereof I have told
ye by order / but shortli somewhat shall I say yt. Of the prouyde^ce which god
uses and ordeyneth / for the^ yt be vnparfyte in love. Will you know dear
daughter what manner I use for to arayse an imperfect soul fro her imperfeccyo^
/ other while I provide to her of many diverse thoughts / and bring hre
sometime in to baraynes of soul / oftetymes it seems to such yt be forsake of
me utterly / for they feel nothy^ge ghostly / and they think they be not in ye
world / outtake yt they feel this / yt his will will not offe^de me / this
gate of will which is fre / I will not suffer ghostly enemies to undo it / but
yet I give the^ leave both fendes and other enemies / yt they may smite at al
other gates / but not at this ye which is the pryncypall gate / which keeps
ye cytee of ye soul / nevertheless ye soul has a keeper (yt is fre chose)
which dwells at yt gate / and for this cause I have made fre chose keeper of
that gate / ye after hy^ ye gate be opened / and as he will so be it done or
not done. There be many gates lo^gynge to yt cytee / but princypally there
be.iij. of whom there is one which ever holds hy^ closed and shyt if he will
/ and is ye keeper of all ye other gates / these iij. gates be these / my^de /
intelleccyon / and will / but yt specyal gate which I speak of is will / for if
will consent tha^ by yt gate enters ye enemy of perpre love / and other
enemies yt follow hy^ / tha^ intelleccyo^ receives dethenesse / which is the
enemy of light / and ye my^de receives hate and keeps it / thy^kynge upon yt
iniuryes and wro^ges / which gate is ye enemy of love and of charity of
neyghbourheed. It receives also and keeps delectacyo^s of yt world in diverse
manners / after dyuersyte of sins / which be contrary to virtue. After time yt
these gates be thus opened / ye small doors of ye bodyly wyrtes be opened /
which be instruments answering to ye soul / for you knows well ye yt
mysruled affeccyo^ of man yt has his gates open / answers with these
instruments / whose works be desyled / ye eye of such an vnordynate
affeccyo^ bry^geth none other thing tha^ death / for it sees nothy^ge else but
deed things vnordynately / where he should not. Such vanyte of heart and
lyghtenes with other vnhonestes / is cause of ghostly death / both to hy^ and to
other. O wretched man ye eye which I I have given ye for to behold heaven and
other fayrenes of creatures for me so to se and behold my mynysters / you be
holds rather fylthe in wretchedness of lyuy^ge / and so wynnes death / in the
same wise the ere delyteth in dyshonest things / other to here ye deeds of thy
neighbors by false domes / where I would you herd me / and ye necessite of thy
neighbor / a tongue also I gave the for to show and teache my word / and for
to confess thy defautes / and that you should work with it to yt health of souls
/ and thou uses it to the blasphemynge of me yt am thy maker / and you uses it
to harmy^ge of thy neghbour / bacbytynge / grutchynge / and demynge good works
for evil / and evil for good / thou also blaphemes with it berynge false
witness with slyppery words / putting thyselfe in perell and other / and
thou brekes out with words of wrong / which be as swerdes cutty^ge hertes of
thy even christian / which words stir him to wroth. O how much evil and
manslaughter / how much dyshoneste and wroth / how much hate and loss of
time that comethout of that bodyly lymme. The odor also in his being hurts
with vnordynate and mysse ruled plesaunce in his smelling / and in ye same wise
of tastynge with unmeasurable gulosyte / and mysruled appetyte / desiring many
diverse delyces he looks after none other thing but for to fill his womb /
such a wretched soul sees not nor aspyeth not how her gate is open / which
gate by vnordynate receyuynge of meet and drink / makes the trayle flesh
proud / ready for to be corrupt by vnordynate appetyte. The ho^des also in
withdrawynge of his neighbors goods / and with foul wretched touching /
which be made to do service to his neighbor in time of his sickness / and
for to releue him in his need with alms. Fete also be given to him for to serve
the body / and for to spe^de his going to the profit of his neighbor / for
the glory and laud of my name / but he i^pendeth the use of the^ for to bear
ye body to places of reprefe And thus in many diverse wyses they tryfle and
scorn other creatures / and they corrupt them with their wicked living /
after that it is liking and plesynge to their mysruled will. All this have I
told ye dear daughter / for to give ye cause and matter of waylynge and we
pynge / and yt thou may know how much evil comes fro the pryncypal gate
which is evil / in to ye which gate I will give leave to none enemy for to
enter (as it is said before) but as I said to ye / I give enemies leave for to
smite at the other gates (but not at this) by ye which I suffer the
intelleccyon for to be smytte of a manner derkenesse of the soul / and other
while it seems yt ye my^de has forgete me / and otherwhyle it seems ye al
other bodily wits be in diverse batayles / in beholdy^ge and touchy^ge holy
things / herynge delycyous songs / and smelling sweet odours / and in going
to them / all such things semen to him y they should bring in to the soul
dyshonestes and corrupcyons / but all these sleen not the soul / nor bry^geth
it i^ to deedly syn^e / for I will not that he dye so / but if he be such a
fool for to open ye gate of his will / I give all such temptacyons and
ymagynacyons leave for to stand without ye gate / and in no wise for to enter /
for they may never enter / but when that will co^senteth. Why than do I hold
such a soul in so great peynes and afflyccyo^s by her enemies? Certain not
for she should be take of them and lost / and so lose the richesse of grace /
but I do it for to show it my prouyde^ce and for to make him trust in me /
and not i^ himself / and also for to make him arise fro neclyge^ce / and run
to me with all his ghostly excersyce and business / which am his protector
and defendour / I am a beny^ge fader / for I provide for his health / that he
may be meke and se himself naught / but his being and al his grace should
be set above himself / in knowy^ge of me that am his life / this life he must
know / if he will receive the fruit of my prouyde^ce in all his ghostly
batayles / for I suffer not such batayles always to co^tynu i^ all times / but
they go and come as me seems to be needful and spedeful for ye soul / other
while it seems to such a soul for the great heaviness that it has in
such temptacyon / and for the wantynge of goodly excercyse that it is in the
peynes of hell / and yet not wtsto^dynge such baraynes if she do strive there
with and open not ye gate of will / she shall have and taste endeles bliss for
her mede. A clear cleansed soul dwells holy with me / what that ever she
sees in such things / for her seems yt she cries to me / all for brenned
in my fervent charity / by consyderacyon yt she feleth than and has in my
prouydence / for she feeth welshe shall be drenched in yt greare floode of
temptacyons / but gracyously by him she may come out / and not by her ghostly
excercyse only / in asmoche as suddenly she has received light (not by her
own fyndy^ge) but of my meruaylous charity that I provided to her need in the
time of necessyte / for than not withsto^dynge her ghostly business I would
not put it away fro her. And why in all her ghostly excercyses wha^ she used
prayer and other ghostly means / would I not give her light in put ty^ge away
such derkenesse? Certain for aslonge as she was so vnparfyte / I would not
lest she aretted to her own exercise / which was not done by her. This thou
may se that vnparfyte men by excercyse of batayles may come to parfeccyon /
for in such batayles he proves by experyence my dyuyne mekenes which
provided him / and so by experyence I have made him syker / whereby he
co^ceyueth a parfyte love in my dyuyne prouydence / and so he knows my
goodness / which has made him arise fro vnparfyte love Forthermore I use
first in him a manner of holy dysceyte / for to reyse him out of imparfeccyon /
when I make him conceive in his soul spe cyally a ghostely love / of some
certain devout creature / above the general love had to all ghostly
creatures / by the which mean he wynneth more virtue tha^ he had before / and
so auoydeth his inparfeccyon / for such special love makes him make his
heart naked and spoiled of every other creature which he loved sencybly / be
it fader / mother / sister / or brother / he wtdrawith fro the^ propre sensual
love / and begins to love them that be ghostly / only for me endelesse god
/ and this ordynate lone of that mean which I have gyve him / putting away
vnornate love / where first he loved creatures. Thus thou may know that
such ghostly love set in specyal creatures does away imparfercyon / but now
take heed ye love of this mean techeth more / for it makes him prove whether
he loves me / and yt mean which I have given him perfytely or not / also I
gave hy^ that mean for to prove him / and for to give him cause and matter for
to know himself / for if he knew not himself the which is within him the
which is mine / he should never please him nor dysplease him / and yet not
withsto^dy^ge this knowledge of himself / he is vnperarfyte (it is no wonder)
for being of yt vna^fyte love which he has to me / he must needs bevnperfyte
/ for he loves me by mean of a reasonable creature which is imperfect / but
perarfyte charity of neyghbourheed comes of my perfyte charity / and not my
charity fro them / but with ye same perfyte mean where with he loves me he should
love creatures / if he will avoid imparfeccyo^. But how shall this be know by
such a mean? In many things / for if he will open the eye of his
intelleccyon / than shall no time pass / but that he shall both se it and
prove it / and for because I have showed yt in party this in another place /
therefore a little more shall I tell ye there of now. Se when that he loves a
creature with synguler love (as it is said to the before) by process of time
he shall se well that the delectacyon of that love shall be mynyshed / and also
ghostly co^fortes as he was wont to have of the same creature and other such
mo / or else if it seem to him that ye creature has more and ofter
conuersacyon with other creatures than with him / he feleth than a pain /
which pain makes him to enter i^ to himself and know himself / and than
if he will walk and go with the light of my prouydence as he should / tha^
shall he love more parfytely ye mean than ever he did / for with knowledge of
himself and hate that he has in his own proper sensualyte / he auoydeth
imparferccyon and gothe with parfeccy on / and when he is thus parfyte / he
shall love creatures with more purer special love tha^ ever he did before. Lo
thus I have showed my good nesse by prouydence of such a mean / which mean
I make him to use with hate of himself / and love of virtue i^ this way of
pilgrimage / but he must well be ware that in ye feeling of the peynes of ye
love of creatures (like as it is rehearsed before) he bring not himself in to
confusyon and tedyosyte of the soul / and in to heaviness of heart / for ye were
pereylous / for so that thing which I have ordained for hy^ to life / might
turn hy^ to death / therefore so should he not do / but with good business and
ghostely excercyse / and mekely holding himself unworthy for to have such
comfort as he has desired / and so shall he se that virtue by ye which such
creatures should be loved is not lessed nor mynyshed in him / for than he shall
feel that with honger and desire he will suffer all manner pain / of what side
yt ever it comes / for the glory and laud of my name. In this wise he shall
fulsyl my will / receyuynge in himself fruit of perfeccyon / whereby I have
suffered trybulacyon / and yt mean and such other that he should come to the
light of parfeccyo^. Thus in such wyses I use my prouyde^ce in vnparfyte men
/ and yet in many moo wyses (in so many) yt I know well thy tongue is not
suffycyent to tell the^. Of the prouyde^ce which god uses and ordeyneth for
the^ yt be i^ parfyte love and charity. NOw shall I tell ye of parfyte folk
how I provided for them in keeping of them and proving their parfeccyon / and
that they may always encrese and grow in virtue / for there is none in this
life so perfyte / but that he may encrese in this life to more parfeccyon /
and ymonge all other I keep that form after the words which my sonefast sone
said / which be these. Ogo su^ vitis vera. etc. I am a true vine he said /
and my fader is a tyller / and ye be the branches / he that dwells in that
very vine which comes out fro me the fader suynge his doctrine / he has
fruit / and that your fcuyte may grow and encrese and be parfyte / I water
you as branches of the same vine / and give you to drink many trybulacyons /
that is with wrongs / derysyons / shames / repreues / and sclaunders / both
with word and with deed / also with honger and with thyrste / as it is liking
to my goodness for to give to you / and as each of you is able for to bear / for
trybulacyon is a token yt shewteth parfyte charity of ye soul / and also the
imparfeccyon of the soul / when it tasted with iniuryes / wrongs and labors
/ which I suffer for to come to my servants (pasyence is proved) and the
fire of charity increases and grows in yt soul by compassyon / that it
has to that soul which does him ye wrong / for he soroweth more for the
offense which he does to me / and also for the hurtynge of his own soul /
tha^ for his own injury. Thus do they yt be in great parfeccyon / and so they
encrese / and therefore to them I suffer these wrongs and such other / but I
leave to them a manner of prycky^ge of ye health of souls (in such wise) that
both day and night they knock at the gate of my mercy for them that done
them wrong / so ferforthe that they forgoten them self (as I have told the
before in ye state of parfyte souls) and the more they forsake themself / the
rather they find me. But where find they me? Certain i^ my sothefast sone
Ihesu / going perfytely in his sweet doctrine / they have read in yt sweet
and glorious book his doctrine / and by redynge they have found / that he was
ever well willing to fulfill my obedience / and for to show howmoche he loved
my worship and mankind / he ran under my obedyence with pain and reprefe
unto the table of the holy cross / where he ordained meet for mankind with his
pain / and so with his sufferau^ce and with the mean of mankind / he showed to
me how much he loved my worship / and therefore I say that these well byloued
children that be come to parfyte state with parseuerau^ce / with which and
contynuall prayer showed to me / that in truth and sothefastenes they love me
/ and ye also they have well studied yt same doctrine of my sone / following ye
same with pain and labor which they bear for health of their even christian /
for they fy^de none other mean whereby they might she we very love to me (tha^
by that) but al other means by the which it may be showed that they love me
/ is set upon the pryncypall mean of a reasonable creature (as I have said to
the before) where I told the that every good deed must be done vy medyacyon
and mean of thy even christian / and every good work also / for there may no
good be do / but in the charity of me and of thy neighbor / and but it be do
in yt charity / it may be called no good / though the deeds of them be
virtuous / and iif ye same wise every evil deed is done by this mean / that
is by pryuacyon of charity. Thus you sees well that in this mean which I have
put to you / perfeccyon is showed and pure love which they have to me ever
procuring the health of their noyghbours with much sufferau^ce and pascyence
/ therefore I purge them that they may bring forth more and sweter fruit
with much trybulacyon. Here pascyence casts to me right good and sweet
smell / o how sweet is this fruit and bow profitable to the soul / for she
suffers without sin / which pascyence if she verily se it / there is no
creature but that she would search with great besynes and joy for to suffer /
wherefore I provided for to put to them the charges of great labors / that I
might give them this great tresoure of paseyence / and also that the virtue of
the same pascyence wax not rusty in such wrongs and labors / so yt wha^
time comes that it be need for to prove the same pascyence / and it shall be
found rusty with the ruste of pryue vnpascyence which freteth ye soul /
sometime I use in such a manner of a plesaunte desire that they may ye better
be kept in ye virtue of meekness / for in the time of aduersyte I shall make
their felynges sleep / yt it shall seem to them both in will and in feeling /
yt no manner trybulacy on nor aduersyte greueth the^ not / for they feel it not
/ but as parsones yt were aslepe (I say not as deed parsones) for the sensyble
feeling slepeth in a parfyte soul / but it dies not / for as soon as they
leave devout excercyse and ye fire of holy desire / anon trybulacyons and
aduersytes waken them as sore as it was wont to do / therefore a man that
trusts in this may be as parfyte as he will / but yet it is right spedefull
for hy^ that he dwell always stydfastly in my holy dread / for many that
truste^ in the^ self do fall full wretchedly / which should not fall if they
put away yt trust / and therefore I say in such that be so occupied in
ghostly excercyse the feeling of them slepeth / for though they bear great
burthons / it seemed to them that they feel it not and without grutchynge / of
ye which afterward wha^ they have left their ghostly excercyses / they
should wonder that they did not feel none of their burtho^s / this does my
prouydence that such a soul might encrese and go in the way of meekness /
for than such a soul wisely ryseth up above herself / not sparynge herself
/ but with holy hate and rebukynge she chastyseth her own feeling / which
chastysynge is nothing else / but for to make it sleep more parfytely.
Otherwhyle also I provided and ordained to my great and right specyal
servants in this wise. I leave to them a certain pryckynge / as I did to my
sweet apostell Paul that chosen vessel of eleccyon / to whom when he had
received yt doctrine of my sons sothefaste truth in the depenesse of me
endelesse fader / yet I left with him a prycke and diverse impugnacyons and
conflyctes of his flesh / where that I might not nor yet may not / both to
Paul and to other of my worthy servants / in whom I have le^te a prycke by
diverse manners / yt they should not have it / Ihesus certain. Why tha^ does my
prouyde^ce so? Certain for they should ye more deserve mede / and be kept in
their own knowledge / by ye which knowledge they win very meekness / and
also that they may thereby be mylde and meke to their neighbors and not cruel
for to have compassyon of their labor / for they have much more compassyon
of the^ that be troubled and dyseased / if they suffer disease themself / than
if they had none / and also they encrese in more love / because they be so
anointed with very meekness and brenned in ye service of my dyuyne charity. Thus
with these manners and other mo infynyte wyses / they come to parfyte union (as
I have told the before) in somoche union and knowledge of my goodness / that
not wtsto^dynge they stand in their deedly body / yet they feel and taste the
endelesse good of vndeedlynesse / for though they be in the prison of the body
/ yet they think that they be out of the body. And because they know much of
me / they love me much / and he yt loves much soroweth much / for to whom
love increases / sorrow also increases / in the which peynes and sorrows /
they dwell not in wrongs that be done to them / nor i^ sorrows for bodyly
peynes / nor for heaviness done to them by sendes / nor for none other peyn^
that may come to them / but only they sorrow for the offense which is done
to me / seeing and knowing ye I am worthy to be loved and served. And also
they sorrow for the harm that falls to souls / seeing them fall into the
derkenesse of ye world / and so dwelling and abiding in ye same blyndenesse
/ for in yt vnyo^ which he has made in me by affection of love / he knows
and beholds in me howmoche he loves my creature / and in such beholdynge
that she sees ye a reasonable creature represents my image / she is there
with rapte by love for the love of me / by ye which love she feleth an
intolerable pain when she sees such creatures be fere sro my goodness / and
those peynes be so great / that all other peynes be the less and fail in the
same / of whom he recketh never nor cares therefore / for he fares as though
it were not he yt receives such trybulacyons. Why is yt? For I provide for
the^. Where with? With she wynge to them clear syghte and knowledge of myself
(as it may be in this life) in the which syghte I show them wickedness and
mysery of the world and dampnacyon of souls in comune and in special with
great bytternessr of themself / as it is liking to my goodness for to show
them / so for to encrese ye more in love and in pain / and that also they cry
to me with stydfast hope / and with the light of holy feythe so prycked / and
with ye fire of my desire / for to have help of me / and that I would releue
them in such needs. Also I proved with my dyuyne prouydence for to releue and
help the world / sufferynge myself to be constrained of peynfull / sweet /
and longing desires of my servants / and noryshynge them and encresynge the^
thereby in to more parfyte knowledge and vnyo^ of me. Thus thou may se how I
provide to these parfyte folk in diverse wyses and many ways / for always as
long as ye live / ye be able to encrese i^ state of parfeccyon / and for to
deserve mede / and therefore I purge them fro all their proper vnordynate love
spyrytuall and temporal / and give them drink with the chalyce of many
trybulacyons / for to make the^ to have ye more parfyte fruye (as it is said
before) and that great trybulacyo^ which they suffer / seeing me offended and
fools pryued fro grace / all the less feeling is quenched (in somoche) yt all
the labors that they may suffer i^ this life / they hold it for naught and by
that they charge asmoche trybulacyons as they do co^fortes / for they seek
nothing their own co^fortes / and they love not me for no reward / nor for
their own love / but they seek the glory / laud / and honor of my name. Dear
daughter sees you not now / yt in every reasonable creture I extend and use my
prouyde^ce in many places / and in infynyte places with meruaylous wyses /
unknown of men of derke lyuy^ge / for their derkenesse may not receive such
light / but only they yt have light / and know parfytely and vnparfytely
after the parfeccyon of the light y they have / which light is won and
gote^ by knowledge yt a soul has of herself / whereby it is araysed to light
/ haty^ge most parfytely derkenesse. A short repetycyon of the foresaid
words / and how god speaks afterward of that word which christ said to
Peter. Mittite rethe ad dextera^ parte^ nauis: and inuenietis. That is to say /
cast ye the net on the ryghe side of the ship / and ye shall find. I Have
told yt how that I provided for my servants / and how I have told the both
general and special / and first I told ye of ye blessed sacrament how I
proved it and by what manner for to make ye honger of ye soul encrese / and how
I procure wtin ye feeling of ye soul to the^ grace / ymynystred by yt mean of
yt blessed mynyster ye holy ghost / to a wicked man for to reduce him ye sooner
to grace / to an imperfect man for to bry^ge hy^ ye sooner to grace / and to
perfyte me^ yt they may the more gracyously encrese / and that perfeccyon
might grow in the^ / for they be able to encrese be they never so perfyte /
and also I provide for the^ / yt they may be good perfyte means between me and
man / which is fall to me in war endeles god / for if you remember ye well /
you knows well yt I have told the ye with mean and medyacyo^ of my servants I
wylshewe mercy to ye world / and with such sufferau^ce of the^ / I shall reform
my spouse holy church / certain all such may well be called another christ
crucyfyed / for like as christ my sone took upon him ye pain of you cross for
man's health / tyght so they take upon the^ his office / for he came as a
mean between man and me / for to dystroye battle and war between us both /
and for to recou^seyle man to be i^ peace by much sufferau^ce unto ye cruel
death of yt cross / in the same wise these gone as all for turme^ted by
co^passyo^ / maky^ge themself means with holy prayers / good and holy
co^uersacyo^ for their wickedness between me and the^. All such done shine
ymo^ge sinners as precious stones of verttu / bery^ge and supporty^ge with
pascyence defautes of the^ / they be my hokes whereby I win souls / they also
throw forth their net upon ye right ho^de and not upon yt lift ho^de / as
my soly sothefast sone Ihesu bad Peter and other dysciples after ye
resurreccyo^. For ye list ho^de yt is their own love is deed i^ the^ / but ye
right ho^de lives by a manner of very clear and sweet dyuyne love / with ye
which love they cast forth ye net of holy desire i^ to me ye am yt
peaseable see / and right as it was in ye story when Peter and other yt were
with him drew his net / it was found so full of fyssh / yt they called for
help of the^ of ye other ship. In ye same wise wha^ they draw their net
of holy desire / they catch so great copy of yte of fyssh (yt is of souls)
yt it is spedefull for the^ to call a fellow to the^ for to help the^ to draw
up yt net / for one a lone may not do it / and therefore both in casty^ge
and in drawing up / they must needs have felyshyppe / yt is of very meekness
they call their neighbors by love. Peter as I said and his felyshyp did ask
help for to draw up these fysshes of souls / in ye same wise it is sothe in
my parfyte servants / as you hase well perued / for them seems it is so
great a burthon for to draw these souls which be take in yt net of their
desires / that they call and cry after felyshyppe / for they would that every
reasonable creature should help them / holding themself with mekenes unworthy
without their help / and therefore they cry after help / and tha^ they draw
up souls great ple^te / though some for their own defautes lepe out of the
net and will not abide therein / the net of desire receives all / for an
ho^gry soul of my worship holds her not apayde for to have one perty / but
she would have all / she seeks good yt it may help her to cast fysshe i^ to
her net / and for to keep the^ therein to the encrese of their parfeccyo^ /
she sercheth vnparfyte people for to help to make the^ parfyte / and bad to be
made good / vnfeytheful and mysbyleuers and also men lyuy^ge in derkenes of
sin / wtoute ye feythe of baptym of holy church / to be made feythefull and
to receive ye feythe of holy baptym. Such a soul would have all people / of
what state or what co^dycyo^ yt they be / for they consider and se all how they
be made of my goodness in my great fire of love / and rau^somed by ye blood
of my sone christ crucyfyed. And thus you may well know yt such a soul
receives and takes all i^ ye net of her holy desire / but yet as it is
said before / many of them go out of ye net / which go away fro grace by
their own defautes / both mysbyloued people and other yt live i^ deedly sins
/ and yet nevertheless they be in yt net by co^tynuall prayer / for if a soul
pass away fro me by her own trespass / and fro love and co^uersacyon yt she
should have to my servants / and also fro ye dew time and reverence of the^
/ yet should not affeccyo^ of charity be lessed nor mynyshed against the^ /
for sweet desirous souls have cast yt net of holy desire upon ye right
side. O dear daughter I would you would consider ye act yt my glorious apostell
Peter did / as my only sothefaste sone made him do / when he badde hy^ throw
his net in to ye see / which act is contained in ye holy gospel / and tha^
might you know what Peter said to him. What said he. Peter answered again to
my sone thus / all this night we have labored i^ fysshynge and took no thing
/ but now in this world I shall cast my net / and when yt was done / they
caughte so great copyosyte and multitude yt they called to their fellows in ye
other ship for to come and help them. Daughter if this figure was sothe (as ye
gospel says) yet it is fygured to the (as I have said) and I will yt you
know yt all mysteryes yt my only sothefast sone / other to ye world / or to
his dyscyples / or else without his dysciples showed / be fygured wtin ye souls
of my servants / yt in all such mysteryal fygures ye may have a rule and a
doctrine / wherein ye may behold with light of reason / so yt both to boystyous
parsones and also to clear wytted persons / which have a deep infynyte
intelleccyon / it may so turn by ensample so yt both may have their part
if they will. I told ye yt Peter by the co^mau^dyment of my sons words cast
his net / in yt he was obedyent / byleuynge with quycke feythe for to have
might and power to catch fysshe / and therefore he took many / but not in the
time of night. Knows you well what the time of ye night means? It is
nothing else but ye derke night of deedly sin / wha^ a soul is depryued fro
the light of grace / in this night is nothing take / for he casts not his
net of affection in the quycke see but in ye deed see where sin is found
which is right naught / therefore he yt labors all in vain and with great
innumerable peynes without any profit / by which they be made ye devil les
martyrs and not the martyrres of my sone christ crucyfyed / but when ye day is
come yt they be gone out of sin and come to the light of grace / than
appears to the^ in their souls the precepts and ye byddynges of the law /
which byddeth them for to cast their net in ye world of my sothefast sone
/ yt is to love me above all things / and their even christian as themself /
and so with obedyence and light of feythe and with stydfast hope they cast their
net in his world / showing ye doctrine and ye steps of my right sweet
sone / and of his dyscyples / and how yt he takes souls / and who he calls
for to help / it needs not to be rehearsed / for it is said before. How some
man casts his net more parfytely tha^ another / and of the excelle^ce of
such perfyte me^. THis have I said yt thou might know with how much
prouyde^ce my sothefaste sone Ihesu christ for ye time yt he was conuersaunte
ymonge you / he wroughte such mysteryes and other mysteryall acts for yt thou
should know the^ / and yt ye should do ye same ghostly in ye soul / and
namely such souls as dwell i^ this most parfyte state / and think dear
daughter yt one does more profit tha^ another / after that one is more ready
for to obey tha^ another to this word / and gothe with more clear and parfyte
light / auoydy^ge the hope of himself / and only hops i^ me his maker /
for he that obeys casts his net more parfytely / keeping both ye
co^mau^dymentes and the counseyles mentally and actually / for that keeps not
the counseyles mentually / he may not keep the co^maundyme^tes actually / for
they be annexed and knytte together (as I have declared to ye before in another
place more plainly and fully) and therefore such one catches parfytely / as he
casts parfytely / but perfyte folk catch abu^dau^tly and i^ great
perfeccyon. O how they have their nets well ruled and ordered / for ye good
sweet keeping yt the keeper offer choice does at ye gate of will / altheyr
wits and senscyble fely^ges make swetete sownes / which sownes come out fro
wtin / yt is fro ye cite of the soul / for all ye gates there be shut and
opened. The gate of will is shut to his proper love / and it is opened for to
love and desire my worship / and love of neyghbourheed: Also ye gate of
intelleccyo^ is shut / yt it shall not behold delyces / vanytes / and
wretchydnes of ye world / which be all as night yt given derkenes to
intelleccyo^ / ye which beholds the^ vnornately / and it is opened with
light set in the open knowledge of yt light of my only sothefaste sone
Ihesu. The gate also of mind is shut / that it has no mind of the world
nor of his own sencyble feeling / and it is opened for to receive and bring
to mind ye remembrance of my benefytes / tha^ ye affection of the soul
makes a joy and a sown temperynge ye strings and cords of the heart with
prudence and light making the^ to acorde i^ one / that is to the joy and
praysynge of my name. In this same sown in ye which ye great strings and
myghtes of the soul ben acorded / ye small strings and cords of ye bodyly
wits be also acorded / which wits be yt instruments of yt body / as I
told ye wha^ I spoke to ye of wicked men / for all they sowned deedly sownes
with their bodyly instruments / for asmoche as they did receive their ghostly
enemies / and like as they sown death / so these parfyte folk do sown life /
rereyuynge their fre^des of very effectual virtues / which be instruments of
good and holy works / every lymme and every member trauayleth in yt work
which is give to hy^ for to labor in his parfyte state / that is his eye i^
his lokynge / and e^e in his herynge / ye smell in his smelling / yt taste in
his tastynge / ye tongue in his speaking / ye ho^de in his touching and
workynge / and ye fete i^ their going / and al they acorde i^ one manner of
sown for to serve their eue^ cryste^ for glory and laud of my name / and for
to serve ye soul with good / holy / and virtuous works and for to answer as
i^strume^tes ye obedye^t soul / they be right plesau^t to ye nature of angels
/ and right plesau^t to very tasters / which abide the^ with great loye /
where one shall part with the endelesse good of another / they also be
plesaunte to the world (whyther the world will or not) wicked me^ may not /
but that they must needs feel of this plesau^t sown / and yet many of them with
that fysshynge hoke and with that instrument betake / that is they pass away
fro death and come to life / all seyntes wroughten and took with yt instrument.
The first yt sowned in the sown of life was my right sweet and right well
byloued sone / taking upon hy^ your manheed / with ye which maheed oned to
the godheed / he made a right sweet sown upon the cross / and so he took the
sone of mankind fro yt devil / ye which he had so long time kept for his
syn^e / all ye should follow the doctrine of his master in your best manner.
Of him the apostels took their doctrine / suy^ge and sowynge his word through
all the world / Martyrs also and Confessors / Doctors and Vyrgyns / all by
their manner of seeing. Also the glorious maid Vrsula which sowned so swetely
her instrument / yt she caughte first there with a.xi. thousand vyrgyns / and
after ward multyplyed the nombre meruaylously / both of them and of other
with the same sown. In the same wise thus do other / some in one wise and some
in another. Who is cause of this? Certain my infynyte prouydence / which have
provided to give to them instruments / and also I gave to them away and a
manner / by the which they might give sown / and what that ever I give to them
/ or what that I do suffer for to fall to the^ in this life / it is to the^ a
way for to encrese their instruments if they will know it / and that will do
their light away fro the^. Wherewith se they? Certain with ye cloud of their
own proper love / and with plesau^ce of their own conceyte.

The.iiii. chapyter is of the prouyde^ce of god in general that he uses i^
his creatures in this life and in ye other. Also of the prouyde^ce of god for
his poor servants / helpige the^ with te^porall goods / and other matters as
it is specyfyed in ye calendar. Ca. iiii.
Daughter thy heart shall be made larger / and therefore open the eye of thy
intelleccyon with the light of feythe / for to behold with what love and
prouyde^ce I have made and ordained man / ye is yt he should Joy i^ me most
sovereign endelesse good / for fully I have provided for him both in soul and
body (as I have told the) both to vnparfyte and parfyte / good and evil /
ghostly or bodyly / in heaven and i^ earth / i^ this deedli life and also i^ ye
life of vndeedlynesse. In this deedly life as long as ye live here / I have
bound you with ye bo^de of charity (why there a man will or no) he is bound in
ye same bo^de / if he unloose himself fro affeccyo^ / yt is if he be not in yt
charity of his neighbor / he is bound of need yt both i^ will and deed he
should use charity / and if ye lose it in your affeccyo^ because of your
wickedness / tha^ be ye bo^de and constrained namely of need for to use it i^
act / for I have not provided for to use it to one man alone / nor made each
man know ye thing which is spedefull for him i^ all his life / but one has
one thing of grace and another has another thing / yt a man may have cause
and matter for very need / one to be informed by another. O this you sees by
ensample ye a workema^ or a cra^ftyma^ gothe for to learn somthy^ge of ye
tyller / and ye tyller of ye craftyma^ / so yt one needs to be informed of
another / for ye one can not do yt the other can / in ye same manner a clerk
and a relygy ous man have need of seculers / and seculers relygyous / for ye
one wtoute the other ca^ nothy^ge do / and thus of all other. Might I not give
to euere^ yt yt is needful? Yes certain / but I would with prouyde^ce yt one
meked hy^ to another mekely / and yt they should be coacte by meekness each of
the^ to use together both act and affeccyo^ of charity. I have thus sheded i^
the^ my magnyfysence / my goodness / and my prouyde^ce / and yet they suffer
themself to be led in derkenes of their proper freylte / ye ly^mes of your
body do you shame / for they use charity together (and not ye) for when ye heed
aketh ye hand helps it / and wha^ ye finger which is ye leest ly^me
suffers any pain ye heed is anyuyshed there with though it be ye more worthy
ly^me of ye body. In ye same wise every lymme helps other with co^passyon /
both ye eye and hery^ge with all other parts / so does not a proud man yt
sees his pore ly^mes seek and feeble / yt is pore folk / and yet wtyl not
help them in their need / not only with any temporal good that he has /
nor with the leest word of his mouth / but rather with little setting by
them and repreuy^ge them / he turns his face fro them / he is rich / and yet
he suffers hy^ to dye for ho^ger / but such one sees that his wretched
cruelte casts cruelte to me / so yt his proud dedygnacyon descends done to
the depenesse of hell / nevertheless yet I provide to that poor creature / to
whom for the pouerte shall be rewarded in blys with endeles richesse / and yt
proud wretch shall be sharply repreued of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu / in
such wise as the holy gospel says / but if he amend him or that he dye /
it is written in ye holy gospel thus. O suriui and no^ dedistis michi ma^ducare.
etc. I ho^gred and ye gave me no meet / I thrysted and ye gave me no drink / I
was naked and ye coue^red me not / I was seek and i^ prison and ye came not to
me / it shall no profit be to hy^ tha^ in ye last day for to excuse him
thus. Lord I saw ye never / for if I had seen the / I would have done all this to the. That wretch knows well that thus he sees / yt the which ye do
to the lest of mine / ye do to me / and therefore ryghtewysely to hy^ shall be
given endeles pain with fendes. Lo now thou knows I have provided in earth
for the^ / that they ge not to endeles sorrow / if thou did behold me than
above in the endelesse life in the kinds of angels / and ymonge ye cytesyns
dwelling in that endeles bliss / which by virtue of my sons blood that
vndefouled lamb have received that life / that I should so ordeyne them and
set them in order / that is for to set one for to taste only his own proper
good in that blessed life / and not for to comune charitably and be partener of
the goods of other / nay I will not so / but their charity is so par^ytely
ordained that the great tastes the good of the less / and the less of the
great / I call it little as for the mesure / not for that the less is full of
joy as the most / for each after his degree is full of joy / as it is rehearsed
i^ another place before. O howmoche charytable broderheed there is / and
howmoche oneheed in me / and one with another / for they have that of me / and
they know well that they have it of me which they have / and they keep it with
holy dread and du reverence / seeing and knowy^ge their own dygnyte wherein I
have set them / there angels comune with men / that is with the souls of
blessed men / and blessed souls with angels / and so each of them be joyful
of the good of other in the bre^nynge love of charity / and so they joy in me
with joy and gladness without any sorrow / and swetely without bytternesse. For
wha^ they did live in earth / i^ their dyenge they tasted me by affection of
love in the charity of their even cryste^. Who ordained this? My wisdom with
right meruaylous and sweet prouyde^ce / and if thou turn thy thought to
purgatory / thou shall also find there my sweet and right meruaylous prouydence
in the wretched souls that have lost their time in this world by ygnoraunce
/ and because yt they may be departed from the body / they have no more power
for to help them / as for deseruynge of any delyueraunce of pain / and
therefore I have provided for the^ by mean of you that yet do live i^ earth /
which have time for the^ for to rau^some the^ out of pain by almesdedes and
by mass syngy^ge which they ordeyne for to be said of my mynysters / by
fasting and by prayers done in the state of grace / with all these means ye
abredge their times of pain / by medyacyon of my mercy. Now is this daughter
a sweet prouyde^ce all this have I said to the yt thou should be rapte with
love with in thy soul / in such things as longen to the health of a soul /
and also for thou should array thyselfe with light of holy feythe with stydfaste
hope i^ my prouydence / and that you should throw out thyselfe fro thyselfe /
and in all that thou should do for to hope in me without any seruyle dread. Of
the prouydence of god for his poor servants / helping them with temporal
goods. NOw dear daughter will I tell the a little party of the manner which I
help and releue my poor servants in their bodyly necessyte that hope and
trust in me / and yet nevertheless they be well apayde of their need (other
parfytely or vnperfytely) as they themself be parfyte or vnparfyte. I provide
also to my poor folk dwelly^ge in ye world which be poor in spyryte and
will / that is with spyrytuall intent / I speak not of such as be simple and
poor in the world / for there be many such poor which would no poor men
be / such be rich folk (as touchy^ge their will) for they hope nothing in
me / nor they bear not right gladly they pouerte which I have given to them
for a medycyne to their souls / for richesse should have done the^ harm and
turned them to dampnacyo^ / all my servants be poor folk and not beggars /
a beggar oftetyme has that he would have / and therefore he suffers great
necessyte / but I defayle never my poor servants / as long as they hope in
me / and I led them forth in that pouerte / sometime to the last end / that
they should the better know and se that I am he which will provide for the^ /
by ye which trust they should make them strong with love in my prouydence /
and so gladly for to receive ye spouse of very pouerte / wherefore ye holy ghost
their mynyster with mylde meekness will puruaye for the^ all that is need both
to their bodies by gyuynge of a great desire in the hertes of other folk ye
which may give them / so that they shall go and releue them in their bodyly
needs / all the life of my sweet poor folk is thus governed with the business
which I give to the servants of the world for them / nevertheless yet I
prove the^ in pascye^ce / i^ feythe / and in parseueraunce / for I suffer
sometime to be said and done to the^ both repreues and wrongs / and yet he
that does such wrongs to the^ / I stir them to do them alms / and for to
help them i^ their needs / this is a general prouyde^ce given to my
servants / but sometime I use it in my right special servants with out mean
of any creature only by myself / as you knows well I did to my glorious
seruau^te saint Domynycke / for in the beginning of his order / his brederne
did sufter great need and penury of meet / so ferforth that when the hour of
meet was come and they had nothing to ete / my well beloved Domynycke with the
light of feythe hoping in me yt I should provide for the^ / said to his
brederne thus. Children set ye down to meet / his brederne anon were
obedyent to his words and sat down / than I provided to all the^ yt had
trust in me / and send two angels with right white breed to the^ (in such
plente) that they had great abundaunce thereof many times after / this
prouydence was not done with mean of man / but only by ye benynge myldenes of
ye holy ghost / sometime also I provide for my right special seruaunces a
little quantyte of lyuelode which was not suffycyent for the^ / as thou knows
well I did to ye sweet maid saint Agnes / which served me fro her child heed
unto her last end with great meekness / by ye which meekness with quycke
feythe / at the commau^dyment of my blessed Mary my sons mother / she drew her
to great parfyte pouerte / and so without any temporal substance she bylded
a Monastery in such a place / where sometime was as you knows well a comune
house of women / she thought not when she should bylde it thus / how might I
parforme this / but besyly with my prouydence she made there an holy monastery /
where she gadered together in the beginning xviij. maidens when she had right
naught for to give them of meet and drink / but as I provided for the^ /
ymonge all other things when I had long provided for them as for their
bodyly need / I sufferd the^ three days to be without breed / only lyuy^ge
with herbs / if thou ask me tha^ why I withdraw fro them their necessary
lyuelode / nameli fro such as had hope in me / sythen I have said before that
I would not fail my servants that put their hope in me / but yt they sholden
have such as them needs / wherefore the seems that they lacked their need /
for only with herbs the body of a reasonable creature lives not / for to
speak comunely of such as be not parfyte / for though Agnes was perfyte /
other of her susters were not parfyte in the same perfeccyon / to this I shall
answer the thus. I suffered that i^ her / that she should be fulfilled
plentuously in my prouyde^ce / and other that were yet vnparfyte of her systers
/ myghten have cause by the miracle that shows for to parforme her beginning
and fundament in the light of holy feythe / nevertheless in those herbs or
i^ such other / I might give much grace of releuynge / or else in gyuy^ge
such dysposycyon to mankind that he should better live with ye little herb
and sometime without meet / tha^ he did before with breed and other manner of
meet that be given and ordained for the life of man / thou knows well this is
sothe / for you hase proved this thyselfe / nevertheless wha^ that Agnes had
lived so long (as I have said) with so little quantyte of lyuelode / she
lift up the eye of her soul to me with light of feythe and said thus / fader
my lord end less spouse hase thou made me for to take out these maidens out
of their faders houses / that they shall now peryshe for honger / good lord /
good spouse provide for their need. Lo daughter I was he that made her for to
ask me so / for that I would have her feythe proved / that meke prayer was
right liking to me / therefore I extended my prouydence in her / that when she
stood so before me / I constrained a certain creature in his soul by
inspyracyon of ye holy ghost for to bear to those women five small loves / by
the which the soul of Agnes had reuelacyon / by the which reuelacyon she
turned to her systers and said thus / go daughters and answeree at the whele
/ and take in their breed / they went as they were commanded and and brought
in breed / which was departed ymonges them / and I gave so great might and
virtue to those loves in the departing of them / yt all they were plentuously
fulfilled / and when they had eten / there remained asmoche which they took
fro the table / that they had another time to the full for the need of their
bodyly life. Thus do I with my prouydence which I use with my servants that
be wylfully poor / and yet not only wylfully poor / but poor in spyryte /
for without a spyrytuall intent / it were right naught worth for the^ / as it
happed to philosophers which for the love yt they had to cunning and for
the will that they had to learn it / they set not by riches / and therefore
they made them poor wylfully / knowing very well yt business of ye worldely
and riches would let them / and not to suffer them to come to ye parfyte
knowledge of cunning / which cunning they set before the eye of their
intelleccyon (as for one end) but because this will of pouerte was not done
for the glory and laud of my name / therefore they had another life of grace nor
of perfeccyon / but rather of endelesse death. Of euylles which do come for
keeping and desiring of temporal goods vnordynately. I Have touched ye
somewhat that thou may the better know ye tresour of wylful pouerte in
spyryte. Who knows that? Certain my well beloved poor servants / which
have ythrowe away fro the^ the burtho^ of richesse in to ye earth / that they
might lightly pass forth in their iournaye and so to enter by the strayte
gate. There be some yt both actually and mentally throw it away fro them /
and they be those that both actually and mentually do keep the commau^dymentes
and the cou^seyles / but some there be that only keep the cou^seyles mentally /
spoyly^ge their affection fro riches / for they keep them by vnordynate love /
but ordynately and with holy dread I made no possessoure of the^ / but a
dyspensatour and a puruayoure for poor folk / such one does well / but yet
ye first be perfyte both with more fruit tha^ these have / and also with less
impedyme^t / in whom my prouyde^ce seems more shynynge actually tha^ in these
/ for such one by ye virtue of very pouerte holds himself meke and low i^
his own syghte / of ye which meekness I have told the before in another
place / therefore I shall tell the more now only of ye virtue of pouerte. I have
told ye if thou have mind / yt all evil / all harm / and all ye pain in
this life / and in ye other life of peynes / do come fro the love of delyces /
but now shall I tell yt what good comes of pouerte / all peace and rest comes
of pouerte / be hold now and se of what chere my very poor servants be of /
with howmoche joy and iocundyte they dwell / they be never sorry / but for
offense yt is done to me / which sorrow tourme^teth not their souls / but it
makes ye soul fat in grace / for their pouerte they wy^ne endeles riches /
and because they have forsaken derknes they find ye most perfyte light / for
ye forsaky^ge of ye world / they have spyrytual joy / for ye forsaky^ge of
deedly goods / they fy^de vndeedly goods and so receive ghostly co^fortes /
for to have labor and pain / it is a refresshynge of ye soul with
ryghtwysenesse a fraternal charity / they live with every reasonable creature /
they accept no more one creature than another / but if they be such yt be
more virtuous tha^ other / i^ such shyneth ye virtue of holy feythe and of very
hope / i^ the^ bre^neth ye fire of dyuyne charity / ye which do lift up and
avoid their hope fro ye world / and fro all va^nerychesse / and they have
enbraced ye very spouse of pouerte with ye light of very feythe / which they
have in me yt am most sovereign and endelesse blessydnesse. Will you know
which be ye hand maidens and servants of very pouerte? Certain vylyte /
abieccyon / co^tempte of man and of himself / and very mekenes / which do
serve and noryshe affeccyo^ of pouerte in ye soul.

The fyfte chapyter is of ye excellence of them which be poor i^ spyryte /
and how christ taught us of this pouerte / not oneli by word / but by
ensample / also of ye prouydence of god for the^ yt take this pouerte / and a
short repeticio^ of ye fore said dyuyne prouyde^ce / also other matters / as is
reherced in the calendar. Ca. v.
My very servants bre^ned i^ yt fire of charity / forsook richesse and their
sencyble feeling / like as the apostell Mathewe did / ye which forsook riches
/ and sued my only sothefast sone Ihesu / which taught you both a manner and
rule for to love and follow very pouerte / and he taught you not only by
word / but by ensample / for fro the begy^nynge of his birth unto ye last
end of his life / he taught you this doctrine by ensample / he himself wedded
fro you this spouse of very pouerte / not withstondynge that he was most
sovereign blessydnesse by union of dyuyne nature / by the which he is one with
me and I with him / and if thou will se him meke and low in great pouerte /
behold god made and arrayed with ye vylyte of your ma^heed / so you may se
that sweet and right well byloued Ihesu borne in a stable / for to teache you
that live in this life / ever for to be borne in the stable of your own
knowledge / where ye should find me borne by grace within your souls. Also
thou may se him lyenge in ye mydle ymonge beestes / in so great penury yt Mary
his mother had not where with to cover him / but in the cold time with the
brethynge of those beestes and with hay he was made warm. Lo he yt was the
fire of charity would suffer cold in his man heed all the while that he was in
ye world on live / both in presence of his dyscyples and in the absence of
his dyscyples / so that otherwhyle for honger his dyscyples did gader the eres
of corn and ete them / and yet in ye last end of his life he was dyspoyled
of his clothes and scorged all about a pyller / and also with great thruste he
hanged upon the cross / i^ such penury and pouerte yt both the earth and the
tree which he hanged upon defayled him so that he had no place where he
might lay his heed / but that he must needs rest his heed upon his shulder
/ and also he that was dru^ke with love / he made to you a bathe in his blood /
by shedynge of his blood / in opening of his body on every side / and he
being so in such myseri gave to you great richesse / and also he being upon
the strayte tree of the cross / he gave plentuously his largeness to every
reasonable creature / and by tastynge of the bytternesse of gall he gave to you
sweetness of great suauyte / and he being in sorrow gave to you comfort /
and he being bound and nailed to the cross delivered and unloosed you fro ye
bond of deedly sin / and in that he was made seruau^te / he made you fre and
delivered you fro the deuylles danger / and i^ that he was sold he raunsomed
you by his blood / and in that he took death he gave you life / in ye which
death he gave to you the rule of love / showing more love to you tha^ he ought
for to do to you / that were to him and to me endelesse fader deedly enemies /
he gave to you also a rule of very meekness / in that he suffered in the most
repreuable death of the cross / repreues / and shames sufferynge the^ right
mekely / he gave you also a rule of very pouerte / for as it is written of him /
Foxes have caves and dens / and birds of ye air have nestes / but ye sone
of man has not where he may lay his heed. Who may verily know this?
Certain he yt has ye light of very feythe. In whom may thou find this
f^ythe? Certain i^ poor folk of spyryte yt have take for their spouse ye
queen of pouerte / this queen has a realm in ye which realm is never war
/ but pease and rest / she is full of ryghtwysenesse / for all
vnryghtwysenesse is departed fro her / ye walls of her cytee be wells / for
the fou^damente thereof is not set upon the ground / but on a quycke stone
Ihesu my only sothefaste sone / within is light / without derkenesse / for the
mother of this queen is the depenesse of my dyuyne charity / the rayme^t of this
cytee is pity and mercy / for the tyrau^t of riches which used cruelte is
pulled away fro thens / there is one manner benyuolence with all the cytesyns /
that is love of neighbor heed / there is also long parseuerau^ce with prudence
/ which governs not his cytee vnprude^tly / but with great prudence besyly
waking / and therefore a soul that is wedded to this right sweet queen of
pouerte / she has made herself a lady of all these riches / and she may not
be lady of one / but she be lady of all / and as often as ye appetyte of riches
falls in that soul / so often she is departed fro this good / and fyndeth
herself with great mysery without the cytee / and if it so be that she be
found feythfull and true to this spouse ever and always / ye same spouses
pouerte will largely depart with her abundaunt riches. Who may se this great
excelle^ce of pouerte. Certain none but such a soul / i^ whom shyneth the
light of feythe / this same queen pouerte / arayeth a soul with great purete
wtdrawy^ge richesse / which made her clean and depryued her from wicked
thoughts / and gyuy^ge to her good / she draws out also fro her ye business
of the world / and when yt bytternesse is gone / tha^ remains in her
sweetness / she cutteth away fro her the thorns / and tha^ remains the
rose / she also dyscargeth the stomach of the soul fro the corrupt humors of
vnordynate love / and makes it light / and after time it is so voyded / she
fylleth it with meet of virtue / which gives great sweetness / she sets
there also the servants of holy hate and of love / for to purge and array the
place for those servants of holy hate of vices and of proper sensualyte /
turns ye soul and both cleanses it and purges / and love of virtue arayeth
her / by putting away fro the^s all manner doubts / depryuy^ge her fro
seruyle dread / and gyuyne to her sykernesse with holy dread / all graces / all
plesaunces / and all delyces that such a soul yt has wedded ye queen of
pouerte can than desire. She fyndeth / she is not than afraid of brydges / for
there is none that may make debate and war with her / she is not yet afraid
of honger nor of derthe / for feythe sees and hops in me his maker / of
whom comes out all riches and prudence / whom always I noryshe and feed. Was
there ever found any very servant of my spouse of this pouerte / which did
ever peryshe for honger? Nay certain / but there be found ynowe yt do
peryshe of them which abounden in great riches / and trusten rather in their
riches tha^ in me / I fail never the ryghtwyse man / for he fails never to
hope in me / and therefore I provide to them as a benynge fader and a pyteous /
o with howmoche joy and largenes of her tes many have run and come to me /
wha^ they knew well with very light of feythe / yt fro the beginning unto ye
end of world how I use and have used and shall use my prouyde^ce in all
things both spyrytuall and te^porall / all such I make them suffer much
thing for to encrese them i^ feythe and hope / and yet I reward the^ ever for
their trauayles / for I failed them never in nothing that is needful for them
/ they have fully proved ye depenesse of my prouyde^ce / by tastinge therein the
milk of midiuine swetenes / wherefore they dread not ye bytternesse of death /
but with longing desire as deed folk they run to this queen of pouerte / as
such yt be rapte in love / and quycke in my will / for to suffer cold /
honger / tryst / hete / scorns / and repreues / putting away fro them their
proper sensualyte and riches with great desire gyuy^ge their lives / for love of
life yt is of me yt am endelesse life / and shedynge their blood / for ye love
of my sons blood. Behold and se what lovers of pouerte have be before the /
that is apostels / martyrs and other glorious seyntes / as Peter and Paul /
Steven and Laurence / and such other / which wha^ they were put in the fire
for to brenne / they seemed that they stood in no fire / but rather on flowers
of great delight / and Laurence was joy full wha^ he said to the tyrant thus /
that one side is roasted enough / turn it and begin to ete thereof. What was
ye cause? Certain for ye fire of dyuyne charity had quenched in him ye feeling
of his little sensualyte. To Sceue^ also stones were sweet. What was ye cause?
Certain love / with the which love he wedded ye queen of pouerte / and
forsake ye world for glory and laud of my name / and took that queen pouerte
with the light of holy feythe / with stydfaste hope and very obedyence / both
obeyenge to the commaundymentes and also to ye cou^seyles / which my only
sothefaste sone Ihesu has given to the^ / for to be kept both actually and
mentally (as it is said before) all such true servants of mine have desire
for to dye / for this bodyly life is to them dysplesau^ce / they desire not for
to dye / for this bodyly life is to them dysplesaunce / they desire not for to
dye for to eschew labor / but only for to live in me endelesly that am their
end. And why do they not dread death which naturally a man owes to dread?
Certain for ye spouse of pouerte whom they have wedded has made the^ sure /
withdrawynge fro the^ both love of the^ self and also of riches / and so with
virtue they have put under fore natural love / and have received ye light and
that divine love / which is above nature it is no peyn for such a man for to
for sake his life and his riches / for to hy^ ye loves not his natural life /
and also worldely riches / he may not sorrow for the^ / but rather he delye
thin forsakynge the^ whom he hates / so yt on what side you turn the / you
shall find in the^ perfyte peace and quietness and all good / and to wretches
yt have possessyon of te^porall goods with much vnordynate love / it is right
great intolerable pain both to forsake their riches / and also for to
forsake their lives / though it seem the contrary by outward sight / but in
effect is so / many would say yt poor Lazar stood in great mysery when ye
rich man stood i^ great joy and quietness / and yet was it not so / for the
rich man suffered more pain with his riches / tha^ pore Lazar did with al his
sores. Why was ye? Certain for in hy^ of himself was a quycke will / fro ye
which comes out al pain / and in Lazar his own will was deed and quycke in
me / which i^ peine had comfort / when he was expulsed fro me^ / and nameli
ye rich man yt is dampened / this Lazar was another noryshed nor governed of me^
/ and therefore I provided for hy^ thus / yt an unreasonable be should lycke
his wou^des / and in ye dyenge of both / Lazare was take up to life
everlasting / and ye rich man was buried inhell / and therefore rich me^ be
dwelly^ ge in sorrow / and poor me^ which be my parfyte servants ever i^
great ghostly joy / for I give the^ to souke milk of many trybulacyo^s / and
so because they have forsake all thing / they have all me / the holy ghoost
also is both noryshed of their souls and hodyes / in what state yt ever they
sto^de in / I provide also for the^ of beestes in diverse wyses / as they have
need to search solitary folk / also I make another solytary man go out of his
Cell and releue him in his need / for you knows well how ofte^tymes it has
happed to the yt I have made ye go out of hy Cell for to socour ye poor / also
I have made ye thyselfe to pue this prouyde^ce in experye^ce / when I have made
other to satysfy to thy need / and yet wha^ creatures failed ye / I failed ye
never yt am thy endeles maker therefore thus i^ al wyses I provide for
creatures. But whe^se comes this trowes you yt a man sto^dy^ge in riches and in
so great charge of his body with much raiment and many clothes / and ever is
seek / and also of whom may this come / that a man which has despised
riches and chosen pouerte for ye love of me having but one coote for to cover
his body there sometime he had many and is by come both strong and hole /
and yet more over hy^ seems yt it greueth hy^ not / another harm of ye body /
cold / hete / nor yet no great boystyous metes. Whe^se comes all this trowes
you? Certain fro my prouydence yt I have provided for hy^ / and take ye charge
of hy^ upon me / i^ asmoche as he has fully forsake himself / thus dear
daughter you may se in howmoche delyces my poor servants enhabyte. A short
repecycyon of ye foresaid dyuyne prouydence. Now have I told yt ye lest
perty of my prouyde^ce in every creature / and in all manner of people /
showing yt ye fro ye begynny^ge wha^ I made yt world and also creatures /
gyuy^ge the^ bey^ge to ye image and likeness of me / unto the last day I use
and have do and do what yt ever I do with prudence / so to ordeyne and provide
for your health / for I desire nothy^ge of you / but your holiness / and al
thing yt is given to you which is of my substauce and being / is given to
you only for ye same end / yt I might use in you my prouyde^ce / this is not
known with wicked worldely me^ / which have put fro them the light / by the
which they should se this / and also I have told yt because they know it not
/ they be sclau^dred in me / nevertheless with pacyence I suffer the^ / abiding
ever unto the last ever prouidy^ge to the^ for their needs / as well to
sy^ners as to right wise me^ / both in spyrytuall and te^porall things. Also
I told yt of the imparfeccyon of riches / yt in what wretchedness they be
brought in / which have riches in possessyo^ by vnordynate love / and also I
told ye of ye excelle^ce of pouerte and of riches / yt ye queen of pouerte
gives to a soul which has chose^ her for her spouse / felyshypped with yt
suster of vylyte / of ye which vylyte with obedience together / I shall tell the
afterward. Also there I showed to the / howmoche pourte pleases me / and how
dear it is to me / and how yt I provide to it meruaylously with my prouyde^ce. All this have I told yt for ye co^me^dacyon of this virtue of pouerte / and also
for ye co^me^dacyon of perfyte feythe / with ye which feythe a soul comes to
this the most perfyte and most excellent state of pouerte / yt she might
encrese in feythe and hope / and yt also she might sorowfully knock at the
gate of my mercy. Therefore dear daughter think this in thy soul with quycke
feythe / yt I shall utterly fulfill thy desire / and also the desire of my
servants / though they suffer much unto the last end of their death. But
be not dysconforted / be glad and joyful in me yt am thy defender and co^forter
/ lo daughter now have I satysfyed thy desire of my prouyde^ce / of ye which
you prayed me yt I should provide for yt necessites of my creatures / and thus
you knows and hase well seen / yt I am no dyspyser of very holy desires. How
this soul wha^ she gave worship and thanking to go / she prayed yt he would
speak to her of the virtue of obedyence. THa^ that soul had such delight in
that very holy pouerte / and rapte by love as a dru^ke^ soul in the endelesse
magnyfycence and transformed in the depenesse of his meruaylous prouyde^ce (so
ferforth) that she bey^ge in ye vessel of ye body / wened that she had be
without the body / by rauyshynge of the fire of his charity made i^ her / she
beheld stydfastly with ye eye of her intelleccyon i^ his dyuyne majesty /
saying thus to ye endelesse fader. O endelesse fader / o blessed fayrenes / o
endelesse wisdom / o endeles goodness / o endeles myldenes / o worthy hope / o
refute and refressher of sinners / o meruaylous largeness / o endeles and
infynyte good / o all wounded in love / me seems yt you hase need of us
wretched creatures / for thy speech shows as thou couthe not live without us
/ not withsto^dinge thou art endelesse life of whom all things taken life /
without whom may no thing live / why art you so wounded in the love of thy
reasonable creatures / they forsake ye and thou serches them / they fle fro the
/ and thou comes night to them / more nerer thou myghe never come / than for
to se^de thy only sothefast sone Ihesu to take our flesh upon him. O good
lord what shall I say what shall I speak / all my speaking is to the no
speaking / therefore I shall say thus as a child does / a / a / a / for I can
none other speak / the tongue of my body is such that it shall have end / and
therefore it can not express the affection of the soul / which desires
i^fynytely / me seems that I may say as ye blessed apostell saint Paul said
that was thus. The eye may not se / ye ere may not here / nor in to the heart
may nor ascend such things / as I have seen And what hase thou seen
wretched soul I have seen the pryuytes of god / which is vnsefull a man to
speak. What shall I than say? Certain I may nothy^ge say worthyly / thus
abiding i^ my bodyly wits / butone thing I say to ye soul thou hase
tasted and seen ye depenesse of the endelesse prouydence of god / therefore
blessed fader withou end I thank the of thy great goodness showed to me
most wretch unworthy grace / and because I consider wei yt you art a fulfyller
of holy desires / I desire the yt yet a little you vouche safe to speak to me of
the virtue of obedyence / and of his great excellence / as thou endeles fader
behyght me / that I may also be rapte in love with that virtue / and that I may
never be departed nor pass away fro thy obedyence / therefore endeless fader I
beseech the for thy infynyte goodness tell me some what of the parfeccyon of
virtues / and where I may find it / and what is the cause why it is taken
away fro me / and what thing it is that gives it to me / and a token that I
may know whyder that I have it or not.

And here now mother and sustren ends your.vi. book / in the which you may

Septima The seventh book.
The first chapyter of the seventh party / and the chapyters of this party
speak of the virtue of obedyence / and first how odedyence is had / and what is
that thing / which puts obedyence fro us / and what is the token of
obedyence yt a man has it or that he have it not and who is the fellow of
obedyence / and of whom it is noryshed / and of other matters / as it is
specyfyed in the calendar. Ca. i.
obedience In obedience

THan the most sovereign / endelesse / and pyteous fader turned his eye of
mercy and myldenesse to the beudure soul / and said thus. O dear daughter
holy desires and ryghtwyse petycyons should be herd / and therefore I most
sovereign truth shall fulfill truly my promise / in yt that I behyght to
satysfy to thy desire / thou hase asked me of obedience where thou might find
it / and what is that thing that puts away obedyence fro the / and what is
ye ^oke^ how it may be known whyther a man have obedyence or not. To this I
answer and say / that thou fyndes obedyence most p^rfytely in my right sweet
and well byloued only sone Ihesu / for in him ye virtue was so parfyte / that
he ran for to fulfill it unto ye most (...) death of ye cross / and what
thing it is yt withdraws obedience away fro the / I shall also tell yt the
cause that you must behold in ye first man Ada^ / and there thou shall find
ye very cause yt avoided very obedyence fro him / which was put to hy^ of me
endelesse fader / behold well and you shall se yt it is pride / which came out
fro his own proper love and plesau^ce of his fellow Eve / this is the cause yt
withdrewe ye parfeccyon fro obedience / and brought in vnobedyence / by ye
which life of grace is withdraw and death is brought in / fro innosency unto
uncleanness yt man is fall in / and in to great mysery / yt token for to know
yt thou hase this virtue is pacyence / and he yt has not pacyence / shows
well that he has no obedience / but take heed yt in two manner of wyses
obedyence is kept. The one is more perfyte than ye other / yet be they not
departed ysonder / but knytte together (as I have told ye beofre) of ye
cou^seyles and precepts / yt one is good and parfyte / but ye other is more
perfyte / and there may none come to life everlasting / but he be obedyent /
for without obedience may none enter there / because it is opened with yt keye of
obedyence / and shut with the keye of inobedy^^^ neu^r the less I (...) by my
infynyte goodness seeing that man which I ioued somoche / (...) not come
again (...) am his parpetual end / took ye k^yes of obedyice and (...) the^m
yt hands of my only sothefast sone Ihesu / and hy^ as a porter has shut
ye gate of Ihesu / so ye wout this (...) of (...) and this porter may none
enter there. And therefore my sone said in ye holy gospel / yt none may come
to ye fader / but by him / helest with you his sweet keye of obedience / wha^ he
ascended to me / for he left it with his Vycar in earth / to whom all ye owe
to obey unto the death / and he yt is out of obedyence / he dwells i^ ye
state of da^pnacyo^. I will now yt you se and know this great excellent virtue /
in my meke vndefouledla^be Ihesu christ. Fro whe^se came yt obedience? Certain
of my blessed sone Ihesu christ / for love yt he had to my worship / and to
your health. But whense came ye love? Fro ye light of clear sight / with the
which a soul sees clearly ye dy^uyne essencyall being and ye endeles trynyte
/ and so always it sees me endelesse god. This vysyo^ wrought so parfytely in
hy^ / yt he put away fro you your infydelyte / which also was to me his
endelesse fader so true / yt he ran with ye glorious light by the way of
obedience / as such one that were all rapte i^ love / and because love goes
not alone / but ture with felyshyp of very ryall virtues / for every virtue takes
life of the love of charity / than my sone Ihesu had whi^ love virtue assocyate
thereto / though virtues were otherw^se on hy^ / and all otherwise in you / but
ymo^ge all virtues they yt be very obedye^t / be very pacyent which is ye
pythe of obedyence / and it is a very parfyte token for to know whyther a
soul have obedience virtuously or not / or whyther it be i^ grace and love
truly or not / therefore ye mother charity has given pacye^s to ye virtue
obedience / for her sister and she has so coupled the^ together / yt ye one
may never be departed fro the other / for other you hase both or none. This
virtue of obedience has also a norse which norysheth her yt is very meekness
/ for a man is somoche obedye^t / as he is meke / and so much he is meke / as
he is obedye^t / this mekenes is ye berer and norse also of charity / for ye
milk of charity no rysheth ye virtue of obedience / the clothing yt this norse
gives to this virtue of obedience is vylyte / yt is setty^ge little by their
self / and arayenge their self with shamis and repreues / in dysplesynge of
their self / and plesynge of me. In whom shall you sy^de this? Certain in christ
my only sweet sone / who despised and set less by himself tha^ he did / he
fulfilled himself with repreues / shames / and scorns / and he to ye vtterest
dyspleased himself (yt is his bodyly life) for to please me / who was more
pacyent than he / for there is was no noise of grutchynge herd of hy^ in no manner
of wise / but with pacyence he fulfilled lowly my obedience / yt was put to hy^
of me / therefore in hy^ ye should find this virtue of obedience parfytely / he
left to you this doctrine and this rule / which rule he kept first himself
/ he is that rule which gives life / for he is ye ryghtwaye to life / and
therefore he says himself thus. I am way / truth / and life / and he yt
goes by him / gothe i^ light / and he yt goes in ye light may not sta^ble
nor fall / for ye light does away fro him derkenesse of his own proper love
/ by ye which he fell in to inobedyence (as I have said ye) yt the fellow of
obedience is meekness / so I say to ye yt inobedyence comes of pride /
which pride proceeds out of ye proper love and depryueth a soul fro
meekness / ye suster of inobedye^ce yt comes out fro proper love is
vnpacye^ce / and pride norysheth it with the derkenesse of infydelyte / re^nynge
by ye derke way / that yeldeth and gives endelesse death / therefore I will yt
all ye read in this glorious rule of my sone Ihesu / where ye shall fy^de al
manner virtue. How obedyence is a keye wherewith heaven is opened / and how ye keye
must have a thonge and be borne by a gyrdell. Sy then I have told the where you
shall find the virtue of obedyence and fro wense it comes / and who is her
fellow / and of whom it is noryshed / therefore now shall I tell the both of
them that be obedyent / and also of them that be inobedyent together / and of
obedyence both in general and in special / that of obedyence / all the
commaundymentes / and all ye cou^seples / and all your feythe is grounded upon
obedience / for in ye virtue of obedience / ye show youreselfe feythful and
true / generally of my sothefastnesse be put to you the precepts of the law.
The pry^cypal co^mau^dyment of the law is to love me above all things / and
your eue^crysten as your self / and these two be so knytte and coupled
together with other / that one of these may not be kept / but all other be kept
/ for he yt keeps this keeps all other / and is both to me and to his
neighbor feythefull and true / he loves me and stondeth in the love of my
charity / and therefore he is obedyent / he makes himself so get to the
commau^dymentes of the law / and to reasonable creatures for me / and with
meekness and pasyence he suffers all manner labor and detraccyo^ of his
neighbor. This obedience was and is of such excellence / that all ye thereof
have take and received grace / like as of inobedyence ye took and received
death / it had not be enough for you that that same obedience had be soly in
my sone / and you yourselfe had not excercysed it. I told the right now of
that obedience was and is a keye where with heaven is opened / which keye my
sone he has put in his Vycars hondes / and his Vycar has put the same
keye in the hondes of them that have take the sacrament of holy baptym / in
receyuynge of the which baptym / he promytteth to forsake and renounce the
devil / the world / delyres / and all his pompes / and so in such promise
for to obey / he receives the keye of obedyence / and thus each man has it
in special / and it is ye same keye that my sone had. Therefore if a man go not
with light of feythe and with the hand of very love, for to open with this
keye the gate of heaven / he shall never enter therein / though my sone haur
opened it by his asce^cyo^ / for though I made you without you / and loved you
or yt ye loved me / yet without you I may not save you. Therefore ye must bear
your keye of obedience in your hand / and ye must be ever going and no
sitting / that is going by the doctrine of my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
(and not sytte) that is not setting your affection in thing yt shall have
end / as fools do that follow after the old man / that is their first fader
Adam / doing and workynge as he did / which threw fro him the keye of
obedyence in the fenne and fylthe of uncleanness / brekynge it with ye hamer of
pride / and made it rusty with his own proper love / and there it lay and
rusted unto the time my sone came which took that keye of obedyence out of the
fenne / and cleansed it in the fire of his dyuyne charity / and washed it in his
precious blood / and he made it bright with the sword of ryghtwysenesse /
rubbing away your wickedness upon the Anuelde (his blessed body) and there
he shope it and made so parfytely / that as often as a man dystroyeth ye keye by
his own fre choice / by medyacyo^ of my grace he may if he will with these
instruments make it and shape it new again. O blind man and more than a
blind man / that after time thou hase dystroyed the keye of obedyence / takes
you no head nor charge for to make it again / byleues thou not that right as
inobedye^ce has shut and closed heaven / right so obedyence may open it /
trowes thou yt pride which fell fro thens shall ascend thither again / trowes
thou for to come in thither to ye wedding feast with thy foul torn cote /
wenes thou that if thou sytte and bind thyselfe in ye bond of deedly sin /
that thou may come thither and open the gate without the keye of obedience
(thy^ke it not) for tha^ thy thought is dysceyued / thou must be unloosed out of
deedly sin by holy confessy on and contrycyon of heart / and satysfaccyon
with an holy purpose neuermore so to offend. Than shall you cast thy foul
ragged cote in to ye earth / and thou shall run with thy wedding cote with
light of feythe and with the keye of obedience in thy hand for to open the
gate of heaven ha^ge therefore this keye by ye tho^ge of abieccyon and bylyte /
and dysplesau^ce of thyselfe and also of the world / of the which
dysplesaunce thou shall make the a gyrdell / than gyrde the fast that thou
lose not thy keye of obedience. Know well dear daughter that there be many
which have take this keye of obedyence / for they know well and se with the
light of feythe / that they may none otherwise ascape endelesse dampnacyon yet
without gyrdell gyrde to them they hold it in their hand / and also without
thonge with inforthe / yt is that they array them not within with the cote of
my plesau^ce / but rather plesen themself / al such have not yet the thonge
of abieccyon and vylyte / desiring to be most abiecte and vile / but they have
more delight of the presynge of me^ / these be right able for to lose their keye
of obedience / when there comes never so little trybulacion be it bodyly or
ghostly / and but that they be right well ware by folly of the hand (of holy
desire they lose it) ye which loss is nothing else / but a manner forsaky^ge
for all yt will search thereafter / they find it as long as they live / and
those that will not search thereafter / they may never fy^de it. But how may it
be known when it is lost? Certain by impacyence / for pacyence is knytte
with obedyence / he that is not pacyent / it shows well that there is no
obedience in ye soul. O how sweet in this virtue of obedyence and how glorious
in ye which be all heavenly virtues / for she is conceived and borne of charity
/ in her is grounded and set the stone of holy feythe / she is a queen / for he
of whom she is a spouse / feleth never, no evil / he feleth ever peace and
quietness / for there may never no te^pestes of the sea grieve him nor noye
him / he feleth never wrongs / for he will ever obey as it is commanded to
him / he has no pain / for his appetyte is ever full / in asmoche as
obedyence has made him well ruled and ordained only for to taste me that may
/ can / and will fulfill his desire. He has also dyspoyled himself fro
worldely riches / and so i^ alother things which were to long to tell / he
fyndeth peace and quietness. O obedyence yt without labor of ship and perell /
you comes parfytely to ye haven of health / you co^fortes ye with my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / for you asce^des to ye ship of the holy cross / there
making the ready for to suffer / where thou desires not to pass the very
obedience of my sone / nor for to go out of his doctrine / tha^ you makes to ye
of ye cross a meettable / where you etes and receyues meet of ye health of thy
soul / dwelling and abiding in the love of neyghbourheed / thou art oned
and coupled with very meekness / and therefore you desires not thy neighbors
good against his will / you art right without any crokednesse / for thou makes a
right heart and not a feyned heart to love my reasonable creatures freely and
not feyntly / you art a graye morning / which ledes with the light of dyuyne
grace / you art a son yt warmes / for you art not with out the hete of
charity / you makes the earth to bring forth fruit / yt is yt all the
instruments both of ye body and soul do bring forth fruit / which fruit
gives life both to him self and to his neighbor / you art all ^ocunde and
merry / for thy face is not troubled by vnpacyence / but you hase a peaseable and
plesau^te syghte in thy self / thou art all clear with a great clerenes / and
strong with a great stre^gthe and abiding with long perseuerau^ce (in somoche)
yt what ye ever you holds or occupyes / you hase heaven opened with the / you art
also a precious Margaryte stone hyd and unknown and cast out of ye world /
in setting naught by thy self / but putty^ge thyselfe by subieccyon under all
reasonable creatures / thy lordeshyp is so great yt there may none pass ye
in domynacyon / for you art gone out of ye deedly bondage of thy proper
seusualyte / which withdraws ye fro thy worshypfull dygnyte / and wha^ yt
this enemy was dystroyed with hate and dysplesau^ce of thy proper co^playntes /
tha^ you had again utterly thy fredome. Here also he speaks of ye mysery of
the^ yt be not obedye^t / and of yt excellent grace of the^ yt be obedye^t. O
Ere daughter all this has my goodness and prouyde^ce done / which has
provided that my only incarnate sone should reform this keye of obedience (as
it is said before) but worldly me^ destytute and barayne fro all virtue do work
ye contrary / for they be as beestes without brydels / i^ asmoche as they have
not ye youke of obedience / and therefore they run fro ill in to worse / and
fro syn^ to syn^e / fro wretchedness to wretchedness / fro derke to derker /
and fro death to death (in somoche) yt at ye last they come to ye pytte of
death / with ye worm of co^scye^ce which shall ever frete the^ / and all be it
yt they may yet other while take upon the^ obedience / yt is to obey to ye
co^mau^dyme^tes of yt law / sorowynge for ye time yt they have lost by
inobedye^ce / yet nevertheless it is full hard to wyn^e it again / for ye
long custom of syn^e and therefore there should none trust in this delayenge
for to take ye keye of obedience in yt last end / though it so be yt every
man owes and should hope as long as he has time and space of life / but yet
he should not trust therein / so yt thereby he delay for to correcke and amend
his life. what is ye cause of so great evil and so great bly^denesse / yt
they know not this blessed treasure? Certain ye cloud of proper love with
wretched pride / by ye which they be gone out of obedyence / and fall in to
inobedye^ce / and as long as they be vnobedyent / so long they be vnpacye^t
(as I have told the before) and with vnpacye^ce / they suffer intolerable
peines / which vnpacyence has draw the^ out fro ye way of truth / so
maky^ge the^ self fellows to fendes / with whom (but if they amend the^) they
go with their own inobedye^ce in to ye endelesse turme^tes / like as my dear
servants / fre^des / kepers / and very obeyers to my law shall loye and be
glad i^ euerlasty^ge bliss / with my only sothfaste sone Ihesu / yt meke and
vndefouled la^be / maker / keeper / and gyuer of ye law / i^ this life all
those yt keep very obedience / they taste peace and receive blessed life / and
they array the^ with ye most parfyte charity / in whom is peace without war / good
without ill / lykernesse without dread / honger wtoute pain / light without derkenes
/ and one sovereign good / of whom all very rasters take part. Who has so
brought to man so great good? Certain ye blood of ye vndefouled la^be / by
whose virtue ye keye of obedyence has lost his rust / yt ye may open ye gate
of heaven with yt same keye thus tha^ obedience by virtue of my sons blood / has
opened to ye the gate of heaven O fools very vnwytty folk / delay no longer
for to come out of the fylthe of uncleanness / for it seems yt ye do as hogs
/ ye which walowe them in fylthe / so it seems yt ye do i^ the fylthe of
carnal delight / forsake your vnryghtwysenesse / ma^slaughter / hate / rancour
/ detraccyon / gronynge / false Judgments / and crueltes / by the which ye
use for to do theft and treachery to your neighbors / with mys ruled pleasures
and delyces of ye world. Cut a way your horns of pride / by the which
cutty^ge away / ye shall dystroye ye hate yt ye have i^ your mouths / against
the^ which do you wrong / mesure ye wrong yt they do to me and to your
neighbors / and than shall ye find in reward of them / that wrongs which
be done to you be naught / ye know well yt if ye abide in hate / ye do me
wrong / in asmoche as ye break my commaundyme^tes / there ye should love me
above all things / and your neighbor as youreselfe / you do wrong to your
neighbor / so depryuynge you fre ye love of charity / for I have given you by
co^mau^dyment / yt ye should love me above all things / and your neighbor
as youreselfe. There was never set nor put other gloss (tha^ as is said)
and if they do you wrong / should ye not therefore love the^? yes certain full
and hole / for yt was bid to you of my only sothfast sone Ihesu which kept
fully ye same / yt ye with the same fullness should keep and do yt same to
your enemies / and if ye keep it not / tha^ ye do harm to yourselfe and
wrong to your soul / depryuynge it fro ye life of grace. Take you therefore
and receive the keye of obedyence with the light of feythe / go ye no more fro
this time forthewarde with such blyndenesse and derkenesse of sin / nor with
such dullness / but with brennynge love keep this obedyence / that with the
true kepers of my law ye may at the last taste very life everlasting Amen.

The second chapyter is of them that set somoche love to obedience / that it
suffyseth not to them for to obey to the general obedyence / as to the
commaundymentes of god / but if they take and be bound to some special
obedyence. Also how a man comes and by what manner fro the general obedyence
to the specyal / and of the excellences of relygyon / and of other matters as be
rehearsed before in the kale^der. Ca. ii.
Right dear daughter there be some / in whom ye fire of love encreseth sore
anendes this obedience / and because the fire of love is not without hate of
proper sensualyte / for by encresynge of that fire / hate encreseth in them /
so that what by hate and what by love they hold the^ not content / only to
live under ye general obedyence of the commau^dy me^tes of the law / to the
which (as it is said before) all ye be bound to keep if ye will have life
ever lasting / but they take upon the^ a more special obedyence / which is a
synguler obedience that governs a soul in great perfeccyon / by the which
they make themself special kepers of the cou^seyles / both actually and
mentually / all such will for hate yt they have to themself slay in them
self their own will / and bind them more straytly in relygyon or else out of
relygyo^ / for to bind the^ to obey to some creature / submyttynge to them
their wylles / that they may thereby more spedefully open the gates of heaven.
These be those of whom I spoke to the before / which have chosen the most
parfyte obedyence. Lo daughter I have told the first of the general
obedyence / and because I know well thy will is that I should tell the
somewhat of the most parfyte and special obedyence / therefore now I shall
tell the of the second / the which is never separate fro the first / but it
is more parfyte (for as I have told the) they be so coupled and knitte together
/ that they may not be departed. Also I told the fro whense yt obedience came
/ and where it is found / and what thing it is that wihdraweth it fro you /
therefore now I shall tell the of the special obedience / not for to withdraw
the fro the first. Now a man comes and by what manner fro the general
obedyence to the special / and of the excellence of relygyon. A Soul that
with love receives the youke of obedyence of yt co^mau^dyme^tes of my only
sothefast sone Ihesu / suy^ge his doctrine and excercysynge himself i^ such
wise (as I have told the virtuously in this general obedience) he shall come
to the second obedeynce with the same light as he came to the first / for with
light of holy feythe he knew my sothefast truth / and my meruaylous love
which I have to the freylte of ma^ky^de / in ye blood of my meke lamb / and
because such a soul can not vertuousli answer to me i^ such parfeccyon as
he should / therefore he sees with the same light in what place and i^ what
wise he might yield to me my dewte / and overcome his ownefreylte / and also
sle his own will i^ this co^syderynge / he fyndeth with light of feythe a place
(yt is holy relygyon) which is made and set of the holy ghost / as a ship for
to receive souls / willing for to run to parfeccyon / the^ for to lead and
bring to ye haven of health. The patron of this ship is ye holy ghost /
which never sayleth in himself / for no defantes of any manner relygyous
subject yt trespaseth in relygyon / what that ever he be that trespaseth in
relygyo^ / he offends in the ship of relygyon / but he may not offend ye
relygyon in it self / but he offends and hurts himself. Nevertheless yet
it happeth so yt for the defaute of him yt trespaseth in ye ship / by mys
governance of holdy^ge of ye stern / oftetyme the ship sto^deth in great
perell / and is in point for to be drenched / these be wretched and wicked
gouernoures / and prelaces set in governance of relygyon / by the patron of
this ship of relygyon. This ship of relygyon is of such excellence in it
self / that thy tongue is vnsuffycyent for to tell it / (and therefore as I
said) such a soul after the fire of desire / is increased in her with holy
hate of herself / wha^ she has found a place of relygyon with the light of
feythe / as all deed and mortyfyed to ye world / she enters in to the same /
if she be a very obedyent soul / that is if she have before kept parsytely
the general obedynece of the commau^dyme^tes / and yet though she enter
vnparfytely (that is yt she kept not parfytely the commau^dymentes) she may
if she will excercyse herself in virtue of obedyence / and attain and come to
the parfeccyon of relygyon / all be it that yet for the more party which enter
in to relygyon be vnparfyte / for some enter with parfeccyon / some for dread /
some in chyldeheed / some for pain / and some by fair speech and glosynge /
all such may be good and holy / if such will deuoutely excercyse themself in
virtue / and contynu to the last end of death / for only as touching the
enter may no man deem / but in ye parseuerau^ce and abydy^ge therein / for many
enter as it seems parfytely / which afterward would feign turn again to ye
world / or else with much vnparfeccyon they live and stand in relygyon / and
therefore the manner and the deed by which a soul enters in to this ship of
relygyon / which manners be all ordained of me / cally^ge souls to relygyo^ /
it should not be demed / but only the affection of such a soul that abides
in ye same relygyon with very parseuerau^ce. This ship of relygyon is rich /
and therefore it needs not to a subject not for to thing of his need ghostly
nor bodyly / for if he yt enters by very obedience and a true keeper of his
relygyo^ / it shall be proved for hy^ by his patron / yt is ye holy ghost /
oreles as you knows well I told the when I spoke to the of my prouyde^ce
(where I said thus) yt my servants though they be poor / they be not
therefore beggars. In ye same wise all such as be entered in to relygyon / if
they be very obedyent / they shall have yt they need. Of this they yt be very
kepers of their orders / have this in experye^ce / and preue it day by day.
In old time also when that orders of relygyon were governed by the flower of
virtue / yt is with very pouerte and frat^rnall charity / te^porall substance
failed them never / but yt they had ever enough (as need required) and the
more that they had of temporal substance / ye more nedy they were. Therefore
it is right reasonable yt they be pryued to ye vtterest / what fruit they have
by inobedye^ce / for if they were very obedyent kepy^ge the vow of pouerte /
they would never be proprytaryes nor live partyculerly / but in comune. In such
poor comune living they fy^de riches of holy ordinance / set and ordained with
great dyscrecyo^ and great light of such yt were i^ earth / ye temple of ye
holy ghost. Behold and se saint Benet / with what dyscrecyon he ordained his
ship of relygyon / be hold also saint Frauncys with what parfeccyo^ and pouerte
/ and with how many precious Margaryte stones of virtue / he ordained ye ship of
his order / ledynge the^ yt be entered therein unto the way of high parfeccyon
/ and he himself was the first that kept the same rule / gyuynge to the^ that
enter to the same relygyon / very and holy pouerte for their spouse / ye which
pouerte he took also for his own spouse with his suster vylyte / and setting
right naught by him self / but he virtuously myslyket himself / and he
desired never with out my will for to please any manner creature / but rather he
desired to be set little by in the world / ever turme^tynge and punyshy^ge
his body / and also sleynge his own proper will / araye^ge himself with
repreues / peynes / and shames / for yt love of my sone that meke and
vndefouled lamb Ihesu christ / with whom he was fastened and nailed upon ye cross
by affeccyo^ of love (so ferforth) that by special and synguler grace in his
body apered the wounds of my only sothefast sone Ihesu christ crucyfyed / and
so was showed in the vessel of the body / the which was in affection of the
soul. Thus he made away himself to his subjects / but now you will ask me
and say / whyther all other relygyous be founded and set in yt same parfeccyo^
(I say yes) but in every order this virtue of pouerte is not pryncypall /
though it so be yt al virtues be grounded in ye same virtue / of virtues it
fares thus / yt all they take life of ye virtue of charity / and yet
nevertheless (as I have told ye i^ other places before) to some one virtue is
special / and to some another / and yet all they dwell in charity. In ye same
wise very proper pouerte was with this poor Frau^cys as a pryncypall virtue /
setting ye begy^nynge of his relygyous ship / pryncypally by his affection of
love in ye virtue of pouerte / and so making a strayte order / for all parfyte
people and not for comune people / but for few and good (I say few) for
there be not many yt chosen this pouerte i^ ye same order / and therefore their
defautes be multyplyed ymo^ge ye people / and so they fail of virtue. This is
no defaute of ye ship / but it is for defaute of vnobedyent subjects and mys
ruled gouernoures. Also if thou behold now the ship of thy fader saint
Domynycke my blessed child / you shall se how he sets a parfyte order / and
he would that subjects which enter in to ye ship / should only take heed to
my worship and health of souls / with the light of cu^ny^ge / and upon ye light
/ he made ye pryncypall begy^nynge of his relygyon / yet it was depryued fro yt
very wylful pouerte / but he had it / and in toke^ yt he had it / ye contrary
thereof dysplesed hy^ somoch / yt he left to his children in ye same relygyon
by his testament for their heritage his curs and mine / if they ever should be
of will to have or keep any manner of possescyons / in special or in general.
This was a very token that he chose to his spouse ye queen of pouerte / but for
his pryncypall virtue that he set his relygyon upon / was ye light of
cunning / which he took myghtely upon him self / for to dystroye erroures
and here syes / which reigned in those days / he took upon ye office of my
sone / so that in ye world he was worthyly called a postell / because with
right great truth he showed my word / putting away derkesse and gyuy^ge
light / he was one light that shyned i^ ye derke world / which light I
gave to the world by mean and medyacyon of Mary my sons worthy mother / that
was send to the mysteryall body of holy church / as a dystroyer of heresies /
for she gave hy^ his abyte / wha^ ye office of prechynge was committed to him
by my sone. Why said I by mean and medyacyon of the most blessed Mary? For
she prayed that the heresies might be dystryed in holy church / wherefore I
chose Domynycke for to labor there upon with light of cunning / of the which
light of cunning / he made his children in the same relygyon to ete upon ye
table of ye cross / upon ye which cross was set ymonges them the table of
holy desire / where souls do ete for my honor and worship / he would not yt
his children should take heed to any other belynesse / tha^ only for to stand
upon this table with the light of cunning / for to seek ye glory and laud of
my name / and health of souls / that they should have no matter for to beletted
in other things / he did withdraw fro the^ the business of te^porall goods
/ whom he would were poor / he doubted never for no lyuelod for the^ / nor he
never dredde yt / for he had myghtyly arrayed hy^ in very feythe and in stydfast
hop / and so hoped in my prouyde^ce / he would also yt they should keep
obedyence / and yt they be obedyent for to do yt thing to ye which they be
chosen / and also because that by unclean lyuy^ge the eye of intelleccyon is
blinded (and not only the intelleccyon) but by yt wretched vice ye bodyly
syghte fails / wherefore he will not yt thereby their light were let / with ye
which light they win the light of cu^nynge ye better and more perfytely /
therefore he put to the^ the third vow / that is of contynence / and ymonge
all his children he would it were kept with very perfyte obedyence (though it
be these days evil kept) for now they paruerte the light of cu^nynge in to
derkenesse / with ye blyndenesse of pride (not for this light of cunning may
receive derkenesse) but I say this as for the derkenesse of their souls / for
where that pride is / there may no obedyence be (for as I told ye lately) a
very obedyencer is asmoche in meekness / as he is in obedience / and asmoche
in obedyence / as he is meekness / therefore he that breketh the vow of
obedience / seldon it is seen but yt he breketh the vow of contynence / other
mentually or actually / and thus you may know and se well that he has
ordained for to bind his relygyous ship with these three cords / that is with
obedyence / contynence / and very pouerte / it is made all ryally / for all
deedly sin may be eschewed therein / he was so yllumyned of me with very
light and prouydence / that he provided to them which were of less
parfeccyon than other / as well as he did for them that were parfyte in the
same relygyo^ / for though all that do keep this order be parfyte / yet in yt
way of living there may be one more parfyte than another / and so he provided
therefore / that both parfyte and vnparfyte may dwell all together in this
relygyous ship / he fastened himself myghtyly to my only sothefaste sone Ihesu
/ showing his doctrine / and yt he showed well in that he would not ye death
of the sinners / but that they were gracyously turned and so to live / he was
virtuously all large / all merry and full of iocundyte / and all sweet in virtue
as a delectable vyrydary / but wretches such as keep not the order but brekers
of the same / they make foul and enfecte other which be noryshed in the same
relygyon at ye breast of virtue with the little light of cunning that they
have / I say not of ye order i^ it self (for as I said) it has ghostly
deleccacyo^ i^ it self / but i^ ye begy^ny^ge I said there was none such
infeccyo^ ymo^ge the^ / for tha^ all as one flower well smelly^ge / in yt time
men were of so great parfeccyon that there was no derkenesse of error nor
heresies / but yt it was with the light of cunning of the^ put away. Se and
behold saint Thomas Alquyn / which with the light of his intelleccyo^ /
worthyly he beheld in the myrrour of my truth where he wanne light above
nature / and cu^ny^ge infuded by grace / for both by prayer and man's study
he wanne such cunning. He was as a brennynge light / yt gave light in his
order / and quenched derkenes in the mysteryal body of holy church. Behold
also saint Peter of Mylan yt vyrgyn and martyr / which with shedynge of his
blood by martyrdom / gave light in destroyenge of many heresies / which
heresies he had in so great hare / that he dysposed himself for to dye /
rather tha^ to suffer them / and all the while he lived in earth / he dysposed
hy^ to none other thing / tha^ for to excercyse hy^ in prayer / prechynge and
dysputynge with heretykes / showing the truth / and spredynge the feythe over
all with out any dread / and yt not oneli he would knowledge it by his life /
but unto yt death (so ferforthe) that i^ the end of his death / wha^ his
tongue failed hy^ in receyuy^ge of the stroke / he wette his finger i^ his
blood / and because he lacked a charter to write upon / he put his finger to
the earth and wrote / knowlegynge his feythe and believe in this wise. O redo in
deum. etc. His heart brenned in the depenes of my charity / and therefore in his
passion he turned not his heed abacke / knowing well that he should dye / for
or than he dyed / I showed hy^ by reuelacyo^ his manner of death / where fore as
a very knight without any seruyle dread / he stood in the field of battle.
And thus of many I may tell the that though they did suffer no martyrdom
actually / yet they did suffer martyrdom mentually / as saint Domynycke and
other such. Here now what tyllers I have send in to my vyneyerde / for to
pull up thorns of vices / and for to pla^te virtues. Certain Domynycke and
Frauncys were two pyllers in holy church / Frau^cys with his pouerte / which
was given him pry^cypally as his own proper virtue / as it is before rehearsed.
Of the excellence of them that be under obedyence and be obedyent / of the
mysery of them which be vnobedyent that be in the state of relygyon. Sythen it
so is that the places of relygyon be now yfounde (that is to say) ships
ordained by the holy ghost to carry souls to heaven / by medyacyon of ye blessed
patron ye holy ghost founded with the parfyte light of holy feythe. Now
therefore I shall tell the both of the obedyence and of the inobedyence of them
that have enhabyted or made to them a dwelling place in this ship of
relygyon (and not only of one order) but of all together in general (that is
to say) no more speaking of one order than of all other orders / and in the
same I shall tell the together both of the defautes of them which live
obedyently / and also the defautes of them that dolyue uncleanly and
vnobedyently / that thou may have ye more parfeccyo^ / and more swetely / and
the better to know that one fro that other / and also I shall tell the how he
shall go / that goes for to enter yt relygyous ship of ony^ manner of order.
How should a man go yt will enter a partyculer relygyon? Certain with light of
holy feythe / by the which light / he shall know ye needs he must slay his
own will with the sword of holy hate / of every proper sencyble passion / and
so should he enter to relygyon / and be coupled to the spouse of very obedience
/ with her suster pacye^ce / and with yt norse of mekenes / for if he have not
this norse / obedyence shall peryshe for honger / for in that soul where this
virtue of meekness is not / obedyence dies anon / and meekness is not alone
/ but she has a servant that is vylyte and co^tempte both of ye world and
of herself / which makes a man to set little by himself / and not for to
desire honors and worshyppes / but repreues and shames. Thus should a man go
deed to ye relygyous ship of any order / and therein to live mekely / but in
what manner wise that he enters / that is by diverse manners as I call the^ (like
as I have told ye before) they should search anon the parfeccyon of the same
order / and keep it each in themself / and quyckely receive the keye of
obedience of the same order / which keye opens the wyket / that is the
great gate of heaven. Lo by this you may know that there is both a gate and a
wyket of heaven / and therefore all those that gone to some partyculer relygyon /
they take the keye of obedyence / which shall open the wyket of the gate / not
leuynge the great keye of general obedyence / which opens ye great gate
of heaven / as I have told the. In this gate is a wyket / of ye which wyket
they have received a subtle keye / for to open ye same low wyket / there
throw straytely for to pass / which wyket is not departed fro ye great gate
/ but it is in the gate / as you may se materyally a wyket in a gate / and
though they have received this little keye of the strayte wyket of heaven / yet
should they not cast away fro them the great keye / and because very
obedyencers kowe well with ye light of feythe / that they may in no wise enter
by this little wyket of streyte obedience with burthons of riches / nor with
their own will / nor yt they may in no wise enter there going vpryght / but
if they stoop lest they break their heedes / therefore they cast away fro the^
riches and also their own wylles / keeping ye vow of wylfull pouerte / and
they will i^ no wise receive nor keep any thing in possescyo^ (as their own)
lest they break the vow of wylfull pouerte promytted / and so to break their
obedience. All such as gone vpryght in relygyon / wenynge so to enter that
wyked / be all proud obedyencers / kepy^ge their own will / for other while
when they must needs obey / they bow not to ye obedyence mekely / but with
pride they fulfill their obedience / bowy^ge down their heedes by strength
and not by meekness / which stre^gthe breketh the heedes of their soueraynes
(yt is) yt obedyence done in such wise yt it pleases not their soueraynes /
i^ gyuynge of evil ensample to their subjects that would obey mekely / after
the which proud obedyence / oftetymes they fall in brekynge of the vow of
chastyte and in contyne^ce / for he yt has not his appetyte well ruled and
ordynately / nor has not yet dysposed himself fro temporal substance / he
takes upon him for to know many new conuersacyo^s of men and women / and
fyndeth many friends whom he loves and uses with his own proper will / by
the which knowledge of conuersacyon / they become right special friends / and
so together they do noryshe their bodyly conuersacyons in delyces / because they
have not the norse of meekness / nor her servants vylyte and abieccyon of
themself / wherefore all they sto^de in plesau^ce of their own sensualyte
living delycately (not as relygyous folk) but as lords without watch and
prayer / and all this and many mo it happeth them that have proper goods in
keeping for to spend (which if they had not) it should not so fall with the^
as it does / and also they fall in uncleanness other bodyly or mentally / and if
it hap other while yt for shame they abstain them bodyly fro uncleanness /
yet they abstain the^ not me^tally / for it is impossible to him that has
much conuersacyon of flesshly men / and in delyces of ye body in receyuynge of
meet and dry^ke vnordynately / and also lives with out devotion / waking /
and prayenge / for to keep his soul clean / and therefore a very meke
obedyencer sees al a fer with the light of feythe / the evil and harm that
should fall to him / by kepy^ge of any temporal substance in proper / and so
for to go with his own will / and he sees well also yt he must needs by his
order pass throw his little wyket with ye keye of obedyence / which shall
open that wyket. Why trowes thou that I have said the that in any wise they
must needs go throw that little wyket? Certain for I say sothe / for will he
or not / if he abide in the order / he must needs go throw that wyket / by
the hardenes of obedience of his prelate / and therefore a parfyte obedyencer
lyfteth himself above himself / and has the domynacyon of his own proper
se^sualyte / reysynge himself above all his bodyly felynges and styrrynges /
and with quycke feythe he sends in to the house of ye soul holy hate / for
to put out the enemy of his own proper love / for he will not that his spouse
of obedyence / which was given to him by the mother of charity / be offended /
and therefore he puts out the enemy of his own will / and sends in the
fellow and the norse of ye same spouse meekness / and many other lovers of ye
same spouse / which be very ryall virtues / manners / customs / and
obseruaunces of the order / for to make ready anendes the enter of the spouse of
obedyence / and so tha^ enters this sweet spouse obedyence in to ye soul with
her suster pacyence / and with the norse meekness well kept and warded with her
servants vylyte and abieccyon / and also dyspleasau^ce of herself / and
after time she is thus entered / she is all in peace and quietness / stondynge
in the orcharde of very co^tyne^ce / with ye clear son of intelleccyo^ / where
ye light of feythe shows her clearly / ye clear sight of my sothefastnesse /
there is also fire which warmeth and gives here to them all / yt keep ye
obseruau^ces of ye order purely for the love of me. What be these enemies
which be put out? The first pryncypall enemy is proper love / ye enemy of
charity and mekenes / ye which bry^geth forth pride / another is inobedyence
/ against very obedience / the third is infydelyte^ / contrary agay^st ye
virtue of feythe and also presumpcyo^ / for to presume and hope in himself /
which acordeth not with very holy hope / ye which a soul should have. Also
vnpacyence which is against pacyence / vnryghtwysenesse which co^formeth hy^
not to ye virtue of ryghtwysenes / nor imprude^ce with prudece / nor vnteporau^ce
with te^poraunce / nor crasgreliyo^ of ye brekynge of ye commandyme^tes of the
order / with obseruau^ce of ye order / nor evil co^uersacyo^ of wicked lyuers /
with ye co^uersacyo^s of good lyuers / all these be enemies and right cruel
enemies / ymo^ge whom is found ye capytall enemy of ire against benyuole^ce
/ and cruelte against love of virtue / uncleanness against purete / neclyge^ce
against besynes / ygynorau^ce against cu^nynge / and sompnole^ce against
waking and co^tynual prayer / and because yt a true obedyencer knows well
with the light of feythe yt all these be enemies / which make foul ye spouse of
holy obedience / therefore he send i^ holy hate to put the^ out / and also love
to take in his fre^des / which be virtues / where holy hate with his sword of
dred did slay wicked proper will / which will was and is noryshed of proper
love yt gave life to all these enemies of very obedyence / and when he had
smyten of ye heed of this pryncypall enemy / by whom al were kept in / tha^
this spouse obedience is fre and in peace without any war / she has tha^ no
enemy wtin yt may dysplease her nor hurt her / for he is put out / which was
cause of her bytternesse and sorrow. What war trowes you yt a very obedye^cer
has / whyther wro^ges show to his wars? Nay. why? Certain for very
obedience is pacye^t / which pacye^ce is suster of obedience. Be ye
obseruaunces of ye order contrary to her? Nay. why? Certain for obedience will
keep them all purely. Is it any pain to her ye precepts and strayte
co^mau^dyme^tes of prelates and soueraynes? Nay. why? Certain for very
obedyence has overcome her own will / and will not make questyo^s of her
soueraynes will / nor deem her what yt ever she byddeth / but with ye light of
feythe she demeth my will in her sovereign / thy^ky^ge verily yt my myldenes
makes hy^ to bide so (as it is necessary for ye health of her soul) / it is
never shame to such for to do the most vile abiecte thing in the order /
another in sufferynge of derysyons / repreues / detraccyons / and dyspysynges /
which oftetymes be done and said / but ever they would be take as vile and
abiecte in ye syghte of man / and yt is for they have conceived alone in vylyte
/ abieccyo^ / and dyspleasau^ce of themself with parfyte hate / and so they joy
with the spouse of very obedience / and with her suster pacye^ce / he yt is thus
obedye^t is never sorry / but for offense which is done to me yt am his maker /
for his co^uersacyo^ is with such yt verily and lovely dread me / and though
other while such one have co^uersacyo^ with the^ yt be deperted fro my will /
they do not yt for to conform themself to their defautes / but for to wtdrawe
the^ fro their wicked lives / for ye good which they have in themself with
fraternall charity / they will depart it with other / co^sydery^ge well yt it
were to my name more worship and honor to have mant ymo^ge the^ yt might keep
ye obseruau^ces of ye order (tha^ only they kept it the^selte) and therefore
they enforce themself for ta call seculers to relygyo^ / both by words and
prayers / and in ye most honest wise they can / they besy the^ for to pull
the^ out fro ye derkenesse of deedly sins. Thus tha^ you may well know / yt
ye co^uersacyo^s of a very obedye^cer be good and perfyte (whyther they be
conuersau^te with good or with bad) for they be set in an ordynate affection / and
in ye bread and latytude of charity. Of his Cell he makes hy^ an heaven /
having delight there for to speak and have co^uersacyo^ with me by affection of
love / he flees idleness by co^tynuall prayer and meekness / and when
thoughts abounden to him by illusyon of the fend / in his Cel he lays him
not down anon in ye bed of of neclygence so being ydell / nor he will not by
reason make inquysycyo^ of the thoughts of his heart / nor his own conceyte /
but he flees idleness / lyftynge himself above himself with holy hate upon
his sencyble feeling / and with very mekenes and pacyence to bear and suffer
labors / and so he wtstondeth such thoughts / as he feleth in his soul with
waky^ge and meke prayers / he waketh in me with his eye of intelleccyo^ /
beholdy^ge and seeing with the light of feythe yt I am his helper / and yt I may
/ can / and will help hy^ / to whom I open my arms of benygnyte / and suffer
such things for to fall to hy^ / for to make hy^ ye more besy for to fle fro
himself / and to come to me / to who^ I beny^gely open my arms / and if such
one seem ye me^tall prayer comforts hy^ not / for ye great labor yt he
suffers i^ such resyste^ce / he breketh out with vocal prayer / other he
uses some bodyly excercyse / yt so both with vocal prayer and bodyly excercyse
/ he might put away ydlenes / also he beholds in me with ye light of feyth /
yt suffer hy^ to be tempted with such te^ptacyo^ of thoughts for love yt I have
to him / waiting how myghtili he would wtsto^de the^. Than he puts out his
heed of mekenes / yrectynge himself unworthy rest of soul (as other worthy
servants of mine be worthy) but he holds himself worthy pain / such one
sets naught by hy^ self / but with holy hate he rebukes himself / him
seems that he may not do himself pain enough / but yet blessed hope of my
prouyde^ce fails him not / and therefore he so passes out of this trouble with
quycke feyte and with ye keye of obedience in his ho^de in to ye relygyous ship
of ye order / and so he is bycome a keeper of his Cell / fleing idleness (as I
have said) a very obedye^cer will be yt first yt shall enter ye quere / and ye
last yt shall go out / and when he sees one of his brederne or sustren more
besy in bodyly or ghostly business tha^ he is / he waxes holy enuyously / and
takes himself yt virtue to hy^ by pryue ghostly stelthe / not will lynge ye yt
virtue be lessed in his brother / for if he would so / he were not in fraternall
charity. A very obedye^cer forsakes not ye fraytur / but oftetymes and many
times he vysyteth it / and delyteth therm to ete poorly his meet / and in
token yt he has no delight for to be out of the fraytur / he has avoided fro
hy^ all temporal substance / perfytely kepy^ge ye vow of pouerte (and so
perfytely) ye he has need of ye bod^ / and yet keeps wylfull^ ye same ^^de with
great disease / his Cell is full of ye odor of pouerte / and not full of clothes
/ he thy^keth nothing yt thieves should come and stele his clothes / nor ye yt
moughte nor duste should ete nor waste his clothes / and if any thing be given
hy^ or delivered him / he thinks not for to hyde it / but make it freli
comune with his brederne / he thy^keth not on ye morrow / but his necessyte he
takes daily / thinking no more but on ye kyngedome of heaven / and on very
obedience / how he might best keep it / and because it is best kept by
mekenes / he submytteth him asmoche to ye leest child as he would to ye
gretest man yt is / and to ye poor as he would to yt rich / he makes him
servant to all / never refusing labor / but he does service mekely to every
creature. A very obedyencer will not make obedience after his own manner / nor
chose another time nor place / but as his sovereign will and as yt manner of ye
order will / all this a very obedye^cer does without pain or tedyosyte of soul
/ such one passes lyghtli by ye hard wyket of ye or der / with ye keye of
obedience i^ his ho^de without any vyole^ce / by cause he has kept and keeps
ye vow of chastity / of very obedience and pure contynece / auoydy^ge ye
hyghnes of pride / and bow ynge ye heed of obedyent meekness / wherefore he
may in no wise break his heed by vnpacye^ce / for he is very peaseable with
ghostly stre^gthe and perseuerau^te pasye^ce / which be ye friends of
obedience / such one is in will never to offe^de / by styrrynge of the fend /
his flesh / nor ye world / for he chastyseth his flesh by mortyfycacyo^ /
spolynge hy^ fro delectacyo^s / and arayeth him with labors and trauayles of yt
order with quycke feythe and without dedygnacyo^ (as a child which forgeteth the
rebuke yt his fader gives hy^) in yt same wise this child another thinks in
his soul of wro^ges done to him / nor of labors nor greues which be done to
him in ye order and given of his sovereign / but wha^ he is called of him he
goes to hy^ / nothing moved with ire and rancoure / but with all manner of
meekness and benyuolence. These be the children of whom my sothefast sone
Ihesu spoke of / wha^ his dyscyples did strive together / which of them should
be ymo^ges the^ ye most / where he made a child to come to him and said thus.
Suffer children come to me / for of such is yt kyngedome of heaven / and he yt
loweth him not as mekely as this child (that is) if he have not his co^dycyo^
/ he may not enter in to ye kyngedome of heaven. For dear daughter he yt loves
hy^ shall be enhau^sed / as my only sothfast sone says in ye gospel / and as
it is often found i^ other books of holy seyntes / therefore these children
ryghtwysely may be called meke / yt for love make themself low and subjects
with very holy obedience / not stryuy^ge another against their order nor against
their prelates / all such shall be enhau^sed ane^des me endeles fader / and
dwell with my very cytesyns i^ endelesse bliss / where they shall be worthily
rewarded for all their labor / and for to be syker of yt / I make the^ in this
life for to taste some what of the endeles blys for their ernest. How they yt be
very obedyent receive an hundredth for one / and euerlasty^ge life / and what is
understood by yt one / and what by yt hundredth. IN such dear daughter is
fulfilled yt thing which my only sone said to Peter when he said thus.
Master low have for sake al thing and follow the / what shall we have
therefore. My sone said / ye shall receive an hundredth and euerlasty^ge life /
as and my sone should say thus. Peter ye have do well / for in none other wise
ye might follow me / but in forsakynge of al thy^ ges / therefore I shall give
ye in this life an.C. And what is this. C? dear daughter after ye which /
endelesse life follows. Of what thing under sto^deth my sone this / of
te^porall substance? Nay. not properly / if otherwhyle by doing of alms
deeds I multyply temporal goods / but of what thing tha^? Certain of him ye
gives his proper will / for ye will of man is but one / and for yt one I give
hy^ an.C. i^ this life. Why is this no^bre of an.C. set? Certain for an.C. is
a perfyte no^bre / and to yt may no more be added to / but if you begyn^e at
one / in ye same wise charity is ye most parfyte virtue above all other virtues
/ for a more perfyte virtue may never a man asce^de to / nevertheless you
receyues well all other virtues / when you encreces the^ in merytes to this.C.
ye virtue of charity / but yet you comes perfytely to this.C. by multyplye^ge of
other virtues / in knowledge of thyselfe / this is yt.C. which is given to the^
/ yt have given their wylles alone / in general / pertyculer / and special
obedience / and with this.C. they shall receive ever lasting life / for charity
alone is ye lady which enters i^ / ledy^ge with her the fruit of all other
virtues / and they abide within me endeles life / i^ whom they taste endeles
life / for I am yt endelesse life / to whom they come / for they be i^ mi
possescio^ / who^ they hoped before to have (and so all other virtues) charity
alone as a queen enters and has me / ye has her. Thus these little
children receive an.C. and ever lasting life i^ hy^ / here ye receive the
fruit of dyuyne charity / set for the nombre of an hundredth (as it is said)
and because they have received of me this hundredth / they abide and dwell in
themself with a meruaylous hertely joy / for i^ pure charity falls never
sorrow / but ever holy gladness / they that have this charity / have a large
heart and lyberall / and not double and strayte / for a soul that is wounded
with this sweet darte of love / shows not one in the face / another in the
tongue / and another in the heart / such one serves not feyntly and
mynystreth to her neighbor with bolny^ge bryde for her charity is open to all
creatures largely without fenynge / and there fore a soul that has and is had
of charity / falls never in pain nor sorrow which turmenteth / nor it
delayeth never for to obey redyly / but ever it is obedye^t unto ye death.

The third chapyter is of the paruersytes / myseryes / and labors of the^
which be not obedyent / and of the miserable fruytes that come of vnobedyence
/ of the imparfeccyo^ of them that be slow or unlusty in relygyo^ / all be it
they keep them fro deedly sin / and of ye remedy how they should come out of
that vnlustynes / and of other matters / as be rehearsed to you in the kalder
before. Ca. iii.
A Wretched vnobedyencer does the contrary of all this / which sto^deth in ye
relygyous ship of order / with right great pain (both of himself and of
other) that he tastes in this life the ernest and the sykernesse of hell / he
ever is in sorrow / co^fusyon / and pryckynge of conscience and is dyspleased
with his order and also with his sovereign / such one is intolerable to
himself / lo daughter such one has take the keye of obedyence in relygyon /
and lives vnobedye^tly / for inobedye^ce is made a lady assocyate with
vnpacyence / and noryshed with pride and proper co^place^s of herself / which
pride comes out of proper love (as it is said before) he does all ye
contrary against very obedyence / how may such a wretch stand without
pain / that is depryued fro charity / he should myghtely bow down his heed
of proper will / and pride holds it up right / all his will does dysacorde
to the will of the order / ye order will that he should live under very
obedyence / and he follows and loves inobedyence / the order will that he
should live with wylfull pouerte / and he flees it and desires riches and
gadereth it / the order will that he live in purete and clennesse / and he
lives i^ uncleanness. My dear daughter when that a relygyous man breketh these
three vows / he falls in to so many defautes / ye his lokynge seems nothing
after a relygyous man / but after an incarnate devil (as I have more largely
told ye before in another place) and yet shall I not lene therefore / but that
somewhat I shall tell the of their destynable living / and of the fruit yt they
win by vnobedyence / to the more co^me^dacyon of very obedience. Such a
wretch is dysceyued of his own proper love / for ye eye of his intelleccyon
is set with deed feythe in to ye co^placens of his own proper sensualyte and in
worldely things / he is lope with his heart in to ye world / and therein he
dwells by affection (though his body be in relygyon) and because obedience
is laborous to hy^ / he will not obey / but eschew labor / and so he falls
in more myscheuous labor / for needs he must obey / other by co^straynynge or
by love / it were better for him and less labor for to fulfill his labor with
love than without love. O howmoche such one is dysceyued / and there is none yt
so dysceyueth him as himself / for in that he will please himself / he
dyspleaseth himself / in asmoche as ye works which he does enjoined to hy^
by obedyence / be dyspleasynge and mys liking to him / he would live in great
delight and so win endelesse bliss in this life / and his order will that he
be a pilgrim (not for to trust in no abydy^ge i^ this world) and in token
here of / wha^ yt he purposes hy^ for to dwell in one place of ye order / there
as it lyketh him best for to dwell / and where he might find more delight to
his bodyly plesau^ce / by the order he is removed in to another place. In such
remouynge and chau^gy^ge fro one place to another such one fy^deth great pain.
Why is yt? Certain for his own proper will is quycke for to will there he
should not will / nor none otherwise than ye order and the soueraynes will /
and if such one obey not after ye order and ye soueraynes will / he shall be
coacted by dyscyplyne and dures of ye order / and so he dwells (as I said) in
co^tynuall turment and pain / sees you not now how such dysceyue the^ self /
for there as he weneth to flee peynes / he falls in to peynes / his
blyndenesse will not suffer him to know ye way of very obedyence / ye which
is away of sothefastnesse and truth / grounded in my very obedye^t la^be my
sone Ihesu christ. Therefore thus bly^dely he goes by ye way of untruth and
mys liking / weny^ge for to find delight there / and he fyndeth there pain and
bytternes. Who has brought him thereto? Love which he has not for to obey /
and yt is his own^ passion / such one works as a fool / for he will swymme
with his own arms i^ this perylous see / which is full of te^pestes and waves
/ crusty^ge in his own wretched lyuy^ge / and he will i^ no wise swymme with yt
arms of yt order and of his sovereign / he dwells thus soly with his body i^
ye relygyous ship of ye order (but not with his soul) for he is gone out thereof
by desire / not kepy^ge ye statutes / nor ye manner of ye order / nor the three
howes taken by his psessyo^ / he dwells rather in ye te^pestyous see there to
be drenched / tha^ in ye swetenes of relygyo^ / he is rather bound i^ relygyo^
by abyte of his body / tha^ by ye abyte of his soul / such one is no
relygyous man / but rather a beestly man arrayed in ye habyte of relygyo^ / and
yet in his affeccyo^ and in his lyuy^ge he is worse tha^ a be / he sees not
yt it is more labor for hy^ to swy^me rather with his own arms / tha^ with ye
arms of his sovereign / he sees not also yt he sto^deth in myscheuous perell
of endelesse death. Why is that? Certane for the cloud of his own proper love
/ of whom came to him his inobedyence yt has stopped his clear sight / that
it suffers him not for to se his o^ne harms / therefore he is wretchedly
dysceyued. What fruit brings forth the tree of such a miserable wretch?
The fruit of death / for he has set and planted the root of death in ye
pride of his affection / which he drew out of his own proper love and
plesaunce of himself / and therefore all ye fruit and flowers that come out
fro thense be all corrupt / and also yt leaves and ye branches of ye same tree
be spotted and defouled. Three branches yt this tree has be corrupt and
defouled / that is the branch of obedience / of pouerte / and of contyne^ce /
which be those three branches that be contained in the stock of affection /
which is evil planted and set / as I have said before. The leaves that this
tree brings forth (ye be words) be also corrupt / that ye most seculer
rybaude yt lives would not say as they sayen / and if it so hap yt he must
preche and show my word to ye people / he shows it with much curyosyte / not
ryghtfully as he should only for to feed and win souls / but only to speak
with gaye words of po^pe / and if you behold the flowers of this tree (which be
diverse thoughts) such as be received with great delectacyo^ and lust / they
give a stynkynge smell / for they fle not ye places and ways which bring
them in to such corrupt thoughts / but they search after such occasyons /
yt they might come to ye fulfyllynge of the sin. This is ye fruit ye sleeth
hy^ and bynemeth him life of grace / and gives him endelesse death. But what
stynke casts out this fruit brought forth with the flower of the tree?
Certain it casts out sty^ke of inobedye^ce / by ye which he will with the
thought of his heart inquire and deem in evil ye will of his sovereign / he
casts out also uncleanness with many wicked conuersacyons / de lytynge himself
wretchedly with his name of a devout man. O wretch thou co^syders not that under
color of thy devotion shall follow to the many myscheues / as children of
inobedyence / for thou hase not received nor take to the children of virtue / as
a very obedye^cer does / such one sercheth for to dysceyue his sovereign /
using to him leaves of state ring words / speaking irreverently and with
great repreuynge / such one supporteth not his brother / nor he may not the
leest word say anendes him when he is vndernymed for his defautes / but anon
he casts out venomous fruit of vnpacyence and Ire and hate against his
brother / demynge in evil / ye he did to him for good / and thus such a soul
so sclau^dred lives i^ pain both wtin and without. Why is such one dyspleased
with his brother? Certain for he dyspleaseth himself sencybly / such one flees
his Cell / as he would fle veny^ (and ye cause is) for he is gone out of his
own proper Cell of knowledge / whereby he is fall in to inobedyence / and
therefore he may not abide in his materyall Cell / he will not also come to ye
fraytur / but as he would go to his enemy / as long as he has any thing to
spe^de / and wha^ he has no more / tha^ need dryueth him thither. Therefore
true obedye^cers done well which keep so well ye vow of pouerte / yt they will
nothy^ge have for to spe^de / because they would ever be fed at ye sweet table
of ye fraytur / where a very obedyencer norysheth both his body and soul in
peace and quyetnes / he will never thy^ke nor make ordinance for sweter not
better live lode tha^ he fyndeth there. The contrary does an inobedye^cer / he
will be ye last comy^ge i^ to ye quere / and the first yt shall go out / with
his lyppes he draws nygh to me / but his heart is fer fro me / he flees also
for dread of penance yt chapyter. What is cause of all this? Certain
inobedyence / such one also never waketh nor prays / and yet often times when
he should say his dyuyne service / to ye which he is bound / and it is
vnsayde / he has no fraternall charity wtin hy^ / for he loves none but
himself / and yet not with reasonable love / but with beestly love. Thus many
euylles there be ye fallen upon ye heed of an vnobedye^t man / and thus many
sorrowful fruytes he bry^geth forth / and many mo which no erthly tongue
ca^tell. O inobedye^ce which depryues the soul fro light of obedyence. O
inobedye^ce which depryues ye soul fro all virtue / and arayes it with all vices
/ you takes away fro hy^ peace and gyues hy^ war / you takes fro him life and
gyues hy^ death / you draws hy^ out of ye ship of his order and drenches him i^
ye see of this wretched world / and so stra^gles hy^ in sin / making him to
swymme with his own arms / there he should swymme with the arms of his order /
you arayes him with all manner wretchedness / you makes him dye for ho^ger /
taking away fro him the meet of yt merit of obedyence / you gyues him
co^tynuall bytternesse / and fro all delectacyo^ of sweetness thou depryues
him and fro all good / and makes him to stand in all manner of evil. In this
life you makes hy^ bear ye ernest of endelesse turme^t / and if he amend hy^
not or tha^ he pass out of this world / you ledes that same inobedyent soul
to endelesse da^pnacyo^ / ever to be turmented with ye fendes ye ^ll out of heaven
for ^^^yr inobedye^ce / by ye which they were rebel to me / and now be in the
arms of hell / right so thou inobedyence by cause thou was rebel to obedyence
/ and did throw a way fro ye this keye of obedience with which you should have
opened ye wyket in ye gate of heaven / and you did take i^ thy ho^de you keye of
inobedye^ce / wherewith you hase opened the gate of heaven. Of the imparfeccyo^ of
the^ which be slow and unlusty i^ relygyo^ / all be it yt they keep them fro
deedly sins / and of ye remedy how yt they may come out of yt vnlustynes. O
Dear daughter how many be there now of ye wretched inobedyen cers / which in
these days be fed and noryshed in ye ship of relygyon / and right few there
be yt be very obedyencers (nevertheless sothe it is) that between these perfyte
obedyencers and these wretched obedyencers be many / which live comunely in
the order / for another they be perfyte as they should be / nor they be much
wicked / because they keep clean their co^scye^ce fro deedly syn^e / but yet
they sto^de in dullness and neclyge^ce of heart / and if such excercysed not
their living in keeping somewhat of their obseruau^ces of ye order / they
should fall to great perell / and therefore they have need to be right besy and
sleep not i^ derkenesse / but yt they arise fro dullness and slothe / for if
they aby^e long therein / they be able for to fall right lore / and yet though
they fall not / they should slode under man's praysy^ge a plesau^ce / colored
with ye color of relygyo^ / besye^ge the^ rather in kepy^ge of some outward
cerymonyes in ye sight of man / tha^ for to keep properly ye pure religyo^ /
and oftetymes such with lytellyghte yt they have be able to fall to domes and
demynges of them yt keep ye order more straytely tha^ they and in less
perfeccyon of ceremonies / of whom they make themself specyal kekers. To all
such it seems to the^ right noyus for to dwell in comune obedience / in
asmoche as they neclygently ouerpasse true obedience / and with much pain
and labor and with a cold heart they bear yt obseruau^ces of ye order. Thus
they offend perfeccyon / by ye which they entered / and though they do little
harm (as I have said to other) yet nevertheless they do full evil / ye is
because they come not clereli out of ye world / where they should have lived and
kept ye keye of general obedience / and than for to come to relygyo^ so for
to receive ye ly tell keye of partyculer obedience / for to open there with the
wyket of heaven gate / the which keye should be tied by a tho^ge of vylyte and
abieccyo^ / setting naught by himself / and with the same tho^ge of vylyte to
keep it myghtely in ye ho^de of fervent love. All such daughter be able to
come to perfeccyo^ if they will / for they be more nere to perfeccyo^ tha^
other wretches / and yet it may be said of such otherwise / yt they be more
harder for to be raised up fro they i^perfeccyo^ in their degree / than a wicked
liver in his degree. Will you know why? Certain for it is openly know yt a
wicked man does evil / his his own conscience tells hy^ so / but for his
own proper love which has so bly^ded hy^ / he has no might for to arise
out of sin / he sees well with one natural light ye it is evil which he
does / for if it were asked of him whyther it were evil do yt he does / he
would say yes / but yet he would excuse hy^ and say yt his freylte is somoche
/ ye he may in no wise rise hp / thus he will say though he say not truth /
for with my help he may arise if he will. But these yt be so neclyge^t and
slow / which another do great evil nor great good know nor their own dulnes
nor will not know it / nor howmoche harm they do to the^ self / nor they
recke never though they arise never the^s / nor though it never be showed nor
told to the^ / and yet wha^ it is showed the^ they will not arise / because
they be bound by yt vnlustynes of their own hertes / by the long cord of
custom. In what manner may such arise? Certain yt they knowledge with their
tongues how they have myslyued / and tha^ with hate of their own pleasau^ce and
liking / send yt meke knowledge in to the fire of my dyuyne charity / weddy^ge
themself now to yt spouse of obedience / as though they should now enter in
to relygyon with ye ring of holy feythe / and let the^ no more sleep in yt
wretched state / for it was and is great dysplesaunce to me and much harm to
the^ / it may well be said to such yt word yt saint Ioha^ reherseth in ye
Apocalypse thus / would god they were cold or hoot / but because they be another
cold nor hoot / but only lewe warm / therefore I shall begy^ne to throw such
out of my mouth / for if they turn not fro yt vnlustynesse and dullness /
they be able to fall right sore (and if they fall) they be worthy to be
reproved of me. It were more joyful to me yt such were as Ise / living in yt
world with gene tall obedyence / which in regard of ye fire of very
obedyencers / they be but as Ise / and therefore I say it were lever to me that
they were as Ise. Lo daughter to ye have I declared this parable / lest yt
error fall in yt / weny^ge yt I had lever such one were in ye see of deedly
sin / tha^ so i^ ye vnlustynesse and neclyge^ce of i^parfeccyo^ / for by such
i^parfeccyo^ he might fall to syn^e / and ye sin of man is so dysplesaunt to
me and so venomous / yt I may in no wise suffer it pass unpunished / therefore
they should arise gracyously fro such dulnes and neclyge^t lyuy^ge / by some
manner of ghostly excercyse with waky^ge / mekenes / and co^tynuall prayer and se
inwardely the^ self and behold i^ those relygyous me^ yt have lived in
relygyo^ before / which were me^ as they be / noryshed with ye same milk / and
in the same manner borne / and I am ye same god now yt I was tha^ / my might is
never feeble / my will is never lessed / nor also my wisdom for to give you
clear light to se and know my truth / therefore (as I have said) they may if
they will come to parfeccyo^ of their order / so yt they will put away fre ye eye
of their intelleccyon ye cloud of their own love / and tha^ they may re^ne
with light perfytely with the^ yt be my very obedye^cers i^ relygyo^. Thus they
may come to perfeccyon by this remedy and never else. Of ye excelle^ce of
obedience / and of ye goods which obedience gives to hy^ ye takes it in
sothefastnesse. THis is yt very remedy which my very obedyencer keeps every
day / encresynge in himself yt virtue of obedience with light of feythe /
desyry^ge scorns and repreues for my love / and yt his sovereign should put
always on hy^ strayte charges / yt the virtue of obedience and her suster
pacyence ruste not / lest wha^ they had need to work with them / they might
defayle them / or else that they were to them for fault of such hard
imposycyo^s of soueraynes to hard to work with / and therefore contynually the
desire works / and suffers no time to over pass / for of desire they be
right hongry. Desire is as a besy huswyfe that never will be ydel / one
delectable obedyence / one peaseable obedyence / one sweet obedyence / one
shynynge obedience / yllumyned full of light / that has put away the
derkenesse of proper delectacyo^ / one obedience that quyckeneth and gives to
such a soul life of grace / ye has chosen the for his spouse / thou hase
put a way fro hy^ death of his own proper will / which proper will makes
war and bry^geth in death in to the soul / thou art large / for thou makes
the subject to every reasonable creature. Certain also thou art benynge /
and with meke benygny be and myldenesse thou beres every great charge / for
thou art coupled with the virtue of strength and very pacye^ce / thou art
also corowned with the virtue of parseueraunce / you fayles never by ye
i^portunyte of thy prelate and sovereign / for though he ly upon yt great
importable charges without dyscrecyon / thou beres them all gladly and
pacyently with the light of feythe / you art so knytte with meekness / that
no manner creature may draw it out of thy hand for holy desire / and what
shall we say more dear daughter of this excellent virtue / we say yt it is a
good without evil / it stondeth hyddein the ship / whom no contrary wind
may noye nor disease / for she makes a subject in relygyon to row with the
arms of her sovereign / and not with her own. A very obedyencer shall not give
reckoning of hy^ self to me / but his sovereign shall reken for him / be glad
therefore dear daughter / and have great delight in this relygyous virtue / and
thou will be kind to me endelesse fader / be obedyent / for obedyence shall
show if thou be ky^de / which comes out of charity / and charity comes fro
ye knowledge of my endelesse sothefastnesse / so that it is a parfyte knowledge
in my only so the fast sone Ihesu / which sone showed to you by his charity
the way of very obedience / making himself obedyent unto the death of the
cross / techynge the thereby a rule for to contynu in very obedyence unto thy
end / in whose obedyence which was the keye ye opened heaven / is founded the
general obedyence that is given to you / and also this partyculer obedyence
(as I have told the before in ye beginning of this treatise) this obedyence
gives such a light in the soul / that it makes a soul true both to the
order / and also to his sovereign in relygyon / in the which light (ye is ye
light of holy feythe) a soul forgeteth her self (not in requyrynge in what
wise obedyence of his sovereign is given to him) for in what soul very
odedyence is / it shows well that it is deed in his own feeling / which
sencyble feeling / sercheth and enquyreth more after other things than his
own / as an inobedyent soul does / which will ever inquire the will of his
bydder / and deem it after his derke knowledge / a very obedyencer with ye clear
light of feythe / demeth ever the will of his sovereign to good / and therefore
such one feleth not nor inquyreth not his own will / but boweth his heed
obedyently to the will of his sovereign / and so with the blessed odor of very
holy obedyence / ye soul is noryshed / and this virtue encresed somoche in yt
soul / as ye soul delyteth in the light of holy feythe / for charity which
has brought forth obedyence / comes of ye light of feythe / and with the
same light of feythe / with the which a soul knows both himself and me /
he loves me and loweth him to me / and the more it loves and is so loved / yt
more rather it obeys. Than obedience with her suster pacyence they show if
such a soul be arrayed with her wedding cote of charity / with the which
cote ye shall enter in to end less bliss / where obedience shall open the
wyket of the gate with her keye and stand without / but charity which gave this
keye to her / shall enter in with the fruit of obedience. Every virtue (as I
have said) stondeth without / but his virtue of charity shall enter in /
obedience has ye keye / and she herself is the keye that opens / for with
the inobedyence of the first man Adam heaven was shut / and with the meke and
feythfull obedyence of my only sothefastsone Ihesu that vndefouled lamb /
end less life was made open / ye which stood long time closed fro man and
shut.

The fourth chapyter is dystynccyon of two manners of obedyences / that is to
say of obedyence of relygyous people / and of obedience which is done to a
certain parsone out of religion for god. How god rewards not after the
travail of obedyence / nor after the length of ye time / but after the
magnytude of charity / and of other matters longing to obedyence / as it is
specyfyed before in the calendar. Ca. iiii.
AS I have said to ye dear daughter / my only sothefast sone has given to
you obedyence / as for a rule and a doctrine / and as a keye for to open with
the gate of heaven / and so to come to your end / for the which end ye have
long trauayled. He also left to you a precepte for to live under general
obedience / counseylynge you also yt if ye would come and attain to more
parfeccyon / and so enter by the strayte gate of heaven / as they do that live
in relygyon and order / and also as they do that live and never receive order
of relygyon / and yet be in the ship of parfeccyon / as all such that do keep
parfeccyon of the cou^seyles without any order / refusing richesse and worldely
pompes / both actual and mental / keeping also contynence / which live in
the state of vyrgynyte / or else in the state of chastyte / keeping also
obedyence / submytty^ge themself (as I have said to ye in another place) to
some creature to whom they enforce with parfyte obedience for to obey unto
their lives end. If thou will ask me which of these obedyences be more
medefull / whyder he that stondeth in ye order of of relygyo^ or this / I shall
tell the / the merit of obedyence is not mesured / another in the deed doing
nor in the place nor in whom (that is to say) whyther it be of more
worthynesse in a seculer or in a relygyons / but after ye mesure of love that
an obedyencer has / with that mesure he inesureth to him that is very
obedyent / the imparfeccyo^ of an enyll prelate is no disease in hy^ nor
griueth him not / but otherwhyle it is great profit to him / for with
par^ecucyons and vndyser ere charges of grievous obedyence / the virtue of
obedyence is increased / and also pasyence her suster / nor also vnparfyte
place lets nor noyeth him not (I say vnparfyte for this cause) for relygyon
is more parfyte / more stydfaste / and more stable / tha^ any other state is /
and therefore I call an vnparfyte place of such that have a little keye of
obedyence keeping without relygyon the counseyles (but yet I call not their
obedyence vnparfyte nor of less mede) than of them that live in relygyon / for
every obedyence (as I have said) and every virtue else is mesured after the
mesure of love / yet in many other things / as of the vows which be made in
the hondes of a sovereign in relygyon / and for many suffrau^ces which a man
suffers in relygyon / obedyence is better and more proved in relygyon than
out of relygyo^ / for there every bodily act of a relygyous man is bound to
the youke of obedience / so strongely that it may not be lostd when he will /
that is bound without the trespass and office of deedly sin / in asmoche
asthat vow is approved of holy church / but this vow is not so / this
byndeth himself wylfully for love yt he has to obedyence / but with no
solemn vow / therefore he that by^deth him to this bow / he may go therfro
without offense of any deedly syn^e / if he have lawful excusacyo^s (that is
to say) that he go not therfro by his own defaute / for if he went therfro
and for soke it through his own defaute / it were not without grievous sin /
yet were he properly bound to deedly syn^e by that forsakynge. Sees thou not
now what dyfference is between the one and the other / that one makes a vow
freely with inte^cyon never for to break it / but with no charter of affyrmacyon
/ yt other has made a vow with affyrmacyo^ of a charter or of an instrument
/ and he offers up ye same instume^t or charter with an open solemn
professyon in to the hondes of his sovereign / there forsakynge himself / and
promyttynge to keep obedience / contynence / and wylful pouerte / and his
sovereign in my name there promytteth to him again (if he keep these) for to
receive for the^ endelesse life / therefore this is more parfyte / and yt other
is of less parfeccyo^ / this is more syker / for if he fall / he is more apt
for to arise / for he has more help / but yt other is more doubtefull and of
less sykernesse / and is rather more apt if he fall to turn his heed
backwarde / for he feleth hy^ nothing bound by vow of professyon made / yet
he stondeth as a relygyous man or than he be professed / for unto the time that
he be professed he may go therfro / the mede (as I said) and yet say of
obedyence / is give after the love that an obedyencer has / so that every man
in what state he stondeth in may parfytely win mede for his obedience / if
he be set in love / for some I call in one state / and some in another / as a
man is able for to receive yt state that he is called to / but yet every man in
the same state that he is called to may be fulfilled with this fore said mesure
of love / if he be a seculer and love more than a relygyous man / he shall
receive more mede / and in the same wise a relygyous man more than a seculer.
How god rewards not after the travail of obedyence nor after the length of
the time / but after the magnytude of charity / of ye redynesse and quyckenesse
of them that be very obedyencers / and of the miracles which god shows of
this virtue. ALl you have I send in to the vyneyerde of obedience for to till
it i^ diverse wyses / to every man shall he give a reward / after the mesure of
his love / and not after his labor / nor after the mesure of his time (yt is
to say) he that came first shall no more have / tha^ he that came last /
after ye sentence of ye gospel / which my sone has put to you for ensample
of the^ that were hired of a lord for to till in his vyneyerde / and of the^
that were ydele / the fore said lord gave asmoche to him that came at even at
the last hour / as he gave to him that came in the morrow at the first hour
/ or thryde / or syxte / or.ix. or at even song / by this may ye know that
ye shall not be rewarded another after your time / nor after your work / but
after ye mesure of love / many be send i^ to this vineyard in chyldeheed for
to till it / and some enter later / and some i^ their old age / these ye come
last / many of them should go and work in yt vyneyerde of relygyon with great
fervent love / as they that came first. Why is ye? Certain for they think
their time is short / and so they be equypolent and even with them yt came
before / and they went easy pases by love / therefore by love of obedyence a
soul receives his mede / there he fylleth his vessel in me that am the
peaseable see / but many there be / ye which be so ready for to obey / for
obedience is so very incarnate and grounded i^ their souls / that they behold
not the cause why certain things be bid to them of him that byddeth the^ /
but uneath they may abide so long / till ye word of their sovereign be out of
their mouths / for he under stondeth of his sovereign more the intent of his
byddy^ge tha^ he does ye word / and therefore a very obedyencer obeys more
to the intent tha^ to the word / demynge ye will of his sovereign for to be my
will / and that he byddeth him by the will and dyspe^sacyon of me / and therefore
(as I said) such one obeys rather to ye intent than to the word / and so
he obeys to his word / for first he obeyed with affection to his will / this
was well showed to hy^ / as it is red In vitas patrum. which first obeyed in
his affection / for when ye he began to write an. o. his prelate and his
sovereign bad him do a certain thing of obedyence / to ye which he was so
ready / that he gave no space to himself for to fulfill yt lytello / but anon
without any taryenge / he went to his obedyence and left his o / unwritten
half / than I for to show you how much acceptable obedyence is to me / ye
other half of ye same o / I parformed and fulfilled it with gold / therefore
this glorious virtue of obedyence is so plesau^t and lyky^ge to me / yt in none
other virtue so many miracles and tokens be showed of me (as be for yt) for yt
virtue comes fro the light of feythe / earth is to this virtue obedient /
beestes be obedyent / water is obedyent there to / yt the earth obeys to yt
virtue / you hase my^de how thou hase read In vitas patrum. of a dyscyple which
was bid of his fader ye abbot for to set in ye ground a dry tree / and of
obedyence every day to water it / ye same obedyent dyscyple asked no questyons
how that might be / but without any inquysycyon of possybylyte he fulfilled his
obedyence (in somoche) yt by the virtue of yt obedyence and of feythe the dry
tree waxed grene and bare fruit / in token that yt soul was lift away fro
ye drynes of inobedyence / and than after yt grentnesse it bare fruit / so ye
ye apples of tree were called of brederne fruit of obedyence / in the same
wise it is of beestes / yt they obey to this virtue / for there was In vitas
patrum. a certain dyscyple was send out by obedyence / and in the way as he
went he found a dragon / and he took him and bound him in a bond / and so
lad him to his abbot / but his abbot as a dyscrete leche / lest that dyscyple
should have be extolled by pride of vain glory for that deed / and also for to
preue his pacyence / he dyscretely put him and the beast fro him with boystous
words (saying to him thus) you be hase you brought an other be bound
with the. In the same wise it is of ye fire / for that obeys to this virtue /
for as thou knows right well in holy writ / yt many because they will not
offend my obedience / but yt they were ever ready for to obey to me redyly
when that they were cast in to the hot brennynge fire / it noyed them not /
like as you fyndes of three children yt were cast in yt bre^ny^ge oue^ / and of
many other / which were to long to tell. Also in the same wise of the water /
for that obeyed to this virtue which was well know by Maure / for wha^ he was
send for to take out that dyscyple which was sonke in the water / he ran
upon the water as he would upon ye earth and brought out that dyscyple / he
thought not one himself / but with the light of feythe he purposed for to
fulfill the obedience of his sovereign / in all things if thou open the eye of
thy intelleccyon / thou shall well find that ye excellence of this virtue is
specially showed / so that all things that a relygyous man does should be
left for obedyence / for though a relygyous man were in somoche araysed by
contemplacyon and union of his soul in me / that his body were there with lift
up fro the earth / and to him were commanded a certain obedience of his
sovereign / yt is speky^ge and byddy^ge to hy^ generally and not partyculerly /
which general speky^ge sets no law of tulfyllynge if he might / he should
enforce him for to leave his high contemplacyo^ for to fulfill his obedience /
in ye same wise a relygyous man should leave his taxed special prayers for need
/ for charity / and for obedyence. All this commendacyon I tell the of
obedyence / for I would that thou knew how liking it is to me and how
pleasau^te / and also that I would it were right prompte and ready in my
servants / for what that ever a very obedyencer does / it turns to him for
merit and mede / if he ete he eteth for obedyence / if he sleep he slepeth for
obedyence / if he go / stand / fast / wake / all this he does for obedience /
also if he do service to his brother or to his euencryste^ / he does it for
obedyence / if he be in the quere or in the fraytur or in his Cell. Who ledeth
him or makes him stand in these places? Certain obedyence with the light of
very feythe / with the which light / he has mortyfyed himself to al his
own proper will / and lowed himself with holy hate of himself in ye arms of
his order / and in the hondes of his sovereign / with this obedyence he rests
in ye ship of relygyon / he roweth in the same ship throwout all this
tempestyous see of this wretched life / with great ghostly prosperyte / with a
clear shynynge soul and tranquyllyte of heart / for obedience with feythe has
put away all derkenes / he is right strong and syker / for obedience has put
away fro hy^ feblenesse and dread / by auoydy^ge of his own will. Of whom
comes such feblenesse and vnordynate dread / and what eteth this spouse
obedyence? Certain her meet is ye knowledge of herself and me / for a
relygyous man should know himself full of defautes and right naught without
any being of him self / and me that am he that am / in whom he tastes and
eteth my sothefaste truth / which he knows in the sothefastnesse of my
only incarnate sone Ihesu. And what drynketh this spouse obedyence? The drink
yt she drynketh in my sons blood (in ye which blood) my sone shows to a
religyous man my truth and meruaylous love that I have to mankind / in that
blood he showed his obedience / that was put to hy^ of me endelesse fader for
you / and there fore a very obedyencer makes him very drunk ghostly in that
blood / and after time he is so dru^ke with that blessed blood / he has all
lost and hyd himself in obedyetce / and al his co^ceytes and felynges and by
grace he has me full / tastynge me by affection of love / with light of
feythe in obedyence / all the life of such an obedyencer cries peace / and in
his death when he is departed fro this life / he receives ye thing ye was
promised him of his sovereign in my name / that is ever lasty^ge life / syghte
of peace and of endelesse tran quyllyte and rest / which is a good vnestymable
/ that none living in ecthe may think nor co^prehende in his wits howmoche
it is / for it is infynyte / in asmoche as it may not be co^prehe^ded of a
less thing / for every less thing is so it as a vessel put in the sea /
but only ye same quantyte which it has received / the sea is that which
comprehends / and not the vessel put in to ye see^ tyght so I that am yt
peaseable see / am he alone that comprehend myself and compass myself / and
of my own comprehencyon and estymacyon I joy in my self / which joy and
good yt I have in myself / I part it with you / to each of you after his
mesure / for I fill his mesure / and never hold it to be void / gyuynge to
him perfyte blessedness / and he comprehends and knows of my goodness /
asmoche as I will that he know / thus is a very obedyencer with the light of
feythe in my truth / all brenned in ye furneys of my endelesse charity /
noynted with meekness / drunk with my sons blood / he is also proved with
pacyence the suster of obedyence / and he dyspyseth himself by vylyte and
abieccyon / and with strength he abides in long parseuerau^ce / byclypped al
about with many other virtues / and with the fruit of them / he receives his
end and reward of me that am his maker.

The fyfte chapyter of this last party is of a repetycyon of all the hole book
/ and how this devout soul yeldynge worship and thankynges to god / made a
prayer for all holy church and for all the world / and here is commended the
virtue of feythe / and so is ye end fulfilled of this book. Ca. v.
Now right sweet and dear daughter I have satysfyed thy desire / fro ye
beginning thereof unto ye last of obedyence / thou knows well at the
begynnyge thou prayed to me with love and longing desires / by the which
desires / I made the to ask of me / that is that I should encrese in thy soul
the fire of my brennynge charity / and than thou did ask of me four
petycyons. One was for thy self / whom I satysfyed pllumyny^ge me by my
endelesse truth / there showing ye how thou might know my sothefast truth /
which thou desired to know / and there I told ye that with knowledge of
thyselfe and of me by the light of feythe thou might come to ye knowledge of my
truth. The secu^de petycyon that you made was ye I should show mercy to the
word. The third was yt thou prayed to me for my mystery al body of holy
church / ye I would avoid thens derkenesse and parsecucyons / desiring
thyselfe ye I should punysshe ye wickedness of them upon the / and there I
declared to ye that no pain / which is given in a time that has end / may
satasfy ye sin done against me that am endelesse good (namely the pure pain
alone) but it satysfyeth thus / if the pain be oned with desire of soul / and
co^trycyon of heart and the manner how / there I declared the / and also I
answered ye there yt I would she we mercy to ye world / and there I told the /
that mercy is enpropryed to me / for by mercy and by meruaylous love that I
have to mankind / I send my only sothefaste sone / whom I put to the in you
lykenes of a bridge that recheth fro heaven to earth / by union of my dyuyne
nature oned to your nature / this I show the for to yllumyne ye the more in
my truth / and there also I told the how a man may ascend up by that bridge
by three grees / that is by three myghtes of the soul / to these three grees how
thou should ascend upon the bridge of my sone there I told the / that first
thou must ascend upon the grees of his feet / and than upon the side / and so
at the last upon the grees of his mouth / in the which grees I put three
states of the soul / that is imperfect state / parfyte state / and most
parfyte state / in the which most parfyte state / a soul is come to ye
excellence of vnytyue love / in each of them I showed the clearly there that
thing which does away fro that soul imparfeccyon / and makes it to come
to parfeccyon / and of ye dysceytes of fendes / and of proper spyrytuall love /
and also there I told the in these states of three vndernymynges that my
myldenesse does to a soul / one I told ye I do in this life / another in the
death (in such that with hope dye in deedly sin) of whom I told the that
all such did go under the bridge by the fendes way / of whose wretchedness
there I told the / and the third of ye last general dome / and of ye peynes
of dampened souls / and of the joy of blessed souls / wha^ each soul shall be
arrayed with the dowerys of his body / also there I behyghte the / and yet I
promise the that with many passions of my servants I shall reform my spouse
holy church (styrry^ge you to suffer disease for it) and for to sorrow for ye
wyckednes of the^ that do parfeccyo^ to it / there also I showed the the great
excellence of my mynysters / and also of the reverence which I require of
seculers / for to be give to the^ i^ my name / for ye defaute of the^ shall not
mynesshe their reverence which should be do to them i^ my name / and howmoche
the contrary of this dyspleaseth me / and of the virtue of the^ that mynyster to
me as angels / where I touched to the of the great worthy excellence of ye
blessed sacrament / also there I told ye of ye states of teeres and whense
they came / where I told the ye all teeres come fro ye well of ye heart. and
so by row there I told ye of.iiii. states of teeres / and of the fylthe which
brings in death. I answered ye also to the fourth petycyon of that which
thou prayed me ye to partyculer falling I should provide / and so I provided
(as thou knows) moreover I declared to ye both in general and in special my
prouydence / fro the beginning of the world unto the last end / how that
all things that I have do / I do with my dyuyne prouydence / both in
trybulacyons and comfortes bodyly and ghostly / all is done for your best
after my dyuyne prouydence / that you may be in me holy / and ye in you my
sothefaste truth may be fulfilled / for my sothefaste truth was to make you
of naught / and for to give you life everlasting / which ryghtwysenes was
showed and is given to you / with the precious blood of my only sothefaste
sone Ihesu / forthermore at ye last I satysfyed thy desire / in that that thou
desired to here of parfeccyon of obedyence / and of the imparfeccyon of
inobedyence / and whense obedience comes / and what thing draws it fro you
/ I put it to the as for agener all keye (and so it is) I told ye there also of
partyculer obedience / and of the^ yt be parfyte and vnparfyte / both of such
that be i^ order and of such as be out of order / dnd of each of the^ by row
/ of peace also which very obedyence gives / and howmoche an inobedyencer is
dysceyued / telling the there that death entrede in to this world / by the
inobedye^ce of Adam / therefore now I endelesse fader most sovereign and
endelesse truth conclude to the / that in ye obedyence of my sone all ye
received life / for right as in the inobedye^ce of the first old man all ye
received death / so all those that will bear the keye of obedience may receive
life of yt new man Ihesu christ / of whom to you I made a bridge / for ye
street of heaven was broke / therefore if ye will go by this right sweet way with
the keye of obedience / ye may lightly over pass all manner derkenesse of the
world and not offend / and so at the last with the same keye for to open
heaven. Now dear daughter I stir the for to wayle and weep / and my other
servants / for by waylynge and weeping and by meke co^tynuall prayer / I will
show mercy to ye world / run therefore now by this street of truth all
mortyfyed / lest that you be vndernome in thy slow going / and therefore I will
that thou run / for I shall now require more of the than I did first /
because I have showed my self openly enough to the in my sothfastnes / be
ware now that thou never go out of thy Cell of knowledge / but there in that
Cell keep the / and spend the tresoure which is given to the / that is the
doctrine of truth grounded upon a quycke stone christ Ihesu arrayed with light
/ which forsakes derkenesse i^ this light / dear and well beloved sweet
daughter / array ye theri. How this devout soul yeldynge worship and
thankynges to god / made a prayer for all holy church and for all ye world /
and here is commended ye virtue of feythe / and so is ye end fulfilled in this
book. THan that soul when it had thus seen and behold with the eye of
intelleccyon and with ye light of feythe knew my sothefastnesse and the
excellence of obedyence / and when it had so herd with ghostly herynge and
tastynge by affection all these things with love longy^ge desire / she lift
herself above herself and beheld in the dyuyne majesty and said thus.
Thanking be to the endelesse fader / that hase no abhomy nacyon of me thy
creature / nor hase not turned thy face fro me / nor thou hase not despised my
desires / thou endelesse light consyders no thing my derkenesse / thou life
would not consider that I am death / nor thou leche would not forsake me for my
grievous abhomynable ghostly sickness of sin / thou endelesse purete despises
me not yt am full of fylthe of much wretchedness / thou that art infynyte
hates me not that am fynyte and able to have end / thou wisdom lettes not to
speak ^^ me that am a fool / for all these / and many other infynyte euyls and
defautes that be i^ me / thy wisdom / thy goodness / and thy myldenesse /
have not dyspleased me / but i^ thy light thou hase given me light / and in
thy wisdom you hase given me true knowledge / and in thy myldenesse I have
found love of the and of my neighbor. Who constrained the there to? Certain
not my virtues / but only thy charity / that same love has constrained the
to yllumyne the eye of my intelleccyo^ in ye light of holy feythe / that I
might under stand and know thy sothefast truth showed to me. Grant to me
therefore blessed endelesse fader / that my mind may be able for to keep thy
benefytes retentyfely / and that my will may brenne ferue^tly in ye fire of
thy charity / yt I may bathe soul and body buriowne i^ thy sons blood / and
that with ye same blood and ye keye of obedyence / I may open the gate of
heaven / and this same I pray the hertely for every reasonable creature / both
in general and in special / and for the mysteryall body of holy church. I
knowledge well and deny not that thou loved me me or that I loved the. O
endelesse trynyte / o very godheed / thy dyuyne nature has made the price of
thy sons blood of so great valu / thou endelesse trynyte art a deep see /
in the which yt moore I enter / ye more I fynda / thou art insatiable / for a
soul that fulfylleth him in thy depenesse / is not so fulfilled / but ever it
is made hongry in the / it thrysteth in the endelesse trynyte / desiring with
light to se the in endeles light / for as an heart desires to the well of
rennynge water / so desires my soul to go out of the derke prison of my body
and se the in sothefastnesse as you art. O how long time shall thy face be hyd
fro my eyes / o endelesse trynyte the depenesse of fire and charity / unloose
and unbind fro ye soul ye cloud of my body / the knowledge that thou hase
give me of the / causes me in truth to desire for to over pass the burthon
of my body / for I have tasted and seen with the light of intelleccyon with thy
light / the depenesse of thy endelesse trynyte / by the which syghte I saw
me in the / to be the image of ye / hauy^ge mind by the might of the the
endelesse fader and intelleccyon / by ye wisdom of thy sone and of ye holy
ghost that comes both fro ye and fro thy sone (will) by the wiche will / I am
able for to love / thou endelesse tryny rearte my maker / and I thy creature /
I know well endelesse trynyte by the shedynge of ye blood of thy love / that
thou art a Iolyous lover of ye fayrenesse of thy creature / o endeles depenes
/ o endeles godheed / o deep see / what might you give me more than thyselfe /
thou wastes and consumes in the hete of the love of the soul / thou art the
fire / thou does away all coldenesse / thou art that fire that yllumyneth /
and with thy light thou hase made me to know thy truth / thou art yt very
light above nature (in so great habundaunce and parfeccyon) that thou makes
clear ye light of feythe / in ye which feythe / I se that my soul has life
/ and in that light it receives the that art very light / in ye light of
feythe it has won wisdom / that is the wisdom of thy only sone / In
light of feythe I am stydfaste / strong / and parseueraunte / in the light
of feythe I hope / which suffers me not to defayle i^ my iournaye / that
light techeth me the way / without this light I must needs walk in
derkenesse / and there fore endelesse fader I pray the yllumyne me with the
light of holy feythe / for that light is a see which norysheth the soul in
the that art the peaseable see endelesse trynyte. The water of thy peaseable
see is not troublous / therefore him needs not to dread that is in that see /
for he knows ye truth of thy only sothefaste sone Ihesu christ / he is
such a myrrour yt needs I must behold / in / the which myrrour is
represented to me that am thy image and creature / the which myrrour also
represents to me the that art most sovereign / i^fynyte / and meruaylous
good / and such good as is above al good / blessed good incomprehensyble good
and meruaylous good / fayrenesse above all feyrenesse / wisdom above all
wisdom / you art the meet of angeles / and with the fire of love thou hase
given thyselfe to us wretches / thou art that vesture which couers all
nakedness / thou art he that fedes all hongry in thy sweetness / thou act
sweet without any bytternesse. O endelesse trynyte / in thy light which I
have received light of holy feythe / I have know by many meruaylous
declaracyons of the way of parfeccyon that with light and not with derkenesse
I may now serve the / therefore I pray the endelesse trynyte that I may be a
myrrour of good and holy living / that I may arise gracyously fro the
derkenesse of my wretched living / in ye which derkenesse I have always
hyderto be bly^ded / by ye which knowledge of thy truth as I should / therefore
I might not well and parfytely love it. Why knew I the not? Certain for I
saw ye not with the glorious light of holy feythe / and also for the cloud
of my own proper love had blinded ye eye of my intelleccyon / and yet thou
endelesse trynyte with thy light hase dyssolued my derkenesse. Who may at
tayne for to come to ye heyghte and to yield to ye tha^kynges for so grate a
gift / and for the large benefyces which you hase give me of ye doctrine of thy
endelesse sothefastnes / ye which is a special grace above the general grace
that you gyues to other creatures / who gave all this? Certain thou thy self /
wherefore good lord endelesse trynyte give me a light of thy grace / yt with
the same light I may give the tha^kynges / array me with the endelesse truth
/ that I may feythfully run with parfeccyo^ i^ this deedly way with very
obedyence and with the light of holy feythe / with the which light me seems
you hase made me now lately ghostly drunk / Joy and everlasting worship be to
the without end. AMEN.

Every good thing the more it be communycate and dysparsed abroad / the more
fruit and profit comes thereof / as it is showed in the gospel. whete if it
be cast abroad on the earth / it brings forte much fruit / and where it is
laid up together / it brings for the nothing / but corrupts / norysheth /
and ge^dreth vermyne. The philosopher also says. Good the more common it be /
ye more godly it is. Therefore if worldly riches / given and dysparsed abroad
where need is / for ye love of god / shall be rewarded / as he say the himself
/ an hundredth fold here in this life / and with ever lasting joy here after.
Much more ghostli tresure co^munycate and spread abroad / where of i^ these
days is much need / shall be rewarded much more largely both here and in
heaven. This considering a right worshypfull and devout ge^tylma^ / master
Richard Sutton esquyer / steward of the holy monastery of Syon / finding
this ghostely tresure these dyologes and reuelacyons of the new seraphy call
spouse of christ saint Katheryne of Seen / in a corner by it self / willing
of his great charity it should come to light / that many relygyous and
devout souls might be releued and have comfort thereby / he has caused at
his great cost / this book to be prynted / trustige that much fruit shall
come thereof / to all ye shall read or here of it / desiring none other thige
therefore / but only ye reward of god and their devout prayers / for health
of his soul. And thus ^^deth this book / Imprynted at London / in Fleet street / at ye sign of ye son / by me wynkyn de word. The year of our
