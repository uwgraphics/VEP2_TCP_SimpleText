Saint Poul doctor of veryte says to us that al things that been reduced by
writing / ben wryton to our doctrine / And Boece makes mention that the health
of every person proceeds dyuercely / Then syche it is so that the christian
f^yth is ^ffermed and corrobered by the doctors of holy church / Nevertheless
the things passed dyuersly reduced to remembrance / engendre in us correction
of unlawful life For the works of the ancient and old people ben for to give
to us ensau^^le to live in good and virtuous operacions digne and worthy of
health ^ following the good / and eschewyng the evil And also in recountyng of
hy^ hystoryes / the comune understanding is better content to the ymagynacion
local than to simple auctoryte / to which it is submysed / I say this gladly /
For oftymes I have been excyted of the venerable man messire henry bolomyer
chano^ne of lausa^ne for to reduce for his playsyr sum hystoryes as well in
latin and in romau^ce as in other facion wryton / that is to say of the right
puyssaunt / virtuous / and noble charles the great / king of fra^^ce and
emperor of Rome / Sone of the great Pepyn / And of his princes and barons / As
Rolland Olyuer / and other / touching sum works haultay^ done and co^mysed
by their great strength and right ardaunt courage / to the exaltacyon of the
christian faith and to the confusyon of the h^then sarazyns and myscreaunts
which is a werk well contemplatyf for to live we^ / And by cause the said henry
Bolomyer has seen of this matter / and the hystoryes dysi^yned without order /
therefore at his request after the capacyte of my little entendement / And after
thystoryes and matter that I have founden I have ordained this book following /
And it might so have been that if I had been more largely informed and al plain
I had letter made it / For I have not said any mater^ / but I have thereof ben
informed / First by an autentyke book named myrrour hystoryal / as by the
ano^nes and sum other ^^okes which make mencyon of the work following / And
b^ caus^ I may have a little part^ of honorable fou^deme^t I sha^ touch of the
first christian king (...) france For the most part of th^s book is made to
thonour of the fre^ssh men / and for prouffyte of ^uery man / and after the
desire of the red^r and herer / there shall be founden in the table all plain
the matter of which the person shall have desire to here or read / without
great a^^dyacyon / by the playsyr of god to whom I submytte al mine ente^te to
wri^e no thing that ought to be blamed / ne but that it be to the health and
sauacion of every person /

Then for as moc^e I late had fynysshed in enprynte the book of the noble and
vyctoryous king Arthur first of the three most noble and worthy of christian
kings / and also to fore had reduced in to englisshe the noble hystorye and
life of Godesroy of boloyn king of Iherusalem / last of the said iij worthy
Sum persons of noble estate and degree have desired me to reduce thystorye
and life of the noble and christian prince Charles the great king of frauuce and
emperor of Rome / the second of the three worthy / to the end that thystoryes /
acts / and lives may be had in our maternal tongue like as they be in latin or
in frensshe / For the most quantyte of the people understand not latin ne
frensshe here in this noble royame of england / And for to satysfye the desire
and request of my good synguler lords and specyal masters and friends I have
enprysed and concluded in my self to reduce this said book in to our english
/ as all alonge and plainly ye may read / here / and see in this book here
following / besechyng al them that shall find fault in the same to correct and
amend it / And also to pardone me of the rude and simple reducyng / and though
so be there be no gaye terms / n^ subtyl ne new eloquence / yet I hope that
it shall be vnderstonden and to that ^ntente I have specially reduced it / after
the simple connyng that god has lent to me / whereof I humbly and with al my
heart thank him / and also am bounden to pray for my fader and moders souls
/ that in my youth set me to scole / by which by the suffraunce of god I
get my living I hope truly And that I may so do and continue I byseche him to
grant me of his grace / and so to labor and occupye my self virtuously that
I may come out of debt and dedely sin / that after this life I may come to
his bliss in heaven AMEN /

Explicit
AS it is read in thystoryes of the trojans / After the dystructyon of the
noble cite of Troy / there was a king much noble named francus the which was
fellow of Eneas / which when he departed fro Troy came in to the regyon of
france / and began to regne in great prosperyte / and for the felycyte of his
name he did co^pose and do edyfye a cite which he named france / and so
following all the regyon was called france / and after wha^ france was
enhau^ced and reduced to mageste ryal Priamus was the first that reigned upon
the frensshe men v year / The second was marcurius xxxiij year / The iij
phara^^u^dus reigned xj year / The iiij clodyus xiiij year The v Meroneus x year
/ The vj hildericus xxvij year / and the vij was Clodoneus the first christian
king which reigned upon the frensshe men after thyncarnacion of our lord CCCC
lxxxiiij year of whom I entende to make a litel mencyon upon his ^^^ueyllous
conuersacyon /

How the king clodoneus paynym had to wife the noble clotildis daughter of the
king of burgoyne capitulo ij
IN that time was king of the burgoynons guydengus the which had iiij sons al
of good aege / that is to wete / Agabondus / the ij godogesylus / the iij
Hyspericus and the fourth Godamarus / The first agabondus repleynsshed of al
inyquyte put to death by swerd his brother hispericus / and after henge his wife
and put a stone about her neck and drowned her This hyspericus had two fair
daughters / theldest was named throne / whom agabondus her uncle bannysshed fro
his country and sent her forth in habyte dy^^ymyled / The younger of these ij
dou^ters was named clotildis whom he retained for her beauty with him in his
house / during thy^ the king clodoneus or Cloys iij frensshe being a paynym
which byleued with his subgett^^ but upon yd^lles / oftymes f^r his affairs
sent his message^s (...) to burgoyne / clotyldys th^^ fair maid was often seen
of ^he messagers of the king (...) by holden affectuously / and for her great
beaulte and dyscrescyon the said messagers ^^tyfyed it to the king (...) ^ and
when this king Cloy^ (...) enough informed of the great beaute^^ wysdom of this
maid which was christian / he was much curyous to send his herawdes unto
agabondus ^ncle of this daughter for to have her to marriage / During those
days the king Cloys had a subtyl man with him named aurelyanus which by
commandment of his lord went to the place where as was thy^ maid / and put
him self in habyte much pour and dyssymyled / and le^t his good habytes with
his fellows in a wode / and went much holyly tofore the mother church of that
place the day of a great feste / and set him self in the mids of the pour
people for to receive alms like as other dyden / when thoffyce was
accomplysshed this maid Clotildis like as the was accustomed act departing
fro the church began to give alms to the pour people / and when she came to
Aurelianus she gaf to him in his hand a pyece of gold / and anon he as glad
and well content kyssed her h^nde^ when this lady was in hy^ chamber she began
to think on that pour man that had kyssed her hand / and sent for to seche
him by her servant / when he wist it / he came to her much Ioyously / and bare
in his hand the ring of king cloys / and humbly behaved him tofore her / The
maid began to say to him / say to me wherefore dyssymylest thou thy self like
to the pour people Aurelyanus answered Madame know ye for truth that I am a
messager of the noble King cloys king of France which has sent me to you /
and being informed of your beauty and wysdom desires you to be his wife and for
to be queen / and forthwith he presented to her the ring of king cloys / the
which she took and put it in to the tresour of agabondus her uncle / and said
to the messager that he should recomaunde her to the king / in tellyng to him
that it was not leeful to a paynym to have to his wife a christian woman /
Nevertheless she prayed him that of all this he should say no word / and that
she would not do but as the king would / and upon this point auerlianus came and
showed al to the king / whereupon the king cloys the year following sent ageyn
his messager anrelianus to agabo^dus uncle of Clotildis for to have her to his
wife / when Agabondus knew then^necyon of king cloys / he ansuerd to the
messager Say hardyly to the king thy lord that he has little to do in desyryng
to have my nyece to wife but the bourgoynons wise cou^seyllours redoubtyng the
puyssaunce of king Cloys / by good counceyl when they had well serched the
tresour of Agabondus their king / and found the ring of king cloys which
clotyldis had laid therein / wherein was graue^ and portrayed his image went
and concluded to perform the will of king clois / and upon this agabondus full
of ire delyuerd Clotildis to aurelianus / he brout her with his people with
great Joy to king cloys which had great playsyr to see this fair maid And
forthwyth with all solemnyte after the manner royal he espoused her after the
custom of his law /

How king Cloys was admonested by the queen clotildis affectuously that he
should believe in the christian faith / and other matters capitulo iij
THe first night after the espousaylles at hour that the king and the queen
should sleep to gyder / Clotyldis enbraced with the love of god by great
knowledge of Ihesus our lord went and said to the king / My right dear lord I
require the / that it please the to grant to me a little demand before or I
enter in to thy bed with the / The king said demaunde^ what thou wylt / For
I am well content / Clotyldys then said to him / First I demand / require /
and admoneste the / that thou wylt believe in god of heaven Fader almighty which
made heaven and earth / and that has created the / And in Ihesu Christ his
glorious sone king of all kings / which by his passion has redeemed the / And
in the holy ghoost confirmatour and Illumynatour of al good works procedyng
fro the fader and fro the sone the foresaid Trynyte in one only essen / to
whom ought to be given al honor and all lawde and believe / Believe ye in this
holy believe and mageste / and leave the ydolles made with man's hand a
folysshe thing and vayn and think for to restore the holy chyrches which thou
have burnt / Secondly I require the that thou wylt demand my part and
porcyon of the goods of my fader and of my mother / of agabondus mine uncle /
whom he did put to death falsely and without occasyon / but the vengeance I
leave to god / when she had said this / the king answered Thou have demanded me
a point and passage which is to me over strayt and hard to grant / that is
that I should forsake my gods / by whom I govern me for to adoure one only
god of whom thou have spoken to me demand of me some other thing and with
good heart I shall do it / Clotildis a^suerd as much as is possible to me to
requyer I supplye and byseche the that thou will adoure the god of heaven maker
of al / to whom only is due al honor / the king made none other ansuer / but
sent anon Aurelyen his fa^tour to agabondus for to have the goods longyng to
the queen Clotildis / and when Aurelyen had done his message / Agabondus
replenysshed with great Ire a^suerd to the messager / that he should as soon
have all his royame as any thing of him / For which cause Aurelyen said to him
/ the king cl^ys my master comau^deth the by me that thou make an answer upon
my demand / or else he shall be evil content Then the bourgoynons helden
a counceyl / and said to agabondus their king / Sir king give to your nyece of
your goods as reason will / for it is right / And we k^owe well that so ought ye
to do / and to take playsyr to have good a^yaunces with clois the king / and
with all the frensshe people / to the end that they ^^nne not on us / For the
people is boystous and furious / and that work is / without mind of god And
upon this point Agabondus constrained to the counceyl of the bourgoynons his
people sent a great party of his tresour to Aurelyen the messager of king
Cloys / In a litel time after the king cloys in vysityng his royame / The queen
clotyldis was anon great with child and sone after was delyuerd of a sone /
whom she did do baptyse And contynuelly required the king that he would believe
as tofore is said / but he in no wise would here her ne do thereafter / And when
the child was baptized / anon it exspyred and deyed / whereof the king was
evil content and said to the queen if thou had given him and dedyed him to
my gods / he were now olyue / The queen an swerd for this thing I am no
thing perturbled in my courage but I render and give tha^kynges to god my
creator by cause he has me so dygne and worthy / that it ha^h plesed him to
take in to his royalme of heaven the first fruit of my womb / After the year
following she had ageyn another sone named lodomyrus the which when he was
baptized bycame anon so seek / that it was supposed he should deye / And when
the king saw it languysshe / he being evil content said to the queen / and
how said he / it shall none otherwise be of this child / but as it was of that
other his brother by cause against mine entente thou do thy will in baptysyng
them / Then the queen for the fere of the ^yng prayed to god deuoutely for
the health of her child And anon he was guarysshed and hool /

How the king Cloys was vyctoryous of his enemies by canse he byleued in Ihesu
Christ Capitulo iiij
King Cloys after certain time began to make war mortal against the Almayns /
And so perseueryng the all mayns had vyctorye on the frensshe men in such
wise that they were overthrown and slain Then when aurelyen saw the
dystructyon of the kings people he began to behold the king his lord and said
to him / Sir king ye see tofore your eyes the mortal destructyon of your people
/ I require you that ye believe in god almighty / which has made heaven and
earth / I mean him whom my lady the queen adoureth / precheth and byleueth on
/ when the king had herd aurelyen thus speken in great affectyon / he began to
lift his eyes unto heaven and wept much largely / and with great pity thus
said / O Ihesu christ sone of the very god almighty on whom my wife by leueth /
and with al her heart precheth / and notyfyeth him to give remedy to them that been in trybulacyons / I byseche the of aid and socour / that I may be
vyctoryous of mine enemies by experyence / presently I byleueue on the / and in
thy name I shall baptyse me / I have demanded my gods for to help me / but
they have done no thing for me And I say they be of no value ne of no
comfort when they may not help them that require them / wherefore to the as
very god and lord I require the that I may be delyuerd by thy hye puyssaunce
fro mine aduers^ryes / he thus saying with an high voys / The allemayns his
enemies vaynquysshed and murdered began to flee in such wise that their king
was deed / wherefore / they that abode yielded them to king cloys / and by^men
his subgettes / and set all that contreye under his obayssaunce and puyssaunce
pa^eng yearly trybute / Then after this vyctory by the puyssaunce of god
obtained / he came in to france / And recounted all to the queen his wife how
by Inuocacion dyuyne and by thayde of god almighty he had obtained vyctorye /

How the king was baptized by saint Remyge / and in his baptesme by miracle was
brou the holy ampulle by an aungel fro heaven / whereof ever after all the kings
of France ^^^^^noynted in their consecr^cyon at cite of Raynes cap^^ulo v
AFter that the (...) herd the king which was converted unto the christian
faith for the vyctorye which he had obtained she had great Joy / And
Incontynet sent after saint Remyge bishop of raynes a much holy man / which
came to her for to prech to the king his salvation and he maner^ of the christian
faith / and when he was comen / after that he had well informed the king began
strongely to excyte the people of france to believe in Ihesu Christ / And the
people gaynsayed it not / For in knowing the error of thydolles they began al
to believe in god and say / Sir king glorious it is best that ye forsake
thydolles / and adoure the god Inmortal / whom the queen adoureth and preyseth
/ and so for to do / all we be content / Incontinent all this was showed to
saint Remyge / whereof he was much Joyous / and came to them dylygently / as a
good herdman that takes great pain to keep the sheep fro his aduersarye / and
great playsyr ought he to have to come thither / For his coming and his prechyng
did so great prouffyte that it made the people to be regenerate after
thordynaunce of holy baptesme / without which no man may enter in to heaven /
wherefore the necessyte of the salvation of this king enlumyned of grace
dysposed to believe conjoined to good entencyon maad affectuously saint ^emyge
to come / for he thought well when the king was baptized and byleued in Ihesu
christ and his commandments / that all the people subgette to him should do the
same wise And when saint remyge was comen / and had co^myned with the king /
touching his salvation / began to ordeyne the place for to baptyse him
honorably and did to ^ynte the hystoryes after sum points of our christian
faith much rychely and repaired the places right delycyously / And on that
other he did do ordeyne and found chirches aute^tykly and compose
baptyzatoryes and fun^es co^uenably when all this was done y^ king was al ready
to receive the holy sacrament of baptesme / to whom the friend of god saint
remyge began to say by faconde manner Sir king it is time that ye ought with
pure entencyon to forsake the false gods to whom tofore this time ye have
given faith / And then the king was al ready to receive the holy sacrament of
taptesme / To whom Saint Remyge began by fair manner / Sir king it is time that
ye ought of pure Intencion to forsake the gods / to whom here before time ye
have byleued on / which ben full of al vanyte and do no thing but excersi^e of
dampnacyon / And ye ought to believe with ryt humble heart in one only god
almighty / the fader the sone and the holy ghoost one only and pure essence
which has created heaven and earth / to whom one only out to give faith and
creaunce / and in Ihesu christ his sone which for the sauacyon of humayn
creature would take humanyte couenable for to repair thynobedyence of our first
fader Adam / And that was conceived in the belly of the virgyn marie by the werk
of the holy ghoost / which after was set on the cross / and took death
dolorously for to redeem us was buried and roos fro death to life / and after
ascended in to heaven and sytteth upon the right hand of the fader / and fro
thens shall come and Judge the living and deed /

Also ye shall believe in holy church our catholyque mother and her ordonnayre /
and when saint Remyge had enough informed the king and the people of our faith
and believe / he baptized them in the name of the fader and of the sone and of
the holy ghoost And when he came to enoyntyng after the custom of the holy
cresme / which no man brought Incontinent / by the plesyr of god and
demonstraunce myraculous they all stondy^g sodeynlye came down descendyng fro
heaven a dou^e shynyng which bare in her beck an holy ampull / and left it in
the same place where the holy cresme was wherwyth the king cloys was first
enoynted in great devotion by Saint Remyge / which Ampull is presently at
Raynes / of which holy cresme that is therein / the kings of france onely^
been enoynted ones in their consecracyon / In that time were baptized the
systers of the said king and thee thousand men of his excersyte / and so after
all the people of france in great Joy and exaltacion of glory /

The second party of the first book conteyneth five chapytres / and speaks of
the beginning of king Pepyn / And Charlemayn his sone
How Pepyn by his (...) was chosen king of F^aunce when the lygnage of king
cloys faylled in successy^^^ j
THe book ^^^^dent makes m^ncyon of king Cloys / the first christian king of
the lords of France of whom the ^^gnage succeeded from heir to ^yres unto
the four and twenty king which was the king ^^epyn of another lygnage / And
the king which was the xxiij after the king Cloys and of his ^gnage was named
hild^^us / the which being devout and contempletyf without cure to excersyse
thoffyce royal of a king / put him self in relygyon for to lead a solytarye
life / In that time was Pepyn much valiant of his person and much noble
pryn^e / And by cause that all the kings of france have succeeded of this
said Pepyn / and in especial charlemayn his sone upon whom this work is
comprysed / I will here begin to treat the matter / the which I entende
superfycially to speak of And like as the book which is called myrrour
hystoryal compryseth / That Pepyn the prince on a ty^e sent his messagers to
Rome to the Pope zacharye for to have answer upon a demand / That is to wete
whether is he more worthy to be a king or to be said a king whihe for pe^s and
parfyght union takes on him great pain and trauaylle / or else he that
retcheth of no thing and is abandonned and given to all sloth and is only
content to have the name only of king / when the pope had herd this demand
he remaunded to Pepyn / that he by right reason and very equity ought to be
called a king that governs and rules his fayt for the common well and
contynueth it / For which ansuer and demand the Frensshe men by c^unceyl
approuued / considered their king hyldrycus professed in a monasterye in life
solytarye and contemplatyf / And that not wythstondyng ought not to be any
thing against them that lyuen solytaryly / how well a king ought not to be
solytarye / For such as is the King such is the Royame / For salamon says if
the king be neclyge^t / the people wot not what to do / And blessed is the
land that has a prince noble / All the frensshe men being well informed of
the condycions apperteynyng to a king / after an auctour that says thus / The
Prince when he is ordained ought not to have horses superfluous ne make his
people more subgette than they ought to be / and ought not to take but
servants propyce and necessary without superfluyte / and not to nourysshe
over many hounds ne other beestes vnprouffytable / but take them in mesure /
And he should eschew multyplycacyon of menys^rellys / Tabouryns / commyn wymmen
lecherous men / And he should not corrupt his subgettes by evil exaumple / He
should not break his espousaylles / he should gladly read in books / and should
have by him people well letterd / And should Judge without favor / And tofore al
things he should adoure and serve god / he should not gladly take yeftes and
ought not gladly to ch^u^ge his officers / All this thing well seen emonge
them for the conseruacion of the people emonge the myscreau^tes which were at
that time went and chosen for to be king of France the noble Pepyn / and fro
that time forthon the lygnage of king cloys reigned no more upon the frensshe men
/ And he was consecrate by saint Boneface / And by thauctoryte apostolyque /
and by Saint Stephen Pope with his ij sons Charlemayn / and charles the great
was confermed and approuued and ordained all the kings of france in great
ben^dyction to succeed fro lygnage to lygnage most next / And the said pope
gaf his maledyction to al them that were opposaunts and against these things
aforesaid /

Then after this noble king Pepyn made great war to the english men / And
after the guyse Romayn he ordained the service in the chyrches of france and
many other matters meruayllous / whereof thonour is attrybuted by good right to
him by vyctorye obtained / and was buried in the church of Saint Denis in
France / And left his heirs his two sons before said whom he had gotten on
the noble queen berte daughter of the great Herclyn Cezar of whom the lignage
of romans of germayns / and of the greeks have had concurrence / wherefore by
good right in time following the king Charles was chosen and maad Emperor of
Rome / And the said King Pepyn reigned xviij year in prosperyte dygne of
salvation / and after that the brother of the said Charles had reigned in his
party of the royame ij year he deyed And then after all the government
hoolly of the royame of france abode to the said charles / as here after /
shall be more plainly showed /

Of king Charles after that he had maad many constytucyons with the Pope Adryan
/ and how he was emperor of Rome capitulo ij
This noble Charlemayn otherwise called Charles the great / the which for the
gretenes of his body / puyssaunce and opperacions virtuouses by merit is
called great as I have said / which after the death of his brother he was only
king of France / A little while after that the Pope adryan reigned and did great
dyligence to strength and corobere the christian faith / in annullyng the
heresies and constytutyng images for representacyon of saints in chyrches /
And to many other labors merytoryes adjoined in the service of god and of holy
church / The king charles against the mysereauntes tarried not to confound them
/ but had vyctorye of them in dyners manners / and the pope adryan which was
well informed that this Charles was a strong pyler of the church and
protector of the faith sent for him that he should come to Rome / And when he
came to pauye there he tarried and set his syege and soiourned a little time /
And after with a few of his people departed and came to rome / And there he
was received affectuously / and vysyted many places deuoutelye / And after when
he returned he took pauye / And when he had all done his playsyr he returned to
Rome / And with the Pope adryan he assembled many bysshoppes and abbottes the
nombre of an hundred and liij / where they ordained many constytucyons upon the
fayt of the universal church / And in that synod for the great holiness of
charles / The pope and al thassystentes gaf him power for to ordeyne bisshoppes
and archbisshops in all his contrees and prouynces / And al them that so shall be
ordained he shall conferme / and the rebellys that shall gaynsaye them / he shall
curse / and their goods be confysked / This noble charles with his two sons
that one named Pepyn / and that other ^^wys / And the xij pyeres of france
which al had promised fydelyte one to that other for to Ieoparde their life for
the christian faith / In that time many mortal wars during the life of king
Pepyn and of charles / and after that the royame of lombardye was destroyed and
delyuerd of the myscreauntes And maad pees not without great trauayll for to
come from france in to lombardye by cause of the dangerous country / when
all this was termyned to his playsyr / he reduced all ytalye under the
trybute of the royame of France / In such wise that when ytalye was thus
destroyed he went to Rome for to give thankynges and laud to god much
deuoutelye for vyctorye that he had and for execusyon done upon the enemies of
the faith / And there with the pope Adryan he maad many constytucyons / which
by ryt equity ought well to be observed / And after he being thus in Rome
vyctoryous / his sone Pepyn was ordained and consecrate king of the ytalyens /
And his sone lowys was ordained and consecrate king upon g^yan / this done the
Romans which of great ancyaunte were of great app^ete / after that the
emperor was by them put to death Constantyn his sone would have reigned for
emperor / which was not well in the favor of the senators and other Romans
/ the which being in this point after that they had taken delyberacyon of
great counceyl seeing the great valor and noblesse of king Charles / which
was so parfyght in all noblesse / hardynesse / prudence / and other virtues as
I shall touch herafter all plain / that by consent of eve rich he was
chosen emperor of Rome with great loange and exaltacyon of Joy Innumerable /
And by the hand of Pope Leo he was crowned emperor with all honors that
might be comprysed / And al with one voys gaf to him laud and honor / And
called him Cezar and August by a symylytude of valor in contemplacyon of great
playsyr that they had maad him king of ytalyens /

Of the corpulence of King Charles and of the manner of his living capitulo iij
CHarlemayn King of France after that he was Emperor ^e did many meruayllous
works / and reigned emperor thyrtene year / And had then reigned upon the
frensshe man xxxiij year And in the contye of Rome he edyfyed many cytees and
restored good towns and many other things which may not well be recou^ted by
cause of his merueyllous works / Nevertheless for to know what man he was his
works wytnessen as much as touches thexcercyte of his person / Turpyn the
holy man archebysshop of Raynes / which lived that time / and was often times in
the company of king Charles says that he was a man well faryng of his body and
great of person / and had his ^yght and regard fyers and malycyous / / The
length of his person contained eight feet after the mesure of his feet which
were merueyllously long fat and massyf was ^e of his sholdres and raynes
without having the belly otherwise than well a point / The arms and thyes he
had ample and la^ge / he was a subtyl knight and ryghtwyse actyf and much
fyers / and of all his members he was of right great strength / he had the
face deduyte in length / and his ^^^de was a foot long / he had his nose
raised upon a roundnes / A fair regard and countenance had this man / he had
the face of a large foot broad he had the eyes like a lion sparklyng like a
cole by furyous regard^ / his wynbrowes great / As Soon as he byhelde a man in
anger / each man had of him fere and dread in openyng his eyes The gyrdle of
which he was gyrde was viij foot long with out that / that henge down fro
the (...) to the pendaunt / when he took his ^^paast he was content with little
bread / but as touching the pytau^ce / he ete at his REpaast a quarter of moton
/ or ij ^^nnes / or a great ghoos / or a great pestel of porke / or a pecok /
or a crane / or an hare all hool / he drank wyn sobrely with a little water
therein / Of his strength is not a little thing to speak of / For he would smite
a knight armed with one stroke of a sword and cleue him from the coppe of the
head down to the sadel / And if he had between his hands iiij horse shoen with
out ouermoche prouyng his might / he would ryt them out and break them in
pyeces / And more over with one hand he would take a knight al armed and lift
him up to the heyght of his breast lightly / And he had in him three things
much honorable / First in yeftes yeuyng he was right large like unto Tytus
the emperor sone of vaspasyanus / which was so prodygal / that it was not
possible to him to give that / which he promised / And when it was demanded
why he promised thing / that he might not give forthwyth / he answered that a
person ought not depart fro a prince desolate ne heavy / nor with out to
obtain sum thing / Secondly Charles was so sure in Judgment that no man
could reprehende him / and also he was pyetous and mercyful unto christian men
after the qualyte of the person / and the occasyon of the trespaas / And
thyrdly in his words he was much well aduysed when he spoke / he thought
strongely on that he said / and when one spoke to him / he remembered the manner
for to compryse then tencyon of the spekar

To what thing king Charles his sone and his daughters were Instruct and
taught to do capitulo iiij
DAme bertrode mother of Charles full of great science in great prosperyte of life
and in honor wexed old and fynysshed her days / and ordained books for to
excersyse the arts lyberalle / Of whom first charles took gladly pain for to
estudye / And in the time of Infancye he maad science to be taught to his sons
and daughters / and after when they knew their believe he made them to study
in the seven arts lyberal / And when the sons were of age for to ride on
horsback after the guyse of France he made them to fere arms and to Just for
texcersyle the war when it should be need / and when they did not that / he
made them to hunte of manner wild beestes and did them to do other of batements
longyng to chyualrye contynuelly / After this he made his daughters to spynne
and sow and to occupye them in other honorable works (...) the end that by
ydlenes and slouthe and fault of occupacyon they should not have occasyon to
fall in thout dysordynate for to have Inclynacyon to sin and vice / and when
he was not occupied in matters of charge and weyghty he would employe his time in
writing sum new thing to the end that he would not be idle acoordyng to the
pystle of saint poule which admonesteth us to do always sum good / by cause
yt out enemy the fond hold us not in ydlenes for to follow his entencyon
dampnable / And he did do make in his polays in Acon in Almayn a church of our
lady comprysed of meruayllous beauty / and much rychely ordained and wrought
and in great honor enhaunced in sign of a parfyght christian man / For after
that one loves the lord / and that is given to him the works desirous to meue
other to do to the bard like as him self / and in like wise should persevere in
the amplyfycacyon of his contreye / that sithe the death of his fader Pepyn be
doubled by puyssau^ce in the royame of france /

Of the study of king charles / of his living / of his charytable works and
other matters capitulo v
AFter that Charles was Instruct in gram ire other scyences ^^^pased and
speculatyf always be continued in them / And by ardour desire frequented the
books (...) upon the christian faith / for to be protector and defer (...) of
the church / the which is vysyted on mornings and on euenes and in the night
ofty^es and of good festes be faylled not to do gretely his deuoyr in
sacrifyses and oblacions / And also gaf largely alms for the leave of god and
was always ready to socour the pour people in the largest wise / For he socoured
not only the pour folk of his own^ contreye with his hauoyr and goods but
in many other places beyo^de the sea he sent gold and silver and vytayll
after the necessyte of the place as in surrye in egypt in affrique in
Iherusalem and other contreyes as he that said / gold and silver is not mine /
To every man he desired amytye and pees / Of body he was much ample and
boystous / of stature well apparysaunt / the coppe of his heed round / the
heeres in great reverence and the vysage Joyous / he had the boys clear and of
great force / and at his souper he ete not for the most part sauf roasted
veneson which above all other flesh he loved and used at his souper /
Always he loved redars for to read chronicles or other things contemplatyues /
as he that would as well feed the soul which is perpetuel / of spyrituel fode
for to mayntene it in union of grace toward god his maker / as of refeccyon of
the body for to conserve the life / And emonge al other books he delyted
strongely in the books of saint austyn especyally in that which is named de
ciuitate dei / and he dra^ke not over often / For at souper he drank not but
three times / In somer time gladly after mydday he would ete a little faiyt and
drink ones / and would goo rest him al naked in his bed two or three hours
/ In the night he brake his sleep four or v times and walked in his chamber /
Thus Charles preseuerd in felicyte ryal and emperyal / and sent oueral thorugh
his empire his messagers and great counceylllours for to vysyte his prouynces
and good towns for to be informed of the gouernoure of them for to do to
eueriche Justice and reason / and made many constytucyons and laws according to
the places / and commanded them to be observed and kept upon great pain /
Semblably the said Charles sent thorugh all the world for to know over all the
government / That is to wete for do know the meruayllous faytes that were
done in the world / And also for to learn the life of saints / of whom the
festes were hallowed / and made of them books for tabyde in eternal memory /
and every day he did do put in writing that which he did / In such manner
that after the writing that he then fond / were found more than three
hundred festes of saints one time of the year / wherefore he excersycyng his
spyrituel works / he was byloued and dear reputed of every body / In that time
Aaron the king of perce for the magnyfycence of charles sent to him an
Olyphaunt merueyllously great for a synguler yefte and many other things
precyouses / This Charles for his great holiness and no bless was in such
renommce of honor and of vertures / On a time aaron the king of Perse sent to
him emonge other yeftes the bodies of saint Cypryan and of saint speratus / and
the heed of saint Panthaleon marters / in to France /

The third part of the first book conteyneth three chapytres / and speaks how
by reuelacion deuyne Charles defyuerd the holy land fro the hand of the
paynyms /
How the patryorke of Iherusalem sent to Charles for socours / after that he
was deiecte and cast out of the Turks capitulo primo
IT is read / that in the time that charles was emperor of rome / the
patryarke of Iherusalem was so oppressyd of the paynyms by mortal war that
uneath he might save him self / And thus when he knew no more what to do / He
had in remembrance the noble charles / and he being en formed of his holiness /
for socour he sent to him the keys of the holy sepulcre of our lord Ihesu
Christ of Caluarye and of the cite / And with that he sent to him the standart
of the faith as to the pyler of crystente and deffendour of holy church /
After this the patryarke came to constantynoble unto the emperor constantyn and
to his sone Leo / and brought with him Johan of naples priest and another
which named him self Dauyd are^^pr^est / whom the emperor Constantyn sent
incontinent to charles / And with them tweyne ^e ordained for to goo with them
two other which were named ysaac and Samuel / and delyuerd to them a lettre
wryton with his own hand for to bear to char^les / And the said Constantyn
had wryton in one part of the lettre thus / On a night me s^^med that I saw
tofore my bed a young woman much fair stendyng right up which tou^^ed me
softly and said to me (...) sweet words / Co^stantyn when thou knew
thaffayre and (...) of the paynyms which ho^de^ the holy land / by gret^
af^ectyon thou have prayed ^od for to have help / ^o what ^^ou shalhe do /
Pourchace that ^^ou may have with the charles the great king of the gallyens
which is protector of holy crystente and defendour of holy chyr^^^ / And after
the same lady showed me a knight armed in all his body and spores on his bele^ /
and had his shield read / gyrde with his sword / and had his sleue of purple
and held a spear much great / And the heed of iron which was on hye / cast
in to the air great flambes of fire / and he held in his ho^de a bacynet al
of gold shynyng / and he was ancient with a long herd right fair of vysage
and long of body / he had eyes shynyng as ij sterres / and his heerys began to
wexe white / and after was wryton O thou August that never refusest the
comandements of god enjoy the in Ihesu Christ / and in thy mind always yield
to him thankynges be enclosed in Justice / like as thou have be reclamed in
honor / Ihesu Christ give the grace to preseuere and keep always the
commandments of god as thou ought to do feemely / And as it is wryton
the emperor Constantyn in his time had dejected the paynyms out of Iherusalem
seven times wherefore when he myt no more he sent his messagers to king Charles
/ which at that time was at paris / And when the messagers had presented the
letters and he had seen them / he began to weep much grievously in
contemplacyon of pity of the holy sepulcre of our lord so holden of the paynyms
/ After this he sent for tharchebysshop Turpyn / and maad him to preche
openly the pyteous tidings which were then presentlye comen the which well
herd and understood / the people all generally were enclyned to goo thither /

How charles with a great company went for to conquer the holy land and
many other matters capitulo ij
AFter that this which I have tofore said was publysshed / The king did do
make an edyct / and did do cry it thorugh out all the contreye that every man
that myt ^ere arms should be ready for to goo with him against the paynyms / and
he that would not come should be bound for a good so^me of money for to hyre
souldyours that should goo / This done was never seen tofore in so little time so
much people assembled as then were founden / And when they were al departed
in the name of god full of one great faith / in great hope to obtain vyctorye
under the conduyte of Charlemayn captain of the faith / And when they had
ryden a great long way / they came in to a great wode of buscage / in which
they might not pass uneath in two days and yet with great pain / and
Charles thought to pass it in one day / wherefore he and his host entered
within the said wood which was full of diverse wild beestes / as Gryffons /
beres / lions / Tygres / and other beestes wha^ they were thus in that great
wode / and the night came on / they were al abashed and troubled without
knowing which way they should hold / And Charles commanded that they should
look if they might see or know any habytacyon / but they were far fro any
and out of their right way / and by force were driven to dyspose them to
sleep in that estate / And when they were al in rest the king charles being in
his dormytorye trustyng of the aid of our lord in great devotion began to say
the psaulter / And when he came to the point that he should say the verse
foloyng / Deduc me domine in semita mandatorum tuore quiaipa^m bolui / he sayng
this there came a bird to his ere in the presence of eueriche that were about
him which said with an hye voys / king thyn oryson is herd Then all they
that were present were much troubled / and not wythstondyng al this / the
king continued to say the psaulter unto Educ me do custodia animam meam / and
all thus while he said the byrd began more strongely to cry and say / O
frensshe man what say thou / O frensshe man what say thou And after that
the king and his company went and followed the bird which conduyted them
unto the right wayr which they had lost the day to fore / and sum of the
pylgryms said that after in the same contreye were such birds so doing But
when charles and his great puyssaunce were nyghe their enemies they were much
troubled of their coming / and the christian lords were gretely reioysed of
their coming / For without cessyng he rested not till that he had trcouerd the
contreye of christian men / and expelled all the paynyms which much redounded
to him great honor and vyctorye / And in retournyng he demanded of the emperor
of Constantynoble license to depart: of the other patryarkes and archeperestes
/ And thempe^^ur held him an hole day / And for remuneracyon the said emperor
for thonour of king ^^arles on the morn tofore the yates of the cite did do
ordey^^ many bestes of diverse mane^s and diverse colors / and great quantyte of
gold and silver and of precious stones / to the end that he should take it for
so^me reward for the great good that he had done in their contreye. But as soon
as charles knew thereof / he took counceyll of his people what (...) ought to
do in taking of the precious and rich yeftes / or to return in to france
without taking of any thing / And there upon his barons cou^ceilled him that he
should take no thing for his labor For he had done no thing but for the love
of god only / And he being well content of this ansuer / commanded that no
person upon great pain should take no thing of the Iewellys aforesaid /

Of the relyques that the emperor charles brought fro constantynoble and fro the
holy land and of the miracles that were do in capitulo iij
When the emperor of constantynople and the patryarke of Iherusalem knew that
charles would take no thing of the good aforsayd he was admonested that he
should take somewhat of them / and when he was thus constrained / he by sought
them that for the love of god / might be given unto him somewhat of the relyques
of our lord and of his holy passion / when this was demanded / It was
commanded to fast every man three days for to be the more enclyned to devotion
/ and for to vysyte the holy relics / and in especyall were ordained xij
persons by grace / which should treat and see the relyques / when it come to
the third day the noble Charles by great conteycyon confessyd him to
tharchebysshop Turpyn / After that much ruue rently they began to sing the
letanye with sum psalms of the psaulter / And there was the pr^late of
naples named danyel / which in great reverence opened the coffre wherein was
the precious crown of Ihesu Christ and there sprange out of the same so great
an odor / that all they that were present thought to be in paradys / Then
charles full of hool and very creaunce of faith parfyght by contemplacyon kneled
down to the ground and strat^hed him on therthe and much strongely prayed our
lord that for the glory of his name persently would renew the miracles of his
holy passion and glorious rosurrexyon / and as soon as he had prayed / in a
moment the crown began to florysshe / and a meruayllous sweet odor issued out
of the flowers so ryt delycyous that each man supposed that his vestementes
and clothyng had comen out of heaven Then after this daniel took a sharp
knyf kuttyng well puryfyed to cut the said crown and in cuttyng always more
and more the said crown flourysshed and the odor smellyd the more habundantly
/ And of the flowers charles put a part in a reposytorye / and in a little
coffre he put the thorns of the crown and wept so habundantlye that when he
wend to have given to tharchebysshop Ebroin the flowers he wythdrewe his hand
and supposed that the said Ebroin had holden them in his hand / and they were
in the air houyng by miracle / and abode there by them self the space of a
great hour / And after when he had given in keeping the said thorns to the
said Ebroin / he saw the ooffret in thayer which was full of floure^ / which
abode there by them self / which sone after were converted in to manna / and
in that manner they berpat Saint Denis in france / And it has be the oppynyon
of many / that this was of the ma^na that god sent in to deserte to his people
/ Then were there showed miracles / For all seek people that were there
present were heled of al their maladyes by the odor of the flowers aforesaid /
and the people that entered in to the church by great vyolence of press of
people cried / verytably that day was a day of health and resurrection / for by
the savor of the mellyfluous flowers all the cytee was puryfyed and
replenysshed of grace / for three hundred and one seek man by compte were heled

restored to his speech / After this the said danyel took a nayll / of which the
percyous body of our lord in his passion had be perced / and in great reverence
was put for a relque in alabast^e / and in taking out of it / a child was
heled / which of his left side was dry and Impotent fro his birth / and he
ran hastelye to the church / and cried at the hour of none / and said that

Here begins the ij book of this present work / which conteyneth three
parties by chapytres following declared
The first party of the second book conteyneth xvj chapytres and speaks of
the bitayll done by Olyuer / and Fyerabras a meruayllous geaunte /
How in a place which was called mormyonde charles abode following the war
against the paynems / after a little prologue
The first chapter
I Have spoken tofore in the first book superfycyally of the first king of
france baptized / in descendyng after my purpoos unto King charles / of whom
may not well be recou^ted the valyau^ce of him and of his barons / which were
named and called pyeres of france Of whom and of their behauyng I shall make
mention after that I shall mow co^ceyue by truth but this that I have tofore
wryton / I have taken it out of an autentyke book named myrrour hystoryal /
and in ancient chronicles / And have only translated them out of latin in to
frensshe / And the matter following which shall be the second book is of a
Romaunce maad of thauncyent facyon without great ordinance in frensshe /
whereof I have been encyted for to reduce in proof by chapytres ordained / which
book after so^me and most comunely is called Fyerabras / by cause that this
Fyerabras was so meruayllous a geaunte as I shall make mencyon / which was
vaynquysshed by Olyuer / And at the last baptized / and was after a Saint in
heaven / And in effect it speaks of that bataylle / and of the relyques
conquered which had been taken at rome / and were in the puyssaunce of the
admyrall which was fader of fyerabras wherefore in this book following I ne
entende but only to reduce thauncyent ryme in to proof / and to deuyde the
matter by chapytres in the best ordinance that I shall conne / without to
adiouste any thing that I have not found in the book competent / and in like
wise as I shall find / I shall reduce / And this book is applied to thonour of
Olyuer one party / Not wythstondyng that there been many other matters / For I
suppose that of eueriche of the barons pryncypal of the emperor Charles / which
been said comynly in nombre xjj or xiij / and pyeres of France which were
capytaynes of thexcercyte and much strong and valyaunte of their persons /
and were great lords and noble / But of the lords valyaunte capytaynes were
more than xiii after that I find / First there was rolland Earl of Cenonia
sone of myllon earl / and of dame berthe proper sister of king Charles / After
him was Olyuer Earl / sone of Reyner of gennes / which Reyner was also at
thexcersyte of king charles / After him Rychard of Normandye / Garyn duck of
Lorayn / Geffroy lord of bourdeloys / Hoel Earl of Nau^tes / Ogyer the danois
king of denmark / Lamberd prince of bruxellys / Naymes Duke of bauyer / Thiery
duc of ardanne Basyn of beneuoys / Guye of bourgoyne / Caudeboy king of Fryse /
Ganellon which did the treson at the end of the iij book at rouncyuale /
Sampson duk of bourgoyne / Also there was Ryol du mauns Alory and guyllermet
the soot / and many other that were subgettes to Charles / And not wythstondyng
that they were not always w^^h him They that I have tofore ^amed were always
ready for to ^o his commandment / And the most part of them that I have
tofore named were with him ^^^ynuelly /

Of Fyerabras how (...) to excyte thexcersyte of C^^rles capitulo
THe admyral of spain named ballan a p^^nym much great and pu^ssau^t of body
and of people had a sone named Fyerabras / the most meruayllous geaunt that
ever was seen borne of mother / for of the gretenes and hugenes of his body /
and also of his strength to him was none like / the which was king of
Alexandrye and held under him the contree of babylone unto the read see / and
he was lord of roussye and of coulleygne / and more over under him was
Iherusalem / and retained the holy sepulcre of our lord Ihesu Christ a by his
great puyssau^ce entered on a time in to Rome / where he did much evil / and
bare away the holy crown of our lord / and the holy naylles and other
relyques enough / Of whom this book shall in the end recou^te how they were
recouerd / And he was called Fyerabras of alexandrye / which after that many
wars and bataylles were maad in Mormyonde between the paynyms and thexcersyte
of Charles / This fyerabras much dyssolute came rydyng by great furour for to
find so^me christian man for to fight against him / and came unto the lyces of
King Charles much furyous and eschauffed / as he should fight al armed and well
fournysshed of wepen / and was right evil content / that he fond no person
to whom he might fight / and nygh unto the lyces he went to behold the arms
af the emperor charles which were of the aygle shynyng / And he swear by
Mahommet his god and by his myt that he would never depart / till he had
foughten and made battle to sum christian man / And he seeing that no man came
to him began to crpe with an hye voys O king of Paris coward with out
hardynesse send to Just against me sum of thy barons of france / the most
strong and the most hardy / as Rolland olyuer Thyer^y or ogyer the danoys /
and I swear to the by my god Mahon that I shall not refuse unto the nombre of vj
or vij / that they shall be received of me / and if thou make to me reffuse of
this that I of the demand / I promise the / that tofore or it be nyt thou
shall of me be assaylled and dyscomfyted / and I shall smite of thy heed as
meschaunt without any fayllyng / and after I shall led with me Rolland and
Olyuer unhappy meschaunt and caytyfs / For oultragyously and folyly as evil and
old / have enprysed to come iij to this contreye / wherfro thou shall have
cause hastily to depart / These words or semblable spoken Fyerabras went him
unto the shadow of a tree and lay there and dysarmed him of the arms of
which he was cladde / and bond his horse unto a tree / and when he was thus at
his ease / he began to cry with an hye voys / o charlemayn king of Paris where
art thou now / whom I have this day so often called / without more longer
delay / send to Just against me rolland or Olyuer / of whom thou make so
great count and been so valyaunte / or ogyer the danoys whom I have herd
preysed / And if perauenture one of them dare not come allone / hardyly late
come the two or three or four of the most valyauntest and that they be
courageous hardy and well armed / And if the four dare not come late come five /
For unto the nombre of vi of the most valyauntest of thyn excersyte I shall not
refuse And I think not to return till they be confused and destroyed by me /
for be ye sure that it shall never be to me reproach that I be fugytyf for any
frensshe man living I have here tofore put to death by the valyaunce of my
person ten kings of great puyssaunce / and that they could not resyste
against my strength in no wise /

How Rychard if Normandye said to Charles what manner man Fyerabras was ca iij
As Soon as fyerabras had fynysshed his words the Emperor Charles / which well
had herd him / meruaylled much of his langage / And demanded Rychard of
Normandye what was that Turk that so had cried with so hye a voys upon the
valyaunce of his person / For king Charles said I have well herkened what he
has said that he shall not fail to fight against vj of the most valyauntest of
mine excersyte / To whom Rychard Duke of normandye ansuerd / Sir king this is a
man meruayllous / rich / and one of the strengest borne of mother / And he is a
sarasyn of so great fyerste / that he ne preyseth king ne earl ne none other
person of the worl^ /

When Charles understood him he began to clawe his ^eed And swear by Saint
De^ys of france that he should not ete ne never drink till one of the pyeres of
france should goo Just against him / And demanded of Rychard of Normandye how
this Popnyt / was named /

Rychard answered sir Emperor his paynym names him self Fyerabras / Which is
much to redoubte / and has done much harm or christian men / He has slain
the Pope / hanged abbottes monks and nonnes / and has deffuled chyrches /

And he has robbed and taken away the holy crown of but lord and many other
rely^ues for whom ye take great pain And he holds Iherusalem in great
subgectyon / And the holy sepulcre wherein god was buried / whereupon Charles
ansuerd of this that thou have said to me I am more a^gry than I was but know
thou for certain I shall never have Joy till that my desire be accomplysshed
and that he be vaynquysshed / And of that fayt all the frensshe men were
commoeued and troubled And there was not one that presented him for to goo to
him / And when charles saw that no person was of courage for to goo and
fight against this geaunt Fyerabras / He said to Rolland / My dear neuewe I
pray the that thou dyspose the for tassaylle this turk / and that thou do
there thy deuoyr /

Of the answer of Roulland to the Emperor sodeynlye / and what it was capitulo
iiij
When the emperor Charles had spoken thus curtoysly unto his neuewe Rolland /
Folyly and without reason Rolland answered him thus / Fayt uncle speak never to
me thereof / For I had lever that ye were confused and dysmembred / than I should
take arms or horse for to Just like as ye say / For on the last day that we
were so nyghe taken of the paynyms / that is to say of moo than fyfty thousand
/ we young knights bare the burden / and suffered many mortal strokes / of
which olyuer my fellow is quasi hurt unto the death / For if ye had not be
socoured of us the hole destructyon had been of us and the end / and when we
repaired and were in our lodgys for to take rest at even / when ye were well
dronken ye maad auaunte openly / that the old and ancient knygytes which ye
had brout with you for to aid us had much better borne them in the fayt of
arms / and had more strong bataylle than the young knights / And every man
knows well / how I was that euenyng affebled and weary of trauaylle that I took
in that day / And by my faders soul that was evil said of you / And now it
shall be known how the old and ancient knights shall bear them / for by god
which ought to have al in his subgectyon there is no young man in my company
that ever shall be in my favor and love if he take upon him to Just against
the Paynym / Also sone as Roulland had spoken that word / The Emperor his uncle
having much Iudignacio^ thereat smote him thwarte the vysage with his right
gannteto^ that his nose breast a blood habundauntly of the stroke / Then
Roulland in a great furye set hand on his sword when he saw his blood /
and had smeton his uncle if he had not be let by them that were present And
when Charles saw then tencyon of Roullaud he was meruayllously abashed and
said O god of heaven who would have thought that I should have had vylonye of
Rolland my neuew which been knytte to gyder in one faith against our
adversaries / And he comes rennyng against me with affectyon mortal / He that
is most next of my blood and lignage that here is present / And that more
sonner should s^coure me than any other / Now I beseech God that on the cross
suffered passion / that this day he be punysshed as he is worthy / And this said
in a great furour he commanded the frensshe men and said to them anon take ye
him / for I shall never ete till he be delyuerd to death / when the frensshe men
understood the commaundemnt of Charles for to have accomplysshed it / that one
looked upon that other for to see who would set first hand upon him / And when
Roulland saw the fayt he withdrewe him a litel a part with his sword in his
hand cryeng with an high voys and saying to them / if ye be wise / hold
you stylle / For I make a vow to god / that if any of you moeue to come to me
I shall make of his heed two parts / wherefore there was not one that durst ne
that was so hardy to meue against him in malice / but were right sorry and
evil content of their debate / and there upon the noble Ogier came swetelye
to Roulland and said to him / Sir Roulland me seems ye do not well for to
anger thus your uncle the emperor / who^^ by reason ye ought above all other
to love and defend / and also supporte / Roulland answered which then was
refrayned of his Ire / Sir Ogyer I promise you for a little fayt I was
determined to a great oultrage without aduys and enclyned whereof now I am sorry
and me repents /

How the king charles and Roulland been repreued by the anctour and somewhat
excused upon the debate aforesaid ca v
Upon the debate of them perour and Rolland his ^euewe I will a lytyl tarry and
spelle first to the king Charles / which haste be Iustuicte sith thyn Infancye
in all seyences full of manners digne of commemoracyon / which knew the
constaunce of the auncyents and the mutabylyte of the young people / why /
saydest thou on the euene / that the ancient and old knights in the war of
that day had borne them better tha^ the young knytes / And thou knew well
that Olyuer was gretely hurt by his valyaunce in such wise that he keeps his
bed / And also Rolland thy neuewe had borne the great burden of the bataylle
/ And if he had spoken folily / thou ought to have supported his first
moeuyng / which is not in the puyssaunce of a man / if thou had taken
aduys at the word that says / Vindictam differ donec pertranscat furor / That
is to say thou ought to dylate thy vengeance / till the furour be passed
Thou sholdest not have smyton Rolland / Sithe when he said evil it was without
aduys of great dyscrescyon / thou smotest him / semblably without aduys he
drew his sword against the And though thou had not smeton him thou
myghtest well have reprehe^ded him of his offense Thou ought to remember
ecclesyastes which says / Richilagas in operibus injury / when a man
receives wrong and Iniurye / it is not good that he do that which he may
do / And also it is when a person has well done his deuoyr / And of him of
whom he ought to have his thank and preysyng / is blamed / of so much the
more is he evil content and wroth For his fayt is reputed for naught / In
like wise was it of Rolland which thought more to have be allowed and preysed
for the great deuoyr that he did / than to here that the Emperor said / that
tholde knights had done better than the young / but now I will return to the /
O Rolland which have been so noble / Fro whens comes in the such audacyte to
speak against thyn uncle which has allwaye done so well to the / that his
works been worthy to be remembered / To him which is emperor / King of
France and lord of so great cremeur / and to thyn uncle as taken debate / and
ansuerd outrageously / was it not reason that thou ought to suffer him / and
he not the / if he smote the with his gauntelet by manner of correctyon /
ought thou to draw thy sword to him / Thou have not in rememberaunce the
obeyssaunce of ysaac which he had to his fader / thou were not aduysed of this
that thappostle says / ye yo^ge men keep your courage / And put not the furour
thereof in exersi^e if the Emperor for his dysporte preysed thauncyent knights
/ yet said he not / that thou had not done well / And Saint Poule says in
his epistle / that a man should not repreue him that is more au^cyent than him
self / but a man ought to entretene and supporte him as his fader / but the
deed is such that a person reputeth not an Iniurye to him said to be little /
ne if he be hurt that he be pacyent / wherefore it is good to think to for or
he speak it / And gladly to do ne say thing but if it be good /

How Olyuer was dysposed to fight against Fyerabras not wythstondyng that he
was hurt after many woedes capitulo vj
Much wroth was Charles with Rolland his neuewe / And said to his Peers of
France / Lords O how I am in diverse thoughts of my neuewe Rolland / which
would have Iniuryed my person / To whom I had more affyau^ce than to any man
living / I wot never whom I ought to love / Ne whom I ought to hate / And
yet furthermore I have no man now present for to Just against this Paynym /
that has challenged me / Then aroos up tofore him Naymes the Duc of bauyers
which said to the king Sir Emperor I pray you and require that ye leave these
words noyouses / All shall be well And another shall goo Just against the
sarasyn / But nevertheless the king was in great thought / For there was none
that would goo ne take it on him / Incontynente the tidings of the debate of
charles and Rolland were brought to Olyuer / which was in another place seek
in his bed / And also how Fyerabras was comen And that there was no person
present with the king for to Just against him / And hereupon the noble earl
Olyuer replenysshed with a noble courage and with an ardaunt desire for to
playse the king when he had herd these tidings aroos out of his bed / and
began for to stratche and strain his arms and to feel if it were possible to
him to bear arms /

And he thus dooyng his wou^des began newely to opene / that the blood sprange
out of the dystresse / And not wythstondyng all that as he that set not
much thereby /

For the great love and desire that he had to the king did do bind his wounds
the best wise he might / and after said to garin his squire that he should
bring him his arms / For he would arm him for to goo Just against the saresyn
/ To whom Garyn said sir Olyuer in thonour of god take pity of your own
person / For me thinks ye will willyngly slay your self Olyuer said to him to
my commandment / no man ought to tarry to seche his honor and auauncement
and renommee / And with good right I may employe my self for to serve my prince
and synguler lord / and sithe that I see that no frensshe man auaunceth him /
I shall not faylle at the point for the common proverb says / At need a man
knows his friend / Now anon bring to me mine arms without more taryeng And
so Olyuer did do arm him by the said Garyn his squire / which set on his
leg harnays / his hawberke / his helm and harnays necessary And when he was
all furnyshed he took his sword named hautrelere / the which sword he much
loved

After brought he him his horse the most special that he loved which was
named Ferraunt despaygne / And when he was brought tofore him all sadled and
brydled / The Ioly and gentyl Olyuer sprange in to the sadle / without setting
foot in the styrop / and set his shield at his ease / and in his hand a
mighty spear and sharp / which garyn took to him / And after smote the horse
with the spores so hard that in the leepyng he maad his horse to bow under him
/ It was a good sight to see Olyuer on horsback with a much fyers countenance
/ And they that were present bysought Ihesu Christ our redemar that he should
take him in his keeping For in that day he should fight against the most strong
and most fyers paynym that ever was born of mother / or ever was in this world
/ That is Fyerabras of Alexandrye sone of the admyral Ballant of spain / of
whom we shall see by the playsyr of god the termynacyon after / He being thus
on horsback in great point upon his vysage and upon his body he maad the sign
of the cross in the name of Ihesus / and commanded him self to the will of
god / which that day should be to him in comfort and aid after his good
entencyon / And of every man he was byseen and known that he had first hole in
his body for to do great feat of arms / and so rode forth unto the lyces of
the emperor Charles with whom was the Duc naymes / guyllam de scot / Gerard de
mondydyer and Ogyer the danoys with other barons of freunce / and emonge all
other there was Rolland much sorouful of the words that he had against his
uncle the king / for gladly he would have do the bataylle / if he had not
wythsayed if tofore the king when he was required / Thus Olyuer being seen
tofore Charles was much allowed and preysed of one and other / and much
affectuously byholden / And the said olyuer put down his helm and byhelde the
lodgyce of the king / And reverently came and salewed him / and after said to
him / Noble emperor puyssau^t redoubted and my synguler lord I beseech you to
here me / ye know Well that there ben iij years past that I have been in your
service and have had of you no reward ne wages / I you supplye with all mine
heart / that now ye will reward me with a yefte that I shall desire / To whom
the king ansuerd / Olyuer noble earl I assure to you by my faith that I shall do
it with a good will And as soon as we shall be in france / there is neither
cite to nigh ne castle that ye will have ne none other thing that to me is
possible and faysyble that shall be denied to you / Sir king said Olyuer I am
not comen to you for to demand such thing / But I demand and require of
you the bataylle ayenste the paynym so out of mesure / And at this houce I
grant to you all my goods and seruyces / and for this yefte to be quyte of
them when the frensshe men had herd Olyuer / they were all abashed of his
prowess / and each of them looked on other and said emonge them / A saint marie
what has Olyuer founden wyyche is hurt quasi to death / and will now goo to
fight and bataylle / O Olyuer answered charles thou have lost thy wit / For
thou know est well that with a spear heed square and sharp thou have be hurt
and wounded mortally and now thou wylt abandon^^ thy self to a gretter danger
mortal / beware / Return and take thy rest / For (...) well that for no
thing I shall suffer the to do that fayte / sythen that thou art not
presently in health of the body / Upon this point aroos ganellon and Andrewe
the traytres that did the (...) as the last look shall make mencyon / And
Oanellon said / Sir King ye have ordeygned in France / that it which by ij of
us is Iug^d ought to be holden / and so is it that we ij Judge and ordeyne that
Olyuer shall goo and do the bataylle / wherefore the king full of maltalente
with color changed answered / Ganellon thou art of evil dysposycyon Without
spekyng that which is honorable / Sithe it so is / he shall do the bataylle /
and it may none otherwise be / but that he be deed / But I swear to the my
troth that if he be taken or put to death / al gold of the world shall not save
the / but that thou shall dye a vylaynous death / and I shall destroy thy
lygnage / Sir Emperor said Ganellon god and our lady keep me / and after the
trayter said to him self secretly / God forbede that ever Olyuer return / but
that he have his heed smyton of / and when the emperor saw that he might not
gaynsaye but that olyuer should goo and the bataylle against Fyerabras / he said
I pray god of the fyrmamente give the grace to do well / and that thou may
return with Joy / And took his right glove and threw it to Olyuer / the
which he received with great desire and will in thankyng him right humbly /
and taking leave of al much swetely /

Hoth Olyuer was required by his fader reyner that he should not fight with the
geaunt / but for all that he went forth ca vij
When that Olyuer was lycenced for to goo do his bataylle and was ready to
depart Reyner of genes his fader came to the king and by great compassyon
kneled down at his feet and said / Sir king I cry you mercy hane pity of my
sotte and me / I say as for me / ye will al dyscomforte me when I see that my
sone gooth to perdycyon seeing the danger that his person is in / I say also
that ye take pity of his presumptuous yongthe / of his desire over covetous /
and of his body wounded dau^gerously / ye know well that a man that is hurt so
sore and that has lost of his blood may not well endure bataylle / But Reyner
lost his pain / For the king had given to him his glove in sign of license /
And not wythstondyng these words doubted no thing but that he should well do his
deuoyr and valyauntly / And yet ageyn reyner required the king and said / Sir
king in thonour of him that for us deyed on the cross / suffer not my sone to
Just Alas when I shall have lost my sone / where shall I become / and ye may well
find other for to take this bataylle in hand / Thempero ur Charles answered
Reyner ye know well that I may not gaynsaye that I have to him granted / For
in sign of lyce^ce I have given him my glove whereof Olyuer was content / and
then Olyuer said with an hye voys tofore all the people / Sir king / and
all ye barons I beseech you all of a yefte / that is that I require you if I
have mesprysed or mysdoon in deed or in word any against you / that in the name
of god ye pardo^ne me when the frenssh men herd him so speak / there was none
but that he wept tenderly / and so taking his leave with his standard raised /
The king blessed him in making the sign of the cross / And weeping comau^ded
him in the keeping of the fader of the sone and of the holy ghost /

How Olyuer spoke to Fyerabras / Which set no thing by him with other
disputacions capitulo viij
OLyuer departed and rode forth on his way and tarried not till that he came
where as fyerabras was / which was al unarmed and lay in the shadow / and
when Olyuer had aresonned him / The paynym turned his heed against him and
dayned uneath to look on him / For he setted naught by him / by cause he was
so little of stature to the regard of Fyerabras / And then Olyuer said to the
sarasyn / Awake thou / thou have this day so often called us that I am come
hither / And I pray the that thou tell to me thy name / Fyerabras ansuerd to
him / by Mahoun my god to whom I owe honor / I am the most rich man that is
in the world borne / Fyerabras of alexandrye am I named / I am be that thou
know that did do destroy rome your cite / and show the Pope and many other
/ and bare away the relyques that I there found / For which ye take great
pain and labor to receuer them / And furthermore and hold Iherusalem that
fair (...) and the sepulere in which your god rested / Olyuer ansuerd by my
faith I have gladl^ herd the say that which thou have said / And if it be
troth that thou have said / for certain now thou may repute thy self well
unhappy and myschaunt / Now without more ^^^kyng make the ready and (...) the /
see thou yonder the frensshe men that do no thing but byholde us / wherefore
depess^e the / For by the god on whom I believe / I shall smite the (...) as
thou lye^^ / when Fyerabras herd that he spoke so hardyly he began to lawhe /
and said I am well admeruaylled fro whens that comes to the such presum^on to
speak so has^yly / but for touch I shall not remeue fro hens till I know who
thou art and of what lygnage / And when thou have told to me thy name / thou
shall see me armed / Olyuer an suerd to him / O paynem know thou for truth /
that or it be night thou shall know what I am / by me sends to the charles
the Emperor my redoubted lord that for the consecracion of thy body and the
salvation of thy soul / thou leave the creaunce of thy god Mahoun and of other
ydolles which ben but abusyon and decrepcyon / which have neither wyt^^ ne
reason / ne feelyng ne good understanding / wherefore that thou enclyne the to
consent and think fro hens forth to believe in god almighty the holy Trynyte
the fader the sone and the holy ghoost iij persons in one essence / and of one
will which has made heaven and earth and all that there in dwells / which
for our salvation would be borne of the vyrgyn marie / and when thou shall have
this believe / with the holy sacrament of baptesme / which is upon this
establysshed thou may come to the glory eternal / and if thou do not like as
I have taught the I am here ready to do bataylle against the / and of two
things thou must do that one / First that thou depart out of this contree
as ouercomen and to here no thing with the / or thou must come and fight against
me / For tenhaunce thy body and to sustain thy falls land / Fyerabras answered
/ what someuer thou art^thon art over presumptuous to have intencyon for to
fight against me / For surely if thou see me on foot without arms thou shall
be well hardy if thou tremble not for dread to approach me / But by the god in
whom thou byleuest / Say to me what man is Charlemayn / For it is long sithe I
herd him first preysed and redoubted in many contrees / and also that I may
have tidings of rolland and Olyuer of Ogyer the danoys / and of gerarde de
mondydyer / For by my truth I would fayn be acqueynted with them / Olyuer
ansuerd Paynym upon that thou me demaundest / A tell to the that Charles
the emperor is so great a maystre that there is no man in the world may compare
to him / as well for the baluer of his person / of his counceyl / and of his
manners / as of his puyssaunce and rychesses Innumerable of regard / Of his
neuewe Rolland he is without pere / Olyuer little less than he / and as for
the other frensshe men / emonge al people humayn / they be balyaunte men / but
these words have no place here / depesshe the and arm the / For by the god
on whom I believe / if thou auaunce the not I shall smite the with this sword
of stele / Fyerabras began too lift up his heed and said / By my god maho^met
/ if I thought not that it should be my dishonor I should now smite of thy heed
Olyuer ansuerd I pray the leave this pletyng / For or it be even thou shall
know what I am / For certain I have entencyon to plunge my sword in thy belly
/ where upon Fyerabras was not wroth / so much noble was he / and rested his
heed upon his sheld / and said to Olyuer I se^^te not thereby / but I pray the
bell to me thy name and thy lygnage / Olyuer said to him my name is garyn and
can borne in perrogort sone of a man called Aosue / which came that other day
in to france / where I was adouted knight by the noble king Charles / and am
ordryned for to defend his right / and also to fight against the / wherefore
conclude without more taryeng and arm the and take thy horse / for I am ready
to do the bataylle / if thou be so hardy to abide me / Fyerabras would not
consent to the bataylle / For him thought that olyuer was to litel to Just
against him / and said to him / Garyn I demand of the wherefore is not comen
hither rolland ne Olyuer / or Gerard or Ogyer which been of so grede reno^mee
as I have herd say / Olyuer ansuerd / The cause wherefore they be not comen to
the / is for they set naught by the / and they have desdayn to come / but I
am comen to the as he that takes no regard to their intencyon / and shall do
the bataylle against the if thou wylt abide it / But I swear to the by saint
Petre the appostle of Ihesu Christ / that if thou arm the not I shall smite the
to the death with this darte that A hold in my hand / Garyn answered Fyerabras
I shall say to the that sithe I was adoubed knight A Iusted never but against a
king an earl on a baron of great valor / and thou art departed of a bow house /
for to say that I should have aded with the / it should be to me over great
dishonor if thou were put to death by me / but for the good will that I know
in the which is much noble / I am content that thou smite me and I shall fall
down to therthe / and take thou my horse and my shield and goo thou to king
Charles and say to him that thou have vaynquysshed me / And if I do this for
the I do to the great amytye / And thou oughtese for thye time to be content /
On which woods Olyuer could not have pacyence but that he said to him / Thy
sayt lies in noothynge but in words full of folysshe presumpsyon / I am of
this intencion / that before euensonge time I shall make thy head free from thy
sholdres / I am none hare ne wild be for to be aferde / And thou know
the common* proverb that says / that there is time of spekyng / and time of
being stylle / And of one and that other / one may be reputed a fool / now come
of and depesshe the / of that I have said to the / or else I shall slay the /
Frrwbras answered I desire ne pray the of no thing but that thou send to me
Rolland or olyuer / or one of the other knights of the round table / And if one
of them be not hardy for to come late come ij or iij or iiij attones For by me
they shall not be refused / In making these desputacyo^s / Olyuer which sore was
hurt the day to fore / his wounds opened by force of rydyng and of chauffyng
and bledde sore so that fyerabras saw the blood run down by is knee / And
demanded of him fro whens came that blood that so renneth down to therthe / I
trow thou be hurt Olyuer said I am not hurt / but my horse is hard at
spore whereof he is blody / Fyerabras beheld and saw it was not of the horse
and answered / Certes garyn thou say not sooth / for thou art hurt in thy
body and I know it well by the blood that comes down by thy knee / but see what
I shall do for the / there been two flagons hangyng on the sadle of my horse /
which been full of the bawme that I conquered iij Iherusalem / and it is the
same of which your god was enbawmed with when he was taken down fro the cross
and laid in his grave / hye the and goo drink thereof / and I promise to the
that Incontinent thou shalt be hole / and thene thou shall mow defend the
well without danger / Olyuer ansuerd that he would not / and that he said was
folly / Then fyerabras ansuerd that he was a fool without reason / And that
it might hap to repent him!

How after many dysputacyons Olyuer aided to arm Fyerabras / and of the ix
meruayllous swerdes / And how olyuer named his name ca ix
When fyerabras had long abyden lyeng without arysyng for Olyer / he salt up
and after said / Garyn A demand the without hydyng of what strength is
Rolland and Olyuer that been so much redoubted of paynems / and of what
gretenes ben they of / Olyuer answered as towchyng to rolland he is a little
less of body than I am / but of courage he is right hardy to fight / and so
chyualrous / that there is no man living in the world like to him For he never
faught yet against any man in the world but he vaynquysshed him / and as for
Olyuer thou may well apperceyue that he is a man much semblable and like to
me / and of the same gretenes that I am Then said Fyerabras / by the faith
that I owe to my god appollyn and to Termagaunt thou tellest to me a thing
whereof I am much abashed / For if they were such four as thou tellest to me
/ I would not refuse them ne leave them till I had put them to death with my sword
/ Olyuer could no longer forbere ne have pacyence unto the delays of fyerabras
/ but made ready to smite him / wherefore Fyerabras said to him / thou will have
no pycyon thyn own person / By mahoun my god if I arise and take my horse /
Charles thy king ne all thy goods shall not redeem the / but that thou shall
Incontynente be slain / For only if thou see me tofore the on my feet thou
shall be much corageous if thou tremble not for fere /

Olyuer answered thou have haunted the over long to do thing / which thou
never saw in thy live / For better it were to speak by mesure / for by over
/ much spekyng otherwise than truth / may bring the soon to myschyef /
Hereof was fyerabras strongely despyteous / And roos on his feet in a great
fyersnes / which was by common estymacyon xv foot long / And if he would have
be bartysed and believe in Ihesu Christ / there had never be seen a man of his
valor / And when he was a foot he had great dysplaysyr by cause he had not a
valyaunte man to Just against him and said to Olyuer / In truth I have great
pity of thyn affair for the noblesse of the courage that I see in the / I am
yet content for this present time / that thou return And send to me Rolland
or Olyuer or Ogyer or Gerard demondydyer / and expressly say to Olyuer that I
shall not pass this auauntagarde / till I have conquered him / Olyuer might no
longer abide the paynym / for if it had not be for his honor he had symte him
diverse times unarmed / And when he must needs fight / Fyerabras called Olyuer
and prayed him that he would help to arm him / Olyuer demanded if he might
trust him / Fyerabras ansuerd help me hardyly / For I ^^ere and assure the
that never while I live shall I be traitor to no man living / And upon that
promise olyuer did his dylige^ce to arm him / and he took first lether of
arabye and cladde him therwyth and after his cote and his habergeo^ of stele /
well boucled and polysshed / and after set on his heed an helm garnysshed
with precious stones rychely / But well considered the facyon of this payny^n
and of this christian man / there was great toyalte and curtosye between them /
which were assembled for to make mortal war and each to flee other and yet
they did each to other synguler service / First the pay ^ym had great pity for
to destroy Olyuer / For he was not his pere ne egal to the regard of his
person / And on that other part when he saw him hurt and the blood descend
to therthe he would have given to him of the precious bawme / Semblably Olyuer
when he fond him dysarmed he had slain him without great pain if he had
would / and after he was so curtoys that he aided to arm him that should fyt
against him O what great loyalte of noblesse was between them which were of
faith and creaunce contrary / I suppose that god should be well pleased / if
there were such confyaunce emonge christian men and so full of naturel noblesse /
But I return ageyn to my matter when Fyerabras was well armed / he thanked much
Olyuer / And after gyrde his sword named plouraunce / and in the arson of his
sadyl he had tweyne other / of whom that one was named baptysme / and that
other graba^n the which swerdes were maad in such wise that there was none
harnoys / but they would break and cut a sondre / And who that will demand
the manyer how they were made / and by whom after that which I have founden by
writing / On a time there were three brethern of one fader engendered / of whom
that one was named Galaus / that other munyfyeans / and the third was called
Agnisiax / These iij brethern made ix swerdes / each of them three / Agnisiax
the third brother maad the sword named baptesme which had the pomel of gold
and well enameld / and also plourance / and after Graham / which three swerdes
fyerabras had as I have said / Munyficans that other brother made another
sword which was named durandal which Rolland had / that other was called
sauuagnye / and that other Cortan which Og^er the danoys had / And galaus that
other brother maad the swerd that was named Floberge / another called haulte
clear / and that other Ioyouse which Charlemayn had for a great specyalte /
and these iij brethern aforesaid were smythes and wrought the said swerdes /
And in this point Fyerabras mounted on horse back and took his two barylles by
him full of bawme / And henge about his neck his shield which was heavy and
bended with iron and stele by meruayllous strength / And in the myddle of the
same shield was painted his god Appollyn / and after that he had commanded him
to his god / he took his spear in his hand which was sharp and mortally
heded with stele / It was meruaylle to see the corpulence of the said Paynym
which sat on his horse named feraunt of spain great thycke and pommellyd /
which had a specyal condycyon / For when his master in fyghtyng put to the
ground his aduersarye / this horse maad gretter war without comparyson than
his master / and thus they being on horsback / Fyerabras said to Olyuer / O
garyn gracyous and curtoys / yet I admoneste the for the gentylnesse that thou
have done to me / that thou will return without fyghtyng / For I have pity of
thy valyaunte courage / Olyuer answerde always thou spekest of great folly /
for I shall not depart for to be in danger to be dysmembred / For I am not he
that thou wenest to make aferde / for by the help of the blessed Ihesus this
day shall thou be yelden or deed or living unto charles the emperor / when
Olyuer had so spoken Fyerabras was meruaylously abashed of this man that would
not let for menace that he maad to him but would have the bataylle against him /
and said to him / Thou art a christian man and have great faith at the mysteryes
by you ordained / but I conjure the that by the font iij which thou were
baptized / and by the faith that thou have given to the cross whereon thy god
henge and was naylled / And by the loyalte that thou owe to charles
the emperor / to rolland and to the other pyeres of france thou say and tell
to me the veryte of thy right name and of thy lygnage / Olyuer answered Certes
Paynem he that enduced the to speak to me in such wise has well taught the /
For gretter ne more hyely myghtest thou not adjure me / wherefore know thou
that I am Olyuer the sone of Reyner the Earl of Genes the moose especyal fellow
of rolland / and am one of the twelve peers / In faith said Fyerabras I always
thought well / that thou were another tha^ thou saydest to me / seen thyn
ardaunt courage / and that I could not make the aferde upon the fayt of
bataylle / And how sir Oliver

was al blody / of which stroke olyuer was moeued and troubled that he had
fallen he had his sadel have been / For he was bowed afterward that he was al
to broken / And his horse began to halte of the stroke / and when he was comen
to him self with an hye boys began to (...) / O lord god my creator o what an
evil stroke have I received / O vyrgyn marye mother of Ihesus have pity of me /
For over fyersly cutteth the sword of this paynym / yeuo me grace that I may
ones have him / / and made upon him self the sign of the cross / and after
fyerabras said to him / Olyuer by Mahoun my god with this stroke I maad the
aferde / now may thou well feel how I can play / and I have no meruaylle
though thou command the to thy god / but I am evil content that I have hurt
the over sore with y^ stroke Nevertheless be sure that thou shall not see the
son goo to rest for thou begynnest now to change color and thy fyerce
manner nevertheless I am content that thou return / and that shall be for the
the best tofore thou know more fully my strength / for I warn the of one
thing that when I see my blood issue out of my body / then doubleth my might
and my strength / And I wot well that charles loves the not much when he
sends the to me / if he had lodged the in a fair bed and white shetes thou
had been much better / when Olyuer herd him so says he was replenysshed
with a fervent courage and began to lift up his heed and said / O Paynym
dysmesured / al day thou vanntest the for to bring me to the end of my days /
I pray to god almighty that he will reioye my courage / keep the well / I deffye
the / we have over long pleted / upon these words they ra^ne to gydre smytyng
meruayllously each other upon their helmes in such wise that boucles / naylles
and crochettes / precious stones / orfaueryes and flowers been he wen broken
and flowen to the ground / the fire issued out largely making great bruyt
with the swerdes upon their harnoys / In this while Charles was in great
medytacyon / and thought that the quarele of Olyuer was true and Just / and
that god ought to preserve him and when he thought that Olyuer might deye / As
Inpacyent of a perfayte faith he said /

O glorious god for whom we take pain I pray the to conserve oliver that he
be not slain ne taken / For I swear by the soul of my fader / that if he be
now slain of this paynym / that never in france in any church shall clerk ne
priest be reuested ne enhabyted / but I shall do bre^ne monasteryes chyrches /
oulters and crucyfyxes / Alas said Duc naymes / Sir king leave these words
vain and idle / and pray god for Olyuer / that he be in his aid for his holy
mercy / Al this while perseuerd the ij champyons fyghtyng and smytyng each on
other in such manner / that Fyerabras With his sword brake the cercle of
Olyuers helm / and made him fall on his vysage / and his horse had be slain if
he had not lepte a side / and Olyuer was hurt in his body / and specially in
the breast / and had then lost so much of his blood that he was much
feeble / which was no merueylle seen that he had resysted against the most
terryble man that ever was borne of mother

How Olyuer made his prayer to god when he felt him hurt capitulo xj
OLyuer the noble earl being in this malancolye of the great wounds that he
had in his body took his recomforte saying in this manner / O glorious god
cause a beginning of all that is above and under the fyrmamente / which for your
own playser fourmed our first fader Adam / and for his company gave unto
him Eve / by whom al humayn generacyon is conceived gyuyng to them license to
ete al manner fruytes / reserved only one / of which Eve by the moeuyng of the
serpent caused Adam to ete wherefore they lost paradys / and by the seduetyon
of the fendes of hell many have been deceived and dampened / whereof ye had pity
of the perdycyon of the world and came for to take flesh humayn in the womb
of the glorious vyrgyn marye / by thannuncyacion of the holy Aungel Gabryel /
and were borne as it pleased you / And anon after the three kings camen to
adoure and make obeyssaunce / and with gold / encence / and myrre made to you
their presents / After for you herodes made to be slain many children which
now been in Joy permanable / And when ye were in age by you determined ye went
in the world prechyng to your friends / Then afterward by thenuyous Jews ye
were hanged on the cross / in which so hangyng longyus the knight by the
Induction of the Jews percyd your side / and wha^ he hyleued in you and wesshe
his eyes with your precious blood he recouerd his sit fair and clear / and
cried you mercy whereby he was saved / After by your fre^des ye were laid in
the holy sepulture the third day after aroos and took ageyn life / and descended
in to hell / And took out Adam and Eve and al them that were worthy to have
paradys / And the day of your meruayllous ascencyon ye ascended in to heaven in
the presc^ce of al your a^^stles / Thus my god my maker as this is truth /
and I believe it verayly and fermly be ye in my comfort against this
myscrraunte / that I may vaynquysshe him in such wise that he may be saved /
And this said he blessed him with his sword in making the sign of y^ cross
in the name of god the holy trynyte / and smote his horse upon the hope of the
help of god / and Fyerabras said to him lawhyng / Olyuer fair friend I pray
the that thou hyde not from the oryso^ that thou have said now / for by my god
termagau^t I would gladly here it / Now would god of heaven said Olyuer that thou
were in such grace that thou sholdest believe it also fermly as I do / For I
assure the I should love the then as much as I do Roulland /

And Fyerabras ansuerd to him / by my god Mahoun and Termagaunt thou spekest
now of a much great folly /

How after a great bataylle Olyuer conquered the bawme and drank thereof at his
ease / and how he fyl to therthe when his horse was slain capitulo xij
FYerabras being wroth of the words of oliver in great Ire said to him keep
the well fro me for I deffye the / I am ready said Olyuer for to god I command
me / and so then they recountred to gyder so sharply and so hard strokes they
gaf / that the fire myt haboundantlye be seen spring out of their harnoys /
Their horses bowed under hem / and the earth trembled of the vruyt in the
medowe under mormyonde / Fyerabras took his sword in his hand and smote
Olyuer there as he was evil hurt in the breast under the pappe / and of that
stroke the eyes turned in his heed / And had his face all changed / And
then ageyn he cried on god and on the virgyn marie that he would save his
soul / Fyerabras by great cartosye said to him / Olyuer under stand me /
descend down surely and goo take of the bawme and drink at thyn ease / and
anon thou shall be al guarysshed and hole / and then may thou the better
deffende the against me / and thou shalt recoure new strength / But olyuer
for noothynge that he could do / though he should dye he would not / For by true
fightyng he would have it / And anon came that one against that other and
smyten in such wise that Fyerabras was hurt daungerously / For olyuers sword
entered in to his thye an half foot deep / and of the blood that issued out
all the grass was reed / And when he saw him so hurt / he drank of his
bawme / and was anon al hool / whereof olyuer was much sorouful by cause
thereof he could make none end of this paynym / And the frensshe men that saw
this / made to god their prayers deuontly that he would conserve that day
Olyuer / And in especyal Charlemayn which among al other loved him moast
entyerly / But when Olyuer saw the paynym al hole / and for the bawme so
comforted / by the aid of god he came to him and smote him upon the helm so
hard / that the stroke descended upon the sadel and cut the cord by which
the barylles were bounden and fastened / and the horse of fyerabras was aferde of
the stroke / and made a little course by the playsyr of god / Then Olyuer or
the paynym took any head bowed to the ground and took up the barylles and
drank at his ease and largely / and anon he was al hole and reconfermed in
new strength / and thought that if by adventure fyerabras were more hurt by
him / and might ageyn have his baryllys / that in the end it might evil hap
and come to him / wherefore he being nyghe unto a great river took the barylles
and threw then / therein / which were anon son^en / And as it is read at
all the festes of saint Johan these ij barylles ben showed above the water
euydently / when fyerabras saw that the battlles were lost / all most for
anger he was out of his mind / and by great reproach said to Olyuer / O evil
man that thou art / thou have lost my barylles which were more worth than all the gold in the world / but I promise the that or it be even they shall to the
ben dear sold / For I shall not cesse till I have smyton of thy heed / and this
saying be came against him / but Olyuer as be that doubts him not so much as
he did tofore / eschewed him not / but put him at the defense with his shield
to avoid the stroke / Nevertheless Fyerabras smote him so hard yt his helm was
desmaylled and broken but he was not hurt / and the stroke descended so
inpytuously y^ he cut asondre the neck of oliuers horse and fyl to ground /
and then was Olyuer on foot / but a great miracle it was of the horse of
fyerabras that maad no semblau^te to run upon him / as he had been taught like
as I have said before but held him stylle / above his propre custom /

How Fyerabras and Olyuer foughten to gyder afo^e merueyllously / and of the
prayer that Charles maad for Olyuer capitulo xiij
Much sorouful were the frensshe men when they saw Olyuer on foot / and would
have armed hem for to socoure him / But Charles would not consent for to
mayntene his honor and his truth And then king Charles kneled down to
therthe and maad his prayer to god that he would comfort Olyuer which was
thus dyspourueyed of his horse when Olyuer saw him self on foot / he was much
sorouful / and came a four paas nyghe unto Fyerabras and said to him / o king
of Alexandrye thou have borne the foul this day against me / In the morning
thou have so much preysed thy self / that thou have said / if v knights came
against the / thou would abide and conquer them / and thou know that the
king that sleeth an horse ought to have no part of therytage / Fyerabras
ansuerd I know well that thou say truth / but I did it not with my will /
Nevertheless to the end that thou be not evil content with me / I shall descend
down of my horse / and shall give to the my horse pomeld / And I promise the thou
shall be well horsed / And know thou that never in my life I was so abashed /
as when he saw the at earth / that he strangled the not for I never put man to
the earth and this horse present / but that anon he was by him slain and deed /
Olyuer ansuerd I promise the that I shall never take thyn horse but if he be
first by me conquered and Justly won / whereupon fyerabras was so much noble
/ that for the valyaunce of Olyuer said / Certain for the noblesse that I know
in the / I will do that I never did for man and sprange of his horse and stood a
foot / and was content to fight against him a foot / by cause he had no horse
of his own / and the said fyerabras was much heyer than Olyuer / and by one
accord they Iusted afoote that one against that other so meruayllously / that
it was wonder that both tweyne remained not in the field a swoune of the
trauaylle that they took / Thus contynue^g the bataylle which could take none
end / they spaken many reproaches and despytrous words that one of them unto
other / The king Charles seeing al this had great pity on Olyuer / Then the
Earl Reyner fader of Olyuer which was much sorouful came and kneled at the
feet of Charles and said O noble emperor in thonour of god take remors of my
sone / whom I see lykly anon to dye At lest make prayer to Ihesus our
maker that he be in aid to him that I may see him nyghe to me in health /
Incontinent Charles seeing this said / O lord god if ye suffer that Olyuer be
overcome / and that my right at this time be lost and defiled / I make auowe
that al crystyante shall be destroyed / I shall not leave in Fraunte church ne
monasterye / image ne altar and after kneled down with both his knees to the
ground and prayed in this manner / My creator which for our sauacyon was
borne of the glorious vyrgyn marie in bethleem / as I well believe that of your
glorious birth all the world was enlumyned which abode in this world full xxxij
year and more / and made at beginning Adam and Eve / of whom we ben comen and
that was in paradys terrestre a place much delectable / And there by you were
all f^^ytes abandoned to them / except one only which was of knowing good
and evil as it plesed you to ordeyne / of which adam ete and was dysobey saunt
/ for whom to the reparacion of his misdede and for to redeem him fro eternal
captyuyte and us also / ye were content to take the death in the tree of the
cross / after that the traycour Judas sold you for xxx pens / and on a friday
ye were payned / and your hands and feet mortally nay^led / and crowned with a
much sharp crown of thorns / and after Longyus smote you in the right side
to the heart / which was blind / and after that he had leyed on his eyes of
your precious blood / he saw much clearly / and after ye descended in to
hell and took out your friends / and sithe arods fro does to life / and tofore
al your apostles ye ascended in to heaven / and left for your lyeutenau^t saint
Peter thappostle in earth / and ordeynest baptesme for the regeneracyon of us
and to make us christian for to have salvation / O lord as all this is tr^^he /
and that I believe it stedfirstly so on this day be thou in aid and socour unto
Olyuer for to preserve him that he be not slain ne vaynauysshed /

He this saying and other devout words in his secret oratorye / Out lord
sent to him an aungel fro heaven which said to him / O Charles Emperor of
noblesse know thou for truth / that I am sent from god for to say to the /
that thou doubt no thing of Olyuer / for without faylle he shall win the
bataylle / though it be late / but he shall vaynquysshe the paynym / this said
the au^gel departed / end charles thanked god deuoutelye for his glorious me
dytacyon / Nevertheless after many bataylles between fyerabras and Olyuer maad /
and great menaces by great furour wyllyng to have given to Olyuer a great
stroke out of mesure / But Olyuer which saw the stroke coming deuaunced him
in such wise / that he gaf two evil strokes to Fyerabras / whereof Fyerabras
was passing angry upon Olyuer and Olyuer on him so that both were ryt actyf
never to depart / till that one of them were vaynquysshed and destroyed / and
at that time Olyuer was so coueytous in smytyng / that his hand in which he
held his sword was a sleep and swollen for the pain that he had of smytyng /
and he desyryng to smite his enemy at vtteraunce / his suerde flewe a far
fro him / out of his hand whereof he was sore moeued and abashed / and it was
no meruaylle / and much courageously ra^ne for to take up his sword And laid
his shield on his head for to preserve it / But not wythsto^dyng the paynym
smote him twyes so myghtyly / that he brake his shield in diverse places / and
his hauberke / so that he was sore astonyed for that time / And doubted so
much the paynym that he durst not take his sword / and much sodeynlye the
frensshe men which saw so Olyuer dysponrueyed of his sword armed them anon
and were in purpoos to run upon the sarasyn for to socour olyuer but Charles
would not consent that any man should goo / saying to them that god is almighty
for to save and mayntene him in his good right / for if he had not gaynsayed it
/ more tha^ xiiij thousand men were then ready for to have rescowed him / and
not wythstondyng al this / the paynym did but laughe and said to Olyuer / In
truth Olyuer I have opteyned upon the a little of mine entente / but wherefore
dare not y^ take thy sword I know now well that thou art enough vaynquysshed
/ sithe that thou art so aferde that thou dare not stoop for all the tresour
of the world / and I am well conte^te for to apoynte with the / that is / that
thou renye the faith that thou hold / the baptesme that thou have received /
and the god in whom thou byleuest and for whom thou have had al this pain /
and believe in Mahoun my god full of bounte / and I shall suffer the to live / and
more over I shall be content to give to the my sister to wy^ / to whom thou
shalt be rychely married / Her name is Florypes the fairest of mother borne /
and after we shall conquer France or this year be paste / And of one of the
royames I shall crown the king Olyuer ansuerd to him Paynym thou spekest to me
of great folly / for god forbede that ever I should be of entencion to forsake
my god which has created and fourmed me / and his holy sacrements / which
have been establysshed fo ^my sauacyon / for to believe in mahoun and in thy
gods full of abusyon which have neither strength ne virtue / but cause of
dampnacyon / Fyerabras said to him / by mahoun my god thou art always much
obstynat / that ne for pain ne for torment thou wylt not deny thy faith / and
of one thing which is more great / thou may well auau^te the / For never was
I of person so trauailled ne grieved as I am of the / Thou ought well to be
praised / I am content that thou take thy sword hardyly and surely / for
without competent wepen thou may not preuaylle ne more tha^ a woman / Olyuer
answered / Paynym I can not say the contrary but that thou offrest to me
service and bounte / but for the valewe of x thousand mark of gold I will not
take it / ne for to deye therefore / For if I had recouerd my sword by thy
curtosye / And it happed that thou were under my puyssaunce / and thou then
demaundest of me amytye and frendshyp / and then put the to death / it should
to me be vylete and reproach / And at this time my life and my death be in the
will of god / to whom I have given my self over / But and if I may win my
sword thou shall, bye it dear / and here deye / For other thing shall thou not
have / By my faith said Fyerabras thou art much surquydrous and glorious /
wherefore be thou sure / that shortly thou shall be confused descomfyte and
matte /

How at this bataylle Fyerabras was vaynquysshed by Olyuer / after that he had
recouerd one of the swerdes of fyerabras capitulo xiiij
When Fyerabras herd that oliver was so fyers of fayt and of courage / he had
great meruaylle / For he would not have his sword / but if he might by Just
war conquer it / wherefore the paynym dysmesurably came against him / and
held in his hand plorance his sword / Then it was no marvel though
olyuer was aferde to abide his enemy / he being dyspourueyed of sword and of
shield / For that was broken in two parties / but as it playsed to god / he
looked beside him and saw the horse of fyerabras / and on the arson of the sadel
were ij other swerdes of which I have spoken before / And anon Olyuer ran
right quyckely and took one of the swerdes which was named baptesme / which
had the blade much large and shone meruayllously / and after came against the
paynym and put tofore / part of his shield such as was left / and when he
was nyghe him he began to say / O king of Alexandrye now is time to compte /
For I am pourueyed of your sword of which I shall make you wroth / and keep you
well from me / for I have deffyed you / Then when Fyerabras saw it / and had
herd him so speak / anon began to change color and said / O baptym good
sword I have kept the many a day for one of the best that ever henge by my
side or by any man's that is living And after beheld Olyuer saying / By my god
Mahoun I know the a man of great fyerste I would that thou would take thyn
own swerd / and late me have mine / and then late us fight as we have begone
/ by my head said Olyuer / that shall never be by my will / for tofore I make
any pacte with the I shall assaye and approve this sword upon thy person /
keep the well fro me / For over long have we sermoned / This saying and other
things / Olyuer came as a lion hungry against fyerabras and smote him first /
but he myt not attain him on the head / but that he recountred first the
shield of the paynym / which he brake and al to frusshed evil that the half
flewe in the field / Then fyerabras was sore aferde of that stroke / For
above all this the sword with that stroke entered nygh half a foot within
therthe Then olyuer blessed him that had forged that sword and so well
tempred / and after many menaces rygorous they were in party descouuerd of
their helmes / And when Olyuer saw the Paynym Fyerabras in the vysage fyers
and courageous he said / O lord god of heaven maker of heaven and of earth / that
this paynym is noble and full of cruelte / Now would god that Charles had him in
his power and if he would be baptized / Rolland and I should be his pryue fellows
/ O glorious vyrgyn marie mother of god pray our lord Ihesu Christ thy sone
that he give grace to this sarasyn that he may believe in the christian faith /
for by him it may be much enhaunced / Fyerabras ansuerd in this manner /
Olyuer leave such words / tell me if thou wylt fight like as thou have
enterprysed / ye said olyuer keep the well fro me for ^^^ffye the / and ran
upon him / and Olyuer was smyton first upon his shield by such fiersnes that
he smote his shield in pyeces nyghe to his fyste / and it was meruaylle that he
cut it not of wherefore Fyerabras said that he had put him in such caas that he
should not long live in this world / Olyuer said no word but came with his
sword against the paynym Fyerabras much furyously / Then the paynym that
saw y^ stroke come threw his shield against olyuer wherefore anon it was
quartred / and was so astoned that the eyes in his heed were al troubled of the
pain / and the fire was seen spring out of the swerdes and sheldes much
habundantlye / and thus in smytyng fyerabras said in this manner / now is the
hour come that thou shall never have aid of thy god Ihesus in whom thou
byleuest / that anon thou shall be deed / sithe thou felest thy self ouercomen
/ And Olyuer anon ansuerd Ihesus is well mighty for to show his puyssaunce /
But anon thou shall know that Mahoun ne Termagaunte shall not mow aid the /
ne be so mighty but that thou shalt be deed / I shall well give the knowleche /
And herupon came that one upon that other / And olyuer was smyton on the helm
al unto the flesh in such wise that all that the sword araught it share and
passed thorugh / and then he said to olyuer / I suere to the by my god that I
have well araught the and smyton / Never shall charles ne Rolland see the be thou
well sure / Olyuer ansuerd / O Fyerabras of aleyandrye be not thou so proud /
for or I depart fro the / I shall render the deed or vaynquysshed / and god
grant to me that which I have always desired / And thereupon each smote other
so merueyllously that the bodies of them both swette for anguysshe and pain /
Fyerabras smote olyuer upon the helm so hard that the stoke came to the
flessh and if god had not wrought he had be slain at that time / wherefore
Olyuer as a man enraged came against the paynym / and the sarasyn lift on high
his shield so that he was al dyscouerd under the arm / and his flank was
there unarmed / Olyuer was wise and took good head / and came lightly and smote
fyerabras in his fla^ke so myghtyly / and continued in such wise that he
thrested his sword in one of his flanks well deep / and his sword / him self
/ and the place was all bybled of the blood / Thus was Fyerabras hurt in
such manner / that almoost his lowellys issued out of his belly / For then
at that stroke olyuer employed al his strength for to make an end of the
bataylle so long foughten /

How fyerabras being vaynquysshed byleued in god / and how he was borne by
Olyuer / And how Olyuer was assaylled of the sarasyns and tormented capitulo xv
AFter that the Paynym was smyton and hurt mortally as I have said / And he
seeing that he might no more tesyste against Olyuer / by the virtue of god he was
enlumyned in such wise that he had knowleche of the error of the paynyms /
and lift up his eyes unto heaven / and began to escrye the holy trynyte / and
the grace of the holy ghost / And after looked on Olyuer and said to him / O
noble Olyuer and valiant knight in thonour of god on whom thou byleuest / and
to whom I consent / I cry the mercy / and require the that I dye not till I
be baptized and yelden vaynquysshed unto Charles the Emperor / which so much
is redoubted / For I shall believe in the christian faith / and shall yield the
relyques for which ye be assemblyd and have taken so much pain / And I
swear to the that if by thy defaute I dye sarasyn / I make the culpable of my
dampnacyon / And if thou take not me in to thy guard I shall lose my blood /
Thou shall see me deye tofore thyn eyes / wherefore in the honor of god have
pity on me / Olyuer had so much compassyon of him for his soor that he sore
wept / and after he laid him in the shadow under a tree / and there bound
his mortal wou^des in such wise that he staunched his bledyng And after the
paynym prayed him that it might plese him to bear him away / For him self
might not goo / but when Olyuer saw that he was so heavy / he said that it was
not to him possible to bear him / Fyerabras enforced him self much and came
nyghe to him / O noble and redoubted Earl Olyuer in the honor of god led me
to charles or I be deed / for I am nyghe at mine end / for all my body bledeth /
take that horse and mount shown and come as nyghe to me as thou may / and if I
may lie thwart tofore the upon the sadel / thou may led me / and take my
sword by thy side / Now have thou four that been much worth / and hye and
depesshe the For this day in the morning I left in the wode that thou there
see here by fyfty thousand men which been al my subgettes / and commanded /
them that none should moeue / till I were returned fro the bataylle / when Olyuer
understood him he was al afraid and abashed for fere / but not wythstondyng
he said / Sir king sithe that it plese you I am content / and took him thwart
the horse as it was said / and went forth on the way in great sorrow / And
suddenly departed out of the wode / where as were the subgettes of Fyerabras a
much fyers paynym named bruyllant of Mommere / And after him Sortybrant of
nonymbres and the king of Mantryble / after him maradas / Pynan / and Tenebras
/ and well fyfty thousand sarasyns after / when Olyuer saw them come / he
smote the horse with the spores / but the charge was so heavy that he myt not goo
so fast as his enemies came to him / when the frensshe men saw the paynyms
come in so great nombre / anon lyghtely they armed them / And emonge other
rolland / Gherard of mondydyer / Guyllam the scot / naymes of bauyere / Ogier /
Rychard of norma^dye / Guy of bourgoyn Geffroy lantiguy / Basyn the due /
Thyery of ardeyne / And Aubert / And semblably Reyner of genes fader of Olyuer
faylled not / Olyuer saw alonge the medowe / and saw come to fore the other
brulla^t of mo^myere which rode on an horse as swyft as a grehounde and made
great bruyt emonge the other / For it seemed as it had be thonder and tempeste /
and bare in his hand a faus dart with a great led of stele square and sharp
/ which was all enuenymed with the blood of a crapausd and was right
dangerous / when Olyuer saw him he was al amo^ued and abashed / and said to
Fyerabras in this manner / Sir king ye must needs descente / I may no ferther
conduyte ^ou / wherefore I am meruayll^usly sorry and dysplaysaunt / For I know
that I must needs be oppressyd / ye see it well / And if they may attain I shall
be ^ut to death / And Charles shall never see me / which shall be to him great
dyscomforte / Then anon Fyerabras cried with an hye veys / O noble Olyuer
will ye now leave me / ye have conquered me / to you I am yeuen and yelden / it
shall not be reputed noblesse determined when I am youres and ye forsake me Alas
pour sorouful and caytyf that I am / if I deye paynym what shall come of me /
Virgyn marie mother of god have pity on me Unworthy that I am to return me to
you / And after he said to Olyuer I am conquered by the / and have promised to
the that I shall be baptized / If thou leave me / thou ought little to be
preysed / Olyuer ansuerd Fyerabras thou spekest as a knight / But I auowe to
god and to the court of heaven that I shall not leave the / I shall take the
bataylle in hand for the and shall deffende the as long as I shall be on live /
thou may well trust thereto / and there upon he took the hauberk of the
sarasyn / and with such as he myt have / he armed him / and prestly he abylled
him / and put on his heed an hatte of fyn stele / and held his sword drawn
named haultelere with which he could well help him / and hereupon came anon
brullant with his faus darte and atteyned Olyuer in the breast and gaf him an
evil stroke so that the dart brake / then said fyerabras / Sir Olyuer ye have
done enough for me / For ye be hurt late me descend down and lay me a part
out of the way to the end that I be not defoulled of these sarasyns ne taken
and destroyed / Thereof had Olyuer great compassyon and laid Fyerabras in the
shadow of a pynapple tree forre out of the way and when he would have fled
he saw about him well x thou sand sarasyns and said / Alas god Ihesus my
creator thou know mine entencyon / I require the to give me grace that I
deye not at this time present unto the time that for thexaltacion of thy faith
I may be with Rolland my felawe / and in the name of Ihesus drew out haulte
clear / and came in to the way and the first that he recou^tred was the sone
of the grettest lord that was there / and gaf him such a stroke that he clefte
him to the breast and fyl down deed / and Olyuer was abylle and deliver and
took fro him his shield which was al new / for in the bataylle tofore maad he
had lost his / and also he had his spear and let his horse run emonge the
myscreauntes / And atteyned at the first stroke Clorgys / and smote him unto
the heart / And in retornyng he slew three sarasyns and they ra^ne tofore him as
sheep tofore the wulf which is hongry / Then came on him mara bas / Turgys /
Sortybrant of conymbres and the king Margaris / and they cried with an hye voys
to gydre / by Mahoun our god / thou fre^sshe man thou shall not escape us /
keep the well for by us thou shall deye / And then came Olyuer emonge his
enemies and smote and slew on al sides / And the saresyns smote on him in
such wise that it was great meruaylle that he was not slain and ouercomen but
by force and shot and of strokes his horse was slain under him / And he being
on the earth as soon as he might he aroos / and being afoot set his shield
tofore him which he had gotten / and held fast haultclore which was all his
comfort for to socoure him / And always whom he raught / fyl down and was
slain / It is not read in any book that ever any man so hurt as he was bare
him so well and did so great portemente of arms /

How Olyuer was taken and blynfeld pyteously / and might not be socoured by the
Frensshe men capitulo xvij
OLyuer was a allone on foot among the sarasyns against whom he made great
resystence and meruayllous but it is not a thing possible that he might escape
fro their hands / for with glayues with swerdes and with faus darts of iron
they pressyd him so fore that his shield was perced in moo than xxx places /
and when his hawberk was broken and perced with four sharp darts / they
perced and wounded him in his body meruaillously / wherefore by very force and
for feblesse he fyl to the earth / and there they took him much outerageously
/ and after blynfelde his eyes and bond him straytely so that he myt not see
ne wist not where he was / and they set him upon a good horse and bond him
surely And when this valiant olyuer was thus dyspourueyed fro al help / fro
al sit / fro al hope and fro al comfort / it is good to wete that he was in
great desplaysaunce / For he knew not what they would do with him / Then
with an hye voys by a compassyon of heart he said / O Charlemayn king of
noblesse / Emperor of valor where art thou now / and know thou not where I
am / see thou not what I do / remembrest not me / Noble felawe Rolland thou
art all a sleep / am I deef / or how I may not here the / is there none of you
christian that remembers me / These and such other complayntes making / the
king Maradas said to him / Frensshe man what someuer thou be / thou spekest of
folly / For I shall not ete till thou be hanged / These sarasyns ran with
olyuer his ^yen blynfelde and his hondes straytly bounden in the guard of four
falls tyrants / Then upon this in especyal came Rolland Thyerry and all the
peers and charles him self also / but this was over late for to save Olyuer /
with great cries they cried on god / and on all the saints of heaven / And with
great Ire Rolland smote Corsuble in the breast Gherard of mondydyer came against
Turgys / Ogyer smote athenas / And Rychad Amancdys / Guy of bourgoyne atteyned
brullant / There was none of the peers of france but that over three we his man
/ and made so great dyscomfyte of the sarasyns / that they were al empesshed to
hold them to gyders and to goo their way / but the other paynyms that
conduyted Olyuer went always forth / And in this bataylle was slain / guyllam
gaultier and other ynow of valyaunte people / and many other of the moyen people
and lay on the ground / And Gherard de mondydier the sone of Duke Thyerey and
geffroy langeuyn they bond dylygently to their horses / and rode aweye with
them hastily / but when charles saw them thus fadde / for anger he lost
almoost his wit / And with an high voys cried / save keep and socoure the
barons / O knytes desloyal that ye be slow if they led away the barons never
shall ye fare well / when the Frensshe men herd Charles thus moeued / as enraged
smote their horses with their sports and went down of a mountayn And there was
Rolland first that held his sword durandall drawn for tauenge him fyersly
and him that he atteyned was sure to pass by the death / For he was al enraged
by cause that they led aweye his fellow Olyuer / and smote a paynym that he
clefte him to the myddle of his body / at that time rolland bare him myghtely /
by cause of the multitude of the paynyms he might not pass forth for to
socoure the barons prysonners / and chaced them more than v mile far / and
could not approach them / and then were many good knights deed morfounded
and weary / And not wythstondyng Rolland swear that he would never return / till
the barons of france were taken fro the hands of their enemies / But he might
not do it / For the night came on / and Wist never whyther to goo / The
sarasyns that were tofore went fleyng always at their playsyr / This seeing
Charles wist not what he should do ne say / For he doubted that the paynyms
made a watch and a ryere guard for to close them / And therefore by force they
must leave the field in ryt great dysplaysyr and anguysshe / and so al they
returned /

The second party of the second book conteyneth xvij chapytres and speaks of
the tormente of the barons of france / and how they that were taken spaken to
ballant thadmyral of spain /
How fyerabras was fou^den by Charles / and after was baptized and heled of his
wound capitulo primo
AFter that charles knew that he might not have ageyn Olyuer ne the other
prisoners / it was force to him to return with his people for the night was
then to them grievous / and also in retornyng they fond fyerabras under a tree
languysshyng to whom ye king said / O unhappy paynym I out well to hate the /
for by the been my men prysonners and boste / thou have take fro me oliver one
of the best byloued that I had emonge al thumayn creatures / him y^ has be
synguler to mayntene my good name / and by the in the end instead of Joy
thou yeldest me sorrow / when fyerabras understood him he sore syghed and said
/ O rich emperor and noble the most mighty of humayn lygnage / In thonour of
god I cry the mercy and pardone me / It is truth that Olyuer has conquered
me / I shall not hyde it / and I have promised him that I shall be crystned / I
have left and forsaken al my gods and yield me to Ihesus the creator of the
world / And I require the yet that I may be baptized / and if I were heled of
my wounds I shall enhau^ce to my power the christian faith / and many sarasyns
shall be maad christian / and by my moyan the holy sepulcre and the holy relics
shall be delyuerd / for whom ye take great pain and trauaylle And also I make
an oath to you by god in whom I now believe / that I am more heavy and sorry for
Olyuer that noble knyt which is taken prysonner / than I am for my body which
is morrally wounded / and by the grace of god we shall have him ones / wherefore
conclude we that I be crystened / For if I deye sarasyn / it shall be to you
reproach / And upon this Charles which had great compassyon on him / made him
to be borne in to his ledgyng by his barons / and when they saw him so hugely
me^bred they al were abashed of his gretenes and largenes / for when he was
v^armed he was one of the semelyest men that ever was / And all the Frensshe men
gaf great loss and honor to Olyuer that had foughten and ouercomen such a man
/ and as he was unclothed / party of his wounds opened / and began to blede /
whereof his heart faylled / and fyl down a swoune / and rolland anon lift him
up / And in all haste they made ready a font / and sent for thachebysshop
Turpyn and Naymes which were much Joyous of this that the paynym should be
crystend / and after that the baptesme was ready the godfaders gaf him another
name / and was named floren / but as long as he lived he was called Fyerabras
/ and then he was laid in a bed honorable / And at the last end of his
days he was a saint / and god showed for him miracles / and is now called
Saint Floren of Roye / And then anon charles made him to be vysyted by his
medycynes and surgyens well expert and search den al his wounds / and as god
would / they fond none of his bowellys e^tamed ne hurt wherefore the leches
were sure for to deliver him al hole within ij months next after coming / In
making this vysytacion the Emperor charles was present and said to fyerabras /
if now olyuer and the other barons were here present tofore the / we should well
be content / And charles was then al pencyf and heavy much thynkyng upon his
barons prisoners but he maad no more semblaunte /

How Olyuer and his fellows were presented to ballant thadmyral and cruelly
passyoned in prison capitulo ij
THe sarasyns after they had the barons of france tofore named for prisoners /
they tarried not but ran till they came in to a rich cytee named Agrymore /
and at the enter of the said cite they sowned and blewe up trumpes making great
bruyt / when ballant thadmyral / fader of Fyerabras saw them he came unto them
/ and fond there brullant of mo^myer to whom he said / O brullant my friend
^^lle to us of your tidings / how ye have borne you in my war and affairs /
have ye taken Charles the emperor / which so much is redoubted / and his
peers of france be they dyscomfyted / Brullant said to him / O sir admyral the
tidings that I bring you been all otherwise and of less valewe than ye say
/ by Charles the king we have been almoost defeated and dyscomfyted / For of
his puyssaunce it is a meruayllous thing / Fyerabras your sone is with him
vaynquysshed by one of his barons / and is made christian / and he was taken /
vaynquysshed and dyscomfyted in loyal batayl without doing any treason when
thadmyral understood this he fyl to therthe al in a traunse And or he came
ageyn to his mind it was a great while for the sowwe that he had of his sone /
and when he was releued he cried with an hye voys / O dolaunt unhappy that I am
/ ha pour caytyf what shall bycome of me / O Fyerabras my right dear sone and
heyer whyther art thou gone / Fro whens comes this trespaas / wherefore were
thou taken / which never in bataylle were weary ne had reproach O what evil
tidings been brought to me of the / if he be christian I am sorry that he lives
I had much lever that he were dysmembred and put to death / and then as a man
feeble for sorrow fyl down to the ground and cried / O brullant of mommyere
what is betyd of the noble king of Cordube / and of my neuewe bruchart / sithe
my sone fyerabras the ledar and captayn of all / if it be true that he be lost
I shall smite out the brain of Maho^met the god which has promised to me so
much good to whom I have given my self and yolden / Thus saying all in a
rage he tormented him self grievously upon the ground / And when thadmyral was
a little coled of his great ire / He demanded of Brullant which is the knyt
that has vaynquysshed fyerabras my sone / brulla^t answered / Sir admyrall your
sone has be conquered by yonde knight in showing Olyuer / which was so fair
and well formed and membred / and had emonge al other his eyes bended / Now
anon said thadmyral of spayn hye you and bring him to me / for I shall never
ete till (...) membred / when the frenssh men understood / that he would do put
Olyuer to death which was al their comfort / begone to were grievously / and
olyuer which understood it saw them waylle / be recomforted them saying in
such manner / that the sarasyns wist not what they said / My lords and my
brethern ye know our necessite if thadmyral myt know that we be of the peers
of france our lives shall be sone termyned for for no thing shall he take ryte
of us / but that we shall deye shamefully / wherefore I pray you that we al say
as I shall begin to whom all the other frensshe men pryso^ners did consent
and would say and do like as he counceylled them / after that thadmyral had
commanded them to come tofore him / the paynyms unarmed them / and bond fast
their hondes / and blynfelde their eyes / whereof they were much grieved and
daungerously hurt / and anon thadmyral furiously demanded olyuer / y^ frenssh
man beware that y^ lie not but say to me the truth how thou art named and
hyde it not / Olyuer ansuerd and said sir I am named engynes sone unto a yeman
of pour lygnage / and was borne in lorayne / and came on a time to the court
of Charles emperor which gaf to me arms / and after adoubed me knight and
also my felawes that ye see tofore you ben pour knights aduenturous / and
have enterprysed pain to serve our king / because yt by our service we myt be
auaunced and have so^me good guerdon and reward / O Mahoun said thadmyral /
now I am well deceived / I supposed by my god that I had had five of the
valyauntest earls of france and of the gretest / and thought I had the kayes
of france by the moyen of these barons / and anon called barba^as his
chamberlayn / and said to him anon depesshe the take these frensshe men and
despoyle them / and bind them hard to that pyler / and after bring me my
darts well sharped with iron / and I shall shote at them / and smite hem at my
playsyr / then aroos brullant and said / sir admyral I pray you that at this
time / that ye do not that enterprise / for it shall not be well do ye see well
that it is in the euentyde / and over late to do Justice / and so ye might be
blamed / seen that your seygnorye ne your lords be not here now present /
wherefore I pray you that at this time ye do no thing to them till to morrow /
at hour that each man know it / and your Judgment shall the better be
approved / For I know well that they have deserved it well euydently / And on
that other side if charles the emperor would yield ageyn to you Fyerabras your
sone with his good will / ye might semblably remyse to him these fre^ssh men
that ye now have / for your love said thadmyral I am content / and sent for
Brutamont which was kepar of the prison and gaf to him great charge to keep the
frensshe men / and that he be well f^^re of them / and that he set them in
such place for to learn how they have wrought folyly for to come in to his
keeping /

Of the prison wherein that the Frensshe men were lodged / And how they were
vysyted by the fair Florypes daughter of the admyral / and of the beaulte of
her capitulo iij
AFter that ballant thadmyral of Spain had commanded that the Frensshe men
were set in grievous prison / brutamont the geayler made Olyuer and his
felawes to auale down in to a prison much dangerous which was so deep and
strayt in the ground that no lyt might be seen / in the which were put and
nourysshed serpents / crapauldes / and other beestes venomous and detestable /
in which place al stenche was comprysed and there passed a streme of the salt
see which had his entree without conduyt / by which water might one pass
when the tide was passed / and or the kepar of the prison went he blynfeld them
and shet the door above them and they being in this fylthe and stenche / anon
the water came so habu^dantly that the pour fre^ssh men were in the water unto
their sholdres / Then the wou^des of olyuer began to smerte by cause of the
salt water that it perced his heart / ye may well think the pain was great /
But in especyal of olyuer which was hurt mortally in many places and had great
necessyte of remedy / and he was in a place where al his pains were renewed
and his wounds opened / for anon as he felt him bayned in the salt water /
he fyl down a swoune and had be deed that time ne had be gherard de mondydyer
who sustained him / and ye may demand me how they were not drowned seeing
that the water grew always / ye shall understand that in that prison of
adventure were two great pylers well xv foot hye / upon which by great force
they gate up olyuer which myt not help him / and when olyuer was set
thereupon / in great a^guysshe he waylled and said / o pour man and unhappy /
put under by falls fortune / O Reyner my dear fader / for gods sake what do ye
know ye where I am / think ye what I make / know ye my sorrow / ye shall
never see me / this saying and other lamentable words of desolacyon / the
valiant man Gherard said to him / Sir oliver waybe no more / unto such a
knight as ye be / it e^pperteyneth not to make such co^plainte rejoice we our
self / and trust we in god / which I would it plesed that now we that be here
were above at large al armed and each a good sword in his hand only / for I
make a vow to god / that or we should be put in to this pytte vnynguysshed / I
should put to death in C sarasyns or moo the frensshe men being on these pylers
of marble before said in such wise saying and other words / Florypes the
sister of fyerabras and daughter of thadmyrall herd them and had great
co^passyon of yt complayntes that Olyuer made / this douter was young and not
married was well comprysed of body / reasonable of length whyt and rody as rose
in may / her heir was shynyng as the fine gold / and her vysage termyned in
little of length / and her chere lawhyng / her eyes clear as fawcon mued / and
sparklyng like ij sterres / the vysage had she devised much egally / her nose
strayt which was well semely / the ij brows which were above the eyes
appyeryng made shadow / her chekys round whyt as the flour delys a little
tyssued with reed / and under the nose was her mouth roundette enhaunced in
competent space fro the chynne al well proporcyoned to the remenaunte of the
head / with litel sholdres strayte and egalle / and tofore above the gyrdle her
pappes were raised after the facyon of ij apples round and even as the coppe
of a ltel montayn / And she was cladde with a robe of purple meruayllously
rich filled and pouldred with sterres of fyn gold / which was made of one of
the fayrye / and it was of great virtue / for the person that had it / might
never be poysonned of herb ne of venym / And florypes was so fair with her
abyllements / that if a person had fasted iij or iiij days with out etyng /
and he might see her he should be replenysshed and filled and more over she bare
a mantell which was made in the isle of colchos of a woman of the fayrye /
there as Jason gate the fliese of gold / as it is read in the destructyon of
troy / almoost at the beginning / which mantel had so sweet an odor that it
was meruaylle / wherefore of the beauty of this damoysel each man meruaylled /
and as I have said tofore she had well herd the complaynt of the frensshe men
in prison / and in especial of Olyuer of whom she had great pity and departed
fro her chamber with xij maidens her subgettes and entered first in to the halle
/ where as the paynyms were much desolate for fyerabras which was taken and
many other great lords which were deed / and when the daughter had demanded
tidings / they told her y^ her brother fyerabras was taken and vaynquysshed /
wherefore anon she made a great cry / and syghed for anguysshe / then was all the sorrow renewed for her sake emonge them / and when she had cessyd a little
of weeping she sent anon for brutamont and said to him / what be they that I
have herd speak in the prison that been so sorouful Madame said the porter they
be fre^ssh men longyng to Charles the King which never cesse to destroy our
law / she our people / repreue our creau^ce / and set at naught our gods /
and have been aydyng to slay Fyerabras your brother / among whom there is one of
great valor / which is one of the best made men that ever was known / and
has been so mighty that he conquered in loyal batayl Fyerabras / Anon floryres
had envy to here him speak / and said to brutamo^t / I will speak with hem come
and opene the prison for I will know of their fayt brutamont answered and said
Madame ye shall pardonne me / ye may not see them by cause of the fylthe and
dyshoneste of the place / it apperteyneth not to you and on that other side
your fader has deffended me that no person shall approach the prison And I
remember me now well that oftymes by a woman I have known sum shamed and
deceived / when floripes understood she was for anger almoost fro her self and
said to him / O evil glouton despytous ought thou to give me such langage /
I promise the that I shall make the to be paid shortly / and called her
chamberlayn which gaf to her a staff / and she made semblaunte to opene the
prison and brutamont gaynsayed it / and suddenly she seeing the porter
wythstonde her gaf him such a stroke on the vysage y^ she made his eyes flee
out of his heed and after he fyl down / and there she show him / and threw
him without knowing of the sarasyns in to the prison where the frensshe men
were / whereof they were sore aferde and abashed when they herd him / wenyng to
them that it had be the devil which would have tempted and deceived them Then
anon florypes did do light a torche and did do open the prison / and put in
the light tofore her for to see the prysonners and came nyghe to the pyler and
said to them / O^ye lords tell to me what ye ar / and how ye be named hyde ye
no thing fro me / Olyuer ansuerd and said / My fair lady we ben of france and
men of charle mayns / and have been brout hither to thadmyral which has
commanded us to be here in this cruel prison / and much better were it for us
that he did us to be dysmembred and dye / than tabyde in this place / the
curtoys florypes not withstondyng y^ she was not crystened had so great
noblesse and so great compassyon and said to them / I promise you that I shall
put you out of this prison / so that ye promette and swear / that ye shall help
me to that that I shall say to you / Olyuer ansuerd / thereof madame I you assure
/ and that ye shall find us all such by effect as ye shall desire and faithful
and true / For never were we other ne never shall be and be ye sure that we
shall never fail you as long as we shall have life in our bodies / se y^ we be
furnysshed of arms / and been above for to meddle with the sarasyns / I shall
make to them a great dyscomfyte / vassal said the daughter / ye may auaunte you
over much / yet ye be there and well far for to be out / and yet menace ye
them that been at their lyberte / It is better a man wisely to be stylle / than
folysshly to speak / Gherard said to the lady / Damoysel I shall say to you one
word / he that is deteyned and strongely empesshed sings gladly for to
forgete his pain and melancolye / And Floripes byhelde gherard the curtoys
which excused Olyuer of that which he spoke over hardyly / but this was not
great meruaylle / For of the Joy that olyuer had when the lady said to him
that they should be put out of prison / him thought then to be out and armed
at his free will / But the lady said to gherad / In truth sir ye can well say
and excuse your fellow redyly / And I believe verily that ye can well play with
maidens of eage in so^me chamber under curteynes and dysporte you in love / I
trow ye know how and what manner / Guillam the scot answered and said / by my
soul madame ye say soth / and of him ye have well deuyned / for fro hens unto
iijC mile ye shall not find his pere

How the frensshe men were put outo of prison and were vysyted by the noble
maid Floripes / and of the beaulte of her chamber capitulo iiij
When the fair Florypes had spoken at her playsyr with the barons prysonners
she called her chamberlayn / and made him to bring a cord and a staff
bounden overthwart / and after let it down / And when the frensshe men saw it
/ they made first Olyuer to goo up / and the lady and her chamberleyn drew him
up by great force / and after that the other went up lightly enough / and
after she led them by an old gate and secret / and without knowing of any
paynym she made them to enter in to her chamber / whereof thentre was made
meruayllously after the sarasyns work / Above the chyef yate was made by great
science / the heaven and the sterres / the son / the moon / the time of somer
and of winter / wodes montaynes birds beestes and fysshe were there painted of
all fygures and likeness by meruayllous facyon / and after so^me scryptures /
the sone of mathussale did do make it / And this chamber stood upon a black
roche al enuyronned with the sea / and in one of the quarters was a gardyn
pretoyre meruaylously fair / wherein flowers ne fruytes faylled never / and
there of al maladyes and sekenesses sauf only of the maladye ot death was
founden comfort and good help / There within grew mandegloyre / And with the
fair Floripes were in the gellerye these ladies Clarmondyne / florette /
Florymonde and many other fair vyrgynes / And her maistresse named maragonde
said to Florypes / A madame I know well these frensshe men / yonder goodly man
that ye there see is Olyuer which is sone to Reyner of genes / and brother to
Audeyne one of the fairest that is borne of a woman / And this is he that has
vaynquysshed fyerabras thy brother / and that other is gherard of Mondidier
which oftymes has be praised and honored / And there is willyam do scot / and
the camuse which is the hyndmest / is geffroy langeuyn / but I pray to my god
mahomet that he curse me if I ever ete or drink till I have told your fader my
lord thadmyrall Floripes anon changed al her color when she herd these
words / and much secretly she retained her Ire against her / and called this
woman to her by the wyndowe / and gaf her so great a stroke that she fyl to the
ground / and called her varlet which came to her prestly / and threw the
woman in to the sea / For Florypes redoubted much her fader and his malice /
and when this old woman tombled in to the sea / Florypes said to her / Now goo
thou old and despytous wretch / thou have thy guerdon / I am now sure that
the frensshe men that been here ne shall never be en combred ne in danger by the
/ and hereof the barons made great Joy / and then Floripes the noble lady
came unto the Frensshe men / and kyssed them swetely and when she saw oliver
which was al blody and knew well that he was hurt she said to him / Sir
Olyuer ne doubt ye not / for I shall render you anon al hole and in good
health / and went to the mandegboyre and took a little / and anon as oliver
had used it / he was al hele and reduced in to good health / The barons being
in this noble chamber / anon had good fire / and after were set to the table
and well pourueyed of al good vytaylle and delycyous metes / of which they had
great need / because of the great hungre that they then had endured / and
after mete they had the buynes chauffed / And then they bayned and refayted
them at their ease / and at the coming out of their baynes they were well
adoubed with mantels rich of sylke and gold broundred / and then Floripes
said / lords burons ye know well how I have put my self in great danger / to
bring you out of prison mortal / and ye be here in surete / as far as no
man has herd us / For if of adventure it were known / it should torn us to
evil / I am not in doubt / Olyuer which is here present has ouercomen my
brother to whom naturelly I ought to do repre^f / I know you well all / be ye
nothing abashed / ye know well that ye have promised that my secret shall be
hid emonge you / and after the said Florypes said / lords I shall say to you
/ there is a knight in frannce whom I have long time loved / he is named guy
of bourgoyne / which is the most godelyest man that I know and is of the
parentage of Charlemayn and of the myty Rolland / On a time when I was at Rome
I saw him / and sithe that time I have given to him mine heart / when my fader
the admyral destroyed Rome lucafar of ba^das which was much redoubted emonge
the Paynyms / and the said guy of bourgoyne Iusteden to gyder / but the said
guy valyau^tly smote him down to the earth from his horse which much plesyd me
/ And took in gree the halyau^ce of him in such wise / that if I have him not
to husbond / I shall never marye / And for the love of him I will be baptized and
believe in the god of christian men / with these words the fre^sshe men were
much Joyous / and given great thankynges to god for the good will of this
fair maid / and Gherard de mondydyer said to her / Madame I swear to you /
that if we now were armed and were in the halle emonge the sarasyns we should
make on them a great dyscomfyture / But florypes was wise and said / lords
late us think wisely on our affairs / And sithe that ye be in surete / take a
litel rest / Loo here vj maidens of great no bless / Each of you take one for
his own / for the better to pass with the time and rest and take your
playsyr / And I shall warante you / For as for my self I shall never have to do
with man but with Guy of bourgoyne to whom I have given my heart Nevertheless
for to consider well this chapter / there was a great work comprysed / when
first florypes the curtoys which was a paynym had desire to speak with the
frensshe men / all this touches well the desire and will of wymmen for to
know new things and tidings / but as much as touched the work that she
did against the kepar of the prison / and how they were taken out / That was
the work of a man well approved / and it had been great damage if those barons
had abyden in prison / But the faith of persons does great alegement of
tormente / for the saints of heaven by their holy faith have obtained heaven /
and many other terryen men / victory of their enemies / and with good right he
that fyghteth for the faith / and it hap that he be deteyned / the mercy of
god is nyghe for to deliver him / The cause wherefore they were delyuerd fro
prison was come fro far / that was of rome for guy of bourgoyne whom she had
in love / and was content for to be baptized and believe in god for to have the
said guy in marriage to her husbond / wherefore it may not well be comprysed how
love in this damoysel was fyxed and comprysed of long affectyon / the which
was cause of saving of the prisoners / which were as I have said in great
danger /

How king charles sent to Ballant thadmyral seven peers of France which would
not have goon capitulo v
THe Duc of genes fader of Olyuer / which myt not sleep ne ete ne drink for
the sorrow that he had for his sone / when he might no longer endure he came to
king charles and said to him / Sir Emperor for the love of god have pity on me
/ ye know my sorrow ought I to lose olyuer my sone for whom I am in
contynuell anguysshe / if I have none other tidings I shall deye or ij days of
melancolye / or of force I must put my self on the way to goo thither / when
charles understood him / he was moeued and full of compassyon for the
melancolye of Reyner / and sent for Rolland and said to him / Fair neuewe
rolland understand me To morn in the morning thou must goo to Aygremore and
shall say to ballant thadmyral without any hydyng that he deliver to the the
crown of Ihesu christ and the other relyques / for which I have taken great
pain And after ask of him my barons whom he holds in prison And if he
wythsaye the / say to him that I shall him do be druwen vylaynously / and after
ha^ge him by the neck / his eye bounden as a thief / when he had said Rolland
answered / Sir king and fair uncle have mercy on me I am well sure that if I goo
verayly I shall never see you / The duke naymes was there which said sir
emperor take heed what ye do / Rolland is your neuewe / ye know of what
valewe he is of / if he goo thither he shall never come ageyn / And I assure you
said Charles that ye shall goo with him and bear my letters that I send to
thadmyral / This said Basyn the genewey came forth and said to him / and how
sir will ye thus lose your knights / I am certain that if they goo as ye have
said that there shall not one return / Charles swear by his eyes in his heed
that basyn should goo with the other tweyne / and so there shall be three / Thyerry
duc of ardayne said like to the other therefore he was ordained to goo also /
Ogyer the danoys semblably said they ought not goo / and therefore he was
ordained to bear them felywshyp / Rychard of Normandye came to the emperor and
said / Sir king I am al abashed how ye have no pity of your knights / which
wyllyngly ye will make them to deye / I wot well if they goo thither ye have
lost them / by the god on whom I believe said charles / ye shall goo with the
other / and then shall ye be vj for to bear my letters to ballant thadmyral
whom I so much hate / And after he beheld guy of bourgoyne and said to him
come to me / ye are my cosyn and of my next parentage / ye shall be the seventh
for to do my message to thadmyral of spain / And ye shall say to him that I
purpose to baptyse him / and that he hold of me his Royame / his towns and
his cytees / and that he deliver to me the relyques for whom I take on me so
great pain and trauaylle / And if he gaynsaye it / say ye to him that I shall
do hang him / and make to dye vylaynously / alas said Guy of bourgoyne /
right dear sir and emperor I know now well that ye will lose me / if I goo I am
sure I shall never return / and then at even they went al to souper / And on
the morn as soon as the son aroos the seven barons aforesaid came tofore
Charles / And sir Naymes said for them al / Emperor of noblesse redoubted in all places / we been here for tobeye thy commandment / we pray the that thou
give us license and congie for to depart / and if there be any person here
present / or in all thexcersyte that has trespaced to us we pardonne him / and
semblably if we have offended to any / In thonour of god that it be pardonned
to us / with these words all the frensshe men that were present began to weep
for pity / And charles said to the barons / Right dear and well by loved unto
god of heaven I command you / and the merit of his holy passion and of the
holy cross be in your aid and comfort And so they departed on their way
hastily / tra^sportyng them unto the strange contraye /

How the admyral sent xv kings sarasyns to Charles for to have ageyn
fyerabras / which were recountred by the pe^es of france and slain capitulo vj
IN aygremore was then ballant thadmyral al sorrowful and angry / and had
sent for xv kings sarasyns for to have their counceyll which at his
commandment came / and one maradas the most fyerce of the xv spoke first to
ballant and said / Sir admyral wherefore have thou sent for us / ballant
answered and said bordes I shall say to you y^ troth Charlemayn of france
requires of me great folly / For he will that I be subgette to him / and that I
hold al my lands of him but this shall not be / and he is a much fool me
thinks to entrepryse such folyes / It were better to him to take his playsyr
to sleep / and rest in his chambres his old body / and pray god in his
chyrches / and ete such as he has / Nevertheless I counceyl you that ye goo to
him to mormyonde where as he is lodged / and say to him that I comau^de him
old dotard that he believe in mahoun our god without delay / and above that /
for to send and yield to me ageyn my sone Fyerabras for whom I am detryned in
great anguysshe and sorrow / And furthermore I will that he hold of me al
France and his regyons / and if he do not as ye shall deuyse / I shall goo
fetch him with an hundred thousand men armed / And if by adventure ye find in
your way any christian man / smite of his heed without any mercy when thadmyral
had said Maradas answered / Sir admyrall I know now well that ye will have us
destroyed / for the fre^ssh men ben much felons / And if we say that ye have
purposed / he shall sone make an end of us / for we shall be dysmembred / but
believe ye not that I say this for cowardyse or for to eschew your
commandment but that I will accomplysshe it / F^^ I have such courage that if
by adventure I meddle with these christian men I shall put to death ten or I be
weary / And if I do not as I have said / I will that ye do smite of my head /
all his felawes fayden that each of them should do as well as Mamdas / wherefore
without more delyberacyon they went to horseback well armed and great speres
in their hondes / with penou^s raised puyssauntly / and Iourneyed forth on
their way / and rested not till they passed the bridge of mantryble / and
as soon as they might they passed over And the frensshe men before named came and
recountred those sarasyns / And first duc Naymes espied them / and said to his
fellows / O lord god of heaven what enterprise has these sarasyns made / See ye
not them how they come against us with great puyssau^ce / advise we us what is
best to do / Rolland said my lords ne doubt ye no thing / Behold and see
them / they be not passing xx or xxx / late us ride strayte to them / They all
were of his oppynyon and ride forth fast against them / Of the party of the
sarasyns was Maradas puyssaunt and well armed which went and said to the
frensshe men / how be ye so Infortunat and cursed to come and mete with us /
and ye be christian Duke Naymes ansuerd what someuer thou be thou spekest by
laynnously and over folysshly we be men longyng to y^ redoubted emperor
Charles / and goo in his name to do a message to Ballaut thadmyral / Maradas
said to him ye be in danger will ye defend you or do otherwise / Naymes
ansuerd we will defend us by the help of Ihesu our maker / maradas said which
of you dare Just against me / I am al ready said Naymes / Maradas said thou art
much presumptuous / For if I had such ten as thou art / I would confound
them al with my sword and bear their hedes to thadmyral / without gretely to
weary me / and after said to his felawes herkene hither syrs / I will that no
person of you moeue / For I allone will conquer them all / and after I shall
present them to ballant thadmyrall when rolland had herd he was almoost araged
for anger / and after said to Maradas / thou have folyly spoken / and thought
thing / which thou shall never see / or it be even you shall know what we can
do / keep the fro me for I deffye the / And when he had thus said he broched
his horse with his spores sharply / And they recountred so hard with their
speres square and sharp that it was great marvel that both were not deed
with y^ stroke their hawberks were al to broken / And with their swerdes they
smote the helmes rychely wrought / Rolland was so furyous that he he held
durandal and araught maradas upon his helm that he descerkled and departed it
/ and after by great force recouerd his stroke upon his bare head and clefte it
unto under his brain / and al deed maradas fyl down to therthe / when the
other saw king Maradas deed / and that Rolland would have borne away his
heed / they looked each on other / as al alasshed / and concluded to take
vengeance on the frensshe men / and ronnen upon rolland for to have put him to
death / but he deffended him over meruayllously / And there upon that one party
came upon that other / and held them in bataylle so valyauntlye / in especyal
the frensshe men against the sarasyns that all the paynyms were slain / and
none saved of the xv but one / which fled when he saw his fellows deed /
and went for to show how they were destroyed by the fre^ssh men / and never
cessed till he came to thadmyral / To whom thadmyral said / Sir king ye be well
hasty to return / tell me now how ye have done / That other said to him sir
admyrall by mahoun it gooth right evil beyond the bridge of mantryble we
recountred seven glotons of france which were men of king Charles al enraged /
and said that they came in his name to do a message unto you / and after they
ran upon us / and have done their deuoyr so gretely against us / that al be
deed sauf I / which am escaped with great pain for to come and show to you /
when thadmyral understood this he was almoost deed for sorrow of the death of
his kings aforesaid /

Of the meruayllous bridge of Mantryble / of the trybute there paid for to
pass over / and how with fair words ^e frenssh men passed over the said
bridge capitulo vij
When the frensshe men a foresaid had put to death the sarasyns they were al
trauaylled and weary / and went and rested them in a medowe al grene and full of
sweet flowers / and after said the duc naymes / my lords I (...) ylle you that
we return to Charles and say to him how we have done / and I wot well that he
shall be well content when he shall know how we have governed us / Then
Rolland answered and said / How Sir naymes speak ye of retornyng / Speak not
thereof / For as long as I may hold durandal in my hond by the playsyr of god
I think not to return / For we will do our message to ballant thadmyral how
someuer it be / and late us do one thing / whereof every man shall speak / late
each of us take one of these hedes / and we shall present them to thadmyral /
Naymes said to him / sir rolland it seems that ye he out of your wit / For
if we do so we shall be anon slain / Thyery and the other were of thoppynynyon
of Rolland / and so each of them took an head / and rode forth on their way /
Duc naymes was the first that went and beheld the bridge of mantryble which
was meruayllous as ye shall here / and said to his fellows / lords ye shall
understand that beyond the bridge is Aygremore / where we shall find
thadmyral / Ogyer the danoys said be byhoueth first to pass by this bridge
which is much dangerous / There ben xxx ar^^s of marble well spacyous and
broad which been soulded with had and cyment / and with great barees of iron /
wpon which bridge been great towers with fair pylers rychely ordained / and
the walls ben of great strength For at the lowest may well be mesured ten
else a bread / hit is so broad that xx knights may go arm in arem at their
ease / and there is a draw bridge for to draw up / which descends with ten
great chains of iron / And above on hye is an egle of gold much
replendysshaunte and shynyng like the son / that it seems that it were a
flame of fire which is seen a large mile ferce / and the river that passes
under is named flagot / which is byuethe the arche by mesure xv foot / and
renneth so Inpytuously as a quarrel out of an arbalastre / in such wise that
neither lote ne galeye may pass over for the great course of the water / And
more over this bridge is kept with a geau^te for thadmyral / which geaunte is
named Galafre / one of the most terryble of humayn people / And he holds a
great axe of stele for to destroy them that will do against his will / And
who that will speak with thadmyral must needs pass by him / Seygnours said
rolland doubt ye no thing I pray you care not for passing over the bridge /
For I swear to you that as long as it shall please god to sleep my body and
that I may hold durandal in my hand I shall not doubt any paynym the balewe
of a penny what someuer he be / And by god that henge on the cross I shall smite
the porter if he come tofore me what someuer shall hap / Duc naymes of bauyere
reprysed him / Rolland ye speak not wisely It is not good to give a stroke for
to receive therefore fyftene / late me do / For by the playsyr of god and of his
sayn^es I shall say to him such lesynges and other things that we shall pass
without danger / when the frensshe men came tofore the bridge / the porter
took an hundred knights and came and aualed the little bridge with as many
guysarmes and other glayues of defense / The first that went before was due
naymes / with his white heeres / for he was older than any of the other / Anon
the porter passed over and took Naymes by the hand and drew him over / and
after said to him / why there wylt thou goo / Naymes a^suerd I shall say you the
troth we be men of charles the noble emperor / and goo to Aygremore to do a
message to ballant thadmyral / But certeynly he has quytte his contreye of
falls people for it is not long time passed that on the field we fond xv
gloutons / which would have taken fro us our life and our horses Nevertheless we
have governed them in such manner that here ben the hedes / behold them well
when they be if ye believe me not when the porter herd him he was almoost out
of his wit for anger / and said to Naymes / vassal understand me / ye must
pay the passage of the bridge tofore al thing / Duc Naymes said / porter /
demand what ye ought to have / and we shall content you / by mahoun said the
porter it is not a little / For I ask of you xxx couple hounds after an C
maidens chaste and of good manners / an C fawcons mewed / an C palfroyes in good
point and rested / and for every foot of the horses a mark of fyn gold / and
at last I must have ii sommyers charged with gold and silver / thus ought ye
pay / or else come not here / and he that may not pay the trybute tofore
devised / he must lose his heed without other excusacyon / duc Naymes was not
abashed / Not withstondyng that he knew the occasyon that the porter sought
that they should deye / by cause that it was not possible to pay that he had
devised / and ansuerd to the porter in this manerr / and said / Sir porter if I
owe no more than ye have said ye shall be content or mydday be passed Our
bagayge comes after us / and harnoys more in nombre than an hundred thousand /
where there be maidens fair / and gentyl fawcons / and dogs great ple^te /
hawberks / helmes and good sheldes without nombre / And many other Iewellys
noble and rich / take of them as it shall playse your will / The portyer
supposed that he had said truth / and was well content and let the bridge
down / and after they passed over lightly Rolland which might not forbere
lawhyng said / In truth sir Duc Naymes ye have well spoken / for by lesynges
we pass this bridge / and rolland came behind all the other / and when they
were a little forth upon the bridge / Roulland encountered a Turk / and sithe
said in his courage / A lord god of paradys / late me do a thing whereof thou
may he honored and all thing hap well / and with out saying of any word
to his fellows / he lyghted down from his horse / and took thylke turk by the
myddel / and threw him bastely in to the river / Duc Naymes looked behind him
/ and saw the^paynym fall / and was much angry and said / lord god of heaven
I trow the devil is in the body of Roulland / he can have no pacyence in him
/ and if god help us not he shall cause us al to be slain and vylaynsly deye /
For Rolland was so fyers of courage that he took none head of the time ne the
place how to gruerne him / but would always avenge him on his enemy / where he
myt find him

How the barons came and spoke to the Admyrall / and how they did their message
capitulo viij
THe barons before said when they had passed the bridge and were nyghe unto
aygremore where as balla^t was they entered in to the town in good ordinance /
and with countenance of fyersnes and of noblesse / And they saw in the
streets fawcons and other birds of proye upon the perches / great oxen and
buefs slain and flayn fair hangyng and great swyn strangled / and they
recou^tred a sarasyn whom they demanded where thadmyral was And he showed him
to them / where he satte under a tree in the shadow / and then they alyghted
and duc Naymes said my fair lords I shall bear the letter and shall speak first
/ and ye after / Roulland was there and present him and would by force have
spoken first / and duc Naymes said to him / Say not one worrd for ye be al fro
your self without having attemperau^ce but god do not to us great grace ye
shall make us all to deye or the day be passed / And herupon they entered and
presented them al tofore the admyral without any reverence / And duc Naymes of
bauyere spoke first in this manner / The maker of all the world to whom only
out to be given creaunce entyere and honor / save and keep the noble king
charlemayn puyssau^t strong and wise emperor rolla^d and olyuer and all the
other pyeres of france / and confound fro the top of the head unto the
plants of the f^et the Admyral here present as much as tofore yesterday his
subgettes were evil pourueyed beyond y^ bridge of mantryble / we fond fyftene
glotons on the field which would have taken from us our horses / and do to us
vylonnye / but god of heaven be thanked they bought it gretely and dear when the
Admyral understood this langage / uneath he might keep him self fro enragyng
/ And there tofore him came the king that escaped / of whom I have spoken
tofore and said to thadmyral in this manner / Right dear sir think to aduenge
you / These been the seven glotons of which I told to you / which have slain
your kings / and have done to you such vylonnye The admyral Ballant ansuerd
late them be for this time / and sithe after said to Naymes the duc that he
should fynysshe his message / And the duc ansuerd that he so do would gladly /
and said in this manner / The great noble king of France commands the /
that thou render to him the crown with which the blessed Ihesu Christ was
crowned with / and the other relyques for whom he has taken great trauaylle
and pain / and also his knights whom thou hold in prison folysshly / and
if thou do not as I have to the devised / Charles shall make the to be hanged by
the neck on a gybet and strangled vylaynously / Thadmyral ballant replenysshed
of an entencyon much oultrageous / said to Naymes the duc / Thou have gretely
defouled me by oultrage / and I have wyllyngly herd the / Goo forth and sytte
down by yonde pyler / and these other shall speken whom I have not yet herd /
Mahommet my god to whom I have given my self / give me an evil death if ever I
ete or drynk till I see thy head flee fro thy sholdres / The duc Naymes ansuerd
if it playse god my maker and his blessed mother you shall have made a lesyng /
After him spoke Rychard duc of Normandye and said understand me sir admyral
Charles the king with his lerde florysshed comandeth the by me yt thou do the
baptyse for tamende thy right evil life / and that thou send to him the
relyques that thou have in thy puyssaunce / and also that thou render to him
his knights which thou hold without reason for prisoners / and if thou do
not as thou have herd charles shall do hang the by the neck on a gybet and
strangle y^ / and shall never have mercy on the / Thadmyral ballant supposed to
have known him and said thus maho^met in whom I believe curse the thou
resemblest well Rychard of normandye / which slew my uncle corsuble / Now would
Mahoun the god that he were here he should never ete mete till he were deed / Goo
and syfte down by thy fellow unto I have herd thy fellows / After this then
came basyn the genewey and stood tofore ballant and said / Ballant admyral the
noble charles above al humayn creatures redoubted commands the to render to
him the relyques which have been required of the / or else he shall do hang
and strangle the as a thief proved / when he had said thus / he went and satte
with the other / And after came thyerey duc of Ardayne and dyssymyled his
chyere and countenance of manner when thadmyral saw that he had the regard
so hydous / he was much abashed / and supposed that he had been a devil / And
after thyerry said / herkene to me admyral and reteyne well my words / Charles
the noble emperor redoubted commands the that thou send to him the
relyques / which thou barest away fro Rome / and also send unto him his
barons which thou have in thy power / or else be thou sure that he shall do
dysmembre the and do hang the vylaynsly by the neck / Thadmyral answered /
vassal I pray the to tell to me and hyde it not / what man is charlemayn and
of what force and strength is he of / the which I have herd much preysed
and haunted / Then the duc Thyerry ansuerd I tell to the admyral and let
the were / that Charles is noble and hardy curtoys and of good life / And be
thou sure that if he were present here with his excersyte / much sone he should
give the a buffet upon thy vysage / And on that other side he sets no more by
the tha^ of an old hou^de deed / or of a roten apple / Incontinent tho /
ballant the admyrall bygan to lawhe for felonnye / and after said to Thyerry /
My friend by thy faith that thou owe to the god / say to me now the troth /
if I were now in thy will and subgectyon / as thou art in mine / by thy faith
what would thou do with me / by my faith said Thyerry I shall not lie / I
should do hang the by the neck and strangle the vylaynsly on a gybet or it
were yet night / Vassal said the Admyrall / thou have said great folly / For by
Mahommet my god / in like wise shall I do of the / as thou have said of thy
self / Goo thou and sytte by thy felawes /

Then after him came the good Ogyer the danoys tofore him / and said / O
Admyral of Spaygne understand what Charles the most noble of humayn creatures
and most rich without comparyson demands of the / Render and yield to him
the relyques which thou have borne away or else he shall do dysmembre the and
do the deye shamefully / Thadmyral being al wroth made him to sytte with the
other / After him rolland the courageous came tofore Ballant thadmyral without
doing to him any reverence and said to him / Thou sarasyn unhappy and cursed
take heed to my words / Charles the noble king and Emperor redoubted sends
to the by me / that thou believe in god Ihesu christ the maker of all the world
and in the glorious vyrgyn marie his mother / and do the to be baptized / and
think to render the relyques which thou occupyest and atteynest against his
will And also see that his barons be rendered and delyuerd hole and in good
point / For if thou do otherwise than I have said to the / Charles the
valyaunte shall make the to be hanged as a thief / Thadmyral said to him thou
have rebuked and blamed me proudly / but I swear to the by Mahoun my god and by
Termagaunte / that I shall not ete till thou be hanged and strangled Then
Rolland answered / for truth sarasyn if thou abide to that hour / thou
sholdest fast over long / Thou shall not do so For I doubt the not the
valor of an old deed hounde and drowned / Guy of bourgoyn came after him
tofore ballant thadmyral and said to him in this manner / Charles commoundeth
the that thou make to him ob^yssaunce / and that thou restore the relyques and
his barons / and then shalt thou do as a wise man / and if thou wylt believe
me / I will well counceyl the / Believe in god Ihesu Christ which is almighty
wych ^ute end and without beginning And if thou byleuest my counceyl thou
may be in his grace And to what thou shall do / take of thy robe / thy hosen
and thy shoon of thy body and goo in thy (...) and bear on thy body a sadel of
an horse / and rest not till thou come before the face of Charles and humbly
present thy self to him / and cry for mercy to god thy maker almighty for
thyn errors and oultrages /

And cry him mercy in the honor of god almighty / and if thou do not thou as
I have said / he shall make the be hanged burnt / or drowned / and shameflluy
to dye /

The Admyrall was more do termyned and araged than he had been tofore / and
sent anon for Brullant de Mommyere / Sortybrant do conymbres and for the other
that were of his counceyl / and demanded their aduys and counceyl upon these
things aforesaid / Anon for tybrant said to him / Sir admyral I counceylle
you / that anon they be dysmembred and slain and after ye may goo and ride
with your strength oueral and come to mormyonde where charles is pensyf / if
ye may take him / ye shall put him to death / After ye shall descend in to
france / and do you be crowned there as king / by mahoun said ballant ye have
well said / Now be it done after your deuyse / goo in to the prison and bring
with you the other their fellows / for to do after the enterprise / And thus as
I have said / Thadmyral was of entencyon to make of the frensshe men aforesaid
/ after that is tofore devised /

How by the moyen of florypes all the frensshe men were saved and lodged to
gydre and the relyques showed and other things capitulo ix
FLoripes the curtoys / after that she had well secretly herd all the debate to
foresaid / she came out of her chamber / and salewed her fader / and demanded
of him what been these knights set there a part / Thadmyral ansuerd my
daughter they be borne in france the which have said to me words of great
Importance full of reproaches / and have blamed me and offended gretely / more
than I can tell you or say / what cou^ceyl give ye to me that I ought to do
Ioyth them / The daughter said I shall say to you my fader that ye without
long taryeng do smite of their heedes / for they have well deserved it / And do
smite of their hondes and brenne them in a fire without your cite / my daughter
said the admyral ye have right well said / right so shall it be done / Goo ye in
to the prison / and bring to me the other / good fader ansuerd the daughter it
is time to dyne / and if ye will begin to do Justice / ye may not ete till
mydday be passed / This daughter sought none other thing but occasyon by fair
words according to the will of her fader thadmyral for to bring all the
frensshe men to gyder with them that were prysonners / And after said to her
fader give to me these Frensshe men / I shall make them well to be kept / and
after your dinner ye shall do Justice with less tedyacyon and then your
people shall be assembled To the which the Admyral consented / And was content
thyt his daughter should have them in keeping / Always sortybra^t which knew the
mutabylyte of wommen and thynconstaunce said to Ballant Sir Admyral it is no
thing couenable that upon this fayte ye ought trust in a woman by cause of
their mutabylyte / and ye have often berd say ensaumples and also ye know the
truth how many have been deceived by wymmen / Much angry and evil content was
floripes of the words of Sortybrant / And said horson Traitor desloyal
pariured / if I thought not it should torn me to ouermoche blame / I should give
to the such a buffet on thy vysage / that the blood should auale down
habundauntly And after these words thadmyral was evil content of this debate
/ And thereupon she took the frensshe men and ladde them (...) to her chamber
without any longer taryeng / And going by the way / Sir naymes the due said /
A god of heaven king of eternal glory / who is he that ever saw a more fayrer
lady in his life / Much well should he he Inspyred with the grace of god that
shall have her in his courage in love / Rolland was evil content and said to
Naymes / what hundred thousand of deuyls has maad you to speak now of love /
It is not now time to speak of such thing / Due Naymes said thus / Sir
Rolland dysplese you not / For I was ones amerous / the douter said to them
that they were not assembled to plede that one against that other / and also
sone as they were within the chamber / the daughter made to shette fast the
yatrs / and anon rolland met with Olyuer and enterbraced each other and
kyssed with frank and tender / heart in weeping much tenderly / and all the
other semblably / and Rolland said / Alas Olyuer my faithful fellow / how is it
with you sithe I last saw you / Right well answered Olyuer / and each demanded
of other of their feats / of the contreyes and of their lords and tidings /
Now ye may think that they were glad each of other / that they were al
together in good point by the moyen of Florypes the fair lady / which did
great socours to crystendom / when by her / her wysedom and dyscrescyon the
captain of the christian faith / as much as touches the excersyte of bataylle
to destroy the myscreauntes and paynyms ben founded all together in surete /
which first were comen in to the hondes of their enemies mortal / But it is
great science for to eschew the will of a woman / when by effect she puts
her entente to a thing that her heart dyrectly draws / and takes no regard
to the end of her entente / but only that she may achyeue her enterprise and
determynacyon / Florypes retched of no thing / but that she myt have tidings
certain of guy of bour goyne / to whom she had given her heart / and was
content to be crystened for the love of him This fair Florypes when she saw
these barons to gydre / she said to them / lords I will that ye all of one
^coorde promise to me the faith of loyalte / that ye shall aid and help me of
that I shall demand you / and toward me ye shall truly bear and endeuoyre you /
Right gladly ansuerd due Naymes / and also ye shall assure us / that we shall be
here in surete without any doubt of any man living / she was content and
they were content / and promised fydelyte that our to the other / when this
was done / the daughter came to duc naymes for to know what he was / and
demanded of him his name / the duc said to her Madame I am called Naymes of
bauyere / Man and counceyllour to Charles the Emperor redoubted / Alas said
the douter your king is sorry for you / After she came to Rychard and demanded
of him how he was named / he ansuerd to her / dame I am Rychard of Normandye
the daughter said to him Mahomet curse the / thou put to death on a time
corsuble mine uncle / But for the love of these other thou shall be in no
danger Florypes came after to rolland and prayed that he would tell his name /
I am named rolland said he / sone to duc Myllon / and am neuewe to charles /
sone of his sister / Anon the daughter cried him mercy and kneled down to his
feet / and Rolland took her swetely up / After the daughter said ye know what
ye have promised to me / I shall say to you mine entencyon / It is truth that I
love a knight of france ^boue al them of the world / which is named guye of
bourgoyne / of whom I would gladly have tidings / rolland said I swear to you
by my head that he is here in your sight / and that there is not between you
tweyne the space of four foot of mesure / Seynours said she I pray you that I
may know him / and that he be given to me for of him is all my playsyr /
Rolland ansuerd and said sir guy of bourgoyne / come ye hither to this maid
and receive her Ioyously / Guy of bourgoyn ansuerd / god forbede that ever I
should take wife / But if she were given to me by Charles the emperor / when
Florypes understood him / anon she changed color and swear maho^met her god
that if he gaynsayed it she should make them all to be hanged by the neck on a
gybette / Rolland enhorted Guye that he should do her will / and upon that he
advanced him and has granted / Then florypes said / the sone of god of
crystyante be preysed and honored / For I have tofore mine eyes the most
grettest playsyr that ever mine heart desired / For his love I shall believe in
Ihesu Christ / and shall do me be baptized / and after she approached to him for
to treat a little the desire of her heart and she durst not kiss him on the
mouth but on his chekes and chynne by cause she was a paynym / Then florypes
Ioyously and by great love came unto a cheste and opened it tofore the barons /
and spredde a fair cloth of sylke / And after she dysclosed and she wed the
relyques of which I have spoken tofore / emonge whom was the glorious crown
with which Ihesu christ was crowned with in the time of his passion / and the
holy naylles which perced his holy hands and feet / and after said to Rolland
/ Loo here is the tresour that ye have so much desired / when the frensshe men
saw thus tofore them the relyques / For Joy they all wept much tenderly /
and one after the other went and kyssed them knelyng much humbly / and after
they were laid in to the cheste where as they had been tofore /

How Lucafer neuewe of the admyral vyolently entered in to the chamber / and
after was slain of duc Naymes in blowyng of the cool capitulo x
BAlla^t thadmyral being much wroth and sitting at the table A paynym fyers
and proud / a specyal friend of thadmyral named lucafer of bandas said to
thadmyral affectuously / Sir admyral is it truth that I have herd say / that
Fyerabras your sone / and my right dear brother is taken and vaynquysshed /
which was the best knight that ever was a live / Thadmyral said to him by my
faith I shall not hyde it fro you / A frensshe man has conquered him / whom
maboun confound / Brullant of Mommyere made great deffence and the king of
Sulye / They ^are them so well that they brought to us five of the gloutons of
france / knights of Charles which ben in prison / and sithe right now we
have other seven which ben comen as messagers fro the said charles / which
have vytupered and blamed us gretelye in reprochyng out law and despysyng my
gods / Florypes my daughter has conduyted them in to prison / sir said
lucafer ye do great folly / wymmen al day for little thing ben changed and
turned fro their thout / nevertheless for the more surete if it playse you / and
by your commandment I shall goo to them / and shall know what they be / and of
what condycion Goo forth said thadmyral ye say right well / and make my daughter
to return with you / herupon lucafer much proud and replenysshed with great
fyersnes came in to the chamber where the douter was and the frensshe men /
without demaundyng to opene the door / but lift up his right foot / and smote
it so strongely with his foot / that the bars and locks flewe unto the
ground / when Florypes saw that / she was al abashed / And anon said to
Rolland / Sir noble knight / I am right evil content of the vyole^ce that is
thus done to me / this is he that should be my husband ageyn my will I require
you in as much as ye will do me playsyr / that ye will avenge this dishonor /
For I complain me without making ouermoche cuyl semblaunte / to whom Rolland
answered / doubt ye no thing madame / For or he depart hens / he shall know
that he has evil done / And I promise you that he bought never lock so dear
ne of the prys as he shall for the brekyng hereof / Hereupon Lucafer entered in to
the chamber / and be held the frensshe men al armed without any doubt that he
had to them / And came first to duc Naymes which was dyscouerd and bare head /
and without other delyberacyon took him by the berde and drew him to him so
boystously / that almoost he had overthrown him / and after said to him / of
whens art thou veyl lard hyde it not fro me / The duke Naymes ansuerd paynym I
am of bauyere and that is my contree / and am specyal counceyllour of
Charlemayne / And al these barons that been here been al earls and great lords
/ and ben comen for to show to balla^t the admyral a message fro the said
charles redoubted Emperor / and by cause that we have not spoken to his
entencion / he has made us prysonners / Nevertheless take your hand from my
berde / ye have hold me long enough / And be ye sure that I say not all that I
think / The paynym ansuerd I am content thy folly be pardonned the / but I
demand of the by thy loyalte what manner folk been they of france / and of
what enterprise and what plays use they when they been in your royame / In
truth said the duc / when the king has dyned / who that will may goo play
where him list Sum ride out on horsback and sum goo in to the feldes and
sing / other make good chere at tables / at the chesse / and other playsaunte
games / and in the morn every man gooth gladly and hereth mass at the hour
when it is said / and been well charytable to give alms to y^ pour people
largely / and customably / Also when they goo to bataylle they been fyers and
hardy and been not lightly vaynquysshed Such been the people in the contreye of
crystente / lucafer began to lawhe and said / by my god Mahoun vylayne and old
dotard that thou art / thou spekest folysshly / It is no thing so of your
feat / ne frensshe men be of no valor / but if they can blow at the great
cole / In troth said the duc I herd never thereof / the Paynym ansuerd I shall
teache you the manner / and he approached to the duc nyghe by a great fire / and
in going Rolland made sign to the duc / that he should bear him well / Anon
lucafer took the grettest bronde that was on the fire / And blewe so sharply
that the fire flewe all about habundantly / and after said to duc naymes /
that he must also blow / The Duc took the bronde / and knew well the manner
that the paynym would hurt him and approached to him / and blewe the bronde so
puyssauntly that it fyl al on a flame and came to the vysage of the Paynym in
such wise that it br^^te al his berde / when the paynym saw that he was
almoost out of his wit for anger / The Duc Naymes with that smote him with
the bro^de in the neck that he brake the bone / and so raught him with so
great might that his eyes flewe out of his ^^ed to the ground and said to him
Falls creature that thou art / whom I byseche god confou^de thou wendest to
have made me to muse in thy folyes / Now (...) there with sorrow / Rolland said
to him by my faith sir duc / (...) can well play and blow atre cole / blessed
be that arm that gaf that stroke / Lords said duc Naymes / if I have maad him
to understand his folly ye ought not to blame me / ye have soon how he truffed
with me Florypes the curtoys came ner unto duc Naymes / And said Certes sir ye
be worthy to be honored / I see well that Lucafer has no more charge to play
with you at the cole / he is now at his ease / I see well that he remeueth not /
And I wot now that he never shall have great desire to espouse me / For by
force he would have had me / and my fader had given me to him / but never would I
have suffered it / but father have mine head smyton of / or suffered vylaynous death

How by the counceyl of floripes the frensshe men dyslodged thadmyral fro his
paleys with great bataylle / and how by enchauntement a gyrdle was taken away
fro the douter ca xi
FLorypes was wise and had consyderacyon that Lucafer which was deed was well
byloued with thadmyral and said to the frensshe men lords know ye for truth
/ that my fader loves more this man than any man living / he abides for him
to come to dinner / and will not be at ease till he shall be returned / and if by
adventure he know what is done / ye shall be here encombred and assaylled and
all the gold of the world shall not redeem you but that ye shall be deed /
wherefore I cou^ceyl you that ye do arm you and put you in point / take lytly
your helmes and your sheldes For people that been armed be much redoubted of
other unarmed / therefore I will not that ye be closed ne shette herin / when ye
come in the paleys where thadmyral is / See that ye bear you and behave you so
/ that ye be masters and lords of the place and then shall ye be well lodged
/ when the daughter had thus said they were right well content / and prestly
armed them and gyrde their swerdes about them / And two and two issued out of
the chamber / and goon corageously as lions / boystously as wulues hungry / in
such wise as they that would abide them onght sore to doubt and have great
fere / And they went out at the time that the son went under / and between
night and day / And the formest of them in the way was rolland and the other
followed him ryt fyersly for to fight / Roulland cried to his fellows that each
man should do his part and slay all the paynyms and sarasyns that they fond in
the paleys / which faylled not / Roulland smote corsuble mortally / Olyuer put
to death the king Coldroe / There was not one but that they all bare them well /
The soupper which was well appointed / anon was turned up so down and cast to
the ground / cups of gold and of silver slew and sowned in the place /
Sarasyns goon to therthe slain and dysmembred / Other lepe out of the wyndowes
/ which after were founden deed / Other were all to hewn / sholdres and
legs smyton of / Thadmyral all araged put him self to flight out of a
wyndowe / and lepe down in to the deep dyche / Rolland went after which had
him gretely at the heart / and supposed to have smyten him / And atteyned the
marble stone of the wyndowe in such wise that his sword entered a foot deep /
Brother said Olyuer the admyral is escaped fro you / Certain ansuerd Rolland /
thereof am I evil content Nevertheless they did so great portement and bare them
so well that they were lords and masters of the chyef toure of the castle and
palace / And after shetted fast the yates / and were all sure without danger
/ Sauf they might have no mete / This passed a little while the Admyral was in
the dyches al affrayed and if there had not be sum for to have drawn him
out / he had never departed / and began to cry to his men that they should
come to him to draw him out Brullant of mommyere / and sor tybra^t of
conymbres drew him out / And after that said Sortybrant / Sir Admyral believe
me another time / Always attetayl of an old dog keep you Thadmyrall answered
I pray you scorn me no more / I shall well aduenge me or two months be passed
/ Do sown to assault for tassaylle the toure Sortybrant said it is reason
that your will be done / but the nyt is over nyghe / by mine aduys it is better
to abide till to morrow And then your excersyte shall be assembled for to work
more surely / thadmyral was content and said by great dysplaysau^ce Ha fair
Lucafer / never shall I see you more / I have lost (...) my Joy / O ye
frensshe men accursed be ye / ye have taken him away fro me / but by Mahoun my
god to whom I have given my life / to morn shall the syege be laid tofore the
toure / And I shall never depart for none evil wether that shall come / He for
thing that may be / till the toure be taken / and the walls laid on the earth
/ And I shall make the frensshe men to be drawn at the taylles of my horses And
after I shall make florypes the putayn to be burnt in a fire openly / and I am
well sure that they shall yield them / For they be not vytaylled scar^ for four
days / And of that other part I know well they may have no socours of no man
what someuer he be / For we hold the strong bridge of mantryble / and they
may have no socours but if it come over that bridge / and of that other part
charles shall have no tidings of his barons / ne shall not know whether they
be deed or a live / or in lyberte or in subiectyon / and here vpen they
concluded and went to their lodgys till on the morn And on the morn erly
thadmyral sen^e for all his subgettes / and concluded to lay the syege and
swear to hold it seven year long but if he had of them his will Then came
there so many paynyms in the contreye about / that their lodgyses held four
mile of space / ye may think in what danger the frensshe men were / which
were but twelve persons only / and had none other conduyte ne comfort / but
to be within assyeged in great peril of famyne / Nevertheless always where as
the sarasyns did gretely their deuoyr for to enter / yet they could no thing
gryeue them Thadmyral called one marpyn a much falls thief emonge all humayn
creatures and said to him Marpyn by the berde that I bear on my chynne / if
thou may do so much as for to stele away the gyrdle that Florypes bears I
shall reward and give to the largely of my gold and silver / and thou shall be
my great friend / For if I may have it I am sure that the frensshemen shall sone
be deed for hungre / and then may they no more grieve me / That gyrdle was of
such virtue / that as long as it should have du red within the toure / they
within should never have be famyned / Sir said the thief abide till it be night /
and I swear to you that to morn or the son arise / I shall show to you the
gyrdle and shall deliver it to you / and herupon when it was night he entered
secretlye in to the dyches / which were full of water / and passed over / and
after when he was at the foot of the toure / much subtylly with his engynes he
mounted up in to the wyndowes / and entered in to the toure / and took a candel
and after came to the chamber of Florypes and fond it fast shette / But with
falls and dyabolyke wor^es he opened it / and when he was within / he saw that
al y^ barons were fast a sleep and he made so enchauntements that for no thing
they might awake / and then he came to Florypes / and serched so pryuely that
he took the gyrdle and after gyrde him self with al / and after this he beheld
the daughter al naked which was much fair / and was enclyned anon to have
defouled her / and began to take her about the neck / which suddenly awoke
and began to cry much strongely and called her maidens and the barons /
wherefore the maidens came anon alabasshed and aferde / and when they saw
marpyn the thief as black as a moore / the most hardyest of them began to
flee / A non as Guye of Bourgoyn herd the boys of florypes / he came to her
with his naked sword in his hand / and escryed to her that she should not be
aferde of any thing / And he came so well to point / that if he had not come
the thief had defowled florypes but as soon as the thief herd him he sprange
out of the bed with great haste / and Guye of bourgoyne recountred him and
gaf him so great a stroke that he clefte him by the myddel and cut a two the
gyrdel and the candel quenched / The other barons came after / and when they
saw the work and the thief deed / they threw the body in to the sea with the
gyrdle / And when it was known that he had stolen the gyrdle and was lost
with him in the sea / there was much sorrow for the loss of so noble a Jewel
/ And Florypes wept right sore saying / that the loss of the gyrdle may never
be reconuerd / Nevertheless the barons with fair words comforted her in such
manner that they all were content /

How the barons were assyeged in the toure with Florypes and her maidens which
suffered great hungre / and how the gods by them were confounded capitulo xij
When the day was comen and thadmyral saw not Marpyn thenchauntour return he
was much abashed and demanded brullant / Sortybrant and his other lords
counceyl what he should do / considered that Marpyn was not returned Sortybrant
said / Sir admyral know ye for certain that the thief is deed / sithe he is
not returned and comen / but I counceyl you that ye do soune your trompettes
for tassemble your subgettes / for tassaylle the toure and confound the
christian men / And with slings and other engynes they do cast stones: darts
enuenymed / but blessed be god the frensshe men doubted them no thing / After
they had continued the syege a while / bread and wyn began to faylle to the
barons and maidens / m such wise that they had no thing to ete / Then the
sorrow of the maidens which were so fair and full of compassyon was over great
/ and were al desolate And emonge the other the noble florypes was much
dysplay saunte for the necessyte of the frensshe men / of her self / and of her
damoyselles / often times she swowned and fyl to ground as deed / Guy of
bourgoyne her spouse that should be / took her up much swetely / and
recomforted her to his power / and said to his felawes / My brethern and lords
/ ye see the necessyte that we suffer / it is now three days passed sith we had
any bread / And yet it greueth me more for these damoyselles than for my self /
And I say you for truth that I may no longer e^dure but if we do otherwise /
And be ye sure that I had lever to put my body in adventure to be hurt and
wounded mortally than I should abide here within enclosed with this melancolye /
wherefore I say late us goo out for to get sum vytaylle / for better is to us
to deye with honor than to live with shame / All the frenssh men were of
thoppynyon of guy There upon Florypes said / My lords I wot now well that your
god is of little power / when he gives to you none aid ne comfort / And I say
you well that if ye had adoured our gods / they had pourueyed for you mete and
drink / Tofore that she had fynysshed her words Roulland ansuerd and said /
Madame I pray you / that ye show to us your gods that ye speak of / And if
they have the power that ye say / that they may give to us mete and drink /
and that they do so much that the puyssaunce of fraunco come hither for to
socoure us / we shall al believe on them without varyeng / The maid said anon
ye shall see them / and Incontinent after that she had taken the kayes / she
ladde the barons under the earth and showed to them the gods of the sarasyns
/ which were in a place much noble precious and rich / And there were in
great mageste Appolyn Mahoun / and Termagaunt / the god Margot and Iupyn / and
many other which were all massy of fyn gold of Arabye / enorned with many
Iewellys Odoraunt of bame and encence / and many other tresours were there
assembled / Guy of bourgoyne said when he saw so great tresour / A lord god
who would have wend that in this place had be so great richesse assembled /
would god that Rychard of normandye had now Aupyn in his cite of Roan / For he
should well accomplysshe with it / the church of the holy Trynyte / And that
king charles had the other gods / he should repair ageyn y^ church of rome
which is destroyed / And with the remenaunte he should make men rich and to
set them in good point / Florypes ansuerd and said / Sir Guye ye speak
vylaynsly / against the gods / cry them mercy and adoure them / to the end
that they enclyne them to you to do you comfort / guy said unto her / I can
not pray to them Madame / for I see their eyes al a sleep / and ye shall see
that they may not here ne see / and therwyth he smote Iupyn And Ogyer danoys
smote margot that they flewe to the (...) / and were anon all to broken /
wherefore Roulland said to the daughter / In truth madame I see that ye have
gods that be not worth / of them that been fallen to therthe I see not one of
them remeue ne make semblau^te to releue him / Fro then forthon Florypes had
al their gods in despyte and byleued in Ihesu Christ saying thus / I see sir
Roulland that ye say the very truth / but if ever I believe on them I will
that my body come to an evil end / and with good heart I require that god that
was borne of a vyrgyn / of whom ye have informed me / that he send to you
socours of france / and that we find manner to get vytalle for to satysfye
our hungre /

How the peers of France went out of the toure / and did a great bataylle / In
which they recouerd twenty sommyers charged of vytaylle capitulo xiij
When Florypes had said she fyl down to the erch a swoune for sorrow and
anguysshe / wherefore guy of bourgoyn wept much soroufully for the love of her /
Hreupon Olyuer the courageous came tofore them and said / My lords I you
assure by the god that suffered death for creatures humayn / I had lever that my
body were quartred / and smyton in pyece^ than I should suffer this prison / but
that I should fight quyckely with the paynyms / and semblably said rolland
wherefore without other delyberacion they set their sheldes in good point /
and mounted on horsluck and aualed the bridge / and with a steadfast courage
made them ready / and when they were all before the toure of marble / Rolland
said to the other / Sir Naymes or ye sir Ogyer it by^houeth that one of yon
abide for to keep the place / that at the retornyng we may enter surely / The
Duke Naymes could take no pacyence but that he an swerd thus / Sir Roulland
think not that I be so unhappy of person ne of lygnage / that ever I should be
reproched and that ever I should be your portyer /

I will not do so in no wise though I be old yet can I torn mine horse / For I
am hard of synewes / and have mine heart well assured / and will be hardy enough
for to smite upon mine enemies wha^ time shall reqnyre ne doubt ye no thing
thereof / Rolland ansuerd sir ye say well ye shall come with us / Thyerry or
geffroy / that one of you two shall abide / but it was not their playsyr to
abide enclosed / Nevertheless at the request of Rolland thyerry abode with
geffroy which shetted the yates surely after that the other barons were
without / which each with his shield tofore him and sword in his hand went
mustryng them tofore the castle / Thadmyral lokyng out at a wyndowe knew the
frensshe men / wherefore hastily he sent for brullant and sortybrant to come to
him with other / to whom he said my barons and subgettes / the frensshe men
ben comen and me seems they will fight / if they be not al slain I shall be evil
content wherefore do sown your horns for tassemble your people / ye ^ary over
long / And as soon as they had so done / a great multitude of sarasyns were
there assembled and came and assaylled the frensshe men / But rolland that
held durandal in his hand / with his fellows came upon the mastyn sarasyns by
such a furour / that in a little while moo than an hundred were slain / For
unhappy was he that came to socoure the sarasyns / Then came Claryon which
was neuewe to the admyral with / xv thousand fyghtyng men / And know ye for
certain that in that time in spayn was no sarasyn more doubted than he / when
the barons saw him come Rolland escryed gherard / Ogyer / and Guy O noble
knights in thonour of god each of you do so his deuoyr, that at this time with
vyctorye we may obtain vytaylle for the maidens in the toure / That said /
Rolland smote his horse with his spores / and with durandal smote a fyers Paynym
named Rampyn so myghtely that he cla^te head and body at a stroke / whereof
they yt were there present were abashed / and then the sarasyns doubted so
strongly rolland that there was not a man durst put him self tofore him / but
if he thought to deye / Gherard of mondydyer said / my brethern and lords /
who will here after have playsyr and be honored / it is ty^e that he show him
for often by one unhappy man a halyaunt man is in danger / wherefore with that
word al these barons were much more fervent tha^ they had be / to the end that
every man showed him self such as he out to be / and after that y^ battle was
fynysshed for that day / as god would the barons fond by the tour aforesaid a
great adventure / For they saw pass by the castle xx sommyers laden with
vytayl / that is to say bread / wyn venyson / and other vytaylles ynow and a
paynym conduyted them of margote unto the sarasyns / but Incontyne^t the ledars
of the sarasyns and of their vytayl were slain anon of the barons and the due
Naymes and wyllyam the scot conduyted and led them forth / And Rolland and
the other came and avoided the place in such wise that they were driven in to
the tour / but this thing was not done without danger and great pain /

How guy of bourgoyn was taken of the sarasyns / beten vylaynously and
demanded of thadmyral / and the complayntes that Florypes made for him and
other matters capitulo xiiij
AS I have said tofore the barons of france thus as they went in their
repair / and ladde the sommyers before said / there came so great habundaunce
of men of arms of the party of king Claryon / that it was merueylle / There
was then an hard and strong recountre in so much that due basyn was slain
and Aulbery his sone / For when he saw his fader deye / Incontyne^t he fyl
upon him and there he was slain and abode / and yet this was not the most harm
/ For the noble guy of bourgoyn after that he was menaced of king Claryon / he
auau^ced him for to smite him that came him so evil to pass that his horse was
slain under him of the paynyms / and suddenly he was enuyronned of moo tha^ an
hundred knights sarasyns which took him and took of his helm fro his head /
and after bound his eyes so that he saw nothing and led him forth his hands
bounden behind him o^ his back and when guy saw him thus deteyned he began
to cry with an hye voys / O Jesus very god which have made and formed me /
whyther goo I now / that am evil fortuned / O Ihesus comfort me / O noble
Charlemayn right noble emperor and mine uncle thou shall never see me / The
king claryon said to him Fair friend no thing shall avail the / thy cryeng ne
thy brayeng / I shall deliver the al living to the admyral of spayn this day /
And to morn thou shall be hanged /

But now ye may well think how the other peers of France his fellows were evil
content when they saw the Earl Guye so prysonner / Nevertheless they did
great feats of arms or they were constrained to e^tre in to the tour / and
as soon as they were descended and the yates barred eueryche went to dinner / and
then floripes came anon to rolland and said to him / sir rolland I require you
that ye say to me where is sir guye of bourgoyne my husbond become / I wot well
when ye departed hens that he went with you emonge the other ye ought to bring
him to me a geyn / I shall never be Joyous at the heart till I know where he is
Rolland ansuerd ha Florypes curtoys lady / in him trust ye no more / for certes
ye have lost him ye shall never see him / the paynyms have led him maulgre us
/ and we know not what they will do with him / florypes heeryng these words
for sorrow and anguysshe fyl to the earth all a swoune more than iiij times as
deed / but rolland which wept for her / often releued her / and when she was
risen / she began to cry with an hye voys / O barons of france by that god
that maad heaven and earth / if I have not gny of bourgoyn to whom I ought to
be married / I shall yield this toure or the next day be passed O holy vyrgyn
marye I should be espoused to him and for love of him be baptized and be christian
/ Alas our loves have sone faylled / This sorrow has made me well to forgete
the hungre that I have had these iij days / Alas I am unhappy / Rolland might
not see the melancolye of this Florypes / but promised her to make her glad
within ij days for then at ferthest she should see sir guye at her playsyr
/ and that she should no thing doubt thereof / for know ye surely said rolland
/ I had lever to be quarterd than he should not come ageyn / and he shall be
rendered to you or his death shall be sore avenged and madame ye know well that
your sorrow and weeping may not bring him ageyn / and ye wot well that it is
three days passed sith we ete / we have purchaced vytayl for us and these
damoyselles of whom ye see the pity / late us take pacyence of the little
quantyte / and be we content to entretiene the life / for ye out to know that
they might not recouure the sommyers with vytaylle by cause of the trouble of
guy of bourgoyne which was deteyned prisoner / After that Rolland had said
this / the barons and the daruoyselles thanked god of al and fed them
suffysauntlye in praysyng and lawdyng god deuoutelye /

Now late us speak a little of Guye of bourgoyn which was led tofore the
admyral / much troubled / dyscolourd / and changed of vysage was the said
Guye by cause he had not eten in three days tofore / and for yt danger that he
felt him to be in the hands of his enemies / and there tofore the admyral he
was al despoyled of his arms / and then appyered his body well membred / and
ballant demanded what was his name / and who he was / the baron ansuerd
Admyral I fere not to say the truth / I am called guy of bourgoyn subgette to
the crown of france / and cosyn germayn to rolland the valiant / which is
the man that ought well to be doubted / balla^t ansuerd I know the well enough /
it is more than vij months goon that my douter has had the in great love /
which dyspleseth me gretely / and I know well that she loves the more tha^ any
man living / and I for that love have lost many men of great facion / and am
put out of my tour the chyef strength of al my contreye / but if al be yolden
to me ageyn shortly / y^ shall be quarterd in short time and dysme^bred and
more over I demand yt thou say to me the truth / who been they that been
enclosed in the tour of whom we have been assaylled with so daungerously / Guy
ansuerd gladly I shall say to the / Be thou well sure that rolland the valyaunte
is there / Olyuer his fellow right courageous / Thyerry duc of Ardayne /
Rychard of Normandye / Gherard of Mundydyer / Naymes dne of bauyere / and basyn
the genewey whom ye have slain / but by the grace of god and help of charles
his death shall be to you dear sold Thadmyral was ryt evil content of the
menaces of Guye / wherefore a much fyers sarasyn took his fyste / and smote
guye on the vysage in such wise that the blood issued out of his nose and
mouth habu^dantly with that stroke guy was set a fire for anger and furour
and left not / for to be forthwith quartred and he was not holden / but that
he took that same sarasyn by the heir with one of his hands / and with that
other hand ^e smote him upon the great bone of yt neck behind that he struck
it / And without moeuyng of hand or foot he fyl down deed to the ground
tofore the admyral / Ballant was so evil content with that broke that he was
al enraged for the death of the paynym as for the mysprysyng that guy had done
in his presence tofore his eyes and cried with a loud voys that he should be
taken / and as soon as he had said the word / the sarasyns as wulues enraged /
which with their feet and hands al to beat him / in such wise that he knew
not where he was / And had slain him if the admyra^ had not commanded them /
that he should not be put to death in such manner /

^How the paynyms had purposed to have hanged Guye of bourgoyne / seeing the
christian men / which socoured him mytely capitulo xv
AFter that guye of bourgoyn was well bounden and straytly / Thadmyral sent to
come to him brullant of mommyere Sortybrant of conymbres and for many other of
his cou^ceyl and said to them / my friends / I pray you that ye give to me
counceyl what I ought to do with this prysonner / which does me so great
reproach and despysyng as ye see and know / Sir said Sortybrant I shall give to
you good connceyl if ye will believe me / ye shall do reyse up a galowe tree
nyghe to the dyches of the toure in which been the prysonners of france / and
to morn ye shall do hang this prisoner / and see that ye have in a secret
place nyghe unto yt said galowes and thousand turks well armed and in good
point / and I am sure that the freysshe men be so hardy and out of mesure /
that when they shall see their fellow for to be hanged they shall come out for
to socoure him / and your people that shall be hid in the busshement shall come
out on them and take them / Then shall ye have them al surely for to do with
your playsyr / this counceyl was approved by thadmyral to be good / and was
therwyth well content / wherefore without taking of any other delyberacy on /
the galowes were made as before is said / and right nyghe to the place / was a
little wode / and let put therein secretly xx / M / fyghtyng men / and commanded
them to be governed by the king claryon and other capytayns / and after
thadmyral made guy of bourgoyne to be led with xxx sarasyns unto the galowes
/ which cessed not to beat and smite on him with great staves which grieved
him sore / and they bond his hands behind his back much straytly / and
when he felt a great cord about hih neck / and his eyes bounden and saw no
thyuge whyther he went / This thynkyng with an hye voys he began to cry / O
redemptour of the world / my maker and my god for whose name I am in pain and
goo to deye an evil death / the merit of thy passion take my soul in to thy
keeping / for the body takes his end / And like as I have need of thy help /
So I beseech and require the to counceyll and comfort me / O noble barons of
fraunco ye shall never see me / if ye suffer me to be hanged it shall be to you
great shame / O Roulland fair cosyn remember me / or else shall ye never see me
on live / he thus saying and other pyetous words Rolland was in a wyndowe and
beheld over a little rock and saw the galowes raised / wherefore he came to
his felawes and said / I meruaylle much what this meneth that I have seen the
galowes set upon the dyches / I wot never to what purpoos it is done when
the other had seen it / Duc naymes said to them / that with out fault they
were made for to hang on guye of bourgoyne / and forthwith they saw him coming
al despoyled and was led toward the galowes / and they knew well that if he
were not socoured and rescued that he should be hanged and put to death / ^whan
the fair florypes herd the^ plede she came to them for to wete what it was /
and after when she saw the galowes raised / and guy her love / and to coming
husbond so shamefully led / ye may think in what estate she was reduced /
and began to cry O noble knights shall ye suffer guy of bourgoyn your felawe
to be hanged tofore your eyes / Trust ye none other / that if he deye / by the
same god that fourmed me / I shall lepe out of the wyndowe / and shall deye in
desperacyen / and after she came to rolland and kneled down on both her knees
and kyssed his feet humbly in saying / Sir Rolland in thonour of god I require
the / that it may playse the to take the pain / for to rescowe and socoure my
love guye and else I am a boste woman Think for to arm you / and I shall goo
and make ready your horses / for the time is over short so that by the playsyr
of god ye shall be there in time / Then Rolland and his fellows armed them
much hastily / and gyrde their swerdes and sheldes and went out of the toure
and on horse back sprange out / And or they rode any ferther rolland said
lords at this hour lies our death and our life / in such wise that if we have
not good conduyte and loyal we shall never return / we ne ben but x / and the
payne^s ben Innumerable and of great force / In thonour of god I pray you that
always we hold us together / and that each take heed of other as much as he
may / For if we be divided / we shall sone be taken and hanged / And on that
other part if one of us fall to the ground / that prestly he be raised / And
not to leave him for life ne death / And that none faylle other / And I shall be he
that shall bring you to gyder by thayde of god / for I swear to you by my life /
that as long as I may hold durandal and may keep the life in my body / ye shall
have of me a good deffendour and waraunt / and in likewise said all the other /
Florypes answered / my lords ye may tarpe over long / and she went in to her
chamber / and opened a coffre / in which was the crown of Ihesu Christ / and
much reverently they kyssed it / and set it on their heedes / wherefore with a
good courage they issued out no thing dredyng the puyssaunce of the paynyms /
and after Florypes and her damoysellys lift up the bridge and shette fast the
toure / The noble peers of france fair and in good ordenaunce went toward the
galowes alonge the meadows / and the paynyms were under the galowes / and were
besy to bring up guy of bourgoyn which had his eyes bounden and his hands
also / and a great cord about his neck / and when Rolland saw that / he
hasted his horse and the other after / and began to cry to the paynyms saying /
ha trayters mastyns / It shall not be as ye thynk / ye have begone such a
thing werof ye shall repent / Of this hu^^t which was made so Impetuously /
the most hardy of xxx that held guye began to flee / and they were so hastily
poursyewed that xx of them were slain / here upon they that were in the wode
camen out making a great bruyt / and al before came Cornyfer a meruayllous
paynym upon a morel of great facyon / And began to cry hay frensshe men
dysmesured / come ye for to socoure him that is Iuged by thadmyral to be hanged
ye have enterprysed a great folly / For all ye shall be hanged with him / when
rolland herd the paynym so say / he was much angry / and held durandal in
his hand and came against him as a wulf enraged / Nevertheless the paynym smote
on his shield daungerously / but after that he was recouerd he atteyned and
smote the paynym so puyssantly that he clefte his heed down to the body / and
after that he was deed rolland came rennyng unto the galowes / and vnblynfelde
and vnbonde sir guye of bourgoyne and bad him hold him by him till he was armed
/ and after that Roulland had slain another paynym / Guye being in thassuraunce
of the other peers of france he armed him Incontinent with tharmes of that
paynym by the help of his fellows / and mounted upon the Paynyms horse / but
this was not done without great pain and meruayllous deffence that they made
/ for anon all the sarasyns that were in the wode came upon the barons of
france and did great Inconuenyents / Nevertheless by thayde of god / the barons
were of so good government and of so entyer courage / of so meruayllous
deffence and puyssaunce / that at that time they put so many sarasyns to death
/ that the place was al encombred and al were empesshed to goo further / Emonge
whom guye of bourgoyne did meruaylles / for after that he was armed / by the
conseruacyon of his fellows he did gretely his deuoyr and said to the sarasyns
/ O ye traytres mastyns I shall show you in this Iourneye / that I am escaped
fro your hands / and by thus fyghtyng they made the sarasyns to withdraw a
great bow draught / They thus fyghtyng on that other side were moo tha^ ten
thousand sarasyns ready to empesshe them the passage / that they myt not
wythdrawe them wherefore Rolland holdyng durandal in his hand seeing that
called al his fellows and said to them / lords it is no time now to wythdrawe
us / but of necessyte we must auaunce us for our own conseruacyon / if we may
get the bridge / doubt we no thing / and then may we well save us / Roulland
/ Said Guye of bourgoyne ye know well that in the toure we have no thing to
ete / and if we were within how should we live / yet had I lever to have my body
daungerously wounded in fyghtyng upon the sarasyns / than to deye for hungre
here within and without danger / and if it be the will of god that in this
day we should deye / al be it at his playsyr / and we shall take it a worth as
good and true knights of god / At the other barons were of his oppynyon and
goon forth in great purpoos for to bear them valyauntly / T^^y being in this
purpoos to bear them valyauntly as said is / Florypes was in a wyndowe of the
toure / and saw Guye of bourgoyne her love / whereof she was much Joyous / and
cried to him with an her voys / that hit would plese him to come to her saying
that if she syued for the prowess of the barons that her fader thadmyral should
ones be in his danger / wherefore Ogyer the danoys said / Lords have ye not
herd how nobly she speaks / She is well worthy that we do for her / And know
ye that I shall not be at ease if we thus return / Then without more langage
the frensshe men ronnen upon the sarasyns h^stely / of whom Roulland was
always formest / and made so great bruyt and descomfyture of paynyms / that
they eschewed and made them to flee tofore vhem as the bird tofore the
sperhawke / Guye of bourgoyn came with a great course against a paynym much
fyers named Rampyer / and attained him so hard on the somette of the heed that
he clefte him to the myddel of his body / wherefore when Roulland saw his great
valyannce he said to him / Guy fair cosyn I have well seen how ye have menaced
the paynym / ye have so done that Florypes the fair lady ought to love you and
hold you ryt dear /

How the peers of France aforesaid were pourueyed of vptaylles and after
assyeged and foughten by the paynyms capitulo xvj
When Florypes the curtoys being with her damoyselles in the toure saw the
barons of France to be assured tofore the castle she cried to hem hyely / O ye
lords I pray you to remember to get sum vytaylles or ye come enter herein
/ to the end that we deye not for famyne / Olyuer understood well the damoysel
and also roulland which said that she had well spoken and in time / for if we
enter in to the castle we may not depart with our case / and thereupon all the
barons with one courage goon against the sarasyns and smote on them / and brake
their array in such wise yt they made them to void the place and to wythdrawe
and goo back a great dele / and thus as they returned unto the toure / a right
good adventure came against them / For xx so^myers passed forth by which
certain paynyms led / which al were charged with wyn broad and flesh
habundauntly / And anon they that led them were slain and put to death / And
then the barons enforced them for to lead them hastelye and so conduyted them
till they brought them in to the toure / and in the way as they returned they
fond the body of basyn which had be slain the day before / which they took up
and brought with them in to the toure / and were there in sur^te / For they
lift up the bridge and entered / and after aualed the draw bridge and made
fast the yates and surely And thus were they well vytaylled for ij months and
more / ye may well wete that thadmyral was not over Joyous / when he saw that
Guye of bourgoyn which had been in his subgectyon was with his felawes / And
also when he knew that they were furnysshed with vytaylle so habundantlye /
wherefore right angry and evil content did do call his counceyl / and
demanded brullant of mo^myere and Scotybrant of C^nymbres and other of his
counceyllours saying to them / My barons ye know that these frensshe men have
right evil governed us / They have garnysshed the toure with bread wyn and
other vytaylles / and if by adventure it come to the knowleche of king Charles
/ we shall be enpesshed / for he shall come and socoure them and we shall come
make to him contynuel resystence / For his puyssau^ce is over great ye know it
well / wherefore I am in great thought and melancolye what we may best do /

To this Sortybrant answered and said sir admyral I counceyl that every man be
armed and in great point for to set up the engynes to assaylle the toure and
break it / and after to make sown and to trompe up a thousand trompes and
horns Impetuously / And when the Frenssh men shall here them / they shall be so
aferde / that we at our playsyr shall mow enter in to the toure / Brullant of
mommyere answered to him and said / Sortybra^t friend ye speak of a great folly
/ Believe not y^ the frenssh men that he within the toure / ben of so feeble
condycyon / that ye shall make them aferde with blowyng and sownyng of horns
Certain ye have nothing to fere them with / And I shall say to you the reason /
The flour of the barons of france is there within the most puyssaunt and the
most noble / Rolland is there which is so puyssaunt and courageous / that who
someuer Joins to him / he puts him to death / And there is the count
olyuer know ye not of his great fyersnes / which conquered ^eynge Fyerabras
the myghtyest of all the paynyms / And I swear to you by mahoun that he is in
their company / For I have herd say also / that there is the count of
mondydyer Gherurd which has done to us great dommage / Also there is thyerry
the duc of ardayne / and another falls old knight that named him self naymes
du^ of ^^uyere / semblably guy of bourgoyne / which was taken from us when he
was led to be hanged / And other there be which I have not named / There ben
but xj / for one of them was slain / and ye know well they ben all of great
resystence /

Roulland the nenewe of charles is of so great fyersnes that he doubts no
man living / no stroke ne shot that is given him / and doubt ye not that if
they were al such as be is that been in the castle / they should chase us out
of this royame / or they should slay us / And I know well that their god waketh
for them / for he has ryt well kept them / Our gods ben accursed and unhappy
/ For it is long sithe that they have any thing helped us / Of these words
that brullant thus said thadmyral was passing angry and said to him / ye have
right evil and folysshly spoken / and so saying he would have smyton him with
his staf / but the king Sortybrant wythdrowe the stroke saying / Sir admyral
leave your anger / and late us think for to assaylle this toure / and late us
so do that these falls frenssh men be vaynquysshed and smyton in pyeces / and
thus as he had said thadmyral made to come horns trompettes and other
Instruments for to sown and to make bruyt and noise in such wise / that all the sarasyns were there assembled that they held ye space of a mile long
about the toure After thadmyral made to come a man Ingenyous and enchauntour /
which was named Mahon that made two meruayllous engynes and with couertures
surely made kept them that were there under / that they might not be hurt of
the frensshe men / And by the moyen of these engynes they conquered the first
wards of the castle / wherefore the frensshe men furyous and wode as lions came
to the yates of the toure / and the maidens also al armed / which with the
barons did so well their deuoyr that he that was raught and smyton by them was
so terrybly hurt that he ouerthrewe and fyl down deed / For they were above on
her and threw down great stones / darts of iron and other mortal engynes with
which they made contynuel resystence /

How the toure was broken and burnt by enchauntement and the barons in great
peril of death and restored by assoulte maad on the Paynyms capitulo xvij
THe Paynyms perseueryng in thassault aforesaid / Thenchau^tour came tofore the
admyral and said to him / Ryt dear sir I have made mine engynes al ready / by
moyen of which I shall deliver to you the frensshe men / make your men of arms
to god a part / and that I may have sum to awayte on me / And when they were
all ready as he had devised he set them round about the tour And by his
craft and art he made a flamme of fire so meruayllous / that y^ pylers of
marble and other stones bygonnen to brenne and make fire at vtterau^ce wherefore
the frensshe men were so perturbed that the one said to the other / that by
force they must yield the toure / for they had no moyen to save their persons
/ with this florypes said to them lords esmaye you nothing yet unto the time
ye see more / And anon she went and took sum herbes^ and other medecynes
and did tempere them in wyn / For she knew the manner how that fire
artyfycyally burnt the stones / thus she made this beurage and when it was
cast upon the fire / it brenned no more / wherefore the admyral wend to have
been out of his wit for anger / But Sortybrant told him that al was quenched
by the moyen of floripes his daughter / wherefore thadmyral was of entencyon to
make his daughter to deye of an evil death / The king Sortybrant said that he
should do sown his horns and trompettes / and recommence the assault al new
/ and at that time by force the frensshe men should be vaynquysshed / For I am
sure said he / that they have no more to cast out upon us / For they have
no more shot ne stones / but al is faylled to them And thassaulte was made as
it was ordained Impetuous that it seemed derke for the shot of arowes / of
darts stones and other engynes / in such wise that the great quarters of the
murayl and walls fyl and tombled down to the earth / the barons of france
much abashed said one to another / that then they must needs be
vaynquysshed / For they saw part of the walls and the pryncipal of the
castle fall down And they being in great thout Florypes said to them thus /
Lords dysmaye ye no ^ynge this toure is strong enough for to keep us yet /
And of that other part / the tre^our of my fader is herin / which is in (...)
wedges and places of (...) buyllyon / late us goo (...) it and as well may we
(...) the paynyms therwyth as with stones and better / Then (...) of bourgoyn
her love came to (...) with great Joy and hyssed (...) much amerously and
swetelye And after she went and opened the toure and place where (...) tresour
was Innumerable / and with great quantyte thereof they went to the butysments
of the toure / and threw upon the ^aynyms / in such wise that they made great
dyscomfyture / And more over the paynems seeing the gold fall on them in
such habundaunce / anon they cessyd their fyghtyng ayense the fre^ssh men /
And for the concupyscence of that gold they f^ught and slew each other /
wherefore thadmyral was so dysplaysaunt and angry that he wend to have dyed and
began to cry with an hye voys / O ye barons sarasyns leave ye thassaulte which
torneth to me great dommage Innumerable / For I see that my tresour wastes and
is lost which I have with great payue and dylygence assembled / And had
recomaunded it to my god mahon and had made him kepar of it / which now has
faylled me / but by my soul if I may take him / and that he come in to mine
hold I shall make him weep / The king Sortybrant answered Sir Admyral be ye no
thing ameruayllyd of your tresour / ne wroth against Mahon / for he may no more
do / they may well take it fro him / for he is aslepe / I believe none other /
for in time passed he has well watched and kept it / but those frenssh men ben
so wyly thieves yt they have stolen it fro him subtylly / Thadmyral being al
angry by cause the night came on / And repaired with his people toward his
souper / After this when thadmyral was set at table Roulland which was in
the hye toure surely with his fellows lay in a wyndowe for to ease him / and
as he thought and was pensyf / he saw thadmyral syttyng at the table thorugh
the wyndowe / and after came to the other barons and said to them / my lords
and brethern I see that the Admyral is with his pryncypal barons at souper /
and thinks to hold hem well at his ease / and me seems it should be great
honor and prowess to us to make him lene his repaste The other barons his
fellows were of his accord / and hastily they armed them and put them in
point / and fair issued out coming to the place where the admyral was / but
the admyral which was subtyl apperceyued their feat / and sent hastily for a
paynym which was much fyers / and was his neuewe / And said to him /
Espoulart cosyn / peradventure the frensshe men purpose to dystrouble us at our
souper / Therefore depesshe the and be ready anon / and do so that they be
taken and destroyed / and anon he was ready / And forthwyth Espoulart took his
horse and came against the barons holdyng in his hand a dart of stele / And
first he encountered Rolland and hytte him in his shield in such wise that of
the stooke he was al astonyed / but it came so to pass that it touched not
his flesh / ne he was not hurt / After this Rolland came upon the paynym and
gaf him a good stroke that he made him overthrow fro his horse / but the turk
was so balyaunte and a man of so great might / that much lightly he remou^ted
upon his horse / And Roulland came to him and smote him with his sword in such
wise that the paynym wist not where he was And as he was falling down of his
horse / Rolland much puyssauntly caught him and laid him thwart upon his horse
and bare him away / The admyral seeing this al in a rage escryed his people
that they should socoure his neuewe / but they wist not what to do / For in
defendyng them many of them were slain and hurt without nombre / wherefore of
very force the other paynyms must return / and rolland cessed not to run
till that he was at the toure / And when all the barons of France were within /
they shette the yates well surely / and had no fear of any empesshement /

Here begins the third party of the second book which conteyneth xvj
chapytres / And speaks how the barons of france were socoured and the paynyms
confused /
Of the moeuyng of the peers of france for to goo show their affairs unto
king Charles / And how Rychard of Norman dye was ordained for to goo / capitulo
primo
THe peers of france being thus assyeged and deteyned as I have said before /
had taken a turk much fyers / and great friend of the admyral whom they gaf
to f^^rypes for to do with him as it plesed her / and they demanded of her
what man he was and of his estate / Florypes ansuerd he is sone of mine aunte /
and neuewe to thadmyral / and he is rich and has great puyssaunce / And if ye
will do great dysplaysyr to my fader / put him to death / The duc Naymes much
wise said to her / Madame it is not behoeful to put him so to death but sithe he
is a man of auctoryte and has audyence with your fader / we been the more
Joyous and I shall say to you wherefore if peradventure one of us were taken of
our enemies / by the moyen of this man he might he rendered and changed for him
And of this conclusyon were content all the peers of france Then after this
Rychard of Normandye called the other his felawes / and said to them / ye know
well how we ben here enclosed in this toure / And I am well sure / that at the
last we must needs faylle and deye by these Sarasyns / we have no moyen by
which we may save our life / and me thinks that it should be good / that we
should

How after that rychard was departed / king claryon a right mighty king ran
after him the which was slain by the said Rychard valyauntly / and of other
things capitulo ij
Great gryef and annoye came to y^ peers of france when Rychard of Normandye
should depart for to goo to king charles / On the morn when they came to the
gates of the toure in which they were in they fond great multitude of people
sarasyns which kept the passage that none of the frensshe men should issue out
/ wherefore by the space of ij months they could not find the moyen to issue
out / but on a day emonge al other when thadmyral was on huntyng a little way
of / and that on a night the guard of the bridge was forgoten / Then the
barons armed them and mounted on horsback / and went out rennyng unto their
lodgings / but as soon as they were seen of the paynyms they blewe up horns
and trompettes / and began to sown so terrybly that anon people Innumerable
were there assembled for to run upon the peers of France / and thus when
they were al enclosed with their enemies / and that every man was besy for to
fight / The duc Rychard al in weeping commanded to god his felawes / And
secretly departed and took his way at al adventure / and tofore that his
felawes were at their lodgyng many of the sarasyns were hurt and slain / and
in this manner they reentred in to the toure surely / and mounted in to the
ba^aylement / and saw a far duc rychard which then had passed beyond all
the host / and in weeping they recommaunded him swetely to god many times /
Rychard of Normandye thus rydyng allone had fear always that he should be
assaylled / when he had far ryden unto a top of a montayn / his horse was
sore chauffed and bledde habundantly / Then he doubted entyerly that he should
be empesshed and lift up his mind to heaven and said / O lord god my creator
to whom all my will is ordained / this day preserve my body from mine enemies
/ in such wise that I lose not my life and blessid him self with the sign of
the cross many times / he being in that place the day appyered well clearly /
and first brullant of mo^myere apperceyued him / and after sortybrant of
Conymbres rohyche were both to gydre / the which went hastily to king
Claryon a much mighty paynym neuewe of thadmyral / and brullant said first to
him / Sir Claryon see ye yonde messager one of the prisoners of france which
is departed fro his felawes and gooth toward Charles for socours / And if ye
see not for remedy / there may come there by harm to us / for if he recou^te
their affairs to the king charles / It may happen to return to us great
dommage / Also sone as claryon herd these tidings anon he armed him / and
mounted upon his horse the most merueyllous that ever was seen For for to run
xxx leghes he would not be weary / and took his shield and his swerd of stele
square and sharp / and ran toward Duc Rychard as he had be enraged and other
sarasyns followed after him / Rychard mounted on his horse without knowing that
he was poursyewed and said / O my creator holy Trynyte give to me consolacyon
and grace that I may see Charles the mighty Emperor / to whom I am sent for
the rescows and comfort of my felawes which ben in the toure sorouful and sore
grieved / and that I may make them Ioyeful and thus as he was in this thout he
looked behind him / and saw the sarasyns come hastily after him which were by
common estymacyon moo than xiiij M / Of whom the king Claryon neuewe of the
Admyral upon the courser tofore said came tofore the other a great way /
Nevertheless Rychard being on a little montayn / and byhelde the host of the
paynyms came against him with great courage / ye may well ymagyne in what estat
his heart was / what thing myt he thynk that they would do with him / and what
tidings his fellows should have of him / when he was there allone for tabyde
and sustain the furour and malyde of so much people / Thus ymagynyng that he
might not flee / Anon was claryon upon the said coursour which ran faster
and more swyftlyer than a grehounde / the which coursour was all whyt on the
one of his sides as a flour delys / and on that other side as read as fire
enflammed / The tail after the facion of a pecock the crou^e behind somewhat
raised and dropped as small as of a partryche / great thyes and shoot feet and
platte / and round / with little ^eres / the mane of the neck whyt his
nosethrylles large and ample he was tofore much broad and had eyes grene and
clear / a little beed / a broad front / with a small moscl and he was sadled
with a sad be of yuorye / and the raynes of y^ bridle entrelaced with gold /
styroppes of fyn gold / the roytral well en^^ned and rychely / and was gyrde
with iiij strong syngles / and had on him moo than an C of small bellys of fyn
gold sownyng much melodyously / and y^ paynym smote him with the spores much
sharply in such wise that the horse made a leep more than xxx foot long / And
after escryed duc Rychard the noble knight sayyeng with an hye boys / by Mahoun
my souerayn god thou messager shall never achyeue thyn enterprise / For
without going any ferther thou shalt here end thy life / when rychard
understood him all the blood in his body was moeued and changed and ansuerd /
Sarasyn wherefore art thou of such entencion against me / what have I trespaced
to the / I never offended the / ne robbed thy tresour / I trquyre the by love /
that thou dystrouble me not / and if thou suffer me to pass I shall take it for
a great seruyse / and I promise to the that ones it shall be rewarded to the by
me / The paynym answered certain frensshe man thou spekest of great folly / and
of mahoun be I cursed if I do any thing for the / I shall not suffer the to
pass for half the tresour of the world / Also sone as Rychard knew his
ente^cyon he auau^ced against him / and the paynym came to Rychard and with his
sword he smote him hard upon his shield / but it was so hard that it went
not through / here upon richard which was full of great ire against the paynym by
effectuel death came to him with his sword which was trenchaunte and as the
horse lepe forth / the paynym lift up his head / and richard attained
overthwart the neck so ryt in a Ioynte that he smote of his head in such wise
that it flewe far fro the body / ye well a spear length / and he put ye
tru^ke of the body to the earth al deed / and forth with he descended fro his
horse / and mounted upon that / the good courser of the Paynym / which was the
best horse of the world / Then Rychard might well say / that he was never so
well pourueyed of an horse / For he was so mighty that if he had born vij
knights armed upon him he would not have swette a drop of vater / and for to
swymme / and pass a deep river there was no horse like him / and after that he
was thus horsed at his ease he said to his owen horse by much good affection /
O gentyl horse doulstyn for the I am sorouful that I may not conduyte the in to
some place at my playsyr / I pray to god of heaven that he draw ye in to such
a way that you may come in to the hondes of christian men and serve them / in
many great bataylles and evil passages / thou have well served me / and of thy
great seryce / as much as apperteyneth to me I thank the gretely / and here
upon he went and rode forth his way / And anon the sarasyns that followed
after came and fond the king Claryon deed their master / of whose death they
were so surprysed of melancolye and of sorrow / that they could do none other
thing / but first to run for to take Rychards horse But there was none so
hardy to approach him ne set hand on him / but the horse maad great deffence
/ and took his way rennyng for to return to the place that he was departed
fro /

How Rychards horse came and passed through thexcersyte of the admyral / and was
seen and known of the peers of France / in so much / that they thought that
duc Rychard had been deed / and how the bridge of Mantryble was kept capitulo
iij
RYchard of Normandye with his sword in his fyste rode hastily / and the
sarasyns which ra^ne after him came and fond their king deed of whom the head
was on that one side of the way / and the body on that other / It byhoueth not
to recounte the sorrow that they were in / when the chyef of all the sarasyns
of might and parentage was descomfyted and slain / and for thing that they
could do / they could not reteyne Rychards horse / and the first that saw the
horse come re^nyng was thadmyral / which called gorant sone of king grehier /
and also sortybrant of conymbres / and said to them / by my god appolyn when I
well advise and remember me I ought well to love my neuewe Claryon / and hold
him dear emonge al other / I see well that he has put to death the messager of
the Frensshe men / that it is truth ye may see his horse that yonder comes /
and thadmyrall commanded that he should hastily be taken / but when the horse saw
that they would have taken hum he ran and smote out / and cessed not till he
came to the yate of the castle in which the barons of France were enclosed /
and when the frensshe men saw thus the horse come which was longyng to rychard
they were al affrayed and moeued / and came and opened the gate / and anon he
entered in / and after that the yate was shette they arenged them aboude the
said horse for compassyon of sorrow weeping pyetously / And Duc Naymes spoke
first and said / Ha Richard of Normandye / I pray to god that he be in thy
comfort and that he have pity of thy soul / I know well that for thy death we
shall never have socoure / Ne of thy party we shall never have none help /
Roulland and Olyuer heryng these words / and also the other wept bytterly /
here upon came flo^ypes the curtoys in great heaviness and said to them / Lords
in the honor of god leave your lamen tyng and sorrow / we know not yet the
truth of the matter / thus as they were in these great thoughts the Sarasyns
came which had left Rychard ride forth / And in great sorrow and torment
brout the body of king Claryon / And when thadmyral saw them come he being in
the ethroclytes in his entendement cried and said / and how is it is mine neuewe
in good point / The sarasyns ansuerd / Sir admyral / we may not lie to you /
Claryon is deed / it needs no more to demand thereof Thadmyral heryng thoo
words fyl down to therth al in a trau^se and he swouned more than iiij times
as he had been deed / thus emonge all the sarasyns was a great weeping and made
great sorrow / The sarasyns thus making this lamentacyon / the barons of
france herd and understood them / and specially florypes which knew better
the langage / and after that she knew the cause of their sorrow / she came to
the barons / and said to them in spekyng to rolland / sir know ye wherefore the
sarasyns demene such sorrow / it is troth that Rychard your messager has
slain the king claryon / and wo^ne his horse / to whom is none like ne p^reylle
of boun to in all the world / and as well for yt death of claryon / as for the
losyng of the horse they demene and make al this sorrow / and torment that ye
see and here / wherefore I pray you that every man do his deuoyr to lead a
good life and to make good chyere / Olyuer said to rolland Ioyously / O my
felawe of arms ye know not how glad I am of these tidings that we here / and
I ensure you by my soul that I am as sure to pass this danger that we be in
/ as though I were in the strengest castle of france / blessed be richard of
god for he has borne him nobly / and semblably said all the other his felawes /
After that richard rode thus / thadmyral made a man to come to him named Orages
/ and made him to take a dromedary hastily / and commanded him to bear his
letters to galafre which kept the strong bridge of ma^tryble I charge the to
re^ne as fast as the dromydary may bear the tomantryble / and say to Galafre
wherefore he suffered the messagers of charles to come over the bridge / the
which have done to us so much greuaunce and ennoyaunce / as thou can well
tell to him / and I swear by mahon my god that he did a great folly / and
sithe on that other part / the messager of the frensshe men goes thither / and
if he recou^te his message to Charles / it might happen he should put me in
subgectyon / Therefore say to galafre that he keep so well the bridge that no
person pass / and say to him more over / that if he do otherwise I shall put
out his eyes and make him deye shamefully / Sir admyral said Orages the
messager I shall do your commandment / and I assure you I shall ride as much
way in one day / as that other shall do in four days / for / for to ride an
hundred leghes contynuelly I shall never be weary /

And thus he departed from the admyral upon a dromydary / and tarried not till he
came to mantryble / and spoke to Galafre saying Galafre I shall not hyde fro the
/ that the admyral is not content with the by cause thou suffredest the
frenssh men to pass over the bridge / which have done to him great dommage /
for they be lodged in the chyef toure and holden in their subgectyon the gods
with floripes his douter and have slain many of the most valyaunte of the
court of thadmyral / and the cause wherefore I am thus hastelye come is this
After me comes a messager which is one of the barons of France / which
gooth for to fetch aid unto Charles their king / the which has slain king
Claryon / wherefore keep well this passage that he pass not / For if thou do
otherwise thou shall not conne find the manner to save thy life / but that thou
shall deye vylaynsly / Of these words Galafre was ^^^turbled and replenysshed
of ire and for his anger he made much foul chyere and began to sc^me at the
mouth like a bore enchaffed / and took a staff and had smyton the messager if
it had not be betted by them that were present / Nevertheless be mounted upon a
tou^rette / and with the sown of a trompette he assembled many men of arms
which were in nombre xv / in / which were anon of horsbuck and passed the
bridge / And when they were over it was a^ none lift up / and they went and
rode here and there for to recou^tre yt messager of the frenssh men if by
adventure they myt find him /

How rychard of normand^r passed the river of flagot by miracle by the moyen of
a whyt heart which came tofore him iiij
RYchard of Neomandye messager of the frensshe birons prisoners rode in great
doubt ye may well think and ymagyne / how he only by him self might pass the
strong and dangerous bridge / And in rydyng he beheld behind him and saw
all the contree couerd with men of arms / thus byholdyng them / he was sore
troubled in his mind began to cry / O Ihesus king of glory at this time be
thou kepar of my body and conseruatour of my soul / For I see well the declyne
of my life / if I put my self to fight / I shall have my head smyton of / and if
I enter in to this hydous river / I shall not conne pass over / Thus at this
time I must needs deye / And if I by force returned to my felawes I should make
a great defaulte to therle Rolland / to whom I have pormysed faithfully to do
my deouoyr for to do my message / wherefore my god my maker I wot not what to
say but that thy will be fulfilled and done of me / thou know mine entencion
/ after the same govern me he being nyghe the river the sarasyns maden great
bruyt in coming to him / emonge whom a neuewe of the admyral auaunced him to
run against him and cried with an high boys / O messager what someuer thou
be think for to dye / thou have now ryden over far / now is yt hour come
that the death of king claryon shall be aduenged / These words so herd of
rychard were not to him over playsaunt / but he was evil content / and suddenly
he s^ored his horse against him holdyng a sword in his hand square and sharp
which he had conquered of Claryon / and came to him / and smote him so
daungerously against the breast that it Perced thorugh the shield in to his body
that he fyl down to therthe al deed / and after took his horse by the bridle
which was rich of gold and went to the ryuage of the water / and by held it
that it ra^ne like a quarrel out of a crosbowe / and rored like thundre in such
wise that galeye ne other engyne / might not goo surely upon hit /

Then by great contrycion of heart he recommaunded him self to our lord that
he should preserve him from death till that he had said his message to the
Emperor Charles / Then god of heaven that never leueth his servants at
their need / showed unto him a great token of love that he had to Charles / for
Rychard of Normandye being in this medytacyon and thought for to pass over /
god sent a white heart which passed tofore rychard / and in coming ye ought to
were that the ryuage of the water was much hye / ye as hye as a man from
bynethe might cast up a stone with his hand And the river began to arise so
hye that it flowed over the bank / and the heart entered in to the water / and
Rychard looked behind him and saw many sarasyns come in a great multitude for
to put him to death / and then he recommaunded him to god with good heart / and
made the sign of the cross upon his body / having in his heart the holy name
of Ihesus that he myt persevere fro dread in such wise that he might pass
over the ryuere / and so took the water and followed the heart / The paynyms
seeing that were al abusshed and troubled / and there was not one that durst
follow him / Fro Incontinent the water aualed and returned in to his former
estate and being / Then the paynyms made great duel and sorrow by cause they
myt not have the messager / Galafre which that was most wroth and werst
content came to the bridge and aualed the chains and commanded the paynyms
upon pain of death / that they should not cesse till that rychard were taken / or
else they should be all in the Indygnacyon of thad myral and in danger to be
lost / Rychard of Normandye came over in good point / and deuoutelye thanked
god of the grace that he had sent to him / and descended fro his horse for to
vngyrde and lose his sadle / And after resengled him / and took his horse and
rode forth at his ease / and ladde that other horse on his right side / and
doubted then no more / For in short time he supposed to find thexcersyte of
king Charles / The paynyms seeing this returned soroufully / and went to
unarm them / For other thing could they not do

How charles was in purpoos to return without going any ferther by the
counceyl of ganellon traitor and his fellows and other matters capitulo v
IN as much as rychard rode which was much weary / and out of great thought
The Emperor Charles was passing much pensyf and sorrowful for his barons which
were deteyned of thadmyral / And he seeing that he had no tidings he sent for
to come to him Ganellon / Geffroy dantesuyle / au bert machayre and many other
and emonge the other came reyner fader of Olyuer / to whom he said / lords and
friends I am in much great trybulacyon / the cause is enough apparent / which
is of my specyal burons / which were sent as messagers to ballant thadmyral /
I see that no person reports ne brings any tidings from them / wherefore
know ye that of my deed that I did / I despise my self / Then by more
strenger reason the other ought more to despise me / And I you ensure that I
shall never regne more / but shall leave all / Take ye there loo the crown of
mageste / take it / For I depose my self from hens forth Ganellon was there
which was Ioyeful / what someuer semblau^t he made / and said sir emperor if
ye believe me / I shall give to you good counceyl / Anon comaunde that our
lodgys and habytacyons here be take up / and that every man trusse his gheer
upon the sommyers / and think to return / For if ye goo any ferther ye shall
never redorne / The contree of Aygremore is much strong / And sithe that
ballant the admyral is of great fyersnes and with that he has all the paynyms
and sarasyus capytayns in to his aid / And by cause that Fyerabras his sone is
deteyned by you and maad christian so much more is he affectyoned against you /
And on that other part your barons be not a live I ensure you / Return we in
to France / we have left there many of our children and parents that shall
wexe great / and or it be twenty year they shall bear arms / And then they
with us shall come in to spain for to conqueste the lands and seygnouryes that
we have enterprysed / And shall recouure the holy relyques of whom I have great
pity / And more over ye shall revenge the death of Roulland the noble earl for
whom ye have this melancolye / For certain ye shall never see him / when Charles
herd these words of Ganellon he was smyton with so great sorrow that after
he fyl donn in a swoune / And spoke not the space of a great hour / and in
weeping bytterly he said to him self / O pour caytyf and unhappy what shall
thou do / if thou return / you shall be dishonored / yet were it better to
lose the life / tha^ to be thus shamed / After that he was comen to him self he
said to his barons that were there / Loo ye see the counceyl that ganellon
gives to me / which in no wise may playse me / if I return without taking
vengeance of my noble barons / which ben thus deteyned / there shall never man
set by me / but I shall be shamed and with good right /

Machayre / aulbery and geffroy and other moo than an hundred which al were
parents and traytres with Ganellon the most part / and also were much mighty
to gydre said all with one consent / Sir emperor purpose ye not to do
otherwise than ganellon has said / For he has spoken wisely / and therefore
conclude ye to return in to france without gooyng any ferther on we ben xx
thousand that have made oath to gyder that for any thing that ye say or do we
shall not goo no ferther / For sithe that Roulland is deed they have lost
their comfort / and him that was chyef of the conseruacyon of their persons /
Charles al heavy answered / O god of heaven how am I determined / if I return
without to avenge my barons / I shall do pourely / fythe they have sustained
and borne up the crown Imperyal and my will / and I now to return without
to avenge them / He that gaf me such counceyll loves me but little I see well /
Reyner of genes fader of Olyuer aroos up and said / O Emperor if thou believe
these words that have been said to the thy governance shall be so evil that by
them al france shall be wasted / and brought to naught / And who someuer have
damage they retche not but pass over lightly / Then they that were of the
party of the traytres came forth and said / Reyner of genes ye have lied of
that which ye have said / And if it were not because the king is present ye
should lose your head and it should be smyton of / we know well what ye be / your
fader garyn was never but a pour man and of low condycyon / All your lygnage
ne ben but people of naught / The duc Reyner might not suffer this Iniurye but
came to him and smote him with his fyst in such wise that he ouerthrewe to
ground / and there were made many reproaches and ylle talent / in so much that
if the king had not be present and made the pees and tranquylyte / they had
slain each other / For anon there were moo than a thousand of the lygnage of
ganellon / But fyerabras which was present blamed them strongely / And on that
other side the king swear by his crown that if there were any person that
began bataylle or fight / that he should do him be hanged as a thief attaynt /
of what someuer estate that he were / and by this they were aferde for to
offend and was no more spoken Not withstandyng that the counceyl was taken
emonge them that they should put Reyner to death as soon as they should be in
France / Charles sent for them to come to him / and said to them ye have done
to me a great shame but if it be not amended now to fore me I shall do opene
Justice Always needs must the king be obeyed in such wise that a^ory on his
knees cried duc Reyner mercy / but he would never have done it / if it had not
been for to appease the furour of king charles / and thus they maad the pees
And after the emperor said his oppynyon / that if he turned back that it should
be to him great dishonor / Therefore came geffroy daulteuylle fader of Ganellon
which said Sir Emperor I am old and have seen much thing / wherefore me
seems that ye ought to believe me as well as any person of your company / ye
know well that I and Ganellon my sone have always loved you / And how that it
be he that counceylleth you to return has good right / I have now my body
all to bruised for beryng of arms / and be ye sure that tofore that twenty
year be passed / the children that be now in france shall be great and mighty
to bear arms / and they shall be so great a company / that lyte by ye shall
mow conquer spayn and avenge the death of rolland and of his other fellows /
When Charles understood these words he wept bytterly and saw that by force he
must against his will return in to france / and leave his enemies / wherefore
by the sown of trompettes was cried the retraytte / And anon the artylleryes
were assembled and the harnoys trussed / whereof the company of traytres were
Joyous / and many of the other were evil content / and in especyal Reyner
which returned without his sone Olyuer / whereof ye may well think in what
estate was his heart / by cause he have lost al his comfort /

How after the complaynte of Charles Rychard came unto him / which told to
him thaffayres of the peers of France capitulo vj
When charles was mounted on horsback and in way for to return / he took
remors of Rolland / Olyuer / and of other / how he left them / with out to do
otherwise his deuoyr he tarried saying / O unhappy that I am I may well sorrow /
when I now leave the men / that I love best in the world / and return fro them
when I ought by good right to avenge them I shall be reputed for a fool and sore
blamed / O Rolland how I have loved you / may ever your vnclle so long live
that he moy see your death avenged / God deffende that ever I bear crown on my
head seen the pouerte of my fayte / this saying almoost he fyl a swoune to the
earth for the dysplaysaunce that he had / much heaviness had he that time Alas
said Charles / Rolland I was much evil auysed when I / consented that thou
sholdest goo to thadmyral / well am I cause of al your perdycyon / In making
this heaviness the host made so great bruyt to return that it was meruaylle /
and thus as they began to ride forth / The emperor looked toward the eest and
from far he saw rychard come rydyng upon an horse sore rennyng / and held in
his hand a sword al naked / wherefore the Emperor sent for to come to him the
most grettest lords of his company / and made thoost to tarry and goo no
ferther forth I see said he yonder ^myng a man on horsback which makes great
haste / and ledeth on his right side a fair courser as me thinks / and he
seems by his rydyng that he is Rychard of normandye / Now I pray to god
almighty / that this day he send me tidings of rolland and of the other
barons / that they be alive / Then the host tarried / and anon came richard
which maad his horse to lepe much gentylly tofore the king whom he salewed
much humbly / And then charles said to rychard of normandye / Sone of noble
baron how is hit with you / what is bycomen of my neuewe Rolland and of mine
other barons / be ye come allone / be they alive or deed / tell me I pray you
/ Rychard ansuerd / Sir Emperor / Rolland and the other when I departed fro
them were al hole and in good point / and been in aygremore in a strong toure
bysyeged / by ballant the admyral of spain and fader of Fyerabras / and there
been about them an hundred thousad sarasyns / And know ye for certain that
thadmyral is a man much fyers and terryble / which has sworn by his god
mahoun and Termagaunt / that he shall never depart fro thens / but that they
shall be hanged by the neck And on that other side your barons have with them
floripes the curtoys daughter of thadmyral the fairest that ever was seen / the
which has in her keeping the relyques that ye so much desire to have / and
send you word by me that ye should come and aid them for to save their lives
/ And if it please you to remember them ye shall mow conquer the contreye of
spain and other goods enough Great consolacyon had king Charles / And then
he conceived well that Ganellon was a traytre and full of wickedness And never
after his counceyll ne saying should be herd ne allowed in his court / For he
saw well that as for him it abode not but Rolland and his fellows should have
dyed / Now gentyl Rychard said the king / is the toure in which they been
bysyeged strong and well garnysshed of vytayl for to defend them any while /
if they may hold vj days I shall make thadmyral to dye and al his complyces /
Sir answered Rychard I shall say to you the truth / they have no vytayl but
they great it with the sword / thadmyral is meruayllously fyers / and full of
cruelte and has of people a multitude Innumerable / the which hold the space
of two mile / the town is strong where he habyteth / and also there is on this
side of the town / the bridge of mantryble where the passage is much
dangerous / and the walls of that cite ben made of marble cymented and
fortefyed with toures and there renneth a river ryt hydous which is named
flagot and is of depthe of ij / speres of length / and renneth so fast and
brayeth that there is no bote ne ship may pass thereon and the bridge is
half a mile long / And in the mids there is a tonre of marble so strong
that it may not be beten done / and the yate is garnysshed and kept with
barryers of iron fast locked / The portyer that keeps this plase is a paynym
hydous and great / massyf / strong / and felonnous / which better resembles
the devil than any man or person / he is as black as pytche boylled / and
has x thousand knights in his company / where fore I wot well that by force
we may not pass / For by any assault that may be done to them they doubt it
not / And if we pass not by engyne and subtylte / we may not goo over the
bridge / For by force we may no thng do / but it byhoueth us to pass in guyse
of marchaunts And sum of us shall be well armed under our clothes / and there
above we shall were a man tell of cloth and their swerdes under / And there shall
come after us great ^ommyers charged with marchaundyses / And ye with all the
chyualrye shall tarry in a little wode and that every man be in great point /
and after when we have gotten the first gate / I shall soune and blow mine horn
/ And with motye ye shall come on / And thus we shall have the passage by the
playsyr of god and we shall come to our entencyon / This counceyl was well
approuued by the king Charles which often blessed rychard by cause he had so
well said / and then he resembled al his people The standards were raised /
and the loryflam dyscouerd / Rychard took his horse / and gaf it to duc Reyner /
And went and bond heye and grass to gydre and made trusses upon many
sommyers in the guyse of merchants / every man well armed under his cloak /
and sword gyrde and so take their horses / to the end that they should not be
espied / and were in nombre v hundred knights all man of great facyon / and
drive tofore them / the sommyers for a good enterprise / Rychard went tofore as
chyef enterprenour / due howel of Nountes followed / Guye de hallee / Ryoll du
mauns / Duc Reyner fader of Olyuer / and other which rode forth without
taryeng / And Charles with all his baro^nye abode in a wode / as tofore I have
maad mencyon /

How by the moyen and counceyl of Rychard of Normandye with iij other barons /
the strong bridge of ma^tryble was wo^ne not without great pain / And what
manner man galafre was capitulo vij
The Emperor charles with an hundred thousand men abode in the wode tofore said
/ and Rychard of normandye hoel of Nau^tes / Ryoll / and Reyner and other people
which were valyaunte of their person were on the way to goo toward mantryble
/ and ladde with them aquantyte of sommyers charged when the fellows of Rychard
saw the river flagot so roryng And thentree of the cite of ma^tryble so
strong / the bridge so dangerous to pass / and the yates barred and
enchayned so with iron / they were much abashed For / for to come thither by
assault / all the puyssaunce of crystendom might not enter by that place /
but they aualed the bridge and chains of iron / Ryol demanded of Rychard what
may there be of this place / And he ansuerd / know ye that this is the
strongest cite that is between this and Acres / And there been in the same cite
(...) than a thousand men of arms Hoel of Nauntes was all afraid / And
commanded him self to god prayeng him to keep their persons / Rychard said /
lords I will goo before and shall speak first / and when we have passed the
first yate / see that ye take of your clokes for to smite upon the paynyms /
and for any thing that happeth / see that the one of you faylle not the other
/ Ryol ansuerd doubt ye not / than when I am emonge the sarasyns but that I
shall do my deuoyr that it shall appyere / and if I do not as I say I will that
ye reclame me recreaunte and repute me as rebouted / After these words they
hasted their sommyers toward the bridge / and galafre saw them fro far / and
stood restyng him nygh to the first gate / and held in his hand a great axe
of fyn stele bended and affyled that there was no side but it cutted / This
paynym was great and fonrmed so hydously and of such representacyon that he
seemed better a devil than a reasonable person / he had eyes al enflammed like
fire / and he was as black as boy led pytche / his neck large and great / his
nose half a foot long his ceres so great that they myt conteyne well half a
busshel of whete / his arms long and crooked and his feet stood overthwart and
as of the remenaunte of his body was lothely enough / Balla^t thadmyral loved
him much and was his neuewe / and for the great confydence that he had in him
/ he gaf to him the keeping of the bridge of mantryble / by cause that it was
the most strengest passage that was in all the marches of that contreye / And
the said paynym was conestable of all the lands of thadmyral / wherefore it was
necessary that none of the frensshe men should have be known of him / For if
there had any be known there should never none have escaped but he should have been deed Thus then when they were at mantryble / Rychard passed before / and
when he was at the enter of the gate / Galafre came to him and said bassal what
are ye / wherefore come ye hither /

Rychard which was wise changed his langage and began aragon and said / Sir I
am a marchaunte which comes fro Taraston with these other merchants and
bring great quantyte of draperye / and will goo to the fayres by the help of
mahon / to whom we goo to present our marchaundyses / and if we were at
aygremore we should soiourne there / and give to thadmyral sum precious yeftes
that we here bring / These other merchants that been here with me ben al
esclaues / and know not the langage / wherefore fair sir we pray to advise us
what we may best do / and by what way we ought to goo / Galafre ansuerd know
ye that I am kepar of the bridge and of the passages that been fyfty mile here
about / But not long sythen passed hereby xii glotons of france / which
were messagers of the emperor Charles / which yet owe to me their trybute for
their passage / Nevertheless my lord thadmeral keeps them in prison / And one
of them that other day escaped preuyly away as a thief / which rode upon an
horse the best that ever I saw and passed over this rennyng water / which also
slew my cosyn the king Claryon / for whom I am in great melancolye / now would
god Mahon that he were now here upon this bridge / I should cleue him unto the
myddle of his belly without to have any mercy or pity on him /

Sith that time thadmyral doubts of treason / For his sone fyerabras which
has renyed mahon and the paynym law for to become christian / And he commanded
me three times that I should not suffer any person / lord / knight / ne
seruytour to pass / And that I should search well al for to know the condycyon
of them that come this way / Therefore I will know what ye be / Rychard heryng
this bowed his head / Ryol du mau^s Hoel of Nauntes / and Reyner of genes /
goon forth over the bridge / when galafre saw them he began to doubt and said
to them that there should nomoo enter / and auaunced him and drew up the bridge
/ and there were nomoo within but four / which he dred not / and said to them
in great fyerste ye are over bold and hardy to enter herein without my
commandment / And therefore ye four shall be set in prison / and the other
that come after you also / And to morn I shall send you prisoners to my lord
thadmyrall / he for to do with you his playsyr / Take of your mantellys or
clokes for A will see what ye have there under / For ye seem people for to do
evil / Thus saying he took hoel by the cloak / and drew him thereby four times
about / By god said Ryol I may no longer tarry to see him do this Iniurye to
my cosyn / if I suffer longer / be I confounded / And therwyth he threw of his
cloak and smote upon the paynym / but he was so strongely armed that he might
do him no harm sauf that he smote of a little of his ere / Rychard and Reyner
semblably cast of their clokes and each of them with a sword in their hondes
smote to gydre upon Galafre and gof him many stookes / but the heed ne the body
they might not hurt / For he was armed with the hyde of on old Serpente hard
and maylled / This Paynym was angry and supposed for to have smyton Ryol / and
enhaunced his axe that was great and heavy and also sharp / but Ryol saw the
stroke come / and was habylle and lepte a side and the stroke smote upon the
ground / in such wise that hit claffe a marble stone on which the stroke
lyghted /

Ha god of heaven said Reyner how he smyteth oultrageously I am al abassed of
the puyssaunce of this devil whom we may not conquer ne gryeue / He thus
saying he took a great branch of a tree which was long and strong and
aduysed and marked the paynym well / and he smote him therwyth in such wise
that he made him to overthrow to therthe / and when he was overthrown he maad
a cry so hye and hydous that the River and the roches made great bruyt / with
this voys the paynyms of mantryble were moeued and assembled / that with in a
little while there were ready armed moo than x thousand there was then a great
co^mocyon / Rychard of Normandye ran to the yate of the bridge and aualed
down the draw bridge And then entered in v hundred knights which the four
barons had brought with them but at the enter of the gate the paynyms
encountered them / there was a great meddle and recountre many mortal strokes
were there given / many were there slain and hurt / Rychard took his horn
and sowned it hyely three times / Charles the emperor understood it well which
was in the wood aforesaid with all his puyssaunce / Every man was on horsback
much redyly / and there was not one that cessed to run till he came to the
bridge /

Ganellon which after was traitor bare him valyauntly / For he was the first
that came to the bridge with his confanon raised / but the loyalte and truth
of him ne of his kynnesmen endured not long / as the last book shall more
plainly show by the playsyr of god /

Now by force and strength of bataylle Charles entered in to mantryble / after
that Galafre was slain / not wythstondyng that alory the traytre was contrary
to him and many other matters capitulo viij
AT thentre of mantryble were much hurt people and confounded as well of
frenssh men as of sarasyns / and at that time the emperor bare him well / For
whom he attained with his sword named Ioyouse / he must needs deye he smote
so rudely / and that day was always by him Ganellon which did well his deuoyr /
The dyches of the town were deep and full of water wherein many were drowned
Thus as Charles passed tofore and his people after / He saw galafre on ye
ground which was not deed / and that seemed better a devil than a reasonable
person / And held always his axe in his hand / with which he had slain
thyrty frenssh men And the Emperor seeing the harm that he had done to the
frensshe men / anon commanded to slay him and so much they smote at him with
axes and stones that they slew him / The bruyt and noise was so great that
five mile about was anon known that the bridge of mantryble was taken and
conquered / wherefore there came / L / thousand sarasyns for to give aid to the
cytyzeyns of mantryble and to destroy the f^enssh men / The walls of the
town were of marble and so strong that it seemed a thing Impossyble to
conquer or destroy / To this meddle came a geau^t much fyers named Ampheon /
And had a wife named Amyotte / And she was departed fro her gesyne / For she had
borne two sons which were but iiij months old / and were two foot broad in
the breast and ten foot long as thystorye says / This geaunt opened the gate
and held in his hand a club of iron great and massyf / And when he was passed
that yate with his voys tenebrouse and dyabolyke he cried where is charles the
king of france / will he now bear with him the relyques to saint Denis / by
mahon / by the which I comfort my self / it were better for him old dotard
that he were now at paris / And late him know certainly that if thadmyral may
have him he shall never have mercy on him / but he shall do him be flayn and
hanged all quycke or brenne him in a fire / after that he had thus spoken he
smote down many f^^nsshe men with his club of (...) In this recountre were
(...) and founded so great a multitude of deed men that they lefted men to
pass / Charles which saw the facyon descended and light of his horse all
wroth in his courage / and set his (...) tofore him / with his sword (...)
his hand and his barons came after him against the grant (...) after that the
king and he were assembled / Charles with his sword Joyous smote him see
myghtely that he clefte him in two pyeces and myghtely recouerd his stroke that
he maad him fall to the earth / And so he was deed / wherefore the Sarasyns
were all moeued and affrayed / And as people enraged smote upon the Frensshe
men with darts plombetres and other engynes mortal /

And then Charles cried socours for to assemble his people / And with that
cry came to him Rychard of Normandye Reyner of genes / hoel of nauntes / and
Sir Ryol du (...) which all had courage like unto lions / These four barons
with charles made the paynyms to remeue / and to reentre ageyn by force in to
the town of man tryble / And anon the turks which were moo than x thousand
came to the yate for to shette it in making great defense with bows and other
shot beside them that came after / which kept the passages / which were well
as thystorye makes mencyon five thousand / but all they could not find the
manner to lift up the bridge / For it was conserned and kept against the
sarasyns by the frenssh men There was great bruyt in this recountre / And
though Charles doubted it was no meruaysse / For he knew well that if the
sarasyns had lift up the bridge to the yate of the town It had not be
possible to him to have passed over / And he seeing them reyse up toward the
yate great bars of iron / supposed not to have passed / And with a much
wooful heart began to wayle Roulland his neuewe and the other his fellows as he
should never have seen them Rychard of Normandye consyderyng this / escryed and
said Sir Emperor in the honor of god of may you not / but think to destroy
and smite down these Turks and god shall aid and help us / ye know well that
there is none so frank ne valyaunte / that will acoward him self / but that he
ought to be despised / and with good right / And I pray to god that he be
confounded that suffers him self to be taken a live for to dye afterward / and
that had not lever be hewn in pyeces than to return / And without more late
us auaunce us / For now it is need that each man prove his strength and the
valor of his person / with these words of a great courage enter in to the
town / Charles / Reyner / Hoel / Ryol / and Rychard / These five only each
with a sword in his hand / And ye ought to wete that they entered not without
great slaughter of turks and of Paynyms /

Charles seeing come great multitude of sarasyns cried a larme and socours much
hye and furyously / Ganellon understood him and had of him great pity / Not
wythstondyng at the last / he found him not good / and came to geffroy and
escryed haateuyle his fader / and the other his kynnesmen / which were armed
much rychely to the nombre of M / vij and / and al they came a foot for to
assail the yate /

The turks maad great deffence with brondes and bars of iron / and mortal
shot where as many were deed and hurt of the people of the said Ganelon /

Then alory the traytre said to ganellon / in faith we ben great foles for to
late us thus deye and suffer this torment / And after he said to ganellon yet /
late us goo and depart / Charles is within well empesshed / god forbede that he
ever depart / and thou may well see now / that of him and of Reyner we are
well avenged of the contradyctyons that they made to us and of their subgettes
also / And evil death mote he deye that follows them any ferther / for we may
win France at our ease and will and hold it without contradyctyon / Seen
that there is no baron that will be to us contrary / Ganellon ansuerd / God of
glory forbede that ever I should do such trayson to my rytful lord we hold of
him al our lands and seygnouryes / I should be holden for an over untrue man
if I consented to his death / we have none other cause but that we ought to do
our deuoyr for him when Alory understood him he enraged almoost for anger and
after said to ganellon / ye be a very fool that ye tarry when ye now may well
aduenge you / if the emperor Charles be slain / all the other barons shall have
their heedes smyton of / And thus we shall be aduenged on al our enemies /
Therefore love of and come on / Ganellon ansuerd god forbede that ever I should
be a traytre to my lord / Ne that I leave him vnholpen / but do my deuoyr to
aid him / I had lover to be dysmembred than to be shamed and blamed in this
deed / Of these words were evil content Alory and also geffroy daulteuyle in
such (...) that there was great debate emonge them / Upon this came Fyerabras
in good array and great point / and began to cry where is Charles /

The Traytre answered / Sir ye shall never see him / He is within enclosed / and
I (...) he be deed now / Fyerabras answered / And ye emonge you what do you
here / what (...) ye / why socoure ye him not in this need / ye may be
reproched of treson with good right / And after bygan to cry socours and aid
much loud / and by his voys all the frenss^ men came without any taryeng to
the belfroye / and fend Fyerabras and Ganellon that then had left the
Traytres at the enter of the bridge /

And Fyerabras thene was well Joyous when be saw that the bridge was not drawn
up And then he and Ganellon did gretely their deuoyr for to enter in to the
cite /

And when they were within and the traytres saw the town wo^ne by a manner to
do gretely their deuoyr entered in a foot and smote down with the other
comunelye / And great habundau^ce of blood run through the town out of the
deed bodies / that each man meruaylled that saw it / The paynyms cried and
brayed as wulues enfamysshed when they saw that they could not resyste them /
They sent to the admyral that he should socoure them / and cried on mahon and
Termagaunt that they would come to their aid / but for all that they were
dyscomforted sorowfully / put out of their habytacyons / robbed / pylled of
their rychesses and goods / and destroyed / Thus doing a messager departed
secretly for to goo to Aygremore for tacompte and tell the tidings of their
destructyons

How Amyotte a geantesse with a sithe grieved gretely the christian men and / how
her two sons were baptized of the Emperor Charles capitulo ix
When mantryble was taken many strokes were given / but when Amyotte the
geantesse knew and herd the cry of the cytezeyns which were troubled / She
was as black as pytche boylled / her eyes were read as brennyng fire she had a
great vysage and crooked as hye of length as a spear / and gretely affrayed of
the death of her husbond / and also aferde for her ij sons of which she was
late delyuerd / so she in a rage lepte out of her house / and fond a sithe
trenchau^t and meruayllously sharp / and came upon the frensshe men so
Impetuously that she maad great dyscomfyte / in such wise that none durst well
approach her / King Charles sceyng this was evil content of the death of his
people / and demanded a cross bow / And when it was lend / he shot so
right that he atteyned her between the brows so that she fyl down deed to the
earth / She began to cast out of her throat a flamme of fire much hydous /
Nevertheless she was smyton so with stones and things that she never moeued
after / wherefore after that / the yates of the town and other deffences were
not kept ne defended / but that Charles did his will of all / Great richesse
was found in that fair town / and the subgettes of the Emperor Charles were
there well refresshed of gold and silver which there habounded / For thadmyral
Ballant / by cause that place was so strong and sure had laid there great
tresours / The king ordained in such manner that both great and small were
well content with him / And there he abode three days in dapartyng and
destrybutyng the goods after the degrees and qualytrees of his subgettes / And
after as charles went sportyng by the river flagot / In a cave were founden
the ij sons young children of the fornamed geauntesse Amyotte of whom he was
well Joyous and were baptized / and one he named Roulland / and that other
Olyuer / and did do them well to be nourysshed / But after within two months
they were both founden deed in their heddes / wherefore the emperor was evil
content / Nevertheless in that same time which was the month of may that the
strong cite of mantryble was taken and put in subgectyon / charles made to
come to him Rychard of Normandye / Reyner of genes / hoel of nauntes / Ryol of
mauns / and took counceyl who should keep the bridge and passage of man tryble /
till they had destroyed ballant the admyral and delyuerd out of / prison the
other peers of fraunse / Rychard answered sir emperor me seems it should be
good that hoel and sir Ryol should abide for to keep yt bridge and town with
five thousand men and like as Rychard said so was it done / and there they ij
abode / and the hurt men for to be heled at their leyzer / and after with sown
of trompettes the host of the emperor began to depart toward aygremore / and
there was so much people and so great estate that it was merueylle / Thus as
they were well on their way / The Emperor went upon a little hylle for to
byholde his people and subgettes And seeing the multitude be lift up his eyes
to heaven and said / O lord god my creator which by thy grace and (...) sir
have made me lord and conduytour of this people / with right good heart I give
to the thankynges and land / Thou have given to me great puyssau^^^ sithe they
be at my will and commandment / After that he had said thus he blessed him
/ And in the name of Ihesus he took forth his way / And the said Emperor had
in his company an hundred thousand men well fyghtyng / And the Admyral had the
fyghtars of thyrtene contreyes / the frenssh men rode forth / Rychard of
normandye was in the auaunte guard / And the Duke Reyuer in that other / Anon
the tidings came to thadmyral that galafre was slain and that mantryble was
taken and dyscomfyted wherefore he swowned for sorrow and cried out haroo as a
man fro him self saying / ha / ha / god mahon thy power is naught / O cursyd
god and recreaunte thou art nothing worth to me / he is a much fool that
trusts in the when thou suffrest my men to be slain / and have consented to
my dishonor as I now well see / which outest well to have done the contrary /
This saying the admyral took a clubbe with his two hands and ran to mahon
and to his other gods / and smote Mahon so great a stroke upon the heed that
he fyl down and was al to broken / if thadmyral and the other paynyms were not
well abused / they might know clearly their Infydelyte and falls creaunce for to
Inuoke the images that can not speak ne give comfort and have no consolacion /
A little understanding and lack of wit and also contrary to nature / for to
give faith of help to a thing made with the hand of a man / Nevertheless
Sortybrant of Conymbres seeing the desolacyon of thadmyral / counceylled him
that as much as he might to chastyse him self of the Iniurye done to Mahon /
thadmyral said to him I may not enclyne to do to him obeyssaunce / Seeing that
Charles has won by his puyssaunce my cite and strong tour of mantryble /
where as I had my last comfort to keep me most sure / Sortybrant ansuerd Sir
admyral send forth an espy for to wete if the host of charles comes hither
against you / And if it be so / late us ride against him in bataylle to gyder /
And if ye may late him be taken / and hang his people or brenne them without
any mercy or pity / And then after ye may cast out of your tour these
glotons that keep it / and smite of the heed of Fyerabras thy sone that aydeth
them / when the admyral ballant had herd Sortybrant / consyderyng his
affectyon / humbly he returned to mahon purposyng to do as he had sad /

How the peers of France were assaylled more strongely than ever they were /
And the toure quasi put to therthe / and recomforted by the holy relyques by
them adoured and other matters capitulo x
SOrtybrant prayed so much thadmyral / and with him the old king Coldroe
tempested him and brullant de mommyere that for thyniurye that he had done to
Mahon tofore them al he should make amends / The admyral being content for
their affectyon swear that he should encreace Mahon and Augment of a thousand
weyt after their custom of fyn gold and other precyosytees / And anon did do
sown trompettes and other Instruments / at the sown of whom were assembled
sarasyns Inuumerable al armed / And the admyral maad to bring his engynes for
to / throw great stones at the tour for to bring it down / and also for to
destroy the frensshe men and his daughter / And thus more fervent than ever he
had been came for tassayle the toure and lay their engynes thereto / with which
the paynyms made five great hooles in the toure / that through the least might
pass a carte at his case when this was done Olyuer and Rolland with their
sheldes to fore them and their swerdes in their hondes stood in the wyndowes /
and yet they were not so hardy emonge them but that they were abusshed / not
wythstondyng they had good will to defend them / Always him that they might
attain with stones or other things they so hurt him that he did them no more
hurt ne damage / This doing thadmyral cried / O my friends and subgettes do
your deuoyr to bring to the earth this toure For if ye so do ye shall have my
love entyerly / And after I shall make Florypes the putayne to deye shamefully
in a brennyng fire / for she has well deserved it / doing to me the dishonor
that every man knows /

After these words the paynyms were more fervent than they had been tofore /
and surmounted by strength scaled the toure and mounted up and entered in at
holes in such wise that the ^ barons held not but yt best seage that was /
Rolland seeing theys said to them / lords and brethern in thonour of god our
maker / late us with one courage (...) us valyauntly / else we shall not pass
this day but that we shall be surprysed taken and deffeated / Brother and fellow
said Olyuer we seen here of us x as long as it shall please our creator / and
we been al good fyghtars / In the name of God I counceyl that we issue our for
to assail our enemies / I had lever to dye there without and suffer to be
hewn / than to deye here within with dishonor / Ogyer the danoys and the
other said semblably / Florypes seeing this was al abashed and demanded the
barons if they would goo out for to goo assaylle the paynyms / and said to them
/ ye noble knights of honor and of good party / I pray to god that at this
time give you grace to do well / And I promise you if ye put them out from
this assault I shall show to you a thing whereof ye shall be joyeful with tho
thordes the barons goo smite and hew down the turks so vygorously that many
of them were deed and hurt which were in the holes of the wall / and smote
them with stoones in the tour in such wise that they were cast in to the
dyches and drowned / And anon as they had gotten thoo holes they stopped them
and fast enclosed them / and after florypes axed first of naymes duc of
vauyere / and of Thyerry duc of Ardayne and said / Lords on a time ye promised
me and swear / that ye should not do any thing against my will / I will show to
you the crown of Ihesus and two of the nails that he was nailed with to the
cross / which I have long kept The barons heryng this wept for Joy / and
sworen to her / that they should do no thing to her but al loyalte and truth
/ Florypes went then and fette a little coffre much rich and fair and
tofore them she opened it / and as soon as the relyques were taken and vnwounden
there was seen a great clerenes and a meruayllous resplendysshour /

Then the barons kneled down to the earth deuoutely smytyng them self on
their breasts by contrycyon of heart / Duc Naymes of bouyere was the first that
kyssed them with great reverence / and the other after / and after came to the
wyndowes / For the paynyms were mounted on hye And as soon as they saw them
they tombled down to ye ground deed and al to broken / when Naymes saw that /
he said / O lord god of glory which may do al thing / I thank the and
give to the lawde and praysyng / For now I see well and know that these ben the
relics of whom we have often spoken / And Incontinent he took hardynes and
courage / and after said to his felawes / Brethern now we be recomforted so
that we shall never fere ye doubt paynyms ne sarasyns / And after Florypes
remysed the relyques in the coffret honestly / Thadmyral saw the princes at
the wyndowes and his daughter with them / and he full of a falls entencyon
escryed her with an hye voys by cause he would be vnderstonden / O florypes fair
daughter I see well where thou art / A great fool was thy fader when he trusted
the / and full of folysshe counceyl was he / that put in thyn hand by the moyen
of thy la^gage the first prisoners / I have herd say long sithe / that a man
that trusts in a woman of thing of Importance is a much fool / but
nevertheless thy puterye shall not endure long / as I trust / For I swear to
the that I shall depart the love that thou have with the glotons of France /
and without pity I shall do brenne you al / Florypes herd these words and
took a baston in her hand and made a sign as though she had menaced her fader
/ wherefore thadmyral seeing that began to sown to godre his people / and
commanded to shote and lose the Instruments against the toure in such wise
that anon a great party of the wall was overthrown to therthe / Then the
barons doubted much of them upon the wall / And Rolland Olyuer and Ogyer went
in to a chamber where as were / Mahon Appolyn Termagaunte and Margotte gods
of the Paynyms which were much rich And Rolland took Appolyn which was heavy
and threw it upon the Paynyms / Olyuer lift up termagaunte / and Ogyer
Margotte / and smote with them the sarasyns in such wise that them that they
attained did them never hurt after /

when thadmyral saw thus his gods vytupered and thrown he took such anger
and so great ire in his courage that for sorrow he tombled down as a deed man
to the earth / Sortybrant with much sorrow took him up and many wept and made
great desolacyon for sorrow / and after thadmyral said / lords and friends he
shall ever be my friend and specyal byloued yt will aduenge the shame that these
gloto^s have done to my gods / Sortybra^t did great pain to recomforte him
saying that in short time he should be avenged on them al seen that the toure is
broken in moo than xv parties / O Ma / hon said the admyral thou have well
forgoten me / at the most need thou fayllest me / thou art now so old that
thou dotest / I have seen the day that y^ had great puyssaunce / Sortybrant
ansuerd / Sir ye have an evil custom / when ye speak so evil against Mahon / Ye
know well that there was never borne ne never shall be so good a god he gives
us pleute of where / of wyn and of other goods also / he shall do for us when
he has bythought him / he is yer evil content for the stroke that ye smote
him on the nose / Abide a little till he be better aduysed / And the frensshe men
shall resde them unto you so that ye shall hold you pleased / Upon these words
Mahon was brought tofore him / And a devil entered in to him which said in
this manner after that he had adoured him / Admyrall rich lord ne dyscomfort
you not / do sown your trompettes and horns and assemble your people and after
assaylle the toure / and at this time ye shall take the Frensshe men / with
these words thadmyral was al rejoiced / and all thengynes and Instruments he
did do set against the tour and threw stones and maad great shot against
the toure which was then al to broken / and almoost al overthrown / The
peers of France seeing this had great doubt of danger / and not without cause
/ Nevertheless Ogyer the danoys said to his felawes / O loyal companyons
replenysshed of fydelyte / For any pain or doubt of death emonge us late none
be found with any treason / ne suffer to enter in to him any evil thought of
Infydelyte and cowardyse / ye see now yt the tour gooth to ground And almoost
these sarasyns be medsed with us / But as touching to me I swear by god my
maker / that tofore my soul shall depart fro my body / if I have the
puyssaunce to hold in my hand Cortayn my sword / I shall make so great a
dyscomfyture of these paynyms that every man shall meruaylle / with these words
Rolland byhelde durandal / and Olyuer with eueryche of the other byhelde their
swerdes / and were all renewed with strength and courage / And al with one
will goon upon the sarasyns / and there did such dylygence / that allewaye
they were lords of the toure / and made the sarasyns their enemies to goo
abacke / Florypes consyderyng their affayre was sorrowful that no socours came to
them and also remembryng the menaces of her fader thadmyrall / But Guye of
bourgoyn recomforted her always in such wise that of al she was content /

How the peers of France had tidings if thoost of charles / and the admyral
also / and how Ganellon bare him merueyllously / which allone was sent to the
admyral / and what he did capitulo x
THe Frensshe men being in this contynuel pain of bataylle for to defend y^
toure Duc Naymes of bauyere went up on hye and saw out of a wyndowe / and
saw bynethe in a valeye the sign of saint denis which was brought hastily /
and after a great company of men of arms / And thought in him self that they
came for to socour and aid them / and anon sent for his felawes for to come
and see them / As Soon as Florypes understood it / she came to Guy of bourgoyn
saying / O glorious vyrgyn marie mother of Ihesus worshypped mote ye be for
these tidings that I have herd / O noble knight guye of bourgoyn my dear love
approach ye to me if it playse you and kiss me / Of the Joy of Florypes were
Ioyeful the earls and lords / ye may think that they were well comforted when
they saw the standard of france wherein was the dragon well fygured / Great
Joy and great consolacion was emonge them / and they had cause seen the
danger wherein they were / Anon a paynym came to thadmyral and said to him
that Charles with an hundred thousand men of arms came making great bruyt /
The king Coldroe counceylled anon that every man should be armed / and that
they should goo mete with him at the first point / His counceyl was approved by
thadmyral and by the other / wherefore anon / L / thousand turks were assembled
in great point for to keep the great vale of Iosue / to the end that he might
not come in to Aygremore / Rolland saw Rychard of Normandye with his confanon
raised up which came al before / and all tarried in a medowe for to bayte and
refresshe their horses and to tarry there all the night which was nyghe / And
without making lodgyses or other thing / they there rested them al night /
For their tents were left al mantryble / On the morn erly the Emperor did
to arm his people and set them in good (...) and in great point / And af^^^
sent for Fyerabras and said to him / Right dear friend thou know that I
have do the (...) baptized wherefore I love (...) the better / if thou mytest
(...) chase and make that thy (...) baptized and renye ma^o^ (...) al his
dyabolike gods I (...) be well glad and Joyous And I promise to the that of
(...) goods I shall not take (...) And if he will not so do I promise that by
force I shall (...) against him / and if he take (...) wit it not me^ne conne me
(...) / maulgre / for I may not (...) Sir Emperor said Fyerabras take a
messager / and (...) demand him if he will so (...) as ye say / and I shall be
(...) / For if he gaynsaye it / I shall never pray for him no have pity of him
though I see him hewn and deye / Hereupon charles demanded Reyner and ryche^d
of Normandye which were his next counceyllours and said to them / Lords
whom seem you most propy^^ for to send on this message to the Admyrall / By
mine aduys ganellon should be good therefore if he would / for to recounte and
speak holy (...) message / I know him for well suffysaunt / and ye know well
that he did well his deuoyr at the enter of mantryble / if ye will consent he
shall do the message Rychard answered and Reyner also that he should do well the
message / The king sent for ganellon and said to him / My friend we have
chosen you for to goo say to thadmyral Ballant that he be baptized and renye
mahon / and that he take Ihesu Christ for his god / and that he believe in him
and in his passion that he suffered for all humayn creatures and after that he
yield to me my barons which he holds in his prison / and also the resyques
that long time I have demanded of him / and if he will do this / we shall leave
to him his contreye and his lands / and if he will do otherwise / we shall make
to him mortal war / and shall take of him no mercy / Ganellon was content for
to goo thither allone And took and set on his helm and mounted upon his horse
named gascon / and henge on his neck his shield / wherein was painted the lion
/ and after went in to the vale of Iosue hastily / and anon he was taken of
the turks that kept the passage / but when they knew that he was a messager
for to speak to thadmyral / they troubled him not but let him goo / and he
tarried not till that he came tofore thaby tacyon of thadmyral / and he lent
upon his spear with a knyghtly countenance / and much resembled a baron of
great valor for to say well his message / when thadmyral knew of his coming he
came to him / And thenue Ganellon spoke hardyly to him in this manner / Sarasyn
take heed and understand me / I am a messager of the noble charles king of
france and right mighty Emperor / and he sends the word by me / that thou
renye and forsake Mahon and thyn other gods dyabolyke / and believe in Ihesu
christ the redemptour of all the world which took on him humanyte and suffered
death cruel and bitter in the tree ofithe cross for to redeem all the world /
and if thou so do / thou art assured not only to deye and also not to lose thy
land ne none of thy good / but thou shall always be byloued of him and of
Fyerabras thy sone / and if thou wylt not accord herto / and withstand it /
know for certain that of Charles thou art deffyed and al thy people / and if
thou wylt save thy self think to flee and wythdrawe the fro this contreye For
if thou may be taken and holden thou shall be delyuerd to dangerous death / and
all thy subgettes shall be die smembred / and slain / and after he shall give thy
royame and thy rychesses to his scruauntes / Therefore advise the well / when
thadmyral had herd him / he was almoost in a rage of his words / and by
destresse of anger he took a staff for to smite the messager and said to him /
Gloton payllard thou art dysmesured in thy langage by mahon to whom I am yeuen
at this time thou have be over hardy / and little loved the Charles when he
sent the to me / For thou shall be well sure that thou shall never recounte to
him thy message / Ganellon seeing that he was not well sure with them he took his
sword which was heavy and sharp / and gaf wythal a stroke to buillant of
mo^myere in the breast that he ouerthrewe and fyl at the feet of the admyrall
which seeing that / escryed much strongely tauenge him / Then with this voys
assembled moo than fyfty thousand turks for to take Ganellon which ran
after him through the vale of Iosue / but he escaped them al and was not taken /
Due Naymes was at a wyndowe / and saw him chaced / and demanded Rolland and
Olyuer what he was / and they knew for certain that he was christian / and by
presumyng made emonge them they Iuged that it was Ganellon / that had spoken to
thadmyral / Alas said Rolland I pray to Ihesus our redemour that he grant
him grace to pass well without danger / I shall be evil content if he come not
to his good desire / The other barons sayden semblably / and prayed god to keep
him fro peril / Ganellon ran always forth till he came to the top of a
montayne / and there he turned him against the Paynyms / and saw coming to him
a great paynym of the cite of Aygremore / and anon he took his sword named
murgall (...) trenchaunte and atteyned the mynem upon the helm / and (...) him
to the breast / And after he slew Tenebre which was ^^^der of king Sortybrant
/ ^^^uer saw al his feat and (...) to Rolland / Brother behol^^ (...)
vnlyaunce that this baron (...) I pray god that he (...) him / And wete ye well
that in my heart I love him / Save you and charles I love none bet^^r / Now would
god that I were in his company / I shall make great marterdom on these Paynyms
/ Nevertheless he was ^^^^gely chaced of the paynyms / But when they saw the
host of Charles / they returned aback and went and told the affayre to
thadmyral / and how Charles had moo than an hundred thousand fyghtyng men /
wherefore they cou^ceylled that every man should arm him / and that counceyl was
approved / but when sortybuant knew that his brother was deed he made to come
an Innumerable company of sarusyns rauenge his death in menacyng to do harm to
Charles / Of his entencyon was much glad thadmyral / by cause he might the
better come to his desire /

How Charles emperor ordained ten bataylles / and how they did and were
recountred of the puyssaunce of the admyral / where as the emperor did
meruaylles and of other matters capitulo xij
When Ganellon was comen to king Charles / the emperor ordained x bataylles
after that Ganellon had told his message which was such Sir emperor I say
to you that thadmyral ne fereth you ne your deeds / neither god ne his saints
/ I was well happy that I escaped / For I have been chaced with xx thousand
sarasyns after that thadmyral would have had me / and after these words I slew
one of their kings / where fore he was praised of the king and other / And
anon they sowned horns and trompettes / and was open war on all parts in
thoost of Charles / Rolland herd the sown and the voys of the frensshe host
/ whereof he and all the barons were al rejoiced and made good thyere / when the
ij hoostes recountred all the country shone of their arms / there were so many
of them / after as I have said tofore / king charles made ten bataylles / In
the first he ordained Rychard of Normandye / Due Reyner of genes had the second
/ Ganellon the third A lory the fourth / Geffroy the fyfthe / Machayre the vj /
Hardre the seventh / Amangius the viij / Sampson the ix / And of the tenthe was
conduytour charles the king / and in each bataylle were x thousand men of arms
well fyghtyng at lest / when Ballant the admyral saw the king coming he said
to vuillant / who shall be the first that shall enter in to bataylle with an
hundred thousand paynyms / and said that if he took Charles he should not slay
them ne fyerabras for he would after smite of their heedes / and upon this
point the war was open / and Baullant began to goo a great boroedraut tofore
the other / and began to cry / haw / haw / where is charles the emperor with
his evil chere too I come to the / thou have enterprysed a great folly when
thou passest the sea / and over late thou shall repent the / On this day shall
be the end of thy life / and of the subgettes life / And without fault thou
shalt be yolden to thadmyral and all thy centreye shall be destroyed /
The Emperor herd well these words / wherefore all in a furye he let run his
horse and came against the paynym and attained him in such a wise that his
harnoys brake / and after he drew his sword and never left him till he was
deed / fro thens with his spear he came to a turk king of pyetrelee / and
smote him in the breast that he fyl deed to the earth / and when his spear was
broken / he did great deuoyr with Ioyouse his swerd / for him that he attained
did never hurt after / At that time he bare him meruayllously / that one of the
hoostes meddled each with other in such wise / that there was never seen war
so mortal for they that were living were let by them that were deed / Then
emonge the paynyms there was a turk named Tenebres which cain making great
buryt upon the frensshe men / and attained first the noble Iehan of pou^tayse
upon his shield and brake it in pye^s and smote him through the body that he fyl
deed to the earth and after drew his sword and put to death huon and guernyer
thauncyen / and after said to the frensshe men / that on that day Charles and
his subgettes had lost their might / Rychard of Normandye had despyte of his
words and came ageynste him and attained him so daungerously that he brake his
hawberke and brake his shield in quarters ^ so smote him yt he fyl down deed
without any more repro^^^^^ and saying evil words / and after by force of
strength they pass^^ the vale of Iosue / and came and fond thadmyral with
all his puyssaunce / which was accompanied with (...) kings crowned and with

How in this bataylle following Sortybrant was slain by Reyner fader of Olyuer
/ and after how thadmyral did meruaylles and great ennoye to the frensshe men
capitulo xiij
BAllant thadmyral rode upon an horse / the best rennyng of all the contreye
right well armed / and it was black as a more / and him self was great of body
/ well membred and had his herd hangyng to the sadel which was white as snow
/ and after did do sown his trompettes and horns tassemble his host / and
made the archers to goo before which could well shote with bows turauoys / and
al furyously that one against the other goo shote and make mortal war / so
that the shot fl^we in thayer thycker than hayl / So much people was there
slain / that the ways were empesshed and let by deed bodies / The Duke
Reyner passed through forth / and the first that he encountered was king
Sortybrant / and gaf to him a great stroke without faynyng that his shield
auaylled him not / his hauberk al to brake / so that he made his spear to
plonge and bayne in his body so deep that he abode there deed like a be /
and after with his sword made so great murdre and slaughter of the false turks
yt it was meruaylle / Anon the admyral knew the death of Sortybrant / whereof
he was almoost out of his wit in a rage / and sithe said / O Sortybrant my
special friend / I see well now that I shall be avenged if I benge not thy death /
with these words he maad his horse to run upon ye frenssh men so despytously
that whom he attained he put to death / and came to huon of myllan and slew
him / then he did great dommage / and fought that time so strongely that he
put to death well seven frensshe men and xiiij Normans much valyantly saying / O
ye unhappy frensshe men I shall now make you know that thadmyral of spain is
comen / in this day shall thoost of france be destroyed / and shall never
repair home ageyn in to france / I shall led away with me the king Charles
with his florisshed berd and I shall do hang or brenne him and also with him
Rolland and Olyuer and their fellows / and with these words the paynems
enhardyed them in such wise yt they did gretely their deuoyr against the
frensshe men / At this meddle the count ganellon / haldre / alory / and geffroy
daulteuyle and yt lygnage did gretely their deuoyr and bare them well / For in a
short space by them were slain moo than a M paynyms / Thadmyral most valiant
of the sarasyns attained the count myllon by his helm / that almoost he had
abyden in the place / and with a stroke thadmyral smote of his horse head that
he fyl to the earth and after he took him and laid him tofore him for to have
born him away / but the lygnage of ganellon saved him / notwythstondyng that
many of them were slain and deed / Nevertheless the frensshe men surmounted the
paynyms / and that was by the aid of fyerabras which for love of Charles did
fight and made great dyscomfyture of the sarasyns / for there he put to death
Tempeste / and the old Rubyon and moo than fyfty other of these mastyns
myscrea^ntes / and he there bare him in such wise / that there was not one
person that durst come tofore him to resyste him /

How the peers of France which were in the toure came out when they saw the
host / and how thadmyral was taken and holden prysonner capitulo xiiij
THe paynyms and frensshe men always perseueryng in mortal bataylle could not
make the end each one of other / For the multitude of the paynyms was so great
that they myt not be dyscomfyted / when the barons that were in the tour saw
the fayt / and that they that kept the toure were goon to the socours and cry
of thadmyral they sprange out and each took an horse of them yt were deed which
ran at al adventure / and (...) also took his sword in his hond and suddenly
came upon the sarasyns for to pass through them to the frensshe host / and made
so great bruyt that the most hardyest of the paynyms gaf them way and let
them pass / and in especyal rolland / for where be smote with durandal / came
never afte^ tofore him / and at this departing was derly recomanded guy of
b^ur^^goyn of florypes / for she had fere of him / Nevertheless when they were
assembled with the other without letyng them to be (...) wen / went upon the
sarasyns and held them so short / that anon they slew them in such royle ^
the other put them to flight / for there was never lark fled more ferfully
tofore y^ sper^awke than the sarasyns fled tofore rolla^d / Thadmyral knew
well his destructyon by the coming of the peers that were in yt toure and cried
with an h^e voys / mahon my god to whom I have given my self and have done to
so much honor / thou have forygoten me / Remember me now / For and ever I may
get the I shall beat the both flanks head and vysage / and also put out thyn
eyes falls recreaunt god that thou art / he thus saying he was so pursyewed and
smyton that he fyl down under his horse and taken and not slain at the request
of his sone fyerabras / to the end that he should be aduysed to believe in Ihesu
christ and in the holy Trynyte / and bycome christian and al his contreye / Then
the bataylle took an end / and he that would not be converted was in contynent
put to death / Sum fled / and sum were taken / Then after this the
Frensshe men went and unarmed them / and Charles saw there his barons whom he
desired so much to see / and in especial his neuew rolland and Olyuer whom he
loved so much and were so greatly valiant / It can not be said ne expressed
the Joy that was emonge them and the consolacyon and reioycyng of king charles
was Inestymable / Then they recounted all things what were happend to them
/ and of their dangers and Ieopardyes which they had escaped and sorrows and
lamentacions that they had endured / wherefore Charles and many other wept for
pity / And this endured many days / there where as the hurt men and seek were
heeled / and they that were hole passed their time in deduyte tryumphe and Joy
/

How ballant thadmyrall for any admonycyon that was showed to him / would not be
baptized / and how after guy of bourgoyn espoused florypes / and was crowned
king and she queen of that contreye capitulo xv
When charles had al appeased he took balla^t the admyral tofore his noblesse /
and said to him in this manner / ballant al creatures reasonable owen to give
synguler honor and pertyculer love to him that has given to them being /
knowleche / and life / and it is well requesyte and nedeful that he have honor
and penerence that has made heaven and earth and all that therein enhabyteth /
wherefore by good right he is superyour and abouen al / And a great abusyon is
comprysed in him / which gives faith and hope in that which he has made with
his hondes and of matter deed / Insensyble and that has neither reason ne soul
/ as thy gods dyabolyke which may not ne can give consolacyon to their
subgettes / wherefore I warn the for the health of thy soul and for the
preseruyng of thy body and of thy goods that thou take a way all these
Iniquytees and / perverse affectyons / and believe in the holy Trynyte / fader /
sone / and holy ghoost / one only god almighty / and believe that the sone of
god for to repair thoffence of our formest fader adam descended in to this
world and took humanyte in the womb of the blessed vyrgyn marie which was al
pure and without spotte / And believe in the artycles of the faith / and obey
and keep his comandementes which he has given to us for our health and believe
how he was taken of the Jews and by envy hanged on the cross for to redeem us
fro the pains of hell / Believe his resurrexyon and ascencyon in his body
gloryfyed / and the other things as the holy baptesme which he has
establysshed with the other sacraments / and if thou wylt thus believe thou
shall be saved / and thou shall neither lose body ne goods / Thadmyral answered
that he would no thing do so / and swear that for death ne for life he would not
leave Mahon / The Emperor holdyng a naked swerd said to him that if he forsook
not Mahon he should do put him to death / Fyerabras seeing this kneled down to
therthe and prayed his fader to do as the emperor had said / Thadmyral fered
the death and said that he was content that the font should be blessed /
Charles was glad and did do make ready a font with fair water / in a fair
vessel / and the bishop with other mynystres of the church did halowe the
font and made all ready / and after when thadmyral was vncladde / the bishop
demanded him saying / Sir ballant forsake ye mahon / and cry ye mercy to god
of heaven for your trespa^^s and believe ye in Ihesu christ the sone of the vyrgyn
marye / when thadmyral understood these words / al his body began to tremble /
than in despyte of Ihesu^ he spytte in the font / and caught the bysshoop and
would have drowned him in the font / and had plonged him therein / ne had not
Ogyer have been which let him / and yet notwythstondyng (...) gaf a great
stroke to thadmyral that the blood came out of his mouth habondantly / Of
(...) were al abashed that were present / and then the king said to
Fyerabras / ye be my specy^^ friend / Ye see that your fader will never be
crystened / And also the oultrage that he has done to the font / it can not
be excused / but that be must be deed and dysmembred /

Fyerabras required him yet of a little pacyence / and if he would not amend him
/ that then he should do his will / Florypes the daughter of the Admyrall
seeing this said / O Sir Emperor wherefore delay ye so much to put this
devil to death / I retche not though he be put to death / so that I only may
have guye of bourgoyn to mine husbond / whom I have so much desired / Fyerabras
answered fair suster ye have great wrong / For I ensure you and swear by god
which has made me / that I would that I had lost two of my members on the
condycyon that he were a good christian man and were baptized and byleued in
Ihesu christ / ye wot well that he is our fader / which has engendered us / we
ought to honor him and to love his health / ye are well obstynat when ye have of
him no pity / And after in weeping said to his fader / O most dyer fader I
pray you to be better aduysed and by love in him that has fourmed you to his
image / which is Ihesus god souerayn / like as the emperor has said / and leave
mahon which has neither wit ne reason / ne no thing is but gold and stones
whereof he is composed / if ye thus do / ye shall do to us great Joy / and of
your enemies ye shall make friends /

Ballant ansuerd / fool and glouton that thou art speak no more to me thereof
thou art al out of reso^ / I shall never believe in him that deyed v C year a
goon / and acursed be he that puts in his believe that he is arysen fro death
to life / by mahon my god if I were on my horse back / or I were taken I should
anger charles that fool / when fyerabras had al vnderstonden him he said to
charles that he should do with him his playsyr / For by good right he ought to
deye / Anon the emperor demanded who would slay balla^t the unmeasurable felon /
Then Ogier was present which hated him in his heart / and forthwyth he smote
of his heed / and Fyerabras pardo^ned him gladly / Then after this florypes
said to Rolland that he should accomplysshe his promesses between her and guy of
bourgoyn / rolla^d ansuerd ye say troth / and after said to guye / Sir ye
remember well what words and love has been between you and the curtoys Florypes
keep your troth and promise to her / Guy ansuerd that he was ready to do all that the emperor would have him to do / Charles was content / Then anon
before them all she was despoyled and vnclad her for to be baptized / She
being there al naked showed her beauty which was right white and well formed so
playsaunt and amerouse for the formosyte of her person that every man
merueylled / For she had her eyes as clear as two sterres / a fair forhede and
large / her nose right well stondyng in the mids of the vysage / her chekes
were reed and whyt meddled / her brows compaced as it had been a little shadow
to the color of the vysage / her heyr shynyng as gold and that in so good an
order accumyled / that it henge bynethe her knees / her mouth was well composed
with an attemperat rou^denes / a small long neck / and her sholdres fair and
well syttyng / and ij pappes tofore small round and somewhat enhaunced like ij
round apples And so well was she made and so amerouse / that she smote the
hertes of many / and enfla^med their entencyon with concupyscence / and
specially of charles the Emperor / how well that he was auncyen and old / and
in the font which was ordained for the Admyral her fader she was baptized /
And charles / and Duc thyery of ardayne were her godfaders without chaunchyng
her name / And anon after when she was honorably cladde / the bishop wedded
them / and after the emperor commanded to bryngeforth the crown of ballant / and
crowned with al guy of bourgoyn and Florypes / And the bishop sacred and
blessed them And so tho said guy was king of that contreye / and gaf a party
to Fyerabras by condycion / that if Fyerabras would have it / he should hold it
of guye / and all that ever guye should have / he should hold it of charles /
After this the feast of the weddyng and espousaylles endured viij days / And
charles abode there two months and two days / till that the contreye was well
assured

How Florypes delyuerd the relics to the emperor / and how they were proved by
miracle and of the retournyng of Charles and of the end of this book /
CHarles did such dylygence in aygremore and in the contreye adjacent that he
that would not be baptized was put to death and so serched oueral / And on a
sunday after mass he sent for florypes and said to her / fair doughtre ye
know how I have crowned you and maad you queen of this contre / I have
accomplys shed your desire as to guye of bourgoyn your husbond / And more over
ye be baptized and in way of sauacyon / and ye have one of the valyauntest
body that is from hens in to Affrranue / And he and fyerabras your brother shall
have this regyon / And I shall leave with him xx M of my subgetes to the end
that the paynyms be always in dread / but ye have not yet showed to me nothing
of the holy relyques that ye keep / Florypes answered / Sir emperor they shall
be ready when it pleseth you / and then she brout forth the chest in which
they were honestly / The Emperor kneled down on both his knees / and enclyned
both with heart and body / and bad the bishop to opene it and show them / and
so he did / And first he showed the precious crown with which Ihesu Christ was
crowned with / which was of pryckyng thorns and of Ionqnes of the sea / and
with great devotion it was showed and adoured And many there wept and wayled
the death of our lord Ihesu Christ and were in great deuocy on and contemplacyon
/ The bishop which was devout and wise would preue it / And lift it upon hye
in the air / and wythdrewe his hond / and the crown abode by it self in the
air / and then the bishop certefyed to the peyle that was present / that it
was the crown of Ihesu christ / which he had on his head in the time of his
passion / Then every man honored it deuoutely / and it had so great an
odor that eueryche meruaylled / and after the bishop took the naylles by
which god had his haudes and feet perced and preued them as he had proved the
crown tofore / and semblably they abode in the air myraculously / And Charles
seeing all this thanked humbly god in saying / O lord god eternal which have
given to me grace that I have surmounted mine enemies Infydels / and have put
and set me in the way and given conduyte to find your relyques which I
have so long desired / I humbly render and give to you thanks and praysynges
/ For now my country may well say that it shall be perpetuel honor to hit to
possode and have this precious tresour when it shall be contained therein / The
bishop blessed all the people there in making the sign of the cross with
the said relyques / and after he set them deuoutely ageyn in their places And
the emperor did do set them on a rich cloth of gold deuoutely / And when
they were thereon / the remenaunt that abode of them as small pyeces he took
them deuoutely and put them in his glove / and after he being in purpoos to
return in to his contreye / he threw the glove to a knight / but the knight
took none head and took it not / and when charles was a litel withdrawn he
took head of his glove / and returned and saw his glove in which the said
small pyeces of the said relyques were / abode hangyng in thayer without
susteynyng of any thing / Then was this miracle seen euydently and al this
was showed to the people / For it abode in that manner whiles they might have
goon half a leghe / And by this they were al reconfermed to say that there was
none abusyon in byleuyng and adouryng the said relyques / And these things
tofore writon in this second book ben vnderstonden in the best party and
sygnyfycacion that I can or would say / And I have not said any thing but that I
have been well informed by writing And as for the book ensuyng / it shall make
mention of sum bataylles / and of the end of the barons of france of whom
I have tofore spoken al alonge /

Here begins the iij book which conteyneth two parties by the chapytres
following declared /
The first party of the third book conteyneth xiiij chapytres and speaks of
the wars made in spain and of two meruayllous geauntes /
How Saint James appyered to Charles / and how by the moyen and the conduyte of
the sterres he went in to galyce / and what cytres he subdued ca j
CHarles the noble Emperor after he had taken much pain for to mayntene the
name of god / for tenhaunce the christian faith / and to bring all the world in
one true faith and believe / and that he had gotten many contrees / he purposed
never more to fight ne to make bataylle / but to rest and led forth a
contemplatyf life in thankyng his maker of ye grace that he had given to him in
surmountyng his enemies / Nevertheless on a night it bawed him / that he byhelde
the heaven (...) saw a quantyte of sterres in ^^dre tendyng all the night one
way and one path / And they began at the sea of frysebond in passing between
alemayn and ytalye / between France and guya^ne / And passed right the said
sterres by gascoyne / basle / Navarre / and espayne / which contrees he had
then by his puyssaunce and contynuel pain conquered and maad christian / And
after the end of the said sterres thus going in order came unto galyce where as
the body of the holy appostle was / he not knowing the propre place / Every
night charles byhelde the way of the said sterres / and thought much
contynuelly what this might be / and that it was not without cause / In one
night emonge the other that charles thought on this way / a man appyered to
him in vyly on which was so fair so playsaunte and so shynyng that it was
meruaylle which said to him / what do thou my fair sone / Charles being al
rauysshed answered / who art thou fair sir / That other answered I am James the
appostle of Ihesu Christ / the sone of Zebedee / and propre brother of saint
Johan the euangelyst / and am he whom god chaas to preche the christian faith and
his doctrine in the land of galyce and of galylee / by his holy grace / and he
whom herod did put to death by sword / and my body abides emonge the sarasyns
which have entreated it vylaynsly / and lies in a place which is not known
/ But I merueylle that thou have not c^nquerd my land / Seen and consyderyd
that thou have conquered so many regyons towns and cytees in the world /
wherefore I do the to wete / that like as god has chosen the and made the
superyor in worldly puyssaunce above al other kings and worldly princes / in
like wise among al them that lyuen thou art chosen of god after the conduyte of
the sterres to deliver my land fro the hand of the mescreaunt sarasyns and
enemies of crystendom / And to the end that thou sholdest know in to what place
thou sholdest goo / thou have seen on the heaven the sterres by dyuyne
magnyfycence / And for to obtain the more Joy and gretter glory in heaven /
by haultayn and great puyssaunce thou shall surmounte thyn enemies / and in
that same place thou shat make and do edefye a church in my name / to the
which shall come the christian people of al regyons for to get health and pardon
of their sin / After that thou shall have vysited my sepulture and have made
the way sure / and ordained christian men for to keep and conserve the place /
it shall be a memoyre perpetuell / Thus in this manner appyered three times saint
James to the emperor Charles / After these vysyons and certyfycacyons of god /
he called and assembled his subgettes / whom he did do put a great multitude
in good point / and after took his way / and drew toward the contre where
the sterres had showed the way aforesaid / and came first in to spain / and
the first cite that was rebelle to him was panpy lo^ne which was right strong
of murayl and towers / and garnysshed with sarasyns / and he abode tofore it
three months or he could find manner to confou^de it / Then Charles knew
not what to do but to pray god and saint James for whom he went that in the
virtue of his name he might take that cite / and said in this manner / Fair lord
god my maker help me that am comen in to this contre^ for to enhaunce the
christian faith / for to establysshe and maytene thyn holy name / And also thou
holy saint James by the reuelacyon of whom I am in this Iourneye / I reqnyre
the that I may subdewe this cytee and enter therein / for to show the
mysbyleuyng people the cause of their error / to the end that this beginning may
the better determyne the end of mine entencyon / As Soon as Charles had
fynysshed his oryson / the walls of the cite which were of marble
merueillously strong overthrew to the earth and fyl all in pyeces / and after
charles and his host entered in to the cite / and he that would be baptized and
believe in god without fyctyon was saved and put a part / and who said the
contrary was forthwyth put to death / All the people of that contre when they
knew of these tidings and meruayllous operacyons of this cite turned in to
Ruin at the simple postulacyon of charles without contradyctyon came and
yielded them to the mercy of king charles / And thus many were baptized / and
chyrches were ordained / and all the contreye reduced to certain trybute under
the fydelyte of the emperor charles and brought their trybutes fro the cytees
with out any other gaynsayeng in sign of seygnourye /

Of the cytees gotten in espayne by charles / and how sum were by him
destroyed /
AFter that charles had the domynacyon / auasi in all espayne / he came to the
scpulture of Saint James where he did his devotion and made deuoutely his
prayers / and after came to a place in yt ^ond which was so far that he might
goo no ferther / and there fyyed and pyght his spear / and that place was
called petronium / and thanked god and saint James / that by their suffrau^ce
he was comen so far / without any contradye tyon surely unto such place
that he might pass no ferther / And in that land who that would by leave in god
/ tharchebysshop Turpyn baptized them / and who that would not he was slain or
put in prison / And after Charles went from one see to that other and then
he gate in galyee xiij cytees / emonge whom compestelle was then the les^e /
In espayne he had xvj great towns and strong / emonge whom was onsea in
which were wont to be x strong toures / and a town named petrosse in which
was made the fynest silver that had then course / Also another cite named
attentyua where as the body of sayut Torquete rested which was dyscyple of
saint James / and there upon the sepulture was an olyue tree florysshe and bear
ripe fruit a certain day of may every year without fayllyng / All the
contreye of spain that time was subgette to charles / That is to wete the
land of alandaluf / the land of perdoures / the land of castellans the land
of maures / The land of portyngale / the land of sarrasyns / the land of
navarre / the land of Alemans / The land of byscoys / the land of bascles /
the land of palargyens and sum of their cytees taken by war subtyl and
mortal / And sum without war / he could not win the great town of
Lucerne till at the last he laid syege tofore it by the space of four
months / and it stood in a grene valeye / And after when he saw that they
would not yield them / and that he could not win them / he made his prayer
unto god and to saint James that he might be vyctorious seen that he had no more
to termyne in that contreye but that cite only his oryson was herd / so that
the walls fyl down to the earth and was put to destructyon in such wise y^
never man dwelled therein after / and after it sanke and therein was an abysme or
swolowe of water / In which were founden after fysshes all black / Emonge
the other cytees that he took there were iiij that did him much pain or he
might get them / and therefore he gaf them the maladyctyon of god / and they
were cursed in such wise that unto this day there is in them none habytacion
and the said cytees been named lucerne / ventose / caperee / and adame

Of the great ydole that was in a cite / which could not be smyton down / and
of the condycyons and signs thereof ca iij
When charles had done in spain and other places with the Inhabytauntes of it
at his will / All thydolles and other symylacres that he fond he did do
destroy and put to confusyon / But in the land of Alandaluf in a cite called
Salancadys in arabyque / and was the place of a great god as the sarasyns said
/ That ydolle was made of the hand of Macho^mete in the time that he lived /
and was named Maho^met / in thonour of him / and by art magyke and dyabolyke
he closed therein a legyon of deuylles for to keep it and make signs for to
abuse the people / and this ydolle was kept so by deuylles that no person
living could by strength destroy it ne put it down / In such wise that if
any christian man came nyghe for to see it or to conjure it / or to destroy /
As Soon as he began to conjure and preche / anon he was perysshed and destroyed
/ And the sarasyns that came for to preche adoure make sacrefyse or do
obeyssaunce thereto were without peril / and if by adventure a bird fleyng came
and rested upon it / Incontinent it was deed / The stone upon which thydolle
was set was meruayllously made / It was a stone of the sea wrought of
sarasyns / and graven subtylly of great and rich facyon / the which was
enhau^ced vpryght / not without great craft and connyng / toward the earth it
was meruayllously great and always upward it was less / and that stone was so
hye as a crow might flee / upon which stone was thydolle set / which was
of fyn yuorye / after thassemblaunce of a man stondyng vpryght on his feet /
and had his face turned to the south / and held in his right hand a great
heye / and the srasyns were certefyed for truth / that when a king of france
should be borne and in strength to subdue the contreye of spain / and bring
it in to christian faith / the image should let fall the keye / which should be a
sign y^ the king of france should conquer them / So the^^^ in the time that
the noble king chacles reigned in spain for to bring it to the christian faith /
the ydolle let the ^ere fall down to the ground / And when the sarasyns saw
that / They (...) their tresours / as gold (...) and precious stoones in (...)
by cause the christian men (...) no thing find thereof / (...) al went in to
another (...) and durst not abide the coming of the king /

Of the church of saint James in galyce / and of diverse other which King
Charles founded capitulo iiij
CHarles being in galyce had Innumerable auantyte of gold of silver and of
precious stones of many kings princes and other lords / and of trybutes of
cytees that was given to him as lord

Also he had much of the tresour that he conquered of the towns and contreyes
of Spain aforesaid / Then he seeing the great habundaunce of good / did do
compose and make a church of Saint James in the place where as he had found
the body of him / and he abode there the space of three year without departing /
and in that same place he ordained a bishop and founded there chanonnes
reguler under the rule of saint Ysodore the confessor / and bought and
ordained for them rentes and trybutes suffycyent / and gaf to them synguler
seygnourye / The furnysshed the church with velles / bessellys of gold and
silver / adourneme^ts of precious clothes and al things necessary and
apperteynyng in a church pontyfycal / also of books vestymentes chalyces / and
other holy escryptures / And of the resydue of gold and silver that he brought
out of spain he did do edefye these chyrches following / First at Aoon in
almayne where as he is buried he did do make a church of our lady / and though
it be little / yet is it much rychely made / The church of Saint James in the
town of vyterbe / also the church of saint James in the cytre of Toulouse /
The church of Saint James in gascoyne / also the church of saint James in
paris between the said and the mou^te of martres / and above the chyrches
aforesaid he fonnded / rented and releued many and diverse chyrches /
monasteryes and other abbeyes in the world in many and diverse places /

How after that Aygolant the geaunt had taken spain / and put to death the
christian people / Charles recouerd it and other matters capitulo v
AFter that charles was returned in to France a king sarasyn of affryque named
aygolant with great puyssaunce came in to spain and remysed it in his
subgectyon / And the christian which charles had left there as many as he might
get he put to death / and the other fled / And in short time the tidings
came unto king Charles / whereof he was much abashed and angry because it was
showed to him so pyetously / wherefore Incontinent he assembled a great host /
and with a great multitude of fyghtyng men he went thither without taryeng / And
he made the conduytour of them al Myllon of angleres the fader of Rolland / and
they cessed not till that they had iydynges where Aygolant the geaunt was which
had done this feat / when charles knew where Aygolant was lodged and semblably
aygola^t knew where Charles was / Anon the geaunt sent to charles / that he
would deliver bataylle such as he would / That is to wete that Charles should
send to him xx of his men to fight against xx of his sarasyns / or xl against
xl or an C against C / or a thousand against a thousand / or two men against two /
or one man against one man only / king Charles seeing thentencyon of aygolant
for thonour of noblesse he would not refuse his demand / but sent to him an C
knights in great point / and the geaunte sent another hundred against the
christian men / but anon the sarasyns were vaynquysshed and put to death / and
after were sent by aygolant two hundred sarasyns against two hundred cyrsten
men which Sarasyns were anon without great resystence put to death and slain
/ Aygolant was not content ne would not leave herby but sent two thousand
sarasyns against ijM christian men and when they were in battle many of y^
sarasyns were slain and the other put to flight for to save them self / The
third day after Aygolant maad certain experyences and knew that if Charles
made war to him he should have great loss / and sent to charles to were if he
would make plain war / Charles was content / and there upon they made ready
their people / and specially charles / for his subgettes had great affectyon to
goo to bataylle without any (...) of death / And also sum of the christian men
the day tofore the bataylle did do amend and (...) their harnoys / and set
their tents nygh a river named (...) and pyght there their sp^^^s / even in
the place where as the bodies of saint faconde and saint premyt if rested /
where after was made a church deuotely founded / and also a strong cite by
the moyen of the said Charles / and in the place where the s^^res were pyght
our lord showed great miracle / For of them th^^ should deye there and be
gloryfyed marters of god and (...) in heaven / their spe^rs on y^ (...) were
fou^den al grene f^^resshed and leued / which was a percedent sign that they
which should deye should have the Joy in heaven / Each man took his own and
cut of the bows and leaves / with which the leaves were planted and under
ro^ed whereof in a little while after / grew a great wode which stondeth there
yet / It was great a marvel of the Joy that the horses made / which did
their deuoyrs as well as the men after their qualyte / which was a great token
/ Then and valiant christian men were slain / And emonge the other was slain
duc / Myllon fader to Roulland Also that same day the horse of charles was slain
under him / and when he was a foot he maad great murdre with his sword Ioyouse
/ and did so much that the sarasyns dredyng the euenyng fled and wythdrewe
them in to place of surete / And as it was the will of our lord the next day
after came to Charles in to his help iiij marquyse of ytalye accompanied with
iiijM strong fyghtyng men and chosen wherefore Aygolant as soon as he knew of
their coming he fled and wythdrewe him over the sea toward his contree / but
they myt not for have here with them al their tresours / wherefore france was
enryched meruayllously above all other contrees /

And when charles saw his departing / he came with al his richesse in to
france / and then during seven year he did do ordeyne the service and office
of the church by priests and clerks and the festes of saints of all the
year / and great virtue and meruayllous effect was comprysed in this man / For
when it was not war for to mynysshe thynf^dellys and encreace the christian
faith / For tenhaunce the name of god he made the offices and legendes of holy
saints / and did reduce in to mind and remembrance the passions of holy
marters in establysshyng their feestes to the end that we should ensyewe them and
to eschew al evil / And the magnytude of this king was well preued by signs
seen on the heaven / For in the same year the moon derked three times / and the
son ones and companyes of people were seen meruayllous which showed that
this Charles was of great magnytude that is to wete between heaven and earth /

How Aygolant sent to charles that he should come to him trustely for to make
Just war and how Charles in habyte dyssymyled spoke to him and of other
matters capitulo vj
AS I have said the kyn Aygolant the geaunte fled in to his contreye / when
socours came to Charles of four marquis / he slepte not upon his purpoos but
maad great dylygence for to assemble his people which were sarasyns
Innumerable / for he assembled mores / Moabytes / Ethiopiens / Affrycans / and
percyens / he brought with him also the king of arabye / the king of barbarye /
the king of malroste / the king of maioryke / the king of meques the king of
cybylle / and the king of Cordube / the which came with people without nombre
certain / in to gascoyne in to a strong cite named Agenne and took it / And
after sent to Charles that he should come to him peasybly and trustyly with a
few people / promysyng to him for to give to him ix horse laden with gold silver
and precious stones if he would thus come at his desire / this paynym showed to
him this by canse he would know his person / for his strength and puyssaunce
knew he well by experyence / and also to the end when he knew him / that he
might in the war slay him / when king charles knew this mandement he gadred
not great people but he came only with ijM knights of honor and of great
strength And when he was four mile nygh the cite / where Aygolant and all the
kings tofore named were / he left his people secretly / and came unto a
mountain nygh the cite accompanied with xl knights only / And fro this place
they saw the cite / by cause to wete if the multitude of people were departed
so that he should not be deceived / Nevertheless upon this montayne he left his
people secretly and took of his clothes / and cladde him in the guyse of a
messager / and took one knyt only with him which bare his spear and sword
and bocler under his mantel and so came in to the cite / and anon he was
brought tofore aygolant the geaunt / And when he was tofore him he said in this
manner / Charles the king has sent us unto the / and leteth the wete by us /
that he is comen like as thou have commanded / accompanied with forty knights
only for to do that he ought to do / Now then come to him with xl knights
without moo if thou wylt accomplysshe and hold that thou (...) promised /
Aygolant said to hem that they should return to charles / and that they should
say to him that he depart not / but abide him there / and he would come and
vysyte him / After this that charles had known the geaunt / and after vysyted
the town for to know the feblest part for to take and conquer it when he
should come ageyn / and saw all the kings foresaid / and their puyssaunces / ^e
after reterned to his people which he had left upon the montayne / and after
came to his ijM knights / and anon after aygolant accompanied with vijM
knytes came after them without taryeng / But charles took head when he came
that there were many moo paynyms than christian men / and without longer taryeng
charles and his people departed and returned in to france without having other
delyberacyon /

How Charles accompanied with much people returned in to the place aforsayd and
took the cite of agenne and other matters vij
AFter that charles was returned in to france he assembled much people / and
after came to the cite of age^ne and assyeged it there by great facyon the
space of vij months / Aygolant was therein and many sarasyns / and the christian
men had made fortressis and castelles of tree tofore this cite for to grieve it
/ when Aygolant and the great lords of his company saw yt they might not
endure / they maad hooles and caves under therth for tescape out secretly / in
that manner they came out of the cite and passed over a river which ra^ne by the
cite named goronna and so they saved them self / The next day after when there
was no great resystence made to the christian men / Charles with great tryumphe
and puyssaunce entered in to the cite and put to death xM sarasyns that he there
fond / The other seeing that / put them to flight by the river / Aygolant was
in another strong town / and when charles knew it he came thither and
assaylled it / and sent to him to deliver over the cite / aygolant ansuerd
that he would not so do but by a moyen / that was that they should make a
battle / and he that should win the bataylle should be lord of ye town and so
they assygned the day of the bataylle / and nygh to that place between the
castle thalabourt and a river called carantha so^me of the christian men planted
their speres in the ground / especially they that on the morn should d^ye and
obtain the crown of glory as marters of god / and on the morn they fond
their speres al grene and myraculously leued and full of bows / whereof the
christian men were much Joyous of this miracle / and raught not for to deye for
ye christian faith m mayn tenyng the name of god / After that they cut of their
speres and went to bataylle and put many sarasyns to death / But in the end were
slain and martred of christian men moo than iiijM which were saurd in heaven /
and that time the horse that Charles rode on was slain under him and at that
bataylle were slain by the said Charles / the king of Agabye / the king of
bugye merueyllous mighty sarasyns /

Of the virtuous operacions that charles made when he was returned in to
frannce / and what barons he had in his company and of their puyssaunce ca viij
THe bataylle toforesayd made / Aygolant fled and came in to panpylone / and
sent to king charles that he should abide him for to give him bataylle more
ample and large / when charles knew his desire he returned in to france for
to have help of his people / and made an open maundement thorugh out al France
that al manner people that were of evil condycyon and in bondage that they that
were present and their sucessours should be free and there upon tabellyons
should be delyuerd according to the law that would goo with him against the
myscreauntes / Also all pryso^ners that were in france he delyuerd them al
out of prison and to al them that should have been delyuerd to death for felo^nye
murdre or treason / he pardonned them and gaf to them their life / and to al
pour people that had not whereby to live / he gaf to them good largely / and
them that were evil clad he clothed them after their degree / all them that
were at debate he peased them and accorded / All them y^ were dysheryted and
put out from their lyuelode he restored al to them / All y^ people that might
bear arms he armed them / The valiant squyers of their persons / he made
knights / and al them that were in his Indygnacyon and pryued to his love and
bannysshed / for the love of god he was constraynede to pardonne them and made
p^^s with every man / and then he was fournysshed of moo than an C thousand
men well fighting / without them that were a foot which were Innumerable /
And for to give courage to the princes of Charles / Turpyn said in this manner /
I Turpyn archbysshop of Raynes by the (...) of god shall give good courage to
christian people / and shall (...) the Iufydele sarasyns with mine own hands /
with Charles was Roulland of Cenonye neuewe of Charles / sone of his sister
dame Berthe and of Duke Myllon with four thousand fyghtyng men / Olyuer duc of
genes sone of duc Reyner with iij M fyghtyng men / Aristagius king of brytayne
with vij thousand fyghtyng men / Not wythstondyng that in brytayne was another
king / Engelius which was duke of Guyan whom Augustus Cezar had ordained with
the byturyciens / the monyques / pictauyns / scauctonens / and Elogysmes /
cytres with their prouynces under guyan / and he came with iijM horsemen good
fyghtars / Garferus king of bordeloys with iiijM men / Salamon fellow of estok
/ bawd wyn brother of Rolland / Naymes duc of bauyere with xM fyghtyng men /
Hoel of Nauntrs / and Lambert prince of bourgoyn with ijM fyghtars / San son
duc of bourgoyn with xM Garyn duc of lorayne / and many other / and Charles had
of his own contre moo than fyfty M men / The excercyte of Charles the noble
emperor / and right puyssaunt King of France was so great and so ample that
it held two Iourneyes long / and in bread half o Iourneye and more In such
wise that of the bruyt that was made for the great multitude of the frensshemen
it was herd two mile far and more /

Of the tryews of Charles and of Aygolant and of the death of his people / and
wherefore aygolant was not baptized capitulo ix
THe while that charles was a young child he learned at Toulete the langage of
sarasyns and spoke it when he would / Aygolant this geaunt and great Lord could
not absteyne him and camnygh unto crystyente / and sent to Charles to come to
him unto Pampylone / and tryews was maad between them / For Aygolant consyderyd
the multitude of his people / and the puyssaunces of their persons / For by
course of nature him seemed he should surmounte the christian people / but he thought
that the god of christian people was more certain and true than the god of the
paynyms / but er he would declyne fro the worshyppyng of his gods / he had
desire to assaye yet ones the nombre of paynyms against the nombre of christian
men / And he was content to make a pacte and covenant with charles that he
that should obtain the vyctorye upon others people / that his god were h^lden
and worshypped / And that the god of him that should lose the bataylle should be
of no valor / renyed and reputed for naught / And upon this couenaunte were
sent twenty christian knights against xx knights paynyms / And anon as they
were assembled and meddled to gyder / the twenty sarasyns were slain / And after
were sent forty against forty And anon the sarasyns were slain and
vaynaquysshed / And after he sent an C against an C but they were not slain but
fled / Aygola^t thout he would do better and sent ij hundred against ij C / and
anon the sarasyns were ouercomen and slain / This geaunt was evil content of
the destructyon of his people / and for to make a great descomfyte he sent a
thousand sarasyns against a M christian men and without making great rebellyon
the sarasyns were anon slain and put to death / Then the king Aygolant by
experyence fore made afermed the faith and the law of christian people to be
better / more sure / and more certain than the law of the paynyms and sarasyns
/ and thus he was enclyned to the christian faith / and dysposed him to receive
baptym on the moene without fayn tyse / and here upon he demanded tryews and
surete for to goo and come to Charles / and he granted it to him with good
heart / and thus at hour of tyerce when charles was at dinner / Aygolant had
entencyon to see charles and his manner at mete / for to know his astate if it
were vayllerous and so great as it was in arms and in bataylles And also he
came pryncypally for to be baptized / and he saw Charles at his table with
great magnyfycence / and after beheld the order of his people / and saw that
sum were in habyte of knights and great princes / Other in habyte of
channons and monks and asked so that he was certefyed of every order and the
canse of their estate / and after that he saw in a part of y^ halle syttyng
on the ground xiij pour persons which dyned and ete as other did / for
charles of custom would not take his repaste till he had xiij pour men in the
worship of our lord and of his xij appostles / and he took head how these pour
men satte on the ground without to wayl in right pour habyte / and dyned al
soroufully / and he demanded what people they were / Charles ansuerd and said
they be gods people and messagers of our lord Ihesu christ / whom I sustain
in thonour of him and his xii appostles that he had with him and give to them
refectyon corporel / Aygola^t said certeynlye he serves evil his lord y^
receives his messagers in this manner / I see well that they that been about
the been in good point and well arrayed and well served of mete and drink / and
the servants of thy god live rourely and evil clothed against y^ cold / and
ben withrawen far fro thy / he does great shame to his lord that receives
his messagers in this manner / and more over I see now well that the law which
thou have said to me to be good and holy / by thy works thou show them to
be falls and of no valewe / and hereof aygolant was all moeued and troubled in
his entendement / and he being put out all fro his purpose / took leave of the
king and returned to his people and renounced to be baptized / and sent word
to charles for to begin war ageyn on y^ morn more strong than ever he had
done tofore /

Of the death of aygolant and of his people / and how much christian people were
slain by concupyscence of silver / and of christian men founden deed by miracle x
When charles saw Aygolant come for to baptyse him he was much Joyous but
when he returned and forsook it be was evil content and took aduys upon the
pour men which he said were messagers of god / For after the pouerte of them /
and after that they were named fore / to hold them so was none honor to their
master / and the emperor remembered well that the people of god ought to be
received honestly / and honorably holden and scrued / wherefore the pour men
that he fond in thexcercyte he did them to be well clothed and honestly and gaf
to them mete largely / And took such custom in him self that he faylled not /
but the pour people were received with honor in his company / upon this
purpose on a day following the sarasyns put them to bataylle and to fight against
the christian men by great fyerste / and there was so great destructyon that day
of the sarasyns / that the christian men were empesshed and let by the blood
that ran so habundantly as it had rayned many days water and blood /
wherefore Aygolant seeing the destractyon of his people / as he that doubted
nothing to deye / and advanced so him self that he was slain and put to death /
and after the christian men entered in to the cite of pampylone / and put to death
all the sarasyns that they fond therein /

Then the king of Cybylle and the king of cordube saved them self with sum
of their subgettes / After this the christian men full of couetyse for to have
gold and silver of the sarasyns that were deed returned / And when they were
well charged and laden with gold / silver / and other hauoyr / the king of
Cybylle and the king of Cordube took head thereof / And with al their meyne came
couuertly upon the christian men and put to death moo than a thousand /

Thus may be known that the ardeur of concupyscence was cause of the death of
the soul / without vyctorye / and to god dysplaysaunte / On the morn
tidings came how so many sarasyns were slain / and specially of aygola^t unto
the prince of Navarre named Furre / wherefore he sent to Charles to have battle
ordynayre / Charles was so noble so puyssaunt and so trustyng in god when he
faught for the christian faith / that he refused him not / and after at the day
of bataylle which was assygned on both parties / Charles put him self to
prayer and prayed god deuoutely that it plesed him / to show what christian men
should deye in that bataylle / and on the day following when every man was armed
for to fight / by the will of our lord / Charles saw that same day the sign
of the cross all read upon the sholdres behind upon their harnoys / when
charles saw it he thanked our lord and had compassyon of their death by cause
of the valyau^ce of their persons / Then he sent for all them that bare
thensigne / and made them to goo in to his oratorye / and after shette them
fast therein to the end that they should not take death that day / and then
with al his other host he went against thoost of the prince furre but it was
not long but furre and his people were destroyed and put to death / and when
that was done / the emperor came in to his oratorye vyctoryous upon his
enemies / and fond al them that were shette within deed and expyred / and
then knew he well that all they that were marked with the cross were
assygned that day to be received in to heaven with glory and crown of
marterdom / and that it apperteyned not to Charles to prolonge their health /
wherefore he is well simple that will put him in pain to eschew the passage of
which he is not maystre /

Of feragus the merueyllous geaunt how he bare away with him the barons of
france without danger / and how ^olland faught with him capitulo xj
AFter that aygosa^t was slain / and Furre and many kings sarasyns as tofore
is wryton / the tidings came to the admyral of babylo^ne / the which had a
geant much terryble that was of the generac^on of golias and he made him to be
acco^panyed with xxM turks much strong and sent him for to fight against
charles the emperor / For his puyssaunce was redoubted through the world / and
the said feragus came unto the cite of vagyere nygh to saint James between
cristendom and bethenes / and sent to Charles that he should come to fight
against him / This geant was much meruayllous For he doubted neither spear ne
sword / ne arowe ne other shot^e And he had the strength of ^l mighty men and
strong / Anon as Charles knew the hidynges of his coming he ^^^nt to him and
was upon his (...) nygh by vagyere / when th^s was known this geaunte issued
out of the town / and demanded synguler person against a person / Charles
which never had refused that to person sent to him Ogyer the danoys / but
when the geant saw him allone on the field without ^^^yng of any semblaunte of
war / he came allone to him and took him with one hand and put him under his
arm without doing to him any harm / and bare him unto his lodgys / and did
do put him in prison / and made no more a do to bear him / than does a wulf to
bear a little lamb / The heyght of this geaunt was of twelve cubytes he had the
face a cubyte broad / the nose a palm long / the arms and theys four
cubytes long The back of his hand was three palms long / After that ogyer was
borne thus away / charles sent raynold daultepyn / when Feragus saw him he
bare him away as lightly as the other / Charles was abashed and sent tweyne
other / that is to wete constayn of Rome and therle hoel This geau^t took that
one with the right hand and that other in the lift hand / and bare them both
tweyne in to prison in to his lodgyng / that every man might see / yet after
charles sent other tweyne / and semblably they were both borne away without
any wythstandyng or contradyctyon / when Charles saw the feet of this man / he
was al abashed and durst no more send any person / For no man might resyste
him / Roulland which was prince of al thexcersyte of Charles was cuyl content
of this that the geaunt was vyctoryous / and came to Charles and presented him
self for to goo fight with him / but charles would not grant him / At the last
by force he was constrained to give to him license / and Roulland made him ready
and came tofore Feragus / but anon he was taken and retained with his right
hand like the other and the geant laid him tofore him on his horse / when
Rolland saw that he was taken and borne away so vylaynsly he took a gtete
courage in him self / and called the name of Ihesus to help and to be in his
aid / and turned him against Feragus and took him by the chynne / and made to
overthrow fro his horse and fyl to the ground and rolland also And after anon
they arose and eueryche took his own horse / Roulland which was much habyle
and courageous drew his sword durandal and came against the geaunt and gaf so
great a stooke on the Paynyms horse / that he carf him a sondre in the mids /
and the paynym fyl to the earth / Feragus being evil content for his horse that
was deed took his sword for to smite Rolland and had slain him with the
stroke if he had attained him / but as soon as he lift up his arm for to have
smyten Rolland / ^oulland auaunced him self and smote the geant upon the arm
with which he held his sword such a stroke / that his sword fyl to the
ground / whereof Feragus had great despyte / and supposed to hanc smyten him
with his fyste / but he attained rollandes horse in such wise that he slew him
/ Thus were they both two on foot which without swerd begynnen to fight with
their fystes and with stones contynuelly till the hour of none / wherefore they
both were weary and took tryews to gyder by one accord unto the morn / and
that they should fight without spear and without horse / and here upon each of
them went unto his lodgys /

How on the morn rolland and Feragus foughten and dysputeden the faith / and
by what moyen Feragus was slain by Roulland capitulo xij
THe next day folo wyng erly Rolland and Feragus came to the field of the
bataylle / The geaunt brought his sword much great but it was no thing worth
/ for rolland made prouysyon of a great staff or clubbe ryt long / with
which he smote the geaunt / but he might nowher hurt him / and also he smote
him with great stones and round and could in no wise hurt ne enter in to his
flesh / And in this manner ^^^^cessyd not to fight till the hour of mydday /
The geaunt was weary and demanded iryews of Rolland for to sleep and rest hy a
little / Rolland was dentente / and was so noble and so valiant / that when the
geaunt was laid / he went and fet^^ a great stone / and laid it under his
heed to the end that he might the better sleep and rest at his ease / And
after that he had a little slepte and that he was awaked / be satte up / And the
noble Rolland came and sat by him / and said to him / I meruaylle much of thy
feat / How thou art so strong and so terryble / that thou may not be hurt ne
wounded in thy body by swerd ne by staff ne by stones ne in no wise / The
geaunt which spoke spaynyssh said to him / I may not be slain but by the navel
/ when Rolland herd that he made semblaunte that he understood him not / After
Feragus demanded him what was his name / and of what lygnage he was / Rolland
said to him I am named Rolland and am neuew of charles the right mighty
Emperor / and Feragus asked of him what law he held Rolland ansuerd I hold
the christian faith by the grace of god Feragus said what faith is that and who
has given it / to which Roulland ansuerd / It is truth yt after god almyty
had made heaven and earth / and our first fader adam which was dysobeyssaunt to
his commandments / the world was Iuged here in earth without having of
beatytude / ne of felycyte / and long time after the sone of god the second
person of the Trynyte remembered him of the valor of the soul / the which is
given to every person and descended fro heaven and took our humanyte / and
suffered grievous passion of pains / And he being in this world has given
enseygnements and stablysshed constry tucyons for to save us / and pryncypally
who byleueth in him and in his works parfyghtly and that he be baptized /
After this mortel life he shall be saved in heaven / and too this is the faith
that I hold / in the which I wyldeye / And after that Feragus had made to him
many questyons in the faith / and that Rolland had ansuerd to him honorably in
every point / Feragus said in this manner / thou art christian and wylt mayntene
the faith of which thou have spoken / and I am a paynym / and hold for my god
Mahoun / who of us tweyne that shall be vayn quysshed and overcome / late his
law be hold for naught and of no valewe / and the faith of him that is
vyctoryous late it be holden for good and true / and that it be entyerly kept
and observed / The valiant Rolland was content right well and accepted his
langage / then each of them was ready to fight / Anon Rolland came to him /
and Feragus lift up his arm for to smite Rolland much malycyously / and
Ronlland saw the stroke come upon him / and for to void it he lann^^d his
staff against the sword / and with the stroke the staff was cut asondre /
and there wythal the geaunt ran to Rolland and had him down under him /
Rolland consyderyng that he might not flee ne escape / he called in his heart
deuoutefy the name of Ihesus / and yielded him to god and to the vyrgyn marye /
and he anon reprysed such strength and myt that he aroos a little / and
myghtyly repugned the geaunte in such manner / that he brought the geaunte
under him / and then much quyckly and subtylly he set hand on his sword
/ and prycked him in the nauyl therwyth and anon after aroos / and fled all that he myt to thoost of charles / Anon as feragus felt him self hurt in that
place he cried so hye and loud / that all they that were in that place were
aferd and abusshed of his cry / and he said O Maho^met my god to whom I have
given my faith come and socour me for thou see well that I dye / and tary^ no
longer / with that hydous voys the sarasyns camen to him and bare him away in
their arms the best wise they could unto his lodgys / and by that time rolland
was comen all hool and sauf unto Charles / And forthwYth the christian men went
Impetuously upon the Sarasyns that bare Feragus and entered in to the cite and
so much did that the geaunt was deed / and after came in to the prison
valyauntly and took out Ogyer / Reguault / Constantyn / Hoel and the other
prysonners /

How Charles went to Cordube where the king of the same place and the king of
Cybylle abode for their destructyon ca xiij
AFter this aforesaid the king Corbude / and the king of Cybylle sent to
Charles that he should come to cordube for to fight / Anon as charles knew it
he came thither with al his puyssaunte / And when they were nygh for tassemble
in bataylle / the sarasyns maad a much subtyl and wild thyn^e For tofore the
Sarasyns that were on horsback they had ^^^^ned men on foot which had ^^sieres
counterfeyted all black and read / horned and berded like deuylles / for to
deceive the christian men / and eueryche of these (...) men bare in his hand a
little belle / And at thentre of the bataylle they began to sown and make such
a bauyt that as soon as the horses of the christian men saw them so countrefayred
and sown their bellys so Im^^^uously / they began to flee / discenge and to be
aferde in such manner that no man might hold their horses but by force they
must flee and wythdrawe them / Charles devised a remedy / and on the morn he
blynfelde the horses and couerd their eyes with clothes And stopped their eres
to the end that they should not see ne here the sarasyns dysguysed and
countrefayted / And when they came to bataylle in this manner they spared not
but slew down right and put the sarasyns to death till mydday / but yet they
were not al vaynquysshed / For they had a carte mighty and great for to resyte
and make great empesshement to their enemies And this engyne was drawn with
viij oxen in the war / and three upon stood an hye the standard of their
ensygne / and their custom was that on pain of death no person should return
ne goo aback for no thing as long as the standard stood vpryght / hereof
Charles was informed wherefore much puyssauntly he rode through the sarasyns till
he came to the standard / and with Ioyouse his sword he smote it a sondre /
and anon as the sarasyns saw that they fled and many of y^ paynyms were
slain and deed / and on the morn after the town was delyuerd unto Charles by
the lord of the tonn / which could not resyste him / and charles was content
to let him have his life / if he would be baptized / and also the town for to
hold it of him and none otherwise / And then charles ordained in spain
certain of his barons to keep it in such wise / that none durst assaylle it /
ne make to it war / For he was always vyctoryous of his enemies / by the
puyssaunce that he led / and also by dyscrescyon of his person / and
pryncypally by the grace of god which faylled not in him and in his subgettes
/

How the church of Saint James was hallowed by tharchebysshop Turpyn / and the
chyrches of spain subgettes thereto and of other pryncypal chyrches capitulo
xiiij
CHarles the noble emperor / after that he had put and set good estate and
good ward in spain / he went to saint James with few people / And when he
was there / such christian men as he there fond he rewarded them and did to them
much good / and he punysshed such as were apostates and other manner of people
/ such as he fond vntryewe and dysobeysaunte to holy church he let slay and
put to death / or he sent them in to france to do penance / and bannysshed
them / And then thorugh all the cytees of spain he ordained bishops
relygyous / and other people of the church / and made many constytucyous
synodals and other ordynaunces upon the church / and upon other people / And in
thonour of saint James he made constytucyons and Instytuted that all the
bishops / princes / and kings dwelling in spain / should all be subget to the
bishop of saint James and al they should owe to that church fydelyte with all the people of the land of galyce / And according to the same the archebisshop
Turpyn writes in this manner / And I Turpyn archebysshop of Raynes was in the
same place / where the ordenaunces aforesaid were maad / And I accompanied with
ix honorable bishops and of good life / at the request and postulacyon of
Charles in the month of Iuyl have hallowed / dedycated blessed and consecrated
the church of saint James / and the altar of the same / And after then the
king Charles gaf all the land of spain and of galyce to that church / And
after ordained y^ every house of spayn and galyce should give to the church of
saint James iiij pens of the money corraunt for amuel trybute / And by the
moyen thereof they should be frank and free of seruytude / And for the honor of
saint James he establysshed that the church of the said place should be said
apostolyque for thexaltacion of the place / And more over that the
bysshopryches and specyal dygnyte of all spain and of galyce and semblably
the coronacions of kings of all the contre should be crowned and sacred by the
bishop of saint James / al in like wise as it has been tofore done in Asye in
the place of ephesym for the honor of holy Saint Johan theuangelyst brother of
saint James and sone of Zebedee / and thus Saint Johan was lodged in the right
side / And Saint James his brother in the lift side / Then was accomplisshed
the peticyon of their mother and of her two sons gloryouse friends of our lord
Ihesu Christ / when she desired that her two sons should sytte / one on the
right side / and that other on the lift / which was then accomplysshed and
termyned / and therefore in the world ben three syeges and chyrches pryncypal
which christian men by right owen t^ya^^e / deffende and mayntene / with all
their might / That is to were the church of Rome / The church of Ephesym of
saint Johan the euangelyst / And the church of Saint James in galyce / And if
any demanded the cause of these three places and syeges pryncipal of cristyente
/ the cause is enough apparente / These three places ben honored pryncypally by
cause the sinners may have their recours to them for tamende their lives / and
put away their sins / and obtain pardon and forgyuenes / First these iij
appostles / that is to say Saint Peter / Saint Johan / and saint James have
preceded all the other in the company of Ihesu Christ / when he was in this
world / and have been called to his secrets / and that have most continued
with him / Thus by good right the places in which they have conuersed and
continued their lives / and where their bodies resten / oughten to be honored
and to be habundaunt in grace / Pryncypally saint Peter was the first and most
hye and preched at Rome / and there was martred and buried / Therefore the
church of Rome is enhaunced and exalted above al other chyrches / and after
saint Johan which saw the secrets of god in his souper / and in ephesym he
made the gospel In principio erat verbum etc^ / And by his holy prechyng has
converted thynfydellys to the holy christian faith / And also saint James which
had great pain in spain and in galyce for the honor of god / as well for his
holy life / for his miracles / as for his marterdom and his sepulture / by good
right ought the memory of them to be thorugh the universal world /

The second part of the third book / conteyneth x chapytres / and speaks of
the treason made by ganellon and of the death of the pyeres of France /
How the treason was comprysed by Ganellon / and of the death of christian men /
and how ganellon is repreuyd by thauctour capitulo primo
IN this time were in Cezarye two kings sarasyns much mighty / that one was
named marfurrius / and that other bellegandus his brother / which were sent
by thadmyral of babylonne in to spain the which were under King Charles and
made to him sign of love and of subgectyon / and went by his commandment
holyly and under the shadow of decepcyon / The Emperor seeing that they were not
christian / and for to get seygnourye over them he sent for ganellon / in whom
he had fyaunce / that they should do baptyse them / or else that they should
send to him trybute in sign of fydelyte of their contre / Ganellon the
traytre went thither and did to them the message / and after that he had with
them many deceyuable words / they sent him ageyn to charles with xxx horse
laden with gold and silver / with clothes of sylke and other rychesses / and
iiij hundred horse laden with sweet wyn for to give to the men of war for to
drink / and also they sent above this to them a thousand fair wymmen sarasyns
in great point and young of age / And al this in sign of love and of
obeyssaunce / and after they gaf to Ganellon xx horse charged with gold and
silver / sylkes and other precyosytes / that by his moyen he should bring in to
their hondes the company of charles if he might do it /

Then ganellon was surprysed with this false auaryce / which consumes all
the swetenes of charity / that is in persons for to have gold or silver and
other rychesses / and made a pacte and couenaunte with the sarasyns for to
bytraye his lord / his neighbors and christian brethern / and swear that he would
not faylle them of thenterpryse / but I merueylle much of ganellon which made
this treason / without to hane cause / colored ne Just / O wicked Ganellon
thou were comen of noblesse / and thou have done a work vylaynnous thou were
rich and a great lord / and for money thou have betrayed thy master / Emonge
all other thou were chosen for to goo to y^ sarasyns for great trust emonge all the other / and for the fydelyte that was thought in the / thou have consented
to trayson / and allone have commysed Infydelyte / Fro whens comes thyn
Inyquyte / but of a falls will plunged in thabysme of auaryce / Thy naturel
souerayn lord / Roulland / Olyuer / and the other / what have they done to the
/ if thou have a wicked hate against one person / wherefore consentest thou to
destroy thynnocentes / was there no person that thou love dest / when to al
christian men thou have ben trayter / was there any reason in the / when thou
have ben capytayn against the faith / what avails the prowess that thou have
made in time passed / when thyn end shows that thou have do wyckednes / O
falls auaryce and ardeur of concupiscence / he is not the first that by the is
come^^ to myschyef / by the Adam was to god dysobeysaunt / and the noble cite
of Troy the grau^de put to vttre ruin and destructyon / Thus in this manner
ganellon brought gold and silver / wyn wymmen / and other rychesses as tofore
he had enterprysed / when charles saw all this he thought that al way done in
good intent and equity / and without barat / The great lords and knights took
the wyn for them / and charles took only the gold and silver / and the moyen
people took the hethen wymmen / The Emperor gaf consent to the w^^des of
ganellon / For he spoke much wisely and wrought in such wise that charles and
all his host passed the port of Cezarye / for ganellon did him to
understood that the kings aforesaid would become christian and be baptized and
swear fydelyte to the emperor / And anon sent his people tofore / and he came
after in the ryere ward / and had sent Roulland and Olyuer and the most
specyal of his subgettes with a thousand fyghtyng men / and were in Founcyuale
/ Then the kings Marfuryus and Bellegandus after the cou^ceyl of ganellon
with fyfty thousand sarasyns were hid in a wode abydyng and awaytyng the
frenssh men / and there they abode ij days and two nyghtys / and divided their
men in two parties / In the first they put xx M sarasyn^ and in that other they
put xxx thousand sarasyns / In the haunte guard of charles were xx thousand
christian men / which anon were assaylled with xx thousand sarasyns / and maad
war in suche^ wise that they were constreyned to withdraw them / For fro the
morning unto the hour of tyerce they seaced not to fight and smite on them
wherefore the christian men were much weary / and had need to rest them /
Nevertheless they dronken well of the good sweet wyn of the sarasyns much
largely / And after many of them that were drunk / went and lay by the ^oymem
sarasynoys / and also with other that they had brought out of france /
wherefore the will of god was / that they should al be deed / to the end that
their martyrdom and passion might be the cause of their sauacyon and purging of
their sin For anon after the thyrty thou sand sarasyns cant that were in the
second batayl upon the frenssh men so Impetuovsly that they were al deed and
slain / Gxcept Roulland baulduyn and Thyerry The other were slain and deed with
sp^^^s / sum flayn / so^me roasted and other quartred / and submysed to many
torments / And when this dyscomfyture was done / Ganellon was with charles and
also tharchebysshop Turpyn / which knew nothing of this work so sorouful sauf
only the traytre / which supposed that they all had be destroyed and put to
death / Of the languysshe that was coming to Charles / he wyste not / how sone
it was coming /

Of the death of king Marfurius and how Roulland was hurt with four speres
mortally after that al his people were slain capitulo ij
THe bataylle as I have said tofore was much sharp / when Rolland which was
much weary returned he recountred in his way a sarasyn much fyers and black
as boylled pytche / and anon he took him at thentre of a wode and bond him to
a tree straytely / without doing to him any more harm / and after took and
rode upon an hylle for to see the host of the sarasyns / And the christian men
that were fled / and saw great quantyte of paynyms wherefore anon he sowned
and blewe his horn of yuorye much loud / And with that noise came to him an
hundred christian men well arrayed and babylled without moo / And when they were
come to him he returned to the sarasyn that was bound to the tree / And
Roulland held his swerd over him saying that he should deye / if he showed to
him not clearly the king Marfuryus / and if he so would do / he should not deye /
The sarasyn was content and swear / that he should gladly do it for to save his
life / and so he brought him with him unto the place where they saw the
paynyms / and showed to Rolland which was the king which rode upon a read
horse / and other certain tokenes / And in this point Roulland reconfermed in
his strength / trustyng verily in the might of god and in the name of Ihesus /
as a lion entered in to the bataylle / and emonge them he encountered a sarasyn
which was gretter than any of the other / and gaf to him so great a stroke
with durandal upon the head that he clefte him and his horse in two parts /
that the one part went on one side and that other on the other side / wherefore
the sarasyns were so troubled and abashed of the might and puyssaunce of
Rolland that they all fled tofore him / and then abode the king Marfuryus
with a few fo^ke Then rolland saw this king And without fere came to him
and put him to death Incontyne^t And all the hundred christian men that were with
Roulland in this recountre were d^^erous^ly slain and put to death / (...) only
baulduyn and Thyerry / which for fere fled in to the wode / But after that
Rolland had slain king Marfuryus / he was sore oppressyd / and in such wise
deteyned / that with four great spe^es he was smyton and wounded mortally /
and beten with st^ones and hurt with darts and other shot mortally / And
not withstondyng these grievous hurt and wounds yet maulgre all the sarasyns /
he sp^^nge out of the bataylle / and saved him self the best wise he might /

Bellegandus brother of Marfuryus doubtyng that help and aid should come to the
christian people returned in to another coutreye / with his people much hastily /
And the emperor Charles had then passed the montayne of Roncyuale and knew
nothing of these things before said ne what had be done

How Rolland deyed holyly after many martyrs and orysons made to god full
deuoutely / and of the complaynte maad for his sword durandal capitulo iij
ROlland the valiant / and champyon of the christian faith was much sorouful of
the christian men by cause they had no so^ours / he was much weary / gretely
abashed / and much affebled in his person / for he had lost much of his
blood by his four mortal wounds / of which the least of them was suffysaunt
for him to have deyed and he had great pain to get him out fro the sarasyns
for to have a little commemoracion of god tofore or the soul should depart fro
his body / so much he enforced him that he came to the foot of a montayne nygh
to the port of Cezarye / and brought him self nygh to a roche right by
Roncyuale under a tree in a fair medowe / when he sat down on the ground he
byhelde his sword / the best that ever was named durandal which is as much
to say as gyuyng an hard stroke / which was right fair and rychely made / the
handle was of fyn beryle shynyng meruayllously / on hye it had a fair cross
of gold / in the which was wryton the name of Ihesus / It was so good and fyn
that sonner should the arm faylle than the sword / he took it out of y^ shethe
and saw it shine much bright / and by cause it should change his master he
had much sorrow in his heart / and weeping he said in this manner pytously / O
swerd of valor the fairest that ever was / thou were never but fair / Ne never
fond I the but good / thou art long by mesure Thou have be so much honored
that always thou barest with the the name of the blessed Ihesus savior of the
world / which has endowed the with the power of god / who may comprehend thy
valor / Alas who shall have the after me / who someuer has the shall never be
vaynquysshed / always he shall have good fortune / Alas what shall I more over
say for the good sword / many sarasyns have been destroyed by the / thynfydels
and myscreauntes have been slain by the the name of god is exalted by the / by
the is made the path of sauement / O how many times have I by the avenged
thyni^rye made to god / O how many inen have I smyton and cut a sondre by the
myddle / O my sword which have ben my comfort and my Joy which never hurtest
person that might escape fro death / O my sword if any person of no value
should have the / and I knew it I should deye for sorrow / After that Rolland
had wept enough / he had fere that sum paynym might find it after his death
/ wherefore he cencluded in him self to break it / and took it and smote it upon
a roche with all his might iij times without hurtyng any thing the sword /
and clefte the rock to therthe / and could in no wise break the sword / when
he saw the facyon and could do no more thereto / he took his horn which was of
yuorye much rychely made / and sowned and blewe it much strongely / to the
end that if there were any christian men hid in the wodes or in the way of
their retournyng / that they should come to him to fore they went any ferther /
and to fore he rendered his soul / Then seeing that none came he sowned it
ageyn by so great force and virtue and so Impetuonsly / that the horn roof a
sondre in the myddle / and the veins of his neck braken a sondre / and the
synewes of his body stratcheden And that noise or voys by the grace of god came
to the eeres of Charles which was eight mile fro him / The Emperor herryng
the horn / he knew well that Rolland had blown it / and would have returned
ageyn but Ganellon the traytre which knew well all the fayt dystourned him in
saying / that Rolland had blown his hor^e for sum wild be that he chaced
for his playsyr / For often times he would blow his horn for little thing / and
that he should not doubt of nothing And thus he did the king to understand /
that he byleued him / and made none other s^^ blaunte / Nevertheless Rolland
being in this sorrow ^e peased his wounds also well as he might / and stratched
him self on the grass to the fresshenes for to forgete his thurst which was
over great /

Here upon Baulduyn his brother came unto him / which was much heavy and
sorouful for his brother Roulland which was in that necessyte / And anon
Roulland said to him my friend and my brother I have so great thurst that I
must needs deye if I have not drink to aswage my thurst /

Baulduyn had great pain in going here and there / and could find no water /
and came to him ageyn and said he could find none / and in great anguysshe he
left on Roullandes horse / and rode for to fetch charles / For he knew well
that rolland was nyghe his death / Anon after came to him Thyerry du^ of
Ardayne which wept upon Rolland so contynuelly / that he myt not speak but
with great pain / Rolland confessyd him and dysposed him of his con^eyence /
nevertheless that same day Rolland had received the body of our lord / For the
custom was that the subgettes of Charles that day which they should fight /
were confessyd and comuned without fayllyng by men of the church which always
were with them Rolland which knew his end by entyer contemplacyon / his eyes
lift up to heaven and his hondes Joined al stratched in the medowe began to say
thus / Fair lord god my maker / my redemour sone of the glorious mother of
comfort thou kowest mine entencyn / thou know what I have done for the
bounte that is in the / by thy great mercy of which thou art enuyronned by the
grace which in the haboundeth / by the merit of thy passion holy and bitter /
with a good and humble heart I require the y^ tofore the this day / my faults /
sins / and ygnoraunces may be pardonned to me / and take no regard to the
trespaces that I have done to the / but behold that I deye for the / and in
the faith that thou have ordained remember that thou hengest on the tree of the
cross for the synnars / and so as thou have redeemed me I beseech the that I be
not lost / Alas my maker god omnypotent with good will I departed out of my
contreye for to defend thy name / and for to mayntene crystendom / Thou
know that I have suffered many anguysshes / of hungre / of thurst / of hete /
of cold / and many mortal wounds / And day and night to the my god I yield me
culpable / I mystrust not thy mercy / thou art pyetous / thon art comen for the
synnars / thou pardonest marye magdelene and the good thief on the cross by
cause they reto^ned unto the / they were synnars as I am / like as they did I
cry the mercy / and better if I could say it / thou byheldest how Abraham was
obeyssaunt to the of his sone ysaac / wherefore he ferde much the better /
byholde me how I am obedyent to the commandments of the church I believe in
the / I love the above all other / I love my neighbor / O good lord I beseech
the to pardonne and forgive all them that this day ben deed in my company /
and that they may be saved / Also my maker I require the to take heed of the
pacyence of Job for which he was much the better / that I deye here for thurst
/ and am allone / I am wounded mortally and may not help my self / and take in
pacyence all the sorrow that I suffer / and am therwyth content when it
pleases the / as al this is true / pardone me / comfort / my spyryte /
receive my soul and bring me to rest perdurable / when Rolland had prayed
thus / he set his hands on his body holdyng his flesh and after said three
times / Et in ^^rne mea videbo deum saluatorem meum / and after laid his
hands on his eyes and said / Et oculi isti conspecturi sunt / In this flesh
that I hold I shall see my savior / and these eyes shall behold him / and
after he said that he saw things celestyal / which the eyes of man kind
might not see / ne the e^res here / ne the heart think / the glory which god
has maad ready to them that love him / and in saying / In manus tuas domine
commendo spiritum meum he said his arms upon his body in manner of a cross /
and gaf and rendered his soul to god the xvj kalendes of Iuyl /

Of the vysyon of the death of Roulland / and of the sorrow of Charles and how
he complained him pyetously and other matters capitulo iiij
THe day that Roulland the marter renderd his soul unto god / I T^^pyn
archebysshop of Raynes was in the valeye of Rouncyuale / tofore charles the
Emperor / and said mass for the souls which were passed out of this world
/ And as I was in the secret of the mass^^ I was rauysshed and herd the
aungellys of heaven sing and make great melodye / And I wise not what it might
be / ne wherefore they so did / And as I saw the aungellys mount in to heaven
on hye / I saw coming a great legyon of knights all black against me / the
which bear a pray whereof they maad great noise and desraye / when they were
tofore me in passing I said to them and dem^^ded who they were and what they
bare One of the deuylles ansuerd and said / we bear the king Marfuryus in to
hell / for long a goon he has well deserved it / And Roulland your trompette
with Mychel thaungel and many other in his company is (...) in to Joy
perdurable to heaven / And as the mass was fynysshed I recounted to charles the
vysyon which I had seen / how thangellys of heaven bare the soul of Ro^lland
in to paradys / and the deuylles bare the soul of a sarasyn in to hell / Thus
as I said these words baulduyn which rode on Rollandes horse came hastily and
said to charles how the christian men were deed and bytrayed and how Rolland was
hurt and in what estate he had left him / As Soon as he had told this / the
cry was made through thoost that every man should return back / and there was
a great b^^yt / But the emperor Charles to whom this matter tonched at the ^ert
more than to any other / auaunced him for to goo thither and when he came he
fond Rolland exspyred his hondes in cross upon his vysage al stratched / And
anon Charles fyl down upon him / and began to weep much tenderly smytyng him
on his vysage / rendyng his clothes and tormented his body / and might not
speak a great while / when he was returned to him self by ardeur of dylectyon
and excercyte of sorrow he said in this wise / O comfort of my body / honor
of frenssh men / suerd of Justice / spear that might not bow / hawberck that
might not be broken / helm of health / resemblyng to I^das machabeus in
prowess / samblant to sampson in strength / and to Absalon in beaulte / O
right dear neuew fair and wise / in batayl ryal / O destroyer of the sarasyns /
defendour of christian men / wall of clergy / staff to wydowes and of pour
orphelyns / Releuer of chyrches / tongue of truth / Mouth without lesyng /
true in all Judgment / prince of bataylle / conduytour of the friends of god /
Augmentour of the christian faith / and byloued of every person / Alas why have
I brought the in to a strange contreye / wherefore am I not deed thith the / O
Roulland wherefore leuest thou me heavy and so rouful / helas caytyf that I am
what shall I do / Alas sorouful whyther shall I goo / I pray to almighty god
that he conserve the / I require thangellis of heaven that they be in thy
company I require the marters of whom thou art of the nombre / yt they will
receive the in to the Joy perdurable / always I shall remember the weeping /
always I shall feel thy departing / as druyd did of natan and of absalon / Alas
Rolland thou ghost in to life and Joy perdurable / and leuest me in this world
sorouful / Thou art in heaven in consolacion / and I am in we pyn^^es and
tribulacions / All the world is evil content of thy death and thangellys has
brout the in comfort / In this manner and otherwise Charles bewept and sorowed
his neuew Roulland And he made his tentys to be set up there for to lodge
there all that night / and did do make great fyres and great lyghtes for to
watch the body of Roulland / and after he did do enoynte his body with myrre
and baulme and other things aromatiques for to conserve the body from evil
savor / and his obsequyes were made / and his entyerment with great prayers
offrynges and almesses in great contemplacion

How Olyuer was founden ^layn / and of the death of the sarasyns and of the death
of ganellon which was hydous capitulo v
IN the morn e^ly charles came where the bataylle had been with his pep^e /
and there they fond the noble Olyuer stratched out in manner of a cross
which was fastened to four stakes with iiij cords and sharply bounden / and
fro the neck to the nails or vngles of his feet and hands he was slain / he
was al to hewn and shot and hurt / with speres / sharp darts / quarellys
and arowes / and beten with staves / he was al to frusshed and broken /
wherefore the cry of many of the christian began to renew for the hydous death of
Olyuer and of many other / wherefore Charles swear by god almighty that he would
never cesse till that he had founden the sarasyns / and forthwyth he went with
his host and noblesse / and by cause that the paynyms were much far fro
them / god showed a fair miracle / For that same day was prolonged three days
long / without that the son rem^ued any thing / and they fond the sarasyns
by a river named Ebra in Cezarye / which rested them and ete and drank at
their ease without doubtyng of any thing and charles and his people came upon
them so Impetuously that in a letel while there were slain iiij M sarasyns /
and the other fled and saved them self / Then the emperor seeing that he
myg^^ goo no ferther / returned to rou^cyuale / And began tenqu^^^ upon the
fayt of traysen / and who had done it and what man / Then he was informed
that Ganellon had made it / and that was the comune oppynyon of them all / And
emonge all other Thyerry accused and appled him of the treason / and that he
would fight in the quarrel / For Thyerry had know (...) lock by the sarasyn that
rolland had bounden to a tree / The king charles ordained a knight for ganellon
named pynable to fyt against thyerry / And when these ij champyons were in the
lystes anon pynalle was slain by Thyerry / and as well by this moyen as by
other it appyered clearly that ganellon had bytrayed them / wherefore the
emperor Charles without going any ferther did to take iiij great horses / and
made to sytte on them iiij strong men / and bond ganellon to two horses by
his ij hands / and bond the two feet to the other ij horses / and made him to
be drawn with the one horse toward y^ eest and that other toward the weste /
that other against the southe / and that other toward the north / In this manner
each of the horse drew forth his quarter of the body of the part which he was
bounden unto /

How after the things before said charles gaf thankynges and p^eysynges to god
and saint Denyz / and of the constytucions that he made in france capitulo vj
When therecucyon was done of Ganellon and executed / charles and his people
came in to the place where the frensshe men had be slain / and bygan to know
their parents / friends / and lords for to bear them in to hallowed place /
they carried sum upon their horses / Other salted them with salt for to
mayntene them to br^nge them in to their contreye / Other buried them in the
same place / and sum bare them on their sholdres / Sum ennoynted them with
oylle and myrre / and sum with baulme the best wise they might / Nevertheless
there were two cymytoyres or chircheyerdes right devout and pryncypally
hallowed emonge the other / which were sacred and blessed with vij bishops /
That one of the cymytoyres was in orles / and that oath in burdegale / and
Saint maxymyen of ayz / Saint Trophyn of arles / poule of nerbo^ne Saint
Saturyn of Toulouse / saint fontyn of poytyers / saint Marcel of lymoges / and
saint Eutrope of xayntes had sacred and hallowed them / In which places were
buried the most party of the frensshe men / slain and destroyed in rouncyuale
/ The Emperor did do bear rolland the glorious marter upon two mules couerd with
clothes of sylke honorably unto bloye / and in the church of saint Romayn the
which he had edefyed and founded with chanonnes reguler / he did rychely burye
him / and with great magnyfycence / and on hye over his sepulture he did do
set his sword / and at his feet he did do set his horn of yuorye / Not
wythstondyng after the horn was taken aweye and borne to Saint Seueryn at
bourdeaws / At bourdeanlx were buried olyuer and gaudeboy king of Fryse / Ogyer
king of denmark and Crestayn king of bretayne / Garyn duc of Lorayne and many
other / As for Eaferus king of bourdeaulx / Euglerius king of guyan / lambert
king of bourges / and galerus reygnaut with v M other charles gaf xij C ounces
of silver of money that time courant / and as much of talents of gold and many
robes / and mete to pour people for sauacyon of their souls / and all the land
seven mile about he gaf to the church of saint Romayn / and maad if subgette
to that relygyon / And al bloye with thappertenauntes and the sea against the
said terrytorye he gaf semblably to the said church for charity and love of
Rolland / and ordained it so for ever / and on the day of their passion he
ordained that in the same place should every year perpetuelly xxx pour men be
fed and clothed competently / and thyrty messys songen for them that there
were buried and entyered / and for all them that were deed in spain for the
christian faith / In Arles was buried the count of lengres / samson duc of
bourgoyne / Naymes duc of bauyere / Arnold de bellandus / and Allert bourgoynon
/ and other five knights with ten thousand other moyen people / Constantyn
prouoste of Rome was borne to Rome with many other Romans / and for ye remedy
of their souls / the emperor gaf in arles for alms xij C ounces of silver and
xij talentes of gold which was worth a great sum of gold and silver courant
in that time /

How Charles went in to Almayne where he deyed holyly / And of his death showed
to Turpyn and of his buryeng Imperyally capitulo vij
AFter the things aforesaid / The Emperor charles and Turpyn with the other
came and passed by vyenne (...) there Turpyn tharchebysshop a much holy man
abode for he was weary and much febled of ^^r pain that he had had for the
faith in spain / and Charles went to paris / and anon after he assemaled all the nobles and the most grettest lords of his contreye for to establyssh
certain ordynaunces / and for to give thankynges to god and to saint Denis of
the vyctorye that he had obtained in his time upon the sarasyns paynyms and
myscreauntes / And after that he had thanked god and saint denis / and to his
church fast by paris like as saint Poule thappostle and saint Clement the pope
had done in time passed / he maad constytucyon entyere / that all the kings of
France present and to come should obey to the pastor that should be for yt
time of that church / and that never king should be crowned without the
past^ur of that church / ne the bishop of paris should not be received at Rome
without his consent and commandment / And he gaf many rychesses to y^ church
and in token that france was given to that church of saint de^y^ / he
ordained that every possessour in all ye nacyon of france should give and be
bounden to give to the church of saint denis for to edefye and augmente it
iiij pens of money courant yearly and perpetuelly and al they that should give
it with a good will / if they were of bond and serve condycion ^e would they
should be frank and f^re of condycyon / And after anon these things ordained
/ he went and came tofore the body of saint denis much deuousely / and there
he prayed the glorious saint that he would pray unto our lord Ihesu Christ /
that all they y^ were deed of the christian faith in the time that he had reigned
that they might be saved / and that the pain that they had taken myt be to
them the crown of martyrdom in the glory perdurable / and in semblable wise
he prayed for all them that would pay gladly the pens aforesaid to his church /
As god would that night following saint denis appyered to him and said to him in
this manner / O king understand me / know thou / that I have made prayer to
god my maker / and he has granted that all they that have been against the
sarasyns with the have pardon of al their trespaces / and that wyllyngly shall
pay the penyes for the edefycacyon of my church and augmentyng the service of
god / they shall have amendment of life and pardon of their sins / This vysyon
on the morn the emperor recounted to his people like as he had herd by cause
they should with a good will pay^the pe^yes that he had ordained / and he that
gaf it was called the frank of saint denis by canse that he was free and quyte
of al seruage by the commandment of the king / After came the custom that /
that land which was called Gallia lost his name / and was called france as
it is named at this day / and France is as much to say as free of al seruage
anenst al people / and therefore the lords of France for this cause emonge al
christian men owen to be honored and praised /

The recapitulacion of all this work / and of his death at Acon / and of his
sepulture capitulo viij
THe king Charles continued gloriously his life in virtuous operacyons And when
he felt the declyne of his life / he went unto Acon where he had tofore done
much good / and enobled a church of our lady the round / the which he did
do make / and gaf thereto great tresour of relyques of bodies of saints / of
gold and silver / of clothes of sylke and other precyosytees meruayllous / and
there he deyed in the year of his age lxxij / and for the magnyfycence of his
works / he was called charles the great / and he had iij sons then living /
of whom the first was named Charles / the second Pepyn / and the third ^owys /
and also he had iij daughters / that one was named Rotrudys / that other berga
/ and the third gylla / and when he knew that he might no longer live / his
sone lowys whom he had ordained for specyal love king of guyan / he left to
him the mageste Imperyal / For to know the holiness and the glorious end of
Charles / and how he was saved in heaven and renomed an holyman / The devout
Turpyn archebysshop of Raynes says in this manner / I Turpyn archebysshop of
Raynes was in vy^nne in the church tofore thaulter / and was rauysshed in
saying the psalm / Deus in adintoryum meum intend / I saw a company of
black people like Ethyopyens which were in quantyte Innumerable / which went
toward lorayne / and I saw one tofore his fellows / and I demanded him
whyther al they went the which being constrained to ansuer said / we all goo
to Acon to the death of Charles which lies a dyeng / And we will see if we may
have his soul for to bear in to (...) to perpetuel damynacyon / Then I said
to him I adjure the by the virtue of the name of our Lord Ihesu christ that
without fa^^^lynge after that ye have done / that thou return by me / Anon
after or he could / fynysshe his psalm / the deuylles came retournyng ageyn in
the same order that they went / And then I said to him that I had spoken to
before / what have ye done there as ye have been / that same devil ansuerd /
that James of galyce friend to charles has been much contrary to us / for
when we were ready for to receive his soul / and had egally departed his good
deeds and his evil / he brought so many stones and tymbre of chyrches which he
had do made in the name of him / that his good deeds surmounted much his evil
deeds / wherefore we might have no thing ne part / and this said / the devil
banysshed away / and so he lost his vysyon / Thus Charles in the month of
feueryere rendered his soul to god holyly / For after that he returned fro
spayn he did But la^guysshe and appayre in his body toward his death / and in
his end he ordained many almesses and to say many masses and psaulters / And
the vysyon that the glorious archebysshop Turpyn saw / is sygnyfycacion that
he which maynteneth and edefyeth chyrches in this present world / that he
makes preparacyon of his syege in heaven / His sepulture was much honorable
emonge all the sepultures of the world / noble and rich excellently and so fair
that it myt not be amended / and over his tomb was maad an arche of gold and
silver and of precious stones comprysed by great science / and thither came Leo
the pope accompanied with princes Romans / archebysshops / bishops Abbottes /
Dukes / Earls / and many other lords / and did do make a fair representacyon
of the body of Charles clad rychely and Imperyally with a fair crown of gold
set on his head and satte upon a chayer of gold much fair and shynyng / and
resembled well a notable Judge living / and they set upon his knees notably the
text of the four gospelles in fair letters of gold / and with the ryt hand
he held the lettre / and in the lift hand he held the ceptre Imperial much
rich / and by cause the heed should not enclyne to either side hit was underset
with a chain of gold and sustained / And the crown that was on his beed
raught to the arche which was al above well made / and the conduytes of the
sepulture were replenysshed with all good odours aromatyques and precious / and
after closed and shette much subtylly and honorably kept / as it was well
worthy for to be done

Thexcusacyon of thauctour ix
THis work accomplysshed to the playsyr of god tofore wryton conteyneth three
books by the chapytres divided as it appyereth openly to the reders / and I
have made them / three / after that I have comprysed in the separacyon and
deuydyng of the matyer / Of which the first book speaks of the beginning of
france / and of the first christian king of france / thhyche was named Cloys by
the moyen of his wife clotildys in descendyng to king Pepyn fader of the emperor
Charles / In the honor of whom this book is composed for the most part / to
the which Pepyn the lygnage of king Cloys took an end in succession of the
Royalme of France / And the said first book says more over how Charles was
nourysshed / of his corpulence / of his etyng / of his strength / of his
science / and other works of magnyfycence / The second book speaks of the
bataylle that Olyuer did against Fyerabras the meruayllous geaunte sone of
ballant Admyral of spain / a puyssaunt king / and all the first part of the
second book is attrybued to noble olyuer and in the honor of him / After ye
shall find how the peers of france were deteyned in Aygremore and put in
surete / and after saved fynably by florypes the curtoys daughter of the said
ballant / And the holy relyques recouured and other matters of great meruaylles
/ The in book speaks how by reuelacyon of saint James charles went and
conquered spain and galyce where as he did operacions virtuous and made
constytucyons of sauacyon with many bataylles done by him and his subgettes /
and fynably of the trayson of Ganellon by the which the death of Rolland was

knights slain and deed / And fynably the death of Charles the emperor as tofore

/ the table made at beginning shall show it to him lightly if it be his
playsyr to here or read of yt werk in this book composed /

Thenuoye of thauctour ca x
AS I have said at the beginning of this present work / the escryptures and
feats / sum have been reduced in writing for to be in memory / to the end
that they that have done well / be to us ensaumple in ensyewyng and following
them / and they that have done evil may be cause to rewse our life for to come
to the port of health / For the comune understanding is more content to
reteyne parables and examples for the ymagynacion local / than to simple
auctoryte / the which is retained by understanding / and also semblably
thys^oryes spekyng of our lord Ihesu christ of his miracles / and of his
virtuous subgettes / every man out gladly to here and retenne them and it is so
that at the request of the said venerable man to fere named Master henry
bolonnyer chanonne of lausanne I have been Incyted to translate and reduyse in
prose in to Frensshe the ma^er tofore reduced as much as touches the first
and the third book / I have taken and drawn out of a book named myrrour
hystoryal for the most part / and the second book I have only reduced it out
of an old romau^ce in frensshe / And without other Informacyon th^n of the
same book I have reduced if in to prose substa^cyally without fayllyng / by
ordinance of chapytres and parties of the said book after the matter in the
same contained And if in all this book I have mesprysed or spoken otherwise than
good langage substancyally full of good understanding to al makers and clerks I
demand correxyon and amendem^nt / and of the defaultes pardon / For if the
pen has wryton evil / the heart thought it never / but intended to say well /
and also my wit and understanding wh^che is right little can not vttre ne
write this matere without error / Nevertheless who so understands well the
lettre / shall well compryse mine entencyon / by which he shall find nothing but
moyen for to come to saluac^on / To the which may fynably come all they that
wyllyngly read / or here / or do this book to be read Amen

And by cause I Wylliam Caxton was desired and required by a good and synguler
friend of mine / Master wylliam daubeney one of the tresorers of the Iewellys
of the noble and most christian king / our naturel and souerayn lord late of
noble memory king Edward the fo^rth on whose soul Ihesu have mercy To reduce
al these said hystoryes in to our english tongue I have put me in deuoyr to
translate this said book as ye here tofore may see al a long and pl^yn /
prayeng all them that shall read / see or here it / to pardon me of this simple
and rude translacyon and reducyng / bysechyng them that shall find fault to
correct it / and in so doing they shall deserve thankynges / and I shall pray
god for them / who bring them and me after this short and transytorye life to
everlasting bliss Amen / the which work was fynysshed in the reducyng of hit
in to english the xvin day of Iuyn the second year of king Rychard the third
/ And the year of our lord MCCCClxxxv / And enprynted the first day of decembre
the same year of our lord and the first year of king Harry the seventh /
