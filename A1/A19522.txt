Christian Readers, I have Dedicated and directed this my Book unto all You,
the Elect Children of God, desiring through Jesus Christ, your health in the
LORD.
GEntle Readers, or Hearers, whosoever ye are, that are the Children of GOD,
unto whom this my Book is Dedicated: I desire you all, as good and ^ouing
Patrons, which shall either hear or peruse this my labor, to grant me these
two requests: First, to believe, that in making it, I have made it according
unto the Truth, wherein I aim not at mine own profit, but at the setting
forth of Gods glory, the discha^ge of my conscience, and the benefit of you the
Children of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Secondly, to read it
attentively, with all sedulity; and censure as you shall find, accept as you
like, and deal therein toward me the Author, as God shall move your minds.
And with all, I most earnestly desire you, and every one of you, tha^ shall
gather any spiritual comfort to cure your souls, out o^ these my Labors, to
receive my instructions willingly, treasur^ them in your hearts carefully, an^
meditate thereon zealously, tha^ ye enter not into temptation carelessly.

And further, I entirely beseec^ you, to pray unto our Lord Jesus Christ for
me, to give me his Grace, guide me with hi^ Word, and direct me by hi^ Holy
Spirit, that what I eythe^ Preach or Write, I may both i^ life and Doctrine,
express an^ perform the same unto my liu^ end: That whilst I endeavor t^
raise others, I may raise m^selfe from all my sins, unto the Glory of GODS
Holy name, and the salvation of my own soul, in the great day of our Lord:
And so do for me, an earnest repentant sinner, even as you your selves,
toward your selves, expect from Jesus Christ. Vale in Christo.

Yours toward you, as I would you should be for me* John Andrews Preacher of
Gods Word,

THE Converted Man's new Birth: Describing the direct way to go to HEAVEN.
CHAP. I.
This first Chapter entreats of the principal Care, Zeal, and vehement
desire, which every one ought to take in the seeking their salvation.
THere is nothing in the World that we ought so to affect and desire, as to
seek to have our souls saved in the Kingdom of Heaven: And if there be any
thing in the Book of GOD, from the Alpha of Genesis, unto the Omega of the
Revelation, that is able to draw a sinner unto Repentance, sure it is the
remembrance of his Salvation; And as the Lord of Hosts has drawn his sword by
foreign Nations, showing the miseries that are like to ensue upon us by
reason of our sin, and security: Let us now therefore, with all expedition,
bestow our short and troublesome time in seeking our salvation, and with all
Humility return unto the Lord by speedy Repentance, for if we loose the life
of our bodies, by defending the Gospel, in seeking our salvation, we may find
it again; but if we loose our souls for want thereof, it will be
irreuokeable, and never recalled again: Oh too too many now a days in this
declyning age, seem to be careless of their salvation.

And although England never lived so long in peace and security, nor the
Gospel never so generally Preached amongst us, yet I fear, never did men make
so ill use of so good a blessing; miranda miserecordia, Gods mercy is to be
wondered at, that he has spared us so long; it is his mercy, and nothing but
his mercy, that we are not consumed; our sins is, In ultimo gradu, in the
highest degree that may be, so that Laetantur cum malefecerint, they rejoice
and take pleasure, when they have done evil; wherefore I doubt not, but the
iniquity of the whole World is come to maturity, which causes our sins to
cry louder then the sins of Sodom; Ezekel 16. 49. 50.
and ascend higher then the sins of Niniuch. Jonas 1. 2.


Wherefore, if all our Navy were ready, all our Ports fortified; all our
Coasts guarded; all our men strongly armed, and our Land environed with a wall
of Brass; yet it is to be feared, that we have a Traitor within us, even our
long continued and unrepented sins, that will draw Gods vengeance upon us,
and cause him to whet his sword, and utterly confound us, Except we repent.
God would have spared Sodom, i^ there had been but twenty, nay but ten
Righteous therein: So no doubt, it is for some good peoples sake, that holds up
their hands like Moses, and grieve for the sins of our time, like Lot, that
God has spared us so long.

Again, Gods sword was once drawn against Nineveh, against whom a fearful
doom was pronounced; Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be destroyed. The King
and the Nobility, Jonas 3. 4.
with all his Subjects, presently fell to Repentance: they fasted; they prayed;
and incessantly with all humility humbled themselves in Sacke-cloath and Ashes,
their sins cried for vengeance; but their Repentance for mercy, their sins
ascend up to Heaven, Jonas 1. 2.
and clamours loud in the ears of Gods justice for vengeance, vengeance, O
revenge with vengeance.

Their Repentance ascends higher, and cries louder into the ears of Gods
mercy: Good Lord have mercy, spare us, O spare us we beseech thee; whereby we
may see that God regards not the clamor of sin, so much as he does the cry
of a true repentant sinner.

But England, O sinful England, there was never any Nation in the World,
that has such store of Heavenly Manna, as his Word, his Will, his Truth, his
Gospel, which we have received, Iugentia beneficia, infinite benefits, much
knowledge of the Truth, so much Preaching of the Word, and so much glorious
light of the Gospel: And yet Mirandum est degeneres nos, it is wonder, and a
great wonder, that such a degenerate generation as this, such a corrupt and
sinful Nation as we, should so live in such a blessed and illuminated a
time.

But our sins, our sins, our unrepented sins, are more then can be
numbered by any Arithmetition, and greater then can be measured by a
Geometrition: As our Jeremiah 5. 7. Eccles. 23. 9.
swearing and forswearing; our Ierem. 17. 21.
prophatning the Lords Sabbath; our Iere. 6. 14. Jeremiah 5. 3.
contempt of Gods Word; our Jeremiah 6. 13
covetousness; our Amos 6. 6.
drunkenness; our Esaias 3. 10, 11, 12. Jeremiah 9. 5.
deceit; our Ezechiel 6. 9.
whoredom, our pride, our unthankfulness, and our waxing worse and worse, with
many more, which cry to Heaven for Gods vengeance against us.

Oh therefore let us with all expedition seek for our salvation by speedy
repentance: Let us not only weep, but power forth our tears for our sins
like Esaias 5. Esaias 29. 20. Hab. 2. 5.
David: h Psalm. 6. 6.
Wrestle with GOD like Gene. 32. 24.
Jacob: Cry like Esaias. 58. 1.
Esaias: That our heads may be full of water, and our eyes a Fountain of tears,
like Iere. 4. 19.
Jeremiah: Let us be clad John 3. 6.
in Sacke-cloath like the Ninevites: Humbled unto the ground Gene. 17. 18*
like Abraham: Mourn like a Dove Esaias. 38. 14.
with Ezechia: Rore out Job. 3. 24.
our grief with Job: Power out our Soul 1 Samuel 1. 10.
with Hanna: Rent our Joel. 3. 13.
hearts with the penitent; lament with Mat. 26. 75.
Peter: Sorrow Luke 7. 38.
with Mary: And cry out with the Acts 16. 30. Acts. 2. 37.
Jews; Men and Brethren, what shall we do to be saved? For there is nothing
more needful, then the salvation of our souls.

The vehement desire of their salvation, caused the Patriarks, Prophets, and
the Saints of the old World, to long for, and desire that eternal, sweet, and
most joyful inheritance, Regnum Dei, the Kingdom of God; It caused Abraham to
forsake his Gene. 12. 4. Heb. 11. 8.
own natural Country; and his Fathers House, and t^ go^ he knew not whither:
It caused Moses to forsake Exodus 2. 11. Heb. 11. 24.
Egypt, and refused to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter: it caused Toby,
Job, Elias, and Paul, to wish To be dissolved, and to be with Christ.

It caused the careless Ninevites to believe Jonas. 3. 5.
Jonas Preaching: The desperate soldiers to hear Mat. 3 5
John's Sermon: The obstinate Israelites to hear Acts. 2. 37.
Peter's persuasion: The Euenuch to give ear to Acts. 18 38.
Phillip: Cornelius the Captain, with a great multitude, to hear Acts. 10. 5.
Peter; and the Macedonians to Acts. 20. 7
continue Paul's Doctrine until midnight.

When John the Baptist first Preached, Primitiua quidem Ecclesia, The Primitive
Church did most clearly shine, in so much that Mat. 11. 12.
the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence; That is, there was such forwardness
and zeal, in those that heard him Preach, to procure their salvation, in the
Kingdom of Heaven, that they strove most earnestly to go in; and this
affection our Savior requires, when he says, Strive to enter in at the
straight Gate; For Dominus vobiscum dum vos cum Domino: The Lord is with you,
Luke. 13. 24.
while ye hear his voice. 2 Chro. 15. 2.


The Prophet David lamented that he was so long kept from the joys of his
Salvation: Woe is me (says he) that I am constrained to dwell with Mosech,
and to have my habitation among the Tents of Keder. And again, Like as the
Heart desires the water brook; so longs my soul after thee O God: And
again, he says, That he should utterly have fainted, but that he did rest
in hope of a better Kingdom; and believed verily in short time, to see the
joys of his Salvation, in the land of the living.

And many others counted their Country but a cursed vale of misery; their
worldly glory but vanity; their dwellings but a Prison; their pleasure but
sorrow, mourning and tears; and all their doings were to this end that they
might joy in their salvation in the kingdom of Heaven.

CHAP. II.
The second Chapter entreats of the shortness, and uncertainty of man's life,
and how it may be a motive to induce us to return unto the Lord by repentance,
because no man knows the time thereof, nor when God will call him.

the same; for as all the world is mutable, so of all the things in the world,
man is most mutable, we are all but Tenants at will, and know not how long we
shall remain in this earthly Tabernacle, and as our days are but short and

suddenly, that they have scarce time to think on God, or once cry Lord
help me; therefore we ought always so to live, that we may ever Esaias 55. 6.
Iere. 25. 15. Gal. 6. 10. Heb. 3. 7. 15. Psalm 95. 8.
be prepared for the Lord.

Let the memory of death be ever the looking-glass of our life, and seeing
the young must depart from the World as well as the old: Let us imagine that
the Spring of our days are past, our Summer is spent, and that we are arrived
at the Autumn, or fall of the leaf; Psalm 89. 46
So that in every moment we are in the waning; The date of our poor
Pilgrimage almost expired, and the Lamp of our lives lies twinkling upon the
snuff; our forces enfeebled, our senses impaired, and on every side, our
tottering and ruinous cottage of our faint flesh, ready to fall.

It were now high time, therefore, to leave our own ways, and Psalm 77. 6.
with all expedition look toward our Caelestiall home; lest we be like
those which are tossed with many sturdy storms, and cannot ariue at their
desired Port; ride little way, but are much turmoyled.

So, these that pass many years in their unrepented sins, and purchase but
small profit to salve their sick souls, should have a long living in
destruction, Proverbs 8. 1.
but a short life in Wis. 4. 8. 9. Proverbs 16. 31 Wisdom 17. 10
conversion; besides that, where sin reigns there goes Gods curse also:
There is no peace to Esaias 48. 2^. Proverbs 28. 1.
the wicked.

But howsoever, whether in youth, or in age, we would leave our sins, and
return unto the Lord by Repentance, we must know this, that it is not in our
own Lam. 5. 21. Iere. 31. 18. 2 Timothy 2. 25, 26.
power.

No man can leave his sins when he would; nor no Pope or Potentate can pardon
them but God: neither is any Psalm 49. 7, 8 Acts. 4. 12. Hos. 13. 4. Psalm. 32.

Savior says, No man can come unto me, except my Father draw John 6. 44.
him.

The labourer received his penny, as well that came in the last hour, as he
that came in the Mat. 27. 38.
first: And the Thief was saved, that was on the Cross: So that there is no
time too late, in this life to repent, if we repent truly, whenever it
shall please God to call us, neither any time too early, if we prepare our
selves to leave our sins, and come unto him when he calls us: So that, whether
it be early, or late, we must always prepare our selves, to forsake our
selves in our sins, and come at his calling.

CHAP III
The third Chapter describes a short and Caelestiall view of the place,
whereunto we are called.
WE are not called unto any earthly John 7. 37.
Tabernacle, but to the Kingdom of Mat. 2^. 14.

and everlasting Kingdom, unto that Celestial and Heavenly Luke 24.

that we may enjoy, this blessed and everlasting Kingdom.

CHAP. IIII.
The fourth Chapter entreats of the Spiritual battle, in which no doubt,
every Regenerate man oftentimes fights against Satan, before he attain
eternal life.
Satan is ever quiet with the sinner, before he fears he shall loose him,
but then he seeks by all means that possibly he can, to attempt, pervert,
and utterly overthrow 1 Peter 5. 8
him.

Moses was quiet, until he began to deliver the Children of Israel; but
then ^orah could say, Number 16. 3*
Ye take too much upon you: King David was quiet when he kept his Fathers 1 Samuel 16. 11.
sheep; but after he fought for the Church of God: Then Saul 1 Samuel 17. 50. 1 Samuel 18. 11. 29
could rise against him: Saint Paul was quiet, so long as he was with the
Scribes Acts 9. 1, 2. Acts 22. ^^. 34.
and Pharisees, but afterward he had enemies enough: Satan tempted, and
overcame the perfectest, as Genesis 3. 6.
Adam; the strongest as Judges 16. 1^
sampson; and the wisest as 2 Reg 11
Solomon: He therefore that 1 Cor. 10. 12.
stands, let him take heed lest he fall, Christ was no sooner Baptized, and
had fasted Matthew. 4. 1* Luke 4. 1. Mark. 1. 12.
forty days, but Satan could tempt him.

And so it is with every Regenerate man, even when he is most weakest, then
the Devil is strongest, 1 Peter 5. ^.
and busiest against him; Who daily labors to delude him with all manner of
inticements: First, To delight in sin: Secondly, To consent: Thirdly, To
custom, and from custom to hardness of heart from hardness of heart, to
boasting, from boasting, unto desperation, and from desperation to damnation;
and thus by degrees, if sin be not resisted, the Devil will labor to bring
the sinner unto destruction. Wherefore we must daily labor to prevent them by
Divine meditations; divert them by fervent prayers, and correct them by sighs,
and speedy Repentance: For I hold those intisements, and vanishing thoughts,
which many times pass through a Regenerate man without approbation, not
without suppression, to be properly Nec mors nec morbus animae, sed deformitas,
Neither the death, nor disease of the soul, but the deformity thereof, they
are Tela immisa, Satan's darts, shot at us, In cord, non excorde, in the
heart, not of the heart: which the godly seek, but give no consent unto, they
are our crosses, but not our sins, they are but Morbus mentis, The disease of
the mind.

Those motions St. Paul confesses, the Children of God, are never free from
them: It is observed in Hierom, which he bewrayes in many places of his
works, That his whole life, was in continual war-faire with his lusts: It
caused St. Paul to cry out, to be delivered from the prick of the flesh; But
the Lord answered him, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made
perfect in thy weakness.

I hold these and such like temptations, to be the battle which every
Regenerate man fights against Satan. For, where were Timothy 2. 9.
grace, if there were James 1. 14.
no temptation? where were mortification, if no lusts to Romans 8 13.
mortify? And where were Colosians 3. 5 Job 2. 10.
patience, if there were no Psalm ^19. 71
affliction? if there were no motion to sin, where were the battle, the
victory, and the Crown we shall obtain, if we have no Adversary to strive
withal?

The Devil, as he is the Prince of this World, So still he seeks whom he
may devour; 1 Peter 5. ^.
he himself is chief general, and is always the sore-man in the battle; his
Lieutenants are fleshly lusts, which are in open war against Chastity: the
Sergeants of his Band, are the cursed Children of dacknesse, which are in
continual strife, against the Children of light: His common Soldiers are the
effects of the flesh, to fight against the fruits of the Spirit. And their
armor is the breast plate of injury, the girdle of falsehood, the shoes of
discord, the shield of infidelity, the helmet of mistrust, with the piercing
darts of cruelty, the Cannon shot of spiteful Reproaches, the arrows of
flying slanders, and the frailty of the flesh, to pervert and utterly confound
us, except we prevent them by Prayer and Repentance.

Therefore, the Children of God ought to put on Gods Armor, and manfully fight
against the devices of sin, Ephesians 6. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
Satan, and all his detestable crew, before they can obtain their spiritual
inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven: Which weapons are able to overcome the
Devil, and all the lewd lusts of the world; yea, and all the whole host of
vices therein.

Our Captain and chief General, in all our conflict, Is the mighty (...). 5.
5.
Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the (...)
Prince of Peace, the Conqueror (...)
of Death, (...)
Heil, and (...)
Sin: Yea, the G^^e^^s (...)
great Judge of the World, and (...) 2. 2^.
Bishop of our Souls, Christ Jesus Matthew 1. 21
our Savior.

And to resist the Tyranny of the Devil, 1 Timothy 4^ (...) Acts 5. 31.
it stands us in hand, to be also well and strongly armed, with the
breast plate of equity, the Shield of undoubted faith in Christ, the Helmet of
assured hope, the Shoes of knowledge and peace in the holy Ghost, the girdle of
truth, well buckled with patience, and constancy, the Cannon shot of deep
sighs, proceeding from a true penitent heart, the Arrows of bitter tears,
brought forth by remorse of conscience, and the two edged Sword of the eternal
word of GOD; For, it stands us upon, to keep our continual battle, ready
and orderly; To sight valiantly, hope assuredly, endure constantly, to march on
charitably and cheerfully: To watch and stand fast in our fight, for the
quarrel is GODS, and the Victory ours, even the very salvation of our own
souls.

If we resist the Devil in the power of Jesus Christ, He will fly from us:
So often as we resist him, so often we overcome, it will make the Angels glad,
and glorify GOD, which exhorts us to fight, and helps us in our extremity,
and time of need; GOD beholds our striving, and helps us up, that we should
not faint; and will crown us with glory, and honor when we overcome;
therefore, the greater our Temptations are, the more noble must be our
Resistance; and the more godly our lives and conuersations are, the greater
shall be our Crown and Glory, in the kingdom of Heaven.

CHAP. V.
The fifth Chapter entreats of the true estate of the Rege^erate man, with
the certainty of his salvation.

Merchants sold all that he had, and forsakes his Worldly wealth, to gain
one precious pearl: So the Regenerate man leaves and forsakes his sins,
and all worldly vanities, for to obtain eternal life: And does not only
dislike and forsake his sins, but also from the tender bowels of his heart,
incessantly, with all humility, power out his Mat. 15. 22 23 24* 25. 26. 27. 28

daily prayers unto Almighty God, to give him his grace, to suppress, and
mortify them; and so shows the power of Gods grace, working in him. And by
returning unto God by his true Repentance. God gives him John 5. 6. Ro^a^s ^
4. Gal^ ^ 16. ^^hesians 4 1.
a new heart, and a new Spirit, (not in substance or quantity, but in quality)
which is a true and faithful witness giving Testimoney, not to GOD, for that
it needs not; not to others, for that it cannot, but to the man who has it,
for that it must; of the Truth of those things which it knows to be in him,
concerning Gods will, and his own eternal wellfaire.

Seeing then A faithful witness will not lie; Proverbs 14. 7.
and the Spirit of the Penitent, testify the Truth of his Repentance; why may
not he then, be as firmly persuaded of the certainty of his salvation: as his
heart witnesses the sincerity of his conversion: Yes surely, 2 Cor. 13. 5.
St. Paul proves it, Know ye not your own selves, how Jesus Christ is in you,
except ye be Reprobates: We may surely know, that if we have truly
repented, and are heartily sorry for our sins, with a full and determinate
purpose to continue in newness of life, Romans 81.
That Christ is in us, John 5^. 24.
if Christ be in us, then we are in Christ; if we be in Christ, we cannot
be condemned: For there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.

For, sin legally considered is mortal, But Esaias 59. 2. Luke 13. 3. Nahu. 2.
25.
Euangelically, is venial, except the sin against the Holy Ghost, mortal,
by his own merit, but Esaias 1. 18. John 5. 8.
venial by Chirst his mercy: Mortal to the natural unregenerated man; For
he John 3. 18.
that believes not, is condemned already; but venial to the Regenerate though
still sin: By the covenant of grace, it dissolueth not the love and league
between God and man, and so is venial, in all other sin is mortal by his
own nature.

Again, Romans 7. 5. 6.
by nature man and his flesh are all one, but by grace they are separated: By
nature when the flesh does sin, the man also sins, because he is in
subjection unto it: but in the estate of grace, although the flesh be in him,
(and do sin,) yet he sins not, because they are di^orsed a sunder; For
man as soon as he is in the estate of grace, is newly married unto Christ: In
this case, although the flesh beget sin, yet the regenerate man shall not be
condemned.

Yet, one thing let us consider, That he which Iere. 20 14. 15. Psalm 22. 1.
Jonas 2. 4. Mark. 9. 24. Psalm 77. 6 Psalm 42. 11. Psalm. 51. 10. 12.
never doubted of his salvation, scarce ever believed to be saved; For it is
not every little sob, or sigh, that brings Repentance sufficient to please God,
or a little while to cry Lord help, Lord help, I am a sinner, but God is
merciful, etc. and so lightly daube them over, as though Gods mercy were
gained in a moment: Let no man deceive himself, It Luke 18. 1. Romans 12. 12.
Colo. 4. 2.
will cost him many a prayer, and many James 4. 9. Deuteronomy. 1. 45. Genesis 37. 34. 35

a tear, before he can be certain or sure to have pardon for his sins.

For as no man can repent until he know his sins, so no man can know his
sins until he search himself; Therefore you must with King Psalm 77. 6.
Psalm 119. 59.
David, Seach your spirits, and 2 Cor. 13. 5. Lamen. 3. 4. Psalm 4. 4
examine your conscience strictly, try it thoroughly, search it narrowly, to
prove dilligently, who, and what manner of person ye are, and in what case ye
feel your selves, to set, and know how deeply your conscience is wounded with
sin.

And then, if you find Psalm 77. 6.
your ways dangerous, and your case fearful, you must thereuppon resolve to
take a new course, and withal to seek how, and which way you may come again
into Pro. 3. 3, 4. Judges 6. 17.
favor with God: As David did, Who Psalm. 51.
cried unto God again, and again; and you must never leave the Lord, until
you obtain his Exodus 20. 6. Exodus 22. 27.
mercy, and favor, that you may get some comfortable persuasion of Gods love
in Christ, for the pardon of your sins; until you do so, you shall never

Psalm 30. 2. 3.
have any peace, or quietness of conscience, nor any sound comfort of Gods
holy Spirit in you.

Therefore, Vnum necessarium, This one thing is necessary, whatsoever we leave
unknown, let us labor to know this, That we are Gala. 4. 9. 2 Timothy 2. 19
Romans 11. 2. Colo. 1. 10. Hosea. 6. 6.
the Lords. Qui Christum discit, satis est si caetera nescit, He may without
danger be ignorant of those things, that truly knows Jesus Christ.

The best have desired to make their Salvation sure; as I the unworthiest of
all other, do daily labor to do the same: David which knew yt God loved him,
entreats to know it more, I know thou fauourest me; Psalm 35. 3.
yet he cried, Dic animamcae, Say unto my soul. I am thy Salvation.

The Scripture has many proofs of the John. 19. ^5 26. 27. Romans 8. 9. 15. 16.
Psalm 31. 1. Job 13. 25. 26. Gala 4. 5. 6. 7. John 4. 15. 16. 17 1 John 2. 28.
Psalm 35 9. 2 Peter 1. 10.
certainty of our salvation; and David would never pray for that which could
not be: neither would St. Peter charge us with a duty which could not possibly
be performed: Make your election sure; which must be done, by the true and
proper work of Heb. 11. 1. 5. 6 Mat. 9. 29. Dan. 3. 17. Acts 15. 9. 1 Peter 1.
9.
Faith, that gives the true believer a steadfast, and immovable assurance of
the love of God, that he may fully enjoy the comfort of his Salvation.

And whereas St. Paul says, Know ye not how Jesus Christ is in you, 2 Cor.
13. 5.
except ye be reprobates? Here the Apostle gives us to understand, that all
which believe, have the spirit of discerning, to know certainly that they do
believe. And shows that, to prove a man's self whether he be in the faith,
which is to prove whether Christ be in him, because the Faith of which he
speaks, is that lively says, whereby Christ dwells in our hearts.

He therefore that knows himself to be in the true Faith, knows Christ
to be in himself: As St. Paul says, I know whom I have believed. And again,
by this we know, 2 Timo. 1. 12.
he dwells in us, even by the spirit which he has given us: 1 John 3. 24:
It is manifest yt the property of true faith, guides the assurance of our
salvation, and the greater our faith is, 1 Peter 1. 7. 8 9
the greater is our assurance. And consequently the true believer knows, and
is assured of his election and salvation, for Faith is the Faith of Gods elect:
Acts 13. 48.
So many believed as were ordained unto salvation: ^om. 8. 38. 39.
And I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor
Principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, shall be
able to separate me, from the love of God. Therefore the Apostle was fully
persuaded of his salvation: 2 Timoth. 4. ^
And again, Henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righteousness: So the
Virgin Mary called Christ her Savior; Luke 1. 47.
and the Thief upon the Cross, Luke 23. 43.
said, Lord remember me; The like said St. Paul, Gala. 2. 20.
That Christ gave himself for me. Phil. 1. 2. 3.
If you be demanded how long you may be assured of your salvation; you may
answer, so long as you have truly repented, and continue in newness of life,
your sure trust and confidence is, yt God will never forsake them that put
their trust in him: for Every one that believes in him, Romans 9. 33.
shall not be ashamed.

And this promise God has made to all that believe in him: I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me: Iere. 32. 40.
And again, There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, because
(says the Apostle) they walk not after the flesh, Romans 8. 1.
but after the Spirit.

Lastly, the most excellent Faith, shows not it self most glorious, when we
have most sense or feeling; but rather when we feel, or discern the contrary.
Job, Job 13. 15.
when he apprehended nothing but Gods wrath and displeasure, even then he
showed a most victorious Faith, Lo, though he slay me, yet will I trust in
him: The like of Jacob, in his tedious conflict, Gene. 32. 24.
where he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me: Hosea 12. 4.
And the woman of Canaan, who although she received diverse repulses, and
earnest denial, yet continued her suite, Mat. 15. 28.
and is commended* for her Faith, Heb. 12. 2.
by the Author and finisher of our Faith.

To conclude, we are not to build the assurance of our salvation, upon our
own sense or feeling; but upon Gods unchangeable and gracious promises made
unto us, in Christ Jesus.

CHAP. VI.
The sixth Chapter, shows an excellent mark to know the child of God, which
has truly repented.
HE that has earnestly Repented, and is truly converted from his sins, has
this special mark in him: Mat. 13. 14.
He is none of those fruitless Mat 13. 19. 29
hearers, barren believers, unregenerate knowers, or verbal Professors; but he
is the faithful doer of the will and word of God.

Whosoever 1 John 3. 5
keeps Gods word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: Hereby know we
that we are in him, he that abides in God, ought also to walk even as he
has walked: That is as St. John shows us, Every man that 1 John 3. 2.
has this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure: And seeks
Psalm 95. 8.
the present time to return unto the Lord; because he has a bleeding and a
tender Psalm 51. 17
heart; it trembles Psalm 51. 4.
at the Word: It is pricked Acts 2. 37.
when it is rebuked; and inflamed with burning Psalm 69. 5. John 2. 17 psalm

zeal, when it is instructed. The Regenerate man desires nothing so much, As
he (...) 55. 6. 26.
desires God; Therefore, he makes himself 1 John 3. 3.

but dung, that he may win Christ.

He rejoices in Rom 12 19. 20
forgiving them that hurt him; and Mat. 5. 44.
loves them that hate him; and Romans 12. 19.

of life. All those that walk in newness of life, are such as our Savior
Christ called his Mother, Sister, Mar. 3. 35.
and Brother, his Romans 6. 18
Servants, his Friends, John 15. 14. 1
his Sons, and Can. 5. 1
his Spouse.

All those be terms of love, and that from Christ himself, to requite the
Regenerate man, that returns unto him by unfeigned Repentance.

Non tam audire, quam obedire requirit Deus, God regards more an obedient
heart, than an attentive ear; what should I say more, seeing the whole course
and cannon of Scripture runs that all Christians in their returning unto the
Lord by Repentance should be Attents, vigilantes, Psalm. 130. 3. Psalm 143. 2

happ^est estate that can be given unto man, a blessed gift: Who can desire
more to move him to return unto the Lord by Repentance.
