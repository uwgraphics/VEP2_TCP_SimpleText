TO THE RIGHT HOnorable, Sir William Cecil, Knight, Baron of Burleygh, Lord
high Treasurer of England, Master of the Queens Majesty's Courts of Wards
and Liueries, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of her
Highness most honorable privy Counsel, continuance of health, with
prosperity and increase of honor.
IT has bin reported (Right Honorable and my very good Lord) and is found
true of al men, that the Be, when she has gathered her honey, flies
immediately to the hiue, where she leueth the same, as in the place of sauegarde
for her fruit, and as a gain of her labor: whose pain as it is commended of
al, so also is it diligently followed but of a few, who whilst they come to the
sweet flowers and wise sentences of the word of God, do but basely read and
negligently consider the same, whereas they should draw and suck out, yea,
and lay up even with the Be, to their best use, most pleasant honey. And this
they should do, not only for themselves, but also for other. For huing to the
profit of the Church of God, they imparie their labors to the benefit there
of, yea besides the food to their own souls, other are comforted by them: as
amongst other (Right honorable) Master Michael Cope, Preacher of the word of
God in Geneua, deserved not the least praise, who painfully traveling in the
Proverbs of Solomon, did not only read them for his own delight, but also
sucked out of every flower of the same Garden, most sweet honey: which being
faithfully gathered and disposed in the Hiue, he left as a fruit of his labor
to al posterity, for all the godly to be partakers of. Now for that it is not
the gift of every man to drive the Hiue wherein the Be gathers her honey
(although I know that many can, amongst whom your honor may be equal with
the best) yet because it was preached, and then written in the French tongue,
which most understand not, I thought it unmeet, that so sweet a nourishment
should be with holden from my country men: and therefore have bin bold under
your honors protection to communicate it as well as I could for their profit
and commodity, which I am bold the rather to dedicate to your honor; because
you love those that live to other; because you are a Patron, and so have showed
yourselfe of al honest labors, who albeit you understand the tongue, yet are
you glad to have it made known unto others. These things considered, and for
that also I have received benefit heretofore at your honors hands, I thought
it my bounden duty, to dedicate the translation of this Comentarie upon the
Proverbs of the wise King Solomon to your honor: assuring my self, that your
care will be no less in the protecting of so good a work, then there shall
happen profit to the wise reader thereof: for what would any man desire for
the full accomplishement of knowledge, belonging to all estates, that is not
handled in the Proverbs? Or what would he desire for his profit, that is not
contained in the Proverbs? for therein shall every man find, from the highest
to the lowest, his duty prescribed most notably, as for Kings, godliness,
justice and mercy: for Magistrates and Judges, wisdom and true dealing: for
rich men, liberality to the poor: again, that the poor be contented with
his estate, without murmuring: to be short, he teaches the husband fidelity:
the wife, obedience: children, reverence: servants, diligence: finally, he
sets down a punishment for the proud, a reward for the lowly, a dangerous
estate for scorners and disdainers of the word of God: the life of a lier
altogether unlawful: the usurer, covetous, and unchaste, clean condemned.
Contrariwise, he exhorts that the merciful, liberal, and well doers, be
imitated and followed: al which and a thousand more then I am able to repeat,
as they are most notably set down by the wise King Solomon, so are they very
learnedly, and most plainly declared by Master Cope. Wherefore (Right
honorable) since that the majesty of the matter is so great, and the wisdom
of the wise man so unsearchable: I trust your Lordship will bear with my
rudeness, and supporte mine endeavor in publishing and making manifest this
simple translation to al men. And although I am not a translator of such
rypenesse in judgment, and perfection in style, as the matter requires, and
as I my self could have wished: notwithstanding, I hope I have rendered it at
the least, sense for sense: and where the French and our tongue do agree,
verbatim; that out of the words, one may gather the sense; and out of the
sense the reason, and so obtain the truth: most humbly beseeching your
honor to take in good part this my rude labor and bold enterprise, the which
if it shall please your honor of your accustomed clemency to do, you shall not
only encourage me to greater things, but also show yourselfe a comfort to all the godly. And thus being loath to offend your honor by tediousnes, or to
withhold you from your grave and most weighty affairs, I beseech the
Almighty God by Jesus Christ our Savior, long to preserve your honor in
health, wealth, and godliness, to the glory of his name, profit of his
Church, and good of this our common weal and country, and to your own
everlasting comfort in him. Amen.

Your honors most humble to command, Marcelline Outred.

FINIS. Gathered by Abraham Fleming.
A familiar exposition of Michael Cope upon the Proverbs of Solomon.
1 THe parables of Solomon the Son of David king of Israel. 2 To know
wisdom and instruction, to understand the words of knowledge. 3 To receive
instruction to do wisely by justice and judgment and equity.
THe parables etc. The Lord appeared 1. King. 3. 9.
in Gibeon to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, ask what I shall
give thee. And Solomon said, give therefore unto thy servant an understanding
heart to judge thy people, that I may discern betweeene good and bad. And GOD
said unto him, because thou have asked this thing, etc. Behold I have done
according to thy word: lo I have given thee a wise and an understanding
heart, so that there has been none like thee, before thee, neither after thee
shall arise the like unto thee. Through this wisdom and understanding he
judged the people of Israel of whom he was feared. By this self same
wisdom he spoke three thousand parables: as it is written. This was whiles
he was king over Israel, that he used such wisdom in doings and sayings:
even whiles he 1. King. 4. 32
was a peaceable king, according to the promises of GOD. Behold, a son is
borne unto thee, which shall be a man of rest, for I will give him rest from all
his enemies round about; therefore his name is 1. Chro. 22. 9
Solomon: and I will send peace and quietness upon Israel in his days. All
kings, Princes and Magistrates, should here learn whereto they ought to apply
their understanding, and what they should flee and hate.

To know, etc. Albeeit we are not kings, neither worldly princes, nor have
public charge, yet ought we to follow the wisdom of goo^ Kings and Princes,
as they are given us of God for an example. And forasmuch as we have not at al
times wise superiors, as experience teaches, yet have we need at al times to
be wise, unless we will perish with the foolish. For neither the folly of the
great or small shall excuse us to be culpable of damnation, if we follow it and
delight therein. And therefore Solomon was not only content to be as a mirror
of wisdom to those of his time, but would also profit al ages, so long as
the world should last: and to this end has he written these notable
proverbs and excellent sentences, profitable to teach one to govern himself
wisely in all holiness and honesty, in all righteousness and innocence, in all
modesty and sobriety, in the faith and fear of God, as it shall be known in
hearing and reading them. But to make us more attentive and diligent to read
and hear them, and to print them in our memory, to delight also in speaking of
them, chiefly to the instruction of the ignorant: he at the beginning shows
us wheretoo and to whom these sentences do serve. If we were not very dull
and blockish, we would greatly desire to be adorned with these virtues.

Wherefore we must neither be deaf nor negligent, but ready and diligent to
hear the Proverbs of king Solomon, whereby he promises to teach us first
wisdom: not the wisdom of this world, neither 1. Cor. 2. 6.
of the princes of this world, which perish. Such wisdom is foolishness before
God, who gave Solomon this wisdom which he teaches by these Proverbs. If then
we learn them truly, and delight in that which they teach, we shall be endued
with heavenly wisdom. The which as it is and has been ever one, so let us
not think that Solomon does teach any new thing: for it is said, Ye shall
put nothing unto the Deuteronomy. 4. 2.
word which I command you, neither shall ye take ought therefrom etc. The
wisdom then that he teaches us, is to cleave fast to the word of God, in
walking after his commandementes. It is that wisdom, which Moses taught the
children of Israel in the same place Deuteronomy. 4.
saying: behold, I have taught you ordinances and laws, as the Lord my God
commanded me, etc. But here it might be said that Solomon needed not to
have written, seeing Moses had before already written, and that he teaches no
other wisdom, but that which Moses taught. It may be answered, that that
which Moses has briefly and obscurely taught for the capacity of the people,
Solomon dilateth and amplifieth, and therein he serves as an interpreter to
Moses. But it may be said again, if Solomon do teach no other wisdom,
than that which Moses taught, that he teaches not Jesus Christ, who of God is
made unto us wisdom and righteousness: and 1. Cor. 1. 10.
therefore his doctrine appertains nothing unto us, which should regard to
know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified: I answer, that Moses has
spoken of Jesus Christ. If you had believed John. 5. 46. Gal. 3. 24.
Moses, you would also have believed me. The law was our schoolemaister to
bring us to Christ, etc. But Solomon teaches not only the law, but also
faith: and sets forth unto us diverse promises of GOD, and consequently he
teaches us Jesus Christ, of whom also he was a figure: for all the promises
of God are yea, and Amen in Jesus Christ. Wherefore when we hear the
Proverbs 2. Cor. 1. 20.
of Solomon, let us not think that he will lead us only to do the works of
the law outwardly* but that chiefly he tends to frame our manners to the
fear and reverence of God, the which is not done without faith.

Secondly, he promises us Instruction. Whereby we should know what to do
and what to eschew, for to live in this present world soberly, righteously,
and religiously: the which instruction is not only in words, but also in
temptations and afflictions. Whereupon it follows that Solomon being on
earth, spoke not Deuteronomy. 8. 1.
earthly, but heavenly: for we can have no instruction, unless God speak to
us from Heaven, as Moses does show it very well. Out of Heaven he made thee
hear his voice to instruct thee, etc. Deuteronomy. 4. 46.
Wherefore, if we be given to earthly and worldly things, and persevere therein,
we cannot receive instruction. It is then needful for us to withdraw
ourselves from the desire of worldly things, and that by the means of Gods
grace. For S. Paul says, For the grace of God that Tit. 2. 11.
brings salvation unto al men, has appeared, and teaches us that we should
deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and that we should live soberly and
righteously and godly in this present world.

Thirdly, he promises that we shall have knowledge and understanding in the
law and word of God: the which only is our knoweledge and understanding. It
is said also in John, And hereby we are Deuteronomy. 4. 8. 1. John. ^. ^.
sure that we know him, if we keep his commandments. This knowledge
ought to be greatly esteemed of us, as Jeremy admonishes us theretoo. Let
not the wise man glory in his wisdom, etc. But let him that glories, glory
in this, that he understands and Ier. 9. 23.
knows me. Through this knowledge we differ from brute beasts. We ought
then to give good heed to these sayings of the wise Psalm. 32. 9.
man: Fourthly, he promises us Instruction to do wisely, that is to say,
that by his sayings we shall learn to be well ruled and governed, and also
that willingly we shall hear those which show us our faults: and chiefly
those which are expert and wise, which know how to reprove, and use it in
time and place: that by their correction we may amend our life and become
wise. And by these sentences he labors to withdraw us from death, wheretoo
the obstinate and stubborn are bent. Or despisest thou the riches of his Romans
2. 4.
bountifulness and patience, and long sufferance, not knowing that the
bountifulness of God leads thee to repentance? etc. Finally, they serve so
to frame our hearts, that we should delight to give to our neighbors that which
is theirs, to suffer no man to do them wrong, and to govern us in such wise
that no man find in us any thing worthy of reproof or blame. We learn then
by these words to do well to all men, to hurt no man, and to be a good
example to our neighbors and not offensive unto them. And herein we begin a
blessed life, and to possess the kingdom of heaven, wherein is our abiding:
but those which do the contrary, begin even now their hell. As far as we can
hitherto see, these sayings learn us to fear and serve God, and to agree with
our neighbors, and accomplish our salvation.

4 To give unto the simple sharpnes of wit, and to the child knowledge and
discretion.
After that he has showed whereto these sentences serve, he now declares to
whom they are profitable: and continues furthermore in showing what profit
comes of them. By the simple he understands those, which neither have wit
nor wisdom to govern themselves, nor yet can discern good from evil, to
do the one, and fly the other: and so are easily to be deceived, and may
sooner be persuaded to follow wickedness than righteousness, to choose rather
that which is hurtful unto them, than their profit. We are all of this
nature, if we be left unto ourselves. Adam has well showed it unto us, and not
only Genesis 3.
showed, but also from him, as from a spring has this simplicity flowed into
all mankind. But although it be natural and come by succession, yet if we
persevere therein, we shall not be excusable: but as by it we shall have
followed wickedness and chosen our hurt, even so by it shall we miserably
perish with the wicked. For since that God does teach us by his word, to take
heed from being seduced, in giving us warning of the crafty inventions and
enterprises of Satan, of the deceitfulnes of the world, and the alluring of
our own concupiscences, and offering us his help, favor, and grace: there is
no falt then but in ourselves, that this hurtful simplicity is not taken from
us, and that we have not this sharpness of wit, knowledge and discretion,
which the wise man promises unto the simple, which apply and study his
sayings with all their heart. When he makes such promise, we must understand
that it is not good to be simple, as are those, which S. Paul speaks Romans
16. 18.
of, that suffer themselves to be deceived with false teachers. Yet he means
not that we should forsake simplicity, but so far as it proceeds of our
naughty and corrupt nature, and that through this corruption it is accompanied
either with malice or ignorance, or else with them both. Such simplicity as is
joined with wisdom and knowledge, whereby a man flees all evil with all his
might, is much commendable. Ephe. 4. 18.
Herewithall it behooves us to be beautified, as S. Paul exhorts us. But yet
I would have you wise, unto that which is good; and simple concerning evil.
And, Be not children in understanding, Romans 16. 19
but as concerning maliciousness be children, but in understanding, be of a
ripe age. And the child. Forasmuch as the younger sort are 1. Cor. 14. 20
commonly simple, Solomon joins them together, and promises that if they
give good ear to his Proverbs, they shall obtain knowledge and discretion.
He sets knowledge first: for without it children become stifnecked, following
their fancies, affections and lusts, not regarding what shall happen thereof,
neither commonly are constant: but are now of one opinion, and by and by of an
other: now will they one thing, and immediately after the contray. But when
Solomon spoke of children, promising them knowledge and aduertisment, he had
not respect only to the age, but to the understanding. So, of what age soever
we be, if we be void of all knowledge and discretion, it is very needeful for
us to hear the sentences of the wise man, and all such like doctrine: and
chiefly to be attentive unto the doctrine of the Apostles, Ephe. 4.
and

5 A wise man shall hear and increase in learning: and a man of understanding
shall attain unto wise counsels. 6 To understand a parable, and the
interpretation, the word: of the wise, and their dark sayings.
As the proverbs of Solomon are necessary and profitable to the simple and to
children for their well framing of their hearts, and right directing of their
ways: so are they to the wise, for the increasing of their wisdom and
further knowledge. Whereby it appears that not the simple children ought to be
the scholars and disciples of Solomon, but also the wise. Those then which
count themselves so wise that they think they have no need to learn, and
therefore contemn both preaching and reading of the holy scriptures: not only
are void of wisdom, but also as much as in them is, they make the holy Ghost
a liar, which has spoken by the mouth of Solomon. And that we be not of the
number of such people, let us be continual scholars of our God, and do after
the counsel of S. James. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
which gives to all men liberally, and reprocheth Iam. 1. 5.
no man, and it shall be given him. So doing we shall increase in wisdom and
learning: for to him that has, it shall be given, and he shall abound, and from
him that has not, even that he has, shall be taken away. And a man of
vanderstanding. To the end that we should be more diligent upon doctrine and
never to wax weary of learning to understand more perfectly the truth,
Solomon shows us what profit comes thereof, besides that which he has
declared already in saying, And a man of vanderstanding shall attain unto wise
counsels. As Solomon has not asked worldly riches, neither the pleasures and
desires of the flesh* but has asked wisdom and prudence, to govern both him
and his people: so also he promises not to the man of understanding that he
shall have temporal goods, and that he shall live at ease in this world, but
he promises him wise counsels: the which he expresses by a word that
signifies diligence and sharpnes of wit to govern. Therewith shall those be
endued, which being wise and learned do always pursue more and more to profit
in the knowledge of the truth: for they shall know how to moderate and rule
both themselves and their own affections, and to keep them under that they
do not reign: and also shall be fit and meet to show others the way to do
the like. Here we are taught what the gouerners both of the Church and Common
weal ought to be: to wit, that such should be ordained, which both love the
truth, and are exercised therein. We learn also that after we have heard
and known, we must not be idle, but bring forth fruits. Moreover, Mat. 7.
24.
that without hearing the word of God, no man can be wise, neither profit
himself nor any other, and that they which do not govern themselves after
the word of God, must needs be ignorant and blind, James. 1. 22.
and fall into many vices: that they are not only unprofitable, but also
hurtful to themselves and to their neighbors.

6 To understand. Solomon has already counted unto us many fruits, which they
receive that apply their wits to his sentences: but yet there he sets
forth unto us, four. The first is, that we shall understand the notable and
excellent sentences of those which have spoken by figures and similitudes, to
make them of more authority and estimation, and that men should be more
diligent to search out the meaning of them, and that they might be hid from
them which are blind of understanding, and that seeing, they should not see
etc. The second commodity which they receive, is to interpret and to expound
these notable and excellent sentences to the edifiyng of the Church: that the
rude and ignorant might know so much as is expedient for their salvation. The
third is, to judge and discern the words of the wise, from those of the
foolish, the which oftentimes have a fair show of wisdom and holiness, and
seem at the first sight to please God: albeit they be abominable to him. The
sayings of the wise, as of Moses, of the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and other
holy men be not of any great outward show, and yet for all that be not less
pleasing unto GOD: for though they be uttered by the mouths of men, yet are
they nevertheless the words of God: the which those may judge that give good
ear to the Proverbs of Solomon, and such like doctrine. Many are deceived
through the fair show of men's words, and therefore we must know the word
of God, and not to behold only with other men's eyes: that in no wise we be
deceived with the fair show which properly belongs to false Prophets and
teachers, of whom Jesus Christ commands us to beware. The fourth is, to
understand that which the wise have Math. 7. 1^.
spoken darkly, as when they have spoken of Gods providence, of predestination
and election of Saints, of reprobation and reiection of the wicked, and such
like matters, which are al obscure and dark unto the wicked, who judge all
things to come to pass by chance, albeit they are governed by the counsel
and providence of God. But let us mark, that when Solomon does attribute, all
these fruits to his notable Proverbs, he means not that all they which
become attentive to them, are perfectly partakers of all these fruits. For it
is written. We know in part, and we prophecy in part: But when that which
is perfect 1. Cor. 13. 20.
is come, then that which is in part, shall be abolished. Again, Now we see
through a glass darkely: but then shall we see face to face. Even so these
fruits are the gifts of God, who does distribute them as 1. Cor. 12. 8. Ephe.
4. 11.
seems him good.

7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools have
despised wisdom and instruction.
Because that in the beginning of the tenth Chapter there is written, The
Proverbs of Solomon, as if it were the title of the book: some judge that
that which is written from this place thither, is the preface of the book, the
argument whereof is gone before, to show us wheretoo these do serve, and to
what persons they are profitable. In this preface he uses general
exhortations, he promises, and he threateneth and commands, and makes as
it were an exposition of the ten commandementes, commending unto us the true
wisdom, the fear and service of God, the obedience toward parents, the
labor of the hands, the eschuing of excess, and worthiness of marriage.

7 The fear of the Lord. In the beginning of this preface, he teaches us
the way to attain unto true knowledge. For as the true knowledge wherein we
must glory, is to know God, when being instructed Ier. 9. 24.
in his law, we delight to follow it: even so we must understand that the
fear of the Lord whereof Solomon does speak, is an humility and reverence,
whereby we may tremble at the word of God: not that we should mistrust his
goodness, but diligently to beware from displeasing him, and to endeavor
ourselves to do such things as please him. This is the fear which the angel
does attribute unto Abraham. This is the fear that God requires of his
people. This fear is Genesis 22. 12. Deu. 10. 12. Deu. 4. 10.
of Moses called, wisdom and, understanding. Solomon then has drawn this
from Moses, when he said, The fear of the Lord, etc. It might also be
said, that the fear of the Lord is the chief part of (...): for if in all
our doings we have not this fear, we know (...), we are void of wisdom and
understanding, we are like unto (...), rude, folish and blind beasts. Moses
does show it us, when (...) ^oueth the people of Israel which were without
fear, saying un(...), They have corrupted themselves, etc. The word also
which Deuteronomy, 32. 5.
(...) uses, does signify beginning, and principal part. This fear (...)
both with the love of God, and of his word, as Moses does (...) us in that
place which we alleged even now: likewise in the 29. (...) the 6. the holy
Scripture does often allure us to this fear, to Deuteronomy. 10. 12. and 29. and 6.
(...) that learning to behold our frailty and weakness, we might (...)
ourselves, and lean more strongly to the only mercy of God, (...) submitting
ourselves unto him, with humility and earnest de(...) ^holy to obey him. Such
manner of fear leads us to repentance, (...) does so astonish us, that we
feel how God is angry with us for (...) sins: and albeit this fear does
beat us down in ourselves, yet does it make us certain and assured that God
is merciful unto us. This is the fear which Solomon does here teach us, as
we may Psalm. 51. 19. Esai. 66 2.
understand by the word knowledge: for we have no true knowledge, unless we
know God: and we know him not, unless we do love him, and be assured of
his goodness toward us. This is not then that fear whereof S. John
speaks, There is no fear in love, but perfect 1. Ioh. 4. 18.
love casts out fear. etc. Wherefore the Papists have here no foundation of
their doctrine, or rather of their false opinion, whereby they labor to cause
us to be still in doubt, whether God does love us or not. etc. For if we fear
God, we know him: if we know him, we love him: and if we love him, we are sure
he loves us: for we can not love him 1. Ioh. 4. 1^.
first. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us. etc. If we
know God truly to be such, though there were no hell, we would fear more to
offend him, than to suffer any kind of death. But fools have despised wisdom.
He makes here an Antithesis, co^paring foolishnes with knowledge: and the
disdain of wisdom and instruction, with the fear of the Lord, of whom we
receive all wisdom and instruction: wherein he teaches us who are those
fools of whom he speaks: that is to say, those that are naked and void of
the fear of God, wherein they are holden by wisdom and instruction, without
the which fear they are corrupted and given up to all wickedness, in
forsakyng GOD whose wisdom and instruction they despise. As it is said of
the children of Israel: They have corrupted themselves Ps. 14. 1.
toward him, by their vice. etc. And as David says, The fool has said in
his heart, there is no God, they have corrupted and done an abominable work.
Here we hear that the wisest of the world are reproved of foolishness, and
that rightly: for they trusting and bosting in their wits and understanding,
in their reason and fancy, no^ esteeming heavenly wisdom, neither holy
instructions, whereby they should know God, and be kept in his fear, do give
themselves to human sciences, some to occupations, other some to merchandise,
and some topollitike government: the which things albeit they are good,
because they proceed from God, yet through the folly and malice of men which
regard not to know God, but only their own glory or profit, are so
polluted and corrupted, that they are filthy and abominable before God. And
therefore he threatens by his Prophets to destroy the works of such things.
Furthermore, Solomon does show Esa. 3. 2 and 29. 14.
us that these fools well deserve grievous punishment, seeing they are
accustomed to this contempt, and given up thereto, the which he sigfieth when
he uses the Preterte^ce of a verb, saying: they have despised. Also we may
learn that God is long suffering, when he punishes To. 2. 4.
not the fools immediately: but if they do not return unto him by
repentance, his long tarrying will be surely recompensed. Despisest thou the
riches of his bountifulness, and patience, and long sufferaunce. etc.

8. My Son, hear thy Fathers instruction, and forsake not thy Mothers
teaching. 9 For they shall be a comely ornament unto thine head, and as chains
for thy neck.
Albeit we have never so good doctrine taught us, and that we be advertised of
the vices that are daily committed in the contempt thereof, yet are we not
once moved to follow good doctrine, neither do we mind so much as once to
withdraw us from such vices, though they direct the word of God to our person,
and that by admonitions, and exhortations, by promises, forbiddings and
threatenings they allure us to do well, and labor to withdraw us from evil.
Therefore Solomon desiring to move us to goodness, and to turn us from evil,
after the doctrine and aduertiseme^t of the despising of fools, directs to
us his words, exhorting, promising, forbidding and threatening. The exhortation
is, My son, hear. etc. In this exhortation, to the end he would be heard
with more reverence and fear, he speaks as the father to his child. Here
we may say that Solomon speaks in the person of God, who is the only father
of al; or in the person of the Pastor and teacher Mat. 25.
of the Church, who calls those his children which he instructs and
teaches, because he begets the^ to God, and to his Church through the
word. David uses this manner of speaking likewise does S. Paul and S. John.
Therein they attribute nothing to themselves, neither by any means do
derogate from the fatherhoode of God: for it has pleased God to make them
partakers of this honor, when he does use them as instruments to increase
his Church, and to beget him spiritual children. Wherefore, Solomon does move
us to obey God, who only is our father and instructor, as it has been already
treated of in the 2. verse. And when he calls us to hear, he requires also
obedience, which we must yield, if we will be accepted of God for wise:
otherwise we enter into destruction with the foolish. For the word which
Solomon uses, does not only signify to hear, but also to obey Mat. 7.
and follow. It behooves us then not only to give our outward hearing to this
instruction, but also our hearts, that we understanding how healthful it is
for us, may follow it with true and continual repencance, detesting evil, and
loving good with all our desire. And forsake not. When Solomon adds this, he
gives us well to understand that he does not only allure us to hear, but to
obey. And therewith immediately he answers to a question which might be
made: to wit, How shall we hear God, seeing he is an invisible and
incomprehensible spirit? He gives (I say) the solution, admonishing us not to
forsake the teaching of our mother. As if he did say, if you will hear God to
instruct you, be obedient to the Church, wherein he does beget you, and teach
you by the ministry of his Apostles and Prophets, of his Evangelists,
Pastors and Doctors. Furthermore, we must understand, that God calls al
them his children, which he exhorts by his word, and gives them to his
spouse, which is the Church, to be taught: for the Church is the pillar and
strength of truth: not the popish Church, which does reject the word of God,
and not acknowledge Jesus Christ for head, but Antichrist and the enemy of
God. But forasmuch as we ourselves cannot discern the Church of the wicked
from that of the faithful, we must ask of our heavenly Father, the spirit of
wisdom and discretion, and undoubtedly, he will give it us. For they shall be.
After the exhortation, he puts the promise, by Mat. 7. 9.
a figure and similitude: as if he did say, like as the worldlings delight to
behold a person decked and trimmed with gorgeous attires, and precious jewels
hanged about the head and the neck, which are the parts most seen, because
they are most apparent; and the person so decked is not ashamed to be seen,
but desires to be seen: even so, my son, if thou be truly decked with the
fear of the Lord, and with his knowledge, and do willingly receive his
instruction, and that thou desire gladly to be taught in the congregation of
the faithful, thou shall be acceptable and pleasant before God, and his Angels,
before his elected and faithful, and thou shall not need to doubt to present
thy self before him and his, neither need to fear to be refused of him, no
more than the well beloved, pleasing and acceptable Wife is refused of her
husband, but shall be assured to obtain of him joy and prosperity, and all
felicities in the life everlasting: for he which promises, is true. Wherein we
have first to note, that albeit Solomon does here use a similitude taken of
the manners of the worldlings, yet his meaning is not, that it is lawful for us
outwardly to deck ourselves with sumptuous and precious things, wherewith to
please men: but contrarily we must follow the doctrine of the Apostles. For as
our Savior 1. Tim. 2. 1. Pet. 3. Luke 18. 2.
compares God unto a wicked judge, and yet it is not lawful to say nor think
that God is wicked: even so if Solomon compare the spiritual gifts unto
worldly ornaments; it is not to say, that it should be lawful for us to follow
the custom of the world in outward ornaments. True it is, that the wearing of
gold and precious stones, and other ornaments is not altogether and utterly
forbidden, seeing that it is indifferent: but it is not forbidden, in so much
as all they which deck themselves sumptuously, are almost all led with too
much desire to be seen: and are commonly given to superfluity and excess,
to unshamefastness and immoderatenesse, to ambition and pride. And forasmuch
as women are most spotted with this desire to be seen in gorgeous apparel, S.
Paul and S. Peter direct their words to them. Secondly, because that God
commanding father and mother to be honored, adding thereto a promise, thou
shall live long upon the earth: some, because that this promise, for they
shall be, etc. is placed immediately after the exhortation to hear instruction,
would have the said exhortation taken more simply: to wit for the commandment
to obey unto carnal fathers, unto whose charge the government of their children
is committed, and that the children learn to be obedient to their parents, and
should not think that they are able to rule themselves. There are two reasons
that cause me to dissent from this opinion. The first is, that in this same
preface, the 6. chapter, he gives commandment to obey father and mother: the
second is, that after he has admonished and advertised us of the fear of the
Lord, and of his knowledge, by this exhortation, he shows to us by what
means we may attain thereto, and be kept therein: to wit, by hearing and
obeying.

10 My Son, if sinners do entice thee, consent thou not. 11 If they say, Come
with us, we will lay wait for blood, and lie privily for the innocent without
a cause: 12 We will swallow them up alive like a grave even whole, as those
that go down to the pit: 13 We shall find all precious riches, and fill our
houses with spoil: 14 Cast in thy lot among us: we will all have one purse. 15
My son, walk not thou in the way with them: refrain thy foot from their
path. 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 17
Certainly as without cause the net is spread before the eyes of all that has
wyng: 18 So they lay wait for blood and lie privily for their lives. 19 Such
are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain: he would take away the life
of the owners thereof.
After the promise, for our better advice, and to show us how we should not
despise wisdom and instruction, he gives us a prohibition, wherein he shows a
great fatherly care, saying: My son, if sinners etc. Albeit that of our vicious
and corrupted nature through the sin of Adam, we al are sinners: yet God of his
grace and mercy does not impute to his elected and faithful (which are his
children) their sins: and therefore the scripture does not call them
sinners, but holy and Romans 1. and 1. Ephe. 4. 1. Pe. 4.
righteous. Those are sinners of whom it is spoken, Such were they which
perished by the floude, as may be seen in Genesis, and so were they of Sodom.
Our Savior means both the one and the other, Gene. 13.
saying, they did eat and drink. etc. Solomon would not have us to consent to
the persuasions of such kind of men, whereby they labor Luke. 17. 27.
to draw us to do as they do, and to make us their like and companions. It is
not then without cause why he gives us such a prohibition: as we shall see
hereafter, and may also see the same. 2. Pet. 2.


11 If they say. He begins to discover their perswasio^s together with their
wicked and pernicious doing: and herein he shows what these sinners are, to
who^ he would not have us to consent. The beginning of their perswasio^s is,
that is to say, Come with us. As if they said, we are the greater number,
whereupon it is to be thought that we are both the strongest and the wisest: if
thou will then be well accompanied, forsake the other (which are but as an
handful in comparision of us) and join with us. This same is a great
temptation, whereby the vnsted fast are easily shaken. Wherefore we have great
need to beware of such temptation: for naturally we desire to follow the
greatest number, and think that if we be on that side, we cannot perish. But
the holy Ghost teaches us the contrary both by examples and admonitions. Noe
was not drowned by the waters of the flood: Lot perished not in the overthrow
of Sodom: Joshua and Caleb died not in the desert. It is also written, Thou
shall not follow a multitude to Exodus 23. 2. Mat. 7. 13.
evil. Again, Enter in at the straight gate: for it is the wide gate and
broad way that leads to destruction: and many there be that go in thereat.
The multitude is one of the arguments which the Papists lay against us, to
show that we are in the way of perdition: but if the multitude be the best, it
follows that the Turks and Panims are honester than the Papists: for they
are the greater number. Albeit then that the Papists be more than we in number,
and that we are but a little handful, let not that move us to follow them. For
if we should regard to rule our life after the multitude, we should follow the
Infidels and Idolaters. For as we are but a few in comparison of the Papists,
so they are nothing in comparison of the Turks and other Heathen. Now to go
forth with the words of Solomon, we must note, (when he says the sinners do
say) We will lay wait etc. He more expresses the deliberation of their
hearts and desires, and likewise their wicked and perverse manner of doing, than
their own words: for there is none so wicked but thinks, and counts
himself to be an honest man. And none will beast himself to be a murderer and
shedder of innocent blood, to get himself companions, but rather would swear
for himself to be their protector and defender. But it may be demanded,
wherefore they say, We will lay wait. It is for that they are led with great
desire to be rich, to be chief and to bear rule: and to obtain the same,
they do outrage and violence to the innocent, that is to say, to those which
have not deserved of them to be so evil entreated: and yet they would, and
also be esteemed to do well, and that they pursue nothing but their right, or
at the least that they are not bound to do better: and also to hide their
cruelty, they will lay false crimes unto their charge, whom wrongfully and
without cause they pursue. Now they which are familiarly conversant with them,
and are given to their particular profit, are easily drawn to exercise such
inhumanitie and cruelty, the which is reputed before God for murder and
mansslaughter: because it is no thank to them that they shed not innocent blood.

Solomon does well signify the same, when he says, in their persons, We will
lay wait, etc. This cruelty is exercised in every estate, when they seek to
profit themselves with the hurt of other men. And it is not only used over
our temporal goods, and bodies: but more wickedly Esai. 1. 59. 1. Ioh. 3.
the belly gods buie and sell men's souls and lead them to the slaughter.

12 We will swallowe them up. He continues here to express the insatiable
greediness and cruel deliberation of sinners, whereby they purpose in no wise
to spare the innocent, but vterly to destroy them, and root out their memory
from among the living: to the end that without let and resistance they might
accomplish their desires. This same affection of the wicked was well described
by David. Psalm. 10. 13.


13 We shall find all precious riches. Here Solomon sets forth the great
desire of sinners to be rich, to be aloft, and to live in wealth and abundance,
and to rule: for having great riches, they will be esteemed, credited, and will
oppress all men: otherwise they would think they should not long possess
their great substance and pray, nor continue in good reputation.

14 Cast in thy lot among us. They desire to have many to do as they do, and
delight to have many like unto themselves: judging that thereby they shall not
be rebuked nor reproved for their inhumanitie and cruelty, but that rather
they shall be loved and honored, and be had in good estimation: and that by
such devilish unity and conformity the goods which they have violently
gotten, and possess unjustly, shall be safe, and that they quietly shall enjoy
them. These desires and judgments are expressed unto us by these words, Cast
thy lotte etc. It is not the common use of sinners thus to speak one to
another: for their custom is, to lay every man for his own profit, not
passing for their fellows: yea, they are of such nature, that every of them
would have all to himself, and the other to have nothing but at their
gentleness. The purse then of sinners is said to be one: not that they be united
in true love, as are the faithful, as it is spoken of in the Acts: Act. 2. 44.
But because they pretend all one wickedness, and are all led of one evil
spirit to do wrong and violence to those who never deserved it at their
hands, so that their unity tends to no other end but to be more strong.

15 My Son walk not in the way with them. The ways and paths of sinners
are their evil thoughts and cogitations, their inordinate affections and
lusts, their wicked manners and perverse doings, their in humanity and
cruelty: to be short, all the means they do imagine and follow to do hurt. The
wise man here warns the children of God to cast away from them al such
wickedness, and to flee them. And so, albeit the tares must be left among the
wheat, notwithstanding the wheat must not become tares* for although that the
children of God be in this world mingled among the wicked, and cannot seperat
themselves from them, unless they should go forth of the world (as S Paul
says) yet must they not communicate with them in evil, least they be 1. Cor.
5. 10.
also wrapped up in their perdition.

16 For their feet run to evil. He gives us a reason wherefore we must not
consent unto sinners, neither walk in the way with them: for their way is a
bloody way. They desire nothing more than the destruction and perdition of the
innocent, that they might gain something, whereof they are so desirous and
covetous, that they employ thereto al their force and might, al their credit
and authority, even not letting to put their neighbors to death, if they
think they cannot otherwise bring their purpose to pass: the execution
whereof Solomon compares to a speedy course: for to show how sinners think
they shall never come timely enough to possess that which they would have.
Solomon uses in his speech ij. verbes, which signify the time to come,
although they be used both for the present time, and also to signify what is
accustomed to be done. And so he signifies that they are so given to
wickedness, that they list not to forbear it. Albeit that at the first show
this reason seems to touch them which desire to have war, not caring
whether it be just or unjust, but is enough for them that they enrich
themselves with the booties and spoils taken from the dead in battle: this
same nevertheless ought not to be restrained to the corporal shedding of
blood, but also to every violence, wrong, and cruelty, which is exercised as
well upon the goods and bodies, as upon the souls of men. Wherefore therein
we will comprehend al robbers and thieves, usurers and covetous persons,
sellers of false wares, murderers and persecutors of innocents, and chiefly
of the faithful, Hypocrites, Idolaters and superstitious, false Prophets and
lying Doctors.

17 Certainly as without cause. Of the aforesaid deliberations of sinners,
Solomon has gathered a reason wherefore no man ought to consent unto them,
neither walk with them, etc. for their feet run. etc. And to the end he
might the better turn away the children of God from running after the^, he
shows how the sinners do great wrong, when he likeneth those whom they
persecute, to birds. As if he said, for as much as you are Gods children, who
is just and righteous, gentle and merciful: you should wish to do wrong to
no man, neither use your neighbors cruelty, and chiefly the innocent.
Wherefore you ought not to walk with the sinners which persecute the innocent:
for as the birds have not deserved of the fouler too be taken with nets,
and to be eaten: even so the innocents have not deserved to be pilled,
tormented and murdered: yet are they a pray unto the wicked and ungodly. By
this similitude Solomon declares plainly enough, that he reproves not Judges
and Magistrates which diligently search out the wicked, and are careful to
punish them grievously, that they might (as much as in them lies) Romans 13. 4.
purge the world of them. For as they bear the swoorde to take vengeance on
him that does evil: so the wicked resemble not unto birds, but unto wild
and cruel beasts, and therefore they deserve to be watched, to be taken, and
to have their blood shed. As touching the rest, forasmuch as God says unto
Noe and to his children, Every thing that moves and lives, shall be meat for
Genesis 9. 3.
you, etc. We ought to understand that it is lawful for us to use birds to
take them, to kill them, and to make them serve to our use, although they have
not deserved it. They are created for us, as al other creatures are: therefore
we may use them with thanks giving, etc. We shall follow this doctrine, if in
our meats we be sober and temperate, and that we use them for necessity
sake, and 1. Tim. 1. 3.
not to fill our bellies like beasts, without acknowledging the Lord who gives
them. And yet we must think that if God has given over birds for a pray
which have not offended him, that we which are rebels to him, do much more
deserve to be given over to the will of the wicked, and ungodly. For albeit we
are innocent in respect of them, and that they do wickedly in persecuting us,
not having so deserved of them: nevertheless before the judgment of God we
are not innocent. And therefore if he deliver us to the will of sinners, we have
no cause to complain of him, but must confess that justly he does punish us,
and that the wicked only are his instruments to execute the same.

19 Such are the ways. The world does greatly allow those which can profit
themselves, and gather much goods. Contrarily, those which are not cunning to
gain something, are disdained, and reputed Idiots, the which is a great
temptation unto the simple and indiscreet, to lead them to covetousness, that
they might be reputed and esteemed among men: not considering in the mean
while, into what gulf of wickedness they do fall, if greedily they follow
gain. From the which gulf, Solomon being desirous to withdraw us, and to
make us detest, and abhor the great toil of greediness to follow gain,
declares here unto us, that the covetous have the deliberations, affections,
enterprises and executions before mentioned, and that when he says, Such are
the ways, etc. As if he did say Forasmch as you would not lay wait for
innocent blood, and that the covetous have such ways, that they conspire
against the lives of them, and that rather than they would want of their
enterprise, do take away the life of innocents, and murder those which
possess the goods that they desire: ye must flee covetousness, and choose
rather to be poor, than to desire abundance of riches, seeing you would not
be counted murderers before God and his Angels. I say expressly before God and
his Angels: for the most covetous are not esteemed before the world for
murderers and mansleaers, but men of honesty and good reputation. And also when
Solomon says how they would take away the life of the owners thereof, he
means not that always they kill those which possess the goods that they
would have: but that by subtilties and guile, by wicked bargaining and
unlawful means, by force and extortion, they spoil their neighbors and undo
them: and no thank to them that their neighbors die not, when they take away
from them that wherewith their life should be sustained. For if they cannot
come to execute the end of their desire, they make debates, strifes and
dissentions, hatredes, privy malice, and desire of vengeance: and if they
could or durst, they would murder their neighbors indeed. And forasmuch as
God is a spirit, and that he has made a law not only to govern the outward
works, but also the affections of the heart, as it is showed in Deuteronomy. And now
Israel, what does the Lord thy God require Deuteronomy. 10. 12.
of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to
love, and to serve the Lord thy GOD with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul? Again, verse. 16. Circumcise therefore the forskin of your heart, etc.
Since they have an evil affection against their neighbors, it follows that
Mat. 5.
they sin against the commandment, Thou shall not kill: as Jesus Christ does
expound it himself. And so before God they are murderers, although before the
world they be counted men of good reputation, because they handle their
matters handsomely: and also good stout men, because they leese nothing that
may be gotten.

We learn also in this place, that it is a very dangerous thing, to covet the
riches of this world: seeing that they which would be rich, are not much better
than murderers: and we know that every murderer has not everlasting life
abiding in him. To the 1. John. 3. 15.
end then that we be no murderers, but that we may obtain everlasting life,
let us rather chose poverty or mean estate, following that which is said.
Let your conversation be without covetousness Heb. 13. 5.
So doing we shall win much, as the Scripture witnesses. Make you friends with
the riches of iniquity. But godliness Luke. 16. 9.
is great gain, if a man be content with that he has. The example of Lazarus
serves also to the proof hereof. Notwithstanding 1. Tim. 6. 6.
he means not that al rich men are murderers, either that they ought to
forsake their riches, if they will be saved. The Patriarchs were rich, and are
in the kingdom of heaven: they have not Luke. 16. 17.
coueted to be rich, and having riches, they did not set their heart upon them,
but did distribute the^ where need was, not putting their trust in them. After
whose example they that are rich in this world, must not be highminded,
neither put their trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God,
etc.

20 Wisdom cries without, she utters her voice in the streets. 21 She
calls in the high street among the prease in the entringes of the gates, and
utters her words in the City, saying: 22 O ye foolish, how long will ye
love foolishness? and the scornful take their pleasure in scorning; and the
fools hate knowledge?
To the end that we should hear instruction, and that thereby we might learn
not to consent unto sinners. etc. And that we should not pretend cause of
ignorance, if we walk with them in their ways, God from the beginning of the
world has taught us, does teach us, and will teach us, so long as the world
shall endure. Solomon does signify it by saying, Wisdom cries without etc.
For in his speech he uses here the Verb, which is put not only to signify
that which is done presently and in the future time, but also that which is
customably used to be done. For wisdom was never idle: but as God has
thereby created al things, even so by it does he govern, and shall govern
all things. O Lord how manifold are thy Psalm. 104.
works? in wisdom have thou made them al. The word of GOD is this wisdom.
Who instructed Abell to put his trust in God, and to offer unto him Sacrifice?
Who taught the Generation John. 1. Heb. 11. 4. Genesis 4. 4.
of Seth to call upon the name of the Lord their God: but only the wisdom
of GOD? Likewise it must be said of all the Patriarchs, Judges, Kings and
Prophets, that they themselves were taught, and also did teach others by this
same wisdom. Also by it have the Apostles and Disciples been instructed, and
have been taught. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, where against all your
adversaries shall not be able to speak nor resist. Luke 21. 15.
And that we should always be instructed by this wisdom: He himself has
made some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, Ephe. 4. 11.
some Pastors and Doctors. Let us note hereupon that the Ministers of Gods
Church ought not to be like unto the Pope, neither to his horned bishops, nor
others of their sects: of whom it may be said, al their watchmen are blind,
they know nothing, they are all dumb dogs. etc. But as the Evangelical
word is Es. 5. 6. 10.
committed unto them, to be heard through all the world of all creatures: even
so must they cry aloud to waken the sluggards, and to make such as would be
deaf, inexcusable: they must labor also to profit many, as Solomon does
well note it, saying, they must cry without in the streates. etc. Likewise our
Lord does teach us very well, What I tell you in darkness, that Mat. 10.
27.
speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye on the
house, In all estates also ought this wisdom to cry, both by words of
edification, by good counsel, and by holy conversation. etc.

22 O ye foolish. Wisdom cries after three kinds of people, which occupy the
world: to wit, the folish, the scornful and fools. The foolish, are such as be
indiscreet, and therefore easily to be deceived, and also to be taken with
that which seems fair to the eyes, and to follow that which seems good to
the understanding of the flesh. Look what such folks love, is but
foolishness, although the wisest of the world praise it and esteem it. Also
God has made the wisdom of this world foolishnes. The 1. Cor. 1. 20.
scornful, are such as have their heart so swelled with pride and
presumption, their mind so malicious and wicked, that they can not suffer to
be taught any thing, neither to be rebuked nor reprehended for their fault: but
scorn at all discipline and correction, and in this scornefulnesse take their
pleasure and delight: as Solomon does signify the same when he says, The
scornful take their pleasure in scorning, The Pharisees show themselves to
Luke 16. Esai. 28. 2. Pet. 3.
be such. There are also such now. The fools are much like unto the
foolish: they are also of the manners and fashions of the scorners: for they
hate knowledge which is contrary to foolishness and scorning: for he that
delights in the knowledge of God and his word, which is the true knowledge,
sets naught by that which pleases the flesh, and suffers to be taught
more and more, and receives with humblenes al discipline and correction, to
mortify thereby the flesh: which the fools do not, but hate that wherewith
the flesh is not delighted, and do persecute those both by word and deed,
which labor to instruct them. Such was S. Paul before his conversion. Such
are Idolaters, of whom the world is full: for among ten millions, scarce
may one be found which is not either foolish, either scorning, either a
fool, or which has them not altogether. The Ministers then of the word will
chalendge nothing to themselves; but knowing it is God which works by his
wisdom, will do their Ministry in fear and trembling, without promising
any thing of themselves: and will confess the great and inestimable goodness
of God, which he has used and does use toward the world, when he disdained
not, neither yet does disdain to abase himself so low, as to warn the
foolish, scornful and fools by his wisdom: the which notwithstanding is in
such wise outraged, that it is thought foolishness. For, Saint Paul says,
The preaching of the Cross is to them which do perish, foolishness. 1. Cor.
1. 8.


23 Turn you at my correction: lo, I will pour out my mind unto you, and
make you understand my words.
When wisdom cries after the foolish, scorneful, and fools, she first
accuses, reprooueth, and corrects them, without condemning them, and making
them despair: for she rather labors to cause them to amend by repentance
and faith. She says not, because ye love foolishness, scornefulnesse and
folly, you are undone, ye are lost for ever: but she sweetly entreats them,
saying: Turn you, etc. As if she did say, when I reprove and ^orrecte you,
when I show you your foolishness, scornefulnesse and hatred against the true
knowledge, harden not your hearts at my correction, but suffer yourselues to
be taught of it, forsaking your wicked way, and your unrighteous thoughts,
through which you have been turned from the Lord: and come again to seek the
Lord, while he may be found: and call upon him while he is nigh: the which
you shall do, if you hate that which you love and would have, and if you love
and desire that which you hate. Now to the end that your heart may thus
return at my correction, I will pour out my spirit as it were a spring Esai.
11. 2. Ioh. 14. 16.
upon you, which is the spirit of Wisdom, etc. Who is the comforter, The
Spirit of truth, which instructs al things, and leads into al truth. By
it will I make you understand, that that which I command, is righteous; that I
chide not rashly and without aduisement; that I threaten not wrongfully: and by
himself will I witness to you of the certainty and truth of my promises. Now
Solomon shows well here, that he is not only a teacher of the law, but also
of the Gospel: for he is not contented to reprove vices, to command and to
forbid, which is the office of the law: but (as our Lord says) with
repentance has added says, Repent and believe the Gospel: and has
commanded Mar. 1. 15. Luke 24. 47.
his Apostles to do the like. Even so Solomon with repentance joins faith,
when he promises the holy Ghost and the understanding of the words of God,
which are the infallible truth. For faith is a certain knowledge and
assurance that God loves us, that he is our Father, and our Savior through
Christ, as the holy Ghost witnesses unto the faithful by the preaching of
the Gospel, which he printeth in their hearts, sanctifiyng and regenerating
them. As touching the rest, when we are corrected to convert, there is nothing
offered which pleases the flesh, the sensual man nor old Adam, for it is
high and proud, and can abide no correction. The whole world is naturally
infected and corrupted with such vices, as pride and impatience: and therefore
it is no marvel though there be so many incorrigible people: unto whom we
must not be like. For neither the corrupted nature of our flesh and
sensuality, nor yet the multitude shall excuse us, and deliver us from
perdition, if we followyng them, convert not when we are corrected in the name
of God, and by the doctrine of the holy scripture, the which is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct. etc.
Furthermore (when calling us to repentance, God promises us 2. Tim. 3. 16.
his holy spirit) we must understand that repentance is not a work of
man, but of God, who regenerateth us, and renueth us by his holy spirit: as
appears by the witness of Ezechiel. A new heart also will I give you, and a
new spirit will I put within you. etc: and consequently, it is not of our free
will that we repent, Eze. 36. 26.
but of the only mercy of God, which will not the death of a sinner. The which
also Jeremy confesses, saying, O Lord, I know Eze. 33. Ier. 10. 23. Ier. 31.
18.
that the way of man is not in himself: and therefore he prays on this wise,
Convert thou me, and I shall be converted. Moreover we learn here that the
words of God are hidden from us, if the holy Ghost be not given us to instruct
and sanctify us. We must then pray with David, Create in me a clean heart, O
God, and Psalm. 51. 12.
renew a right spirit within me. Finally since that in bidding us repent, God
promises us the knowledge of his words, we may perceive who are the true
repentants, and who not: and likewise that they which make no account to
repent, understand not the words of God, though they say what they list.

24 Because I have called, and ye refused: I have stretched out mine hand, and
none would regard: 25 But ye have despised all my counsel, and would none of my
correction: 26 I will also laugh at your destruction, and mock, when your fear
comes. 27 When your fear comes like sudden desolation, and your
destruction shall come like a whirlewind: when affliction and anguish shall come
upon you: 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer: they shall
seek me early, but they shall not find me.
After Wisdom has willed the foolish, the scorners and fools to repent, and
beholding the greatest part, yea almost al incorrigible and obstinate and
hardened more and more, she makes complaint against the^ and threateneth the^.
She complains of that that by her servants the Patriarchs and Prophets
she has cried and does cry upon the foolish, to have them return to
repentance, presenting them her spirit, and through the understanding of her
words: and that yet they refuse to repent, to receive the holy Ghost, and to
apply their wits to her words.

25. But ye have despised. In continuing still her complaint, she shows how
far the ministers of the word ought to reach with their cry, and whereto
their cry should serve: that is, to counsel and correct, that the world being
warned by good counsel and holy sermons of the word of God, might amend. But
the foolish will in no wise taste of his counsel, but so much as they can,
despise it and regard it not, and will not have the hand of God and of his
wisdom to be offered to them by correction and fatherly chastisement: but as
dull horses winch against the spur, so do they despite and murmr against
God and his ministers, hating and persecuting them to kill and destroy them, if
it were possible for them. Now let us here first of all note, that wisdoms
hand is the hand of God, seeing that he is never without this wisdom, and
that they both be but one. This hand is taken in diverse sorts: to wit, for the
power, goodness, help, favor, work, act, punishment, chastisement,
vengeance and correction of God. For in as much as God is a spirit, we must
understand that he has neither arms nor hands, that can be either touched
or seen: but the holy Ghost to accommodate himself to our rudeness, does
attribute unto God those things which properly and naturally appertain unto
us. This hand does stretch it self forth after diverse manners: to wit, in
sustayning and keeping, in guiding and governing, in overthrowing and
destroying, in correcting and chastening. But to exercise this hand, he has
many instruments the which he sets on work as seems good to him. Now
when this hand is attributed here to wisdom, with the stretching out
thereof, and that the ministers of the word ought above all other to use
wisdom, we will take the stretched out hand, chiefly for the correction and
chastisement which is done in the church by the word of God. Solomon also
does give it well to understand, after he has made his complaint, that none
would regard this stretched out hand: he adds, that they would none of his
correction. When wisdom makes her complaint for that they have despised her
counsel, we must understand, that the counsels of God, are as much as
commandementes, and that it is very necessary for us to obey them: if it were
otherwise, wisdom would not make such complaint against the despisers of her
counsel. Wherefore, what though that commandment to love our enemies were a
counsel? yet should the opinion of the Papists be false, Mat. 5. 44.
whereby they hold that we are nothing at all bound to obey it, and that it
is made for them which be in the state of perfection. Wherein they fail two
manner of ways. First, in that they do not give so much honor to GOD as they
give unto an earthly Prince, of whom it is commonly said that his prayer is
as much as a commandment: Then, that they place the most wicked in the state
of perfection, the which can not be in this world. But if we will not have
wisdom to complain of us, we must consider the goodness of God, which does
not punish our malice so soon, as we deserve it, but of his only mercy he
calls us by his word both outwardly and inwardly, and does so continue,
albeeit we regard it not: he stretched out his hand to correct and to chasten
like a good father, for to withdraw us from the gallows, from death and
damnation, and yet we will not know it. This being thus considered, we must
ask of God: that it may please him not to cease to counsel us by his
wisdom, and that we may draw near to profit by that counsel: and that
when he corrects us, be it by words or by affliction, that we may receive
al at his hand willingly. And the better to do the same, we must not be
grieved to hear wisdom cry, though it be yrkesome to our flesh.

26 I will also laugh, After that wisdom has complained of the hardness of
the foolish, scorners and fools, and of their unrepentant hearts, she
threatens to laugh at them, and mock them, when the destruction they fear,
shall light on their heads. It may well be thought that the wicked and obstinate
fear nothing, because they are seen to be most strong and most in number,
and that they very often bring their purpose about, and also that they live at
their case, possessing much temporal riches, for the which they are in
reputation and esteemed: notwithstanding their evil consciences do often
reprove them: whereby they feel themselves gilty, and are afraid of the
judgment of God. They fear most of al eternal death, which is their last
destruction. And therefore there can never so little trouble come upon them in
this world, but that they are greatly adread and afraid. It is the
destruction and fear, whereat wisdom will laugh and mock. But for so much as
derision and mockage are the deeds of dissolute and riotous persons, here
might be asked whether it be a fit and meet thing for the wisdom of God to
deride and mock, and whether it be lawful for to attribute unto him any such
things. Answer, that wisdom does not laugh and mock after the manner of men,
neither is it lawful for us to attribute unto him such derision and mockery:
for it were to make him like unto the most wicked ympes of the world: but the
holy Scripture accommodating it self to our rudeness, and willing to express
what wisdom shall be and seem unto the understanding and opinion of the hard
hearted and obstinate, does attribute unto her mockery and derision.

27 When your fear. The derision then and mockery of God and his wisdom, is to
fear and suddenly to abash the wicked when they look not for it, to overthrow
and destroy them in her anger and wrath, without having any pity of them, for
all their weepings and cryings, and for all their diligence to seek remedy.

The like mockery is expressed in the 2. Psalm. Where the Prophet showing how
God can confute the pride and vain enterprises of men rising up against him
and his Christ, says: But he that dwells in the Heaven shall laugh: the
Lord shall have them in derision. And we must not think that the Psalmist and
the wise man only threaten the wicked of their time which submitted not
themselves under the yoke of God by repentance: But as the promises of
salvation appertain to al faithful, in what time soever they be: even so the
threatenings are made for the wicked of all ages unto the end. Saint Paul
does well show Romans 2. 5.
it saying. But thou after thine hardenesse, and heart that cannot repent,
heapest unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, etc. Let us then return
to repentance, that we be not overtaken, and when we shall say, peace and
safety, then sudden death come upon us. If we thus do, God will not deride
nor mock us, in fearing 1. These. 5. 3.
and destroying us: for fear and destruction appertain not unto us, they
properly belong unto the fools and mockers, to the obstinate and hardened: as
Solomon does show them, when he says to them, your destruction, your fear.
And that there is no remedy left for the obstinate and reprobate, which refuse
the wisdom of God, who is the only remedy, Solomon shows it, when he
compares their fear unto desolation, and their destruction unto a
whirlewinde. In desolation all is wasted and destroyed, and the whirlewinde
consumes and kills that which it meets: but this desolation and whirlewind
does not destroy and kill the obstinate, so that afterward they become stones
and blocks, or like brute beasts, when they are killed. For being once smitten
and beaten down, they shall be afflicted forever: so desolatio^ and storm will
never forsake them, as Solomon does well signify it, saying: When affliction
and anguish shall come upon you. Then shall they call upon me. If they be not
heard, they cannot be delivered. This everlasting anguishe is showed us, when
our Lord Mark. 9. 44.
says, that in the hell fire their worm dies not, and the fire never goes
out. For we have said expressly, that eternal death is the last destruction, to
declare that the obstinate people are not exempted from destruction in this
present life, but whiles they be in it, they begin their hell and damnation,
and that even here they are forsaken of God, as he does make them to feel.
Caine, Saul Genesis 4. 1. Sam. 28. Mat. 27.
and Judas have witnessed the same. Solomon does also well show it when he
says, That they shall call, etc.

28 By calling and early seeking. He shows they are in great care and
grief, for the evil they feel and fear to come upon them. By not to
answering, nor to be found, he declares how God regards them not, and has
cast them up for ever. It may be said, that if God does answer the wicked
after their deceasse, that by a far stronger reason he will answer them in
this Luke. 19. Luke. 16. 25. Mat. 25. 41.
life, God does aunsweare by Abraham, the rich man lying in hell. Our Lord
also does answer the goats. Answer, that after the mind of Solomon these
here have not received answer: for they have an hard and sharp answer,
such as a man would make to his enemy, resisting him to the face, as it is
said, and putting him besides his intent and enterprise, even such as the
Judge makes to the thief when he pronounces his sentence, sending him to
the gallows. But Solomon speaks here of a soft and favorable answer:
such as a man does make unto his friend, granting him that which he asks.
He says that God denies such answer to the fools and scorners which are
obstinate and hardened, and hydeth himself from the^, and will in no wise help
them: the which Solomon does signify by saying, they shall not find me. But
it may be said again, that Solomon seems not here to speak with the same
spirit that David his father did, Call upon me in the time of trouble: Psalm.
50. 15.
so will I deliver thee, etc. Answer, that David does speak of those
sinners, which are not hardened in their wickedness, but with all their heart
do truly turn, and seek the Lord. Such persons Deuteronomy. 4. 29. Psalm. 145. 18
Ezec. 33. 16.
are promised to be heard. But Solomon speaks of them which make no account
to repent, and harden their hearts more and more against all holy admonitions
and corrections. Such persons are not heard, neither feel God to favor them:
for they call not upon him, neither seek him for the love they bear him, nor
for the hatred and unpleasantness that they have of their sin, but because
they are afraid of Gods judgment, and that they feel their destruction.
Here will be asked, how such fools and scorners call and seek God, seeing
they neither love him, nor put their trust in him. Answer, how Solomon
speaks here, either after the estimation and opinion of the fools and
scorners, or according as they would appear to do: for to say the truth,
they never call upon God, neither seek him, nor cannot, because they have
refused al his counsel and correction, they know him not. How shall they call
upon him in whom they have not believed? Also, to call well upon God and seek
him, Romans 10. 14. Luke. 18. 10 1. These. 5. 17 Esa. 55. 6.
we must not cease nor be weary. Seek the Lord while he may be found,
call upon him while he is nigh. For as we are always in necessity, so have
we always need to pray unto GOD, to help us with his grace and mercy. For
this ^ause also our Lord Jesus Christ has a perpetual Priesthood. Heb. 7. 2^.
The fools and scorners, obstinate and indurate feel not their necessity,
unless they be sore pressed with fear, and be in great affliction and
anguish: they think they have no need of God, but when they look to perish.
And therefore til they think to be destroyed, they neither call upon God, nor
seek him: as Solomon does well show it, saying, Then shall they call upon me,
etc. They would not cry, unless they were constrained by intolerable evils,
and chiefly for fear of Gods sharp judgment, and of eternal death and
damnation. If then we would have God to answer us, let us not tarry til we
can no longer, but let us turn unto him with all our heart, and he will receive
us to mercy.

29 Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord. 30
They would none of my counsel, but despised all my correction. 31 Therefore shall
they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own
devises.
By the complaint that wisdom has heretofore made of the idiots, scorners
and fools, she has showed that there was sufficient cause to threaten them
sharply with the judgment of God. Notwithstanding as though they had not
understand this complaint, and as though they allege that wrongfully and
without cause they are threatened, after this sort, wisdom repeateth her
complaint, showing them that they have well deserved so to be threatened, and
also to be forsaken of God. She says then, Because they hated knowledge, etc.
It is the wont of Idiots, scorners, and fools, so to despise the preaching
made to them in the name of God, that they seem not to understand them, as
though they were not spoken unto: and therefore when for their contempt they are
threatened with the judgment and vengeance of God, they magnify themselves,
saying they are honest men, although they be stark naught: and persuade
themselves to be threatened very wrongfully, and as though they had not heard
wherein they have failed and do fail, they ask wherefore they are so
threatened. Wherefore, to make them more inexcusable, their faults are told them
again, but as it is said, they are therefore more inexcusable. For that they
ask the cause why they are threatened, is not for to endeavor for to amend
their life: but rather that they may justify themselves, and give to
understand that they should not be touched. Besides this we must note, that
repetitions are used in the holy scripture, the which albeeit they are esteemed
superfluous and vain, and be troublesome, yet are they profitable, yea
necessary, because of our rudeness and flownesse, the better to inculcate and
make that which has already been told us to enter into our understandings,
or that we may not pretend cause of ignorance, if we despise what has been
taught us. And among repetitions, those are most profitable, which serve for
exposition of that which has been before said: as is this same, whereby
wisdom shows whereto she tends with her cry: to wit, that men should not
dwell in ignorance, neither be without understanding, like brute beasts: but
keep knowledge and understanding in the law and doctrine of the Lord, whereby
they are kept in the service and obedience of God in all humbleness and
reverence, following true religion. Wherein she labors in vain toward the
Idiots, scorners and fools, which are obstinate and indurate: for so much it
wants that they will profit thereby, that not only they refuse the knowledge
and fear of the Lord, but, which worse is, they hate it, and persecute it, as
it is declared in this repetition. But if we would not have such complaint
repeated against us, we must by and by after we are once showed our faults
in the name of GOD, and by his word, obey admonitions and warning, loving to
be instructed, that we might know how to walk in the fear of the Lord. As
touching the rest, sermons are not only made for them which hear very well,
and are easy to be taught, but also for the deaf, and them which would seem
not to understand what is told them. We must judge that such people have
great need to have one thing often told them, otherwise we might think that
in the wrytings of Moses, of David, of the Prophets, Apostles, and
Evangelists, there are many vain and superfluous things: for they do greatly
use repetitions, and say one thing in diverse words. And also, although we
think we have no need of repetitions, and that we ought not to use them, yet
if we mark them when they are directed unto the indurate and obstinate, they
will greatly edify us. For, first of all we understand, that if God has such
care to reduce the obstinate into the right way: by a more strong reason he
will not suffer those which are easy to be taught, to forsake the right path:
but will have care to lighten them by his word, that they continually might
follow it, not declyning on the right hand, nor on the left. Secondly, we
shall not desire to follow the indurate, seeing them so often reproved, and
be threatened so sharply: but shall be moved to grow more and more in true
knowledge, whereby we may be kept still in the fear of the Lord.

31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, etc. As the
heavenly wisdom is not contented once to have complained of the Idiots,
scorners and fools, but has repeated her complaint: so now she makes again
the like threatening as before, but in other words. For that which she has
called fear, she calls eating: and that which she called destruction, she
calls to be filled. Wherein we may see she speaks Ironice, in mocking the
scorners, as they deserve so to be. And by so speaking she has respect to
their enterprises and counsels, which were opened unto us, when he said (verse.
12. and 13.) we will swallow them up. etc. Now mocking their enterprises, she
says, Therefore shall they eat of the fruit, etc. As if she did say, even as
all the labor of man is for his mouth: and that there is no profit to man, but
that he eat and drink, etc. since these persons have labored both Eccles. 6.
7. Eccles. 2. 24.
with body and spirit, it is not reason they should lose their pains, but be
recompensed for their travail, and receive the revenue: otherwise they should
suffer wrong. For it is said, Who goes on warfare any time at his own cost?
Wherefore, as they have invented 1. Cor. 9. 7.
mischief for the innocent, and taken great pains to destroy and kill them,
not only in body, but also in soul, by offending the^ for contemning of my
counsel and correction, for hating of knowledge, and refusing the fear of God:
even so to recompense them for their labor, I will cause mischief to light upon
them: that is to say, the fruit of their thoughts. To lay trappes for the
innocent, they have dug and graued pittes: but to drink their fill, they
shall fall into the ditch they have made: and that they may have more than they
can desire, and spewe up again, their wickedness shall return upon their
heads, and their wrong shall fall upon their own pate. In this sort the going
down of their meat will trouble and grieve them, and their filling in
tolerable to them: as Solomon does likewise declare it, saying:

32 For ease slays the foolish, and the prosperity of fools destroys them.
33 But he that obeys me, shall dwell safely, and be quiet from fear of evil.
As when the gluttons and dronkardes abound in worldly riches, they cannot use
them soberly and measurably, to keep them in health of body, that they may
employ their bodies and wits to such works as be profitable both for
themselves and for their neighbors: but do use them excessiuely, eating and
drinking without rule and measure: which is cause not only that they sleep out
of time, vomit their meats, and spewe out their wine, and have no care to do
well no more than brute beasts, who are suffised with eating, drinking and
sleeping, but is cause also why they are deceived of their opinion: for they
having abundance of riches, and using them after their Iustes, do judge
themselves happy, and think they are at their ease, and take their pleasure,
and that no evil can happen them. Even so the witolde and fools, seeing
themselves to be the greatest heap, and perceiving themselves the strongest
(none resisting which can hurt them, and that by this means oftentimes come to
atchieue their counsels and enterprises) do judge to be at their ease and to
have sound and sure prosperity: therein they become so dronken and abused that
they think no evil can ever fall upon them, and in this arrogance they are
given to invent the destruction of their neighbors, and all the exhortations
that can be made them by the word of God, they despise and reject: but contrary
to their opinion, they are environed and compassed with miseries and
calamities, through fear whereof they become almost dead. And for that that in
such misery, though they cry and lament, they seek not those remedies which
they ought, they are destroyed: in this sort their ease kills them, and their
prosperity destroys them. The Sodomites and Gomorrhians have experimented
such ease and felicity. First of al let us the^ Genesis 13.
note that the way of the witoldes and fools is nothing but sin, whereof the
reward is death. And S. James says, Then when lust Romans 6. 23. Iam. 1. 15.
has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, does
bring forth death. It is not for naught that we are warned not to consent to
them, and to walk with them in their way. And as their way is not good, and
cannot bring forth but evil fruit: so their counsels are wicked and ungodly,
as we have seen: for they tend to no other end but to undo their
neighbors, and to contemn al discipline. Whereupon it follows they eat
nothing that is ought worth: and again, albeeit the bodily meat which they
take in this world does please them, yet it does but poison them: for spending
the goods which are none of theirs, they deserve death which will not spare
them. If we then would have our bodies well refreshed, let us follow the
counsels of wisdom, Unto the pure are al things pure: but unto them that are
defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure. Secondly, as the Tit. 1. 15.
sottes and fools shall eat of the fruit of their way, etc. as they deserve:
so will God grant this grace to those which apply themselves to wisdom and
prudence, that he will satisfy them with the fruits of their good way and of
their holy counsels. Esaias says. Say ye, surely it shall be well with the just:
for they shall eat the Esa. 3. 10.
fruit of their works. The sottes and fools, which forsake the Lord,
shall be deprived of such meat: as it is said, Behold, my Esa. 65. 13.
servants shall eat, and ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink,
and ye shall be thirsty. and, Blessed are they which hunger and thirst for
righteousness: for they shall be filled. And as ease Mat. 5.
destroys the wicked, for being fatted, either they forget God, or else
spurn against him: even so when the wise have been afflicted, they shall be
quickened, and not destroyed. We have many promises and examples in the
scriptures, but because of brevity, we will omit them.

33 But he that obeys me. That the faithful, (which feel themselves to run
often astray, according as their corrupt nature is inclined to evil) should
not despair, being feared with the threatenings that are made against the
foolish, and that they should not think they are appointed to destruction,
without scaping, wisdom makes them a promise of great comfort: wherein she
shows the remedy and means whereby fear may be eschewed, and destruction
put away. This promise ought greatly to comfort us: and for to receive it,
there is no more asked of us, but that we obey the wisdom of God, when it
speaks unto us by his Scriptures, and by the mouth of his Ministers. But the
Pope and his, demand clean contrary, and burn the books of the old and
new Testament, which contain the holy Scripture: they persecute and put to
death, so much as they can, the Ministers of the word, and they that gladly
hear them. And in this sort it stands not in them that the wisdom of God
is not dumb, and we not deaf. And so doing no thank to them that we be not in
continual fear, and destroyed. For since the remedy and means to be delivered
of fear, and escape destruction, is to obey wisdom, and they will not suffer
it: it follows, that they seek nothing but our ruin and destruction.
Wherefore that may be said to them which Christ did reproach the Scribes and
Pharisees with all, Woe therefore be unto you Scribes and Pharisees,
Hypocrites, because Mat. 23. 13.
ye shut up the kingdom of Heaven before men: for ye yourselues go not in,
neither suffer ye them that would enter, to come in. When as much as in them
is, they take away the word, which is the only keye of the kingdom of Heaven,
they hinder men as much as can be from entering in. For by the word, the Heavens
are opened unto them which receive it: and by the same they are shut from
them which reject it. Saint Peter having the promise of the keys, has
received nothing but the charge to preach the Gospel, which whosoever
believes, shall be saved: and so the doors shall be opened for him: and he that
believes not, shall be condemned: and so the door shall be shut against
him. If the worldlinges delight to sing and hear pleasant songs to the
flesh, and are not grieved thereat, but if they be able, give wages to those
which can sing and play upon musical instruments, that they may pass their
time from day to day: by a more strong reason the children of God ought daily
to apply their wits and minds to obey this sweet voice of wisdom, yea, to
forsake all that we have in the world, be they parents or friends, be they
temporal goods, reputations and honor, rather than to be deprived of this
voice so gracious and desirable. This voice brings us the law of the Lord,
which is perfect, converting the soul. etc, This doing we shall truly obey
wisdom, and by this means we shall be safe: and when affliction shall assault
us, we shall not be Psalm. 19. 7.
afraid. As it is plainly showed us by the parable, of the wise man that
builds his house upon a rock. By this same we may understand, Mat. ^. 24.
that what safety or rest God does promise us, serving and obeying him, that
we must not think we be exempted in this world from miseries and
afflictions, from fear and dread. S. Paul has well proved it, as he showed
it in the second to the Corinthians. Likewise do all they prove it which
will live godly in Cor. 1. 7.
Christ Jesus, as it has been before told them. The safety then of the
faithful consists not, in not suffering any affliction in this world, nor in
not being astonished: but herein, that whatsoever happen us, we shall not be
overcome with fear, neither shall the afflictions come upon us like a
whirlewinde, which should consume and destroy us. The deliverance from all
evils shall be when Christ has gathered us to himself, shall wipe away all
tears from our eyes, and shall give us rest, joy, and eternal felicity.

The second Chapter.
1 MY son, if thou will receive my words, and hide my commandments within
thee, 2 And cause thine ears to hearken unto wisdom, and incline thine heart
to understanding. 3 For if thou call after knowledge, and criest for
understanding: 4 If thou seek her as silver, and searchest for her, as for
treasures: 5 Then shall thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the
knowledge of God. 6 For the Lord gives wisdom, out of his mouth comes
knowledge and understanding.
TO the intent that we should not deceive ourselves, thinking to be sufficient,
simply and only to hear the wisdom of God, he shows here that we should
not be like unto the seed which fell by the high way side, but to the good
ground, which receives the Math. 13. 4.
seed into it: and that by so doing we shall obtain the former promise. And
to show us this, he declares more at large, in that, which before he had
briefly said, and that for our better instruction: because we do not easily
at the first understand what is spoken of God. At the beginning of this
declaration, God opens himself to be our Father, when he calls every one
of us (which hearken to his wisdom) his son: and this is for that we should
the more willingly follow his desires, as also we are bound thereunto; and
that we might perceive he demands nothing of us, but that a loving and gentle
Father ought and may demand of his children. That which he desires of us,
is, that when we hear his words, which are the seed of life, we should
receive them in such wise, that we should not suffer the fowls of the air
to come and pecke up this seed. When he desires us to receive and hide, he
teaches us that we do not his commandments, by doing only the outward
works, but the better to obey them truly, we must print them in our hearts,
and should let the external works proceed from the inward desire of the
same, chiefly of the glory of God. Albeit that God also requires us to Mat. 5.
16.
hide within us his commandments: yet is it not to say, that it is lawful for
us to become false Nicodemites, making ourselves believe that our hearts be
right before God, though they be dissembling and covered before men: and not
only so, but also that we cannot lawfully seem to consent unto superstition,
and idolatry. The wise man does not teach us that: for as the Jews were bound
to declare themselves to be the people of God, by the outward observation of
the law, of the feasts, and of the sacrifices, and other ceremonies: even so
must we make profession of our Christian religion, by bringing forth fruits
worthy of repentance.

2 And cause thine ears to hearken, etc. Solomon shows unto us in this
place, how wisdom desires us to receive her words, by outward profession,
and that we would become her obedient children: for therein she requires that
we should be hearers of Gods word, in often resorting unto the holy
congregation, amongst whom the name of the Lord is called upon, and we taught
in this holy word by the ministry of men. He shows also how she would not
have us to be hypocrites, but that our hearts should be truly and wholly given to
know God, for to render unto him true obedience: when he says, And incline
thine heart unto understanding. When Solomon desires us to bow down our ears
unto wisdom, he means that the ministers of the word, should not be dumb,
and that it should not grieve them to preach wisdom, not the wisdom of this
world: for it is foolishness before God, from whom comes al wisdom: but
that they should declare Mat. 11. 25.
the mysteries that God has hidden from the wise and prudent, men of this
world, and opened the same to babes. And because the world is bare of such
ministers, and that the sheep are scattered, as having no shepheardes: and
that they which most brag themselves to be shepherds, are ravening wolves,
we must therefore pray unto god, that it may plese him to accomplish his
promise, which he makes in Iere. And I will give you pastors according unto
my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. Ier. 3. 15.
And as the Ministers ought to speak these things, so ought the sheep to be
also atte^tiue unto his voice, the which though it John. 10. 16.
be heard from the mouth of me^, yet is it truly the voice of the great
shepherd. Other sheep I have also which are not of this fold, the^ also must I
bring, and they shall hear my voice, etc, Therefore let us hear and incline
our hearts to this understanding, with faith, that our Lord do not reproach us,
as he says in John, but you believe not: for ye are not of my sheep. Let us
then cause our ears to harken unto wisdom, and by faith let us give him our
hearts: from the abu^da^ce whereof let our mouths be open to prayers, and
tha^ksgiuing according unto Wisdoms desire, as she declares saying:

3 For if thou call after knowledge. Herein we may learn, that it is a very
necessary thing to show ourselves the children of God by outward profession,
and also to show with how much our hearts should be fervent, when they ought so
to move and stir up not only our ears to understand Wisdom, but also our
mouths to prayers: thereby to declare that we have great need, that God should
give us knowledge, and endue us with learning to give him praise and thanks,
and to show how we acknowledge, and that all ought to acknowledge and confess,
that it proceeds of gift and favor, that we are endued with knowledge and
understanding. Likewise when Solomon is not content to say, if thou call
after knowledge; but repeateth saying, and cryest for understanding: He
teaches us that we should carefully and diligently seek wisdom, as if we
perceived it would depart from us, and would forsake us, as also indeed we are
never endued therewith so perfitly, but that yet we want much therein. This
diligence is yet better expressed, when he adds:

4 If thou seek her as silver. As the covetous do not sleep, for fear
they should wax poor, and also labor and suffer much hardness, for to get
riches: and if they suspect any place whereas is silver or treasure hid, they
cease not, but with great care and sore diligence do seek and dig it up,
that they may possess; and forsake it not willingly til they have gotten it:
so should the children of GOD apply their senses unto wisdom, and to have al
their delight therein, as in their only treasures. Let us then first of al
note, that albeit wisdom would have her children like unto the covetous, yet
notwithstanding she allows not covetousness, also our Savior Jesus does
very much forbid it us. But yet she would have that the children of light
should be as wife and prudent in their generation, as are the Mat. 6. 14.
children of this world in theirs. Now the wisdom of the worldlinges is to
be very careful to provide for the time to come, that they may not want.
Experience does show it, and the Steward which is accused, may be an example
thereof unto us. We Luke. 16. 1.
have not such a desire after the heavenly riches, as we may well perceive, if
we be of sound judgment: neither can we deny it, unless we will falsify
our Lord, who says, The children of this world are in their generation wiser
then the children of light. Luke. 16. 8
Thus we agree not to wisdoms will, the which notwithstanding is needeful for
us to follow, if in time to come we will not want. Being like unto the covetous
in care and diligence; let us fly covetousness, and with an earnest affection
follow the heavenly riches. Secondarily, let us note that we should be ashamed
to see that the covetous must be our teachers and masters: And that their
diligence Mat. 6. Luke 16.
about these worldly things, must be a lesson for us to follow the heavenly
treasure. Furthermore, we must confess the great gentleness of God, which
does offer us his inestimable riches: and to attain thereto, requires of us
no greater care nor diligence then the worldlings have to hunt after earthly
riches, which suddenly vanish away from us, and perishes.

5 Then shall thou understand, etc. He promises us, that if we yield unto
these conditions, answering unto the desires and pleasures of wisdom, that we
shall understand the fear of the Lord, etc. This promis at the first sight
seems not to be of any great importance, neither does it seem that we may
receive any profit thereby: and therefore the fools and mockers (which desire
not to mortify their flesh, but to give it liberty) so much as they can, do
despise and reject this promis, neither do they also make any accoumpt of the
former conditions. But the children of God, which through the holy Ghost do
fight against the lusts of their flesh to tame it, do set much by this
promis, as also it brings us great treasures and exceeding riches. For as it
is said by S. Paul in the Cor. Things which eye has not seen, 1. Cor. 2. 9.
and ear has not heard, neither have entered into man's mind or heart, which
things God has prepared for them that love him. It brings unto us (I say) a
sure habitation: for whosoever truly knows, how to serve GOD, with all
humblnes and reverence, with all holiness and honesty, with all innocence and
obedience, and does delight therein, is assured that destruction shall not come
upon him as a whirlewinde. It brings us rest also, delivering us from the
fear of evil: for whosoever has true knowledge of God, the same knows, that
he is his almighty Father, and most merciful Savior: And therefore in very
knowledge he says, if God be on our side, who shall be against us to do us
hurt? In this peace, fear shall not come upon him like desolation, but walking
in the fear and knowledge of God, he holds the way, whereby in the end he
shall attain unto the possession and fruition of everlasting life, where he
shall quite be delivered from al fear and danger for ever. And as they esteem
this promise, so do they also delight to follow the conditions which are made,
through the observing of the which, they attain to this promise: not that by
the observing of these conditions, they can merit the fulfilling of this
promise: but because God (which lies not) has so promised, and so pleases
him to do. The which well appears by that which follows.

For the Lord gives etc: By this reason he closes up the mouths of the
proud hypocrites, which make themselves believe that God is their detter: for
since that by wisdom, knowledge and understanding, we walk the way of
everlasting life, the which we have not, but of Gods gifts: then must these
proud persons be dumb, unless they will make Solomon a liar. He shows us
also, that we cannot keep the former conditions, unless it be given us of
God: and consequently that we have not the use of this promise, but of mere
grace and liberality: for if the cause be not in our power, no more is the
effect. Furthermore, when Solomon shows that in the observation of the former
conditions, we have not to do with mortal men, but with the Almighty and
eternal God: and that it is he which speaks unto us, when we open our ears
to hearken unto wisdom: he teaches us, with what fear and reverence, and
with what care and diligence, we should read the holy Scriptures, and hear
the preaching of the Gospel: for therein does God open his mouth to give us
wisdom. And we must not imagine any carnal thing of God, seeing he is a
spirit. Hereby we may learn that we ought not to resort to the preaching of
the word, and to the publik prayers slackely, or for customs sake, as do the
Hypocrites, the Superstitious and Idolaters: but to the end that we may
receive and learn wisdom of God through his grace and goodness, whereby we
knowing him, may walk in his fear. And since it is the gift of God, we should
remember to pray continually unto him for the same. And what wisdom soever we
have, we will praise ourselves never the more for it, as if we were something
more then others which are void thereof: but without abusing ourselves, we will
confess with Saint James, that every good Iam. 1. 17.
gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father
of lights. Otherwise we should well deserve to hear, What have thou, that thou
have not received? Moreover there is none amongst us, which would not only think
himself to be out of 1. Cor. 4. 7.
his wit, (if he should refuse a thing which he could not want) but also would
judge himself most unthankful, if he did not receive it with hearty
thanksgiving, when it were freely offered him. Now that this promise with the
reason joined thereto, does bring us so much goodness as has bin said, Solomon
shows when he says:

7 He preserves the state of the righteous: he is a sheelde to them that walk
uprightly. 8 That they may keep the ways of judgment: and he preserves the
way of his saints.
Here Solomon makes God like unto the^, which through pity do receive and
hide the poor afflicted in their houses, from the wrath of their persecutors.
The which we may know by two words that Solomon uses in his speech. The
first, which we have translated, to preserve, signifies also to hide, and to
keep close: The second, which we have enterpreted state, does come of a Verb
which signifies to be: and so it may be translated being, as if he did say,
The Lord so hides the righteous, that he preserves the^ in their being, to
the end that destruction should not overcome the^, but might escape, and so
always remain in their being. He means not according as the world speaks,
when he says, That they shall remain in there being: for herein he speaks
of that life which he knows to be but corporal and temporal, the which
oftentimes, the righteous have taken from them through the cruelty and
tyranny of the wicked: but when the righteous know that all the hears of
their head are numbered before God, they care not for their being in this world,
neither do they fear them which only can kill the body. So long as God
would have us to live, we shall be preserved: for they can do nothing against
us, but so far as he does suffer them. And if our corporal and temporal
state be to him so precious, by a more strong reason our spiritual and eternal
being shall be had in greater price with him, and he will by his grace and
goodness so cover it, through the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, wherein
lies the assurance of all the faithful, that neither the world, sin or
death, nor all the power of Hell can any thing prevail to destroy it, although
they spurn at it, and do whatsoever they can against it. After this sort, the
righteous, that is to say, they that fear the Lord, are in a sure dwelling,
and may truly say, the Lord is our protector and defender, Psalm. 118. 6.
we will not fear what man can do to us. For they have no such power in their
corporal estate, that they can let us from rising again, and that we should not
take our bodies again to live eternally in them. Lo how we shall be preserved
in perpetual being in the possession of everlasting health. The which Solomon
does notify unto us, when he uses the Verb which signifies not only that
which is done presently, but also what shall be done hereafter: joining this
therewith, that God is so faithful and constant, Psalm. 138. 8.
that what he has once begun, he leaves it not, but does bring it to
perfection. It is not Solomon alone that teaches us to have such confidence in
God. All the holy scripture is replenished with examples and promises which
should induce us to such hope and assurance. How great is thy goodness, which
thou have laid up Psalm. 31. 2^
for the^, that fear thee: and done to them that trust in thee, even before
the sons of me^? And albeit that by walking rightly in the fear of the
Lord, we obtain this state: yet it is not to say, that it comes for our
righteousness sake: for of it self it is never without many imperfections,
and so can not please GOD, except of his only goodness he allow it. Seeing
then that God of his only mercy does hide and preserve us, it behooves that
being merciful as he is, we should be so much as we can, the sheeld and defense
of the poor afflicted, as Esaias does say, To hide them that are chaced out: not
to bewray him that is fled. And in the 58. of Esaias, Deal thy bread to the
hungry, and bring the poor that wander, unto thy house. It might also be
said, that when Esaias. 16. 3. Esaias. 58. 7.
Solomon says, how God preserves the state of the righteous, that he does
like unto good Fathers which wast not their goods, but do preserve them for
their children and heirs. Nevertheless, the first sense is the most meetest:
as we may understand it, when Solomon adds that God is a sheelde to them
that walk uprightly. Here God is compared to a sheelde, or to a man which
sets himself against him, which would do violence to his neighbor, and
puts himself between both, for to defend him that is like to be oppressed:
and that very fitly. For as an expert man of war, very nimble and strong in
his members, can with his sheeld defend all darts and arrows, and al strokes:
even so is God the defense and deliverance of those, which having found the
true knowledge of God, do forsake al dissembling, feigning, and hypocrisy,
and walk truly in singleness of conscience. And since that God is our sheeld,
and that we have no need of sheeld, and target, but in war and combat: it
follows we are in a battle the which we cannot of ourselves overcome: and
therefore S. Paul does exhort us to be strong in the Lord, and in the Ephe.
6. 10.
power of his might, Thus being armed, and God being our sheeld, we need not
to be afraid for any desolation, but to remain steadfast, looking for help
and assistance of the Almighty. There comes then no small profit, when we
understand the fear of the Lord, and have found the knowledge of GOD: then
we walk uprightly and sincerely, whereby God preserves our state, and
delivers us from al evil, that we may remain quietly in everlasting being.

8 That they may keep the ways of judgment etc. The Lord, as we have seen
here above, does deride and laugh at the Prou. 1. 26.
foolish, scornful, and fools: but co^trarily he gives to his children
(which receive his words, and hide within the^ his co^ma^dements) safety and
rest. And this he does for to keep all the sorts and ways of good and right
judgment: that is to say, to show himself a righteous Judge, as he is, by
making void, and disappointing the wicked of their purposes, by overthrowing
their devises and enterprises, and by punishing them for their contempt and
wickedness: (which apply themselves thereunto, and the same to attain, do with
great care and sore diligence incline their hearts thereafter) and by defending
and preserving them from all evils. It is the same that Solomon means, when
he says, That they may keep the ways of right judgment. If we would then,
that God should not punish us, but be our defender and preserver, let us
incline our hearts wholly unto wisdom. But to the intent (that if God do give
us this grace to understand his fear, and to find his knowledge) we should
not attribute these virtues and gifts unto our care and diligence, neither
should think that we have well deserved that God should keep such judgment
for us: Solomon is not contented to have said in the 6. verse, that the Lord
gives Wisdom, but he adds, that the Lord preserves the way of his
Saints: that is to say, that he keeps those which through his fear and
knowledge, and by ruling and governing them with his holy Spirit, that they are
kept back from evil, and do not consent unto sinners, neither fall into
disdain and contempt of his Word, nor do reject all discipline and
correction. Otherwise, without the same they should be spoiled of al
righteousness, judgment, and equity, and should not know how to hold the
good and right pathe, but very soon would decline either to the right or to
the left hand, and would be of the compact and conspiracy of sinners. But
when the Lord preserves their way, they know how to govern themselves, and
do not wander out of the way: as Solomon does declare unto us saying,

9 Then shall thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and every good
pathe. If then we walk rightly, delighting to give unto our neighbors that
which is theirs, we must confess with all humility and thanks giving, that
knowledge and understanding and the preservation of our way only proceeds
from the free gift of God. And when we are thus truly instructed, we will not
delight to walk the broad way, which leads to destruction: but by the
straight way, which leads unto life. And Mat. 7. 14.
that we may be preserved therein, we will pray with David, Direct me in the
pathe of thy commandments: for therein is my delight. Psalm. 119. 35.


10 When Wisdom enters into thine heart, and knowledge delights thy
soul, 11 Then shall counsel preserve thee, and understanding shall keep thee,
12 And deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaks froward
things: 13 And from them that leave the ways of righteousness to walk in the
ways of darkness: 14 Which rejoice in doing evil, and delight in the
frowardness of the wicked, 15 Whose ways are crooked, and they are leude in
their paths.
Now Solomon willing to declare unto us from what evils we shall be preserved by
this gift, does set before us a condition, whereby he warns us not to be
negligent to accept this gift, but with all diligence to prepare our hearts to
receive Wisdom, when through the grace of the Lord, it enters to dwell
within us: and also that we should not be unthankful, nor esteeming this
free gift, that we have not, nor can in any wise deserve: but that we should
acknowledge it, abhorring ignorance, and setting our whole delight in that,
that it pleases God to give us knowledge and learning. Following this
admonition our, hearts should be set on the law of the Lord, and to meditate
therein day and night; and that Psa. 119. 10.
we ourselves might truly say, what David said, With my whole heart have I
sought thee: let me not wander from thy commandments. Again, I have had as
great delight in the way of thy 14
testimonies, as in all riches. If we thus do, we shall be in great safety and
rest, as Solomon declares saying,

11 Then shall counsel preserve thee, etc. When a wise man keeps watch for a
City, the dwellers thereof may sleep without fear of being taken by their
enemies. Likewise when a man of understanding has the governance of another,
the same need not to fear to be evil guided, or that he should fall in
danger: but be assured that he will so guide him, that he will atchieue and
accomplish to deliver him safe and sound. Even so ought we to understand how
Solomon does not here promise us any small matter, of little importance, but
that he promises unto us safety and rest, which all the world can not give us,
though it stood armed round about us on every side to defend us. And because
we are more given to trust in outward and worldly things, and that we seek
rather in them our safety and rest, then in the Wisdom of God, the which we
mistrust, we should, continually pray unto God to turn away our eyes from
vanity, and to help our unbelief. Else we can not enjoy this promise, the
which does not lead us unto a worldly and corporal hope and trust: but is
given us to this end, that we should be assured of the rest and preservation of
our souls: as we may perceive it when Solomon adds, whereunto God tends by
this watch and preservation, saying,

12 And deliver thee, etc. When God preserves us, through the good counsel
that he does give us, and when he does keep us through good understanding that
he puts in us, it is to the end that we shall not walk in the way with
sinners, which go to destruction for their wicked manners and doings and that
labor to draw others after them: but should be kept back therefrom, and
directed in the way of salvation and life. Now as this evil way is broad and
wide, and that many frequent and walk therein, by whom it cannot be amended
but impaired: so is it full of diverse perils, from the which God delivers
those over whom he watches. He does deliver them from those that speak
froward things: not that he does take them away from amongst them: but he
suffers them not to believe them, lest through their perverse and froward
words they should be turned away unto errors, to false doctrines, and vain
hopes, and that their good manners should not be corrupted. Now the means
whereby they are delivered, is 1. Cor. 15. 33.
that he printeth in them his word, whereunto they surely trusting, cannot be
removed nor seduced.

13 And from them. He continues still, showing from what persons and from what
dangers God does deliver the children of wisdom. And when he settetth here the
right paths, against the ways of darkness, it is to make us to understand that
the ways of righteousness, are righteousness, innocency, modesty, sobernes
honesty, te^perance, and such like virtues. For the ways of darkness are
unrighteousness, malice, excess, uncleanness, and such vices, as the Romans 13.
12.
Apostle speaks of. Let us therefore cast away the deeds of darkness, and
let us put on the armor of light. And again, So that Ephe. 5. 3.
fornication and all uncleanness, or covetousness, be not once named amongst
you, as it becomes Saints. Now these virtues are called, the ways of
righteousness, for whosoever follows them, he may be assured, not to go
astray, but that without let or stop he may attain unto eternal rest. For he
follows Jesus Christ who is the light of the world, the Way, the Truth and
the Life. Contrarily, the vices are called the ways of darkness: for they
that walk in them are uncertain, what shalbecome of the^: as they which walk
in darkness know not whether they go. It is then very profitable and
healthful to be given unto. Wisdom, and very dangerous to contemn the same.
For by this contempt some go into darkness for ever, where shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth: as they do well deserve, when so doing they forsake al
virtues to follow vices, which is the way that leads unto this darkness.
But as there be many ways of darkness, so do they walk diversely in them:
and therefore we have great need that God should give us counsel and
understanding, to deliver us, not only from one danger and one kind of
people, which labor to draw us unto perdition with them: but it is necessary
for us to fly the fellowship of many, that we may be delivered from many
dangers: as indeed God does keep us for to deliver us therefrom: and besides
the rest, he keeps watch to preserve and deliver us.

14 Which rejoice in doing evil, etc. That is to say, that we should not be
like to them which of set purpose are given to hurt their neighbors, and also
are glad when they can turn others to do as evil as themselves, making their
boast and triumph thereof, as if they had done well, or as they had obtained
some great pray. Now it is needful for us, that God should deliver us from
such people, and that in no wise he suffer us so to rejoice and boast:
contrarily we ought to look that God should rejoice to give us according unto
our works, and take vengeance of our iniquities. Not that God does delight to
punish us: but the wicked shall feel him such toward them, as they have bin
toward their neighbors, when they receive the reward that they have deserved.

Whose ways are crooked. If we were like unto such people, we might look but
for an horrible vengeance of God: as the world destroyed by the flud, and the
Sodomites with the Gomorrhia^s by a more sharp punishment: seeing that God
having given us his son, does daily offer us his Evangelical word which is
the message of the everlasting covenant: the conte^ners of which message shall be
punished more grievously then they of Sodom and Gomorrhe. Matt. 10. 15.
God then shows us great favor, when he preserves us from being like to
such corruptors and Apostataes.

16 And it shall deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger,
which flattereth with her words. 17 Which for saketh the guide of her youth,
and forgeteth the covenant of her God. 18 Surely her house tends to death,
and her paths unto the dead. 19 Al they that go unto her, return not again;
neither take they hold of the ways of life.
When a path or way is much trodden and beaten, there is no count made of any
danger: and when a thing is often done, although it is wicked, yet do they
make themselves believe that in it there is no evil: as they do which rashly
swear, which do give themselves to lascivious and dissolute talk, unto
covetousness, usury, and wicked bargaining, to sloth and idleness. Likewise
because that diverse forsworn and unfaithful do break promise of holy
marriage, and have no conscience to become adulterers, and that the world is
full of mockers and contemners of the institution of holy marriage which God
has ordained from the beginning of the world, and had rather committee
whoredom then by marriage to take unto them an honest companion or wife, the
which is honorable among all men: it seems to most men that there is no
danger to follow the way of adulterers and whoremongers, and that Heb. 13. 4.
they commit no evil in being defiled and polluted with whoredom and
fornication. But when the holy Ghost by the mouth of Solomon does declare unto
us: that God does give us counsel and understanding, that we may be delivered
from the strange woman: he shows us well that it is not so as the world
judges, for if there were no da^ ger, we should not need, that God should give
us counsel and understanding, to deliver us from her. Let us not then follow the
opinion of the adulterers and whoremongers: but let us believe that there is
great danger to go unto an harlot, and to talk with her, which Solomon here
calls a stranger and a forenner, because, that if she be married, she
belongs not unto him that haunteth her, but unto her husband, from who^ she
departs and alienateth herself in playing the harlot: and so she is also a
stranger toward her husband. And if she be unmarried, she apperteineth to
none, but ought to abstain, by tarying til God send her a yoke fellow to be
honestly joined by marriage: so she is also a stranger and forenner, if she
play the harlot, seeing she belongs to no man. Our Lord does warn us
thereof, and does daily make us to understand it by the preaching of his word,
the which he does not co^municat so purely unto al nations: but yet nevertheless
adultery and whordo^ cease not to reign. They abstain not from unshamefast
looks and countenances, they refrain not their tongues from speaking foul
and filthy words, and to sing dishonest and wanton songs. By such words and
songs, do the whormongers and harlots plainly utter themselves: and albeit to
excuse themselves, they allege that they think upon no evil, they are not to
be received for all that, but as wicked liers, which falsely belie the infallible
Truth, which pronounces that Ma. 12. 34.
from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. Let us not then despise
the counsel that God gives us, when he tells us, that marriage is to be had
in honor among al men, and the bed undefiled: for whorekeepers and adulterers
God will judge. Now that Heb. 13. 4.
there is danger only to talk with whoremongers and harlots, Solomon does
show, saying, That the strange woman flattereth with her words. It is not
needful to declare what flatteries the harlots and whorekeepers use: for they
which desire to live chastely, need not to understand them. It ought to be
enough for them to know, that it is not lawful for man and woman to dwell
together, except they be knit together by marriage. It is not also needful to
declare them to such as are given to whordom: for they are but too much learned
therein already. True it is, notwithstanding to admonish the indiscreet, that
they may not pretend cause of ignorance, we may discover and unfold the sweet
words and flattring speech of the harlots and whorkeepers, with their strange
attires: as Solomon Pro. 7. 5.
does declare them hereafter, in the 7. Chapter. After the flatteries. Solomon
discovers the unthankfulness of the adulterers, saying,

17 Which forsakes, etc. Solomon shows that there is much evil in adultery,
though a man be accustomed thereto: for unfaithfulness is no small evil, but great
wickedness: therefore the more one is accustomed thereto, so much the more does
he commit evil, and is the more worthy of great punishment: for custom
absolueth not a gilty person, but makes him more gilty. Look what we judge of
murder and theft, we ought also to judge of every transgressio^ of the law, in
what point so ever it is: for he that has said, Thou shall not kill, has said
also, Thou shall not commit adultery. When Ier. 2. 11.
then God gives us understanding to defend us from adultery, he preserves and
delivers us from great wickedness. The unfaithfulness of the adulterous woman
consists in this, that she leaves and forsakes her husband: not that she
forsakes him utterly, leaving him for ever, without returning to him any more:
for unfaithfulness stands not only in that, but chiefly in this, that she
joins hirself to an other, separating herself from her husband, and making of
one flesh two: and yet she will not leave returning to her husband, to cover her
unfaithfulness. Eue^ so likewise is it with an adulterer and unfaithful man to
his wife. And to show that the adulterous woman is not only unfaithful, but
also disobedient, rebellious, and unthankful, Solomon calls her husband
Prince, Teacher, and guide of the youth of his wife: wherein he shows that he
is the head and the gouerner, having prerogative above her: and therefore, that
she ought to fear and reverence him, and with faithfulness to give him
obedience. That which Solomon does here show us, in one word, Ephe. 5. 1. 2.
Pet. 3. 1.
the Apostles S. Peter and S. Paul do declare more at large. Likewise the
adulterous man is not only unfaithful to his wife, but cruel: for he does not
govern the youth, the weakness, and frailty of his wife, in enterteining and
tenderly loving her, as Solomon does teach him, calling him the guide of the
youth of his wife. And to show us that by adultery they offend not only
against men, but also against the ordinance which God has made between man
and wife: Solomon says, the adulteress forgets the covenant of her God.
Genesis 2. 23. Mat. 19. 5.
For who so commits adultery, does separate that which God has joined.
What we have said of the unfaithfulness of the adulterous woman (by the course
of the text) it may well appear that he speaks but of the married whore:
nevertheless, we have applied it unto the single harlot, and that without
wresting of the text. For we ought to understand that if God give us counsel
and understanding to preserve and deliver us from one kind of whoredom, that
he would also we should abhor the other kinds. Likewise it is very true
that who so is given to adultery, will not abstain from single fornication.

18 Surely her house te^deth, etc. Moreover for to show that there is danger in
adultery, and that they do evil by defiling themselves with such
uncleanness, Solomon gives a reason whereby he threatens the adulterers
with a thing which wonderfully fears them that walk in an evil conscience.
And it is to admonish and warn us to take good heed, not to frequent and
haunt the company of whores and whoremongers, least we defile ourselves, and
consent unto their filthiness and abomination. For if we would not willingly
come near a ruinous and rotten house, least in falling, it should bruise our
bodies, and kill us bodily: by a stronger reason, we must not come near unto an
adulteress, who^ to haunt, not only bruiseth the bones, but also eternally
kills the souls. The house of the adulteress, is herself, her acquaintance
and customers that go together unto eternal da^natio^: which is a danger,
wherewith when one is attaint, he ca^ never be raised up again. Now we ought
well to understand that this is of eternal death and state of the damned that
Solomon speaks, when he says that the house of the harlot tends to death:
for albeit that the Ecclesiastes (speaking of the common state of men) says,
One generation passes, and another generation succeeds. Again, How dies
the wise man, as does the Eccle. 1. 4. Eccle. 2. 16. and 3. 18.
fool? Again, I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men
that God had purged the^: yet to see to, they are in themselves as beasts. It
were not a sufficient reason to show us the danger that is in haunting the
company of harlots, nor to preserve us from familiar communication with whores
and whoremongers, if there were none other death spoken of here, but corporal
death, the which is common to al men. A man might say, as do the mockers, let
us play the whoremo^gers without any fear: for nothing shall happen us which
happens not unto the most chaste. Let us the^ understand that Solomon
threatens the adulterers and whoremo^gers Luke. 20. 27.
with eternal death: as also he shows the same, saying, that her paths tend
unto death. For none but the damned are dead: as it may be known when it is
said, that the Lord is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and of Jacob.
There is then great danger, and also much wickedness in adultery: or else God
which is not only righteous, but also merciful, would not punish it with so
sharp a death. Now that the adulterers go unto eternal death, Solomon does
give it us to understand, when he adds:

19 All they that go unto her, etc. Here he compares them which are given to
adultery, unto soldiers that go into the war, and there place and thrust
themselves so far forwards that there they are slain. Wherein we have a
proof that in adultery is great peril, and also much evil: seeing in it
there is no remedy nor means to escape the punishment of eternal death: as
also Solomon does signify the same, saying, Neither take they hold of the
ways of life. When Solomon does so threaten the adulterers and the
whoremongers, he speaks of them which are hardened and cannot repent and be
sorry for their sin, and forsake their wicked life. We might here reprove
such, as do break marriages lawefully made, as they know well enough: Mat.
19. 9.
and give license to the parties to marry again in some other place: which
they cannot do, without transgressing of the Law of God by adultery and
whoredom. I say therefore unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife,
except it be for whoredom, and marry another, commits adultery. And thus
so much as in them lies, they bring men to contempt of Gods law: whereupon
follows eternal death, not only for them which are separated, if they keep
not themselves chaste: but also for those that separate them: for they are in a
great fault, when they hinder the ordinance of God to have his course. For no
thank to them that the covenant of God is not forgotten, and al honesty
overthrown: the which is such an offense that it were better for Mat. 18. 6.
them by whom it comes, to have a millstone hanged about their necks, and
that they were drowned in the depth of the Sea.

The ways and steps, the paths and trades, for the which to avoid, God does
give us wisdom and understanding are the same of the wicked, and unrighteous,
whereby they go unto perdition: and therefore forsaking them, we must walk a
contrary way to them, wherein we may be preserved: and the same to do, Solomon
does admonish us saying:

20 Therefore walk thou in the way of good men, and keep the ways of the
righteous. 21 For the just shall dwell in the land, and the upright men shall
remain in it. 22 But the wicked shall be cut of from the earth, and the
transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
When our Lord says, That there is none good but one, and that is, God: And
also, that there is none that does good: for we have Mat. 19. 17. Psalm. 14.
11. Romans 3. 9.
already proved, that al, both Jews and Gentiles are under sin: It may be
demanded where a man should find out the way of good men, and the paths of
the righteous. I answer, Although that after the posterity of Adam we be
corrupted, and that in us there is no goodness nor righteousness, but that malice
abou^deth: notwithstanding insomuch as we are regenerate by the holy ghost, and
made new creatures, not suffering sin to reign in our mortal bodies, but
delighting in the law of God after the inward man, and giving ourselves to
work righteousness, and to exercise the works of charity: we are both good
and righteous, for that it pleases God to accept us for such, for Jesus
Christ's sake, who is our righteousness, and in him are righteousness of God.
The way then of good men, and the paths of the righteous may be found out in
true faith working by love, and by true repentance, whereby all wickedness is
abhorred. If we thus do, we shall walk in the way of good men. And albeit that
during this mortal life, we have many imperfections, and that sin dwells
in us: yet will not God impute them unto us for our destruction: our house shall
not be inclined to death, but shall attain the ways of the living, and shall
in them be preserved: as Solomon does affirm the same unto us, saying,

For the just shall dwell, etc. For to encourage us to walk in the way of good
me^, he makes us a promise of a thing that naturally we desire, that is to
say, to live long upon earth. And immediately after, he gives the reason
wherefore he allureth us to walk in the way of good men: in the which reason
he shows who are the good men and righteous, that is to say, the just and
upright. And so he teaches us, that we are not righteous and good, except we
walk uprightly and sincerely. But it may be said that this promise cannot give
us courage to walk in this way: for it belongs nothing at al unto us which
are heathen: but only to the seed of Abraham, I answer, albeit that after
the doctrine of Moses, Solomon here speaks expressly of the land of Canaan,
appertaining to the children of Israel: nevertheless now since the word of
God is directed unto us, and that thereby we know Genesis 12. 17.
how the earth is the Lords, we must take this word Land more generally. For
in what country so ever we dwell, since the land is his, he gives us our
dwelling and abiding therein. And in this sort if we be good and righteous,
just and upright, the promise belongs unto us, and ought to encourage us to
walk in the way of good men. It may be said again, that the promise to
dwell in the land, is not beneficial unto the just and upright, because that
most commonly they are oppressed, violated, and threatened Psalm. 24. 1.
to be rooted out of the earth. Answer, that the earthly life how wretched
soever it be, and what adversity soever they suffer therein, yet it cannot
be but profitable to the just and upright. For this earthly life is to them a
blessing of God, and if it were, but for so much as God does witness his
fatherly love toward them, maintaining them in this life. But it will be said,
that this blessing lasts not long, and so that they have no great benefit by
dwelling in the land. I Answer, Albeit that sometimes it happens that the
Lord does seem to withdraw the just and upright (whom he most loves) out
of this world, yet he leaves not his word unaccomplished, whereby he
promises them that they shall dwell in the land, and remain in it, as we
must understand it. For what earthly riches soever GOD does promise, we must
take the^ with condition, so far as it is expedient for our spiritual health.
But it will be said again, Though it were so that the just should remain long
on the earth, yet the promise, could not ferue enough to provoke the^ to walk
in the way of good men: For we see the ungodly and froward, the wicked and
hypocrites, to live long, and prosperously in this world: wherewith the
faithful may be tempted: and therefore they are admonished in the 37. Psalm.
37. 2.
Psalm, not to be vexed though they see them prosper and rejoice: seeing that
their destruction is at hand, from the which they shall never be raised up
again. I answer, that they which are not just and upright, use not their own
in this life: but they usurp other men's goods, as thieves and robbers: though
they have them by succession, by gift or getting: for they hold them without
Gods promise, which only makes the faithful, justly to profess that which
they have in this world. It might be further replied, that for all the promise
which the just and upright men have to dwell in the land, that yet they have
nothing more than the wicked, and that indeed, they enjoy not the land so
largely, nor so much at their ease, as do the wicked: and therefore, that this
promise cannot induce them to walk in the way of good me^. I answer again,
That this is the same promise that God made unto Abraham in Genesis: And the
self same which is often repeated in the law by Moses, and in the Prophets,
and as expounders Genesis 12. 7.
of the law: Wherefore the Law was our scholemaister to bring us to Christ.
Again, for all the promises of God in him Gal. 3. 24.
are, yea, and are in him Amen, unto the glory of God through us. Now Jesus
Christ came not into this world to bear temporal 1. Cor. 1. 20.
rule, and to possess great earthly riches, as he has declared both by word
and deed: nor to place his at their ease, and to make them great Princes of
this world. Therefore we must understand that in the promise of the land is
enclosed the same of the heavenly heritage, and that there are none but them to
whom the promise of the land is made, and which apprehend the same by faith,
who are made heirs of everlasting life. As the promise of the land is not
given to the froward and wicked, so have they no hope in the kingdom of GOD.
It is then no small matter to have this promise to dwell and remain in the
land: as the ancient Fathers did well understand it: for having the promise,
they rested not in the land, but aspired for higher things, and that by faith,
which has no stay, but on the promises only. For if we believe and hope for
that which is not promised us, we shall be frustrate of that we look for as
fools and arrogant. That the ancient fathers have aspired and looked for more
excellent Heb. 11. ^.
things, by the promis of the land, the Apostle is witness thereof. By faith
Abraham abode in the land of promis, as in a strange country, as one that
dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promis: for
he looked for a City having a foundation, whose builder and maker is God. If
we should allege this promis to the wicked which endeavor by violence to root
us out of the world, they would scorn and mock us for our labor: for they
think they have the power to destroy us at their pleasure, and that they be
masters and Lords of the land and that no man should gain say them. But the
holy Ghost by Solomon pronounces the contrary: for he says, But the wicked
shall be cut of, etc. The 37. Psalm does set forth this more at large. Albeit
then that the wicked florishe and prosper in this world, yet Psalm. 37.
shall they not continue long, but shall within a little space after their
prosperity perish eternally. For if God does not count them worthy to
possess the land by promis, much less will he judge them worthy of the
heavenly kingdom, out of the which there is nothing but damnation. As then the
everlasting life follows the promis of the earthly life: so likewise does
damnation and everlasting death follow the threatening of rooting out of this
world. Thus whosoever enjoys the land by the promis of God, the which he
lays hold on by faith, may be assured of everlasting life: and whosoever
lays not hold on it through the promis, and is threatened to be cut off, and
rooted out, may look for nothing, but perpetual misery. As touching the rest,
God will not please his children, wherewith he satisfies strangers, but will
enriche them with his benefits which shall never perish. These promises thus
considered, if we confer them with the threatninges made to the wicked, we
shall not envy their prosperity. For although to the sight and judgment of
men, they are planted and fast rooted, and that they spring, flourish and bring
forth fruit, yet shall they quickly perish. Contrarily, the good and righteous
which seem to be of little value in this world, if they be taken away, it is
Psalm. 37.
not to the end that they should perish: but after what sort soever God does
withdraw them thence out of this world, it is for to plant them in his
heavenly kingdom, in the which they shall flourish eternally. When the wicked
grow as the grass, and Psalm. 92. 7.
all the workers of wickedness do flourish, then shall they be destroyed for
ever: contrarily in the 12. verse of the same Psalm, it is said, The
righteous shall flourish like a Palm tree, and grow like a Cedre in Lebanon.
But albeeit the wicked do well deserve to be so handled, yet is it not to say
that the righteous and good deserve and merit that which is spoken of, on the
contrary part. But al comes only because of the promis. Let us the^ take good
heed least we swel and wax proud by thinking on our deserts: but let us
walk on in fear and humbleness, knowing that if GOD should use and show
himself so sharp as we deserve, he might cut us of, and root us out of the
land, as wicked and unfaithful that we are of ourselves, and of our own
corrupt nature, after the which we are al corrupted: and do abominable
works: And if we be not worthy of this earthly habitation, much less can
we boast ourselves to be worthy of the heavenly inheritance. We have nothing
then to triumph over them which perish, as if we did better then they: but if
we desire to be counted worthy to remain in the land, we must pray that
it would please God to change us, and make us new creatures by his holy
spirit. Wherefore also, though we be admonished to walk in the way of good
men, with promise to dwell in the land: and that the wicked are threatened to
be rooted out thereof: yet ought we not to follow the opinion of the
Papists, which to defend their free will, allege the exhortations and
threateninges of the scripture: saying, that it should be in vain for any to
exhort us with promise, and that in vain it should be also to threaten us,
if we had not power by our free will to do whatsoever we are admonished, and
to eschew whatsoever is threatened us: If we did follow them, we should be
much deceived. For the exhortations are not made, neither the promises given
for to show us what we can do, but what we should and ought to do. We are
much like to unthrifty husbands that grow in debt, and have nothing wherewith
to pay, etc. Likewise if God do not hold us up and give us grace, we shall
neither do that which we are admonished to do, nor yet avoid that which is
threatened to fall upon us: but must needs go to destruction and perdition.

The third Chapter.
1 MY son, forget not thou my law, but let thine hear^ keep my
commandments. 2 For they shall increase the length of thy days, and the
years of life and thy prosperity.
FOrasmuch as Solomon has admonished us to walk in the way of good men, and
has promised us, that if we be just and upright, we shall dwell and remain in
the land: contrarily, that the wicked shall be cut off, and rooted out of it:
with whom lest we should be included and overthrown, he shows us what we
have to do for to walk in that same way, and to be allowed before God as
just and upright: that is, that we despise not the law of God, lest we become
like the ground by the hye way side, whose seed was made a pray for the
birds: but that we should be like to the good Mat. 13. 4. Luke. 8. 8.
Psalm. 1. Psalm. 119. Esaias. 2. 3. Deuteronomy. 6. 6. and 11. 18.
ground. This law is the way of good men, The commandments are the paths of
the righteous. Now the manner how we should not forget the law, is given
us: we must then continually meditate and exercise ourselves in the word of
GOD. And because we are rather given to vanity, then to follow the law of
God, let us pray to GOD that he would give us the understanding of his law,
and make us walk in the path of his commandementes: as we are taught
throughout Psalm. 119.
the 119. Psalm. If we do this with an unfeigned heart, we shall be the true
children of God: and though there be in us many imperfections, yet our good God
and father, will not cease to lengthen our days: as Solomon does show us,
saying:

For they shall increase, etc. Here Solomon promises us nothing which is not
often repeated in the law and in the Prophets. Therefore seeing we have so great
a number of witnesses, let us in no wise doubt of this promis. Now though we
were altogether compassed about with evils, and that we should walk in the
mids of the shaddowe of death, yet ought it not in any case to be feared, but
that God (who is always present with us) will accomplish his promis: and
chiefly for our spiritual health, and eternal prosperity wheretoo we must
aspire, and not stay ourselves in the days and years and peace of this
temporal life, that is to say, in the earthly prosperity. And although the
Lord is our life and the length of our days, yet does Solomon attribute it
unto Deuteronomy. 30. 20.
the law and to the commandementes, because that God co^municateth both him
and his riches to those which forget not his law, but keep his commandments.
For what nation is so great, unto whom the gods come so near unto them, as
the Lord our God is near unto us, in all that we call upon him for? Hereof
we may judge (seeing the contempt of Gods law) that the greatest Den. 4. 8.
part of those which say there is nothing to that to remain and live long*
know not what they say: for they follow the steps which lead unto death. They
think there is no better thing to make them live long, then to be merry and
put away sorrow, and to accomplish this, to let slip the bridle unto
concupiscences and lusts of their flesh, the which will not be made obedient
to the law of God, and turn to him through true repentance. If they were
wise, they would love well the sorrow which proceeds of the obedience to the
co^mandeme^ts: for it brings no hurt, but great profit: and therefore S.
Paul repents him not, that he had made the Corinthians sorry. Likewise our
Savior promises comfort ^. Cor. 7. 8. ^ Mat. 5. 4.
to them which mourn. It seems to them also, that to obtain rest, and not
to be hindered from living in felicity and prosperity, there wants nothing
but the friendship of the world: the which cannot be obtained by showing to be
the true and faithful servant and child of God by obedience to his word.
But therein they are deceived: for S. James says, Know ye not that the
amity of the world is the enimitie of God? Likewise our savior warns Iam.
4. 4. John. 15. 18.
his disciples, not to be dismaide for the hatred of the world.

3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them on thy neck, and write them
upon the table of thine heart. 4 So shall thou find favor and good
understanding in the sight of God and man.
After that Solomon has generally warned us not to forget the law, to the
end that we might know how to follow his admonition, he deuideth the law
and commandments of God into two parts, that is to say into mercy and
truth. As also, this is then his commandment, that we believe in the name of
his 1. John. 3. 23
Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave commandment. Under
truth he comprehends all the honor and service that we owe unto God, as is
contained in the first table: and under mercy he comprehends what we owe to
our neighbors, as is commanded us in the second table. Herein we see the
summary of the law, whereunto agrees that which our Mat. 22. 37.
savior said to a Doctor. For albeeit Solomon makes not express mention of
the love of God, yet does he not altogether keep it secret when he
speaks of truth and mercy. For as we cannot be assured of Goods goodness
toward us, unless we love him: so can we not also be truly merciful unto
our neighbors, except we desire to obey God for that we love him. For God
requires of us such obedience to his law, De^t. 6. 5. 1^ 12.
as proceeds of love. Solomon in this summary would have us so attentive to
the law of God, that we should never suffer mercy and truth to forsake us:
But bind the^ ^on our neck. Wherein he uses three similitudes. First of al,
for to show us that we must go forward in truth and mercy, he likeneth
them unto a yoke fellow with whom a man must be co^pled, chiefly being in a
dangerous way, and may not suffer him to come dragging behind, or to go too
far before. For if we be forsaken of this fellowship, the spiritual thieves
and robbers will quickly assault us, and of ourselves we cannot save us from
their hands, but must miserably perish. Secondarily, for to teach us, how
we should work that this fellowship may not forsake us, he uses another
similitude, making this fellowship like unto a yoke that is put on the neck of
Oxen, and fast bound that it unloose not: and that is, when he admonishes us
to bind mercy and truth about our neck. Wherein he would that with a willing
mind we should submit ourselves unto the law of God: for he says not, let
us suffer to be bound unto this yoke: but that we ourselves should bind them
on our necks. And as the Oxen do never cast of the yoke from them, whereto
they are bound, but are compelled to remain under the same: even so must we
force ourselves to bear the yoke of our Lord, and continue under the same,
else we should be constrained to carry the yoke of sin, and so to be in the
devils bondage: as our Lord does well signify it in Matthew, Come unto me al
ye that are weary and laden, Mat. 11. 28
and I will ease you, etc. Thirdly, he likeneth our hearts unto the Arc of the
covenant, in the which were the tables of stone, wherein the law was written,
as God had commanded Moses. Even so least we forget the law, our hearts must be
the arc of mercy and Ex^. 25. 21.
truth, and never from thence to let them pass. But as the law was enclosed
within the arc, and yet Moses and the Priests ceased not to open the same
unto the people by preaching and holy living: even so we also must not have
the law of GOD in our hearts only (as also it is impossible) but both in work
and mouth, Solomon does well show it, when he gathers the law into mercy
and truth: for they cannot be in us, but they will be De^t. 11. 20.
seen when occasion is offered, and when we have opportunity, the which we
must seek: as Solomon does well show it, when he says, bind them on thy
neck, etc. Besides the former exposition it may be said, how Solomon does
admonish us to be merciful and faithful unto our neighbors: whereunto also
Saint Paul exhorts us, Wherefore cast of lying, and speak every man truth
unto his neighbor. And that we may ^phe. 4. 25.
go forward, he admonishes us to bind the law and the commandments on
our necks. For by them we shall be guyded unto mercy and truth: and without
them there cannot but be in us, al unmercifulness and cruelty, also allying
and unfaithfulness Furthermore, if we ascribe mercy and truth unto God, we
may say how Solomon does warn us, that if we would have Psalm. 117. ^.
God to continue his mercy toward us, and not make his promises void unto us,
we must bind his law and commandementes. upon our necks. Now albeeit that
these two last expositions contain truth, yet are they not so fit for the
line of Solomon's text, as the first: the which may be seen by that which is
gone before, when he counseled that the law should not be forgotten, and also
by that which follows when he commands, saying,

So shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
By faith we find favor before God, and also please him, as it is said of
Enoch. And after this sort we obtain understanding Heb. 11. 5.
which is very profitable to guide us to good learning. Through gentleness we
please men, and chiefly those whom we are gentle unto, exercising the works
of charity. Through this commandment here, which is like unto a promis, we
ought to be much stirred continually to think on the law of the Lord, and
to go forewarde in keeping of these commandments, assuring ourselves of his
goodness, and helping one another by charity: seeing that in so doing we are
promised favor and understanding, the which above al things are to be desired,
and nothing to be esteemed more. Now first of al, when favor is promised us,
for binding mercy and truth upon our necks, we must vnderstand^ that what
obedience soever we give unto the law of God, yet he cannot be our bondsman:
for albeeit we may deserve of men that they should be pleased with us, and
that they stand bound by our mercy showed toward them: yet we can never be so
faithful unto God, trusting in his goodness, but there will be some doutfulnesse,
distrust and incredulity mixed therewith, for the which we well deserve to be
forsaken of God. And indeed, we should be forsaken, except he made us find
favor in his sight. Likewise, though it were so that we were perfect in
faith, yet could we not boast ourselves to deserve, seeing all the strength we
have or may have, is the gift of God. Secondarily, the understanding that we
have by the word of God, which we keep by faith and obedience, is called good,
because it brings forth good fruits to the honor and glory of God, and to
the profit of ourselves and neighbors. Contrarily, the understanding that is
gotten by man's wit and natural reason, by doctrines and traditions of men,
cannot have this title of goodness. For though it be highly esteemed in the
world, yet since it is reproved of God, and by him counted foolishnes: we ought
to reject it as vain and unprofitable, yea as hurtful: for it comes of the 1.
Cor. 1. 3. 19 20. and 3. 19. Romans 8. 6.
flesh, the desire whereof is death. Therefore if we will avoid death, let us
not follow the wise worldlinges, but let us rather choose to be despised of
them as fools, so shall we be wise in Gods sight. Thirdly, when we are
commanded that through truth and mercy we should find favor and
understanding in the sight of God and man, it is first showed us that the
keeping of Gods commandments does not stand only in outward works, as
hypocrites do falsely believe* but even as God sees the heart and judges the
secret thoughts of men, herewith that our words and outward works are no whit
hid from him: so also, al our affections, purposes, counsels, thoughts and
minds are before Heb. 4. 12.
him. It follows, that if we will please and be wise before God, we must have
al our affections so ordered, that he be in no wise offended by the^, so that
with all our inward parts we should be given to meditate his law, and keep his
commandments. Further it is showed us, that as God has not created the
inward part of man only, but the visible and earthly body also: so he would
not have it unprofitable, but would that we should bestow it about his service:
not that he has need thereof, but look what we do through our bodies to the
edifying and profit of our neighbors, according to his word, he counts it
done unto himself. And this is the cause why Solomon would have us find favor
and good understanding Romans 12. 17.
before men, and that S. Paul counseleth us to procure things honest, not only
before God, but also before me^. The which seems to be very hard: for there
is no people so detestable before men, as they that are given to goodness.
Notwithstanding they find favor and understanding, in the sight of men, as
Solomon commands them, so much as they can, according to this holy word. For
even the ungodly which often do them hurt and wrong, are o^^rcome in their
consciences that they be just, and confess no les: as Pharao toward Moses and
the people of Israel: Saul toward David. Fourthly, albeit we must seek the
favor both of God and men, yet is it not to say, that it is lawful for us to
labor to please Gal. 1. 10. Mat. 6. 1.
men, or seek to be praised of them. Finally, since that through mercy and
truth we obtain favor in Gods sight, it follows that if we be infidels and
unmerciful, we deserve to be abhorred and counted fools both before God and
men, though by our carnal understanding, by our subtilties and enterprises we
obtain the favor of the world.

5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own
wisdom. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy ways.
To the end that we may the better know how to guide ourselves, Solomon
does expound the law unto us by parts, giving unto us diverse commandments.
And first of all, to the intent we should not be forsaken of truth, but
thereby might find favor before god: he would have us to trust in the Lord
whereby we should be assured he loves us as a good father does his children:
and therefore that he desires nothing but our prosperity and salvation, and
will not suffer us to perish. This assurance is given us by the word: the
which does set forth the good will of God toward us. Solomon saying thus,
Trust in the Lord, would have us to lay hold by faith upon the promises of
God, being certain that God will not, nor cannot go against them: for he is
the infallible truth: likewise that no power can let him to keep promis: for
he is the almighty, whose counsel shall stand for ever, and his whole will
shall be fulfilled. Now he shows us that it is Esa. 46. 10.
not enough to hear and talk, but he requires the heart. And he teaches us
that it is not lawful to apply our hearts to the lusts of our flesh and worldly
pleasures: for he requires the whole heart, saying, Trust in the Lord with all
thine heart. In this he teaches us that which Moses teaches in the two first
commandments, Ex. 20. 2. 3. 4*
Thus our hearts must not be parted to give one portion unto God, and the
other part some where else: that were to give a companion unto God, the which
he cannot abide. And because that diverse not esteeming the word of God, (the
which ought to be the wisdom and understanding of his children and
servants) do dream and forge in their brains divine services, whereby they
think to honor God, laboring much there abouts: Solomon to withdraw us from
this abuse and foolish presumption, does warn us that to trust in God with
all our hearts, we must not lean to our own wisdom: as Moses warns the
children of Israel. By this we may judge that there are Deu. 12. 8.
but a few which trust in the Lord as they ought: for the greatest part of the
world do set their hearts on other things then on God, and many also will
serve him after their own fancy. And this is through ignorance and contempt
of the word, that they fall into such beastly blockishnes, as S. Paul says,
For God also punishes Romans 1. 21.
their unthankfulness, in blinding and giving them up unto a reprobate mind.
Moreover, considering we cannot trust a man, except we love him, Solomon
exhorting us to trust in God, would have us to love him, as Moses says. Now
if we do thus love God, we will worship him in spirit and truth, and will call
upon Deu. 6. 5.
him, chiefly in our spiritual necessities, knowing that it is he only which
will and can provide for all our necessities. If we do truly know that he is
such a one, we will fear to offend him, and will rather suffer al miseries,
yea death it self, then to do any thing which might displease him. The trust
then that Solomon requires of us, imports a true knowledge of the goodness
and power of God toward us, whereby we are led to love him and fear him, to
woorship and call upon him. And when, all the heart is required theretoo, (for it
is the ruler of the words and works, even of all the body, the which is
immovable and dead without the heart,) it follows thereof that we do not
trust in the Lord, except we apply al our words and works, yea our whole
body to his service. Likewise when Solomon makes an Antithesis, setting our
wisdom against trust in God, we must Romans 6. 13. and 12. 1.
understand that the wise of this world have no trust in GOD: whereupon it
follows that they give him no obedience that pleases him.

6 In all thy ways acknowledge him. For the second^ commandment* Solomon
would that we should acknowledge GOD, not in one point only, but in all our
ways. For to understand the same commandment well, let us know that our
VVayes, are our thoughts, and affections, desires, wills, purposes, counsels,
enterprises, words and works, and whatsoever we do and suffer. We must in all these things acknowledge the Lord: that is to say, we should not think,
purpose no^ take any thing in hand, except we be sure that God guides al by
his spirit, If we speak that it should be as the 1. Pet. 4. 11.
words of God: if we do any works, that they should be as by the power
which God gives us, that he may be glorified in all things. To be short, let
God be our ruler and guide, working in us both the will and the deed,
according to his good pleasure: and Phi. 2. 1^.
by his direction let us employ ourselves about our salvation with fear and
trembling. Likewise if we suffer any afflictions, after what sort soever they
be, let us know that we have well deserved them for the offenses that we
continually commit against the Majesty of our good GOD, by whose hand we are
chastened, and not by other: and therefore we must receive his chastisementes
patiently, with thanks giving, in following Job and the Prophets, Thus doing
we shall acknowledge Job. 1. 21. Iam. 5. 10.
the Lord in all our ways. But if we do slack the bridle unto our
affections and lusts, we do not acknowledge the Lord, but deny him, and
blaspheme his holy name, and profane it, so much as lies in us. And
forasmuch as there is none so righteous which can boaste that he
acknowledges thus the Lord, therefore it is necessary for us all, to lay our
mouths to the ground, and not to take the boldness to lift up our face on
high: but that with all fear and humbleness truly to confess innumerable
faults, and to pray unto GOD that he would not enter into judgment with us,
but be merciful unto us poor sinners, granting us grace, that we may
acknowledge him in all our ways. If we call upon him thus, in truth and in
fear, he will not suffer us to go out of the way, and to wander in the
broad way of damnation: but as he promises us by Solomon he will direct our
paths to bring us to life. This commandment ought to be greatly esteemed of
us, considering the promise which is added thereunto. For there is none that
delights to go astray out of his way, except he be out of his wits: but
rather will take a guide to lead him, and to carry him the right way, and
spare not to give him money to be led the right way. Therefore we must be
very careful to acknowledge the Lord in our ways, and we shall not wander
out of them, for we shall have a trusty Guide, who offers himself unto us
freely, as Solomon does show us saying: And he shall direct thy ways. Solomon
is not witness alone of this promise, but also his Father David before him.
Gracious and righteous is Psalm. 25. 8.
the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. And before this, Moses
was a witness thereof, When he promises the Deu. 28.
blessing of God in all things unto them which obey him. And then because of
this promise added, we ought to have the commandment in great price, we must
also be diligent to pray, Show me thy ways O Lord, and teach me thy
paths. For albeit the chief direction of our paths is, to acknowledge the
Lord in Psalm. 25. 4.
all his ways, yet the promise does teach us that it comes not of our own
power, nor by free will, that we acknowledge the Lord in all our ways, to walk
in the right way, and in safety, but it comes of the only grace of God. If
it remained in us, it should not be needeful for God to make us any such
promise, but it should be superfluous: the which we ought not to say nor to
think. We must therefore humble ourselves, and say with Jeremy, O Lord, I
know, that the way of man, is not of himself: ^er. 10. 23.
neither is it in man to walk and to direct his steps. If in thus
acknowledging, we pray continually with David, Lead me, O Psalm. 5. 8.
Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: Make thy way plain
before my face* And again, Teach me thy way O Lord, and lead me in a right
path, because of mine enemies. Psalm. 27. 11.
And albeit we have many imperfections, yet will God accept our acknowledging
for perfect. Therefore let us acknowledge all things to depend upon God, and
take nothing in hand without his will: Let us not be like unto them which say,
Let us go to Iam. 4. 13.
day and to morrow unto such a Town, and dwell there a year, etc.

7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: but fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
8 So health shall be unto thy navel, and marrowe unto thy bones. In this third
commandment Solomon does expound unto us, how we should acknowledge the
Lord in all our ways: and for to do it, he gives us three instructions. The
first is, Be not wise in thine own eyes. Whereby he would that we should
renounce our wisdom, and that we should not think to be able for to govern
and guide ourselves in our ways. The second is, Fear the Lord. Whereby he
would not have us to follow the affections of our flesh, the which does
cause us to despise God, and to stand up against him: and that renouncing our
will, we should give obedience unto the Lord, and with all fear and reverence
wholly to submit ourselves unto his will. The third is, and depart from evil:
whereby he would that we should cast of and forsake al vices and sins: that
we should be clean from al filthiness both flesh and Spirit. We do not
acknowledge the Lord in our ways, except we follow these three instructions,
the which depend the one of the other. For if we think that we be able to
govern ourselves, we make no account to obey God, and to reverence him:
whereupon follows, that we give ourselves unto al evil. But, contrarily, if
we feel our unableness indeed, we become humble, and do fear to offend
God. Therefore to acknowledge the Lord in our ways, we must take heed that
we walk not after the affection of our flesh: for it is God his enemy, it is
not subject unto his law, neither can be: whereupon follows, that it can not
be given but to do evil, from the Romans 8. ^.
which we must depart through the fear of God, but not otherwise. And in this
holy fear stands the true acknowledging of the Lord, and not in the fear
to be dampened, the which holds us captive under men's traditions. Now first of
al he says not simply, be not wise, for he should gain say himself,
seeing that in the beginning of this book he affirms that it is made for to
know Wisdom, etc. the which he commends greatly. And also in forbidding
simply to be wise, he should against say Moses, from whom he has drawn
this doctrine, in diverse places. And he sharply reproves the people of their
folly, saying, Do ye so reward the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?
Deuteronomy. 4. 6. Deuteronomy. 32. 6.
etc. Again, in the 28. verse, For they are a nation void of counsel,
neither is there any understanding in them, etc. So he does not forbid us to
be wise: but he shows us that there is a certain kind of Wisdom which
we must eschew and detest, which is not properly Wisdom; but arrogancy,
pride, and presumption. The declaration is, when he says, in thine own
eyes: Wherein he teaches us that it ought to suffice us, that God allows us
as wise, and that we should not think ourselves to 1. Cor. 3. 18.
be wise, but to become fools, that we may be made wise before God. We
must be wise therefore, following that which we know to be good by the word
of God: But we must not have this opinion of ourselves, that we are wise: for
such an opinion would make us disobedient and rebels against God, and would
engender in us a great contempt of our neighbors. In this we should not
acknowledge the Lord, neither would he direct our paths, but would let us
wander astraye. Secondly, for to show us how we should not be wise in our
own sight, he exhorts us unto fear, and not simply unto fear: for the
servants and children of God have a promise (here above in the 1. and 33.
verse) that they shall dwell in safety, and shall rest without astonishment of
evil. So they Pro^. 1. 33.
shall not need to fear any thing which may happen to them i^ this world: and
also they shall not need to fear damnation. We must thus understand it: for
Solomon sets this promise against the former threatening: but he moves us
unto the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of knowledge, as here
above where has been showed what this fear is, and Pro. 1. ^*
wherein it stands. Thirdly, after he has moved us to fear the Lord, he
bids us to depart from evil. Wherein he gives us to understand, that when
men live without the fear of God, then there reigns nothing but evil: and
also that where there reigns nothing but evil, in that place there is no
fear of God.

8 So health shall be unto thy Nauel. As it is not enough for a way faring man to
be well directed, least he go out of the right way: but also for to walk, is
required that he be whole, and have his health and strength, and that he
have wherewithal to be refreshed: otherwise he can not perform his voyage,
but should be constrained to stay and tarry: So Solomon thinks it not
enough to promise, that if we acknowledge the Lord in our ways, that he will
direct our paths: but he appoints us an ordinance very healthful,
commanding us to follow it in our ways: to wit, Be not wise, etc. The same
being given, he promises us that we shall be in good health to walk in our
paths, when he says, health shall be, etc. Through this promise we should
be earnestly moved to follow his ordinance. For there is none of us but if
he were assured that the potion or receipt of the Physician should be
healthful, but that he would follow it, though it were troublesome and hard.
For we are wont to say, There is nothing but I will do it, so that I may
recover health: By a more stronger reason, when the spiritual Physician does
bring us the heavenly Commandment, and that he promises us health and
spiritual strength, whereby we shall live, not a short time, but for ever: we
should be ready to receive and to follow this commandment, even with
greater diligence and love, then we do the earthly commandments: by so
much as the heavenly and spiritual things are more excellent then the earthlye
and corporal, and as we ought to prefer our souls before our bodies.

And albeeit that Solomon in this promise does not express but the nauill and
bones, which are only corporal parts: yet we must not think it strange or
amiss, if we say, that he promises us health and strength to our souls:
for as Abraham and the good old Fathers had the promise of the land, and by
this promise did assure themselves of the heavenly kingdom: even so when God
by his word does promise us health of body, we should be assured of the same
for our souls, and not to care for our bodies, but in as much as so far as
we may, apply them to the service of God. For as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
dwelt in the land of Canaan but as strangers, and yet God deceived them not,
but fulfilled his promise, by preparing them a City, and receiving them into
it: even so, although he send often unto the faithful, diseases and
afflictions, yet he ceasseth not to accomplish toward them this promise of
bodily health and strength, in taking care of their souls. For healing and
fortifiyng their souls, he forsakes not their bodies, but gives them health
and strength, so much as he knows to be expedient. Thus contenting ourselves
with such health as it pleases God to send us, how short so ever it be,
let us know that God is true in his promises, and let us not envy the health
and strength of the wicked: for as they have no promise of bodily health, so
have they not of the spiritual health, from the which they are wholly deprived,
though they enjoy the corporal. Now the^ since that by promise we have health
and strength, we should be ready to give thanks to GOD therefore, and to
acknowledge what his gift and benefit is, and not that we can deserve it
through our good rule and government* albeeit that it is necessary to govern
ourselves well, if we will reteyne health. For if by going forward in excess,
we think to keep health and strength, this were but to tempt GOD, who
commands us sobriety and temperance. And our Lord Jesus says, Take Luke.
21. 34.
heed to yourselues, lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeting
and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and least that day come on you
unawares.

Moreover let us know that GOD does bestow his blessings how, to whom, and
when it pleases him, and can take them from whom he will: neither is it
laweful for any man to say, Why do thou so? Therefore, if we be afflicted
with sickness, with feebleness and weakness, let us take good heed that
we murmr not, neither to spite ourselves, nor lament through impatience: for
it were to accuse GOD of vn^ighteousnesse and cruelty. But even as God does
promise us health and strength, if we be not wise in our own opinion: so
when we be sick and weak, we ought to know that we well deserve to be so
afflicted, because we have provoked the wrath of God against us, by offending
in pride, rebellion, and unrighteousness. Therefore let us impute our
sickenesses unto our sins, by following the good old Fathers, who in their
sicknesses felt that God was angry with them for their offenses: as it
appears by David, and also by King Ezechias. And albeit Psalm. 6. Psalm. 38.
Esai. 38.
that God does justly afflict us with diseases, and that it is not lawful for
us to complain of him, yet since he does promise us health, he would have
us to ask it of him, and will grant it us: as we may know by the witnesses
before alleged: and also our Lord Jesus does teach us it, commanding us to
ask our daily bread, whereof health is a part. Mat. 6. 11.


9 Honor the Lord with thy riches, and with the first fruits of all thine
increase. 10 So shall thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall
burst with new Wine.
The fourth Commandment has respect unto that which God has ordained in his
law. Exo. 23. ^^. and 25. 2.


The first of the first fruits of thy land thou shall bring into the house of
the Lord thy God.

And again, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they receive an offering
for me: of every man, whose heart gives it freely, ye shall take the offering
for me. And in the 1, and 2. Chapters of Leuiticus. And therefore at the first
sight it may appear that this Commandment does nothing apperteyne unto us,
but only to the Jews, till the time that Jesus Christ came and appeared in
the flesh. For, if they will receive Jesus Christ, they have the truth of the
figures and ancient shadows* But Jesus Christ, who is the true Expositour of
the law, and the fulfiller thereof (and not the destroyer) does show us
well, that this Commandment ought always to be observed of us: for he
says, And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily, Mat. 25. 40.
I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it to me. And to this purpose Saint Paul does
stir them up, saying: I was filled, Phi. 4. 18.
after that I had received of Epaphroditus that which came from you, with an
odor that smells sweet, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God. This
is the custom which is acceptable unto God. Deui. 26. 11. Mat. 12. 7. Heb. 13.
16.


Then for to obey this Commandment, we must be merciful, in helping the
need^e with that which is ou^s, as Solomon expressly teaches us here, saying,
With thy riches. We must not give alms at the cost of another, nor of our
neighbors goods, as do men and maid servants, and hyrelinges: as do the
covetous, Usurers, and thieves, which to the hurt of their neighbors labor to
be rich, and of the spoil do give alms, whereby they do no honor to the
Lord. For as in old time the Lord refused the Sacrifices of such people,
even so the Esa. 1. 11.
alms given of robbery, do not please him. In which number are to be
comprised the same of Priests, Monks, and Nuns, who under color of long
prayers, and of their goodly service, said so devoutly, do devour and
swallow up the houses of simple ones, which are easily to be deceived. What so
ever such folks do, is abominable before God: for he can not love that
which comes from iniquity. And that which is gotten otherwise then God
commands, is robbery and theft, yea and murder. And therefore, let us not
apply ourselves to nothing more then to obey the word of God: for it alone
shall give enough in to our hands to bestow* But when we hear that it is
said, Psalm. 24. 1. and ^^. 8.
The earth is the Lords, and all that therein is: and again, Hear my people,
I will not reprove thee, for thy sacrifices, etc: here may a question be
moved, whether it be lawful to count and call that ours which we possess.
Aunsweare, That we neither have nor can deserve that any thing should be
ours: otherwise our Lord shall not need to teach us to ask of God that he
would give us our daily bread* but all the creatures are ours, and may use
them as ours, with thanks giving, though they be not due to us, and this comes
to us by the goodness of God, which gives us all things abundantly 1. Tim.
6. 17.
for to use: and thus he does make them ours: using toward us a wonderful
fatherly goodness, that we acknowledging therein his great liberality, should
not be grieved to honor the Lord with them, by distributing them gladly and
liberally unto our needy brethren and neighbors. For it is said, God loves
a cheerful giver. Thus doing, so much it shall want that we should need,
that God will make us to abound in all 2. Cor. 9. ^.
things: as Saint Paul does show us consequently, saying, God is also of
power to make you abound in all gifts. We must also spend our substance
reasonably, as stewardes, sparing nothing where necessity requires. After
this sort we shall honor God with our substance, the which though it be
parted in many parts, and that it be eaten and consumed, yet shall we have
always with sufficiency great abundance, as Solomon does promise us, saying,

10 So shall thy barnes be filled. This is that which Moses Deu. 28. 5.
promises, Blessed shall thy basket and thy store be. Again, The Lord shall
command the blessing to be with thee in thy and 88.
store houses, and in all that thou set thine hand unto, etc.

Notwithstanding we must not judge that Jesus Christ does forbid us, to
gather into our barnes, when he says, Be not Mat. 26. 25.
careful for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, etc: but
only the over great desire, and thought, full of distrust. Moreover, when by
the promise of God, we do abound in wealth, we must understand that the
abundance is good and profitable: there remains nothing but to use them well*
For to do the same, we must not be like the rich man which said, Soul* thou
have much goods laid up for many years, etc. Neither to Luke 12. 19. and 16*
19. 1. Tim. 6. 7.
the rich glutton which was clothed in purple, etc: But we must follow the
counsel of Saint Paul, who says, Charge them that are rich in this world,
that they be not high minded, etc. If we use them otherwise, we do not
honor the Lord with our substance, and deserve that God should make us beg
ou^ bread with great shame, and that we should suffer many necessities and
calamities. Furthermore, though they which honor the Lord with their
substance, do often suffer much poverty, it is not therefore to be said,
that God does not truly fulfill his promise, so much as is expedient for
them: for it ought to content us, that he knows better what is profitable
and necessary for us, then we ourselves.

11 My son, refuse not the chastening of the Lord, neither be grieved with
his correction. 12 For the Lord corrects him, whom he loves, even as the
father does the child in whom he delights.
Such as are weak amongst the children of God, when they see things to be
as it were confounded, in such wise that they which walk uprightly are
afflicted, and the unruly to prosper: they are tempted with impatience, even
almost to be led to follow the wicked, that they might be partakers of their
prosperity, as it appears in the 73. Psalm. Solomon resists such
temptation, Psalm. 73. 2.
when he says, My son, refuse not, etc. In this fifth commandment he
aduertiseth the children of God, that if in this world they suffer pouerties
and afflictions, that they should receive them from the hand of God, who does
nothing but justly and necessarily: and therefore that they should receive the
same with all patience knowing, that thereby God does correct and rebuke them,
as ^. These. 1. 5.
they have deserved, to the end they should acknowledge their faults, and to
endeavor more and more to amend and go forward from good to better. But
albeit it is profitable for us to be afflicted, as the holy Ghost does teach
us by Solomon, who commands that we should not refuse correction: yet our
flesh, which is impacient, and desires nothing but his pleasures and ease,
does tempt us to reject the yoke of the Lord, discouraging and making us
despair, as though God persecuted us, to destroy us, and as though he hated us
like an enemy and adversary. The Devil also labors to put the like into
our heads: and of ourselves, we are easy to believe him, and of the otherside
we see in the Scripture, the thretnings that god sets out against the
wicked, and the affliction that he has sent to destroy them. So, when we are
afflicted, we are temped to judge that God hates us. They which are impatient,
and care nothing but for their belly, do thus blaspheme against God. Now to
the end that we may be turned away from such thoughts, Solomon at the
beginning uses a gentle and loving appellation, saying: My son, warning us
thereby, that albeit the punishments and corrections of God are intolerable to
our flesh, yet we should understand he handeleth us as a good father does
his children: and therefore, that we must not be grieved to be chastened of
his hand. And not content here with* for better to withstand the foresaid
temptations, he gives the reason wherefore we must not refuse the correction
of the Lord, saying,

12 For the Lord corrects. If we receive this reason as true, as it is
indeed, we shall understand that the chastenings, corrections, calamities and
afflictions that God does send us, are witnesses that he loves us, and that
we please and like him well, and that it is but for our salvation he chasteneth
us. We must not then iugde nor say, that God does hate us, when we are
afflicted: but rather the contrary. A man might say that the reason of Solomon
is not sufficient enough to lead us, not to be grieved in our afflictions: for
we see that without difference God punishes as well the reprobate as the elect,
and by his punishments he declares more often his anger than his love. Also
the Scripture Eccles. 9. 1.
speaks so, and experience does confirm it. I answer, when the faithful
are threatened with any punishment, and also suffer the same: they receive it
from the hand of God, and know that it is their Father which chasteneth them
for their wealth, and therein he shows his fatherly love. Contrarily,
forasmuch as the reprobate do not know that they are governed by Gods hand
when they are afflicted, they more often judge that it comes by chance, and
being strangers from God, and his family, they understand not that the hand
of God can touch them. Let us ^hen remember and think that when we are
chastened, we cannot feel the taste of the love toward us, except we
certainly hold that the afflictions which we suffer, are fatherly
corrections, whereby he corrects our sins. The reprobate can never think
so: for their thoughts stray and fly hither and thither. Also, Saint Peter
says, For the time is come, that judgment begins at the house of GOD.
Wherefore albeit, that 1. Pet. 5. 17
indifferently God strikes strangers so well as them of his householde, yet
he reaches his hand toward his, in such wise as he shows to have a
special care of them. Notwithstanding, the true solution of the former
objection, is, That whosoever knows, and is certain that GOD does chasten
him, he ought immediately thus to think, that the correction is sent unto
him, because GOD loves him. For when the faithful perceive that GOD
intermedleth in their afflictions, they have a certain earnest of his good
will: For if he did not love them, he would not be careful of their
salvation. And therefore the Apostle having alleged this exhortation, with the
reason, for to show that it is profitable for us to be chastened, concludes,
If we endure chastening, GOD offers himself unto you as unto sons. But it
might be asked whether it is Heb. 12. 7.
necessary that all they whom GOD loves, should be corrected, rebuked, and
chastened: and whether he do hate all those which he corrects not.
Answer, His corrections and chasteninges are after diverse sorts: for he
corrects, and rebukes us both inwardly and outwardly. His inward
corrections and reprehensions are, When God sets before us the heinousness
of our sins, and for them he does astonishe and fear us with his sharp
judgment, the which we could not avoid, if GOD should deal with us
according as we have deserved: And also of ourselves we cannot hope to be
exempted from that intolerable judgment, when we know we have offended the
goodness of our dear and precious GOD, and have provoked his wrath and anger,
his (I say) who is a consuming fire. Having this knowledge, we weep and
lament in our hearts, we are grieved and displeased to have offended so great
a fatherly goodness, so high a divine Majesty: and in such grief we run
unto his mercy. Nevertheless, let us note that such corections are necessary
for all Gods children: and whosoever is exempted from them, cannot be certain
that God loves him.

The outward corrections are diseases, poverty, hunger, cold, persecutions,
and other miseries, and afflictions, as comes from without, the which are
common both to the children of God, and to the wicked. And it is necessary,
that when they happen to the faithful, they should know, it is GOD which
does chasten them, because he loves them, and will save them: and for this
cause they ought not to refuse them, nor be vexed at them: but to bear them
with joy and patience. Likewise when God ceasseth to examine them without, and
gives them a refreshing, as he has done the old Fathers, they ought not to
think that God hates them: but being in peace and rest, ought to thank God,
and be always ready, looking to receive of his hand what it pleases him to
send: beseeching him, that in prosperity he would not suffer them to fall
away by slacking the bridle to the lusts of their flesh, to live in ease and
pleasures of this world: and in adversity to give them strength and
constancy to obey and bear them: not doing as the wicked, which know not
that all things come from the hand of GOD. Such praying is very necessary
for all the faithful: For if God leave us too ourselves in prosperity, we
shall quickly forget him and give ourselves to the desires of the flesh: and
in adversity we shall despair in him, murmr and set naught by him, yea and
shall utterly renounce and forsake him. We have many and sundry examples
thereof in the Scripture, as in Caine, Saul, and others.

13 Blessed is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets
understanding. 14 For the merchandise thereof, is better than the merchandise
of silver, and the gain thereof is better than gold. 15 It is more precious
than pearls: and all things that thou can desire, are not to be compared
unto her. 16 Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand,
riches and glory. 17 Her ways are ways of pleasure, and all her paths
prosperity. 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her, and
blessed is he that reteineth her.
Solomon therefore to make us more and more attentive unto wisdom, does
attribute to a wiseman, that which every one of us greatly desires, that is,
that he pronounces him Blessed. Now how he is blessed, we might have learned
by the promises whereby Solomon has labored heretofore for to draw us unto
wisdom, and may yet understand it hereafter, by the reason that he will give,
to show how the wise man is blessed, and by the promises that the will add.
But to pronounce that the wise man is blessed, Solomon uses a Circumlocution
and comparison. The Circumlocution stands in this, that he says not, blessed
is the wise man: But, Blessed is the man that finds, etc. And he uses the
comparison, in this, that he makes the wise man like to a man grown rich by
his labor. For as the man that is careful in laboring to find riches and
treasures, and having found, does take them for himself, and seaseth upon
them, is judged rich: even so he (which by yielding himself attentive to the
word of God, gets wisdom, and abides therein, by keeping the
commandments of the Lord) is wise, and as the rich man judges himself, and
is thought of the world to be blessed: even so the wise man is assured that
he is blessed before God. Now albeit the wise and the rich are here compared
together, yet it is not to say, that the blessedness of the one is like and
equal to the other: for the riches that are gotten by wisdom, do not
change, but from good to better: therefore the wise man is blessed for ever,
and without end: And as the goods of this world do consume and are
transitory, so also the rich man is not blessed through his riches, but for a
certain time. What comparison then soever there be, yet is there great odds
between them, the which ought to give us to understand, unto which of the two
we must be attentive: that is to say, unto wisdom, to the which since the
Scripture does attribute blessedness, it follows therefore that in riches
and in all things else of this world, there is nothing but cursednesse when
they are possessed without wisdom. Jesus Christ our Lord does well show it
us in the sixth of Luke. The rich man Luke. 6. 24. and 12. 20. and 16. 23.
spoken of in Luke has truly felt it. Now wisdom is the gift of God, and
the blessedness also which comes thereof. Whereupon it follows, that the
wise man will not rejoice in any thing he has, as though he had it of
himself, but will confess that all comes from God, with praise and prayers
and thanksgiving. And since the gifts of God and his calling are without
repentance, he need not fear to fall into cursednesse to perish therein:
but may have this assurance, that if he stumble or fall, God will hold him up
with his hand that he shall not be bruised nor broken, but be blessed
everlastingly. Forasmuch also as they which find wisdom, are blessed, it
follows that the foolish are cursed. And forasmuch as there is no other
means to be wise, but by hearing of Gods word, it follows that the Papists
seek for nothing but for cursednesse: when not only they contemn the word,
and will not suffer it to be purely preached, but also persecute them which
preach it, and receive it, and labor to destroy the books that are
replenished with the holy and sound doctrine of God.

Now Solomon, to give us to understand, who is the man that has found
wisdom, adds, And the man that gets, etc. Therefore if we will find
wisdom, and be blessed, let us not be like the Horse and Mule, which want
reason: but let Psalm. 32. 9.
us get unto ourselves understanding by the reading of the Scriptures, by the
hearing of the word, beseching god that it may please him to illuminate and
conduct us according to his promise: I will instruct thee, and teach the in the
way, that thou shall go, and I Psalm. 32. 9.
will guide thee with mine ^ie* If we desire truly to be blessed, and to get
the true riches, we m^^t thus do, that is to say, find wisdom and get
understanding.

14. 15* For the merchandise thereof is better: There is no state in the world
that is so much occupied as merchandise: and look how much as one merchandise
is thought to bring more profit than another, so much the more is it desired
of many: and they that get most by it, are counted most blessed. And therefore
Solomon willing to induce us unto wisdom, and to give a reason why the wise
man is blessed, compares wisdom unto merchandise, and does magnify it
above all precious and pleasant things to be wished in this world. And
because he makes this comparison, we must consider wherein wisdom is like
unto merchandise. First of al to occupy and deal with merchandise, it is
requisite that the Merchant be not slothful and negligent, but watchful and
diligent. The like is required in wisdom, as we have seeene here before in
the second Chapter. Pro. 2. 4.
Likewise our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles teaching us the true
wisdom, do warn us to watch: for we be environed and compassed with
thieves and robbers, which labor for nothing but to destroy us: as the false
teachers, the devils and our flesh. Secondarily, the merchandise that ought
not to remain shut up, but to be put unto sale, that it may help them that
have need thereof: even so wise men ought too make profession of Matthew. 5. 14
Matthew. 25.
their wisdom by good doctrine and by good works, as it is said in the
parable of the talentes. Thirdly, as the mercha^ts do increase by occupiyng,
and become rich by selling and buing: even so they which labor to profit in
wisdom, shall abound: For whosoever Mat. 13. 12.
has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But there are
some differences: whereof the first is, that if we have Pro. 2. 6. Esaias. 55.
1. Iam. 1. 5. Mat. 6. 19. Iam. 5. 2.
need of merchandise, we must dearly buie it of the owners: but the Lord
gives wisdom freely to them which need the same: as it has been said
heerebefore, and in James, and Esaias. The second is, the merchandise may be
stolen, and also wax rotten: but wisdom is everlasting. Thirdly, the gain
of merchandise is but to maintain the body for a while: but the gain of
wisdom is the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life, which the wise man
shall possess for ever. It is then true that the merchandise of wisdom is
better and more certain: but few men believe it, because they are more busied
about thinge^ earthly, than heavenly: and they also to whom this merchandise
is every day freely presented and offered, make no great account thereof.
Wherefore the merchants of this world which take so great pain for things
that perish and vanishe away, and yet cost them very dear, shall be their
judges at the last day. But if we would not then have them to be our judges,
we must take them for our masters and teachers, learning of them to guide
ourselves unto spiritual and heavenly things, with such diligence care and
earnest affection as they follow carnal and worldly things. Mat. 13. 44.
Now we must acknowledge the great kindness of our GOD, who yielding to our
rudeness, does teach us by things, most common Luke. 19. 1^.
and familiar in the world. And when it so comes to pass, that we love, or
atleast wise, judge that we should love the better things, and that we
would be very loath too make the holy Ghost a liar, who has spoken by
Solomon: the merchants which say and count themselves Christians, should not be
like these asses. or rather dogs and hogs, which had rather esteem the
te^porall merchandise above the wisdom of God: which labor to gain a penny
to their purse, than to hear any good instruction by the word of God, and
take it for a troubling of their head, when a man speaks to them of God: and
also think, and make themselves believe that since they are merchantes, they
need not understand what belongs to God, and that it is enough for them to
know how to order and maintain their shop. We may gather of this comparison
(as the truth is) that it is lawful for to use precious ^hinges: for also
they are not created of God without cause: but they that use the^ ought to be
very careful not to exceed measure.

16 Length of days: There is no merchandise in the world how good soever it
is, nor pearls how precious and pleasant soever they be, that can assure us to
live long: but co^trarily the greatest merchants, and they that possess the
precious and pleasant things to the eye, and in the judgment of the
worldlinges, are they that most fear to die: and also their death is more
wished than others, and it happens oftentimes that some lie in wait for
their lives, and labor to rob and to kill them, for to spoil them of that
they have. This is one of the miseries belonging to great merchantes and rich
men of the world, that look what they fear, does happen unto them, even
after their death, and cannon obtain their desire, but are deprived of it for
ever. The merchandise of wisdom is far otherwise, for whosoever does enjoy
it, is assured to live long, as Solomon does affirm unto us by
Circumlocution, saying: Length of days is in her right hand: and herein he
compares wisdom unto a strong man, that has his right hand well armed and
fenced with good warlike weapon^ to defend their lives which are under him,
and in his service. Whereupon it appears that the man which finds wisdom
is blessed, and that his merchandise is better than the same of the merchants
of this world, which are never satisfied, and at the end do not enjoy all that
they have gotten. But it might be said tha^ some prove, and have tried, that
the wisest live not lo^gest, and there Genesis 4. 8. Genesis 12. 12. Exo. 2. 14. Genesis
32. 7 1. Sam. 19.
has been some which have not been assured of their lives. Abel died before
his Father: Abraham feared the Egiptians: Moses also feared after he had slain
the Egyptian: Jacob feared when he knew that his brother Esau came to meet
him: And David feared to stand before Saul. As touching the Prophets and
Apostles, some of them were slain in the flower of their age, etc. Answer,
That the first part of this objection has been handled and Pro 2. 21.
resolved here before in the 2. Chapter. Concerning the second part, the
answer is, That the ancient and holy Fathers doubted not but their days were
numbered, and determined before God, and were assured there was no power in the
world, how mighty soeue^ it were, that could shorten them: but because they
knew no^ the number, and would not tempt God, they sought by all means to
preserve this life, which they knew they had of Gods gift: And yet, in so much
as they were weak men, like other, their flesh rebelled against their spirit,
so that their assurance was not so perfect, but that it was coupled with
doubtfulnesse and distrust. For as it is said in the Galathians, The flesh
lusts against the spirit, and Gal. 5. 17.
the spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary one to another. Now
forasmuch as the length of days is in the right hand of wisdom, it
follows that what prosperity and ease soever we have in this world, if we
be void of wisdom, we do not live, but are in death, Contrarily, what
misery and adversity soever we suffer, yet if we have found wisdom and
do get her unto us, death has no power over us, but we do live, the which
shall never be taken from us. The worldlings do scorn and laugh at this: and
yet for all the wisdom we have, our flesh, which is of a vicious and corrupt
nature, does stir and tempt us to believe the contrary. For we see that
the wisest men are most commonly poorest, and that there is no count made of
them, but are a reproach to the world, and are persecuted: and when we want
the riches and honors of this world, we esteem not this to be life, but
pain and death. And it is commonly said, that it is better to live ten years
with ease, than fifty in pain. Thus, after the opinion of the world, and
fantasy of the flesh, it is better to follow the trade of merchandise, or some
other worldly means to become rich, for to live easily, and have honor, and
so to live but a while; then to follow wisdom, and live poorly and in contempt
a long time. For this cause then, that the contempt of the world, the moving
and fantasy of our flesh, should not turn us away from Wisdom. Solomon
does show there is no pain in the life of wise men, but that they live in
riches and honor: for he says that in her left hand are riches and glory.
Wherein he compares Wisdom unto a liberal rich man, that bears a good will
toward the needy, and does not despise his tenants, and underlings, but
carries his purse in his hand, ready to empty it, for the comfort of the
poor: and does not torment his inferiors by contempt, but does honor them,
doing his duty toward them. Such is Wisdom toward them that find her:
for they that are truly wise, what poverty so ever they suffer, in the
feeling of the flesh, yet are they never empty, but have enough, the which
they prefer unto all worldly riches, and are contented therewith: for also it
is much better. And moreover, though they be in contempt of the world, yet are
they assured that God does not despise them, Psalm. 37. 1^.
but by his mercy he greatly esteems them: and therefore they esteem and
love contempts better then all the riches of the world. As S. Paul witnesses
of himself: and the Apostle testifies of Moses: and also our Lord would have
us to rejoice in such contempts. 1. Cor. 4. 10. Hebr. 11. 25. Mat. 5. 11.
And when Solomon does attribute a right hand and a left hand unto wisdom,
we must take good heed from thinking any carnal thing of it, as if Wisdom
had hands: but by this kind of speech Solomon does teach us that the wise are
assured to live long, and that so much as shall be expedient for their spiritual
health, and that they shall have goods and honors enough where with they shall be
contented, tarying and looking by this promise, to obtain a life, riches, and
honors, permanent for ever: the which the richest of the world can not promise
themselves.

17 Her ways are ways of pleasure. When Merchants and other worldly
passengers walk in the fields, they are glad when they find fair way, and
in the same do meet with such things as are pleasant and joyful: they greatly
desire not to be stayed nor hindered in their journey, but to go at their ease
without any disturbance: the which sometime they miss. For as the state which
they profess can not assure them of that, so also oftentimes they meet with
that which is contrary to their desire: whereat they are grieved and wax weary
of their way, and are vexed through the evil mischances, and find no rest in
their minds. The wise are not after this sort: for wheresoever they follow
Wisdom, they find pleasure, and their affairs does prosper well: whereupon
they have great quietness in mind: even in the most hardest afflictions that can
happen in the world, in following this counsel, My brethren count it for an
exceeding great joy, when ye fall into diverse temptations. For they Iam. 1. 2.
^am. 1. 12.
do well know that they are blessed that endure temptation, etc. And
therefore, by what way so ever they must pass to follow Wisdom, yet are they
cheereful and merry: Therefore the wise are not like unto diverse rich men, who
although they abound in worldly wealth, yet on which side so ever they turn
them, nothing does please them, they have neither joy nor comfort, nor rest
in their minds. If then we would be happy, let us not follow the trade of
worldly rich merchants, but let us lift up our minds after wisdom, and she will
enrich us, and give us sufficient and contented minds: she will pleasure us,
and deliver us from all sorrow and melancholy: she will give us rest, and quiet
minds, and will make us prosper in all things: and that not for a little space
of time only, but all the days of our life, the which shall not be short, as
Solomon does affirm the same unto us, saying, that length of days is in the
right hand of Wisdom: and also does affirm here after, saying,

18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her, etc. A tree of life,
that is to say, a tree whose fruit is of so great virtue and goodness, that it
gives life to them which eat thereof: not like the trees which way faring men
find in the fields, whose fruit if they eat, their thirst is alayed and they
refreshed for a little while: but they that eat of the fruit of this tree, are
quickened, for never to dye: and it is therefore called the tree of life.
Wherein Solomon compares wisdom unto the tree of life (whereof Mofes
speaks in Gene.) and does put a difference between Genesis 2. 9. and 3, 22.
24. Genesis 2. 9. 17. and 33.
the tree of knowledge of good and evil, whereof also Genesis speaks. For as
the tree of life was given unto man for to assure him that he should live
ever, and by the gift and promise of God it had this effect and virtue to make
man live, and to preserve him from death: so does Wisdom give eternal life
unto those which lay hold on her with trust in the goodness of God, by
keeping of his commandments. And herein it differs from the tree of
knowledge of good and evil, whose fruit man eating, brought death, into the
world, and deprived himself, and all his posterity of life. We must then take
this tree of life, and hold it by Faith, and obedience to the word of the
Lord, and not desire any thing that he forbids, and which is not
acceptable unto him, as we are taught by his law and his Gospel. Thus doing
we shall be happy: as Solomon concludes, saying, And blessed is he that
reteyneth her: This particle and, is as much as then: as if he did say, The^
blessed is he, etc. He says not, blessed is he which is counted amongst wise
men, and deferreth himself to their Wisdom: but he says, Blessed is every
man that reteineth her himself, and lives thereby: as in the world they will
not judge him happy that suffers himself to dye with hunger in the midst of
his goods, and will only content himself to see others eat, and wonder at
them that eat and satisfy their hunger. As such people are right worthy to
be esteemed foolish and mad, and deserve to dry and fall away: even so also
are they worthy which content themselves only to esteem well of wise men, and
wonder at them. With such kind of people is popery s^uffed, and ^here is no
small number of them, besides in other places. Whereof it follows, that the
world is full of cursed people, and that the number of the blessed is very
small: for of ten thousand, hardly shall one be found that will take hold of
this tree of life, and retain her to refresh himself with her fruits, and to
enjoy her reuenew. The world is wonderfully out of taste: it had rather eat the
fruit, whereby at the last it shall feel what benefit it has forsaken, and
into what evils it has cast it self headlong. We also are all of this nature,
in as much as we are the children of Adam, who contented not himself to eat
of the fruit that GOD had permitted and given him: but against the will of God
would taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, whereby
after wards he knew what riches he had lost, and into what misery he had
cast both himself and al his posterity, if God of his goodness and mercy had
not sent a remedy, by our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom this tree of life was a
figure. For it is he which is the true Wisdom, the everlasting Word of God,
wherein life remained. If then we will live, and be blessed, we must take
Jesus Christ for our tree of life, wherewith our souls should be nourished
eternally.

19 The Lord by Wisdom has laid the foundation of the earth, and has
stablished the heavens through understanding. 20 By his knowledge the depthes
are broken up, and the clouds drop the dew. 21 My Son, let not these
things depart from thine eyes, but observe VVisdome and counsel. 22 So they
shall be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy neck.
To the end that we should not judge that the Wisdom which Solomon does so
carefully commend unto us, (attributing great virtues, and excellent graces
unto her) is a thing fained in the brain of men, and that it does perish
with them, and for this occasion should be led to mistrust her, and to despise
her* and therefore he does declare unto us his eternity, divinity, and power.
For if the Lord have builded the earth by Wisdom, etc: it follows, first
that she is before al creatures, and so she is eternal: and forasmuch as there
is none but God that is everlasting, we must understand that Wisdom is of one
divine essence with God, and consequen^ly of all one power.

When Solomon speaks thus of wisdom, he does attribute ^he creation,
ordering and government of al things, as well heavenly as earthly unto her: and
therein he shows that it is the eternal word: where of mo^es speaks.
Whereupon we must understand Genesis 1 5. John. 1. 1*
that this wisdom is the everlasting Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ. And
so by these words Solomon allureth us to put al our felicity, all the hope of
our salvation, al our joy and pleasure in Jesus Christ, and that he only
should be our contentation and satisfying: so that we should not desire other
riches nor treasures, but that he should be unto us al in all, as he only has
crea^ed things, ordered al things, ordered al, and holds al in his power. And
if in this ^orte we take him unto us, and hold him fast, then blessed are we,
for we shall want nothing. Now that by these words of Solomon we should be
induced to know the eternite divinity and power of wisdom, to join
ourselves unto her, and to put al our trust in her, we may learn the same by
other places of the scripture, in the which the holy Ghost willing to turn us
from the vain trust of Idols, and to make us lean upon one God only, does
attribute the creation of the world, the disposing, guyding Genesis 1. 1. Esa.
40. 26. and 42. 5. and 44. 24. and. 45 18. Ier. 10. 12.
and governing of al things unto him. It is then the manner of the scripture to
set the creation of the world before us, when it endeavors to induce us to
put our trust in God: and also when we make confession of our faith, we
confess that God is maker of heaven and earth. As touching the rest, when
wisdom has so helped, and still does maintain al things which are created
for man his sake, and do serve him: we ought to understand thereby that she
will not forsake us, seeing that we are much more excellent Mat. 6. 26.
then the things which are created for our use and service. For if God take
care of things that are less then we, by a stronger reason he will assist us in all our needs. Moreover when we see the earth so steadfastly settled, and that
it vpholdeth great buildings and high mountains, without any remoouing: that
it bears both great and small trees, and brings forth al green things for
food to man and beast: that the heavens with their hosts do continually
keep their course, without shaking and weariness: that out of the deepes do
rise the springs of waters, from whence the wells, rivers, pondes, and sea do
come, for the necessity both of man and beas^es: and that we see also that to
give us abundance and greater fruitefulnesse, the clouds drop down, the rain
to moisten and to make the earth fat: and that of all these things there is
none in our power, that by our thought and care we can in no wise further
them: we must confess it is God only that works by his wisdom, though he
would have that man should labor, and that he uses man as his instrument. And
therefore with knowledge we must confess, O Lord, how manifold are thy
works, in wisdom have thou made them all. And Psalm. 104. 24
for to make this confession truly, we must (through the consideration of gods
works) renounce our own wits, and be willing to be brought to the knowledge
of the everlasting power and divinity of God, that we may glorify him as God
and not turn away ourselves from him unto superstition and idolatry, the
which if we should do, we shall deserve that God should be moved to power
his wrath upon us, as upon the wicked and ungodly, and to give us up unto a
reprobate mind, for to damn us eternally. As concerning the rest, if God have
given us any knowledge of the government as well of the heavens as of the earth,
of the air and of the waters, let us not swel with our knowledge, as the
Philosophers, which did attribute unto their diligence, wit, and capacity the
knowledge that they had of this world: but with all humility let us confess,
that it is GOD that imparteth unto us his wisdom, understanding and
knowledge. Also let us take heed from finding any fault in the works of God,
neither let us murmr at all when matters shall not follow our fantasy: but
let us thank God for all, in that it pleases him to govern all by his
wisdom for our service.

21 My son. Wisdom is a treasure inestimable, wonderful, profitable and
full of pleasure, as we have heard, and still may hear. When we see that
Solomon is not contented with the former praises, whereby he has declared unto
us the profit and pleasure that they have which are possessed with wisdom,
but does admonish us, carefully to keep it, saying, My son, let not these
things depart, etc: When we see that God by Solomon speaks unto us gently,
calling us his sons, and that he does admonish us for our great profit and
honor; we must be ready to hear him, and diligent to obey him: if not, we
deserve to be deprived of these great riches, which are offered unto us, and
miserably to perish. Now if so be that worldly rich men do warn their
children safely to keep the treasures that they have gathered for them, the
which notwithstanding are transitory, so we ought not to think it strange
nor painful, if God by Solomon commend unto us so carefully his treasure of
wisdom, which cannot perish, but we without it shall perish: And it
behooves us thoroughly too praise and love our heavenly father, by setting
forth his praises, and giving him thanks for that he does offer daily unto
us by his word, the treasure of his wisdom, and does exhort us to keep it
carefully. And for to show that we do truly esteem both our Father and his
treasure, replenished with so great riches and precious jewels, we must take
heed that such goods be not pulled and taken from our eyes. And for to do
this duly, we must not use our wits and fantasy, but stand in need to
be armed with counsel and Wisdom, to keep diligent watch over this
treasure: the which we shall obtain, if our desire be set in the law of the
Lord, etc: and that we follow Deu. 6. 6. and 11. 18.
the counsel of Moses: And these words which I command thee this day, shall be
in thy heart, etc. These are the eyes which Solomon chiefly requires, as he
himself does show, when after having spoken of the eyes, he adds, but
observe Wisdom and counsel, etc. And for as much as we can not have
better Wisdom and counsel, then to follow the word of God, we learn not to
come unto the Sermon to feed our eyes, and Mat. 7. 24.
to fill our ears, but to receive Wisdom and counsel, and thereafter to be
guided and governed. Thus doing, we shall possess Wisdom, we shall keep it,
and it will preserve us.

22 So they shall be life unto thy soul. As Solomon is very diligent to exhort
us to be hearers of Wisdom: so also to encourage us to follow his
admonitions, he promises us life and honor. And because that the rich of
this world think themselves well assured to live (as the rich glutton which
is spoken of in Saint Luke) and most commonly are deceived* therefore to
assure us that the obteining of wisdom is bette^ then al worldly riches, he
promises us that we shall live everlastingly: for he does promise us the
life of the soul, whereby wise men do live, even presently, when they are fed
with the seed of life, which is the Euangelical word, assuring themselves of
the goodness of God in Jesus Christ. For man lives not by bread only, but by
every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The wolrde which
persecuteth the wise indeed, Mat. 4. 4. De^t. 8. 3.
does not see this life: for it is compassed with many miseries and
afflictions, and seems rather that the wise are in death, and that they
perish. The very wise themselves here in this life do not see it: but they
hope for it. We are saved through hope. Romans 18. 24
And albeit that for the wrongs and reproaches that the wise do suffer, they
be tempted to murmr and to lament, as if they were in death: yet knowing
that hope makes not ashamed, they abide patiently for the day wherein this
life shall be declared, until which time it is hid with Christ in God, who is
faithful: and therefore they are assured of this, that he will not deny them
that, which he keeps for them: seeing also that this their life is common
with Jesus Christ, who will not disappoint his brethren and companions. Even so
that which the wise and faithful hold in hope, they shall one day enjoy and
openly possess. For when Christ, which is our life shall appear, then shall we
also appear ^ol. 3. 4.
with him in glory. Contrarily, the souls of the foolish^ are and shall be in
death. He compares the honor that he promises the wise, unto a purse of
iewelles hanging about the neck: and indeed, wisdom is a glistering purse
before GOD, who looks into the inward beauty, and to the goodness of the
heart, and does so well please him and so greatly does esteem it, that he
rewards the same with eternal life. For unto them which through perseverance
in well doing, seek glory, honor ^om. 2. 7.
and immortality, eternal life, etc. We may also understand that the wise
will speak so discretly, that men shall receive his words with honor and
reverence, and that they will gladlye hear him speak, and his words shall
serve to edifica^ion*

23 Then shall thou walk safely by thy way: and thy foot shall not stumble.
Psalm. 91. ^^.
24 If thou sleep, thou shall not be afraid, and when thou sleep, thy
sleep shall be sweet.
The former promis ought to be sufficient enough for to encourage us to follow
the ^ade of wisdom, and carefully to give ourselves thereunto, and never to
forsake her: but forasmuch as the said promise respects chiefly the time to
come, unto the which time the fulpossession of that which is promised is
deferred: and lest the delay might make us negligent, except we had presently
some commodity, and might wax desperate, as if we were in death, seeing that
the life of the godly wise, is compassed with misery: Therefore Solomon does
promis us that in the mids of troubles we shall be preserved, that they shall not
hurt us, but that we shall prosper in our way, and in all our affairs: so far
off shall it be that we shall fall, to perish* that we shall meet with nothing to
hinder us, from going the right way, but shall come to the end of our affairs
with ease. For through wisdom, wherewith we shall be seasoned, staying ourselves
upon the word of God, we shall overcome al lets that the flesh, the world and
the Devil can set against us, so that no evil shall be tide us, nor any wound
shall come near our dwelling. And this we must well note, that Solomon says,
in thy way. He does not promise us safety, if we follow any other trade or
way then we ought, if we forsake our vocation and follow our good intents, and
being disobedient to the commandementes of God, do follow men's traditions and
the doctrines of Devils. For when we delight in ourselves, and forsake the
ways which the Lord teaches us, the said promise does nothing perteine
unto us: but it is made unto us, and also we shall enjoy the same, so that we
give ourselves to do our duty, and to follow our vocation, not ventering
ourselves further then the same vocation requires. For after this we shall
shew^ ourselves to be wise indeed, and in the mids of most horrible te^pestes
we shall be preserved, that nothing shall bring us hurt: albeit that after the
sight of the eyes and feeling of the flesh it shall seem clean contrary. For
the wise also do meet with many hindrances, the which were able enough, not
only to make them stu^ble, but also to fall and perish, if God by his wisdom
did not uphold them. The which wisdom he gives unto his faithful children,
and does exalt them, so much as he knows to be expedient: howbeit they
stumble and do often fall, that they may be warned of their frailty, and that
they may have their recourse unto the almighty, who has made this promise the
which he does truly perform, not suffering the fall of the wise to be
mortal. The paths of man are directed by the Lord, and his way pleases Psalm.
37. 23.
him: though he fall, he shall not be cast of* For the Lord puts under his
hand.

24 If thou sleep, etc. He proceeds to declare the commodities that the
faithful have in this life by wisdom, and sets here before us two of
them: that is to say, the rest, without fear, and the sweet sleep: of the
which commodities the rich worldlings (whose hearts are set on covetousness)
are deprived, being in continual fear of loosing their riches, not serving
God, but their insatiable desires: and therefore they have not the sweet
sleep, but full of dreams, sorrows and troubles. The fullness of the rich will
not suffer him to sleep. In this promise we may first of al learn, that it
is laweful for a wise and faithful man to rest and sleep, but not to give unto
the flesh his ease, as do the insatiable and intemperate, which do bestow
the greatest part of their time in gluttony and in sleep: but to the end
that taking his rest, he may be more disposed to serve God and his neighbor
according to his vocation.

Secondly, that the sleep is not a thing so natural unto man, that he can use
the same at his will, except GOD of his grace do give it him. Wherefore, if we
rest quietly, we owe thanks unto GOD therefore: and if we cannot sleep at
our ^ase, let us take heed from being grieved, knowing that GOD does
distribute his gifts as seems him good, and in the mean while, that we may
be occupied about our vocation, let us ask of GOD that it would please him
to give us quiet sleep. It pleases him well that we ask it: for it is a
part of our daily bread, and if he would not that we should ask it, and
that he would not voutsafe to give it, he would make us no promise thereof.

Thirdly, that the wise have in this present life so much rest and ease, as is
necessary for them: and albeeit that oftentimes they be greatly troubled, and
that after diverse sorts, knowing that God is their helper: yet they are
contented, and say with David, I will lay me down, and also sleep in peace:
for thou Lord, Psalm. 4. 8. Psalm. 91. 1.
only make me dwell in safety.

25 Thou shall not fear for any sudden fear, neither for the destruction of
the wicked, when it comes. 26 For the Lord shall be for thine assurance, and
shall preserve thy foot from taking.
For further to admonish the wise and faithful of the blessings that they shall
obtain during this life, by giving themselves unto wisdom, he makes here
a defense the which answers in egal degree with the promise, and which ought
to cause us to fix our eyes upon wisdom, whereby and not otherwise, we may
be assured that we shall not be beaten down with the calamities, how
sudden soever they be: although that being mixed amongst the wicked, we
cannot escape but have our part of the evils that they suffer, and be
overthrown with them. Solomon would not have us to hold such opinion, and
that rightly: for sudden fear is due unto them that have not the fear of
God, and which without remorse of conscience give themselves unto dishonestie
for to co^mital filthiness with greedines through contempt and disobedience
against the word of God. Such kind of people do think themselves safe, and
do falsely believe that no harm shall come to them: but when they fear
nothing, after that God has deferred their punishment for a time, they find
themselves overtaken with evils, from the which they cannot escape. This is the
sudden fear, as Solomon does declare the same, when having forbidden to be
afraid of the sudden fear, he adds, neither for the destruction of the
wicked, etc. The which falls upon them unawares, and when they think not of
it, and sooner then they would. The world destroyed by the fludde has
proved it: so have the Sodomites and Gomorthians, Dathan, Core, and Abyram,
with their company. Contrarily, when this destruction came, Noe and his
family, Loath and his daughters, Moses and Aaron were preserved from it: for
they were not of the conspiracy of the wicked. Now as these same, were
delivered, so Solomon also would have, that al they that through fear of
offending God, do give themselves unto wisdom, should be assured, that the
destruction which happens unto the wicked, shall not overtake them: and
albeeit they suffer with them, yet shall they not be overcome: for they forese^
a far off the destruction to come, because they know that God is just, and
that he cannot always dissemble but at the last will punish wickedness. And
also that which the wise and faithful do suffer, they bear it patiently,
knowing that they have well deserved it: and thus the desolation does not turn
to their hurt, but to their benefit. Also we know that al things work
together for the best unto the^ that love God. Those that were among the Jews
elected, did Romans 8. 2^.
well understand this: for it was also foretold them by the Prophets long time
before the captivity of Babylon. In following the examples of these good old
fathers, let us not be afraid for any calamity that shall happen to the world,
although we light on the same, as if it did assault us unprovided, and as
though we had not foreseen it. For the faithful considering the wickednesses
which reign in the world, and that they themselves do daily offend, ought
to confess that the rods are prepared for them, and that the condemnation of
the wicked from a long time tarieth 2. Pet. 2. 3.
not, and their destruction sleeps not. To the rest, Solomon would not have
us to be bold of ourselves, nor trust in our own strength* Forgiving a reason
for the which we must not fear, he says not, for ye are strong and mighty,
hardy and courageous: ye know the subtilities of Satan and the devises of the
wicked: but he gives all the praise unto God, as also it is most due unto him:
for he says,

26 For the Lord shall, etc. It is not Solomon only that affirms unto us,
that God helps his faithful servants: the holy scriptures are replenished
with such witnesses, and also with examples, whereby we may well know it.
Seeing then that we have many witnesses hereof, and that this help
surmoun^eth heavenly, earthly and infernal powers, we must in no wise fear,
but hold an invincible assurance against all the afflictions of the world,
otherwise we do not believe that GOD is on our side, and do belie the
Scripture, and do count the examples thereof to be fables: as do all they
which would win paradise by their works and free will. If we be assured
against sudden fear and the miseries that happen unto the wicked, let us
confess that it comes of the only help of GOD. By this that Solomon
compares us unto beasts, for which men set nets and snares to take them and
kill them, and compares the sudden fear, the punishments and judgments of
GOD, the which he prepares either by men, or by the Devils, unto nets and
snares, when he says, and shall preserve thy feet: etc. he does spoil us of
al strength and power of francke and free will. For if we could deliver
ourselves from the sudden fear, and from miseries, we should not need to
have GOD to keep us: but now if we be left unto ourselves, we are like unto
^eeble beasts, which run into the net, and are taken in the snare, out of
the which they cannot escape. This comparison is often used in the scripture.
Let us note further, that the word which we have translated help, after the
Chaldee interpretour does signify hope and confidence.

27 Withhold not the good from the owners thereof: though there be power in
thine hand to do it.
But now to teach us mercifulness, he gives us commandments belonging unto
the second table, the which does show us, how we should live with our
neighbors, and what duty we owe unto them. First of al, he forbids us
theft; not only that, for which thieves are punished by the magistrates, but
chiefly the same, for which some do esteem themselves, and would be accounted
of, and also are praised and commended of those that extol covetousness, who
count it nothing to hurt their neighbors, so that they may win by it. The
which they do, when they se^ that there is no resistance nor power to be
revenged. There are many kinds of such thieves, the which not only go
unpunished by men, but honored: yet notwithstanding seeing they be full of
cruelty, they should not think to be exempted from punishment. For as it is
said, Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain Mat. 5. 7. Iam. 2. 13.
mercy: so also, cursed are the cruel and unmerciful, for judgment without
mercy shall fall on him that shows no mercy. And in this sort they shall buy
their honors very dear, and it had been much better for them to have
confessed their fautes, and to be punished in this world with shame, then to
hear this fearful Mat. 25. 41.
sentence, Depart ye cursed from me, etc. We say with shame: for since they
say they are Christians, it should be a foul shame for them to suffer
hanging, as is showed unto us by S. Peter. See 1. Pet. 4. 15.
that none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or an evil doer, etc. But
we shall avoid them both, if being merciful and charitable, Mat. 7. 12.
we do unto our neighbors as we would be done unto: and with hold not the
good from the owners thereof. For to perform this well, it suffiseth not to
forsake al evil trades, all unlawful and unreasonable means to draw unto us
the goods of our neighbor: but we must renounce al enterprises, purposes and
deliberatio^s to enriche ourselves with the hinderance of our neighbor, and to
do our duty for to conserve every man his, and readily to give the hyreling
his wages, and almose unto the poor, when we have the goods of this world: for
to such kind of people do they also belong, and not only unto us. Therefore
upon wha^ ^itle soever we possess them, they are committed unto us to dispose
them, according as God does teach us by his word. Now tha^ it is needful that
we should with all speed give the hyreling his wages, we may understand if we
con^ider our own nature, which is, to be grieved when men deffer to render
that which they owe unto us, and chiefly when necessity pincheth us. But that
we may be further advertised, Solomon does give us a commandment thereof,
saying:

28 Say not unto thy neighbor, go and come again, a^^ to morrow will I give
thee, if thou now have it.
This 2. commandment is plain, and there is none so dull of understanding but
may understand the same, seeing he asks nothing of us which we would not
have done to ourselves. Solomon demands nothing of us which passes the
bounds of nature well governed, and also he adds nothing unto the law of
Moses. For it is said, Thou shall not steal. again, Thou shall do no Leui. 19.
11. and 13.
wrong unto thy neighbor, nor poll him. Thou shall not oppress an hired
servant that is needy and poor, etc. Thou shall give him Deuteronomy. 24. 14
his hire for his day, etc. Now if we may not use such delays, much less may
we seek ways utterly to deprive our neighbors of that which we owe them. Let
us then take heed we do not as those which S. James reproves, saying, For if
a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say
unto them, depart in peace: warm yourselues, and fill your bellies,
notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body,
Iam. 2. 19.
what helps it? For the love that we owe unto our neighbors, is not paid
with words. Even so, whosoever shall have this worlds good, and shall see his
brother to stand in need, and will shut up his compassion from him, how
dwells the love of God in him? We must then be ready to pay our debts, and
to help the necessity of the poor, otherwise we withhold the good from the
owner thereof, and bid them come again to morrow, the which is a detestable
theeuerie before God, who can well punish it, even as murder and manslaughter
as the scripture witnesses in diverse places: although it be counted but a small
fault before men, who do pardon great thieves and hang up the little ones.

29 Intend none hurt against thy neighbor, seeing he does dwell without fear
by thee.
For the third commandment of mercy, he shows that we must walk in
integrity of heart with our neighbors, and chiefly with those which stand
not in doubt nor mistrust us, otherwise we deserve greatly to be blamed of
treason, considering that they which dwell and occupy with us, do not
distrust us, because outwardly we show them a fair face and smoothe
countenance. For none can be assured of his neighbor, except he love him,
and desire his prosperity. Therefore when we see that our neighbors do no^
fear that we will hurt them, let us not invent any evil against them, and
muchlesse put it in practice, otherwise we must look for nothing but a curse:
as it is written, he has didgged a pit, and made it deep, and is fallen into
it himself. He that rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
house. And Psalm. 7. 15. Prou. 17. 13.
albeeit that Solomon does not here make mention but of the devises that are
made against those that think themselves to be at peace and quietness, and
would have us to abstain from it, it is not therefore to say, that he
allows conspiracies and treasons that are made against enemies: for he
says, Say not thou, I will recompense evil, but wait upon the Lord, and he
shall save Pro. 20. and 25. 2^.
thee. Again, If he that hates thee, be hungry, give him bread to eat, and
if he be thirsty, give him water to drink. But by forbidding one kind of
treason, he gives us to understand that al treasons are evil, and that we
must have our hearts pure from al evil thoughts and purposes. And namely he
forbids to ymagine any thing against him, that so loves his neighbor, that
he has no evil suspicion of him: for if a man be given to ymagine against them
that are such, he will also ymagine against his enemies. And albeit that
Jeremy says, Cursed is I^re. 17. 5*
the man that puts his trust in man, etc. it is not to say, that it is
unlawful for a man to trust in his neighbor, when there is perceived nothing
in him but honesty. For as the scripture blames the trust that is put in man
against the word of God, even so also it commands us, love, the which
believes al, and hops al, and indureth al things and thinks none evil. If
then we love our 1. Cor. 13. 7.
neighbors in whom we see none evil, we will put our trust in them, and will
not fear that they will do us wrong, but rather that they will help us at our
need. This is the trust whereof Solomon here speaks, and not the vain and
foolish trust that one puts in another, and in worldly things forgetting
God: as the same which the Jews had in the help of Egypt: and like the same
that the Papists have in their Saints and in their merits, and other baggage.

30 Strive not with a man causeles, when he has doon^ thee no harm.
For the fourth commandment of mercy, he would have us ^o avoid
contentions, which are fruits of evil thoughts: and chiefly that we should
not strive with him that douteth us not. For seeing that in not mistrusting us,
he shows us sign of love. And again that we have no trial that he would
nor does us any evil, then should we do him great iuiury to contend with
him. He expressly forbids such contentions, because they are most
detestable, both before God, and men which have any spark of good feeling: and
also because that that man who is wont to strive without cause, will make no
conscience to strive and contend against them which shall something offend him.
The which Solomon allows not of, as we have seen by the witnesses before
alleged.

Moreover our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the true Solomon, forbids us al
contentions: when he says, But I say unto you, resist not evil: and when he
says a little after, Love your enemies: Mat. 5. 39. Romans 12. 17.
And S. Paul, Recompense to no man evil for evil: by forbidding us these
debates, and commanding us peace and love with all men, they add nothing unto
the law, though it be commanded, he shall give life for life. For therein the
judges are taught how they ought to punish the offenders, and not how
particular Exo. 21. 23. Deuteronomy. 19. 21.
persons should revenge themselves upon their enemies, to whom by the law
they ought to do well. If thou meetest with the Ox of thine enemy, or his
ass going astray, thou shall bring it home to him. David did well understand
the Exo. 23. 4. 1. Sam. 24. 2^*
same, as it may be seen in the hunting that Saul made after him.

31 Be not envious for the wicked man, neither choose any of his ways. 32 For
the froward is abomination unto the Lord: but his secret is with the
righteous.
Forasmuch as they which are void of mercy, do show unmercifulness and
cruelty, wherewith they are full fraught, giving themselves to invent evil
against innocents which distrust them not: and that they which stir up
strifes without cause against the good, do flourish commonly in the world,
living easily and peaceably, and possessing great riches with honors: and
contrarily, they which walk with integrity of heart, which seek peace, and
feign would do well, do suffer much misery, and are contemned of the world:
for this cause the poor faithful ones are tempted to forget mercy, and to
serve the wicked for part of their prosperity. There is none so perfect in
all the world, if so be it he fall into affliction, but does feel these
temptations. And David also does acknowledge the same in his own person, and
consequently in the same of all the Psalm. 73. 2.
faithful, saying, As for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well
near slipped: For I fretted at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the
wicked. Again, Lo, these are the wicked, yet prosper they always, and increase
in riches.

The elect and faithful ones have such like temptations: but to the end that
they should take heed from being overcome with them, Solomon gives also the
fifth commandment of mercy: saying, Be not envious for the wicked man.
Therefore if we will follow mercy we must put far from us the desires and
affections to be like unto the envious man, and the man that suffers himself
to be carried about by his lusts, and runs after them with might and maine,
and cares not what he thinks, or says, or does, whether right or wrong,
so that he may come to the end of his enterprises. And because there are
some, that make themselves believe that they would not be like the envious,
and yet follow their manners: to the end that we should not deceive
ourselves with them, Solomon does warn us to choose none of their ways.
Whereunto we must obey, nothing declining from the right way, albeeit we
find therein great incombrances, and that we must suffer much even to the
uttermost after the feeling of the flesh. Al those are like unto these envious
men, which do choose such kind of life as brings either spiritual or
temporal hurt unto their neighbors. To avoid then the calamities of this
present life, and to live easily, we must not wander out of the right way, and
forsake mercy. And to make us more willing to obey his commandment, Solomon
does bring us reasons for to fear the envious, and to comfort the upright,
showing that the wicked cannot long endure, and that the good shall not be
always in misery, but that shortly they shall be delivered therefrom. The first
reason is:

For the froward, etc. He whom before he called envious, he now calls
froward: because that through his frowardnes whereunto he is accustomed, he
goes backewarde and falls from the right way: and therefore, albeeit that he
esteems himself and is honored of the world, which knows not what kind
of people are to be praised, he is abominable before the Lord, who can
surely in due time suppress his enuiousnes, and cast it far from him, and
deprive him of his help, without the which nothing can stand. Thus the
envious which forsake the right way of righteousness, shall not endure, but
shall go into destruction. For as we may see by the holy histories, those
which have been abhorred of the Lord for their enuiousnesse and frowardnes,
have not long continued, but have been rooted out, even when they seemed to
flourish and prosper most: and have been rooted out not only by temporal
punishment, but also have received Judge. 3. 2. Pet. 2. ^.
judgment of eternal fire, and have been made example for all them which
should live without reverence of God. This threatening serves to fear the
envious and the froward, which have no reverence of God, nor mercy toward
their neighbors: and also to make them inexcusable, except they return unto
repentance. The faithful also ought to tremble at such threateninges, and fear
the judgments of GOD, seeing that of their corrupt nature they are such, that
they cannot of themselves but be in abomination before GOD, and so go to
destruction as they deserve. But to the end that being humbled, and as it were
in despair of themselves, they might take courage, and not remain under the
burden of despair, the holy scripture for their comfort adds the promise
against the threatening. As also Solomon uses it to the same purpose: for
having threatened the froward, saying, that they are abomination before the
Lord, he adds to comfort the faithful, but the secret of the Lord is with
the righteous: that is to say, with them who for fear of offending GOD, and
for love they bear unto their neighbors, do abstain from enuiousnesse, and
fly from all frowardness. Now to have boldness to follow the righteous* and
to be stirred to desire the communication and participation of this secret,
we must understand that this secret is the covenant of God with his faithful
children, whereby he promises them to be their GOD, as it is written,
Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with
the Iere. 31. 31.
house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, etc. David does teach us thus
to expound it, when he says, What man is he that fears the Lord? He
will teach him the way that he shall choose. etc. This secret then consists
in this, that God does give us to know his good will toward us, and does
teach us his law, that being assured of his favor and mercy, we should
give ourselves to fear and obey him. Now this covenant is rightly called a
secret* For first of al how wise soever we be, we cannot enter into it of
ourselves: Jesus Christ does witness the same, I give thee thanks, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have hid these things from the Mat.
11. 25.
wise men of understanding, and have opened them to babes. Blessed art thou
Simon, the son of Iona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee,
but my father which is in heaven. And Mat. 16. 17. ^. Cor. 2. 6.
we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: not the wisdom of this world
neither of Princes of this world which come to naught. Secondly the faithful
have no more understanding thereof, then it pleases God to reveal unto them
by his holy spirit: and yet what revelation soever they have thereof, yet have
they no perfect knowledge in this world. For we know in part, and we
prophecy in part: but when that which is perfect, is ^. Cor. 13. 9.
come, then that which is in part, shall be abolished.

33 The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the
habitation of the righteous. 34 With the skorneful he skorneth, but he gives
grace unto the humble.
In this world the envious and the froward are blessed, whom Solomon here
calls wicked, because he has neither fear nor reverence of GOD, nor good
affection toward his neighbors, but suffers himself to be led about of his
unbridled lusts. Such a man is blessed of the world, in whose judgment he
florisheth and prospers: and not only do they thus judge of him, but also his
children, servants, and household, are counted happy, so that there is preasse
to speak with him and to serve him and his. But here at the faithful ought
not to be envious, neither to desire to be in such estimation, nor to have
such praise, knowing that such things cannot continue, but fall to decay. For
the curse of the Lord, the which destroys whatsoever comes against it, is
in the house of the wicked, to spare neither him nor his family, that follows
his trade. I say expressedly which follow his trade: for if the wicked man
beget a son, that sees al Eze. 18.
his fathers sins which he has done, and fears, neither does the like,
etc. he shall not dye in the iniquity of his father, but he shall surely live.
Let us not therefore envy the worldly blessing, but let us desire the blessing
of God: whereof if we will be assured, let us forsake enuiousnesse,
frowardness and al wickedness, and give ourselves unto righteousness,
staying ourselves upon the grace and mercy of GOD by faith, and framing our
lives according to his holy word, exercising unfeigned charity one of us
toward another. And if for thus doing we be accursed of the world, let us
rejoice: as S. Luke teaches us, blessed are ye when men hate you, etc. Rejoice
ye in that day, and be Luke. 6. 22.
glad: for behold, your reward is great in heaven. This reward is the
blessing of the Lord, that Solomon promises unto the righteouse, when he
says, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. For mainteyning them
in this earthly mansion, and giving them enough of al things and wherewith
they are contented, though they suffer much: yet finally he gives them the
perfection of al blessedness, that is to say, the kingdom of heaven. And
albeeit that nothing does prosper nor increase, nor grow without the blessing
of God: yet is it not to say, that they which have great abundance of worldly
riches, are blessed of ^od* For it is said, Woe be to you, ye rich, for you
have your Luke. 6. 2^*
consolation here. They usurp the things that are blessed of God for the use
of the faithful, and yet are they cursed of God, and are never the better for all their wealth. For what shall it profit a man, though he should win the
whole world, if he loose his own Matthew. 16.
soul? The third reason is:

With the skorneful he skorneth, etc. It seems well unto the envious froward,
and wicked that they shall finishe their enterprise, and enjoy their desires:
and because they esteem that there is none other felicity then that which
they see with theit eyes, they make no conscience to abound in all iniquity:
and what exhortations soever they hear in the name of God, yet make they no
account thereof. And this is the cause why the scripture calls them skorners:
but as they skorne, so also God mocketh them. For as much as naturally we be
al skorners, we ought to tremble at this threatening, and not to harden
ourselves against it, but humbly Prou. 1. 26.
to confess our faults, and to ask pardon: and in steed to be skorned as
we deserve, we shall please God: as Solomon does promise us, saying, but he
gives grace unto the humble. S. Peter exhorts us to learn this humility,
Deck yourselues ^. Pet. 5. 5.
inwardly with lowliness of mind: for GOD resists the proud, and gives
grace unto the humble. Hereby we do learn that the skorners and proud
persons are al of one order: and whosoever skorneth, is proud. The contraritie
of humbleness does show it: likewise does the threatening made by Solomon
and by Saint Peter. Of these three reasons Solomon makes a conclusion for the
comfort of the faithful and confusion of the wicked, saying:

35 The wise shall inherit glory: but fools dishonor, though they be exalted.
This conclusion agrees very well with the former reasons: for fith that God
reuealeth his secrets unto the righteours, giving them grace to follow his
commandementes, and to be assured of his mercy, and that he blesses the
righteous, giving them enough and contentation, and also helps and receives
unto himself the humble which are forsaken of the world, and counted as
filth, it follows right well that the wise which are well learned in the school
house of God, whom before he has called right, just, and humble, shall be
honored for ever, as Solomon does signify, saying, they shall inherit
honor. For since they be contemned and slandered in the world, and yet do
inherit honor, it follows that it comes from God who has the power to
uphold them, and indeed will defend them: for he is faithful and constant, and
changes not, but brings that to perfection which he has begun. The gifts
and vocation of God are without repentance. Romans 11. 29.
And forasmuch as the wise shall inherit honor, and yet have no certain
abiding place in this world, we must understand that the full possession of
this honor, is in the kingdom of heaven in everlasting life. Therefore to
obtain this honor, let us give d^ligent ear unto wisdom, whereby we may
walk the right ways Romans 2. 7.
with the just and humble. Let us not envy the foolish, who the more they are
given unto abominable things before God and his faithful, do the more commend
themselves, and would be had in admiration, and fear. This is it that Solomon
signifies saying, but fools dishonor, though they be exalted: for they
delight in their enuiousnes, frowardness, wickedness, and skorning, for the
which they are set at naught both before God and his elect. Hereby we may
understand that there are many fools in the world, yea even where the Gospel
is preached.

The fourth Chapter.
1 Hear, O ye children, the instruction of a father, and give ear to learn
understanding. 2 For I do give you a good doctrine: therefore forsake ye not
my law.
SOlomon yields himself unto our rudenes, as a father unto the weakness,
slownes, and forgetfulness Chap. 1. 8. and. 2. 1. and. 3. 1
of his child. He repeateth again the self same exhortations that he has
made us heretofore. And in steed that we well deserve to be sharply
reproved; he calls us children: and in place for to threaten us as a judge,
he calls us to hear the instruction of the Father of spirits, to the end
that we being made attentive hearers thereof, might be delivered from
ignorance, and should know what we ought to learn, and what is profitable
for the health of our souls: he gives us the reason for the which we should
be moved to hear, and become diligent.

For I do give you, etc. By this reason he would have us to know that al
doctrine which does turn us from the law of GOD, is naught, unprofitable and
hurtful: and therefore we should not desire to be instructed in any other
doctrine then the same that our heavenly Father gives us, the which only is
good as he alone is good. This doctrine is none other thing then his law, the
which in no wise ought to be despised, as he shows us, when he concludes,
therefore forsake ye not my law. He speaks here, in the name and in the
authority of God, whose servant he was, and committed to instruct his people:
and therefore he affirms that his doctrine is good, and that it is the law of
God: and therefore also are bound to hear his instruction, and to learn the
knowledge that he teaches us. Herein he shows unto the ministers, what
they ought to bring unto the people: that is to say, the pure word of God
inspired from God by the scripture, the which is profitable to teach, etc. 2.
Tim. 3. 16
It is the instruction of our father, it is the learning whereunto al men ought
to apply their minds, to obtain the true knowledge. It is the doctrine which
is profitable and necessary for us, it is the law of God, which we should
never forsake, but continually to be exercised therein. In the which also he
teaches the people how to behave themselves. First of al, that they should
hear for to be instructed, not by men, but by our heavenly father, who is the
only teacher: for me^ which speak, are but his organes and instruments.
Secondly, that they ought to be atte^tiue and give diligent heed, that they may
be delivered out of the du^geon of ignorance, to receive light for to learn
the true knowledge. Thirdly, that they should confess the goodness and
faithfulness of God, who will not suffer them to be deceived with fables and
lies, with vain and fruteles doctrines: but does offer and set before them,
the wholesome doctrine of his law, of his Prophets, and of his Gospel: the
which as he freely vouchsafes to give us, so should we again willingly
receive the same with faith and obedience. Fourthly, that they should not be
negligent to do well as the law commands. And in this manner we should
apply our hearts and bodies unto the service of our God, as he requires: and
so we shall not receive the preaching of the word of GOD in vain, no^ to our
condemnation, as they that do come to hear but for order and fashion sake,
etc. And to the end that none should doubt of his doctrine, and that they
should not be grieved as with an heavy and hard burden to bear, he shows
of whom he learned it, and at what age.

3 For I was my fathers Son, tender and dear in the sight of my mother. 4
When he taught me, and said unto me, let thine heart hold fast my words:
keep my commandementes, and thou shall li^e.
King David the Prophet, was the father of Solomon, who was endued with the
holy Ghost, whereby he did, said, and taught such things as were acceptable
before God, and profitable for his family, and for all the people that were
committed unto his charge. Now albeit that David had many children, yet Solomon
speaks of himself as if he had been the only son of David: for he says
not, we were many children of one father: but he says, I was my fathers son.
It may be said that it is, because that David showed greater signs of love
unto Solomon, then unto his other children, and exalted him above the rest,
making him King in his place. His mothers name was Bersabee, by whom he
remained the only son of his father: for he that was borne in adultery, was
dead: and the scripture makes no mention that she had any afterward: and
whiles his father and mother lived, he was yet ^ender, and 1. Chro. 13. 5. and
29. 1.
was not yet come unto man's age. Again, also it may be said that Solomon was
tender and dear, and his mothers only son, because she loved him tenderly
and with a singular love, as she shows. But by the first exposition we
learn that Solomon whiles he was tender and young, did not run from his
father and mother, to work wickedness and to give himself unto folly, and
vanity, as the youth at these days, but was ready at hand to obey them, as
he declares it, when he says, that he was his fathers son, and tender and
dear before his mother. For when he thus speaks, he gives to understand
that his father and mother were well pleased with him, and also endeavored to
please them. Otherwise he could not have truly rejoiced that he was his
fathers son, etc. For he that truly confesses his parents, he loves
their presence for to obey and honor them. We learn, I say, that the fathers
and mothers ought to be careful and diligent so to govern their children, that
they should not be gadders abroad, but be ready to come before them, so often
as need shall require, to do ^^ kind of duties, and not to run abroad after
foolishnes and vanity. We learn also that we should not fly from the
pre^en^^ of GOD, our only father, to turn away from his word, the which
teaches us to give unto him al honor and obedience, and assure ourselves that
we do please him. Contrarily, we decline from his instruction and forsake his
law: wherein we show ourselves strangers and bastards, and cannot truly
rejoice that we are of his household and his children. But not to fly the
presence of our father, it behooves us to be in the company of our mother the
Church, that we do often resort unto the holy assemblies, wherein the Gospel is
preached unto us, by the which we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the
Lord with open face. Solomon being yet tender, and not running from the
presence of his 2. Cor 3. 18.
father and his mother, but being obedient unto them, was taught by his father
in the word of the Lord, the which he himself witnesses, saying,

4 When he taught me, etc. The youths which make no account of instruction,
but do hate correction and admonition, and also giering and skorning all
discipline and religion, saying they are too young to become wise, cannot, I say,
truly boast that they have bin instructed of their fathers, as does Solomon:
for none can be taught, except he become willing to learn, and cannot by their
example induce others to hear good instruction, as does Solomon, when he
says that his father has taught him: as though he did say, when I exhort you
to hear the instruction of your father, I lay no more upon you then I my self
have borne whiles I was yet young. Now David for to have his son Solomon well
taught, committed him into the hands of Nathan the Prophet. The lesson that
David gives to his son is, that he says unto 2* Sam. 12. 2^*
him, Let thine heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments. Here we
learn that we ought in no wise to doubt of the instruction and doctrine of
Solomon, and we may judge that he does not teach us any other thing then the
same that he had learned of his father, who was a Prophet: and also (as has
been said before) he set him to school with the Prophet Nathan. For albeit
that David calls the doctrine and instruction which he gives to his son,
his words and co^ma^deme^ts, yet it is not to say, they are the commandments
and words of any other but of GOD. But it is the phrase of the scripture,
that it attributes unto the Doctors that which they teach, because they are
the Organes and instruments of GOD, by whom he communicates his word unto
us, and gives us his commandementes. We see that GOD says to Moses,
Command the children of Israel: and again, that Moses commands the people
to keep his words: and also God reprooueth his people, for that they would
not hear the words of his Prophets, etc. We learn also that it belongs
to fathers and mothers, to governors and pastors of the Church to command,
and that they ought to be obeyed when they command in the name of God and by
his word. And that the words of David and his commandments come not from
him, but from God, Solomon does declare, when he says that his father adds
unto his commandementes, and thou shall live: the which is a promise whereby we
do not obtain the reward for obeying the commandementes of men, but those of
God, etc. Moreover, let us note that if we will live, we must give our hearts
wholly unto the words which are declared unto us in the name of God, and
outwardly to do as they command us.

5 Get wisdom: get understanding: forget not neither decline from the words
of my mouth. 6 Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee, love her, and she
shall preserve thee.
He shows us lovingly that he would not have us to languish and pine away
through need and want, or be hurt, but would have us take and make our profit:
so that we should be more rich then the worldlings which abound in all
wordly wealth: for blessed is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that
gets Prou. 3. 13.
understanding: and therefore this possession cannot be gotten by any thing of
this world, how precious soever it is, but comes by free gift. For the Lord
gives wisdom, out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. And
although it is given, Pro. 2. 6.
yet the negligent and slouthful do not possess her, but those that watch and
seek her with all diligence. For if thou call after knowledge, and criest
for understanding, etc. This care and diligence Pro. 2. 3.
is here briefly noted, when Solomon says, Forget not, etc. Therefore if we
would gladly get and possess wisdom and understanding, we must have the
word of GOD printed in our hearts, not turning ourselves away from the
sermons which are made unto us out of the same by the ministers and Pastors
which are as the mouth of God, when they do faithfully exercise their office.
In this sort we shall get wisdom and understanding without any exchange or
cost, and without our deserts, travail and diligence. For this getting and
possessing is not like unto the earthly and temporal possessions, the which
requires exchange, or service, or pain. Wherefore it may seem that Solomon
has spoken improperly, when he exhorts us to get wisdom, the which we
must receive from the only goodness and free gift of God: and that he ought
rather to have exhorted us to ask it of God. But when he speaks thus
improperly against the use and custom of the world, he speaks the propre
speech of the spirit of GOD who gives testimony to the faithful that the
goodness of their Father is so great, that thereby he imputes for getting and
possessing, that which he freely gives of his mere liberality, and would
that we should possess it upon that tittle: provided that we receive the
same with thanks giving, and also that we take and receive the gift of GOD
with such reverence and estimation, that we never let it slip, but
diligently and carefully, keep it, as a precious thing, of great value, and
very necessary for our preservation and sauegarde. Solomon so understood it,
as he well shows by the admonition following, saying.

6 Forsake her not, etc. This exhortation ought to be highly esteemed of us,
when not only thereby we are advertised not to be so foolish, as to let
wisdom escape, when the Lord sets before us the getting thereof: but also
that it is ^ promise of warrantie and sauegarde, which is this, that by the
possession and reteyning of wisdom, we should have no ^inderance, but
shall be preserved from al hurt: as has been expounded, When wisdom, etc.
Wherein we may learn Pro^. 2. 10.
that this getting ought to be highly desired of us above al worldly gettings,
that costeth much, and are not always sure, fith this same comes freely, and
remains sure: for it is given by such a Lord as is able to maintain his
gift, and also both will and does. We may also understand that the possession
thereof ought not to be despised, but should by all means possible be
maintained and defended. For if we labor to keep the possession of earthly
goods, for the which some are often times in danger of their persons, much more
by reason we may not let wisdom go, but with great love and affection keep
possession: seeing that we are so far from danger for possessing thereof,
that rather it keeps and preserves us from al euilles. For albeeit that they
which are godly wise, do suffer many miseries and adversities, both spiritual
and corporal: yet do they never perish thereby, but do overcome through the
wisdom that GOD gives them. Though their flesh, the devil and the world do
tempt and assault them, yet are they not carried away by temptation: for God is
faithful, who will not suffer them to be tempted above their strength.

Though the world, the wicked and infidels do persecute them, 1. Cor. 10. 13.
yet are they not overcome* for they fear not them that can kill the body,
knowing that one hair of their head shall not perish* In Luke 21. 19.
which doing they maintain and possess their life by their patience. Though
poverty or sickness do pinche them, yet are they Mat. 6. 26.
not discouraged, neither care one whit, knowing that God feeds the birds of
heaven. They are contented with their daily bread, the which never fails,
what scarcity soever they abide: and albeeit that through sickness they loose
their taste and stomach, after the feeling of the flesh, yet the Lord who
has commanded them to ask, Give us this day our daily bread, will not forsake
Psalm. 34. 21. and. 37. 17. Heb. 13. 5.
them. Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with those
things that ye have, I will not fail thee, neither forsake thee.

7 Wisdom is the beginning: get wisdom therefore: and above al thy
possession, get understanding. 8 Exalt her, and she shall exa^t thee: she shall
bring thee to honor, if thou embrace her. 9 She shall give a comely ornament
unto thy head, yea, she shall give thee a Crown of glory.
Although we confess that wisdom is a most excellent acquisition or getting,
the which we ought so much to love, that we should never forsake her; and
that we confess, it is right and good for our profit, that Solomon calls us
unto this getting; yet do we not desire it, neither aspire after it, as we
ought, but do set it at naught, by preferring the wisdom of this world, and
the lusts of the flesh before it: the which is a turning of our back unto
God, when we make no account of his Word, but labor to fill our houses with
riches, how so ever they be gotten, so that we may obtain our purpose: and
do persuade men to believe that when we have well filled our houses, and have
gotten great gains and riches, that we shall come time enough at last for to
learn wisdom, and to fear and worship God: and which worst is, we persuade
ourselves that it is not needful to trouble our brain about marking what is
preached, for to refourme our lives after that which is taught us: but that it
is enough to give a good gasp when we dye. Behold how the love of our flesh
does draw us away, and the wisdom of this world deceives us. To the which
abuse Solomon willing to give a remedy, and to other abuses also, does teach
us that in all things we must begin by wisdom, and that for this cause he
has called us, and still presently calls to get wisdom, and would have us
with all our hearts to follow this gains, and that we should prefer it before
al worldly gettings: so that the same should please us, and we also contented
therewith: for truly, whatsoever is precious in the judgment of the world,
and al whatsoever men do delight in, is nothing in comparison of this wisdom
and knowledge. But for all Solomon's exhortation, and for all the reason that may
be alleged, yet men are flesh, and do esteem the things that the flesh
desires. A sensual man loves to be honored, and had in estimation: and
because he sees that rich men are honored, and commended and praised, and that
every man desires to feast them, he imputes the same unto the riches: and
therefore, to attain unto honor, and to be welcomed of the world, he studieth
to get temporal and earthly goods. Solomon would not have us remain in this
error, wherewith we are naturally infected: and therefore, he teaches us by
what means we may come unto honor: when he says,

8 Exalt her, etc. Therefore if we will come to honor, we must exalt and
embrace Wisdom. But it will be said, Forasmuch as the Lord by Wisdom has
lay de the foundation of the earth, Pro 3. 19.
and has stablished the heavens through understanding: that is follows, that
Wisdom is exalted enough. Wherefore it might seem, that in vain Solomon
does exhort us to exalt and embrace it, and that it is past our reach to do
it. I answer, Even as when we pray that Gods name may be sanctified, we do
not mean, that the glory of God can either increase, or decrease of it self:
but we ask, that his glory should be manifested as it ought, and whatsoever
God does, that al his works may appear glorious, as they are: so that on all
sides he may be glorified. Even so, when Solomon would have us to exalt and
magnify Wisdom, he means not that we can give her greater honor, and
place her in higher degree then she is in, of herself: but his desire is,
that we should have her in good estimation, and that we should make great
account of her, and that so much as in us lies, she should be exalted,
praised, and magnified of all persons, as it behooves. Also when he would
have us to embrace it, he means not that we can receive, hold and keep it
duly as we ought to do: but that we should so set our affection on her,
that we should never let her escape, and that we should not let it slip out
of our hearts, but rather that through the great love that we ought to bear
unto this Wisdom, we should stir up others to desire and to love her. We
may understand that this is the meaning of Solomon by his exhortation. For when
after his admonitions he exhorts us to exalt and embrace his Wisdom it, is
as much as if he did say, If thou gettest Wisdom, thou do exalt and
magnify her, and show thy self to bear a good mind unto her, and do
embrace her. This is that, which Solomon meant by this exhortation, Exalt her,
etc. Whom we shall not need to obey for naught, but shall be well rewarded: for as
he does promise us, she will also exalt and glorify us. But Solomon not
content with this declaration, adds thereto an other, saying,

9 She shall give, etc. Solomon does here declare how Wisdom does exalt
them which magnify her, and how she glorifieth them which embrace her: the
which he does by a similitude taken of the doings of Kings and great Princes,
which do exalte them to honor and glory, which do honor them, seeking the
profit and preservation of their persons and kingdoms: As Pharao took the
ring from of his finger, and put the same on Genesis 41. 42. Hest. 8. 15.
Iosephes hand: And Mardocheus departed from the king in royal apparel of
blewe, and white, and with a great Crown of gold, etc: or else the similitude
is taken of the reward that is given unto them which fight and run at tilte.
For he that fights and runs 2. Sam. 5. 8. 1. Cor. 9. 24. 2. Tim. 2. 5.
best, gets the Crown. How so ever it is taken, this declaration has two
parts, whereof the second does expound the first: for the increase of
grace, is a Crown of glory, the which is given unto the wise of this life,
after two sorts. For first of all, they are praised and honored so of God,
that he causes the world to wonder at them: albeit that the foolish and
scorners do persecute and refuse them, but yet against their conscience,
whereby they are convinced that they do naughtily. Secondly, by Faith and
hope, they have eternal life, which is the Crown of glory, which in the end
they shall wholly and fully possess, whereupon they may say, A Crown of
righteousness is kept for 2. Tim. 4. 8.
me, etc. The persecutions of this world shall not deprive us of this Crown:
but contrarily, Blessed is the man that abides temptation: for when he has
been tried, he shall receive the Iam. 1. 12.
Crown of life.

10 Hear my Son, and receive my words, and the years of thy life shall be
many.
Solomon does often repeat unto us one lesson, as they can tell that hear or
read his doctrine: and this is to help the ignorance of those which have a
good will to learn and to become obedient. For because of the corruption of our
flesh, we are very Romans 8. 7.
dull to receive and retain good doctrine; and the affection thereof, which is
enimitie against God, provoke us to rebellion: for it is not subject unto the
law of GOD, neither can be. Unto the which flesh we must not consent,
except we will be inexcusable. For as the repetitions of al one doctrine,
serve for the ease of them which become willing to learn, so also they serve
to make the careless and rebels inexcusable. And albeit that the Word is not
directed, but unto the children of God: yet it cease not to sound in the
ears of strangers which are mingled with the household of God: but because they
hear it with contempt, as they declare by not receiving the same with faith
and obedience: for this cause it serves unto their condemnation of death:
Contrarily, unto them that receive it, to them she is as life. Solomon does
so affirm, when he says to his Son, that his words shall increase the
years of his life. If then we desire long life, let us yield ourselves
willingly to learn, and diligently to hear the preaching of the Word: let us
submit ourselves thereunto with true obedience, laboring to perform that
which it commands us by reverence that we bear unto God, who is our Father,
and through fear that we have to disobey him. In this sort our years shall be
prolonged: not that we can live in this world beyond the term that God has
ordained from everlasting: but how short so ever our life is, it shall be so
long as is expedient for the salvation of our souls: as also we will content
ourselves therewith, knowing that by temporal death, our years are not
shortened, but that we shall enter into the true length of life, for the same
shall be without end. We show right well that we believe not Solomon, or that
we make no great accounte of life. There are not many which give ear unto the
Word of life, and yet less that receive it. In so doing, we declare us to be
folish, and that we make no count to come unto Wisdom, whereunto the wiseman
labors to bring us by his words, as he shows, saying,

11 I have taught thee in the way of VVisdome, and led thee in the paths of
righteousness: 12 When thou go, thy gate shall not be straight, and when thou
runnest, thou shall not fall. 13 Take hold of instruction, and leave her not:
keep her, for she is thy life.
When Solomon declares that by his words he leads men to Wisdom, and that
he guides them the right way unto life, then he reprooueth those of
folishnesse, and condemns them unto death, which will not hear and receive
his words: and therewith he shows what is the office of fathers unto their
children: that is, they should not maintain them in vain foolish things: but
in all Wisdom, that they may say with Solomon, I have taught thee, etc.
Likewise the duty of children, is, to be willing to learn, and to follow the
Wisdom and righteousness that their Fathers, Superiors, and Teachers shall
teach them by the Word of God. But as it is very hard to find many Parents
which do teach wisdom and righteousness, (for the most part cares not what
becomes of their children, so that they spend not their goods) so also the
greatest part of the world which are the youth, are the worst ruled, in such
wise that they care not what they do, so that they may live at ease. And
therefore, albeit that we have the Word of God daily preached unto us, the which
is the way of wisdom and righteousness, yet is it very hard to persuade many
that they are rebels against the Word, and that the way has been taught them,
etc. After the meaning of Solomon, which speaks unto obedient children: for
none but they do truly receive the way of wisdom, and walk in the paths of
righteousness. That Solomon does direct his words unto these, we may understand
by the promise following, when he says,

12 When thou go, etc. This promise can not appertain to the foolish and
scorners, neither unto the wicked and dissolute: Pro. 1. 26. and 2. 22. and 3.
32. Psalm. 37.
but contrarily, they are threatened with sorrow and affliction, with miseries
and calamities, with desolation and destruction: but it belongs unto the wise
and righteous. And forasmuch as Solomon does apply it unto them to whom he
did direct his former affirmation, saying, I have taught thee, etc. It follows
right well, that he speak not unto the foolish and disobedient, but to those
which through love of wisdom and righteousness, do hear and receive his
words. If we would then be exempted from sorrow and distress, and to be at
liberty with ease, as Solomon does promise, saying, When thou go, etc: If
we would avoid desolation and destruction, and dwell surely and safely, we
must have al our thoughts and purposes, and al our sayings and doings, (the
which are our ways and paths) to be taught by wisdom, and governed by
righteousness, etc. But though that Solomon has directed himself to the wise
and righteous, making them this affirmation, adding thereto the promise: yet
are we never so wise and well ruled, but that we have need to be admonished
not to forsake the way that has been taught us: neither are we always so
assured of the promises that are made us by the Word of God, but that we have
need to be exhorted and called upon to receive his admonitions, and not to
forsake them, promising us that we shall live: for he says, Take hold of
instruction: This verse has already been expounded in this same Chapter in
the tenth verse.

14 Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.
15 Avoid it, and go not by it: turn from it, and pass by. 16 For they can
not sleep, except they have done evil, and their sleep departs, except
they cause some to fall. 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink
tho wine of violence.
The way of the wicked is to be given to do hurt unto their neighbors
without cause, the which is a most wicked custom Pro. 1. 10.
and manner of doing: therefore Solomon has exhorted us in the 15. verse, Walk
not in the ways with them, etc. Likewise one of their ways is to love
foolishnes. Wherefore if we enter into their paths, then do we not walk in
the way of Wisdom: whereof it follows, that we fall into the straight and
distress, and light upon destruction, and so run unto death. For life,
stands only in the way of Wisdom and righteousness, in the which for to
preserve us, Solomon is not satisfied with the aduertisementes that he has
given: but again he does admonish us, that in no wise we should follow the
conditions and manners of the wicked. And for to show us that we should be
very careful to take heed from partaking with their doings, it suffices him
not to have said, Enter not etc. But further to express how much we ought to
abhor and detest the manners of the wicked, and to shun the^, he adds, 15
Avoid it, and go not by it. Forasmuch as the greatest part of the world
consists of the wicked and ungodly, which prosper, and are happy to the sense
of the flesh: therefore the rude, ignorant, and simple, and indiscreet are
tempted to follow them, and count themselves happy, if they may come to be
accounted with them, to be partakers of their prosperity. Solomon did
something touch it before, when he said, And tread not: he uses a word
that signifies to bless, or to think ones self happy: as if he did say,
do not count thy self happy to walk in the ways of the wicked: for
contrarily, blessed is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the
wicked. For this cause Solomon Psalm. 1. 1.
studieth earnestly to beat into us, and to make us understand in what horror
and execratio^ we ought to have the ways of the wicked: for having said,
Enter not, and walk not, he proceeds yet further, and because of our
rudeness and dullness, he gathers together many words, as Avoid, go not,
turn from it, and pass by. By this heap of words he shows well, that
there is great danger of communicating with the wicked and ungodly, and is like
as if a man would give himself into the hands of thieves. He compares a man
here unto a merchant that sends out his servant, or his son laden with
gold and silver, to buie and sell withal, and fearing he should be
spoiled, and robbed, and slain by thieves and robbers, warns him to avoid
the suspecte passages, and to turn out of the pathe, til he be past the
dangerous way. But besides this, we have to mark, that if we communicate with
the manners and conditions of the wicked, and think ourselves blessed to keep
them company, that then we are lost: and albeit that in such estate we would
be advanced, and labor to go forward, yet do we fall backwarde, in steed of
gooing forward one step, and become like unto Creafishes, or Seacrabbes which
go backewarde. There is no going forward but in wisdom and righteousness:
for in them, the years of life are prolonged, the which is lost through
wickedness and ungodliness, and that rightly, as Solomon does show,
alleging the reason wherefore we should avoid the way of the wicked, saying,

16 For they cannot sleep. Hereby he shows the great desire that the wicked
have to hurt their neighbors, and too bring them hinderance, when he says,
that they cannot sleep before they have executed their displeasure: and
therewith he shows, that look wherein they most delight, that is, to do
evil, even thereby are they most tormented, seeing they loose their sleep,
Pro. 2. 14
which is one of the chiefest parts of the ease of this life: If thou
sleep, thou shall not be afraid. It is then upon good cause Pro. 3. 24
that Solomon does admonish us to avoid the way of the wicked. For since they
are deprived of this gift of this sleep, that God gives to the wise and
righteous, and whereby this life is maintained; it follows that they cannot
remain long in this world, whereof also they are unworthy: and if they be
not worthy of it, so much the less are they worthy of eternal life. As then
they deprive themselves of sleep through vehement desire that they have to do
evil, the which they never obtain: so also they cannot be partakers of
eternal rest, but are sent down deep into darkness, where there is weeping
and gnashing of teeth. If then we communicate with them, after we have been in
distress, we shall fall into destruction. Wherefore we must take heed from
hurting of our neighbors, and to work their destruction, and we shall be
preserved from damnation: after this reason, he gives us yet another why we
ought to shun the way of the wicked, saying:

17 For they eat the bread, etc. Forasmuch as there is none but would be
counted wise and righteous, therefore to obtain this reputation truly, we
must abstain from al injury and violence, and to do wrong to no person: the
which the wicked in no wise do: but laboring to live at ease, they ravish the
goods of their neighbors, by unlawful means, by lawing, and subtlety, by
force and violence, and thus they eat the bread of wickedness, Pro. 1. 31
whereupon their destruction follows. Wherefore they shall eat of the fruit
of their ways, etc. It is the^ upon good cause that Solomon has exhorted us
to eschew their way. It may also be said that he shows by this reason, how
the wicked do not sleep, except they have wrought some evil first. For even
as it is accustomed by men to take their meat before sleep, even so it
follows (seeing they feed themselves with wickedness and violence, seeing
they delight to do wrong to their neighbors and to spoil them, that do not
sleep, before they have done evil by overthrowing and destroying their
neighbors. Furthermore by this reason we may learn to flee far from the
company of these wicked ones, and greatly to fear communicating with them in
their meats and drinks. For as the body is partaker of the nature of meats
it receives, even so, if we communicate with the meats and drinks of
wickedness and violence, we must needs become wicked and outrageous, and
have our hearts and minds corrupted, whereupon follows death etc.

18 But the way of the righteous shines as the light, that shines more and
more unto the perfect day. 19 The way of the wicked is as the darkness: they
know not wherein they shall fall.
Forasmuch as here above in the 14. and 15. verses, he has forbidden us to
enter into the path of the wicked, and that before in the 11. verse, he has
affirmed that he has taught us the way of wisdom, and then in the 12. verse,
has promised us that when we walk or run in the way of wisdom, that we
shall not be shut up in distress, and that we shall meet with nothing which
may make us fall to bring us to destruction: To the intent that we should make
no excuse for having forsaken this way, because we could neither see nor know
it, he shows us that we cannot pretend this excuse, for that this way is as
clear as the day at high noone, and that in the same there is nothing dark or
mistie, that may hide the same from us to be seen and known for to be our
way. Solomon does so mean, when he compares the paths of the just man, whom
he calls wise and righteous, unto a Light. If then we know nothing therein,
it is not because that the righteous do not show themselves plain enough by
sound doctrine holiness of life and honest conversation (for they are the salt
of the earth) but because we are either blind, or else by malice and Matthew. 5
envy do close the eyes of our understanding, that we will not know any thing:
but which worst is, there are some which seek by all means to quench this
light, by blaspheming the holy doctrine, and persecute the professors thereof.
But will or nil they the path of the righteous shall shine, and they that will
walk in the same shall rejoice and prosper, the which shall not be taken from
them, but rather shall go forward in growing until the day be risen in her
perfection, that is to say, til they have perfect joy, and full blessedness in
the kingdom of heaven. In this world this joy and prosperity are not perfect,
but as the day grows according too the ascending of the Sun, even so is it
needful that we should profit 1. Cor. 15.
more and more daily, until that all things be fulfilled, and that God be al
in all things. Besides this, when the pathe of the righteous is said to be
shining, and compared unto the light of the Sun, we ought to understand, that
as a man walking in the brightness of the day, sees, and knows where he
goes, and takes heed from stumbling and falling, even so also when we walk
in the paths of the righteous, wherein we are guided by the word Psalm. 119.
which is a light unto our feet, we know whither we go, and are assured not
to perish. They then which are ignorant and apply not their mind to
understand the word, do not walk in the paths of the righteous, what fair
show of holiness soever they pretend outwardly: neither those also which are
uncertain whether God does love them, and whether he will save them or no,
do not walk in the same way, albeit that by straightness of life they brag
to be in the state of perfection, the which is not found but in wisdom,
righteousness, and true dealing: and thus they fail in two sorts. For first
of all, doubting of the love of GOD, and saying that they are in the state of
perfection, they contrary themselves: for it rightwell follows, that if they
be perfect, that God loves them, seeing they are such as he commands them
to be, you shall be therefore perfect, as your father Mat. 5. 47.
which is in heaven is perfect. Secondarily, in that they set perfection in the
observing of man's traditions, and devilish doctrines. The third error may be
added, to be, in that they boast themselves of perfection, of the which the
wise, righteous, and faithful, have but a small beginning in this present life:
contrarily they should have no need to ask God forgiveness for their
sins, as they are taught of the Lord to do it. Likewise these proud Matthew. 6
persons which boast themselves of the state of perfection, as Monks, and
Nuns, albeit that with their mouths they say, Forgive us, yet they think
not to have need of the grace and mercy of God, seeing they make works of
supererogation, as they say, by the which they think to merit for other, and
chiefly for them that do well to their Convent and Cloister: And if they
deserve for other, by a stronger reason for themselves. But as in their state
(which they call of perfection) they perfectly serve the devil, and make them
whom they deceive, to serve him: even so also they merit to be partakers with
the Devil in eternal damnation, whereunto they draw them which rather
believe their lies than the sincere truth of god. Furthermore, when the shining
of the path of the righteous is compared unto the light which goes and
glistereth, that is to say, unto the light which grows higher and higher: we
may not think that so soon as we have any taste of the Gospel, that by and by
we are in the paths of the righteous, and that we must stay there, as if we
were far enough forward. But as the Sun al ways rises, till he come unto
his perfection: even so when we have once gotten any savor of the Gospel, we
must labor to attain perfection: whereunto for Ephe. 4.
to be guided, the Lord in his Church has appointed workmen. And forasmuch as
we must grow unto perfection, and that by the ministry of the word, it
follows, we must not be grieved though the Ministers cease not by diverse
exhortations to open the same unto us, but should receive the same right
gladly, and judge ourselves blessed, for that the Sun of righteousness does
so often visit us, and shine in our hearts. For if the worldlings are glad to
see the Sun, and do judge themselves happy when he warmeth the earth in due
season, to make it fruitful: by a stronger reason, the coming of the Son of
righteousness, which makes us fruitful in all goodness, righteousness and
truth, ought right well to rejoice us, instructing us by the example of David,
who says, But Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon Psalm. 4. 6.
us.

But we cannot be glad at the coming of this brightness, because we are
men, and that we will not be reproved though John. 3. 1^. John. 1. 5. Ephe.
5. 8.
we be never so faulty, and that our works be evil. The light is come
into the world, but men loved darkness more than light. Now of our own
nature we love these darknesses so much, that we deserve to be called nothing
but darkness. Wherefore, if we would have true joy at the coming of this
brightness, we must suppress our nature, and be regenerated and renewed by the
holy Ghost. This is it that Saint Paul commands, Let us cast away the works
of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. If we do thus, it may
be said of us, Ye were Romans 3. 12.
sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord. But ye brethren,
are not in darkness, that that day should come upon you as a thief.
Furthermore, seeing that the paths of the Ephe. 5. 8. 1. These. 5. 4.
righteous shines, it follows that the false Nicodemitans do not walk
therein: for they which walk in the day, desire not to be hid. Much less then
do the Papists walk therein, and these wretched intermistes or newters,
which reject the pure word, which is the Son that does show us this path,
and does guide us therein. And seeing that the word is our guide, it is not
enough that it be preached unto us, but also we must follow it, to be directed
right thereby: as in the night, they which desire to hold the right way, will
follow the light going before.

19 The way of the wicked, etc. For to show and better to point us the path of
the righteous, he sets the way of the wicked in opposition against it, and
co^pareth the same unto darkness, which is contrary unto light: whereof
insueth, that they which walk therein, and they that follow the manners and life
of the wicked, neither see nor know what they do, and have no knowledge of
wisdom, righteousness nor faithfulness. Our Lord does well show it, saying:
Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. For Luke. 23. 34
as they that know not how their business goes forward, cannot rejoice, but
are sorrowful and heavy, and think themselves in a miserable case: even so
also they which walk in the ways of the wicked, have no sure joy, nor steadfast
prosperity: for since they are in darkness, they know not where they become.
And albeit that in the sight of the eyes, and outward appearance, to the sense
of the flesh, and judgment of the world, the wicked are they which have
greatest joy, and that laugh most of all, and do most enjoy the pleasures and
lusts of this life, and abound in wealth and riches for the which they are
esteemed happy: yet notwithstanding because these things are of no continuance,
and that within a while after they feel great troubles, and sorrows, and that
they see themselves overthrown with the great miseries and calamities (as they
are threatened with them here above,) therefore we must not judge their state
and condition to be joyful and prosperous: as also our Lord shows Pro. 1. 26
Luke. 6.
them. But seeing the way of the wicked, is, the life they lead, in mannerrs
and doings, the which are known by their fruits and works, which are the
works of the flesh, and are well known: Gal. 5. 19.
It might be asked in what sort Solomon says, that their ways are like unto
darkness? I answer, Albeit the faithful being taught by the word of God, do
know well what the works of the flesh are, whereunto the wicked consent and
obey, following their lusts, and that they know for to fly and abhor them,
and rebuke them, that by their reprehension the wicked might confess their
faults (as Saint Paul here to does exhort us) and have no fellowship with Ephe.
5. 1.
the unfruitful works of darkness, but even reprove them rather, etc: yet
nevertheless they are like unto darkness: for most commonly the wicked do
never confess that they do evil, no more then they which walk by night,
know whether they go out of their way or no. And yet let a man bring them
light, they are so amazed at times, that they can not discern where they be:
or else, they are so far out of their way, that they can not tell how to come
in again. Even so, albeit the wicked are reproved by their consciences, or by
the exhortations that are made unto them out of the word of God, and so be
lightened: yet do they not know where they are, neither can apply to take the
good way. Caine, Pharao, Saul, and Judas do testify it, and the wicked
nowadaies do feel it: and chiefly they to whom God has sent his word, to
the end that daily it may be declared unto them, do feel and know the evil
they do. But because they have conceived hatred without cause against them
that seek but their salvation, they are blind, and cannot get out of this
dark way, but from day to day entangle themselves further therein, and do run
into a laberinth wherout they cannot escape. These people and their like think
themselves strong and mighty, and they seem to be well stayed, and that they
cannot perish, because they are enuironned with flatterers which do commend
them, and bless them, and in the mean while they know not how they are
deceived, and how in this sort they walk in darkness, wherethrough they
go to destruction, though they know it not: and this is the cause why Solomon
says, That they know not where they fall. This falling sometime begins in
this present life, to wit, when the wicked are so sore affraide that they
despair, as did Caine, and Judas, or else have such afflictions which torment
them, and cause the^ to acknowledge and confess their wickednesses, for the
which they will not, nor cannot repent them. And therefore, they are shut up
into such a straight, that they know not how to escape: but more and more
entangle themselves in dangerous difficulties wherewith at last they are beaten
down and loose their life without knowing what shall be come of them, saving
that they can not look but for eternal damnation: or else they think it stands
with them after this life, as with a beast when it is dead. Pharao, the
persecuter of the children of Israel, and Saul of David, have thus Matth^. 24.
Luke. 16. 2. Pet. 2.
fallen. It happens also, that the falling is so sodeine, that they perceive
it not in this life, but coming upon them unlooked for, it rauisheth and
violently takes away the wicked even in the midst of their iollitie. The world
destroyed by the flood has so proved it. Likewise did the Sodomites and
Gomorrhians: and the rich glutton also. All these people are set forth by the
Scriptures, for examples of eternal fall to them which shall work wickedness:
and the faithful hearing these things, ought to tremble and fear, not for to
despair and distrust the goodness of GOD, but that with all humbleness they
should confess their misery and corruption, and that they should promise
themselves nothing; but might know that if GOD would execute his wrath
against them, as they do deserve, they were undone: and for that that they
remain and do not perish, it comes from the working of the good will of God.
So make an end of your own salvation with fear and Phi. 6. 12. 1. Cor. 10. 6.
trembling. Now these are examples to us, etc.

Moreover we may note in the Antithesis and opposition that Solomon makes
between the paths of the righteous and the ways of the wicked, that albeeit
the wicked do rejoice in their wickedness, and would be seen, and indeed show
themselves to be praised for their doings, yet nevertheless their way cease
not t^ be like unto darkness: for they hide themselves, insomuch as they will
not be known such as they be indeed, but will be counted men full of honesty,
as they brag with open mouth, but oftentimes against their conscience, which
conde^neth them, from whence 1 Pet. 5. 5. Iam. 4. 6.
also oftentimes comes their fall: For God resists the proud, and gives
grace to the humble and lowly. Contrarily, although the righteous, following
the commandments of our Lord, do Mat. 6. 1.
not their works before men for to be seen of them: yet notwithstanding
their paths ceasseth not to be clear as the light: Mat. 5. 16.
for after the commandment, their light shines before men, not only before
the good, but also amongst the wicked, amongst whom Saint Paul would have
us to live without reproach: As S. Peter also, saying, Dearly beloved, I
beseech you, as strangers and Phi. 2. 15. 1. Pet. 2. 11
pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, etc. For though the wicked do blame
the righteous, and persecute them as evil doers, yet can they not say, but that
they do against their own conscience, as they are oftentimes compelled to
confess it.

20 My son, hearken unto my words, incline thine ear unto my sayings. 21 Let
them not depart from thine eyes, but keep them in the mids of thine heart. 22
For they are life unto those that find them, and health unto all their flesh.
When Solomon does continue speaking so gently, and is not weeried with often
exhorting us one thing, and that he is not satisfied that we should apply one
part of our wits only unto his exhortations, but would, and craves of us
to give ourselves wholly with constancy and perseverance, he does therein
teach such as are ministers of his word, how they ought to behave themselves
toward them they teach. First of al, except they know them to be desperate,
indurate and obstinate, mockers and scorners of good counsel, holy
exhortations, and wholesome corrections, persecutours of the truth, and of the
lovers thereof, they ought to speak lovingly, as the father does to his son.
Secondly, as though through weakness and dulnes they had not well understood
and borne away the former instructions, let them begin to preach the same again
unto their hearers, not twice, but thrice, yea four times, and more oftener,
if need require: let them not wax weary of admonishing one thing often.
Thirdly, let them labor to use such vehemency, that they may not only awake
up their corporal ears, but also stir up all the senses of man to
understand, receive and keep their exhortations, for to go forward constantly
in them, and in no wise to forget them. He also gives a lesson even to us al:
First of al, that as he speaks amiably, so should we also love and embrace
his exhortatio^s: and as he declares himself to be our father, saying, My
son, so we also should show ourselves his children, acknowledging him to be
our father, not only generally, but also particularly, yea father of every one
of us as he himself declares, saying to every one of us, My son, Now
seeing he has no need of us, and that we can do nothing without him, we
are very unthankful, very blockish, and beastlike, if we do not confess him
to be our father, and also show ourselves to be his children. For to do this
well, we must give diligent ear unto his words, the which Solomon calls his:
not that he is God, but only his Minister and his instrument by who^ he
sends his words: and therefore, inasmuch as they come from his mouth, he
calls them his. For thoroughly to understand them, he would have us apply
wholly our ears, preparing them to hear what is said unto us in the sermons,
that our eyes also should be open without turning away from them by distrust and
uncertainty, by rebellion and disobedience, by contempt and disdain: but that
we should have them in so great estimation, that we should never suffer them to
depart from us, but that our hearts should be continually armed with them, as
he teaches us, when he says,

21 Let them not depart from thine eyes. Hereby we learn that Solomon
requires faith and obedience of us, and so, that he is both a law giver and an
Evangelist, as has been said here before in the first Chapter. For when he
calls us to hear and to prepare our ears, it is to the end that we should do
according as we shall be commanded: It is also to the end that we should believe
that which shall be preached unto us. For faith comes by hearing, Rom, 10. 17.
and hearing by the word of God. But Solomon does yet express this same more
plainly unto us, when he adds, Let them not depart, etc. For he speaks not
here of the bodily eyes, the which ^r not capable of the word, which is
spiritual, but of the thoughts and inward mind where with we embrace the law of
God, to obey it, without declining from it. Likewise by the Eyes, he means
the knowledge and intelligence, whereby we delight in the word of God and are
assured of his goodness and of his love toward us, as he does declare the same
by his gracious promises, which are a part of his word. That we must thus
understand that which he says of the eyes, it is manifest enough: but again
he gives the same to be understood, when he says immediately after, But keep
them in the mids of thine heart. there the eyes of the body see nothing. The
scripture also in diverse other places speaks of the eyes in the same sense.
Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord. I lift up mine eyes to thee, that dwell
in the heavens. The eyes of the blind, shall see Psalm. 25. 15. and. 4. 21. and.
1. 23. Esaias. 29. 18. and 31. 3. and. 35. 5. Mat. 6. 22. Job. 11. 40.
out of darkness. The eyes of the seeing shall not be shut, and the ears of them
that hear, shall hearken. Then shall the eyes of the blind be lightened, and the
ears of the deaf be opened. The light of the body is the eye. If thou did
believe, thou should see the glory of God. And when Solomon has been
already so careful to commend wisdom unto us, in like sort as he now
commends us his words: we must understand that by his words he guides and
leads us unto wisdom, and that otherways we cannot attain unto it, and
consequently that his words are not earthly, but divine. Furthermore, forasmch
as he calls every one of the^ his son, (not carnally, but by adoption and
regeneration of the holy Ghost) to whom he directs his word, we ought to be
assured that we are the children of God, when we gladly hear the preaching of
the Gospel, and do diligently frequent the same, and do yield our hearts
and understandings thereunto, to be guided in true obedience and assurance of
the goodness of God toward us, and to forsake al rebellion, and to cast of
al distrust in soundnes of heart void of al dissimulatio^ and hypocrisy.
Besides this, for to learn well our lesson in that which Solomon continues and
often tells the same exhortatio^s, we must acknowledge our weakness and
ignorance, and by desiring to be fortified and well instructed, we may not be
grieved often to hear one doctrine, and that the same admonitio^s, and
reprehe^sio^s, be often repeated unto us: and that we do not only prepare our
ears to hear the sermon, but that we subdue al our se^ses, as Solomon teacheh
us saying, Let them not depart from thine eyes. For albeit he speaks of the
spiritual eyes, yet when after the custom of speaking, men refer the sight
unto all the senses, there is no inconvenience that by this kind of speech we
should understand, that we must captiuate all our senses unto the word.

22 For they are life. As Solomon does often exhort us one thing, so also for
to encourage us to follow his exhortations, and to Verse. 4. 10. 13. Cap. 3. 2.
8. 16. 22.
confirm us more and more in the assurance of Gods goodness, he repeateth
oftentimes the very same promises that he has made here above. After the
custom of the world, that which is most used, is least of al esteemed: and
also it is said that men are weary to eat always of one loaf. Wherefore it
might seem to be good that Solomon did not so often set forth one promise,
for fear it should be despised. But as a very healthful stomach, that does
well digest, does not refuse any good meat, though his diet be not changed, and
that the same meat be often given him: even so he also which has a good
heart unto God, knowing that he has need to be daily confirmed in the assurance
of Gods goodness, will never despise one promise, although the same be often
reiterated: and chiefly when it offers that which is to be desired above al
thing, because it is esteemed of greatest profit and lasts longest. The
promise that Solomon presently makes us, is even such. For thereby he offers
life to them which hold fast his sayings, that is to say, to them which do not
depart from the exhortatio^s that they hear: but as the same is offered, so
also they come for to meet and receive them in humble submissio^ and true
obedience. Now though there were nothing but this present life promised here,
yet ought we not to despise it, but to rejoice thereat, for it is Gods gift,
which has given us this mercy to be created in this world by him, and does
continue it, promising to maintain us long in this life: the which as it is
miserable, and is so called and esteemed, yet it is not in that as we take the
same from God, but because we defile it by our sins, therefore we deserve to
suffer much misery: and indeed, we suffer the same one in one sort, and
another in another. And albeit the wicked know not this, yet do they greatly
rejoice of this life, and esteem it above al things, so that nothing is more
precious to them then it. By a stronger reason when we know that the same is
the gift of God, the which is not promised, for afterward to bring us death:
but that this present life is promised unto us, for to make us hope for the
eternal life, the which will never fail, for it is contained under the promise,
as it has been expounded heretofore. When I say, we have this knowledge, this
promise ought to be highly esteemed of us, and we should be very careful to
follow the means which are showed us, for to co^serue this life: and the
rather seeing it costeth us nothing to do it, but have every day the means
freely offered unto us by preaching; there remains nothing on our side,
saving that we should seek (by not departing from them) to meet and receive
them. And because that a miserable and paineful life is counted no life, but
rather death, Solomon promises health unto al creatures which will seek his
words, not only corporal, but spiritual and eternal. This health has been
spoken of here above in the 3. Chap. verse 8. Would we then be assured of
health and life? Let us give ear unto the word of wisdom.

23 Keep thine heart with all diligence: for thereout comes life.
It is the heart then that must make our ears to incline, and our eyes fixed
on the holy exhortations, as Solomon has well declared the same unto us, when
calling our ears to incline, and our eyes to be bent to his words, he would
have us to keep them in the mids of our hearts. He has not then promised life
and health, for the inclination of the ears, nor for the sight of the eyes,
but for the care and diligence of the heart. For this cause Solomon concludes,
admonishing us that we should keep our heart with all diligence, and he gives a
reason, For therout comes life. For well to keep our heart, we have need of
very meet and convenient armor, the which Solomon has taught us here above,
and have seen that the weapons of the heart are words, commandments,
wisdom, and understanding. Whereupon follows, that albeit we are
admonished to keep our heart, yet it is not to say that the same is in our
power, but we must pray unto God, that he will vouch safe to defend and keep
it. For the Lord gives wisdom, etc. For this cause also we are exhorted
here above in the 3. Chap. and 5. verse, Trust in the Lord with all thine
heart, etc. And albeit these defenses come of God, and not of ourselves, yet
must we take heed that we be not negligent, as if in vain Solomon had
exhorted us to keep our heart with all diligence. For though it be not in our
power, because of the corruption of our nature, yet this admonition serves to
advertise us of our duty, to the end that we knowing that we cannot do it,
should have our refuge unto God, who only has the power to defend and keep
our hearts: and yet in the mean while we should not sleep and do nothing:
but as the Lord does offer his word unto us, and thereby his wisdom; even so
also our thoughts and cogitations, our affection and desires, should be wholly
given there unto, and that we should govern all our life as wise men and well
learned. If we have thus our refuge unto God, we will keep our hearts withal
diligence, albeit therein is nothing of ours, but so much as it pleases God of
his grace to judge it ours. And forasmuch as the weapons for to keep our
hearts are such, as is said, we may gather that we loose our hearts, by
rebellion, incredulity, foolishnes, slothfulness and ignorance, and
consequently our life: for this that we live and shall live, is because our
hearts are well fenced with the former things. Solomon does well signify it,
when having warned us to keep our hearts, he says, For out thereof comes life.
In the which he makes two reasons, the first is, that he gives the reason why
he exhorts us to keep our hearts. The second is, that we have life because
our hearts are kept. And as the keeping and preserving of them is the gift of
God, so is the life also which comes thereof: whereupon it follows that we
cannot deserve the same, as do the popish Friars falsely lie.

24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lips far from thee.
Solomon here above in the 14. and. 15. verses has forbidden us the paths of
the wicked: and for the better instruction thereof, has made an Antithesis of
the same with the pathe of the righteous, and for to know how we may walk in
the one, and fly the other, he has exhorted us to give ear unto his words.
And because it is not sufficient to have our ears attentive, and our hearts
well fenced, etc. except by the governance thereof our outward works, be well
framed, and our faults corrected, whereby we hurt our neighbors in hindering
the^, either in their goods, or in their bodies, or in their good fame, or in
their souls, by slanders and evil examples: For if the tree be good, it will
bring forth good fruits, Matt. 1^
and to make it more fruitful, they use to cut away the dead branches and al
superfluities, and must be purged from al those things that are hindrances to
let his fruit. For this cause Solomon after having instructed our hearts,
which is as the root whereby the tree lives, and by the which it brings
forth his fruits, then he labors to refourme the life outwardly. And first
of all he has respect to reform the mouth from the which he would have us
to put away frowardnes: and therein he accuses us to be inwardly froward: For
from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Mat. 12. 34.
For this cause also he has labored heretofore to reform the inward parts.
If we will well follow this reformation of the mouth, we must chiefly follow
that which God by Moses commands in the 3. and 9. commandments of the law.
Therefore to put away frowardness from our mouths, we must abhor all
periuries, blasphemies, and superfluous and idle oaths, and also to abstain
from pronou^cing at any time the name of god, but only with fear and
humbleness to glorify God. For according as he is holy and worthy, even so
ought we to beware from taking it in such sort, that we might seem to have
the same in contempt, or that we give occasion of the slaundering thereof. To
be short, we must take heed of al manner of idle words, lascivious and
wanton talk which gives offense, and may cause us for to forget, and to make
any other to forget the fear and reverence that men should have unto God, and
wherewith his name should be blasphemed: for seeing that his praise ought to be
always in our mouths, if we use lascivious and wanton songs, it is a plain
argument that we make no count to give him the honor that is due unto him: and
thus we despise the name of GOD, and by us it is blasphemed so that by the
vnsauerinesse of our lips, the which should be far from us, we give an
occasion of the abasing of the holy name of God: for the which we must look
for grievous punishment. Leuit. 24. 14 2. Kin. 19. 35
For the Lord will not hold him giltles that takes his name in vain. By this
and other threatenings, that are made against the blasphemers, we may
understand that blasphemy is a most horrible sin, and worthy of great
punishment. The Magistrates which bear the sword, ought to look straightly
thereunto, etc. They also which have the office of teaching the people, ought
to be very careful to speak the sincere truth, to the end that having their
mouths void of frowardness, and their lips free from wantonness, they may
the better purge the same of the peoples, so much as in them lies: contrarily,
the Lord will ask the blood of the people which perish, at the hands of such
pastors. And since that for to put away frowardness from our mouth, we may
not bear false witness, it follows that we must abstain from perjury in
judgment, from lying, from backbiting, from flattering, and from al manner of
words, whereby our neighbor is wounded in his goods and good name, etc. And as
for to put away this frowardness, we must beware to take the name of God in
vain, and to bear false witness even so must we not suffer in our presence
any to sin against these 2. commandments. For we must zealously maintain
the honor and glory of our God, wheresoever we become, except we will be
infidels and unfaithful, traitors and wicked: considering that he is our
Creator, and Father, our King, and our Savior. Likewise, we must in no wise
suffer that any speak injuries of our neighbors: seeing we must love them as
ourselves, and that they are our flesh: otherwise, it were as if we take the
name of God in vain, and that we did bear false witness against our
neighbor. Notwithstanding we must not spare to chide them, to rebuke them, to
blame them, and to accuse them whom we know to lead a slanderous and
dissolute life. Thus doing, we backbite them not, we hurt not their good name:
but endeavor to bring them to amendment, or else to chasten them, that others
may fear, and by such examples may withdraw themselves from evil. But in this
doing we must take heed we be not led with hatred, with envy, with anger,
or with desire of vengeance: but only with the desire of the glory and honor
of GOD, and with the edifiyng and salvation of our neighbors: otherwise, we
deceive our hearts. If any man seem to be devout, and refraineth not his
tongue, etc. this man's religion Iam. 1. 26.
is in vain. We must also beware to condemn our neighbors in judging too
proudly of their doings and sayings, and to make a law for their life: and
also that we may not use any evil words, which proceed from a corrupt and
wicked judgment, whereby Iam. 4. 11.
we arrogantly condemn whatsoever displeases us in our neighbors: for in so
doing, we obey not the law. But so doing (I say) our mouths are full of
poison, and yet we will appear in prayer honest folks: etc. But God allows
not such blessings. By it we bless our God and Father: and thereby we curse
men made Iam. 3. 9.
after the likeness of God.

25 Let thine eyes behold the right, and let thine eye liddes direct thy way
before thee.
Solomon would not have us to look here and there, where we have not to
do, for fear we should go out of the way, and should wander into things
that nothing apperteine unto us, or that might be hurtful to us or to our
neighbors: but to look right before us, that every one look to his own
work, according to the state wherein he is called of God, and that every one
should follow his office. It is not without cause that Solomon demands this:
For we be curious and easy to cast our sight hither and thither, we fall
away, and forsake our state and office: In which doing, we bring ourselves in
danger, and it happens oftentimes that we bring hurt to our neighbors: and
which is much worse, we dishonor God: for our sight which is not right,
causes us to fall into disobedience and rebellion. Our state is to acknowledge
one only God, to worship him, to commend, to praise and to call upon him: but
if we lift up our eyes for to mark here and there how the world is full of
idolatry, and that we earnestly look unto the fair show of holiness, they
have in the service of their Idols and goodly gaye Images; we are in danger
to forget God, and to worship strange Gods, as did the children of Israel, as
we may know by the complaints that God has made against them by Moses and
his Prophets, and also the holy histories do declare the same: and as the
Papists do at this day. Our office is to hear the voice of our great Pastor,
for to follow and hang upon him, and to put all the trust of our salvation in
him only: but if we look to these fair schools of Popish and devilish
divinity, beholding the great multitude of the worldly wise, which follow it,
and lead after them people without number, there is danger lest we should
desire to hear strangers. It behooves us therefore 1. Cor. 7. 1. Heb. 13. 4.
to lead a chaste and a shamefast life, according to Gods commandment, Thou
shall not commit adultery, and as Saint Paul does teach us: but if contemning
the holy state of Matrimony, or else that we are not pleased with our lawful
yoke fellow, gaze here and there on the beauty of men and women, we are
already Mat. 5. 28.
whoremongers before God, and are in danger to defile and pollute our bodies,
and to make them the members of an harlot: as Genesis 6. 2. and 34. 1. and 5. 19
befell unto the sons of God: and virgins are in danger to be violated, as
was Dina. And not this only, but also we are given to sins against nature,
as were the Zodomites and Gomorrhians, and those whereof Saint Paul speaks.
But as by such filthiness God has been dishonored, so also could he well tell
how Romans 1. 26.
to revenge it. By the which vengeance he teaches us, that whosoever should
follow such iniquities, could not escape his hand. Our duty is not to set
our hands on our neighbors goods, for to ravish and take the same from them,
but rather to preserve them, so far as we can: but if through covetousness, or
impatient bearing of the poverty that pincheth us, we look unto our
neighbors substance, we bring ourselves in danger to be thieves or robbers,
to covet the riches of our neighbors, and for it to envy them, to hate and
malice them, even to kill them, if we could, whereof death ensues: for it is
said, Whosoever hates his brother, is a manslear: and we know that no
murderer has eternal life 1. Ioh. 3. 15.
dwelling in him. And when we know that it is God that sends our
afflictions and adversities, seeing he does nothing but justly, and as he
knows to be expedient for his faithful servants; our duty is to bear them
patiently without murmuring, and to prefer our miseries and calamities before
all the ease, delights, and pleasures of this world, and before al, that ever
our flesh can wish or desire: but if through impatiencie we turn aside our
eyes for to mark the prosperous state of the wicked, we shall be tempted to
follow them, and to desire to be like them, for to have part of their
prosperity, wherein we deceive ourselves: for this prosperous state, is of no
continuance. The office of Magistrates is, to give right unto all that demand
the Psalm. 37. 2.
same, and to minister good and speedy justice, as well to the least as to the
greatest, as well to the poor, as to the rich: but if they turn aside their
eyes to mark other matters, and not to conscience: if they delight to see and
receive presents and gifts: if they turn their eyes unto their parents and
friends, to the rich and mighty, to their Gosseps and neighbor, any of
these things do Psalm. 82. 7.
easily pervert judgment, and make them not to give right unto the owners.
Wherefore though they be Gods, yet shall they die as men, etc. We may here
speak of the duty of Ministers, of Fathers and Mothers, and al such as have
charge over others.

26 Ponder the pathe of thy feet, and let al thy ways be ordered aright. 27
Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left: but remove thy foot from evil.
He uses a similitude taken from them, which sell and buy by weight, and
which for to separate the heavy from the light, and to choose the best from
the worst, do use balances and other instruments and engines to way withal:
and to the end that they may learn to discern and know the best and the most
lawful merchandise, they look unto the even setting of the balances, and to
make them stand right. For he says, Ponder the pathe, etc: and that we may
ponder it well, he would that as before waying, we use to dress and mende
the balances and other engines, even so should we order and direct our ways,
that we might know whether our paths were good and lawful. Now for to
learn well how we shall obey this exhortation, we must understand that as
our feet in the Scriptures are taken for our affections, even so our paths
ought to be taken for whatsoever we are led to by our affections. Our paths
then, is our outward conversation, our manners and customs, our works and
deeds, wherein we bestow the time of our life, and whereby we maintain one
another, do service and pleasure, and help one of us another. And as we judge
that the Merchants do not behave themselves faithfully in their estate, when
they care not to have good waightes and measures, and sell the light for as much
as the weighty, the small measure as the true, and care for nothing but for
their particular profit, according as their concupiscences do lead them
about: even so, if we follow our carnal affections, not taking heed what we
do, so that we may do as we lust, and take our delight and pleasure, we
rashly proceed, and employ not ourselves lawfully and faithfully to serve our
neighbors. The which is abominable before God, and is not pleasing to men of
sound and upright judgment, and is an offense unto the simple and ignorant.
For this cause Solomon is not contented with the pondering of our paths: for
the wise of this world do weigh (as they think good) their paths: when they
so govern themselves by natural reason and carnal wisdom, that they win
reputation, and are esteemed in the world. It seems well also unto the
dissolute and wanton, that they ponder deeply their paths, when they narowly
watch, lest they should be hindered of their pleasure, and look circumspectly
about them, whereby they may come to the end of their purpose, be it right or
wrong. It is not enough therefore that we ponder our paths, but as Solomon
demands, we must let al our ways be ordered aright: that is to say, that all the means we follow to guide the buisines that we have to do one with the
other, should be good and lawful, just and reasonable. Now they shall be such,
if renouncing the affection of the flesh, which is not subject to the law of
God, we labor to yield ourselves obedient unto the Word of God, without
adding to or diminishing any thing therefrom in any wise. It is the same only,
whereby we must have our affections framed, whereby our paths must be guided,
and whereby all our life ought to be ruled. We ought well to learn this, when
we see how God commends unto us so carefully, his only Word, both by Moses
and by his Prophets, and finally by Jesus Christ, his Apostles and Ministers:
and that he threateneth with horrible vengeance those which shall despise it,
and will neither believe nor obey it. For this cause Solomon desiring our
salvation, does teach us how we should ponder the paths of our feet, and
order all our ways aright when he says,

Turn not to the right hand, etc. Solomon is not the first that has given
this doctrine. Moses which went before him, has said, Ye shall put nothing
unto the Word which I command you, neither shall ye take ought therefrom. Take
heed therefore, Deu. 42. and 5. 32. and 12. 8. 32.
that ye do as the Lord your God has commanded you: turn not aside to the
right hand, nor to the left. Ye shall not do after all these things, that we do
here this day: that is, every man whatsoever seems him good in his own
eyes. Thou shall put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom. But thou shall
not decline and 28. 14.
from any of the words, which I command you this day, either to the right
hand or to the left, to go after other Gods to serve them. Be ye therefore of
a valiant courage, to observe and do all that is written in the book of the
law of Moses, that ye turn Joshua. 23. 6. 1. Kin. 18. 21
not therefrom to the right hand nor to the left. How long halte ye between
two opinions? This is not then a new doctrine, but most ancient, and is
needful for us to follow, if we will truly say, that we are Christians. For
our Lord Jesus Christ has given us this doctrine, when he preached that
which he heard of his John. 8. 26. and 6. 38.
Father: and that he witnesses he came not to do his own will, but the same
of God his Father, who sent him. His Apostles also followed him, preaching
nothing but the pure Gospel, that they might teach the right way, and hold the
people therein. Wherefore we must take good heed of the Pope and of his
mainteiners, which brag themselves to be the successors of the Apostles, and
yet by strange doctrines, and men's traditions they labor to make us decline
from the pure doctrine of the truth, from the which when we are turned away,
we easily give over ourselves unto all kind of wickednesses, and know not how
to come back: and which worst is, we delight therein, and so make vice virtue.
Thus doing, we decline to the righthand, or to the left. For to turn to the
right hand or to the left, is none other thing, than to despise the good, that
is taught and commanded us by the Word, and to give ourselves over unto evil.
Solomon does well signify it, when having said, Turn not, etc: he adds, But
remove thy foot from evil. Wherein first of all he shows us, that there is
no evil but that which is committed against the Word of God: for then we
decline, and not when we despise the commandments of men: and though they
allege us this, Whosoever hears you, etc: yet Luke 10. 16,
we must not be afraid, except they declare the pure word of God. Secondly,
that there is nothing but al evil, when we turn on the right hand or the left:
albeit that many things may be done which cannot be reproved before men. For
also as there is but God only which is good, so also should we not esteem any
thing to be good, but only that which is done after his holy, good, and just
commandment: but from man which is altogether corrupted, Genesis 6. 1.
which is carnal and sold under sin, can proceed nothing but all evil. etc.

The fifth Chapter.
1 My Son, hearken unto my wisdom, and incline thine ear unto my
knowledge, 2 That thou may regard counsel, and thy lips observe knowledge.
WHen Solomon exhorts us as his children, to hearken unto wisdom and
knowledge, the which he calls his, because that God had given him of his
grace, whereby also he communicates it unto us, as having charge to teach us:
And in that he often repeateth the same admonition, thereby we must understand
that it is a thing very needful for us to be attentive unto this wisdom:
otherwise he would not be so careful to repeat so often unto us one
sentence, seeing he speaks by the holy Ghost, whose speech is not
superfluous. He has already declared unto us diverse profits and fruits
which come of wisdom: and because he is not satisfied with this declaration,
he pursues to amplify the same, saying, that we must hearken unto wisdom,
to the end that we may keep his counsels, the which he has already given
us, and still remains ready to give us hereafter. Now amongst other counsels
and aduiseme^ts, he would have our lips to observe knowledge: that is, that
we should not speak but as wise and well learned, and that we should know
and learn what to speak, and how we must speak: not as the worldlinges
know, but after the instruction of our Father, and following his commandments,
whereby he counsels us what we have to do, and what to say. This is the
knowledge that we must learn, to the end that we may know what we should say,
and that we should not speak as amazed, as fools and insensed, nor as beasts
and ignorant, which are without understanding: nor yet as malicious, which
speak fraudulently, to deceive and hurt their neighbors. This counsel is
directed unto us al, and principally unto the Ministers of the Word, the which
ought to be so endued with knowledge, that others may draw from their Mat. 14.
15.
mouth: otherwise al goes to destruction: as if the blind lead the blind,
both fall into the ditche. To the end also that our lips should keep
knowledge, we must beware that we do not apply them to unlawful touchings,
as do whoremongers by unshamefast kisses, which are done without knowledge: for
if they knew well what they did, they would be much more afraid thereof then
of temporal death, when they know that by such lasciuiousnes they fall into
eternal damnation: and so it shall be a very dear kissing unto them, the which
they find sweet to the feeling of the flesh. Solomon giving a reason for the
which he would have our lips keep knowledge, does advertise us of this
sweetness and softness, when he says,

3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honicombe, and her mouth is
more soft then oil. 4 But the end of her is bitter as VVormewood, and sharp
as a two edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death, and her steps take hold
on hell. 6 She weighs not the way of life: her paths are moveable: thou
can not know them.
Here above, in the 2. Cap. and 16. verse, has bin declared what this strange
woman is, and wherefore she is so called.

The distilling of her lips, and the softness of her mouth lies in that,
that she flattereth with her words, as has been said, and shall be
treated of again, here under, in the seventh Chapter. Now that we must
abhor this honey and this oil of flatteries, and consequently, the kisses
and touchinges which follow the same, he shows well, when he says,

4 But the end of her, etc. As they which eat of Allume or drink the juice
thereof, do afterward feel the sharp taste in their mouths long after:
and as they that use knives with two edges, if they take not good heed do
easily wound themselves: eue^ so also they which delight in the flattering
style of the stranger, in her kisses and imbrasings, shall feel great sourenes,
and shall be stroke with mortal wounds for ever: as Solomon does show it, saying,

5 Her feet go down to death, etc. In the 2. Chapter and 18. and 19. verses,
this death has been treated of. But there is this difference, that there the
house of the whore is spoken of, which is herself, and al those which are
acquainted with her: and here her feet are spoken of, which are her evil
affections, her carnal desires, and her disordered lusts. But the things well
considered and joined together, come al to one end. For if the whore by her
concupiscences, enterprises, and inticements which follow her, go down to
death, and that she takes hold on hell, that she be snared with eternal
damnation: for when any sickness or hurt happens to any man, we say that he
has taken this sickness. It follows right well, that al they which consent unto
her desires, and have communication with her, shall be overthrown with death,
and taken with hell, from whence they shall not return, etc. If the whore and
her gallants and companions, go into such destruction, it is no meruel: for
they take neither counsel nor advise, neither strength nor knowledge, but do
rashly and amazedly proceed in ignorance and without aduisement. Solomon does
declare it, when he says,

6 She weighs not, etc. He that makes no count to follow the necessary
means to preserve life, is well worthy of death: He that cares not, neither
regards where he goes, deserves well to fall into the ditch, from whence he
can not get out: and forasmuch as naturally every man desires to live, we
will surely judge a man out of his wit, that will not care to preserve his
life, but will seek means to destroy it. Such are the whores and whormongers,
as Solomon does show us, saying, She weighs not the way of life, etc: for
albeit he does not speak but of the whore, yet does he give us well to
understand that the whoremongers shall not be exempted from the punishment due
unto their wickedness, seeing that God spares not the most weakest kind or
sex.

7 Hear ye me now therefore, O children, and depart not from the words of my
mouth.
When Solomon speaks unto children, he speaks as well to the Female as to
the Males. For as there are unshamefast whores, which do entice and deceive
foolish and indiscreet men: even so also there are wicked whoremongers, which
give their study to induce maids and indiscreet women to agree unto
uncleanness and filthiness, and to commit whoredoms. He gives the means unto
them both, whereby they may be kept from deceit: to wit, in hearing that which
shall be spoken in the name of God, who is Father both of Males and Females, and
also by his Word, and to give obedience unto that which they shall receive from
his mouth, when he speaks to them by his Ministers, which preach nothing but
his pure Word. Solomon, (as we have seen) makes gladly his exhortations
general, and then for more plain declaration he descends unto the particular
parts, that we may understand the sayings of his mouth, for to follow the^. The^
after this manner, he says,

8 Keep thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her house: 9
Lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 10 Lest
the stranger should be filled with thy strength, and thy labors be in the house
of a stranger, 11 And thou mourn at thine end, (when thou have consumed thy
flesh and thy body.) 12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and mine heart
despised correction: 13 And have not obeyed the voice of them that taught me,
nor inclined mine ear to the^ that instructed me? 14 I was almost brought into
al evil, in the midst of the congregation, and assembly.
If we will then diligently hear and not go back from his sayings, we must
take heed that our manners and living do not agree with the affections and
desires of whores and whoremo^gers, and that we have no manner of familiarity
with such people, for to consent unto their lusts, and agree unto their
flatterings and sweet words: contrarily, if we follow them, if we desire the
entrance of their gates, for to fulfill our wicked concupiscences, we are out
of the way of life, we are shut out of the household of God, we have no 1. Cor.
6. 9. Ephe. 5. 3. Ephe. 5. 10.
entrance in thither: Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolators,
etc. shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. But fornication, and al uncleanness,
or covetousness, let it not be once named amongst you. We may well resort unto
such, for to reprove them. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, but even reprove them rather. This is the greatest plague that ca^
happen to any man to be deprived of the house of God: for in that case he has
neither part nor portion but in death and hell: but before that these miserable
creatures and infected, do feel and perceive such calamity, they spend and
spoil their own substance, spending the same with such people as they ought
not, and that will give the^ never the more thanks, but are cause of their
destruction, and have no pity nor compassion upon such pore miserable
spend-thrifts, albeit they spoil themselves even to the hard bones, by giving
of presents, and making superfluous and excessive costs, for to enjoy their
wicked desires. Solomon does well signify it, when he says,

9 Lest thou give. etc. When al riches belong unto God, and that he give part
to them that pleases him, for to preserve the years of their life, in what
sort so ever we possess and come by them, whether it be by patrimony, gift,
getting, or by our handie labor, we must confess therein that God does not
honor us, and mainteineth us in this life, to the end that we should not be
frustrate of the years which he has given us in this world. Wherefore, if for
to get acquaintance and familiarity, to accomplish our wicked will, and to
enjoy our carnal pleasure with whores and whoremongers, we give presents and
gifts, and prodigally do spend our goods in gorgeous and pompeous apparel, and
in superfluous and sumptuous bankets, in stead of reasonable expenses, for to
help our family, and to give to the necessity of our poor Christian
brethren, which are or should be of our household, yea, our members: if, I say,
for to get such deuilish acquaintance, we spend thus cursedly the riches that
are committed unto, and give our honor unto the stranger, and so much as in us
lies, give over our years unto such as have no pity nor compassion of us,
and care not, though we spoil ourselves, to cloth them, though we starve
ourselves, to feed them fat, so unmerciful are they and cruel. Luke. 15. 14*


The prodigal spend thrifts which are driven to beg, do prove the same with
the prodigal child. If their repentance were known, and that they truly
confessed their faults, as did the poor prodigal child, we ought to have
pity on them, and help their necessity, Genesis 2. 15.
etc. But that we must thus understand, this honor and these years, Solomon
shows it, saying,

10 Lest the stranger should be filled, etc. Forasmuch as from the beginning of
the world the Lord God took man and placed him in the garden of Eden, that
he might dress and keep it, and that in all ages, such as were of right
judgment have bestowed themselves to good works, because they would not live
Exo. 20. ^.
idly, and be unprofitable in this world, and that God says unto us, Six
days shall thou labor: and also according to the saying of Saint Paul, Let
him that stole, steal no more, etc. And again, Ephe. 4. 28. 2. These. 3. 8.
Neither took we bread of any man for naught. We will here take the strength
and the labor, for the goods that a man gets and gathers by his work,
for to sustain his life. The Genesis 4. 12. Job. 6. 22. and 31. 38. Eccle. 2. 10
verse 11. 12. Deuteronomy. 28. 33. Psalm. 78. 46. Psalm. 105. 44.
Scripture uses it in this signification. God said unto Cain, When thou shall
til the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. Was it
because I said, bring unto me? or give a reward to me of your substance? If my
land cry against me, etc. Thus much for strength. But labors is spoken of in
diverse places. My heart rejoiced in all my labor; and this was my portion of
all my travel. The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, etc. He gave
also their fruits unto the Caterpiller, and their labor unto the Grasshopper:
And gave them the lands of the heathen, and they took the labors of the
people in possession. And albeit that it come from the power and goodness of
God, that we become rich (for of him only have we our strength and ablenes,
our wisdom and will to employ us, it is he alone that makes the earth fruitful)
yet notwithstanding he is so good, that what he gives us, he esteems ours,
and does declare it unto us, to the end that we should know that he has
given us liberty to use them with praise and thanksgiving, with joy and
gladness. But if it be not lawful for us to use our own goods prodigally, so
much the less is it lawful to steal, or to borow, to spend prodigally, and
to live dissolutely, bravely, and in costly buildings and belly cheer.

11 And thou mourn at thine end. As in living chastely, and by sustaining
ourselves with the goods which God gives us to use soberly and temperately,
the body is maintained, and kept from feebleness and diseases, and is
strengthened and made strong to labor about good and honest things, for to
profit ourselves and our neighbors: even so contrarily, by whore hunting and
wasting the goods of God immoderately, we spoil our bodies, and make them
subject to diverse sicknesses, and become unprofitable, so that we can neither
profit ourselves nor our neighbors, but are constrained to perish miserably:
Whereupon finally, we mourn and make lamentation, when we see and feel
ourselves in so pitiful a case. But al in vain: for so little is our grief
assuaged by such mourning, that rather it is increased. Solomon did well
perceive the same by the wisdom he had received of God: and therefore he
forbids to have fellowship with whores, and to spend our goods prodigally:
and now he declares the means whereby the body is consumed, and loses his
strength: now seeing and perceiving themselves in such misery, they lament:
but it is to late, as he does well signify it, saying. That it is at the end,
and when we can no longer: for the body and the strength fails, and can not
be recovered nor restored. For this cause Solomon would have us to live with
such shamefastness and chastity, with such sobriety and temperancie, that we
should not be compelled to mourn.

Not so, but that lamentations are profitable, when they proceed out of a
contrite and lowly heart, truly repentant: For with such Esai. 66. 2. Psalm.
34. 18. and 51. 19. Luke 23. 42. Genesis 25. 32. and 27. 34. Heb. 12. 17.
mournings God is pleased, and does hear the^: also the mourning of the thief
was heard, and the bitter tears of Peter: but the mournings that are made only
for the pain we suffer, or that is judged to be at hand, and not for the evil
that has bin committed, does nothing profit them that so mourn. Cain, Pharao,
Saul and Judas have proved it: Esau also may serve as an example for the
prodigal. At the first sight such kind of lamentations, seem that they
should profit, and that God should receive them: but Solomon does condemn
them, as he shows, when he sets before us here, such as have a fair show,
saying,

12 And say, how have I hated instruction? etc. Although Dan. 9. 5. 1. Ioh. 1.
9.
Daniel confesses his sins, and the sins of his people, and that John
says, If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins: yet it might seem that Solomon need not to fear that the
whorekeepers and spend thrifts should make this mourning, lamenting their
wickednesses past. But if we diligently mark, we shall see that Solomon does
not reprove the mourning, but regards from whence the same proceeds, that
is to say, either from the pain they suffer, or else that they fear to suffer,
and not from the grief of having offended God, from the which the confession
of our sins ought only to come, and not from the pain we feel or that we
fear. True it is, that if we be afflicted, we should call to memory that we
have offended God, and confess that we have well deserved to be punished,
confessing our sins, and craving pardon for them, as did Daniel and the thief.
Also this complaint should be made by all true repentant sinners: for they Luke
23. 48.
ought to confess that they do not take the instructions and corrections in
so good part as they should: for we al of our own nature commend ourselves,
and think ourselves wise and righteous enough. They which repent not truly,
will oftentimes make most goodly confessions in show, and will stuff them with
many words which shall seem to proceed of a great sorowfulnesse of heart.
Solomon here does well express it, when he is not satisfied to attribute to
them the former confession, but for a more plain declaration thereof, adds
their saying,

13 And have not obeyed. In this addition we see how it comes that men hate
instruction, and regard not correction, that is to say, when they despise the
reading of the holy Scriptures, and are negligent to hear the preaching of
the Word. To the end then that we be not compelled to make this mourning, for
the pains that shall pinche us by whoredom and prodigality, let us obey
Moses and the Prophets, and above al, the chief Prophet and our only Master
Jesus Christ, and his Apostles and Ministers, which are ordained by him for to
be our Masters, and to teach us his will, and not for to make new
commandments, and ordinances at their pleasure and fantasies, as does that
tyrant of Rome, The miserable whoremongers and prodigal spenders will not
mourn for that they have disobeied these doctors and masters, for they are
dumb dogs which bark not: but though they say themselves to be the successors
of the Apostles, and esteem themselves the rulers and governors of
Christendom, and the pillars of the Church: yet through their dissolute life
they offend and destroy the people, causing great multitudes to fall by their
evil example. These woeful whoremongers and prodigal spend thrifts might rather
bewail themselves for having almost given themselves over unto al evil by
their example, then not having obeyed their voice: for in companying with them,
they see, hear, and learn nothing but al evil. Wherefore, we must fly both
them and their like, to the end that we be not provoked by their example to
wax corrupt in all evil, and that we should have no cause to mourn with these
stinking whoremongers, who al in vain do be wail themselves, saying,

14 I was almost brought, etc. Albeit, that more evil is learned, and that men
are more easily corrupted with wicked company, and by evil examples, then
otherwise: yet nevertheless the foolish and indiscreet, the contemners and
rebels, the mockers and dissolute cease not to be corrupted, and to be given
to al evil, though they are admonished by good Doctors and Masters, and do
live and be mingled with good people, in the congregation and assembly of the
faithful. Wherefore we may take this mourning as if the wicked did lament that
in what company so ever they came, good or bad, they grew corrupted and
altogether given unto evil. Notwithstanding, seeing the former lamentation, it
is more likely true, that they bewail themselves, for that they have not
ceased from running to al evil, when they were taught and admonished by good
Doctors and Masters in the company of the faithful, which were no ^mal numher:
as this repetition does show, In the midst of the congregation and assembly:
for it is as much as to say, as in the great assembly. In this their
lamentation, they show that they have sinned more grievously then if they had
companied only with the wicked, amongst whom they should have had no
instruction. This last exposition is the most meetest unto the line of the text
of Solomon. He sets before us these lamentations, to the end that we should
not commit wickedness, whereby we should be constrained thus to lament, for the
punishment that follows thereof: and not but that we should be displeased with
ourselves, for the evil that we have done. For they that do so lament, should
be very ready to do the like, if they had the power.

15 Drink the water of thy Cesterne, and of the Rivers out of the midst of
thine own well. 16 Let thy Fountain flow forth, and the Rivers of waters in
the streets. 17 But let them be thine, even thine only, and not the
strangers with thee.
15 For to teach us what we should do, that we might not give our honor unto
strangers, least we be compelled to lament for the consumption of our flesh
and of our strength, he exhorts Deuteronomy. 11. 11.
us to drink the waters of our Cesterne. And therein he respects the
description of the land of Judah, in the which were mountains and valleys, that
were moistened with the rain from heaven: and therefore they had made wels and
Cesterns to hold and keep water, very necessary for them. As when Abraham came
and dwelt in this Genesis 26. 15.
land, his servants dug and caued wels. Regarding this situation (as has
bin said) he ordeineth that we should drink water, whereby he means al fruits
which we gather of our labor and travel: the which he signifies, when he
says, not absolutely of Cesternes and of wells: but, of thy Cesternes and out
of thine own wells, that is to say, that thou have caued and dug, and
keep. Now when as Solomon, under this which is of least price and
estimation in the provision of a house (for there is nothing that is more spilt
then water, and also that lest serves for merchandise) comprehends all the
necessities of the house; he also shows that we must keep great sobriety
and temperance, and not desire to make excessive and superfluous cost, and that
we must not follow gluttony nor dronke^nes. And when he says, drink, and not
to call drink, he shows that we should be careful to nourish our household,
and not to spend our goods prodigally upon making good cheer with knaves and
whoores, with belly gods and insatiable throats. Besides this also we will
first of al note, that albeit we must be sober and temperate, and contented
most with simple drinks and meats, yet that it is lawful for us to use all
kind of meats. As when God promised the land of Chanaan unto the children of
Israel, he did not promise them that they should drink water only, 1. Tim. 4.
4. Exo. 3. 8. Leuit. 26. 4 Deuteronomy. 28. 1. Exo. 20. 15.
but he also promises abundance of all fruits of the land for to eat with
fullness, with joy, and in peace, and rest. Secondly, what license soever is
given us, to use all benefits, yet must we abstain from those that belong
unto our neighbor, as we have two express commandments for it: And Solomon
does signify the same here, saying, Of thy Cesternes, and of thine own wels.
Thirdly, forasmuch as the Cesternes and Wells do run to decay and fall
down, except they be mended and tended, and both cost and labor be bestowed
upon them: even so Solomon does advertise us to labor, and privily
forbids us begging, from the which comes much evil. Fourthly, although
that the wels and Cesternes be ours, and that Solomon bids us drink water,
yet ought we not to be so partial, nor so much given to our own profit, but
that we should have care of our neighbors, and endeavor to communicate part of
ours, for to relieve their need, we must not be such pinchers, to eat our
bread alone: but we must distribute the same into diverse parts, as Solomon
teaches us, saying,

16 Let thy fountain flow forth, etc. As he that has one or many
fountains, wants no water, though they run over and spread here and there
far of, even so the man which shall distribute the goods that God has given
him, shall have enough and not want. When we were Papists, we were wont well to
say, To give for Gods sake does not make a man poor. If in such darkness of
ignorance, of superstition and idolatry, of al wickedness and abomination, we
spoke and felt so rightly: what ought we to say and feel now, when God by his
grace has delivered us from these darknesses, and daily does lighten us by
his pure word, the which Deuteronomy. 15. 4. Esaias. 58. 7. Luke. 12. 33. and. 16. 9.
is brought unto us by these lights, not only by Solomon, but by Moses, and by
his Prophets by this great light Jesus Christ, and by his Apostles. And as the
man which will not suffer his waters to run over, but labors to hold and
lock them in perforce, does put himself in danger that the waters should rise
and swel so 2. Cor. 8. 7. and. 9. 5. 1. John. 3. 17 Iam. 2. 13.
much that they should destroy and drown his house, and he to perish therewith:
eue^ so the covetous rich man which fears that the earth should fail him, and
encloseth al to himself, thereby does perish: for judgment without mercy shall be
to him that shows no mercy. And as the waters stopped up, are unprofitable,
even so are riches hidden. It is not then without cause that Solomon says, Let
thy fountains etc. And since he compares the riches and wealth of this world,
unto the fountains of water, he teaches us that we may not set our hearts
upon them: neither that we must spare them toward them that have need, nor
fear to want them. But as the fountains are ours, though the waters run
over, so the propriety of that which we enjoy, is ours, albeit that we must
2. Cor. 9. 8. Gal. 6. 9.
deal the fruits that come thereof, liberally and largely, yea even to the
bottom, if necessity so require: but whiles the fruits are sufficient,
Solomon would that we should be lords and masters of the bottom, when he
says:

17 But let them be thine. Although Solomon is not satisfied to have said,
Thine, but repeateth again, Thine, adding thereunto an exclusive word, that
is to say, Only, for he says, Even thine only: yet let us not think that
he would exclude the poor members of Jesus Christ, which not only are our
brethren, but also bones of our bones, and flesh of our flesh, for we all are
Romans 12. 5.
one body in Jesus Christ, and every one of us one another members. And as
Jesus Christ with all that is his, is ours through grace, eue^ so amongst
Christians and the faithful, there ought to be such fellowship, that none should
say that any thing were his, but that he should be ready to bestow it to the
profit of his neigbours, as need shall require, as they of the primitive
Church have given us example thereof. And that according to the word, Sell
that which ye possess, etc. And Saint Paul would have us to buy, as though we
possessed not. He excludes none but strangers, as he himself Act. 4. 34 Luke.
12. 33 1. Cor. 17. 3^
declares, saying, And not the strangers with thee. Now by Strangers, as we
may gather by the words that Solomon uses, are meant knaves and whores, the
profane and infidels, with who^ we ought to have nothing to do, neither is it
needful that we should give them our strength and our labors, much less
the bottom and al, the which also does not so belong unto our faithful Act. ^
4 2. Cor. 8. 13.
neighbors with us, that we ought to sell the same for them, and defraude one
family thereof, except the necessity be great: Neither is it that other men
should be eased, and you grieved. Wherefore we may understand that the faithful
may possess lands of their own, and to keep themselves from begging:
against the Anabaptists, which say, that the Christians ought to take their
possessions, and make them common. Saint Paul does not 1. Tim. 6. 17.
command the rich to leave their goods: but that the should not put their
trust in them, and to bestow part of them to them which shall need.

18 Let thy fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 19
Let her be as the loving Hind, and pleasant Roe: Let her breasts satisfy
thee at all times.
That we give not our honor to the strangers, nor lament for the wasting of
our flesh, and our strength, it is not enough that we drink of our Cesternes,
and that they be our own: but also we must beget lawful children, as Solomon
does command us, when he says, Let thy fountain be blessed. And truly
this is a great blessing of God, when by lawful marriage we have a multitude of
children, as is showed us in the Scripture. But since that in Genesis 1. 12. and.
9. 1. and. 12. and. 22. 17. Psalm. 128
lawful marriage there is Gods blessing, it follows that in whoredom there is
nothing but cursednesse: wherefore we are greatly deceived, if we find savor
in the drops of the honny comb of strange women, if we delight to bast and
anoint ourselves with the oil of her palace. Solomon has well showed it us
in the 3. 4. 5. 6. verses of this Chapter. We must not then delight in
whoredom, but rather abhor it, seeing that therein is nothing but cursednesse
and evil success: but with marriage there goes a blessing: and therefore we
should rejoice in the same, as Solomon exhorts us, saying, Rejoice with the
wife of thy youth, etc. The rejoicing that Solomon means, is not, that the
married folks should together with all greediness follow the desires of
their flesh and their sensuality,, taking their pleasures and lusts, after
their inordinate concupiscenses: but the joy that the faithful married folks
ought to have, is, that they should confess that it is God that has knit
them together, for to be united in Genesis 2. 33. Mt. 19. 5.
such wise that the one should not desire to be separated from the other: but
that in this union man should know that it is not good for him to live alone:
and therefore should love his wife, whom God has given unto him to be with him,
and to help him: The wife also to know that she has bin taken out of the side
of Ephe. 5. 22.
man, and thereof made a woman, that she might be an helper to man: and therefore
should give herself wholly to obey her husband. That Heb. 13. 4. John. 2. 2,
Genesis 1. 27.
they should confess that they are in a very honorable state, as the Son of
God has well declared, and that it comes not from the invention of man's
brain, but from the most ancient institution of God. Also that God has made
the^ partakers of marriage, to the end that they should possess their vessels
in honor and sanctification, 1. These 4. 3.
and not in uncleanness and filthiness. Likewise if they have lineage, that they
should acknowledge that they are the organes and instruments whereby God does
increase his word: and by how much as they have a greater number of children,
let them rejoice so much the more, confessing that the blessing of God is the
more upon them, and that God does greatly honor them when they are made fathers
and mothers of a great stock. They that want his knowledge and understanding,
and which do not so rejoice, though they be married, and that they come not
near the gate of the whoremongers and harlots house, and that they have a
number of laweful children, nevertheless yet as touching them, their fountain
is not blessed, but nothing remains for them but a curse and mal^diction: for
unto the unclean and infidels nothing is clean. Therefore if we Tit. 1. 1^.
would have our fountain to be blessed, we must delight in the word of
God: the same shall fill us with joy, and shall keep us from vexing and
tormenting us in our housholdes: but as Solomon does exhort us, every one shall
rejoice with his wife, whom he calls wife of our youth: that is to say, Thy
wife that is young, and whom thou have taken for thy spouse in thy youth.
Solomon speaks thus, not but that it is lawefull for old folks to marry and
to rejoice with their yoke fellow, as Abraham with Ketura: but it is the most
common and most meetest for Genesis 25. ^*
men to mary in the flower of their age: for they love more tenderly, and have
more desire of great stock: and so the blessing of God is the more
plentifully powered upon them, whereof they have good cause to rejoice. Of these
things above said we gather what it is that does engender troubles in the
household, to wit, when we follow strange men and strange women, when we have
no sound understanding in the word, and when we join not with our equal.

19 Let her be as the loving hind. Now forasmuch as the wife is the weaker
vessel, therefore she should easily be made wild Gene. 3. 1. Pet. 3. 7.
if the husband did not show her a loving countenance, and delighted in her,
as we may understand by S. Paul, when he says, ye husbands, love your
wives, and be not bitter unto them. Col. 3. 13.
Solomon is not satisfied for to have said unto us, rejoice thee with the wife
of thy youth: but to teach us also to conserve and maintain holy marriage
duetifully, he would that we should show unto our wives such gentleness,
familiarity, favor and friendship, that we should not give them any
occasion to depart away from us, and to be afraid of our presence: as do
diverse wild heads, and raging beasts that handle their wives as mad and cruel
tyrants. For to teach us thus to tame our wives, and to make them to love our
company, and to take pleasure therein, Solomon uses a similitude, taken of
great Lords, which delight to tame wild beasts, to follow the^, and to take
meat at their hands: they play with them and sport with them, and do what
they ca^ to preserve them, and to keep them from hurt. Solomon would that as
noble men behave themselves toward wild beasts wherein they delight, even so the
husbands should not delight to tame whoores and drabbes, but that they
should love their wives so well, and be so well pleased with them, that al their
earthly pleasure should be to deal in all gentleness and softnes with them,
least they take occasion to wax wild and to follow knaves. He does declare
this same unto us, when he says. Let her be as thy loving hind, and
pleasant roe: as if he did say, If a man do play, if men do recreate
themselves, and pass the time with brute beasts which have no wit nor
reasonable understanding, the taming whereof is not needeful, and brings us
no profit, it is good reason that men which cannot be alone, but have need of
like fellowship, should confess the great and excellent gift that God does
grant them, when God has given them wives to help them, and to rejoice, and
that every one should delight and take his recreatio^ with his own wife, as did
the good Patriarchs. It is not to say that the wives which the husbands do
thus tenderly love, should live idly and do nothing, but take their
pleasures and delights. Solomon does somewhat signify the same, when he here
co^pareth the wife unto the Hind and to the Roe, which are nimble Ephesians. 5. 22.
1. Tim. 5. 14 I. Tim. 2. 9 1 Pet. 3. 4.
beasts to run. The wife then ought not to be slouthful, but ready to
execute the will and pleasure of her husband, and diligent to do the household
business, and to care for the family. Likewise when Solomon compares the
wife unto an Hind, that is a most loving and kind beast, he shows unto
women that they ought to be of a gentle and quiet spirit. Thus doing there
shall be no fault in them, that their husbands should not be satisfied with
their breasts at all times, as Solomon would have, that is to say, that their
husbands should never give themselves to love others, to join with them, and
to rejoice: but that they content themselves to love their wives, and that
their wives love the^, and not others. Solomon himself does so expound it,
when he says, Delight continually in her love. Herein, besides that the
married folks ought to learn to be chaste and shamefast, and to love one
another, and to love peaceably and quietly together, they ought to behold
therein a great gentleness and kindness of God, which has not only ordained
marriage for necessity: but also for joy and comfort of the parties joined
together in this holy estate, Genesis 24. 67. and 26. 8 Deuteronomy. 24. 5
so that it is lawful unto the married folks to receive themselves together
with temperance and modesty. It is a part of Gods blessing that he sends
unto them. Isaac used this benediction.

20 For why should thou delight, my son, in a strange woman, or embrace
the bosom of a stranger? 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the
Lord, and he pondereth all his paths.
There are many which are not content to rejoice with the yoke fellow that God
has given them: there are also that regard Heb. 13. 14.
not to take a lawefull yoke fellow in marriage, both these two kinds of
people despise the holy ordinance of God, and make but a mock at marriage,
which is honorable amongst all men: for they seek to have their sport and
pastime, to abuse wives and maids: that are indiscreet, or else to follow them
that are already so unshamefast that they care not though they give themselves
to whosoever will. Solomon calls them Strange women, or Foreners. For to show
that they belong not to those which they follow by contempt of marriage, and
that they ought to have acquaintance with them, nor desire any knowledge of
them: And for to show us that we must be very careful to follow the former
exhortations, he does declare unto us that he is moved with the desire of our
profit, as the father is toward the son. And by that that the greatest
part of the world does easily believe, that it is but a pastime and sport for to
communicate with strangers and foreners, Pro. I.. 2. 3. 8 9. 10.
and that in having acquaintance with the^, we go not astray: Solomon insisteth
mightily to maintain the contrary, as he has done here before. It
suffices him not simply to have affirmed that men go out of the way to follow
them, but to express with a more lively vehemency in what danger and sorrow
they run into, he asks, Why should thou delight? etc. As if he did say,
the way faring men which travel and walk, do much fear to wander out of
their way and path, although it be but for loss of worldly riches, or temporal
life: by a more strong reason the sons of God which must walk unto the
heavenly inheritance, unto eternal life, should be careful to look that they
stray not, and that they be not deprived of these great blessings, of this
happy life: the which they should do, if they followed strangers. Here above
he has said that they following this trade, do tend unto destruction.
Wherefore for to keep us from going astray, he forbids us to embrace the
bosom of a forener: by the which kind of speaking, he forbids al whordome,
and in speaking so modestly for to make us fly far from al filthiness and
unshamefastness, he shows us in Ephe. 5. 12.
what abomination whoremongers and adulterers are before God which follow with
algreedines their carnal desires and disordinate affections, when he forbeareth
to express the uncleanness that they commit. For as also S. Paul says, It is a
shame even to speak of the things which are done of them in secret: but yet
we may not cease to condemn them. Likewise when he forbids us to embrace
the bosom, he teaches us that al unshamefast touchings are to be condemned:
and therefore that we should not be deceived with the scorners that take their
pleasures in such vileness: let the wives and maidens which desire to keep
their honesty and honor, both before God and men, violently thrust from them
such gesters and Devils incarnate, whersoeuer they shall find the^. For, to be
the true children of God, it is not enough to be ashamed before men, and not to
care though God see our filthiness, as do many which will appear honest before
the world, but secretly they care not what they do, neither will they once call
to remembrance that God sees them, or if they do think thereof, they fear
men more the^ God, or else they are so much deceived, that they judge that where
me^ does not see the^, there god also beholds the^ not: or else that they are
so foolish, so corrupted and degenerate, that they believe not that there is a
God. They profess they know Tit. 1. 16.
God, but by their works they deny him. The children of GOD ought to be far
from such pernicious opinions, and ought to behave themselves as holily and
honestly in secret, as before men, knowing that God is a witness of all their
thoughts, wills, purposes, and counsels of their hearts: by a more strong
reason then they should not be so void of understanding, but that they should
know how God sees what they do, and what others might see. Solomon does well
teach us this same, when he says,

21 For the ways of man, etc. A man enterpriseth and does many things that are
secret and unknown to his neighbors, for he goes away and hides himself
from them: but whatsoever he in ^e^teth, and how closely soever it be done,
yet can he not fly from the presence of the Lord, he cannot so privily go to
work, but God must know his manners and living, his works and operations,
although Psalm. 139. 12
he does them in so deep darkness, that he sees not himself. The darkness
hides not from thee: but the night shines as Esaias. 29. 15.
the day: the darkness and light are both alike. We ought to acknowledge and
confess so: otherwise we are cursed. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide
their counsel from the Lord: for and. 1^.
their works are in darkness, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?
If we thus think, we well deserve cursing: for we which are but earth, do
rebel against our maker. Your turning of devises, shall it not be esteemed as
the potters clay? For shall the the work say of him that made it, he made
me not? or the thing formed, say of him that fashioned it, he had none
understanding. But as there are many which shall see their neighbors live
holily and very uprightly, and show foth good example unto al, and yet will they
never mark to consider their good life to follow it, and to amend their
faults: and contrarily, other some which shall see them do evil, and do both
against God, and their neighbors, will not once exhort or rebuke them: likewise
although they confess how God sees and knows all things, yet they judge
that God cares not what men do, whether it be good or evil: For in this
world (say they) we see not that he deals better to the good, then to the
wicked, neither that he punishes the evil livers more then the other. For to
take away this opinion, Solomon is not contented to say, that the ways of man,
are before the eyes of the Lord: but he adds, and he pondereth Psalm. 94. 7.
all his paths: and yet following their complaint, they say again, The Lord
does not see it, the God of Jacob does not understand it. Albeit that the
Lord does wincke at it, yet can he examine the factes and deeds of every one,
for to allow that which is good, and reject that which is wicked: as well as he
that tries and discerns by the waightes and balances whether the thing is
good or evil, heavy or light. He did not forth with punish Caine, and left
Abell to remain: but he abstained not to consider both the one and the other,
with their doings, for to give in due season to every of them, according to
their deeds. The same also is seen in the preservation of Noe, and in the
destruction of the world by the universal fludde, by the overthrowing of
Sodom and deliverance of Lot, etc. These same ought to teach us, that God
pondereth the paths of every man, and that as he has done to them, so also will
he do to others in due time, if not in this world, yet to the one in
eternal life, and to the other, in death everlasting: as the one are for
example of the one, and the second of the other.

22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden
with the cords of his own sin. 23 He shall die for fault of instruction, and
shall go astray through his great folly.
It is not without cause that Solomon has been so careful to exhort us, as
the father the children: let us not be so wicked as to go astray with the
strange woman: for although we think to be closely hid: by wandering out of
the right way, yet God cease not to see us, and consider our devises, and
wicked enterprises, for to punish us at such time as it shall please him. And
let us not think that by giving ourselves to evil, we can escape: For though
it were so that God did not take heed unto the wicked, yet nevertheless they
could not be exempted from punishment, seeing they draw their own cord, the
which they spinne and twist, and pull forth by perseuering to add iniquity
unto iniquity, without remorce of conscience, with greediness of desire: and
in the same they proceed so unadvisedly and amasedly, that they make ready the
halter for themselves, and therein are taken, so that they cannot unloose
themselves, but must be a pray for the Devil. This is that which Solomon would
have us to understand, when he says, the iniquities of the wicked. etc. Here
we see how Solomon is very careful thoroughly for to advertise us, when one
thing often said, does not content him, but uses repetition, for to help our
ignorance and weakness, and to wake up our negligence: and also to make the
wicked less excusable, for contemning the aduertisementes he gives them. And
when he compares their iniquities and sins unto cords, he shows them that
they are more miserable then the brute beasts. For the beasts do not knitte
the lines and nets wherein they are taken, neither also do they cast
themselves into the net, if they perceive it, but shun it: but the wicked do
wind their own halters, and also run into the same to be taken. He shows
also that they which nothing esteem the admonitions, corrections and threats
that is made unto them, and become angry and do defy those which exhort and
rebuke them, asthough they would keep them in bondage, when they would
as much as lies in them deliver them out of the snares: and they contrarily,
willing to deliver themselves by dissoluteness and falling away, do further
bind and yield themselves captives. For as they which obey and believe the
word, are unbound and delivered from sin, from the Devil from death, and
from hell: even so the rebels are slaves unto sin, prisoners to the Devil,
holden under with the bonds of death and hell: and so are chained with the
cords of their iniquities. He shows, I say, that such people are much
deceived, and are in an evil way, not only when they go out of the way with
the strange woman, but also in what evil soever they inue^t with obstinacy and
hardness of heart. He has made a pit, dug it: and is fallen into the pit
that he made. The wicked is snared in the work of his own Psalm. 7. 16. and.
9. 16.
hands. To be short, what evil soever the wicked do commit, the same is
their destruction and damnation: but they think not so, as they show it, when
by how much as they commit more evil, by so much the more do they think to
be out of danger, as Solomon does well signify it, when he uses these
words, shall be taken, and shall be holden: And in this they deceive themselves,
as here we see it: and S. Paul does well signify it unto us, when he says,
For when 1. Thessa. 5. 3.
they shall say peace, and safety, then shall come upon them sudden
destruction, as the travel upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.
Besides this, we must learn in this advertisement not to be given to have
care to feed the flesh in his lusts and pleasures. For seeing that the
affection of the flesh is enimitie against God, and cannot be made subject unto
the law of God, we cannot take the Romans 8. 7.
pleasures of our flesh, except we will run into al wickedness: and in so
doing we twiste our own ropes wherein we are taken and holden, whereupon
follows our destruction: and thus, the pleasures that the wicked take in
sinning, do turn them to great hurt: for they engender not only temporal,
but also everlasting death. Solomon does threaten them therewith, saying,

23 He shall dye for want of instruction* etc. When the promise of eternal life
is made unto those which receive instruction to govern themselves by wisdom
and good discretion, in holiness, righteousness, faithfulness and truth: It
follows well that they which neglect, do well deserve eternal death: and ought
also to understand that when the scripture blames them for the contempt of
instruction, and that it threateneth them with death, that then they cannot
look but for eternal death, except by true repentance they embrace
instruction, which before they had despised. For the Lord will not the death of
a sinner, but rather that he should convert and live Solomon then saying that
the wicked which is without instruction shall Eze. 18. 32.
die, speaks of everlasting death, the which the wicked do well deserve for
being without instruction, he is void of wisdom, and filled with
foolishnes, by the which being carried about, he neither can, nor will hold the
pathe of life, but turns another way out of the right way, following the
lusts of his flesh, which is dead, whereof follows well that he is worthy to
perish everlastingly. Here we are taught, that if we will eschew death and
obtain life, we must receive the instruction that God gives us by his word,
by assuring us of the goodness and love of God toward us in Jesus Christ, and
giving ourselves to the obedience of his laws. Herein stands the true
wisdom of the children of God, the which keeps the^ from going astray and
wandering out of the path of life. We also do learn that the greatest part of
the world must needs perish, seeing that it is without instruction: some, for
that they are deceived by superstition and idolatry, other some for that they
receive lesinges for truth. And which worst is, there are many to whom godly
instruction is offered, but because they are without religion, they contemn
the instruction, and do nothing but skorne it, and so much as they can, do
persecute it.

The sixth Chapter.
1 MY Son, if thou be surety for thy neighbor, and have stricken hands
with the stranger: 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth: thou art even
taken with the words of thine own mouth. 3 Do this now, my son, and deliver
thy self: seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor, go and humble
thy self, and solicit thy friends. 4 Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor
slumber to thine eye liddes. 5 Deliver thy self, as a Do from the hand of the
hunter, and as the bird from the hand of the fouler.
IT seems at the first sight, how Solomon goes about to diswade us from
answering or to become pledge or surety for our neighbors. For there is none of
us that would be entangled, or in subjection and bondage to another, but al
naturally desire to be free, and to use the power that God has given us at our
own will: but Solomon does tell us that we are captives, if so beit we become
pledges and sureties for our neighbor. But to the end that we should not do
this injury unto Solomon, to charge him that he would diswade us from doing
the works of charity, we must diligently mark upon what condition he
would not have us to give our hand to be pledge for the stranger, and also
to wit, why he would that we should not redeem our neighbors. For the
first part, we must not be ignorant, that every man, how strange or unknown
soever he be, is our neighbor. Now he Chapt. 5. 8. and ^. 10.
has exhorted us here above, that our way should be far unlike to the same of
the strange woman, etc. That we should not give, etc. And it may happen, that
if we be not discrete, we shall be surety for such as borrowe, that they may
maintain whores: and in this manner we should give our honor unto strangers,
etc. and our fountains should not be ours only, but the strangers with us.
And therefore we must understand that Solomon does advertise us by these words,
that we should not be hasty in pledging our neighbor, except we know him well,
and also know that it is needful, and that by so doing we shall not bring our
family into such extremity as it should be compelled to beg their bread,
and that we ourselves should not be troubled thereby. For although that it be
commanded us to love our neighbor as ourselves, and to assist him with ours:
Leui. 19. 18. 2. Cor. 8. 13.
yet it is not commanded us to ease others to bring ourselves in distress. As
touching the second point, Solomon would not have us to be surety for our
neighbor, because that they which are entangled and bound for an other,
oftentimes are led with some vain confidence, or pride and ostentation. They
put their trust in him whom they pledge, or else they will declare themselves,
that it may be known they have the ability, and a noble and liberal heart, and
that they are bold to venture the same. And also Solomon does not allow us one
to be pledge for another, because that most often the same comes not of love;
for some labor to maintein their credit, and to make their profit with the
rich and mighty, or else to set forth their parents, kindred, and familiars: but
in the end they find themselves more deceived and beguiled then were to be
wished. And herein we may say that he has an eye to that which is said in the
Psalms, It is better Psalm. 118. 8. and 146. 3. and. 27. 10.
to trust in the Lord, then to have confidence in man. Put not your trust in
Princes, nor in the son of any man, for there is no help in him. Again,
Though my father and mother should forsake me, yet the Lord will gather me up.
Jeremy also says, Cursed be the man, that trusts Iere. 17. 5.
in man, and makes flesh his arm, and withdraws his heart from the Lord etc.
Solomon would not keep us then from pledging our neighbor, when need is, and
as our power is able: but to the end that we should take good heed to become
surety indifferently for all men that shall require us, he shows us into what
danger we cast ourselves, saying, that we are snared, that we are taken by the
words of our mouth, that is to say, that we are so straightly bound and
charged, that if they for whom we are surety be not able to pay, that we
stand bound both before God and men to satisfy the parties to whom we have
given our hand, by answering for another. And so doing, we have taken no small
matter upon us, as Solomon does show by the counsel he gives us for it,
saying,

3 Now do this, etc. He does counsel us to get ourselves delivered from the
power of our neighbor, in this that we are become surety for another, and for
to bring it to pas, we should not dwell quietly at home, without care, but with
speed to go toward him, whose hand we have stricken in being pledge to him
for another: and humbly to prostrate ourselves before him, requiring him to
have patience, confessing ourselves detters unto him, and in the mean while
that we should not suffer him whom we have pledged to sleep as it is said:
but to press him and call upon him to pay his debt with all diligence. When
Solomon speaks after this sort, he shows well the danger, and yet does
express it further, when he would not in any wise have us to sleep, saying,

4 Give no sleep to thine eyes. And yet for to express the necessity more,
he shows that they which become sureties, do not only bring their goods in
danger, but their persons also: for he says,

5 Deliver thy self, etc. When he co^pareth man unto a Do and a byrd, he
shows that if he become surety or pledge for another, that it behooves him
to be diligent. And when he, to whom they stand bound, is likened unto an
hunter and fouler, he shows that the pledge stands not in safety of his
person, but either in satisfying of the debt, or saving himself from his
hands. And thus it is not without cause that Solomon labors to turn man
away from being surety. He endeavors to counsel him to provide for his
family, and that he bring not himself into such necessity, that both he and
his household come to distress, and to be constrained to come into bondage or
perish. He will not keep back any man, (according to his ability) from
doing good to his needy neighbor, seeing that he has praised and commended
works of charity, and here after will commend them, even toward our
enemies. We may then learn to be prudent and discrete in the government of
ourselves, of our family, and of our goods, and yet without fear that the
earth should fail us: as the niggardes and covetous, which will do pleasure
to none, for fear their goods should diminish: and make themselves believe
that the goods they possess, are so theirs, that they ought not to distribute
any thing out of their house. We may learn again not to be careful for to
morrow, when without distrusting the providence of God, and without doing wrong
to our neighbor, we be careful and diligent to keep ourselves from
extremities, and from begging, or to come in hard bondage and captivity. When
Solomon does advertise us of this care and diligence, for to show us, that we
must in no wise be slack, he fordiddeth us to give sleep, etc. Not that he
would not have us sleep, after we have watched and labored in the day,
seeing that the sleep is a part of this that we need in this present life.
Only by this manner of speech he does admonish us that we should not be
sluggish and negligent, there where need is of laboring, to deliver ourselves
out of trouble. Now if for the keeping of our goods and bodies we be
admonished to have such care, we ought well to understand by a more strong
reason, that our diligence ought to be great, when it touches the
preservation of our souls, and of those that are committed to our charge: as
are the magistrates, which ought to take order that in their country and
jurisdiction the offenses should be taken away, etc. the fathers and mothers
careful that their children should be well taught to live in the fear of God,
and to govern themselves in good and honest manners: those which bring and
offer children to be baptized, to be diligent to accomplish that which they
promise, chiefly when the children are fatherles, and want good guyding: but
above al it belongs unto the ministers of the word to be vigilant to
govern themselves so holily, that they offend no man, that they should be
careful to preach the sincere truth, to admonish, to reprove and correct, that
by their ministry they may win the souls of the people of God, so much as
in them lies, etc.

6 Go to the pismire, o sluggard: behold her ways, and be wise. 7 For she
having no guide, governor, nor ruler: 8 Prepares her meat in the summer, and
gathers her food in the harvest.
Because he has admonished him that does become surety and pledge for another,
to be dilligent to deliver himself from the danger whereinto he is brought:
knowing that there are many negligent and slouthful, which have no care to do
that which belongs to the good provision of the household and family, he has
taken occasion to direct himself generally to the slouthful, to counsel them
what they should do* he blames and rebukes them, and shows them the misery
that shall happen unto them, except they forsake sluggishnes, and apply
themselves to yield their duty, and be quick to do their office. Now this
is the custom to put those that are not well learned, (and whose profit and
furtherance we desire) unto some good master to be taught: their masters give
the^ warning to mark well what is said unto them, that afterward they may
govern themselves wisely in their housholdes, according as they shall have
learned of their masters. So Solomon desiring the profit of the slouthful,
sends him unto a Master, saying, Go to the Pismire, o sluggard. He exhorts
us to regard that which we have seen done of the ante or pismire, that he
learn to govern himself wisely in his affairs: for he says, and be wise.
The sluggards ought to gave great shame and bashfulnes, when Solomon sends
them unto a beast so little and so weak, and would have them to learn of her:
and herein he makes them as it were subject unto this little beast, the which
not only ought to be subject unto them, but also all the beasts of the world,
though they were never so wild and cruel, as the word of God does teach us.
But the Image of God has bin blotted out in us by sin: also we have not such
lordship and rule over the beasts as was given unto us at the beginning: for
there are that rise up against man as the great wild beasts: there are also
very small that do trouble man both in his body and goods. Though there were no
other thing but that the sluggards are made after the image of God, and that
the pismire is a little feeble beast, they ought to be ashamed that the wise
man sends them to consider his workmanship, to learn wisdom and well to
govern their houses and families: but forasmuch as this weak beast does his
business without constraint, and without guide of other, and makes provision
for that which is necessary for him, following this natural inclination and
this feeling that it has of God, and by the same of herself labors and
works with all diligence: and the sluggish, besides the natural sight that
they have received of God, whereby they ought to be governed of themselves to
work and to set themselves to labor, have their parents and neighbors, whose
example and counsel they should follow: they have master workmen and
laborers, of whom they may learn to do the necessary woorks of this life.
Besides this, there are the laws of the Magistrates for to compel their
subjects to labor. The pismire has no such government, (as is said) For she
having no guide, etc. This ought to give occasion unto the slouthful to be
greatly confounded and to yield with shame, and to be void of boldness to
appear before men: for though they have so many kinds of guides, yet they
follow none of the^. And albeit that this little beast and pismire has no manner
of guide, yet does she follow her natural inclination.

8 Prepares her meat, etc. But what shame soever the slouthful ought to have
(forasmuch as it is better to have shame then to have loss,) yet to make their
profit, they must follow the counsel of Solomon, that they suffer not their
goods to be lost, for want of laboring, and to come in danger of begging or to
die with hunger for want of gathering and locking up of their goods in season
and time convenient. Laboring is a thing ordained of God from the beginning,
Genesis 2. 15. and 8. 22.
and the times for the same appointed. They then that labor, and bestow their
trauail and pain, do fulfill the commandment of God, and those that reap
after they have sown, and do lock them up for to spend them, when and where
as need shall require, do wisely and please God, not despising his blessing.
Contrarily, the sluggardes are rebels and disobedient unto God, they do
foolishly, not acknowledging the blessing of God. They that work according to
the time, are worthy to eat their daily bread: but the slouthful deserve to
dye with hunger, and if they do eat, they live of stealth: for they eat the
bread of others. And therefore it is not without cause that Solomon does
reprove them, and labors to awake them up, saying,

9 How long will thou sleep, O sluggard? when will thou arise out of thy
sleep? 10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands
to sleep. 11 Therefore thy poverty comes on, as one that trauayleth by the
way, and thy necessity like an armed man.
When a man lies not long, but is quick to rise up, at a due and convenient
hour, after his reasonable sleep: then is he counted careful and diligent.
Contrarily, he which desires to lie and sleep out of measure, and willingly
stands not up, when it is time thertoo, is esteemed careless and sluggish: and
also the bed and too much sleep, make a man heavy and dull witted: and this is
the cause why Solomon notes expressly a sluggard, by his lying down and
excessive sleep. And this upon good cause, for the sluggish not only are
unprofitable unto their neighbors, as experience teaches: but also they bring
hurt unto themselves, by not taking heed and preventing of the miseries which
are at hand to catch them. Solomon does well declare it unto them, when in
mocking at their manner of dealings and opinions, he says,

10 Yet a little sleep, etc. Forasmuch as it is lawful to take our rest and
sleep, for better to be disposed afterward to follow our calling. Solomon
speaks not to them that sleep a little, and as need requires: but to them
which sleep too much, and yet he speaks but of a little sleep, and of a
little slumber: and in this manner he expresses the saying and opinion of the
slouthful: for albeit they are too much given to sleep, and that they fold
their hands longer then were needful, yet asthough they had great desire to
watch and to labor, they will say, let me sleep yet a little, let me lie yet
a little while, and so make themselves believe they sleep not long. But thus
doing, they deceive themselves, and take their hurt, As Solomon tells them,

11 Therefore thy poverty comes on etc. No man knows what time the man will
come to his inn that is on the way: even so is poverty which happens to the
slouthful. If we shall meet a thief on the way which is well armed, which shall
not very easily put him back, but rather he will resist, and also will with such
violence and fiercenes assault us, that we shall not escape without leesing our
purse, or without being wounded to death: In this sort the slouthful are
assaulted with poverty. Behold how Solomon exhorts the sluggards, how he
does rebuke them, and advertise them of the evil that they deserve. But upon
the admonition whereby he would have them to be like unto the pismire that
gathers etc. It seems at the first sight that he is contrary unto Jesus
Christ, who says unto us, Be not careful for your life, what ye shall eat,
or what ye shall drink: nor yet for your bodies, what Mat. 66. 2^.
ye shall put on, etc. Behold the souls of the air, etc. I answer, That
Solomon labors not by his doctrine to make us careful. for albeeit the
pismire does labor, yet is he not careful: but he would that we should
occupy our persons about that whereunto they are ordained of God, and that we
suffer not the goods to be lost that he has given us. Also our Lord Jesus
Christ does not forbid us to be careful, diligent, and laborious, for he does
not teach us that we should waste the goods that he has given us, and that
we should neglect to gather them and lock them up: but he labors to take
from us niggardlines and distrust of Gods providence, whereunto we must wholly
refer the goods that God has sent us by laboring and fast keeping. For if
God do not bless our labor, it cannot prosper. And if we must not be Psa.
127. 1.
slouthful to labor, to reap and locking up of our goods for to maintain
this life: by a more strong reason we must be careful to labor for our
souls, and to gather the spiritual harvest. Likewise when Solomon says, he
has no fellow, etc. He admonishes al Magistrates not to suffer their
subjects to be negligent, and to eat their bread with idleness, albeeit
they have riches, and that after the judgment of the flesh, they have no need
to labor. Furthermore if the sluggards be reproved and blamed, because that by
their trade of living they are in danger to fall into poverty: by a stronger
reason we may blame the pilferers and stealers and covetous, and usurers and
bribetakers, and they which will not declare the right case for fear of
displeasure. For no thank to them though the poor perish not: but they
themselves shall fall into such poverty that they shall not have a drop of
water.

12 The unthrifty man and the wicked man walks with a froward mouth. 13 He
makes a sign with his eyes, he signifies with his feet: he instructs
with his fingers: 14 Lewd things are in his heart he imagines evil at all
times, and raises up contentions. 15 Therefore shall his destruction come
speedily: he shall be destroyed suddenly without recovery.
For to make us have the slouthful and slothfulness in horror and detestation
which he has blamed and threatened with poverty and sudden want, he shows
us the wickedness whereunto the negligent are given, to the end that we should
know that not only they hurt themselves, but also hurt their neighbors: for
often the man which spends not the time to do any good work, is a song
creux a diuiser of malice, and does change and disguise himself into diverse
manners, in devising evil against his neigbours. Albeit nevertheless because
of the great number of the slouthful, which are froward, it might be said that
Solomon takes occasion to describe the wickedness of the froward and their
sudden destruction in these 12. 13. 14. and 15. verses: Yet the matter that he
speaks of here, may be applied unto the slouthful, at the lest to the most
part. For when the spirit of man cannot be idle, but will be occupied about
something, seeing that the slouthful do nothing that is any thing worth, and
brings no profit unto their neighbors, it must needs follow that they give
themselves unto evil and to do hurt. We may then say that whom he calls
slouthful, he calls now an unthrifty and wicked man: the which
appellations and names agree right well with the slouthful: for since he does
nothing that is any thing worth, it must needs follow he is wicked. For
either make the tree good, and his fruit good: or else make the tree evil, and
his fruit evil. etc. Thus it is ill spoken, when we say Math. 12. 33.
of an unprofitable man, that he is worth a good morrow, when we see not
openly that he hurts: seeing that it is necessary that a man must profit if
he be good. Likewise the two words which Solomon uses here in his Hebrew
tongue is very meet for the slouthful. For Beliiaall, is a word compounded,
which signifies as much as without profit or unprofitable: and the other
word that is, Auen, signifies sometimes vanity, lying and a thing of
nothing. These titles here, as we know, are very meet for the slouthful.
For can a man find any thing more unprofitable, more vain, and less worth
then sluggardes? But whether soever we apply these words, either to the
slouthflul, or generally unto al froward and wicked, Solomon does well show it
that they are very dangerous, when he declares unto us their malice, their
corrupt manners, their wicked and ungodly kind of life. He begins with the
mouth, and does attribute feere unto the same, not that they go right, neither
whereas they ought, neither that they have to do well and to help their
neighbors, but feere that go clean contrary to that which they should: for
he says, that the wicked and froward does walk with a froward mouth, the
which he has forbidden to the children of God. Thus the slouthful and other
wicked do not keep the path of well speaking unto the honor and praise of
God: but as they are unprofitable and vain, so do they give their mouths to
take the name of God in vain. For being idle, they labor to take some
recreations according unto their desire, the which are full of vanity.
Wherefore, out of the abundance of their vain hearts, they speak vanity in all dissoluteness and abomination, in mingling the name of GOD in their
iestes, in blaspheming him, in singing dishonest songs, and speaking wantonly.
Also they hold not the way of well speaking of their neighbors: but as they
are froward and wicked, even so by their words they labor not but
maliciously, and wickedly to hurt, and to hinder their neighbors by
slandering, by bearing false witness against them, and in swearing to their
loss. This is more proved then is needeful, that the idle and slouthful do
govern themselves thus simply, even in all estates. etc.

13 He makes a sign, etc. Because that the froward and wicked man would not
be known nor counted such, it is needful for him that he often hold his
peace: for seeing that he is evil, he cannot continue speaking well: and so his
malice should be too much seen against his will: and for this cause somewhat
to hyde himself, he disguiseth and uses dissimulation and fainednesse, he
conterfaiteth and turns himself now on this sort, and then of another.
Solomon does signify the same by the sign of the eyes, by the speaking of the
feet, and by the token of the fingers. The froward and the wicked do thus
counterfaite themselves in diverse sorts, biting in their words: for albeeit
they have no desire, but to speak wickedly, yet do they spare to speak,
because they would not be known, and yet notwithstanding cannot keep in,
but that they give some signification of their malice unto their fellows, or
else dissemble somewhat to deceive those which they will draw unto their
wickedness. If they would in no wise be known, Solomon would not express
their fictions and coulorings by sign, word, and token. For they which do
sign, speak, and show, do not seek to be understood: but the wicked gives
the watch word (as it is said) they have their tokens and manners of dooinges
whereby one of them may be known to another, and what is to be done, that
they may catch and beguile them which are none of their company, or win
others to consent unto them.

14 Lewd things are in his heart, etc. We must not marvel though the
froward and wicked have such manners and customs: for there cannot come any
other thing out of the sack, then that which is within: The froward, as
Solomon says, are stuffed at the heart, not with one malice alone, but with
diverse: for lewd things are in their hearts: and albeeit that no man seeks
to do them hurt, yet is their heart so poisoned and embrued with lewd
things, that they can never cease from thinking and seeking means how they
may execute their displeasure, for to hurt them which do them no wrong.
Solomon does well express it, when he says that he ymagineth evil at all
times. Now the evil that they ymagine, is to set al in troubles and confusion
by dissension that they stir up through the frowardness of their mouths, by
their dissimulations, and by the lew denesse of their hearts. Solomon does
signify the same, saying, That they raise up contentions. But as they devise
the destruction of their neighbors, even so, also sooner then they think of,
they shall be destroyed without remedy, as he says,

15 Therefore shall his, etc. How the wicked after alitle time of prosperity,
at the last fall into destruction, is in other places very Psa. 7. and. 37. Pro.
1. 26.
well described.

16 These six things does the Lord hate: yea his soul abhors seven: 17
The hautie eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood, 18 An
heart that ymagineth wicked enterprises, feet that be swift in running to
mischief, 19 A false witness that speaks lies, and him that rayseth up
contentions amongst brethren.
It is a thing that we ought not to doubt of, that the thing which pleases
not God, cannot long endure. Wherefore we must not wonder though the destruction
of the froward and wicked shall suddenly fall without any help. He pleases not
God; therefore he does abominable things. Solomon has something touched it
before: he said that he should be destroyed, that he should be suddenly
strocken: but for to show that it cannot otherwise be done, he declares
unto us more amply what are the manners and customs of the froward and
wicked, and does affirm unto us that they are much displeasing unto God. And
for to begin this declaration, he says, There are six things that God
abhors: and as if he had not expressed a number sufficient, he corrects
himself, saying that there are seven: and as if the hatred were not enough for
to show that the froward and wicked deserves well to be destroyed, and that
his living is not acceptable unto God, he adds, that God abhors them. And
forasmuch as in God we live Acts. 17. 28.
and have our being, it is necessary that what he hates and abhors must
come to decay, verse, 12. Now as here before he has noted the froward and
the wicked by his mouth, eyes, feet, and hands or fingers, and by his heart,
and by the contentions: even so now for to show that it is necessary he
perish, he declares that God hates and detesteth these things, not that God
is led with troubled affections, as men which are often led as their
affections do carry them. GOD never changes, but in all things he woorketh
according as he has determined from everlasting and before the foundation of
the world was laid. He proceeds not then by hatred and anger to destroy
the wicked but because that they which he destroieth and overthrows according
as they have deserved, do feel him as if he hated them, the Scripture does
attribute hatred unto him, as the transgressor will deem of the judge that
sends him unto the gallows. Also albeeit that God has not a soul distinct
from the rest of his substance and essence (for there is nothing in him that
can be parted nor divided, as the man which is compounded of a soul and a
body, the which may be separated by temporal death) yet the scripture does
attribure a soul unto him, where with he loves the righteous, and hates and
detesteth the wicked, that the good may learn that the promises of life are
not made unto them faynedly and coulorably: and the wicked should know that
it is no play nor pastime, when they are threatened with death and damnation.
etc.

17 The hautie eyes, etc. The first thing of the seven that the Lord hates and
abhors are the hautie eyes, the which are proud, the which not only praise
themselves, so much til they disdain and contemn others: but also do so
assure themselves in their wickedness, that they have no fear of God, nor
reverence to his word. The Zodomites were thus high minded. The Lord has well
showed that he Gene. 13. 13. and. 18 20. Eze. 16. 49. Gene. 19. 24. Esaias. 2.
11. and 3 15. and. 5. 21. Luke 16. 15. 24
abhorred their pride, when he overthrew the^. He declares the same in Esaias.
Also our Lord declares the same in Luke: for that which is highly esteemed
among men, is abomination in the sight of God. The rich glutton likewise
which was clothed in purple and silk, etc. does show us right well that the
proud are much hated with God, and are of him abhorred, when he was thrown
headlong into hell into such extremity that he could not obtain a drop of
water, etc. God did well show unto Nabuchadnezar that he detested pride, etc.

But now albeeit that GOD does not daily show unto us such examples of his
hatred against the high minded and proud persons, it is not therefore to say,
that GOD does not always hate and abhor them, and that they should feel
the same at the time appointed, as the examples and threatninges are contained
in the scripture. He condemned Dan. 4. 28. ^. Pet. 2. 6. and 9. and 3. 9.
the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrha to utter overthrow. The Lord knows how
to deliver the faithful out of temptation. The Lord is not slack concerning
his promise: and though the Lord does punish the proud immediately* let us
not wax obstinate in our sins by contemning of his threateninges. Let us not
be like unto these scorners now, now, I say, that we are come to the last
times, which say, Where is the promise of his coming? 2. Pet. 3. 4.
For since the fathers died, al things continue alike from the beginning. Those
which speak and think so, shall at the last feel that they strove against
god, that they have opened their mouths against the holy one of Israel, and
have blasphemed. And seeing that God does declare us these things by his
word, if in steed of fearing that we be in his displeasure, we would be
assured of his love, and favor toward us: if in steed of fearing that he
abhors us, we would be ascertained that we please him, and are
acceptable unto him, let us humbly cast down our eyes in fearing to offend
him, in trembling at his word, and not seeking after high things, etc. Thus
doing we may protest with David, Lord, my heart is not hautie, neither are
mine eyes lofty, neither have I walked Psalm. 131. 1. Rom 12. 16.
in great matters, and hid from me. And so far of shall our destruction be,
and that we should be stricken down, that we shall rather be exalted, and
preserved safe and sound: for whosoever humbles himself, shall be exalted: For
the Lord is nigh unto the^ that are contrite and desolate, etc: Not that we
deserve it, but it is his good pleasure to give us this grace, Submit
yourselues one un 1 Pet. 5. 5.
to another: Deck yourselues inwardly with lowliness of mind: for God
resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble. Secondly, he hates and
abhors a Lying tongue, a false and unfaithful tongue, a tongue that
speaks deceitfully and craftily, and not without cause: for since that he is
faithful and true, even truth it self, we ought to understand that he cannot
abide lying, but will punish it, most severely and sharply, in the time that
he shall think convenient. The Lord shall destroy them that speak lies. When
GOD Psalm. 5. 6.
is so much moved and offended with falsenesse and lying, that he threatens
the deceiptful and liers with so sharp a punishment, they which have the charge
to lead the people unto salvation, and to keep the same from perishing, so
much as lies in them, ought to be grievously tormented in their minds,
seeing that falsenesse and unfaithfulness, deceit and lying, are so commonly
used in the world, not only amongst them which want the word of God. Psalm.
12. 1.
but also amongst them which dare well brag that they are reformed
according to the Gospel. For them chiefly should the Ministers be most
grieved according too the example of Jeremy. Iere. 9. 2.
Besides this cause, we may mark others, whereof the least being considered
shall suffice, for to judge and discern that GOD has good cause to hate a
false tongue and to abhor it. The tongue is one of the highest members of the
body, and not of it self, for the Lord has placed every member in the body,
as it has pleased him. 1. Cor. 12. 18
The tongue then as the rest of the members ought too be applied for a weapon
of righteousness unto God: and if it be false and lying, it is a weapon of
iniquity unto sin: and so it is a rebel against his maker. Wherefore he
rightly hates it and abhors it. But to make our tongues to be weapons of
righteousness unto Psalm. 34. 1. and. 35. 28. and. 5. 4
God, we must apply them to that which the Psalmist promises, I will always
give thanks unto the Lord: his praise shall be in my mouth continually: And my
tongue shall utter thy righteousness and thy praise every day. Contrarily, if we
apply them unto deceit and lying, then are they weapons of iniquity, the which
pleases not God, for thou art not a God which love wickedness: neither shall
evil dwell with thee. And this is upon good right, for such people are not only
rebels against men, but against God also: for in them there is no
righteousness. If then we will use our tongues Psalm. 50. 14.
well, we must give them to praise God: as we are taught, Offer unto God
praise, etc. And for to do this well, we must abstain from offending our
neighbors either indeed or in words: For God has said unto the wicked,
What have thou to do to declare mine ordinances, that thou should take my
covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hate to be reformed? Now as touching
ourselves, and the corruption of our nature, we are all such, we must therefore
pray that God would have mercy up on us, and open our lips, and therewith
let us follow the exhortation of S. Paul, Wherefore cast away lying, and
speak every man truth unto his neigbour. Hereby Psalm. 51. 17. Ephe. 4. 24.
we may understand, that if we have a false tongue, first of all, we are
unthankful unto God, not confessing that he has given us a well spoken
tongue, and not a dumb, as unto beasts. Secondly, that we are more
unreasonable then the beasts, when we use our tongues against the ordinance of
GOD, the which beasts will not do: and so we are rebels and unfaithful unto
GOD. Thirdly, that we are traitors unto our brethren. These three reasons well
considered, we must not marvel though God abhor a false tongue. For he
has well showed it unto his people of Israel. In Joshua, we may see that
Balaam was slain for having sold his Number. 11. 1. and. 14. 27. and 16 32.
Joshua. 13. 22 1. Kin. 18. 40 Psalm. 109. 2. Mat. 27. 5 Act. 5. 5
tongue to curse the people of God: The Prophets of Baal were slain, Judas
Iscarioth (of whom it was spoken. The mouth of the wicked, and the mouth full
of deceit are opened upon me) has tried that God hates a false tongue, when
he hanged himself. Likewise have Ananias and Sapphira. And forasmuch as there
is no exception of persons before God, all false tongues must look for
destruction and damnation.

Now in the third place, the Lord hates and abhors, the hands that shead
innocent blood: that is to say, them which do wrong and extortion unto their
neighbors, either in their persons or goods, causeless, and that their
neighbors have not offended them, nor done any wrong: such kind of people are
murderers and mensleaers, thieves and robbers, stealers, and rauishers, the
covetous and usurers, grasiers, and engrossers of corn and vittaile, to make
the same dear, and they which by unlawful means do draw unto themselves the
substance of their neighbors: in such wise, that there is no thanks due to
them, though their neighbors do not miserably perish. The Lord God has
well showed the same to Caine, to Pharao, to Saul which persecuted Genesis 4. 9.
Exo. 12. 12. 29. and. 14. 24. 1. Sam. 22. 17. and 31. 4. 2. Sam. 11. 4. 15. and
12. 10. 1. King. 21. 19. Gene. 9. 7. Esaias. 1. 15. and 3. 13. 14. and. 59. 3.
Mat. 3. 2. 3. 10. and 7. 2.
David, and caused the priests to be slain, when he slew himself: unto
David also which had ravished the wife of his faithful servant, and committed
execrable murder. For the which it was said unto him, now therefore the
sword shall never depart from thine house. Unto Achab: But it is not without
cause that God does abhor the murderers: for this sentence was pronounced
thereof long ago, Who so sheadeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.
As touching rauishings, by what means and in what sort soever they be done,
the Lord shows well that he does abhor the^, when he counts the^
murderers and manquellers. And to the end that we deceive not ourselves, in
conde^ning such people, and justify ourselves for that we be no poulers, and
yet, for all that we care nothing for the poor: let us know that such as have
the riches of this world, and do not distribute them unto the poor needy,
are counted in the number of murderers. 1. Ioh. 3. 19


18 An heart that imagines wicked enterprises. This same is the fourth thing
that God hates and abhors. Now forasmuch as it is not without cause that
the Lord hates and detesteth these three things aforesaid, it is no marvel
though he have this fourth in abomination also: for out of this spring does al
evil proceed. We may partly know the same, by that that Adam was rebuked,
first for obeing his wife, and for eating of the fruit, Genesis 3. 17. and. ^. 5.
forbidden. But it is more plainly showed, where as GOD complains of the
imagination of man's heart: and when Jesus Christ says, Out of the heart come
evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies
and slanders: and Saint Paul says, This I say therefore, and testify in
the Lord, Mat. 15. 19. Ephe. 4. 17.
that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in vanities of their
minds, etc. Many men will hate and abhor the foresaid three things, because
they see and know that they are hurtful unto them: but few will hate and
abhor the heart: for they see no further then the face, and cannot pearce
unto the heart, nor judge no further thereof then they see the fruits, which
are the words and works: But God who created al things, knows his 1. Sam.
16. 7. Psalm. 7. 10. Ier. 17. 10.
creatures as well within, as without, he pearceth even unto the bottom of the
hearts, wherein there is nothing contained but he sees it. And seeing he is
the God, who is pleased with equitic and uprightness, goodness and true
dealing, now if the heart of man is given to any thing contrarily, and that
he will not be converted, and apply the same unto goodness, it is impossible
but GOD must hate him, and abhor him: whereof follows the destruction of
man. I say expressly, which is given, etc. Because that albeeit every man has
an evil heart, yet is he not hated of GOD; neither of him abhorred, when he is
displeased with his wickedness. Psa. 51. 19. Esaias. 66. 2.


We may here judge that there are many people which think very much of
themselves, but their estimation does profit the^ but a little: for they are
hated of God: and contrarily that many are despised, to whom their contempt
brings no hurt, because they are beloved of GOD and do please him. In the
fifth place, The feet, that be swift in running to mischief: That is to say,
the raging and boiling affections which carry away a man in such wise that he
cares not what he does, so that he may bring to pass for to hurt his
neighbors, and to work the mischief that he desires. And herein he
compares such affections unto a furious mad man, that has nothing in him
but have to execute his anger. He will forget all other necessary and
profitable affairs for to follow his wicked enterprise, and will be content
to suffer great loss, and to take great hurt on every side,, that he may
execute his foolish fantasy: Likewise the froward and wicked have none other
thing in their mind, but only their displeasures, their wicked enterprises,
but no mind, on the fear of God, no desire to reverence his word, no feeling
of the heavenly kingdom, nor hope of everlasting life. In this sort they have
a greatlosse, for to pursue a thing of nothing, and hurtful. Now although that
all men, how righteous soever they be, have evil motions tending to evil, as
may be gathered when our Lord Jesus Christ, says, He that is washed, needs
not, save to wash John. 13. 1^
his feet: we ought not to understand that Solomon would enclose the
affections of them that are washed under the hatred and abhorring of the Lord.
For albeit the carnal affections tend to evil yet do they not suffer them to
post and to run unto mischief, Romans 7. 14* 2. Cor. 10. 3 Romans 13. 14.
but do draw back, and retire themselves so much as is possible: and albeit
that they are carnal, and sold under sin, yet they do not allow that which
they do, and walking in the flesh, they fight not fleshly, for they have not
their pleasures in these lusts. If then we would take heed that our affections
should not make post have, and run swiftly, If we would avoid the hatred of our
Lord and God, we must bridle them, and keep that sin do not reign in our
mortal bodies.

19 A false witness that speaks lies, etc. In the sixth place he sets the
false witness bearer: and this is not without cause, for it has an express
commandment against it, Thou shall not bear false witness against thy
neighbor, and so the false witness Exo. 20. 1
knows not that there is a God which is his Master and Lord, whom he
ought to obey, where he labors to despite him. For man having any knowledge
of God, (if he make himself a false witness) he knows that he provoke
the wrath of God against himself, and seeing that God is the truth, it cannot
be but he must needs have a false witness in horrible execration. But that
we may know who it is that is a false witness, and that we may labor to
avoid the displeasure of God, and not to be abhorred of him, Solomon tells
us that he is one, that speaks lies. He says not that it is the periurer,
albeit that al periurers are liars, and do speak lies: but to yoke in all
liars, he says simply, he that speaks lies. Wherefore when we are asked
an answer of truth, we are false witnesses, if we shall speak otherwise then
the matter stands, though we be not asked upon our oath. Even so those which
lie in judgment, or otherwise, are hated of God, and are of him abhorred, for
the which they ought to look shortly to be destroyed. By a more strong reason
then, they which do periure themselves, ought well to be esteemed false
witnesses, and when by their false oath they call God unto witness of their
lies, they would spoil him of his truth, and consequently, that he should be
no GOD: for seeing he is the truth, he cannot stand without it, they well
deserve of God to be hated, and to be of him detested, and because there is no
thanks due to them why the world does not suddenly perish, seeing they seek to
overthrow God, without whom nothing can remain, they deserve well, speedily to
be beaten down: the which shall be done without remedy sooner then they think
for. In the seventh place he sets the seditious, which raise up contentions
amongst neighbors, which the Scripture calls brethren: not only by this that
we are all children of Adam and Eve, but that we ought all to have one
heavenly father, and also to show, that as it is a good thing to be wished
for, that brethren should dwell al together, so also that is an evil thing,
that neighbors which ought to Psalm. 133. 1.
be united together as brethren, should be divided, and that the common peace
should be broken, whereby friendship is maintained, and help is ministered one
to another. They which are the cause of the breach of this unity, are hated of
the Lord, and are not without cause abhorred of him. For first of all, it is no
thanks to the^ that God is not spoiled of his delight, which he takes in the
unity and concord of brethren: The which pleasure ought not to be esteemed
of small importance, when the law of GOD stretches wholly to maintain the
unity of religion, the which is commanded unto us by the first table, and in
conjunction of mutual love, the which is commanded unto us by the second
Table, the which love cannot be maintained without unity in religion. And
therefore the Prophets were very careful to cry against the superstitions
and idolatries, and against the false Prophets and the Priests of Baal. Also
our Lord Jesus Christ exhorteteth men to take heed of false Prophets,
aduertising that many should come in his name, saying, Mat. 7. 15. and 24. 5.
I am the Christ, and should deceive many: And Saint Paul in diverse places. And
forasmuch as there is none that desires that GOD should hate his manners and
dealinges, and to abhor them, but would, if we have never so little spark
of good wit, that he should allow them, and that he should accept of them:
it is necessary therefore that we delight to give ourselves to do contrarily
to that which God hates and abhors, and that in steed of hawtie eyes, we
become humble and lowly in heart after the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Secondly, no thank to them that he is not deprived of his paternitie, no
thank to them that the children do not deny their father, and to take the
Devil for their father. For as God is the God of peace, so are also the
peacemakers and peace followers his sons, and contrarily the seditious,
tumult Mat. 5. 9.
raisers, and brawlers are the sons of the Devil. Thus they which make
debates, labor to increase the kingdom of the Devil. And if God do abhor
those which so offend against the second Table of Moses, by a more forcible
reason does he detest the^ which transgress the first through obstinacy and
wilfulness.

20 My son, keep thy fathers commandment, and forsake not thy mothers
instruction. 21 Bind them always upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
neck.
Because the fathers and mothers, which truly and tenderly love their children
will not command nor teach them any thing but that which is pleasing and
acceptable unto GOD, that the young folks may learn to fly from the former
things which God hates and abhoreth, Solomon would that children should obey
their fathers and mothers, and that according to the law.

21 Bind them always upon thine heart, etc. When he makes this exhortation,
he shows well that he spoke not but of fathers Exo. 20. 21. Deu^. 5. 16.
and mothers which do labor to govern their children in that which is
acceptable and pleasing unto God, in that which is according unto his
commandments. For there is nothing whereunto we ought to be so fast linked, as
unto the commandments of God, there is no yoke whereunto we ought to submit
ourselves, but unto the law of God the Lord. Moses also willing to induce the
children of Israel unto a continual obedience of the word of the Lord says,
And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in Deuteronomy. 6. 6. and. 11.
18.
thine heart, lay up then these words in your heart. Now since that this present
admonition serves for the whole word of god, it might be said, that when
Solomon said, My son, keep the commandment of thy father, etc. that he
speaks of God, and of the ministry of his Church, in the which there is
nothing taught us but the pure word of God, and whose children we are, if we
submit ourselves unto his word, suffering to be begetten thereby into pure
faith, and true repentance.

22 It shall lead thee, when thou walk: it shall watch for thee, when thou
sleep: and when thou wakest, it shall talk with thee.
Albeit that this promise agrees very well with this same here, That thy days
may be long upon the earth, etc: yet the same hinders not but that it should
regard to assure the goodness of God, unto those which willingly and gladly do
give themselves unto the obedience of the word generally: for also to them is
long life promised, Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments, which I
command Deuteronomy. 11. 8.
you this day, that ye may be strong and go in, and possess the land
whither ye go to possess it: Also that it may prolong your days in the
land, etc. Now that these words of Solomon do agree with this promise, it
is manifest: for we think not to have life, if we be deprived of these
present commodities: it seems not unto us that we live, except our business
do prosper well: it seems unto us that we are in death, except we be at
liberty, and may have company with whom we may talk familiarly. When
Solomon then does promise that the commandment of the Father, and the
instruction of the mother shall keep us from going astray, and shall make us to
sleep in safety, and that in the day it shall talk with us: he does show us
that they which obey the Word, have a blessed life, and consequently, long
enough: for the length of days stands not in the multitude of years, but in
that we live godly, and that we content ourselves with the number of years
which it shall please the Lord to give, confessing, that he makes his to live
in this world so long as it pleases him, and is expedient for their spiritual
health. Notwithstanding, there shall be no inconvenience, if for that, which we
call promise here, we take to be admonition: as if Solomon did exhort us to
cleue so fast unto the Commandments, that we should never stray from them, but
that in all times and in all places we should govern ourselves by them, in
doing that which they command, being assured that by them we shall be perserued
from al dangers: then should they be so well graven in our hearts, and we
should so greatly delight in them, that we would not desire any profane or
vain communication, but if we speak, to speak as the words of God. To be
short, let it be whether we take this for a promise, or that we take it for an
admonition, Solomon does show us that we must take 1. Pet. 4. 11.
good heed from turning any thing at al from the Word, if so be it we desire
to do well, and say well, and to walk safely. We may understand this same by
the reason which follows, when he says,

23 For the commandment is a Lantern, and instruction, a light: and
corrections for instructions are the ways of life.
In this reason he shows, that he speaks of the Commandments, and
instructions, and corrections, which are made by the Word of God: for to it
only belongs these titles of Lantern, Esai. 2. 5. and 119. 105. 2. Pet. 2.
19. Psalm. 19. 8.
light, and life. For the law of the Lord is a perfect law. Thy Word is a
Lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my path And we have also a most sure
Word of the Prophets, to the which ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a
light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawne, and the day star
arise in your hearts. O house of Esai. 2. 5.
Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. And that they are
the ways of life, the Scripture not only in one or two places, but in diverse
does testify: and amongst others, our Lord Jesus does well show it, when he
says, that God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, to the end,
that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.
And when he Ioh. 3. 16. Mar. 16. 15.
commands the Gospel to be preached through all the world to every creature.
And though the Scripture should not witness it, there is none of sound
judgment, but will confess that they which receive the word of God, are in the
true way of life. We have therefore first of al to note, that they which are
disobedient unto fathers and mothers, and to them which have the power to
command, are in darkness, and know not whether they go: for they are
blind, though according as the world judges, they are in a good way, and that
they know wisely to govern themselves, and to do their business well. Secondly,
that they which refuse or despise the reprehensions by which men labor to
instruct them to change their evil life, do seek their own destruction and
damnation, they fly life, and desire death. Thirdly, what trouble, torment,
and affliction so ever the children of God have, they can not go astray, nor
perish: for they have the light of the Word, the which guides them right unto
life.

24 To keep thee from the wicked woman, and from the flattery of the tongue
of a strange woman.
After that Solomon has attributed life and light unto the Word generally, he
brings an example for to show, that without it no man can take heed from
wandering, and perishing. They which yield not obedience unto the Word, never
make conscience to commit whoredom, so blind are they and dull of wit, making
of vice virtue. Contrarily, they which delight to yield obedience unto the
commandments of God, do see how they should guide themselves by the light of
the Word, and thereby knowing that the whoremongers and adulterers do go out
of the right way, and walk through dark ways which lead unto death, they
take heed of the harlot, whom Solomon calls here the wicked woman: that is
to say, the woman that serves for nothing else but to work wickedness, and to
entice others unto evil. This enticing is meant by the flattery of the tongue
of the strange woman. For well to keep ourselves from whordome and adultery,
it is not enough to keep the body clean from whordom, and the tongue from
wanton words and filthy songs: but also we must have both hearts and eyes
chaste, as Solomon exhorts.

25 Desire not her beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her
eye liddes. 26 For because of the whorish woman, a man is brought unto a morsel
of bread, and a or, the wife of a man hunteth after the precious soul.
woman will hunt for the precious life of a man.
Our Lord Jesus Christ declares unto us the like, I say unto you, That
whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her, has Mat. 5. 28.
committed adultery with her already in his heart. The law giver is
spiritual, and therefore let us not think to fulfill it, if we show ourselves
only outwardly obedient unto his Word, doing the words that he commands,
and absteining from them which he forbids, and in the mean whiles our
hearts shall be rebellious, and delight in filthy lusts and unshamefast
looks: By such inward rebellions, by such lusts and looks, we are easily
drawn to commit whoredom: the first world is a witness thereof: We may see
it in Dina: David also has tried it. Nevertheless, Genesis 6. 2. and 34. 1. 2.
Sam. 11. 2.
when Solomon says, Desire not her beauty, he regards not only that it is
easy, to come from the rebellion of the heart, to show an outward
disobedience: but also by unshamefast life men come unto great poverty, and
danger of life: he shows it, when he says,

26 For because of the whorish woman, etc. He does show us that the harlots
are insatiable, and care not though their companions consume all their
substance upon them, and come to beggerie: and which worst is, they pity no
whit their destruction: but as an hunter does not willingly leave the wild
beast, when he has once seen her, but does hunt her unto death: even so the
harlot never ceasseth to solicit him to evil, which has once consented unto
her: and in this sort she not only makes him to beg his bread, but brings
him to destruction both of body and soul, the which is called precious, not
for the virtues wherewith it is adorned, nor for any goodness whereunto the
same is given (for the soul of such a man is void of al virtue, and is
corrupted through wickedness) but it is precious, because God does esteem it
so, as Genesis 1. 27.
he has showed in creating man after his Image and likeness, and giving him
an immortal soul. Even so the harlot,, so much as in them lies, do labor
to destroy the image of God, and cause that the precious blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ to be in vain, and without fruit, the which has been shed for
the salvation of the whole world. And this is the principal, wherein God has
well showed that man his soul is very dear unto him, when he would that his
Son should pay such a dear price. Or else if we shall say, that the soul of
man is said to be precious, because that the discreet man, does keep it
carefully, there is no absurdity therein. Such a poor estate and destruction
ought well to fear the whoremongers and adulterers: but for further to fear
the whoremongers, and to show them that their manners and customs are
abominable both before God and men, and that they shall not escape without
punishment, Solomon compares the law which condemns the adulterers unto the
fire, which spares nothing that is put unto it, or that it can catch, but
consumes it: for this to do, he says,

27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and not his clothes be burnt? 28 Or can
a man go upon coals, and his feet not be burnt? 29 So he that goes into
his neighbors wife, shall not be innocent, whosoever touches her.
If we reverence the word of Solomon, not his, but Gods, which is declared unto
us by him, as we may see it, we ought to have Deuteronomy. 22. 21
whoredom in great abomination, and to be greatly abashed and astonished at
the whoredoms that are committed through all the world: for it is but so much
fire kindled. And in this we see the consumption of these miserable
adulterers, the which is more horrible and more intolerable, then if all the
world burned with fire, and were consumed visibly: for their fire shall never be
quenched, nor their worm never die: but they shall burn, and shall be bitten
everlastingly. For the Lord will condemn al fornicatours and adulterers.
Notwithstanding, the Scripture co^descending unto our rudeness, Hebr. 13. 4.
does give and set before us the invisible things, by the visible, for to
turn us away from evil, and to cause us to desire the good, and that the
wicked may be touched in their consciences and minds, and that they may not
excuse themselves, that they have not been warned of the evil which is
prepared for them. For this cause Solomon compares the law which condemns
the adulterers, unto fire that is carried about, or otherwise is touched then
ought to be: it can not be avoided, but it will hurt, and burn that which it
touches: and herein he shows, that by whore hunting they themselves bear
their own destruction, from the which they can not escape. And this comparison
that Solomon makes, is very fitly done: for we must understand that the law
follows the nature of the Deuteronomy. 4. 24. Hebr. 12. 29. Deuteronomy. 33. 2.
law giver. For he says, The Lord thy God is a consuming fire. The Law
therefore burns, as also Moses does show. And the Lord came with ten
thousand of Saints, and at his right hand a fiery Law for them. We see
then, that whorekeepers and adulterers do consume and destroy themselves,
although they love and praise themselves. Secondly, that God knows well how
to punish them as wicked and full of iniquity. But by looking that God should
execute his vengeance, and make the adulterers feel it, he^ has other rods,
wherewith he strikes the adulterers, the which to declare, Solomon sets the
Thief in opposite of adultery, when he says,

30 Men do not despise a thief, when he steals, to satisfy his soul,
because he is hungry. 31 But if he be found, he shall restore seven fold, or
he shall give all the substance of his house.
There is no man will take it in good part, if any take away his goods without
his leave, for men desire rather to increase in riches, then to decrease.
Wherefore thieves are hated, and are pursued even to death. Yet when we know
that the thief has stolen but for need, he is excused, and is not judged to
be wicked: but he is borne withal, if he make satisfaction, or that there can
be so much found in his house for to recompense it. Solomon does signify it,
saying,

4 But if he be found, etc. Solomon requires here no more of the thief then
the law: but he shows that the thief shall rather Exo. 22. 1. 4.
give more then he ought, that he may escape if he be apprehended, and that his
offer shall be taken, and he accepted and allowed of again, when he has done
what he can. Albeit, then that Solomon does not here condemn the thief to
death, yet he excludes him not from sin, otherwise he should gain say the
Law, Thou shall not steal. Only for to show how abominable and miserable the
whormongers are, he sets the thief against the adulterer: and shows that
the thief may be redeemed, and that after his satisfaction, he is not marked
by civility of infamy, but that it is not so with adultery.

32 But he that commits adultery with a woman, he is destitute of
understanding: he that does it, destroys his own soul. 33 He shall find a
wound and dishonor, and his reproach shall never be put away. 34 For jealousy
is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 35
He can not bear the sight of any ransom: neither will he consent, though thou
augment the gifts.
He shows here that the adulterer deserves well to be despised, in that he
is not led to this filthiness but by wickedness, and not by necessity: as he
signifies, saying, he is destitute of understanding: and so he notes him of
infamy, from the which he exempteth the thief. He marketh also this misery,
saying, That he destroys his soul: the which he has not laid to the
thieves charge. Wherein we may see that the world is much void of sound
judgment. For a thief now shall be pursued with all diligence, to be punished,
even to death; but the adulterer shall be pardoned, and there shall be nothing else
but laughing at the horrible abomination that he shall commit, as were at a may
game or puppet play.

In speaking thus, we do not quit the thieves, and save the^ from punishment,
for we know what is written: but we would say that Romans 13. ^.
they which punish the thief more grievously then the adulterer, do injury
unto God, who has appointed a more grievous pain for the adulterer then for
the thief and thus they do wickedly, for the which, they shall not go
unpunished: they are wicked judges, favoring the wicked, but they shall appear
before the righteous judge, who will not favor their ungodliness, but will punish
them with all severity, and without any forgiveness. Although we speak
according to truth, whereunto al ought to agree and grant without gain saying:
yet it shall seem good unto the favorers of whoredom and adultery, that we
shall be overcome and they shall win the victory, if they should allege unto
us, that Jesus said unto the woman taken in adultery, Neither do I condemn
thee, go and sin no more: but we John. 8. 11.
answer that it belongs unto the Magistrates to execute the judgment that
God declares in his law, against the evil doers, and that to them only
appertains to take vengeance of the^ that commit evil, and not unto others.
But our Lord Jesus Christ was not sent into this world by God his Father, for
to exercise the office of the magistrate, but to show himself the Savior of
the world. Wherefore his office was rather to absolve, then to condemn:
notwithstanding he hindered not the Magistrate neither took his office upon
him, but it was lawful for the judge to have condemned this woman of adultery
to be stoned to death according to the law. He also saved the thief which
was hanged with him, and yet he reproved not the judge for punishing him, and
respected not but that the thief should suffer and feel the pains that he
had deserved before men. But they which favor whoredom and adulteries, will
reply that we are under the law of grace, and that the sharpness of the law
is abolished. I answer, that God never did withdraw his grace from his elect,
but that they have felt the same always at need, albeeit that now it is more
plainly manifested by the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ, and by the
preaching of his Gospel: And also he is not so pitiful and merciful, but that
he is also just, and does command the judges to do justice and judgment in all times. Moreover, if Jesus Christ by the forgiveness that he pronounced, unto
the adulterers, did put away the law, that does condemn the adulterers unto
bodily pains, even unto death, seeing that under the law of severity (as
they call it) the thief is not so sore to be punished as the adulterer, it
should follow that under the law of grace (as they call it) the thief ought not
to be so grievously punished as the adulterer: otherwise, the law of grace
should bring favor unto the most wicked, and should show severity that was
not wont to be used unto them which are not so wicked: and thus the law of
grace should deal sharply with them that were wont to be more gently entered
under the law of severity. But it will be answered, That it is expedient so to
do, because the thieves are more hurtful to the common wealth then adulterers.
I answer, that ma^s wisdom does so judge it: for men void of the holy Ghost,
do make no great account of adultery, in comparison of theft: but God judges
otherwise, as we may understand by the law that he has given, and by the
vengeances and punishements that he has ^^nt because of whoredoms and
adulteries. After this, Solomon does declare unto us what happens unto the
adulterer for the smalnes of his understanding, when he says,

He shall find a wound, etc. Solomon does not here speak of that which we
see commonly done unto the adulterers* for they are suffered to live at their
ease, they are feasted, and are not put back as infamous and wicked. He
speaks of that which ought to be done: for if there were such government in
the world as there ought to be, then the adulterers should not escape grievous
punishments, they should be more despised then the mire in the street, we
would fly further from them, than from the most stinking dounghil of the world,
we would abhor them more then the most dangerous Pestilence, we would
evermore have them in execration, and we would never name them but to their
great shame and dishonor. For as Solomon says, his reproach ought not to be
put out. And he gives the reason hereof, in this verse following, when he
says:

For jealousy, etc. If the husband of the wife with whom adultery has bin
committed, did truly love his wife before she had committed adultery, and that
he had his heart right, his jealousy should be so kindled with anger and wrath
against the adulterous man, that he would withal diligence pursue him that he
might be punished, as he has deserved, and would have no compassion of him,
but would crave vengeance to be done of him, as behooves, there should no
prayers of friends, nor presents, nor gifts, although they were great and
precious, which would move him to turn from his anger: as Solomon does declare
it by that which follows.

He can not bear the sight, etc. If then at the pursuit of the husband,
justice be done, the adulterer, shall find a wound, and shall be dishonored for
ever. And if the Governors, and such as bear the sword, had the zeal of
God, as they ought to have, they would not tarry til the adulterers were
pursued: but when there were any discovered, they should make diligent
information to follow them with all severity. They would follow the zeal of
Phineas. But in stead to have such a zeal, the greatest part of Judges Number.
25. 7. Psalm. 106. 30. 1. Sam. 2. 22.
belike unto Elie. The chief cause for the which men pass not to commit
adultery and whoredom, and also that Judges do not punish whoremongers and
adulterers as they deserve, is, for that every man desires to have his carnal
pleasure, and therefore must bear with his Gosseps: and al comes from the
contempt of Gods word. Solomon has well showed it here above in the twentieth
verse: when to detest whoredom and adultery, he admonishes the children to
obey their fathers and mothers. He does well show it consequently, in the
beginning of the next Chapter.

The seventh Chapter.
1 My Son, keep my words, and hide my Commandments with thee.
Here we see the fatherly care that God has of us, when he does so often
admonish us by Solomon, that we should keep his Word, not only without works,
as hypocrites do, but that we should have our hearts truly garnished. It goes
well for us that he has the care when he does thus admonish us: for he has
no need of our service, but we have great need of his, yea we can not well
miss it, for to obey him. We have seen it heretofore in diverse places, where
Solomon has declared unto us the profit that comes of obeying the Word, and
the hurt of the disobedience. Solomon does show it us again, when he says,

2 Keep my Commandments, and thou shall live; and mine instruction, as the
apple of thine eye. 3 Bind them upon thy fingers, and write them upon the
table of thine heart.
For as by the keeping of the Commandments, and by the great care that we have
to follow the doctrine of God with all our hearts, life is given unto us: Even so
it may be truly inferred, that the adulterers by contemning of the Word, are
deprived thereof, for the which they must needs perish and destroy their own
souls, and are not spared in the day of vengeance. Solomon does well signify
it, when he asks so great a care: and therewith he signifies a great
fatherly gentleness, when he shows that God is contented with us, if we have
such care of his most precious Word, as we have Psalm. 19. 11.
of the apples of our eyes, which is no great thing, seeing the bod^^ is not
much worth. If we will avoid whoredom and adultery, and have life, we must
have this great care that Solomon requires, not only for a certain time, but
that we should be so given unto his holy commandments and instructions, that
we should continually work thereafter, and have our hearts always fixed
upon them. Solomon does so wish it, when he says,

Bind them upon thy fingers, etc. He craves this, following that which is
said, Lay up these my words in your heart and in Deuteronomy. 11. 18
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they be as a
frontlet before your eyes. And for to show us further that we must have our
hearts given unto the commandments, and that we should love them, in taking
our joy and pleasure in them, he says,

4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister: and call understanding thy kinswoman:
5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger that
is smooth in her words.
For as much as we have neither wisdom nor knowledge, but so much as the Word
of God does print in our hearts, and that it pleases him to give us: we
ought to understand that Solomon would have us like unto the blessed man: so
doing, wisdom should be as our sister, and understanding should be familiar
unto us, and we shall be contented Psalm. 1. 1.
to love wisdom, and understanding shall keep us continual company, and so
shall we not be given to seek dishonest company, nor will not suffer ourselves
to be deceived with the flattering speeches of whores. Solomon does signify it
by that which follows, saying,

5 That they may keep thee, etc. It is by wisdom and understanding then that
we obtain life: and by the use of the Word, that we eschew whoredom and
adultery, and not by man's wisdom, nor by our free will.

6 As I was in the window of mine house, I looked through my window. 7 And I
saw among the fools, and considered amongst the children, a young man
destitute of understanding. 8 Who passed through the street by her corner, and
went toward her house, 9 In the twilight in the evening, when the night began
to be black and dark. 10 And behold, there met him a woman, with an harlottes
behavior, and subtle in heart. 11 She is babbling and loud: whose feet can
not abide in her house. 12 Now she is without, now in the streets, and
lies in wait at every corner. 13 So she caught him and kissed him, and with
an impudent face said unto him, 14 I have peace offeringes: this day have I
paid my vows. 15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, that I might seek thy
face: and I have found thee. 16 I have decked my bed with ornaments, carpets and
laces of Egypt. 17 I have perfumed my bed with Myrrh, Aloes, and Cynamon. 18
Come, let us take our fill of love, until the morning: let us take our pleasure
in daliance. 19 For my husband is not at home: he is gone a journey far of. 20
He has taken with him a bag of silver, and will come home at the day
appointed. 21 Thus with her great craft she made him to yield: and with her
flattering lips she intised him. 22 And he followed her straight ways, as an
Ox that goes to the slaughter, and as a Foale to the flocks for correction.
23 Til a dart stricke through his liver, as a byrd hastes to the snare, not
knowing that he is in danger.
For to turn us away from whoredom and adultery, he uses a parable, in the
which he shows the foolishnes of them that suffer themselves to be deceived,
wherein they are not so much ignorant, but that they know well they do evil:
and therefore will not be seen. He shows also the suttleties and craftines,
the flatteries and sweet words of them, or those which labor to draw others
to agree unto their wicked concupiscences. When he attributes the suttleties
and crafty dealings, the flattering speeches, and sweet words of the
adulterous woman, he speaks according to that which is most commonly done:
for if there were no women that sold themselves, and would brag, there
should not be so many open adulteries, nor whoredoms. For to begin this
parable, he speaks of himself, as of a man which marketh and takes heed
what others do: and yet he will not have it known, that he might take them in
the deed doing, if they do evil. He signifies this, when he says, He did
not put his head out of the window, for to look with an open face, and to
show himself openly, but he looked through the window. And herein he
teaches that it is needful to use suttletie, for to discover whoredom, that
the same may be punished and corrected, and to the end also that when we shall
see the wickednesses that were thought to be secret, to be manifested, men
might be turned from evil, and to take heed of giving offense and slander,
and that they might learn to fear God by the corrections and punishments that
they shall see executed upon others. He also after a sort, signifies that the
adulterers and whoremongers do fear men more then God, when they dare do
that before God, which they will not do before men, though God do see al
things in all places, how secret and hid soever they be.

7 And I saw among the fools, etc. When we privily look and narowly take
heed unto the vices and wickednesses, we discover them the more easily. Then
are the scorners and contemners of God and of his law made manifest, the which
Solomon calls fools, because they are ignorant, but yet willingly; they are
dull of understanding, but yet of malice; they are bare of understanding, but
yet through contempt of the Word. Now although that such people be out of
order, yet amongst them there are some which are more willingly wicked, and
do pass the rest in wickedness and dissoluteness. Solomon does signify it,
when he says, that he saw among the fools, and considered amongst the
children, that is to say, which were fools, a young man destitute of
understanding: wherein he teaches us, that it is very necessary to take
diligent heed unto young people, and not to suffer them to live as they list,
after their sensuality, otherwise that they shall loose understanding. It
seems them good, and also they like, that they are very bold, when they give
themselves unto wickedness, and that they spare neither body nor goods for to
enjoy their desires: but before God, and before men of sound judgment, they
want understanding or courage: for by getting virtue, they follow vice: leaving
that which is necessary, they give themselves unto vanity: rejecting that
which is profitable, they embrace that which is unprofitable and hurtful.
Chastity is a thing of great virtue, profitable, and necessary: he then that
does follow it, is very strong: and contrarily, he which runs unto
unshamefastness, is a very cowheard, and wants understanding: for by forsaking
his office, he passes his time in following of whores and adulteresses, and
yet he thinks that it is not seen. Solomon does declare it, when he says,

8 Who passed through the street, etc. And because he is overcome in his
conscience that he does wickedly, he will not be seen: and therefore he
passes by the lane, and enters into the house of the whore.

9 In the twilight, etc. When Solomon does assemble so many words together
and not vainly, the which do signify darkness: we ought first of al to learn
that they which have the charge to watch over the slanders, dissolutions and
insolences, and to govern the youth, ought to be so watchful, that they might
take the evil doers, how close and hid soever they be, that they may be
corrected and brought again unto the right way, and severely to punish the
unrepentant. Secondly, that they which give themselves unto evil, and chiefly
unto whordome and adultery, are diligent to seek holes and corners: but that
there is nothing so dark nor hid, but in time God will reveal it. Solomon does
well note it, when he says, that he saw in the twilight, etc. If the youth and
others of small understanding, did read this text as it behooves, they would
not commit so many whordomes and adulteries. For first of al, they would have
the fear of God by reverence of his Word, the which is greatly contemned:
secondly, they would have fear, lest such filthiness should come to the
knowledge of men, and should be offended thereat.

10 And behold there met him, etc. It is a common thing for him to find evil,
that seeks evil, and find her he shall: we have here an example thereof.
For as we have seen, the young man takes his way right unto the house of the
harlot, and behold an whore comes out to meet him, as Solomon says now.
She is crafty, not to deceive those which are of a good mind and love
chastity. Solomon has already noted it, by that which he has said of the
pathe, of the house, and also of the twilight or mystie morning: He shows it
well again, when he says, with an harlots behavior. She is not hid then,
but she shows herself. One part of her behavior whereby she declares
herself to be such, is that she is met early in the mystie morning, and
that by such early walking, we may gather that she means no goodness. For it
is an unmeet time, for women chiefly, and if they be honest women, they will
not walk in dark night, but upon great necessity. Solomon does expound
this whorish behavior more amply, when he says,

11 She is babbling and loud. If women then will not be found in harlots
behavior, they must strive against their nature, which is to speak much. This
same proceeds from them, for want of doing 1. Tim. 5. 13.
their duty, as we may understand it, when Saint Paul says, that there are
young widows, the which are idle, and learn to go from house to house, yea
they are not only idle, but also pratlers and busy bodies, speaking things
which are not comely. They must also take heed to be overcome and carried away.

Now although that we know well how they are bablers and naughty packes,
and that the same is proved before us more then were needful, yet Solomon, for
their great confusion, and to advertise the fools and ignorant, does first of
al declare unto us, her inticements saying, That her feet can not abide in the
house, but that,

Now she is without, now in the streets, etc. Solomon here shows unto
women, that they ought to be careful to do the business at home in the house,
and to go abroad as seldom as they may: otherwise, if they love to run hither
and thither, without there be great necessity known, they are in harlots
behavior, and are suspected of whoredom. Wherefore the wives that desire to
be well named and counted of, and would be esteemed indeed for honest women,
let them abstain from prattling, and from gadding about. For though it were so,
that they me^t no evil, yet shall they not cease to be counted whores. They may
allege that they can not abide to be Nuns and shut up, but they must have
their recreatio^, and that they care not though it be spoken of, and men
offended at it: but cursed is that recreation which is taken with the offense
of the neighbor. Saint Paul is not satisfied with this, that we should do no
evil, but he would 1. These. 5. 22.
that we should abstain from al appearance of evil. When we once loose shame
in any matter, we easily abound in whordome, we take leave to do acts, and to
speak words which show manifestly what the person is. Solomon does show it,
saying,

13 So she caught him and kissed him, etc. An honest woman will not come near
unto a man that is not her husband, to kiss him: but if a strange man, how
honest so ever he be, do offer to kiss her, she cannot receive it, without
some shame for it. Contrarily, an harlot is unshamefast, and without shame
kisseth all that she desires to do wickedly withal. True it is, that to
counterfeit an honest woman, she will not be seen of al men: as Solomon has
well noted it, by the dark morning. After that he has showed the harlots
inticement indeedes, he comes to show her inticement in talk, the which he
has here before briefly touched: and to begin, he says that the whore
speaks thus unto the young man:

14 I have peace offerings, etc. For better to deceive the indiscreet man, she
labors to make him believe that she will entice him unto none evil. For when
she makes mention of the peaceable offringes that she has made, and of the
vows that she has paid the same day, she braggeth of her devotion and
holiness, the which is as much as if she did say, that she is pure and
clean, and that the young man should not think that she would allure him to
filthiness and uncleanness now since she has paid so well her duty, that it was
lawful for him to give himself unto wickedness, and that for it no evil should
come to him. Behold how we abuse holy things, that is, that under the shadow
of the^ what evil soever we commit, yet will be esteemed for honest men: And
also because of the^, license is taken to do evil, without fear of punishment.
And thus holy things through malice of hypocrites are applied unto bawdry, and
do serve for a cloak unto the wicked, that they may not be so easily taken, and
that we cannot take heed of them. But what corners soever they seek, God
sees them, and can, and will, when he sees time, punish it. Also this mercy
he shows unto his faithful servants which do love his word, that they
judge them thereby. Besides this, the wicked do blaspheme and speak wickedly
of the service of God, when they attribute that he is the cause they come to
end of their desire, albeit they are dissolute and wanton. Solomon here
brings in the whore thus blaspheming.

13 Therefore came I forth, etc. The harlot thus blasphemeth, making the
service of God the cause of the finding of that she sought for, and thinks
herself happy, as it is noted by the fit or good time. In this sort al wicked
rejoice, and judge themselves happy, when they come unto the end of their
enterprises, though they be wicked: they praise God with their mouth, and
thank him: but it is not the true God, for they have him not in their heart,
but the Devil whom they serve: and thus it is in an evil hour that they meet
with that they seek for: for they fall into death though they feel nothing:
they are like unto leprous men which feel nothing when they are pricked: but
suddenly shall their destruction come, wherewith they shall be beaten down, then
shall they feel, that it was in no good time that they took their desire. And
in that the young man took the way to the harlots house, and that she meets
with him, first we see that the wicked are all of one mind and consent, but
not in God. Wherefore their agreement is cursed, and is esteemed for a wicked
conspiracy and rebellion against God. If we would that our agreements should
be good and pleasant unto God, we must then serve God and our neighbors in
them, as the holy Scripture does teach us. Secondly, that the wicked do seek
one for another, but it is to fulfill their wicked lust.

16 I have decked my bed, etc. After that the wicked have served God, or else
that they have made but a semblance, they think it is lawful to have care of
their flesh to fulfill their co^cupiscences, to take their ease and their
pleasures. These ornaments and perfumes do well show it. And also in the
rehearsing of them we may see a point of Art, and knack of flattery, and
sweet words of the whore: for in speaking so, she fanneth and draws the
indiscreet man by things pleasant unto the eyes, and that likes the flesh.
Although then that the ornaments of themselves are not evil, and that it is
lawful to use sweet smells and arromatical savors, not only for necessity,
but also for recreation: yet must we take heed to be too curious, otherwise
we may give occasion to be judged that we are too delicate and carnal, and
that we love ostentation. We must be sober and temperate in the use of things
that are not necessary: and also we must not be so straight and scrupulous,
that we dare in no wise handle them, and that we judge and condemn them which
use them. Such things are creatures of God, the which are clean unto the
faithful, which can use the^ reasonably but unto the^ they are defiled, which
vntemperately use them, as do the infidels, which defile all that they handle.
And so, whatsoever fair and goodly thing the whoremongers and adulterers, and
other wicked Titus. 1. 15.
ones have, is but filthiness; their sweet savors, is but stinch; their good
meats, is but poison. Al things are clean to them them that are clean: but
to them that are polluted and infidels nothing is clean, etc. We must then
beware to envy the delights, eases and pleasures of the wicked: otherwise we
are in danger to defile al thing, and to be given unto filthiness and shameful
things: for also we see that the harlot makes mention of her ornaments and
perfumes, to the end to entice and allure the young indiscreet man to commit
whoredom and adultery. She well shows that she tends to this end, when
she keeps not back from declaring what she would, saying,

Come let us take our fill, etc. Here she openly calls the young man to
give over himself unto uncleanness, to commit whoredom with all greediness:
she calls him as though she would make him great cheer, and drink wholly
his fill, even till he be ready to burst and spue again. As the drunkardes do
delight in wine and do not cease gladly drinking, til they be dunken, and
can no more: even so the whoremongers and adulterers do rejoice themselves in
their filthiness, and do cast themselves therein with an unbridled desire. Unto
such a plu^ging the harlot calls the young man, but it is in speaking
improperly of love, as do all they which speak of the love of the flesh, and
after the world: for she calls the desire that men have to commit
whoredom, and even the very act it self, Love. The Lord has created love
between man and wife, making her an helper unto man, and making two in one
Genesis 2. 2^.
flesh: he has also commanded that every man should love his neighbor as
himself: and contrarily, he hates whoredom as it may be seen by the
punishments he has made thereof: he has Leu. 19. 18
also expressly forbidden whoredom in his law. It is then spoken deceitfully,
when we say, that knaves and harlottes do love together: for there is no
manner of love between them, but as there is among such as seek to destroy
one another, etc. Also if there were among such people true love, it should
remain what affliction soever came, and thereby they should be stirred up for
to govern themselves well and honestly. For love is pacient, etc. 1. Cor. 18. 4.


19 For mine husband, etc. Albeit that the harlot has alleged her sacrifices
and vows that she has performed and paid, for to show that it was lawful
for him to give over himself, yet she knows well that she does evil: even so
does the young man, as it appeared by the twilight or mistie morning, etc. It
appears now again in the absence of her husband: the far journey and the
day appointed are here alleged: for it is as much as if he did say, that she
knows well that she will commit wickedness, that she durst not do, her
husband being present: and yet though he is absent, that she would not be so
bold, but that she knows that he is gone a far journey, and has matters
of weight in his mind, as it is noted by the bag of money: and also that he
had told her the day of his return again: for otherwise she would be afraid
to be taken in the act doing. And in the holding herself assured, she labors
to assure the young man, that he should not fear to be hurt or have shame
on her husbands part: the which were not needeful, except the whoremonger
knew well that he does evil in committing such filthiness. But besides this
we do first learn, that the married man ought not to absent himself far of
from his house, and chiefly if he have a dainty dame: for he leaves her in
danger: and if he himself be not very chaste, is assaulted of many lusts, from
the which he should be exempted being at home with his wife. Secondly, that it
is not the greatest blessing that can happen unto a woman to be richly married,
and chiefly when to increase the goods, the husband must travel abroad. It
happens also that the rich man for to take his pastime, and to recreate
himself, takes in hand long voyages which are not necessary, but hurtful
both to his family and to the poor, for whose help in their necessity he
should stay himself, etc.

21 Thus with her great craft, etc. By such persuasions the indiscreet does
feel that the lips of the strange women drop as an honny comb: but after
sweetness comes bitterness, and it comes before that a man think of it,
and without looking for it: Solomon does show it, when he says,

22 And he followed her, etc. He uses four similitudes, for to show that
there is great bitterness in whoredom, and that the whoremongers are so dull
witted, that they perceive nothing: wherein the Proverb is verified, A fool
never believes so long as he receives. The similitudes are manifest, and they
are daily proved, and thereby we should be sufficiently advertised to
beware of whordome and adultery. Notwithstanding Solomon ceasseth not to
exhort us still as his children:

24 Hear me now therefore, O children, and hearken unto the words of my
mouth. 25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways: wander thou not in her
paths. 26 For she has caused many to fall down wounded, and the strong men
are all slain by her. 27 Her house is the way unto the grave, which goes down
unto the chambers of death.
By this admotion we may see whereunto he tended by the former similitudes,
that is to say, to teach us to take good heed that we give not our hearts
unto strange women, and to follow whoredom and adultery. Also he teaches
us, that the chief remedy for to avoid such uncleanness, is to hear the
word of GOD, and thereunto, too apply our understanding. They then which make
no count of this holy word, are very worthy to be forsaken of God, and given
up to a reprobate sense, for to commit filthiness with all greediness of
mind.

26 For she has caused many to fall, etc. Because there are some which judge
that it is but a trifling matter, to keep company with knaves and whores; and
do think themselves so wise, that they have no need to be diswaded from
such company, and that whatsoever acquaintance they have with such people,
that they will keep themselves well enough from defiling, and will take no hurt
thereby: Solomon shows here that his exhortation is necessary for all men,
when he says that the harlot makes many to fall, etc. The universal flood is
an example thereof: Sampson, David and Solomon have proved it to be true for a
time. And for to show that he speaks not of the corporal nature, but of
the loss of the souls of those which will not abstain, he adds,

27 Her house is the way, etc. This is the same that he has said in the 2.
Chapter 18. 19. verses: and Chap. 5. verses 4. 5. Wherefore it shall not need
to repeat the same again.

The viii. Chapter.
1 Does not wisdom cry? and understanding utter her voice? 2 She stands in
the top of high places by the way in the place of the paths. 3 She cries
besides the gates before the city at the entry of the doors. 4 O men, I call
unto you, and utter my voice to the children of men. 5 O ye foolish men,
understand wisdom, and ye, O fools, be wise in heart. 6 Give ear, for I
will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall teach
things that be right. 7 For my mouth shall speak the truth, and my lips
abhor wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous: there is no
lewdness, nor frowardness in them. 9 They are al plain to him that will
understand, and straight to them that would understand. 10 Receive mine
instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather then fine gold. 11 For
wisdom is better then precious stones: and al pleasures are not to be
compared unto her. 12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and I find forth
knowledge and counsels.
FOr to show unto the foolish and indiscreet that they cannot be excused,
for having followed and obeyed the desires and lusts of their flesh, although
they have been tempted after diverse sorts: Solomon does here pronounce unto us
by an interrogation, that if the foolish and indiscreet have yielded to
enticement by temptation, following their untamed lusts, that it has not bin
for want of doctrine, exhortation, and correction, but by contempt of wisdom
and understanding, whereby they care not to give their hearts and minds unto
the holy sermons, which are made by the Pastors of the Church, both publicly
and privately: by whom wisdom cries, and understanding lifts up, and
thundereth with her voice, when they purely handle the Scripture, seeking the
glory of GOD, and the edifiyng of their neighbors. And to the end that none
should allege that he has not heard this proclamation, nor understood this
calling: Solomon does show us, that God has not imparted his wisdom unto his
ministers for to hide themselves, and to stop their mouths: so have they
openly showed it, and preached it plainly: and yet still as this day they
continue, Solomon does show it, when he says,

2 She stands in the top, etc. This is the same that has bin said before in
the first Chapter, verses, 20. and 21. But besides that which was there said,
we must note that Solomon uses both there and here a Verb that signifies to
cry aloude, either for joy or for sorrow. Now when he cries after men, and
that it is not for any virtue they have, but rather to reprove them for their
sins, then it follows that the cry is made for grief and sorrow. That it
is after men, he expresses:

4 O men, etc. And that it is not for their virtues, he shows, when he
calls them ignorant and fools, saying,

5 O ye foolish men, understand wisdom, etc. But although respecting them
with whom he has to do, he is minded to cry for sorrow, pity and
compassion that he has to see the^ without understanding and without heart: yet
he cries chiefly for an other respect, to wit, because it is his duty to
cry, and also that he cries not by pronou^cing vain and frivolous things,
as he declares:

6 Give ear, for I will speak, etc. When Solomon in the person of wisdom is
not grieved with much speaking, but uses copy, and is plentiful in words,
saying, I call you, my voice cries, understand, be learned, hearken: he
shows us the great compassion that he has of the foolishness of men, and
therewith speaks cheerfully: and does show us, that albeit that after the
outward appearance we think not to profit by preaching, by exhortations and
corrections, that yet we must not be grieved too do our office of teaching,
exhorting, correcting, reproouing and threatening, by following Moses, the
Prophets, Jesus Christ and his Apostles. And also albeit that the ignorant
and foolish, that will not yield unto the truth, but follow wickedness and
lying, do well deserve to be deceived by lies, and be left in a reprobate
sense, that yet our office is to speak of excellent things, worthy to be
proclaimed, and which are so clear and manifest, that none can be deceived in
hearing them, so that any man cannot be turned from righteousness and equity,
but that they show the right way of them rather. Solomon does give us well to
understand this same, when after having promised notable, excellent or clear
things, he promises to teach things that are right, by the opening of his
lips. Whereupon the reason follows.

7 For my mouth shall speak the truth, etc. When Solomon sets truth in
his mouth that speaks notable things, he 1. Cor. 1. 2. 4 Col. 2. 8.
shows that the Minister for to declare excellent things, must not come with
highness of words or wisdom, neither must his preaching stand in enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in pure truth, and also that the people should take
heed to be ouertake^ by Philosophy and vain deception, according to the
tradition of men, and institutions of the world. Moreover, when Solomon
places truth against wickedness, we ought to vnderdande, that the truth
stands not only in words, but in sincerity of heart, in uprightness of
conscience, in holy thoughts, in good desires, and in a strong and lively
faith, the which works by love not fained, doing good and righteous unto the
glory of God, and profit, and edifiyng of our neighbor: thus doing, we may
truly say with Solomon, My mouth shall speak the truth. We must also
understand, that whatsoever is contrary unto the truth, is wickedness, and
we must abhor and detest it, though it have an external fair appearance,
and that the wise men of the world do praise it: nevertheless Solomon
speaks here chiefly of the doctrine of truth, the which is pronounced for
to turn man away from his wickedness, and to guide him unto justice and
equity: the which he shows when he faith:

8 All the words of my mouth, etc. If the^ we would be preserved from
frowardness and dissolution, we must follow the sayings of wisdom, which
teaches us by Solomon, and by the Ministers of truth, whose doctrine tends
to none other end, then that al wickedness being forsaken, we should give
ourselves unto righteousness, by deniyng all superstition and idolatry, all
infidelity and distrust, all filthiness and dishonestie, all injury and
wrong, al deceit and unfaithfulness: and that we should serve one only God
by faith, in spirit and truth: and our neighbors in love, seeking that which
is for their profit in all honesty and chastity. It is the righteousness that
is taught us by the sayings of wisdom, to the which we must be very attentive,
if we would easily attain thereto: and not to remain in ignorance, if we will
find them plain, he declares, saying.

9 They are all plain, etc. Also none but the careless, ignorant, and
contemners do find the word of GOD troublesome, hard, sharp, and severe, It
behooves us then to be learned, and to be diligent to get knowledge, and to
prefer it before al things that can be desired in the world, how precious
soever they be. Solomon does call us thereunto when, he says:

10 Receive mine instruction, etc. Then shall we have true knowledge, Chap. 2.
verses 1. 2. 3. 4. and. 5. It is not without cause that he does thus admonish
us: as he does show, saying,

11 For wisdom is better then precious stones, etc. This is the same that he
has said in the 3. Chapter, and in the 13. 14. and 15. verses: and also
again in the same Chapt. in the 16. 17. 18. 19. and 20. verses, he has showed
in what sort it is better. The reasons that he has given us heretofore, ought
to be sufficient to make us careful to follow wisdom, and to be diligent
hearers of his sayings: but for to stir us up furthermore, Solomon does show
us here again how wisdom is better, when he says:

12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, etc. What abundance of wealth, and what
ease, and pleasures soever man can have, yet he is neither the wiser nor
discreter, the^ if he were poor and miserable: but in what state and condition
soever we be, yet if we have wisdom, we are discrete and well advised, and
governed. Better is the Eccle. 4. 13. and. 9. 15.
poor and wise child, than an old and foolish king, which will be no more
admonished. And there was found therein a poor and wise man, and he delivered
the city by his wisdom. And because there is none of sound judgment which
does not much more desire to have discretion and counsel for to be able to
govern himself, and to keep himself from hurt and danger, rather then to
have great riches, and therewith to be ignorant and foolish, it follows
thereof that wisdom is best. I say expressly of sound judgment: for we must
not make comparison of things after the opinion and fantasy of people which
are of a froward or corrupted judgment: as are al they which have their mind
on this world: they care not what they be, nor what they do, so that they may
have riches: they think themselves wise enough, seeing they have riches: but
for all that, before God they are fools, as appears by the rich man whereof
Luke speaks, O fool, this night will they fetch away thy soul Luke. 12. 20
from thee: then whose shall those things be which thou have provided? They are
also enemies of GOD: for they are governed after Romans 8. 7.
the affection of the flesh, which is enimitie against God.

13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, as pride and arrogancy, and the
evil way: and a mouth that speaks lewd things, I do hate. 14 I have counsel
and wisdom: I am understanding, and I have strength.
Because that Solomon has here before much praised wisdom the which also he
continues in the beginning of this eight Chapter: Pro. 3. 14. Pro. 1. 7.
and to attain thereto that we must have the fear of the Lord. For the fear
of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, and also he does much praise
wisdom unto us, to the end that we should aspire thereunto: for this cause
now he teaches us what it is to fear of the Lord, that we may know what
we have to do for Pro. 3. 7
to obtain wisdom. Here before he has briefly showed us it, when he has
said, Fear the Lord, and withdraw thy self from evil. In this verse, he
says the very same under diverse words, and more at large. For having said
that the fear of the Lord is to hate evil: he shows what kind of evil he
means, when in the person of Wisdom he says, I hate, etc. Whereupon we
must note, that the wuil whereof he speaks, is not the miseries and
calamities which happen unto us in this present life, nor that the torments
that the wicked do and shall suffer after the temporal death. Wherefore those
which fear God for the regard of such evils, have not truly the fear of
God, but as the diuelles have, do they fear the torments: they fear God as
a thief fears the Judge Even so they deserve that God should show himself
such toward them, as the just and sharp judge does show himself toward
the thieves, that is, after the indictment and condemnation he sends them to
the gallows, there too end their days: the which shall happen unto them,
except they change their manners, and that in steed of fearing the torments,
they hate their wicked life, which is the evil whereof Solomon speaks in this
place: he himself does declare it, saying immediately, I hate pride, etc.
Amongst the euilles that we must hate, there is pride and arrogancy, which
are euilles clean contrary to the fear of the Lord: for he that fears God,
truly submits himself with all humility to be ordained by his word.
Contrarily, the proud and arrogant does contemn both GOD and his word, and
think themselves wise enough to govern and rule themselves, and cannot suffer
any correction, nor exhortation, but do scoff thereat: and as they scorn, so
are they again scorned of God.

Wherefore we must understand that it is not without cause that Solomon
admonishes us saying, Be not wise in thine own eyes: but fear the Lord, and
come back from evil. Secondly, the evil conversation, the which is contrary
also unto the fear of the Lord. For evil companies, wicked manners, and
froward conditions cannot be followed without falling away, even to the for
getting of God, and making no conscience to offend him, and to do wrong to our
neighbors: and in so doing we cast away the fear of the Lord: they are of
the number of them which forsake the right path to walk by dark ways. From
the which if we will be delivered, and not be like unto them, let us hold
fast the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom. Then shall we
understand righteousness, Pro. 2. 13
and judgment, and equity, and every good path. Thirdly, afrowarde mouth, the
which shows plainly that a man has Pro. 2. 9.
not the fear of God, but is wicked and ungodly. It is not without cause that
such frowardness of mouth is hated of wisdom, Pro. 6. 12
and that they which love wisdom, do abhor this frowardnes: for he that is
wise, loves the honor and glory of God, he greatly esteems the sincere
truth and sound doctrine: he rejoices at the good name of his neighbors:
he reuerenceth the law of God: and so he takes not the name of God in vain,
neither speaks false witness against his neighbor: he obeieth this
commandment, Put from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lips far from
thee. If then we will be wise, the fear of God is needeful for us to make us
to turn away from evil, which displeases God, and all men of good conscience.

14 I have counsel, etc. For as much as there is none but desires to be well
counseled, and directed in his affairs, to the end that they may be duly
and rightly guided, that he may profit thereby, and take no hurt: forasmuch also
as we are very glad to know, and be able to perform, and execute our
thoughts, wills, purposes, and enterprises, we must be very careful to have
wisdom: for it is she that counsels those which take her, which does
direct Eccle. 9. 14. 15
them, which gives them understanding and strengthens the^. Solomon does
declare it us here briefly, and Ecclesiastes does likewise show the same.
Herein we may know that he speaks not of humane wisdom: for seeing it is
foolish and vain, and that it vanishes away easily, we cannot attribute the
virtues unto it, 1. Cor. 1. 18 and. 3. 18. Esaias. 11. 2.
whereof Saint Paul speaks. They apperteine only to the spirit of God. But
we are not partakers of this spirit, except that we receive the word of GOD,
and that it be deeply graven in our hearts, in such wise that it be our
guide and directer, and that thereby we may learn to walk manly, to bear all
afflictions, and to resist al temptations. Likewise this only Word is our
wisdom and Deuteronomy. 4. 6
knowledge. It is no wonder then, though the world be so evil governed, though
there be so much ignorance, and that so much people fall, and are destroyed,
seeing this word is so much despised as it is. We must also understand that
the school divines do greatly err, when they do attribute unto men free
will, and the power to govern and guide themselves: for they blaspheme against
the holy Ghost, and are unthankful, or at leastwise endeavor to bring all the
world to unthankfulness, and are arrogant, when, so much as in them lies,
they dispossess the holy Ghost of his benefits and gifts, and attribute them
unto men, and in this manner he turns them away from the true wisdom.
Wherefore eschuing the^ as a deadly pestilence, thrusting them away as doung
and filthiness, let us take heed we smell not too much of them: but let us
harken unto sobriety. The which we shall do, if with humblenes we
acknowledge Romans 12. 3. John. 15. 5. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Philip. 2. 1^.
ourselves to be the graftes, and that we truly confess with Saint Paul,
that we are not able of ourselves, but our strength comes of God. Let us not
then be proud and arrogant: but by humility of mind, let us occupy ourselves
about our salvation etc. This humility is very necessary for us, when our
eternal salvation lies upon it, since, that in less things we have need of
wisdom to guide and govern ourselves, without the which our temporal
affairs, which are nothing in comparison of our souls cannot stand, but fall
to decay. Solomon does well show it, when he says,

15 By me Kings reign, and Princes decree justice. 16 By me Princes rule, and
the nobles, and all the judges of the earth.
When wisdom speaks thus, she well shows that counsel and wisdom are
hers, etc. For a king does not truly reign, except he govern his people by
good counsel and wisdom, but rather is a tyrant, if he would have al go
after his fantazie, and that his will must serve for all reason. Likewise a king
does not reign except he can defend his subjects against the violence of
the wicked which trouble them, and seek their destruction: but is an ydol.
Likewise without such virtues the magistrates which sit in the judgment seat,
shall not be able to yield unto every man his own, but do wrong unto many,
being led by their affections, and proceeding by accepting of persons. To be
short, there are neither Princes, Lords, nor judges which can rule as they
ought, except they be endued with these virtues, but do exercise tyranny and
cruelty. Al kings, counselors, Princes, Lords, and judges must then learn
wisdom, and be obedient thereunto, if they will rule and reign as they
ought, and do their office, acknowledging what place they hold, and that the
Lord of Lords, to Psalm. 2. 8.
whom they owe homage and high service, is above them to destroy them and
confound them, except they do their duty. For to Exodus 18. 21. 2. Chro. 19.
6.
be well instructed, they must be such as Iethro demands and counsels
Moses to choose: and such as Iosaphat describes. If we have not such Lords,
we must impute the same unto our sins, and patie^tly to bear the yoke,
provided always that in obeying them, we do neither offend God nor our
neighbors: for it is not lawful to rebel against them, though they be wicked:
for they are ordained, not by men, but by the divine providence, as Solomon
does show it by the words above said: and as S. Paul Romans 13. 1.
also treats of it.

17 I love them that love me: and they that seek me early, shall find me. 18
Riches and honor are with me: even durable riches and righteousness. 19 My
fruit is better then gold, even then fine gold, and my revenues better then
fine silver.
Wisdom not only makes account of the great men of the world, for to cause
them to walk duly in their vocation, and to prosper them: but of what
estate, or condition soever we be, if we delight in wisdom, and that we be
careful to govern ourselves thereafter, we shall not fail to be wise. Solomon
does signify it, when he introduces wisdom, which says, That she loves
them that love her. Notwithstanding we ought not to think that it is in our
liberty or free will to become wise of ourselves, and compel God by his
wisdom to love us, and that we should find him, except that he himself
seek us first, and draw us to him and hold us fast. The which he does,
when he does offer us his word, and we do love it, and seek it early or
diligently, if our delight be in the same. We will then take these words, as
if wisdom did say, when I offer my self by preaching and corrections, and
John. 3. 16. Romans 5. 8. 1. John. 4. 9. 10 Ge. 6. 8. and 12. 1 Exodus 3. 8. Ier.
7. 24. and 25. 3. 4. and. 35. 15.
that I am not despised, then do I make men feel my sweetness and
gentleness, my help and government. Now that we are beloved before that
we do love, it is certain, and also that we be sought for, and drawn: the
grace that Noe found, does show it us, and the departure of Abraham, and the
deliverance of the chilof Israel out of the land of Egypt, etc. And when God
says by his Prophets, that he rose up early and sent his servants the
Prophets: And when Jesus Christ says, The son of man is come to save that
which is lost, etc. When then we shall love wisdom, let us know that it is
because she loves us, and when we shall find her, it is because Mat. 18. 11.
she draws us, making us diligent to seek her. We ought not to fear that
we should labor in vain, and loose our pain for to love wisdom, and to
seek the same: for she loves not in words, but in truth: and they which
seek her, do not find her unprovided. Solomon does show it, saying,

18 Riches and honor, etc. Whereupon follows also, that they which find
her, return not back empty. For since that wisdom does love them, she
cannot leave the^ comfortless, but does participate of al her riches unto
them, so far as is expedient: for also that which she possesses, she only
holds to bestow upon her friends, and to lift them up to honor and glory.
If then we desire to be rich with the true riches, let us love wisdom, and
seek her betimes in the morning with all diligence: so doing, we shall not be
rich only for one time, but we shall have durable riches. Wherefore Pro. 3. 13.
14.
we may conclude, That blessed is the man that finds wisdom, and the man
that draws knowledge unto him. And also that her merchandise is better then
the merchandise of silver. Such things do waste and are transitory, subject
unto stealing and corruption. These are not then the riches that we must look
for in seeking wisdom, and appliyng thereto our hearts: But we must lay up
our Mat. 16. 17. 33.
treasures in heaven, etc. so doing we shall want no riches: and as our Lord
does give us good witness thereof, when he says, First seek the kingdom of God
and the righteousness thereof, and al other things shall be given unto you: Neither
is it unto the desire of temporal goods that Solomon labors to draw us, when
he speaks of wisdoms riches, he does show it when he says, that wisdom
goes with righteousness: as if he did say, that if we will be partakers of the
riches and honors of wisdom, and of this durable riches, we must aspire unto
righteousness, which we shall attain, if trusting in the goodness of God, we
abhor al hypocrisy and deceit, al injury and violence, and do employ
ourselves to give unto every man his own so far as we can. It is then a good
thing to love wisdom, and for to seek it, yea it is most necessary: for
seeing that these things belong unto her, it follows that they which do
despise and reject the^, must remain in poverty and dishonor, albeit that for
their wealthines they are honored of the world for a very little time: for as
their riches are of no continuance, even so therewith they suddenly fall into
confusion and shame, being destitute of al righteousness, they are placed in
the rank with infidels and ungodly. Al they which shall contemn the word of
God, which is the true wisdom, are in great danger to become very poor and
confounded, except that they convert through true repentance and sound faith,
and become lovers of wisdom, and do seek her betimes in the morning.
Contraly it is said, that she will exhalt them that shall honor her, and that
Pro. 4. 8.
she will embrace them that do glorify her.

19 My fruit is better, etc: For that, that wisdom has said that riches
and honors, etc. she infers most fitly that her fruit is better than
gold, etc. For gold, stones, and silver are Pro. 3. 18
of small continuance, but this that wisdom brings forth, continues for
ever. It is the tree of life, to them that lay hold on her. For to give us a
taste of this fruit and reuenew, Solomon is not contented already to have
showed us this profit and utility, but for to stir us up moreover, he
repeateth the same words, saying, My revenues is better etc. This repetition
is very needeful for to sharpen our appetite: for of our nature we are so out
of taste, that we love better the shadow of thorns and reeds, and to eat of
their sharp and sour fruit; then to rest under the tree of life, and to be
refreshed with her sweet and pleasant fruit: we are more careful of the
goods of this world, then of the word of GOD. Herein we fail very foully,
and therefore are well worthy of great rebuke: for we sooner believe our
sensual appetite, and do more gladly follow the affection of our flesh, then
the wisdom of God, the which does offer herself unto us with all riches and
glory, not as the world, which puffs up and makes them proud, that have
this riches, and does turn them away from the right way for to commit all
unrighteousness, by spoiling al on sides what they can lay hands upon. Wisdom
which does communicate herself unto us by the word, does not so deal with
us: but as she says,

20 I cause to walk in the way of righteousness, in the mids of the paths of
judgment. 21 That I may cause them that love me, to inherit substance, and I
will fill their treasures.
They which love Wisdom and do seek her in the Word, so that they find
her, are partakers of the gifts of the holy Ghost, which is the Spirit of
Wisdom and knowledge, etc. Thus he guides Esai. 2. 11.
the lovers of Wisdom in such sort, that the riches wherewith Wisdom does
bless them, do serve to no other purpose then to lead them unto al holiness
and innocence, that being ascerteined of the goodness of God toward them,
they should love and fear her, in such wise that they should be such toward
their neighbors, as they know that God is toward the^, that is to say, that
they should do no wrong, nor injury unto any man, but should be ready to
serve every man in true brotherly charity, yelding to al men the duty
according to their office: so doing they shall walk in the path of
righteousness, the which requires that we should assure ourselves in God by
Jesus Christ, and that by his fear and reverence we should love our
neighbors, so that we should do wrong to none, but yield to every man that
which belongs unto him. If we be lovers of Wisdom, she makes us such, and
therewith she makes us to walk in the midst of the paths of judgment: that is
to say, that she causes us to become so gentle, and full of succor, that we
can not abide any to do wrong to our neighbors, but will deliver them so much
as we can. In this sense, must we take justice and judgment, wherewith we
must be armed, and also so much as lies in us, to arm others that are under
our charge, as it is said of Abraham, I know that he will command his
children, and his family Genesis 18. 19.
after him, that they keep the way of the Lord to do righteousness and
judgment. If we do and teach so, we shall not want: for this, that Wisdom
so makes them which love her, to walk, is, as she says,

21 That I may cause them, etc. This is no temporal possession: for the riches
of this world do not fill the treasures. The more a man has, the more he
desires, so that they do not satisfy and fill. The worldlinges then do
think that their treasures are never full enough. This substance which is
spoken of here, is eternal. Solomon does show it by this word to inherit.
For as a father leaves the heritage to his children, for to pass from one to
another, from kindred to kindred, and cannot be voided thereof, but by evil
government of their side, or of the violence of men: even so the heavenly
heretage can not be taken a way from the children of wisdom, but shall
eternally possess her: and in this sort their treasures shall be filled. Herein
we may and ought to understand, that we have nothing, except God give it us by
his wisdom, and that without it we are never contented. And seeing there is
none of us but desires to have and to fill his treasures, we ought well to love
wisdom. It is she only which gives the heritage, and which fills to the
brimme.

22 The Lord has possessed me in the beginning of his way: I was before his
works of old. 23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, and
before the earth. 24 When there was no depthes, was I begotten, when there were
no fountains, abounding with water. 25 Before the mountains were settled: and
before the hills, was I begotten. 26 He had not yet made the earth, nor the open
places, nor the height of the dust in the world. 27 When he prepared the
heavens, I was there: when he set the compass upon the deep, 28 When he
established the clouds above, when he confirmed the fountains of the deep,
29 When he gave his decree to the sea, that the waters should not pass his
commandments: when he appointed the foundations of the earth, 30 Then was I
with him as a nourisher: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before
him, 31 And took my solace in the compass of his earth: and my delight is
with the children of men.
To the end that we should not think that wisdom, which has so much
extolled herself from the beginning of this Chapter, should not be such as
she has declared of herself, and that it is not an imagination framed in the
brain of man, that he has yielded of his own goodness, Solomon does
describe her eternal power: and therefore he says, The Lord has possessed
wisdom in the beginning of his way. Wherein he gives us to understand, that
God has never purposed any thing, and that he has never ordained any thing in
his eternal decree without wisdom: that is to say, that this wisdom was
already, before that God had put in execution any of his purposes, and
ordinances: as it was right necessary: for it follows well, that if it was in
the beginning of the way of the Lord, that it was before al things,
consequently, that it is no creature which has taken his essence with the
things created. Whereof we must conclude that his being is eternal, and likewise
his power. And forasmuch as there is no eternal being, nor eternal power, but
only in God: it follows therefore, that this wisdom is in God, and that it
is nothing distincted nor separated from God, and consequently, that the same
is God: yet least we should confound the persons which are in God, we must
believe and confess, that in so much as God is Father, that his Wisdom which
is his eternal Son and his Word, is distinct from his fatherhood. That this
wisdom is the eternal Word, and the Son of God, Saint John does show in his
Gospel, when he does attribute unto the Word, that which Solomon does
attribute here unto Wisdom: that is to wit, when he says, In the beginning
was the Word. When then it is said, The Lord has possessed me, let us know
that it is the Son Ioh. 1. 1.
of God which speaks. And so, when we have said, that our wisdom is in the
only Word of God. We have not meant that it is in the word that sounds in
our corporal ears, but in the same that so penetrateth our hearts and minds,
that we are made new creatures. Nevertheless the outward preaching is not
unfruitful, but profitable and necessary: for it is the means and instrument
wherewith God is served to make the lively word to pearce into us: and for
this cause S. Paul douteth not to say (when he speaks of preaching) that
the Gospel is the power of GOD to salvation to every one that believes.
Again, Faith comes by hearing, Romans 1. 16. and 17,
and hearing by the word of God. If then we despise preaching, we do not
despise men, but the Son of God: we refuse our salvation, and make post have
unto our damnation: we skorne at the wisdom of GOD, and rejoice in folly. Thus
doing, we walk; clean contrary to that we should, yea against nature, the
which teaches us to honor our elders. And since the Lord has possessed, etc.
Wisdom is very ancient. Wherefore we must honor it when she offers
herself unto us by the mouth of her Ministers.

23 I was set up from everlasting. For to declare the eternity of Wisdom
more largely and more particularly, Solomon brings her in, saying, that she
has been set up. Now the word which he uses, has in his tongue diverse
significations, it signifies to ordeine, it signifies also to be king, and to
bear the chief rule. These two significations agree very well with the
wisdom of God: but we must take heed that we imagine not, that as Kings and
Princes do ordeine Governors in their provinces, which are their subjects and
inferiors, that in this manner God has ordained wisdom over his works, as
his inferior. For wisdom is equal unto God, seeing it is of the same
essence with him, and that in God there is neither superior nor inferior,
neither higher nor lower: but there is an equality exempte from al difference
and diversity. Therefore when wisdom says, that she has been set up, or
that she has had the kingdom or the principality, let us understand none
other thing, but that God has decreed and ordained al things by his wisdom,
and thereby has made and ordered al his works, and thereby reigns and rules
over all the world. And when she says, from everlasting; and from the
beginning, we must not devise that wisdom began from the beginning, we must
not devise that wisdom began to be set up and to bear rule. For seeing, that
as it is said, in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc, And
wisdom has been set up before the earth, we must understand that from
everlasting, and from the beginning, and before all worlds, and before any
beginning, that is to say: from everlasting, and before al things. For as the
divine wisdom had no beginning of essence, so also it began not to be
ordained and to bear rule. And forasmuch as wisdom has been eternally set
up in the counsel of God, she may well say, I have counsel, etc. And seeing that
her government is eternal, she may well say, That by me Kings reign, etc.
Furthermore, they that despise the preaching of the Word, by the which wisdom
does offer herself for to do that whereunto she has been ordained, do
enterprise an impossible thing, to wit, to break the ordinance of God, and
therein they show their foolishnes and arrogancy, rising up against an
eternal government, whereunto they ought to do homage, that they may obtain
true and strong being, and finally to reign with Wisdom for ever. They show
also their ingratitude, not acknowledging that al riches proceed from
wisdom, and that without it nothing can stand. They are then greatly out of
their wits: for by contemning the Word, so much as in them lies, they make
wisdom vain, and seek the destruction of the world, which can not stand
without theirs. Contrarily, they that have a reverence unto this Word, so much
as in them is, do maintain the ordinance and establish the government of
wisdom: and as they desire that she should reign and rule, so much as they
can help, they do make her to reign: also they can not perish, for wisdom
loves them, and opens herself unto them. Wherefore it is a sure thing that
they shall be partakers of this eternal government. These things are past the
reach of man's wit, and therefore the worldly wise, can not comprehend them,
there is nothing but Faith that can understand the^.

24 When there were no depthes. etc. For to proceed in showing the eternity of
wisdom, he says, that she was begotten before that the deepes were, etc.
Wherein he seems that he speaks against that which he has said here
before, and that in willing to show the eternal being of wisdom, he shows
that she has not been always: for she says, that she has been
begotten: and by this it seems, that there has been a certain time wherein
she was not, and that he which begatte her, was before her. This argument
might have place in carnal generation: but here is a divine generation spoken
of, the which hinders not that, which is begotten to be eternal. Also the
Father has not begun to beget his wisdom, but has begotten it eternally.
The wise worldlings which would understand and know al things by natural
reason, or by experience, will deride the same, because they can comprehend
nothing: but we consider it by Faith. And for to do this well, let us know
that amongst the properties and persons which are in God, which is one, there
is such distinction, that to the Father we attribute the beginning of working
and creating, we hold him for the fountain and spring of al things. To the
Son, we attribute wisdom, counsel, and the government of things that are
made. To the holy Ghost, we attribute the power and efficacy of working and
executing. And albeit, that the eternity of the Father, is also the eternity
of the Son and of the holy Ghost: (for God could never be without his
wisdom and power: and in the eternity, there ought neither first nor last to
be sought) yet is it not a vain thing nor superfluous to observe this order
in the eternity, to wit, that we set the Father first in order, and in the
second place, the Son which comes of him: and in the third place, the holy
Ghost which proceeds from them both. For also the mind of every one
inclines to consider first God, afterward his wisdom which springs from
him, and finally his power, whereby he executes the decrees and ordinances of
his counsel. By this reason we say that the Son comes only of the Father,
but that the holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son together. Albeit then
that we can not consider the wisdom of God, but as it proceeds from the
Father, and as it is engendered of him, yet we must take heed that in this
generation we invent nothing temporal, carnal, or humane: but rather let us
worship this generation, beholding it by Faith, and let us take heed from
searching further then Scriptures do teach us thereof: otherwise we should
deserve to be blinded, and punished for our over great curiosity. The
generation then of wisdom will not forbid us to believe his eternity. For
well to inculcate the same unto us, Solomon stands long to prefer wisdom
before things visible, whereof man himself does not comprehend the
beginning, but do seem unto him that they are from everlasting: but by Faith
we understand that the worlds were made by the word of God. For the
invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, are seen by
the Hebr. 11. 3. R^m. 1. 20.
creation of the world, etc. And for to beat into us this eternity, he is
not content briefly to say, that wisdom was begotten before the earth, but he
names the deepes (which are the deep waters) the fountains. He recites
every thing particularly, to the end that in the least things of the world,
we might learn to know the wisdom of God: and also seeing it is first, let
us contemn these earthly things, if they do hinder us to aspire after
wisdom. For although they be creatures of God, and that very good, yet are
they nothing, if we compare them unto wisdom.

Moreover, when situation and places are spoken of, we ought to understand that
God in the creation of the world, has set al things in good order by wisdom,
and has set every thing in his place, and that the insensible things do
keep still their situations and places: but the devils and men are so miserable
and unreasonable, that they have very quickly left their place, and are fallen
into extreme confusion: out of the which men can not rise again, except that
wisdom does communicate herself unto them.

27 When he prepared, etc. After that Solomon has showed the eternity of
wisdom, because it went before the inferior earthly, and watery creatures, he
proceeds to prove this eternity, because that it was before the heavens,
and before the ordering of the superior waters, and before the sea had his
marks set, and that the earth was fully settled. And when the scripture shows
us, that God has said, Let light be made, etc. By the word of the Lord were
the heavens made: we must understand that the preparation, the constitution,
the compass, establishment, fortification and ordinance, whereof here is
mention made, is nothing but his wisdom and eternal Word, the which also as
it is here told, Genesis 1. 3. Psalm. 33. 6.
was with God, when he ordered and ordained his creatures. Furthermore, when we
read these things, we ought not only to think upon the eternity of wisdom,
but also upon the goodness and mercy of God, wherewith he was moved toward
men, when he made and ordered al these things: for he prepared them for the
use of men. The which he has well showed, when he made us Lords of all the
world.

Then was I with him. After that wisdom has said, that she was then there
with God, when he prepared, etc. she shows that she was not idle, but that
she wrought with him, not as inferior, but as an equal fellow: for she says
not that she was under him, but with him: not that she was an ha^dmaid, or
servant, or appre^tice, but as a nourisher or mistress of work. Wherein Solomon
does show us the eternal power and divinity of the son of God. The which S.
John shows, She was in the beginning, etc. Our Lord himself Ioh. 1. 2. and
5. 17.
also does show it, saying, My Father works hitherto, and I work. And to
show that she was so good a work mistress that there was no work too
hard for her, and also that she was not grieved with his work, but that she
delighted in the same, she says, And I was daily his delight. Now look what
she wrought in the time of the creation and ordering of the world, she does
yet still, as we may see, when she says, rejoicing always before him. We may
also say that the Father has taken pleasure in that which he has wrought by
his Son from the beginning, and yet still at this present does delight in his
works, as in a most pleasant recreation: but although that this sentence be
true, and that it may be grounded upon the saying of our Lord, I do always
those things Ioh. 8. 29.
that please him: yet the first sense is the most agreeable to the line of
Solomon's text. Likewise the manner of a master workman (which is very
cunning in his art,) is to take pleasure in his work, and to do his work so
easily and so handsomely, that it seems he works not, but plays and
passes a way the time joyfully. And after this sense we may gather hereof,
that the goodness and grace of the Lord was bent from the beginning toward
men: for they had not deserved that Wisdom should delight to do her work
for their use: for even without it, they had not been. But although that man
through pride and unthankfulness had deserved to be rejected of wisdom, and
to be abhorred and detested of him yet for all that, she has not left of from
her work, or ceased from the same upon the earth, which is given unto man for
his habitation and nourishment. This continuation is showed us, when he says,

31 And took my solace, etc. The great and wonderful mercy of our Lord God,
is here set forth unto us, when he cease not to take pleasure in mainteining
man on the earth, seeing that by his sin, and also by continuance thereof from
Father to Son, he had deserved, and still daily does deserve that the earth
should sink, and not to bear him any longer, but that he should miserably
perish, and go to eternal damnation. Now how wisdom has continued and
still does continue to solace herself about the earth (which Solomon most
fitly calls the earth of God: for he says not simply, in the compass of
the earth, but in the compass of his earth for also it is his, and the
contents thereof, seeing he has created al things) how is it I say, that
she takes her pleasure, Gene. 1. 1. Psalm. 24. 1. and 50. 12.
etc. The scripture does teach us how: When she is filled with so many
loving promises, aduertisements, exhortations, corrections, and threatenings.
Immediately after the fall of Adam, wisdom began this solace, and continued the
same unto Seth, Enoch, Noe, Abraham, to the Patriarchs, to Moses and to the
Prophets. But this solace was yet more plainly known when this wisdom
(which is the eternal word,) was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and that
John. 1. 14. Luke. 15. 14.
in his doctrine and miracles men beheld his glory, etc. This is the
shepherd that seeks his strayed sheep, etc. This joy and solace
contineweth still as we see it, when in spite of Satan and al his mainteiners
and ministers, the Gospel is purely preached, and that we have the Sacraments
whole and in their perfection, and that the Lord has established amongst us
the form of a true Church. Herein we know what wisdoms sport is, which
shall be deerly sold unto the unthankful, to whom God has sent his Gospel,
without being bannished, or having forsaken their country or goods to be
partakers of this solace. The Lord has already begun to punish this
ingratitude and contempt in some places: It is a sure thing that he will
finishe his work in time convenient, and then scorners and contemners shall
feel it.

Furthermore, seeing the Ministers of the word are the instruments of
wisdom, they learn here that they ought not to esteem their ministry as a
burden and painful thing, but as a joyful and comfortable matter, and so much
as they possibly can, they should solace themselves every where with their
brethren: Mat. 28. 19. Mark. 16. 15
I say, so much as they can, for they ought to exceed their vocation.

32 Therefore now harken, O children, unto me: for blessed are they that keep
my ways. 33 Hear instruction, and be ye wise, and refuse it not: blessed is
the man that hears me, watching daily at my gaies, and giving attendance at
the posts of my doors. 34 For he that finds me, finds life, and shall
obtain favor of the Lord: 35 But he that sins against me, hurts his
own soul: and all that hate me, love death.
When wisdom has declared what manner of one she is, to whom she
belongs, what riches she has, and how ancient she is, she concludes
that we must hear her, if we will do and follow what she commands, and
teaches, promising felicity to those that shall follow her government, and
suffer themselves to be ruled by her. Now she calls her children to hear.
Wherein we are taught to be assured, that if we hearken unto the Euangelical
word, which is the voice of the great Pastor, who is our wisdom, we are
children of wisdom, and the sheep of Jesus Christ, and are of God.
Contrarily, they that despise this word, John. 8. 47. and. 10. 27.
are children of folly and of the Devil. As then wisdom does sport
herself, and pass her time, and takes her solace with us in speaking unto us
by her ministers, and calls us her children: even so al our joy and delight
ought to be in hearing this voice: and that without any delay, without putting
of til to morrow: for she will presently be heard. And as without delay we
must hear, so must we also persevere to hear, even as wisdom does daily
continewe speaking unto her children: for so long as she speaks, it is
always to day, and shall last unto the last day. In looking for the which, as
wisdom does call us, so if we yield, she does accept and hear us to give
us salvation. But we must mark well that 2. Cor. 6. 2.
wisdom says not generally, hearken: as if it were laweful to lend our
ears unto doctrines and traditions of men (for it has been ever forbidden)
But wisdom says, hear me, declaring unto us that it is she only that
must be heard: whereof follows that this wisdom is the Son of GOD, of
whom it is said, This is my well beloved Son in whom I have taken Math. 17.
5.
my delight, hear him. Whom now if we will hear, we must hear his
ministers which do preach unto us his pure word. And for to hear them as we
ought, and as wisdom demands, it is not enough to hearken unto the
doctrine, but the heart also is required theretoo, that out of that affection
thereof we might rule our life in all holiness and honesty, in all justice and
innocence. We ought so to understand it, when for to entice us to hear, it is
not said, that blessed are they which hear: but which keep the ways of
wisdom. Our Lord also, who is the true wisdom, is not contented only to
be heard.

33 Hear instruction, etc. Because we are not only negligent to go whether
wisdom calls us, but also it is irksome to hear it, and in this wise we
seek our destruction and damnation: for this cause wisdom takes pity of
us, and desiring our joy and salvation, does again admonish us to hear
instruction: and herein she shows that it is she which speaks, when we
are exhorted and admonished, when we are corrected and reproved by the word.
And for to show us to what end tends instruction, she adds, and be
wise. And thus, without instruction we are without wisdom, and but fools.
Wherefore, forasmuch as we cannot abide to be counted fools, but desire that
men should esteem us wise, let us follow and embrace instruction, and not put
her back, as wisdom does admonish us: otherwise she will refuse us.
Contrarily, it is said, Blessed is the man, etc. When we have to do with any
great Lord, we never cease to keep watch and ward at his gate, and to look
when he should come forth, or that he will call us unto him that tarry and
wait for him. So great desire have we to come to the end of that which we
desire, that we continue still looking. And if in worldly things we have such
perseverance: by a more strong reason we ought to be very watchful after
wisdom, and follow her counsel and commandementes in much constancy and
perseverance, and never to cease, seeing that we have always need of her: as
she does well signify, when she would have us always to watch at her gates,
and to keep the posts of her house. Wherein again we learn, that it is not
enough for us to hear, but it behooves us also to be led with an earnest
affection to understand what belongs to wisdom, and to follow it: not for any
little time of our life, but continually, whiles we are in this world. If we
do thus, assuring ourselves of the goodness of GOD toward us, we shall not be
void of wisdom: for by asking it in true faith, it shall be given us. Being
thus endued with wisdom. Mat. 7. 7. Ia. 1. 5.
though we were the most miserable and cursed of all the World, after the
sense of the flesh, and outward appearance, we shall never perish.

34 For he that finds me, etc. As S. Paul says, The gifts and callings of
God are without repentance. Whereof follows that this life which comes of
wisdom, is prolonged more and Romans 11. 29.
more: and that this favor is not withdrawn, but rather increases. For unto
every one that has, shall be given, and he shall abou^de. And seeing that by
wisdom we have these riches, that is to say Mat. 25. 29.
life, and the favor from whence life proceeds, it follows well that by our
works we do not deserve that God should favor us and hold us in his
grace: otherwise it should be no grace not favor, but recompense and reward
that God did owe us. Neither also do we deserve life, seeing it comes of
favor. Now that life comes of favor, the creation of man does witness
it: for he had not deserved that God should place him in the world. We have
yet a more manifest witness after the fall of man. For albeeit he had deserved
death, as God had threatened him, yet in steed Genesis 2* 17.
of eternal death as he had deserved, he receives promise of life. And since
it is by promise, it comes not by works, otherwise the promise should be
abolished. Seeing also that of wisdom we have life and favor, it follows
that wisdom is not a quality gotten by the industry and labor of men, but
it comes from the Son of God, by whom we have life and favor. The law
was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. As Moses lifted
up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must also the son John. 1. 17. and ^.
14. and 11. 25.
of man be lifted up: That whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but
have eternal life. I am the resurrection and the life says the Lord, etc. Now
seeing that by finding wisdom, we obtein such riches, we ought to be very
careful to seek it, and to seek her in truth, and not as the Hipocrytes,
unto whom it is said, What have I to do with the multitudes of your
sacrifices? (says the Lord.) etc. We must seek it by faith and repentance.
Esaias. 1. 11. and 55. 6. Mat. 7. 7.


Seek the Lord whiles he may be found: call upon him whiles he is nigh. Thus
doing, we shall find and obtain that which we seek for. Ask and ye shall
have, etc. If then we will find wisdom, and thereby obtain life and favor
toward God, we must renounce the evil that displeases wisdom, taking heed
that we do not offend her, and do nothing, by hatred against her. In this
manner we shall find grace before the Lord, whereby we shall preserve our souls
from death.

35 But he that sins, etc. We may infer this same of that which has bin
attributed heretofore to wisdom and to her children. For it follows, that
he which seeks wisdom reverently and with such love as he ought, and
finds her, he finds favor and life: and that they which desire wisdom,
and do not vouchsafe to seek her, and so do offend and hate her, that they
seek death, as a thing of them beloved and desired. And so they do great wrong
unto their souls, for they do altogether destroy them. And since also that
Solomon sets to offend, against to find, we ought to understand that they
which despise the word, whereby wisdom does offer herself unto us, to the
end that we might find her, and do skorne her, and refuse her, and offend
wisdom, and sin against her: and since that wisdom has so much and so
great riches (as it has bin said) whereof without her we cannot be partakers,
it follows that they which offend her, do wittingly deprive themselves, and
so do wrong to their souls, depryuing them of great riches, without the
which we cannot but look for all misery. And when in opposition of drawing
favor, he sets hate: he shows us that the contemners of the grace of God
do hate wisdom, and consequently their life: and seeing there is no mean
way between life and death, it is necessary, that if they hate wisdom (the
which only gives life) that they love death. Wherein, we may know that they
are out of their wits, and that they have not so much understanding as brute
beasts, the which can tell to fly from that which hurts them, and to desire
and seek that which is profitable for their life.

The nienth Chapter.
1 Wisdom has built her house, and heawen out her seven pillars. 2 She has
killed her victuals, drawn her wine, and prepared her table. 3 She has sent
forth maidens, and cries upon the highest places of the City saying, 4 Who
so is simple let him come hither: and to him that is destitute of wisdom, she
says, 5 Come and eat of my meat, and drink of the wine that I have drawn.
ALbeit that a great and mighty king of this world has many Castells,
Towns, Cities and Provinces under his power, and that he may abide and dwell
where it pleases him: yet will he build or choose some certain place, the
which he will call his, because he will take there his most delight, and will
dwell there about more commonly then in any other place of his country. Even
so, although the jurisdiction of wisdom stretches far, and that all the
world do appertain unto her, and that she fills both heaven and earth:
notwithstanding she has built her an house, the which she calls hers,
because she has built the same for to dwell, and therein to take her sport
and pastime, and to maintain the same that it perish not, nor go to decay. And
since that wisdom has an house, wherein she keeps her continual and daily
residence, if we will find her, we must seek for her at her house: there will
she offer her self unto us, and bestow her riches upon us, so much as shall be
expedient. But to find this house, we must know where it is builded, and of
what matter, and how it is placed. First of al, although that here we hear
spoken of a house and of buylding, yet must we not ymagine any thing that is
earthly or carnal. For wisdom is not like unto the Princes of this world,
who as they are earthly, so do they build their houses on earth, and of
earthly matter, and do set and grounsel them upon like matter. Wisdom is
divine, heavenly and spiritual. Likewise her house stands in heaven, about
the throne of GOD: there she has laid the foundation on herself. If then
we will find wisdom, Heb. 13. 14.
we must aspire unto heaven. For also here we have no continuing City: but
we seek one to come: And therefore our conversation should be in heaven, so
that we should not walk after the flesh, but after the spirit. If we thus
look up to heaven, this house of wisdom is made ours, not by merit, but
because GOD has prepared it for us, if we follow the faith of the holy
patriarchs, of whom it is written, They al dyed according to faith, etc. And
therefore we may say with S. Paul, For we know that if our earthly house of
this tabernacle be destroyed, Heb. 11. 13. 2. Cor. 5. 1.
we have a building given of God, that is, a house not made with hands, but
eternal in heaven. Now we must understand that as the foundation is spiritual
and heavenly, even so is the building thereupon, whereof one part is of the
Angels which kept still their first state, and have not forsaken their dwelling,
nor country: for if they had not been grounded on this foundation, they could
not, nor had been able to have standfast. Saint Paul does well signify it,
when he says, that the Father in the dispensation of the fulness of times Ephe.
1. 10. 2^
might gather together in one al things both which are in heaven and which are
in earth, even in Christ, etc. He is also the head of the Angels, as
immediately thereafter he shows, saying, that the father has set him at his
right hand in the heavenly places, etc. He Col. 1. 15.
is the first borne of every creature. For by him were al things created. The
Angels then are a part of wisedoms family. The other part of this house, are
the elect and faithful called unto the knowledge of the Gospel, and regenerate
by the holy Ghost. Our Lord does so signify it, when he says, If any man
love me, he will keep John. 14. 23. 1. Cor. 3. 16. 2. Cor. 6. 16.
my word: and S. Paul says, Know ye not that ye are the temple of GOD? and,
Ye are the Temple of the living GOD. But some will say, that if the elect are
the habitation, of wisdom, that this house is distinguished, and that it is
not all spiritual and heavenly: for men, though they be elected, are earthly
and carnal. The complaint of Saint Paul does well show it: so does also the
battle between the flesh and the spirit. I answer, that man in so Romans 7.
14. Gala. 5. 17. John. 3. 6.
much as he is borne of the flesh, is fleshly and does the works of the
flesh: and so is not of the house of wisdom, and cannot possess the
kingdom of God. But inasmuch as he is regenerate by the spirit, and walks
according theretoo, and not after the flesh, he is spiritual, and so is of
the house of wisdom, and belongs unto the kingdom of GOD. Saint Paul
does so give us to understand it, when for to give the reason wherefore he
calls the faithful the temple of GOD, he says, The spirit of GOD dwells
in you, know ye not that 1. Cor. 3. 16. and 6. 19.
your bodies are the temples of the holy Ghost? To the end then that we may
be the spiritual house of wisdom, we must be renewed, that we may put of
our old man, mortifying our earthly members. Saint Peter also does show it,
saying, Laying aside al maliciousness and all guyle, and dissimulation, and
envy, Col. 3. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 1.
and all evil speaking, as new borne babes desire the sincere milk of the
word, etc. In this manner we are fellows unto the Angels. You are come to
the company of innumerable Angels. And the Angel says, I am thy fellow
servant and one of Heb. 12. 22. Apo. 19. 10. Heb. 1. 14.
thy brethren, which have the testimony of Jesus Christ. It is no wonder
thereof, seeing they are our ministers. Now as touching we have companions
and ministers so pure, we must also study to be pure and clean, that the
house of wisdom may be pure and clean. For to find wisdom then, it is not
needeful for us to run hither and thither, but only to cleanse ourselves. Thus
doing, though we remain on earth, our conversation shall be in heaven. ^.
Cor. 7. 1. Philip. 3. 20.
Whereupon follows that our earthly mansion does not hinder but that the
house of wisdom should be heavenly. For to show how and whereon this house
is set, he says, that wisdom has heawen out her seven pillars, that is to
say, many: for the number of seven is taken for a great number uncertain. Also
we know not the number of the pillars that wisdom has made and ordered since
the creation of the world to this present, and shall make and ordeine until the
last day for to maintain, sustain and repair his house. We know well there
has bin and shall be more then seven: but how many more, we know not. For it
lies not in us to number the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors, and Doctors that wisdom has placed and will place in her
house, which is the Church and household of God. Those are called pillars of the
house and buylding of wisdom, because that through their holy conversation
and pure doctrine of truth, by supplications, prayers, thanks giving, by
warnings and corrections, by exhortations and reprehentions: to be short, by
the ministry wherein God has set them, they have borne up, do bear up, and
shalbeare up unto the worlds end this house of wisdom. Not that wisdom, which
is the true foundation, is not able and strong enough for to uphold it, when
also she vpholdeth the pillars with all the rest: but it so pleases him to
honor men, using their ministry without the which she could work well enough,
upholding and mainteining her house of her own self, yea al things in heaven
and earth: but bearing with our rudenes, and applying herself unto our small
capacity, she opens herself unto us, she vpholdeth and keeps us in
holiness, righteousness, and truth by the means of our brethren like unto us.
Otherwise we should be confounded with his great glory and majesty. That by
the Pillars the Pastors are signified, is showed us in Jeremy, I have made
thee a defensed City, and an iron pillar, and Iere. 1. 18. Gal. 2. 9.
walls of brass against the whole Land. And in Saint Paul, And when James,
and Cephas, and John knew of the grace that was given unto me, which are
counted to be pillars. But when the ministers of the Church have this title
of pillars, they ought thereby to learn diverse things. First of all that they
ought not to exempt themselves from charge and care, nor fly labor and
travel, but ought to sustain and bear the Church of God as upon their
shoulders, and should not be like the Pope which does oppress it, and does
devour the same, as a ranening woolfe with his like, as it is written, They
bind burdens, etc. Secondly, that they Mat. 23. ^. Heb. ^. 4.
ought not to thrust in themselves. Thirdly that they cannot by their industry
and labor attain unto this honor, but wisdom must heawe them out. The
which she does, when she does open herself unto them by the word, and that
she calls them to this office, making them fit theretoo. A man can receive
nothing, except it be given him from heaven. And not that we are sufficient
of John. 3. 27. 2. Cor. 3. 5.
ourselves to think any thing, as of ourselves. Our Lord also does well show
it, when he says unto his disciples, Truly the harvest is great, but the
laborers are few. He declares the same also, Mat. 9. 37. Luke. 24. 45.
when he opened the understanding to his disciples for to understand the
scriptures. Albeeit then that the ministers of the word are the pillars of the
Church, yet have they nothing whereon to glory. For who separateth thee? And
what have thou that thou have not received? And, what is Paul then? and what
is Apollo, but servants, 1. Cor. 4. 7.
by whom ye have believed? But because they acknowledge themselves to be
pillars, they have cause to humble themselves, seeing they could not prepare
nor place themselves where they are, and should be void of power and might,
they could uphold nothing, except the foundation did bear them and uphold
them, and that they did not bear and hold up the whole building and house.
Then there is nothing of theirs, but altogether of the foundation. S. Paul
does well show it, saying, By the grace of God I am that I 1. Cor. 15. 10.
am. By this we may know that the Pope and his mainteiners are in no wise
pillars of the house of wisdom, but are rather engines and instruments,
beetels and hammers, for to destroy and overthrow, if they could by any
means: but the word is infallible true, Upon this stone will I build my
Church. Forasmuch as the Church is builded upon the rock, which is Christ,
whereof the Ministers Mat. 16. 18.
are a portion: it follows that this which we have said, is true, that is to
say, that the foundation bears up the pillars, and that they uphold not the
house of wisdom, but so far as the foundation does maintain them. Of al these
foresaid things follows, that albeit a minister be very diligent to exercise
his office, and that he mightily go forewarde therein with constantnesse, yet
can he deserve nothing, but rather is thereby more bound unto GOD. The friars
then are very proud and arrogant, when by their trifles they think to merit,
not only for themselves, but also for their benefactours. Also this follows,
that they which rebel and do contemn the Ministers of the Church, do seek
their own decay and destruction, for they do separate themselves from the
foundation and the pillars.

2 She has killed her victual, etc. We do prove that there is nothing more
delectable unto man then to have enough to eat and to drink, and to find a
table ready dressed. Al other delights of the world are nothing, except we
have to fill our bellies: we cannot suffer to be deceived, so that to give order
that the belly may be filled, we will apply ourselves to any thing that we can:
and we think well of that house, where the table is dressed for all comers,
that they may eat and drink their fill. And therefore Solomon accommodating
himself unto our ignorance, willing to entice us to desire the house and table
of wisdom, says that she has killed her victual, and drawn her wine,
etc. Wherein after a sort he compares wisdom unto the great Lords of
this world. For as for to show their magnificence, and to have a great
train, they keep open house for all men, and their table well furnished, and
desire that al should be merry and make good cheer, that men might praise
them for their liberality: even so Wisdom having a house well furnished, is
far unlike unto the niggardes and covetous, who the more rich they are, the
more loath are they to touch the same, lest they should diminishe them: they
dare not use nor spend them, so much the less would they spend them
liberally amongst others: which is a very great discommoditie. Wisdom, I
say is not like such niggardes: but as she has abundance of victual, so she
is not grieved, though al eat thereof: she spares not the meats and drinks
that are in her house, but for to give meat and drink, she kills her
victual, and draws her wine, and fills the glasses and cups to give unto
all that desire to taste thereof: they that resort to the house of wisdom do find
the table thoroughly furnished. The gluttons and dronkardes, the swil bowls and
slugge bellies, have no part at this table, neither can delight therein: for
there is nothing that likes the^, seeing they ask nothing but that which
pleases the flesh: and so at this table al things thereon are spirirual. For as
wisdom with her house is spiritual, eue^ so she has nothing, nor does nothing,
but is altogether spiritual. The belly and the teeth serve nothing theretoo, it
is our hearts, souls, and our minds, that we must give and apply theretoo.
Solomon willing to describe the felicity of the kingdom of GOD, and the
delights Mat. ^2. 4.
and pleasures thereof, does speak unto us figuratively. The victual killed,
then the drawing of the wine, and the table prepared, is nothing but the
preaching of the word, and the administration of the Sacraments, that is to
say, of baptism, and of the supper, which are the meats and drinks to
preserve us from hunger and thirst. For man lives not only by bread, but by
every Deuteronomy. 8. 3.
word that proceeds out of the mouth of GOD. And forasmuch as it is so that
there is nothing that we desire more than life, we should fix al our joy,
al our delights and pleasures in the victual, wine and table of wisdom: in
this manner we should have no care over our bellies, but we would aspire unto
the kingdom of God, wherein we shall have full possession of this table, whereof
at this present we do taste, when we savor this word, and that for to
have more taste we communicate at the Sacraments. The which things are truly
compared unto the killing of victual, etc. For as the household folks of a
place do not eat quick flesh, and do not drink the wine with the
Hoggeshead, neither sit down at the table, except it be covered: even so the
household people of Wisdom do not take taste at this word and Sacraments,
except they be communicated and broken unto them particularly, as we do
feed our bodies: for also it behooves that they grow and increase by little
and little, as therefore from day to day this meat and drink are bestowed upon
them. And albeeit that it is by the ministry of men, yet are they nothing,
neither ought we to attribute any thing unto them, but al unto wisdom, as
Solomon does well signify it, saying, that she has killed, filled and made
ready her table. If then by the service of men we are fed with the word,
and communicate at the Sacraments, all the praise thereof is due only unto the
Son of God, who is the true divine wisdom: and yet we may not despise men,
that he sends unto us, except that we will despise him himself, and chiefly
when they apply themselves faithfully to do that which is enjoined them. And
albeeit Solomon compares here the delights of the word and the Sacraments
unto victual and wine, and that there is an infinite distance between the one
and the other (for the victual and the wine do but serve the body for a little
time, but the word and the Sacraments received in faith and obedience, do
quicken the soul everlastingly, and will raise the body unto the resurrection
of life,) yet the comparison agrees very well. For what operation as has the
victual and wine toward the body, such has the power of the word and
sacraments toward our souls for ever. If this were well printed in our
hearts we should be much more careful to follow the doctrine of our Lord
then we be. I say unto you, be not careful for your life, what ye shall eat,
or what ye shall drink: nor yet for your body what ye shall put Mat. 6. 25,
on? But the clean contrary is put in practice: and therefore we may well
complain of ourselves, or GOD of us, They assemble themselves for corn, and
wine, and they rebel against Hoseas. 7. 14.
me.

3 She has sent forth her maidens, etc. Wisdom is not contented to have
killed, etc. She will have us know what preparation she has made, for she will
not eat her banquet alone, but desires company. Solomon does signify it,
when he says, She sends forth her maidens, that is to say, her damsells
and servants, that by them she may call a multitude of people. She has not
sent them to the caves and dens under the earth, nor into the wilderness
where no man dwells but wild beasts: but to the end that they may be both
heard and seen, and that al might know that the banquet is prepared, she has
sent them forth to cry upon the highest places of the city, etc. These maidens,
damsels, or servants, are the Patriarchs, Prophets Apostles and Pastors of the
church, which as the maidens, and servants of a Lady of honor and Princes, do
stand before her to hear her commandementes, and are ready to execute them,
and to serve and obey her in all things: even so also they yield and become
attentive unto the word of God, which is the word of wisdom, for to obey
and execute that which is committed unto them, and wherewith they are charged,
etc. Amongst other things, their duty and office is to call the bidden Mat.
22. 3. Genesis 6. 14. Heb. 11. 7. 2. Pet. 2. 5. Genesis 17. 23. 24. and. 18. 19.
guestes unto the marriage of the kings Son. Noe was one of the^, that did it,
when he made the arc whereby he condemned the world, and was the herault and
messenger of righteousness. Abraham did it, when dwelling in the Land of Canaan
amongst ydolaters and infidells, he made profession of serving and woorshipping
one only God, and that following the commandment of God, he circumcised
himself, and al them of his household. When also he did according as God gives
witness of him: for I know him he will command his sons and his household
after him, that they keep the way of the Lord Moses did the same in Egypt and
in the wilderness, etc. The other Prophets have done the like, when rising up
early, they have cried and labored by the word of God, to bring men to
repentance and faith. The Apostles also have done the same, when, by following
the ordinance of Christ, That which I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in
light. They went through all the world and Math. 10. 27.
preached, etc. This calling and continual bidding, when the ministers of the
word do daily admonish us, teach, correct, threaten and comfort in the name of
our Lord, and that they cease not to do their office, though they have great
resistance and many gainsayers. Thus doing, they are upon the high towers of
the city, and do call unto wisdom his banquet. They then, which refuse the
preaching, and do persecute the servants of God, do not know what it is truly
to banquet, neither know what are the true delites and pleasures. They care for
their belly which perishes, and forsake and forget their souls, and do
destroy them, when they do forsake the true pasture which quickens
everlastingly, etc. But when it is said, that wisdom has sent her
daughters, there is given us to understand that none ought to intrude himself
to bear the word, Romans 20. 15
except he be sent. Secondly, that if we be sent, it is a certain thing that
we are of the number of the daughters, maidens, and servants of wisdom.
Thirdly, if we be sent, we do bid men unto this table, and cannot hold our
peace: contrarily, if we thrust in ourselves, or that we are sent by men, we
call not, but turn aside from this marriage (as our Lord does reproach the
Mat. 23. 13.
Scribes and Pharisees,) or else we hold our peace, with the Nicodemites,
which in time of persecution are dombe: and in this sort we do not ascend up
into the highest places of the city, but do seek the holes and dens. Then
can it not be said of us, How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
him, that declares Esaias. 52. 7.
and publishes peace? etc. Thus doing, we are ashamed of Christ and of his
word, and therefore he will be ashamed of us Luke. 9. 26.
also.

4 Who so is simple, etc. It is not the custom to go unto the marriage, but
when we are called: If a man enter without calling, he is in danger to be
thrust out again with shame. Therefore they which have any honesty or shame,
will not presume to enter in, except they know to be bidden guestes. Now to
the end that we may know whether we be of the number of the bidden guestes
to wisdoms table, Solomon does show us what kind of people she desires and
commands to be called. He says, she desires that the simple men should
come unto her, and sit at her table, and by and by after she expounds what
these simple ones are, that is to say, they that are without wit. Wherein we
see there is none of us that ought to doubt whether he be called or no unto the
table of wisdom, seeing that of our nature we are al simple and void of
wit. Insomuch as we love vanity, foolishnes and lying better, then
constancy, wisdom and truth: we rather give ourselves unto wickedness, unto
lewdness and vntemperancy, then unto goodness, modesty and sobriety: we are
more ready unto debates and strifes, then unto peace and charity: we rather
follow superstition and idolatry, then true religion and holiness. If then we
consider well what we are, we shall know that we are of the number of those to
whom wisdom says, come, eat, etc. But she does not make us to be called
unto her house and to her table after the manner of princes of the world,
which are given unto vanity, and cares not but to pass the time in
foolishnes: and therefore the foolish desire but to delight themselves with
their folly, and to become more foolish if it be possible. But wisdom has
compassion on our vanity and folly: and therefore makes us to be called unto
her table, that thereat we may hear good talk, and that thereby we might
learn to become wise and prudent. This is the bread and the wine which are
dealt at wisdoms table. Here is no mention of any sumptuous banquet, but only
of bread and wine, that we might learn not to seek by outward appearance, if
we will become wise, but low things vile and abject before the world, and
make ourselves contemptible unto it. For if we be called of God unto this
table, we must consider that which is said, You see your calling, how that not
many wise me^ after the flesh, etc. Wisdom 1. Cor. 1. 26.
also does not call us unto her house and to her table after the manner of the
worldly wise, which would have this reputation, that they cannot in any wise
suffer the simple and fools, and therefore desire to be accompanied with
their like, amongst the which notwithstanding they desire to have the
preferrement and chief place. Wisdom does not refuse the simple, and such
as are destitute of wit, but does call them unto her, not for to maintain them
in their simplicite and ignorance, for that were to lead them unto death, and
to make them perish miserably: but she calls them for to deliver them from
it: for since that she commands us to resort unto her, and there is no folly
nor ignorance in her, neither do they please her, it follows well that if we
resort unto her, we cannot remain in this folly and ignorance, and
consequently we are delivered from death, as she gives well to understand
it, when she offreth bread and wine, not which grew in earthly fields and
vineyardes: for the greatest part of them which eat thereof, are simple and
ignorant, and cease not to dye, but this bread and wine are heavenly, al they
which eat thereof, become wise: for wisdom opening unto us her riches, does
communicate herself unto us, seeing she cannot be separated from her gifts
and graces: and since it is the tree of life: it follows, that whosoever
resorteth unto her, and eats of her bread and drinks of her Pro. 3. 18.
wine, shall not dye, but shall live for ever: It serves also to make the^ wise,
when she calls them to come unto her, and to live, by giving them bread and
wine. Now to attain unto this, she shows what we must do, when she says,

6 Forsake your way, ye foolish, and ye shall live: and walk in the way of
understanding.
Forasmuch as we must forsake the foolish, and not communicate with their
folly, neither consent to their wickedness for to live in the house and at the
table of wisdom, it follows that we must forsake ourselves, resisting
strongly, and fighting against our nature, which is altogether foolish and
wicked: and so, for to live, we must labor to put of the old man, to mortify
our flesh, and not to take any pleasure or delight with the foolish, but to be
careful to reprove them, and to be sorry and grieved for their folly. And this
if we will do, we must not live in ignorance, as do they which follow their
sensuality, and which proceed upon a good intent and fantasy which they
frame without the word of God. Such kind of people are not received into the
house of wisdom to live at her table. Solomon does well signify it, having
promised life, in saying, and live: he adds, And walk, etc. By this word
he teaches us that we shall forsake the company of fools with their
foolishnes, if we be instructed in the pure word of God, and that the same
only be our guide, without declyning from it either on the right hand or left,
without either adding too or diminishing from. After this manner we shall be
received for to live in the house of wisdom, and at her table: And not only
we shall be the stones of Ephe. 2. 19.
the buylding, but also of the household.

7 He that reprooueth a scorner, purchases to himself shame: and he that
rebukes the wicked, gets himself a blotte. 8 Rebuke not a scorner, lest he
hate thee, but rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
Howbeeit that if we will forsake the foolish and their follies, as we ought,
we must be diligent to reprove and correct them (as we have seen that Noe,
Lot, Moses, the Prophets and Apostles have done) so also our Lord has
reproved them, as we may see in the Euangelical history, and has commanded
to reprove them. And Saint Paul says, do not communicate with Mat. 18. 15
Ephe. 5. 10. 1. Timo. 5. 20
the unfruitful works of darkness, but even reprove them rather, Them that
sin rebuke openly, that the rest also may fear: notwithstanding there are
such so froward, and so much past correction that we can win nothing by
reproouing and correcting them, but al dishonestie, and oftentimes we are
esteemed like unto them: for they which are of sinister judgment, and led by
evil affection, will condemn the ministers, judging them to be such as those
with whom they are mingled and cannot attain to bring them to the right way.
Solomon knew it well, and therefore he says as by a complaint, he that
reprooueth a scorner, etc. Not that it is evil of it self, nor that it is
unclean, but the scorner, so much as he can, makes him that reprooueth and
corrects him ashamed, does slander and dishonor him, and woorketh that the
correctour shall be no better esteemed amongst others then he: and thus not only
we loose our time in correcting the scorner, but also we get blame and
disworship: and this is the cause why Solomon says,

8 Rebuke not a scorner, etc. The first part of this sentence agrees with
that which is said, Give not that which is holy, Mat. 7. 6.
to dogs, etc. The scorners, are dogs and swine, to whom we must not give
holy things, nor perles. For as they are profane, given up unto al
filthiness, rooted in all evil, and hardened against al admonition and
advertisement, even so are they unworthy of spiritual things, ordained for
the elect and faithful. The holy and precious things, which God has ordained
unto a pure usage (as the doctrine of salvation, the admonitions,
aduertisements, corrections made by the word and in the name of the Lord)
should be defiled and profaned, if we did give them over unto such wicked
persons.

But some will ask, whether the doctrine of salvation, under the which are
contained the rebukes, is not indifferently appointed Mat. 13. 47. Mark. 16. 15
2. Cor. 2. 15.
as well for the good, as for the evil, seeing that the kingdom of heaven is
compared unto a net cast into the sea, and gathers together of al manner of
fishes, and the Gospel is commanded to be preached unto al creatures: and
Paul says, We are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them which are
saved, and in them that perish, etc. For to answer, we must note that we
cannot discern the dogs from the children of GOD, until that they be tried
by certain experiences, and plain tokens: and also we ought not immediately to
descend unto a grave judgment, that by one experience we should judge any
man to be an hog, and a dog, a scorner, and a desperate wicked one. But
when by great diligence we shall have tried al remedies for to bring such
people to goodness, and shall see no amendment in them, but rather shall see them
to wax worse, that then we hold them for desperate: and when we have
judged them such, we ought to declare unto them the sharp judgment of GOD,
and not to set holy and precious things before them, no more then before
dogs and hogs. Heretics are of the number of such people, as S. Paul does
show, saying, Eschew an Heretic, etc. If we will Tit. 3.
use the doctrine purely and well, without profaning it, we must feed the
faithful and willing to learn therewith, as the meat that is proper unto the^,
and that ought not to be refused them, except that we would be unfaithful
servants: yea wicked, and thieves: but the wicked, scorners, and obstinate,
ought to be feared with the horrible vengeance of God. Our Lord before us has
done so: so has S. Paul in Mat. 23.
diverse places of his Epistles. If so doing the scorners do hate us, and that
they do despite and blaspheme against the doctrine, we do not profane the
holy things, we give not pearls unto dogs, but by denouncing the judgment,
we pull them back. In making such declaration, we go not against this
admonition of Solomon, Rebuke not, etc. For it is not reprehension, but rather
condemnation, the which we may pronounce, as Solomon has already done in
diverse places, and very plainly in the first Chapter. When then we shall have
certain knowledge of the wicked and scorners, we should not spend the time
about rebuking of them, but having feared them with the judgment of God, we
should leave them as desperate and incorrigible, and employ our time to exhort,
to advertise, correct, and rebuke them by wholesome doctrine, which are apt to
learn, and which will yield themselves attentive unto the Word, and have
their delectation and pleasure to obey it, and believe it. Those are they whom
we must reprove, as Solomon does show us, when he says, Rebuke a wise
man, etc. Solomon does not here say any thing, neither in the first nor
second part of this sentence, which Achab and Iesabel have not proved true,
the which showed themselves very wicked and desperate scorners, when not only
they would not hear the corrections of the Prophet Elias, but through anger
and hatred did persecute him. Contrarily, David showed himself very wise,
when he received 1. King. 19. and 21. 2. Sam. 12.
the correction from the Prophet Nathan, wherein he showed that he did love
the Prophet.

We must labor to resemble him therein, and not Achab and Iezabel. But some
will ask whether it be lawful for us to abstain from rebuking of scorners, that
we may avoid their hatred, seeing that our Lord says, Fear ye not them
which can kill the body, but are not Mat. 10. 28. and 9. 10. and 10. 32.
able to kill the soul: but rather fear him, which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell. Blessed are they which suffer persecution for
righteousness sake: and, ye shall be hated of al men for my name sake. I answer,
that Solomon does not teach us, (that by holding our peace at scorners, and not
rebuking them,) we should labor to avoid their displeasure: but he does
show us that we profit nothing at al to reprove them, but get their hatred:
he does not show us the end whereunto we must tend, in abstaining from
rebuking, but only that which follows upon our reprehension. Also albeit,
that we must so much as in us lies, have peace and friendship Romans 12. 18.
with all men, yet when we rebuke wise men, our end ought not to be to win
their love: for in this sort, we should seek that which were ours, and not
what belongs unto God, and our neighbors. But only we must understand,
that if he whom we rebuke, is wise, that he will take in good worth and part,
our reprehension, he will take it well and thank us for it, and so will show
that he loves us. Hereupon we may gather, that except we willingly hear the
corrections, we are destitute of wisdom, and void of love, and filled with
hatred, and consequently, that we have no access unto God, as Jesus Christ
does teach us it. Furthermore, we may gather, that though we be wise, yet it
is not to say, but that we may commit things worthy of rebuke. Noe, Abraham,
Jacob and others, are witnesses thereof. And also, as there is no man just on
earth, which does good and sins not: even so, although we be wise, yet is
it not to say, that we do not deserve to have our imperfections, vanities and
follies showed unto us, that we Mat. 5. 22. and. 6. 14. and 18. 35. Eccl. 7.
11.
confessing ourselves such as we are indeed, might learn to amend and grow
in wisdom: For as we have seen, the wise will hear, and shall have more
learning. Even so now Solomon does admonish us:

9 Give admonition to the wise, and he will be the wiser: teach a righteous man,
and he will increase in learning.
If we had no vanity nor folly, if we had no sin nor malice we should be
perfectly wise and righteous, and should not need to receive instruction, nor
be taught: we should be filled enough, and should have abundance enough
thereof, without increasing or growing. But the sentence of Solomon agrees
very well with the same of our Lord, Unto every one that has, shall be given,
and he shall Mat. 25. 29.
abound, but he that has not, from him shall be taken that which he has. When
Solomon speaks thus, he shows that it is good reason that the wise man
should love them, which instruct and rebuke him, seeing, that by so doing,
they are so far of from doing him hurt, or taking any thing of his, that they
rather labor to profit him, and to make him grow and increase. We do the
same toward the scorner, when we reprove him: but through foolishness,
malice, and unthankfulness, by pride, presumption, and stifneckednes, he
contemns and refuses his profit, and follows and seeks his own hurt.
But although we see many to be of this miserable state, and that we have no
proof of their returning unto goodness, yet must we do that which is
enjoined us, Preach 2. Tim. 4. 2. Mat. 10. 16.
the Word: be instant, in season, and out of season. That we must so do, our
Lord does show us, when he says, I send you as sheep amongst Wolves. We
never hope that Wolves should become sheep: and yet our Lord would that his
Apostles should thrust themselves amongst the midst of them. But if we may
have a certificate that they are wholly froward, hard hearted, and not to be
corrected, we must leave them, and not meddle to give them any instruction,
neither rebuke nor correct them, to bring them to amendment, but to pronounce
unto them their judgment and condemnation. Saint Paul does thus teach us to
behave ourselves, saying, Alexander the Coppersmith has wrought me much evil:
the Lord reward him according to his works. 2. Tim. 4. 14.


10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of
holy things, is understanding. 11 For thy days shall be multiplied by me, and
the years of thy life shall be augmented.
Because that wisdom has bidden us unto her table, and has set before us
bread and wine, to the end that we may know whether we be truly partakers,
she gives us a mark and token, saying, The beginning of wisdom, etc. The
token and sign the^ which shall certify us whether we be refreshed at the
table of wisdom, is the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy
things. Here Solomon has set the effect before the cause: for from the
knowledge of the word of God, (which are holy things, proceeds the fear of
the Lord, if we fear him and tremble at his commandments, desiring to serve
him thereafter, and to give him true obedience: if we believe in him, assuring
ourselves of his promises: if we call upon him in all our necessities, and do
give him hearty thanks for all things: if we be careful for his honor and
glory, the same comes from the knowledge of holy things, from the
understanding of the holy and pure word of God, without the which we
contemn all the foresaid things, and do run into vanities and follies,
into superstitions and idolatries, into maliciousnes, and wickedness. But
Solomon esteemed not to keep or follow the order, neither was it necessary,
because that this fear and knowledge, are Pro. 2. 5.
things so knit together, that the one can not stand without the other: and
therefore also he has gathered them together. And S. John 1. Ioh. 2. 3.
also does gather them together, saying, And hereby we are sure that we know
him, if we keep his commandments. And when we have no knowledge of holy
things of ourselves, but only so much as it Psalm. 119. 18
pleases God to reveal unto us, as it is written, Open mine eyes, that I may
behold the wonderful things of thy law: Make me to understand the way of thy
precepts, and I will meditate in thy wondrous works. Blessed art thou, Simon,
the son of Jonas: for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my
Father which is in heaven. Mat. 16. 17. Luke 24. 45.
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures:
It follows well, that it comes not of our free will, that we have the fear of
the Lord, the which is required of the servants of the Lord above al things.
And now Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the
Lord thy God, to Deuteronomy. 10. 12.
walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul? As we may then learn here, the fear of
the Lord comprehends under it all the service and honor that we owe unto God,
wherein lies al our wisdom and knowledge. Therefore when Solomon says, the
beginning etc. He means Deuteronomy. 4. 6.
not, that for to be wise we have need of any other thing then the fear of
the Lord: but he would that we should know, that we are altogether void of
wisdom, except we have the fear of the Lord: so that we can not begin to be
wise, unless we fear the Lord: not as the infidels and faithless do, which
have no understanding: for they have no knowledge from whence only proceeds
the true fear. Such people, I say, have not the fear of the Lord, but of
torments. They fear him without knowing him to be pitiful and merciful: and
therefore they are afraid of the sharpnes of his judgment, as a pore offender
is afraid and trembles in the presence of the Judge, of whom he looks but
for all rigor. Besides this, we must note, that the table of wisdom is not
prepared with profane and unclean things, but with holy things, the taste
whereof, stands in understanding. They then which delight themselves in
vanities and folishnes, in malice and wickedness, in filthiness and pollution,
have no fellowship at the table of wisdom: and it is good reason, for they are
like unto the horse and Psalm. 32. 9.
Mule in which there is no understanding, the which only gives taste in the
heavenly things, whereof comes a good humor of the fear of the Lord, the
which quickens the souls of wisdoms children.

11 For thy days, etc. To the end that we should not refuse to come unto the
table of wisdom, and to eat of her bread, and drink of her wine, Wisdom does
show us that they which eat and drink at her table, shall be of no small
continuance. As if he said, there is no man but desires to live long, and fly
death. Wherefore come, eat of my bread, and drink of my wine, and ye shall
obtain your desires. By me shall thy days be multiplied, etc. We have the same
in the 3. Chapter, and 2. verse: and 4. Chapter and 22. verse, We can take no
poison at wisdoms table, unless we abuse that which she gives us. The meats
and drinks that she gives, are not corruptible, and they breed no evil humors
nor superfluities, as do corporal meats, whereof if we take too much, they
hurt both the body and the mind: for they make the body heavy, and dull the
spirits, and are cause that finally we go to perdition. Co^trarily, we can not
exceed in eating and drinking at the table of Wisdom, we need not fear to take
too much: for the more we eat and drink thereat, by so much the more are we
better disposed to live long. And therefore the bridegroom, which is the
wisdom of God, fears not to say unto his Church, Fellows, eat and Cant. 5.
1. Ephe. 5. 18*
drink: Friends, fill yourselues full. And this is that which Saint Paul
would: and be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess: but be filled with the
Spirit. And as there is no danger to fill ourselves at the table of wisdom,
but is very healthful: even so the table is always covered, whereunto
continually are al kinds of people called and bidden, and so many as come, are
refreshed. The preaching of the Word, and the administration of the Sacraments
do plainly enough show the same.

12 If thou be wise, thou shall be wise for thy self, and if thou be a scorner,
thou alone shall suffer.
Forasmuch as it is so, that by wisdom the days of such as eat at her table
shall be multiplied, which turns to the great profit of those which are there
refreshed, she concludes most fitly, If thou be wise, etc. Wisdom is not
like unto Inholders, which call in their guestes and evil entreat them, and make
them pay well. That which she does, comes from her pure liberality, and her
high magnificence: she entreats her guestes very honestly, and with great
gentleness. O God, how excellent is thy mercy? O God, etc. It is not Psalm. 36.
7. 8.
without cause that refreshing is attributed unto the goodness of God: For how
much soever he gives, he asks no payment therefore. Hoe, every one that
thirsts, come ye to the waters, and ye that have no silver, come, bye and
eat, etc. Then when wisdom Esai. 55. 1.
does call us unto her table, she regards our profit: but it ought not so to
be counted ours, that we should be sorry, if others be partakers thereof: for
albeit that it is said, Thou shall be wise for thy self: yet it is not to
say, that it is not lawful for us to use wisdom, as the covetous do use their
riches they have, keeping the same to themselves, and have no mind to impart
them unto their neighbors, for fear to diminishe them. For this that wisdom
does give us at her table, is as well for the pore which have need, as for
ourselves. But to be wise for a man his self, is to use the gifts and benefits
of wisdom as it behooves, and not to teceiue them in vain. And also we are
taught that we loose not our time, when we give ourselves unto wisdom: for we
are never destitute of good understanding, whereby we take heed of the
miseries, and chiefly from the spiritual. This is to be wise for himself.
Contrarily, when a man is bare of all goods, and is in great necessity, if he
refuse the benefit that is offered him, deriding them which would help him,
he is worthy to perish miserably, and to suffer that none other feel his
grief and evil. Again they that are stiffenecked and incorrigible, void of
wisdom the which is very necessary for them, and do scorn them which bid
them unto wisdom, even to the hating of them, and persecuting of them so much
as in them lies, shall themselves suffer the evil whereof they are worthy,
and not the commenners and householde people of wisdom. Solomon does well
signify the same, when he says, And if thou be a scorner, etc. This sentence
agrees with the same in Ezechiell. The same soul that sins shall die.
Again, Eze. 18. 20. 2. Cor. 5. 10.
We must al appear before the judgment seat of Christ. Of these sentences
we must gather that it is an abuse to think that there is any Purgatory for
to cleanse the souls after this life. As the wise shall be wise for himself,
and shall have thereby eternal profit: even so the scorner shall suffer
continually. For as there is no place after this life for repentance, even so
there is no obteining of forgiveness of sins. Esaias does well show it when he
pricketh us, saying, Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him Esaias.
55. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 2.
while he is nigh. And Saint Paul says: Behold now the accepted time, Behold
now the day of salvation. Be not deceived: GOD is not mocked: for whatsoever a
man sows, that shall he also a Gal. 6. 7.
reap.

13 A foolish woman is troublesome: she is ignorant, and knows nothing. 14
But she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the
city: 15 To call them that pass by the way, that go right on their way,
saying: 16 Who so is simple, let him come hither: and to him that is destitute
of wisdom, she says also, 17 Stolen waters are sweet, and hid bread is
pleasant. 18 But he knows not, that the dead are there, and that her guestes
are in the depth of hell.
Under the name of a foolish woman and ignorant, Solomon describes the folly,
as well of them which maintain others in foolishness, as they that commit
foolishness themselves. He attributes troublesomnesse and ignorance unto
them, as if he said, Where the fools and doltes ought to hold their peace,
and to give ear unto the wise for to learn of the^, because they are
ignorant, they are so presumptuous, that they labor to set forth and show
themselves, in criyng and making noyce, partly, because the wise should not be
heard, and that they seem to be overcome, partly to astonish the simple and
indiscreet, that they may hold them in their foolishnes and ignorance. Such
is the subtlety of Satan, the master and guider of such people, which does
puff them up with pride in such wise that they wax bold to show themselves,
where they ought in no wise to appear: they stand up to speak, where they
ought to hold their peace: they stir up strife, where ought to be at quiet,
and and to learn with silence. And albeit, as is said, that they are
ignorant, and that they deserve to be contemned, yet will they be the most
apparent and most set by. Solomon does signify it, when he says,

14 But she sits at the door, etc. This desire to be seen, and to be
honored, is declared unto us by the Lord, speaking of Mat. 23. 5
the Pharisees, which do all their works to be seen of men, etc. They that
follow them, as do the Monks and Priests with all the school doctors, do
sit at the gates of their house, the which they have placed upon the high
places of the city: for there is no people in all the world that desires more
to be seen, and more to be esteemed and praised then they. Now the cause that
moves the^ to desire to be so seen, is to draw a great number of people after
the^: for the world desires the things which are glorious, and is drawn by
that which greatly appears, rather tha^ by that which is true. That they tend
thereunto, Solomon does signify it, when he says that it is,

15 To call, etc. We are al passengers and pilgrims in this world which seek
another place: at the leastwise we ought to be, Heb. 13. 14. Col. 12. 20
and to walk right in our paths by innocence and righteousness, with
contempt of earthly things, which have a fair show. Therefore when these holy
men, so devout and religious, desire us to hear the^, they labor to stay us
on earth, and make us fix our desires and affections thereupon: they study to
draw us out of the right way. They desire not to have their audience and
hearers wise, and men of understanding, but fools and indiscreet, the which
cannot perceive that their wisdom is foolishness before God: for they call:

17 Who so is simple, etc. When Solomon speaks thus, he neither expresses
the thoughts, nor the sayings of these foolish masters: for thinking
themselves wise, and desiring to be so counted, they desire to be heard of
wise men for to make them more wiser: but he expresses what they do,, and
what their auditorie is: that is, that by their words and manners, they allure
unto folly and ignorance, and make those which give ear unto them, beasts,
yea, wicked and malicious: for we learn nothing of them, but to give ourselves
unto wickedness and malice, and to take our pleasures and lusts. The which
Solomon does signify by the stolen waters, and hidden bread: for as the
wholesome doctrine of the law and the Gospel, which is plainly called water and
bread, recreateth and refreshes the minds of the faithful, and works
goodness in them, and makes them wholly to delight therein: and being thus
disposed, are boulde to present themselves before, and desire not to go back
from the presence of God, neither fear to appear before him: even so the
doctrines and traditions of men which are not simply called water and bread:
but stolen waters, and bread that is secretly taken, do delight the carnal and
infidels, and do not teach them the pure truth, and true righteousness and
innocence, but al kind of follies and dreams, do make them to be given unto
diverse wickednesses, and do always hold them in doubt, and being thus
disposed dare not approach unto God, but so much as in them lies, do run and
hide themselves from him as thieves. And this is the cause why the doctrines
and traditions of men, and that which follows of them are called stolen
waters, and bread secretly taken.

18 But he knows not, etc. Whosoever drinks of the waters of folly, and
eats of her bread, is greatly deceived when he delights therein. Solomon
does well signify it, when he says, But he knows not, etc. It is a great
deceit for a man to take delight in his destruction and perdition, and not to
know it: and not only an abuse, but also most perilous danger, wherein there
is no remedy, no more then if a blind man not regarding a good guide, ceasseth
not to run hither and thither, until he be fallen down into a bottomless
pit. Here we see that ignorance is very dangerous, and that it excuses not
the ignorant. True it is that if Mat. 15. 14
the ignorant will return unto goodness by true repentance, their ignorances
nor yet wickednesses shall not be imputed unto them. Our Lord does show it,
when he prays for his murderers: Luke. 23. 24 1. Tim. 1. 12. 13.
and Saint Paul saying, Therefore I thank him, which has made me strong,
that is, Jesus Christ our Lord: for he counted me faithful, and put me in his
service: When before I was a blasphemer and a persecuter, and an oppressor: but
I was received to mercy: for I did it ignorantly through unbelief.

The end of the nienth Chapter, and the Preface to the Proverbs.
THE PROVERBES OF SOLOMON.
The tenth Chapter.
1 A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is an heaviness to
his mother.
WE have said at the beginning of this book, that Solomon in the niene first
Chapters did make a Preface and preamble upon these notable sentences that he
would publish. That this is true, partly is seen by this, that the former
words do follow now and then between, and may be joined together, as we
have already showed: partly also by this, that now in the beginning of this
tenth Chapter, he gives the title, saying, The Proverbs of Solomon: as though
he began a new book. And these sayings, as may be seen, are half and parted
sentences, for the joining whereof we need not to take any great pains. But we
must understand that these sayings are grounds and rules spoken according to
the word of the Lord: whereby he instructs the manners, and corrects the
error, and the faults of carnal wisdom. And almost there is no verse
hereafter, but has his rule and sentence, and for the most part divided in
twain: for even in one verse you shall find the praise of virtue, and the
blame of the contrary vice. The first sentence praises the wise child, and
blames the foolish. It says nothing which is not aproued true of all the^
that have any judgment at all: And also that which is here pronounced, is
commonly proved of every one, according as he is counted either wise or
foolish. The one sort have a true experience, and the other false and vain,
after as the one has knowledge of wisdom: and the other (which are the
greatest number) after as they believe lies, and are given to vanity. The
supersticious and idolaters, the carnal wise worldlinges are glad when their
children are like unto them, and count them very wise: but as this wisdom is
reproved of God (who will destroy it) as has been said: (I will destroy Esaias.
29. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 19. and. 2. 6.
the wisdom of the wise, etc. For the wisdom of this world, and of the
princes thereof, shall perish:) so also their joy shall not be of any
continuance, for it is worldly and carnal, and therefore it shall vanish away
quickly. Solomon speaks not here of this wisdom and gladness, but of that
which is after God, the which continewe for ever, seeing that the gifts and
callinges of God are without repentance. It is a gift and calling of GOD, when
the Romans 11. 24.
child, be it son or daughter, is wise, and that the father rejoices
therein, and that truly, and thus it is not a thing which quickly vanishes
away. But to the end that we might know which are the children that do
truly make glad their fathers, we must understand, what true wisdom is, and
wherein it stands. Moses Deuteronomy. 4. 5
does show it, Behold I have taught you Ordinances and Laws, even as the
Lord God has commanded me: ye shall do them therefore, and keep them, for
this is your wisdom. And forasmuch as there is no father being of sound
judgment, but rejoices at the wisdom of his children. Therefore it
follows, first of all that the fathers and mothers, and al superious and
gouerners ought to ber careful to see their children and subjects to be
instructed in the word, and not to be delighted with their follies,
wickedness, and dissoluteness as are many: but it oftentimes happens, that
the joy of the fathers and mothers, is turned into weeping and mourning, when
their children being evil brought up, do diversely work them injury and wrong
both by word and deed, or when they see them miserably perish. And in this
manner is somewhat fulfilled that the foolish child is sorrow unto his mother,
and that justly: for these wicked fathers and mothers, these negligent
superiors, and careless governors, which do not diligently take heed to
govern their children, and them which are under their charge: but suffers, or
seems not to see when they commit follies, and run astray, do well deserve to
have much sorrow therefore. Secondly, it follows that the children and
underlings which desire to make their fathers and mothers glad, and their
superiors and governors joyful, ought to give themselves to follow the word
of God, without declining therefrom, either to the right hand or to the left:
that if in this sort their parents and superiors do not rejoice, yet, they
cease not to be wise, and so much as in them lies do make them glad. They
ought above al things to be given unto the fear and reverence of God, as he
requires in the first table of the Law: and then to give reverence and honor
unto them, unto whom it is due, and then afterward to be gentle toward
their neighbors. Heerin they shall show forth true wisdom, whereat their
parents and superiors, and men of honesty will rejoice and be glad: but the
wicked will persecute them, as those places where the Pope reigns, do prove
it to be true: For they call evil, good; and good, evil. Such kind of people,
striving against this present instruction, Esaias. 5. 20
are grieved at the wise, and rejoice at fools, whose parents being led by
the spirit of God, cannot rejoice, but are in continual sorrow and grief. For
as Solomon says, A foolish child is an heaviness to his mother: etc. And
because that Solomon labored to give us short sentences, he expresses not in
plain words what he would have us to understand. He speaks here of
children only in the masculine gender: yet he means as well to instruct the
daughters as the sons, the women aswellas the men, according to the common
manner of the Scripture. Also he expresses not in the first part of this
sentence but the father, and in the 2. but the mother. For if we be people of a
sound judgment, we have all one affection toward our children, so that it
is such toward our daughters, as toward our sons. And it is not without
cause that we have said that fathers and mothers, and al superiors and
governors ought to be careful. For first of all they are ordained of GOD to
be as school masters, and to keep them in discipline that are committed
unto their charge. Secondly, children do pass little for wisdom, neither
make any count to attain the same, except they be thrust forward by some of
their friends: and the common people are easy to run astray, except the
Magistrate be very careful to keep them in straight, etc. Even so the
wisdom of children and inferiors, stands in obedience and sufferance to be
ruled after the word of God, and not in governing others. For the Lord will
have the weak to be subject, and to be taught obedience by the word. As
David says, Wherein shall a young man redress his way? in taking heed
according Psalm. 119. 9.
to thy word. If children and inferiors do thus wisely govern themselves,
they need not to fear any adversity: for the Lord will keep and defend
them, and make them blessed. The which Solomon does well signify by the joy of
the father. For there is nothing that more rejoices the father, then to see
and know that his children do prosper. And so we may understand that in the
fathers joy, there is promise of health enclosed: and contrarily, that in
heaviness of the mother, there is threatening of death and damnation. Besides
this, let us note that this which is said of parents and carnal children, may
likewise be stretched unto the ministers, and to their charge.

2 The treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from
death.
Although this sentence is general, yet considering the contents of the
former, it may be said that Solomon reprooueth those fathers, which care not
whither their children be wise or no: but are contented only that they have
wherewith to sustain their bodies: and to come thereby, they gather goods
together both by right and wrong, and reach their children to do the same.
This is that which Solomon says, the treasures of wickedness: and says, Mat.
6. 19. Iam. 5. 10. Eccle. 6. 2 and. 5. 12. 13.
that such treasures shall not profit. For first they are corruptible, and
subject to be lost. Secondly, they that owe them, most commonly, dare not
bestow them in well doing least they should diminish them, which is a great
misery. Thirdly, most commonly strangers do possess them, and not their
children. It is an evil disease, that the riches which are kept, turn to the
hurt of their owners. Fourthly, when he has gotten much, he cannot long enjoy
them: for a man passes away as a shadow, he heapeth up goods, and knows not
who shall gather them. O fool, this night will they fetch away thy soul from
thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou have provided? Fifthly
after this life they go to damnation Psalm. 39. 7 Luke. 12. 20
as we may see by the rich glutton in the 16. of Luke. It is therefore true
that the treasures of wickedness shall not prosper, as says Solomon. Wherein he
justly condemns covetousness. He condemns not riches, for they are the good
creatures of God given for the use of the faithful, and are instruments
whereby charity is exercised: and are ordained of God, to the end that we
should be enriched, not in hiding them and locking the^ up, but that we
should abound in good works. After that he has rebuked and condemned the
covetous with their covetousness, he praises and commends hospitality and
liberality, when he says, but righteousness delivers from death. Here he
sets righteousness against the treasures of wickedness, wherein he shows
that they which be not dealers of almose and liberal toward their needy
neighbors, are unrighteous, and deserve well to be punished, even with death,
as Solomon does well declare, when he sets the deliverance from death
against not profiting. This is as much as if he said, so much it wants that
the covetous do receive any profit of that which they heap together by the
hinderance of their neighbors, that they shall dye eternally: but they that
shall use liberality and benevolence taking heed from doing of wrong to their
neighbors, and giving to every man his own, shall be delivered from death, and
so shall live forever. Here Solomon takes justice for hospitality, and
liberality, for alms, and good deeds, for the works of charity and love,
as the Scripture takes it in other places. But it may here seem that Solomon
does attribute power unto our works to save us, and so we should not obtain
eternal life through grace, but by our merits. I answer, that of ourselves
we are altogether void of righteousness: and if we do any works, it is
because that God favors us, and works the same in us by his holy spirit:
and then he allows our works of his only goodness, and not of their own
worthiness: and because they are pleasant unto him, he promises to reward
them, and does attribute unto them that which belongs unto his only grace
and mercy. And this is because he does freely love us, buriyng all our
faults, for never more to remember them. And so albeit we can deserve nothing
by our works, yet are they not in vain: for if they be done according to the
word of God in uprightness of conscience, they are witnesses that he loves
us, and do assure us that we shall not perish, but do fully certify us of
eternal felicity. Besides this, let us note that they which have the goods of
this world, and care not to do good unto others, do possess the treasures of
iniquity: though they labor not to draw unto themselves the riches of
others, and that that they possess be well gotten, or be attained by gift, or
by succession of kindred.

3 The Lord will not famishe the soul of the righteous: but he casts away
the substacnce of the wicked.
We may see the wicked prosper, and to abound in wealth, they have their ease
and pleasures, they spend their time joyfully, and have rest and quietness:
and in the mean while the faithful which study to follow righteousness, are
poor, and suffer much sorrow. This is common and ordinary through all the
world: whereupon it comes that the children of God do envy and are grieved
and greatly tempted to forsake all righteousness and innocence, and to
follow all wickedness, that they may be partakers of the ease with the
wicked, and to prosper for a time as they do. They which flatter not
themselves in their infirmities and imperfections, and that truly know what
they are: do know and feel how they are tossed with such temptations. David
in his Psalms does declare to have felt it, as he confesses. He admonishes
us not to vex ourselves at the wicked, neither to envy them that Psalm. 73. 2
work wickedness. And by the discourse of the Psalm, he shows us that the
goodly show of the wicked is nothing but vanity, and that the poor estate of
the faithful is much more better, and more profitable then it seems, or is
thought to be. In following this doctrine, Solomon would not have fathers and
mothers to fear, that their children (which they shall instruct in wisdom
and righteousness) should perish and starve for hunger, though they gather
no great treasures for them. He also instructs us all generally, that we
should not put our trust in our goods, though we abound in them: and that we
should not be discouraged whether we have little or much, provided that we
delight to walk in a safe conscience, as God teach us by his word. For to
bring us unto this, and to persuade us it, he says, The Lord will not famish,
etc. Our Lord does give us the like doctrine in the sixth Chapter Mat. 6. 24.
of Saint Matthew: No man can serve two masters, and so forth to the end of
the Chapter. But they which have forsaken the Gospel, and received the interim,
they which dare not confess Jesus Christ for fear of loosing their lives and
goods, do not believe his promises made by David, Solomon, and Jesus Christ,
which have spoken by the spirit of GOD: and thus, so much as they can, they
make God a liar, spoil him of his truth, and consequently of his divinity,
seeing he cannot be God without his truth. Such kind of people and others
which do trust in their riches, shall find themselves deceived, as they
deserve. They think to be safe from evil, and that their goods shall not
fail them: but Solomon says, The Lord casts away the substance of the
wicked, The Lord does this in diverse sorts, as is daily proved, to wit, by
war, by law, by tempests, coldes, and surfettinges: in these manners he
casts away the substance of the wicked, when he spoyleth them of them, or
that he take them from the midst of their goods, when they think
themselves to be at rest, and that it seems unto them that nothing can hurt
them. Moreover, first of all let us note that as (in the second verse)
righteousness is taken for benevolence: so also in this place by the
righteousness is meant him that renounceth all covetousness, and does dedicate
himself to do good unto his neighbors, according as God has made him able,
and fears not that his goods should diminish, or he Psalm. 37. 16. and. 25.
suffer want: he says with David, A small thing unto the just man is better
than great riches to the wicked and mighty. Again, I have been young, and am
old: yet I saw never the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
Secondly, that if we would be satisfied, we must fly the company of the
wicked, and not to spare our goods from the poor. Thirdly, that we must not
attribute any thing unto fortune or chance, as do the unfaithful and
idolaters, which have no true knowledge of God, neither of his providence: but
as we know that to him only belongs the conservation and government of all
riches, even so also does wasting and destruction. It is he, that satisfies
and gives power to the meats and drinks to sustain us: It is he also which
breaks and overthrows all substance of bread and wine, taking from them the
power of nourishing. And thus it is needful for us, that we ask and crave
of the Lord, Give us this day our daily bread. etc.

Fourthly when Solomon does promise us that which we see, not with our
corporal eyes, but do prove and feel the clean contrary after the sense of
the flesh, he teaches us, that we have need of faith, whereby we may be
armed against the slanders of the cross. For when we see that the wicked
prosper, and that the good be afflicted, the flesh is offended thereat, and
judges that GOD cares not for to help them. But the promises of GOD require
faith, whereby we believe that GOD does help and defend us: albeit that for
a little time he suffer us to be exercised by diverse kinds of afflictions:
and does defend us not only in preserving us in this life, but also too give
us possession of the life to come. For since that his gifts and callinges are
without repentance, it follows Heb. 13. 11.
that his promises do reach further then this world, as the holy Patriarchs
did well understand it. Again, those which he counts not worthy of this
world, cannot but look for perpetual misery and calamity. Therefore when he
threatens to cast away the substance of the wicked, let us understand that
he threatens them with eternal destruction: for they cannot be worthy of
the blessed life, when they are unworthy of earthly substance. Fifthly, that
Solomon does not promise unto the righteous great bankets, and abundance of
riches and goods, for to live plentifully in carnal delights and pleasures,
but only that they shall not be famished. For we must eat, to slake hunger
and to quench 1. Tim. 6. 8. Heb. 13. 5
thrist, and not to fill ourselves in gluttony and drunkenness: and also we
are taught to desire our daily bread, and to content ourselves having food and
clothing, etc. As does the Apostle also admonish us, saying, Let your
conversation be without covetousness, and be content with those things
which you have: for he has said, I will not fail thee, neither forsake thee.

4 A slouthful hand makes poor: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
When they love to be at rest, and would not labor, do hear say that the
Lord will not hungerstarue the soul of the righteous: it seems unto them that
they need not to lay their hands to work, and will eat their bread in
idleness, and without labor, and do not think that it is possible for them
to become poor, and to have need: but Solomon does well show them the
contrary, saying, A slouthful hand makes poor: He speaks here nothing
darkly, nor which is not daily proved true by experience: but when he
speaks thus, it is not to say, that we must labor diligently, lest we
become poor, and with desire to be rich: for in the first, there should be
distrust of the goodness and providence of God: And in the second,
Covetousness, which are two vices abominable before God. For he would that
as he declares himself to be our father, and does promise to nourish us, eue^
so should we assure ourselves of his goodness toward us, and that we should
look with patience for all goodness to come from him, without fear of wanting,
casting al our cares upon him. So doing, we shall be the true seed of Abraham,
which is the father of all believers. The promise shall belong to us, Fear
not, Abraham, I am thy buckler, and thine exceeding Romans 4. 11. Genesis 15. 1
Psalm. 55. 22. 1. Pet. 5. 7.
great reward. The Lord shall bring it to pass upon us. Cast thy burden upon
the Lord, and he shall nourish thee: He will not suffer the righteous to fall
for ever. Cast al your care upon him: for he cares for you. And in thus
easing us of our burden, let us not be negligent and slothful, but let us
know that care, labor, and diligence are ordained for all times. Wherefore let
us follow the burden that God has laid upon us, which is, In the sweat of thy
face Genesis 2. 15. and. 3. 19. 2. The. 3. 10. Psalm. 37. 3.
shall thou eat thy bread. If then we labor not, we are well worthy to
fall into great poverty, and are not worthy to eat, unless we labor.
Albeit then that we must trust in GOD and commit our affairs unto him, yet
must we not have a slothful hand, but to be occupied in well doing. Commit
thy way unto and. 15.
the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall bring it too pass. But as has
been said, we must not do it for fear to wax poor: for albeit that we
labor, yet shall we not cease to be poor and needy, except God bless our
labor. For, neither is he that planteth, any thing, neither he that waters,
but God that gives the increase. It is very lawful to labor for to fly and
avoid poverty, but not to be seized with the fear thereof: as it is lawful
to become 1. Cor. 3. 7.
rich by working with care and diligence, but it is not lawful to covet
riches: for such desire is covetousness, which is very detestable before God,
and hurtful to our neighbors, which is not Ephe. 5. 3. and. 5. Col. 3. 5
lawful to be named. Whosoever is covetous, is an idolater: for he serves
riches, and not God: he puts his trust in insensible creatures, and not in
the Creator, which has given him wit and understanding: he worshippeth gold
and silver, and his belly, and not God, from who me all riches comes. And as
he has not Ephe. 5. 5.
his heart set on God, so has he no part in his inheritance. The covetous
person which is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
of God. Saint Paul names the covetous, amongst them which shall not inherit
the kingdom of God. It 1. Cor. 6. 10.
is good reason that such persons should be abhorred before God, and cast
out of his kingdom, when they distrust him, which is all good and almighty,
and does good to all men: (for we have nothing but of his goodness and
liberality) and do put their trust in their own arm: they leave and stay
themselves upon transitory things, wherein they set their affection, for the
which to satisfy and to possess riches at their wish and desire, they gather
wrongfully and otherwise then they should: they pole and pill their
neighbors diverse ways, and so they make themselves the enemies of God and of
men. Wherefore they shall have a great count to make. Besides this, when we
hear that the hand of the diligent makes rich, let us not deprive God of
his honor: but confess that if through our diligence we increase in riches,
that it is, because God guides our hands, and our work, and blesses our
labor, etc. Also that which we have said to be a slothful hand, Solomon
in his speech calls, a deceitful hand. For they which are negligent and
slothful, and which do not their office and duty, do dream hollowly and
devise unlawful means, to draw unto them the goods of others. And because
that Solomon sets diligence against deceit, we take deceit for negligence
and slothfulness.

5 He that gathers in Summer, is the son of wisdom: but he that
sleeps in Harvest, is the son of confusion.
Albeit that our Lord (for to make us to put our trust and hope in God our
father) does say unto us, Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
neither reap, nor carry into the barnes and yet your heavenly father feeds
them: yet let us not think he goes about to turn us away from laboring, or
that he would we should suffer the goods that God brings out of the earth
to perish, or that we should eat up al in one day, without keeping something
all the year long. For first of al our Lord has not taught for to abolish the
decree of God his father, the which is, that man should labor, not only one
day, but all the year through: and that in laboring he might live and be
nourished every day, throughout his life: as he gave to Adam to understand
(placing him in the garden of Eden, for to dress it) that he should eat his
bread in the sweat of his face, until he return unto the earth. And after
the flood he said, Here after seed time and harvest, and cold and heat,
and Summer and Winter, and day and night, shall not cease Genesis 2. 15. and 3.
19. and. 8. 22
so long as the earth remains. God has not ordained these times and seasons
in vain, but that according to the time and season man should employ himself
to work and to labor, and that thereof he should gather fruit to sustain
him and his. And since that harvest does not come but once a year, and that the
same is ordained for to gather the fruits of the earth, that God has brought
forth for man's sustenance, it follows that in acknowledging the goodness
and liberality of God our heavenly father: if we gather the fruits of the
earth, and lay them up in barnes and sellers, and too keep them, and to use
them for our necessity all the year after, that in so doing, we do not
disobey the doctrine of our Lord, but we obey God, and consequently our Lord.
For it is not his intent to condemn the seed time and harvest, nor the
provision that is made without covetousness: only he would that we should
not beenigardes, as they which have never enough: and as has been said, Do
fear that the earth should fail them. If we must not be such, much less
may we be like these thieves and murderers, to these rogues and cutthrotes,
which gather the fruits of the earth, under hope to make them dear, and will
enrich themselves by the hurt of their poor neighbor. They which profess
the Gospel, and do use such cruel trades, and such ungentle and diuelishe
trains and devises, as there are but too many which occupy them,) do greatly
offend and give an evil example: and it were better that they never had heard
speaking of the Gospel, except the Lord grant them grace to confess their
sins, and to forsake and give over such hellishe practices. If our Lord
would induce not to gather in season, he would pull us back from wisdom, and
would set us in confusion: he would make us to despise the ordinance of God,
our father, the which we ought in no manner of wise either to think or speak:
but knowing that Jesus Christ is of one will with God his father, we must gather
in So^mer, and watch in harvest, that is, that we take care and diligence to
lay our hands to work according to the seasons and times appointed, every one
following the estate whereto god has called him. For albeit that Solomon has
not expressed but Summer and Harvest, because he endeavors to give us brief
sentences, and easy to behold, yet we will here comprehend all seasons,
and whatsoever GOD would that man should be occupied in. If we spend the
time about the labors and works that God has ordained, we shall be wise, and
shall avoid confusion, from which also we shall keep others, so much as
lies in us: for we will live of our labor, and shall be preserved from begging,
which is a confusion not able to be borne, and shall also deliver them from it
which we shall refresh with the fruit of our pain and travel. Contrarily, if
we be given to sleep, and to idleness, when it is time to work, we shall
both confound ourselves and others, for whom we are bound to bestow
ourselves, to keep them from begging. This word Confusion, is taken in this
signification in the 37. Psalm, They shall not be confounded in the perilous
time, and in the days of famine they Psalm. 37. 19.
shall have enough. But it may be said that Solomon should not have brought
forth this as a notable sentence, seeing that there is not so simple an Idiot,
which knows not well that we must gather riches in due season, and that we
must not be sluggishe when it is time to gather the fruits of the earth: and
therefore, that there is not so much wisdom in it, as that there should be
mention made of it. I answer, That since God has ordained such gathering and
vigilancie, it is no small wisdom for a man to know well how too employ
himself as it behooves. All the wisdom of the Monks and Friars in Popery,
is nothing but foolishness and vanity, yea even wickedness, in comparison of
this wisdom. But it may be replied, that there is not the poorest Labourer
or handy crafts man that is not as wise as the ministers of the Church: for
the ministers do no other thing then did the Friars, Priests and Monks. I
answer, That the true Ministers are assured of their vocation, and do occupy
themselves therein, and also they do not gather together nor watch. The true
Ministers, are Preachers, Doctors, Pastors, builders, Reapers, Sowers,
Watchmen: but the Friars are clean contrary, they are good for nothing but to
trouble the water, to prate without doctrine, to eat, to destroy, so tread
underfoot the good corn, and to be dumb dogs and sleepy. There is then great
difference: for as we have probation, some are wise children, and others do
bring confusion.

6 Blessings are upon the head of the righteous: but iniquity shall cover the
mouth of the wicked.
So long as we live in this body, we can not judge by our outward wit what
the righteous are, (that is to say, those which by the fear, reverence, and
Faith they bear unto the word of God, do delight to serve the Lord and
their neighbors, and desire to profit al men, and to hurt no man,) neither
that they can be counted blessed, nor that they are in the grace and favor of
God, seeing that we see them abound in misery, and to be beaten down with
calamities: they are afflicted of the world by peeling and polling, prisonment,
wounds, banishment, cursing, lying, slandering, and cauillations, and diverse
other ways, which can not be easily expressed. For some do suffer in one
sort, and some in an other: to be short, it seems that God is their enemy,
and that he persecuteth them to destroy them. And therefore, few esteems
well of them, as Eliphas the Themanite of Job. Remember, I pray thee: who ever
Job. 4. 7.
perished being an innocent? Or where were the righteous destroyed? The Jews
did no less esteem of the Prophets, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of his
Apostles. The Papists have the poor Christians which suffer persecution for
the Gospel, in like reputation. Co^trarily, the wicked (that is to say, the
infidels, which with will and mind, with deed and word, do despite God, and
make no count Psalm. 7. 3.
of their neighbors,) are judged happy and blessed: they are feasted, they
are praised and commended, and it seems well that they are in the grace and
favor of God, and that he does bless them, that he does love them and
maintain them. Such is the judgment of carnal man, which judges after the
outward sight: but Faith judges far otherwise, and the word whereupon Faith
is stayed, pronounces also contrary: as we see it, when Solomon is not
contented alone to say, that the righteous shall obtain blessing: but to show
that he is even here happy in diverse sorts, although he be greatly molested:
he says, blessings are upon the head of the righteous: he appoints not
the time, neither present nor to come, for to declare that the blessings shall
not fail them: but having had their beginning in this life, they shall endure
for ever. Blessed are ye, when men revile you, and persecute you, and say al
manner of evil against you for my sake, falsely. My brethren, count it exceeding
joy, when ye fall into diverse temptations. Again, Blessed Mat. 5. 11. Iam. 1.
2. Iam. 1, 12.
is the man, that endures tentation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the
Crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
Contrarily, though the wicked do flourish, yet are they, and shall be cursed, as
may be known plainly, when their iniquity shall be opened, and that for the
same they shall be ashamed, for because of their iniquity, which shall be as a
choke pear to stop their mouth, they shall not be able to allege any thing
worth to defend themselves with all. Solomon does signify it, when he
says, But iniquity shall cover the mouth of the wicked. In some it is opened
sooner, and in other some later. Some men's sins are manifest before hand,
and go before unto judgment: but some men's follow after. For their iniquity
committed, they shall suffer 1. Tim. 5. 24.
punishment before al men, wherewith they shall be greatly confounded: and the
righteous shall be glorified and honored, and their felicity shall shine and
shall be seen of al men. Solomon does well signify the same, when he places
the blessings to light on the head, the which is the highest part in man, upon
the which the ornaments can not be hid. These ornaments of blessing are now
hid in the world: but they which are not stayed at the outward appearance,
but by Faith, do behold the goodness that God has done unto his faithful
servants in the midst of their troubles, do see even presently the head of
the righteous garnished with blessings, the which they shall more plainly see
in the possession of the heavenly kingdom.

7 The memorial of the just shall be blessed: but the name of the wicked shall
rotte.
Albeit, that now presently it seems unto the world, that the righteous are
forgotten before God, because that no man reuengeth the injuries and wrongs
that are done them (as David does declare it, saying, He has said in his
heart, God has forgotten, he hides Psalm. 10. 11.
away his face, and will never see. O Lord the auenger, O God the auenger,
show thy self clearly. And for this cause also the faithful do lament, and
complain. Why stand thou far of, O Lord, Psalm. 94. 1. Psalm. 10. 1. Psalm.
13. 1. Psalm. 45. 23. and 24.
and hidest thee in due time, even in affliction? Again, How long will thou
forget me, O Lord? for ever? How long will thou hide thy face from me?
Again, Up, why sleep thou, O Lord? awake, be not far of for ever.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our misery and our affliction?)
yet notwithstanding, he has not so much forgotten them, but that he does
remember to bless them for to do them good, and show them grace and favor,
to give them help, defense and sauegarde, so far as he knows to be
expedient to bring them unto eternal blessing. Solomon does signify the same,
saying, The memorial of the just, shall be blessed. Contrarily, the wicked are
famous, they are commended, and do praise themselves. He says in his heart,
I shall never be moved, Psalm. 10. 6. and 12. 4.
nor be in danger. And, With our tongue will we prevail: our lips are our
own: who is Lord over us? but their name shall be abominable and filthy.
Solomon does declare it, saying, The name of the wicked shall rotte.

8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but the foolish in talk shall be
beaten.
Our wisdom is to keep and to do the commandementes of Deuteronomy. 4. 6.
God. Wherefore the wise says very well, that the wise of heart, will receive
them. He says expressly, the wise of heart, that is to say, he which truly
loves wisdom, and is no counterfaite as the worldly wise, which justify so
much themselves, that they can not abide any admonition though it be very
needeful, as S. Paul does show it, This know also, that in the last days
shall 2. Tim. 3. 1.
come perilous times, etc. Those that are such, can not suffer any admonitions
neither of Father nor Magistrates, neither yet of Ministers: and yet less of
private and particular persons. But he which has wisdom printed in his
heart, knows well that he has need of wisdom, and desires to increase
therein: and therefore he gladly hears that which is showed him in the name,
and by the Word of GOD, and labors to conform himself unto the doctrine
that is set before him. This same is to receive the commandments, and not to
be like unto the son which promised to his father to do that he commanded,
and did nothing. But rather if in time past we have said, we will not go,
that now by true repentance and Faith let us give our hearts to obey God our
father, and consequently them, which he has ordained over us, to direct and
govern us. Thus doing, we shall not be worthy of stripes and wounds, but
rather of good reward and recompense: though we can not deserve it, but such
is the will of God our Father, so to recompense his obedient children and
servants. Contrarily, if we declare ourselves to be rebels and disobedient, let
us look to be beaten as we deserve, because of our folly, which we show in
gain saying, and striving against the truth, and that by justice and equity.
Solomon does show it us, saying, But the foolish in talk shall be beaten. He
that makes not count of true wisdom which is taught us by the word, but
does give himself to speak and do things contrary thereunto, is foolish in
his talk, and yet cease not to be folish in his heart: for from the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaks: and also other outward works do
follow thereof: for the outward part is like to the in ward, except we
disfigure ourselves by hypocrisy, the which will always appear holy and
wise, and not foolish: and therefore, if we show any foolishness in words,
or in works, it is a plain argument that we are not wise in heart.
Wherefore, we may judge that they which permit and take leave to talk
foolishly, or to do acts against God and his word, for to avoid persecutions,
do deceive themselves when they would make men believe that they think not as
they say, or as they do: for the outward works, and chiefly such as are
wicked, are certain fruits conceived in the heart of man, the which is evil
from his childhood. And thus, though Solomon do not speak but of the lips,
yet he forgets not to touch the heart, which is the root that brings
forth the fruit, as we ought to understand by the former reasons. And also
the Antithesis or comparison that he makes between the wise in heart, and
the foolish in talk, does show it well: otherwise it should not agree. In the
first part of the comparison, he expresses the root, for to exclude worldly
wisdom, which is of great show, and is nothing but rebellion: for it will not
be subject unto the law of God: for it is led by the desire of the flesh:
afterward he expresses the Romans 8. 6. 7.
fruits which proceed from the true wisdom of the heart, that is to say, To
receive the commandments: wherein he notes the obedience of the wise in
heart, to the which the wise worldlinges are contrary and opposite: whereof
follows, that they are disobedient.

In the second part of the comparison, he expresses but the evil fruit,
which can notlye: and therefore in expressing it, he declares plainly what
the root is, that is to say, evil: for the tree is known by his fruit. He
immediately after expresses the recompense of them which speak and do evil,
that is to say, that they shall be beaten, they shall be chastened and punished,
first in this world, if so be it, that they watch diligently over the public
slanders and offenses, and that the Magistrates be zealous, and that they be
careful to pronounce good and right judgment, upon that which they know, and
is manifest unto them, in susteining and defending the good, and punishing the
wicked, according as the fruits appear: for they have not the knowledge of in
ward foolishness, but so far as the same is opened outwardly: and
therefore, Solomon says not, the foolish of heart shall be beaten: but the
foolish in talk, that is to say, he which shall show himself foolish by
words and wicked works. If fathers and mothers love their children, and are
careful more for their souls then for their bodies, they will chasten them, if
their manners and conversation be not good and honest. They which spare the
rod at need, do hate their children, and make no count of the honor of
God. Whereupon they ought to look for grievous punishment: for since they will
not strike whilst it is time, they themselves are worthy to be beaten. And
also it happens often unto them, that their children which they have borne
withal in their malice, when they come to age, not only do set naught by them
and reject them, but also stand up against them, in robbing them, cursing and
doing them much hurt. And finally, if they do not confess their negligence,
they shall be beaten with eternal pains. If superiors do truly love their
subjects, they will chasten the foolish, that the good may live in peace, and
that the slanders and offenses may be rooted out from the congregation of the
Lord: otherwise they shall be beaten: for first of all, the foolish will rise up
against them: and in the end, they shall not avoid eternal damnation. I will
honor them that honor me, etc. 1. Sam. 2. 30.
And as they which ought to punish the foolish, shall be beaten for their
negligence: even so also, shall the foolish be for their foolishnes, except
they return by true repentance.

9 He that walks uprightly, walks boldly: but he that peruerteth his
ways, shall be known.
For as much as we al desire to avoid perils and dangers, and to live safely
and without fear of evil, we must hear Solomon which does admonish us of the
means, when he says, He that walks uprightly. There is none in this world
that lives so perfectly, but that he has some fault. For we have al need to
crave pardon for our sins, and continually to confess that we are sinners,
how uprightly soever we live: and thus the uprightness whereof Solomon
speaks, lies not in a perfection that can not be mended, and whereto there
can nothing be added: for so long as we live in this world, we have need to
repent, to amend our faults, and always to grow forward in goodness, through
the knowledge of the truth. But this uprightness lies in soundness of
conscience, whereby having our hearts right and not double, we abhor al
dissimulations and hypocrisies, and labor to follow holiness, righteousness and
truth in all things, and with all men. The world makes no great account of
this uprightness, but all the world almost is given to deceit and crafty
dealing, unto filthiness and uncleanness, unto hypocrisy and lying. And
forasmuch as the greatest part of men and women are such, Psalm. 12. 2.
they judge themselves to be in safety, when they are given to such wickedness.
And so the number of them which believe the sentence of Solomon, is very small,
and almost none. Whereupon follows also that there is almost none, that
walks safely: but it happens almost to al, as it is said, When they shall
say, Peace, and safety; then shall come upon them, sodeine destruction. The
world destroyed by the flood, Sodom and Gomorrha, Dathan, Core and Abiram, and
^. These. 5. 3
diverse other wicked ones, have well felt and shall feel it, and if we follow
them, we must look also to feel the same. For as the Lord knows the
righteous and perfect, for to deliver them from temptation, to keep them, to
defend them, and to save them, that he may give them victory over al perils
and dangers: even so also they which peruerte their ways, contemning all
integrity and vprightnes, and giving themselves in diverse sorts unto
contrary things, can not be hid, but shall be known by the Lord, to draw Mat.
13. 4.
them and divide them from the just and perfect, as we separate the tares and
the chafe from the good corn, for to send them unto unquenchable fire. In
looking for the which, albeit they say, that God does not see them, nor know
them, yet can he find them out, as they daily feel by wars, pestilences,
famines, diseases, by afflictions outward and inward: and in this sort they
begin here their hell, the which shall not forsake them. For as they esteem
not to make their ways right, as well by blindness and ignorance, as by hardness
and obstinacy, and that attributing al unto fortune and chance, in their
affliction they know not that it is the hand of God that strikes them,
neither also do they make any haste to turn unto God, for to crave of him
repentance and amendment of their sins, and deliverance from evil: and so they
must needs perish in them. But albeit, that after the outward appearance and
the sense of the flesh, the just and perfect suffer in this word the like or
more grievous afflictions, yet do they not here begin their hell. For they
knowing that they be the rods of God their Father, do ask deliverance, and
are assured to obtain the same. And thus on what side soever that the
afflictions do come to the just and perfect, because they know that God is
their keeper and deliverer, they are not afraid as discouraged and desperate,
but in all assurance they say, Yea though I should walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear Psalm. 23. 4. and 27. 1.
none evil. Again, The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? They know
this same, because of the infallible promise: and call upon me in the day of
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. The Lord is
near unto all that Psalm. 50. 15. and 145. 18. Mat. 11. 28. Luke 12. 32. 1. Cor.
10. 13.
call upon him: yea, to all that call upon him in truth. Come unto me, all
ye that are weary and laden, and I will ease you. Fear not, little flock:
for it is your fathers pleasure, to give you the kingdom. And GOD is faithful,
which will not suffer you to be tempted above that you be able, but will even
give the issue with the temptation, that ye may be able to bear it. The wicked
can not thus speak indeed: for although they think themselves so safe and
sure that they can not be more, and that they trust in their own strength, yet
because they are hated of God, he can well find them out, and bring their
enterprises to naught, and destroy them by their own counsels. He has made a
pit and dug it, and is fallen into the pit that he made. His mischief shall
return upon his Psalm. 7. 15. and 16.
own head, and his cruelty shall fall upon his own pate. The heathen are
suncken down in the pit that they made: in the net that they hid, is their
foot taken. Psalm. 9. 15.


10 He that wincketh with the eye, works sorrow: and he that is foolish in
talk, shall be beaten.
Amongst them which pervert their ways, there are some more cloase and couerte
then other some are: some there be that are known forthwith, and others
again for a certain time lie hid and are secret. The close and hid, are most
hurtful and pernicious. For a time they make a goodly show, and bear a smooth
countenance, and seem that they laugh at the prosperity of their neighbor,
as though they were ready to do them pleasure: but yet for all that they
delight to mock, and to invent some treason. Solomon does signify the same by
wincking or making sign with the eye. But when at last their dissimulation and
hypocrisy is known, and that they are seen to counterfaite and dissemble, by
the fruits which come from them, then feel we greater sorrow and more
grievous pain then if we had known them openly at the first. Solomon does
signify the same, when he says, That he works sorrow, that wincketh with
his eye. If they (which by such manners bring hurt, either to the body or to
this worlds good) do work sorrow, and that we be careful to take heed thereof,
by a more strong reason must we take heed of Monks and Friars which have a
goodly show, for with this, Mat. 7. 15. Romans 16. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 5. Mat. 15. 14.
that they devour temporal riches, judging gain to be godliness, so do they
also destroy the souls of those that follow the^. For if the blind lead the
blind, both shall fall into the ditch, the which is a sorrow and grief
inexpressible, and without any remedy, except we provide help in good time
for the same. They which openly declare and show forth their foolishnes and
wickedness, are not so dangerous: they bring not so much sorrow to them which
have any wit to fiye and avoid them, or to turn them away from their
enterprises, or to suppress their insolency. Also, look where there is good
order, when they show themselves such, they are admonished and rebuked, they
are chastened and punished: And therefore they can not bring so much sorrow and
grief. Solomon does signify it, saying, He that is foolish in talk, shall be
be beaten. There is here no virtue compared or set against vice, but a greater
vice, unto a lesser. The first part of the sentence contains a rebuke of
hypocrisy, flattery, dissimulation, and counterfaiting, with advertisement of
the evil that comes thereof. Wherein we ought to learn, not to be children
in understanding, but of ripe wit and good discretion, seeing 1. Cor. 14. 20
there is none but is grieved, when he feels himself to be deceived. By the
second part, he shows what the foolish and wicked do deserve, and warns
them that are aloft and in authority, to do their duty, and to take away
offenses and slanders so much as in them lies. And moreover, because that no
man would gladly be beaten, he exhorts us to be wise, and to be of good,
holy, and honest conversation. If thus doing we suffer wrong, as have the
holy Patriarks, Prophets, Jesus Christ and his Apostles, and other servants of
God, let us not be grieved. Blessed are they which suffer persecution for
righteousness sake. And who is it that will harm Mat. 5. 10. 1. Pet. 3. 13 and
4. 12.
you, if ye follow that which is good? Dearly beloved, think it not strange
concerning the fiery trial, which is among you to prove you, as though some
strange thing were come unto you.

11 The mouth of the righteous is a welspring of life: but iniquity covers
the mouth of the wicked.
For when a very clear spring and pure, flows with water, running here and
there by fordes, then it serves to refreshe them which drink thereof, and
preserves them from dying by thirst: and so it is healthful unto them, and
does also as concerning the body quicken the same. The mouth of the righteous
will speak of wisdom, Psalm. 37. 3^.
and his tongue will talk of judgment. Then does it profit them which
believe his counsels, for they are delivered from death, insomuch as they are
freed from sin, and made servants to God, they have their fruit in holiness, and
the end, everlasting life: for the righteous Romans 6. 22.
does not teach nor counsel, but only that which serves to salvation and
life. Solomon does signify it, when he calls his mouth the welspring of
life. Our Lord says that from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
Now it is said: the law of his God is in his heart, therefore his steps shall not
slide. Whervppon follows that it Mat. 12. 34. Psalm. 37. 31.
brings life to them which receive this doctrine, which follow his counsels,
tremble at his threatenings, and delight in his exhortatio^s, and also do assure
themselves of the promises of life that is preached unto them. Co^trarily, as
out of a durty puddle, we can draw nothing but filthiness and infection, for to
infect, poison and to kill those which drink thereof: so also it is said, there
is no constancy in the mouth of the wicked: within they are very corruption,
their throat is an open sepulcher, and they flatter with their tongue. Whereupon
follows Psalm. 5. 9.
that we can learn nothing of the mouth of the wicked, but al evil, when we
hear no manner of goodness come from their mouth: but it abou^deth with all
filthy and corrupt words, as it appears: for it does open it self. Solomon
does signify the same, saying, but iniquity covers the mouth of the wicked.
When Solomon says, does cover, he neither excludes the time past nor
present, but speaking in the future tence, he shows the hardness and
obstinacy of the wicked, to the end that we should stand upon our watch at
al times. For as they have not ceased nor do cease, so also they shall never
cease, until the end of the world, to speak filthily, to give evil counsel,
and to spread abroad false doctrine. But the evil men and deceivers, shall wax
worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. Now they which follow their
uncleanness and wickedness, giving themselves unto iniquity, shall fall in death.
For it is said, The reward of 2. Tim. 3. 13.
sin, is death. Heretofore, we have expounded the 2. part of this sentence
otherwise, but not contrary, and that by force of the Antithesis Romans 6. 23.
or comparison that Solomon makes there. Here he sets the virtue of well
speaking and ruling the mouth, against the vice of perverse and wicked mouths.
He does this honor unto them which speak well, for to attribute unto them the
welspring of life, and to make them as it were auctors of health and life, unto
these which learn of them. Saint James does the like, saying, Brethren if any
amongst you has erred from the truth, and some man has converted him, let
him know that he which has converted Iam. 5. 19. and 20.
the sinner from going astray or out of his way, shall save a soul from death.
And this is according unto the doctrine of our Lord. Thus it pleases the
Lord to honor such as speak truth. Contrarily, Mat. 18. 15 John. 20. 23.
Solomon accuses those which have their mouths covered with iniquity, of
murder: he expresses not the accusation, but it must be understood by the
present Antithesis. Now since that they which have an evil tongue are
murderers, they cannot look but for death. Contrarily, those which out of the
good treasure of their hearts do bring good things, are assured of life, as by
their office they are the auctors of life, etc.

12 Hatred stirs up contentions: but love covers all trespasses.
When men or women are kindled with hatred, wrath, and anger, with envy and
ill will against their neighbors, although it be very wrongfully and without
cause, and that their neighbors have given them no manner of occasion to bear
evil affection toward the^; yet can they not speak gently and lovingly unto
them, they cannot say well of them: but do wrong and deal injuriously with
them, and speak all the evil they can against them, and do greatly reproach
them to their faces, being ready to stryke and beat them, to murder and kill
the innocents: and behind their backs they slander and do falsely belly them,
they diffame them, and bring them into the hatred, so much as they ca^, of all the world, that many may rise up against them which have not offended, that
they may be destroyed and undone: So much as possible they ca^, they set al in
trouble, they stir up seditio^s, vprores and persecutions against those that
wish them no evil. Solomon does signify it, saying, hatred stirs up
contentions. This stir is made, as is said, and as the innocents in all times
have had trial: As Abel, Moses, David, the Prophets, our Lord, his Apostles,
and other faithful men: and yet still the wicked cease not to do and to speak
the like against them that follow the truth, and that desire nothing but their
health and salvation. But the saying of Solomon ought not to be restrained unto
this manner of hatred. For we have experience that when there is hatred between
parties, that they bite and sting one another, do charge and reproach one
another with all the villainies they ca^: they detract one another, and there is
nothing but they will blame, and interpret the doings and sayings one of another
altogether in the evil part: the which is cause of mortal strife, of
seditions, of vprores, of battles and wars, of murders and slaughters. Mat.
5. 22. 1. Ioh. 3. 13.
Solomon does well signify it here: and so he accuses al them which hate
their neighbors of murder and manslaughter: he pronounces them guilty, and
breakers of this commandment, Thou shall not kill: as does also our Lord, who
soever hates his brother, is a mansleyar. They that are such, can not pray
unto God, but against themselves, as appears. Wherefore, we must understand,
Mat. 6. 18.
that hatred is a sin most detestable, and which we ought greatly to abhor
when it separateth us from God, and hinders us to have access unto him.
Contrarily, for that which has been said of hatred, if men and women do
truly love their neighbors, they will speak unto them with all softnes and
gentleness, they will have none evil suspicion of them, they will not labor to
hinder their good name: but where they are evil spoken of, they will endeavor to
excuse them, and even when we have offended them, they will dissemble and bear
with many things: they suffer, and yet forgive many things, burying their
neighbors faults, and labor to save their honesty. Solomon does well
signify it, saying, But love covers all trespasses: and after him, Saint
Paul says, Love is 1. Cor. 13. 4.
patient. We have here a doctrine of great excellency, whereunto we must
diligently apply ourselves, if we will avoid strife and contentions, and to be
the true children of God: Beloved, let us love one another: for love comes of
God, and every one that loves, is borne 1. Ioh. 4. 7.
of God, and knows God. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that if our
neighbors be offensive, that we should allow their wickednesses: but if they
have offended us, that we should bear with them in healing them, and giving
remedy thereto by admonitions, aduertisements, corrections, and threatenings,
not sharp nor rigorous at the first entrance, least it happen, that handling
them too hardly at the beginning, the evil and disease be rather increased and
made worse, then diminished and amended.

When S. Peter exhorts us, that above al things we should have fervent love
amongst us: for love covers the multitude of sins: 1. Pet. 4. 8.
for to confirm his exhortation, and to show us that there is nothing more
profitable unto the saints and faithful, the^ to maintain mutual charity, he
brings this reason. For love covers the multitude of sins. And this is
most fitly and aptly, for so much as we all offend, and fall in many things.
Wherefore we have all need to be forgiven, and there is no man but desires
to be forgiven. Thus love is very necessary. For if it rule amongst us, she
brings us this excellent benefit, that we forget innumerable evils.
Contrarily, if we give hatred the bridle, men in biting and tearing one
another, must needs consume one another: And therefore Paul does exhort
Gala. 5. 13
us by love to serve one another. And we must mark that Solomon says, All
trespasses, And Saint Peter, multitude of sins: wherein they teach us, that
in what sort soever our neighbors sin against us, and how often soever
they shall offend us, we should gladly forgive them, if we love them truly,
and that according unto the sentence of our Lord. And for to show us that we
ought and are bound to obey his sentence, and that we should not Mat. 18. 22.
think we do any great thing when we forgive, he adds a similitude. As
touching the rest, by how much as love does give remedy to more sins, by
so much does his profit reach further unto the conservation of mankind, the
which falls asunder, and runs to destruction through hatred and variance
that follows thereof. Behold, this is the plain meaning of this verse.
Whereupon it appears, that the Papists do well deserve to be mocked, when, by
corrupting this text, they labor to establish their satisfactions, and would
have alms and other works of charity to take place of recompense before God,
for to put away sins. It is very true, that if we have pity and compassion
of our brethren which err and go astray, and that of love we show them their
faltes, so that by our advertisement they return to well doing, our love
serves them to obtain forgiveness of their sins. Brethren, if any of you Ia.
5. 19. and 20.
have erred from the truth, and some man has converted him, let him know that
he which has converted the sinner from going astray out of his way, shall save
a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. Wherein let us note
that S. James does not allege the witness of Solomon, but only does make an
allusion theretoo: as if he said, Solomon says that the fruit of love is, that
it covers sins: but there is no better nor more healthful way for to hide
them, then when they are utterly and clean blotted out before God. Now this is
done, when by our admonition the sinner is reduced and brought again into the
good way: and therefore we must be diligent to admonish the^ which go astray.
Moreover, although it is not the intent of Solomon, yet the truth stands,
that if by love we forgive our neighbors the offenses they commit against us,
that God will forgive us ours that we commit against him. But yet for all that
let us not think that our love or the conversion and winning Mat. 6. 14.
of our neighbors can deserve the forgiveness of sins: and therefore we
should not have regard unto them to rest our salvation thereupon, which
comes of the forgiveness of our sins: but let us know that both the one
and the other do obtain pardon and to attain unto salvation, because that by
faith we are assured, and stayed upon the promises of God, which are contained
in the Eze. 18. Mat. 6
books of the Prophets and Apostles.

13 In the lips of him that has understanding, wisdom is found, and a
rod shall be for the back of him that is destitute of wisdom.
He is a wise man which being taught in the word of God, does set his whole
delight therein, and through the knowledge that he has thereof, the which is
printed in his heart, he labors to govern himself well both in his doings
and sayings. Such a man is replenished with true wisdom. And for so much as
from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks, they that are such, must
needs utter wisdom, and continne and persevere therein. Also Solomon says
not, that wisdom has been found, or is found, albeit that it is so: but to
show the constancy and perseueraunce, he says, shall be found. This is a
great argument, that in this world the number of wise men is very small, and
almost none. For if there be very few of them, in whose lips wisdom is
found, yet is the number of them less, in whom it shall be found, experience
does sufficiently show it, but yet we may understand the same by the
parable of the seed cast into the ground, Mat. 13.
etc. For as the heart is disposed, so does it lead and govern the lips.
And as touching the country, where, the Preachers by the word of God, do
freely and at liberty teach the true wisdom and prudence, we find in the
lips of the most part, foolishnes and wickedness, we may well judge, that the
hearts are bent and dispoposed to evil, and that they are destitute of
prudence and wisdom. If the Magistrates and justices of the bench had such
zeal as they ought to have to do their office, and that they were so careful
to take heed as it behooves, upon the slanders and insolentnesse: If fathers
and mothers, and such as have the charge of youth, did straightly look to the
manners of children and young people, we should see other manner of punishments
and corrections then we do. The foolish which for want of good mind and heart
do openly disdain and reject wisdom, and are so lewd that they give
themselves unto vanity, foolishnes, and wickedness, should be punished, for
they well deserve the same: as Solomon says, that a rod shall be for the back of
him, that is destitute of wisdom, or lewd of heart. Wherein Solomon shows into
what dishonor and danger they do bring themselves, which have not a right heart,
and they which set not their mind and desire to follow understanding and wisdom,
but do lay the bridle in the neck of their carnal lusts, and do delight in
things nothing worth, and follow folishnes and wickedness. He teaches
Magistrates also their lesson, and does show them that if the foolish and
unprofitable and hurtful persons continue in their lewdnes, and do openly
declare it, either by deeds or by words, that they ought not to abstain from
giving such punishment, as the foolish and wicked shall deserve. Likewise he
instructs fathers and mothers. Furthermore, when he sets lewdnes of heart
against understanding, and the rod against wisdom, we ought to understand that
the prudent and wise should be handled with all softnes and gentleness, and that
they should be kept from al shame and wrong. But the doctrine of Solomon is
greatly despised and scorned through the world, as do the wise and faithful
servants of God know and feel. For there is no people in the world how wicked
soever they are, that are so much dishonored as they, and so cruelly
persecuted: yet ought they not to be afraid, but to rejoice: for therein they
are compaignions with the Prophets and Apostles, yea even with our Lord. And
what trouble soever they suffer, they must take good heed from making Solomon
a lier: but their lips must always be found with wisdom. The wise and
faithful Ministers do labor diligently to do this: but most often they
speak unto the walls and pillars, and most commonly they have very small
auditory. Whereupon follows that there are many lewd of heart, the which do
rather deserve to have the rod on their back, and to be sharply corrected,
then to be received and counted wise, and to be admitted into the number of the
household people and children of God.

14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the fool is a present
destruction.
As a wise and discreet householder which is provident, or as a diligent and
faithful Steward does not cast away and despise that which is profitable and
necessary for to maintain his household, but heapeth and gathers together
his provision, lays it up safely, and locketh it up, to use the same in time,
and to distribute it unto his household as they have need, and does not spare
it, least it should wast: even so the wise man and discreet, does not
reiecte and contemn knowledge, the which is a necessary provision, but does
labor to increase and to augment in the same, and does not suffer it to pass
and vanish away, but takes heed least it escape from him, and does shut it up
close with himself by holy meditations in the word, wherein he has al his
delight, and also al his hope. And albeit that he does lock it and shut it up
as in a garner or in a seller, yet is it not to the end, but to make his
neighbors which have need, parteners thereof: but as the good treasure of his
heart does abound, even so does he draw good things out thereof, for to
give spiritual nourishment in time unto the household of his Lord. Solomon
does somewhat signify this same, when he says, That wise men lay up
knowledge: but more plainly, when he said, verse 13. That wisdom is, or
shall be found in the lips of him that has understanding. They that are thus
wise, are worthy to be honored, and to be preserved from danger and
destruction, and to be exempted from al hurt, and that no man should do them
any evil: Solomon does signify it, when setting the fool against the wise,
he says, But the mouth of the fool is a present destruction. The fool has
no knowledge, he can not discern between that which is to be spoken, and
that, that is to be kept secret: for so far is he of from laying up of
knowledge, that rather he scorneth it, and casts it away, and persecuteth
it: and therefore he cannot speak but foolishly, vainly, injuriously, and
wickedly: whereupon follows his destruction sooner then he weeneth and woldeth.
Solomon does declare it, by the destruction near to his mouth: as if he
said, that the fool by his vain babbling, by his folish counsels and
outrageous words, does call and pull destruction upon himself.

Now forasmuch as there is no man of sound judgment that seeks his own
hurt, but that every one does desire to profit, and to be at ease, Solomon
does exhort us to be careful too learn knowledge, and to keep it, and
rather to be ready to hold our peace for to hear and to learn, that we may
grow and increase in discretion and true knowledge, then rashly and amasedly to
speak. Our Lord does teach us the very same, saying, But I say unto you Mat.
12. 36
that of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account
thereof at the day of judgment. Let every man be swift to hear, and slow to
speak. Therefore it is very meet that in Iam. 1. 19.
all our life, we use our tongue soberly, that we be not bablers, hasty and
rash in our words. And chiefly when we take in hand to teach Christian
religion, we must take very good heed least we preach any doctrine whereby we
may hurt the faith of any man. Be not hasty with thy mouth and let not thine
heart speak any thing rashly before God. etc. Let us also learn in this
place, that the Eccle. 5. 1
school doctors do send the people to ruin and destruction, when they forbid
the common people to read the holy Scripture, (which is our true knowledge)
and would have them to remain in ignorance. For it follows well, seeing
Solomon sets the laying up of knowledge against present destruction, that
they which are without knowledge, and make no account thereof, must needs
suffer unrecoverable lostes wherewith God threateneth the people of Israel,
saying, My people perish, because they have no knowledge. And albeit that the
Preachers do daily labor to withdraw us from this Ose. 5. 4. 6
danger by the preaching of the word of truth, yet do they profit very
little: so that we may justly make this complaint, There Ose. 5. 1.
is no truth, there is no mercy, there is no knowledge of God in the land. Let
us note also that when Solomon says, That destruction is present, or at hand,
or near the mouth of the fool, he shows us that in vain the wicked do
promise themselves victory and Lordship, saying, With our tongue we will
prevail. For as Solomon Psalm. 12. 5.
affirms, the punishment shall not be long defferred after the words of the
fool. Also the Psalmist says, Help Lord for the faithful are diminished
from among the children of men. Wherefore Psalm. 12.
let us take heed to lean to the judgment of our eyes, and to the sense of
our flesh for they judge clean contrary to this threatening that Solomon
makes here. After the outward appearance, there are none better welcome then
they which speak evil: and such as lay up knowledge, are refused as the
plague.

15 The rich man's goods, are his strong hold, but their own poverty fears
the poor.
Let us not think that all the sentences of Solomon do expressly contain
commandementes which ought too be obeyed: or doctrine that we ought to
follow: but let us know that some of his sentences do describe unto us the
affections and thoughts and the manners of worldly and carnal men, which are
not renewed by the holy Ghost, and walk after the lusts of the flesh: and so
does paint forth the things which happen, and are daily done in the world.
For the number of the worldlinges and carnal, is without comparison greater
then the number of the children of God which are regenerated by the holy Ghost.
Such sentences are not unprofitable, but fruitful: for they are set forth
for to advertise us of the manners of the world, and that by the knowledge of
them, we should not conform ourselves like unto them, but should labor to be
transfourmed by the renewing of our minds. And so they contain closely good
and necessary doctrine. We have here a sentence of the same kind, the which
does describe the manners of the rich worldlinges, and of the poor sort which
have not their hope in God, but do either trust or tremble according too that
they see with their outward eye. First of all Solomon compares the worldly
rich man, that does trust in his goods and riches, unto a man which dwells
in a City invincible, and which cannot be taken and won: he fears none
evil that should happen unto him, albeit that the strong and mighty enemies
with a great number, do besiege and assault the Town, and do strive what
they can to overthrow and destroy all, and to set all on fire and blood: he
mocketh at his enemies, he passes not a Fig nor philippe for them, and
sets them at naught. If he has hurt his enemies, he fears not for
their reuengement. The worldly rich man esteems his goods as a strong city,
he trusts in his riches, he thinks nothing can hurt him, and that by
them he shall surmount and overcome al encombrances: because of them he
swells and becomes proud: he is so arrogant and high minded that he
cares neither for GOD nor men. Psalm. 10. 2. Psalm. 10. 4. Ps. 37. 16. and 35
The ungodly for his own lust does persecute the poor. Again, The ungodly is
so proud that he cares not for GOD, neither is GOD in all his thoughts. A
small thing that the righteous has is better then great riches of the ungodly.
Again, I my self have seen the ungodly in great power, and flourishing like a
green bay tree I went by, and lo, he was gone: I sought him, but his place
could no where be found. The overthrow of Sodom, the destruction of the
nations at the entering in of the children of Israel into the Land of Canaan,
the taking of the City of Babylon, and other discomfitures do show us that
the rich do deceive themselves, trusting in their riches, and waxing proud
because of them, when they ought to weep: and chiefly when they abuse them.
For they cannot but look for all misery, ruin and destruction: as Saint Iam.
5. 1.
James does show saying, Go too now ye rich men weep and houle on your
wretchedness that shall come upon you. Your riches is corrupt, your garments
are motheaten. Your gold and silver are cankered, and the rust of them shall be
witness unto you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. And therefore our
Lord does Luke. 12. 15.
admonish us, to take heed and beware of covetousness. For no man's life
stands in the abundance of the things which he possesses.

He shows us also how we must use our riches, saying, make you friends of
the unrighteous mammon, that when ye shall have Luke. 16* 9. 1. Tim. 6. 17.
need, they may receive you into everlasting habitatio^s. And S. Paul says,
charge the^ which are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor
thrust in uncertain riches, but in the living GOD, (which gives us abundantly
al things to enjoy the^:) that they do good, that they be rich in good works,
that they be ready to give, and gladly to distribute, laying up in store for
them a good foundation against the time to come, that they may obtain eternal
life. Albeeit then that Solomon does not give us here express commandment
that we should not trust nor delight ourselves in our riches: yet ought we to
understand it, when he describes the manners, and expresses the thoughts of
the rich, the which the Lord does often break and overthrow: as we may
plainly see it in many. We must also understand, that by this description
Solomon blames and condemns the pride and arrogance of the rich, their
foolish trust and vain confidence. Against the which he sets the weakness,
the distrust and the fear of them which are not contented with the poverty
that God pleases to send them, when he says, but their own poucrtie
fears the poor. Wherein he painteth out the inward disposition and nature
of the^ which have set their desire on riches, and cannot attain unto them,
neither sees any means to obtain the^. They are astonished and afraid, they
abhor poverty, and do greatly fear they shall want. They are continually
tossed with such thoughts and purposes, which does discourage them and make
them despair. Behold how the covetous power, and such as have set their
hearts on riches, are affectioned, and also the rich which never have enough,
and fear least the earth should fail: Although Solomon count their riches a
strong city for the worldlinges which have not the knowledge of GOD, are never
stayed, but have very much fear, and never have so much that they say we have
enough: In this sort though they be rich yet are they poor and miserable,
having their minds never satisfied. This same is set before us, that if riches
do abound, we should not set our hearts upon them to be puffed up with
pride therefore, or with vain confidence: and if poverty prick us, that we
should not be oppressed with fear nor with despair, but should be assured
that they which do evil, shall be rooted out, etc. Again, a small thing that
the righteous has, is better then Ps. 37. 9. 16. 32
great riches of the ungodly. Again, The steps of man are directed by the
Lord. Again, Let us know, that godliness is 1. Timo. 6. 6. Heb. 13. 5. Job.
1. 21. and. 2 10.
great riches, if a man be content with that he has. And let us follow that
which S. Paul teaches, let your conversation be without covetousness. Let us
say also with Job, Naked came I out of my moothers womb, and al naked shall I
return thither again. Shall we receive prosperity at the hand of God, and
not receive adversity also? Let us further note also, that the opinion of the
rich is false, as our Lord does show, I tell you truly, it is very Mat. 19.
23. Luke. 12. 16. and. 16. 19.
hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. To this purpose
also apperteineth the parable of the man whose field brought forth a treasure
of gold, whereof he rejoiced: And of the rich glutton.

16 The righteous labors to do good, but the ungodly uses his increase unto
sin.
When men occupy themselves and take some work in hand, they seek to profit
and gain thereby: but oftentimes they deceive themselves. For none but good
people do truly prosper in their affairs: though man's reason do judge the
contrary. As touching the wicked, what gain soever they get, and what joy
soever they have, yet does it all turn unto their hurt. It seems good to
outward appara^ce that good people are most miserable, and that there are noone
more unhappy and cursed then they in all the world: but Solomon which lies
not, does show us their prosperity, when he attributes life unto the work
of the righteous: as if he did say, that the just man does not apply himself
unto any work, but unto that which is the path way that leads unto life.
Contrarily, after the outward sight, the wicked reap great profit by the
works they take in hand: but their destruction which is great: is at hand,
utterly to beat them down. Solomon does signify the same unto us, when he
says, that the ungodly uses his increase unto sin: For the reward of sin
is death. But as the work of the righteous does not profit himself alone,
but does serve to the releeuing Romans 6. 23.
of others: even so the evil manners of the wicked do stir up others unto
sin: whereupon follows death. And forasmuch as we al desire to live, and
do abhor death, let us follow the work of the righteous, let us worship one
only God according unto his word, flying from al idolatry, and forsaking al
doubt and distrust, and doing unto our neighbors as, we would they should
do unto us. In this manner the work of the righteous shall be life unto us. And
let us not desire to be partakers with the unfruitful works of darkness,
which are the reuenewe of the wicked, but let us rather reprove them, least
they be imputed unto us for sin, whereof follows damnation. But although
we desire life, yet do we not regard to follow the works of the
righteous: for we believe not, that in following it, we should obtain life:
seeing that as it is written, we see by experience that the afflictions of the
just are many in number: they are exercised by many miseries and tribulations,
and seem that they are in death and that they are destitute of all help.
Wherefore their workes' Psalm. 34. 20.
and sayings are thought to be unprofitable. As when Saul persecuted David,
for to destroy him, and compelled him to fly and too run away, no man would
have thought, that what shifte soever he could make, that he should escape
the hands of Saul, and live to become king of Israel. Likewise, when Jesus
Christ was seen to hang on the cross as a thief, they thought him clean
destroyed: and did not think that he should ascend unto the glory of his
father, nor that his Gospel should be preached through all the world. And
so their works were not seen but to serve to life for themselves and for
others. And at all times men have judged, and still do judge thus of the
faithful. Contrarily, because the wicked are strong, and floorishe with glory
and riches of this world, it seems that they ought to come to the end of
their desire, and of that they take in hand, without hinderance and let, and
that none should withstand them. Pharao and his folk thought that they should
oppress the people of Israel at their pleasure: but the issue and en de
showed the clean contrary: for the people of GOD rejoiced at their
deliverance, and Pharao and his people made a miserable end amongst the waves
of the Sea. The work of Moses and Aaron, and of such as obeyed, tended to
life: and Pharao with his people received the reward of sin, that is to say,
death. Thus the work of the righteous serves to life: for although he fall
into diverse dangers, and is many ways pursued, yet finally, and in the end
he shall be delivered, and his works, his doctrine, and his counsels shall bring
both himself and his neighbors life. Contrarily, God curses the actions and
counsels of the wicked, when he counts, whatsoever they do and say, to be
sin, and consequently worthy of death. This same is well described unto us
in the first Psalm. Let us further note, that albeit it is true, that the
righteous does not labor couetously, nor to get estimation, but only to
employ the time unto good works, and to have necessary things belonging to
this life, as well for himself as for his family: yet Solomon his mind and
intent is not such here, as we may know by the second part of his sentence,
wherein he opposes and sets the reuenewe of the wicked against the work
and labor of the righteous; and sin which brings death, against life. And
albeit that God does give us this honor by his word to attribute life unto
the works and labor: yet let us not think that they are worthy thereof, and
deserve thereby: but let us in any wise confess the grace and mercy of God,
which is true in his promises: for the which to fulfill, he does thus reward
our good works whereof he himself is the only author, and we but his
instruments and servants.

17 He that regards instruction, is in the way of life: but he that refuses
correction, goes out of the way of life.
For to show us the way of life, Solomon in the fourth Chapter and first
verse, has showed us, saying, Hear, O ye children, the instruction of a
father, etc. And to the admonition, has added the promise in the 4. and 6.
verses. Also in the 13. verse he repeateth again the self same admonition,
and thereto also has added the promise. The said admonition so often
rehearsed, should suffice to induce us to receive and keep the instruction
which is given us by the Lord: and aso the promise so often repeated, ought to
be sufficient to assure us of the goodness of GOD toward us, and to make us
more inclined to submit ourselves unto the good will of GOD. But we are dull
upon the spur, and for one admonition or twain, we make no account to give
obedience: and for one or two promises, we cannot be assured of the
infallible truth of GOD: so full of rebellion and disobedience we are and so
full of doubtfulnesse and distrust: and therefore we have need that we should
be handled according unto our rudeness and infirmity. The which our Lord does
in his holy word, and also by the peaching of the same word, in the which one
self doctrine is often repeted. For this cause Solomon is not negligent often to
tell us one very thing: and that which he has already said many times
heretofore, he repeateth, saying, To take heeds etc. This affirmation
contains an instruction and promise: for by affirming it, he would have us to
understand that he does admonish us to keep the instruction, and that he
does promise us life. And therewith he teaches us too know who is righteous
and what his work is, that serves unto life. Whereupon we may gather, that
he is righteous, which with an unfeigned heart labors to give obedience
unto the word of God, and does wholly depend upon the free promises of God.
This is to keep instruction, and not to labor to deserve by works, as do
the proud Papists: nor to think that faith only without works is enough to
salvation, as do the sloth full think, which love works already done, and
such as desire the liberty of the flesh. For two sorts of people are out of
the way of life: for the one sort are proud, and the other are vain, and both
are blind, and deceive themselves: they think to be in the way of life, and
they tend unto death: they are companions of them which forsake correction, of
whom Solomon says, that they are out of the way. They do refuse to be
reformed, which make no account to amend their lives, what aduertismente
soever is made unto them out of the word: but the one sort does more slip
and slide away, murmuring and despiting them which do refourme and reprove
them. Some willing to show themselves holy and devout, do make themselves
believe that they shall not fail in following of their good intentes and
fantasies, and the traditions and good customs of their fathers: And the other
sort which are delicate, and desire to rest in peace, do content themselves
to have a light opinion of the Iam. 2. 19.
word, and do call the same faith: as does Saint James grant them, even
such as have the devils. Al such kinds of people do refuse to be reformed,
and do wander out of the way of life, and so run unto death. Wherefore
forasmuch as we abhor death, and desire life, let us not be like unto such
folks, but let us take heed to instruction, and not refuse to be reformed.
For to do this same well let us receive the word of truth, which is the seed
of life, Let us take al our joy and delight therein, in obeying the
commandementes, of the Lord, and by cleaning fast unto his promises by faith,
being assured of his fatherly goodness to wards us. Let us be patient in
afflictions from what side soever they come, knowing that it is GOD our Father
and Savior, that does chasten us, partly for to admonish us that we have
offended him, and that we should return unto him to ask pardon, and
deliverance from these afflictions: partly to prove our faith and patience,
and to make us know how weak and frail we be, that feeling our necessity,
we should run unto him for his help. And if we think that he differreth
his help so long that we should not be discouraged through despair: but with all patience we should look for his help, the which shall not be wanting at
Esaias. 30. 1^.
time convenient.

Thus doing, we shall keep instruction, and shall not forsake correction, as did
the children of Israel, who seeing themselves pressed with necessity in the
wilderness, did murmr and bewail the country of Egypt, and also when they
were pressed with their enemies, they had their refuge not unto God, but unto
the help of men against Gods commandment.

18 He that does dissemble hatred, with lying lips, and he that inuenteth
slander, is a fool.
When one man belieth another, he puts himself in danger to bear some
evil: for oftentimes he which does slander, is moved with anger, and is
ready to stryke or to kill. It is more often seen then were needful: and
albeeit that every man is a liar: yet is there none but desires to be counted
true, and the greatest liars shall be they which will be most desirous to
maintain their honor, and to revenge themselves if they be painted such as
they be, and be told to their face. Now forasmuch as it is so, that we
would not abide to be called liars, amongst other vices we must eschew
dissimulation and hypocrisy, we must take heed to feign to love the^ whom we
hate, otherwise we belie the holy Ghost which speaks by the mouth of Solomon:
and further we do resemble Judas, which by a kiss and fained salutation
betrayed the innocent blood. Also when they which hate their neighbors,
dissemble the hatred by fair words, and goodly show, they are liars, and
consequently murderers. And thus Solomon does express but one part of their
style, attributing unto them false and lying lips: but he does not express
so small thing but that he accuses them of a crime worthy of death. Thou shall
destroy them which speak leasing. But albeit to avoid lying and treason, we
must not Psalm. 5. 7.
dissemble hatred, yet is it not to say, that it is laweful to speak evil of
our neighbor, when we hate him. It is the part of fools to babble out what
they have in their heart against their neighbors. Solomon does signify it,
saying, And he that speaks, etc. They which are so ready to slander their
neighbors, whither it be wrongfully or that they have some occasion, are as
much, or more guilty then they which dissemble. For first of al they are led
with hatred by so speaking, which is equal with murder, or at the least by
such hatred men are stirred up thereunto. Whosoever is angry with his brother
unadvisedly, shall be worthy of judgment. Mat. 5. 22.
Secondly, they slander most often, not caring what they say, so that they may
do injury to their neighbors, and hurt their good name in belying them
falsely against their conscience: so much are they kindled with anger and with
evil affection. Thirdly, no thank to them that their neighbors, whom they
blame, are not hurt both in their bodies and in their goods. And therefore,
when Solomon calls such slaunderers, fools, we must not understand that
he speaks of the simple and idiotes, which utter whatsoever comes in their
mouth, without good consideration of that which they speak and promise: but
he speaks of them which through disdain of wisdom, of correction and
counsel, and through hatred that they have to their neighbors, do maliciously
speak, and do lie by slaundering wittingly. Such are wicked fools, and do
well deserve to be called fools, for they are destitute of wisdom and
understanding. These are of the number of them that wisdom reprooueth and
threateneth, in the first chapter and 22. verse.

But when Solomon does accuse him that does dissemble hatred of lying and
falshoode, it is not to say that it is lawefull for us too show unto our
neighbors that we hate them, but rather we must learn to purge and cleanse
us of al wrath and indignation, displeasure, envy malice and of al desire to
hurt our neighbors, to the end that we may speak truly to our neighbors
without deceit and without fraud, and that we should eschew the accusation
of lying whereunto Saint Paul does admonish us: Cast of the old man, which
is corrupt through the deceiuable Ephe. 4. 22. and 29.
lusts. Again, Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths: but
that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
hearers. But now put ye away even al these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnes,
cursed and filthy speaking out of your mouths.

Likewise though that Solomon calls him fool which slaundereth, yet it is
not to say that the Pastors and ministers of the Collo. 3. 8.
word ought to abstain from blaming and reproouing of vices and of them that
are hardened therein: otherwise they should deserve to be called fools. Noe
the ambassador of righteousness, by the building of the arc condemned the
world. Moses the servant and Prophet of the Lord did reprove the people of
Israel for their disobedience. The Prophets have reproved in diverse sorts.
We may see how our Lord Jesus has showed himself sharp in chiding and
rebuking the Scribes and Pharisees. Saint Paul also, and Saint Peter, and
Saint James, and Saint Jude do reprove and openly blame them which resist the
truth, and lead a dissolute and slanderous life. And our Lord commands the
incorrigible to be put over unto the Church: the which cannot be without
rebuking them of their vices wherein they are obstinate and indurate: it
should be very rashly done of us, if for the saying of Solomon we should call
al these same and other which follow them, fools: we should deprave the
scripture, the which calls them fools which through hatred do rebuke their
neighbors, and not them which by their reprehensions, threats and
accusations, do labor to reduce the strayed sheep.

19 In many words there cannot want iniquity: but he that refraineth his
lips, is wise.
They that have a tongue at large to speak readily, delight much to speak,
and take pleasure also in their eloquence: they mock at them which are slow
and dull of speech: esteeming them of no wit: and whiles they prate at
pleasure, they would be counted witty and learned, and do think themselves
cunning folk. And by how much as a man is more vain in his words, by so
much the more does he desire to be accounted of them, which hear him,
albeeit he know that his words bring no profit nor edification. And also the
common people is easy to have them in estimation which flow in eloquence, and
do think al well said that such people say: but such tongue men do fail,
and those which hear them are deceived. Solomon does signify the same, when
he says, Where much, etc.

And forasmuch as al vices are to be fled, we must take heed that we use
our tongues soberly in private communication, and to give ourselves to jest and
to babble at pleasure. And therein to consume much time unprofitably, as do
idle and curious folks, and chiefly maids and wives. Being idle, they learn
to go from 1. Tim. 5. 13.
house to house. The keepers of Tauerns, which spend the goods of God in
gluttony and drunkenness, and the common players are stuffed with many words,
not only vain and unfruitful, but hurtful and injurious, and also full of
horrible blasphemies. Merchants and handicraftes men, and almost as many as
have intercourse or any thing to break unto their neighbors, or lawiers and
suitors, will not briefly tell and plainly declare the truth of the matter: but
to blind and dasel men's eyes, they will have tricks and knackes in their budget
worthy to be mocked at, and to astonishe the ears of men, they will flow in
superfluous and ungodly words, with lying, perjury, slaundering, with cursing
and giving themselves unto the Devil, even to the renouncing and forsaking of
God: and as they themselves do, so do they teach their children and
household folks to do the like. We have experience then in diverse ways, and
more then were needful, that there is vice and offense in many words. And if
for to avoid to be guilty of this vice, we must be fober and discreet in
our common and household talk, when we commen and confer together of things
which concern and touch this present life: by a more stronger reason we must
be well advised to place our words, and to talk no uncomely thing, when we
treat of matters concerning GOD, and which concern the honor and glory of
GOD, and the salvation of our souls: as when we take in hand to teach the
people, when we make our prayers unto GOD, when we give him thanks and sing
praises unto him, then must we take heed to use many words, otherwise we
should commit a vice, for the which we should not go unpunished: and that
for good cause, when by such vice GOD is greatly dishonored, and we and our
neighbors both in danger of loosing our souls. Wherefore we ought to
understand that it is necessary to fly and abhor the custom of the
greatest part of the world, the which is replenished with false teachers,
deceivers, idolaters, with superstitious, with dreamers and hypocrites, the
which abound in words: the one sort in hurtful talk, and the other in
unprofitable, vain and superfluous talk. Our Lord does show us well that
we must not believe nor follow them. Take heed and beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and Saducees. Their doctrine is very hurtful. Woe therefore be
unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye shut up Math. 19. 6.
Mat. 23. 13. and. 24. 4. 11.
the kingdom of heaven before men. Take heed that no man deceive you. Again,
And many false Prophets shall arise, and shall deceive many. Now I beseech
you brethren, mark them diligently which cause division and offenses, contrary
to the doctrine Romans 16. 17. Mat. 6. 5.
which ye have learned. And when thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites: for
they love to stand, and pray in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the
streets, because they would be seen of men. Al such kind of people ought
to be eschued and fled, except we will declare ourselves to be blind and
beasts, as they are without understanding: Let them alone, they be the blind,
leaders of the Mat. 15. 14.
blind: etc. Now the end of the commandment is love. Solomon does also
partly signify it, when he attributes wisdom and understanding unto him
which takes heed of talking, saying, but he that refrayneth his lips, is
wise. We must therefore (to eschew vice, and to show ourselves wise,) be
sober in talk, and that we utter not al things that come into our thought. Yet
notwithstanding we must not spare our tongues when need is, but must unfold
them for the glory and honor of GOD, and for the profit and edification of
our neighbors. We see in the holy scriptures, that the servants of GOD have
abounded with words in their sermons, praises, and prayers and thanks
giving, and no fault nor vice has been in them. For as wise men, they knew
to refrain their lips, speaking nothing but that wherewith they were divinely
inspired by the spirit of the Lord.

20 The tongue of the just man, is fined silver: but the heart of the ungodly
is nothing worth.
Solomon does compare the tongue of the righteous unto the pure silver, unto
the silver that is separated from al matter that may hinder the knowledge of
his goodness and preciousnesse, when it is mineral, and has not passed
through the fire. It is not without cause that he makes this comparison: for
as men do naturally desire such kind of silver, even so the tongue of the
righteous is greatly to be desired of them which love the true riches which
proceed from wisdom and innocence, For the mouth of the righteous will talk
of wisdom, and his tongue shall declare that which is right. And also, Blessed
is the man that finds Psalm. 37. 30.
wisdom, and the man that utters knowledge. And as the pure silver is
carefully kept, and is not gladly employed indifferently to al uses: even so
the righteous, because he is wise, refraineth his lips, and does not unfold
his tongue for every matter: but as the precious silver is not employed, but
when it is very needful, or about things of great importance, or there where a
man will be seen and get reputation: even so the righteous takes heed to
employ well his tongue unto the glory of GOD, and instruction of his neighbors,
and not to offend thereby, wherewith he wins reputation, and is greatly
esteemed of the faithful which have knowledge of the truth. Contrarily, he
compares the heart of the wicked unto nothing, or little worth: and that
rightly. For as we do naturally desire abundance of things that we think
to be necessary and profitable, and do disdain and refuse that which
serves for nothing, or is little worth: even so although that the ungodly do
praise and boast themselves, and that their heart is haughty and sowln, and
that they judge that they ought to be praised: yet God who knows the hearts,
does well see that there is nothing in the heart of the ungodly that is any
thing worth, and therefore does he disdain them, and does abhor them, so
do they also that are led by the spirit of God. For by the outward things, is
the vanity of the heart known. And as we are wont not to spare the things
that are nothing esteemed, or smally, but leave them at randon, even so the
wicked do unfold in every matter the vanity of their heart, and care not what
they do, nor what they say: they have no right thoughts: whereupon follows
that their heart is nothing worth, and that they cannot do nor say any thing
that is ought worth. Naturally we are al such, and have need that GOD by his
holy spirit should purge, amend, and renew our hearts, otherwise our
tongues, which from the abundance of the heart do speak, shall not be as
pure and tried silver, but our vain and unprofitable hearts shall spur
forewarde our tongues to speak things nothing worth, and the rest of our
members to do unprofitable and hurtful things. If we have desire that God
should work in us by his holy spirit, we must be attentive unto his
word. For as the words of the Lord are called pure Psalm. 12. 7.
as the silver which from the earth is tried and purified seven times in the
fire: even so the law of the Lord is said to be undefiled. Wherefore
besides the former expositions we may say, that as there is no deceit in fine
silver, but that it is true and tried, neither may Psalm. 19. 8.
any man deny to receive and employ it: even so the righteous instructed and
taught in the pure and clean word of GOD, the which does not deceive the^
that put their trust therein, have a pure and clean tongue, neither is their
fraud in his mouth, but speaks the truth from his heart, and that freely.
Contrarily, as by a thing of nothing which has some fair show, the
indiscreet are deceived, even so the ungodly do invent nothing but deceit
and hurt against their neighbors. And as the just which by his tongue seeks
nothing but the glory and honor of God, and the edification of his Church,
ought to be heard and received, and his sayings obeyed, as if God himself did
speak: even so ought we to be careful to take heed of the wicked, and
chiefly of the ministers of Satan which do change themselves like ministers
of light, and do labor but to seduce the hearts of the innocents. For other
deceiptes can bring no hurt but to the temporal goods or to the bodies: but
the ministers of Satan destroy for ever both the bodies and souls of so many
as believe and reverence them, and follow their doctrine. This last exposition
agrees well with the sentence that follows, when Solomon says,

21 The lips of the righteous feed a whole multitude: but fools shall die
for want of wisdom.
In what state soever we be, if we be righteous, we will labor to hurt no
man by our words, but will delight to speak truth, and by the same to profit
many, in giving good counsel, in exhorting, admonishing, rebuking, reproouing
and correcting. This truth is the food of life, the incorruptible seed which
quickens a man for ever. For man lives not only by bread, but by every
word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Likewise the Gospel, which is
the infallible truth, is compared unto a wedding, Deuteronomy. 8. 3.
unto the which many be called. And the ministers which declare this Gospel
are called Pastors: and in the person of Saint Peter Jesus Christ commands
them to feed his sheep: And, so much as in John. 21. 15. 1. Pet. 5. 2. Acts.
20. 28
you lies, feed the flock of Christ. Take heed to yourselues and to all the
flock, whereof the holy Ghost has made you ouerseeers. And as the Ministers of
the Church by their preaching do feed the believers unto eternal life (for
the Gospel is the power of God to save al them that believe) even so those
Princes and superiors which pronounce good, just and upright, sentences, for
to give right unto him that it belongs unto, and do diligently watch over
the slanders and offenses, proclaming holy ordinances for to establish a
sound ecclesiastical policy, do feed many so much as in them is: even so
do al heads of household, when no evil word does proceed out of their mouth,
but do speak very wisely and godly. And as through them many are fed and
quickened, even so also they feed themselves, and deliver themselves from
death. But they that are so cold and faintharted, that they despise al
honesty and holy religion, and care not though they offend and destroy their
neighbors: as by their wicked words proceeding from the weakness and
faintness of heart they lead many unto death, feeding them with poison so much
as lies in them: so also shall not they be spared, but by the just vengeance
of GOD they shall dye, as they deserve. These are the fools whereof Solomon
says that they shall dye through their own folly.

22 The blessing of the Lord makes rich men: and he does add no sorrows
with it.
Every man naturally desires to be rich and to abound with temporal goods,
not only for to maintain this life in a mean estate: but also to nourishe
himself in pleasures and voluptuousness, to keep great cheer and to be
apparelled sumptuously, and to be magnified and exhalted, and to enjoy in this
world all pleasures that are possible. And to the end to attain theretoo,
we labor with body and soul, we bestow our bodily labor, and set al our
mind on work to see and consider how we may become rich. And because we
commonly see that fools and ydiottes, the negligent and slouthful the faint
and weak to be poor, and that they have great need, it seems that man by
his wisdom and policy, by his force and strength, by his labor and
travail does become rich. For this cause man does attribute unto his power
the goods and riches that he possesses, and thinks that they are due unto
him and that he has well deserved them. But in it there is nothing but vanity
without any profit. I made gorgious and fair works, says Solomon in
Ecclesiastes the second chapter, etc. But when I considered all the works
that my hands had Eccle. 2. 4.
wrought, and all the labor that I had taken therein: lo, al was but vanity
and vexation of mind: for in this sort man does not acknowledge GOD as it
behooves. When he sees himself to abound in riches, he ought not to be
like unto swine which always have their snout in the ground til they find
acornes, and look not up from whence they falto the ground: but he ought to
lift up the eyes of his mind, and to behold the heaven, and to confess that
the goods he has, though he have found them in earth, and are brought out of
the earth: yet that they descended from heaven, and are given unto him of the
mere liberality of God, who makes al things to grow for the use of man. GOD
said, Let the earth bring forth green herb, etc. Again, He Genesis 1. 11.
28. and. 9. 3. and. 14. 20. Genesis 18. 3.
blessed them, and said, grow and increase, etc. And I have given every
green thing to be meat unto you, etc. The holy Patriarks have well
acknowledged this power and liberality. Abraham did well show it when he gave
tithes, and would not be enriched with the goods of the Sodomites, and when he
received the Angels and 28. 20.
and entreated them gently. It is also said of Jacob that he made a vow,
saying, If the Lord will be with me, and keep me in my journey which I go,
and will give me bread to eat, and clothes to put on, so that I come again
unto my fathers house in safety, then shall the Lord be my God, etc. Again he
himself says: O God of my Father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac: Lord
which and 32 9.
says unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do
al well with thee, etc. The Lord is he that kills and makes alive again.
Now also Solomon does confess it, when 1. Sam. 2. 6.
he says, That the blessing of the Lord makes rich, etc. If any man then
be rich, the same comes, because God has extended his blessing upon him.
Thus riches ought not to be attributed either to the labor, or wisdom, or
industry or diligence and care of men, either to fortune or chance by
adventure, as do the infidels: but we should acknowledge and confess that as
God Psalm. 24. 1.
is the Creator both of heaven and of earth, and of al things in them
contained, and that the earth with the contents there of does appertain unto
him, even so he distributeth the things of this world as he pleases, and
to whom he pleases. After that he has made a man rich, at his pleasure he
takes away the same again, and makes him poor, and gives it unto another.
Job says in his first chapter, The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken:
and that which was taken from him, was to make thieves and robbers rich. In
this sort we confess that God not only blesses the faithful and just, but
also the wicked and unthankful: as says our Lord, he makes the Sun to
rise both upon the good and badde. But he does this, partly to make himself
known, Mat. 5. 45.
how he has not left himself without witness of doing us good. etc.

And this is also to the end to take away excuse from the unthankful. Act.
14. 17. Romans 1. 18.
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against al ungodliness, and
unrighteousness of men, which with hold the truth invnrighteousnesse.
Secondly, to the end that the children Mat. 5. 44.
of God should follow their Father in well doing to their enemies. Thirdly,
that the elect of God seeing and beholding the great benefits that the Lord
pours upon the wicked, and comparing their afflictions with them, they should
learn how they ought to hope for a much better life then have the most
blessed of this world, otherwise the state of Gods children should be worse
then the same of the wicked. Wherefore, the confiscations and forfeitures that
the tyrants make now adays, should rather rejoice the afflicted, Mat. 5. 11.
I am. 1. 2.
then grieve and vex them. Thus, albeeit the tyrants, do persecute bannishe,
steal and pilfer from the children of GOD, and that God does so suffer them,
yea that he has so ordained, yet is it not to say that God has deprived his
children of his blessing. For Romans 8. 31. 1. Cor. 10. 13.
what temptation soever he sends unto his household folks and children, yet
does he not cease to love them, If God be on our side, who shall be against us?
God is faithful which will not suffer you to be tempted above that you be able,
but will even give the issue with the temptation, that ye may be able to be are
it.

Let us therefore understand that God noth never so spoil his children, but
that he leaves them sufficient goods. For, a small thing that the righteous
has, is better then great riches of the ungodly. Also they which have their
hope in the Lord, as they are not forsaken Psalm. 37. 16.
of him, (as it is written in the former psalm, I have bin young and now old,
yet saw I never the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread etc.)
so do they acknowledge, and truly confess the blessing of God by being
contented, and thinking themselves rich enough. The which contentation they
show by not stealing, but doing good unto their neighbors. For as it is said
a little after, The righteous is ever merciful, and lends, and his seed is
blessed. Psalm. 37. 26.
Now the blessing of God upon the faithful, is not much seen unto the eyes:
for they seem to be most miserable of any in all the world: but what evil or
poverty soever happen unto them, their state is far more better then the
same of the most richest which are not stayed upon the Lord. For the
unfaithful are possessours of an evil faith: albeeit that by the blessing of
GOD they are rich, and do enjoy goods, not knowing from whence they proceed,
and do use them without the promise of GOD: And because they usurp the goods
that belong not unto them, they shall ere it be long and sooner then they
think for, be deprived of this temporal benediction. For the wicked dooers
shall be rooted out: and which is far worse, they shall in no wise be
partakers Psa. 37. 9.
of this precious blessing of the kingdom of heaven, and of eternal life. As
for the transgressors, they shall perish together, Psa. 37. 38.
and the end of the ungodly, is, they shall be rooted out at the last. Likewise
they whom GOD judges not worthy of the temporal promises, cannot look for
any other felicity then that they have in this life. But the faithful which
have the promise of this present life, do know that what poverty soever they
suffer in this world, yet they are rich enough: for they are Lords of all the
world, though they do not visibly enjoy them. For they understand well that
the promise is not made unto them to hold and stay their minds upon these
vain and transitory things: but to the end that with all their heart they
should aspire after the heavenly riches, which shall endure eternally. And also
to lead them theretoo the Lord does not suffer them to live at their ease,
in pleasures and carnal delights after the lusts thereof, but most often he
does compass them with great and many afflictions. Notwithstanding, GOD
cease not to perform his promise, giving them worldly substance, so much as
is necessary for their spiritual and eternal salvation, the which cannot fail
them, seeing they are owners and heirs by the promise. The old and ancient
fathers did thus understand Heb. 11. 13.
it. Wherefore the faithful being poor and miserable in the eyes of men, do
not cease to be rich by the blessing of the Lord, whereby they shall receive
the crown of glory.

And forasmuch as it is so that the blessing of the Lord makes men rich: Let
us first of all know, that we possess nothing, how small soever it be, but
that we must give thanks unto God for the same. David in his 34. Psalm does
point us the way: and Saint Paul does admonish us, that we should give
thank for all things. Secondly, forasmuch as there proceeds no evil thing
from the blessing of God, it follows that riches are good, and that it is
lawful to possess them, and to use them with joy and gladness. For every
creature of God is good, and nothing ought 1. Tim. 4. 4.
to be refused, if it be received with thanks giving. Nevertheless we must
take heed to abuse the blessing of God. And for to observe this, we must look
that we possess nothing unjustly gotten, least we be like unto thieves,
robbers, rouers, covetous usurers, and false packing merchantes: but in steed
of spoiling and catching, let us distribute part of that which we possess,
and that we walk uprightly and faithfully in all our affairs: and for to
come well to the end hereof, we must follow the counsel of the Psalmist. O
trust not in wrong and robbery, give not yourselues unto Psalm. 62. 11.
vanity: If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. For if we set not
our hearts upon riches, we do not possess the^ as the blessing of the Lord:
and for our unthankfulness we deprive ourselves of the heavenly and
everlasting blessing. How hardly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of
heaven? They that will Mar. 10. 23. 1. Timo. 6. 9.
be rich, fall into temptation and snares, and into many foolish, and
noisome lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction. We must also
look that we use not the riches of God dissolutely and vntemperately, as do
the gluttons and drunkardes, brave and prodigal Gentlemen, which cannot
soberly and temperately rejoice, but have a beastly and arrogant joy: but we
must use them, rejoicing ourselves in the presence of the Lord. For to do
this well, we must not eat so much meat, nor exceed Leu. 23.
in costly and gorgeous apparel, but that we should think on the needy,
and chiefly on the household of faith. For if to be like unto our heavenly
father, we ought too do good unto our enemies, by a more strong reason we
must be careful of them which do love us in Jesus Christ, and to spare the
morsel out of our own mouth for to give it them, and to do with a good heart
and free will. Thus we must rejoice in using the blessing of the Lord.
Thirdly, forasmuch as the blessing makes rich, it follows that we may
ask riches of God, so far as is needeful to help our necessity. Our Lord
does teach it us, when he would have us to ask our daily bread. But also we
must consider that Mat. 6. 11.
when he adds, This day, he would not that we should desire to become
rich, but as Saint Paul does teach us, that having 1. Tim. 6. 8. Heb. 23. 5.
meat and clothing, we should be therewith content. Let your conversation be
without covetousness, being contented with that which you have already. Albeit
then that it is lawful for us to ask riches of God, which may suffice to keep
us in this life, that having things necessary for us, we may the better
follow our vocation: yet is it not laweful for us to covet riches, as has
been already alleged. For take heed, and beware of covetousness, Luke. 12.
14.
says the Lord. Fourthly, let us know, that it is not in the power of man to
make himself rich, but that he must receive al from the gracious and liberal
hand of God. And if man cannot do the lesser, he has no power to do the
greater. Whereupon follows that it is not in the power of man to make
himself rich with spiritual riches, which serve to preserve the soul, and
make it to obtein eternal life. It is not then in man's own power to come
unto the kingdom of heaven. Behold what we must learn, when Solomon does
say unto us, that the blessing of the Lord makes men rich. And let us also
learn that if God bless us, that according to his liberality and blessing
bestowed upon us, we must bless our needy neighbors by doing good unto them.
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, and
that they trust not in uncertain riches, but in the living GOD, (which gives
abundantly all things to enjoy.) That they do good and be rich in good
works, and ready to 1. Tim. 6. 17
distribute, and communicate. That which we distribute to the poor, S. Paul
calls it a blessing or a benevolence: wherefore I thought it necessary to
exhort the brethren to come before unto you, and 2. Cor. 9. 5.
to finishe your benevolence appointed before, that it might be ready, and come
as of benevolence, and not as of niggardlines. Thereupon Solomon does say, that
the lord does not give trouble with his blessing. But at the first sight, the
contrary may seem true: for he has not altogether spoiled man of his
blessing: and yet, though he had sinned, and had deserved to be deprived of al
goodness, the Lord has given him of them abundantly: but yet he has said
unto him, Because thou have obeyed the voice of thy wife, etc. the earth shall be
Genesis 3. 17.
accursed for thy sake. He enriched the Patriarchs the which lived not without
trouble, as may be seen by the history of their life. He blessed David with
riches, and exalted him, ordeyning him king in Israel: but before that he
attained unto it, he suffered very much: and after that he was exalted, he
had much trouble, and that by the means of his own blood. And our Lord Jesus
does not promise any riches unto his faithful people, but with condition of
persecution. And also, he would that we al should bear our Mar. 10. 13.
Luke. 9. 23.
cross. I answer, that the blessing of God does not exempt the faithful from
afflictions in their flesh, and that they should not suffer much trouble in
this world: for let us know that the afflictions of this present time are not
worthy of the glory which shall be Romans 8. 18.
showed unto us, they bear them with patience and joy, and are at peace and
quietness in their consciences: and are assured of the goodness and love of
God toward them, they say with David, The Lord is my sheephearde, therefore
shall I want nothing. Ps. 23. 1. and. 27 1. and 34, 18.
The Lord is my light etc. When the righteous cry unto the Lord, he hears
them, and does deliver them out of al their troubles. Yea though he should
kill me, yet will I put my thrust in Job. 13. 15.
him, says Job.

Contrarily, albeeit that the ungodly, which do not acknowledge the goodness
and blessing of GOD, do greatly prosper in the outward sight of the world
(for it is said that they feel no trouble, etc.) yet so much as in them
lies, they refuse and reject the blessing of GOD, and are also greatly
troubled in their consciences, and are much vexed in their minds: they have no
peace nor quietness in their understanding. The wicked are like the raging
sea, which cannot rest, whose waterfometh Esaias. 57. 20.
with the mire and grauel. Even so the wicked have nopeace says God.

23 It is pastime to a fool to do wickedly: but wisdom is understanding to a
man.
When we have committed any faults and offenses, how small and little soever
they be, and be it that we have offended and sinned by infirmity or malice,
by ignorance or of set purpose to do evil, it is necessary we should know
that we have grievously offended, forasmuch as we have transgressed the law
of our God, the which is so holy, good and just. And upon the knowledge hereof,
we must tremble and be afraid of the righteous judgment of God, the which we
have deserved that he should pour upon us and exercise against us his wrath
and anger, and that he should no whit spare us, but damn and destroy us: and
being thus feared, that we may be brought to say without color and
faynednesse with David, Correct me not in thy wrath, O Lord, nor chasten
Psalw. 38. 2.
me not in thy heavy displeasure. It is also necessary for us that such a
fear should lead us, not to a despair, as it did Judas, but unto a grief
and sorrow which may make us hate the evil that we have committed, and to
detest and abhor the same. This kind of sorrow is very profitable and
needful for us, as S. Paul does declare, when he rejoiced at that, that he
had made the Corinthians sorry, saying, I now rejoice, not that ye were sorry,
but 2. Cor. 7. 9.
that ye sorowed to repentance: for ye sorowed godly, so that in nothing ye
were hurt by us: for godly sorrow causes repentance unto salvation, not to be
repented of: but worldly sorrow causes death. Now as this sorrow is healthful
unto them which refuse it not even so also the contempt thereof is very
dangerous. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call men unto weeping and
Esaias. 22. 11.
mourning, to baldness and girding about with sack cloth. And behold they
have joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh, and
drinking wine. Likewise Solomon rebukes this contempt, when he says, that
he makes but a sport of wickedness, etc. He speaks here chiefly of faults
and sins which have bin much thought on, and are committed upon set purpose:
for he uses a word which comes of a verb that signifies thoughts. Such
faults are very grievous and abominable before God, because they proceed of
very set malice, and that they which commit them, would do no better, but if
they could, they would yet more wickedly. And albeit they know well that they
do evil, and that they would not be so served, and that they would be ready to
revenge themselves if any man should offend them, yet as though GOD saw them
not, they spare not to think and do evil. They have no fear of God, and do
laugh even whiles they do evil, as if they were well assured, and as though
they had made a couenaunte with death and hell. They are of the number of those
that Esaias speaks of, saying:

Woe be unto them, that draw wickedness unto them with Esaias. 5. 81. 19 and.
20.
cords of vanity: and sin as it were with a carte rope. Let the counsel of
the holy one of Israel come and draw nigh, that we may know it. Woe be unto
them that call evil good, and good evil, which make darkness light, and light
darkness, that make sweet Esai. 28. 14.
sour, and sour sweet. And therefore, hear the word of the Lord, ye
mockers, because ye have said, we have made a covenant with death, and with
hell are we at agreement. Solomon calls such people fools, and not without
a cause. For though there were nothing but this, that they are destitute of
wisdom and knowledge, they deserve to be called fools: by a stronger reason,
when they esteem not wisdom, but mock thereat, contemning and refusing it,
and in so much as in them lies, do persecute it, they deserve to be called
fools. Also they are without wit, without reason, without understanding: the
which is cause that they do nothing care to do evil, but do it, of set purpose:
and for all the admonitio^s or threatenings that can be made unto them, yet do
they nothing but scorn, they make no more account of the word of God then of
fables, yea and less also. Whereby we may judge that they are without
understanding, and that they do well deserve to be called fools. Now that they
are without understanding, Solomon does show it, when he says.

But wisdom rules the man that has understanding. He sets wisdom
against foolishnes, and understanding against mocking, showing us that the
fool has no wisdom, and that the mockers are as beasts without any
knowledge: and therefore they fear not to do evil, and do assure themselves
in their wickedness. Amongst the number of such fools and mockers, we may
set Caine, who after he had slain Abell, passed not for his fault committed:
Genesis 4. 9.
as we may know it, by the answer he made, when he knew not where his
brother was, etc. And likewise, the world destroyed by the flood. For albeit
that Noe did condemn it by the building of the Arc, yet had they no care, nor
took no Heb. 11. 7.
thought: but continued still in their wickedness, passing the time away
merrily: as our Lord does show it, saying. For as they were in the days
before the flood, They did eat and drink, marry, and give in marriage unto
the day that Noe entered into the Ark, Mat. 24. 38.
and they knew nothing till the flood came, and took them all away, etc.
Sodom also: the brethren of Joseph: David also, until Genesis 18. 19. Ez^c. 16.
49 Luke 17. 28
that he was reproved by the Prophet Nathan. The Jews which by envy
crucified Jesus Christ, did mock him, saying, he has saved other, himself
he can not save. And now at this day, the greatest part of them which
persecute the poor members Mat. 27. 41.
of Jesus Christ, are mockers. And I would to God that there were none but in
Popery, etc.

We bring forth these examples, to the end that we knowing that of our own
corrupt nature, we are not, neither can be better: let us therefore be
diligent to ask of God, that he would so print his fear in our hearts, that
thereby we may renounce all carnal trust, which is but folly, and which
holds man in giering and mocking. And that by this fear, we might come and
attain unto the true wisdom, the which may make us understand that we
ought not to laugh and mock, but to be sorry when we have sinned: but that of
a sorrowful spirit and contrite heart, with all humbleness we should ask with
David, Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness. etc. Ps. 51. 15.
3. 17.


And to the end that as we understand we ought not to rejoice at our
wickedness, even so also ought we to convert the foolish, and bring the^ unto
true understanding. Let us ask with David. Make me a clean heart, O God, and
renew aright spirit within me, etc. Again, O Lord open thou my lips, and my
mouth shall show forth Mat. 7. 3. Romans 2. 1.
thy praise. Otherwise, if we take in hand to correct others, we be
hypocrites, and condemn other ourselves. And forasmuch as wisdom is
understanding unto man, it is a certain argument that we want wisdom, when we
know not how to govern ourselves in the fear and reverence of the Lord: and
thus we are fools, and consequently mockers and scoffers. And if we be
such, we cannot but look for a horrible mockery: for when we make but Psalm.
2. 4. Pro. 1. 26.
a mock at sin, and do evil, we scoff at God, refusing his yoke: even so
also will he mock at us. If we desire to avoid the same let us not tarry till
the Lord speak unto us in his fury: but now whiles he speaks gently unto
us by his son in his Gospel, let us hear him, and obey him, receiving this
holy Gospel with faith and repentance. Those that receive it after this sort
are wise, and have understanding. Contrarily, they which despise him are fools
and scoffers, as we may see but too much by experience.

24 The thing that the ungodly are afraid of, shall come upon them: but the
righteous shall have their desire.
It seems at the first sight that Solomon does contrary himself: for he
has said that the fear is as mocking. Now it seems like that the man
which laugheth and leappeth for joy, is assured and that he fears nothing.
And also, the ungodly is so proud, that he cares not for GOD: neither is God
in all his Psalm. 10. ^
thoughts. And now he says, that which the ungodly fears, etc. But no man
does gladly laugh that fears: for fear brings weeping, howling,
carfulness and melancholy: and if it happen that any man in fear laugheth,
it comes not of joy, nor of assurance they have, but it is to labor to turn
away this fear, and to diminishe the grief that men have conceived. I
answer, The cause why the ungodly, and a fool laugheth and mocketh when he
works wickedness, is not because he is altogether without fear and doubt,
and that he is truly assured that no hurt shall happen unto him: he is
destitute of the promises of peace, of life, of salvation, and of all felicity
and prosperity, as well of this world as of eternal joy: for these promises
do appertain only unto the wise, and to the righteous elected. And they are
the same which truly may assure and deliver a man from fear. The assurance
and safety that the wicked labor to have, and do promise themselves, is not
safety, but vain presumption and a false opinion, the which they strive to
keep still in their brains. Caine does strongly strive to assure himself
after he had slain his brother: but when he answers GOD, how he Genesis 4. 9.
knows not where his brother is become, and that he asks if he be his
brothers keeper, he well declares that he is not without fear: for if he
had been assured, and had feared nothing, he would have answered boldly, I
have slain him. The rejoicing then of the ungodly does not proceed of true
assurance, but of that they endeavor to harden themselves and to wax obstinate
in evil, that they may cast from them al fearfulness, if it be possible.
Likewise Lamech, albeit that he boasts to be so strong and hardy, that
though he were hurt and may med yet in his strength he would kill a man: yet
does he well declare himself not too be assured, Genesis 4. 23.
but afraid, when without any word of GOD, he threateneth him that shall kill
him, with more grievous vengeance than GOD had threatened the man that should
slaye Caine. Although then that the ungodly are but too mighty and too hardy
to commit evil, and that without remorse of conscience, with an unbridled
desire, they make horrible things, yet do they well know they do evil, and that
there can none but evil fall upon them: and so they can not be without al
doubt and fear. Saint Paul does show it, All that have sinned without the
law, shall perish without law. What joy soever the ungodly have, yet does the
same not proceed Romans 2. 12.
of quietness and rest that they have in their consciences. For the wicked are
like the raging Sea which cannot rest. Moses also says, Esaias. 57. 20. Deuteronomy.
26. 56.
unto the contemners of the Law, The Lord shall give thee a fearful heart,
and daselingeyes, and a sorowefull spirit. etc. But though the fools and
wicked do tremble and fear, the same does avail them nothing: for after
they are tormented in their minds, they cannot deliver themselves from the
miseries and calamities, but fall from one to another. as says Solomon, that
which the ungodly fears, shall come upon him. The builders of the tower of
Babylon have felt it. The unbelieving and rebellious children of Israel did
fear to be destroyed, if Genesis 11. 4
they went up into the land of promise: also the destruction fell upon them,
and were destroyed forty years in the wilderness. Saul Number. 14. 1.
feared himself and his house to be destroyed, and that David should be king
of Israel: the very which happened. To be short, the ungodly desire to floorish
and triumph many years together, and at last do fear destruction and
damnation: the which also hapeneth Psalm. 37. 9.
and shall come upon them. Wherein we may see that the world deceives them
which behold him, and put their trust in him. For this cause also Saint Paul
does admonish us, And this I say, brethren, because the time is short,
hereafter that both they which have 1. Cor. 7. 29.
wives, be as though they had none: and they that weep, as though they wept
not: and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not. etc. Again, Saint
John says, Love not this world, neither the things that are in this world.
If we withdraw and separate ourselves 1. John. 2. 15.
from the world, which is set upon evil, and again that we give ourselves to
follow the fear of God, desiring too do justly, we shall not be compassed
with the fear of the wicked: but what adversity and afflictions soever do
assault us, we shall by faith overcome them, the Lord helping us. Great are
the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivers them out of all. And
again, Psalm. 34. 20* and. 145. 18.
The Lord is nigh unto al them that call upon him in truth, etc. And
according to the saying of Solomon, but the righteous shall have their desire.
And because that these things are seldom seen unto the corporal eyes, the
world does laugh and mock at this trust and hope: as the wicked are
reproved therefore. Whereupon the children of God have great need of patience.
With Psalm. 14. 6. Heb. 10. 36. Mat. 7. 7. 1. John. 5. 14
these witnesses so faithful, we have the infallible truth which says, Ask,
and it shall be given you. And this is the trust that we have to Godwarde, that
if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us.

25 As the storm passes, even so shall the ungodly vanishe away: but the
righteous, remains as a strong foundation.
A storm is an horrible and fearful thing, as experience proves, and this is
partly because that it comes with a great noise unlooked for: partly because
also that in small time it makes destruction, and brings great hurt even upon
the soden. Eue^ so the holy scripture willing to fear the ungodly, by
signifiyng unto them soden destruction, does threaten them with a storm. And
the same shall come quickly, as if it were a storm, etc. Solomon compares the
wicked which is strong and mighty, unto a tempest: for so much as he utterly
Pro 2. 27. Psalm. 83. 14. Esaias. 29. 5.
can, he shows himself horrible and fearful unto the poor faithful, and
does destroy and kill them, so much as in him lies. Likewise the fury,
violence and vehemency of the wicked are compared unto the tempest and storm.
David does show it, when he prays, Take heed unto me, and hear me, how
I mourn in my Psalm. 55. 2. and. 3.
prayer, and am vexed. The enemy cries so, and the ungodly comes on so
fast: for they are minded to do some mischief, so maliciously are they set
against me, etc. Again, I would make have to and. 8.
escape: because of the stormy wind and tempest. Woe shall be to the multitude
of much people, which shall make a sound like the Esaias. 17. 12.
noise of the Sea. But although the ungodly be so stormy and violent, the
faithful ought not to be afraid thereof. First of al, because the fierceness of
the wicked does not long continue. The holy histories do show it, and
amongst others the violence of the Egyptians against the children of Israel,
and the fury, and vehemency of the Jews against Jesus Christ. The Psalm
also does plainly declare it, Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be
clean gone: thou shall look after his place, and he shall be away. And
according hereunto Solomon says here, that the wicked shall be like the storm
Psalm. 37. 10.
that passes away, or when it is past. Solomon then does not here compare the
wicked unto the tempest, for to make the faithful righteous and innocent,
afraid: but rather to the end that the faithful should not fear the
ungodly, seeing their violence continues not: as Solomon does show by this
comparison, wherein his chief intent is to comfort the poor afflicted, to the
end that they should know that they shall not be long under the raging
tyranny of the wicked. Just Lot has proved it by experience. And Genesis 19.
24. Exo. 14. 13.
Moses says unto the children of Israel. Fear ye not, stand still, and
behold, how the Lord shall save you this day, etc. And according unto his word
they were soon delivered, and the Egyptians rooted out, etc. And when the
children of Israel began to enter into the Land of promise, many Kings and
nations assaulted them with great fierceness, but they continued not long: for
the Lord fought for his people of Israel. Absalom rebelled against his father
David with great fury and violence, but he was soon ouerthrown. 2. Sam. 15 2.
Kin. 18. and. 19.
The fierceness of the Assyrians was also of small continuance. Secondly, the
cruelty and rage of the wicked how long and forcible soever they be, ought
not to fear the faithful: For as when a foundation laid with good stones,
being well joined and sodered together, is steadfast and stable, so that there is
no storm so strong that can shake the same: even so the righteous man which
puts Esa. 36. and. 37.
his trust in the Lord being stayed upon his power and goodness, ought not to
care for the assaults of Satan, of the world, nor of the wicked: for it is
said, They that trust in the Lord shall be even as the mont Sion: which cannot
be removed, but stands fast for ever. etc.

And least we should be deceived with vain presumption, think to be sure
and not to be shaken. For further too stablishe Psalm. 125. 1
us in the trust we have in God, and in the hope that we have that we shall
dwell for ever in the courts of the Lord, and in his holy mountain: we must
walk innocently, etc. Who so does these things, shall never fall: for he is
well sodered together with strong Psalm. 15. 5.
faith, and true repentance. And this is the cause why Solomon says,

But the righteous remains as a storng foundation. Therefore if we will be
steadfast, and not to be shaken through the rage and veheme^cie of the wicked,
neither fear them, though they assault us, for to destroy either in our goods
or in our bodies, or that they labor to destroy our souls by overthrowing of
the true and sound doctrine, and by taking away of the pure religion, we must
be armed, not with an idle and dead faith, but with a lively faith, which
works by love, as the Lord teaches us in his word. Then shall we be
built upon the rock whereupon Jesus Christ has built his Church: against
the which the gates of hell cannot prevail. Our Lord does well show it also
by an other similitude. It is not Mat. 16. 18. Mat. 7. 24.
therefore without cause that Solomon calls the righteous, A strong
foundation. For (as we may understand by the words of our Lord) this foundation
shall not only be sure in this world, but it shall remain for ever, in
eternal blessedness. For blessed is the man that abides temptation: for
after he has been tried, he shall receive a Iam. 1. 12.
crown of glory.

26 As vinegar is unto the teeth, and as smoke is unto the eyes, even so is a
slothful body unto him that sends him.
Solomon has rebuked and reproved the slothful for consuming of the time
unprofitably and spending it in unnecessary works, and thereby run in danger
suddenly too fall into beggary and extreme poverty. And heerby he has showed
that the slothful was hurtful to himself. Now to the end that we should
take heed of the slouthful. And that we should not lightly set them a work,
chiefly when speed and diligence is required, he shows us that the
slothful brings hurt, grief and trouble unto them which employ and set
them on work. And for this cause he compares the slouthful unto vinegar that
is laid unto the teeth: the which it greeueth and troubles, because of the
coldness and sharpness thereof, and because of his biting and harshnesse it
heateth and sets the teeth on edge, and so does hurt them. Secondly he
compares the slothful unto smoke which smites against the eyes: unto the
which it does much harm, it does darken them, and make them water, and does
sees them: and so does weaken the sight, and hinder the eyes from doing their
office, and taking their recreation and pleasure. It is not without cause that
Solomon, makes these co^parisons, and is not contented to compare the
slouthful, either to vinegar, or to smoke, but unto them both: and chiefly the
slothful body that is set about some good work: for he causes not only one
grief and hurt, but many: he is cause of much sorrow and anger, because he
does not faithfully nor with such care and diligence execute and discharge
his office duly, as is required, nor content and satisfy them which have
hired and set him on work. This has no need of proof: for they which hire
and send laborers to do their work, do sufficiently try what hurt and
hinderance they suffer, if their laborers be slouthful and negligent: albeit
the matter is not great. But we are al of this nature, that we trouble
ourselves, except that men do as we will have them, even in the affairs and
works of small importance: neither will we afterward be served with such
slouthful and negligent persons again, but we disdain and reject them: for
we would have our works so well done, that we could find no manner of fault.
Now forasmuch as we are of this nature, let every one of us take heed by the
law of charity, if we be sent, and appointed to do some work, that through
our negligence and slothfulness we grieve no man: but that faithfully and
truly we give unto our neighbors that which we owe them: that we be ready
to do toward our neighbors, acco^rding as we are able. Let them which are
lusty and strong, labor with their bodies to help the feeble and weak: let
the rich be rich in good works: let the wise, prudent, and discreet, not
spare their lips and tongues, for to teach and to direct the indiscreet,
and them that go astray. Otherwise we shall not be only as vinegar and smoke
unto men, but also unto God: for, of what estate or condition soever we be, it
is he that calls us thereunto, which does ordain and send us: so that we
do no good work, but that it is the work of the Lord. If then we be slack,
careless and slouthful to do our duty, we are grievous and troublesome unto
God: as we may plainly know by the similitude of the talents. To the end
therefore that we be not troublesome unto our God, and Mat. 25. ^.
least we be rebuked of evil and slothfulness, we must every one of us set
ourselves to work, according to the number and excellency of the talents that
we have received of the Lord, that we may be like the faithful and wise
servant, and not unto the evil servant. For to do this well, let us consider
unto what state we are called, and to what work we are sent. First of al,
that the Kings, Princes, and Superiors of the earth (to whom God has given
this honor to communicate his name unto them, saying, I have said ye are
Gods, and are al children of the most highest) as God never cease Psa.. 82. 6.
seth working in governing the world by judgment and justice, and is careful
and diligent to provide for his creatures: so also they should not be given to
sleep and rest, to take their ease and pleasures, to take their sport and
worldly pastime, to eat and drink out of measure, to delight in pompes and
superfluous magnificence, but should be diligent and attentive, as David
says, Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings, be learned, ye that are Judges of the
earth. For to Psalm. 2. 10. Exo. 18. 21 and 31. 1. Psalm. 82. 3. Esai. 1. 23.
Ier. 5. 27.
compass this well, they must be men endued with virtue, and careful to follow
the lesson that is taught them, and as they are commanded, to minister right
unto the poor, etc. Otherwise they shall be as vinegar and smoke before the
Lord: he will be grieved at them, as he well shows when he does threaten
them, Thy Princes are unfaithful, and companions of thieves, etc. Behold how
they are exalted and enriched. Let the Ministers of the word, which are
Heraldes Posts and Messengers of the great King and Ruler of all the world, for
to carry the message of salvation, and to proclaim the ordinances of their
Lord and Master, be careful and diligent: even as the Gospel that they
bear, is compared to a course, as also the life of al Christians: and by a
stronger reason their lives, because they ought to proceed and go before their
flock. Let them Esai. 56. 10 Act. 20. 28
not be like unto sluggishe beasts, unto lying Doctors, which are
slowebellies, which through sweet words and fair speeches, (for to serve
their bellies and not God, neither his Christ,) do deceive the hearts of the
simple. And let them not be of the number of the^ of whom Esai speaks, Al
their watchmen are blind guides: they know nothing, etc: But let them follow
the counsel that S. Paul gives, Let every one of them learn to be diligent:
and to follow Romans 12. 11
the doctrine of Saint Paul, to wit, that they be not slouthful to do
service, etc.

27 The fear of the Lord increases the days: but the years of the wicked
shall be diminished.
To the end that we should understand how our days shall be increased to live
long, as there is none of us but does desire the same: forasmuch as the fear
of the Lord is the way thereunto, we must not straye from it, but must fix
the same in our hearts, and make the same familiar and an household servant,
not in fearing the Lord as a cruel tyrant, or severe and sharp judge. For
after this sort we should have the fear of punishment and torment, and not the
fear of the Lord. And as they which so fear the Lord, have not the fear of
the Lord: so also have they neither wisdom nor understanding. For the fear
of the Lotde is the beginning of wisdom. Again: the beginning of wisdom is
the fear of the Lord. Pro. 1. 7. and 9. 10.
And thus wisdom is not without fear, nor fear without wisdom. If we will
not be found naked, we must take diligent heed unto the commandments of God.
And forasmuch as the Lord promises in the law, length of days unto them
which shall keep his commandments: it follows that it is not without cause
that Solomon attributes increase of days unto wisdom. And hereby we may
understand that the fear of the Lord and wisdom are so Pro. 2. 1. Pro. 3. 16
knit together, that the one is not without the other: so that they which are
wise, are not without the fear of the Lord* and they that fear him, are not
without wisdom. It is the^ the fear of the Lord that increases the days of
the wise, making the^ to live long in this world, so long as is expedient and
necessary for their spiritual and eternal health. Contrarily, the foolish which
want the fear of the Lord, and therefore slip and fall away to al rebellion
and disobedience, and so become wicked, shall not continewe long, but their
years shall be cut short, albeit that in the respect of the outward sight they
live long: but this length is nothing before God: For a thousand years in thy
sight, are but as yesterday that is past. Moreover the years of Psalm. 90. 4.
Pro. 2. 21. 22 and 3. 20.
the ungodly ought not to be counted long, because that afterward they shall go
into eternal death.

28 The patient abiding of the righteous shall be gladness: but the hope of the
wicked shall perish.
Although that after our vicious and corrupted nature, we be so blind and
ignorant, that we know not how to rejoice, nor what true godliness is, yet
are we so affectioned after such a sort, that we desire to rejoice with
gladness, that we might never want: and we think that there is nothing better.
I have known nothing better of al these things, then to rejoice and to do well
in this life Again, there Ecele. 3. 12 22. and 5. 17 and 11. 9.
is nothing better for a man but to rejoice himself in his works. And it is
a fair thing to eat and drink, and for a man to rejoice of his labor, etc.
And be merry in thy youth, and let thy heart be glad* Now as we are ignorant,
eue^ so of ourselves do we never attein unto this gladness, though we do much
desire it. But Solomon willing that we should obtain our desires, does teach
us how we shall atteine thereunto, when he says, the patient abiding of the
righteous, is joy. He attributes joy unto righteousness, the which consists
in this, that being assured of the goodness and love of God toward us, we
should delight to give him obedience according to his law, by loving him with all our hearts, and our neighbors as ourselves. If we be such, though we have
many troubles, griefs, and sorrows, for that which we see to happen in the
world, and chiefly because of our sins, and also for the offenses and
slanders of our neighbors (for it is that which ought to grieve us more then
al other things) yet if of a free will and perfect heart we aspire unto
righteousness, we shall not be deprived of joy. The servants of 2. Cor. 6. 9.
God do prove, and may say with Saint Paul: as unknown, and yet known: as
sorowing, and yet always rejoicing: as dying, and behold we live: as chastened,
and yet not killed: as sorowing, and yet always rejoicing: as poor, and yet
make many rich: as having nothing, and yet possessing al things. Forasmuch as
they know and are assured that God loves them, they delight and rejoice in
Psalm. 5. 12. and 32. 1.
his Word, knowing that God is true in his promises and holy in all his
works, laws and commandments: and let al them that put their trust in thee,
rejoice: they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them, they
that love thy name, shall be joyful in thee. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye
righteous: for it becomes well the just to be thankful. But albeit the
righteous do rejoice, because they are assured God loves them, as Solomon
does show, when he is not contented to say, that the righteous do rejoice,
but he does attribute their gladness unto their hope. For he says, The
patient abiding of the righteous is joy: as if he said, that which rejoices
the righteous, is the hope they have in the Lord, who will not deceive them of
that which they look for of him: and thus their joy shall abide for ever,
seeing they shall have full and perpetual possession of that whereof they
rejoice and look for with gladness. Likewise what miseries soever they suffer
in this world, yet have they good occasion and matter to rejoice, as our Lord
does show, them, making them fellows and companions of all the Prophets, and
assuring them of a most precious reward. Therefore if we will hold the true
joy, let us not lament and be sorry for the ease of this world, the lusts and
pleasures, the abundance and superfluity of substance and riches of this
world, which do deceive and beguile the ungodly. For they seeing themselves in
worldly and temporal prosperity, do run into insolency and unshamefastness,
and do promise themselves, that no evil nor hurt shall happen unto them. But
Solomon does threaten them with the contrary, when he says, But the hope
of the wicked shall perish. This is often seen to happen to the world, and the
Scriptures and replenished with such examples, and Luke 6. 24.
also with like threats. And also it is written, Woe be to you that are rich
men: for you have received your consolation.

29 The way of the Lord is strong for him that is perfect: but fear shall be
to them that work iniquity.
They that will be assured and safe either from their enemies, or from other
things which might hurt them, or overthrow and destroy them, do arm and
fortify themselves either with multitude of people, or gold and silver, or
with Castles and towns surely compassed with strong walls, deep and large
ditches, and other things which they esteem to be fit and meet for to
preserve them from the fear of their enemies, and other dangers. It is not
evil done for a man to arm himself against al adversities: but it is evil
done to trust in worldly and temporal helps. For with this, that more often
they find themselves deceived and beguiled, they also offend God, by striving
against his word, whereby he does show unto us that we must only put our trust
in him, and that it is only from whom we must look for our only refuge, for
to strengthen us against whatsoever we may fear, as well in this life as after
the same: likewise the Lord reprooueth such confidence, does curse them and
overthrow them: as the children of Israel have proved, and other nations in
their order: even as the holy histories do declare, and the Prophets have
foretold: that it is evil done to trust in men's help, David does show, when he
says, that some put their trust in Charets, and some in Horses: but we will
remember of the Lord our God. There Psalm. 20. 8. and 49. 6
be some that put their trust in their goods: and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches. And that it is against the word, it is manifest:
for it is said, Thou will make no covenant with them, nor with their goods. Let
us know then that we strive against the Exo. 23. 32.
word of the Lord, when we have our regard unto worldly and temporal help,
for to save us, and that in this sort we loose ourselves, by the just
vengeance of God (the which we cannot desire, except we be mad and out of
their wits, but do crave our conservation and salvation, and would gladly
be assured thereof, without danger of falling therefrom, but to be surely kept
and fast holden therein) we must be very diligent to mark the doctrine of
Solomon, when he says, The way of the Lord is strong unto him that is
perfect. For he does show us, that if we will be without Romans 4. 13. and 11. 6.
fear and out of danger, and to be strongly armed and fortified, for to
withstand all the assaults of Satan and of the world, and to overcome them, we
must be perfect, and walk in the way of the Lord, wherein at the first
sight, it seems that he does attribute the assurance of our salvation unto
the dignity and excellency of the person, and to the desert of works, the
which is contrary unto grace and to the promises. For the promise, that
Abraham should be the heir of the world, was not given him, or to his seed
through the righteousness of Faith. Again, If it be of grace, it is not any more
of works, or grace were no more grace. For to resolve and unloose this
question and doubt, let us first of al note that it is al one, to walk in the
way of the Lord, and to be perfect: for the one is the diffinition of the
other. The which shall be easy for us to understand, if we know that the way of
the Lord is that which he teaches and commands us by his word, true and
just. Show me thy ways, O Lord: and Psalm. 25. 4. Esai. 2. 3.
teach me thy paths. Come and let us ascend up to the mountain of the Lord,
and he shall teach us his ways. Now the perfect man, is he that walks in the
law or doctrine of the Lord. Blessed are those Psalm. 119. 1
that are undefiled in the way: and walk in the way of the Lord. Noe was a
just and perfect man in his days, walking after God. And God said unto
Abraham, walk before me and be perfect. Now must we see from whence this
perfection comes to man, and whither it come of Genesis 9. 9. and 17. 1.
his own power that he walks and perseuereth in the way of the Lord. The
Scriptures condemns al men of corruption and wickedness. But deliverance
comes of God. Moses does well show it, The Lord thy God shall circumcise thine
heart, etc. Create in me a clean heart O God, etc. Turn me O Lord, and I
shall be turned. Again, I Gene. 6. and 8. John. 3. Romans 3. and. 7 Iere. 10.
Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Psalm. 51. 12. Iere. 31. 18.
will put my law within them, and write it in their hearts, etc. And forasmuch
as it comes of the grace and gift of God, that man is perfect, and that he
walks in the way of the Lord, it follows well that Solomon does here
attribute nothing unto the dignity and excellency of man, nor to the merit
of his works: but by the free promise of God he labors to assure the
faithful man against al temptations, promising him that if by says he stay
himself upon the goodness of God, and that by true repentance he endeavors
to give obedience unto his law, that he shall be out of al dangers of
destruction and perdition, and shall be well armed and fortified against all
battles as well of the Devil as of the world. This man's house is builded upon
the rock. We are the^ here exhorted not to fear any thing, Mat. 7. 24.
if we receive the word in fear and reverence. Also, forasmuch as strength is
promised unto us, it follows there is no power in us, and that it is the gift
of God: Moreover, that strength is promised and given us, to the end that we
should employ ourselves manly and mightily. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
the Lord, and in the power of Ephe. 6. 10.
his might, etc. But if we lay apart those armours and weapons through
infidelity and rebellion, and persevere in our corruption and naughtiness,
albeeit that after the sight of the eyes, we be bold, hardy, and valiant, or
rather cruel and raging: yet because our conscience does reprove us, we have
no assurance, nor can have. For as Solomon says they shall be afraid that work
wickedness. And this is by following the threatninges of the law, as here
above is already said in the 24. verse. etc.

30 The righteous shall never be removed. but the wicked shall not remain in
the land.
Forasmuch as the righteous is he which has a perfect heart, and does delight to
live co^formably after the rule that God gives him in his word, by serving God
with all honor and reverence, and his neighbors in simplicity and innocence,
it might seem at the first sight that the promise which Solomon makes here,
has no place, and that the contrary thereof is true. For first of all the
scripture gives witness unto Abel, that he was righteous: and yet it
appears that he was removed, when through the cruelty of his brother Caine,
his temporal life was taken from him, and his blood shead. Likewise many other
righteous men, (amongst the which were the Prophets and Apostles) have bin
cruelly handled, and suffered great tyranny, as killing and murdering. Even
Jesus Christ, which did not sin, in whose mouth was Mat. 23. 3. Heb. 11. 4.
found no guile, he I say, which is the resurrection and the life, even the
Creator of heaven and earth: the Lord which has al in his power, was most
shamefully taken of the world. With these so many examples, we have also
witnesses. Was there ever man that perished in Eccle. 26. 1. Esaias. 57. 1.
his righteousness: or wicked which prolonged his days with his malice? The
righteous is destroyed, and no man thinks thereof in his heart. I answer,
Albeit that this world and the present life apperteine unto the righteous by
promise, and that the earth, should be Ps. 37. and. 24 Romans 4. 3.
their inheritance, because they are the children of God, and seed of Abraham,
to whom the earth apperteineth* and thereupon heirs of the world: yet
notwithstanding through the rage of the ungodly they are oftentimes evil
handled, and are after the outward sight taken from the world, and seem to be
deprived of this worldly heritage, (promised unto their father Abraham,) and to
be destroyed and damned: but the truth indeed is, as Solomon says, that they
shall never be removed. For as Abraham remained in the promised land as a
Pilgrim Heb. 11. 9.
and stranger, even so the righteous do judge themselves strangers in this
world, and seek another country: and therefore they fear not to be taken out
of this world, but rather rejoice: and so, albeit they depart out of this
world, yet they are not driven out perforce: and therefore they think it no
remoouing, when they change this life. For by this means they enjoy the rest
which has been prepared from the beginning, and do obtain glorious
immortality. Thus the righteous is reduced back from evil, that he may come in
peace. The souls of Esaias. 57. 1. Wis. 3. 1.
the righteous are in the hands of God, and no torment does touch them. After
this sort they esteem themselves, neither ought to be judged removed: but
that if they were surely planted by Faith and hope, that now they are planted
much more strongly, when they obtain the fruition of that which they
believed, and looked for through hope: and do obtain it, for to enjoy it
eternally. For they which rest in the heavenly glory, can never be drawn from
thence. The^ shall be perfectly fulfilled, that which David says, Psalm. 92. 13
The righteous shall florishe like a Palm tree: and shall spread abroad like a
Ceder in Libanus, etc. Contrarily and against this promise, he sets a
threatening for to fear the wicked, pronouncing unto them, that they shall be
deprived of their pleasures. They take their pleasure in this world, and in
this earth, and have no other mind, but to place themselves at ease in earth,
and to have abundance of riches to triumph and to make great cheer. Their
meditation is, that they would have their houses endure for ever. But Solomon
Psalm. 49. 12
does pronounce, that they shall not dwell in the land. If we behold the
outward appearance, it shall seem unto us that there is no people in the
world, which have better, nor longer habitation in the land, then have the
wicked: they obtain the kingdoms and principalities, towns and castles, they
have abundance of substance and riches, and take also their ease, and as it
seems they want nothing of that they can desire and wish: in such wise, that
the children of God are tempted to follow them, to be partakers of their
prosperity. But albeit that God does suffer his to be Psalm. 73. 1.
tempted, yet he lets them not fall. For, truly God is good to Israel, and
to them which are of a clean heart. Even so at the first sight it might seem,
that the contrary of this threatening were Iere. 12. 1. Job. 21. 7.
true.

Jeremy also says, If I should dispute with thee, O Lord, thou art
righteous, yet let me speak of judgment before thee. Why does the way of
the ungodly prosper? Wherefore do the wicked still wax and grow rich? If we
look well how Solomon speaks, he gives us the solution of this question
and doubt: for he Leui. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
says not that the wicked do not dwell in the land, but that they shall not
dwell in the land: and this is according to the threatenings that God makes
against the contemners of his law, and according to that which is pronounced
against the wicked. Jeremy also Iere. 12. 3. Psalm. 37.
gives the solution, when he prays, Draw them as sheep unto the
slaughter, and prepare them against the day of murder. So does Job also,
saying, Lo, their wealth is not in their hand. Job. 21. 16


31 The mouth of the righteous shall bring forth wisdom: but the tongue of
the froward shall be rooted out.
Unwillingly do men remove a good tree from his place, wherein it has taken
great and good roots, and brings forth good fruit with abundance, except
they hope that it will fructify more in an other place. And so when it is well
rooted, it moves not, but keeps his place. Contrarily, the axe is already
set to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth
good fruit, Mat. 3. 10.
is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Also Solomon knowing that the
righteous is like unto the good tree, which gives and brings forth his
fruit in due season, has said, that he shall never be removed. And after
this, he shows what fruit he brings forth, when he says, That the mouth
of the righteous shall bring forth wisdom. That which is proper unto the
heart, he attributes unto the mouth, because it is the Organe of the heart,
and that Mat. 12. 34. 35.
from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks: and that a good man from
the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things. Now that this
fruit is good, it ought to be known enough to us, by that which has been
said of the excellency, dignity, and goodness of wisdom. But the means
to produce this Romans 12. 7. Ephe. 4. 29. and 5. 3.
fruit, is to follow the counsel of the Apostle which says, He that has an
office, let him wait on his office: or he that teaches, on teaching, etc.
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths: but that which is
good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. But
fornication, and al uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named
amongst you, as it becomes Saints. Let every man as he has received the
gift, minister the same one to another, as good disposers of the manifold
grace of God. This same fruit is required of all, and there is none 1. Pet. 4.
10
that can truly boast to be a Christian, except he bring it forth. But
chiefly the Ministers of the word ought to be careful and diligent to bring
forth this fruit. I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go
and bring forth fruit. They are the husbandmen Ioh. 15. 16. Mat. 21. 41.
and laborers, unto whom the Lord has let out his Vineyarde. By this we
may know, that the righteous are not great in number, seeing there are but
very few that do give themselves to speak wisely: but almost every mouth
does utter vanity and foolishness, uncleanness and wickedness, as is
tried. And forasmuch as the good tree does bring forth his fruit in due
season, and wisdom is always in season, it is always profitable, yea even
necessary: it follows, that the righteous does not cease to bring forth
wisdom by wholesome doctrine, by good admonitions, by holy corrections and
just threats, according to that which is said, The mouth of the righteous will
talk of wisdom. This same is chiefly fulfilled by the preaching of the
Gospel, which Psalm. 37. 3^
for to declare well, the Lord has promised a mouth and wisdom unto his
Apostles. Saint Paul does declare it when he says, This grace was given me,
etc. And when he says that he preaches Luke 21. 15 Ephe. 3. 8. Collo. 1.
28.
the Gospel, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: against the mouth of
the righteous, he sets the tongue of the froward, that is a froward
tongue, which speaks nothing but vanity, filthiness and wickedness, lying,
fraud, cursing, slandering, false swearing, flattery, wanton songs, and
other idle words. All these things are evil fruits, the which ought not to
proceed from the mouth of the faithful, neither can they utter such. And
because the tongue of the froward brings forth such fruits, Solomon does
place it in order, and also does compare it unto evil trees, when he says
that it shall be rooted out. Wherein he signifies, that after the froward
have misused their tongues at pleasure, by blaspheming of God, and slandering
of their neighbors in diverse sorts, that at the last, they shall be confounded,
and shall be compelled to hold their peace. For they show there is no
faithfulness in their mouths: their inward parts are very wickedness.
With our tongues will we prevail: we are they that ought to speak, who is
Lord over us? Psalm. 5. 10 and 12. 4. and 73. 9.
For they stretche forth their mouth unto the heaven: and their tongue goes
through the world. But it shall happen to them at the last, as the Psalmist
prays against them. Reward them according to their deeds, and according to
the wickedness of their own Psalm. 28. 4.
inventions. The Lord shall root out al deceitful lips: and the tongue that
Psalm. 12. 3.
speaks proud things. But it is not without cause, that Solomon is not
contented only to say, The tongue of the froward, in the singular number: but
does attribute also unto the tongue, many wickednesses. This is to show
briefly, that the tongue of man is stopped and infected with a great abundance
of wickednesses, and that it is impossible, or at the least very hard, to
remedy the same, as more at large Saint James does declare, saying, Behold,
we put bittes into the Horses mouths, that they should obey us, and Iam. 3. 3.
we turn about al their body, etc.

32 The lips of the righteous will speak things pleasant: but the mouth of
the wicked speaks froward things.
The righteous man for to utter wisdom well, takes heed of the speaking with
his lips any thing that should displease God, or which ought to be yrkesome
or troublesome unto his neighbors: but he guides his lips wisely, speaking
according as he knows to be the pleasure and will of God: and therewith he
labors to please al men with his word, so much as is possible, without
offending of GOD, and without giving of offense to his neighbors. This is that
which Solomon means, when he says, The lips of the righteous will speak
of acceptable things. Whereupon follows, that the lips of the righteous are
occupied in pronouncing the word of God, the which he would have continually
in the mouth of man. These words I command thee this day shall be in thy heart,
lay up then these words in your hearts. Seeing that God so straightly Deuteronomy. 6.
6. and 11. 18.
and expressly commands this same, it follows, that if we occupy ourselves
in speaking so, that then our tongues will speak any thing that is pleasant
unto him. Now that which pleases the Creator and Lord of all the world,
ought well also to please his creatures, that are his subjects, who for to
please him, ought to love that which they know will please him, considering also
the excellency, and profit of this word, and the sweetness thereof. The words
of the Lord are pure words. The law of the Lord is an undefiled law,
converting the soul. O how sweet are thy Psalm. 12. 7. and 19. 8. and 119.
103.
words unto my throat? yea, sweeter then honey unto my mouth. The wicked,
which despise and reject the word, have no clean mouths, but filthy and
infected, and altogether disordered and given up to evil speaking, and to cast
up out of their throat al filthiness and stinking savor. This is it which
Solomon means, when he says, but the mouth of the wicked does speak
froward things. They are a viperous generation, and therefore they can not
speak well, seeing they themselves are evil: for out of the abundance of the
heart, the mouth speaks. Men use not to gather grapes of thorns, nor Figs
of thistles. Wherefore we know that it is not without cause that Solomon has
said, that the tongue of the froward shall be rooted out. For since that the
wicked by the evil fruits of their mouth, do labor to poison and to destroy
their neighbors, and which worst is, do despite God, by their blasphemies,
they well deserve to be rooted out.

The eleventh Chapter.
1 FAlse balances are an abomination unto the Lord: but a perfect weight
pleases him.
Forasmuch as the world is replenished with fraud and deceit, with usury and
greediness, with theft and robbery, with counterfaiting and falsifying:
therefore the commandment is not esteemed, Thou shall not do unjustly in
judgment, in line, in weight or in measure. Thou shall not have in thy bag
two manner of waightes, a Leui. 19. 35. Deuteronomy. 25. 13.
great and a small. There is no account made of the promise that God adds unto
this commandment, That thy days may be made long on the earth: neither also
is the threatening feared that follows: for whosoever shall so do, shall be
abhorred of the Lord. In this sort we judge less of God then of mortal men.
If a mighty and rich man has made promise of any thing, we will trust to
receive according to his promise, and in the mean while they will be diligent
to please him: if he threaten, they will fear him, and will take heed to do
any thing that should displease him. But although that GOD is true, yea even
he himself the only truth (otherwise he should not be GOD) and that he
does testify his truth unto us by diverse witnesses, yet will we not trust
his promises: as we show, when we make no account to labor for to please
him. And also though he be true and faithful, and does threaten but upon
just cause, yet do we not tremble, nor fear his vengeance, albeeit he declare
the same by faithful witnesses. Moses is one of the witnesses of the promises
and threateninges: as we have now heard. After him came Solomon, endued with
great wisdom of GOD, who does witness the same in this place. First of al
he threateneth them which oppress and deceive their neighbors in any matter
whatsoever it is, when he says,

1 False balances are abomination unto the Lord: he does threaten them, I say
with eternal destruction and damnation. For it follows well that if a false
balance displeases the Lord, and that he does abhor them, that then they
which use them are wicked: and therefore cannot remain, but are as chafe
which the wind drives away, and so go to destruction: for the way of the
wicked shall perish: seeing also that it is said, Thou art not a GOD that love
wickedness, etc. But to the end that we may know Psalm. 1. 6. Psalm. 5. 4.
who they are that God abhors, and that we also should abhor them (for
nothing that displeases God, ought to please us, but we should hate and
contemneit) we must consider wherein the false balance stands, and who they
are that use them. Which for to do, let us know that the balance is taken
for all waytes, measures, rule, and for all Arts, Sciences, Laws, and
behauiours that we use toward our neighbors, we may so understand it, by
the place before alleged by Moses, out of the which he collected these
things. Likewise the Lord does attribute rule and balance, to that which he
does toward his Church for to restore it. Judgment also will I lay to the
rule, and righteousness to the balance. It is then a false balance and
deceivable, when we do not faithfully behave us toward our neighbor, when
we are slack and negligent to pay our duty, or that we labor to tread
them under foot, or to deceive in any matter whatsoever it be. In all estates
as we prove by experience, there are false balances: as between Merchantes,
Citizens, Handicraftes men, and laborers, but the most hurtful are they which
are enclosed in the hands of false teachers, who by fair words, and
flattering speech, deceive the hearts of the simple and innocent. After these
may be set the same of wicked Magistrates, which are placed in the seat of
God, who is righteous: and yet their houses are filled with the spoils of the
poor. Now the perfection that is required of us, is, that we should not
imagine nor devise any evil against our neighbors, that we should not labor
to become rich to their hurt, but that in simplicity and uprightness of
conscience we should procure their wealth with all our power. This is the
perfect weight which pleases the Lord, as says Solomon. They which use this
weight, are acceptable unto God: and as the weight which they use is perfect,
so does God allow them for perfect, and does not impute unto them the
relics of imperfection which is in them. And forasmuch as they please God,
he will never be displeased with them to destroy them. Whereupon it follows,
that Solomon, saying, That a perfect weight pleases the Lord, does promise
everlasting life unto them which use it, who although they be most commonly
poor and miserable before the world, yet are they rich enough, and blessed,
for they are heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and of wonderful riches.

2 When pride comes, then comes shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.
Man naturally desires and wishes to be exalted unto glory and honor: but
he knows not how to attain thereunto: and therefore most commonly insteede
to ascend and go forward, he falls backewarde: and in place of glory and
honor, he gets confusion, shame and dishonor: and this is not without
hurt, but most commonly men are ashamed and confounded by the hurt that
happens against their expectation and hope. Our first Father Adam has well
proved it, and before him the Angels which kept not their first state, but fell
from their place. Now as it has happened unto the Angels, and to Adam, even so
does it, and shalbefal unto al them that are proud. This has been found
true in all ages. And therefore according to experience, Solomon does
pronounce: That when pride comes, then comes shame. If the world destroyed
by the fludde, had believed Noe the messenger of righteousness, it had not
fallen into such shame and eternal destruction. The builders of the Tower of
Babylon have tried this true. To be short, if we examine the holy histories
Genesis 11. 9
of the Bible, we shall find that they which have been raised through pride,
have been afterward confounded and ashamed: and this same has not befallen
unto the reprobate only, but also unto the children of God as unto David, and
Saint Peter. It is then good reason that the proud should be confounded and
ashamed: 2. Sam. 24. Mat. 26.
for they rise not up against men, but against God, to whom al knees ought to
bow, and to whom al creatures ought to do homage and service, and to humble
themselves under his mighty hand, against the which none can resist. For this
cause (I say) it is necessary that they should be confounded and ashamed: the
one for a certain time, as David and Saint Peter, who by shame came to
repentance: but the other, as the reprobate, lie ever therein. For what shame
soever they feel in this world, yet do they not call themselves home, to
consider against whom they quarrel for to humble themselves, but do harden
themselves through pride and presumption. As Pharao, when he pursued the
people of God, had diverse wounds, and yet he ceased not to rebel, eue^ so he is
and shall co^tinew in eternal confusion as al other proud and arrogant persons
that will not submit and humble themselves. Now behold, the day comes that
shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea and all that Mala. 4. 1.
do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that comes shall burn them up,
says the Lord of hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branche. The
high look of a man shall be humbled, and the loftiness of men shall be abaced,
and the Lord only shall be exalted in that day, etc. We must therefore be
humble, and we Esaias. 2. 11.
shall not be ashamed: although the world do contemn and reject us, and that
we be counted as the filth and doung of the world, yet shall we not be
confounded nor ashamed for all the dishonor that men labor to work us, but
we shall be praised and honored so much as shall be expedient for the glory of
God, and for our spiritual health. Joseph had experience thereof in Egypt. David
had experience thereof in diverse sorts: and therefore the Scripture confesses
that god has chosen and elected him. And also he generally confesses, Eue^
thou have set me up from mine enemies that rose against me: thou have delivered
me from the cruel man. His eyes consider the poor, and his eye liddes tries
the children of men. He has showed strength with his arm: he has scattered
the proud Psalm. 18. 48. Psalm. 11. 4. Luke. 1. 51. and. 52. and. 53.
in the imagination of their hearts. He has put down the mighty from their
seats, and has exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with
good things, and sent away the rich empty. These are the words of the
Virgin Mary. Likewise our Lord Jesus, who was esteemed as the shame and scumme
of the world, has been highly exalted. Therefore we must chiefly Phil. 2.
9. Mat. 11. 29. Ioh. 13. 14. Mat. 18. 4.
learn of our Lord to humble ourselves: with his example also he has made us
a promise, which ought greatly to move us to humble ourselves. Whosoever
therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven. For whosoeeuer exalts himself, shall be brought low,
and he that humbles Ioh. 14. 11. Luke. 14. 11. 1. Pet. 5. 5.
himself, shall be exalted. God resists the proud, and gives grace unto the
humble. Solomon does give us the very same promise, but yet under other words,
when he says, but with the humble comes wisdom. For it is as much as if he
did say: They which are not given unto their own judgment, which presume not
of themselves, neither do esteem themselves above others, but do labor to
keep themselves within the simplicity of the word by assuring themselves of
the goodness and favor of God, and of his promises, and through true
repentance do give themselves to follow the righteousness that GOD has
commanded by his law, and become subject and obedient unto this good father of
heaven: These (I say) that are such, and have set all their desire to do the
will of God, and which can say, Lord, my heart is not Psalm. 131. 1.
hawtie, neither are mine eyes lofty, neither have I walked in great matters,
and hid from me, such are accompanied with wisdom: whereupon follows that
they shall not be confounded, but shal-be exalted unto honor. For length of
days is in her right hand. Pro. 3. 16.
When there is so much riches in wisdom, the which does accompany and follow
the humble, they shall be far from shame, and shall be crowned with immortal
glory. But to the end that we should not deceive ourselves, and in the place
of humility to be accompanied with pride, let us note that there are some which
do count themselves, and would also be esteemed of others to be humble, and
yet they burst with pride. First of all we place the hypocrites which in
words do abace and become lowly, and yet indeed would be the greatest. As
the Pope names himself to be Math. 23. 5. and. 7. 15. Romans 16. 17. Phil. 3.
18. 1. Tim. 6. 3. Mat. 7. 22. Romans 10. 3. Col. 2. 1. Math. 7. 3. Romans 2. 1.
Luke 18. 11 Heb. 11. 13 and. 13. 14.
the servant of the servants of God: and yet for all that will be worshipped. The
Monks and Priests do also abace themselves both in words and in gesture, but
they may be set amongst the order of hypocrites, of whom our Lord Jesus
Christ does warn us: And do al their works for to be seen of men.
Secondly, the false Prophets, and lying Doctors. Thirdly, those are not, nor
will not be contented with the purity of the Gospel, the which does preach
unto us salvation in Jesus Christ but will be saved by their works.
Fourthly, they which judge others, and do worse themselves, such are like the
Pharisees.

3 The uprightness of the just shall guide them: but the frowardenesse of the
transgressors shall destroy them.
We are all pilgrims in this world, but we are so ignorant that we cannot
guide ourselves in our journey, but are like unto blind men which presume and
take upon them to walk in the way without a guide, they rather take the wrong
way then the right, and do stumble and knock themselves, and they fall and
hurt themselves, and are in danger to be lost. Such is our state if we be
left to our own nature, we wander out of the right pathe: and if we be not
set in again, we perish. For, for to guide ourselves and to atchieue and
come to the end of our enterprise, we consider and set before us the greatest
number, and do follow them: and in so doing we enter at the wide gate, and
walk in the broad Mat. 7. 13.
way that leads to destruction. And in this sort, we do clean contrary to
that which we desire: for naturally we desire to guide ourselves, and so well
to dispatch our business, that we should have no hurt thereby. But it is
necessary that we should want of our desire, seeing that in laboring to do
our business, we proceed therein by deceit and malice, by unfaithfulness,
lying, and crafty packing, by hypocrisy and feignednesse, and do not labor
to enrich ourselves, but with the hurt and hinderance of our neighbors, so that
we may well complain with David, Help me, Lord, for there is Psa. 12. 1.
Esa. 9. 17. and 59. 3. 9.
not one godly man: for the faithful are diminished from among the children of
men. And with Esaias, For every one is an hypocrite, and wicked, and every mouth
speaks folly. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue has murmured
iniquity. After this sort we guide ourselves as the blind do: and we may
say Esaias. 59. 9. 10.
with the Prophet Esaias, in the same place: we weight for light, but lo it is
darkness, for brightness: but we walk in darkness. We grope for the
wall, like the blind, and we grope as one without eyes, etc.

Likewise Solomon does not deny, but that in this sort we may be guided, when
he attributes guiding and governance unto integrity and uprightness, and
that he says, the vprtghtnesse of the just shall guide them, and when
contrarily, he does attribute destruction unto frowardness and
unfaithfulness, saying, but the frowardness of the transgressour shall
destroy them. If then we would keep a good way, and do well our business,
we must be endued with integrite and uprightness, the which are virtues
depending the one of the other, so that the one cannot be without the other,
and it is very hard to be judged which of them should go before. Also we see
here that Solomon does join them together, when he says, the uprightness of
the faithful or just: as also they are joined together by the Scripture. This
man was an upright and just man. Let mine uprightness and equity preserve
me. Mark the Job. 1. 1. Psalm. 25. 21. Psalm. 37. 37. Genesis 6. 9.
upright man, and behold the just. Noah was a just and upright man in his
time, and walked with God, and did so well govern himself and his affairs,
that he perished not by the flood. But to the end that we should not attribute
any merit unto his integrity, it is said that Noah found favor before the
Lord. And God willing to instruct Abraham to govern himself well, said unto
him, Walk before me, and be thou upright. And to the end that we should not
attribute this guiding unto Abraham's power, he said unto him. I am God al
sufficient, or, almighty: and for to make him to understand that Abraham of
himself for all his integrity, could not bring Genesis 17. 1.
his matters to pass, he promises him immediately, I will make my covenant
between me and thee, and I will mutiplie thee exceedingly. Therefore, when by
integrity and uprightness we shall be well governed, let us attribute nothing
unto our merits or power, but to the only grace of God, who by his goodness
and power works in us, and does give us both integrity and uprightness.
And since that it is by his virtue that God does govern and lead us, to the
end that we should know whether we be well governed or no, we must understand
wherein consists integrity and uprightness. If we have well borne away and
learned that which has been said in the places before aledged, we may gather
that the integrity and uprightness stands in this, that by the grace and
power of GOD we should be soled, that in all things we should walk before him
according to his laws: fearing him, and withdrawing ourselves from evil. If
we thus walk, we shall be well governed: our affairs shall go well, and nothing
shall hurt us: but in spite of Satan and al our enemies, we shall always
prosper. And who is it that will harm you, if ye follow that which is good?
Albeit that the enemies of Job 1. Pet. 3. 13.
with Satan did labor diligently, to overthrow and destroy him: yet was he in
such wise governed by his integrity and uprightness Job. 42. 10.
that his enterprises and work came well to pass, and had a good success.
Contralily, albeit that as we see in this world, the wicked, the Iam. 5. 11.
froward, the hypocrites, deceivers, rebels, and disobedient both to God and
their Superiors, do dispatch their business well, and that they prosper in
outward sight, yet shall they be but a smoke, and shall vanishe away, and shall
perish eternally. For as Solomon says, The frowardnes of the transgressors
shall destroy the^. The transgressors shall be destroyed together: and the end
of the ungodly is, they shall be rooted out at the last. And because the
afflicted Psalm. 37. 38. and 39.
do think the time long, because of the infirmity of the flesh, David does
exhort them unto patience, saying: Hope then in the Lord, and keep his way,
and he shall promote thee, that thou shall possess the Land, when the ungodly
shall perish, thou shall see it.

4 Riches avail not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from
death.
It seems at the first sight that Solomon does contrary himself: for he
has said, The rich man's goods are his strong hold, Pro. 10. 15.
and now he says, Riches shall not avail thee in the day of wrath. But if
we remember that which we have said, how the former sentence does not
contain any express commandment or doctrine that ought to be followed, we
shall perceive there is no contradiction therein. For Solomon does not grant
unto the rich that he does well, when he does assure himself so much in his
riches, as to esteem them his strong castle: only he does discover and open
the affections and thoughts of the rich which does rejoice and trust in his
worldly goods. Now he sets down a threatening, whereby he shows that
it is vanity and foolishnes to trust in riches, and that they shall not
preserve the ungodly from destruction, when God shall power forth his wrath
upon them to destroy them. That his threatening is not vain, we may know,
first of al by this, that in the days of Noe, through the great abundance of
riches they eat and drank: but their goods saved them Luke. 17. 27. 28. Esaias.
13. and 14. Iere. 25. 1. Esdras. 1. 1. Dan. 5. 30. Luke. 16. 23.
not from the flood. Likewise in the days of Lot. The riches of the
Babilonians did nothing prevail them, neither did it keep and save them from
the destruction of the Medes and Persians. Long time before whiles they were
yet in glory and magnificence, and that they made al quake before the^, the
Prophets did foretell the day of the Lords wrath, which was to come, and
according unto their saying, it came to pass: as may be seen in Esdras, and
Daniel. The rich man, as records Saint Luke, went to hell. The Psalm 49.
shows well that riches shall not profit in the day of wrath. And therefore he
does exhort us, not to trust in oppression, nor in robbery: Psalm. 62. 10.
Be not vain: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. And our Lord
says, Take heed and beware of covetousness, etc. The riches then of the
wicked shall not profit, but shall turn Luke. 12. 15.
to their loss and destruction: as they are threatened, Go too now ye rich
men: weep and houle on the wretchedness that shall come Iam. 5. 1. 2. 3.
upon you. I speak expressly of the wicked: for of them does Solomon speak:
as he does show by the day of wrath, which shall fall upon them, and not upon the
righteous. For the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night.
Likewise the substance of the 1. The. 5. 2. 3.
righteous, wherewith they shall have made them friends and treasures in
heaven, shall not be unprofitable unto them, when GOD shall declare his wrath,
and execute his vengeance upon the wicked: but their good deeds shall come in
remembrance before God. Solomon Mat. 25. 34.
also does well show it, when he sets here righteousness against riches,
and deliverance from death, against the day of wrath: and that he says, but
righteousness delivers from death. Here according as the Antithesis
requires, we will take righteousness for the conscience of man which is
righteous and upright, whereby man abhors fraud and deceit, spoiling,
oppression and extortion, injury and wrong, al iniquity and wickedness: and
does in no wise desire to do wrong unto his neighbor, what poverty or
misery soever he suffers: but if he have wherewith, he is ready to
distribute of it, and to help the necessity of his poor neighbors, not as
by constraint with grief and heaviness, but liberally with joy, such
righteousness shall deliver a man from death: for God will remember it. When we
thus speak Psalm. 112. 6. 2. Cor. 9. 9.
we do not attribute righteousness to works to deserve life before God: for we
bring works, and draw them out of a pure and right conscience, as out of a
well, whose spring and root is faith. For except that a man be assured that God
loves him, and that he will not suffer him to want, but will give him
sufficient, he cannot have such a conscience: but before al other things he
has temporal gain, or worldly honor in estimation, and cares not though he
does wrong unto his neighbors. It is enough for him that he come to the end
of his enterprise and obtain his desire: but the certentie and assurance that
we have of the goodness, power, and providence of God, does frame the
conscience after such sort, that a man loves rather to suffer hurt, then to
be an offense, or to do any other hurt, or hinderance unto his neighbors, he
will rather rejoice to see his own taken away from him, then to do wrong to
any other, after the example of the good servants of God, of whom the Apostle
speaks, Ye suffered with joy the spoiling of your goods, etc. Now that the
same proccedeth of faith, he shows, saying, Heb. 10. 34.
knowing in yourselues how that ye have in heaven a better, and an enduring
substance. And by following this righteousness, we 35
are delivered from death, he does show it, when he does exhort, saying,
Cast not away therefore your confidence which has and. 38
great recompense of reward, And also when he alleges out of the Prophet,
that the just shall live by faith. When we have so many faithful witnesses
which do allege unto us that righteousness does deliver from death, let us
not desire to follow the wicked, which prosper, as it seems by their riches:
for they shall not endure: but let us follow justice and equity, and we shall
live eternally: not by our merits, but because God is true in his promises.
For to look for the same goodness in true righteousness, we have need of
patience: And by this means we shall be partakers of these promises: as says
the Apostle, For you have need of patience: that after you have done the will
of God, you may receive the promise. Heb. 10. 36.
We see here that the Papists have nothing for to build their merits nor
free will upon: for seeing that it comes of faith, it is the gift of God, the
which makes in us both the will and the deed, eue^ of his good pleasure. Even
so there is nothing for to establishe Phi. 2. 13.
the opinion of those which ask the liberty of the flesh: for righteousness
works not after his fantasy, but according too the will of God, the which he
does declare unto us by his law: which is the rule of perfect righteousness.

5 The righteousness of the upright shall direct his way: but the wicked
shall fall in his own wickedness.
We will take righteousness here, as we did in the former sentence: that is
to say, for a right and sound conscience. This righteousness is not found in
the wicked, dissemblers and hypocrites, in deceivers and liars, in flatterers
and slaunderers, in thieves and usurers: but it is proper unto a righteous man,
who walks in integrity, such is declared unto us. Psalm. 15. Likewise
Solomon does attribute it unto the upright: and also he denies closely that
it does not apperteine unto the wicked. For to show the profit of this
righteousness, he has said here before that it shall diliuer from death:
whereupon follows that the perfect, right and just Eze. 3. 21. and. 18. 5.
and. 33. 14.
man shall not dye, but live for ever. But before that he attain the fruit
of this life, it behooves the perfect man to be a Pilgrim in this world, and
to walk in paths which are not without great difficulties, and lets greatly
painful, the which man of himself cannot ouerpasse, in such wise that
oftentimes he is tempted to forsake his way, and to wander up and down
fields, and to enter into the broad way which leads to destruction. He is (I
say) tempted through the straightes that he meets withal, the which happen
from diverse parts: for in this way he is besieged and assaulted of the
Devil, by the world, and of his own flesh, not only weak, but also
malicious. But his righteousness, his perfect and upright conscience shall
overcome al these difficulties, and shall pass over and escape al these
stoppes: for by the guiding thereof the perfect man shall be strong in our
Lord. He shall fight by faith and hope (the guides and governors of his
conscience) against the world, and shall overcome it. For albeit that he
shall be greatly tempted to leave his way for to follow the wicked which
prosper, and in this life take their pleasures, delights, and ease, that they
may be partakers: yet is he not carried away by such temptation, but going
forward in goodness he is pleased and satisfied with the blessing of God, as
it is said in the 37. Psalm. Also though the world do mock, hate and
persecute him, yet cares he not for it nor fears it: but puts his trust
in the Lord, which has power in heaven and in earth, he prays, Lord, lead
me in thy righteousness. And trusting to be heard, and to obtain his
request, he Psalm. 5. 8. Psa. 18 30. Psalm. 27. 1.
says, The way of God is vncorrupt, etc. The Lord is my light, whom shall I
fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid. The
Lord himself does teach thus too fight, and to be assured, saying, If the
world hate you, know that it hated me before you. Again, And ye now
therefore are in sorrow: John. 15. 18. John. 16. 22.
but I will see you again, and your hearts shall rejoice, and your joy shall no
man take away. As touching the flesh, which labors by his affections and
unbridled lusts, to make and hold him the slave or servant of sin, to make
him go astray, stumble and fall for to kill him, he has no care to fulfill
the lusts thereof, neither does he suffer sin to reign. In this sort,
he makes straight his ways, and takes away all stops and lets: there shall
nothing let him to come unto life, neither will he do this only for
himself, but also for his neighbors, to the end that through his evil life,
he should not turn them away, and be unto them a slander and destruction.
Solomon does signify this same unto us in few words, when he says, The
righteousness of the upright shall direct his way. In this place Solomon
takes direction, for making straight, and coming, for to take away all
stoppes and lettes which hinder and hold us from walking at our ease, and to
attain the place whether we go, without hurt. In this very signification it
is taken, when David says, Make thy way plain before my face. This may be so
understood by that which Psalm. 5. 8.
goes before: for having said, But I will come into thine house in the
multitude of thy mercies, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
temple (and hereby declaring the great desire that he had to serve God
according to his ordinance: for too obtain according to his desire the which
of himself he could not enjoy) he prays, Lead, me O Lord, in thy
righteousness: he alleges the difficulties and stoppes, saying, Because of
mine enemies: afterward he declares it more at large, when he says, For
there is no constancy in their mouth, etc. It is also thus taken: The voice
cries in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make straight in
the desarte, a path for our God, Every valley shal-be exalted, and every
mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be straight, and
the rough places plain. The Esaias. 40. 3. 4.
Prophet does show it, when he says, I will go before thee, and make the
crooked ways straight, etc. Esaias. 45. 2.


Besides this, that we learn this signification by the places before alleged,
Solomon does show here, that it must be so taken* now against
righteousness, he sets wickedness; and against the upright man, the
wicked; and against direction, he sets falling, saying: But the wicked shall
fall in his own wickedness. Albeit the clean contrary appear to outward
sight, and to the carnal sense, and that the Scripture does bear witness of
the prosperity of the wicked, saying, For there are no bands in their death,
but they are lusty and strong: but it is of no continuance, the Prophet Psalm.
73. 4.
David does witness in the same Psalm. For having considered their end, he
says, Surely thou have set them in slippery places, verse. 18.
and castest them down into desolation. Behold he shall travel with
wickedness: for he has conceived mischief, but he shall Psalm. 7. 15. and. 16.
Psalm. 9. 16.
bring forth a lie. He has made a pit and dug it, and is fallen into the
pit that he has made. Again, The wicked is snared in the work of his own
hands. But though the wicked deserves to fall through his wickedness,
because it comes of himself and is his own doing, (for Solomon sets his
wickedness against the righteousness of the perfect man) yet the perfect man
does not deserve by his righteousness to have his way directed to win eternal
joy and felicity. This justice is not properly his own, but it is the gift of
God, that works in us both will and the deed even of his good pleasure. Not
that we are sufficient Phil. 2. 13 2. Cor. 3. 5.
of ourselves, to think any thing as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of
God. For I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified. A good
and perfect conscience then does not 1. Cor. 4. 4.
judge himself to be worthy of, or to deserve any thing at the hands of
God, but it holds it self assured, and is stayed upon the grace of God.
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God,
and whatsoever we ask, we 1. John. 3. 21
receive of him, because we keep his commandementes, and do those things
which are pleasant in his sight. And in this boldness it is given unto things
which are pleasant unto GOD: as it is showed before in the two and twentieth
verse. The righteousness then of the perfect man shall direct his way, because
that being unseparably joined together with faith, it is guided thereby
uprightly to follow the will of GOD according unto his most holy word.

6 The righteousness of the just shall deliver them: but the transgressors
shall be taken in their own wickedness.
When we are in a plain and eeuen way, that is not crooked, nor uneasy: and
also we take good heed where we step and set our feet: what snares soever
are laid therein, may easily be perceived, and escaped with less hurt: even
so as we have seen, the righteousness of the perfect man does direct his
way. Albeit then that they lay snares in diverse sorts, to catch and intrappe
the faithful and righteous, and though they be strongly assaulted: yet
forasmuch as their righteousness does make plain and direct their way, they
escape, and are delivered, in such wise that they avoid the threateninges of
God, they have a good issue of their temptations, and overcome all
persecutions. Noe escaped the flood, wherewith God had threatened the world
six score year before. Lot was not comprehended in the overthrow of Sodom,
though he dwelt in the mids thereof, the which God did foreshewe unto Abraham.
Great are the troubles of the righteous: but the Lord delivers Psalm. 34. 19.
1. Cor. 10. 13 2. Pet. 2. 9.
them out of al. God is faithful, which will not suffer you to be tempted
above that you be able to bear, etc. The Lord knows to deliver the godly
out of temptation, etc.

Also though the persecutours do take away these temporal goods, and kill the
body: yet we escape safe out of their hands, when they can do nothing to the
soul: but for the worldly and transitory goods, we obtain heavenly, and
eternal, for a short life, and full of misery, we shall live in eternal
felicity. It is as though the righteousness of the just should deliver them.
But yet let us not attribute our deliverance unto our righteousness, as ours
properly: but let us know and confess that it is a singular gift of GOD
through Jesus Christ. For ye are of him in Jesus Christ. And because that
this justice 1. Cor. 1. 30. 2. Cor. 5. 20
is given and imputed unto us, the Scripture counts it ours. For he has
made him to be sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made
the righteousness of God in him. Albeit then that the holy Scripture does
attribute righteousness unto us, and also all felicity and eternal
prosperity thereunto: yet let us not think that it either magnifieth us or
our works, or our power, or our free will: but it confesses that God will
suffer his graces and gifts to be lost, but does make them to bring forth
good fruit, which remain for ever. Thus doing he rewards his gifts and
graces in his faithful servants, increasing gift upon gift, and grace after
grace. Solomon does show it well, when he does attribute unto righteousness
the guiding, and directing of the way, and deliverance. Let him therefore which
rejoices, rejoice in the Lord: as Jeremy says, O Lord, I know, that the
way of man is not in himself, neither is it in man to walk and direct his
steps. Iere. 10. 23. Iere. 31. 18. Ezec. 36. 27.
Again he prays, Convert thou me, and I shall be converted. Again,
Ezechiel says, And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them. In this sort, we
will walk and govern ourselves in a sound conscience, righteousness and
uprightness: by the which we will so direct our ways, that we shall not go
astray to be lost for ever, but shall escape al dangers: albeit that it seem
unto the eyes of the wicked, and to the feeling of the flesh, that we be
miserable, and utterly undone and lost without remedy. Contrarily, the wicked
and unfaithful which have no fear nor reverence of God, which have no hope in
his goodness and truth, nor no humanity or faithfulness toward their
neighbors, do now glory and rejoice in their ungodliness, malice, wrongs,
and cruelties, wherein they walk without feeling of conscience, and therein
are very quick and sharp, and think well that they shall remain unpunished,
and shall enjoy their wish and desire: the which for to attain and enjoy, they
use subtilties and crafty dealing, maliciousness and cruelty, and do settle
and assure themselves therein. But they are greatly deceived: for they shall
perish through their own evil, by the which they thought to maintain
themselves. Solomon has already pronounced it, in the third and fifth
verses: and now again he says, But the transgressors shall be taken in
their own wickedness. The Psalmist says, But malice shall slay the wicked.
What maliciousness then, or cruelty soever that the wicked and unfaithful do
Psalm. 34. 21.
invent, yet the perfect and upright men, which have sound consciences, and do
not ymagine any thing, either against the honor of God, or against the profit
and salvation of their neighbors, ought not to be afraid nor doubt whither
they shall escape out of their wicked enterprises: seeing that the faithful in all times have experimented and tried the help and succors of God, and his
mighty deliverance: seeing also (that which is the chiefest) that God who
cannot lie, has promised it, as the scripture does often witness.

7 When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes, and the hope of the unjust shall
perish.
There is no man in this world but lives in some hope, the which we al show
forth by the work whereunto we apply ourselves, and by the counsels and
purposes that we intend and by the enterprises that we take in hand. For
except we tend to some end, and do look for some gain of our works which
should continue and bring some profit, delight, honor or glory, we should be
negligent, and not careful to apply ourselves to something. True it is, that
sometimes we will busy ourselves about some work, and will take in hand some
enterprise without having respect to the end: but in pursuing the thing, we
conceive some hope which makes that man is more diligent about his work: and
because he hops well of his work, his heart and stomach increases and he
goes forewarde the more earnestly and with greater affection. Now as the
works are diverse, and the purposes and the enterprises also, and that there
are both good and bad, and that by the good we tend unto a good end, and by
the evil unto an evil end: and that the one comes of a good desire, and sound
conscience, and so is well ruled, and the other from malice and froward
conscience and thereby is perverse and misgouerned: even so also the end
thereof is contrary: the one sort obtain according to their hope, and the
other are void of their expectation. Solomon has showed it us here above in
the 10. chap. and in the 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. and 30. verses. And now
speaking of them which are void of their hope, he says, when a wicked man
dies, his hope perishes, etc. The first part of this threatening may have
two meanings, and both true. For first of al, when the wicked do see
themselves to prosper in this world, they delight and rejoice in themselves,
they promise unto themselves perpetual felicity, and do brag and boast so
much as they can, hoping that al shall go well for them, and that no evil shall
happen unto them. David says, For the wicked has made boast of his own
hearts desire, and the covetous blesses Psalm. 10. 3. Psalm. 9. 17. Wisd. 5. 14.
himself: but they feel the contrary, as David says, The wicked shall turn
into hell. And thus it is true that the hope of the wicked shall perish, when he
dies. The hope of the ungodly is like the dust that is blown away with the
wind, and like a thin some that is scattered abroad with the storm, and as
the smoke, which is dispersed with the wind, and as the remembrance of him
passes, that tarieth but for a day. Secondly, when the wicked is mighty in
credit, in authority, in riches, in Lordships, and in other things which are
esteemed of in this world, many do set in foot to commend him and flatter
him: every man labors to do him service and to grant his requests: every
man boweth and humbles himself before him, and are at his commandment: for
they hope to win something by him. The flatterers which were in king Saul's
court, which served him in persecuting of David, and encouraged him theretoo,
hoped greatly that Saul would do them good, and promote them unto honor: and
thought not that Saul should so soon have been taken away: but the miserable
end of Saul has made them void of their hope. Also al their like do prove
that when the wicked dies, that the hope they had does perish. This is an
ordinary thing, and therefore it has no need of probation. These two
interpretations are true, as has been said, but to the end that we should
not be compelled to say that Solomon uses here a rehearsing, we will choose
the second sense for the meetest, to the end that of the present sentence we
might make thereof two contrary parts. And for the second which is, also
that the hope of the unjust shall perish. We will apply the first, after this
sort, that the wicked do not come to the end of their enterprises as they
desire and hope, but receive the contrary, whereby they are confounded: and so
their hope perishes, and this is chiefly in death, wherein they shall remain
and be undone for ever. For to show that it cannot otherwise happen, and
that the wicked must needs be frustrate and void of their hope, Solomon
uses a Verb which does not signify that which is or shall be done, but that
which is already done: and thus it does signify unto us, that we should
think the thing to be lost, which we cannot obtain, and whereof there comes
no good end. For if we will give the Verb according to his time, we shall
say that the hope of the wicked is lost and gone. And by this word we may say
that Solomon does signify, that God does not always tarry until death, to
confound the wicked by making them void of their hope: as also it is the
truth, and diverse have proved it true and do still feel it: as it is very
expedient, for the rest and tranquillity of the servants, and children of God.
Again, we have not said, that it is only referred until death. But chiefly
Pharao looked surely too Exo. 1. 1. King. 12. Esaias. 3. 6. Dan. 4.
hold the children of Israel in bondage, so did Roboam also, Zennacherib, and
Nabuchodonosar. They which invent and strive against the Gospel, and do
persecute the faithful from this life, they loose their hope, and shall loose
the same in death, except they come to repentance, and that they settle their
hope more steadfast. Saint Paul when he persecuted the Christians, lost his hope
for this life: the which was helthful unto him, they which have received the
interim, have hope to obtain a counsel which shall refourme all errors. They
have been for a certain years put off: GOD, for his mercy sake, put them off
still, to the end that they should return for to consider from whence they
are fallen, and that they should change their hope.

8 The righteous escapes out of trouble, and the wicked shall come in his
steed.
For to establishe right judgment, we must not judge according to the sight
of our eyes, nor after that that we see happen daily: otherwise we should
esteem the righteous to be most wicked, and the most ungodly should be in our
opinion the best people. But we must take heed, to that which God pronounces,
and if we judge after his sentence, we shall be righteous judges. Now he
excepteth not the righteous man from troubles, as may be seen both by
examples and by witnesses which have been already alleged: but in diverse
places he promises to deliver the faithful man from misery and calamity.
Solomon after the Psalmist and others, does give us witness thereof, when he
says, The righteous escapes out of trouble. As the holy scripture does not
determine the time, so ought we not too assesse special judgment upon this
man or that man: but we must be certain, that if we walk uprightly, and in
soundness of conscience, and that we be patient in adversity (how long and
hard soever they seem unto us) that at time convenient we shal-be delivered.
For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done Heb. 10. 36.
the will of God, ye might receive the promise. The just does not always
escape tribulation, but it taken out of the world. Contrarily what prosperity
soever we have in this world, how long soever it be, yet if we walk with an
evil conscience, we cannot look but for misery and calamity.

This is that which Solomon means, when he says, But the wicked comes in
his place: as if he said, the righteous which was counted unhappy and
miserable through the trouble that oppressed him, does escape the same, and is
placed happily: and the wicked which did oppress him, falls into the misery
wherein he labored to bring and to keep the just: and so he comes in his
place.

When Solomon calls trouble the place of the righteous, it is not to say,
that the righteous have deserved trouble (though we be all worthy to be
afflicted, not only with temporal sorrow, but with perpetual torments, if God
should enter into judgment with us) but he means the wicked (which think
to yield unto the righteous that which he needs, when he troubles and
molesteth him) shall at the last come into the same rank and order, and shall
not escape: as it is declared of Herod, Acts the 12. Chapter. We may also say
that in his place, after the language of Solomon, imports as much as for him,
or above him: as if Solomon would say, that the wicked shall come into trouble
for the just, whom he has oppressed, or in steed that he labored to subdue
the righteous, he shall be placed above him, and the wicked shall be as the
footestoole of the righteous. The first sense is true: so are these two last.
For it is a righteous thing with God, to recompense 2. These. 1. 6.
tribulation to them that trouble you. We may see also in diverse places that
God threateneth, and punishes the wicked for the righteous, Mala. 5. 3. Psalm.
47. 4 Psalm. 49. 14
and that the wicked are set under the just. The victories that God has given
unto his people of Israel against the infidels, have bin a figure thereof: when
truly it is said, They lie like sheep in the grave: death deuoureth them, and
the righteous shall have domination over them in the morning. This same shall be
thus done, because the just are members of Jesus Christ. But to the end, that
none should presume of his own worthiness and excellency, of his own power or
cunning, (because it is said, the just escapes from trouble, and also it
seems at the first sight, that Solomon does attribute some virtue unto the
just, as if he did draw himself out of Psalm. 110. 1
misery: let us know that Solomon uses here a verb passive: whereby he
signifies that it is by an other, that the righteous escapes: and truly we
are like unto a little bird taken in the net, the which can not escape, except
some other break the net. For this cause we must humbly confess it, If the
Lord had not been on our side, when Psalm. 124. 1
men rose up against us, they had then swallowed us up quick. But the wicked
does well deserve trouble, neither ought the fault to be imputed to any other
then to himself: for it is he which falls into it of his own proper malice.

9 An hypocrite with his mouth hurts his neighbor: but the righteous shall be
delivered by knowledge.
The world does so flow with hypocrites, that the Scripture doubts not to
accuse all the body of the people of God, of hypopocrisie. For every one is an
hypocrite and wicked, and every Esai. 9. 17.
mouth speaks folly. Now if the people of God is such, what is the rest of
the world? For whereas there is no true knowledge of God, where his fear has
no place, and men will be well counted of, and judged honest men, there must
needs al be filled with hypocrisy, fraud, and unfaithfulness. Whereupon it
follows, that there are but few people which do not hurt their neighbors
with their mouths. As Solomon says, The hypocrite with his mouth hurts his
neighbor. etc. Here Solomon compares the mouth of the hypocrite unto a
sword, or an instrument wherewith men craftily use to hurt their neighbor,
before he can take heed. And herein he shows, how dangerous the hypocrites
are, and how carefully we ought to take heed of them, to the end that we may
escape their snares, and not to suffer any hurt by them. We shall have the care
required hereunto, if by right knowledge of the truth we reject al wickedness,
and abhor the same: and do love righteousness, giving ourselves to do well.
Solomon does show it us, saying, But the righteous shall be delivered by
knowledge. In all estates, there is some hypocrisy, as we may see, but too
much: but the most dangerous, is the same of false Prophets, which come in
sheep clothing, and by their lying and false doctrine, and by their long
prayers, they bring temporal hurt, devouring widows houses, and which worst
is, they shut up the kingdom of heaven from men. And therefore our Lord
exhorts earnestly his Apostles Luke. 12. 1
to look diligently to themselves for falling into it. And forasmuch as God
suffers no hurt whereby we have labored too hurt our neighbors to go
unpunished, let us know that the warning which Solomon gives, does co^teine a
privy and secret threatening, whereby he foresheweth unto the hypocrites
their destruction, to the end that we should know that their fair show of
holiness and religion, is abominable before God: as our Lord Mat. 7. 21.
also shows us, Every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven. Now as they go to destruction, even so if we
suffer ourselves to be deceived by them, we shall perish also: for if the
blind lead the blind, both fall in the ditche. Wherefore we must stand upon
our watch, as Solomon teaches us, Mat. 15. 14.
and as we have already touched, when he says, but the righteous shall be
delivered by knowledge. If in sou^dnes of conscience we labor to walk
uprightly, as the word does teach us, what assaults soever the hypocrites
do give us, yet shall they not hurt us. Solomon does thus promise us: But
though there be but few that enjoy this promise, and though the hypocrites
do much hurt, we need marvel thereat. For there is an infinite number of
hypocrites, and the righteous and they which have true knowledge, are almost
none, and yet the goodness they have is not theirs. Now forasmuch as there is
none righteous, but so far as it pleases God of his grace to justify and
accept him for righteous, imputing unto him the righteousness of our Lord Jesus
Christ: and though we know nothing but so far as the Lord teaches us by
his holy Spirit, giving us the true understanding of his holy word, and
thereby regenerating and renewing us: it follows, that if we escape the danger
of hypocrites, that it is of the only grace and goodness of God, and that
therein is nothing of our might or power, merit or free will. Wherefore, it is
well required that we should walk in humility, and should be diligent to ask
of God, that it might please him to guide us in righteousness, and teach us the
same. We have need to continue in such prayers, and chiefly against false
Prophets: for they are the most dangerous hypocrites. Saint Paul Psalm. 5. 9.
and 86. 11. Romans 16. 17.
does diligently warn us of such false hypocrites. Now I beseech you
brethren, watch diligently them which cause division and offenses, contrary
to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. Brethren, be ye
folowers of me, and look on Phi. 3. 17. 18
them, which walk so, as ye have us for an ensample. For many walk, of whom
I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of
the Cross of Christ. Beware, least there be any man that spoil you through
Philosophy, Collo. 2. 8.
and vain deceit, through the traditions of men, according to the rudimentes
of the world, and not after Christ, etc.

10 In the prosperity of the righteous the City rejoices: and when the
wicked perish, there is joy.
The prosperity of the righteous may be taken after two sorts: first, for the
joy and prosperity, the ease and rest, the favor and defense, which the
just receive and enjoy by the grace and goodness of God. Secondly, for the
help and succors that the righteous do minister unto them that have need,
and the faithfulness that they use toward al them that they deal with, not
hurting any man, but doing good to al men so much as they can. But after what
sort soever Solomon speaks of the prosperity of the righteous, whither it
be of it which they do, or of that which they receive, it seems, that they
feel and prove the clean contrary of that which he says. Abraham was
very rich in Cattle, in silver, and in gold. He prospered in battle against
the Kings which had taken his cosen Lot captive, etc. And as, God did Genesis 13.
2 and 14. 15. and 18. 3. and 21. 25.
assist him, so was he ready also to do well. The delivering of Lot does
witness it, and the hospitality used to the Angels, etc. And yet whereas he
arrived, they enjoyed not the same, as may be known by the two rauishments of
his wife: and by that, that the servants of Abimelech had violently taken away
a Well of water. Lot was rich and dwelt in Sodom, and yet did well, as
witnesses his hospitality: Genesis 13. 5. Genesis 19. 1 2. Pet. 7. 8.
and albeit he was righteous, yet the city did not enjoy the same. And now
there is no people that are so much and so cruelly pursued in all countries,
cities and villages as are the righteous. Therefore judgment is turned
backewarde, and justice stands Esaias. 59. 14
far of: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. And
if the righteous labor to help their neigbours after their power, and to be
a good ensample, they are judged to be hypocrites and ambitious. Even so then
it seems that the city does not rejoice at the prosperity of the
righteous. If they be rich, they are envied therefore, and if it be possible
they shall be spoiled thereof: If they would make any rich, they are judged,
they would be seen of men, and be praised and honored therefore. For to answer
this, let us first know that after this present Antithesis or comparison,
wherein the prosperity of the righteous is set against the destruction of the
wicked, we must take the prosperity in the first signification. Secondly
there is no rule so general but that there is some exception: or else that
Solomon does here take the City for chief and best part thereof, which are
the honest people dwelling therein, which desire and seek the peace and
prosperity of the righteous, and are glad when the righteous do well, and be
void of trouble, or else, better to speak, and more agreeing with the
Antithesis (seeing that God rejoices not at the destruction of the wicked, as
he witnesses, and that the children of God for to follow their heavenly
Father, ought not to rejoice at the perdition of the wicked) we will take
rejoicing, and also the cry of joy, for the cause that brings them forth.
We Eze. 18. 23 and 33. 11. Luke 15. 4
do not willingly rejoice at our evil success and loss, but when our
affairs do prosper well, then it causes us to rejoice and to sing for joy.
Solomon therefore means, that the city is happy and blessed, when the
righteous do prosper in the midst thereof: and yet more happy, when the
wicked are rooted out of it: as Solomon does signify it when he is not
contented to say there is joy, but he says, there is a cry or song of joy.
This is after a sort showed us, when God promises Abraham that he will not
destroy Sodom, if there Genesis 18. 32.
may be found ten righteous in the midst of it. If then we desire that our
City should prosper and be happy, and that for the happiness and prosperity
it does rejoice, we must study and be given to righteousness, and work, so
much as we can, that the righteous may dwell without any trouble, without
contempt, and also without persecution: and not to hinder nor turn them away
from doing their duty. As touching the rest, for to take our profit of this
present sentence, and of the exposition thereof, we must beware of trusting and
leaning upon our own diligence, but rather that by Faith we look unto God,
who teaches us by his word, that it is he only which provides good
Magistrates and rulers, and he alone that rules countries and Cities. And thus
if we will rejoice at the prosperity of our country, we must wish and desire
the good success and advancement of the righteous: and forasmuch as it is a
work depending upon the providence of God, we must pray unto him that it
would please him to raise up just and righteous men, and to make them go
forward, and to prosper them in the vocation whereunto he has called them,
and that he would hinder and stop the wicked from coming forward, and to
root out them which go forward.

11 By the blessing of the righteous, the City is exalted: but it is subverted
by the mouth of the wicked.
Forasmuch as Solomon sets here the blessing of the righteous against the
mouth of the wicked, it is not needeful to examine after how many sorts
blessing is taken in the Scriptures, for the understanding of this place. For
the Antithesis does show us that Solomon by the blessing, means the
gratiousnes and goodness that proceeds from the mouth. The righteous out of
their good treasures, do bring forth good things: they gladly follow the
counsel of Saint Paul: Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
mouths: but that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister
grace unto the hearers. And be ye not drunk Ephe. 4. 29 and 5. 18. 19 Col.
3. 16. and 4. 6.
with wine, wherein is excess but be ye filled with the Spirit, speaking unto
yourselues in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual songs, etc. Again, Let the
word of Christ dwell in you plenteously, in all wisdom, teaching and
admonishing your own selves, in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual songs,
etc. Let your speech be gracious always, and seasoned with salt, that ye
may know how to answer every man. If any man speak, 1. Pet. 4. 11
let him speak as the words of God. The blessing therefore of the righteous
stands in good counsels, in holy exhortations and corrections, in unfeigned
prayers, in praise and thanksgiving, proceeding from a good and pure affection
of the heart. By this blessing the City is exalted, as Solomon says, and
also as experience shows. Egypt was exalted by the counsel of Joseph: for
Genesis 41. 33
insteede to be suppressed and consumed by famine, it had provision to sustain
it self, and therewith it was the refuge of other poor hungry starued
people, and chiefly of the household of Jacob. The children of Israel were in
great distress, and were mightily oppressed Exo. 1. 11.
by the cruel bondage that Pharao laid upon them: but by the counsels,
exhortations, prayers, and supplications of Moses and Aaron, they were so
preserved and exalted, that they were made victors and conquerers over them
that had oppressed them: they robbed them, and escaped out of their hands:
they were saved by the red sea, through the which they went with dry foot,
but their enemies were overwhelmed and drowned in the bottom thereof. So long
as the children of Israel would believe the counsels of their good Judges and
Kings, and would receive and follow the doctrine, admonitions and
corrections, and trembled at, and feared the threatenings of the Prophets, they
were preserved and exalted: for they were delivered from their enemies, and
made conquerers. The Ecclesiastes or Preacher says: I have also seen Eccle.
9. 13. 14. 15. 16.
this wisdom under the sun, and it is great unto me. A little City, and
few men in it, and a great King came against it, and compassed it about, and
builded fortes against it: And there was found therein a poor and wise man,
and he delivered the City by his wisdom. Now that by wisdom, he means
the words spoken wisely, it is manifest by this that he says, That the
wisdom of the poor wise man was despised, and his words not heard. We had al
deserved by our sin to be oppressed with eternal damnation, but when by
Faith and repentance, we have received the doctrine of the Gospel, which is
the chief part of the blessing Ephe. 2. 6.
of the righteous, we have been exalted up into heaven. We see then how
profitable, yea and necessary it is, to hear and ^olow them which speak
rightly: and that Solomon says the truth, when he pronounces that the
City is exalted, etc. even when it receives quietly the blessing. Noe was
righteous, and nothing spared Hebr. 11. 7 2. Pet. 2. 5. Genesis 19. 2.
his word, in admonishing, reproouing, threatening, and condemning the world
by the building of the arc: and is called the eight person, a Preacher of
righteousness, and yet the world was not exalted, etc. Just Lot, both with
sight and hearing exhorted diligently the Sodomites, and rebuked them, and yet
they were not exalted, etc. The most righteous, and righteous of al other, our
Lord Jesus Christ spared not his blessing, but bestowed it both in words and
miracles, which were the destruction of many unfaithful and indurate. Then
began he to rebuke the Cities wherein many of his miracles had been done. etc.
The like we may see nowadayes, in diverse places. We must therefore understand,
that the City which with fear and reverence receives the blessing of the
righteous, shall be exalted thereby, that is to say, it shall obtain peace, rest,
and felicity, and shall remain firm and stable for ever, though the world
judge otherwise. Contrarily, if we give ear to the wicked, and delight in
their speaking, we run to destuction: as Solomon shows, saying, But it is
subverted by the mouth of the wicked.

The children of Israel have often tried it in the wilderness, and after when
they were come into the land of Canaan. They which give credit unto Mahomet
and to the Pope, have their part therein: so have they also which have received
the blasphemous interim. The leasings, flattering speeches, slanderings, idle
and wanton words, and filthy communication bring great destruction: but in
the mean while, the gates of hell cannot prevail against them that are
builded upon the rock. Mat. 16. 18.


12 He that despises his neighbor, is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
understanding will keep silence.
We count a man to be very courageous, and to have an upright and stout
heart, when he goes boldly forward with his enterprise, be it right or
wrong, not caring for any man, and without fear of offending, and is ready to
bear injuries and wrongs, dispraise, and diffamation, reproaches, and
cauillations, violences and cruelties, if it appear unto him, that he cannot
otherwise come to the end of his purpose and enterprise. This is the judgment
of the carnal, and worldlings, which think that their neighbors do nothing
belong unto them. But if by the word of God we behold that we al come from
one Father Adam, we shall know how we belong one unto an other, and that we
are al one flesh and one blood. Thus much for the carnal conjunction, whereby
we are taught that we are faintharted, and without courage, foolish and void
of care, understanding and right judgment, if we despise our neighbors: and
chiefly when we show openly the contempt, in being moved and raising noise
and vprores upon them, in driving them away, and rejecting them through
impatiencie, or arrogancy, or choler. Solomon shows it, when he sets
disdain against silence; and want of wisdom, unto a man of understanding: and
that he calls him which is despised, neighbor. Now in his language which
he uses, Neighbor, signifies him which pleases us, him that we desire,
him that we love, and whose company we keep, or he to whom we owe such
gentleness, familiarity and loving kindness. Whosoever therefore does despise
him, does show himself very weak, and wanting good will and pure affection:
for he strives against his nature, and does against that which he owes by
right of kindred and stock. Now if for the respect that we are al of one
carnal parentage, it is not laweful for us to despise our neighbors, except
we would have men to judge of us by the word of God, that we have a faint
heart: by a more strong reason, they which brag and would be counted
Christians, ought well to beware from despising their neighbors, nor give any
token of contempt, either by words or gesture: and that in following the great
humility and modesty of their head, which Esa. 42. ^.
will not cry nor stand up against them, etc. But seeing they are members of one
body, under one head Jesus Christ, they ought to be careful the one for the
other, without any contempt of the vilest and basest, and without envy against
the most excellent: As Saint Paul Romans 15. 1. 1. Cor. 12. 12 Gal. 6. 1.
does show it. Thus much for the spiritual parentage, in the which the
conjunction is far more straight and more near, then is the knitting
together of carnal kindred. Wherefore, the true Christians should be very
careful to maintain this conjunction, by following the exhortation of Saint
Paul, Now therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender
mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekenes, long suffering, etc. Behold,
how good and how comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell even together. Psalm.
133. 1. Esaias. 2. 4.
Let them mark this, fulfilled in us, They shall break their swords also into
mattockes, and their spears into sithes: nation shall not lift up a sword
against nation, neither shall they learn to fight any more. Again, The woolfe
also shall dwell with the lamb, and the Leopard and 11. 6.
shall lie with the kidde and the calfe, and the Lion, and the fat beast
together, and a little child shall lead them. Thus doing, we will not
disdain our neighbors, neither shall be faintharted, but we shall be wise and
of understanding, we shall be quiet and peaceable, gentle and kind: and this
which Solomon says shall be fulfilled in us, But a man of understanding will
keep silence. The silence or secretnesse whereof Solomon speaks stands not
in speaking never a word, and to be as it were dumb: but because that in
silence al things are quiet, and without noise, without vprores, and without
contention, the Scripture takes silence for peace, gentleness, and lowly
behavior, sweet and loving conversion: and also for abstinence, when we
forbear to do any thing, and that we abstain from it, and that we vex not
ourselves, or that we be not grieved for any thing which happens, and that
we strive not as the amassed and witles do. Silence is so taken in some places,
as follows: Now Jacob heard that he had Genesis 34. 5
defiled Dinah his daughter, etc. Therefore Jacob held his peace, until they
were come. The Lord shall fight for you: therefore hold your peace. So they
despised him, and brought him no presents: but Exo. 14. 14 1. Sam. 10. 27 Esa.
41. 1. Esa. 11. 2.
he held his tongue. Keep silence before me, O Islands, and let the people
renew their strength. etc. Now to be wise, and to be thus silent, we must
learn it of our Lord and receive it from him. For on him it is that the
spirit of the Lord rests: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of
the Lord. He shall not fail Esa. 42. 4.
nor be discouraged, til he have set judgment in the earth. And also he
himself exhorts us to learn of him, and promises rest unto Mat. 11* 29.
to our souls.

13 He that goes about as a slaunderer, discovers a secret: but he that is
of a faithful heart, conceileth a matter.
There is no man but desires to have a privy friend which is no talker and
babbler, to the end that if he have any thing in his heart which does trouble
and grieve him, that he may safely open the same unto his friend, and that he
may be somewhat eased and relieved: he hops also that that which he has
declared, shall be kept secret, or at least wise that the thing shall not be
expounded otherwise then it was spoken: and that he will not labor to hurt him
nor to bring him into hatred with his neighbor, in following the commandment,
Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor: Thou shall not walk
about with tales among thy people. Exo. 20. 16. Leu. 19. 16.
There are some which think and believe, that it is not evil done to reveal
secrets, to condemn their neighbors and to proclaim their imperfections:
but Solomon does condemn them, calling the^ slaunderers, when he says, he
that goes about as a slaunderer, does reveal a secret. And it is for good
cause that such people are condemned. For first of al they are hypocrites.
Secondly, they are Mat. 7. 5.
transgressors of the law. Thirdly, they set themselves before the law in
condemning it. Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil
of his brother, or he that condemns Iam. 4. 11.
his brother, speaks evil of the law, and condemns the law: and if thou
condemnest the law, thou art not an obseruer of the law, but a judge.
Infidelity and unfaithfulness has taken root in their hearts, whereby they
are led to betray their neighbors, in discovering that which they ought to
keep secret. Solomon shows this unfaithfulness, when he sets, the
faithful heart, against the slaunderer, saying, He that it is of a faithful
heart, conceileth a matter. He that inuenteth no treason against his
neighbor, will keep his mouth that it shall not hinder his neighbor, for to
publishe his imperfections, or speak leasing of him: otherwise he should not
be of a faithful heart, from the abundance whereof the mouth speaks. Solomon
is not contented to say faithful simply, but adds, of heart: not that there
is any faithful which are unfaithful of heart, but it is for a more greater
expression, and for to show us that what fair countenance or goodly face that
we bear to our neighbors, except it proceed with good and true affection of
heart, that there is none but al deceit in us, treason and unfaithfulness, as
we know it, and that our conscience does so judge and condemn us, though we
labor to counterfaite and dissemble it with ourselves, and that we strive to
make ourselves believe that we proceed faithfully, when by counterfayting we
mock our neighbors. Further let us note, that the 2. part of this sentence
agrees with the same that is contained in the 10. chap. and 12. verse. But
love covers al misdeeds. For if we be not led by love, we cannot be
faithful unto our neighbors, for to dissemble 1. Cor. 13. 1.
their imperfections: there is no strength in us that is worth any thing
except it be exercised by love. Now if by love we must exercise
faithfulness the which is set against slander, it follows that the
slaunderer is led with hatred to discover the secret, and consequently that
he is a murderer. Whosoever hates his brother, is a manslear. Whereof it
follows that Solomon 1. John. 3. 15.
does closely condemn him unto eternal death which reuealeth secrets. He that
loves not his brother, abides in death: again, You 1. John. 3. 14. and. 15.
know that no manslayer has eternal life abiding in him. Contrarily, we know
that we are translated from death to life in that that we love the brethren.
Yet nevertheless let us not fear to be accused of slander, though we accuse
them which lead a slanderous life, though we rebuke them, reprove and
threaten them, either privately or publicly, and though we labor to get them
punished and chastened, to the end that slanders may be taken away from the
people of GOD, and the offenders brought again unto GOD by true repentance so
much as we can. Otherwise we should be unfaithful unto God and to his
Church, we should Mat. 18. 17. 1. Tim. 5. 20. 2. Tim. 4. 2.
be like them which suffer the sheep to be devoured in sparing the woolues.
Let us know therefore that this sentence of Solomon ought not to hinder us
from following the doctrine of our Lord, and of Saint Paul.

14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but where many counselors are, there
is health.
Albeit that a nation or a people is compounded of many persons which have
their fantasies and counsels, their works and deeds not only diverse, but
also very often contrary, and that the one tend unto one end, and the other
to the contrary, so that the one conspire to undo and destroy that which the
others do, and build, yet for all this are but one body: therefore when there
is such diversity, yea rather contrariety, the people must needs go unto
destruction and be scattered. Every kingdom divided against it self shall be
brought to naught, and every city or house, Mat. 12. 25.
divided against it self, shall not stand. And therefore the Lord which has
created the people and nations, and has placed them on the earth, as he has
seen good, making a great similitude to dwell together, not willing to have his
work broken and hindered, but desiring the increase and conservation thereof,
has constituted and appointed heads and superiors, for to guide and govern
many under one law and ordinances, and to cause all the people by the^ to tend
al to one end, though it have many and sundry members, and that their states
and vocations are diverse. But such a government is not of small weight, neither
the charge of easy execution, so that it is not in the power of every one to
occupy if he will such administration and office. Al brains are not settled
nor well advised: but for the greatest part are wandering and amassed, and few
there be which know how to govern themselves, much less how to govern
others. If every man therefore should meddle in government, there should be
great disorder and confusion and al should fall into decay. Wherefore, it is
needful that none should take in hand this administration, except he were
called of GOD, and that by his grace he be endewed with wisdom, for to know
well to maintain peace and unity amongst them which seek no war nor
dissension, and destroy them which are at debate and discord together, and
make them yield to peace and quietness which desire nothing but tumultes and
seditions: otherwise al things go to destruction. Solomon does signify the
same, when he says, Where no counsel is, the people fall. The counsel which
here he means is that which chiefly is required in Kings and Princes, that
they may rule woorthily, whereof has been spoken here above in the 8.
chapter, 14. 15. and 16. verses. I have said chiefly: for to them is this
word directed. Be wise Psalm. 2. 10. and 82. 6.
now therefore, O ye Kings: be learned ye that are judges of the earth. It
is they to whom GOD does this honor to call them Gods. They are they that
exercise the judgments of God. And also when Kings and Magistrates are
destitute of godly counsel, the 2. Chro. 19. 6
people whose eyes are set upon them, and does follow them, do run into
destruction. The children of Israel have truly proved it, when they wanted
good judges and good kings: and also for to foretell them their destruction, the
Lord does threaten to deprive them of good and wise governors, and
counselors, saying, I will appoint children to be their Princes, and babes shall
rule over them. Esaias. 3. 4.
But what counsel soever the superious give, except the people do attend to
follow them, they shall fall. Noe gave good counsel, whereby he labored to
reduce the world, and to teach it the way of righteousness: but the world
ceased therefore nevertheless to fall. Moses was a wise counselor, and
executed his office faithfully, but yet the people of Israel did often fall
under his government. The people of Israel had many good judges and kings
replenished with divine counsel, under whose government they fell. The same
people also had many good Prophets: but because they hardened their hearts,
and would not receive their doctrine, but contemned their exhortations,
warnings, reprehensions and threatenings, and persecuted them, they fell: And
yet to this day remain so decayed, because they refused our Lord Jesus Christ
and his Apostles. etc. We ought to fear least we happen into like fall, not
only corporal, but also spiritual and eternal, if having good Princes and
faithful Pastors which do truly teach us, we refuse and disdain their
counsel: but if we will avoid falling, we must be diligent folowers of
counsel, I say the good and holy counsels of such as have the charge to guide
and govern us, that we become subject and obedient unto our Lords and
superiors in that which is not against God, and that in fear and reverence
we receive the wholesome doctrine of our Pastors and Ministers, and that we
be not so lightly and easily carried away to follow the foolish and false
opinions of some troublesome person. Thus doing we shall remain steadfast and
stable, and shall never perish. Solomon does signify the same saying, But
where many counselors are, there is health. Whereupon let us first of al note
that except we follow both the spiritual and temporal government of such as
are appointed and ordained of God, for to counsel and lead us, we have no
steadfastness nor sure abiding, but shall fall. For it is as much as if we were
destitute of wise and good counselors. Secondly forasmuch as we have no
manner of salvation, but from the grace and goodness of GOD, it follows right
that it is he which provides men of counselors that can give good counsel: as
also we may see by the the confession of Joseph. Likewise in Exodus, where
Moses confesses that he is sent of God. The Prophets also do show it,
Gene. 41. 16. Esa. 1. 25. 26
when they speak nothing but the word of God, and pronounce that he has
sent them. God does teach us it, saying, Then will I turn mine hand upon
thee, and burn out thy dross, til it be pure, and take away al thy tin.
And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the
beginning. etc. Thirdly, seeing that among a number of men of counsel there is
health, one man alone ought not to presume that by his wisdom he is
sufficient to lead and govern a nation: but if he be called unto such an
office and administration, he ought to look and provide, for honest and
faithful men to be his helpers, for to ease him and to order the people with
him, by following the counsel that Iethro gave unto Exo. 18. 18.
Moses.

15 He shall be sore vexed that is surety for a stranger: and he that hates
suretieship, is sure.
Albeit that Solomon does thus speak, yet it is not to say, that he allows
a man should do according as he says here. For as touching the first part,
he should allow the carfulness of the flesh, and worldly sorrow, the
distrust and extreme fear of poverty, the which he signifies by shall be
sore vexed: as we may understand, when against to be sore vexed, he
sets, to be sure. Such affliction ought to be far from the minds and
hearts of the faithful, which are the children of God their father, who has
care over them: and ought to be assured of him without al doubt: as Christ and
the Apostle S. Paul do give warning, the which is meet Mat. 6. Heb. 13. 5. 6.
for to comfort them that are bound for other: for that which does most of al
vex them, is that they fear to be pressed and constrained to pay the debt of
the stranger whom they have pledged, without recovering payement, and so they
come to poverty. Seeing then that GOD by his word does warn us, not to
afflict ourselves after this sort, nor to fear what hurt man can do unto us:
let us know that Solomon does not allow such afflictions: but does declare
how for the most part they which become surety for others, are affectioned and
vexed, when afterward they see they cannot obtain payement of him for whom
they are become surety: then they are troubled and greatly vexed in their
minds. Solomon does well express it, when he is not contented simply to say,
he is afflicted: but he is sore vexed or afflicted. And by this expression he
shows us that it is not good, suddenly and easily to become surety for such
as we know not. As touching the second part, which is, He that hates
suretieshippe, is sure. If he allowed that which he pronounced, he should
allow two vices: The first is, hatred, whereof the children of God ought to
be so void. that they should hate no man for any hurt they shall do to them:
but should love their enemies, and be ready to help them. Solomon then does
not allow that we should hate the notaries and scriueners which do bind us and
require us to be bound for another, albeit that often by such obligations we
suffer much evil: but he painteth us out the affection of the greatest part
of them which bind themselves when they see themselves troubled, and are
arested upon the obligation, then they hate the notaries and scriueners, and do
curse them, and cannot behold them with loving countenance: and if they could,
they would prove them false and counterfaite men: for often they spare not to
say, they are such. The second vice that he should allow, were a vain
confidence and hope that they have never to want when they have some riches,
and have not been surety for other. Albeit that in what estate soever we be,
how miserable soever the same be before our eyes and in the feeling of the
flesh, we must never mistrust nor fear to want, but that we must be assured of
the providence, carfulness and goodness of our heavenly father, and say with
David, The Lord is my sheephearde, I shall Psalm. 23. 1.
want nothing: (otherwise we pray not in true faith when we pray, give us
this day our daily bread) notwithstanding what great worldly prosperity soever
we have, we must not trust theretoo: for it is not in our power to maintain
ourselves therein, but the Lord has changed it, as he does see good: for all
things are in his hand, and he does dispose as he pleases, without that
any man can reprove him of injustice, or cruelty, or of tyranny. Job has well
tried the change, and has confessed that it came of God. When the wicked do
feel it, they grind their teeth, and murmur thereat, and do despite GOD in
blaspheming him. Let us follow righteous Job, if we have any wealth, let us
not be neuerthe more assured, nor rejoice any whit the more in them, but in
the only goodness of the Lord and in his knowledge. Let not the wise man
glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man Iere. 9. 23.
glory in his strength, neither the rich man glory in his riches. And if we
loose let us take patience, on what side soever the loss comes, knowing that
nothing happens unto us but by the providence of God. The Lord kills, and
makes alive, brings down to the grave, and raises up. The Lord makes
poor. and makes 1. Sam. 2. 6. and 7.
rich. Moreover besides this, let us note, that albeit that Solomon does not
allow that any man should be assured because he is not bound, yet he does
somewhat teach us that it is far better to enjoy our goods freely and at
liberty, then to be bound for other, and chiefly when he is unknown, as
also it has been handled in the sixth chapter. Furthermore let us note that
Solomon does teach us, that if we love our neighbors as we ought, that we
will not require them to be surety for us, except it be necessary, and also
that we have wherewith to answer them and to keep them from sorrow, and to
maintain them that they may possess their goods and safely enjoy them.

16 A gracious woman atteineth honor: and the strong men attain riches.
Whiles we live in this life, and keep a house, and walk with our neighbors
and acquaintance, we have need of reputation, not that we should seek the
glory of the world, but that we should so live, that they amongst whom
we dwell, may find no fault in our kind of living, but that it should be so
quiet, honest, just, and holy, that they may be constrained to glorify GOD,
and to esteem and judge well of us, to praise and commend us. Solomon does
show us the way to come unto such reputation, when he says, a gracious
woman attaineth honor. He teaches us to be gracious, if we would attain
honor: albeeit that he names but the woman, and does promise her honor, if
she be gracious. He speaks thus, because that man in the household is the
head and superior, and that the woman owes him subjection and obedience. Man
is not of the woman, but the woman is of the man. Wives, submit yourselues unto
your husbands, 1. Cor. 11. 8. Ephe. 5. 22.
as unto the Lord. Now for to be subject and give obedience as it behooves,
she must be gracious, that is to say, that she should govern the household
after her husbands desire, without contrarying him in any wise: that she do
nothing in the house with trouble and vprores, but that she govern her
household in all, softness, humility, peace, and gentleness: and that without
she be not an offense unto his neighbors, neither by word nor deed: but that
she be sober, modest, humble, and gentle toward al men, and chiefly toward
his neighbors, amongst whom she is most conversant. This is the graciousnesse
that Solomon requires here of the woman: and Saint Paul, I will therefore
that the younger 1. Tim. 5. 14. Titus. 2. 3.
women marie, and bear children, and govern the house, and give none occasion
to the adversary to speak evil. The elder women likewise, that they be such
in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not subject too much
wine, but teachers of honest things. Likewise, let the wives be subject to
their husbands, that even they which obey not the word, may 1. Pet. 3. 1.
without the word be won by the conversation of the wives. The women which
are thus gracious, shall attain honor. First of al toward their husbands,
except they be out of their wits, furious and mad. Honest and good men
having such wives, will make great account of them, and will earnestly love
them, and will show al humanity and gentleness to them. Secondly, the
household, as the children and servants, will love them, will honor and
reverence them, will obey them, and fear to offend them. Thirdly, their
neighbors will esteem well of them, they will speak well of them, and will
behold them with great admiration, and will be at their commandment in all
honesty. And seeing that Solomon promises unto gracious women, honor: when
women see themselves disdained, let them confess that they are not so gracious
as they ought to be, or that for their sins God does humble and make them
contemptible, or else that they have to do with discourteous and churlish men,
whereby God will prove their patience. For also this is the manner of the
worldlings, to contemn and persecute the true servants of God. Notwithstanding
God cease not therefore to perform his promise toward women, so far as
is expedient for their spiritual health. What contempt then soever they be in,
yet let them not cease to show themselves gracious. And if women which are the
weakest vessels, ought to strive to show themselves gentle for to attain
honor: by a more stronger reason ought men (which are the heads and ought to be
more strong, and show by their example the way to the women) to be gentle for
to obtain honor, otherwise they are well worthy to be despised. But although
the churlish, whether they be men or women, deserve well to be despised and
deprived of al honor, the which Solomon does attribute but unto the gracious
women, yet because God has commanded children to honor their fathers and
their mothers, they must honor their parents, of what manners soever they be,
when obeying and being at their commandment, they break not the law of the
Lord. Children obey your parents in all things: for that is well pleasing unto
the Lord. The men and maid servants for to do their duty well, should not
take heed unto the manners of their Collo. 3. 2^. and 22.
masters and dames, but they should look to be subject and give obedience in all things, not only to the good, but also unto the sharp and rigorous. By a
more strong reason then must we obey the^ that Ephe. 6. 1. 5. and 2. 9. 1.
Pet. 2. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 2.
are good and gracious, otherwise, so much as in them lies, they abolish the
promise. And the strong men attain riches. With estimation we have need of
riches for to sustain this corporal body during this life. And therefore,
after that Solomon has showed us how we shall attain honor, he teaches us how
we shall get riches. Wherein we see it is necessary that a father of household
should be strong, and that there with he should exercise himself to labor
and to put forth his strength for if he be idle, slack and slouthful, and
does not bestow the time about good works, after his estate whereto he is
called, it is as much as if he were feeble and weak, and were destitute of
strength and might, yea and much worse. For the man which cannot labor, ought
not only to be excused from labor, but also vpholden, and the strong ought
for to assist him, and to distribute unto him his daily bread, according as his
necessity requires. But forasmuch as God has ordained from the creation of
the world that man should labor: for the Lord God took man and placed him
in the garden of Eden, for to dress Genesis 2. 15. and 3. 17. Ephe. 4. 28. 2.
These. 3. 10.
and keep the garden, and that since the fall of Adam, necessity has bin laid
upon him to work, and that S. Paul agreeing to this scripture, does admonish
us, let him that stoale, steal no more but let him rather labor, and work
with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give unto him that
needs. This we warned you of, that if there were any, which would not
work, that he should not eat. We do not understand thereby that it is
necessary that every one should imploye himself to the labor of the bodily
hands in the earth, or any other handie work. For as the powers are diverse,
so are the states and vocations, and so also are the labors diverse. And the
mighty which employ their might to labor either with body or with mind, or
with preaching, according as they are called, do gather riches. They get
enough, for to maintain them in this present life, and are contented with that
which it pleases GOD to send them, and thus they are rich: for as it is
commonly said, a contented mind is great riches, and there is no greater
riches nor more commodious then is contentation. But meek men shall possess
the earth, Psalm. 37. 11 and 16.
etc. Again, a small thing unto the just man is better, then great riches to
the wicked and mighty. If then we will get riches, let us study for
righteousness, and thereby let us employ the strength that GOD has given us
either corporal or spiritual unto goodness, every man according to his
vocation. For it is not necessary that all men occupy themselves in bodily
labor. For as our Lord says of the ministers of his word, The labourer is
worthy of his hyre. The Lord also has ordained, Mat. 10. 10. 1. Cor. 9. 14.
1. Tim. 5. 17. Act. 18. 3. and 20. 33. and 34.
that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel. The elders that
rule well, are worthy of double honor, specially they which labor in the
word and doctrine. But some will say that S. Paul was an Evangelist, and yet
he ate his bread with the labor of his hands. Again, he says, I have
coueted no man's silver, nor gold, nor apparel. Yea, ye know that these hands
have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I answer,
that it is lawful for them which also are as well able as S. Paul to do as 1.
Cor. 9. 12. and 2. 11.
he did. If others with you be partakers of this power, are not we rather?
nevertheless, we have not used this power. Likewise it is lawful for them to
live of their calling and ministry, as it appears by the places alleged
before. But when the riches are attributed unto the mighty, let us first of al
note that it is not to say that our power deserves riches, otherwise we should
not need to ask our daily bread: but let us know that the Lord does give us
power, and the use thereof, as by an instrument to help our necessity. And
God is able to make al grace to abound toward you, that ye always 2. Cor. 9. 8.
having al sufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work. Secondly
that in living ydlely, we should not desire to live at the Psalm. 128. and 62.
11.
cost of other, but following the commandment of God, we should eat of our
own labor, and we shall be blessed. Thirdly, that it is lawful for us to
possess riches, so that we come not to them by unlawful means, and that we
do not set our hearts upon them. Saint Paul also does not command us to
cast away riches, but that we should not wax proud of them. Charge them
that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, and that they 1.
Tim. 6. 17.
trust not in uncertain riches, but in the living God, which gives us
abundantly al things to enjoy. And albeeit that our Lord does say unto his
disciples, Verily I say unto you, that a rich man shall Mat. 19. 23.
hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven: yet does he not condemn riches,
but them that put their trust in them. Children, how Mark. 10. 24.
hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God.
Fourthly when we imploye our strength to labor according to our vocation,
though we do not heap together abundance of goods, and that we do not
greatly gain in outward sight: yet if we be contented with that which it
pleases God to send us, we enjoy riches and obtain great gain. Fifthly, if
we 1. Tim. 6. 6.
be poor and miserable, let us acknowledge that we do not bestow our
labor, after the strength that God has given us, but do hyde and bury the
talent of the Lord in the earth, by living in slothfulness and carelessness:
or that we do not faithfully, and truly our work: or that we labor
excessiuely and too earnestly to gather riches together. Or else let us learn
that the Lord knows it is more expedient for us to be poor then to be
rich. Sixthly, let us confess the goodness of GOD, which is not contented to
give us strength, but would that the same should profit us, and that it
should get and obtain for us riches to keep us. In the seventh place,
although it seem like that the worldlinges are rich, and that the faithful
are tempted with their prosperity, Psalm. 73. 12.
and to say, Lo, these are the wicked, yet prosper they always and increase in
riches: yet do they not properly attain to riches, for they are sooner
deprived of them then they would, neither are Luke. 12. 16. Psa. 73. 18.
they partakers of the heavenly. Surely thou have set them in slipperie places,
and castest them down into desolation. But the faithful do truly attain
riches, for they are always ready to forsake them for to win the true and
heavenly.

17 He that is merciful, rewards his own soul: but he that troubles his
own flesh, is cruel.
Though a man does give but a little, if the same be according to his
ability, yet does he truly help the necessity of his neighbor (as says
S. James, If a brother or a sister be naked and destitute Iam. 2. 15.
of daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart in peace, warm
yourselues, and fill your bellies, notwithstanding ye give them not those
things which are needful to the body, what helps it? And whosoever has this
worlds good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his compassion
from him, how dwells the love of God in him?) It follows seeing that
Solomon calls him merciful, that rewards his own soul, that in 1. John.
3. 17.
this place, the soul is taken for the neighbor, whom although that God has
commanded us to love as ourselves, we should esteem as our own soul:
seeing also that we are members one of Romans 12. 5.
another and one self body, we ought to esteem the souls of our neighbors,
as our own, and to follow that which is said, for by one spirit are we al
baptized into one body. And all that believed, 1. Cor. 12. 13. Ephe. 4. 4. Acts.
2. 44. and 4. 32.
were in one place, and had al things common. And the multitude of them that
believed, were of one heart, and of one soul. Thus doing, we shall be merciful
to our souls, for we shall succor the necessity of our needy members and in
the end we shall obtain reward. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
obtain mercy. Make your friends with the riches of iniquity etc. He Mat.
5. 7. and 25. 34. Luke. 16. 9. Psa. 112. 9.
has distributed and given to the poor: his righteousness remains for
ever: his horn shall be exhalted with glory. Contrarily, he that takes care
but of himself, is not merciful unto his neighbor, nor to his own body,
though he have great abundance of riches, and is merry and does make good
cheer. Woe be to you that are Luke 6. 24. and 12. 20. and 16. 19.
rich: for ye have received your consolation. O fool, this night will they
fetch away thy soul from thee: then whose things shall those be which thou
have provided? We see therefore that the world judges amiss, when it judges
that men are merciful unto themselves when they make great cheer. Seeing then
that the scripture does not call him merciful that is good to himself, it is
necessary that the soul must here signify our neighbor: but chiefly them
of household, as the wife, the children, the men and maid servants. These 1.
Tim. 5. 8.
are they to whom we must first of al show mercy. If there be any man that
provides not for his own, and namely for them of his household, he denies
faith, and is worse then an infidel. And also the scripture calls them
souls. Then Genesis 12. 5.
Abraham took Sarah his wife, and Lot his brothers son, and al their
substance that they possessed, and the souls that they had gotten in Harran.
Then the king of Sodom said to Abraham, Give me the persons or souls, and
take the goods to thy and 14. 21.
self. Notwithstanding, if we will take soul, for the person of the merciful,
there shall be none inconvenience, except in place of saying,

He that is merciful, rewards his own soul, we must say, The merciful man
assures or pleases his soul: that is to say, that he is so well affectioned
toward his neighbors, that he forgets himself, and will not take his
delights, but suffers rather then he will forsake his neighbors in their
necessity, so that if he has sworn though it were to his own hinderance,
he will not break his oath. It is easy for a man to occupy himself to do
his neighbors Psa. 15. 4.
pleasure and service, when he may conveniently do it without hinderance. But
true charity, which is here briefly described unto us, according to this
sense, is stirred up with the feeling of another misery, and with the evil
that another suffers, as with his own adversities. Love suffers long: it is
bountiful: love enuieth 1. Cor 13. 5.
not: love does not boast it self: it is not puffed up. It is the same
whereunto the Apostle exhorts us, Let love be without dissimulation. Now
therefore as the elect of God, holy Romans 12. 9. Col. 3. 12.
and beloved, put on tender mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind,
meekness, long suffering, etc. The love which he requires, is not a cold
thing: but they are true affections such as the fathers and mothers bear
toward their Children. Our Lord Jesus Christ has exercised this charity
more then all John. 15. 13.
other, when he has suffered so much for our sins. Greater love then this
has no man, when any man bestows his life for his 1. John. 3. 16.
friends. Hereby have we perceived love, that he laid down his life for
us. Behold these are two expositions upon the first part of this sentence,
which are diverse and not contrary. They agree with the comparison that Solomon
makes of the merciful and the cruel, when he says, But he that troubles
his own flesh, is cruel. Here he signifies unto us that the wicked, rather
then he will be put by of his desires, and hindered of his purpose, will not
abstain to invent against his parents and kinsfolk, and to hurt them, even
to put them to cruel death if it be possible. Hereof might be brought many
examples.

18 The wicked woorketh a disceitful work: but he that sows
righteousness, shall receive a sure reward.
If we would not lose our labor, but have our work to profit as it is the
desire of those that labor, and apply themselves to some work, let us take
heed from following the wicked, to do as they do: They make great shows of
their doings, but the issue and the end, is not according theretoo. Some of
them have great appearance of continual prosperity, and seems impossible that
they should come unto poverty and beggerie: other some seem to be of such
power and authority, that it is impossible they should be humbled: and other
some again, have so fair a show of religion and holiness that it seems
right that GOD is straightly bound unto them, and that they deserve the same,
that it is not possible for them to be damned. But as it is said, al is not
gold that glistereth, even so the goodly shows of the wicked are vain and
false. Solomon does signify it, when he says. The wicked woorketh a
disceitful work. By the which words we must understand that not only
they deceive others, but also themselves, they persuade themselves they cannot
fall from their degree and state, and that al must happen as they would have
it, but whatsoever they take in hand and do, comes to naught against their
expectation. The word of disceite does show it us very well: so does the
second part of the Antithesis or comparison also, when immediately Psalm. 5. 12.
he says,

But he that sows righteousness, etc. He sets the seed of
righteousness against the work of the wicked: and the sure reward against
lying or disceitfulnesse. Wherein we may understand that the sowing of
righteousness is by assurance we have in the goodness of GOD, and by the
fear and reverence that we have of his word, and the great desire we have
for to obey him, and give ourselves to live according to his commandementes:
whereby he would that we should liberally and with a good will help the
necessity of our neighbors. The scripture exhorts us thus to sow, Break
up your fallowe Iere. 4. 4.
ground and sow not among the thorns: be circumcised to the Lord, and take
away the foreskinnes of your hearts, etc. Sow Oseas. 10. 12
to yourselues in righteousness: reap after the measure of mercy: break up
your fallowe ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, til he come and rain
righteousness upon you. He which sows 2. Cor. 9. 6.
sparingly, shall reap also sparingly, and he that sows liberally, shall
reap also liberally. Be not deceived: GOD is Gal. 6. 7. 8.
not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap. For he that
sows to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption: but he that sows
to the spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

Thus by these scriptures we see what it is to sow, and that the reward is
not disceitful, but true. For they which sow do not loose their pains, they
receive the fruit which is said, a sure reward, because it does not fail
nor never shall, but the righteous shall possess it for ever. It is the truth
that Solomon sets against disceite: but although that the wicked which do
abuse and deceive others, are well worthy to be again deceived, and not to
enjoy that which they think and look for, and that they deserve to be
destroyed: yet notwithstanding if contrary to them, we give ourselves to sow
righteousness, let us not therefore challenge any merit: but let us
altogether wait upon the grace and mercy of GOD, not deceiving ourselves by
and about his word, reward, and wages, as if God were bound unto us for to
reco^pe^ce us for our seed of righteousness. For albeit there is a covenant and
band between man and man, to give reward unto them Leui. 19. 13. Deu. 24. 14.
Col. 4, 1. Iam. 5. 4.
which labor for us: (The workmans hire shall not abide with thee until the
morning. Ye masters, do unto your servants, that which is just, and equal,
knowing that ye also have a master in heaven. Behold the hyre of the
laborers, which have reaped your fields (which is of you kept back by fraud)
cries, and the cries of them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of
the Lord of hosts) yet what righteousness soever we sow, we cannot make GOD
bound to give us any reward, no more then the tool or instrument can for the
goodness and finenesse of metal, make the workman bound to it. If we do any
good work, it comes of the grace of God which guides us, and stirs us
up: we are no more but his instruments. Not that we are able of ourselves, to
think any thing, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God. For it is 2.
Cor. 3. 5. Phi. 2. 13.
God that woorketh in you, both the will and the deed, even of his good
pleasure. Moreover we are slaves and bond men: therefore our God who has
redeemed us with the precious blood of his Son, cannot stand bound to us:
what righteousness soever we work, we are unprofitable servants: we have done
that which was Luke. 17. 10
our duty to do. Therefore when the scripture does offer and set before us a
reward or hyre, let us make no account of merit, but let us magnify the
grace and bountifulness of God, whereby we obtain eternal life, the which is
called a reward, not because we win the same, but for that that Jesus
Christ has gotten it for us, and that after al our labors the same is given
unto us. It is the gift of GOD, and not of works, lest any man should boast
himself. Ephe. 2. 8. 9.


19 As righteousness leads to life so he that follows evil, seeks his
own death.
What work soever we take in hand in this world, our intent and desire is to
profit thereby, and by the means whereof we may live and be at our ease: and
thus we labor to obtain a good reward of our work, which we would not miss
and loose. And the which for to attain, Solomon has showed us how we must
forsake the work of the wicked, and follow righteousness by doing good unto our
neighbors. Now when he says, As righteousness leads to life, etc. he
shows what this sure reward is, that is to say, life. And forasmuch as the
wicked do live in this world, even with greater carnal joy, then the righteous,
the which do seem often in the sight of the eyes, to be rather dead then
living, for the troubles and pouerties, miseries, and persecutions that they
suffer: (whereupon also through the weakness of their flesh they do
complain and say, Have mercy upon me, O Lord: for I am in Psa. 31. 9. 10
Psalm. 88. 1. 2. 3.
trouble: mine eye, my soul, and my belly are consumed with grief. For my
life is wasted with heaviness, and my years with mourning. O Lord God of my
salvation, I cry day and night before thee. Let my prayer enter into thy
presence: incline thine ear unto my cry. For my soul is filled with evils,
and my life draws near unto the grave) it follows that the life which is
here spoken of, is not the temporal life (although it comes of the gift and
grace of God, how miserable soever it be, as the faithful do understand: ^.
22
for they confess God to be their Creator) but it is the everlasting life
whereof the wicked are deprived for ever, as Solomon does affirm saying, So he
that follows evil, seeks his own death. Forasmuch as the temporal death is
common to al men: Eccle. 9. 2.
and al things happen alike to al men: and also that temporal death is an
entrance unto life: it follows well, that the death which they seek which
follow evil, is not the temporal death, though it be unto the wicked a part of
their evil, as an entrance unto eternal death, whereof here is mention. Wherein
Solomon well shows, that there is deceit in the work of the wicked: For
though Solomon Psalm. 10. 6.
did not here speak but of temporal death, yet were it an argument strong
enough for to show that the wicked works a deceitful work. For albeit the
wicked, according as he sees happen to others, knows he shall die, yet he
labors to make himself believe that he shall never die. He says in his
heart, I shall never be moved, nor be in danger. And in whatsoever he does,
he labors to live always, if he could: and when his works do not proceed
to his purpose, it follows well, therein is deceit, and that he labors in
vain. His intent is, to do his works for to live, and he by them runs
unto death, and seeks for that which he would not gladly find.

20 They that are of a froward heart, are abomination unto the Lord: but they
that are upright in their way, are his delight.
Solomon here gives a reason of the former sentence, showing wherefore they
which follow evil, do seek death, and the righteous life. They which follow
evil, are led with the frowardness of their hearts, the which delight in no
goodness, but invent all evil, though none occasion be given them. Now forasmuch
as in God lies al goodness, from whence life comes to us: and he is not a
Psalm. 5. 4.
God which loves wickedness: it follows well, seeing that the wicked are in
abomination to the Lord, who is the author of life, that they must needs
go to death: since they are separated from life, they must needs remain in
death: the which they do well deserve: for it comes of their corruption and
purposedmalice, that peruerttheir hearts. Their feet run to evil, and they
make have to shed innocent 2. Cor Phi. 2. 7.
blood: their thoughts are wicked thoughts: desolation and destruction is in
their paths. And herewith also it is of maliciousnes, and so much as lies in
them, they spoil al: whereupon they well deserve to find nothing wherein they
may have succor, and so must needs perish. As touching the righteous, seeing
that of themselves they are no better then the most wicked, so far is it of,
that we may find any cause in them for the which they should be worthy of
life, that they deserve death as well as the other: yet do they live, and it is
not without reason: The reason is not found in them, nor in any other creature,
but in God only, and in his grace and favor, because it pleases him to
accept them, and delight in them. Solomon does show it very plainly, when he
alleges nothing for their excellency and dignity, that they attain life:
But they that are upright in their way, are his delight. Whereto Saint Paul
agrees, alleging how God says to Moses, I will have mercy on him, to whom
Romans 9. 15 Ephe. 1. 5. Tit. 3. 4. 5.
I will show mercy. And in an other place alleging, Who has predestinate us,
to be adopted through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good
pleasure of his will. But when the bountifulnes and love of God our Savior
toward men appeared, not by the works of righteousness which he had don, but
according to his mercy, he saved us, etc. The faithful ought to have their joy
set in this good will and pleasure which is so healthful. For thou Lord wilt
bless the righteous, and with favor wilt compass him, as Psalm. 5. 12.
with a shield. But let us note, that it is not without cause that we have
said, that the reason for the which the righteous do go into life, is not in
them, as has been already touched, concerning the malice of their nature,
which they have common with the wicked. And herewith, albeit that the Scripture
gives them this honor to call them perfect or upright in their way, as indeed
they are, seeing that God accepts them such, because that in their affairs,
they proceed uprightly in simplicity and innocence, without dissimulation
and hypocrisy, without envy and set malice, and without deceit and craft: yet
are they not so perfect in their manners and kind of doings, but that they
feel many imperfections, and much to be amended in them, if God would
straightly examine them. Surely, there is no man just in the earth, that does
good and sins not. Therefore what vprightnes soever is in us, let us pray,
Eccle. 7. 22 Psalm. 143. 2
Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall none that
lives be justified.

21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished: but the
seed of the righteous shall escape.
Because that Solomon has threatened the wicked which seek nothing but to do
evil, with death: and it seems well unto the worldly, that if they be
accompanied and joined with a great multitude of people which have power and
authority, that no hurt can happen unto them: for this cause, for to keep us
from such vain and deceitful confidence, Solomon does show us, that what
bands and covenants soever there are between the wicked, yet shall they not be
safe enough, nor mighty, for to exempt themselves from death, when he says,
Though hand join in hand, etc. Albeit that the wicked do give their hands
one to an other, and do conspire together, yet can they never so well, nor
strongly arm and fortify themselves, that they can exempt themselves from
hurt, and to work that they should not go unto destruction, out of the
which they shall never arise. Before the universal flood, the world and
multitude of the wicked was surely joined, and except the house and family of
Noe, they al agreed together to work wickedness, without remorse of conscience,
even with an unbridled lust: but their agreement saved them not from perishing
by the flood of waters: We allege Sodom and Gomorrhe, with the Cities
adjoining: The conspiracy of Corath, Dathan, and Abyram: The destruction Genesis
19. Number. 16. 31. Iosu. 10. Psalm. 2. and. 3. and 33. Esai. 30 and 31.
of Median, The five Kings, Joshua the tenth chap: and likewise diverse others.
We have also witnesses that such bands and leagues are vain and
unprofitable. Woe to the rebellious children says the Lord, that take
counsel, but not at me, and cover with a covering, but not by my Spirit, that
they may lay sin upon sin. Again, Woe unto them that go down into Egypt
for help, and stay upon Horses, and trust in Horses, and trust in Charets,
because they are many, and in Horsemen, because they are very strong.

Contrarily, though the righteous be but small in number, and that the world
does not desire their agreement, but do scorn the same, reject and persecute
them, and that they are esteemed as the dunge and filthiness of the earth, and
also that it seems they can not escape, but must needs go to destruction,
yet are they so well saved and defended, so well helped and succored, that how
violent assaults soever they have, yet can they not be beaten down and
overcome. For the Lord will preserve both them and their posterity after them.
Solomon does so promise it, when he says, But the seed of the righteous
shall escape. He speaks thus first, by following the promise made to Abraham:
Secondly, upon experience which is showed to Noe, Abraham, Lot, Jacob Joseph,
Moses, David, and others. But at the Genesis 12. and 17. Genesis 22. Deuteronomy. 28. Ps.
33. and 34. Genesis 6. 9. Genesis 9. 25 Eze. 18. 10 Esai. 1. 4. Mat. 12. 39.
first sight it might appear, that this promise should not be steadfast. For
Noe was righteous, and yet his seed was not preserved from the curse. Cursed
be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. If we should
make a discourse through all the holy Fathers, we shall find in their seed
many wicked ones, etc. Again, Ezechiel says, If the righteous beget a son,
that is a thief, or a shedder of blood, etc. Again, the Prophet Esaias says,
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity: a seed of the wicked, corrupt
children, etc. And our Lord calls them, an evil and adulterous generation,
etc. To the former objection I answer, As the righteous, insomuche as they are
the children Ioh. 3. 5. Ephe. 2. Ioh. 1. 12.
of Adam, they are the children of wrath, and have no entrance into the
kingdom of God: but truly and indeed to be the children of God, they must
be regenerated, but so many as received him, to them he gave prerogative to be
the sons of God, even to them which believe in his name.

Moreover, so far as the righteous are flesh, and born of flesh, and have
great posterity, yea a great posterity of carnal children, yet are they not
all the seed of the righteous, but of men truly. The holy Scripture calls
none of the seed of the righteous, by the name of the children of God, but
such as are regenerate and renewed Romans 8. 15.
by the holy Ghost, who makes them to cry, Abba, Father. Saint John Baptist
does somewhat show it us, when he Mat. 3. 7.
says, O generation of Vipers, who has taught you to fly from the vengeance
to come? And our Lord says, I know that ye Ioh. 8. 37.
are Abraham's seed, but ye seek to kill me, etc. And Saint Paul does
plainly say it, For all they are not Israel, which are of Israel: Romans 9. 6. 7.
neither are they al children, because they are the seed of Abraham. Albeit
then that the Jews which slew Jesus Christ, and persecuted his Apostles, and
remained hard hearted, did come of the holy Fathers, yet are they not the seed
of the righteous: but bastard children, a cursed seed, and children of the
Devil. Likewise they which Mahomet and the Pope have corrupted, which are
descended of them that received the Gospel by the ministry of the Apostles,
Disciples, and true Evangelists.

Contrarily, they that are come after the flesh from the heathen Idolaters and
wicked, the which they have not followed, but being converted from their
iniquities and filthiness, have received the Word, and thereby were
regenerated, so that being assured of the good pleasure of God toward them,
agreed not, nor framed themselves to the wicked world, but have fashioned
their minds anewe, are not the seed of the wicked, but of the righteous. They
are truly and indeed the children of Abraham. Saint Paul does well show
it, when he says, But to him that works not, but believes in him Romans 4.
5.
that justifies the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteousness: and a
little after he says, After he received the sign of circumcision, and 11.
as the seal of the righteousness of Faith, which he had, when he was
uncircumcised, that he should be the Father of al them that believe, etc:
Therefore it is by Faith. Such seed shall be and 16. Eze. 18. 14
delivered from death and destruction. But if he beget a son, that sees al
his fathers sins, which he has done, and fears, neither does the like,
etc. He shall not dye in the iniquity of his father, but he shall surely
live, etc. Therefore we must fear the Lord and 17.
and keep his commandments, and from what stock or root soever we come, we
shall be the seed of the righteous, and shall obtain according to this promise of
Solomon, the which is more largely declared, by David, in his 112. Psalm.

22 As a jewel of gold in a Swines snout: so is a fair woman which lacks
discretion.
When Saint Paul says, That God has placed every of the members in the
body, as it has pleased him: albeit, that by these words he would show
the unity of the body, and the conjunction of the members together which are
diverse, yet the same hinders not, but that by these very words we may
learn that our bodies have neither form nor beauty, except God has given
it, and that God is the author of the beauty as well of men as of women: for
also there is none but he, that does make and fashion them. Our mother Eve
does well confess the same, saying, God has appointed me an other seed for
Abel, because Caine slew him. Jacob also did confess it, saying, Am I in Gods
stead, which Genesis 1. and 2 and 4. 25. and 30. 2. Job. 10. 8.
has withholden from thee the fruit of the womb? Forasmuch then as beauty
is the gift of GOD, we must take heed to use it well, lest it happen, that
through insolency and dissoluteness, we profane this beauty, and that by
the evil government of it, we do not draw our neighbors to commit
uncleanness and dishonestie with us, whereof proceeds great punishment, and
horrible vengeance of God. If then God has given us Genesis 6. and 34. 2.
beauty, let us take heed to maintain ourselves honestly, and desire not to
be seen; but in all modesty and soberness: and and let us look well to
ourselves: for albeit we hold an holy countenance, and as becomes them, even
such as S. Paul demands of women, that they may instruct the younger women:
and they Tit. 2. 3. 1. Tim. 5. 13.
should not be like unto young women, which being idle learn to go about from
house to house, etc: yet shall it be very hard but the carnal will labor to
abuse the beauty that God has given us. We may see the same in Sara: again
also in Thamar the sister of Absalon. Gene. 12. 4. and. 20. 2. 2. Sam. 13. 1.
But forasmuch as both men and women ought to be careful to walk soberly and
modestly, and not not to be desirous to set forth their beauty to be seen and
regarded, yet because women are the weaker vessels, and because also that they
desire much to be seen, they ought to be diligently admonished to fly
gorgiousnesse and sumptuousness, al behauiours and doings, al words and
looks, that do not serve but to show their beauty, and to draw the
worldlings, covetous and indiscreet to gaze at them, for to be led away with
evil lusts to commit wickedness, and to abuse their company: also the holy
scripture, for to advertise women of their behavior, and what countenance they
ought to hold, does 1. Cor. 11. 5. and. 14. 34. Ephe. 5. 2 1. Tim. 2. 9. and.
5. 4. Tit. 2. 4. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 1.
teach them how they ought to behave themselves in all their kind of life,
whether it be in public, or in private, whether it be in marriage, or in
widowhood. If women do otherwise, they defile the beauty that God has given
them, and do despise this honest and pleasant gift of God: and so they become
unthankful, not esteeming the beauty which God by his grace has bestowed
upon them, as they ought. Solomon does well signify it, when he says, As a
jewel of gold in a swynes snout, etc, The swyne is so much given to wroote
with her nussel or with her snout in the earth, even in the mire and durte,
that the fair ornamantes and precious iewelles do nothing become her: if they
bestow any upon her, it is in vain, for she does defile them without any
discretion: even so the woman which does reject the former holy admonitions,
and does guide herself without wisdom, counsel, reason, and honesty, by
giving herself to be light and gadding, and following the dissoluteness and
intisementes, for to live in pleasures, and lusts and desires of the flesh,
she has in vain received beauty. For being of so wanton behavior and
countenance, she defiles and destroys, so much as she can, the precious
jewel of beauty that God has given her. Here we may see that the whores
which delight in their beauty, are much deceived: they make themselves believe
that they are fair and gorgeous: and have so long wallowed and plundged in the
mire and filth, that there is no stink in the world so infectiue as they are,
so that the favor of them ascends up to heaven, and makes them abominable
before God. We know it by his law, when he forbiddetth to commit who redome,
and also Esaias. 3. 15. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Heb. 13. 4.
by his threateninges that he makes against the adulterers and whores in the
thirteenth to the Hebrews.

23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the hope of the wicked is
indignation.
Solomon does well show us here, that we must not trust to the judgment of
the world, nor to that which we see outwardly, for as it has been already
handeled, the righteous in this world are in so miserable estate after the
outward appearance, that it seems God hates them, and that he seeks to
destroy and kill the^: and therefore if they hope that any good shall happen unto
them, yet is their hope nothing worth: for, it seems, there can happen
nothing unto them but evil, seeing that in the judgment of the world they
have God against them. But as has been said, Solomon will not have us to be
of such an opinion, when he says, That the desire of the righteous is only
good. They desire that God would be merciful unto them in all their affairs
and needs, and should assist them, and should never forsake them, but that
after he has delivered them from al misery, he would give unto them of his
mere liberality and grace, everlasting felicity in the kingdom of heaven:
and as they desire and hope, so they obtain. The Lord also will be a refuge
for the poor, a refuge in due time, even in affliction. And they that know
thy name, will trust in thee, Psalm. 9. 9. 10. and. 37. Psalm. 145. 18
for thou Lord, have not failed them that seek thee. Trust thou in the Lord
and do good: dwell in the land, and thou shall be fed assuredly. The Lord
is near unto all that call upon him: yea, that call upon him in truth. We
plainly see that there happens nothing but good unto the righteous according
to their wish and hope. Wherefore casting aside the judgment of the world,
let us give ourselves unto righteousness, desiring the aid and help of god,
for to guide and hold us in the same: and in what sort soever we be shaken, we
shall not fall but upon our feet. Contrarily, the wicked do prosper in such
wise, that it seems that God does favor them: and with open mouth they are
called honest men. And therefore they make themselves believe, and have this
vain hope, that they shall not perish: and in the mean while they care not
what they do: they abound in wickedness, and spare neither God nor their
neighbors: whereupon they provoke the Lord unto wrath against them: as
Solomon does signify, saying, But the hope of the wicked is indignation. The
Psalms before alleged do show it well, and also many examples of the
Scripture. Let us not then envy the state of the wicked, but let us pray that
it would please God to direct us in his way, and that al our desires may rest
in the same. In this manner we shall avoid the indignation and displeasure,
and shall obtain the good that we wish for. We shall avoid indignation by
two kind of ways: for not being made void of our desires and hope, we shall
not dispite ourselves against God, and shall not blaspheme as the wicked do,
and we shall not also provoke his indignation against us.

24 There is that scatters, and is more increased: but he that spares more
then is right, surely comes to poverty.
After the judgment of the world, and feeling of the flesh, the manner to
abound in worldly wealth, is to get and lay up for himself and to keep and
hold it, and not to disperse the fruits which come there of, but to make a
treasure of them, and to spend them warily for his own usage. For we see by
experience that they which do so use the^, become soon rich, or at leastwise
are esteemed such: for we see them to possess much goods. Co^trarily, they
which make great cost, though they greatly abound, do consume them by little
and little: and specially they which dispend riotously and prodigally where
there is no need, but in pomp, in delicacie, pleasure, and oste^tation. We see
this almost daily come to pass: but also on the other side, there be which are
liberal, and distribute their goods plentifully, and yet cease not but still
to abound, and do greatly increase: contrarily, there are which be so
sparing, that they will not use nor show mercy where need requires: and yet
they wast, and come unto poverty. Although the first is of the greatest show
and that it is commonly seen with the eye, yet is it not so certain as the
contrary. For this cause Solomon not staying himself by the sight of the eyes,
doubts not to say, There is that scatters, and is more increased. And
herein he agrees with the saying of the Psalm, A small thing that the
righteous has, is better then great riches of the ungodly. Blessed is the man
that fears the Lord. etc. Riches Psalm. 37. 16. Psalm. 112. 1. and. 3. and.
15. 2 and. 28. 4.
and plenteousnesse shall be in his house: and his righteousness endures for
ever. When the saints did speak in this sort, they were more stayed upon the
promises of God, and feared his threatenings, then that which they saw
outward with their eyes, being assured that the word of the Lord never
fails. Wherefore let us not tarry at that which we see with our eyes, but let
us lean upon this word, the which our Lord does strongly confirm unto us
in diverse Math. 6. and 19. Lvke. 6. and. 12. and. 16. 2. Coa. 9. Gala. 6.
places: and let us note that he says not, that all they which scatter, shall
increase: for the prodigal which dispende without reason, do decrease. Again
also he says not simply, He that spares, for it behooves a father of
household to be sober and temperate, not making excessive and superfluous
expenses, but honest and reasonable, for to maintain his family, and to help
the necessity of the poor: and therefore he adds without equity, or more
then is right, or above measure: as do the usurers and covetous, which have no
pity upon the poor: and even the greatest part of such people are so cruel
and unmerciful, that they suffer their family to endure much hardness:
wherefore they are well worthy to come to poverty. Give, and it shall be given
unto you, etc. And Luke. 6. 38.
therefore though we do not always see the necessity of such people, yet let
us know that they are miserable and poor: for the covetous are always needy.
He that loves silver, shall not be satisfied with silver, and he that loves
riches shall be without the fruit Eccle. 5. 9.
thereof. But that which is the greatest poverty of al, and which surely ought
to fear the niggardes, and covetous, and cruel usurers, is Math. 25. 4. Iam.
5. 3.
the deprivation and loosing of the true and heavenly riches.

25 The liberal person shall have plenty: and he that waters, shall also
have rain.
Solomon does here confirm the first part of the former sentence, and
gives a reason thereof: for the which to understand well, let us first note,
the Hebrew has, The soul of the blessing shall be made fat. The which is
expounded after this sort, The liberal person, is he that of free will and
good mind does bless his neighbors, not with word, but in truth and
deed, and in work, helping and succouring them according to their need.
Blessing is taken in this signification in the holy Scripture, The soul then
of 1. Sam. 25. 27. 2. Cor. 5. 9. Deuteronomy. 32. 15. Job. 36. 16. Psalm. 22. 30* and.
23. 5.
blessing, is the liberal person: unto whom Solomon promises fatness, that
is to say, that he shall live at his ease, and shall have his pleasures, and
shall prosper in abundance of wealth. Fatness is thus taken in diverse places.
And when he adds, And he that waters, etc. He repeateth the same thing
again for a greater expression: for as a piece of land well watered, brings
forth easily his fruit, even so when we do help the necessity of the
poor, so much as in us is, we make them fruiteful, for they fare the better
for it, and are more apt to do their duty. Thus doing we shall not loose
our labor, for the Lord by his grace and goodness, does recompense and
yield us the like: as Solomon does signify it, saying, shall also have
rain. As the rain waters the earth, and makes it to spring and bring
forth fruit: even so the Lord augmenteth the goods and riches of the
merciful and liberal. If thou power out thy soul to the hungry, and refreshe
Esaias. 58. 10. 11.
the troubled soul: then shall thy light spring out of the darkness, and thy
darkness shall be as the noone day. And the Lord shall guide thee
continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones, and
thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters
fail not. And their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall have no
sorrow. Furthermore, let us Iere. 31. 12
note, that seeing the goodness that we do to our neighbors, is compared
unto watering and sprinckling, that we must not spare them no more then water,
when we have so to do and need requires.

16 He that withdraws the corn, the people will curse him: but blessing
shall be on the head of him that sells corn.
For to turn us away from usury, catching, theeuery, and covetousness, Solomon
is not contented to have threatened him which spares more then is right, with
poverty: but to make us the more to abhor such wickedness, he shows us
in what estimation they are with the people which spare against equity, and
how they deserve to be spoken of, when he says, He that withdraws the
corn, the people will curse him: We do gladly bless them which we have in
good reputation, and whom we esteem honest men, and we do not curse them:
whereupon follows: the people do judge them wicked men, which withholde the
corn, since they do curse them, as they deserve. But albeit that in cursing
such people, the people does but that which they deserved, yet is it not to
say that Solomon allows such cursing, nor yet that it is lawful for the
people to curse them that heighten the price of victuals, the which are
signified unto us by the wheat or corn, which is the most ordinary and common
meat, even the most necessariest. The making dear and also the deprivation of
the same is signified unto us by this withdrawing. For these covetous and
wicked ones, usurers, and thieves, yea cruel murderers, do gather on al sides
so much as they can, the victuals, that none may come by them but at their
commandment, and should pass through their hands: and chiefly they lock up
the corn, desiring that it might be dear, too rob the poor people of gold
and silver, and also of possessions, and that they might rake al to themselves,
and that in this sort they might wax rich, to the hurt of their neighbors,
whom they make sorrowful. Such folk are somewhat acquainted with great men,
which tread down the people, who are threatened by the judgment of God. The
Lord will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and princes
thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyarde: Esaias. 3. 14. Amos. 8. 4.
the spoil of the poor is in your houses. etc. And are like unto them of
whom Amos speaks. Hear this, O ye that swallow up the pore, that ye may
make the needy of the land to fail, saying, When will the new month be gone,
that we may sell corn? and the Sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, and
make the Ephah small, and the Shekel great, and falsify the weightes by
deceit? etc. If they deserve the judgment and punishment of God, even
eternal, they are well worthy that God should set them in contempt and shame,
and in temporal curse, the which is the beginning of their hell and eternal
pain. For when cursing is spoken of, Solomon does not mean in words only,
but also the people feeling themselves too sore oppressed with necessity and
scarcity by the raking of them which withdraw the corn, shall rebel, and rise
up against them for to spoil and rob, as experience shows.
Notwithstanding, as has been said, it is not to say that Solomon does
promise any such thing: yea, and the Magistrates ought to punish such rebels,
what poverty soever they suffer by the spoil of them which labor to enriche
themselves by locking up the corn: and since that they are punishable by men,
it follows also that they offend God with cursing. The people then what
wrong, injury, and outrage soever they suffer, must be patient, and not render
evil for evil. Mat. 5. 39.


And although it be not lawful for the poor people to curse them which
withholde the corn, yet such covetous persons ought well to fear such
cursing of the people, and to wit, that it is not without cause that Solomon
does threaten them with this cursing. For albeit the curse of the people is
not just, yet for to punish the covetous, wicked, and usurers, it shall take
effect. The Lord will hear such a cursing for to destroy and overthrow these
wicked men: for as much as God uses the common people as instruments and
organes 1. Cor. 13. 4.
for to curse them: and not that the people in so cursing deserve to be
heard: for they are led with the desire of their Deuteronomy. 15. ^.
own profit, whereunto the faithful ought to have no regard, but ought to
be led with charity, which is patient, and suffers long. Now that the
curse is hard, we may gather it out of that which is said, Beware that there
be not a wicked thought in thine heart, to say, The seventh year, the year of
freedom is at hand: therefore it greeueth thee to look on thy poor brother,
and thou give him naught, and he cry unto the Lord against thee, so that
sin be in thee. For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his
prayer Eccle. 4. 6.
shall be heard of him that made him. And as for to turn us away from usury,
spoiling and extortion, even so also for to lead us to be liberal, and to
exercise mercy, he says unto us, But blessing shall be on the head of him
that sells corn. For by these words he teaches us in what estimation they
are which sell their corn resonably, and what men speak of them, also how
well they are beloved and honored, and every man is ready to do them
pleasure, and service, and to be at their commandment. Solomon signifies
this same by the blessing of the head: for in place that the people would
gladly have the regraters head, where his feet are, and would gladly brain
them, he bears honor and reverence unto the liberal and merciful, and
desires their conservation, where about they occupy themselves so much as they
can. Hereof we have an excellent example in Joseph. But some will say against
it, that it seems that Joseph, after the sentence of Solomon, deserved to be
cursed of the Genesis 41. and 42. and 43.
people: for he shut up the corn, and during the famine, none had any but by
his commandment. I answer, That it was by divine revelation that he gathered
the corn together, not to make it dear, neither to make himself rich with
the sale thereof, but for to help the necessity of the country of Egypt, and
of them which dwelt about it. And so he was not a withdrawer of the corn, but
a seller: not like unto the sellers at this day, which do rather deserve to be
called exactours, flears of men, and murderers, then sellers: for as they
proceed therein they drink the blood, and suck out the mary of the bones of
the poor. It is not of such sellers that Solomon speaks, but of them which
are like unto Joseph. And as the curse of the people is heard of God, and so
the withdrawers of corn are not cursed only of men, but also of God: even so
the blessing of them which bless the sellers, is heard: and so they have not
only the blessing of men, but they have also the same of God. Whereupon it
follows that in this sentence there is not a threatening and promise
presently, but also for to come. Wherefore the cruel covetous ought to be
greatly feared, and the merciful and liberal ought to be comforted. And we
ought to understand that if the seller be blessed, that by a greater reason
he which gives, shall obtain blessing: not that his alms can deserve it, but
because that Christ has so promised: Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
obtain mercy. Mat. 5. 7.


27 He that seeks good things, gets favor: but he that seeks evil, it
shall come to him.
Solomon heretofore has pronounced sentences, whereby he has taught us to
abhor covetousness: and namely he has said it. He still pursues now the same
argument, when he says, He that seeks good things, gets favor, etc.
When Solomon, for to induce us unto liberality and mercy, says simply, he
that seeks good things: and adds not, of his neighbors: he shows us,
that they which have none other desire and affection but to do their work,
and care not to help the needinesse of the poor, do not procure the good,
but also their study is upon evil, to do hurt and to destroy. For as we will
not say of a tree, that it brings forth good fruit, except we have tasted
thereof: even so if a man do not communicate his work unto his neighbors,
and make them partakers of his labor, we cannot say truly, that he seeks
good things: for he that has care but for himself, has no love, without the
which al is nothing worth. Likewise Saint Paul conioineth the procuring of
things good and honest with charity. Likewise 1. Cor. 13. 1. Romans 12. 17. 2.
Cor. 8. 21.
showing the care that he has for his poor neighbors, he says, We provide
for honest things not only before the Lord, but also before men. Now for to
show us how we must seek for good things; Solomon uses a word in his
tongue, which is taken of the spring of the morning, and signifies, to seek
early. Wherein we are taught, that we must not be slack and slouthful, when
necessity requires to do any thing for them which have need of our help
and succor: but that we must be careful and diligent. Our Lord does teach
us the very same, when he commands us to watch Mat. 24. 42. and 25. 1. 14.
continually, and that we should be like unto the faithful and wise servant.
Again, by the similitudes of the virgins and the talents, etc. And if in the
corporal necessity we must be watchful, and careful to do well unto our
needy neighbors, by a more strong reason we must diligently watch and
travail for to edify the consciences of the weak, of the ignorant, and
unbelieving, which are void of spiritual goodness, which is the good that al
Christians should procure, and chiefly the Ministers and the pastors of the
church. Likewise the Magistrates ought to procure the wealth of the people, over
which they are committed of God, whose authority and power they have. But to
procure good things well, we must follow the instructions that are given us. If
every man in his estate would procure good things as they ought, they should
get favor, as Solomon does promise it: that is to say first of al, that he
shall be pleasing Exo. 18. 21 Psalm. 2. 10. and. 82. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 6 Romans 13.
and acceptable, and shall work love to himself: he shall be well welcome, and
men will labor to do them pleasure, service and honor: and which is the
chiefest, and the most to be desired, is that God will bear him favor, love
him, and will delight in him, will assist him and be merciful unto him, and will
keep that no evil shall happen unto him, which shall destroy him: but he will
preserve him, that he make him blessed for ever: The Lord delighteh in them
that fear him, and attend upon his mercy. Bodily exercise profits little:
but Psa. 147. 11.
godliness is profitable unto al things, which has the promise of the life
present, and of that that is to come. It is very expedient for 1. Tim. 4. 8
us that in seeking the good, we should chiefly get the favor of God: for it
happens most commonly, that if we do our duty in the estate wherein we
are called, that men in steed of being favorable, as they ought, do hate and
persecute us. Whereupon we must not be abashed, nor cease for all that to seek
for good things: for the like has happened to our predecessors, and above al
unto our Lord and master Jesus Christ. But although the getting of favor is
here spoken of, and chiefly of god, let us not set God in equal degree with
me^, the which we may bind to ourselves to bear us favor by our well doings.
It is not so with God, for he cannot be bound to us, whatsoever we can do.
And so, when we obtain favor of him without any permutation, and without
receiving any reward of us, because that we receive of him, of his only
grace, gift, and liberality: yet does it not cease unto us to be true
getting. For if we say that there is not better getting, then that which is
gotten by gift, we must not think strange though we call that which god
gives us of his meereliberalitie getting. Besides the Pro. 4. 5. 6. 7. Esaias.
55. 1.
common manner of speaking, we have the Scripture which exhorts us to get
without any permutation. Moreover, besides this, let us note that as they which
procure good things, have promise of favor: So also they whose wealth we
seek, are admonished of their duties, every one in his degree. And therefore
let us not follow the opinion of fantastical fellows, which are not thankful
for a good turn received of their neighbors. But as for to induce us unto
liberality, Solomon does set before us this promise: also for to turn us away
from doing hurt unto our neighbors, he sets a threatening, saying: But he
that seeks evil, it shall come unto him. Forasmuch as Solomon has set
seeking of evil, against the seeking of good: he does signify unto us, that
he speaks of the hurt that we procure unto our neighbors, and calamities,
and miseries, whereto we endeavor to bring them, and of the destruction and
overthrow that we go about to seek for them, for to make our particular
profit, and to come unto the end of our purposes and intents. And when against
getting of favor, he threateneth evil to come, he signifies that the
wicked which seek for nothing but the hurt of their neighbors, shall be
deprived of al favor, and chiefly toward God, who will beat them down, from
the which they shall never escape. Behold he trauelleth with mischief: he
Psalm. 7. 15. 16.
has conceived sorrow, and brought forth ungodliness. He has graven and
dug up a pit: and is fallen himself into the destruction that he has made
for other. Of this number were Caine, Saul, Absolon, Judas, and others, who
after the sight of the eyes have got ten favor, the which ought not to be
accounted of, seeing that it did not preserve them from wickedly perishing.

28 He that trusts in his riches, shall fall but the righteous shall florishe
as a leaf.
Solomon pronounces here a sentence which is very hard to be believed, and
as it seems, the experience is in the contrary: and therefore the worldlinges
and carnal men, which are covetous, do despise it, and mock thereat. This same
is but too too common, and has no need of probation: notwithstanding there
Luke. 16.
shall be no inconvenience to bring forth one example, it is rehearsed that after
Jesus Christ had admonished his disciples by the act of the steward, to be
liberal, and not to set their hearts upon riches, it is said that the Pharisees
which were covetous did mock at him. Now of our own nature we are no better
then the Pharisees: it seems unto us that riches are very profitable, and
that they are of great power and excellency, and that they which have them
with abundance, are well stayed and vpholden: and in this sort we make riches
our God, and cast behind us, and despise the true God, which gives abundantly
al things for to use. The covetous which would be esteemed saints and devout
persons, do make themselves believe that to set our hearts on the goods of
this world, does not let us to serve God: and even the greatest thieves and
usurers do judge that they have done a great act, and very much for God, when
of their ravening they have laid aside some part, for to bestow in the
service of God, fained by men, or else that they have made godly Legacies by
testament, not departing with any thing whiles they live, for fear they should
want themselves. But our Lord does pronounce unto us, No man can serve two
masters. etc. He shows it also by the seed cast amongst thorns: for if the
word which does teach us, and guide us to serve god, be choked, it is
impossible for us to serve God: but we do despise and reject him, to become
rich, and to increase in temporal goods: yea and there are some that are so
unshamefast, and so overcome with unbridled lusts, that they determine wholly
to forsake god for a time, that they may become rich and are not ashamed to
teach others to do the like. In such manner of folks is fulfilled that which
is said, That they which would be 1. Tim. 6. 9.
rich. fall into temptation. They which use them after such a sort, deserve well
destruction, and damnation, for they destory themselves wittingly: they are
like unto them which have no strength, nor power to stand upright of
themselves, and yet they despise and reiecte him which does offer them a stay,
and will uphold them. For albeit we are, move, and have our being in God: as
he only is our Creator, even so he only does guide us, mainteineth and
governs us, and he only is our stay and vpholder: and the covetous rejecting
him, it follows necessarily that they Acts. 17. 2^
must fall. If we have true knowledge of this same, and that we have not the
eyes of our understanding and senses blinded with the brightness of the glory
and pomp of the prosperity and triumph of the worldly riches, it shall not
be very easy to believe that he which trusts in his riches, shall fall, as
Solomon does here pronounce. And before him David, As for the ungodly, Psalm.
37. 20.
they shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall consume as the fat of
lambs: yea, even as the smoke shall they consume away. Psalm. 49. 11.
Again, And they think that their houses shall continue for ever. And albeit
that we always see not with the eye the fall of the covetous and of them which
have set their hearts upon riches, yet nevertheless let us not desire to be
like them, but let us know for certain that they shall fall so down, that they
shall never more arise from the same. They well deserve such a fall: for too
make themselves rich, and for to maintain them in their wealth, they Mat. 19.
23.
use wicked means and are led with ungodly affections, and pass not though
they do wrong unto their neighbors, but the greatest part of such people
do study and delight to do iuiurie and wrong unto their neighbors. Solomon
does signify it, when against him which trusts in his riches, he sets
the righteous: to whom he makes a very pleasant promise, when he says, But
the righteous shall florishe as a leaf: but the same is no less hard to be
believed then the former threatening: for the wicked so much as they can, do
bring the righteous, into so poor estate and case, that it seems they shall
never rise up more: and therefore they mock at the hope of the righteous. But
not staying ourselves upon the opinion of the world, nor in the sense of the
flesh, let us trust unto the promise of Solomon, before whom the Psalmist
has said, that the righteous Psalm. 62. 11.
shall florishe like a palm tree. Let us then be certain that what misery
soever we suffer, the Lord will restore us unto a prosperous and pleasant
state: as the same is signified unto us, by springing, bringing forth, and
flourishing, here and in other places. As hereafter, Jacob shall take root:
Israel shall florishe and grow, and Esaias. 27. 6. and. 35. 1. Ose. 14. 6. and 6.
the world shall be filled with fruit. The Desert and the wilderness shall
rejoice: and the wast ground shall be glad and flourish as a rose. I will be as the
dew unto Israel he shall grow as the Lilly, and fasten his roots as the
trees of Lybanon: his branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the Olive
tree, and his smell as Lybanon. Solomon also in this place does well show it,
when against falling which signifies misery and destruction, he sets
flourishing. And in them both, he uses the future tence or time to come, whereby
he does somewhat signify that there shall be no end of the falling of the
wicked, nor yet in the prosperity of the righteous. Jeremy does likewise
signify it, when he says, Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes
flesh his arm, and withdraws Iere. 17. 5.
his heart from the Lord. For he shall be like the heathe in the wilderness, and
shall not see when any good comes, but shall inhabit 6
the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land, and not inhabited.
Blessed be the man that trusts in the Lord, and whose hope 7
the Lord is. For he shall be as a tree that is planted by the water, which
spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not feel when 8
the heat comes, but her leaf shall be green, and shall not care for the
year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. And in the first
Psalm, when he compares the state of the wicked with him that delights in
the law of the Lord.

29 He that troubles his own house, shall inherit the wind: and the fool
shall be servant unto the wise in heart.
Albeit that (as we have seen) it is a dangerous thing to trust in riches,
and a profitable thing for us to be given unto righteousness: yet to possess
and to use riches for to succor our household at need, is not against
righteousness: they rather serve to bring forth fruits of righteousness and
equity. Many of the old fathers did abound in wealth, and yet ceased not to
be righteous: As Abraham, Job, and the good kings of Judah, for they did not
set their hearts upon them, but used them as though they enjoyed none. Abraham
has well showed it in dwelling in the promised land as a stranger, and in
patie^tly bearing many remouings and pilgrimages which it behooved him to make.
Job also has showed it by the great patience that he had in the loss of his
children, and of his goods, and of his health. The holy fathers which have thus
used them, had always enough, and were never void of riches, but were
contented, and by wisdom did govern householders quietly, and did keep their
family in subjection and obedience, and had authority and pre-eminence over
their children and household servants. If we follow them (as is very necessary
for all heads and fathers of household) our business shall be quietly governed, we
shall possess so much goods as shall be necessary, we shall have credit and
authority with our family, the which shall be at our commandment for to give
us al obedience, and please us in all things. But contrarily, if we burn with
covetousness, and thereby we spare more then is right and reason, not helping
the needs of our family, and so do trouble it, making the same sorrowful, and
giving it occasion of sorrow, and to spite us, and to work our destruction,
and labor to take, steal, and to pull from us what they can, we must look for
a great poverty, through which we shall be so astonished, that we shall loose our
sense, and so we must be feign to become subject unto them which can tell how to
govern themselves wisely: so beastly and fearful shall we be by our misery.
Solomon does signify the same saying, He that troubles his own house, etc.
In the first part of this sentence he compares the covetous fool unto him
which breaks and pearseth through the walls of an house, so that the wind
enters in on al sides. Now as the wind vanishes and cannot be holde^ back:
even so they which spend their riches to the hinderance of their family, shall
not enjoy them at their desire, but shall be deprived of them miserably, and shall
receive no profit of the^. The wind is taken after this signification in
Oseas, For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlewind.
Again, Ephraim is Oseas. 8. 7. and. 12. 1
fed with the wind, and follows after the East wind. Also such as are prodigal
and riotous spenders of goods, shall be heirs of wind. For as in consuming their
goods without discretion and good advise, they do loose them, if they did cast
chafe in the wind, the which does carry and scatter it so far abroad,
that it cannot be recovered: but they are worthy to beheires of wind, that is
to say to have nothing: for also they trouble their own house bringing their
family into necessity of begging their bread: and they themselves likewise
constrained to beg: and for to obtain that which they desire either in all, or
in part, they must humble themselves before good houskeepers which have the
discretion and wisdom to govern and to spend their goods with reason. We may
see this same by experience in following that which Solomon in the second part
of this sentence says, The fool shall be servant to the wise in heart. The
prodigal child has Luke. 15. 14
proved his part. etc. Furthermore, they inherit the wind which are so much
given unto quarrelling and law, that they care not against whom they begin
suit: and for to get peace and love, they will quit, neither forgive any thing
how little soever it be that they think does belong unto them, but rather
then they would want of their purpose to obtain the victory, they become
enemies unto al men. Such kind of people are worthy to have nothing but wind:
for they trouble their own houses, experience does also show it, that not
only their houses, but also the kingdoms through braules and quarrels are
ouerthwrone, and they which possess them are driven out, and are feign to
become subject unto them which before were less then they. I have seen the
servants on horseback, and the Princes trot on foot as servants. And if the
master of an household ought to be wise, by a more strong reason the^ ought
kings and princes to be wise, which have the towns, provinces, and kingdoms
in government, to the end that they should not trouble their subjects, nor
guide them as becomes: and that it does happen that their lordships and
kingdoms must be transported unto others: and that in this manner being
spoiled, they inherit wind: and in steed of ruling, are brought under the
power of another, by the sufferance of the Lord, unto whom it belongs to
remove kingdoms, and to give them unto whom soever it pleases him. As the
Prophets do teach us, declaring that such mutatio^s do often happen Dan. 2. 21.
and. 4. 14. 29.
for the contempt of the Word, as has bin seen amongst those miserable poor
men which have received that deuilish interim.

30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life: and he that wins souls,
is wise.
The righteous is not like unto the covetous niggarde, neither unto the
witless prodigal, neither the quarrelling rufler, who do profit no body, but
do trouble al men, and do set all in disorder so that they destroy
themselves, and do not bring profit unto their neighbors, but hurt. But as
the righteous has not his trust in men, but does depend upon the goodness
of GOD which takes care of his, and as he provides what so ever is
necessary, giving him al things abundantly for to use, even so does he
dispose them in such wise to the profit of his neighbors, that he brings
forth fruit the which does quicken his neighbors. Solomon does signify
this same: first of all, when he calls the works of the righteous, fruit: as
also the holy Scripture does often in other places. For as the tree does not
bring Psalm. 1. 3. Iere. 17. 8. Mat. 7 and 12.
forth his fruit for it self, but for another: even so the true righteous,
does not regard his own particular profit, but theirs which have to do with
him. And as the fruit of the tree does nourishe and give strength, even so
the righteous labors by his works to refreshe and quicken. Solomon does well
express it, when he is Genesis 2. 9.
not contented to say, is as a tree, but he adds, of life, wherein he
alludeth unto the tree of life which was planted in the midst of the garden of
pleasure. For as if Adam in steed of eating of the tree of knowledge, had
eaten of the tree of life, he had not dyed, but had been quickened for ever,
and had revived his posterity, the which he has made subject unto death:
even so the righteous does profit his neighbors for the benefit of life, not
only temporal, but also eternal. For he has not care of the body only, but
also, and that chiefly of the souls. He does his works for to help the
necessities of his neighbors: and therewith and by the same, he tends to
edify them to salvation, giving them a good example, that they may be warned
to praise God, and to give him praise, for that that he leaves them not
unprovided of good succor and help, and are taught that after their power
they ought to do unto their neighbors as they would their neighbors should
do unto them. Being thus builded, they shall live eternally, and also they who
so do build them. Behold how the fruit of the righteous is as the tree of
life.

Secondly, Solomon does signify unto us, that the righteous does bring
forth fruit which does give life unto his neighbors, when he says, And he
that wins souls, is wise. Wherein for to signify, that the righteous by
his good deeds and well doing, does draw unto him and win men's souls, and
does not suffer them to perish: but does save them according unto the
wisdom that God has given him. Solomon compares the just man unto a fisher.
For as the fisher, to take fish, is feign to use deceit and craft, suttletie
and discretion, otherwise, he takes no fish, but does drive them away, and
so does spend his time in vain, and loses his labor: even so the righteous
has need of wisdom, the which may guide him so wisely in his affairs, that
he may win his neighbors. And also because our Lord says unto his
Apostles, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. Fear not, henceforth
Mat. 4. 19. Luke 5. 10.
thou shall take men: he does endue them with great wisdom, filling them
with his holy Spirit, for to guide and govern them in the taking of men. And
in this we must learn, that Ministers of the Church chiefly stand in need of
wisdom, for to learn well to take souls by good example and sound doctrine.
These are the nets that ought to be cast over the sea of this world, etc.
Besides this, let us note that Solomon comparing the righteous and wise man
unto a fisher, secretly admonishes us to be watchful and careful. We see
that they which occupy the trade of fishing, are upon the water at al hours,
except the wind be contrary and do let them: even so also must we not let
pass any occasion of time, for to do well and say well, for to draw our
neighbors unto our nets and snares. And the same must be done with a great
affection and marvelous desire: for if the fishermen for a temporal gain, and
that soon vanishes away, are so careful, that they care not for their own
life, the which they often put in danger: by a more strong reason, no man
ought to spare his own person, when it is required to take souls, and to make
a perpetual gain. For if they also proceed therein faithfully, they shall never
loose their labor, nor forgo their reward. It is not like unto fishing: for if
the fishers do not take ought, they loose their gain, and so have labored in
vain: but they that fish after Eze. 31. 9 and 33. 9.
souls, are not deprived of gain, though they take nothing, provided that they
do their duty faithfully. When you enter into an house, salute the same: and
if the house be worthy, let your peace Mat. 10. 12.
come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. And
herein we are admonished not to be unthankful toward the Lord, which cease
not to reward us well; though we bring nothing to him: and not to forget the
honor that he do us when he does attribute unto us the taking of souls, the
which is his work, and not man's: this same is after a sort signified, when our
Lord says, Simon, launch forth into the deep, and let down your nets to
make Luke 5. 4. 1. Cor. 3. 6. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Ephe. 2. 10.
a draught: etc. And S. Paul does plainly show it: Who is Paul then? and who is
Apollo, but the Ministers by whom ye believed, and as the Lord gave to every
man? Not that we be sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing, as of
ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God. We are his workmanship created in
Christ Jesus unto good, which God has ordained that we should walk in them.
For it is God Phi. 2. 13.
which works in you, both the will and the deed, even of his good pleasure.
Finally, let us note, that though we be neither just nor wise, but so much as
we are governed by the word, it follows, that there is neither fruit of
life, nor taking of souls in Popery: for they are without the word: instead
of fruit, they have deadly poison, the inventions and doctrines of men,
superstitions and idolatries: and insteede to be taken and caught, they are
more drowned in the mire of this world. We may also add, that since that
Solomon speaks by similitude and comparison, we may apply this sentence unto
an other meaning, to wit, that the righteous does not inherit wind, as does
he that troubles his house, but of his righteousness he gathers excellent
fruit: and the wise is not like the fool, which has no wisdom to draw
others unto himself, and to make them to agree unto him: but must himself
consent, and be as it were made captive and subject unto the wise, which has
knowledge so to govern himself, that he draws his neighbors unto him by
softness and gentleness, and other honest means.

31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: how much more the
wicked and the sinner?
We all naturally desire to have recompense of our labor and travel, and are
glad when we are promised we shall be paid for that which is owing us, and that
none will withholde our labor: and again, more joyful when we have our desires
granted, and promise performed indeed. Nevertheless when Solomon speaks
here of recompense, and does show it present, saying, Behold, if we understand
well this meaning, he gives none occasion unto our flesh for to rejoice: for he
does not promise such reward as it desires, as temporal riches, worldly
honors, favor of men, delights and pleasures, peace and rest: but he does
threaten us with the contrary, as we may see, First of al, when he shows the
ready reco^pe^se of the righteous, saying, Behold, or lo, here it is. Secondly,
when he says in the earth. For the consideration and estate of the righteous
in this life and world, is that they pay the^ evil for good, they are affl^cted
and persecuted, they are subject unto poverty and misery, unto sickness,
cold and heat, hunger and thirst, to sorrows and griefs: and most commonly
they suffer such things so long as they live in this world: as the holy
ancient fathers have tried, the Prophets, our Lord Jesus Christ and his
Apostles also. Whereupon do proceed these complaints, False witnesses did
rise up: they laid to my charge things that I knew Psalm. 35. 11 and 38, 20.
not. They rewarded me evil for good: to the great discomforte of my soul.
They also that reward evil for good, are against me: because I follow the
thing that is good. And also other complaints, as may be seen in the 3. 6.
10. and 13. Psalms, etc. Thirdly, when he denounces reward unto the
righteous, as unto the wicked and sinners, and does not put difference, but
only that by interrogation he shows that there is a greater reason that the
wicked and sinners should have more greater recompense. For albeit, that al
afflictions do proceed from sin, as from their first cause (for if Adam had
not sinned, we should have been subject unto no afflictions) for the truth is,
there is no righteous man but sins, and consequently, which does not
deserve the foresaid reward: but because the wicked do sin more, they
deserve greater recompense. When Solomon declares unto the righteous this
recompense or payment, he does admonish them that they should arm
themselves with patience: and what adversities soever does happen unto them,
yet do they not murmr, nor despite God which does afflict and chasten
them. For albeit that the Devil and the wicked do persecute them, yet do the
righteous suffer nothing but so far as God slacketh the bridle to Satan and
to the wicked, and makes them executioners of his righteous judgment, the
which he does not exercise with rigor against the just, as they do well
deserve, what righteousness soever they have. Behold Job which has witness to
be a perfect and upright, and fearing God, yet God did afflict him by Satan,
and by robbers his ministers and instruments: the which Job confesses very
well, saying, The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken: the name of the
Lord be blessed. Shall man be more righteous Job. 1. 21. and 4. 17. and 9. 2. 3.
then God? For how should man compared unto God, be justified? If he would
dispute with him, he could not answer him one thing of a thousand. Now that
it is not the rigor that God exercises his judgment against the righteous,
Solomon signifies it after a sort, when he does declare that they shall be
recompensed in earth. The righteous of themselves are never a whit better then
the wicked and sinners, the which do not only deserve a temporal reward, but
eternal: yet God is contented to chastise them in the earth, so long as they
live here, and will not destroy them with the wicked, which shall perish
eternally: and in this manner they shall be more recompensed then the righteous,
as they do well deserve, when with all their might and full course they follow
wickedness, and without remorse of conscience they give themselves unto
unshamefastness, for to commit al uncleanness even with greedines. But the
righteous are displeased at their transgressions and faults, the which as they
are not exempted in this world, even so the Lord does chasten them only in
earth: and therefore that they deserve well correction, Solomon does call
recompense it, or payment. And for to show that the chastisement is sweet,
and that it does not tend to destruction and damnation, he says, on earth.
Wherein we must observe: first of al, that the righteous ought to walk in fear
and humility, when they understand that they are not so innocent but that they
do well deserve that God should correct them for their 1. Pet. 4. 17 12.
faults, and that he begins to execute his judgments with them. The which
he does for their trial: and therefore Saint Peter does admonish us, Dearly
beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, which is amongst
you, to prove you, as though some strange thing were come unto you. Secondly,
the righteous have here just occasion for to rejoice and to be comforted, when
they understand that God does not punish them, for their faults after this
life, but here in earth he does chastise them gentlely, in comparison of that
which they have deserved: and that to the end that they should not perish
with the wicked world. Let us then remember the admonition: My Son, despise
not the chastening 1. Cor. 11. 32 Hebr. 12. 5
of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord
loves, he chasteneth. Albeit then, that it is for our sins that God does
recompense us, sending us afflictions, nevertheless he does not proceed
through hatred, but by love and good affection that he bears us, as a good
father his children. Thirdly, when the righteous are set against the wicked, we
know that notwithstanding that the righteous of themselves are no more worth
then the wicked, yet their faults are not imputed unto them, and for the same
they shall not perish: as also it is signified after a sort, when they are not
so much recompensed as are the wicked. This recompense of the righteous is the
rod of man, whereof God speaks unto David. But there is here a very fearful
threatening for them 2. Sam. 7. 14.
which hate the good, and have bent al their desire unto evil, by the which
they suffer themselves to be so carried away, that they are given unto dissolute
and slanderous life, without any shame or honesty. These are they which
Solomon calls wicked and sinners. The righteous do sin indeed, and do
commit very grievous faltes, but they abhor them, they are grieved for them,
and do take heed 1. Pet. 4. 15.
to be slanderous: as Saint Peter does admonish. Let none of you suffer as a
murderer or as an evil doer, etc. This is not without cause that this
threatening ought to be fearful to the wicked. For if they have the
afflictions of the righteous in abomination, judging the^ to be persecuted of
God, and do fear the like adversities: by a more strong reason they ought to
be greatly afraid of the reward which Shlomo^ sets forth unto the^. For it
shall be greater then that which they see happen unto the righteous, the which
they would not receive, so much do they think it hard and sharp. The Lord
strikes his first of al, and seems to spare the wicked: wherevpo^ after the
feeling of the flesh, the state of the righteous seems to be miserable in
comparison of the same of the wicked. Solomon does after a sort signify this
same, when he sets the reco^pe^ce of the just present, saying, Behold, and
makes mention of it before the same of the wicked. And S. Peter declares
plainly, saying, It is time that judgment begin at the household of God. But
the long suffera^ce does nothing profit the obstinate 1. Pet. 4. 17.
wicked: as Solomon does here show, saying. How much more etc. Esaias says, But
when the Lord has accomplished al stis work Esaias. 10. 12.
upon mount Syon and Jerusalem, I will visit the fruit of the proud heart of
the king of Asshur, etc. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
the^ which obey not the gospel of God? Albeit the^ that the wicked seem to be
without fear in afflicting the faithful: yet 1. Pet. 4. 17
shall they not fail of their payment. For it is a righteous thing with God, to
recompense tribulation to the^ that trouble you, etc. Contrarily, in our
afflictions, let us take courage, saying with Paul. Therefore 2. The. 1. 6. 2.
Cor. 4. 16.
we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is
renewed daily.

The twelfth Chapter.
1 He that loves instruction, loves knowledge: but he that hates correction,
is a fool.
WE are al of this nature, that we boast ourselves to have great desire to be
instructed, and we persuade ourselves that we love knowledge: and also we
commonly say, that knowledge is a goodly thing: as it is indeed: and not only
goodly, but of great profit and pleasure. For thereby we rightly govern
ourselves and our affairs in this life: and al our enterprises do prosper well
when they are governed by knowledge: and therein we receive profit, and also
great delectation: for by knowledge we are so assured, that we proceed in
doing our duty without doubting or fear: knowing and confessing that
whatsoever we do (be it in word or deed) is well done, and it is that which we
should do. Now when we do thus brag, we do give signification that we
abhor ignorance: as indeed it ought to be detested, seeing not only that it
is troublesome, but also unprofitable and hurtful. From the time that Adam
sinned, darkness entered into the world, and men loved darkness more then
light: and so have they walked in ignorance, whereby they were given to al
wickedness, and in this manner have deprived themselves of life, and are fallen
into death. But it is not enough to brag of these foresaid things: the
chief point is, that indeed we should abhor ignorance, and love knowledge,
not that which Pro. 2. 1.
has but a vain show, and is only praised of men: but that which is allowed
before God, the which is given unto us of him, when he ^eacheth us by his
word, and are diligent to receive it. And to the end that we should not deceive
ourselves, persuading ourselves that we love knowledge, whereas we do abhor
it, Solomon does give us a certain mark, for to judge rightly whether we love
knowledge or no: This is instruction: when it pleases and is acceptable unto
our mind. For he says, He that loves instruction, loves knowledge. Albeit
the^ that we do use to sermons, and read the scriptures, and that we can talk
finely of them, yet if we be so high that it seems unto us we can learn no
more, and will not suffer ourselves to be admonished, that we should be taught,
corrected, and reproved where it is needful, we do not love knowledge. But
if confessing our ignorance, our faults and imperfections, we take well in
worth that we be taught, admonished, and reproved, we love instruction, and
consequently knowledge. Now that instruction imports teaching, exhortation,
showing, correction, and reprehension, first of all we may understand it by
the deriuation of the word which Solomon uses here in this place. Secondly,
when in the first Chapter and eight verse, instruction and doctrine are joined
together, and in the two and twentieth verse, by the complaint of wisdom, and
23. verse, by his admonition: and the 4. Chap. and 1. verse, Children, hear
the instruction of a Father. Thirdly, when here against to love instruction, he
sets to hate correction, and against the lover of knowledge, he sets the
fool, saying, But he that hates correction, is a fool: he does show us
that the foolish are the contemners and scorners of God, and of his word, the
obstinat and stifnecked which harden themselves in their wickedness, for all the
exhortation that is made them. It is said of them, Such as be foolish, shall
not stand in thy sight: for thou hate Psalm. 5. 5.
al them that work vanity: but for their contempt and obstinacy, they shall
perish with the foolish: as above in the 1. Chapter and 22. verse. To the end
the^ that we may not perish with the folish, let us love instruction, and let
us not hate correction: and for to do this, let us be armed with patience, that
willingly and with a joyful heart we may suffer al afflictions and
adversities, and let us bear the Cross, mortifying our flesh, by diverse
tribulations. For instruction or correction, lies not only in words of
admonition, reprehension and threatening: but also in all sufferinges whatsoever
it shall please God to send us. Solomon has exhorted us unto this patience of
the Cross, above in the 3. Chapter, verses 11. 12. The Apostle does expound
Hebr. 12.
it after this sort, saying, Let us run with patience the race that is set
before us.

2 A good man gets favor of the Lord: but the man of wicked imaginations,
will he condemn.
What good works soever we do, yet must we confess that we are unprofitable
servants: and also that there is no man living that Luke 17. 10
does good and sins not. Let us not think that by our good deeds we can
deserve to draw the favor of God unto us. Notwithstanding, since it is said,
That a good man gets favor: etc. it is necessary that we should give
ourselves unto well doing, if we will draw unto us the favor of the Lord. For
as it is necessary that the Mat. 12. ^^.
good tree should bring forth his good fruit in his due season, eue^ so, if we
be good, we must give ourselves unto goodness, as well indeeds and works, as in
words. Thus doing, we shall have witness that we are good, and shall be assured
of the good will of God toward us: he will make us certain that we are
acceptable unto him, and that he loves us, and that of his only grace and
mercy. Wherefore, let us know, that when Solomon says, A good man gets, or
shall get, he speaks after the manner of men, for to accommodate himself unto
our weakness, and to show us that we shall not labor in vain, if we give
ourselves unto goodness: for the Lord will not refuse us, nor forsake us, but
will gather and draw us unto himself, of his only goodness, without any thing
of ours: yet must we not think it strange, though Solomon does attribute unto
man, that which is proper unto God aloue. This is for to show unto man that
he ought not to be slouthful, and without care: but that he should solicit
God to be favorable unto him. For as it is not without cause that the
Scripture does exhort us unto good works, and does call them ours, (and
notwithstanding it is said, We are his workmanship, Ephe. 2. 10. Phi. 2. 13.
created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has ordained, that we
should walk in them: For it is God which works in you, both the will and the
deed, even of his good pleasure:) even so also it is not without cause that
Solomon promises that the good shall draw the favor of the Lord, though it is
the Lord only that draw us unto himself. No man can come unto me, except the
Father, which has sent me, draw him. Again, No man comes unto the Father,
but by me. Therefore, when we hear that the Scripture does Ioh. 6. 44. Ioh.
14. 6.
attribute unto us any goodness or virtue, let us take heed from bosting
ourselves thereof, as though we had it of ourselves: but let us acknowledge that
God reckons that ours, which he of his only goodness and mercy works in us.
Therefore though that he alone does draw us by his favor, let us not think it
strange, that Solomon says, that the good does draw the favor of the Lord.
Touching the rest, let us note, that we have had the like promise here above in
the 11. Chapter, He that seeks good things, gets favor, etc. saving that
in that same he makes mention of favor generally, and hereof the favor of
the Lord. Wherein we ought to be advertised that the favor of men is nothing
but wind and smoke, except it proceed of the favor of God, and that it be
joined unto the same, so that it be for the honor of God, and because that he
loves us, that men should bear us favor. And therefore let us not have our
eye unto the favor of men, but let us content ourselves that God favors us.
We are also advertised, that if we be good, we have great need of the favor
of the Lord: for most commonly they which do well, are out of favor with the
world. Yet the Lord does not suffer that they should be wholly cast off, and
forsaken of men, but does raise up some for to favor them so much as is
expedient for their salvation. And in this sort, it is not properly men which
favor them, but God alone. And therefore, let us confess that Solomon says
very properly, That a good man does draw unto him the favor of the Lord:
and let us comfort ourselves in this unfaithful promise, knowing that if we be
good, though all the world should rise up against us, yet their enterprises shall
nothing hurt us, for God favors us. And therefore let us say, The Lord is
my light, and my Psalm. 27. 1. Psalm. 119. 6
salvation, whom then shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life, of
whom then shall I be afraid? The Lord is on my side: I will not fear what man
does unto me. Against this promise, he sets a threatening for to fear
the wicked, saying, But the man of wicked imaginations will he condemn. Here
Solomon sets the man of wicked imaginations, against the good man: and so,
though the word which he uses, does in his tongue signify the thoughts,
whether they be good or evil: yet by the Antithesis, he shows that he
speaks of him whose cogitations and thoughts, whose purpose and enterprises
do tend but to evil and hurt, the which he signifies also in condemning the
man of wicked imaginations. For if his thoughts were good, he should not be
condemned, but should get favor of the Lord, whose office is not to condemn
him which has good cogitations, whereby he tends to do well Psalm. 72. 12
unto his neighbors, but to justify and absolve him, when the wicked do
condemn him. He shall deliver the poor when he cries: the needy also and
him that has no helper. It is the manner of the world to oppress the good,
and to justify and absolve, and to quit the wicked. For the world is so
blind, that it counts the wicked imaginations for policy and finesse of
wit; wisdom, and good counsel, for watchfulnes, and care. It is commonly
said of the wicked, that they are worthy to live, because they dispatche
their affairs well at the cost and hinderance of the poor. But such
justification shall not profit them before the Lord, before whom we Romans 14.
10 2. Cor. 5. 10 Psalm. 5. 4.
must al appear. Now he knows them to be wicked, and therefore he will not
be favorable. For thou art the God that have no pleasure in wickedness:
neither shall any evil dwell with thee. But as God is righteous, so will he
condemn their desert. This condemnation shall be declared in the last day, in
the mean while, the Lord does often dissipate the enterprises of the wicked,
and so they come not to the end of their imaginations, but are frustrate: as
experience has taught, and does daily teach.

3 A man cannot be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous
shall not be moved.
This present sentence may seem to be a recital of the former. For it follows
well, (if God do condemn man, which does imagine evil, and none can resist
his judgment,) that the wickedness of man shall not profit him for to keep him
steadfast in one estate, and to make him prosper as he desires, and as him
seems, because he sees himself vpholden with such as favor him, that he
has credit, and abounds in temporal wealth: and as him seems, the poor
do tremble under him, because of the wrongs and oppressions that he
commits: but he is far of from his reckoning, as Solomon Psalm. 9. 16.
does here pronounce: and also David in his 9. Psalm, saying, The ungodly is
trapped in the work of his hands. Contrarily, albeit that the godly and
righteous are sharply tossed with diverse temptations, and that often it
seems they are lost and destroyed, yet because they get the favor of the
Lord, it follows that they are so well rooted, that their root shall not
remove, but shall prosper for ever, though it seem contrary unto the world.

4 A virtuous woman is the crown of her husband: but she that makes him
ashamed, is a corruption in his bones.
Solomon does here show unto the woman what she ought to be amongst her
household, and in her conversation with her neighbors, for to be joyful unto
her husband, and an ornament and honor unto him, and not to vex nor grieve
him. And therefore the wives which love their husbands, and have good desire to
do their duty toward them, ought diligently to hearken unto this lesson, that
they may understand what they have to do, or what to avoid for to show their
love, and to put their good desire in execution. First of al, when Solomon
says, A virtuous woman: he does show us that the wives ought not to desire
nor seek the delights and pleasures, rest, and idleness of the flesh, but to
carry the armor for to resist and fight against the concupiscences of the
flesh, by the which women are naturally drawn to become subject unto the
former things: and so of themselves they show themselves to be weak and faint
hearted: yet do they not think so, but do think themselves to be very valiant
when they can get their desires, be they good or evil, and do think to be
very strong, when by loud crying, by cursing and railing, by scratching and
biting, or other like violence, they withstand the^ which do hinder the^ to
obtain their will, and do as they would. Behold, what is force and power of the
greatest part of women. But the strength that Solomon demands of women, is
spiritual, the which ought to be exercised by the holy Ghost, who does teach
and guide them to their duty, according as it is showed them in the holy
scriptures, wherein women have faireglasses to look in, what they ought to be,
and how they ought to behave themselves: as for example, Sara, Rebecca,
Abigail, and others. They have therein also exhortations, laws, and
commandments, to the end, that in following them, and doing their duty, they
should show themselves virtuous and strong. The places of Scriptures serving
thereto, have been alleged. Now that this virtue or power ought to be
exercised as has bin said, Solomon does show it, when he calls A virtuous
woman, the Crown of her husband. For as Pro. 11. 16. and 22.
we cannot rejoice of a tree, neither glory nor boast of his goodness and
excellenice, except it bring us forth good fruit: even so, if a woman does not
exercise her power, and show the same by honest and godly conversation, she
cannot be the crown of her husband. For he cannot rejoice nor glory in the
virtue of his wife, as of an excellent and honorable vessel, except that this
virtue be showed outwardly by godly exercise. When we thus speak, we show that
Solomon does here take the crown, for joy, glory, honor and precious or
name^t: after as crowns Job 19. 9. Psalm. 21. 5. and 65. 11. 12 and 103. 4.
Esa. 23. 9. and 28. 1. 3. and 62. 3. Phil. 4. 1. 1. These. 2. 19 Iam. 1. 12. 1.
Pet. 5. 4. Genesis 2. 18. and 3. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 7. Genesis 2. 18. 24 1. Cor. 7. 2.
34. and 11. 3
are used: and also the scripture uses this word crown in the like sense.
And if we look narrowly to what end the woman was created, we shall find that
she ought to be to her husband, a joyful, glorious, honorable and precious
jewel. For the Lord says, it is not good that man should be by himself alone:
I will make him an helper meet for him. Thy desire shall be subject to thine
husband, and he shall rule over thee. And S. Paul says that the woman is the
glory of the man. When the scripture speaks thus, it teaches us that if the
woman will follow the ordinance of God, she shall be an excellent ornament unto
her husband. For we must not doubt but that God has ordained the woman to be a
great honor unto man, for to be a fellow and aid unto him, and that he has
made her subject unto man, as the rest of the body unto the head. But besides
this same, let us note that Solomon says not of her husbands, or of her
neighbors. For as it is not lawful for man to have many wives, but one alone:
eue^ so also the wife cannot have diverse husbands, but one only: as it may well
be gathered. Likewise as man ought not to join himself to any but to his wife
alone, in loving and cherishing her: eue^ so also the wife ought to content
herself with pleasing of her husband, and be subject unto him. Now after that
he has showed that by the exercise of virtue, the woman ought to rejoice and
honor her husband, Ephesians. 5. 22.
he shows by the contrary, that she does grieve, trouble, and dishonor him,
when he says, But she that makes him ashamed, etc. The corruption of the
bones brings great hurt unto the body, and makes it disformed, and so the
person is vexed and troubled, and cannot rightly do his office. Again, the
wife that despises virtue and the exercise thereof, and is given to be foolish,
and to play the wanton, intemperate, arrogant, and rebellious, slouthful and
negligent, in this sort she is a shame unto her husband, she greatly vexes
and troubles him, in such wise that he cannot set such order in his house as
behooves, and for this cause his affairs have evil success, whereby he is
brought under foot and to confusion. And in this manner the wicked wife is the
destruction of her husband, where as she ought to serve him for an helper and
succor, according as she is ordained of God. She is not then only rebellious
against men, but also against God: whereof follows, that she herself must also
go into corruption, and remain in eternal damnation.

5 The thoughts of the just are right: but the counsels of the wicked, are
deceitful.
It is not enough that we think to do well unto our neighbors, and to have no
desire to hurt them: it suffices not to think to do right unto our
neighbors, and not to do them any injury or violence: but eve rye one ought to
be so affectioned, that he should look how he could deliver the miserable and
afflicted from the wrongs and oppressions that the wicked do labor to work
them: otherwise we cannot boast to be ought worth. For as Solomon here
says, The thoughts of the just are right. Good people do seek out all the
honest and fit means to save and deliver the miserable from the violence and
wrong of the wicked. Every one of us ought to labor for it, and chiefly the
Magistrates, to whom the word is directed, It does Psalm. 82. 2. Iere. 22. 3
Romans 13. 4. 2. Pet. 2. 14
belong unto them so to do, for they bear the sword. Private persons have not
authority to repress injuries and wrongs by the sword: albeit that it is the
duty of every one of us for to help our neighbors, and to deliver them from
the oppression of the wicked. When S. Peter stepped forth to strike with the
sword, he was reproved. We should then look to minister help unto our
neighbors, but Mat. 26. 51. 52.
yet without sword: except the same be committed unto us, by the Magistrate,
and that we are expressly charged to use it. Otherwise, we must have as it were
our hands bound, but not our mouths stopped. It should serve to give
exhortation, to preach and to threaten, for to turn away injuries and wrongs.
This pertains unto al Christians, and above al, unto the Ministers of the
word, which should be folowers of the Prophets and Apostles. Contrarily, it is
not enough for the wicked to despise their neighbors, and not to think to do
them any good: but their hearts are so poisoned with malice, that they cease
not to consult and determine, to look and to devise all the means they can to
hurt their neighbors, and to destroy them: and chiefly they which take not
heed. Solomon does well signify this same, when he says, But the counsels of
the wicked, are deceitful. We may point out two reasons, for the which the
evil which they think, is called deceitful. First of al, because they set
trappes to catch them which take no heed of them, or which cannot perceive
them. Secondly, because they are counterfeit and disguised, they feign
themselves honest and good men, hiding their malice so much as they can: and
also they make themselves to believe that God does not see them, conspiring
and inuenting so secretly as they can. Solomon does give us this same to
understand briefly, by the deceitful counsels, and by the Psalm, His mouth is
full of cursing, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is ungodliness and vanity.
Hide me from the gathering together Psalm. 10. 7. and 64. 2. 3. and 94. 3. 8.
of the froward: and from the insurrection of wicked doers. Lord how long shall
the ungodly: how long shall the ungodly triumph? Thus thinking and saying, they
deceive themselves: and do well show that they are beasts: and therefore, they
are sharply reproved. O ye fools, when will you understand? And woe unto them
Esai. 29. 15
that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord.

6 The talking of the wicked, is to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of
the righteous will deliver them.
The manner and custom of the greatest part of the wicked, is that they would
be esteemed for honest and good men, and do boast thereof with open mouth.
Wherefore let us not think that Solomon means, that the wicked do openly say,
let us lay wait for blood: but they have this malicious craft, to bear false
witness against their neighbors, to lay false crimes to their charge, and to
interpret their works and their words to evil, to the end that they may have
some cloak, and to seem that they proceed as honest and good men, when they
labor to bring to ruin and destruction the innocents, the poor and weak
which do not take heed of their malice, or have not power to save themselves
from their violence. The world is so filled with such wicked men, that rightly
we may complain, The good Mich. 7. 2.
man is perished out of the earth. The Prophets, our lord Jesus Christ and his
Apostles, have been handeled after this sort. And blessed are Mat. 9. 10.
they which suffer with them. But what prosperity soever there is in the
patience that we have in trouble, and though we must rejoice therein, yet it is
not to say, but that we should have compassion of the^ which suffer, and to
think how to deliver the^, and to procure the same: and if we can not better,
and restore it at the leastwise, that we should labor by prayers,
exhortations, and threatenings, if it be needful: otherwise, we are faint, and
have not a right heart, Solomon does show us this same, when he says, But the
mouth of the righteous will deliver, for whose blood they lay wait. Now as
such wicked men do work the overthrow of others, so also shall they be
overthrown themselves: and contrarily, the just which labor to save their
neighbors, shall be delivered, as follows.

7 God overthrows the wicked, and they are not: but the house of the
righteous shall stand.
The wicked are like unto an house builded without foundation: Mat. 7. 26.
And therefore let the good comfort themselves.

8 A man shall be commended for his wisdom: but the froward of heart shall be
despised.
There is none of us that would gladly suffer himself to be despised, nor to be
evil spoken of, but do al desire to be esteemed, and to be well and honestly
spoken of. Wherefore we must be very attentive unto the doctrine that Solomon
does presently give us: for he does show us the way for to attain unto that
which we desire, touching our reputation and good name. This is the wisdom
wherewithal if we be endewed, he does promise us commendation. We must
therefore be given unto wisdom, and we shall be had in good reputation, and
shall be praised and commended. But to the end that we may not be deceived, let
us know, that there has been^ and are in the world many honest men and well
learned, after the outward appearance, and in the feeling of the flesh, the
which have been, and are well counted of, and praised of them which are led with
a carnal and worldly affection: but as such wisdom is condemned of God, even
so, that reputation vanishes away very quickly, as al men do prove by
experience, saving those which know not what wisdom is. Solomon speaks not
here of such wisdom, but of that which is joined together with upright heart,
whereby we labor to profit our neighbors, and to do hurt to no man. He does
show it, when he sets a froward heart against wisdom, saying, But the
froward of heart shall be despised. At the first sight it seems unto the
faithful poor afflicted, being weak and full of infirmities, that the
contrary of this sentence is true. For we see that as the wicked do please and
praise themselves: so also they have a great number of flatterers to applaud
and to commend them. And as the faithful do walk in humility, and esteem
not of themselves: even so also the world does contemn the^. This same has
bin tried and is proved daily. Notwithstanding the same lets not this
sentence to be true: for Solomon does not speak of that which is done in the
world amongst the wicked, but of that which ought to be done, showing us, what
God does allow, and disallowe: and what the children of God ought to praise,
and what they ought to contemn and abhor. Let us then understand that
Solomon promises unto them which have true wisdom, that they shall be esteemed
before God, who also will cause them to be esteemed and reverenced of men so
far as he shall know to be necessary for them: and therewith also he
declares unto us what is our duty toward them, to the end that we should
not follow the foolishnes and malice of the world, which does mock and
persecute the wise and prudent, but that we should have them in admiration,
speaking well of them, and giving them honor and reverence, in being at their
commandment, and obeying their admonitions, instructions, and exhortations:
and in trembling at their reprehensions and threatenings: as we honor the wise
magistrates, godly Ministers, our fathers and mothers. Contrarily, let us
know, that he threateneth the foolish and wicked which are so much perverted
and overcome, that they give themselves to nothing but to vanity and
foolishness, unto ungodliness and filthiness: let us know I say, that he
threateneth such people denouncing unto them that God will despise them, with a
horrible and fearful contempt. Let us know also that they are well worthy to be
contemned before men, and that they which know them to be such, should abhor
them, and esteem them not only as filth and doung, but also as poison and
deadly pestilence, even verily to hate them, and to pray for their destruction,
yet without being led with any carnal affection, which should draw us to seek
our particular profit, and to revenge ourselves upon the^ which should hinder
the same: but that only we should have before our eyes the honor and glory
of God, and the rest and peace of his. Then may we say, Stand up, o Lord, in
thy wrath, and lift up thy self. etc. Let God arise, and let his enemies be
scattered. etc. Psalm. 7. 6. Psalm. 68. 1. Psalm. 139. 19
Will thou not slay the wicked O God? etc. Moreover let us note, first of al
forasmuch as al wisdom comes of God, and that none is endued therewith but
by his grace and goodness, and that for the same we are esteemed of by our
neighbors, and that they commend and praise us for it, let us take good heed
from being delighted with ourselves, and to be drunken with such praises,
thinking that they are due unto us of right: but walking with humblenes, let us
say, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praise, etc.
If we do contrarily, we deserve to hear, What have Psalm. 115. 1 1. Cor. 4. 7.
thou, which thou have not received.

9 He that is despised, and is his own servant, is better then he that
boasts himself and lacks bread.
We all naturally are set to glory and boasting, and do love rest, and are glad
that others should labor for us, and serve us: for this cause we think it
very strange that Solomon should here commend baseness and service. But seeing
we love not to want victuals, and do fear to starve for hunger, so that for
bread we will apply ourselves to the vilest office that can be thought of,
rather then we will die for hunger, let us not therefore find it strange
though Solomon does commend the man that is despised, and does apply his work
for to serve and help himself, and to earne his bread in the sweat of his
face. He does not simply and absolutely commend the baseness and service, but by
comparison. For in that that man is constrained to become slave and bound,
comes of sin. And thus abiection and service are after a sort the reward
for sin, which we Genesis 3. 17.
were better to suffer, then to run into further danger and trouble, that is
to say, to starve for hunger. There is none of us but if necessity prick him,
that will not rather choose to humble himself and to give himself to work,
then to suffer himself to die for hunger, by contemning labor and work. And
such an election is agreeable unto the ordinance of God, when we are set to
work in good conscience. Man in the beginning was in a noble and excellent
state, as we may well understand when it is said, That God did create him unto
his image and likeness: and when it is said, they both were naked, etc. But
sin did otherwise change their estate. The (...). 1. 27 and. 2. 24 Eccle. 7.
31
Ecclesiastes does well signify the same, saying, That God has made man
righteous: but they have sought many inventions And thus from the beginning we
have experime^ted, that he which exalts himself, shall be brought low. Now
albeit that humility and bondage are pains due for sin, yet seeing they are
of small continuance, and that the Lord would have us to bear them for to
mortify our flesh (the which otherwise would run into al filthiness and
uncleanness, into al insolency and dissolutenes) we must not abhor them,
neither to be grieved to be despised, to be vile and abject, and to abase
ourselves to do the works of servants, and chiefly when they are fit and
meet to provide for the necessities of us and our household, and needy
brethren: but we must rejoice therein, knowing that in such estate we are not
unprofitable unto our neighbors and also that we ourselves thereby reap
profit. Solomon does signify it, by this word, and is his own servant. He
means not by this word to teach us to be niggardes, to love ourselves, to
make our particular profit, without having care of our neighbors. If he spoke
after the manner of the world; and carnal men, which will say, give us more of
your purse, and less of your courtesy: and will forget al glory, pomp and
magnificence for to labor least we should dye for hunger, there might be
inferred upon his saying, that it were enough for us to meddle with our own
business, and not to care for our neighbors: seeing that after the world, man is
servant to himself, who does his works without thinking that his neighbors
do belong to him, or that he is bound unto them. And such a worthy man is
preferred before him which boasts himself, and by glory will not esteem to
set his hand to work, and in the mean while shall be ready to starve. They
which are most given to the flesh, and to the world, have taken such an
opinion, and do also seem at the first sight that Solomon does follow it: but
Solomon being instructed by the spirit of God, has uttered this sentence by
the same spirit, by whom we al are one body in Jesus Christ, and every one,
one another members. Let us learn that Solomon calls man a servant for
himself, or his own servant, Romans 12. 4. 1. Cor. 12. 12. Ephe. 4. 4.
the which does follow his vocation, and therein does labor for to obey God, by
loving of his neighbor as himself. Whereupon it follows that he sets
himself to work looking to profit his neighbors and laboring to succor
them when need requires: otherwise there is no love in him. Whosoever has
this worlds good, and sees his has need, and shuts his compassion from
him, how dwells the love of God in him? But we must mark the next
exhortation: 1. John. 3. 17. and 18.
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but indeed,,
and in truth. A man thus doing, is his own servant, and is better then him
that glories, and yet has nothing to sustain himself, much less to help
his neighbors. When Solomon says is better, he means not that the needy
boaster, and vain glorious is good, seeing he is neither profitable to
himself, nor to his neighbors, but hurtful. For to live, he must use either
craft and subtlety, or force and violence, or else other unlawful means, as to
borowe without willing to pay again, or else to sell that which is not his. Such
a personage is no better then a thief, or a robber, in who^ there is no
goodness, but al hurt and hinderance. Therefore when Solomon says, Better, he
denies that the glorious wanter is good, that he might on the contrary part
affirm the goodness of him which is despised, and yet he serves himself so
well, that he wants nothing, and labors to help his poor members to get
to sustein themselves. Besides this he wills us not to be grieved, though we
be despised of the world, but that we should conceive so humbly of ourselves,
that we might rightly say, Lord, mine heart is not hauty, neither are mine eyes
lofty. Our Lord Jesus Christ has not disdained to be counted an artificer
or handicraftes man. He disdained not to take upon him the form a servant:
and therefore S. Psa. 131. 1. Mar. 6. 3. Phi. 2. 5.
Paul exhorts us, saying, Let the same mind be in you, that was even in
Christ Jesus. etc. Furthermore let us know that Solomon prayseth and
commends labor and travel, and shows us that we ought not to boast
ourselves of any goodness, when we do not apply ourselves to do our office:
for then we are unprofitable, and are not worthy of the bread that we eat.
For even when we were with you, this we warned you of, that if there were 2.
These. 3. 10.
any, which would not work, that he should not eat. To conclude, let us
know that Solomon does teach us, that every one should content himself
with his own vocation and state, and therein to labor according as he knows
the will of God to be: and that none should brag, nor presume to support many
charges, and to occupy diverse offices. For as the Proverb says, who so
gripeth too much, does hold so much the worse: that is, he that would al
have, shall al forgo. They which are contented to hold their estate, are
willingly contented with sufficiency, and as well for themselves as to help the
necessity of their neighbors. Contrarily, they which are vain boasters,
presuming to be sufficient to govern many affairs, and do fall into such
necessity that they have nothing whereon to eat, except they borrow it, or
stealeit, so much it wants that they have wherewith to satisfy them which
labor for them, or to them, to whom rhey stand bound. The doctrine of Paul
is not contrary to this same, when he says, Let him that stole, steal no
more. etc. This doctrine seems very plain, but it is not easy to do, that
we can attain thereunto without brideling Ephe. 4. 28
our corrupt nature, considering the inclination thereof.

10 A righteous man regards the life of his beast: bu^ the mercies of the
wicked are cruel.
For to show how the poor despised man, and he that is his own servant is
better, he does attribute unto him righteousness: and that because so much it
wants that he is not negligent in doing his duty toward men, that he does
not neglect nor contemn his beast which serves him to labor with all, but
does administer unto him that which is necessary: he shows this same, when
he does say, A righteous man regards. etc. And herein he has respect to
the law which says, Thou shall not muzzle, etc. Saint Paul does allege
this law for to show that the ministers of the word ought to be rewarded for
their labor, and Deuteronomy. 25. 4. 1. Cor. 9. 9.
that they should have distributed unto them that which is necessary for them
to live and to do their office. And albeit there is not so little a bird
whereof God takes no care: yet notwithstanding for to declare that by his law,
god has had more regard unto men, for whom al things are created, then to
oxen, Saint Paul denies that god takes care for oxe^: not that he would
exclude oxen from the providence of God, without the which nothing can remain
in this world: but he means that this law was not given for the cause of
oxen, but to the end that we should understand how great care we should
have over our neighbors, when God commands us expressly to take care of oxen.
Now also when Solomon speaks, that the righteous man regards the life of
his beast, let us not think that he does attribute righteousness unto a man
for taking care of his beast, neither that he would that the man should be
counted just because he regards to nourishe his horses, or oxen which labor:
but he reasons from the less to the greater, as if he said, If the
righteous does take pain to provide for his beast, and to do all the good he
can to him, or is necessary for him: by a stronger reason he will be moved,
to show gentleness toward his neighbors, and will accustom himself too
use upright dealing, to the end thereby that he may do his duty to them,
and not to defraude them. And so doing, he shall show that he isled with a
gentle and loving, good and righteous affection, and that he has no desire to
hurt, but that he intends to profit his neighbors. By such exercises he
shall not be righteous: but because he is righteous, he will apply himself unto
them, and will show himself righteous to the edification of his neighbors, as
the good fruit makes not the good tree, but because the tree is good, he
brings forth good fruit, and thereby declares his goodness. Solomon then
does not here exalt our works to make us to boast of the^, but he provoke us
to do so well that our neighbors should feel and perceive us to be soft
and gentle, and not to contemn them, to deal evil with them, to hurt them,
and hinder them, as do the wicked: even as Solomon does signify, when he
says, But the mercies of the wicked are cruel, He judges the affections
which are inward and hid, the which are known to God only. The heart is

things, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, and try the reins.
Again, God sees not as man sees: for man looks on and. 10.
the outward appearance, but the Lord beholds the heart. Yet nevertheless
he medleth not with the office of God, but when he sees that the wicked do
abound in evil fruits of wicked works, that they exercise cruelties in
borrowing and not paying again, seeing that such ungentleness cannot proceed
but of cruel affection, 1. Sam. 16. 7
by such exercises Solomon does judge rightly of the inward parts, though he
does not behold them with his eyes. For the tree is known by his fruit. And
in pronouncing of that which is within, he shows what their outward
conversation is, that is to say, infamous, wicked and cruel. For an evil tree
cannot bring Mat. 7. 16. and. 12. 33
forth good fruit. And because, that none would be counted cruel,
therefore, it is needeful, first of all that we refourme the inward part: as
the Lord does show unto us, when he rejects all the outward holiness,
for the cruelty which he expresses, saying, For your hands are full of
blood. And afterward when he exhorts, wash ye then, etc. Ye make clean
the outside of Esaias. 1. 11. 15. 16. Mat. 23. 25. and. 26. Ezec. 36. 25
the Cup, and of the Platter: but within they are full of bribery and excess.
But it is not in your power thus to do: it is the work of the Lord. Then will
I power clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: yea from al your
filthiness, etc. Wherefore we must pray unto God, and say, Purge me with
hysope, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter then snow. The
Pope with his shauelinges has need thus to pray. For if there be any people
in the world which bear any cruel affection, they have it, seeing that Psalm.
51. 7.
they do not only spoil men's goods for to enrich themselves, but also so much
as in them lies, steal souls from God, to give them to the devil. They are
of the number of them whom Ezechiel speaks, Woe unto the shepheardes of
Israel, that feed themselves: should not the shephearde feed the flocks?
For this cause we Ezech. 34. 2
are admonished to beware of them. They which next succeed the false doctors
in cruel affections, are they which under color of ministering justice, do
judge through parciality, having regard too persons, taking bribes, and not
giving the right unto him that it belongs Esaias. 1. 23.
unto. Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. etc.

11 He that tilleth his land, shall be satisfied with bread: but he that
follows the idle, is destitute of understanding.
For to give courage unto the man which is servant for himself, and his own
man, he makes us a promise, the accomplishement whereof is very needeful for
us, yea necessary to maintain us in this life, he promises Satisfiyng with
bread: that is to say, that the man which shall be dilligent and careful to do his
office, to follow his estate and vocation, shall want nothing that is necessary
for to live in this world, but shall have enough and contentation. For by bread
are signified al things necessary for to uphold this life: and by satisfiyng
is meant contentation. Now he that is contented with things necessary, is rich
enough.

Albeit the^ that Solomon does not name but bread only, yet does he not
promise any small thing, as might seem at the first sight: but does promise
riches, as before in the 10. Chapter and 4. verse. And since that these riches
are necessary, and that he does not promise the^ but unto the labourer, it
follows that he exhorts us unto labor, and does show us that it is
necessary for us to labor. And albeit that of our nature we are not so much
given to do pleasure and service unto our neighbors, as that we will leave our
own work to do theirs: and also are not so diligent nor so earnest in taking
of pain that we should take other men's work in hand with our own: yet
notwithstanding because there are many curious and indiscreet, which forsaking
their office, would gladly take both the office and work of others in hand,
Solomon would not omit to teach us, that we should keep ourselves within our
limits: And therefore he has not said simply, That whosoever does till the
earth, but he that tilleth his land. Let us therefore learn not to take in
hand that which does not belong unto us, otherwise we should not be
compelled to leave our vocation: for we are not able to deal in diverse
estates, neither have shoulders strong enough for to bear many burdens. We
are like unto a body whose members have diverse operations and offices, and
where every member does his own office without intermedling in the office of
the other: and in this sort there is no confusion of disorder in the body, but
the members are careful and help one another. S. Paul does teach us such
similitudes, for to show us that none ought to think Romans 12. 4. 1. Cor. 12.
12
and esteem of himself more then behooves, that every one ought to employ
himself after the measure of the grace that he has received, and that every
one use his estate, so as he should also care for his neighbor. But because
he speaks but of the tilling of the land, it might seem that the promise
to be filled with bread, does not belong but only unto them which till the
land, which do plant the vines, which do sow and reap, and which are
occupied about the land: but let us know that al they which busy themselves
in any work that is meet and agreeable unto their vocation which is allowed
of God, are worthy to be satisfied with bread. And therefore, albeit Solomon
does not speak but of the tilling of the land, yet does he not exclude
other vocations which are not forbidden of God, but under one kind, he
comprehends all occupations and works, and al estates which God has
ordained for men to be occupied, that they should not eat their bread for
naught, in slothfulness and idleness. If any man demand Genesis 2. 15. and 3.
17.
why Solomon has rather named the tilling of the earth, then any other estate:
there may be two reasons assigned for the same. The first is, that the tilling
of the land was first ordained. The second is, that thereby the earth does
bring forth unto us that which is most necessary for the maintenance of this
present life: that is to say, bread, by the means whereof we obtain al other
necessaries and corporal profits. We may well understand it when Christ
teaching Mat. 6. 12
us to ask that which is needful for this life, does not make mention but of
bread. Moreover let us note, that since Solomon does promise that we shall be
satisfied with bread, that it is lawful for us to desire riches, but only such
as are necessary. It is not lawful for us to desire a great superfluous
abundance, but we should content ourselves with a small thing, as Solomon does
signify it, though he does promise us but bread. Not so but that God does
give us al other meats the which we may use with thanks giving: but we must
not be curious of them, as are the gluttons and dainty mouthed which care only
for their mouths and bellies, and care no whit for their neighbors. Albeeit
such manner of people have plently of bread yet are they not filled: for they
are never satisfied. After this promise he adds a threatening to the
contrary, the which he expresses by a reproof, saying, but he that
follows the idle, is destitute of understanding. For to express and to
describe the man which will not labor, he says that he is slouthful, that is
to say, that he labors to be like unto them, and herein he closely does
chide and threaten them: as before in the 16. chap. and 6. verse, etc. And to
finishe the reproof, he says he is destitute of understanding, and by such
reprehension which is common in the world against the slouthful, he shows
that he that follows them, is well worthy to dye for hunger: for since he is
void of understanding, his outward members, as arms and legs do feel
thereof, whereof does follow poverty. A slouthful hand makes poor, etc. And if
man for want of laboring Pro. 10. 4.
to get his corporal bread, deserves to be called destitute of understanding:
by a more strong reason, he which has no care of the health of his soul,
has a very faint heart.

12 The wicked desires the net of evils: but the root of the righteous gives
fruit.
The hunter or the fouler that desires to make his profit in hunting or
fouling, does not only set and lay to take one beast or one foul, but many:
and to obtain his desire, he prepares his lawnes toils and nets, and
does place them as he knows they will serve him best to make greatest
spoil of beasts: for he does not hunt after them for to nourish and keep
them alive, but to kill and ea^e them, and to satisfy his desire: even so the
wicked is not contented to commit one evil, but does invent many, and against
many persons, and chiefly against the weak and feeble, against the simple and
innocent, which want power or wisdom to resist the wicked, as do the beasts
that the huntsman or fouler pursues. And to come to the end of his devises
and enterprises, he uses diverse arts, according as they are fit to bring him
his desire, and come to the end of his enterprise: one while he proceeds by
craft and subtlety, another time by force and violence, sometimes by cruel
words, as by rebukes, false witness bearing and threateninges. Solomon does
signify the same in few words, when he says, The wicked desires, etc.
And as it is more amply described in the Psalms: Saul against David, Absalon
against Psalm. 10. 7. and 50. 16.
his Father David: Judas with the Scribes and Pharisees against Jesus Christ
have well showed that they did desire a multitude of evils. The Pope and his
soldiers, tyrants and enemies of truth do well show that they desire a
multitude of evils against the children of God. We feel that other wicked men
also, as judges and ungodly counselors, murderers, thieves, usurers,
covetous, whoremo^gers and adulterers do wish a net of evils. For all these have
bent themselves theretoo, and do daily. Whereupon it comes that the
Psalmist prays and often complains, Draw Psalm. 31. 4. Psalm. 35. 4. and
142. 1. 2. ^
me out of the net that they have laid privily for me. Again, Let them be
confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul, etc. Again, I cried
unto the Lord with my voice: with my voice I prayed unto the Lord. I powered
out my meditation before him and declared my affliction in his presence. Though
my spirit was in perplexity in me, yet thou knew my path: in the way
wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me.

But as it is commonly said, that hunters do often loose their paths: even
so also the Lord brings to naught the awaytinges, enterprises, and
ymaginations that the wicked work against the faithful: as Joseph, Moses,
David, Ezekias, the Prophets, our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles, and as
the true faithful do also feel at this day. For after that GOD has exercised
and tried them a certain time through the pursuit of these wicked hunters and
huntsmen, in the end at most need he does deliver them, and perceiving and
knowing themselves to be delivered, they say, Who so dwells in the secret
Psalm. 91. 1.
of the most high, shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty. Again, Praised
be the Lord, which has not given Psalm. 124. 6. and 7.
us as a pray unto their teeth. Our soul is escaped, even as a byrd out of
the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken and we are delivered. But when
these wicked huntsmen are sent of GOD for to follow after the ungodly, to
destroy them, then they loose not the way. As the Prophet Jeremy says,
Behold says the Lord, I will send out many fishers, and they Iere. 16. 16.
shall fish them, and after, will I send out many hunters, and they shall hunt
them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the caves of the
rocks. Now as Solomon has compared the wicked unto the huntsman which
pitcheth and sets a long net: even so contrarily he compares the
righteous, that is to say, those which have no desire to hurt, but rather
would profit their neighbors, he does liken them, I say, unto a tree which
is strongly planted and soundly rooted: as also they are in other places
likened theretoo. Solomon making the like Psa. 1. 3. Ier. 17. 8.
comparison, says,

But the root of the righteous gives fruit. As he has attributed
unprofitableness, hurt, hinderance and destruction unto the wicked, whereupon
comes their damnation: even so contrarily, he attributes frutefulnesse or
profit unto the righteous: Psalm. 7. 15. and 9. 16. Pro. 2. 21. and 3. 2.
whereupon it does follow that they shall continue, as has been treated upon.
The frutefulnesse that the righteous do bring forth, comes from within, as
Solomon does signify, when he attributes fruit to come from the root. Let
us then learn that all our inward parts must be sound and good, if we will
bring forth Mat. 12. 35.
any excellent fruit. Solomon calls the inward parts of man A root, and
that very aptly for first of al, as the root of the tree lies hid in the
earth: even so can we not see the affections and desires of man. For what is
he that knows the things of men? Secondly, as by the fruit we come to know
what the root of the tree is: even so a man by his words and works does
reveal Mat. 7. 16. and 20.
what he is within. Thirdly, as the tree without the root cannot spring nor
bring forth fruit: even so man cannot be occupied to profit his neighbors,
but so far as his will and affection do lead and guide him. Now that the
root does signify the inward part, we may understand it, when Solomon
does place it against desires. Not he alone does use it in this
signification, but Moses Deu. 29. 18. Heb. 12. 15. Romans 11. 16. 1. Cor. 3. 6.
also, And the Apostle to the Hebrews. Saint Paul also does show the same
speaking of them that are entered by the Gospel, when he speaks, he has
planted, and Apollo watered, etc.

13 The evil man is snared by the wickedness of his lips: but the just shall
come out of adversity.
They that are malicious and wicked, may be encombred in many and diverse
sorts by the fault of their lips. For first of all GOD does blind them and
give them over unto a reprobate mind, in such wise that they rather believe
the lies of false Prophets and Doctors, then the truth: they give more
credit unto false witnesses, then to the simple and plain affirmation of the
innocent and trusty: and will rather choose of set malice false witnesses, then
they will be put by from oppressing and spoiling the innocent. Such people do
well deserve to be snared, to or be destroyed: for they go precisely against
the commandment Exodus 23. 1. 2
and ordinances of GOD. And as they deserve to be snared, so shall they be.
Unto them that are contentious and disobey the truth, and obey
unrighteousness, shall be indignation and wrath* God shall send them strong
delusion, that they should Romans 2. 8. 2. These. 2. 11 12.
believe lies, That al they might be damned which believed not the truth, but
had pleasure in unrighteousness. The children of Israel were snared by the
sin of their lips, when they would not obey the holy Prophets, but
suffered themselves to be deceived by the false Prophets. The Turks and
Papists lie in the same misery and destruction. Secondarily, as they rail and
abuse their neighbors by injurious words and that their mouths are filled
with craft and treason to work the destruction of their neighbors: even so
again shall destruction fall upon them: Thou shall destroy al them that speak
leasing, etc. Again, Psalm. 5. 6. 9.
For no constancy is in their mouths: within, they are very corruption; their
throat is an open sepulcher, and they flatter with their tongue. The world is
stuffed with such evil tongues, and therefore David complains, Help Lord
for there is not a godly man left: for the faithful are failed from among the
children of men. They speak deceitfully every one with his neighbor,
flattering Psalm. 12. 1. 2
with their lips, and speak with a double heart, Thirdly, when the wicked are
apprehended by justice, oftentimes GOD suffers that they hurt and wound
themselves by their own answers, when they are examined: and are so found
guilty: whereupon follows the gallows, wheretoo they condemn themselves by
their own mouth: and so are snared through fault of their own lips: or
otherwise being examined, if they persist in their lying, not confessing their
fautes, they fall more deeply into the Devils snares: and so are entangled by
the fault of their lips. To be short, if the wicked follow their corrupt
nature with obstinacy without returning to repentance, there can be nothing
but sin in their lips. For it is said, Generation of vipers, how can you
speak good things, when ye are evil? For from the Mat. 12. 34. and 36.
abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. And therefore they must needs
be snared in their words. For in the same former place it is said again:
But I say unto you that of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
give account thereof at the day of judgment. And as they have wicked lips, so
do they join themselves to their like, as to false Doctors, unto liars and
seducers, and which have nothing but vanity and wickedness in their mouths.
After this sort they become entangled and are snared. But to the end that we
may forsake their company, let us follow the counsel of Saint Paul. And
forasmuch as it is a singular benefit of GOD to be preserved Romans 16. 17.
Col. 2. 6. Ephe. 4. 17. and 5. 6.
from the deceit and counterfaite speech, fained and false, and not to consent
unto heresies and wicked doctrines, and also not to be stained with any of
them, we have need to pray unto GOD after this sort, Deliver my soul, O
Lord, from lying lips, and Psalm. 120. 2. Psalm. 140. 1. 2. 3.
from a deceitful tongue. Again, Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man:
preserve me from the cruel man, which ymagine evil things in their heart, and
make war continually. They have sharpened tongues like a serpent, adders
poison is under their lips. But albeeit that the wicked may be snared in all
these foresaid manners, yet the meaning most meet for this place, is that the
wicked cannot beware nor take heed from being overthrown and destroyed by
fair and flattering speeches, by lies and false witnesses, by slaunderinges
and false reports, by false doctrines and traditions of men. For as he
ymagineth nothing but evil and destruction, and applies his mouth, yea all his
members, to hurt and anoy his neighbors, he rightly deserves to have the
like happen unto him. This same may be understood when against the evil man,
he sets the just: and against to be snared, he sets to come out of
adversity, saying,

But the just shall come out of adversity. He calls him righteous here,
which does not ymagine nor say any thing that may hurt or anoy his
neighbors. He does not promise him that he shall be without adversity (for
experience teaches the contrary: Great are the troubles of the righteous:
but the Lord delivers Psalm. 34. 20.
them out of all) but according to the promise here set down, he says that
he shall come out of adversity. Whatsoever then the wicked do ymagine,
think, say or do against the just, they cannot destroy them. The wicked
watches the righteous, and Psalm. 37. 22.
seeks to slay him: but the Lord will not leave him in his hand, etc. In this
promise we are exhorted unto patience: for trouble or adversity lies upon
us, since it is said that the just shall come out thereof. He says not that
he does presently come out, but in time to come, he shall come forth. He
tells not when, and so it seems unto our reason, that GOD lingereth and
tarieth long ere he help us: but it is no slacknesse. And to the end that
Heb. 10. 37. 2. Pet. 3. 9. Iam. 5. 10. Heb. 12. 2.
we should not fail nor stumble, we must take heed unto the holy Prophets,
and chiefly unto our Lord Jesus. He is not only our example, but also our
strength and virtue. It is he which is our patience: for we cannot stand fast
and continue, except that he fortify and uphold us.

14 A man shall be satiate with good things by the fruit of his mouth: and the
recompense of a man's hands shall God give unto him.
Solomon exhorts us to use well our mouths, and to employ them to speak
truth, to thank, to praise and to call upon God our Father by prayer, when he
promises us that a man shall be satiate, etc. And herein he somewhat alludeth
unto the old sacrifices. Deuteronomy. 12. 7. and 14. 23.
For as they which offered the sacrifices, did eat of them by the permission
and ordinance of God: even so by following the counsel of the Prophet O seas,
if we take the words with us, and Ose. 14. 2
return unto the Lord, and say unto him, Take away al iniquity, and receive
us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips, And that in all
things we give thanks always unto God by Jesus Christ, that is, the fruit
of the lips which confess his name: Heb. 13. 15.
If (I say) in following the doctrine of the above named holy men, we apply our
mouths to speak truth, and that by them we give good counsel unto our
neighbors, admonishing, exhorting, correcting, and threatening them, for to
bring them unto true repentance, and to strengthen them in the faith: if
feeling our necessities we open our mouths, for to require and call upon God
for to help us, and truly confessing that he is the author of all
goodness, and do occupy our tongues in giving of thanks unto him, and to
sing forth his praises: he will not suffer us to lack or want any thing, but
will give us enough and contentation. The ancient Levites and Sacrificers by
the ordinance of GOD, were nourished and sustained by using their ministry.
Number. 18. 9. Deuteronomy. 10. 9. and. 18. 1. 1. Chro. 6. 31. Number. 10. 10 Psalm. 8. 2.
and 11.
David ordained of them to be over the art of singing, according as was
commanded in the law of Moses. And the Psalm 81. having respect unto this
order of the service of GOD, does bid us, Sing joyfully: and afterward does
promise us that we shall be satisfied, saying, Open thy mouth wide, and I shall
fill it. For to do this well, it suffiseth not for the mouth alone to be
occupied, but the song must come from the mind, etc. That which proceeds
from the mouth of Papists is no fruit, but poison: as we may understand and
gather. And therefore this promise does nothing appertain unto them: as also
they are nothing partakers thereof: for they burn so much with avarice, that
they are never satisfied, and make themselves believe that they serve GOD and
his Church well, when they can make the water come to the mill (as is said) or
increase the goods of the Church. Of such kind of people Saint Paul says,
that they are of a corrupted mind. After this promise, he adds, And the
recompense of the hands, etc.

This sentence contains partly a promise, and partly a threatening: as we
may understand by other places. This sentence, as also the former promise,
shall chiefly be accomplished at the last day. Yet notwithstanding in looking
for it, the Lord does show some proofs thereof: for even in this life
present, the good are so well recompensed that they content themselves:
Contrarily, we may see fearful punishementes, fall and light upon the wicked,
the which are paid them after their deserts: but that which is given unto the
good, comes of mere grace: as above in the 11. chapter, 18. verse, and
chapter 12. verse, 2.

15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hears counsel,
is wise.
When after the natural reason, or human sense, or the affection of the
flesh, we follow our fantasies, inventions and good intentes, we seem to
ourselves to be very wise, and that we walk uprightly. But since that in so
doing, we wander and go out of the way which is taught us by the word, the
which only is right: Solomon, or rather the holy Ghost, lets not to
pronounce us fools, when he says, The way of a fool, etc. Moses seeing
before hand how the children of Israel did stray from Deuteronomy. 3^
the service of God, that he had taught them, by his word, calls them
fools and unwise, saying, they have corrupted themselves toward him by their
vice. etc. For the self same cause, Jeremy also since that time, has called
them fools, saying, Hear now this, O foolish people, and without
understanding, which Iere. ^. 21.
have eyes and see not, which have ears and hear not. And forasmuch as the
Papists at this day do the like, delighting in their abominations, we may
truly say they are a foolish people. Now if they which think they do well,
are foolish, by a stronger reason, they which boast themselves in their
wickednesses, the which they commit against their consciences, deserve well to
be counted foolish. For this cause also it is said of them, The fool has
said in his heart, there is no God, etc. Except therefore that Psalm. 14. ^
we be assured that that which we say, or do, is according to that which
God teaches us by his word, let us take good heed from persuading ourselves
that we do walk right. For there is no way right, but only that which the
Lord God does show unto us in his law. The same is not ours, as well for that
that of our nature we forsake it, and are not pleased therewith, as also for
that we cannot walk, but that GOD will guide us, nor go forewardes without
his assistance, as may be gathered out of the hundredth and nynetienth Psalm.
Therefore when any thing does delight us besides the word of God, we are
foolish: for our way is right before our eyes. The same is called ours, as well
for that that we become forgetful of God, despise him, and rebel against him,
for to follow our fantasies and affections: as also for that that whatsoever
pleases us, is invented by our brains, or comes from our Fathers which have
been ignorant of the word, or that we attribute the same unto our wisdom
and cunning, unto our care and diligence. And indeed, we do well deserve that
such way should be ours, seeing it is nothing worth. For seeing that we are
good for nothing, we cannot be occupied about any thing that is ought.
Whereupon it follows that we are foolish, if we delight in such work:
for in such sort do we declare openly our foolishenesse, when that which is
nothing worth, yea rather which is hurtful unto us, does please us.

Contrarily, if so be by renouncing of that which is our own, and abhor it,
we do give ear unto those which give us good counsel, and believe the same,
delighting to follow it, and to order our life thereafter, we are wise: as
Solomon does affirm saying, But he that hears counsel, is wise. He
speaks not here of the corporal and external hearing, but of the inward and
Pro. 1. 25.
spiritual. For albeeit that the counsel whereof he speaks is the pure
word of truth, which serves to teach, to exhort, to correct and to
threaten: many do hear this word, and yet are not Mat. 7. 26.
wise. We must therefore hear with an earnest mind, to take pleasure, and to
give al diligence to follow the counsel that is given us in the name of GOD,
and by his word. Otherwise we must look for a fearful judgment: yea more
then the Papists Pro. 1. 26.
or other infidelles, which have not such communication of counsel as we have.
They have counsel which makes to err, and we have counsel which leads us
straight to life, if we follow it. Notwithstanding they shall be no more
excusable then the most unthankful: as are they whom God lighteneth by the
preaching of the pure truth and do despise it, mocking, refusing and
persecuting it. Moreover, for to show ourselves wise, and Luke. 18. 11. John.
9. 28. and 34.
not to be counted fools, let us be more ready to condemn ourselves, then
to boast ourselves: let us not be like unto the Pharisees.

16 A fool in a day shall be known by his anger: but he that covers shame, is
wise.
Man is of such a nature, that he will be feared and douted, and cannot suffer
to be despised, nor to receive any sign of contempt. If it seem to him that
any labor to trouble him, he is straightwaies moved with anger and wrath, and
suddenly does show it by contentions, debates, strifes, and vprores, in
outrageous words and violent deeds. He boyleth so vehemently with
impatientie and fury, he has so great desire to be revenged for the
injury, that he persuades himself to be done unto him, that he loses al
boldness, and cannot dissemble his naughty stomach: and yet, it seems unto
him that he is mighty and strong, and that he behaueth himself as an honest
man, and that his heart is upright, because he suffers none to bite him,
neither to tread him under foot. But the holy Ghost does pronounce him to
be a fool by the mouth of Solomon, when he says, A fool in a day shal-be
known, etc. Saying, A fool in a day, he means not that the fool is
satisfied to have showed his anger and wrath for a little while, and afterward,
returns to be reconciled and to be friends again with them with whom he
was angry, as every one of us must do, in following the goodness of our
heavenly Father. For he endures but a while in his anger: but in his favor is
life. Psalm. 30. ^.


And for to follow him, we must obey Saint Paul. Be angry, but sin not,
etc. Again, Let all bitterness, anger Ephe. 4. 26. 31.
and wrath crying and evil speaking, be put away from you with all
maliciousness, etc. But he means that we must not dwell and abide long in
the company of a fool, for to know the wickedness of his heart: for as
soon as a man shall have removed but a straw without his will, without
purposing to offend him, he shows by injuries, ragings and violences, what
he is within. As Caine against Abel: Core, Dathan and Abyram against Moses:
Saul against David: the enemies of the truth against the children of GOD, not
only Number. 16.
amongst the Papists, but also there where they bragg of the reformation of
the Gospel. Also when he says, in a day, he means not that the fool
does spue forth all the poison of his heart in one day or in a little time.
Experience teaches us the contrary: for we see that from day to day the
wicked show themselves more furious against the faithful but he means that
they are easy and do suddenly show their impatiencie and fury.

In this Solomon does exhort us, that we would not be hastily angry,
except we would be counted fools: that is to say, contemners of GOD and of
his word, the which for to obey, and to fulfill, the humor of choler is not
fit, neither do they care also: and therefore Saint James does admonish us:
Let every man be swift to hear, and slow to anger. etc. We see here that
we ought highly to esteem, gentleness, softness, meekness, and
friendlinesse, when we would not that men should esteem us fools nor
contemners of God. If we be endued with such goodness, as that we would not
despise God, and labor also that he may not be despised, and that his name
should not be blasphemed by us, likewise we will easily dissemble and cover
the imperfections of our neighbors, and will not seek to make them a reproach,
neither to lay any fault to their charge, though they have offended us: and
shall be led and induced thus to govern ourselves by an holy wisdom and good
counsel. Solomon does teach us this same when he says,

But he that covers shame, is wise. That we must thus understand this
sentence, Solomon himself does show it, when against the knowledge of wrath,
he sets hyding or covering of shame: and against the fool, he sets the
wise man. And though the Antithesis be very propre, even according to man's
reason, yet Solomon speaks against the opinion and judgment of the world,
in both the parts of this Proverb. For first of al, the world esteems and
judges the heart of man to be upright and perfect, and not fearful nor
cowardely, if when he shows by wrath and anger, that he cannot bear, if
he feel himself grieved, and that he is ready, to revenge himself either
by word or by deed.

Secondarily, the world does not count this discretion or wisdom when a man
will dissemble or cover an offense, and that he is not quick to revile and
rage against him that has offended him, except he fly for to take the better
leap: that is to say, to seek to have him whom he judges to be his enemy
at his more advantage, and to handle him after his desire. Solomon speaks not
of such wisdom, which is rather set malice: but of the same whereby we bear
with our neighbor, and wish not to anger nor hurt him. This wisdom
proceeds of true charity, whereunto 1. Cor. 13. 4 Ephe. 4. 2. 32. and 5. 2.
Col. 3. 13. Mat. 5. 39. Romans 12. 14. 17. and 13. 4
we are exhorted. Let us therefore know that we are here admonished to fly
and eschew revenging of our own and private injury: as also our Lord does
teach us. But yet notwithstanding let us not think but that it is lawefull
for the faithful and Christians to exercise and execute the office of a
Magistrate and judge, in doing justice by wrath upon him that does evil.

17 He that speaks truth, will show righteousness: but a false witness
uses disceit.
There are many ways of speaking truth, though there be John. 14. 6. and 17.
17. Ephe. 4. 25.
not diverse truths, but one, which is God and his word, Our Lord does show
it, and therefore in what state soever we be, we must speak truth. Now
forasmuch as there are diverse states, it follows there are many ways of
speaking truth, the which may be gathered into four parts.

First of al, the Pastors of the Church, which are Ministers of the word of
truth, which above al other ought to profess truth, have their manner of
speaking truth by public and private preaching the pure Gospel, and by the
same to admonish, to reprove, to comfort, to chide and threaten and to make
afraid. Secondarily, Judges and Magistrates which ought to be righteous and
not falsely blamed, have their kind of speaking truth, when they pronounce
their sentences with desire of Exo. 18. 21. and 23. 1.
gifts, without regarding the person: but only according as matters shall be
duly and plainly proved, etc.

Thirdly, they which are called for witnesses, have their way of speaking
truth, when they plainly declare that which they know, and desire not to
slander nor flatter, nor to speak any thing that may hurt the good name of
their neighbor, neither to hurt him either in his body or in his goods, but
do labor to obey the commandementes of GOD written in Exodus the 20. chapter
and 23. chapter. Fourthly, the manner of speaking truth, in our common,
familiar and private talk, is that we should talk together of things and
matters even so as they are, and as we know them, without flattering and
slaundering, without affection of telling news, and without delighting to
consume and pass away the time in reasoning and babbling, as vain people
given to idleness and slothfulness: for it is very hard for such men to go
foreward in the truth: but must needs from the great vanity of their hearts
speak vain things, whose steps we may not follow: and therefore, must we
be sober in words, and also not to open our mouths, but to talk and commen
of things profitable and necessary, as of things which may serve to the
glory of GOD, and profit of our neighbors, and of those matters which
concern our state and vocation, etc. Lo, these are the manners the which we
must hold in speaking truth: unto the which if we be well given, we will
utter nothing that may redounde to the hurt of our neighbors, but will rather
procure that right may be done to them, and to render to every man that which
is his, without fraud or deceit. Solomon does signify the same, saying, He
that speaks truth, will show righteousness. The Ministers of the word do
well preach righteousness, when by their ministry they labor to turn us
away from al superstition and Idolatry, and from al iniquity and wickedness
(whereby the Devil does hold us captive under his tyranny) that they might
deliver us from the same, and by faith to make us partakers of the
righteousness of our Lord. The Magistrates do show forth righteousness,
when by their sentences and judgments, they render right to them to whom it
belongs, etc. The witnesses by their true depositions do show forth
righteousness: for so much as in them lies, they guide the judges, and show
them the way to minister justice. Also when in our familiar talk and
communication we continewe speaking of truth, we show forth justice: for
our words do tend neither to disceite nor hurt, but to do right,
pleasure, and service unto our neighbors.

Wherefore, let us understand that to speak truth, consists not only in
the mouth, but also in works. Solomon does well teach it us, when he
joins righteousness together with truth, and that afterward against
righteousness, he sets fraud: saying, But a false witness uses
disceite. As we have set four kinds of speaking truth, and to show
righteousness, so may we do the like in speaking of false witness, and in
woorking disceite. Besides this, let us learn that by this Antithesis or
against setting, Solomon does exhort us to have truth and righteousness in
great reverence, seeing that none of us would be counted liars nor deceivers,
etc.

18 There is that speaks words like the prickinges of a sword: but the
tongue of the wise man is health.
There is none of us that would be pricked or harmed, but do a^^ desire health
and do labor by all means possible to avoid all dangers and hurtes, and to
keep our bodies in good order and safety. Now if we have care of our bodies
which are not so excellent as our souls, by a more strong reason we must take
care of them, and to keep them that they be not pricked: but that they may
obtain health, and that therein they should continue and increase. For to
come to this, there are companies and feloweshippes that we must fly and
reject, and others that we must seek and keep. Solomon does well give us
this same to understand, when he says, There is that speaks words, etc.
Here by that, which he places the wise against him which speaks like the
prickings of a sword, we ought to know that if we will not be hurt, we
must beware of the foolish, for they are they which by their words are as
swords. There are diverse kinds of these fools which are very dangerous, as
are the wicked judges, and wicked magistrates, false witness bearers,
flatterers, liars, iesters, and such as abound in wanton words. The words
of such people do prick and smart after two sorts: that is to say, without
and within. If we do not consent with them, and do not become their familiar
acquaintance and friends, and at their commandment, do labor by their
wicked sentences, by their false witness bearings, by their wicked tales, and
by their iestings, and scornings for to hurt us, either in our goods or in our
bodies, or in our good name. And if we walk familiarly with them, they prick
us and sting us within, for they do what they can with their tongues to corrupt
us. Therefore Saint Paul does admonish us, saying, Be not deceived: evil
words corrupt good 1. Cor. 15. 33. 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 3.
manners. Again, he says, Be not unequally yoked with the infidels: for what
fellowship has righteousness, with unrighteousness? etc. He says again, But
fornication, and al uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named
among you, as it becomes saints, neither filthiness, neither foolish
talking, neither jesting, which are things not comely, but rather giving of
thanks. We learn then that we must fly such kind of people, and have no
acquaintance with them, if we would be preserved from inward hurt, which is
a more dangerous and sore wound then that without. Now if we must sever
ourselves from such folk, by a stronger reason, we must fly and reject false
Prophets and lying Doctors, which by sweet words and fair speeches do
deceive the hearts of the ignorant. The words of such people are so dangerous
and deadly, that Saint Paul warns Timothy, To stay profane, and ^. Tim. 2.
16.
vain babblings: for they shall increase unto more ungodliness. If it seemed
good to Saint Paul to be needful to admonish so excellent a disciple of
these things, by so much the more have we very great need to be warned
thereof. Of al these points we cannot take heed, but have need that the Lord
should keep and deliver us. The Psalmist does well show it us, when he is
Psalm. 57. 4.
so diligent to pray, My soul is amongst Lions: I lie among the children of
men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their
tongue a sharp swoorde. Again he says, and 64. ^.
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer, preserve my life from fear of the
enemy. Hyde me from the conspiracye of the wicked, and from the rage of the
woorkers of iniquity: Which have whet their tongue like a sword, and shot
forth their arrows, bitter words. Further, let us note that Solomon does
accuse such kind of men to be murderers, when he does attribute unto them
the prickings of a sword, and so consequently, he condemns them unto
eternal death. For it is said, You know that no manslear has eternal life
abiding in him. Therefore if we will not perish with them, let us soften our
tongues, and make them 1. John. 3. 15.
sound and healthful: the which we shall do, if renouncing foolishness, we
do follow the wise, and that by their wholesome doctrine, and good examples
we become wise: for as Solomon says,

But the tongue of wise men is health. As we commonly call those things whereby
we get and maintain corporal health, by the name thereof: even so Solomon
calls the tongue of the wise, health, because that if we use the same and
help us by it, we obtain an excellent health, and are kept therein. If we
be diligent to hear the wise, and also careful to follow their wholesome
doctrine, we shall have health, not temporal and bodily only, but our souls
shall be so healthful, that we shall never die. The tongue of the wise is of
such virtue, that whosoever shall help himself thereby in true faith and
repentance, it shall bring unto him eternal life: for it speaks the truth, it
brings forth the seed of life and everlasting health, as before in the
third chapter and first verse, unto the nienth: and the fourth chapter and 20.
verse, etc. The Psalmist does well show this same, when he Psalm. 119. 40
attributes quickening unto the word of the Lord. And our Lord Jesus
Christ does plainly declare it us, when he compares himself unto the
serpent, and does exhort us to believe in him. John. 3. 14.
Therefore if we desire health, let us often resort unto the sermons, for it
is said, Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Al
Christians according to the measure they have Romans 10. 17.
received, ought for to bring this health: but the Ministers of the word
above al others: for to them it is that the Lord has committed the Gospel,
after the which they bring wholesome doctrine. And therefore Saint Paul does
admonish Timothe to keep the true pattern of the wholesome words, etc.
Again, For a bishop 2. Tim. 1. 13. Tit. 1. 7. and. 2. 1.
must be unreprovable, as Gods steward, etc. But speak thou the things
which become wholesome doctrine. etc. Now forasmuch as amongst the Papists
there are no wise men, they are also destitute of health, etc. Moreover let us
note that although the world be filled with people which have great
appearance of wisdom, yet are there few in it that have healthful tongues.
Whereupon we may infer that wise men indeed are thick sown, and come but
thinly up. etc.

19 The lip of truth shall be stable for ever: but a lying tongue varieth
incontinently.
We would not be judged reedeshaken and carried with euerywinde, but counted
constant. And as we have this will, so must we be also indeed and truly,
least we be now of one mind, and immediately of another, except that having
been evil instructed before, and evil mouthed, we change our evil words into
good, after that by the grace of God we are informed. This changing does not
proceed of inconstancy, but of wisdom and good counsel. The Turks,
Papists, and other obstinate infidels and hardened in their superstitions and
idolatries, in their false religions and devotions, do think themselves very
constant, when they will in no wise be turned from them: but it is not in this
sort that we must count ourselves constant, but before that we may truly
brag thereof, we must first be armed and furnished inuiolably with truth.
that our hearts and minds may be so fastened and filled with so great
abundance that they might ouerflowe. Solomon does note it, saying, The lip
of truth. etc. The man that from the abundance of his heart speaks truth,
shall be so stable and constant, that he shall never turn therefrom: his lip
shall not start at a soden, and without good consideration but shall follow the
guiding of his heart and of his understanding. There are many which prate at
pleasure, holding true talk, but yet shall not have the lip of truth, as they
will show by their inconstancy, and that after diverse sorts: for some will
soon wax weary of holding good talk, and will turn over unto fables and
vanities: and other some fearring persecution, had rather hold their peace, or
to deny the truth, then to persevere in good and true words: and othersome will
pleasure a company of carnal and worldly people, and therefore if in any wise
they know that their company delight not in true and Christian talk, they
change and turn unto fables, and vain iangling. If such men had their tongues
of truth, they would remain steadfast without ever turning.

Truth is of such nature, that it never changes, otherwise it should not be
truth. It has this nature of God, who is unchangeable: and therefore as the
Psalmist says, The truth of the Psalm. 117. 2.
Lord indureth for ever. Again, There is no truth, but comes from him
only who is truth. Wherefore if he has once written this truethe in our
hearts, and that thereby we be truly renewed, we can never vary nor turn
from it. For the gifts and callings of God are without repentance: and so we
shall abide stable Romans 11. 29.
and constant for ever.

But for this constancy let us not boast ourselves of it, as though it came of
us, but with humbleness let us confess that it comes of God, as we may
here know it. First of al, because he attributes stabilitie unto truth,
the which we cannot have but of the only grace and liberality of God.
Secondarily, by that that he says not, it shall be stablished: but it shall be
stable. Thirdly, by this word forever: for man of himself has no permanent
and continual goodness. We must therefore ask steadfastness of God, Psalm.
51. 10. and. 12.
as David does, Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in
me: and in the 12. verse of the same Psalm, he says, Restore to me the joy of
thy salvation, and stablish me with thy free spirit. For they which have their
hearts infected with falsehood, dissimulation, and hypocrisy, are not stable,
but turn with every wind, and change their minds inco^tinently. If they have
made any promise, they do easily falsify their faith, eue^ for every vain
and light cause. etc. They will often speak traitorously, and unfaithfully unto
their neighbors, speaking one thing, and thinking another. They will flatter
and praise their neighbors before their faces, and behind their backs they
will slander them, and speak al evil they can of them. They will closly carry
false tales, and when they have kindled the fire, and that the matter is
disclosed, and that it is known to be by the^, they do shamelesly deny it. If
they have reported any good or naughty matter, and that they are therefore like
to come to trouble, they suddenly change their mind, and go back from that
which they have said. Behold the inconstancy and vnstabilitie whereunto the
hypocrites and liers are subject. Solomon does signific the same briefly, when
he says, But a lying tongue varieth, etc. As if he said, The man that out of
the wicked abundance of his heart is setteled in lying and hypocrisy, is
accustomed to lie with his tongue, and cannot be stable and sure: but easily
and suddenly does alter his purpose. For though Solomon does not express but
the tongue, yet notwithstanding he does accuse the heart, the which is made
manifest by the tongue, which of itself is not moved, but only so far as it
is guided by the heart. For from the abundance of the heart, the mouth
speaks. Naturally we are al such. For let God be Romans 3. 4.
true, and every man a liar. Wherefore if we will not be comprehended under this
accusation, let us follow the counsel of S. Paul, that is, That ye cast off,
concerning the conversation in time past, the old Ephe. 4. 22.
man, which is corrupt through the deceivable lusts. etc. Moreover, let us
note, that he which has the lip of truth, is steadfast, for his words are
true: they contain no repugnancie nor contrariety, but al agree well together:
but they which have a lying tongue, do often times speak words which are
contrary one to the other: and so do foully vary, sometimes through
forgetfulness, sometimes of set malice for to deceive and hurt.

20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counselors
of peace shall be joy.
If he which intends to hurt his neighbors, does proceed unadvisedly and
rashly to execute his enterprises, he is quickly discovered: and therefore it
is the more easy for a man to beware of him, and to defend himself. When the
wicked does openly show himself to be such as he is, without disguising
himself, if he be too mighty, men fly from him: and if he be weak, they
resist him. But contrarily, they which invent evil, and before that they bigin
to execute their enterprises, do deeply think thereupon, and do a long
while purpose in themselves how they shall come to the end, that their malice
may not willingly too soon be discovered, and that they be not hindered to put
in execution their displeasure, they disguise themselves, using fraud and
deceit, treason, and laying await, and so it is not easy for a man to take
heed of them, nor to resist them: but is constrained to suffer their wrongs
and violences, with great grief and mela^choliousnesse. Solomon does signify
this same, when he says, Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil.
As if he did say, it is a common and daily thing that they which imagine evil,
which will hurt and hinder their neighbors, do not at the first sight show
themselves such as they be in their hearts, but do use both words and deeds
clean contrary unto their thoughts and enterprises: as the devil has done
for to destroy men, and Judas for to murder our Lord Jesus, The Pope and his
shauelings have no less done for to destroy the Church of our Lord: and do
still continue at this day. But what deceit soever they bear in their hearts,
they cannot so much hurt as they would: for the Lord by the lamp of his
Gospel does give us light, and does show what their furies are, making us to
know their wickednesses: so that the Lord now fulfilleth that which is
said: and then shall the wicked man be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit 2. The. 2. ^.
of his mouth, and shall abolishe with the brightness of his coming. etc.
There are also other people which carry deceit in their hearts, as are
murderers: but the most dangerous deceit is that whereby trappes are laid for
souls, when in burdening them with the doctrines of men, they are made to
believe that in keeping the^, they hold the way to life: and thereby men are
brought to eternal death. We have said that when a man cannot take heed of
the deceites and treasons of the wicked, and that he is compelled to suffer
their injuries and violences, that they have invented maliciously, that it is
with grief and sorrow. Experience does show it, and Solomon does note it, when
against deceit he sets joy, saying: But to counselors of peace shall be joy.
And when he places the counselors of peace against them that imagine evil,
he shows that the imaginers of evil, so much as in them lies, do trouble
al, and set al things in disorder, making divisions and discordes, seditions,
and insurrections: the which things do cause great troubles and sorrows.
Contrarily, they which are given unto holy meditations, and good thoughts, and
have set their love upon the law of the Lord, studiyng therein day and night,
and in following this holy law, do labor Psalm. 1. 2.
to set peace in the world. Such people do not bring trouble nor sorrow,
but joy: not such as the carnal and worldlinges do bring, who cannot rejoice
except a man please and follow the affections of their flesh: and make an
account of no rejoicing, but when they flow over in all insolences and
dissolutions. But the counselors of peace do so rejoice them that receive
their counsel, that they are best content to see things in good order, that
they praise God, and give him thanks therefore, and have al their delight to
follow that which is showed unto them by the counselors of peace. To the end
then that we may be partakers of this joy, we must follow the counselors of
peace, which are chiefly the ministers of the Word, whereby they teach us to
be at peace with all men, and not only so, but also with God. Al things are of
God, who has reconciled Romans 12. 18. 2. Cor. 5. 18.
us unto himself by Jesus Christ. etc. By this ministry they make peace
between God and our consciences. We have also other counselors of peace,
that is to say, our Lords and governors, which watch over the government of the
common wealth, and make holy ordinances for to stop slanders, dissentions,
seditions and insurrections: that the people committed to their charge, may
live in peace. We must yield unto their laws, not only to the end that we
may avoid outward trouble, but also that we may have peace in our
consciences. S. Paul does signify the same, when he says, And Romans 13. 5.
therefore we must be subject not only for fear of wrath, but also for
conscience sake. We ought also al to be counselors one to another, every man
after his state and calling, so doing we shall have cause of joy: For the Lord
says, Blessed are the peace makers, for Mat. 5. 6.
they shall be called the children of God. This sentence might be understood
after another sort, that is to say, that as they which devise evil for their
neighbors, are given unto deceit and treasons: even so they which wish peace
unto their neighbors, are filled with joy, and are not vexed in mind, as they
are that invent malice: for against their wills, their conscience does
reprove them, and are in an horrible pain, albeit they labor to rejoice in
their wickedness, to the which they are given without grief, with an
unbridled lust. The counselors of peace are oftentimes tormented as well
without, as within, but yet they cease not to rejoice, and to have peace in
their consciences, knowing that they walk uprightly. etc.

21 There shall no iniquity come to the just: but the wicked are full of
evil.
It has been seen in all times, and yet still is seen, that the just are
persecuted as the wicked and ungodly: but Solomon does clear them from al
iniquity, contrary to the judgment of the world, when he says, There shall
none iniquity come to the just Wherein at the first sight he seems to speak
against the Scripture. Who can bring a clean thing out of filthiness? there
is none. What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is borne of Job.
14. 4* and. 15. 14. Pro. 20. 9. Eccle. 7. 22. John. 3. 6. Romans 3. 22
woman, that he should be just? Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am
clean from my sin? Surely there is no man just in the earth, that does good
and sins not. That which is borne of flesh, is flesh. For there is no
difference: for all have sinned, and are deprived of the glory of God. etc. Or
at leastwise, if he do not against say the Scripture, it seems that there is
none that is righteous. Al are gone out of the way: they are al corrupt: there
is Psalm. 14. 3. Mat. 6. 12. 1. John. 1. 8.
none that does good, no not one. We are commanded al to pray for the
forgiveness of our sins. If we say we have not sinned, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Now sin comes of none but of us.
Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence, and is
entised. It Iam. 1. 14.
seems then at the first sight, that he should against say the scripture, or
of his saying it might be inferred that there is none righteous, and that the
first part of this sentence is pronounced in vain. The answer is, that
Solomon speaks not of man as he is borne of man: for in the same nature he
is altogether destitute of justice: but he speaks of man as he is regenerated
by the spirte of GOD, by whom he is so ordered and guided, that he abhors
al iniquity, and delights in goodness, and does give himself thereto so
much as he can. For this cause, though whiles he lives in this body, he has
still some relikes of corruption, and that sin dwells in him: Romans 7. 14.
yet because that the seed of God is in him, he delights in the law of God.
Solomon does impute none iniquity unto him, but does purge him thereof: as
does S. John also, He that is borne of God, 1. John. 3.
sins not, etc. And this is not without cause: for inasmuche as Christ by
his spirit and his word, dwells in us, sin is abolished in us, and yet for
the principal part we are counted just, and to live justly, because that with a
pure affection, we aspire unto righteousness. And albeit that through the
infirmity of our flesh we often fall, yet is it said, that we work none
iniquity, that we do not sin, because we do not consent unto sin, but
rather in weeping, we resist and fight against sin, so that we may truly
witness with S. Paul, That we do the evil we would not do: for this cause also
it is not imputed Romans 7. 19. and. 8. 1.
unto us, neither are we condemned for it. This is not to say, but that we
should confess ourselves truly to be sinners, and continually to ask
forgiveness of our sins: as Jesus Christ has ordained unto al his Church.
Although then that none iniquity come to the just, yet Psalm. 32. 1. Romans 4. 7.
the just is not he that has no sin, but he to whom God will not impute it.
Wherefore, for to make us certain that we are of the number of the righteous,
let us aspire unto well doing in soundness and integrity of conscience,
praying unto the Lord, Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me. Contrarily, Psalm. 51. 10.
as touching that which has bin said at the beginning, that the wicked are
honored and beloved of the world, as if they were honest men: yet Solomon does
deprive them of al justice, when he says, but the wicked are full of evil.
When Solomon exempteth the just from al iniquity, and that contrarily, he
attributes unto the wicked, fullness of evil; he declares that the wicked
do purpose and determine nothing but to do evil, and to hurt. And albeit
that in some places they make a goodly show of justice and holiness, as in their
alms, fastings, and prayers, yet from the abundance of their evil, they
corrupt and defile al: Unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is
pure, but even their minds and Tit. 1. 15.
consciences are defiled. This sentence thus considered, we may gather of the
promise and threatening that Jesus Christ pronounces, They that have done
evil, shall go unto the resurrection of condemnation. Ioh. 5. 29.
And thus Solomon by this sentence does exhort us unto righteousness, and does
labor to turn us away from wickedness: but there are very few which make any
account thereof: and as we see by experience, we may well complain with the
Prophet Esai, Esai. 59. 6. and 14.
their works are wicked works, and the work of cruelty is in their hands:
Therefore judgment is turned backward, and justice stands far of: for
truth is fallen in the street, and equity can not enter.

22 The lying lips are an abomination to the Lord: but they that deal
truly, are his delight.
Lying has always liked men, as appears, there where we may see, that man
rather believed the Devil father of lying, then obeyed Genesis 3. 6.
God. And as he was easy to believe lies, even so gave he himself to speak
the same with his mouth, and to do it also by work, in following his father
and master the Devil: and so made himself the enemy of God, who is the
father of truth, even truth it self. But albeit that man does delight to lie,
so that it is not without cause that the Scripture says, that al men are
liers: yet his conscience does reprove him therefore, and causes him to
judge that Psalm. 116. 1^
it is wickedly done of man for to lie: as it is manifest by two arguments. The
first is, that there is none that would have any man to lie unto him: and also
we say, that a lier is worse then a thief, because we can not so well take
heed from a lier, as from a thief. The second argument is, That we ourselves
would not be counted liars: and if any man belie us, we are by and by provoked
unto anger: and if we be able, we are ready to strike and to kill them that
belie us. We naturally then understand, that it is great wickedness for to
lie: but for to make us yet more excusable, (except we follow this natural
light,) the Lord has given us his law by writing, the which says, Thou shall
bear no false witness, etc. Also let us Exo. 20. 16.
follow the instruction of S. Paul, Put away lying, and speak every man
truth to his neighbor, etc. Let not whoredom nor any other uncleanness be
once named amongst you. etc. Thus doing, we shall be acceptable unto God, as
Solomon does pronounce it, saying, But they that deal truly, are his delight.
When Solomon is not contented to say, which speak truth: but says, that
deal truly: he shows us that truth does not lie only in word, but also
indeed and works, that are done so faithfully and with such truth, that we
fear not though they be examined, seen, and known. Our Lord does well show
it. Now this is condemnation, Ioh. 3. 19.
that light is come into the word, and men love darkness more then light. And
when he sets to deal truly, against lying lips, we know thereby that
lying is also in fained and counterfeit works, the which have their color
and disguising for lips. For it is as much as if they did brag to be good
and lawful. Whosoever shall sell a counterfeit work or merchandise, though he
say nothing, yet cease he not to lie: for he sets it to sale, and sells
it also as dear as he can. Contrarily, they that work truly, though they be
dumb, yet are they true, and work truth, the which God loves, and the^ that
work it: as Solomon does signify, when he says, They are his delight. Herein
we have the promise of life enclosed and contained: for it follows well, if we
please God, we can not perish.

23 Awise man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of the fools publishes
foolishnes.
Solomon attributes suttletie, that is to say, counsel and wisdom unto the man
that keeps secret his knowledge: but when we are not borne for ourselves
only, and that God does not communicate his graces unto us, for to use them
for ourselves, without helping our neighbors: it seems at the first sight
that Solomon should attribute malice and unthankfulness unto him that hides
knowledge, and not suttletie, except we call him subtle, which has the cunning
to deceive and to beguile his neighbors, and to make his profit by the hurt
of others. Knowledge ought not to be kept secret, as Solomon himself has
showed before, in the first Chapter, 20. verse. and in diverse other places,
where he exhorts us unto hearing. God also has well showed, when he has
raised up so many Prophets for to teach his people of Israel. Our Lord Jesus
Christ does teach us likewise, Ye are the light of Mat. 5. 14. and 10. 27. and
28. 19.
the world, etc. That which I tell you in darkness, do you preach on the
house top, etc. Go and teach al people, etc. I answer, that it is
notlawful for man to hold his knowledge so secret, that he should make no man
partaker thereof: and also it is not the mind of Solomon to allow such kind of
doing. And therefore that we may perfitly understand this present saying of
Solomon, let us know that he speaks by comparison, setting the modesty and
temperancie of awise and discrete man, against the insolency and excess of
the foolish, that has neither manner nor measure in their sayings nor in
their walking, but are full of boasting and ostentation. They would be seen and
praised in things that are vain and nothing worth: as Solomon does signify,
saying, that the heart of the fools publishes foolishnes. The mind then of
Solomon is Mat. 7. 6.
to show that the wise man, for all the knowledge he has, will rather hold
his peace, and keep silence, then to give any sign of ostentation and
boasting either in his words or works. He will mark both the time and a fit
occasion for to bestow his knowledge: and also he will consider with what
people he has to do: and according as he shall know to be expedient, he will
employ his knowledge in utterance and in doing what he can for the honor of
God, and profit of his neighbors: or if it be ne^eful will abstain. Give not
those things that are holy unto dogs, etc. The Ministers of the word are
chiefly they that ought to conceal knowledge, and to take good heed of saying
or doing any thing by ostentation: for they are sent of Christ for to preach
the Gospel, not in wisdom of words that the cross of Christ should be
made vain. And 1. Cor. 1. 17. and. 2. 1. 2. Cor. 2. 17.
so they ought to follow the modesty of Paul, who says, And I brethren,
when I came, and that they may say, Truly we are not many etc. And as for
such is the duty of ministers, even so also they that are taught by them, ought
not to affect for to show that they learned much, and are very well learned:
but must (following the Iam. 1. 18
doctrine of Saint James) being begotten by the word of truth, and not of
ourselves, but of the proper will of God) be swift to hear, and slow to
speak. But notwithstanding let us not be slow to speak, that we should
not teach our housholdes, and family, and also our neighbors, where
necessity should require for of the gifts that God has given us, we must
make our neighbors partakers, Every one as he has received. And that not
only in words, but in works: lest we be like them, who when they 1. Pet. 4.
10
know any art or science, would have none to know it but themselves: they
will not gladly teach it to others, and do envy them that do know it. Let us
not I say, be like such people, but without desiring ostentation, let us make
our neighbors partakers with us of the benefits, gifts, and graces that we
have received of God: so doing, we shall be wise, and shall conceal knowledge,
and shall not follow fools, who having their hearts puffed up with pride and
arrogancy, with ambition and vain glory, do desire to be seen: but because
they are deprived of good and true wisdom, and have not the knowledge of God,
they do bring forth of their hearts, nothing but folishnesse, and do show
openly that there is nothing in them but foolishness, as though they
proclaimed it by sound of trumpet, for to make it known to all: and yet make
themselves believe that they are very subtle and wise, and would be counted
such. The Pope is the prince of such fools, as we may know by his traditions,
and by his conversation. For the heart of the foolish does not only lead the
tongue, but also all the members of the body. The Nichodemites do think to be
subtle, to be wise and very discrete, to wit, when they hold their peace for
fear of persecution: but their hearts do well preach foolishnes, when by
outward conversation they conform themselves, and become like unto the wicked.

24 The hand of the diligent shalbeare rule: but the idle shall be under
tribute.
The Princes and great Lords of the earth are naturally led with a desire to
rule, so that they may command others, and no man to have authority for to
command any thing: that they may gather subsidies, imposts, custom and
tributes of others, and themselves to be wholly exe^pted. And as they desire
such things, so are they granted 1. Sam. 8. 11 Romans 13. 5. 6. Wisd. 6. 4.
Iosu. 16. 10. and 17. 13.
the^, and given the^ of God. Nevertheless have they not al enjoyed this grant,
neither yet do they al enjoy it. We have seen in our time, and do still see
it, that kings in captivity do pay great raunsomes: likewise great Lords to be
captives, and free Cities to be in bondage. This same came to pass, and
comes commonly to pass for want of heed and diligence, as experience does
teach it. If 2. Sam. 8. 1. 2. Kings. 18. 10. and 25. 6. Deuteronomy. 4. 28.
then Kings, Princes, and Lords, would enjoy the gift and grant of God, let
them not give themselves to idleness and sloth, unto negligence and carelesnes,
to vanity and pleasures, unto voluptuousnes and sportes: but let them watch,
let them labor with great care and with all diligence, and to do that which is
their duty and office. Thus doing, they shall rule, as does Solomon signify,
in saying, The hand of the diligent shalbeare rule: but it will be demanded,
whether it be lawful for them that are diligent, to desire to bear rule. I
answer, That they which are not placed in high dignity, ought to walk in
such humility, that they may say with the Psalmist, O Psalm. 131. 1.
Lord, I have no high heart, neither high looks, etc. And that they may truly
protest so, they must follow the doctrine of our Lord and master, Whosoever will
be the greatest amongst you, let him be Mark. 1. 10. 43. Luke 22. 25. John. 6.
15.
your servant. The Kings of the nations, etc. And also let them follow his
example, as he sets before us in the places before alleged: and when he
refused to be a King. But the Kings, Princes, and governors of the earth,
which have the pre-eminence, and are ordained of God for to rule and reign, if
they be diligent to do their office, they may desire to bear rule, not cruel
and tyrannical, as do they that use their corrupt and disordered will for reason
and law: but they may desire to bear authority, whereby they may serve to
the glory and honor of God, unto rest and quietness, unto the edification and
salvation of their subjects. For it is needful that the people should fear,
reverence, and honor their Lords, rendering to the^ obedience in all things,
without any co^tradiction or murmuring, but that peaceably, with all humblenes,
they should submit themselves unto the ordinances, statutes, and
commandementes of their Lords, not only in such things as concern the
honor of God rightly, but also in them which belong unto common peace, and to
the order of policy: and that the superiors also should be diligent to
execute the judgments of God as the scriptures of God do instruct them. When
the Lords shall thus work, it shall be Exodus 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 17. 16. 2. Chro. 19.
6. Psalm. 82. 3.
lawful for them to desire domination: and indeed also they shall obtain it,
according to this promise, the which is infallible. The hand of the diligent
shalbeare rule. The same has bin fulfilled in many good Magistrates, Judges,
and Kings, as the Scripture does witness of Moses, of Joshua, of Gedeon, of
Joseph, of Sampson, of David, of Ezekias, and of Josias. But what domination
soever diligent Lords have and do obtain, yet is it not without
contradiction, as experience does show it. Yet it is not to say, but that God
is true in his promises (as we must esteem it) and what diligence soever they
take in doing of their duty, yet is it never such, but that therein is much to
be amended. And for this cause, there are no Lords but do well deserve to meet
with much contradiction. Yet it is not to say, that God does not perform his
promise, so far as is expedient, and that it is not necessary that Lords
should punish their gain saiers. It belongs not unto subjects to withstand
that which is well ordained: though they which ordeine them, be not such as they
ought Romans 13. 4.
to be. And though it should so be, that in doing their duty perfectly, the
Lords should have contradiction: nevertheless we must in no wise doubt of
this promise: for God fails not to accomplish 1. Pet. 2. 18
it, so far as he knows to be expedient, though we see it not always. And
as the Princes that are careful and diligent, do bear rule: even so every
one of us, according to his estate, shall rule, if he labor to follow his
vocation. But contrarily as says Solomon, The idle hand shall be under tribute.
They that are negligent to give their duty, must needs be slaves and as
captives, subject to ransomes, Impostes and Subsides: as experience shows it.

25 Heaviness in the heart of man does bring it down: but a good word
rejoices it.
When a man daily works, and that it seems to him that he busieth himself
in vain, or that he receives not so great profit as he desires,
complayningly he says gladly, that he is so weary with laboring, that he
grows crooked therewith: signifying thereby that he is not without care and
sorrow, and is not contented with the profit that God sends him daily,
because he fears to dye for hunger, and (by a kind of speech) fears lest
the earth will fail him. Thus speaking, he shows well, that he would not
willingly be crooked, and that it is a thing very noisome. If we will avoid
such trouble, and not to wax crooked, we must give ourselves every one of us
to follow our state without heaviness. For as Solomon says, Heaviness in the
heart of man does bring him down. When man takes care excessiuely, and
without measure, with great actiuitie, he sets his heart in a miserable
state, he does deprive it of al joy and delight, of al peace and quietness, as
if he fell underneath his burden, without being able to rise again. Solomon
here does not labor to turn man away from his daily labor, according as is
meet for his vocation: otherwise he should contrary himself: for he
says, Go slouthful to the Emmet, and mark his ways, etc. An idle hand
makes poor, etc. He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread. But
he labors to root out 1. Tim. 6. 10.
of our hearts the root of al evil, which is covetousness, the which whilst
some have desired, they have erred from the Faith, and have entangled
themselves with many sorows. Amongst other sorrows, covetousness causes the
heart of man to be laden with heaviness, the which is so heavy a burden,
that it brings him down, so that all his thoughts and desires are upon the
goods of the earth, and can not aspire up unto heaven, where Jesus Christ
would have us to lay up our treasure. For to follow well these exhortations of
our Mat. 6. 20. Hebr. 13. 5
Lord, we must ask our daily bread, and to be contented therewith. Let your
conversation be without covetousness. If in steed to yield unto this holy
exhortation we vex ourselves, and do distrust the help of God, it is a true
argument that the word of God does not live in our hearts: as also Solomon
does signify it presently, setting a good word against heaviness, and joy unto
crookednes: saying, But a good word rejoices it. For to put away heaviness
from the heart, Solomon sends us to hear the preaching of the word of God,
and not flatteries and sweet words of men, the which, albeit that for a little
time they seem to recreate and rejoice man, and do deliver him from
heaviness, yet the same is of no continuance: but the joy that comes of
men's words, does quickly vanish away, and so is not true, as also their words
are not truly good. For as there is none but God that is good, even so also
there is nothing but his only word good, and that gives true and continual
Psalm. 19. 9.
joy to the heart. Now as we call a thing good, when it does nothing hurt, but
does profit, and chiefly when it serves our necessary uses: even so,
Solomon calls the word of the Lord good, because that it does nothing hurt
the children of God, though it does rebuke them, chide, threaten and fear
them, making them to feel the horriblenes and heaviness of their sins, and
does set before them the judgment of God, whereupon comes to them great
sorrow, when they see themselves so poor and so miserable. For albeit that they
are greatly sorrowful, yet is the same so far of, that the word which leads
them unto this sorowfulnes, does hurt them, that rather it is healthful for
them. For though I made you sorrowful by mine Epistle, yet do I not repent me,
etc. ^. Cor. 7. 8.
because ye sorowed unto repentance. If then we receive the word in fear, it
shall not hurt us, but greatly profit us: not for one time only, but for ever.
And since that the children of the world do rejoice at a temporal profit, by a
stronger reason the word of the Lord ought to give occasion unto the faithful
for to rejoice, when the same brings them unto eternal life, that every one
of us may say with David, I have delighted in thy law. Also, Thy testimonies
have been my delight, etc. It comes not from ourselves that we Psalm. 114. 14
24.
have this delight, and therefore the Psalmist prays, Lord teach me the way
of thy statutes. Although then that the covetous do Psalm. 119. 33.
often walk with a stiff neck, and that they seem to be joyful, yet have
they a crooked heart, and have no true rejoicing. Even so, if we will be
delivered from heaviness, and obtain joy, we must receive the law which
does advertise us of our sin, for to repent therefore: and we must cleave
fast unto the promises, and stay ourselves thereupon, for to assure us of the
remission of our sins and of eternal life.

26 The righteous is more excellent then his neighbor: but the way of the
wicked will deceive them.
Whilst we are in this world, albeit that God does give us this grace that we
conform not ourselves unto the world, neither are of the world, yet must we
dwell with them which are of the world, and think them our neighbors, even
though we know that they are nothing worth. Solomon does somewhat signify it,
when he says, The righteous is more excellent then his neighbor. But when he
speaks thus, his chief in tent is, not to make us to understand the same,
but to turn us away from the prosperity of the wicked. For Solomon does set
himself against the common opinion of men which judge them excellent, that have
their scope and course in abundance Psalm. 37. 1
of riches, and great credit, and that take their ease and pleasures in this
life. For by this that they do their business well, and bring their purposes
and enterprises to pass, the world esteems them excellent personages.
Contrarily, Solomon does here pronounce, that albeit the righteous seems to
be a man of nothing, woeful and unprofitable, yet that he is excellent, by
this, that whatsoever does happen to him, he goes not out of the right way. He
sets the excellency of the righteous in his patience and constancy: as he
does show it, when he says consequently: But the way of the wicked will
deceive them. Here the way of the wicked is taken for that which they are, and
does happen unto them: for not knowing themselves, and seeing their
prosperity, credit, and power, they make themselves believe that al things
are lawful for them: and therefore they live in all dissolution. They forsake
the way of salvation, and take the broad way which leads to destruction. Mat.
7. 13.
And that we should not go astray, we are warned for to enter by the
straight gate. If then we will find excellency, let us not stay ourselves
with the great number, nor with them that are most esteemed after the world,
but let us convert with the small number and most contemned. Now the righteous
in this point is said to be excellent, for the gifts and graces of God, by
the which he is led and governed so well that he erreth not, but keeps the
right way of salvation and eternal life. That we must so understand it, Solomon
does show it us, when against excellent he sets the way that leads to
error. For because that the wicked are void of al gifts, as they deserve,
they can not well guide themselves, whatsoever they have, or that happens
them, but al things are a stumbling block unto them, an hinderance,
overthrow, and destruction: as Solomon does give it well to understand, when
he says, that the way of the wicked makes them err. And it has always bin
that this has befall them. The wicked are strangers from the womb: even from
the belly have they erred, and speak lies. And albeit Psalm. 58. 3.
that the wicked deserve to walk in error, yet it is not to say, that the
just can deserve to be excellent: for, as it has been already said, he is
esteemed excellent, not for any thing he has of himself: for all gifts come
from the pure liberality of God. Solomon Ioh. 3. 27. and 15. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 4.
7. Iam. 1. 17.
also does signify it, when he does not attribute to man that he is
excellent. True it is, that man in his first creation was made excellent, when
he was created and formed unto the image and likeness of God: but he lost
his excellency by transgressing of God his commandment, and by the
inventions that followed thereupon. I considered in mine heart the state of the
children of men, that God had purged them: yet to see too, they are in
themselves as beasts. God made man right, but they sought many inue Eccle. 3.
18 and 7. 30.
ntions. Also, as is said, Solomon does not attribute unto man that he is
excellent, but to the righteous: he says not Man is excellent: but the
righteous is more excellent, etc.

In this sort he attributes excellency unto man, inasmuch as he is just: the
which he is not in himself, but in Jesus Christ. Let us note besides this,
that Solomon does not pretend to attribute unto the wicked any excellency,
though he say more excellent: but he speaks also for to repugne and gainsay
the opinion of the world, which rejects, disdaineth, and persecuteth the
righteous: as Saint Paul does describe it in his person, Truly I think,
that God has set forth us the last Apostles, as men appointed to death: 1.
Cor. 1. 30. 2. Cor. 3. 21.
for we are made a gazing stock unto the world, and to the Angels, and to
men. And contrarily, the world has the wicked in wonderment, reuerencing and
honoring them. And this is as much as if he did say, If I grant unto you
that they which ye esteem, have some excellency, yet I would have you to
understand, that it is as nothing in comparison of the excellency of the
just, whom 1. Cor. 4. 9.
ye abhor. And thus a man might well say, that Solomon speaks as it were
by Concession. Moreover, let us note, that the faithful and just that are
counted before God of great excellency, are here admonished not to
communicate in any wise with the filthiness 2. Cor. 6. 14.
of the wicked: as also Saint Paul does exhort them.

27 The deceitful man rosteth not that he took in hunting: but the riches of
the diligent man are precious.
Solomon does exhort us by this sentence unto care and diligence, that we
should not suffer that to be lost which we possess, but knowing that it is
God which gives us that that we have, be it little or much, that we should
make great account thereof, and to preserve the same for to use when we have
need. Now for to induce us theretoo, and to turn us from slouthfulnes, he
compares the slouthful unto an hunter: but not in all things. For the slouthful
Pro. 6. 9.
sleeps, and makes no account to occupy himself in labor and travail, as
Solomon has reproved him else where: contrariwise the hunter is watchful and
with great care and diligence he considers the means whereby he may come
unto the end to take some piece of flesh: he pitcheth his toils and his
nets, he trimmeth his pitfals, he goes and runs up and down according as
he sees needful to pursue the pray, that it may not escape from him. But it
happens that the hunter which is indiscreet and takes no heed, after he
has taken the veneson, knows not how to trim and dress it, for to
preserve it from corruption, that he may make thereof his profit. And in this
sort it is that Solomon compares the slouthful unto the hunter: as he does
show it, when he does say, The slothful man rosteth not that he took in
hunting. He calls the hunting of the slouthful not that which he has got by
his labor and travail: for the slouthful refuses to labor: as it is but too
much proved, and Solomon has already showed it and will show it hereafter:
but the hunting of the slouthful are the goods that are come to him by the
labor of other, the which he possesses by right of succession, or by gift,
or by theft, polling and briberie. Forasmuch as the slouthful will not occupy
himself for to get his living by honest labor, and that he cares not to
busy himself about good works, he is often compelled to ravish the goods
of his neighbors: and albeit that to do the same, he watches and takes great
pains, yet cease not he to be slouthful: for that which he does, is done
for nothing else, but to avoid the labor that God has appointed, and to
enjoy the pleasures of the body with the hurt and hinderance of his neighbors.
Such slouthful are the most dangerous after the outward appearance, and also
after the judgment of the flesh but their bellies, whereof S. Paul speaks,
are yet worse: for living ydlely and slouthfully, they do not only rauishe the
temporal goods, and do not only kill the Romans 16. 18. Phi. 3. 19. Tit. 1. 10.
body: but in so much as in them lies they pull away the souls from God, and
give them to be devoured of the Devil: of the which number are the Pope and al
his, whom a man may well curse, after the example of Jesus Christ, Woe be to
you, ye Scribes and Pharisees Mat. 23. 13.
hypocrites: for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven before men: for neither ye
yourselues enter in, nor suffer them that would to enter therein. Al such
people shall not roste that they took on hunting: they take no profit of that
which they have gotten by gain and dishonestie: for either they spend the
same unprofitably, or it is taken from them, or else they are compelled to
leave the same without having any use thereof. This same is proved, and we have
some Luke. 12. 20. and 15. 13. and 16. 23. Ephe. 4. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 7.
examples thereof. Now that we may not be of the number of such people, let
us follow the counsel of Saint Paul, let him that stole, steal no more: and
also, so much as we possibly can, follow his example. Thus doing, we shall not
loose that which we took in hunting, for want of rosting: but that which we
have taken we shall keep it diligently, and shall hold it dear and precious,
as Solomon does signify it saying,

But the riches of the diligent man are precious. It seems well unto the
covetous and usurers which take great pain to gather treasures in this world,
that they hold their riches for very precious, when they dare not use their
treasures for fear to diminish them: and then it seems that in thus doing,
they keep and preserve them well, and make no small account of them. But since
God has created al things that they should be occupied for the use of man,
we should know that then our riches are precious unto us, when we make them
serve according as God has ordained them. For so doing, we suffer them not to
go to loss, but do keep them together. We should esteem a thing well kept,
when it is applied where it ought to be, and that it serves and profits.
They then that are almose giuers and charitable, have their riches precious:
for they do well bestow it and put it forth to good profit, Give, and Luke.
6. 38. 1. Tim. 6. 17.
it shall be given to you: Command them that are rich in this world, that they
be not high minded.

28 Life is in the way of righteousness: and in that pathway there is no death.
Forasmuch as there is none but desires to live, and to fly death, except it
be for great sorrow that he suffers, he do desire death, not preferring and
choosing it before life, but for the afflictions that he bears: and except
he were impatient, and did despair to be exempted from such sorrows in this
world, he would desire life, and abhor death, as indeed he does: for being in
his straights, he thinks himself to be in a death more hard the^ if his soul
were separated from his body. That we may obtain our desires, we must know
where life is found without the danger of death: Solomon does teach us it,
when he says, Life is in the way of righteousness, etc. When any man has need
to make a voyage, and understands that the high way is dangerous, for thieves
and robbers that watch who come by, he will not take that way if he may avoid
it by any means, but seeks some path that will bring him to the place where he
would be: and so he lives and auoideth death, whereof he had been in danger
if he had passed by the high way. We are Pilgrims Hebr. 13. 14
in this world. For we have here no continual dwelling City, etc. In
following then the Faith of Abraham and of other holy Patriarchs, dwelling in
this world, we shall walk as strangers, looking for Hebr. 11. 10
the City, that has a sure foundation. So doing, God will not be ashamed to be
called our God. For to accomplish this voyage, and to come to this City, we
must take good heed from taking the Mat. 7. 13.
high way, for it leads to damnation, because it is full of thieves, robbers,
and filchers, which seek for nothing but our destruction: As our lusts, the
world, and the Devil do draw us, and lay baits 1. Pet. 4. 3 Ioh. 3. 3. 1.
Cor. 6. 9 Romans 6. 23 Gal. 5. 21. Mat. 7. 13. Hebr. 12. 1 1. Pro. 2. 1
for us, that delighting in the pleasures of the heathen, that know not God,
we should walk dishonestly. So doing, we can not find life. The reward of
sin, is death: but we must seek for a straight pathe that may lead us unto
life. And for to run well therein, let us lay away all that presses us down,
and putting away al malice, let us abstain from carnal lusts, which fight
against the soul. If we thus walk, we shall find life; for that way is the
path of righteousness, wherein, as Solomon says, is life, and no death therein.
When Solomon took his doctrine from the law, whereunto it is lawful for no
man to add, or diminish, we must understand that he speaks Deuteronomy. 4. and 5.
and 8. 2. Cor. 1. 20,
here of eternal life chiefly.

For albeit that God by Moses gave unto the children of Israel, promises
concerning this temporal life (as nevertheless seeing that God does esteem
none but his children, whom he has erected to eternal life, worthy of his
promises, for all his promises are yea and Amen in Christ) we must understand,
that in these temporal and earthly promises are enclosed the heavenly and
spiritual: as the Fathers Hebr. 11. 9. 10* 13. Leu. 18. 5. Romans 10. 5.
did well understand, and also Moses does signify the same, saying, The
which if a man shall do, he shall live in them: the which Saint Paul expounds
of eternal life. Then when Solomon says, Life is in the way, etc. Let us
understand it of the blessed and eternal life: as he himself declares it,
saying, And in that path way there is no death. For temporal life is not
without death, as experience teaches always, and the Scripture witnesses
unto us: I say unto you brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the
kingdom 1. Cor. 15. 50. Hebr. 9. 29
of God. Men are appointed once to dye. We must also take death here, for
eternal death: as does our Lord Jesus, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he
which hears my word, is passed from death unto life. If any man keep my
word, he shall not see death. Ioh. 5. 24. and 8. 51. 11. 25.
Whosoever believes in me though he were dead, yet shall he live. If then we
will live without death, let us walk in the path of righteousness, as we are
taught by the Scriptures aforesaid. The which shall be done, if having the
assured hope of our salvation in the righteousness of our Lord, we give
ourselves to live after his commandments contained in his law. There is no
death. For albeit the righteous are the most that are slain, yet they dye not,
but do pass from death unto life.

The xiii, Chapter.
1 A wise son will obey the instruction of his father: but a scorner will hear
no rebuke.
FOrasmuch as instruction consists in commandments, counsels, exhortations,
corrections and reprehensions, whereof the rude, simple and ignorant have need,
and not they that are indewed with so much wisdom as they need, and ought to
have: and live according thereto before the world, and walk so wisely that
they are without reprehension, and have no need that any man should show them
any thing: We understand not by the wise Son, a man having wisdom
premeditated (for such a man has no need that his father should show him,
either reprove or correct him) but by a wise son we will understand him that
humbles himself unto his father, fears and reuerenceth him, will receive
doctrine, and endeavors to serve him, and to be at his commandment. This
son is wise, though there be in him many things which require either
admonitions, exhortations, or corrections. Albeit then that we have many
imperfections, yet do we not cease therefore to be called wise by the
Scriptures, which lie not, so that we confessing ourselves to be such as we
are, do become easy to be Rom 13. 7. Ephe. 4. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13
taught and tractable, and endeavor to yield subjection and obedience, fear
and honor to them that we ought, following the counsel of S. Paul, Give unto
every man that which is due to him, etc. So doing, we shall be wise sons, and
will take instruction of them to whom we are committed, and to whom we owe
honor and obedience. As then we see, Solomon calls children and inferiors
unto wisdom, that the youth and the common people should not take license to
remain in ignorance, as though wisdom did nothing belong to them. For gladly
such people are wont to say, that they need not to be so wise, and they think
that wisdom is not necessary for the^, but for men in authority and dignity.
He does also exhort the^ to receive instruction of the father: under the which
name of father, let us understand al such as we owe obedience and honor unto:
but as they make no account of wisdom, even so do such people commonly hate
instruction, though it be necessary for them. It is too common a vice, that
things most necessary are most despised in the world: there is almost none but
fears to be either too wise or too honest: wherein they are like to children:
who according as they are borne of flesh, do love that which is not good for
them. Now though we must be like unto little children: yet when we are here
called to be wise, and to receive instruction, Mat. 18. 3
let us follow the admonition of S. Paul, Brethren, in understanding be not
children: but in malice let us be children; Take heed 1. Cor. 14. 20 Ephe. 5.
15 1. Pet. 2. 1
therefore that ye walk circumspectly, etc: putting away al malice, etc. If we
make no count of such instructions, we are not wise: but scorners, as Solomon
does show us, saying, But a scorner will hear no rebukes. Wisdom has
complained here above, (Chaper. 1. verse 22.) and for their refusal, has
threatened them afterward, verse, 24. By this sentence and other already
alleged, and Chap. 9. verse, 7. 8. we may understand that scorners are proud,
wicked, corrupted, hardened, and incorrigible. Such people labor to make
themselves believe Esai. 28. 15
that what evil soever does happen, they shall be exempted. And therefore they
scorn al reprehension. It is not to say that they are assured for their
conscience, in spite of their teeth will reprove them: whereupon they are
feared with the judgment of God. They show themselves very bold, as if they
were in great assurance: but the wicked are as the raging of the sea, etc.
There is no peace to the wicked, says God. Besides this, let us note first of
al, that scorners have Esai. 57. 20
ears, but they hear not: they are of the number of them of whom Esai
speaks, Go and say to this people, hear and understand not, see and know
not, etc. The number of them is very great, as we Esai. 6. 9
may gather by the similitude of the seed. Secondly, that they which have
charge of others, ought to be vigila^t and careful to give instruction, every
one after his state and vocation: and for to do the same well, they themselves
ought to be learned. We must first be scholars, before we become masters. They
then which never made account and esteemed instruction, are not capable nor
meet to have authority over others.

2 A man shall eat good things by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the
trespassers shall suffer violence.
It is said, you shall bring your burnt offeringes, etc. Thou shall pay thy
tenth. etc. Eue^ so we see that the Lord sought no profit Deuteronomy. 12. 6. and 14.
22.
in the Sacrifices, neither ordained them for to take his pleasure in them: but
he would that the people should be refreshed, and rejoiced therewith. Now
Solomon knowing that such sacrifices were not the principal things that God
required, as we may see by the scripture: knowing (I say) the same, and
willing to induce us Psalm. 50. 8. and 51. 18. Esa. 1. 11. Ose. 14. 3. Pro. 1.
31.
to offer the true sacrifices, he makes an allusion unto the old sacrifices.
and does show us, that if we sacrifice truly, we shall have profit with joy:
when he says, A man shall eat etc. As here before by eating, he has
threatened the wicked, and has foretold them their overthrow, saying,
Wherefore they shall eat. etc. Enen so now by eating, he promises
prosperity to the good which use their mouth well, in sacrificing always
praises unto God: that is to say, the fruit of the lips, which confess his
name. If then we will prosper and have joy of our prosperity, let us bring
forth good fruit out of our mouths: if we speak, let us speak as the words
Heb. 13. 15. Ephe. 4. 29. and 5. 3. 18.
of God, let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths. etc. Let no
fornication, nor any filthiness be once named amongst you. etc. Now as the
overthrow of the wicked shall ever endure, even so the prosperity that Solomon
promises now, is of no small continance, but shall last for ever. This
prosperity shall come unto them that shall rightly use their mouths, and also
which shall occupy all the other members of their body in well doing, as we are
admonished, I beseech ye then brethren, etc. For though Solomon Romans 12. 1.
does make no mention but of the fruit of the mouth, yet he excludes not the
other members, neither rejects the good fruit that comes from them: but
under the goodness that comes from the mouth, he comprehends the same of
the other members, 2. Cor. 5. ^^.
the which if we use well, we shall eat the fruit. For we must al appear
before the judgment seat of Christ, that every man may receive the things that
he has done in his own body. Let us follow that which is said, Be not
deceived: that which a man has sown, that shall he also reap. etc. If any
man shall ask why Solomon did rather name the mouth then any other member, we
may Call. 6. 7.
answer him, that it is because he signifies the prosperity of the good and
faithful by eating, the which is proper to the mouth: for the mouth is the
organe by the which the nourishment is sent unto all the body, and by the mouth
are executed all the most excellent works which concern the glory and honor
of God, as is to sing the praises of God. If again it be demanded, why he
signifies the blessed life, rather by eating, then by gold, silver, and other
riches: I answer, That he makes an allusion unto the old sacrifices, of the
which they did eat that offered them. And also, since that the fruition of the
heavenly glory, and of eternal life is our chief felicity, and the greatest
joy that we can have or desire: Solomon has signified it well and accordingly
by eating: and that for to yield unto our rudeness and infirmity: seeing
that the greatest goodness that we can bodidy have, stands in eating: for
without it, we perish, though we have never so much provision of other
riches. What riches soever we have, yet are we miserable concerning the body,
except we eat when necessity requires. Our Lord does somewhat signify,
that to eat is the most necessary profit that does belong to the body, when
in teaching us for to ask the necessary food of this present life, he does
admonish us, Mat. 6. 11
that we should ask our daily bread. But that it is so, that Solomon making
mention of the mouth does not exclude the other members, he himself does show
i^, when against a fruiteful mouth, he sets the soul or person of the
trespasser: and against good things, sets violence: saying, But the soul of
the trespasser shall suffer violence: that is to say that the trespassers
shall be punished for the violence done to God and to their neighbors. Now
violence does not only consist in outagious words, but also in all works
that are done to any man's hurt or hinderance. Considering then the
Antithesis, we may know that Solomon underneath the mouth, compriseth all the
other members. But when the soul of the trespasser is set against the mouth,
we may something gather that the wicked are more earnest too do evil then
the good are to do good: but the earnestness they have, is as if they had
devoured some deadly poison: for by the violence that they labor to do unto
God and to their neighbors, they shall be fed therewith in eternal death.
Besides this, let us note as amongst the most excellent mouths, are they
which faithfully preach the word, unto the honor of GOD and profit of his
Church: even so amongst the trespassers, the worst are they that under color
of holiness and religion do so we false doctrine: whereof Popery is full. And
thus the greatest trespass lies in the tongue: as Solomon does somewhat
signify, setting the soul of the trespasser against the mouth. Let us note
also that we must not trust to the good deeds of other men, as do the poor
Papists which trust in the merits of he saints, and she saints or in the
suffrages of the Church: and in the mean while to care nothing to put the
hand into the pie. Solomon does not say that we that we shall eat the good
fruit of the mouth of our neighbors. That which our neighbors shall have
done, shall nothing profit us, if we have been unfruitful: The Lord will
give to every one according to his works: and as Solomon says, Every man
shall eat the good fruit of his mouth. Nevertheless, a^ they that are
diligent to gather the fruit of any tree, do eat of the same: even so if we
be careful to hear the holy word by the mouth of the ministers thereof, we
shall eat the fruit of the same. Likewise if we participate with the
trespasses of the wicked, we^ shall (as they do) suffer violence, etc.

3 He that keeps his mouth, keeps his life: but he that opens his
lips, destruction shall be to him.
There are two principal ways of keeping the mouth, and consequently of
keeping the soul and life: and both of them are very necessary, The one is, to
keep soberness and temperancie in eating and drinking. They which have no
knowledge of GOD, do so judge: for they say, Of sober life, comes long life.
They judge so by a natural light without the Scripture: the which besides the
said light, does lighten us, by admonitions and exhortations, by
reprehentions and threatenings. If we receive these admonitions, and that we
tremble at his threatninges, we shall keep our souls Esaias. 5. 11. and 22.
12. 56. 10 Luke. 21* 34. Romans 13. 13. 1. Pet. 4. 2. 3.
not only for a time in this world, but also for eternal life. The other
manner of keepyng the mouth, is too be careful in following the third and
fourth commandments of the law.

Thus doing, we shall keep our souls: for none will pursue us to death, but
unjustly: and so we shall live first of all in this world, so far as shall be
expedient for our spiritual salvation: afterward hell shall have no power over
us, for to swallow us: but the Lord will deliver us by his great mercy alone,
and not that we can deserve it. For albeit it is said that we keep our
souls, yet must we attribute nothing, but unto the grace and virtue of the
holy Ghost which is given unto us: and for this cause that which he does in
us, is called ours. Let us then confess that the keeping of the mouth, and
consequently the keeping of the soul, is the gift of the holy Ghost: and let
us not think that David does attribute any thing to himself, when he says,
I will take heed to my ways. etc. He does show it well, when he says, Set
a watch, O Psalm. 39. 2 and. 114. 3.
Lord, before my mouth: and keep the door of my lips. Behold two kinds
of keeping our mouths, the which are very hard for man to do: for we have
bellies that cannot be filled, because they be insatiable, as are those of
gluttons and drunkardes, which eat and drink till they burst, and if they have
any thing too thrust into their mouths, they begin always afreshe: or else
they are delicate, desiring dainty meat, and sweet drinks: as are gluttons
and licorous fellows, that have none other care but to seek where good wine
is, and sweet morsels. Now the mouths of such bellies do serve them to
their appetites if they have any thing to furnishe the same. Thus much for the
first manner. As touching the second, it is no less hard. For in our mouth
there is a little member which is the tongue, but it is a fire, even a world
of iniquity. etc. The world is filled with such tongues: whereof David
complains, Iam. 3. 6. Psalm. 12. 2. and 34. 14.
Help me, O Lord, for there is not one goodly man left. etc. They talk of
vanity every one with his neighbor. etc. It follows the^ that the number of
the^ which keep their souls, is very small. If we desire to be of this number,
let us obey the admonition, Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they
speak no guile. It is of this kind of keeping our mouth that Solomon speaks
here, as he himself does give it to understand, setting rash speaking and
opening of the lips, against keeping of the mouth: and oppression against
keeping of the soul: saying, but he that opens his lips. etc. Here the
liars, periurers, false witnesses, and such wicked men do see what reward
they are worthy of, not only in this life, but also after this life. For as
they which keep their mouths, do keep their souls, not only for a time,
but also for ever: even so the wicked and the ungodly lips ought too be
punished in this Leui. 24. 14. Deuteronomy. 19. 16
world. The history also of Susanna does witness it. And if in time they come
not to repentance, let them look for eternal death. For the Lord will not
hold him giltlesse, that takes his name in vain. The slaunderers shall not
inherit the kingdom of God. Kings, Princes, and Superiors of the earth may
learn a lesson whereof they make no account, they have their honor and
excellency 1. Cor. 6. 10.
in most high commendations: for they can well tell how to punish them
grievously which shall speak against them, and do easily let pass the injuries
that are spoken and done against God, not doing any punishmente therefore, or
pay little. So doing they show thereby that they are puffed up with excessive
pride, and with a diuelishe arrogancy: for they do prefer themselves before
God, and do judge themselves more worthy, and more excellent then he: but
finally, God shall find them out well enough, and shall well maintain his honor
in punishing them, as they deserve: even as they are threatened therewith.
Diverse great Lords have well proved, and shall feel that GOD resists Psalm.
2. 4. and. 82. 6.
the proud.

4 The sluggarde lusts, but his soul has naught: but the soul of the
diligent shall have plenty.
There are iesters and idle bodies, who making no account of giving themselves
unto good and necessary works, do give themselves to follow foolish and
unprofitable desires and pleasures: and yet for to seem pleasant and merry,
they are not ashamed to pronounce that they would not give their pleasures for
a great sum of money. Such folk are much unprovided and void of good sense
and sound i^dgment, when against their conscience and affection, they reject
by word that which God has created for the use of men, and contrarily do
esteem and praise that which God has forbidden in the tenth commandment of
his law, Thou shall not lust. In this manner, they do more esteem their
fantasies, which do nothing profit, then the living God, who gives us all
things abundantly for to use. For this cause they well deserve for to be
brought into extreme and utter necessity, and to have nothing wherewith to
maintain themselves in this life, but to be in continual and miserable sorrow
all the time that they have to dwell in this world. Solomon does threaten the^
with such misery, saying, The sluggarde lusts, etc. He has already diverse
times used the like threats. It is a thing very infamous and reprochable, for
to live in idleness, as we do judge al naturally. For albeit that naturally
we love well to do nothing, and that after the flesh we Pro. 6. 50. 11 and.
10. 4. and 12. 27.
think the^ happy that have wherewithal to live without doing any thing, yet
if we have men servants or maid servants, or journey men for to do our
business, except they labor diligently, we will not look cheerfully upon
them, they vex and grieve us, and we cannot be pleased with them: and that
is chiefly because we love our profit, and do fear to be hindered: but
heerewith we have an agreement that man does naturally detest slothfulness.
But it is not so much, neither so as we ought. For we do not abhor it in our
own persons, but so far as we fear to die for hunger, or to become poor and
beggars. Solomon does something signify this fear by the word of lusting: and
when he does threaten that this fear shall come upon us, if we be slouthful,
when he says, But his soul has naught, The slouthful are here threatened
with poverty and bodily want, and temporal scarcity, the which is very hard
to bear: but yet it is nothing in comparison of the spiritual hunger,
wherewith follows the deprivation of eternal riches, wherewithal the slouthful
shall be taken, which have nothing esteemed the threateninges of Solomon, and
chiefly they that have made no account of gathering the spiritual seed of the
word, which is the food of life. To them also chiefly do the threatenings
belong, and upon them are they put in execution, not only in this life, but
more miserably in the other. For if God do not esteem them worthy of this
present life, and the riches thereof, much less will he count them worthy of
eternal riches. And so the soul of the slouthful which make none account of
their duty, shall have naught: for it shall be deprived of temporal riches, and
of eternal and heavenly. It is not then without cause that Solomon labors
so often to awake up the slouthful by such threatenings, when he sees them in
so great danger. The care that Solomon has so often to threaten the slouthful,
shall profit them that amend, and shall make the unrepentant more inexcusable.
Now that such threats should not be executed against us, let us take heed to
turn away from slothfulness, and to occupy ourselves diligently in labor,
every man according to his vocation. So doing, our soul shall want nothing, but
we shall have such abundance of riches, that we shall be contented. Solomon
does promise us it, saying, but the soul of the diligent. etc. As heretofore
he has promised, that he might print it so much the more into our wits, and
for to confirm it more unto us, and to make us more certain of the goodness
and liberality of God toward us: and that being so assured, we may be more
inclined to give ourselves unto labor according to our vocation, and after as
we understand to be his will. We will therefore give ourselves unto labor,
according as God has ordained it by his word, and as it has bin handeled
here before, and will diligently do our work, not by desire of enriching
ourselves, and keep back to ourselves what God sends us, without making our
poor brethren and members partakers thereof with us. This is not the ways to
abound and increase in riches, nor to make our souls fat, as Solomon does
show it. If we obey unto his admonitions, our souls shall not Pro. 11. 24.
25. 2. Cor. 9. 6. Gal. 6. 9. 1. Tim. 6. 17.
only have worldly and temporal plenty, but also after this life, they shall
fully enjoy heavenly and eternal riches. For the Lord does not promise unto
his faithful people earthly riches in this life, for to forsake them
afterward, and to suffer them miserably to perish. etc.

5 A righteous man hates lying words: but the wicked causes slander and
shame.
If we will be certain in our consciences that we be righteous, and also to
give true witness of our wisdom and honesty before men, that they may be
edified, and that we be no offense to them, so much as we can, we must abhor
lying: as Solomon does show us, saying, But the just man hates lying words.
There is none of us, but hates to hear lying, and chiefly when lying brings
us any hurt, either to our body, to our goods, or to our name. Such hatred does
not proceed of fear that we have to sin, but of fear that we have to
suffer loss: and therefore such hatred cannot make us certain, nor our
neighbors, that we be honest men: but therein for to have and to give a
certentie, that we are honest men, we must hate ourselves, in as much as we
are enclining naturally to lying, according as the Scripture witnesses it:
saying, That every man is a liar: and as we of our nature do lie, even so also
are we ready to believe lying, and love to hear lies, so that we think Psalm.
116. 11
therein is no hurt nor hinderance: we delight to hear ourselves praised, and
well spoken of, and to be flattered in slaundering, and in evil reporting of our
neighbors, whom we hate. Now as in two sorts we love lying, and hereby
have a witness that we are wicked and ungodly, and also for to have a
certainty: that we are righteous and honest men, we must hate the words of
lying after two sorts, so that we should fear to pronounce it with our
mouth, and to receive it with our ears. Albeit that al faithful and true
Christians should be thus disposed and affectioned to follow the third and
nienth commandment. For for observing of them well, we must not only beware
to abuse the name of God, and to lie against our neighbors, but we also ought
to procure that none should abuse this holy Name, neither speak evil of his
neighbors. But, I say, that this same belongs unto al Christians, yet
chiefly unto the Ministers of the word to pronounce truth, and to abhor the
declaring of lies: and to the Magistrates and Judges not to receive false
accusation. So doing, the Ministers shall not seduce the people by false
doctrines, as do the Friars and Exo. 23. 1.
hypocrites: neither will the Judges pronounce wicked sentences. But since that
the Scripture does attribute righteousness unto them that hate the word of
lying, we must infer thereupon, that the number of the righteous is very
small, and almost none. For it is said, Help Lord. For there is not one godly
man left: for the Psalm. 12. 1
faithful are nourished from among the children of men. We conclude also, that
we can not be just, except we do violence to our nature, which is inclined
to think and to speak lies. If we let loose the bridle unto our tongue,
according as it is drawn and driven by the natural inclination of man, we
shall win nothing to think ourselves just, and to pronounce that we are
honest men. Solomon by the spirit of truth does pronounce us to be wicked:
when he says, But the wicked deuiseth slander. etc. This is not to say, that
we must not accuse them which lead a wicked life. Besides this, let us note
first of al, albeit that though one feels himself to be slaundered, he will
make so great a matter of it, as to think it laweful for him to smite and kill
him that has diffamed him, notwithstanding the greatest part of the world
does not esteem it to be any great offense to slander their neigbours:
experience also does show it, when the world always has been and still
remains full of lying, flatterers, detractours, and false witnesses, which
have labored and still do labor to slander the good and righteous chiefly,
as have Joseph, Moses, David, the Prophets, Jesus Christ, and his Apostles
been, and now the poor faithful ones do feel it. Here may be seen that
the judgment of the worldlinges and carnal, is first of al corrupted, in this,
that they judge the slandering of their neighbors so lite and small a matter:
and if they be slaundered, they count themselves so greatly offended, that
they think it to be lawefull for them too kill them that have missesaide and
backebitten them. Afterward they are filled with cruelty, when they slander
the just and innocent. Secondly, let us note, sith that they which
missereporte their neighbors that are but dust and ^shes, are pronounced
wicked: by a more strong reason they that slander GOD so far as they can,
are to be esteemed most wicked: but when we cause men to make amends for the
dishonor they have done to their neighbors, and not to GOD, they well show
that they honor more the creature then the Creator. Thirdly, let us note that
in this present sentence we ought to behold the promise of life enclosed, for
the faithful which hate lying, and speak truth, since that righteousness is
attributed unto them. Contrarily, that the missereporters are threatened with
death, since they are called wicked. And so when we love life, and abhor
death, we are here exhorted to love truth, and to maintain the same, to hate
slaunderinges and diffaminges, and to procure the honor of our neighbors.

6 Righteousness preserves the upright of life: but wickedness overthrows
the sinner.
We al desire naturally to avoid hurt, and danger, and to be in safety, and
to keep ourselves well: but most commonly we know not how, and by what
means to preserve ourselves: as we may know it, seeing that many do
overthrow and destroy themselves, willing to save themselves. Now that we
may not be of this number, and that we know how to preserve us, Solomon
does teach us, when he says, Righteousness preserves, etc. Here he
teaches us no new thing that we have not seen. But besides that which is
there handeled, we must note first of all, Pr. 11. 4. 5. 6 Eccle. 7. 21. 1.
John. 1. 8.
that as our righteousness is in this world never without sin, even so we
are never so perfect, but that we may still grow: for during this life, how
right a path soever we keep, yet can it not be right unto perfection.
Otherwise, we should not need to ask Lead me, O Lord, in thy
righteousness: make me to know thy Psalm. 5. 9. and 25. 4. and. 25. 11.
ways, O Lord: Teach me thy way, O Lord. The perfection that God requires
of us in this world is never such, but that therein may always be found some
thing to be amended: nevertheless when we walk in soundness of conscience,
and with a free heart, without dissembling and hypocrisy, in that he
commands by his word, imperfection is not imputed unto us. And this is the
cause wherefore the Scripture calls us upright and perfect: and also we are
so, since that God accepts us for such. The Monks and Nuns among the
Papists do proudely brag of the state of perfection, which has bin brought out
of the devils shop, the which gives the^ to understand that they are not like
other, and that in this estate they deserve not only for themselves, but also
for them, that commend themselves to their prayers, and do good unto their
coue^t. They resemble the Pharisee, but not in all things: for the same gave
alms, and fasted, but these here devour, so that they deserve the curse.
Secondly, Let us note that if we will be well preserved, it suffices not to
have some beginning of religion, of holy conversation Luke. 18. 11 Mat. 23. 14.
and righteousness, but we must continewe, and aspire unto perfection without
being weary. Whosoever shall con^^new to the end, shall be saved. And that we
might learn to persevere, and come to perfection, the Lord has set an order in
his Church, to the which we Ephe. 4. 11. Col. 1. 25. 2. Tim. 3. 16.
must all obey. In following this order, S. Paul speaking of the Church says,
Of who^ I am a Minister. etc. Al Scripture divinely inspired, is profitable for
doctrine. But what order soever we hold in the Church, it is not in us to
make us perfect: this is the work Phi. 5. 1. 6. and 2. 13. 1. Pet. 5. 10.
Phil. 2. 12.
of God. Holding for certain that he which has begun a good work in us,
will finishe the same: it is God that works in you both the will and the deed.
For this cause Saint Peter prays. But the God of all grace make you perfect.
And albeit that this is the work of GOD, yet it is not to say, that we must
be negligent but careful for to aspire unto this perfection, in following S.
Paul, Occupy yourselues about your salvation. etc. And he gives Phil. 3. 12.
an example to pursue and go forward, when he says, not as though I had
already atteined to it, either were already perfect: but I follow, etc. But
for to come well to the end of this same, we must have love which is the bond
of perfection. If we do not Collo. 3. 14.
thus proceed, we cannot be preserved: for we are void of righteousness, of
faithfulness, of integrity, and of sound goodness, wherein stands the
perfection of joy, and there is in us nothing but wickedness, frowardness,
and unfaithfulness, which lead men to destruction and perdition. Thirdly, let
us note that albeit we sin continually, and without ceassing, and that we
must ask pardon for our sins, confessing ourselves guilty of death and
eternal damnation because of our sins: yet if it displease us to have
offended, and with true affection give ourselves to well doing, the Scripture
calls us not sinners, for to condemn us to destruction for our wickedness:
but does call us saints, righteous, innocent, because that God for our faith
and repentance does accept us for such, not imputing unto us our faults.
Wherefore when the Apostataes and transgressors, (for to lessen their sins
whereof they are reproved) do say that we are al sinners, comprehending both
good and evil, they lie falsely, and do belie God and his scripture, and do
injury to the faithful, setting them in the rank of them which for their
sins and wickedness do go into destruction. When they speak thus, they
condemn them that GOD absolueth by his word.

7 There is that makes himself rich, and has nothing, and that makes
himself poor, having great riches.
We al come of one father, and of one mother, we are al one flesh and one
blood, and have al our affections which tend to our profit: yet have we not
al like affections, but diverse, and which have diverse effects, according as it
seems unto every one that he ought to proceed for to make his profit, or
to get honor, and to be in reputation. For example of diversity, or
contrariety of affections and effects, Solomon says, There is that makes
himself rich. etc. Here Solomon does declare unto us that there are some
which are poor, so that they have nothing, yet do they brag to be rich,
tending by such dissimulation to get credit, and authority, honor and
reputation, and by such means to find men that will lend them, and trust them
with their goods. So doing, they are thieves and robbers, offending God and
their neighbors. Contrarily, there are some which possess great riches, and
for fear they have that men will ask of gift, or to borrow (so cruel and
churlishe are they, having no pity nor compassion of the needy) do hyde their
riches, and feign themselves poor. These same are little better then the
other: for, as much as in them lies, they hunger starve the poor, and cut
their throtes. Herein Solomon does declare us the abuses of the world, that
we may learn that we must not frame ourselves like thereunto, and that we
should take good heed least such deceivers do beguile us. Nevertheless it is
lawful for us, yea necessary, to make ourselves rich, where we are poor, not
in heaping up great treasures upon earth, as do the Mat. 6. 19 20. Luke. 12.
15. and. 16. 9. Psalm. 37. 16.
miserable and woeful covetous (for our Lord does forbid it us) but laying up
our treasures in heaven, as we are commanded. For if we have any thing to
distribute, we will not cease to become rich, if we have contentation,
though we have but a little. For a small thing that the righteous has, is
better then great riches of the ungodly. Wherefore let us obey the Apostle, Let
your conversation be without covetousness. In this sort we shall be as poor,
and yet making many rich. Also, When we are rich, it is lawful for us, yea
necessary to make ourselves poor: not for fear to lend Heb. 13. 5. 2. Cor.
6. 10. Luke. 12. 15.
or to give: but we must follow the saying of our master Christ, make you
friends of wicked mammon. etc.

It remains that they which buy, be as though they possessed not. He
exhorts us to follow the readiness and willingness of the Macedon
Churches, Command the rich. etc. If in following 1. Cor. 7. 31. 2. Cor. 8.
7. Tim. 6. 17.
the opinion of some, we will understand that Solomon by the first part of
this sentence speaks of them that have great abundance of riches, and yet
govern themselves so evil that they become poor and needy, and sone indetted,
there shall be no inconvenience. For we see many of them which having
abundance of riches, do not cease therefore to owe much, and that not through
excess or great superfluous expenses, but their riches do not prosper with
them because that God does not power forth his blessing upon them, the which
only makes rich. Contrarily, there are some which have nothing or very
little, but because that through Pro. 10. ^^.
the blessing of God they rule themselves well, they have enough and
contentation: according as Saint Paul says, Truly godliness is great gain,
if a man be contented with that he has. Such 1. Tim. 6. 6.
riches are much more better then the more abundant, the which are possessed
without confessing the blessing of God. To the end then that for all our
poverty, we may be rich, and have no need, let us confess that the
blessing of God is necessary for us: and therefore let us ask of him, that he
would give us this day our daily bread. And let us believe that it is he only
that governs us, and gives us al things for to use. For then the gifts of
God shall be profitable unto us, and we shall use them rightly, and to our
commodity and felicity, when we shall be assured by faith that it is God who
governs al things, and that we shall ask and look for all things that we have
need of, of him.

8 A man will give his riches for the ransom of his life: but the poor cannot
hear the reproach.
When we hear Solomon speak thus, let us take good heed from blaspheming as
do the Papists, which say that we must satisfy Math. 5. 14, 16.
for our sins, and win Paradise by our alms given too the poor, and by
distribution of our goods unto the Churches and couentes for to be partakers
with their suffrages and prayers, with this goodly divine service and with the
works of super erogation of Priests and Monks. It is too horrible a
blasphemy, by the which the Papists do deny the power and virtue of Christ
his death ^^ passion, and as much as in them lies do abolishe the same: and no
thank to them that all the world is not damned eternally, seeing that there is
no salvation in any other. etc. It seems well at the Acts. 4. 12.
first sight that Solomon would lead men to trust in their riches, and by a
kind of speech, to make them their God and Savior. But let us know that
Solomon, never thought upon any such matter: for the holy Ghost by whom he
has spoken, does not contrary and say against himself. Now he attributes
unto God the ransom of life, but God will redeem my soul, O Lord God
forasmuch as we have gotten this blessing, neither by our power, wisdom,
Psalm. 49. 15. and. 130. 3.
dignity, nor riches, but by the means of the shedding of the precious blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Eue^ as the son of man came not to be served. etc.
But Christ being come an high Priest of good Mrt. 20. 28. He. 9. 11. 12.
things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands, that is, not of this building, neither by the blood of Goats and
Calves: but by his own blood entered he in once unto the holy place, and
obtained eternal redemption for us. Knowing that ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver 1. Pe. 1. 18. 19.
and gold, from your vain conversation received by the traditions of the
Fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ. For God so loved the world,
that he has given his only begotten John. 3. 16.
son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, etc. In this
appeared the love of God toward us, etc. Of this ransom and deliverance we
are made partakers by faith. Let us then 1. John. 4. 9. 10 John. 3. 16. and 5.
24. Romans 3. 24. 25. 1. Pet. 1. 5. 21.
know and learn that Solomon does not here speak of this ransom, whereby
the souls of the faithful are eternally redeemed: but he means that if a
man be taken in any misdeede that deserves corporal punishment, or that he
sees himself in the hands of his enemies, that desires nothing but his
death, he will not spare his goods, if he think that by them he may escape
and save his life. That Solomon means so, he himself does show, when
against this, he says, But the poor cannot hear the reproach. Because, that
in what danger soever he is, or what threatening soever that is made him, he
cannot redeem himself for want of riches: it is said, That he hears not
the reproach. He answers not unto the desires of them which have him in their
power, that do watch and chide him. Thieves and robbers do chiefly seek
after other men's purses, and for the most part the judges of the earth are like
unto them: for they will pardon great thieves, and hang up the small. And thus
we may know that by their threateninges and reproaches they say, bring, and
ye shall be absolved, and ye shall redeem your life: they that have wherewith,
do hear reproach, but the poor which have nothing, cannot obey. Let us also
then understand that Solomon teaches not the rich that they should deliver
themselves by their riches from the punishment that they have deserved for
their misdoinges. He also teaches not the poor to be rebels, neither to
despise correction: but he declares unto us what often happens in this
world. If any man will understand that the rich are ransomed, and that the
poor do fear no exaction of them, there is no inconvenience. And hereof we
may learn that the poor which are contented and take their poverty and low
estate patiently, are in greater quietness tha^ the rich which feel much more
care and pensiveness to heap riches together, and to keep them: they are
most what in fear of them, and in danger of their lives, except the thieves
and robbers do see that they can otherways come by them. But again, seeing
that the rich worldlings and carnal men have their hope and trust in their
riches, therefore it is a great heaviness and trouble to be in fear of
ransoming and robbing.

Now for to avoid such sorrow and heaviness, Let us follow this sentence, Put
not not your trust in oppression, nor in robbery. Psalm. 62. 10. Mat. 6. 19. 2^
Luke. 12. 15.
etc. After these worldly troubles, they which shall not have obeyed to these
admonitions, shall have eternal sorrow. Luke. 6. 16. and 1. Tim. 6. James. 5.

9 The light of the righteous rejoices: but the candle of the wicked shall be
put out.
When our Lord Jesus Christ says, ye are the light of the Math. 5. 14. 16.
world: and after does admonish, Let your light so shine before men, etc.
He first takes the light for them to whom the charge is committed to teach
the people, not only privately, but chiefly publicly. Secondly, for the care
and diligence of teaching and by wholesome doctrine, and by honest and good
conversation. Such light ought to rejoice their hearts to whom it is given:
as Esaias does show, How beautiful are the feet of them which bring tidinges of
peace? Again, O ye desolate places of Jerusalem be Esaias. 52. 7. 9
glad and rejoice together, etc. Also our Lord does show it, when he says,
That you may glorify your Father which is in heaven. For if we glorify God,
it is with joy and gladness, neither can it be otherwise done. Such light
does not much rejoice the world, because it is given to wickedness. Now this
is condemnation, John. 3. 19.
that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more then light.
This remains not only where Popery is, but is also common there where the
Gospel is preached. But albeit that whatsoever is said, contains truth, and
serves to edification: yet nevertheless, it is not in this sense that Solomon
speaks of light. The natural sense of this place is, that Solomon speaks of
the ease, prosperity, and felicity both of the righteous and wicked. Then
when Solomon says, The light of the righteous rejoices, etc. we will take it
after that sort, as we took that the city rejoiced for the prosperity of
the just. Solomon then would say that the people is blessed, and that they
ought well to rejoice, amongst the which Pro. 11. 10.
honest men have no grief nor trouble, but are in joy, rest and prosperity.
The holy Scripture does often use to shine, to lighten, brightness and light
in this sense, as contrarily a man cannot long rejoice with ease, prosperity
and glory amongst the wicked, seeing they fall into destruction, Solomon does
now signify Psalm. 13. 4. and. 34. 6. and 36. 9.
unto us this destruction, when he says, that the lamp of the wicked shall
be put out. Wherein we must note that as by the light, the scripture
signifies joy, glory, ease and prosperity: even so by darkness it
signifies the contrary. Let us then know that though Esaias. 30. 26. and. 60.
1. Pro. 1. 34. 32 and. 2. 22. and 4. 19. and. 10. 25. 27 28. 30.
the wicked have their ease, that they prosper and triumph, yet that al shall be
turned into misery, calamity and destruction: and therefore that we have no
great cause of joy, when we see the glory of the wicked in this world, no
more then a candle is put out in a most dark night, or that the Sun does
loose his light at high noone tide. Moreover let us note, that if the Kings and
Princes of the earth will show themselves righteous as they ought, they must
Psalm. 35. 6. Esaias. 13. 9. 10. and. 60. 2. Eze. 32. 7. 8. Joel. 2. 2. 10. 31.
and 3. 15. Psalm. 20. and 21.
in their triumph and prosperity, labor to make their subjects glad, in
mainteining good policy, not committing any exactions for to serve their
desires and lusts, but to follow what is taught them by Moses, the Prophets
and Apostles: and chiefly for to rejoice the poor faithful. For wicked and
dissolute persons rejoice not at good order, but when things are in confusion.
They love to sin in troubled water. And as such is the duty of Kings and
Princes, so likewise ought subjects to rejoice, when their Lords do prosper:
and ought to sing with their heart. Finally when he says, But the candle of
the wicked, etc. Let us learn that we are taught, how we ought not to flatter
the wicked, how high soever they be, and what prosperity soever they have,
nor envy their wealth and felicity. Otherwise our Candle should be put out.
For they which consent to Romans 1. 31.
evil, are worthy of death, etc.

10 Only by pride does man make contention: but with the well advised, is
wisdom.
It seems to ourselves that we are of so good a nature, that we desire
nothing more then to govern us wisely, in peace, unity, and concord one with
an other: and do judge it great foolishness to do otherwise. But so long as
we suffer ourselves to be ruled after our own nature, it can not be but there
must needs be strife and debate: and chiefly when things are not done after
our desire. For we are so proud, and we think ourselves to be so wise, that we
would have al things to come to pass, and be done after our fancy. If the
contrary happen, according as we think we have credit, power and authority,
we are ready to draw out our sword, or else to braule and rail, or else to
consume ourselves by law: if this proud and arrogant estimation that we have
of ourselves, were cast far from us into oblivion and forgetfulness, and that
we did walk in humility and true wisdom, no strife should be raised amongst
us. Solomon does signify it, saying, Only by pride. And forasmuch as by
pride is moved contention (the which proceeds of hatred and for want of
love) it follows that pride does beget hate and enuiousnes, and thereby is
love quenched. Through pride Cain became Genesis 4. 5. 8.
angry with his brother Abel because he pleased God: and thereby forgetting
the love that he ought unto his brother, he conceived a deadly hatred against
him: whereupon he moves contention, and kills him. Let us know therefore,
that al proud, hateful and contentious persons, are the seed of Caine: and as
the true faithful which follow the humility, the softness and love of Christ
are called Christians, and are so indeed: even so the proud do deserve to be
called Cainists, as they are. And therefore as God resisted Caine, cursing and
rejecting him: even so does he resist the proud. I have said to the
foolish, be not so foolish: and 1. Pet. 5. 4 Psalm. 75. 5. Luke 1. 51.
to the wicked, set not up your horn, etc. But God is Judge, etc. And the
virgin Marie says, He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their
hearts. Therefore as we abhor Caine, let us also not become Cainistes, lest
we be rejected of God: let us forsake al pride, hatred, contentions, and
debates, walking in humility, love, unity, concord and peace. Even so doing
we shall not be of the stock of Caine, but the true children of God. Blessed
are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Let Mat. 5. 9.
Ephe. 5. 1. Phil. 2. 1.
us be folowers of God. For to show ourselves rightly such, let us follow
Saint Paul. For to turn ourselves from pride as it behooves, and shun
contention, for to walk in true humility, and to live in peace according as
the scriptures before alleged do teach us, we must not become blockish and
beastly, neither foolish and void of understanding, but we must be well advised
and endued with wisdom. Solomon does show it, when against that which he
has said he adds, But with the well advised there is wisdom. The proud do
judge and think themselves to be wise enough and therefore they would that al
things should be done after their will and fantasy, and they will the sooner
contend, as things are not done according as they ymagine, wherein they show
themselves to want wisdom, and do declare their furious and mad folly,
when they are easy to begin contention and stir up strife. But they which
suffer themselves to be counseled, and do delight to follow good counsel,
are iudued with wisdom, whereby they are governed unto humility, and thereby
do they fly contentions and debate, seeking nothing but peace, friendship and
concord with all men, so much as they possibly can, without offending God. This
humblenes ought Romans 12. 18
to be followed of al men, having one mind toward one an other, etc.
Notwithstanding this is not to say, but that every man by good aduisement and
wisdom ought to labor for to hold fast the degree where to he has been
called and appointed of God, yet without unbridled lust, and without affection
to rule, but so far as is expedient for to do his duty well. It is not
without cause that we make mention of the calling and appointment of God, and
that we cast away the unbridled desire and affection to rule. For first of al,
it is not lawful for us to take in hand to maintain ourselves in any degree,
except the Lord has called us theretoo, and if our estate be not according to
his will, the which is declared unto us by his word. Saint Paul does well
show it. Therefore when the Pope and his Clergy have no calling of God, it
rightly follows, 1. Cor. 7. 20 Ephe. 4. 1.
that they foolishly and proudly do proceed to maintain their degrees: the
fruits whereof are seen: that is, that the kingdom of the Pope is filled
with contention and brawlings, as experience declares. The Monks seem to
themselves to be very humble, Col. 2. 18.
and yet they walk in pride. Likewise are their conuents full of envy,
injuries, contentions, and debates: One order and sort of Monks against an
other, for to maintain their Lordship and high dignity. Secondly, the Kings
of the earth for to satisfy their greedy desire, and excessive affection to
rule, do set the world in trouble through wars and shedding of blood.

11 The riches of vanity shall diminish: but he that gathers with the hand,
shall increase them.
Albeit, that Solomon's intent is not here to teach us how we may heap up
great riches together, yet we shall not want, but shall abound in wealth, we if
will believe him. He says first of al, That the riches of vanity, etc. By the
which he labors to turn us away from prodigality, the which he calls
vanity, and that rightly: for he that spends his goods more excessiuely
then he ought, does follow vanity: seeing that such expenses does nothing
profit either his body or his soul: as it is easy to be known, and the
prodigal do also feel it. For if the prodigal for his own pleasure does
commit excess, his mind thereby is corrupted and made beastly, and his body
made more heavy and more subject to sickness: and consequently, more near
unto corruption. Moreover, how honorable soever the prodigal is, if he spend
excessiuely, the same shall nothing profit him, as Solomon does well signify the
same, saying, That riches shall diminishe. The prodigal Son spoken of in Luke
has proved it to be true: Luke 15. 13
and now also the gluttons and drunkards, the dainty and sugared mouths do
also feel it. But albeit that vanity does signify prodigality, yet is it
not to say, that it is an inco^uenient thing to stretch vanity further, and to
take it for always and means by the which a man comes unto poverty, as are
slothfulness and idleness, and also covetousness. And if vanity which
does diminish temporal riches, ought to be avoided, much more ought the same
to be Pro. 6. 6. and 10. 3. and 13. 4
fled that does deprive us of the heavenly inheritance, which is everlasting.
Therefore we must be careful to fly away from all that that may hinder us
from receiving of the Gospel, which is the power of God to save us, and makes
us inheritours and possessours of the heavenly and eternal riches.

Secondly, for to show us how we shall abound in wealth, he says, But he
that gathers with the hand, etc. Here he exhorts us to work, and does
promise us that we increase if we will labor, and get our bread by good,
profitable, and necessary works, the which he means by the hand: as we
may understand it, when he sets the hand against vanity. Solomon has
made us the like promises here before. Thus we learn, that by flying of Pro.
12. 11. and 13. 4.
vanity, and doing some worthy and excellent work, it is lawful to gather
riches together: but we must take heed we set not our hearts upon them,
otherwise, it shall not be togather with the hand, but with vanity: for it is
great vanity for a man to occupy himself with greediness and covetousness.
As David says, Doubtless man walks in a vain shadow, and disquieteth
himself in Psalm. 39. 6.
vain: he heapeth up riches, and can not tell who shall gather them. Again, I
turned, and saw vanity under the Sun. There is not only vanity in such
laboring, but also great cruelty: for they Eccle. 4. 7.
which gather couetously, care least to do wrong unto their neighbors, and
also through hunger, to starve and kill them. For this cause are they called in
the Scriptures thieves, robbers, and murderers: Esai. 1. 59. Amos. 8.
and it is laid to their charge, that their hands are full of blood.

12 The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the
desire comes, it is as a tree of life.
When Solomon says, The hope that is deferred, etc. he does show us thereby
that we have great need of patience, and chiefly in looking for the eternal
riches. For by how much as the riches are more precious and more excellent,
by so much are men more vexed, when they are long kept from the possession of
that which is longed for and desired. The worldlinges do prove this in their
temporal riches: and the faithful do feel it in the heavenly and eternal
riches. Saint Paul gives witness thereto, and not only Romans 8. 23.
the creature, but we also which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even
we do sigh in ourselves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our
body. Again, For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be
destroyed, we have building 2. Cor. 5. 1.
given of God, that is, an house not made with hands, but eternal in the
heavens. Abraham felt this languishing, as he does show us, when a certain
time after that God had promised him, I will make thee grow into a great
people, he complayneth, saying, O Lord God everlasting, what will thou give
me? Seeing I go childlesse. Genesis 12. 2. and 15. 2.
David also declares this his longing, in the 42. Psalm, saying, As the Heart
brayeth for the rivers of water, so pants my soul after thee, O God. The
Saints therefore in looking for Psalm. 42. 2.
that which they hope for, do languishe and fainte, but so soon as they
obtain their desires, they wax joyful and are satisfied. Solomon does
signify the same, saying, But when the desire comes, etc. David also does
express it, saying, I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto
me, and heard me. It is said of Simeon, That he waited for the consolation
of Israel, and the holy Ghost was upon him. And when he had received his
desire, he prayseth God, and rejoices, and is satisfied: as Psalm. 40. 1. Luke
2. 25. 29.
he shows by his Canticle. Now as the holy Fathers in their languishing
were never impatient, so must we do the like, following that which the Prophet
Abacuk says, For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the last, it
shall speak and not lie: though it Haba. 2. 3. Hebr. 10. 36.
tarry, wait: for it shall surely come, and shall not stay. Again, Ye have need
of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the
promise.

13 He that despises the word, shall be destroyed: but he that fears the
commandment, shall be rewarded.
We must not doubt that Solomon does not speak here of the word and
commandment of God, the which speaks to the world after diverse sorts, as
he has diverse Ministers and servants. He speaks to the peoples and nations
by his Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Doctors, which in the name of Jesus
Christ do preach faith and repentance, according to the holy Scriptures. He
speaks by Kings, Princes, and Lords of the earth, when by holy laws,
statutes and ordinances, they labor to guide their subjects in justice, and
to cause them to live peaceably and in true and holy religion. He speaks
when fathers and mothers do teach good manners unto their children. He
speaks also when every man particularly does admonish or reprove his
neighbor when it is needful. Finally, he speaks, when we labor through
honest and holy conversation to edify our neighbors. Whosoever does despise
the word, after what sort soever God speaks, shall be destroyed, first
temporally (as many have tried it, and do daily feel it.) Secondly, if there
be no repentance, there follows eternal destruction. The holy Scripture
does show us many examples thereof, and also it is replenished with
threateninges against the contemners, whereof we presently have one, when
Solomon says, He shal-be destroyed, etc. The first Chapter has the like
threateninges. Pro. 1. 24
Contrarily, if we gladly hear that which is said unto us in the name of
God, and by his authority, and that with true zeal of heart we endeavor to
obey it, we shall be maintained in good estate, and shall not perish. Solomon
does here pronounce it, saying:

But he that fears the commandment, shall be rewarded. Wherein let us first
note, that he says not simply, he that fears. For albeit that the contemners
are affrayde by the accusation of their consciences, and that they tremble and
fear, when the word and commandment is preached unto them, yet they cease
not to perish: for they fear not the commandment wherein is promised
reward, but they fear the pains and torments. Therefore if we Deuteronomy. 4. 10
and 10. 12.
desire to be rewarded, let us fear, not the pain, but the commandment,
forsaking evil, and applying ourselves willingly unto goodness: because the
commandment is holy, just, and good. This is the fear that our God
demands, Gather the people together unto me, etc. that they may fear me.
And now Israel, what does the Lord thy God ask of thee, but only that thou
should fear him? They that shall have this fear, shall be rewarded with
everlasting blessedness, which is a reward not of merit, but of grace and
liberal goodness. Secondarily, let us note, that if we will understand this
sentence of the sayings of Kings and Princes, they ought to learn here, that
their office is to root out the wicked, and to set good men at rest: for we
may also expound the last word of this sentence by, To obtain peace. Mat.
24. 25.


Thirdly, let us note, that the word, Word, after the Hebrewe phrase, does
signify a thing: and after this signification, we may say, that he shall be
destroyed, which despises the thing that is committed unto him.

14 The instruction of a wise man, is as the well spring of life, to turn away
from the snares of death.
As the man which faints for want of drink, if he meet with a fountain of
water, and drink thereof, does slake his thirst, and is so quickened, that
he is out of danger to dye by thirst: even so when we have Lords and
gouernous which do their duty in politic government: when fathers and
mothers are careful of their families as behooves: and when the Pastors of
the church do employe themselves diligently unto wholesome doctrine: then have
we wise men, whose admonitions, counselles and corrections if we receive,
then do we drink of the fountain of living water, the which will preserve us
from death, and will quicken us, when by such instructions the holy Ghost
woorketh in us, sanctifying and making us obedient by faith and repentance. For
without the working of the holy Ghost, instruction is dead, and is deadly to
them to whom it is offered, when they do not willingly receive it. Solomon
does exhort us to drink of this spring and fountain, when he says, The
instruction of a wise man, etc. For to drink rightly of this fountain, let us
resort thither whither Esaias calls us, saying, Al ye that be a thirst, come
to the waters. Esai. 55. 1.
Therefore, for to receive well the instruction of the wise, and to be
refreshed, and to avoid the snares of death, we must come unto Jesus Christ,
that he may make us partakers of the graces and gifts of his Spirit,
teaching us by the doctrine of his Gospel. For as we are corporally nourished
with bread, wine, milk, and water: even so ought we to understand, that our
souls are sustained with the doctrine of the Gospel, with the holy Ghost, and
other gifts of Jesus Christ: and are so nourished and sustained therewith,
that we shall never need any thing. If thou knew Ioh. 4. 10. and 7. 37.
the gift of God, etc. Again, whosoever drinks of this water, etc. If any
man thirst, let him come to me, and drink, etc. Over and besides this, let us
note first of al, that they which take upon them to instruct others, should
be wise, that no man may reprove or blame them, Thou which teach an other,
teach thou not thy self? And they must be wise, not as Turks and Papists,
Romans 2. 21.
which think themselves very wise, when they are very diligent to publishe
humane doctrines and diuellishe traditions, by the which they seduce the
hearts of the simple, and so do draw them to death, and do not quench the
thirst of the people, with the spring of life: they are not administratours of
the waters of this lively spring, but they lead the people to a forsaking of
the living God, which is the fountain of living water: but they must follow
the wisdom of Moses, of the Prophets and Apostles, of good judges and
kings, which have ministered this lively water. Secondly, let us note, that
where there are no wise men, there is no spring of life, but al are snared in
the nets of death. Whereupon we may understand, how great the misery is
wherein the Turks and Papists are: and to consider, how much more miserable
are they which have wise men, and do despise them. They are more miserable then
they of Sodom and Gomorrha. Mat. 10. 1^
Thirdly, let us note, seeing that the scripture does attribute snares unto
death, that it is not in our power to deliver ourselves from death, no more
then it is in the power of a little bird to escape the net, when he is
entangled therein. Let us not boast ourselves therefore of our free will, as if
thereby we had the power to save ourselves. But when we drink of this spring
of life, that we taste and digest it, let us know that it comes because
that our Lord Jesus 1. Cor. 15. 55 Psalm. 124. 7. Ephe. 2. Titus. 3.
Christ has broken the bands of death. And therefore, let us confess this
grace, and say, Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fouler.
etc.

15 Good understanding makes acceptable: but the way of the disobedient is
hated.
When Solomon speaks thus, it is not to say that there is any evil
understanding: but he so speaks to distinguishe it from the same that the
world esteems so much, the which is but foolishness before God, and
consequently before them which are endued with the spirit of the Lord. This
he does also for to make us to love it, and to induce us to seek it, seeing
that naturally we love that which is good. Therefore when Solomon says, Good
understanding, etc. It is as much as if he did say, Take heed ye order not
your manners after the custom of them which think that they have
understanding before the world. It does nothing profit, but to puff up men,
and to cause them to despise their neighbors, and often to become angry and
envious. But give yourselues unto good wisdom and understanding which will not
swel nor contemn other: it makes the man of understanding, acceptable unto
his neighbors, whom he by his wisdom does admonish and comfort,
administering unto them the helps of salvation, Behold how good understanding
gets favor, as well to him that possesses it, as also to the neighbors
which are helped thereby either spiritually, or corporally. Both of these may
be seen in Joseph and in Moses. And to the end that we should know how
we ought to govern us after good understanding, Solomon does teach us
rightly wherein it consists, to wit, in faythfulnesse, uprightness and
truth, in gentleness, easiness and softness. We may understand this same
by the Antithesis, when he says,

But the way of the disobedient is hated. Against, good understanding, he
sets, the way of the unfaithful: and against grace or acceptance he
sets here sharpenes or hatred. Whereupon we may gather, what is meant by
good understanding and that they which are endued therewith, ought to be
acceptable unto their neighbors, seeing that they become tractable, and are at
their commandment in what soever they can, as God wills. Let us also note
that the unfaithful and disobedient can hardly counterfaite, for to be found
honestmen, and in the mean time to work the destruction of their neighbors.
And they which have to do with them, do find them hard, ungentle, stiff,
and cruel: and so their way is hard and hated both to them, and to their
neighbors, which do know their hypocrisy, dissimulation, and fayning:
albeit that they seem to be gentle, soft and gracious to the simple and
indiscreet, and to their like. As contrarily the men of understanding which
are soft and gracious to the^ which love wisdom, do seem hated, hard and
sharp unto mockars and contemners.

16 Every wise man will work by knowledge: but a fool will spread abroad
folly.
We have seen before, that the cra^tie or subtle man, does Prou. 12. 23.
hyde knowledge, whereupon it follows, that he is endued with knowledge: and
as he is indewed therewith, so does he also govern himself thereby.
Solomon does signify this guyding and government, when he says,

Every wise man will work by knowledge. This knowledge is not the same,
whereof Saint Paul speaks, knowledge puffs 1. Cor. 8. 1. Esaias. 11. 9.
up: but the same whereof Esaias speaks which will not hurt: for the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters that cover the sea.
Whereunto we are exhorted by Saint Peter: 2. Pet. 5. 5.
Join moreouervertue with your faith: and with virtue, knowledge, etc. Solomon
does well show us that he speaks of such knowledge, when he says, But a
fool will spread abroad folly. The foolish are deprived of this knowledge:
and therefore he shows his folly, proceeding in his affryres rashly,
without considering whither he do wrong to his neighbors or no: it is enough
for him to be seen and praised, and to gain something if it be posible:
neither does he care to be beloved, nor yet to love his neighbors, but is
ready rather to fight against them, if he think that they hinder him to come
to the end of his enterprises. Hereby we may know that there are very few
wise men in the world, and that it is filled with the foolish, not with such
as the worldlinges and carnal men do count fools (true it is there are
fools, about whom the mockers and iesters do take their pastime, and make
them, as it is said, may games: the world is but too full of such fools,) but
of such as are counted foolish, and are abhorred of the world, their number
is very small. Blessed are ye which suffer persecution for righteousness: etc.
Again, Blessed are Mat. 5. 11.
ye when men revile you, and persecute you. etc. Herein stands the true
wisdom, as Saint Paul does express, Let no man deceive himself. If any
man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him be a fool, that he
may be wise. They 1. Cor. 3. 18.
which follow these admonitions are the wise which rule themselves by
knowledge. And the great wise men of the world with their great train, are
but foolish, for the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God.

17 A wicked messenger falls into evil: but a faithful Ambassador is
preservation.
When Solomon sets A wicked messenger, against a faithful ambassador, he
teaches us wherein we may judge the messenger to be wicked, to wit, when he
does not give himself faithfully to do the message that he is sent for, and
to execute the office that is committed unto him. Solomon does threaten such a
messenger with the fall of evil, that is, he does foreshewe him a sharp and
hard punishment, as he does deserve by his infidelity and disobedience,
whereinto he throws himself headlong either by set malice, or by negligence
and contempt. And thus, there is a double fall: one, whereinto he falls
headlong himself, the which is cause of the second. We judge that messengers
or Ambassadors are wicked and disobedient, when they break or leave out any
part of the commission that is given unto them by their superiors and rulers,
and that rightly they are punished as traitors and unfaithful. By a far more
stronger reason then, they which are sent of God are to be counted disobedient
and traitors, when they neglect the message of their Lord: and consequently,
are very worthy to be grievously punished, the which they can by no means
avoid: as Solomon does signify it, when he says,

That A wicked messenger falls into evil. Amongst the messengers and
ambassadors of God in this world the principals, are Kings, Princes,
Magistrates, Pastors and Ministers of the Church: Wherein (if they do not
labor to do their Psalm. 2. 9. 12. and 82. 7. Wisd. 6. 6. Eze. 3. 17. and. 33.
8. and 34. 2.
message well) punishment is prepared. As it has been said, the wicked
messenger does well deserve to fall into evil: for also, as much as in him lies,
he hurts his neighbors: as Solomon does signify, saying. But a faithful
Ambassador is preservation. Forasmuch as he attributes preservation unto the
faithful Ambassador, he gives closely to understand, that the wicked
messenger brings death and is a murderer, for the which cause it is good
reason that he should fall into evil. The world is greatly filled with such
messengers, as we may see by the multitude of decrees and wicked judgments
that are pronounced and executed upon the innocents. Also we may see it by the
false doctrines which are sown by the hypocritical Friars of the Popish
Church. For to know that Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and Pastors of the
Church are messengers, let us note that a man is called a messenger, when he
is sent unto any place, for to do or say any thing: Whereupon it right well
follows that we may call Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and Ministers, the
messengers of God, for they are sent from him. And Saint Paul says that
powers are ordained of God. And the scripture does call them by a 1. Pet. 2.
14. Romans 13. 1. Psalm. 82. 6. 2. Cor. 5. 20. 1. Cor. 4. 2. 2. Cor. 6. 3. Mat.
24. 45. and 25. 14.
name, that signifies not only an Angel, but also God. Even so we call the
Ministers of the word, the messengers of God: for they are sent for to carry
the message of reconciliation: in this ministry, they ought to behave
themselves faithfully and without offense. And consequently al faithful men,
every one according to the charge which is committed to him, ought to behave
themselves faithfully, with care and diligence, otherwise, we fall first into
corporal evil, and afterward, into everlasting evil. Contrarily, they which
have faithfully executed their office: as they are healthful and serve for
preservation to the^ unto whom they do service, even so also they themselves
shall obtain health and preservation: they shall not fall into evil, but shall
prosper. Solomon does signify this same, saying, A faithful Ambassador is
preservation. We do very willingly receive and welcome and honor a good
Physician, by whose art and science we obtain health: we show him a
cheereful countenance, and if we be able we will give him gifts and
presents, and do wish him felicity and prosperity. Therefore when Solomon
does attribute preservation or health unto the faithful Ambassador, he
closely promises him that he shall not fall into evil: but that God will keep
and save him. And therewith also he shows how the faithful Ambassador,
ought to be received of men, yea with greater affection then the best
Physician of the world: because that the spiritual health is more precious and
excellent then the preservation and health of the body. The Physicians of the
body do so much as they can, to heal the bodies for a certain space of time:
but the preservation and health that the faithful Ambassadors do bring,
brings continual and everlasting life, if by faith and obedience we receive
their embassage. Now as there are few which gladly receive the faithful
ambassador, even so there are few which are preserved and have health in
their souls: the fault whereof lies not in the faithful ambassadors. The
worldlings do not feel their sickness and disease, and therefore they refuse
the faithful ambassadors, and so are lost: and so much as in them lies, they
make the messengers fall into evil, and no thank to them, that they become not
wicked and infidels. But albeit that the faithful ambassadors do bring
preservation and health, yet ought they to acknowledge and confess that they
are nothing but organes and instruments, and that there is but one Physician
Jesus Christ: of whose office look Malachie chapter, 4. 2. Mala. 4. 2.


18 Poverty and shame is to him that refuses instruction: but he that
regards correction, shall be honored.
We do naturally fear poverty, and would not be made a shame and reproach,
but do greatly desire to abound in wealth, to be praised and honored. But we
know not how to govern ourselves for to fly and avoid that which we fear,
and to obtain that which we would have. And therefore our good God knowing what
is needful for us, and willing our good more then we ourselves, has by Solomon
taught us the way and means, to attain to the true riches and honors. Now
again he teaches us the same. First of al, by a threatening, Pro. 1. 8. and 3
9. 10. and 4. 1. and. 8. 10. 11. 32
saying, Poverty and shame is to him that refuses instruction. But the
worldlings and carnal men do nothing but mock at such threatenings: as they
when they contemn the preaching of the word, when they reject al
instructions, and say that we must turn our back unto GOD for to come to
wealth and riches. The Lord knows well a fit and meet time to fulfill his
threatninges, making such riches to come to nothing, delivering them to thieves
and robbers, orelse to consume them by law, or by some other disorder and evil
government: and thus he brings the contemners of his word, which had a
worldly heart, and was lifted up in pride, unto poverty, beggerie and extreme
necessity: and in this manner he brings them to shame, and are counted vile
and contemptible, even abominable. If we do fear to be threaned, and that
in stead of refusing instruction, we take instruction, admonition, correction
and reprehension thankefully, poverty and shame shall fly far from us, and
we shall have whatsoever is expedient and necessary for us. Solomon does
signify it by a promise contrary unto the former threatening, when he
says, but he that regards correction, shall be honored. When he sets
regarding of correction, against refusing of instruction, he does teach us
that to regard correction, is to become attentive, and to delight in the
admonitions, instructions, and corrections, that GOD gives us by his word,
even in the chastenings and afflictions that he sends us: according as we
are admonished. Thus doing, we shall not want that which we need: Heb. 12.
5. Ia. 1. 2. 12.
seeing that GOD does offer himself unto us as to his children, and does
accept us for such, he does honor us, and will for ever honor us: Blessed is
the man which abides temptation, etc. And when he places honor, against
poverty and shame, he gives us to understand that, to honor, is not a
courtely reverence with cap and knee, as s done unto great Lords: but to be
honored, is to be well counted of, and to have his neighbors at his
commandment, and to want nothing but that which may well be forborne, and
which comes not to a good end. To honor, is taken in this signification. If
ye will have Exo. 20. 1^. 1. Tim. 5. 3.
examples of them which have refused instruction, we will set Caine, the
world destroyed by the flood, Pharao, the sons of Ely, Saul and Judas. And
they which regarded correction, were Abraham, Moses, David, Job, Ezechias, the
Prophets, and Apostles. We see by these examples what poverty and misery
does come unto those which refuse to receive the word, for to learn to
repent and amend their life: Moreover we see also what shame they have
gotten. Therefore let us know, that if we follow them, we shall come to the
like state. That we may avoid the same, let us labor to follow these good
fathers, which have been so famous and renoumed: and we shall be their
fellows, and partakers with them of one glory. And Saint Paul says, But Romans
2. 10. ^
to every man that does good shall be glory, and honor, and peace, to the Jew
first, and also to the Grecian. And to them which seek eternal life, glory,
honor, and immortality of well doing. Let us therefore take heed how we
harden ourselves against the spur, and kick against the prick: let us not
despise the riches of Gods goodness, etc. For to accomplish it well, let us not
desire to have Ministers which will spare us, and flatter us, speaking sweet
and pleasant things to our fleshly desire, and human reason: but rather let
us pray unto GOD that he would give us ministers whose mothes he has
touched, as he did to Jeremy, that they may fear nothing, but that boldly
they would follow the commandment, Iere. 1. 9. Esaias. 58. 1.
Cry aloude, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people
their trangression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

19 A desire accomplished delights the soul: but it is an abomination to
fools to depart from evil.
When the wicked and ungodly think and judge that they have and enjoy their
pleasures and desires, they leap for joy and exceed in all dissolutions and
insolences. I say expressly, when they think and not when they have: since
that all their desires are wicked, the Lord does not suffer them altogether to
enjoy them, as they would have them. For with an unbridled license they would
take and give leave to themselves to do as they would even to hurt an annoy
the innocents: and so the poor faithful ones which are weak in comparison of
them, should have no rest nor peace. They would bring the Church of God to
nothing, and would spoil him of his kingdom: And as they have not the full
possession of their desires, even so also their souls have not the true joy,
though they do dissolutely rejoice. If their souls had the true joy, they
should have peace and quietness: the which they neither have nor never Esaias. 57.
20. Psalm. 37. 12.
shall have: for the wicked are as the raging Sea, which cannot rest. The
wicked practices against the just, and gnasheth his teeth against 1. Sam. 9. 2.
him. A man might have well said of Saul whilst he was king, that he had,
as a man might say, more then his soul could desire, considering the degree
whereunto he was called in the kingdom. Also a man might have said that
Absalom the son of king David, had what his soul could desire, seeing he had
the heart ^. Sam. 15. 1.
of the people, in his fathers life time. But these people here (as we may see
by their proceeding) as they have not had their desire accomplished, even so
have they not had joyful souls: as their sorrowful and miserable end has well
showed it. The desires of such and of their like tended to nothing but to evil
and hurt: and therefore they came not to the end of their enterprises. The
Lord breaks Psalm. 33. 10. and 112. 10.
the counsel of the heathen, and brings to naught the devises of the people.
The wicked shall see it and be angry: he shall gnashe with his teeth and
consume away, the desire of the wicked shall perish. Moreover Solomon does not
here speak of the desire of the wicked, when he says.

A desire accomplished, delights the soul: He himself does show it by
the Antithesis, saying, but it is abomination to fools, etc. We may see that
he speaks here of the desires, thoughts, enterprises, and deliberations of
the wise, just, and faithful men, who desire above al things that God should
have his kingdom in them and reign in them. And to attain to this, they
labor to cast of al infidelity and incredulity, al superstition and
ydolatrie, and al evil affections against their neighbors, that they may walk
in righteousness and innocence according as Saint Paul does admonish us. The
Lord hears such desires and thoughts: Lord, thou hear the desires of the
humble, etc. In the fulfilling of these Ephe. 4. 24. and 5. 1. Col. 3. 8. Psalm.
10. 17. and 37. 3. 4.
desires, the faithful have their delight. Put thou thy trust in the lord and
be doing good: dwell in the land, and verily thou shall be fed. Delight
thou in the Lord: and he shall give thee thy hearts desire. Moreover the
saints being under affliction, desire that it may please God to give them some
ease, and to deliver them: as it is seen by their prayers and complaints
whereof the scripture is full. Amongst others: Turn thee again (O Lord) at the
last: and be gracious unto thy servants. And when they feel that God is
merciful Psalm. 90. 19. and 94. 17.
to them according to their desire, they are pleased: If the Lord had not
helped me: it had not failed but my soul had been put to silence. This sense
is true, but the first agrees better with the Antithesis to wit, that God
delighted in the souls of the wise, just and faithful men, when they are not
overcome of the temptation, which does stir them to evil, but putting their
trust in the only Lord, do give themselves to well doing. Solomon does well
show that he means thus, when he says, A desire accomplished delights
the soul. He adds against it, But it is an abomination to fools to depart
from evil. He shows that the foolish have neither fear of God, nor reverence
to his word: that they have no desire to do well, but do hate goodness and
them which follow it: they love wickedness and them which assist them to
continue therein, and are companions with them in the same. We may plainly see
this in the ydolaters and superstitions of the Papists, we may see it
accomplished in the wicked, which pass nothing at all to committee wickedness
without number, and do think and pronounce them to be ignorant and without
understanding which do not as they do * we may see it in the persecutors of
the faithful, which do think they offer sacrifice and an acceptable work
unto GOD, when they slay the innocent. In this sentence is the promise of
eternal life enclosed, which is the perfection of their delight which have
truly set their affections and desires to do good: And thus we are closely
exhorted here to follow that which S. Paul Romans 13. 12. Gala. 5. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. Tit. 2. 11. 1. Pet. 1. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 11. and 4. 1.
does exhort us to do: let us then cast away the works of darkness, etc. But I
say unto you, walk according to the spirit, etc. This is the will of God, etc.
The grace of God which brings salvation to al men has appeared, and teaches
us, that we should deny ungodliness, etc. Wherefore girde up the loins of
your mind, etc. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which fight against the soul, etc. For as much as
Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselues likewise with the
same mind, etc. Thus doing we have life everlasting. There is then no
condemnation unto them that are in Jesus Christ, which walk not after the
flesh, but after the spirit, Romans 8. 1. 6.
etc. Again, For the wisdom of the flesh is death: but the wisdom of the
spirit, is life and peace, etc. In the second member of this sentence is the
threatening of death and eternal damnation Psalm. 5. 5.
threatened.

20 He that walks with the wise, shall be wise: but a companion of fools
shall be afflicted.
There are some madbraines which desire not to be wise, and judge it nothing
but heavy study to learn wisdom: and therefore will hear no counsel: they
scorn at al admonitions, and refuse al corrections, and instructions, because
they would pass the time merrily, and live joyfully. But if we have any
spark of good understanding and sound judgment, if we had a settled and
stablished brain, we would highly praise wisdom, and desire to be
partakers thereof. And because for all the desire that we have thereunto, we
know not how to attain it, Solomon has often and diverse times exhorted us
to hear, and to receive her words, her commandementes, instruction, counsel
and correction. And not content heerewith, he does instruct us what our
conversation ought to be for to obtain wisdom, when he says, He that
walks with the wise, etc.

Let us know that he does not here promise, that if we dwell in one
country or house with the wise, we shall be come wise. We have at all times
seen the contrary in diverse, and so we may see it still. But he promises us,
that if we willingly do hear the wise, and receive into our hearts that which
they teach and instruct us, and that their company does not grieve us, but
shall seek it without dissimulation, that we shalbecome wise, if we keep
company, be friends, and acquainted with the wise, and if we shall love their
doctrine, and that we labor to be like unto them. It is better for us to
become the Scholars and Disciples of the wise, then Esaias. 5. 21. and 2. 14. 15.
18.
theirs of whom Esaias speaks. Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes,
and prudent in their own sight. If we become the Scholars of such men, we
shall have no understanding, and shall loose the company of the wise, we shall
learn of them nothing but pride and hypocrisy: through the which we shall
become accursed. And since that in this estate we are execrable, we cannot but
look for grievous affliction, from the which the scholars of the wise shall be
exempted, as Solomon does closly signify it, when he adds but a companion of
fools shall be afflicted. We must take heed^ from judging after the sight of
our eyes. For seeing what happens daily in the world, we cannot condescend unto
the opinion of Solomon. Fools have the rule of the world and do prosper
therein: they have their ease, delights and pleasures: they have glory and
honor: they are in credit and authority, and abound in wealth: and
contrarily wise men want all these. Therefore we must open the eyes of our
faith, for to see and know that the felicity of fools is of small continuance:
as has been often showed, and that great destruction is prepared for them,
from the which they cannot escape. Co^trarily, let us know that the sufferings
of this present life are not worthy of the glory to come. Therefore let us not
faint, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed daily.
Romans 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 16.
When we were yet Papists we were the^ fellows with fools, who led us to
destruction for to be afflicted everlastingly: but now that the Lord has
delivered us from this hellishe company, and has called us into the society
of his Church, it is our own fault, if we do not walk with the wise.
Furthermore, they which have some charge, or degree ought to learn to be wise,
that their inferiors and underlings, their subjects and servants which are
under their subjection and government, may become wise, and that both
publicly and privately in houses and families, wisdom might shine, and
foolishness be rooted out. For as of foolishness we learn nothing but
evil, so there can happen nothing but evil to them that follow it. Wherefore,
let every man take heed to himself, and that he do not lightly take
familiarity and acquaintance with all men indifferently: but that we labor to
join ourselves with the best, by the company whereof we may profit in
goodness, and we may be made better in thought, desire and affection, in
manners, works and words. As Ionathas by the acquaintance and familiarity
he had with David, changed his manners to better: And king Roboam by walking
with his young counselors, became worse. For to take our profit of this present
sentence, let us remember what is written: Be not deceived: evil words
corrupt good manners. Be not unequally yoked with the infidels: for what
fellowship 1. Cor. 15. 33 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 3.
has righteousness with unrighteousness? But fornication, and al
uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named amongst you, as it
becomes saints. etc.

21 Al affliction follows sinners, but unto the righteous God will recompense
good.
The wicked do think, when they do any thing secretly, or when they color
their malice for to hyde it, that none does see them: and therefore do hope
that no evil shall happen unto them: and though they commit evil openly, yet
because of their credit and power, they think that nothing shall hurt them,
and labor to make themselves believe it is lawful for them to do what they
list: and for this cause think to be out of al danger. Against this false
Psalm. 12. 5. and 64. 6. and 99. 3. Esa. 28. 14. 15 Leu. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
and vain opinion, Solomon pronounces, That al affliction follows sinners.
And this agrees with the threateninges of the law. True it is, that according
to the outward appearance and sight of the eyes, we see not always these
threatenings executed: for the Lord does dissemble for a certain time, and in
the mean while, the wicked insleede of returning by repentance, do harden
themselves and wax obstinate in evil, and insteede of humbling themselves by
weeping and lamenting, they rejoice and are merry, seeing themselves to triumph
and prosper, and to have rule in the world. But after some dissembling and
forbearing, the Lord puts his threateninges in execution: as the children of
Israel felt it in the wilderness, and in the land of Canaan: so also have
many wicked men felt it, and do still feel it. And David also does well show,
that Psalm. 37. ^. Esaias. 5. 18.
affliction does follow the sinner: and Esai, Woe unto them, that draw
iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin, as with Carte ropes. Wherefore let
the faithful take heed from envying the prosperity of the wicked, but be
given unto goodness. And although it seems to be in vain that they labor
to do well, because of the great and multitude of miseries that they suffer,
and that it seems also, how God persecuteth the^ to destroy and condemn
them, yet their well doing shall be recompensed, for God will reward and recompense
them. We have examples thereof in Abel, Abraham, Leui. 26. Deuteronomy. 28. Psalm. 18.
17
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Daniel, Job, etc. We have the promises thereof: and
David does witness the same of himself. And now Solomon promises the like,
saying, But unto the righteous God will recompense good. Let us take good heed
from thinking of any merit, or to conceive that by our righteousness we can
bind God to yield unto us the good that he owes us: for it is impossible
that he should owe us any thing. If a servant or a slave that is bought with
the money of his Lord, doing all the will and commandment of his master, can
not bind him to recompense him, much less can we merit toward our Lord,
we which are redeemed not with corruptible things. Let us look upon the
similitude of the servant returning from his labor. And if the lawful 1. Pet.
1. 18. 19 Luke. 17. 7.
and natural child cannot bind his father to give him any recompense of his
labors, although they be great, what can we deserve of our heavenly father,
who by his only grace has elected us before the foundation of the world,
and has predestined Ephe. 1. 5. John. 15. 5. Phil. 2. 13.
us for to adopt us unto himself by Jesus Christ, according unto the good
pleasure of his will? And if without Jesus Christ we can do nothing: and that
it is God that woorketh in us both the will and the deed even of his good will:
what can we pretend? Wherefore let us humble ourselves: and when it is said
that God will recompense: let us know that that which is recompensed, is not
always dew, be it good or bad: as when we say, he has paid me ill for
good, and contrarily, he has done to his enemies good for evil. Now if we
speak thus, we ought to understand that God ought to have this credit with us
of speaking of his gifts and graces in this manner, neither ought we to think
it strange: neither ought we to wax proud for this kind of speech, but to
acknowledge that God of his only grace and mercy does recompense his
righteousness in us, wherewith he has endued us, and whereby he has done good
works. And let us learn that the good which God does unto us after our good
works, is called, reddition, payement or rendering again, recompense, or
reward, because it comes after, and not that our works are the cause
thereof. We may now well understand that the Papists cannot allege this text
nor any other like too it for to build their merits, and that they are
deceived through their pride. First of al in this that they would have good
works to make a good man, as if the tree ought not first to be Mat. 7. 17. and
12. 33.
good, before it can bring forth good fruit. Secondly, in this that they
attribute goodness and righteousness unto the works which are nothing but
abomination before God, and are worthy of eternal fire. Thirdly, in this that
they would make God for such works to stand bound to give them Paradise,
from the which they go backward, and fall into hell. That is, as if a subject
committed the horriblest injuries that he could against his Prince, to welcome
him home, and yet would bind him to raise him up to honor, and to make him
rich.

22 The good man shall give inheritance unto his childre^s children: and the
riches of the sinner is laid up for the just.
It is commonly said that the third heir shall never enjoy those goods that are
wickedly gotten. And forasmuch as we desire that our successors, children, and
cozens should possess those goods that we shall leave them, we must if we will
get goods, get them without overmuch covetousness, and without a desire to
enrich ourselves. If 1. Tim. 6. 6. Heb. 13. 5.
we do labor for them, let us do it without desire to hurt or hinder our
neighbor, and let that which we possess, be holden with good conscience,
being ready to distribute gladly of our riches unto the needy, and also to
forsake them, where it shall be needful for the service, honor, and glory of
God, and to the edification and preservation of our neighbor. Thus doing, our
goods shall not wastefully be consumed, but both we and ours shall have a
sufficient abundance. Solomon does promise us this same, saying, The good man
shall give inheritance unto his childrens children. Although there is none good
but God only, yet the scriptures fails not to call him good, which God makes
partaker of his goodness, giving unto him a right spirit, a sound and perfect
conscience, and a good affection to his neighbors, causing him to hate and
abhor al covetousness, spoiling, usury, fraud, disceit and wicked trades:
making him gentle, liberal, merciful and helpeful toward them which have
need. The man that is such an one, shall obtain this blessing of God, that his
children and cozins shall be his heirs. The like blessing was promised unto
Abraham and unto the other Patriarchs, unto David, and unto al servants of
God: I say expressly Gene. 12. 2. and 13. 15. and 15. 1. 1^ Psalm. 132. 1^ and
102. 2^.
that the good shall obtain a blessing of God: for albeeit it is said, He shall
give: yet it is not to say, that it is in his power, or that he can do it of
himself: but because that God has given him wealth and also given him grace
to use them soberly without wasting, the scripture does attribute to him, that
he gives: and that as a minister and instrument of GOD: for that which is
attributed unto him, is the gift of God. Let us not then follow the arrogancy
of the rich worldlings, which boast of making their children rich: but if we
be rich, let us acknowledge that it belongs unto GOD to give our children the
possession of them after us. If he does reign over the kingdoms of men,
much more over that which is of farrelesse importance. And albeit that diverse
children Dan. 4. 14.
do not enjoy their fathers riches, yet nevertheless cease not the present
promise to be true, and have his effect. But forasmuch as it is said, The good
man shall give inheritance, etc. Let us know, that that which hinders
children to inherit, is, either that the father was not good, though he
appeared so before the world, or if he were good, that his children do not
follow his goodness: and so before God are not counted the seed of the good
man: And therefore rightly does God deprive them of the inheritance, giving
them over to be spoiled, or unto excessive expenses, and unto evil
government. Let us therefore follow goodness, and we shall not want an
inheritance. The meek, (as David says) shall possess the earth, etc. The
Lord knows the days of the righteous, Psa. 37. 11. 18 25. and 112. 1.
etc. Blessed is the man that fears the Lord, etc. The Lord does truly
perform his promises unto his elect and faithful, that they should not want
to perish. And by his free and liberal blessing, and by his fatherly care he
so provides for the families of his, that before they have need, he spoyleth
the wicked of the goods they occupy, or that they should enjoy according to
the world, and does give them unto his servants. Solomon does signify it, when
he says, and the riches of the sinner is laid up for the just. Gene. 15. 5.
and 17. 8. and 12. 17. and 25. 23. 1. Sam. 13. 13. 14. and 15. 11. and 16. 12.
The Lord does show this kindness unto Abraham, Behold the heaven, etc.
After the order of nature, Esau should have been his brother Jacobs Lord and
master, and have had the eldership: but God kept it for they youngest and
least. Saul was elected king over Israel, but for his foolishness and
wickedness he was rejected of God, and David anointed king. After this, we
may first note, that what labor or care soever we take for the well disposing
and ordering of our goods, and to keep them, yet is it not in our power to
hold and keep them, for to give and bestow them upon our children and
nephews. The blessing of God is necessary and required therein, without the
which we do but loose our labor to study to win any thing. And therefore
let us not trust to our counsel, study and travail: but we must confess
that both Psalm. 127. 1.
corporal and temporal riches are the gifts of GOD, and also the possession of
the inheritance and holding thereof. Our Lord Jesus Christ does well show it,
when he does teach us to ask of our father, Give us this day our daily
bread. We may learn then to ask of him that it may please him to keep and
preserve them for us. And if he suffer us to be spoiled of them, let us know
that he does it not without good and reasonable causes: that is, either for
our sin, or to prove our patience, or for to teach us too know that we
must not stay ourselves upon worldly riches.

Secondly, we must note, that it is lawful for fathers and mothers too keep
and lay up in store some riches for their children: but they must also be
careful too fly couetuousnesse. Thirdly, seeing that the earth, and the
contents thereof is the Lords, therefore 1. Tim. 6. 7. 2. Cor. 8. 7. and 9. 6.
Heb. 13. 5. Psalm. 24. 1. Tit. 1. 15.
it follows that sinners have nothing in the world that properly belongs
unto them, nor unto those which use the goods of this world with a wicked
conscience. And therefore when Solomon does attribute any wealth unto the
sinner, either he speaks improperly, or after the judgment of the world,
which esteem the riches to belong unto them which do enjoy them upon the
same title, to wit, that they are without fault before men. Fourthly, albeit
that the land is reserved for the just, yet is it not lawful for the good and
just to take and use at their pleasure what the wicked do enjoy and possess,
except they have express commandment from the Lord, as when he ordained
that the people Exodus 11. 2. and 12. 35. Deuteronomy. 1. 7.
of Israel should enter into the land of Canaan for to possess and inherit it.

23 Much food is in the field of the poor: but the field is destroyed without
discretion.
There is none of us but does naturally desire to have abundance of victual,
for to keep both ourselves and our family from poverty and beggerie. We are
very glad when we see fruitful seasons, and are partakers thereof: but it is
not enough too desire the same, as Solomon does show it us: for we may see
that he shows Prou. 4. and 12. 11.
therewith what we must do for to get food, as he had done before. Now that
we may profitably till our land, and get food for to refreshe us, he
teaches us what we should be, when he says, Much food is in the field
of the poor.

If we will get much food, we must then become poor. This saying will be
judged to be very strange at the first sight: for we can not desire to be
poor, because we see oftentimes, yea daily, how hardly the poor live, and
suffer great scarcity. Again, the covetous and usurers, the rich worldlings,
and thieves which are like unto insatiable gulfes, will mock at this, hearing
say that we must become poor to obtain much food But when we shall
understand in what sense Solomon speaks of the poor, we will not think
this sentence strange, and shall know that indeed we must become poor to
obtain much food: and if the poor were not, all the world should smart for
it. By the poor: Solomon does not understand them which are destitute of al
worldly riches.

Such kind of people do labor only for other, and that which they do, is
not called their labor, but theirs which did set them on work and hyre them,
and pay them for their daily labor or taskes. But in this place the poor are
such as do not think themselves so rich that they can pass without labor,
and live ydlely: they set not so much store by themselves, but that they will
abase themselves to do even the vilest office that we can think of: so that in
doing thereof, they may not be unprofitable. Of such kind of poor did
Solomon speak. In the field of such people, there is oftentimes much food:
for God blesses their labor, giving them enough, and a contented mind, which
is more then the great abundance of such as are proud and swollen with Pro.
12. 9.
their riches, and makes no account to set themselves on work. For a
certain time their provisions shall abound in their houses, but afterward
God blows upon their riches, and they vanishe away.

Contrarily, such are the poor, that they are contented with a little, and
travel duly and orderly about that which they possess, and take not in hand
more then they can do, knowing that he which gripeth too much, can not long
time hold it. The labor of such kind of people is oftentimes very
fruitful, and brings forth much, though there is no great boast of it: for
it is done in time and season.

Behold, how there is much food in the field of the poor Contrarily, when
a man takes in hand very much, and more then he can, his labor must
needs perish, seeing he can not do it in due time. Solomon does well
express it, when he says, But the field is destroyed without discretion.
This needs no exposition, seeing it is known by experience: yet
notwithstanding, the want of discretion may be found not only where more is
taken in hand then can be done, but also there where through negligence men
make not account to set themselves on work, and are very glad to do
nothing, but are delighted in idleness and slothfulness. There the field
which should be well tilled, is lost: and that whereof he should raise
profit, is unprofitable: and so such have not much food, but scarcity and
poverty, according to the former threatening. Every one of us in our estate
and calling are here exhorted to labor, if we will have much food. Pro. 6. 10.
11.
For by the labor of the poor, Solomon signifies all kind of work and
labor, which is done with care and diligence. But seeing that spare diet,
fasting, abstinence, and sobriety, are greatly commended in the Scripture,
some will ask, whither it is lawful to desire abundaunce of victual, and to
take much thereof or no? I answer, That it is lawful for us to desire that
which God does promise unto us by his Word: but it is not lawful for us to
burn with covetousness, neither that we should be like unto gluttons, and
drunkardes, which the more they eat and drink, do more desire the same, and
are never satisfied. It is lawful for us to desire that God would give us
fruitful seasons, and to bless our labor and travel, that we may have
profit thereby, and not to travel in vain: and that our desires should not
tend to enrich ourselves, nor to fill us and stuff our bellies with excess:
but of the provisions and gain that God shall send us, we would desire to
be good disposers and Stewardes, and would take pain to do it.

In this manner we shall have enough, in the which chiefly consists the
abundaunce of victuals, when it is conjoined together with a contented mind.

Secondly, we are exhorted to be co^te^t with our estate, when God does allow
the same, since it is said that the poor have much food by their labor, It
commonly happens that they that are contented with a little, do live much
more at their ease then do they which are rich.

24 He that spares his rod, hates his son: but he that loves him,
chasteneth him betimes.
Behold this is a lesson which pleases neither children, nor fools, which
have need of correction: and yet it is profitable for them, yea more necessary
then either meat or drink, wherein they are greatly delighted, and do serve
to strengthen the person. When we are young and foolish, given unto vain
desires and worldly and carnal pleasures, we cannot delight to learn this
lesson, neither can we hear that children should be corrected: but when we
are come to age, though we be not instructed in the Gospel, yet if we have any
spark of good natural judgment, we understand then that it is needful for
children to be corrected, and do commend and praise our parents for that they
did not suffer us to live as we listed: and also there are some which can
heavily lament and complain that their parents have spared them too much, and
have borne too much with their follies and frowardness of their youth, and
for this cause, if they have any children, they chasten them, as they see to be
necessary and expedient for them. The very heathen and Turks do know this:
and there are some which will boast to be reformed after the Gospel, and yet
notwithstanding they will neglect to chastise the follies, insolences and
frowardness of their children, and will not suffer them too be beaten with
rods, as is necessary: but rather they will hate the Schoolemaisters that shall
correct them: and will be ready to revile them, insteede that they should love
them and thank them, and also too pray them to chasten their children sharply
in good time for to save them from the gallows: for it happens oftentimes
that the hangman does handle and execute them which have not been corrected by
their Parents in their youth. Wherefore let those fathers and mothers which
love the welfare honor and salvation of their children (or do think to love
them) learn here to correct them in good time: otherwise, so far is it of,
that they love them indeed, that they rather hate them: and consequently, are
murderers of their children: for whosoever hates his brother, is a murderer.
1. Ioh. 3. 15.
And forasmuch as neither father nor mother would be counted murderers of
their children, but contrarily, would give them their blood, if their children
had need of it: seeing it is thus, I say, the parents must be careful to
correct and chastise their children betimes. Likewise, Kings, Princes,
Magistrates, and Judges of the earth, which should be the fathers of the
people committed to their charge, if they love their subjects, they will be
careful and diligent to chasten the foolish, wicked, and dissolute.

Moreover, when the Ministers of the word do by it engender and get sons
and daughters, they also are as fathers to the people committed unto them,
whom they ought to love, and to show them their love by admonitions,
instructions, corrections, and threatenings. But for to return unto carnal and
natural fathers, of whom Solomon does heree chiefly speak, when he says,
He that spares his rod, etc. For here he teaches fathers of housholdes
how they ought to govern their children for to make them wise, sober, modest,
humble and good) there is here also an hard point to be resolved: That is,
that it may seem that Saint Paul repugneth this sentence, when he says,
Fathers provoke not your children to anger. Ephe. 6. 4. Collo. 3. 21.


Again, Ye fathers, anger not your children. For there is nothing that the
children do hate more then the rod, nor wherewith they are more provoked and
angered, then when they are beaten with the rod, and be made to feel it, so
that if they durst, or were able, they would rise up and withstand their
parents, or masters, when they correct them. This is the solution of the
former doubt. Let us know, that Saint Paul does not forbid fathers that they
should not correct their children with rods, but as it might seem by this,
that Saint Paul exhorts children to give obedience unto their parents, he
speaks chiefly unto fathers which have children, and are not disobedient, nor
dissolute, nor rebellious, nor contemners: but with humility, fear, and
reverence, endeavor to please their parents, and to be at their commandment.
For we shall see some fathers so sharp, churlish, cruel, severe, ungentle, and
intractable, which will not cease to beat and vex their children which
endeavor to yield their duty. Saint Paul would not have Christian fathers to
be such toward their children which do their duty, neither also toward
them which err: and yet notwithstanding, he means not that they should not
be corrected: as he shows, when he says, But bring them up in
instruction, and information of the Lord. Likewise when Solomon would have
the child to be corrected, he means not that his body should be always
beaten with a ^od, but that we should use exhortations, corrections,
instructions and threatenings: he means chiefly, we should not spare such
kind of rods.

Moreover let us note, that al inferiors and underlings ought to suffer their
superiors with humility, patience, and obedience. And if we ought to behave
ourselves thus toward men, by a more strong reason, toward God: as it is
largely handeled in the 12. Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

25 The righteous eats to the contentation of his mind: but the belly of
the wicked shall want.
A man that is instructed in the word of GOD, which labors to cleave
theretoo by Faith, that he may be assured of the goodness of the Lord
toward him, in woorshipping him, calling upon him, praising and giving
thanks unto him for all things: and also which labors by true repentance
to follow his commandments, that he may govern himself toward his
neighbors with unfeigned love, and to edify them, in holding the true
religion, and yet for all this, prayseth himself never the more, but depending
wholly upon the grace of God, looks for his mercy only: this man is a
righteous man, and is never forsaken of God, but obteineth of him that which
he wishes and desires: so that he wants nothing that he can desire,
Solomon does signify it when he says, The righteous eats to the
contentation of his mind. He says this, following therein the commandment of
the law and the promises of God, let no man deceive his neighbor, etc. The
desires of such kind of people are not outrageous, but are contented Leui. 25.
17. and 26. 24. Deuteronomy. 28. 3. Psalm. 37. 3. and 145. 14.
with a little, which is more worth then the great superfluity of the wicked.
Then let us not think that they resemble and are like unto gluttons and
drunkardes, which know not when they be full, til their beilie pincheth them
and swells: nor to wicked covetous men, usurers and thieves, which are never
satisfied. And therefore albeit that after the outward appearance these wicked
men have something to eat, and do abound therein, yet ought we not to be
abashed though Solomon says, But the belly of the wicked shall want. This is
according to the threatenings of God. The wicked do not fear such
threateninges, because they see the present Leui. 26. Deu. 28. Psalm. 37.
prosperity, by reason whereof they think that no evil can happen to them.
But God knows well how to execute his word: as it has been and is daily
seen. For experience teaches that those which give themselves to serve their
belly as it desires, many times become poor, and want to sustain themselves.
There Luke. 15. 13.
is an other sort of wicked men which do not so much desire to devour meat
and to swil in drink, as they are to desire, togather, and to spare money, for
fear, that the earth should fail them: as are the covetous and usurers for
the most part. The fear of such men shall fall upon them: for either they are
consumed by law, or else are robbed and spoiled: and so their belly wants,
the which comes either because they dare not spend, or by law and theeuerie
which brings them to beggerie. If they feel it not here, yet can they not
avoid it: God knows well how to find them out in time.

Moreover let us note first of al, that it is lawful for faithful men, and
Christians, to eat their fill, seeing that God does permit it Luke. 12. 2^
and 16. 23. Esaias. 65. 13.
them, as well in his law, as here, and in Esaias: but it is not to say, that
they should eat till they burst, as do insatiable bellies, which when they
are filled desire nothing but too sleep, leap or dance after their gluttonye
and drunkenness making themselves unprofitable unto al good works. We must
so eat to the contentation of our minds, that the meats and drinks may not
hinder us to do our office, but may be made more nimble and more strong, and
better disposed to do our duty. We shall then have more care to feed our
bodies, to sustain them therewith that we may be occupied in our calling, then
to satisfy the greedy desire of our flesh. And as we ought to abhor
gluttony and drunkenness, and to be sober and temperate: even so must we
take heed to be like unto them which for want of taking (with thanksgiving)
the meat that God gives us, and that are necessary for us, we become not
slouthful and unprofitable in well doing. Truly in such things there is a
certain kind of wisdom. We should therefore take our daily nourishement,
acknowledging and confessing that God makes grass to grow for the cattle,
and green herb for the service of men: That he may bring food out of the
earth, Col. 2. 23. Psa. 104. 14. 15
and wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make him a cheereful
countenance, and bread to strengthen man's heart. Secondly, let us note that
what promises soever GOD makes unto his faithful children of temporal goods,
that nevertheless he would not have them to set, and fix al their mind
upon them and to be tied to them, seeing he does exercise them by diverse
tribulations: but does tend to make them aspire and lift up their minds unto
the spiritual and eternal refreshing and contentation.

Contrarily, forasmuch as he counts the wicked unworthy of temporal riches,
as he declares by his threateninges, they ought not to look to be partakers
of the heavenly and eternal riches, the which are infinitely and far more
excellent then all that we can have and desire in this world. Thirdly, let us
note that forasmuch as of our corrupt nature we are all wicked, and worthy
to perish with hunger and by eternal death, that therefore by this promise
and threatening we are exhorted to convert unto GOD by faith and repentance.
Fourthly, let us not be like unto the infidells and idolaters, which do
attribute sterilitie and scarcity unto the children of GOD, but beholding the
unseasonable times and hard years, in what sort so ever they come, let us
confess our faults, and accuse ourselves, and not our neighbors, what
wickedness soever is in them.

The xiiii. Chapter.
1 A Wise woman builds her house: but the foolish destroieth it with her own
hands.
WOmen which have any natural sense and wit, do desire that all things
should prosper in their houses, and that nothing should decay, nor want but
that al things should increase and be maintained for the entertaiment of
their house: and even there where all wants, they will labor so well with
their hands, that they will make a good and plentiful house, if it be possible.
But what desire soever they have, or what care soever they take to raise their
estate, yet come they not always well to pass. Our first mother Eve has
proved it. It is not then enough Genesis 3. 6.
to desire, and to labor, but to come unto our desires and enterprises, we
must eschew and fly folly, abhor it, and be indewed with wisdom. Solomon
does signify it, saying: A wise woman. etc. Now if a woman must be wise for
to build her house, it follows that the number of them which build, is very
small, seeing that it is very hard to find a wise woman. I have found one man
of a thousand: but a woman among them all have I not Eccle. 7. 3^.
found. He speaks thus for to show that wise women are scant, and not that
there are none at al: for we find that the Scripture does attribute wisdom
unto some women: as unto Sara, to Abigaile, to Debora. If the women and
daughters of this age will be fellows Heb. 11. 11. 1. Pet. 3. 6 1. Sam. 25.
Judge. 4. 4.
and daughters of these holy women and other, they must labor to be wise, in
diligently resorting unto the sermons, and printing the pure word of God in
their hearts: for it is said, If thou receiuest my words. etc. Therefore
women and daughters must love the word of the Lord, and must give themselves
unto continual Pro. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 1. Tim. 2. 3. 5 Ephe. 5. 22 1. Tim. 2.
9. and. 3. 11. and. 5. 4. Titus. 2. 3.
prayer. So doing they shall be such as Saint Paul requires them to be. If they
continewe and hold on in this, sort they shall waste nothing of their
household, but shall preserve them, and shall increase by the blessing of God, so
much as shall be expedient. And not only so, but also (which is more worth)
they shall build their houses with living stones, that they may be a spiritual
house, and an holy Priesthood. We al ought to endeavor to attain thereto,
that it may be said of us: ye are no more strangers and foreners, but
citizens with the saints: contrarily, if women be foolish, following their
own carnal nature, and committing foolish acts to the dishonor of God, and
to the slander of their family, they destroy and overthrow their housholdes,
not only in this that 1. Pet. 2. 5 Ephe. 2. 19
God does forsake them, for to bring al their temporal goods to disorder and
confusion, the which they scatter and waste in banketting and delicate fare, in
gay and gorgeous apparel, in plays and pastimes, and other dissolutions and
insolences: but also in this that they condemn themselves, and no thank to
them that their housholdes do not fall into eternal destruction. Solomon does
signify this same, when he says, But the foolish destroys it with her
own hands. For we ought too know that Solomon does in diverse sentences
instruct fathers and mothers of housholdes, for to teach them how they
should govern and guide their families temporally, and to defend the
necessities of this present life, as it is lawful for them, and as they ought
to do (as we may know by the promises of God, made unto the ancient
fathers, and by their complaints, and prayers unto God: and also when our
Lord teaches us to ask our daily bread) notwithstanding his principal mark,
whereto he tends, is that we should take care to provide for our spiritual
necessities and wants, and to build and erect up our houses in the heavens.
Thefore when he speaks here, of wise women, he means not such as are
esteemed so before the world, because they can richely make their temporal
profit of their house, preferring and setting it above the honor of God, and
the profit of their neighbors: but he speaks of them which first of al
seek the kingdom of God, and the righteousness^ thereof.

Such women have laid a good foundation, which is, Jesus Christ, and
therefore they make a goodly and pleasant building, and need not to fear that
their building should fall for want of a strong foundation: for they build
upon the strong rock, against the which the gates of hell shall not prevail.
Let us learn therefore that if our houses come to be overthrown, it is
because we build not upon this foundation, or that the stones that we will
lay are neither fit, nor meet for the work.

2 He that walks in his righteousness, fears the Lord: but he that is
lewd in his ways, despises him.
The Lord by his word does exhort us to fear him: Gather Deu. 4. 10. and
6. 13. and 10. 12.
me the people together, and I will cause them to hear my words, that they
may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth. Thou
shall fear the Lord thy God, etc. And this it is that he does chiefly
demand: as Moses declares. And now Israel, what does the Lord thy God
require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and
to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul? And albeeit we are bound to fear him, except we will miserably
perish with the world which was destroyed by the universal flood: yet that
we may be lead to fear him willingly, he promises riches to them which
shall fear him: and contrarily, he threateneth and punishes them which do not
fear him.

To the end therefore that we may not be contemned of the Deuteronomy. 10. 13 Psalm.
34. 10. and 145. 19. Leui. 26. 14. 1. Sam. 2. 29.
Lord, nor may perish, we must fear GOD, and we shall be breserued and
saved for ever. But there are some which deceive themselves, making themselves
believe that they fear God, because they give themselves unto superstition,
and observe men's traditions, and obey the commandementes of men, forsaking the
right way of the law of the Lord, from the which we must not decline neither to
the right hand, nor left. Popery is full of such people, by the deceit and
crafty working of hypocritical frieres: who may justly be reproched with this
saying: ye have made the commandment of God of no authority by your
traditions. Again, Woe therefore be unto you Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites, because ye shut up the kingdom of heaven beforemen. Ye compass
Sea and land Mat. 15. 6. and. 23. 13. 25 23.
to make one of your profession: ye tithe Mint, and Anise, etc. God of his
mercy grant that amongst us there be none such like nor worse.

Now to the end that we should not be deceived with such kind of people,
Solomon does teach us whereby we shall know whither we have the fear of God,
when he says, He that walks in his righteousness, fears the Lord. For to
know then whither we fear the Lord, we must walk in our righteousness. But
when Moses forbids the Israelites, Ye shall not do after Deuteronomy. 12. 8. Pro.
12. 15.
al these things that we do here this day, etc. and that Solomon has said
here before, The way of a fool is right in his own eyes (now by our own
nature we are fools, delighting in our ways, and striving to do what
seems us right) it might seem that we have no certain argument or proof
of the fear of the Lord, when we walk in our righteousness. This shall serve
for the answer, Let us know, that there is no righteousness that can be
attributed unto us, as having it of ourselves. It is true that God Eccle. 7. 30.
has made man righteous, but they have sought many inventions. Man has no
righteousness the which is of his own, but of the gift of God: and yet by his
foolishness he has lost it. Nevertheless in following of the scripture, we
will call that ours, which belongs unto God, and which is by his grace and
liberality given unto us: for in giving it unto us, he makes it ours.
Therefore when GOD gives us grace certainly to know that he is our GOD,
Father and Savior, and that for Jesus sake he will not impute our sins unto
us, but does forgive them us, and that also by this knowledge we are brought
to abhor and detest our wickedness and willingly and gladly to follow goodness,
and to give ourselves to do good works, which he commands, and has ordained
that we should walk in them: then do we walk in our righteousness, and may
be certified that we fear the Lord: as is said hereafter. And for as much
as we are assured that Prou. 18. 13.
we fear GOD, we may be assured also that we please him: whereupon it
follows that we ought not to stand in doubt whether God does love us or
not, and will save us or not. Psalm. 51. 19. Esaias. 66. 2.
But that we may not be deceived, let us know that Solomon does not speak
here of such a fear as does make us to tremble and quake before God, as men
do before a sharp, severe, and cruel judge: but he speaks of such a fear
as does lead us to honor God, and to give him willing obedience. He does
well give it to understand, when, against fear he sets contempt, saying:
But he that is lewd in his ways, despises him. After what sort soever we
take, this word his ways, either for the ways of God, that is to say, for
the kind of living and government in this world, that god teaches us by his
word: or for the ways of man, that is to say, for the conversation that man
ought to follow: there shall be no inconvenience at al, and the sense shall be al
one. For seeing that man is the creature of God, he ought not to have other
ways then those which God teaches him and commands him, but ought to walk
straight in them, without turning from them, either to the one side or to the
other: otherwise man does not fear God, nor honor him, but does despise
him: as Solomon does pronounce: and herein he does threaten al hypocrites
and dissemblers, al idolaters and superstitious, and al those which work
iniquity, showing them that they can look for nothing but destruction and
damnation, seeing they despise the author of life and salvation. Furthermore,
let us note that if we will turn this sentence backwarde, and say, who so
fears the Lord, walks in his righteousness: but he that does despise him
is lewd in his ways: the later sense shall not repugne the former, but we shall
here learn, (as the truth is) that it is the fear of the Lord which makes
men to walk in righteousness: and contrarily, that it is contempt of God
which turns me^ aside, and makes them lewd in their ways.

3 In the mouth of the foolish, is the rod of pride: but the lips of the wise
preserve them.
It seems unto the wicked which have authority and power, or think to have
maintenance and be supported, that it is lawful for them to speak what they
list: and indeed they use their tongues at their pleasure, as a thief does
his sword, and much worse: for they sharpen not their tongues only against
men by wicked words, by commandementes importable, by false witness bearing,
lying, flatteringes and slaunderings, and backbitings, but also against God, in
forsaking him, and giving themselves unto the Devil, in cursing, swearing, and
forswearing, blaspheming, and taking his name in jest, and in as well mingling it
with the vanities and filthiness, as with humane and diuelishe doctrines, with
vnshameful and wanton songs: in such wise that a man may blame them. Thou
give thy mouth to evil, and with thy tongue thou forgest Psalm. 50. 19. and.
7. 9. 11.
deceit: even so also we may complain that they have lifted up their
mouths to heaven. This is to have the rod of pride in their mouth, when they
do thus use it against God, and against their neighbors, and as they think,
without hurt and danger it is lawful Psalm. 10. 11. and. 94. 7
for them to rail. For they say, God will never see it: neither will the God of
Jacob regard it. And as touching men, because they open their mouth against the
innocent and weak, they boldly say, With our tongues, we will prevail: and our
lips are our own, Psalm. 12. 4
who is Lord over us? But we may say unto them, ye that are without
understanding, hear, and you fools, when will ye be taught? Therefore
albeit that they think to remain unpunished, yet shall they not escape nor
avoid the hand of the Lord: for it is said. These things have thou done,
and I held my tongue: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: but I
will reprove thee, and set them in order before thee. Again, Surely thou have
Psalm. 50. 21 Psalm. 73. 18. Psalm. 94. 21.
set them in slippery places, and castest them down into desolation Again,
They gather them together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the
innocent blood. Solomon does here after a sort threaten them with this
destruction, when he does attribute pride unto them: for that which is highly
esteemed before me^, Luke. 16. 15. and. 1. 51.
is abominable before God. And the virgin Mary says, He has scattered the
proud in the imagination of their hearts. God resists the proud, and
gives grace unto the humble. He signifies also their destruction, when
against the rod of pride, he sets the preservation, and conservation of
the wise, saying, But the lips of the wise preserve them. The preservation
whereof he speaks, is not worldly nor temporal, it is neither corporal nor
carnal: for there are no people in the world counted more folishe, proud, and
arrogant in words, then the wise, therefore are they hated and persecuted, and
put to death. They speak truth, which the world cannot bear: the which also
the heathen have known and said, That truth gets hatred. But we must stay
ourselves upon the word of the Lord. If the world hate you, ye know that
it hated me before you. Again, they shall excommunicate John. 15. 1^ and. 16. 2
you, yea the time shall come, that whosoever kills you, will think that he
does God service. This is not the conservation or temporal preservation that
is here spoken of, nor whereupon we must be stayed: but Solomon speaks
chiefly of the spiritual and eternal preservation, as also the destruction of
the foolish which do proudly speak, is eternal. True it is that as sometimes
God sends temporal punishments too the wicked, and is visibly revenged of
him: even so according as he sees expedient, he shows and declares
himself the preserver of the wise. Noe and other have proved it true. And
forasmuch as we desire to be preserved, we must cast from us the rod of
pride, and take the lips, which are opened with humility and modesty with
truth and temperancie. The which we cannot do of ourselves: And therefore
let us pray, Open my lips O Lord, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
Again, Set Psalm. 51. 17. and. 141. 3
a watch, O Lord, before my mouth and keep the door of my lips.

Thus doing we shall not be comprehended among them of whom the Scripture
complains. For there is no constancy in their mouth: within they are very
corruption, their throat Psalm. 5. 9. and. 57. 4. and. 64. 2. 3.
is an open sepulcher, and they flatter with their tongue. My soul is among
Lions: I lie among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are
spears and arrows, and the tongue a sharp sword. Hide me from the
conspiracy of the wicked, and from the rage of the workers of iniquity, which
have whet their tongue like a sword, and shot forth their arrows, eue^ bitter
words. etc, Psalm. 140. 3.
They have sharpened their tongues like a Serpent: Adders poison is under their
lips. Such kind of people fall into destruction, as in the places before
alleged ye may see. We ought not to be troubled with this destruction, as
though it should destroy us with them. For even as in using our tongues
wisely, we are not their companions in evil speaking, and proud words: even so
their destruction shall not come near us, but our lips shall preserve us:
that is to say, that God will allow of our words, and therefore he will
preserve us from destruction: not so, that we can deserve it by our lips, as
it ought to be manifest unto us. For since we know that it is the gift of God
to govern well our lips, we must not doubt but that it comes by only
grace that we are preserved and safely kept. But the Scripture has his
propriety, to attribute that to the instrument, which belongs only to the
workemaister which guides them: and this serves to bear with our rudeness,
and to be made more easy.

4 Where none oxen are, there the cribbe is empty: but much increase comes
by the strength of the Ox.
There is none of us all but loves well to have great rents, for to live at
ease in this world: but forasmuch as there are many careless and slouthful,
which had rather be idle then to work, and apply their minds to follow some
honest vocation, therefore they must suffer poverty, and utterly be destitute
of riches: as Solomon has exhorted and threatened them. And now under other
words he signifies the same thing, saying: Where none oxen are, there the
cribbe is empty. Solomon applies himself here to our kind of speaking: for
when we are altogether destitute of things, we use to say, that we are clean
empty. He places one kind of labor here, under the which he
comprehends al others, and does declare unto us that except we do
diligently follow the estate whereunto we are called, and use necessary
means to provide for ourselves and our family, we cannot look but for
poverty, as we deserve the same. Contrarily, if we do employ the power that
God does give us, and duly do our office, we shall abound in all wealth
that is necessary for us, and according as God shall see to be expedient for
to maintain and keep us in his service. Solomon does signify this same when
he says, But much increase comes by the strength of the Ox. We have none
other doctrine here, then such as we have heard already oftentimes: and it
is not without cause that Solomon uses repetition. For we are slow, negligent
and slouthful, and have need to be provoked, and as it were spurred up, and
often to be put in remembrance what we have to do.

Furthermore, by the care that he has to repeat this doctrine often, he does
show us how necessary for us it is to labor. Eue^ as the oxen do draw the
plough for to break up and turn over the earth, and to make it fit to bring
forth fruit: even so also must every one of us be occupied about our work
after his calling, and bear the yoke which God has laid upon us: neither
must we be ashamed to be compared unto Oxen, neither disdain to learn of
them, seeing that the Scripture sets them forth before us for to be our
Masters and Doctors, not only before the common people, but also before the
greatest: as Jeremy does complain thereof: Thou have smitten the^, but they
have refused to be tamed by discipline, Ier. 5. 3. 4. 5 Mat. 11. 2^.
etc. Let us in no wise be like unto such rebels, but rather let us follow the
exhortation of the Lord. If we must needs become subject unto work for to
obtain enough of corporal living: much more must we submit ourselves unto the
law of the Lord, and follow the ways, that God does teach us, by the which
he would lead us to eternallife. Otherwise, if we say with the wicked, Let
us break their bands: The Lord will make us subject unto Psalm. 2. 3. Deuteronomy. 28.
48 Iere. 28. 13.
cruel masters, as he has done heretofore to the children of Israel,
according as he had threatened them, And shall be subject to thine enemy, etc.
Thou have broken the yoakes of wood: but thou shall make for them yoakes of
iron. The Papists as we may know, are under a very hard and heavy yoke,
when they are under such Mat. 23. 4.
masters as our Lord describes. Let us acknowledge and confess the
blessings that God does give us in employing us in his service, and he will
give unto us abundance of revenues, and chiefly such as are spiritual. For
seeing he commands, Thou shall not muzzle Deuteronomy. 25. 4.
the Ox that treads out the corn: he will not leave us destitute of
necessary things. But if we despise the blessings he gives us, and do rebel
against him, let us look for punishment: I have nourished Esaias. 1. 2.
and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me: and consequently
the desolations wherewith God has threatened his people, came upon them.

5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false record will speak lies.
This saying of Solomon is so manifest and known to all men which have the
least good natural wit and understanding, that it needs none exposition, but
only to be considered upon: and thereby we ought to learn not to lie, but
to say the truth in all our talk. And the rather because we take it not well
to be counted or called liars or false witnesses, but faithful and true: but
chiefly because that God (which ought to be preferred before al our desires
and affections, our honor and reputation) abhors falsenesse and lying: as
he has declared by his Law, Deuteronomy. 19: and commends truth unto us highly,
which he loves: otherwise he Exo. 20. 7. 16. and. 23. 1. Leu. 19. 11. 12.
Deuteronomy. 19. 16 2. Tim. 2. 13. John. 14. 6. and. 17. 17.
should deny himself: the which we ought neither to think nor say: and also
it cannot be, Though we believe not, yet abides he faithful, he cannot deny
himself. He himself also is the truth: seeing that he neither is, nor can
be separated from his word, which says, I am the way, the truth, and the
life. Sanctify them with thy truth: Thy word is truth.

But forasmuch as every man is a liar, we must confess that of our nature we
are al false witnesses: and therefore if we will become true witnesses, we
have need that God would send and communicate his holy Spirit unto us, who
is the Spirit of truth, which lead the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ
into all truth: for the which to obtain, we must pray, Take not thy word of
truth utterly out of my mouth, for I wait for thy judgments. It is Psalm.
119. 43. and. 5. 7.
necessary for us that in all our words and talk we be armed with truth,
if we will not perish. For the Prophet David says, Thou shall destroy all
them which speak leasing. We have a fearful example thereof in the fifth
Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. And if all our talk ought to be true,
above all it is necessary that the words which concern God and Christian
religion should be uttered with truth. The Ministers therefore of the word
ought chiefly to be true witnesses.

6 A scorner seeks wisdom, and finds it not: but knowledge is easy to
him that will understand.
It seems at the first sight that the first part of this present sentence,
repugneth against diverse places of the Scriptures. Pro. 1. 7. 22. 24. Pro. 2.
3. 4. 5.
For Wisdom has called, and her counsel is refused. And she promises the
knowledge of GOD. And thus it seems that she speaks against herself.
Furthermore, forasmuch as there is no wisdom, but in GOD, and from God, we
can not seek wisdom, except that we seek God, who is contemned of
scorners: and therefore they seek neither him nor his wisdom: but they say in
their hearts, there is no God: The wicked cares not for God: The fool has
said in his heart, There is no Psalm. 10. 4. and 14. 1. Wis. 6. 12. Mat. 7. 7.
God. On the other side, Wisdom shines and never vadeth away, and is easily
seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her. And our Lord
says, Ask, and it shall be given you, etc. We see by these scriptures that
scorners do not seek wisdom, and that if they did seek her, they should
find her. I answer, For to find God and his wisdom truly, we must seek
her with all our heart, as we ought to have understood it before: And Moses
does Pro. 2. 3. Deuteronomy. 4. 29.
teach us also the same. But if from thence thou shall seek the lord thy God,
thou shall find him, if thou shall seek him with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. And to do this well we must forsake our wickednesses: Seek the
Lord whiles he may be found: call upon him whiles he is near. And we must
walk truly in Esa. 55. 6. Psalm. 145. 1^
the fear of GOD: The Lord is near unto all those that call upon him: yea
to all that call upon him in truth. Mockers and scorners do not seek the
Lord after this sort: and therefore they do not find him. And yet Solomon
does not lie, when he says, That the scorner seeks wisdom. For his
intent is not to attribute such care unto scorners, which nothing at al
regard the word of the Lord, the which is our wisdom, and understanding,
when we receive it in fear, and that by the same we learn to assure
ourselves of the goodness of God toward us: and that renouncing al
wickedness and abhorring it, we set all our delight to follow the
commandment of the Lord. But because that the scorners do labor to make
themselves believe that they tend to govern themselves wisely, and would be
esteemed wise (for if they be reproved for their wickedness, incontinently
they cry with open mouths, that they are honest men: and indeed, we shall see
some of them which will show some signs whereby it shall seem that they tend to
none other thing, but to behave themselves wisely, even to be guides of
other) for this cause Solomon says, that the scorner seeks wisdom: but
because they seek it not as they ought, therefore they find it not: that is
to say, that they neither will nor can govern themselves by wisdom. But that
it should not trouble us to seek wisdom, and that it might be easy for us
to find it, and rule ourselves thereafter, we must have knowledge. Solomon does
declare it unto us, when he says, But knowledge is easy to him, etc. By a man
of knowledge, Solomon signifies such an one as is careful to print the pure
word of the Lord in his heart and to delight therein. Such a man shall
easily find knoweledge: and as he truly seeks wisdom, so does he also
find it, and thereby does govern himself, bearing Mat. 11. 30.
willingly and gladly the yoke of the Lord, the which he finds easy.

7 Depart from the foolish man, when thou perceiuest not in him the lips of
knowledge.
Because the world contains more fools then wise men, and that the fools
do prosper in outward sight, are strongest, most rich, and of great credit
and authority, working all things after their own mind, and having
flatterers to flatter them, and to say they do well, even as they would,
therefore it seems unto the weak and indiscreet that they could do no
better, nor govern them more wisely then to join themselves with them, and to
be acquainted and familiar with them, for too learn their knowledge, whereby
they may rule themselves as they do, and to attain unto the degree of their
prosperity, credit and power. But they are deceived in this opinion: for they
can learn nothing to profit them. Solomon does show it, when he says,
Depart from the foolish man: when thou perceiuest not in him, etc. He
forbids us the company of the foolish, their acquaintance and familiarity
also: for it comes not of fear that we prosper, but rather in this, that we
be not cursed as are the foolish, though they think far otherwise, and this
comes because they look no further then to the earth, and have no knowledge
of God, but walk in darkness, and have their minds and understanding
darkened with ignorance: the which is the greatest plague they can have in this
life: for such an ignorance makes them fall into much wickedness, in the
which they become obstinate and indurate: whereupon follows their overthrow
and destruction.

Now that the foolish have no knowledge of God, Solomon does signify it,
when he gives the reason, wherefore he warns us to depart from the
foolish man, and says, When thou Romans 1. and 2. Ephe. 4. 17. 18.
perceiuest not in him the lips of knowledge. Had they the knowledge of God,
and that their hearts were garnished with true knowledge they would speak of
that which they knew and understood: For from the abundance of the heart, the
mouth speaks. And Mat. 12. 34.
thus we might know in them the lips of knowledge, and learn of them to
govern ourselves wisely. The which can in no wise be done: for not only
they are empty and void of knowledge, but do also hate it: whereof it follows
rightly, that they do not delight to speak thereof, and to common or talk
thereof for the instruction and teaching of their neighbors. In steed then to
know in them the lips of knowledge, we hear vanities, and filthy disordered
speeches, which proceed from foolishness and malice wherewith their hearts
do greatly abound. Solomon does somewhat signify the same, when he denies
them to have the lips of knowledge: for since they are great talkers and
babblers, they must needs have lips through whose infamousnesse we may
learn that they have no knowledge of God, but are filled with malice and
foolishness. Pro. 12. 23. and 13. 16.
They are great medlers, as Solomon does declare. And forasmuch as evil words
do corrupt good manners, therefore it is not without cause that Solomon
exhorts and commands us to depart 1. Cor. 15. 13
far from the foolish man. And because that Popery is stuffed and
replenished with such foolish men, it were necessary for them which have any
good beginning of the knowledge of truth, to depart from thence for to seek
the lips of knowledge and learning. We must be diligent to follow this
doctrine, and this same of our Lord: Let them alone, they be blind leaders
of Mat. 15. 14. 2. Cor. 6. 14.
the blind, etc. And this of Saint Paul, Be not unequally yoked with the
infidels. etc. If we cannot depart with our bodies, yet let us take heed
from consenting unto them, but let us rather rebuke them, as Saint Paul
teaches us. It belongs unto al Christians to do the same without fear of
loosing either life, goods, renown, or credit, or the favor of the world:
but it serves chiefly for the Pastors of the Church. Our Lord does Ephe.
5. 11.
give us an example thereof. If every one of us for his part will do this,
then must we arm our hearts and minds with the pure doctrine of the Gospel,
and be so filled there with, that from the abundance of the knowledge that we
shall have, our mouths should be opened for to utter knowledge and learning,
for too M^t. 10. and. 23
make our neighbors partakers with us thereof, that they might take no
occasion to depart from us, but to love and embrace our company, and to
desire our acquaintance and familiarity. It is not enough for us only to
depart from the foolish, but we must also labor to draw others unto us, and
chiefly the weak and ignorant, and to show ourselves soft, gentle, easy and
tractable: that they may know we have the lips of knowledge, and to
understand that we have discretion and wisdom, for to govern our lips:
not as they which trusting in their wits and wisdom, speak as they list, and
will for no reason that can be brought them give place unto other, nor hearken
to any counsel: but to speak as the words of God, being ready to receive
instruction of them which are indewed with the spirit of God, as they show by
their sayings and doeings.

8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the foolishnes of
fools is deceit.
There are many men which think themselves wise, provident and prudent, when
they so govern themselves that they save themselves from hurt and hinderance,
and that none do stop their profit: and in the mean while do labor with all
their power to get credit, authority and power, and to increase their riches
and wealth of this world, without caring whether they do wrong or no to their
neighbors, so that it be not perceived, or that men dare not rebuke the^ for
it. But since we must believe Solomon which says, The wisdom of the prudent,
etc: let us not esteem such men to be indewed either with wisdom and
prudencie, but only with a diuelishe wisdom, subtlety, and deceit, which
will bring them to destruction: for they understand not their way. Neither
know they how they ought to govern and guide themselves to do their duty
and office belonging to their neighbor: though they labor to make themselves
believe that they are cunning and learned men, but it is to make their profit
to the hurt of our neighbors, rather then they would miss and fail of their
purpose. This is not to understand their way aright, seeing that by such kind
of doing, they wander and stray out of the way, so that they run to
destruction. If such prudent men had their eyes open for to see their
destruction, they would judge that they did not understand their way: as at
the last they shall both know and also repent it. We have an example hereof
in the rich glutton: Again, the answer made unto the Goats does also show
it. But their repentance Wis. 5. 3. Luke. 16. 23. Mat. 25. 44.
shall nothing profit them, but the more to torment the^: as our Lord does
well signify the same, when he threateneth to send the unprofitable servant
into darkness: and when he says, that there shall be weeping, and gnashing of
teeth. Whiles we have Mat. 25. 30.
time therefore let us take pains to understand our way, that we may follow
it. But it might well seem, that it is not needeful for man to understand his
way for to follow it, and that there is nothing but foolishness and
wickedness therein, and that by flying from it, there should be rather
wisdom, and good discretion before God. For all the imaginations of the
thoughts of man's heart are Genesis 6. 5. and. 8. 21.
evil continually. Again, The imagination of man's heart is evil, even from his
youth. Whereof it follows, that all the ways of man are nothing worth: we have
al gone astray: for their works are wicked works: Let the wicked forsake his
ways, and the unrighteous his own imaginations, and return unto the Lord.
etc. The answer, Esaias. 55. 7. and 59. 6. Iere. 18. 6.
Even as the servant which forsakes the work that his Lord and master has
commanded him, and gives himself to his pleasure, is wicked and slouthful:
even so also, he which despises to walk after the word of God, who is our
Lord to whom we al do owe obedience, and is given to live after his
fantasy, is wicked and unfaithful. Contrarily, as the servant which will truly
show himself faithful and wise, does carefully the work of his master, as
if it were even his own: and indeed, he calls it his, because he is
bound to do it, and that it is his duty and office to be occupied therein:
Likewise, if we will show ourselves wise and prudent, as we ought, we must
apply our hearts and minds, to know the way which the Lord in his word
does teach us: for to follow and walk diligently in the same. Thus doing,
we shall understand our way, not that it is properly ours, not that we have
chosen it of ourselves: but because our duty is, to apply our minds to know
and to follow the way which he teaches us and commands us to hold. We
may say also that the way of Gods commandments is ours, when he gives us
grace to guide ourselves there^n by his holy Spirit, who makes us to delight
therein, and makes us that we may truly say, I have had as great delight in
the way of Psalm. 119. 14
thy testimonies: as in all manner of riches. They which understand this way, are
wise and prudent, and can gonerne themselves as apperteineth: and as they know
how to avoid the snares of Satan, and will not be deceived thereby: even so
their affections do not stretche to deceive any man. Solomon does something
signify this same, when he says, But the foolishness of the fools is
deceit. Against wisdom, he sets foolishness, and against the prudent,
the fools: and against to understand his way, he sets deceit. Wherein he
shows us that for as much as the fools do not understand their way, neither
will understand it, they are easily deceived: and also are given unto fraud and
deceit. they are subject unto the baits of Satan, and cannot avoid them: as
also they labor to entrap their neighbors, and to hurt them, even to destroy
them when they think they cannot obtain their desires ottherwayes. Such
crooked deceit is described unto us in the Psalms: Behold he shall travel
with wickedness: for he has conceived mischief, but he shall bring forth
alie, Psalm. 7. 14. and 9. 16. and 10. 15.


The fool makes a mock of sin: but among the righteous there is favor.
Let us first of all note, when Solomon sets the righteous against the fool,
that he speaks of wicked fools which hate know ledge, which despise wisdom
and instruction, and are froward, malicious, vnfaithfulll, arrogant and
cruel. For those are righteous which love knowledge, which make great account
of wisdom and instruction: and are delighted with uprightness, justice,
goodness, and faithfulness: and are full of gentleness, humanity and
benevolence. Herein consists righteousness: as we may gather of the former
Chapters, and also by this present sentence, when Solomon sets the fool
against the righteous, and does attribute favor unto them.

Secondly, when against making a mock of sin, he sets favor, we must
understand that this mocking is full of cruelty, and that the foolish do not
mock as it were in passing by, when they have committed any wickedness
against their neighbors by doing of them wrong and injury, in doing of them
violence to destroy them: but they run over head and ears, and bathe
themselves therein, and are ravished and carried headlong with a great abundance
of wicked desires and cruel thoughts. And yet notwithstanding, they make no
great account of their misdoings which they commit to the great detriment and
destruction of their neighbors, as if it were a light thing. Solomon does
somewhat signify this same by the word of making a jest or a mock: and has
plainly signified it here before in the tenth Chapter and 23. verse. The
world has always been replenished with such fools, as also was showed in
the same former place. Thirdly, when favor is attributed unto the righteous,
let us note, that we cannot boast ourselves of righteousness, except we be led
with sweet and gracious affections toward our neighbors, and delight to do
them good, in following the exhortations of S. Paul: Let al bitterness, and
anger, and Ephe. 4. 31.
wrath, crying, and evil speaking be put away from you with all maliciousnes.
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children, and walk in love, even
as Christ has loved us, etc. But now put Ephe. 5. 1. 2. Coll. 3. 8.
ye away even al these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnes, cursed speaking,
filthy speaking, out of your mouth. But forasmuch as it is very hard to
find such favor and gentleness on earth, we may well know that the world is
void of righteous men.

10 The heart knows the bitterness of his soul, and the stranger shall not
meddle with his joy.
The Scripture does transfer the bitterness of the soul, after diverse
sorts, and sundry significations. For first of all, when Moses admonishes
the children of Israel: that there should not Deuteronomy. 29. 18
be among them any root that brings forth Gall and Wormwood: He takes
the root bringing forth Gall and Wormwood, for the inward malice of the
heart, the which does so poison man, that he delights and assures himself
in his wickedness, and not feeling the punishment of his misdoings, he
brings forth nothing but bitterness, angring and provoking his froward and
corrupted concupiscence to despise God. We may gather this interpretation from
the very words of Moses, when he afterward says, So that when he
hears the words of this curse, and. 19.
he blesses himself in his heart, etc. In this same signification is also
bitterness taken.

Secondly, bitterness is taken for cruelty, malice, and sharpness. Thirdly,
when Ezechias says, Behold, for felicity I had bitter Hebr. 12. 15 Esai.
38. 17. Act. 8. 23. Ephe. 4. 31. Iam. 3. 14. Luke 22. 62
grief, but it was thy pleasure to deliver my soul from the pit of
corruption: And when also it is said, that Peter went out and wept bitterly;
bitterness is there taken for heaviness, sorrow and grief: as it is also in
this present sentence, when it is said, The heart knows the bitterness of
his soul. Solomon does show it, when against bitterness he sets joy,
saying, And the stranger shall not meddle with his joy. Let us understand,
that we are here admonished, not to seek our joy and consolation in
outward things of this world, when our hearts are troubled and sorrowful:
but for to be delivered and freed from our heaviness and sorrow, and to obtain
joy, we must run unto God, knowing that it is not without cause that he is
called the God of consolation: For unless he does comfort us, what joy
soever we have, yet must the same be turned into grief and trouble.
Contrarily, if he give us joy, and comfort us, none can remove nor take away
our joy. David does well confess this, when he says, If the Lord had Psalm.
94. 17. and 86. 3.
not helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. Let us not be blinded
and carried away with the pleasures of this world, but let us say with David,
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee, continually.

11 The house of the wicked shall be destroyed: but the tabernacle of the
righteous, shall flourish.
The wicked labor so much as they can, to make Solomon a layer, as it has
been always their custom either by deed or word, to belie those which
have threatened and condemned them in the Name of God. Noe the Ambassador of
righteousness Hebr. 11. Genesis 6. 14. Mat. 24. 34
condemned the world of the wicked, and that in following the word of God,
but no thank to them, that they labored not to show that it was but in jest,
wherewith they were threatened. In steed where they ought to have converted
unto God by true repentance, and to fear his threateninges, they endeavored
to make them void in banqueting and feasting one with an other, for to put
them out of remembrance: and for to preserve their houses and families, they
made marriages: but for all that ever they could do, yet was the hand of God
strongest, and the end declared that they were not threatened in vain. Thus
their house was destroyed: as was also the same of the Zodomites, and
Gomorrhians. Genesis 19. 2^ Luke 17. 23 2. Pet. 2. ^. Mat. 7. 27.
The wicked ought to look for no other end. Let them labor to be rich, and
to strengthen themselves so much as they can, either by heaping up of goods
and riches together, or by credit and power, or by leagues with the more
mighty and more noble then themselves, yet must their house fall: for it is
not built upon the rock. Albeit then that the wicked do boast and brag and
exalt and lift up themselves, yet shall they not continue.

They think they are very sure and stable: as Solomon does signify it,
attributing an house unto them, and attributing unto the righteous but a simple
tabernacle, the which oftentimes is little and low, and easily removed hither
and thither. Notwithstanding he compares the flourishing state of the
righteous unto the appearance of the long continuance of the house of the
wicked, and does also prefer the same before it, when he says, But the
Tabernacle of the righteous shall flourish. First of al let us note that when a
simple and weak tabernacle is preferred unto an house which seems strong and
mighty, we are taught not to stay, nor to trust unto the fair shows of this
world: but rather to seek humble things, and to be contented with a low
degree: so doing, we shall be raised up unto an excellent and everlasting
highness. Secondly, forasmuch as the state of the wicked is compared unto an
house, we must not therefore marvel though they be great in outward sight,
and do long stand: as it seems to those which have not like prosperity.
Their state is compared unto an house: but like to such an house as shall be
destroyed, and shall ouerwhelme such as are therein. Now there is none of us
but had rather dwell in such a light tabernacle, then to dwell in such a decayed
house, how great and fair soever it be. They which know of destruction at
hand, cannot dwell but in great fear. And forasmuch as the scripture compares
the state of the righteous unto a tabernacle, against the wicked and their
estate: therefore we must not depart from righteousness, though that in
following thereof we be despised of the world, and that our condition be
worse in outward sight, then the same of the wicked. For the poverty of the
faithful patiently borne, is much more worth, then the great prosperity of the
wicked. Solomon does signify it, when against destruction, he sets
flourishing, saying, But the tabernacle of the righteous shall florishe. But
seeing that the flower is soon passed and gone, and that it withers and
becomes hay very quickly and dries, as we daily see: and that the scripture
compares the most excellent things of this world, unto a flower, to show
thereby their unstableness, inconstancy and vanity: it may seem therefore,
that the excellent state of the righteous, is not duly Job. 14. 2. Psalm. 103.
15 Esaias. 4. 7. James. 1. 10.
nor rightly signified, when it is said, that their tabernacle shall flourish. To
the which I answer, albeit that the flower is of small continuance, yet, after
winter (in the which it seems that al herbs are dead when the spring time
comes (in the which all herbs and roots of the earth do wax green,
spring and floorish) we find al things well and in good case, whereat we
rejoice. The Scripture also for to signify the prosperous and blessed estate
of the faithful, does attribute to them, flourishing: it says, Hereafter
Jacob shall Esai. 27. 6. and 35. 1.
take root: Israel shall floorish and grow, and the world shall be filled with
fruit. The desert and the wilderness shall rejoice: and the wast ground shall be
glad and floorish as the rose, etc. Such as be planted Psalm. 92. 13 14.
in the house of the Lord, shall floorish in the courts of our God. And
because that this prosperous and floorishing estate is not outwardly seen, but
that the faithful most commonly are under affliction, as experience does
teach it. The Scripture says not that they do floorish: for they are now as
it were in the winter but it says that they shall flourish. And herein it
shows that their flower shall continue even for ever. Solomon does well show it
here, when against destruction he sets flourishing.

12 There is a way which seems right to a man: but the yssues thereof are the
ways of death.
When any thing is often done in the world, it seems there is no evil in it.
Whereupon it follows that it seems good and right: seeing that between
good and evil, between wrong and right there is no difference. There are but
a few which be of this opinion, but in all estates almost custom is made a
law, though it be against the honor of God, and against the love of our
neighbor. We may see the same in superstitions and idolatries, in crafts and
occupations, in trades and merchandise. Because the way that such folks do
hold is commonly used, therefore it seems too them right: but they shall at
the last feel that they wandered and went astraye after diverse sorts and very
grievously: as Solomon does signify the same, when he says, But the yssues
thereof are the ways of death. Wherein he teaches the very same thing that
Moses taught the children of Israe, Ye shall not do after al these things
that we do here this day: that is, every man whatsoever Deu. 12. 8.
seems him good in his own eyes. And immediately after, he Deuteronomy. 12. 8.
threateneth that if we follow that which is right in our own mind and
opinion, that we shall dye, not only temporally and corporally, the which is
common both to men and to beasts, to the Eccles. 3. 19. and 9. 2.
just and unjust, and also we see that they which walk right, after the
judgment of the world, are not in so great danger of corporal death, as are
they which seek to please God, according to his word. Who are rather counted,
sheep for the slaughter. But chiefly by eternal death, wherein the wicked shall
know, that the way which Romans 8. 36.
they have holden, was not the right way.

Such knowledge shall profit them nothing, but further to torment them.
Wherefore, let us understand, that Solomon does Wis. 5. 3.
admonish us to walk clean contrary to our own opinion and fantasy, if
we will avoid death, and obtain life.

Furthermore, he shows us, that we al of ourselves do tend unto death: for
we think that we are so wise, that we can alone guide ourselves. This same
is common to al men, until they be regenerate and sanctified by the Spirit of
God, who by his anointing does teach and lead them. To the end then that we
do not enter into the ways of death, Let us pray, Lead me, O Lord, Psalm. 5.
8. and 25. 4.
in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies, etc. Again, Show me thy ways,
O Lord, and teach me thy paths, etc.

13 Even in laughing the heart is sorrowful, and the end of that mirth, is
heaviness.
When the worldlinges and carnal men do feel themselves troubled and grieved,
or when they will put away and resist grief, they will play and pass the time
away as merrily as possibly they can: they eat, they drink abundantly, even
til they be drunk or very near: they leap, sing and daunse: they delight to
reason, to jest and talk of vain things, yea filthy and unclean: they
turn their look for to feed the same with the appearaunce of beauty. After
this manner they laughed: but as Solomon says, Even in laughing the heart is
sorrowful. For albeeit that in leading such a life they labor to avoid grief,
yet they cannot: for they have an hang man within in them, which does torment
them, from whose hands they labor to be delivered, to wit, their conscience
which does reprove them and fear them before the judgment seat of God for
their disordered life: though they strive to make themselves believe that there
is neither God nor Devil, neither salvation nor damnation. And therefore they
rejoice dissolutely, as though evil should never happen unto them: but finally
they shall feel that they have been deceived as Solomon does well declare unto
them, saying,

And the end of that mirth is heaviness. After that Adam had rejoiced of
eating the forbidden fruit, he had great heaviness: Genesis 3. 7. ^.
the which had continued for ever, if God had not redressed it by his promise.
The world which perished with the flood did no less feel, it, than did the
Sodomites and Gomorrhians. The Genesis 3. 6. and 7 and 19. Exo. 32. Luke. 16.
Luke. 6. 24. 2^ Esaias. 5. 11. 12. and 22. 12. 13.
people of Israel was punished for their idolatry, The rich glutton was cast
into hell. Al these nations have felt that which Solomon speaks of: and all
such like shall feel it. Woe unto them, that rise up earelie to follow
drunkenness, and to them that continewe until night, til the wine do inflame
them. And the harp and viol, timbrel, and pype, and wine are in their feasts:
but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the work of his
hands. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call unto weeping and
mourning and to baldness and girding with sackecloth, etc.

14 The heart that declineth, shall be satiate with his own ways: but a good
man shall rule over him.
Solomon has showed us here before what are the ways of an heart that
declineth, when he said, My Son, if sinners entice thee, Pre. 1. 1^.
consent thou not, etc. For their feet run after evil, etc. For except man's
heart were alienated and estranged from GOD and his word, he should not
have such wicked thoughts, neither would he give himself unto such wicked
works, the which do worthily deserve grievous punishment: as Solomon does
show. (...) (...) Let us not the^ be like unto those that are desirous to
hear news, that they may pass away their time merrily and carelessly, so vain
and unprofitable they are: and yet notwithstanding, they think verily they are
not sluggish and sleepish, but are quick and nimble. As such men do easily
believe lies, even so do they delight to make others believe them also, and
they think a man a very fool, or that he does them wrong, when he
believes not their words so easily, as did their iesters and flatterers.
Secondly, let us not be like unto them which love to be flattered, and too
hear nothing that may trouble or hurt them: but would have men to speak such
things as do please them, or that they think to be profitable for them.
They will diligently hear liars, false witnesses and slaunderers. Now as God
forbids lying, false witness bearing, and slaundering, so does he also
forbid, Thou shall not receive Exo. 23. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 3.
a false tale, neither shall thou put thine hand with the wicked, to be a false
witness.

Thirdly, let us take heed we be not like unto those which have ytching
years. The world almost is filled with none other people, and chiefly Turkey,
and the places where popery reigns. If we follow them, we run into
destruction, and do worthily deserve to perish, seeing that we are warned
thereof in diverse places. Having 2. These. 2. 10. Romans 16. 17. 1. Tim. 4. 1. 2.
Tim. 3. 1. 2. Pet. 2. 1.
then so many testimonies, whereby we are admonished, we do worthily deserve to
be counted and called fools and dolts if we believe every thing. And for as
much as we cannot take it well to be counted such, but contrarily, would be
holden and esteemed for discrete and wise, therefore we must stand upon our
watch, considering diligently how we should govern ourselves, that we go not
awry. Solomon does teach it us so, when he says: but the prudent will
consider his steps. For to consider well our steepes, that we may be well
governed, and not to believe every thing, we must Psalm. 5. 8. and 25. 4. 119.
12. 105. and 103.
pray, Lead me O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: make my
way plain before my face. Show me thy ways, O Lord, and teach me thy
paths. Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. Thy word is a
lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my path. The entrance into thy words
shows light, and gives understanding to the simple. Now for to enjoy this
same, well we must follow the order that Jesus Christ has placed in his
Church. Thus doing, we shall be wise, discrete and well governed, as S. Paul
does admonish us. Brethren, be not children in understanding, Ephe. 4. 11.
but as concerning maliciousnes be children, but in understanding be of a ripe
age. But when S. Paul says, That love 1. Cor. 14. 2^
suffers all things, it believes all things: it hops all things, it
indureth all things: it may seem therefore not to be foolishnes to believe
every thing. To the which I answer, The holy Ghost which has thus spoken by
S. Paul, has said also by Moses: If there rise among you a Prophet or
dreamer of dreams, and give thee a sign or wonder, etc. S. Paul himself
also has said, Try all things, and keep that which is good. Again, S. John
says, 1. Cor. 13. 7.
Dearly beloved brethren, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
whether they be of God. And therefore, when it is said, that love believes
all things, let us understand it of such things as may and ought lawfully to
be believed. For a Christian man Deu. 13. 1. 1. These. 5. 21. 1. John. 4. 1.
ought not wittingly and willingly to cast away wisdom and right judgment,
and suffer himself to be deceived, that he should not judge between white and
black: but ought very rightly to proceed in simplicity and humanity in
judgment, and not to be so wicked as to charge his neighbor with wrong and
evil suspicion.

16 A wise man fears and departs from evil: but a fool rages and is
careless.
They which for the wickedness they have committed, do fear to be punished, and
yet have no mind to do well, nor abhor the evil that they think and do
commit: such do not depart from evil, for all their fear: as we have
examples thereof in Cayn, Pharao, Saul, and Judas and others. Therefore when
Solomon says, that A wise man fears, etc. he speaks not of such a fear,
but of an holy and honorable affection that the faithful bear toward God
whereby they abhor and detest al wickedness, rebellion and disobedience, and
tremble for the evils that they either think or commit, knowing that they are
greatly indetted to the judgment of God: and because they are not pardoned,
they feel themselves guilty of death and damnation. And yet notwithstanding,
by the trust that they have in the mercies of God, they love the good that he
commands, and labor to give him obedience. This is the true wisdom, and
the fear which God requires of us, and as has already been handeled. A wise
man therefore Deuteronomy. 4. 6. and 10. 12. Pro. 1. 7. and 2. 51. and 8. 13. and 9.
10. Romans 7. 24.
fears the judgment of God, which he deserves for his sins, the which
also he abhors and detesteth: and therefore by true repentance, he
labors to avoid them, and to give himself unto goodness, and according as
God does command him by his holy word. And being rebuked and reprehended,
either in his own conscience, or by his neighbors, he waxes not spightful,
but confesses that he is very miserable, because of his sins and offenses.

Contrarily, as Solomon says, A fool rages, and is careless. When Solomon
sets raging, against departing from evil: and carelessness, against fear:
we may first understand that the fool through despite and anger that he
has to be rebuked of God in his conscience which does prick him, or to be
admonished and corrected by men, which set the judgments of God before him,
and do threaten him with his vengeance: by despite I say, of such
admonitions, he strives to transgress his word, and to give himself forth
on to do evil with all insolency and dissolutenes, with all injuries and
ragings, to the dishonor of God, and hurt of their neighbors. The world
destroyed by the flood, and the Sodomites and Gomorrhians, and Saul did so
behave themselves: as may be gathered by the Scriptures. And now at this day
many wicked men do rage after this sort: even as Judas has also raged and
fought against Jesus Christ. Secondly, Let us understand that when it is said,
that the fool is careless, that Solomon does not attribute unto him any true
assurance. For the sound of a leaf shaken, shall chase him, Leu. 26. 36.
Psalm. 14. 5. Esa. 5. 20.
etc. There they shall be taken with fear, because God is in the generation of
the just. The wicked are like the raging sea, that can not rest, whose waters
cast up mire and dirte. But he does attribute arrogancy, boasting and
presumption unto him: whereupon it comes, that the fool against his own
conscience, labors to make himself believe that he shall well atchieue his
enterprises, and that nothing shall hurt him nor hinder him: and therefore,
boldly and rashely does he give himself to do evil. The wicked Psalm. 10. 2.
and 12. 4. Esai. 28.
with pride does persecute the poor, Which have said, With our tongue will
we prevail, etc. Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death,
and with hell are we at agreement: though a scourge run over, and pass
through, it shall not come at us.

Forasmuch as there is nothing but the only truth of God which can assure man,
and deliver him truly from al fear, the which truth the fool does despise
and reject: therefore it follows, he can not stand fast, but after the
former meaning. And albeit the fool does stand fast or is careless, yet is
he not assured, but stands still in fear, and trembles: even so, albeit
that the wise man fears, and that he stands not fast, yet is he assured
and certified of the help and goodness of God. In this there is no
repugnancie: as we may see by that which has been already said, both of
the wise man and fool, otherwise S. Paul would not exhort us, to make Philip.
2. ^2.
an end of our own salvation with fear and trembling. He would not have us
to doubt of the good will of God toward us, nor of our salvation: but he
would that we should witness and ^pprooue our obedience, in this, that we
abase ourselves and be^^me humble, confessing how miserable we are of
ourselves, and now naked of al goodness. This fear is contrary to the
carelessness of fools and wicked men, wherein they wax proud and are
delighted, or rather are puffed up with a vain confidence of their force and
power.

17 He that is hasty to anger, commits folly, and a busy body is hated.
Albeit that al virtues do agree together, and that there is no repugnancie
between them, and that the worldly wise men do say, that there is al one
instruction of things contrary: yet nevertheless al vices which are
contrary unto virtue, do not agree altogether, but there are some, amongst
the which there are great contrarieties. Amongst others, Solomon does here
set before us two vices, and does set them one contrary to the other. The one
is choler, the which suddenly breaks forth by words or by acts that are
put forth without regard had to the end thereof, whether it shall be hurtful
to a man's self or to his neighbors: whether we shall be praised or discommended
thefore: whether we shall escape as we would after anger is past: it suffices
to show his impatiencie, for too make him afraid, and that there may be no
resistance. But that is not al ways obtained: for oftentimes it hapeneth that
the impatient do meet with as angry folks as themselves are, or with other
discreet men and well ruled, which can well suppress them, and make them feel
that they do not wisely but foolishly, which hurts them. Solomon does
signify it, saying, He that is hasty to anger, commits folly: He follows
here our manner of speaking. For we often say that a man woorketh folly,
when that which he does serves to nothing but to bring him to contempt, or to
hinder him, and to destroy him in steed that he meant to do that evil to his
neighbor. And when he thus speaks, he does well show us, that we ought to
be careful to take heed, lest we be suddenly angry, seeing we would have no
foolish thing laid to our charge, but would have whatsoever we say or do,
allowed to be good. Saint James does exhort us, saying, Iam. 1. 19. 20 Mat. 5.
19.
Let every man be slow to wrath. For to preserve us then from rebellion, and
to avoid punishment, let us follow the patience of our God: The Lord is strong,
merciful, and gracious, slow to anger, and Exo. 34. 6. Psalm. 103. 8 Ephe. 4.
31. and 5. 1. Collo. 3. 8.
abundant in goodness and truth. And for to follow this well, let us obey S.
Paul, who says, Let al bitterness, and anger, etc. be put away from you. But
now put ye away eue^ al these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnes, cursed
speaking, filthy speaking, out of your mouth. Thus doing, we shall not commit
folly, but shall work wisdom. The vice that Solomon places against hastiness
or anger, is a long and secret purpose to hurt a man's neighbor, the which at
the last is discovered, and makes a man hated, who after having long
dissembled the anger and hate that he did bear to his neighbor, does declare
him such as he is, laboring to put his devises in execution. This is given us
to understand, when Solomon says, A busy body, or a man of imaginations,
shall be hated. He does here show us what reward the malicious are worthy of,
that is to say, that as they have nourished in their hearts, wrath, and hatred,
eue^ so it comes to pass that they are hated as they deserve: first of God,
as Solomon says in his 6. chap. The Lord hates an heart that imagines wicked
enterprises. He makes them also to feel this hatred, as David says: Thine
hand Pro. 6. 18 Psalm. 21. 8. ^.
shall find out al thine enemies, and thy right hand shall find out the^ that
hate thee: Thou shall make them like a fiery oven in time of thine anger, etc.
When the scriptures speak thus in the name of the afflicted, against busy
bodies, it shows in the second place that they are hated of me^, as they do
also well deserve. But it is not to say that it is lawful for us to hate them
which imagine evil things, against us for our own sakes: but inasmuch as they
be the enemies of God. Oh that thou would slay, O God, the wicked and
blooddie men, to whom I say, depart from me: Which speak wickedly Mat. 5. 44
Romans 12. 17. Psalm. 139. 1^
of thee, being thine enemies are lifted up in vain. Albeit then that Solomon
says that the busy body, or man of imaginations shall be hated, yet it is not
to say, that he allows us to hate our neighbor, how wicked soever he be, for
his own profit or disprofit: but Solomon does show us what does happen unto
the dreamers of malice, and what they deserve to have. And because that we
naturally desire to have the love and favor of our neighbors, and not their
displeasure, except we be void of our right wits, we must here therefore
learn to think well and to do well to our neighbors.

18 The foolish do inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
When we despise or reject any thing, it is very hard to obtain and get it:
but if we be careful as we ought to follow any thing, we easily get the
possession thereof. Wherefore if the foolish have neither knowledge nor
wisdom, we ought not to wonder at it: for as we have seen, they reject it.
And in steed of that, Pro. 1. 7. 2^
they are earnest after folli^* and therefore, they obtain it: as Solomon
does signify it, saying,

The foolish do inherit folly. It is not of late, but of old: as it is
here signified after a sort by the preterperfectence of the verb which
Solomon in his language uses, saying, They have inherited. And so this
inheritance is come or descended from father to son, and has been more
carefully kept, than if it had been any good thing. But such is the nature of
man, when he is left unto himself, that he is rather given to vanity, then
to any profitable work, rather to folly, then to wisdom, and is more
delighted with ignorance then with knowledge. Wherefore he is well worthy to
inherit nothing that excels: and they which follow him can gather no
profit thereby, since he has nothing but folly: for a man can not take that
of his heritage which it has not. Let us therefore first understand that we are
here admonished not easily to believe all kind of words, and to suffer
ourselves to be deceived Pro. 1. 26.
as fools: for of such simplicity or lightness, there can come but folly,
which is not only unprofitable, but also hurtful. Secondly, let us not
greatly desire the company of the foolish, and to get their acquaintance and
familiarite: for since they possess nothing that is ought worth, we can have
nothing but hinderance to keep them company, though there were no other evil
but this, that we loose our time amongst them, except we rebuke, chide and
threaten them, as they deserve: partly to declare that we will not communicate
with their unfruitful works of darkness: partly, for to labor to bring them
again to a sound understanding, that they may be turned away from folly, and
to give themselves unto wisdom, for to be discrete and well governed. By this
means they shall not come to be blamed nor shamed for their folly, but to be
magnified and honored. Solomon does pronounce it, when he says; but the
prudent are crowned with knowledge. As good worldly husbands do labor to get
and to have their possessions and heretages about them, and do therein greatly
delight, for to see their houses to be compassed round about with goodly
fields, meddowes and vineyards and other earthly commodities: and when they
can safely keep and defend their goods, they are praised and honored of the
world, and esteemed as young kings: even so the prudent which do spiritually
labor, which are governed by the leading of Pro. 13. 16.
the holy Ghost, and work all by knowledge, do so abound in the same, that
they are therefore in great estimation and account with them, which do abhor
foolishnes and love knowledge, and whatsoever is done and ruled thereby.

After this sort are the prudent crowned with knowledge: and it is veey meet
so to understand it. For the Scripture has a crown, and also uses to give a
crown, for ornaments of glory, honor, and magnificence, and also for
abundance: as it is said, He has spoiled me of mine honor, and taken the
crown away from my head. For thou have made him little lower, then God, and
crowned Job. 19. 9. Psalm. 8. 6. and 21. 4. and 5. 43. and 65. 12. and 103. 4
him with glory and worship, etc. For abundance. Even as it is said of the
foolish that they inherit folly, because they have nothing else about them,
and that for this very cause they are contemned: even so it is said of the
prudent, they are crowned with knowledge, because that the same is abu^dantly
showed forth both in their words and deeds: this is the cause, and why they
are esteemed. And that we be not deceived in this word knowledge, let us not
think to be prudent, when we have much read and retained humane sciences:
for humane sciences are but vanity and folly of themselves, and do nothing
serve but to puff up a man, and to make him boast and brag, which is great
folly. But then are we wise and crowned with knowledge, when we give our
minds and wits unto the word of the Lord, following after his will,
studiyng diligently and faithfully every one in his vocation. Moreover, let us
first note, that albeit the state of the faithful, which are discrete and well
ruled, is bace and naught set by before the world, yet before GOD (who gives
them the crown of knowledge) they are in a kingly state: whereof that we may
be partakers, let us follow this exhortation of Saint Paul: Brethren, be
not children in understanding, but as concerning maliciousnes, be children, but
in understanding 1. Cor. 1420.
be of a ripe age. If very constantly we follow this exhortation, and that
we cease not to persevere (for all the temptations which happen) till we come
unto unity of faith: after the crown Ephe. 4. 13. Iam. 1. 12.
of knowledge, we shall obtain the crown of life. Secondarily, let us note
that as a crown is set upon the head, that it may be seen: even so God
crowns the prudent with knowledge, not that they should hide their talent in
the earth: but that they should bring it forth to light and open show, by
sound doctrine and 1. Pet. 2. 9.
good works: for even therefore are they crowned kings. And herein we must
persevere, what persecution soever is raised up against 1. Tim. 2. 11. 12.
us. For this is a true saying. For if we be dead together with him, we also
shall live together with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign together with
him:

19 The evil shall bow before the good, and the wicked as the gates of the
righteous.
It seems at the first sight that this present sentence repugneth diverse
proofs and experiences. For first of al, Caine was wicked: ^eu. 4. 8. and 13.
13. and 19. 4. 2, Pet. 2. 7. and 27. 41. and 37. 23. 28.
and so far was it of, that he would bow before just Abel, that rather he
rose up against him, and slew him. Secondly, the people of Sodom were wicked:
and they greatly strove against Lot who was righteous. Thirdly, Ismael scorneth
Isaac. Fourthly, Esau hated Jacob. Fifthly, the sons of Jacob spoyleth
Joseph their brother of his precious garment, and sold him. And always we
have seen the wicked after the outward appearance to be stronger and higher
in authority, and to give no reverence to the good, but to esteem them as
doung and filth, to reject and persecute the^, for to kill and utterly to
destroy them. And also our Lord says unto his Disciples: Blessed are they
which suffer for righteousness sake. If the world hate you, know it hated
me before you. They shall excommunicate you out of their Synagogues. Again, In
the world ye shall have affliction, but be of good cheer, I have Mat. 5. 10.
John. 15. 18. and 16. 2. 33.
overcome the world. I answer, albeit, for the exercise of the faithful, and
to try their patience, God does suffer the wicked to rise up against them,
contemn them and molest them: yet nevertheless at the time appointed, and
when he shall see meet, he will beat down the arrogancy of the wicked,
and suppress their fury and cruelty, and subdue them unto the good and
righteous. Esau had surely thought to have slain Jacob: but he came to
receive him. The king of Sodom went to meet Abraham: And Genesis 33. 4. and 14.
27. and 42. 9.
the brethreu of Joseph came and bowed before Joseph, etc. Then Pharao called
Moses and Aaron, and said, pray ye unto the Lord, that he may take away the
frogs from me, and from my people, and I willet the people go, that they
may do sacrifice unto the Lord. Exodus 8. 8. and 12. 36. Iosu. 2, 12. ^9. 25.
The Lord gave the people favor before the Egyptians, etc. Rahab, besought
the spies. etc. And the Gebonites became the servants of Iosuah of the people
of Israel. To be short, the people of Israel, who for the most part were
wicked, was constrained to bow before Moses, Joshua, the Judges, Kings, and
Prophets. Saul humbled himself unto David, when he confessed and
acknowledged his innocence and righteousness. The wicked do now also
reverence 1. Sam. 24. 1^
the good, when the judges and Magistrates know how to humble the sword of
justice: and when by the preaching of the word, they are confounded, and have
their mouths fast stopped, or else that they return from their wickedness by
true repentance submitting themselves to the exhortations and instructions that
are made unto them by the word of the Lord: in following that Heb. 13. 17.
which is said, Obey the^ that have the oversight of you, and submit
yourselues. Therefore this present sentence is true, upon the which let us
first note, that the judgments in the old time were holden in the gates: and
thither men came for to obey justice. For this cause for to declare how the
wicked are constrained to submit themselves, and to give obedience unto the
righteous: Solomon says, that they bow at the gates of the righteous.
Secondly, forasmuch as we must chiefly bow unto kings and governors, they
are here admonished to lay aside al malice, to fly al injustice, and to Romans
13. 13. 1. Pet. 2. 13.
give themselves unto goodness, and to show themselves truly just, in
rendering to every man. etc. And if any do fall away and become dissolute and
rebellious, as there are which will not incline to them, and will not obey them
as they ought, let them then know, either that God will try their forces and
boldness, and whether they be of good courage to withstand the wicked, and
to suppress their insolences: either that God does punish them, because
they apply not themselves unto goodness and justice as they ought.

Therefore when any insurrections are, let the Magistrates humble themselves
before GOD, weeping and lamenting their faults: and yet for all this to loose
no courage, but manly to use the sword which is committed unto them. Thirdly
we are admonished what kind of men we ought to place in authority.
Fourthly, albeit that the will of GOD be (as it appears here) that the
wicked should bow before the good, yet is it not too say that we should
desire men to bow and kneel before us, but so much as is required for the
honor and glory of God, for the common peace, and for the order of policy.
For our goodness and righteousness can never be so excellent, that it should
deserve that men should bow and reverence us. Fifthly, since that unto God the
king everlasting belongs all honor and glory, and that it is before him that
every knee should bow, we must therefore understand that he makes his
Majesty shine at the gates of the righteous, when he makes the wicked to
bow before them. And for as much also as he greatly esteems the good and
righteous, when he makes them partakers of the glory, which apperteineth unto
him only: it is therefore a true argument that he would have us highly to
esteem goodness and righteousness.

20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbor: but the friends of the rich
are many.
Solomon pronounces here that which is commonly done in the world, and not
that which ought to be done. And so he does not give us doctrine that we
must follow: but he accuses men of ingratitude, of discourtesie and cruelty,
when he says, The poor is hated even of his own neighbor. The ingratitude
which is committed in the hate of the poor is against God. For whosoever
hates the poor, he does not acknowledge the benefits which he has
received of God, without his deserts. We are al naturally borne poor both in
body and soul, and are void and naked of all benefits, and cannot obtain
either corporal or spiritual, unless God of his only grace and free goodness
do give them us without having respect unto us: for we are so corrupted and
malicious of nature, that we provoke him so much as we can to make us poor,
and to destroy us rather then to do us good, and save us. First of all,
touching our body, if we consider our conception in the womb of our mother,
we shall know, how poor a thing we are: that we were very weak and sickly,
and that we could have no nourishment nor increase but of God: for seeing the
government of mothers, which is then very disordered, and their lusts
unbridled, immediately man should perish, if God did not wonderfully as it
were preserve and fortify him. This poor state of man, and the help of God
are well expressed in Job. And when we are borne we bring no riches with us.
If we have any necessay and profitable thing for this body, it is the gift of
God: as Job. 10 8. and 1. 21. 1. Tim. 6. 7. Mat. 6. 11. 25
we confess when we ask our daily bread. And our Lord does reach it us,
when he would not have us to take care for this life. Secondly, as touching
our soul, we are no better furnished then was David, who confesses, Behold,
I was borne in iniquity, and in sin has my mother conceived me: And Paul
says, That we were by nature the children. Therefore if we be partakers of
the spiritual and heavenly riches, it comes of the grace and Psalm. 51. 6.
Ephesians. 2. 3. 4. Psalm. 24. 1. and 50. 12.
gift of God, as Saint Paul does pronounce afterward. Now the Lord making us
prtakers of his benefits (for all is his) would have us to confess the
goodness and liberality that he bestows upon us. The which we cannot
truly do: except we submit ourselves wholly to obey the commandementes of his
will, which is, that the riches which he gives us, we should use them as good
disposers of them, distributing by love unto the^ which have need. Let there
be no poor man amongst you. Again, When one of thy brethren with thee is
fallen into poverty, thou shall lend him. Deu. 15. 4. 7. 7. 10.
Again, Thou shall give him, and let it not grieve thine heart to give un to
him. See that thou deal thy bread to the hungry, etc. If we be not diligent
to follow this will, we are unthankful unto God, considering the
bountifulness he uses toward us. Ungentleness Esa. 58. 7.
and cruelty is made manifest, in the hatred of the poor: For he that hates
his neigbour is a manslear: and that is because he exercises not the charity
he ought. They then that charge and burden their neighbors with impostes,
vsuries, and oppressions, which do molest them with law and other wrongs to
destroy them, are here righly accused of churlishness and cruelty. Besides
1. John. 3. 1^.
the said accusation, Solomon does show that it is a very miserable thing to be
poor, except we can patiently bear it, and do not fear what man can do unto
us. As touching the second part of this present sentence, which is,

But the friends of the rich are many: Solomon does not rebuke and blame
those which are truly the friends of the rich: for it is not lawful for us to
hate any man, but it is rather commanded us to love our neighbors, without
regard of persons. Likewise they which truly love the rich, do not procure
to themselves any profit to their purse: but if it be needeful, do exhort
them to occupy themselves about their salvation, in giving alms to the
needy, according to the doctrine of our Lord, and of Luke. 6. 9 2. Cor. 8. 7.
and. 9. 6. 1. Tim. 6. 17 Iam. 2. 1
Saint Paul. But he accuses the world of flattery, of accepting of persons
and of covetousness. They which thus behave themselves toward the rich, are
called their friends: not that they are so indeed, but because they seem so
to be, and would be counted such.

21 The sinner despises his neighbor: but he that has mercy on the poor, is
blessed.
Solomon does show us that the world is full of sinners, when he says, The
sinner dispiseth his neighbor: for it is an ordinary thing, that they which
have wealth, and do not acknowledge that that which they enjoy, comes of the
gift of God, do greatly flatter themselves, and think that it comes of their
own labor, travail, wisdom, and cunning, that riches come unto them, they
confess not that they be stewardes of God, but make themselves believe that
it is lawful for them to do as they list with the goods they possess: and
therefore they have no care of the needinesse of their neighbors, but do
despise them, as they do show it in diverse sorts. First of al, in not
helping their necessities by alms. Secondly, in using subtle means, to draw
unto them that little they have. Thirdly, in pulling their substance from them
parforce and violence, or consuming them by suits, by vsuries and other wicked
trades. So that the contempt which is here spoken of, does not only stand in
negligence, but in churlishness and cruelty that they commonly exercise
through all the world, as men do feel it.

Wherefore it is not without cause that the Scripture complains hereof, eue^
through all the Prophets. This cruelty is somewhat Eze. 22. 29.
signified, when it is not said that the sinner does despise strangers and
unknown, his enemies and adversaries: but it is said that he despises his
neighbor: that is to say, him of whom he ought to take care and compassion,
and to help him by love in his necessities. The cruelty also is signified by
the Antithesis that Solomon Luke. 10. 3^*
makes here, when he says:

But he that has mercy on the poor, is blessed. For against despising, he
sets mercy, which is contrary unto cruelty. For by cruelty men spoil and
rauishe, and do all the hurt they can in the world to their neighbor: and by
mercy, we lend, and give liberally, as also the word which Solomon uses
does signify. And when the merciful man is set against the sinner, then does
it show us that albeit by the corruption of our flesh, sin, dwells in us:
yet is not the same imputed unto us, nor we counted sinners but righteous, so
long as we are merciful. The wicked borrows, and pays not again: but the
righteous is merciful and gives. Psalm. 37. 21 and. 112. 5. 9.


Again, A good man is merciful and lends: he has distributed and given to
the poor, etc. Not that our mercifulness can deserve such reputation: but
because God of his only grace does accept and allow it, and is author
thereof. It is not simply said, that has mercy: for they which are at their
ease, and have all things necessary for them, have no need of mercy to be
showed to them: and therefore Solomon adds, on the poor. These are they
which have great need to be pitied: as also God does carefully will the same
by his word, and it is not without cause: for they have the most need of
favor, succor, and help: and there are no people in the world more despised,
worse handeled, nor more trodden down and oppressed then are they. By
experience we may see it: and also God often complains thereof, by his
Prophets. Therefore if it happen us to fall into the number of the miserable,
and afflicted, and that we are despised, yet let us not be discouraged, nor
despair, as though God had forsaken us, and cares not for us. For if we be
despised, it is of sinners who are not acquainted with GOD. But look what
sinners do esteem, that is rejected of GOD, and that which they do despise
and reject, is received and allowed of God. Therefore we must not fear the
contempt Psalm. 3. 5.
of the world, nor yet be coupled with sinners, for to consent with them to
despise the afflicted, when we feel ourselves at our ease, and have
prosperity: otherwise it would turn to our woe. Solomon does not here
signify it, when he promises blessing unto them that are merciful unto the
afflicted. This blessing shall Luke 24. and 16. 22.
not only continue in this world, but for ever: as also shall the woe of the
wicked. And albeit that prosperity and felicity is promised unto our mercy,
yet is it not enough to obtain such blessing: but because that GOD receives
and allows it, Psalm. 41. 2. Mat. 25. 34. and 5. 7.
because we are elected before all time, and has prepared for us this
blessing before the beginning or foundation of the world was laid.

22 Do not they err that imagine evil? but to them that think on good
things, shall be mercy and truth.
Forasmuch as the world is full of men which imagine malice, and which devise
evil things against God, and against their neighbors, it follows right well
that the number is right great of them which hold not the right way, but do
err and go astray, following the ways of destruction. Solomon does signify
this same, when he asks, saying:

Do not they err which imagine evil? And forasmuch as there is none of us
al which desires to err, that is to say, to go astray, and wander out of the
way, but would al walk in a right path, and come unto the end of our
purpose, and not to be put beside our intentes, except we be out of our
wits, void of sound judgment, and perfect reason: since I say we desire
the same, or at the leastwise do labor to make ourselves believe that our will
is such: therefore for to obtain the same, we must diligently take heed that
we follow not them which imagine evil. And for to do this let us not be
like unto the superstitious and idolaters, which forge idols, some of wood,
gold and silver, or of other visible, palpable and gross matter: othersome,
of traditions and men's inventions, good customs, fantasies and intentes. They
devise and imagine nothing but evil, though they falsely believe that by such
trashe and ab homination, they do honor and serve God. But the Lord, whom no
good thing can displease, does well show, that there is nothing but evil in such
service, when he declares, that he abhors and rejects them: as it is well
taught us by the first table of Moses, and by the Prophets. They make
themselves Esaias. 29. 1^. and 40. 18. and 41. 6. and 44. 9.
believe that they serve GOD, herein they fail and know not what they do,
so at the last they shall be confounded: The Idolaters shall not inherit the
kingdom of heaven. Secondarily, let us not join with these mockers and
scorners, which boldly despise and blaspheme God and his doctrine: as though
that were but fables and dreams, which the Pastors and Ministers of the
Church do preach to them. Such kind of people are imaginers of evil, when
they fight against God, who is enemy unto al evil, and when they set his holy
law (which is the rule of al goodness, so much as possible they can) at
naught. In the which doing, they do greatly err, and are far wide: as
appears by this saying: Woe unto them that seek deep, to hide their counsel
from the Lord, Esaias. 2^. 15.
etc. Such men think, or at the least labor to make themselves believe, that
there is neither God, nor Devil, neither heaven nor hell: but at the last they
shall feel that they have erred. For the cruel man shall cease, and the
scornful shall be consumed. Therefore will I choose out their delusions, and I
will bring their fear upon them, because I called, and none would answer,
Esaias. 66. 4.
etc.

Thirdly, let us not think that in hurting and doing evil unto our
neighbors we can prosper: though the greatest part of the world be of this
opinion. For as we may see, some think to creep aloft by pride and ambition,
by rebellion and disobedience: some by murders, seditions, hatreds, malice,
and insurrections: some by theftes, snatching, usury, and wicked bargains:
some by whoredoms and adulteries, and other some by flatteries, false tales
and slaunderings. But they err and be deceived, seeing they turn themselves
from the right ways of the commandementes of the Lord, and follow the wide
and broad way Math. 7. 1^.
which leads to destruction. This destruction is well signified by error, and
also by the Antithesis that Solomon makes, when he says,

But to them that think on good things, shall be mercy and truth. When he
speaks thus, he debyeth mercy and truth unto those that imagine evil.
Whereupon it follows that they cannot look but for destruction and damnation
partly in this world. For as they are filled with malice, craft, deceit,
wrong, violence and cruelty against GOD and their neighbors: even so does
God render and pay them the like, stirring up enemies against them, even such
as they have been to others. And finally, for to fyl up the measure of their
destruction, he will utterly deprive them of his favor and mercy, bestowing no
part of his gracious promises upon them and will send them to eternal
damnation.

Contrarily, unto them which think well, that is to say, which have set their
love on the law of the Lord, for to give him the honor which he damandeth
thereby, and for to serve and profit their neighbors, shall be granted mercy
and truth. For as they labor to be faithful unto God, by giving true
obedience unto his word, and being gentle unto their neighbors, giving them
faithfully all their duty: even so the Lord will make them partakers of his
true and infallible promises: he will raise them up, according as they shall have
need, such men as will show them favor, and entreat them with all meekness
and gentleness, and such as will imagine no treason or other wickedness
against them: neither shall cease to do the^ good, according to his faithful
and gracious promises, until that in the heavenly joy and felicity he give
the^ the full fruition of the^. For his merciful kindness is ever more and more
toward us: and the Psa. 117. 2.
truth of the Lord endures for ever. Let us note that Solomon does not preach
unto us the merit of our works, when he promises mercy and truth unto them
which think good things: but he would have us while we give ourselves unto
goodness that we should not praise our thoughts and operations, as though there
were any worthiness or excellency in us, which might move or bind God to do
us good. But that we should stay ourselves upon the gentleness, goodness, or
mercy of the Lord, by the which only, he is moved to love us, and to do us good
according to his gracious promises, in the performing whereof he shows the
truth of his grace only, and not for to give us that which our works do
deserve: for he can owe us Romans 4. 13.
nothing. For the promise was not made unto Abraham to be the heir of the
world by the law, but by the righteousness of faith. Romans 3. 24. 25. and. 15.
2. 2. Cor. 1. 20.
Secondly, let us note, that Solomon is here no law giver, but an Evangelist,
leading us unto Jesus Christ. For we obtain no mercy, but by him only. For the
promises of God are yea and amenin him.

23 In all labor there is abundance: but the talk of the lips brings
only want.
Solomon here before has spoken many sentences, for to exhort Pro. 6. 6.
and. 10. 45. and. 12. 11. 27. 13. 4. 11. 23. and 14. 4. Gene. 3. 1^.
us unto care and diligence, unto labor and travail. And if we were such as
we ought to be, to wit, very careful to obey the word of the Lord, and
willing to bear the burden which he lays upon us: Solomon should not have
needed to have pronounced these sentences. But because we are like unto asses,
which make no diligent speed, except they be often beaten: and unto restie
iades which when they are spurred, run backwarde, except the riders do
prick them sharply with the spur, with stroke upon stroke: for this cause,
Solomon does exhort us now again to labor: when he says,

In all labor there is abundance. It seems at the first sight that Solomon
repugneth that which is written, The earth shall bring forth unto thee,
thorns and thistles, and thou shall eat the herb of the field. When thou
shall til the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength.
And I will break the Gene. 3. 18. and. 4. 12. Leui. 26. 19. 20. Deuteronomy. 28. 16
pride of your power, and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as
brass. And your strength shall be spent in vain, etc. Again, Cursed shall thou
be in the town, and cursed also in the field, etc. And this same which is
pronounced in these scriptures, comes often to pass, as experience shows
it. I answer, That Solomon speaks of the nature of labor, and of that which
naturally happens, so that we do not hinder it by our ingratitude,
infidelity, idolatry, superstition, rebellion, disobedience, pride,
ungentleness, cruelty, and other wickedness, wherewith the world is wholly
infected and corrupted. He does then teach us, that if we hate, detest and
abhor al kind of wickedness, we walk in the fear of God reuerencing his
word, by putting our whole trust in his goodness, and to follow his will,
that GOD will bless our labor, and make us abound in wealth, and whatsoever
we take in hand, or apply our minds and spirit unto, shall prosper.

Herein he speaks agreeably unto that which the Sainte^ have felt, and
according as God has promised in his law and by the Prophets. The Patriarchs
were blessed of God, who prospered their labor and the work of their hands:
in such wise that they did abound in riches. And the promises are written in
the places alleged before, and in the 128. Psalm. And albeeit that in Psalm.
128.
the sight of the eyes we judge not that there is abundance in the labor of
them which fear God: for oftentimes the same accidents happened to them as to
the wicked: and also they are robbed, or their Eccle. 9. 2.
hire is keep from them, or else they are contented with a little gain:
Nevertheless, the labor changes not his nature, and GOD is true in his
promises, after the which we must not give them abundance, the which does not
always consist in superfluity, nor in multitude of great riches of this
world: but chiefly in contentation, and in this that God knows to be
expedient. For the same does better furnish, and is also of greater profit,
then greater abundance of the wicked.

Furthermore, though they which fear GOD and are diligent in labor, should
suffer great want, yet is it not to say but that God is true in his promises:
for how much soever we fear God, yet does he always find enough in us to
be amended, and may justly chasten us as he pleases. Therefore let us not
judge of Gods promises after man's reason, nor after the sight of our eyes: but
let every one of us carefully and faithfully occupy himself in his work,
praying unto GOD that it would please him to give it good success and
prospering it as he shall know to be expedient. And let us not be like unto
those which give themselves unto slothfulness and ydlenes, to vanity and
foolishnes, and pass away their time in jesting and scoffing in merry tales,
and idle words: and yet notwithstanding, they desire abundance to live
plentifully and wealthily, and at their ease, as if they were well worthy. But
they do not obtain according to their desire: for even as they deserve, God
brings them unto extreme poverty. Solomon does signify it when he says,

But the talk of the lips brings only want: When he sets the talk of
the lips, against labor, and that he threateneth it with want, let us know
that under the talk of the lips, he comprehends not thanksgiving,
prayers, praises, holy exhortations and instructions which the faithful make
with their lips: for since they proceed from a pure and perfect heart, they
ought not to be attributed unto the lips, nor threatened with want. For, for
such holy exercises the faithful will not give over nor forsake labor. But yet
that popish divine service, and all the disputations and sermons of their
divines and hypocrites, ought to be attributed unto the talk of the lips:
seeing they proceed not from a good Romans 10. 17. 18. 1. Tim. 6. 3. 4. 5. 2.
These. 3. 6. Phi. 3. 18. 19.
heart, nor sound judgment: for they know not what they say: they are led
with curiousness, tending unto ostentation and vaineglory, not desiring to
serve Jesus Christ, but their belly. Such rakehelles do worthily deserve to
want and perish for hunger, and not only with temporal hunger, but do deserve
eternal damnation.

24 The crown of the wise is their riches: and the folly of fools is
foolishness.
It is a thing more often proved then were to be wished, that they are
nothing set by which have nothing or very little: and they which cannot or do
not labor to gather riches abundantly, are judged fools and dizzardes. But
they which are rich, are highly honored and praised: the which causes them
to be so greatly desired of al men. For besides this that men are glad not to
want, they also love to be in estimation and honor: and they that can so
guide themselves, are counted wise, and men of honesty. Wheretoo it seems at
the first sight that Solomon agrees here, when he says, The crown of the
wise, etc. But if we consider the thing thoroughly, we shall easily see that
Solomon is not of this judgment and opinion. For he says not generally,
riches: as if it behooved the wise, for to have glory and honor, to be rich
with the abundance of worldly wealth: seeing that they which are truly wise,
do despise and reject the wealth of the world, and do gather it, but only
meanly for to get their daily bread, without a disordered desire, with doing
wrong unto their neighbor, either by catching, or by too great sparing and
niggardliness. But he says, their riches: that is to say, the riches which
belong unto the wise, and by the which they become truly rich. Therefore for
to understand what is meant by the crown of the wise, we must know what
their riches are. Solomon has showed us here before, that the fear of the
Lord is wisdom, knowledge, and Pro. 1. 5. 8. 9. and 2. 1. and. 3. 13 and 4.
5. and 8. 10 11. 14. and 10 14. and 14. 18.
understanding. Such kind of riches are the chief crown of the wise. And yet
if they abound in the riches of this world, as the holy old Fathers did,
they are also their crown: for with wisdom can they possess them, and
spend them as need requires. Now that by their riches Solomon chiefly
means the former virtues, he does show it, by the Antithesis he makes,
when he says,

And the folly of fools is foolishness. For he sets folly, (which is
contrary unto wisdom) against the riches of the wise: as if he said, The
folly of fools cannot be, nor known but for folly, the which is so
detestable as none dare challenge the same to be his: albeit that she is as an
Empress in the world, and that the great Emperors, Kings, and Princes do
obey her, and make their pleasures of it: as they do show, when they take it
not in good part, that any man should turn them from it to bring them unto
wisdom: but they hate and cruelly persecute the wise. And yet for all this
they will not be counted fools, but will be praised and honored as wise, and
know well, how to maintain their honor, as they think, when they praise
themselves more then God. For if any of them do never so grievously offend
God, they care not for it: but if a man chance to speak of their worship or
Lordship, otherwise then they would, that man has committed, in their
judgment an unpardonable offense. Al these kinds of doing do well show that
naturally we al praise and extol wisdom: but by the corruption of our nature
we have a wrong judgment: in such wise that we judge wisdom, to be
folly, and do extol folly Esaias. 5. 2^. 21
in stead of wisdom, the which is no small offense. As touching the rest, as
the wise do use the riches that God gives them, as they ought, and therein
do declare their wisdom, for the which they be praised: even so the foolish,
which know not or will not know, for what use God has created the riches of
this world, do use them with all intemperancie and dissolution, or with great
avarice do make more spare then needs, fearing least the world would fail
them. And thus do they declare their folly, the which does dishonor and make
them conte^ptible before the eyes of them which have a right judgment: as they
well deserve, not only for that they rule themselves as fools and dizzardes,
hurting themselves by too much prodigality or nigardlinesse, but chiefly by
that that they are ungentle and cruel: seeking nothing but the hurt of their
neighbors: although that at the first sight it seems not so, and also that
they are persuaded, it is not ill done to use their wealth at their pleasure.
They are easily persuaded theretoo, when wealth comes in as they would, and
that they prosper after a worldly manner. For then they cannot peaceably and
reasonably use their commodities: but the flesh which feels too much of his
ease, does ouerflowe and play the fool: as we have seen the people of Israel
to have done. The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose Exo. 32. 6.
Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
up again to play. And Moses does blame them for it: but he that should
have been upright, when he waxed fat, spurned with his heel. We may now
see the same chiefly in Kings and Princes, to whom it seems, that what they
have, is rightly dew to them, and will neither know nor understand that the
glory, power and riches they have, come from God, and that it is a singular
gift of GOD, even his work, for a man to rule well in these matters. In this
sort they forget God and their neighbors, and do exalt themselves, not caring
whom they hurt. It is enough for them to be at their ease, and to be earnest
to punish and torment others: as Saul did to David.

25 A faithful witness delivers souls: but a deceiue^ speaks lies.
There is none that bears good will but desires to pleasure his neighbors,
and we think that we al have this desire, and we make ourselves believe so
much as we can, we would not leave them in necessity, but to deliver them
as we are able, even out of the greatest necessities, for to show and for to be
counted their great friends. Now the greatest good turn that we can do for
any man, is to help to save his life: as it is very plain. For there is no
man which had not rather loose al his goods, then to loose his life. But
because every man knows not the way how to proceed to save his neighbors
life, therefore Solomon does teach it us, when he says,

A faithful witness delivers souls. And forasmuch as there is none but God
only which is true, unless he communicate his truth by his word, we
cannot do this pleasure unto our neighbors, to save their lives, except we be
diligent to receive the word to speak after it, and to give ourselves to do
the works which it teaches us. This is the way which we must hold for to
be a true witness. But albeit there is but this one way, yet may we show
ourselves true witnesses in diverse sorts. If being called in judgment for to
bear witness of the truth, or being ordained judges, we speak truth:
although that upon our deposition, oath or sentence, they lead our neighbor
to the gallows, and that he be hanged, yet do we not cease to be true
witnesses, and to deliver souls. For when Solomon speaks of the deliverance
of souls, he means the innocent who are wrongfully troubled, and are in
danger of their lives, except that God raise them up true witnesses. And also
when we witness, or speak truth against the wicked for to send him to
death: though we save not his life, yet do we not cease to be a true
witness, and to saueliues. For in purchasing the punishment of the wicked,
we are cause that diverse do live in peace and rest: and thus do we preserve
and save lives: the which is a very acceptable thing before God, who will have
the Magistrate Deuteronomy. 17. 6. Romans 13. 3. 1. Tim. 2. 2.
to punish the malefactor upon the oath of two or three witnesses, that the
evil being purged, we might live in peace. Now if the Lord be careful of such
corporal and temporal saving and preserving, let us understand that by a far
stronger reason he takes care for the spiritual and eternal saving of lives:
as he has always showed, when he has raised up true men which have given
themselves to show the way of truth unto his people: as were Noe, Abraham,
Loath, Moses, Joshua, the Judges, the holy kings and Prophets. And not content
heerewith, he has sent his own Son, who not only was a true and faithful
witness for to preach deliverance as a minister and servant: but by himself has
made the purgation of our sins, sheadding his most precious blood for the
eternal redemption of our souls. And if the deliverance of our Heb. 1. 3. and
9. 12. Romans 8. 32.
souls be so precious before God, that he has not spared his own Son, it
follows therefore that we must be careful thereof before al other things:
otherwise we are great contemners of God, and renounce to be saved and redeemed
by Jesus Christ: the which is to do him great injury, and consequently to put
our souls in bondage with the Devil, for to loose them and not to deliver and
save them. Now for to be careful of our deliverance, we must as Jesus Christ
has sent us his Apostles and disciples for to be true witnesses unto us, and
as much as lay in their ministry, have delivered us from death and damnation:
even so still now we should demand of him such Pastors and ministers, which
will be true witnesses, who will declare nothing unto us but the pure word of
God, to the which if we cleave by faith and repentance, they shall deliver our
souls. But if in steed hereof, we have itching ears, let us look 2. Tim.
4. 3.
for bondage and destruction: as Solomon does signify, when he says, But a
deceiuer speaks lies. Forasmuch as he sets the deceiuer against a true
witness, and lies against deliverance, he teaches us that false witnesses
seek nothing else but to hold their neighbors captive, and to destroy them:
following therein their father the Devil, who from the beginning, has been a
liar and a murderer. But as they are the most profitable witnesses, which
John. 8. 44.
preach unto us Jesus Christ: even so the most exquisite deceivers are they
which under the shadow of religion do set forth men's traditions, and
doctrines of Devils, vain speculations and subtle questions. For such, so
much as they can, do shut up the kingdom of heaven from men, and do deliver
them unto the Devil. And the other deceivers do bring hurt either unto our
goods, or to our name, or to this present life, the which is but a small damage
in comparison of the loss of our souls. Nevertheless the world is so much
given unto temporal riches, and makes so great account of his good name and
loves this life so well, that he cares nothing for his salvation, and fears
more the deceivers which bring temporal hurt, then those which destroy them
for ever: yea he is so blind that he honoreth them.

26 In the fear of the Lord is an assured strength, and his children shall
have hope.
It is a great comfort for us, when we think that our neighbors are so well
affectionate toward us, that we may trust them that they will not labor to
do us any hurt, but show us al favor pleasure, and gentleness. Now
forasmuch as al men are liars and their help vain, and that there is none but
God only true, and that hope only in him confounds not: in as much as he
never fails to grant as he requires: we must therefore conclude that they
which trust in him, shall not loose their hope. If we may once know his good
affection toward us, and so trust in him, assuring ourselves that he would us
nothing but good, we should be thereby a great deal more be comforted then
with all the good opinions we can conceive of men. For let the man be never
so wise or good, yet is he unconstant and mutable: but God is faithful Number.
23. 19. Esaias. 55. 8. 9 10. 11.
and changes not his mind. But to the end that we conceive not a vain
consolation, falsely believing that we have a strong hope in God when we have
but a light opinion of his promises, and yet will give ourselves license to do
after our own fantasy, and are bold to follow our good intentes, or to live in all dissolutenes after the affection of our corrupt nature, the which demands
nothing but liberty of the flesh, to the end (I say) that we conceive not
this vain consolation, Solomon does teach us, where we shall find strong
hope, when he says, In the fear of the Lord is an assured strength. If then
we will be assured that God will not destroy us, but assist us and provide for us
al things necessary, both for our soul and body, and will not forsake us
til he has placed us in his heavenly kingdom, we must then have the fear of
the Lord as the good old fathers fearing God stayed themselves upon him Heb.
11. 4. Psalm. 34. 8. and 145. 19. 20
by faith, as we may see by the history of their life. We are exhorted to
receive this fear: and also taught what we have to do for to live therein.
And David promises salvation to those which fear him. But seeing that we
cannot strongly trust in God, except we love him, as he requires, it might
seem that to have a strong hope, we must not then fear: for fear stands
not in love, I answer, if we know that God loves us, we do surely trust
in him, and will not fear to present ourselves before him, and are well disposed
and minded 1. John. 4. 18.
to tarry the last day of judgment, being persuaded of the fatherly love of
God toward us, who never fails us at need. For perfect love casts out
fear: yea the fear which terrifieth, troubles and tormenteth the conscience,
causing man to feel himself charged and burdened with great burdens of sin,
dare not offer himself to God: but does fear him, as a thief that is taken,
fears the presence of the judge, and trembles being delivered into the
hands of the hangman for to be executed. This is the fear which tormenteth,
the which is not in his heart that is perfect in love, that is to say, which is
well persuaded that God loves him. Solomon does not speak now of such kind of
fear, but of the same that David teaches, and which also has been often
spoken of. Solomon calls the trust which is in this fear, strong, for to
advertise Psalm. 34. 1^. Pro. 1. 7. and 2. 5. and. 3. 7. and 8. 13. and 9. 1^
and 10. 27. and 14. 2. 16. Psalm. 34. 8. Esaias. 33. 1, 6
us that it is but vanity, when without this fear we think we trust in God:
contrarily, he that fears God, shall never be shaken to fall. For the fear he
has in God, is as an invincible fortress. The Angel of the Lord does pitche
his tents round about them which fear him, etc. The Lord is exalted: for
he dwells on high: he has filled Sion with judgment and justice: and
there shall be stabilitie of thy time, strength, salvation, wisdom, and
knowledge: for the fear of the Lord shall be his treasure. Wherein we may see
that the Papists have not the fear of the Lord, when they stand in
continual doubt, whither God love them or not: for they have no sound
knowledge. After that Solomon has taught us that in the fear of the Lord
there is assured strength, he shows us who they be which have this trust,
and consequently the fear of the Lord, when he says, And his children
shall have hope. Forasmuch as the assurance or strong trust is in the fear of
the Lord, and there are none but the children of God which are Psalm. 34. 12.
exhorted unto this fear, and none besides the^ do receive it, therefore it
follows well, there are none but they which have assured strength. Therefore if
we desire to be assured of strong hope, we must then become the children of
God to obtain it. The which we shall obtain, 1. John. 1. 12.
if we receive Jesus Christ. And although, being the children of God we shall
suffer much, and that it shall seem by the evils that we shall suffer, that God
has rejected us, and that for this cause we have good occasion to be afraid
and to be troubled as pore slaves under the bondage of a cruel tyrant:
nevertheless, seeing that therein we are made like unto the Son of God, who
having borne the shame of the cross sits on the right hand of God, we must
be assured that our miseries cause not God to deny us for his children.
Therefore when afflictions shall prick and pinche us, let us Heb. 12. 2. Romans
8. 35. Heb. 12. 5. Mat. 7.
not doubt of the fatherly goodness of GOD toward us, but let us ask of him
his holy spirit, and we shall not be refused nor denied.

27 The fear of the Lord is a wellspring of life, to avoid the snares of
death.
Solomon shows us that there is strong hope and assurance for the children of
God, which fear him, when he compares it unto the lively spring, and that
he compares the children of God unto beasts, which are hunted and driven into
the nets and toil which are set for them that they may be taken and slain.
Now it is not without cause that he uses such comparisons or similitudes for
to show the estate of the children of God which fear him. For first of all the
children of God are Pilgrims and passengers in this world* for we have no
continual abiding city here: for the land is mine, Heb. 13. 14. Leui. 25. 23.
Psalm. 39. 13.
and ye are but strangers and so iourners with me. Wherefore let us confess,
I am a stranger with thee, etc. And in this voyage they are subject unto many
labors, afflictions and temptations: wherewith they are so changed, that if
they were not watered with the fear of the Lord, they should faint through
despair, and should have no sure trust in God: and so should perish. As a
way faring man, weary and thirsty in his way, if he can find no water to
quench his thirst, does perish: but if he know of any fountain or spring
that is near, he rejoices, hoping that ere it beelong he will refreshe and
cool himself, and slake his thirst, and be more strong: even so, he that
truly has the fear of the Lord, knows he is near unto the living water,
also that he is compassed about therewith and has it in himself: for the
spring of living waters, which is God, dwells in him, who mainteineth him,
quickens and comfort him in all his temptations, labors and calamities.
Thy mercy, O Lord, reaches unto the heavens, and thy faythfulnesse unto the
clouds. Contrarily, Jeremy says, O Lord the Psalm. 36. 5. Iere. 17. 13.
hope of Israel, all that forsake thee, shall be confounded: they that depart
from thee, shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord,
the fountain of living waters. Now as God is the fountain or living vain,
and that he is the spring, it is not by it to provide for himself, but for
them which fear him: for it is for them, for whom he cares. What man is he
Psalm. 23. 12. Esaias. 66. 2.
that fears the Lord? him will he teach the way that he shall choose. And
to him will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit and
trembles at my words. Likewise the faithful are partakers of this spring,
not to water themselves alone therewith, but to the end that they may power
out streams of rivers unto their neighbors: and to the end that as God has
given them his fear, for they have it not of themselves: Gather my people
together, and I will cause them hear my words, that they may learn to fear
me all the days that they shall live upon Deuteronomy. 4. 10.
the earth, and that they may teach their children. And I will give them one
heart and one way that they may fear me for ever, for Ier. 32. 39. Psalm. 34.
12. Pro. 10. 11. and. 13. 14.
the wealth of them and of their children after them. So also they may teach
others according to that which is written, Come children, hearken unto me, I
will teach you the fear of the Lord. Solomon does signify it also somewhat,
in his. 5. chapter and. 16. verse, but more manifestly in other places. We must
not be niggardes in distributing of these waters: for in giving of them, we
diminish nothing at all thereby, but rather increase, and in so doing we give
nothing of our own, but are only the ministers and stewardes of our Lord
Jesus Christ to whom only belongs these waters, and he only gives: and
therefore we must resort to him for he also does Esa. 55. 1. John. 4. 10. 14.
and 7. 37. 38.
call us. If we obey to this calling, we shall want nothing. Behold thus much
concerning the first similitude. As touching the second where Solomon says,
to avoid the snares of death: Let us note that the state of those which fear
God, is such, that as it is written, Romans 8. 36.
For thy sake are we killed al day long, and counted as sheep for the
slaughter. And Satan, the world, and their own flesh do set nets for to
take them, and to destroy them for ever: but by the fear of the Lord, they
which do lead them to conform themselves unto his will, to obey him, and to
put their trust in him, do avoid death: for albeit that the wicked kill the
body, yet have they no power over the soul: the which not consenting unto the
temptations of Satan, nor to the lusts of the flesh, overcomes death and al
his forces, and perceth unto the heavenly bliss, from the which it shall never
be put back. And thus they avoid the snares of death, not of themselves, but
for that that the Lord does hear them and deliver them. We see therefore
that it is very profitable for us to obey the exhortation of Saint Paul, which
Psa. 34. 18. Phi. 2. 12.
says, So make an end of your own salvation with fear and trembling. That
which Solomon attributes here unto the fear of the Lord, he does in an
other place attribute unto instruction of the Pro. 13. 14.
wise, and that very sitly: for whosoever is truly wise, has the fear of the
Lord, and he that fears him, is wise, and his instruction tends to lead
his neighboors unto this fear, which is the first and chief part of wisdom.

28 In the multitude of the people is the honor of a king: and for the want of
people comes the destruction of the Prince.
Solomon by the king and by the Prince, does understand all those which have
power, and are ordained for to govern some country or religion. Such kind of
men commonly do think themselves in high honor and majesty, when by the
credit and authority that isgiuen to them by flatterers, either by violences
that they exercise, or by the abundance of their riches, they make themselves
to be reverenced and feared, and that no man dare behold them, but in
trembling wise, or in having them in more high admiration then they ought: for
they also know well (as they think) how to maintain their honor, even with
the contempt of God, without whom nevertheless they have no pre-eminence, nor
authority. And if it were not that God causes his majesty to shine in them,
for to make his ordinance to be regarded, and that pollice should be ordered,
to put away confusion, and that the good and innocent might live in peace and
rest, no man would make any more account of them, then of the worms of the
earth: for their own parts, they are no better, albeeit that for the degree
and dignity that God has given them, they are called the children of God, and
that we ought to submit ourselves, with all humbleness, Psa. 82. 6.
reverence and obedience unto them, so that it be according as God will have
it. But in seeking magnifically these former things, they abuse themselves
greatly: as Solomon does show it when he says, In the multitude of people is
the honor of the king, etc. The Lords and Princes of the earth for to come to
honor, must labor then to get a multitude of subjects, and to hold them
under their obedience and government. The which shall easily be done, if
first they do yield themselves obedient unto God, following his Deuteronomy. 17. 16
commandment, and that they become not like unto Pharao, king of Egypt, who
afflicted the children of Israel, lest that they should multiply in his land:
but let them cause the law touching strangers, to be observed: and let them
follow good Kings, as David, Iosaphat, Leui. 19. 33. 34.
Ezekias, and Josias. So doing, they shall defend themselves, and shall be truly
reverenced and feared, and shall not falsely and in vain usurp these titles so
honorable, the which do not appertain unto favorers and nourrishers of
seditious and rebels, of dissolute and careless, of wicked, scorners and
contemners of God and of his word: but do belong unto them which truly
confess their sovereign Lord, of whom they receive their honor, and uphold
good policy, not only Civil, but also Ecclesiastical: to the end that their
people may learn to fear and honor God, by living i^ peace and quietness,
in love and good brotherly concord together. Otherwise the people shall be
constrained to scatter abroad, and to be dispersed as sheep going astray,
when they have no shephearde. Now as a shephearde loosing his flock, is
undone: even so Kings and Princes, suffering by evil government their people
to scatter here and there, are void of honor, and do overthrow and destroy
themselves. Solomon does so affirm, when he says, And for the want of
people comes the destruction of the Prince. First of al let us note that the
want of people comes not chiefly through changing of country, when they fly
from the yoke of their natural prince: but when there is confusion amongst the
people by divisions, sects, conspiracies, seditions, insurrections, sturres,
debates, vproares, and rebellions. Then principlaities and kingdoms cannot
stand: whereupon follows the destruction of the prince: for he can be no
prince without a princedome, no more then an head is a head of those members
that cleave and join not unto him. Secondly, let us note, that forasmuch as
the honor of the king stands in multitude of people, and not in a co^fused
and scattered multitude, that thereof it well follows, that such a multitude is
not worthy to be named a people, but a sort of Lions, wolves, serpents,
dogs, swyne, yea Devils incarnate. Thirdly, that it is laweful for kings and
Princes to desire a great people, and to labor to increase the number of
their subjects by good government, and not by wars: for so far is it of
that by such troubles the number should increase, that rather it does decay,
and the Princes come to destruction, as experience shows. Also it is lawful
for them to seek honor, and to maintain their honor for the 3. Sam. 15. and
16. 1. Kings. 12. Dan. 4. 26. and 5. 1.
profit and sauegarde of the people, and to hold them under fear, least they
should fall away and reuolte. And for to do it rightly, let them diligently
take heed from seeking honor as did Absalom, and as did Roboam, Nabuchadnezer,
and Balthazer.

29 He that is slow to wrath, is of great wisdom: but he^ that is of an
hasty mind, exalts folly.
There are diverse in the world which will count a man to be a fool and an
ass, and to have no heart when (as they say) he dares not look a man in the
face, for to be angry immediately, and is not ready for to be suddenly
revenged upon him that has done him wrong. Wherein they show that they know
not God nor his ways, or else do judge God to be but a fool and an Ass: for
from the beginning of the world he has been outraged by man, even in such
wise as he has deserved that God should root him out, but he has showed
himself to be slow to anger, and not only then, but also in all ages: for
he has not punished men so soon as they have provoked him to wrath against
them by their transgressions and rebellions, but has showed himself to be
patient, gentle, pitiful, and merciful, looking and calling me^ unto
repentance. The Lord, The Lord, strong, merciful, and gracious. slow to
anger, and abundant in goodness and truth. etc. The Lord is full of Exo. 34.
6. Psalm. 103. 8. Esaias. 55. 7. Romans 2. 4.
compassion and mercy, slow to anger, and of great kindness. They which know
the Lord to be such, will not count him a fool and an ass, but wise,
prudent, and discrete: and they also would esteem them to be of great
wisdom which follow the ways of their Creator: as Solomon does here, when
he says, He that is slow to wrath, is of great wisdom. It is not without
cause that he calls this wisdom, great: for first of al it is given of God,
whose gifts we must not count of small price, little worth, and contemptible: for
there comes nothing from him, but is of great value and excellent, and ought
to be esteemed highly. Secondly, we have the lusts of our flesh, which
belong naturally unto us, by the corruption that is in us: ane for this cause
are very hard to be tamed: and therefore the wisdom requires to be great,
which may overcome them, and keep them under subjection: otherwise we should
burn with impatiencie, and should be kindeled with anger and wrath, and
should be violently carried with a desire of soden reuengement upon those which
do us wrong, or which are too good in our opinion: as Cain was against Abel,
the Pharisees against our Lord Jesus Christ, the careless and dissolute against
them which seek nothing but their salvation. Now not to be like unto such
furious fellows, Mat. 5. 44. Ephe. 4. 2. Col. 3. 12.
let us obey our Lord, who says, Love your enemies: and S. Paul, Thus doing,
we shall give true signs, that we are slow to wrath, and that we are of
great wisdom: not that it is lawful to desire to be praised for our
wisdom, but that thereby we should give example of gentleness, meekness,
softness and clemency unto our neighbors, and should give them cause to
praise GOD, who makes his gifts and graces to shine in us. And yet let us
take heed from esteeming our wisdom to be great, as though there could be
added: but let us know, as the truth is, that we greatly err, and have
great need that God should maintain us in wisdom, and increase the same in
us, otherwise we should soon be destitute thereof, and should become amassed
and furious, and in steed to show forth great wisdom, we should utter
and set forth openly folly: as though it were some great virtue, for which it
were laweful too seek honor and glory, Solomon does signify it, saying,

But he that is of an hasty mind, exalts folly: as do now these mad and
bransicke men, which rise up without any cause against the servants of God.
They are not ashamed to have their folly seen: They are like Lions or Wolves,
roaring after the poor sheep, and yet would have men believe that they have
a good cause, and do virtuously, not to suffer themselves to be governed,
after their appetite which seek nothing but their salvation. Herein they so
exalt folly, that we are compelled to see it, except we will close our eyes,
as do their favorers and nourishers which maintain such mad men, in their
wicked and malicious folly. Besides this, let us note, that if our wisdom be
required to be showed, and not to be marked with folly, let us be slow to
wrath and to be angry with them which do us wrong without cause: much less
should we suddenly despite and murmr against our good God when he does
correct us, but let us patiently bear the cross he lays upon us: seeing
he makes us bear no more then we have worthily deserved: moreover, and that
by this chastiseme^t he seeks not our hurt, as do men, but our profits and
salvation: for by this he calls us unto repentance.

30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rotting of the
bones.
Man at the beginning was made, to live, and not to die: for first, God said,
Let us make man like unto our image, etc. And the Gene. 1. 26. and. 2. 7.
Lord God made man of the dust of the earth, and breathed in his face the
breath of life, and the man was a living soul. Hereof was the tree of life,
as a Sacrament. And not only he created him for to live, but also to be in
felicity and joy: as appears by that which is said, The Lord also planted
a garden in Eden. etc. Again, Afterward the Lord said, It is not good that
man should Gene. 38. 1^
live alone, etc. And also this present life is not counted a life, but a very
bitter, and troublesome death, except we live with joy and gladness. Now as we
have been created for to live, even so do we desire the same naturally, and
would not die: but if follow the corruption of our nature, we cannot obtain
our desire, but must die. We see how God gives judgment and sentence of
death against Gene. 6. 7. 1^
al flesh, because that malice was great upon the earth. They which perished
by the same sentence, receiving the judgment of eternal fire, have been set
forth for an example to those which shall live without reverence and fear of
God, wallowing and delighting in this 2. Pet. 2. ^ Luke. 7.
corruption. And therefore Solomon desiring us to avoid death, does teach us
wherein stands the life of man, when he says, A sound heart is the life of
the flesh. By a sound heart, Solomon does signify, the desires, purposes,
and merciful, soft, gracious, and pitiful affections, free from wickedness,
bitterness, from rigor and cruelty. Unto these does he attribute the life
of the flesh, that is to say, to man. If we will understand it of corporal
life, there shall be no inconvenience: for good and sound affections make a man
to live joyfully, which is one of the chief parts of this present life: for
we count ourselves to be in death, except we live joyfully, not after a
worldly and carnal manner, which is not to rejoice in holiness and honesty.
Nevertheless though this present life be common both to the elect and
reprobate, yet is it most meet to understand this sentence to apperteine to
the life to come: not that our sound desires should be worthy thereof, but
by the grace of God it does follow it: and it is a certain truth that they
which are guided with such affections, shall enjoy eternal life. Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God. Now there is none of us which are
naturally sound and pure in heart: and of Mat. 5. 8 Gene. 6. 5. and 8. 21.
Job. 14. 4.
ourselves we cannot have them such, unless that GOD does cleanse and heal
them. Wherefore when Solomon promises life (the which we al desire) unto a
sound heart, he does advertise us to ask, Lord have mercy upon me: Heal
my soul, for I have sinned against thee, Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be
healed, etc. Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within
me. If we will obtain such requests, we must receive the doctrine Psalm. 50.
20. and. 4. 5. Iere. 17. 14. Psalm. 51. 12.
of the Gospel, by faith, the which is called a sound and wholesome doctrine,
not only because it is pure and clean, exempted from all filthiness, from
lying and deceiving: but also because it cleanses purifieth, and quickens the
hearts of those men, whom it pearceth. Saint Paul does give us this same well
to understand, when he sets lies and fables which corrupt the minds and
spirits of 1. Tim. 6. 3 2. Tim* 4. 3. Titus. 1. 9.
men against it. Hereby we may see there is neither health nor life but only
where the Gospel is purely preached and received. By the same it is that Jesus
Christ has brought us life into light: and this is the power of God for to
save al believers. Likewise we may know there is not much health nor life in
the world: for though 2. Tim. 1. 10. Romans 1. 16.
men do purely preach the Gospel, yet are we like unto sick men, to whom
Physic is offered for a remedy to restore life and health, and they refuse
and will none of it: and therefore we have need to be sharply reproved, as
them of Crete. Now that soundness of the heart consists in the former good
affections and desires, Saint Paul does show us, when be would have us to
be sound in faith, in love, and in patience. Solomon also does declare it us
Tit. 1. 9. and. 2. 2.
here, when against a sound heart, he sets envy, saying: But envy is
the rotting of the bones. For envy signifies al sinister, malicious and cruel
affections: albeit that the word which Solomon uses, may be taken in good
part, and chieflly when it is attributed unto God and to his servants, which
desire nothing but his glory, and the salvation of their neighbors: but when
it is set against sound desires, then must we take it in the evil part, for
the contrary affection wherewith they are stained, which are sorry, when they see
the affairs of their neighbors to have good success, though thereby they
sustain no hurt: but they would be alone in prosperity and reputation, and
that other should be Exo. 20. 5. and. 34. 14. 1. Kin. 19. 10 Psalm. 69. 10.
put back and despised: and cannot suffer their neigbours, which are better
then they, to prosper, nor to be praised: but invent and seek their
destruction, without cause. The Devil is the father of such people, which
never ceased til that he had almost quite overthrown mankind: And Caine is
their Captain, whom diverse have followed: as the brethren of Joseph, Saul
against David, the Scribes and Pharisees, and Judas against Jesus Christ: and
now the most part of those which persecute the poor faithful Christians. The
desires of such men are as the rotting of the bones. For as by the rotting of
the bones man falls to death: even so such affections do kill men. For in
this world he has no soundness nor rest in his conscience, but is
continually tormented, albeit that he labor to purge mela^cholie, the which is
also a death: and afterward he goes unto damnation and eternal death, except
that (with the brethren of Joseph) he come to confess his malice, and to be
displeased therewith.

31 He that oppresses the poor, reproves him that made him but he
honors him that has mercy on the poor.
Although we be very wicked, and that there be many which of set purpose are
given to do things which they know to serve to the dishonor of God: yet
there is none that will be counted wicked, and also there is none but will be
very sorry to be called or esteemed a contemner of God. And therefore, to
avoid this reputation, and that none should think we would dishonor God,
the worldlings and carnal men, yea the most wicked will labor to show
themselves very zealous of the honor of God, in doing some things which shall
have an outward appearance of holiness and religion: as Caine, Core, Dathan
and Abiram, and Saul. Othersome, Number. 16. 18 1. Sam. 15. 15 Act. 8. 18.
to color their wickedness, and the dishonor they do unto God, will desire
to have some honest vocation, and will labor therein, speaking of God and of his
works: as Judas and Simon Magus: but therein they avoid not the dishonor of
God, as it appears when God declared that he allows not such kind of
services. As by these things done, with an evil conscience, we honor not God:
eue^ so also his dishonor stands not in the omission Psalm. 50. 8 Esaias. 1. 11.
and. 29. 13. and. 58. 11. Mat. 7. 21.
of them: but it stands in this, when we forsake and do contrary to that
which he chiefly commands, and without the which nothing can please him. It
is true that the principal honor we can give to God, and that he asks of us
before al things, is declared unto us in the first table of Moses: but we
cannot give unto him that he requires, except we render unto our neighbors
that which we owe them, without doing them wrong, and chiefly the poor. So
that God does disalowe all the honor that men can do him, and does hold it
for dishonor, if we do wrong unto our neighbor, and above al, unto the
needy. Solomon does briefly touch it, when he says,

He that oppresses the poor, etc. We do wrong unto a man, when we give him
not that we owe him, or when we take from him that which he possesses justly,
and without the which he nor his family can be maintained in this life. And
this wrong is done most commonly unto them which are poor, and have no
abundance of wealth, forasmuch as they have no power to defend themselves, and
that no service nor pleasureis looked for at their hands. This comes also
because of their weakness, why God abhors those which do them wrong, and
counts it dishonor done by them: not that it is laweful to do wrong unto
the richer sort, nor to pull away from the^ that which they possess, though
they be wicked, and have nothing sanctified to their use. Now although we
ought to do no wrong unto such kind of people, yet have they no need to be
commended: for they will not willingly suffer to be wronged: and as they well
think, they are strong enough to defend themselves: and do rather pull away
the goods of others, then to suffer loss or hinderance. Likewise God has no
care to commend them, but he commends unto us the needy, pronouncing that
the wrong that is done them, turns to his dishonor, and that the evil and
injury that is done unto the poor, is done unto himself: so that when a
poor man is wronged, we do not injury to a man only, that has no power, but
we stand up against almighty God, who knows well how to revenge the wrong
that is done unto him. Solomon does note this power, when by signifiyng God,
he says, reproves him, that made him: yea, who is as well a man as the most
excellent. And if God has made man, who is the most excellent creature of the
world, it follows well he is of power to make al other things, and to defend
and deliver the needy from him that does him wrong. Nevertheless by this
word, Has made him, Solomon does not chiefly and only pretend to mark
the power of God, but rather would signify that a man, though he be poor and
needy, yet ceasseth he not to be the work and creation of God, as well, or
better than the richest: and forasmuch as he is his work, that he will take
care of him, and not forsake him. And so this word Has made him, ought to be
a great comfort to the needy, and to assure them Heb. 13. 5. ^.
of the fatherly care of God toward them, as they are admonished. On the
otherside it ought to fear and terrify the unmerciful and cruel: for they are
admonished, that in doing wrong to the needy, they do not despise the work
of a man, but so much as lies in them, they destroy what God has made.
Wherein they take a work in hand, which they cannot bring to an end, and the
wrong that they invent for their neighbor, shall fall upon themselves. The
number of them which do wrong unto the needy is very great, as we may see.
The wordle is full of such. Whereupon it follows, that God is greatly
dishonored, although all the world would be esteemed that they reverence, and
fear God. Now Solomon desiring that we should not be of that number which
do dishonor Psa. 7. 16. 17 Luke 16. 23
God, does teach us how we should behave ourselves toward our needy
neighbors, for to honor God: when he says,

But he honors him that has mercy on the poor. If we will then do
acceptable honor unto God, we must have mercy upon the poor, and understand
that Solomon setting mercy against wrong, does show us, that whosoever has
not mercy upon the poor, does wrong unto him, though he neither curse nor
strike him, nor take ought of his from him. It is to do him double wrong, when
he will not give him that which he owes him: the which he does, when he has
power and ability for to help his needinesse, and cares not to help him. He
does him great wrong: for in this case he hates his brother, and is a
murderer of him. Let us not 1. John. 3. 15.
then love in word nor in tongue: but indeed and truth, and we shall do
honor unto God, which shall very much please him. I will have mercy and not
sacrifice: and our Lord Jesus Christ does show Mat. 12. 7.
it when he says, Come ye blessed children of my Father, etc. For I was an
hungry, and ye fed me, etc. And the Apostle says, To do good and to
distribute, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is Mat. 25. 34. Heb. 13.
16.
pleased.

32 The wicked shall be cast away for his malice: but the righteous has hope
in his death.
Many are given to do evil, and bear envy unto the senseless, seeing the
prosperity of the wicked. It seems unto man's wit and carnal reason, that
such prosperity ought to continue, and that the wicked shall always florishe:
for the worldlings and carnal men have Psalm. 73. 3
no further regard then to that which they outwardly feel, and see before
their eyes: but the Spirit of God does teach us far otherwise by Solomon
when he says,

The wicked shall be cast away for his malice. The which Solomon does here
express briefly, and in another place does declare at large. There is nothing
said there, but the wicked has already felt it and we confess it, if we will
open our eyes as we ought Leui. 26. Deu. 28. Psalm. 37.
for to behold the judgments that God has executed upon the wicked, as
upon Cayn, upon the world destroyed by the universal flood, upon Sodom and
Gomorrhe, and other wicked men. By so many examples as have happened, and do
daily come too pass, we may know that God casts away the wicked for their
malice, and makes them to fall and perish in affliction and misery: were it
not that we esteem not to regard the providence of God, and to have patience
til he has in time fulfilled his counsel: but we attribute almost al unto
fortune. We may give unto this first part two other senses: whereof the one is,
that the wicked shall be cast away in his misery: that is to say, he shall not
stand when adversity shall assault him, but shall be so beaten down, that he shall
fall and perish. The other sense is, that the wicked shall be cast away in his
evil: that is to say, that the evil that he thinks to do unto his
neighbor, Psalm. 7. 16.
shall fall upon himself by the just vengeance of God. These three senses are
diverse, and not contrary: For truth does not withstand truth, seeing
there is but one truth: the which notwithstanding is declared after diverse
sorts. Now these three senses are all true, as the Scriptures does prove,
and also as the wicked have felt and tried it. And with this that these three
senses conteyn truth, they agree also with the Antithesis. For when Solomon
says, but the rightoous has hope in his death: he shows that the righteous
shall be sure and stable, and that he shall be preserned that no evil shall happen
to destroy him. His body may be put to death: but it shall not be to cast him
away for his malice, for the faith he has in God, the which works by love,
is imputed unto him for righteousness, and no malice is attributed unto him,
but all his iniquities are blotted out, never more for to be remembered before
God. His body shall suffer much affliction and calamities, by the which he might
faint, but because he hops in God, the which confounds not, he shall obtain
according thereunto, and shall not be cast away in his afflictions, but the Lord
will receive him to himself, and deliver him. His body shall be subject to
receive much evil, even to be slain, but seeing that his conseience does not
reprove him to have invented Psalm. 34. 20.
evil against his neighbor, he fears not by dying to be cast away from God,
for to be recompensed him: but shall stand sure in this hope, that by his death
he shall obtein the reward of the righteous, which is everlasting life. Herein
does Solomon give us a sufficient proof for to make every one of us to
consider whether we shall be cast away, or whether we have hope. For since it is
the righteous that has hope, it does well follow that they which are given
unto wickednesses cannot hope, but do look to be cast away, and too receive a
worthy reward of their malice. Contrarily, since that righteousness is set
against malice or evil, it follows that the righteous, who is contrary unto
al evil, and does abhor it, hops not to be cast away. For albeit that his
righteousness is not worthy of that which he hops for, yet he knows, and
is assured that God is true in his promises, according to the which he cannot
perish. And therefore what grievous afflictions soever he suffer, and albeit
he have motions, and sightes which are hard and sharp for him to bear, yet
does he not vex himself, for to distrust the mercy of God. On the other
side, forasmuch as we cannot have this hope, but by the word of God, which is
refused almost of al, it follows that the number of the righteous is very
rare, and that very few have hope. True it is, that so long as afflictions shall
not press us, we make ourselves believe to be of ioly courage: but when we
be touched to the quick, or think thereof, then we faint. Further more let
us note, though that by the corruption of our nature, the malice of us al is so
great, that we deserve to be cast away: yet God is so mer^iful, that he
imputes our hope unto righteousness, and does not suffer us to perish. Wherein
we may know that it is very necessary for us, continually to meditate the word
of our Lord, and to labor to conform our lives therereafter.

33 Wisdom rests in the heart of him that has understanding, and is known
in the mids of fools.
There is none but does naturally esteem himself to be wise, and also there
is none that would endure to be counted a fool: and yet almost al do despise
knowledge and understanding and chiefly divinity, the which is the most
necessary: and that there are but a very few, but will be troubled, when a man
speaks to the^ thereof. Some of the^ would think themselves hypocrites and
superstitious, if they gave themselves thereunto: some think themselves too
young for to set their hearts therevppon, and think it is nothing but
Melancholy, the which agrees not with young folks: but that it belongs unto
those which are old to be given to learning and understanding. And when they
are waxen old, it is great pain and trouble for them to leave their wonted
trade. And thus always they refuse knowledge and understanding: and yet they
cease not to attribute to themselves wisdom, though they be altogether void
thereof: as Solomon does well signify, when he says, Wisdom rests in the
heart of him that has understanding, etc. Therefore of what age soever we be,
we must, (if we will get wisdom) be prudent: and for to be such, let us not
reject knowledge and understanding, as do the foolish, which nothing esteem
the pure word of God, which is the prudence and intelligence of the faithful
which love wisdom, and are careful to seek and enjoy her. And when he
says, that wisdom rests, let us not think that she is idle and of no
power: but let us understand, that if we be prudent, we are so seized of
wisdom, and do so carefully possess her, that we can not suffer to be
deprived thereof. And notwithstanding she is not unprofitable, and they which
possess her, do not disdain to open her, and to send her forth, that she
may do her office, and may gain that whereabout she is appointed. Also the
prudent do cause their wisdom to shine even amongst fools, and if it lay in
them, the fools should be made wise and prudent: for from the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaks, and other members also do execute their office.
Solomon does signify it, saying,

And is known in the mids of fools. It is not to say that the fools do
receive her to bring her forth into light, and to imparte her unto their
neighbors: for if they should use her so, they should not be fools, but wise:
but it is to say, that the prudent man walking amongst fools (whereof the
world is full) does not frame himself after their manners, nor follows their
trade: as they which say, we must bark with the dog, and houle with the
wolf: and disguise ourselves after al fashions for to apply us to them with
whom we chance to meet, but he shows himself wise and prudent in his
deeds and words: so that they which have sound judgment, do easily know
him from amongst other. Al true faithful Christians ought to bend theretoo:
Brethren, be not children in understanding, 1. Cor. 14. 20 Ephe. 5. 15. Col.
4. 5. Ephe. 4. 11. and 14.
but in malice be as children. Again, Take heed therefore that ye walk
circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Again, Walk wisely toward them that
are without, and redeem the season. This is the cause also why the Gospel is
preached. And he therefore gave some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and
some Evangelists, and some Pastors, and teachers. That we henceforth be no
more children, wavering and carried about with every wind of doctrine, etc. But
the Pastors of the Church should chiefly make their wisdom to be known in
the mids amongst fools. For to them does Jesus Christ say, Ye are the salt of
the earth, etc. And S. Paul demands Mat. 5. 13. 2. Timo. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 6. 17.
of them great prudence. The Nicodemites cannot boast that they are prudent,
nor that wisdom rests in their hearts. For seeing that the good man out of
the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, therefore shall their
wisdom Mat. 12. 35. John. 19. 39.
be known in the mids of fools. As Nicodemus gave it openly to be known in
the mids of the mad and raging Jews. And forasmuch as it is not lawful for
us to dwell amongst fools, to consent with them, but ought to withstand and
reprove them, correcting and threatening the^: otherwise we should be partakers
with the^ of their folly, and be like unto the^: it follows that they which
feign not to se^ their insolences, cannot challenge wisdom. Likewise albeeit
that wisdom must be known in the mids of fools, both by works, and
doctrine, yet must we diligently take heed from doing our works to be
seen of men: but we must labor only to make our tallentes (that the Lord
has committed unto us) to profit and increase.

34 Justice exalts a nation, but sin is ashame to the people.
The peoples and nations of the earth desire to be praised and honored, to
be famous, and renoumed, for the which they are feared and reverenced: they
desire to have great titles. And for to obtain this, they enlarge their
limits, and increase their lordships, in joining town to town, country to
country: they build sumptuouse palaces and castles which they labor to make
impregnable and inaccessible, and care not though in their doings they wring
their neighbors and take not heed whither they do things pleasing or
displeasing God. It is enough for them to obtain their desires, and to finish
their enterprises. They think by such kind of doings to be magnified and
exalted, but they are much deceived: seeing 1. Pet. 5. 5. Luke. 1. 51. Gene. 6.
and 7. and 11. 4. Gene. 6. and 7 and 11. 4.
they have not only to do with mortal, transitory and frail men, as they
are, but with the eternal and almighty God, who can tell how to mock their
enterprises, and to frustrate their desires. For he resists the proud: as
says the virgin Mary, he has showed strength with his arm, he has
scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. The very giants hade
felt it: for though they were mighty, and always famous, yet could they not
avoid the general flood. Noes childrens children labored to get fame and to
fortify themselves, but God scattered them over all the earth through the
confusion of tongues which he sent amongst them. The Canaanites thought
themselves highly exalted, when they were multiplied, and their cities strongly
furnished and fenced with all riches: but at the coming of the people of
Israel, GOD knew well how to beat them down and destroy them. A man might
here allege the Assirians and Babylonians, and almost all the nations of the
earth, and in them to behold how men do not rightly proceed to be exalted,
if we follow their manners.

For as we read in the scripture, God has utterly humbled and abaced them.
Therefore if we will be exalted, let us not desire to be like unto these
nations: but let us learn at Gods mouth what government we must follow. If
thou do obey the voice of the Lord thy God, he will ordeine thee head over all the nations of the earth. According Deuteronomy. 28. 1.
too this same, Solomon says, Justice exalts a nation. We will here take
justice, for the obedience of Gods voice, the which is imputed unto us, when we
believe and repent: whereby we lead a pleasing and an acceptable life unto God.
For by faith we renounce all vain confidence, which is detestable before God,
and clean unto him only, according as he demands in the Scripture. By
repentance we abhor the evil that God forbids, and love the good that he
commands. Thus doing, we shall honor and glorify him, and he will also exalt
us according to his promises. And since we are exalted by faith and repentance,
the which are taught us by the word, it follows that we have no righteousness
but thereby, and so thereby we are exalted. But this exaltatio^ is not seen of
the^ that behold it with a carnal eye, and require nothing but external pomp.
Also they believe not that by the word we may be exalted, but rather
suppressed and beaten down. And therefore they reject this word, and do
persecute them which receive it, and bear it, as though they were sworn
enemies to kingdoms and principalities for to destroy and bring them to
naught. We must not wonder hereat: for the exaltation which proceeds of
righteousness, is not known but only of them which are spiritual: for it is
spiritual, chiefly touching the temporal, it appears so little in outward
sight that they make no account thereof, but only that they be easily
contented. For God procedeeh not (according to our estimation, neither after
the manner, nor affection of men) to exalt nations by justice. We may know by
this that they which follow justice are most commonly scorned, despised and
reviled in the world: but yet they cease not to be exalted before God, who
does honor and glorify them before men, after as he knows to be expedient
for them. Now such nations as are truly given unto righteousness, are
contented with such kind of temporal exaltation as it pleases GOD too give
them, and are not s^ayde thereat, but have their hearts and minde^ fixed upon
the eternal exaltation, the which was prepared in heaven before the foundation
of the world was laid, and the which they meditate and behold by faith and
hope. Now that justice ought in this place to be taken for the obedience to
the voice of God, Solomon does show, when against justice, he sets sin,
saying, But sin is a shame to the people. For there had been no sin in the
world, if Adam had not disobeyed the voice of God: Gene. 3. 11. Romans 5. 19.
This is seen by the reproach that God made him: and Saint Paul does plainly
pronounce it: For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
that obedience of that one, shall many also be made righteous. Therefore as God
by obedience exalts nations, even so likewise, by obedience he brings
nations to shame: as he threatened the Jews therewith. And because that they
feared not the threatenings, but hardened themselves so much Leui. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
the more, in persecuting the Prophets, Jesus Christ our Lord, and his
Apostles: for this cause God has so put them back and cast them of, that they
have justly proved and do feel, that sin is the shame of nations:
nevertheless, they neither would nor will yet understand. The faithful
Christians amongst them have well felt it: as we may know by their complaints
and confessions. But now thou art far of, and put us to confusion, etc.
Again, Thou make Psa. 44. 10. 14. and. 7. 4. Psa. 51. 4. Da^. 9. 5. I^r. 20.
11.
us to be rebuked of our neighbors, etc. Again, Against thee only have I
sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightes^ be justified in thy
saying, etc. We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
wickedly, etc. They which never knew, nor yet will know, shall fall into
everlasting shame. They which persecute me, shall fall, their shame shall be
eternal, etc.

35 The pleasure of a king is in a wise servant: but his wrath shall be toward
him that is lewd.
Although it is a true and sure thing, that God who is our high King, does
delight in that man which can govern himself with such wisdom and prudence
as is requisite for his vocation, and that he which does contrary thereto, does
displease him, as the scripture does witness both by promises and threatenings,
and also by examples* Blessed is the people, (O Lord) that can rejoice in thee:
they shall walk in the light of thy countenance. The Lords delight is in Psa.
89. 16. and. 147. 11. and. 2. 4. 9.
them that fear him: he that dwells in heaven, shall laugh them to scorn,
the Lord shall have them in derision. Again, Thou shall bruise them with a rod
of iron. He has justly showed his wrath against Caine: against the world
destroyed by the flood, and by other infinite Psalm. 32. 9.
examples which ought to move us to follow this exhortation, I will inform
thee, and teach thee in the way wherein thou shall go: and I will guide thee with
mine eye. And least the rich and great men do think that this doctrine does
nothing perteine to them, let them give ear. Be wise now therefore, ye
Kings: be learned, ye Judges of the earth. Serve the Lord in fear, and
rejoice in trembling. Albeit (I say) that it is a thing true and sure, that God
delights in a man of understanding: yet we will take this sentence for an
Psalm. 2. 10. 11.
instruction that Solomon gives unto the Kings of the earth, and to their
servants and officers. Wherein, first he shows that the affection of Kings and
Lords of the earth, ought not to be set upon vanity and folly (upon pleasures
and pastimes, upon superfluities and pomps, upon filthiness and covetousness, and
other worldly and carnal things: as do almost al Princes and earthly Lords,
who think that al things are made for their pastime, and that they ought to
do nothing else but to live in pleasure and voluptuousnes, and to do al
things after their sensual appetite, so drunken are they in their carnal
sense:) but their hearts and minds ought to be given unto the law of the
Lord. For if they be not wise nor learned, they can not delight in wise
servants and learned officers: as Solomon has warned them Deuteronomy. 17. 1^. 19.
here, saying, The pleasure of a King is in a wise servant: and does show
them that they ought to take example of David. Secondly, he shows that a King
ought not himself alone to govern Psalm. 101. 2*
and guide the people committed unto him, but ought to have servants which may
serve and help him to set order in the policy after the counsel of Iethro:
and as did Iosaphat. Thirdly, that Kings and Princes ought not to govern after
their fantasy, but according Exo. 1^. ^^ 2. Cor. 1^. ^. 6. 7.
to the counsel of their learned and wise servants. And then they shall show
that they delight in them, and esteem and honor them. Contrarily, if they
have none other law but their will, and will not yield unto the counsel of wise
and learned servants, they do plainly show that they do not delight in
wise servants. Now if kings must follow the counsel of such as are learned
and wise in the civil government, by a greater reason they ought very
diligently to believe the true and faithful Pastors of the Church, which bear
the word of the Lord: and to attempt nothing in the Ecclesiastical policy
without the advice and counsel of those which Deuteronomy. 17. 18
are appointed to feed the flock of the Lord. This is well showed them, when
it is said, that the king shall write out this law into a book for himself,
by the Priests of the Levites. For the Priests lips should preserve
knowledge, as they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger
of the Lord of hosts. Fourthly, that offices and administrations of kingdoms,
principalities and Lordeships Mala. 2. 7.
ought to be committed unto wise and learned men, and not unto such as are
ignorant. Behold this is it which is showed to us by the first part of this
present sentence, upon the which let us note that delight is here taken for a
loving and favorable affection: and a wise servant, for him which can so well
govern in the administration committed unto him, that his Lord reioyseth
thereat and praises it, and is not ashamed to commend the same. Solomon does
so teach it us, when against delight, he sets wrath, and against a wise
servant, him that is lewd, saying, But his wrath shall be toward him that is
lewd. Let us note, since that the lewd servant, or that he works confusion,
is set against a wise or learned servant, we must understand that he is a lewd
servant which is void of a right affection, of sound judgment, and despises
wisdom and understanding, and cares not too labor in the charge and
administration committed unto him, except he labor to set all in disorder and
confusion, and yet notwithstanding would be counted a good and faithful
servant. The kingdoms principalities, dominations and Lordships, have but too
many such servants, as experience techeth. But we must not marvel thereat: for
if the kings, Princes, and Lords of the earth do disobey, rebel and be
unfaithful unto their Sovereign Lord and king, they do well deserve to have
such servants officers and stewards, or rather scatterers and destroiers: and
also such men are commonly best welco^e and received into the courts and
houses of great men, because they can bear good face, go brave and gay,
flatter and slander. Wherein we may well know that such administrations, are
disordered and have ill success: for they which are the best welcome and
received, ought too be rejected, driven away and rooted out, if the Lords did
their duty. Solomon does well show it us, when he says here, that the
lewd servant shall be under the wrath of the king. For when he speaks hereof
wrath, let us not only imagine some evil use and custom some crooked look,
or some blunt speech or sharp threatninges: But as the king ought to maynteine
a wise servant, in doing him good, and preserving him from evil, so much as
possibly he can, Psa. 101. 8. Romans 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14. Psa. 101. 11.
(otherwise he should not delight in him,) eue^ so the office of a king
requires such anger against a lewd servant, that he should make him to
feel it in punishing him, as the confusion and lewdnes that he has done
deserves, according to the Scripture. I shall soon destroy all the ungodly
that are in the land: that I may root our al wicked doers from the city of
the Lord.

The fifteenth Chapter.
1 A soft answer puts away wrath: but greeuo^^ words stir up anger.
A Although we be inclined and ready to do evil unto our neighbors, (as
Caine has well showed it unto his brother Abel, and the children of Jacob
unto their brother Joseph) and Gene. 4. 8. and. 37. 4. 20.
that many do nothing care though their neighbors are provoked against the^,
so arrogant and lofty they are, and presume upon their authority: nevertheless,
after we have offended them, or that we understand that they hold themselves
offended with us, if we feel or think us to be more weak, we fear their
wrath, and desire to avoid it, and would be very glad to be assured that they
bear us no grudge, and desire no reuengment against us. Now what force and
power, or credit and authority soever we have above our neighbors if we have
offended them, we must think we are the weakest. For in offending our
neghbours, we do not only set ourselves against men, but against almighty
God, who can tell how to take the quarrel of those in hand, that are unjustly
oppressed, and can soon take vengeance in his wrath and fury, without any
resistance. Cain did justly feel it: so did they which vexed the holy ancient
fathers, and which rose up against the people of God: as it may be seen in the
holy histories: and in beholding the promises and threatenings contained in
the books of Moses. Albeit the^ that after the feeling of the flesh and
outward appearance, we seem unto Gene. 12. 2. 3. and. 15. 1. 14. Deuteronomy. 32. 35.
Zach. 2. 5. 9.
ourselves to be the more mighty, yet when we have offended our neighbors,
how weak soever they be, let us esteem ourselves the weakest, and fear the
wrath that is kindeled against us, because of the offense that we have
committed, and let us endeavor to avoid it in quieting our neighbors
offended. And to come to this, let us follow the way that Solomon does teach us,
when he says, A soft answer puts away wrath, etc. By a soft answer, let
us understand, and humble confessing of the faltes and offenses which have bin
committed, with requests and prayers to obtain pardon of God, and
reconciliation with them that have bin offended: and chiefly when we are
exhorted and required. And not only the same, but also, let us understand
every soft and gentle word, whereby we labor to quiet those which are angry,
whether it be wrong or right, and to obtein their favor. Jacob knew well that
such words were fit for to turn away wrath: and therefore he uses them toward
his brother Esau. Gene. 32. 4. 5. and 33. 5 and 27. 41. 1. Sam. 24. 9. and. 26.
18. Math. 5. 23.
He had not offended Esau, but he knew well that Esau had threatened to kill
him. And David for to turn away the wrath of Saul, who did wrongfully
persecute him, uses also a soft answer. Likewise our Lord Jesus Christ does
well teach us, If thou will offer thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest
that thy brother has ought against thee, leave there thine offering before the
Altar and go thy way: first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
offer thy gift. Again, Love your enemies, etc. Speak well of them which
persecute you, etc. not rendering evil for evil, etc. And if we must use a soft
answer toward them which do us wrong, by a stronger reason toward God and
our neighbors, whom we have offended. The brethren of Math. 5. 23. 24. 44.
Romans 12. 44.
Joseph did well understand this, as they showed it: and Abigaile: David also
did prove, that a soft answer puts away wrath, As he confesses, I have
sinned against the Lord, etc. We may see here how we must use a soft
answer, for to turn away the 2. Sam. 12. 13. and. 24. 10 ^sa. 32. 5.
wrath, chiefly of God. (For cursed is the favor which men bears unto us,
except we have peace with God: the which for to obtain, let us take heed we
use not soft answer under dissimulation and hypocrisy: as they which say,
Lord, Lord, and labor not to do his will). Secondly, of men: following the
counsel of S. Paul, If it be Math. 7. 21. Luke. 6. 46. Romans 12. 18. Math. 26.
49
possible, so much as in you lies, have peace with all men. And in our soft
answer let us take heed of treason: as Judas Iscarioth, which saluted Jesus
Christ, kissing and calling him master, and yet betrayed him into the hands
of his enemies. To whom al such are like which boast themselves to be
reformed after the Gospel, and yet would have the same abolished. And
forasmuch as an answer or soft word does put away wrath, and quieteth it, it
follows well, that if we fear, as we ought, of provoking of God, or our
neighbors unto wrath and anger, that we ought to be given truly unto such a
kind of answer, and to abstain from al rude, sharp, arrogant, and grievous
words: As does Solomon teach us, saying, But grievous words stir up anger.
This same is so plain, that it needs no declaration, and is so often
proved, that it has no need of probation, as touching between man and man:
and also it is a natural thing belonging to man, to be provoked to anger when
things are not spoken unto his mind. Caine has well Gene. 4. 9
showed it by the answer he made unto God. The Sodomites took not the
instructions of Lot in good part, and therefore they waxed angry with him. The
sons of Jacob do not very willingly and. 19. 9. and. 37. 8.
hear the dreams of Joseph: for this cause they became angry, and conceived
hate against him. The answer of Nabal provoked David unto anger. Concerning
God, let us not doubt but 1. Sam. 25. 13 1. Cor. 10. 5. 1. Kin. 18. 40
that we provoke his anger, when our speech does not please him: as do all
liars, and as many as speak wickedly. The children of Israel have well tried it
after their murmuringes: as the holy histories do set it forth, and Saint
Paul also does testify it. The 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10.
false Apostles have felt it. Albeeit that God does not always declare his
anger against the evil mouthed, yet shall they not avoid it: for the
slaunderers, backbiters, periurers and blasphemers shall not inherit the
kingdom of heaven. Let us then take heed to speak well, to please God chiefly,
and also our neighbors which are easy and willing to be taught. For if the
stubborn, transgressors, dissolute and wicked, the hard hearted and obstinate
do become angry at us, when we speak not to their mind, let us not care for
it. If our speech which is according to Gods word, be grievous unto them, the
same comes not from us, but from their malice. If their anger arise, let us
not be afraid thereof, but let us follow our charge, as we are admonished in
Esai, the 58. Chapter: and Ier. 1. 7. and 2. Tim. 4. 2. and Titus, 1. 7. 8.

2 The tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools
babbleth out foolishness.
We al naturally do desire knowledge, and to understand how we ought to
govern and rule, that we may gain thereby, and avoid loss: and it greeueth
us to be ignorant, except we be children in wit, or blockishe and dull. We
do greatly praise them which are cunning to handle their matters well, and
which are careful and diligent to take heed that they have no hinderance nor
loss: and contrarily, we blame them which have no regard to their business,
and we esteem them negligent. Now if we be thus affectioned to worldly
things and temporal government, by a more strong reason, must we be earnest
to learn to guide and govern our souls, for to preserve them from danger,
not temporal (as are the worldlings, which know no other life, but this
temporal, very careful to do this:) but to avoid eternal destruction, and to
be always in felicity and joy. The knowledge which is necessary thereto, is
not found in all: for it is not common to al, but only to them which are
instructed and taught of God. David does so affirm it, The Lord Psa. 25. 8.
Psa. 32. 8. Esaias. 2. 3. and 48. 17. and 54. 13. Iere. 31. 33. 34.
is good and just. And therefore he prays, Make me to know thy ways, O
Lord. Also the promises that GOD makes, do show that the true knowledge
comes from him. And yet notwithstanding, GOD who is our teacher, dwells in
the light that none can attain unto. For this cause he orders the
Instruments and Organes, by the which he will teach us, and of whom we
must learn knowledge. Solomon does signify it, when he says, The tongue of
the wise uses knowledge aright, etc. If the^ we will learn knowledge, and
learn how we must guide and govern our souls for to preserve them from
destruction, we must ask of God that he would raise up for us wise men, not
worldly and carnal, but such as was Noe, Abraham, Moses, the Prophets and
Apostles: and that he would frame and order their tongue, in such wise that
they may pronounce, as they ought, the pure word, which is the sound and
healthful knowledge, without the which al other sciences and knowledges are but
darkness and ignorance, and the way of destruction damnation. And we must pray
and him that he would draw us near unto the^, and to hear them with all the
desire of our heart, and that by such means he would accomplish in us his
promise. If we cleave unto other, seeing they are unlike, even mere contrary,
to wit, fools, Eze. 36. 27.
we shall learn nothing but folly. For the mouth of fools bableth out
foolishness. Now when folly is set against knowledge, which is very
profitable, as we have heard: it follows rightly that from the mouth of
fools, we ca^ receive nothing but hurt, the which we cannot avoid, except we
be very discrete for to preserve ourselves. For on what side soever we turn
us, we meet with fools, who because of the great multitude where with the
world is full, and because also of their great glistering, and fair show of
holiness and wisdom, and of their credit and authority do draw us unto
them, and do bewitch us with their folly, and do lead us unto destruction
with the^, except we be very quick to discern between knowledge and
foolishnes. We have tried it being under the yoke of Antichrist of Rome.
Wherefore when the Lord gives wisdom, we must come to hear it, beseeching him
to make us too understand the way of his Pro. 2. 6. Psa. 119. 27. 33.
commandementes. Again, Lord teach me the way of thy statutes. And albeit
that Solomon here makes no mention but of the tongue and of the mouth: yet he
excludes not the other members. For as we have heard, a discrete man works
by knowledge, but a fool opens folly. There he speaks rather of the
tongue then of other members: for it is the same that expresses best what is
in Pro. 13. 16.
the hearre of man, and is more easily and lightly imparted unto a great
multitude then by the other members. The tongue is of so great excellency,
that the Scripture calls glory, and S. James Psalm. 16. 9. Ia. 3. 5. 6. 13.
says, that the tongue woorketh great things, though it be but a little
member. But if it be given to goodness, it comes not of it self: for the
tongue is a fire, even a world of wickedness. Therefore it requires to be
guided and ruled by some other thing then it self, that is to say, by
wisdom. S. James does signify it, when he asks, Whosoever is wise and
discreet amongst you? let him show by good conversation of his works in
meekness of wisdom.

Solomon also says not simply, The tongue uses knowledge aright: but the
tongue of the wise: In them is knowledge, and with them it is found. Therefore
no man will attribute knowledge, Pro. 10. 13. 14.
nor the use thereof to himself, unless he be wise, not before men, but
before God, which gives him witness by his Spirit. Let us note further, that
if knowledge be not so much used as it ought to be, that it is for want of
wisdom. But foolishness abounds, because that the number of fools (as
has been said) is so great, and can not suffer that the tongue of the wise
should use knowledge rightly. In Turkey no man will suffer Jesus Christ to be
preached, that he might be known to be our Savior with God his Father: as it
is necessary thereby to obtain life. In Popery, some mention John. 17. 3.
shall be made of Jesus Christ, and yet no man will hear Saint Paul which has
rightly used knowledge, and has said, I esteemed not 1. Cor. 2. 2.
to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. But they
prefer an heap of trifles before Jesus Christ, who of God is made unto us
wisdom. As touching the countries where the Gospel is purely preached, yet are
they not clean purged of 2. Cor. 1. 30.
fools. For we shall find many which cannot abide us to reprehend, to confute,
to threaten them which live slanderously and dissolutely: and yet we must not
so do, if we will rightly preach the Gospel, wherein is contained repentance,
unto the which, for to exhort and bring the people, it is necessary to cry
out against vice and sin, and to terrify the consciences of those which are
given to live wickedly. For to use knowledge rightly, we must preach one only
Jesus Christ, and repentance, and remission of sins in his name. Luke. 34. 17.


3 The eyes of the Lord in every place, behold the evil and the good.
If we have in admiration, and give reverence to Kings and Princes of the
earth, esteeming them wise and prudent, when they are very careful and
watchful to take heed to their subjects, for to know how every man does
govern himself, that so much as they can, they may set al things in good
order in their countries and dominions (seeing that all the Empires, Kingdoms,
and Princedomes of the world are nothing, in comparison of the sovereign
Lordship of our eternal God:) we must needs be ravished into a great
wonderment, and wonderful astonishment, for to confess the inestimable and
incomprehensible wisdom of God, the which ouerseeth not one or two Kingdoms,
nor by mediators and intercessours (as Emperors and earthly Kings, how little
soever the length of their Kingdom is, have not the power to look over all
and every where, but have need to ordeine noble men here and there to have
the oversight, the guiding and government of towns and villages, and that in
their name and authority, they may set order amongst the people) but he
himself ouerseeth al countries of the world, and every particular person
therein: and for to order things aright therein, he looks not only unto that
which is done outwardly, as do the gouernorus of the earth: but he perceth
even unto the heart and thoughts, and co^sidereth and sees all the cogitatio^s,
thoughts, purposes, affections and desires how deep soever they be. Solomon
does express this same unto us in few words, when he says, The eyes of the
Lord, etc. The holy scripture attributes sight and face unto god. Now we
cannot comprehend the sight and the face of God without eyes: and therefore
the scripture applying it self unto our capacity, Gene. 1. 10. and. 32. 30.
Exo. 3. 4. 7. and. 33. 11. Psa. 14. 2. Gene. 6. 8. and. 18. 3. Psalm. 11. 4. 7
and 66. 7. Job. 10. 4. Psalm. 139. 7
does attribute eyes unto God. And yet he is a spirit, and has no eyes. Do
thou see as man sees? But the scripture yielding to our dulnes, speaks of
God by similitudes, and does attribute unto him that which is corporal, that
we may the more easily comprehend that which he declares unto us. Therefore
when we see that the eyes of the Lord are in all places, let us take heed to
imagine any thing carnal in him, but let us understand, that the providence of
God is of such length and breadth, that he looks not only to one part of
the world, but has care of al, and nothing is hid from him: There is no deep
so profounde, but he pearceth it: for he has made al, and rules all, and
nothing stands nor abides but by his will and ordinance. And therefore David
by great admiration says, Whither shall I fly from thy Spirit? But that
which he most regards in this world, is man, for whom he has created al
things: and albeit he does provide for the beasts, yet his chief care is for
men. Also the Scripture makes often Math. 6. 25. 1. Cor. 9. 9. 10
mention of the sight of God over men. Likewise Solomon does signify here unto
us after a sort that the eyes of the Lord are chiefly over me^. For albeit he
says that the eyes of the Lord are in all places, and that he knew well that the
world was not void of beasts, yet he says not that the eyes of the Lord are
over the beasts, but beholding Psalm. 11. 4. 7.
the evil and the good. Albeit that of our vicious and corrupted nature we are
al evil, yet, because that God of his grace has elected some before the
foundation of the world was laid, that we should and. 33. 13. 14. Gene. 6. 5.
and 8. 21. Psalm. 14. 3. Romans 3. 9. Ephe. 2. 3. and 1. 4.
be holy through love: therefore Solomon lets not to part men into twain:
that is to say, into evil and good. And it might seem that he names the evil
first, because that al men by their nature are such, and those which are left
in that nature are a far greater number the^ are those which are reformed by
the grace of god, and that we are first evil before we be good: and thus he
sets our own nature first before our eyes, that what goodness soever we
have, we should not yet boast, as though we had changed our own selves, and not
that it came by the only grace and mere mercy of our Lord God. I say
expressly it might seem, and not that it is so: for we must compel no man to
believe that Solomon has had this respect, in naming the evil before the good:
although that that which is said, contains true and profitable doctrine to
lead us unto humility and lowlines, as it is necessary for us. But to come
again to that which Solomon minds to teach us, let us note that he first
says, that God beholds the evil: by the which we must understand them which
delight to hurt and to do evil unto their neighbors, and do hate goodness.
These are they which are largely spoken of here before, and also in Jeremy.
Such are the wicked, who are here spoken of, Pro. 1. 7. 10. 24. 2. 11. Iere. 4.
22.
Solomon does show it when he deuideth them from the good, whose goodness is
never so perfect but that still some seed of evil remains, and that we should
need continually to ask forgeuenes of our sins but goodness is imputed unto
them, because they delight to do well, and that the evil which is in them,
displeases them. Contrarily, the evil have no delight but too do evil. And
therefore when it is said that God beholds the evil, let us know that it
is not for delighte that he has in them nor in their wickedness. For David
says, Thou art not a God which love wickedness: neither shall any evil dwell
with thee. The Lord allows the righteous: Psalm. 5. 5. and 11. 4. and. 34. 15.
but the ungodly and him that delights in wickedness does his soul abhor.
The face of the Lord is against them that do evil: to root out the
remembrance of them from the earth. But contrarily, he beholds the good
delighting in them, and preserving them from destruction. The eyes of the Lord
are over them which fear him, etc. The eyes of the Lord are over the
righteous: and his ears are open unto their prayers. Again, When the
righteous cry, the Lord hears them. But the Lords delight is in them that
fear him, and put their trust in his mercy. Moreover let us Psa. 33. 18. and.
34. 16. 17 18. and. 147. 11.
note, that the Lord does not see as man sees only outwardly, but he sees
and knows eue^ the very bottom of him. Let not the wicked the^ look to avoid
punishment: seeing they have to do with him who is righteous, and almighty.
And let the good, what evil soever they suffer, not fear to perish: seeing
that the almighty, who is merciful, cares for them. Finally, let us note that
it is impossible to make any image or likeness for to represent God,
forasmuch as his eyes are in all places.

4 A whole some tongue is as a tree of life: but the frowardness thereof is
the breaking of the mind.
Forasmuch as we al desire life, and chiefly that which lasts longest, and
if we be gentle and merciful unto our neighbors, we desire their health, and
are very glad to be the cause of the saving of their life, and we delight
therein: Forasmuch as it is so, I say, we must not be negligent of that which
is proper and meet thereunto, but diligent to seek it, and having obtained
it, to keep it, and to practice it as it shall be expedient. The worldlings
think that there needs nothing but abundance of temporal wealth for to live,
to be at our ease, to have our delights and pleasures of the flesh, to
avoid sorrow and Melancholy, and to be merry: and therefore with all their
desires and affections, they give themselves unto gathering and seeking all the
pastimes they can imagine: but the life consists not herein, as has been
handeled. The children of God must not stay at these worldly things and carnal
for to live, but must seek other means, amongst the which is an wholesome
tongue: as Solomon does teach us, saying, A wholesome tongue is as the tree
of life. There is health in the tongue, when the heart is not double, and is
not infected with lying, and deceit, and other wickednesses: but is indewed
with simplicity and uprightness, and is filled with truth and other virtues:
by the abundance whereof, the mouth speaks. Then the tongue which is
wholesome, is as a tree of life. For as the tree of life planted in the midst
of the garden of Eden, brought forth fruit, of the which if man had eaten,
he had lived for ever: even so a wholesome tongue brings forth 2. 9. Gene.
and. 3. 22.
the fruit of truth, the which quickens those which are partakers thereof.
For to be partakers thereof, we must draw near to the wise, not with our
bodies, but by consent and agreement. The tongue of the wise is health. The
instruction of the wise is as the spring of Pro. 12. 18. and. 13. 14.
life. We must thus draw near to them, and not to draw back: for by them
does Jesus communicate himself unto us, whom we must hear: in whom only
we must believe, and say to him with the Apostles, Lord, to whom shall we
go? Thou have the words of eternal life, of the which al they are partakers,
which in faith and obedience receive the Gospel by the mouth of those which
preach John. 6. 68.
it purely. By them does the tongue of the Lord sound forth, which has said,
He that hears you, hears me. Behold the chief health of the tongue: and also
the doctrine which proceeds thereof is called wholesome doctrine: and they
which receive it are sound in faith, by the which we obtain life. And
therefore, we must all learn of this tongue to frame ours, so doing we
shall be by our tongues, health, and a tree of life both to ourselves and to our
neighbors. Mat. 12. 37. Pro. 12. 6. 14 Pro. 4. 20. 21 22. 23. 24.
Thou shall be justified by thy words. Let us then draw near unto an
wholesome tongue, and let us hearken diligently thereunto: as we have been
admonished. If we work after this sort, it shall come to pass that as we
draw near truly unto the wise, even so shall we be endued with wisdom,
the which is the tree of life to them which lay hold upon it. But if we
despise to have an wholesome tongue, there is no life in us, neither for us,
nor for Pro. 3. 18.
our neighbors, but destruction. Solomon does show it, saying.

But the frowardness thereof is the breaking of the mind. Therefore when we
care not to speak well, and that we break forth into the wicked and dissolute
words, we loose our souls: Thou shall be condemned by thy words. The
foolish in talk shall be Mat. 12. 37. Pro. 10. 8. and. 12. 13. and 13. 17.
beaten. The mouth of the fool is a present destruction. The tongue of the
froward shall be cut out. The evil man is snared by the wickedness of his
lips. A wicked messenger falls into evil. Also we destroy as many as do
hear us, so much as in us lies: Evil words, corrupt good manners. Fair
words and sweet sayings, deceive 1. Cor. 15. 33 Romans 16. 18.
the hearts of the simple. We are here then taught to be attentive to hear
those which speak well and honestly: and also to accustom ourselves to use our
tongues as we ought. And because that the tongue should be guided after the
disposition of the heart, we have need to ask a clean heart, etc.
According to Gods promise, Psa. 15. 12. Eze. 36. 25. Psa. 51. 17.
I will power upon you clean water, and wash you clean, etc. In this sort the
Lord will open our lips, and our mouths shall show forth his praise.

5 A fool despises his fathers instruction: but he that regards correction,
is prudent.
We al naturally do judge that a child ought to receive the commandments of
his father, and to submit himself unto his correction and chastening:
otherwise he is counted a fool, and without discretion. And since that our
judgment is such, and that we would not be counted fools and without
discretion, let us hear our father who does teach us and exhort us to
receive his corrections. If we will do this same as we ought, we must neither
behold the earth, nor the world: but forasmuch as we have one only father in
heaven, we ought for to lift up our inward eyes thither: that is to say, our
hearts and minds, and to be diligent too hear Mat. 23. ^*
what it pleases him to command us, for to obey him, and patiently to bear
the corrections that he shall send us. Yet nevertheless we should not cease
to submit ourselves unto me^ which have superiority, and authority over us,
which have taken the charge to teach us, to guide and rule us, and have power
to chasten and correct us: otherwise we should be fools, as Solomon declares,
saying, A fool despises his fathers instruction. For all such worthy men are
our fathers, and for such ought we to esteem them: as also the Scripture does
attribute this name of father unto them, because it has pleased God to impart
his honor and his power, and authority unto them. If then we will not be
disobedient unto our father, and be counted fools, let us not refuse the
instruction of those fathers that God has appointed for us in this world: but
let us honor them, and yield unto them obedience after the degree wherein God
has placed them. Let children honor father and mother then. Let every man be
subject unto the higher powers: Give unto Exo. 20. 12. Ephe. 6. 1. Romans 13. 1.
1. Pet. 2. 13. Mat. 22. 21. Ephe. 6. 5. Collo. 3. 22. 1. Pet. 2. 18.
Caesar that which belongs unto Caesar. Let servants obey their Masters. Al
these are fathers for the body, to whom we must obey and suffer chastisements,
if we will avoid to be counted fools, and to bear the name of discrete,
prudent, and wise: as Solomon says here.

But he that regards correction, is prudent. Now if God will have men to
know our discretion and wisdom known by the obedience we give them, and by
the patience that we have to bear, and to suffer the corrections of such
fathers: by a more Heb. 12. 9.
strong reason we ought to submit us unto our heavenly father. For to obey him
rightly, we must hear and receive his word with all humbleness, fear and
reverence, the which is declared unto us by the Ministers and Pastors of the
Church, who do beget us thereby so much as in them lies, when they do
preach the same unto us faithfully. But because the world is full almost of an
infinite number of those which name themselves fathers, but they are cruel,
tyrants, murderers, and mankillers, not only of their bodies, but also of
their souls: as are the Pope and his mainteiners, Bishops, Priests, and
Monks: as are al Kings and Princes, which would have their subjects to do
homage unto that Antichrist of Rome, by the observation of their traditions and
doctrines of men, the which lead men to perdition: we ought not to be ready
to receive their instructions, nor obey their corrections, for then should we
be fools, and indiscreet: we should not have the discretion and wisdom that
our heavenly father demands of us, when he does admonish us by his son
Jesus Christ our Lord, Take heed and beware Math. 7. 15. Romans 16. 17. Gala. 3.
1.
of false Prophets. etc. And by Saint Paul: but as fools and indiscreet, we
should deserve to be reproved as were the the folishe Galathians. And albeit
that we must give honor and obedience unto Princes, though they were not
faithful unto God: yet if they command any thing which cannot be observed
without the dishonor Act. 4. 19. and 5. 29.
of God, we must in no wise obey them, but rather tell them, It is better to
obey God, than men.

6 The house of the righteous has much treasure: but in the revenues of the
wicked there is trouble.
There is no man that desires to be poor, neither would that his family
should want any thing: and they which are needy are very glad when they find
an house furnished, and that they hope to receive some help of that which they
need. Even so there is none but desires to have enough for to maintain
himself in this worldly and temporal life. But al men know not how to govern
themselves to come by it. The worldlings and carnal men say, That for to get
great riches, and come to wealth, we need but turn our back unto God. And
though they did not speak thus, yet will they not cease to have this opinion:
as we may know it, by the manner and custom they use to heap riches
together. Although they labor to make themselves believe, and also would have
other to believe, that they are honest men, and that they would do wrong to no
man: And indeed for a certain time, after the outward appearance they will
flourish and prosper, doing their things at pleasure. And for this cause the
children of God are tempted to follow them, that they also may live at ease.
And therefore, that such ways are wicked and detestable before God, and also
condemned in the consciences of the wicked (for they know well that they would
take it in evil part, and would not willingly bear it, if any man labored to
do them wrong that they do unto their neighbors) for this cause we are
admonished not to envy those which commit wickedness. By the course of the
Psalm, we may understand that the means Psalm. 73. 2. 3. Psa. 37.
to attain unto abundance of riches, is to follow righteousness, that is,
that in assuring ourselves of the goodness of God toward us, we might
faithfully follow our vocation, in doing no wrong unto our neighbors, but
yielding that which we owe them, according as the word of God does teach
us. So doing, we shall have our houses filled with plenty of goods and shall
quietly enjoy them, as God does promise in his law. Solomon in following of
the law, has promised such abundance. But for to assure us further, and to
lead us unto righteousness, he does now again set Leui. 26. Deuteronomy. 28. Pro. 3.
9. 10. 33. and. 11. 24. 25. and. 13. 21. 22. and. 14. 11.
the self same promise before us, when he says. The house of the righteous
has much treasure. This sentence ought well to lead us to follow
righteousness, without doubting whither Solomon says truth or no. For albeit
we see the righteous very often in outward sight and after man's judgment, to
suffer much poverty, and to be very miserable, nevertheless according to the
judgment of the spirit their houses have much treasure, because they have
enough and are contented, which is more worth, and are of greater profit then
all the riches of worldlinges and carnal men. Let us then understand that the
greatness of their substance does not stand in outward abundance, but in that
that they have wherewith too sustain them, and that they are ready to help
their neighbors with that which they have. And thus the needy ought to be glad
to come to the houses of the righteous: for after as they have need, they will
help their necessity. Albeit then that we have the rich men of the world in
admiration, and that we proclaim them honest men, yet (as we may know by their
kind of doings) they are not righteous, and what abundance of wealth soever
they have, yet have they not in their houses any great wealth, seeing that for
the greatest part of them they have never enough and do fear lest the world
should fayl them. If then we would have enough, contentation, and peace in our
houses let us study upon righteousness and delight therein. For without it
there is nothing but sorrow and trouble, doubtfulnes and unquietness, albeit
that we labor to be merry and joyful when we think we have yearly rentes
enough and abundant: Solomon does signify it saying, but in the revenues of
the wicked there is trouble. The wicked does not possess that which he has
with a sound conscience, for either he uses deceit or ravening, or he has
never enough, or he is vexed if his land does not profit and grow as he
would have it, or if he spend more largely then he would: and therefore he
stampeth and fretteth either in body or mind, or with both together, and has
no quienesse, but tormenteth himself, and chideth and brauleth often with his
household, or with his neighbors.

7 The lips of the wise do spread abroad knowledge: but the heart of the
foolish does not so.
We are so covetous of honor and glory, that it grieueth us at the heart to
be counted fools, though we be naturally such, and cannot of ourselves become
other. Contrarily, we are very glad when we think that we are counted wise,
or that we can make ourselves believe that we are so. And to maintain us in
such reputation we apply ourselves to do goodly things outwardly, and which
seem to be of great profit before the people, either for ourselves, or for
our neighbors. For seeing that men know not the thoughts of man, but as by
the effects which are showed outwardly, therefore we cannot be counted wise
of our neighbors, except that we set ourselves to do or speak some things,
the which they may esteem to proceed of wisdom after the sight of man and
judgment of the flesh. But commonly both we and they are deceived in our
estimation and judgment: as we may now know, if we thoroughly consider what we
were in thoughts, words, and works, when we were in that horrible darkness
of ignorance under the tyranny of the Pope. We thought then there was no
wisdom in the world but there. The holy Ghost does teach us by Solomon to
judge otherwise: to wit, that they which imparte knowledge so largely as they
can, and delight to make their neighbors partakers with them thereof, that it
may fructify, are wise, when he says, The lips of the wise, etc. We cannot
therefore boast ourselves to be wise, because we are not so, except we be
liberal of our knowledge, and do gladly imparte it according to the state
whereunto God has called us, and are not envious nor sorry to see our
neighbors to profit with us of our industry, pain and labor, and that they
get by our means some knowledge or any art for to know how to spend their
time in the service of God and of their neighbors, that they may not be
unprofitable. But GOD must allow our art and occupation: for there is no
knowledge, but that which God teaches us by his word, and that he allows
thereby. Except he become our teacher, and that he himself open the lips of
the wise for to spread abroad knowledge, the world must needs be filled with
ignorance: For the Lord gives wisdom, Pro. 2. 6.
out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. Even so although Solomon
does attribute the seed or spreading abroad of knowledge unto the lips, yet
is it not to say that knowledge cannot be imparted by no other means but by
the lips. True it is that the word of God, out of which we learn al
knowledge, is taught by the lips, and that there is no knowledge but only
that which God teaches, and that the chief and most necessary part of
knowledge is communicated by the lips of the Pastors and ministers of the
Church: but as they alone are not wise, even so also they teach not
themselves alone al knowledge. They which lead an holy and honest life
occupying themselves faithfully in their estate and vocation for to help their
neighbors at their need, do sow knowledge, though they should speak never a
word with their mouths. Their manners and fashion of doing, their studies and
exercises do speak and teach: and so they shead and spread abroad knowledge
according to the measure of the wisdom that God gives them by his word,
after the which we must order all, and must thereby guide al things. And to do
the same, the wise must speak: and it is for this cause why Solomon says that
the lips of the wise shall spread abroad knowledge. Heretofore he has well
showed us that knowledge may be opened and communicated otherwise then by the
lips: Every wise man will work by knowledge: Pro. 13. 16.
but the mouth, the tongue and the lips are the principal organes and
instruments for to set it forth, when they are moved of the heart thereunto,
which is the seal of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding. Solomon does
signify it, when he does not simply say, The lips shall spread abroad: but
he says, The lips of the wise shall spread abroad. He does signify it
again, when against the lips of the wise, he sets the heart of fools,
saying, But the heart of the foolish does not so. And it is as much as if he did
say, forasmuch as the wise have received, and do receive knowledge into their
hearts and minds, they do spread the same abroad by their lips. But fools do
despise knowledge and instruction: and therefore their heart which is void of
knowledge, cannot lead the lips to spread abroad that knowledge which they
have not: but they must declare and babble out folly whereof they be full. For
to teach the which folly, we need to spend much labor there about: we do
but to much learn it: for it is natural unto al men. It is not so with
knowledge: for the wise must labor much to teach it, as Solomon does
signify here, when he compares it unto seed. For as the ploweman does not
sow his good seed without pain and care, and yet after his travel it does
not al prosper: even so although the wise be very careful to spread abroad
knowledge, yet does it not prosper Matt. 13. 3.
as it ought to do: experience teaches it, and our Lord does give it well to
understand. Let us then understand that Solomon comparing knowledge unto
seed, does after a sort accuse men of ingratitude, because they despise the
liberality of the Lord, which does not spare to hide knowledge from them. The
foolish do not now take heed thereof, but hereafter they shall feel that
they are not accused in vain.

8 The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of
the righteous is acceptable unto him.
Men have at al times holden a certain manner whereby they have made
profession that they had some kind of religion, and that they would serve and
honor God. And this has not only been observed of the good, but also of the
wicked. But God never accepted the service of the wicked: as he showed unto
Caine, and as Genesis 4. 3. 5.
we may gather of the Scripture, when from the death of righteous. Abel, it
speaks not that any did serve God, until that it says, That Seth had a
son, etc. This is not to say that men till then did offer Genesis 4. 26.
no sacrifices nor oblations, as a service unto GOD: but that they were so
corrupted, that God did not accept their service, and the multitude of the
wicked caused that no man could easily discern whether there were any Church
of God or no, till Enoch was borne. Even so then we may well know that God
allowed not the sacrifices of the wicked: as also he has showed in the time
of Exo. 32. 7. Number. 16. 21 Psalm. 40. 7.
Moses, and has likewise declared by his Prophets. We have now Solomon
which does pronounce it plainly, when he says, The Sacrifice of the wicked
is abomination unto the Lord. By Sacrifice, Solomon understands whatsoever
is done outwardly and. 50. 8. and. 51. 18. Esaias. 66. 3. Mich. 6. 6. 7.
for to serve God withal, which has appearance of holiness and religion, and
which is ordained of God for his honor, and for to make profession when one will
protest to be of his people. He pronounces that al such kind of service is
nothing worth, but to vex and despite GOD, and to provoke him to anger and
wrath, when it is done by the wicked which have no fear nor reverence of his
word, nor bear any love unto their neighbors, though they labor to make
themselves believe it, and would have men believe that they are devout and
good Catholics. Let the wicked therefore which have no mind to amend their
lives, but wax obstinate and hardened in their malice, resort unto the
Sermons, let them receive the Supper of the Lord, and let them do outwardly
all the works of a Christian, yet do they nothing but all abomination before
the Lord. True it is that they shall be greatly praised of those which know not
their wickedness, and shall be esteemed more holy and devout, than honest and
good men: as also they labor to be preferred before them. Solomon does
signify it after a sort, when he does attribute to the wicked that they do
offer sacrifice: the which is a thing of greater appearance then is the prayer
which Solomon does attribute unto the righteous, But the prayer of the
righteous is aceptable unto him. Wherein the faithful and children of God are
warned to walk in righteousness, without declining from it, and that in all
their necessities they should direct their prayers unto God, not seeking to
be seen of men, and should not be troubled, though the service they do
unto God, is not of such great price before the world, as the goodly visour of
the wicked. Yet notwithstanding let them be grieved that the world judges so
wickedly: but as touching them, let them be Mat. 6. 5.
contented to be assured that God does willingly hear them, for to grant
unto their petitions. Solomon does give us this to understand, when he says,
That their prayer is acceptable unto the Lord. When he speaks thus, he
shows unto us that they which are righteous in heart, are never refused, but
that God does delight to help them in their necessities. Diverse Saints have
proved it true: and amongst others, David: I besought the Lord, and he heard
me. The Lord says, To him will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a
contrite spirit, and trembles at my words. Likewise Psa. 34. 5. Esaias. 66. 2.
we may here learn, that for to be assured that our prayers are acceptable
unto the Lord, we must have testimony in our hearts that we truly hate
wickedness, and that righteousness does please us: Well beloved brethren, if
our heart condemn us not, 1. Ioh. 3. 21. 22.
then have we boldness toward God, And whatsoever we ask, we receive of
him. But what righteousness soever is in us, yet does it not deserve to be
heard. When God hears us in our righteousness, it is of his only pleasure,
and good will that he bears toward us: as Solomon does signify by the word
which is interpreted acceptable unto him. Wherein the faithful ought greatly to
be comforted, when they understand that they are in favor with the Lord,
which owes them naught, nor yet stands bound unto them for any thing. For
the good will he bears them, is not to do them good only in this world, but
to save them eternally: as the righteous by their prayers tend chiefly
thereunto, knowing that the world passes away. And forasmuch as the Papists
do call their Mass a Sacrifice, they may see here that when it is celebrated
by the wicked, that it is nothing else but abomination to the Lord: and so it
is then of no profit: the which is against their foolish opinion: to wit, that
their mass celebrated by a wicked Priest, is of as great efficacy as if it
were said by a good. But forasmuch as the good do not allow stinking and
abominable idolatry, therefore it follows that all they which celebrate the
Mass, are nothing worth: for it is the most wicked idolatry that ever was
invented in the world.

9 The way of the wicked is abomination unto the Lord: but he loves him
that follows righteousness.
Forasmuch as we do al naturally consent and agree that God which is true must
be honored, therefore we must take heed from allowing that he should be
falsified and proved a liar: as it seems reasonable to al men, except they be
out of their wits, past shame, and altogether possessed of the Devil. But
albeit that we confess that it is very reasonable and that it should be too
great wickedness for to belie god, yet diverse of those which will speak so for to
show themselves wise and very zealous of the honor of God, will well allow the
manners, fashions, and trades of the wicked, their counsels, enterprises and
threatenings: as they show when they pronounce them to be honest men: the which
is to make God a liar, who declares unto us that he rejects and forsakes,
and counts whatsoever the wicked do take in hand for wickedness, though it
have a goodly show of righteousness, uprightness and reason. He does lo
pronounce it by Solomon, saying, The way of the wicked is abomination unto the
Lord. When he attributes way unto the wicked, he does yield unto our
rudeness, and speaks after an humane and carnal sense: for truly the wicked
do hold no way, but the same of perdition. And it is not without cause that
he speaks thus: for albeit that the threateninges and doings of the wicked
have some kind of reason, and that it seems they are zealous of
righteousness and equity, nevertheless as they are wicked, even so do they
walk in wickedness, the which is their way. Solomon does show it well, when
against way, he sets righteousness, saying, But he loves him that
follows righteousness. We will hear take justice, for the manners and trade
of life of the righteous, which desire nothing but to yield to every one his
duty, as they are bound by the word of God. But because that such
righteousness proceeds from an heart purified by faith, the Lord loves him
that follows him, and which labors to conform himself unto his God: for
the word of the Lord is true, Psalm. 33. 4. 5. and. 11. 8.
and al his works are faithful. He loves righteousness and judgment, etc.
For the righteous Lord loves righteousness: his countenance will behold the
thing that is just. Let us therefore follow righteousness, the which is not
to frame ourselves after this world. For the will of God is the only rule of
perfect righteousness. And let us diligently think with ourselves, that it is
no small grace Romans 12. 4.
to be beloved of the Lord: and contrarily, that it is a thing greatly to be
feared, for to be abhorred of him. For God loves not the righteous for one
time only: but he continues to love them: as Solomon does somewhat signify
by the Verb of the Futuretence which he uses. And the Lord shall show them
this immutable love, when he shall give them the eternal possession of the
heavenly kingdom. He has loved the^ before the foundation of the world was
laid, whereupon it follows that he will always love them, for he is
unchangeable. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. And
forasmuch as he has loved us before the Romans 11. 28.
foundation, therefore it follows well that it is not for our righteousness,
but of his only grace and goodness, and for the love of Christ, in whom he
loves us. We are not more worthy then the ^^ildren of Israel, to whom Moses
says, Because he has loved Deuteronomy. 4. 37. and 7. 6. and 9. 4.
thy fathers, and has chosen their seed after them, he has brought thee out
of Egypt. The Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a people for himself: do
not think in thine heart, etc. The Lord for my righteousness has brought
me into this land. Also our following of righteousness is never such, that
it can deserve the love of God. For albeit that in following righteousness we
do give a certain witness that we love God, yet is it not to say, that
thereby we can bind God to love us: but of his grace and goodness hepreuenteth
us. And thus, forasmuch as God for the love that he bears us, does make us
to follow righteousness, to love him, and to love his work in us, and does
accept it, and give unto it a reward of his grace and liberality, and not
that he owes, 1. John. 4. 10.
neither that he can owe any thing to him that follows righteousness: but
the love which he bears to them that follow righteousness, is but a
continuation of the same, which was before the foundation of the world. This
perseverance and continuation of love ought to be a spur to make us not to
walk, but to run 1. Cor. 9. Gala. 5. 2. Tim. 4. Acts. 13. and 20. 24.
in the path of righteousness. And also the life and conversation of a
Christian is compared unto a course or raze in running.

10 Instruction is evil to him that forsakes the way: and he that hates
correction, shall die.
Solomon has often spoken of instruction, in exhorting us to receive it, by
praising them which receive and keep it, in complaining also of them which
reject it, blaming and threatening them. And then and there we have declared
that instruction consists in doctrine, in exhortations, reprehensions,
admonitions, corrections, threateninges, punishments and chastisements: which
are things very profitable and necessary for men, after the conversation they
lead, and as they are disposed: and therefore they ought to counted good, when
they are applied unto us by the wise which can tell how to use them, not after
our fantasy, but as they see is needeful for us. Nevertheless there is almost
no man but is grieved, as experience does teach us by the great number of
rebels, whereof the world is full. Solomon also does show it, when he says,
Instruction is evil to him that forsakes the way. Forasmuch as he which
forsakes the way, does find instruction evil, and does not like of it, it
follows therefore that it does naturally displease all: for there is none
but leueth and forsakes the way when he is guided after the corruption of his
nature, the which brings and leads us to think and consider of ourselves
great things, and to make us believe that we are wise enough, to rule and
govern ourselves, without having need of instruction, and we think that we are
wronged if any man meddle to show, or correct, and reprove us: and do hate
those which labor to bring us the right way by exhortations, and instructions,
by corrections and threatenings. Thus doing we stand in a poor state, and in
great peril: and if God by his grace and goodness did not withdraw us, and
set us again in the way that he shows us by his word, we go unto death.
For he that hates correction, shall die, even eternal death. Wherefore we must
change our nature, or rather that God would change it in us: for of ourselves
we cannot: and should take such heed to ourselves that we should not
forsake his way wherein the Lord has set us and daily does set us by his word.
Otherwise we should be afflicted as were the people of Israel, and should
find instruction evil, and hate correction, and therefore we should die: as
Solomon does threaten us therewith.

11 Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how much more the hearts of
the sons of men?
When the wicked do follow any cause which is not good, they labor by all
means that possibly they can to abuse the judges, and to cause them to find
theirs to be good, either by subtle inuentio^s, and great heaps of rolling
words, either by gifts or presents, or by importunate prayers that they cause
their friends and kinsmen to make for them: and if they can by any means,
they will work that the judges shall not know their wrong matter, and shall not
see the iniutie that they labor to do unto their neighbor. And if they behave
themselves unfaithfully toward the earthly judges, they think and say much
more evil of God. For forasmuch as they see not God before the^, and that he
does not punish them incontinently for their wrongs, injuries, and violences,
they think that God makes no account of those whom they do wrong unto, and
that he has forsaken them, or that he sees not what they do, or else that
there is no God. The Scripture does give us witness that such are the
affections and thoughts of the wicked: But I am a worm, and no man. Ps. 22. 7.
8. 9. and. 71. 9. and. 10. 12. and. 94 7. and. 14. 1
etc. They, which see me, laugh me to scorn. He trusted in God that he would
deliver him. Again, For mine enemies speak against me, and they that lay wait
for my soul, take their counsel together, saying: God has forsaken him,
persecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him. He has said in
his heart, tush, God has forgotten, etc. And yet they say, tush, the Lord
shall not see: neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. The fool has said in
his heart, there is no God. Likewise when the good and innocent be afflicted
and persecuted, either in their goods, or in their persons, without desert at
their enemies hands, and that the evil which is wrought against them is great
and of long continuance in their judgment, and that they see not how they shall
escape out of it, they think that God is departed from the^, and has forsaken
the^, or that he knows not their innocence, and makes no count to defend
the^, and to maintain their good cause. We may see this same by the
co^plaintes that the Saints do make in the scripture, Why sta^dest thou so far
off, O Lord, and hidest thy face in the needful time of trouble? How long will thou forget Psa. 10. 1. and. 13. 2. and 44. 24. and. 73 12. 13.
me (O Lord) for ever: How long will thou hide thy face from me? Up Lord,
why sleep thou? awake and be not absent from us for ever. Lo these are
ungodly, these prosper in the world, and these have riches in possession: and
I have said, then have I cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
innocence. Behold the blasphemies which the wicked do maliciously and against
their consciences, use against the Lord: and also the complaints that the
Saints make by the infirmity of their flesh. Now for to repel and put bake
the blasphemies of the wicked, and to withstand the complaints of the
righteous and innocent: for to show the wicked that they can neither speak
nor think so secretly but that God sees and knows wholly for to yield unto
them as their malice has deserved: and for to make the righteous to understand
that God is not ignorant of their innocence and integrity of their hearts,
and that according thereto he will recompense them: Solomon says, Hell and
destruction are before the Lord, etc. Or, the gulf and bottomless pit. He
does teach us here that there is nothing hid so deeply, that God sees not
clearly and plainly: as also David does show us. We must not wonder at this
for to doubt Psalm. 139. 1.
thereof, seeing that it is he who has created al things, and disposed al, who
has placed every thing as it pleased him: he rules al, and al things are
guided by his providence, and there is nothing that can remove from his place,
except he command it. I am the Lord, and there is no God besides me. And
therefore, the wicked are rightly reproved. Take heed ye unwise among the
people: O ye Esaias. 45. 5. Psalm. 94. 8. 9.
fools, when will ye understand? He that planted the care, shall he not
hear? or he that made the eye, shall he not see? And therefore, let this
present sentence serve to lead us to think carefully that we are continually
before the Lord: and so consequently to make us walk in fear and obedience,
as good children ought to do, in the presence of their fathers. And in this
fear let us assure ourselves that we shall never want, seeing that the eyes of
our father are always upon us.

12 A scorner loves not him that rebukes him, neither will he go unto the
wise.
Solomon here shortly describes what the scorners are: to wit, that they take
not in good part, to be either disprooued, or rebuked: but do refuse al
correction, and do hate them which reprove the^. For since that between hatred
and love, there is no mean, it must needs follow that they hate those whom
they love not. For further to express this hatred, and for to show that they
do wrongfully hate those which reprove them, he says, That the scorner will
not go unto the wise. In this word will not go, he shows that the
scorners do withdraw themselves so far as Pro. 1. 24. 25 29. 30.
they can, and will not hearken diligently unto the counselles of those which
reprove them: as he has declared more at large. In this word goes not, or,
will not go, we may see the hatred to be expressed: for if they did not hate
them which reprove them, they would go unto them not with their corporal
feet onley, but chiefly would run unto them, with their mind and affection,
and would yield their hearts and minds attentive unto their wisdom for to be
partakers thereof, and would not so diligently and so earnestly persecute the
rebukers whom Solomon calls wise. And thus they go but too much with their
bodies unto the wise. Neither is it of this kind of going that Solomon
speaks, albeit, we must seek the company and acquaintance of the wise, for
to receive instruction of them. And forasmuch as the scorners do hate those
which do reprove them, it follows, they are murderers. Hereupon Math. 5.
22. 1. John. 3. 13
we may know, that scorning and mockery is a great wickedness, and that the
scorners are most wicked, and that the gallows of hell is prepared for such,
as for wicked murderers: though they brag to be honest men. Now that they
do wrongfully and without cause hate those which rebuke them, Solomon does
show it, when he calls the rebukers, wise: for since they are wise, they
take diligent heed from hurting of any man: but they labor to speak by
wisdom, that they may profit their neighbors. But we might demand how
Solomon does here attribute wisdom unto those Pro. 10. 11. 20. 21. 31. and 13.
20. Pro. 9. 7. 8.
which rebuke scorners: seeing that he, having declared what trouble happens
to him which corrects the scorner, does forbid to rebuke the scorner. For if
it were wisely done to rebuke, he would not forbid it. For to absolute this,
we must run unto the exposition of these two sentences. We may also say,
that Solomon does not here declare how the wise ought to behave themselves
toward the scorners: but he shows what affections and desires the scorners
have against the wise, and whereby we might know a man to be a scorner: to wit,
when he shows himself evil affectioned toward them which labor to amend
him, and that he does despise and not use their company to be instructed by
them. Wherein we see that we may rebuke the Nicodemites of scorning: for they
love not those which rebuke them, for their dissembling against their
consciences: and also resort not to the company of the faithful, where God is
purely and freely served: they beleeus they are wise enough, and regard not to
go unto the wise whom God has ordained Pastors and Doctors of his Church,
for to utter faithfully true wisdom, and to teach it unto his people, by
admonishing, disproouing, rebuking, and threatening. And if the Nicodemites
ought to be rebuked of scorning, by a more strong reason ought they to be
rebuked, which by the grace of God have had wisemen sent unto them for to
instruct them, and yet, to the great contempt of the Gospel, and of those which
preach it, do wallow in all dissolution: so that the more they are rebuked, the
more they do them. These mockers here, if they hear that we do call ourselves
wise, will mock and laugh thereat, saying, That we presume much of ourselves,
and in scorning-wise, will say, Behold our wise men. But we will answer thereto,
that it is God which calls us wise. Likewise S. Paul forbeareth not to call
himself wise: and says, that he speaks wisdom: he says Mat. 23. 33. 1.
Cor. 3. 10. and. 2. 6. Collo. 1. 28.
also that he teaches every man in all wisdom. Now we have the self same
office which Saint Paul had, and we can not teach wisdom except we be wise,
not of ourselves, but by the spirit of God. Notwithstanding, we do not so
attribute wisdom to ourselves, that nothing more may be added: but we
confess that we have need of daily increase in the same.

13 A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance: but by the sorrow of the heart
the mind is heavy.
We are very glad when our neighbors do bear us a loving countenance: and if
we love them truly, we desire to show them a merry look, because we would
not grieve them. Now forasmuch as a joyful heart (as Solomon says) makes a
cheerful countenance: it follows therefore first of al, that we ought to
labor to cheer up our neighbors, not after a worldly and carnal manner, which
will use pleasant tales, foolish toys, and vain flatterings, lies, and
slanderinges for to pass away the time with as naughty people as themselves.
But we will endeavor to make them glad, in not doing them wrong, and procuring
their wealth toward God, so much as we can to the uttermost of our power:
and chiefly their spiritual wealth: for there is no true joy in the heart,
without this spiritual wealth. The ambitious, auaritious, whoremongers,
thieves, gluttons, and al dissolute persons will rejoice when they have all
that they can wish and desire: but they can not have a joyful heart, as they
well show by their grutching and murmuring, and dispightfulnes that they make:
albeit that oftentimes they force themselves to laugh with open throat, and to
take all the pleasures that possibly they can: nevertheless by other acts and
words, and by other gestures, which partly come from the face, they show that
they have no inward joy, when their countenance shows it not. For the face
of man is all that is showed outwardly: for the word which Solomon uses,
stands always plural, and comes of a verb which signifies to behold,
and so signifies whatsoever is seen in man. Now in the worldly and carnal
men, a man may see many things which are neither fair, good, nor pleasant,
though they be laughed at: wherevpo^ it follows, that they have no merry
hearts. And also their laughing lies not but only in dissolutions,
intisements, filthiness and uncleanness: and in these things consists the joy
of the world. But the true joy stands in the holy Ghost: as Jesus Christ does
well show, when John. 14. 16.
he calls him the Comforter. And not without cause: for there is none that
truly can touch our hearts but he, and we cannot but by him rejoice in God: as
the scripture does teach us, and admonishes us so to do. Secondly it follows,
of this sentence, that if for the love that Psa. 5. 12. and. 32. 11. and 33.
and. 31. 13 Phil. 3. 1. and 4. 4. 1. These. 1. 16 1. Pet. 4. 13.
we bear to our neighbors, we desire to show the^ a cheerful countenance, we
must have a cheerful heart, not with worldly and carnal joy, but spiritual and
divine, as belongs unto the children of God. The which we shall enjoy, if
whatsoever happen unto us, we be contented and take it in good part as coming
from the hand of God, being assured that he loves us, and that he sends us
nothing but is expedient for us: and that knowing it, we yield him thanks
therefore, and sing him praises, and run unto him in all our necessities. Such
joy shall garnishe our faces, and make us acceptable unto God, and our
neighbors, which know and love the truth, will think us fair and pleasant.
Those men and women therefore which would have shining Ps. 119. 162.
faces, let them not seek to paint, nor to deck themselves after the fashion
and trade of the world, but let them labor to rejoice their hearts in the
Lord. The which they shall do, if they set all their delight in his word: so
that they may say, with David, I rejoice at thy word, as one that finds great
spoils. This is the joy and beauty whereof Solomon speaks, when he says,
A joyful heart. For let us not think that he would teach either men or
women Psa. 119. 162.
how they should trim up their faces: there is none but is naturally too
cunning a workman therein. Let us follow this joy, and shun the worldly, the
which brings nothing but sorrow and troble: as they that desire it themselves,
do feel it and confess it: for they say, For one pleasure, a thousand
displeasures or sorows. Now if we be grieved, we can not have a merry and
joyful face: as Solomon A proverb of worldly men.
does signify, saying, But by the sorrow of the heart the mind is heavy.
For since that by the heart and mind, the body is guided and ruled, and that
there is no outward disposition in the body, but comes from within, it
follows very well, that man can not show a loving face, when he is inwardly
troubled and grieved, unless he counterfaite and disguise himself. But yet
finally, it can not be but that he must needs show what he has in his heart,
and that his fainednesse will not declare: for the hypocrite and dissembling man
is so inconstant, that he cannot always hold one state and one purpose. But
albeit that Solomon against a good and holy Romans 12. 15. 2. Cor. 6. 10. and.
7. 10. Esaias. 22. 12.
joy, does set sorrow and heaviness, yet it is not to say, that al sorrow is
evil, nor that it makes man to have an evil countenance, nor that we must
fly al sorrow. Saint Paul does teach us so.

14 The heart of him that has understanding, seeks knowledge: but the mouth
of the fool is fed with foolishness.
We do not gladly suffer ourselves to be called fools, neither do we desire
to be counted such, but we are glad when we are counted wise, learned, and
discreet: and this is also a great delight unto us when we can know that our
wisdom answers unto the estimation, and that we are truly such as we
desire to be esteemed, and that we can give token and proof thereof to our
neighbors. Now for to come by such knowledge, and to give such a
signification, we must not follow the worldly and carnal people, the
superstitious and idolaters, the ambitious and proud: whereof some do think
themselves to be very wise and discreet, when they have wit, and cunning to
guide well their particular affairs, and to make their temporal gain, though
it be to the hurt and detriment of their neighbors. Some will attribute
wisdom and discretion to themselves, when they shall follow their own
fantasies and good intents, and that they shall labor to show themselves very
zealous of the honor of God, though they do clean contrary unto his word.
Other some will think themselves well learned, when they can so work that the
world may wonder at them, and honor them, and can find the means to have
credit, and to be in authority and to bear rule. But we shall then have
certain knowledge to be wise, and shall give true signs thereof, when we shall
have al our affection set to drive al ignorance from us, and to give ourselves
unto the pure word of God, that we may learn perfectly to govern ourselves
thereafter. Solomon does thus pronounce it, when he says, The heart of him
that has understanding, etc. For this only word is our wisdom and our
knowledge. Without it there is nothing but foolishnes, ignorance, darkness and
blindness: albeit that in sight and outward manner of doings, there seems to
be great wisdom without this word. But as already has bin handeled not long
agone, there is neither wisdom, nor knowledge, but that which the Lord gives
from his mouth, the which he gives and imparteth by the wise, which are his
instruments. It is the word of God which is the true food of our souls,
seeing that by it, and in it, Jesus Christ Ioh. 6. 35.
does give himself unto us with all his goodness, even he which is the bread of
life. And although that man is not wise, except his heart be armed with this
knowledge, and that it seems we have no need to seek for that which we
already possess: nevertheless because we never have such perfect knowledge as
were necessary, and that 1. Cor. 13. 9. Ephe. 4. 12. 13.
we have need of increase, therefore the heart of the wise seeks knowledge,
until that he come unto the measure of the full age of Christ: whose disciples
and scholars we must be, and to learn of him so long as we live. If in this
wise we seek knowledge, we shall find it. Let us not then be like unto
those which are full of sermons before they have thoroughly tasted them. For if
they had well Pro. 2. 3.
tasted the^, they would desire them more: seeing that it is so delicate and
dainty meat, and does never grieve nor weary the children of God, but do
so long as they live earnestly desire it: though they have the same abundantly,
but do never cease to add knowledge upon knowledge: and as they abound in
knowledge, and that they have their hearts well fenced, even so do they gladly
talk thereof, for to make their neighbors partakers of the same. For they
which are truly wise and learned, have no straight and close hearts, for to
retain knowledge with themselves, but large and open for to spread and
distribute the same with their mouths. Solomon does signify this same after
a sort, when against the heart of the wise, he sets the mouth of fools:
and against seeking of knowledge, he sets to be satisfied or fed with
foolishnes. It is as much as if he did say, Even as the wise with all the desire
of his heart does give himself unto knowledge, does delight and feeds
himself with the same in communicating and opening of it: even so the fools
give their hearts unto foolishness: as it is manifest, when they have their
mouths filled therewith, that they never cease for to babble out the same. Now
we are al of such nature, and can be no better of ourselves. Wherefore we have
need to pray unto God, that it may please him to change every one of us
according to the state wherein we are placed, and that he would give us an heart
to s^eke knowledge, that our mouths or our faces be not fed with folly: that
is to say, that we take al our pleasure and pastime in things contrary unto
knowledge. For after the common manner of speaking, To feed himself with any
thing, is to be given thereunto, and to have therein his delight, and to spend
therein his time. And it is not without cause, that some do so speak: for
there is nothing in this world that some had rather do, then to eat and to
drink: as experience teaceth when they will forsake al kind of work for to
go to it. Wherein the children of God ought to learn to be shamefast if they
be not desirous to be fed with knowledge.

15 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but a good conscience is a
continual feast.
Prosperity is a state that al desire: and contrarily, there is none but will
avoid himself from misery, so much as he possibly can: but it is not given
unto al to enjoy their desires, and some forsake that which they desire: and
some ill handeled and persecuted of their neighbors, either in their good name,
or in their bodies, or in their friends. If they be infidels and impatient,
not knowing that God (who is just and merciful) does send them these torments
and pains, they feel not this evil only without, but also they torment
themselves within: and so they have no prosperity, neither in their own
opinion, nor judgment of the world. And in this sort is fulfilled in them that
which Solomon pronounces, that All the days of the afflicted are evil: that
is to say, have no good time, but lives, or rather pineth away with misery
and calamity. But if they which are persecuted and tormented, or to whom
there happens any evil without the help of men, are faithful men, and
knowing that it is God which sends the affliction, from whom so ever it
comes, do bear it patiently, and ask of the Lord, that it may please him
to maynteine, strengthen, and comfort them: albeit that such men (in the
estimation of the world, and after the sense of the flesh) have nothing but
evil days. For what strength, constancy and boldness soever the faithful
have in their misery and calamity, yet they are not insensible: otherwise
they should have no need of patience, seeing they could suffer none: Even so
is patience begotten of tribulation: and the scripture exhorts none unto
Tribulation is the mother of patience.
patience, but such as suffer. Albeit (I say) that after the outward appearance
and feeling of the flesh their days are evil, and have no prosperity, yet
are they happy before God, both in their consciences and minds they have more
quietness and rest, then have they which count themselves most happy of the
world, and so their days are not evil, though they be afflicted and suffer
much. Notwithstanding we do not falsify Solomon, for he speaks chiefly of
the afflicted, which neither can nor will bear affliction patiently, and
speaks after the judgment of the world which sometimes fails, and after
the sense of the flesh which the faithful resist, and by the help and grace of
God do overcome it. And forasmuch as they be of good courage, they cease not
even in the midst of afflicton, how hard and sharp soever they be, to be
merry, as if they remained still at a feast and banquet always to make good
cheer. Solomon does signify it, saying, But a good conscience is a continual
feast. God Ioh. 15. 18. 19. 20. and 16 33. Mat. 5. 10. 11. Iam. 1. 12.
does exhort us in diverse places, to be of good courage, and does also set
forth himself as an example, and does pronounce us blessed, if we endure
patiently. The Apostles likewise thought themblessed, and went joyfully before
the Consistory, because they were counted worthy of this honor, too suffer
reproach for the name of Jesus Christ. Their days then were not al evil, but
only in the judgment of the world, which thought them to be cursed, and in the
feeling of the flesh, which is always weak and evil. Therefore if we will
avoid and shun evil days, and to be merry, 1. Pet. 4. 12.
and to be in a continual feast, let us not vex ourselves, what adversity
soever happen unto us: but let us take a good stomach, rejoicing Gene. 47. 9.
Ephe. 5. 16. 2. Tim. 3. 1.
in the Lord: as we are admonished, Dearly beloved brethren, think it not
strange, concerning the fiery trial, which is among you to prove you, as
though some strange thing were come unto you. Let us note further, that al
days are the good creatures of God, and there is none evil in them, but they
are called good or evil, according to that which happens in them, and after
that which is either done or suffered in them. Jacob calls the days of his
life evil, because he had suffered much evil. And they are called evil because
of the slanders and corruptions, which are done in them. And the times are
called dangerous. The evil then is not in the days, but in the persons which
are in them. And so, it is by accident that they are evil, and not by nature.
As touching the rest, as carnal men do think themselves to have a merry
time, when they see the table always covered and beset with good meat, and
that they have a good stomach to eat and drink, and have their desire: even
so when we have a good heart, what thing soever happen us, we have the
continual feast of Gods grace, whereby we are maintained, and Esaias. 55. 1.
Math. 22. 2.
do never want, and also shall never want. This grace is well compared unto a
feast, when we are al called to drink and to eat.

16 Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great treasure, and
trouble therewith.
We desire all that good should happen unto us, and do labor to bring our good
into better: but for to have either good, or to attain unto betternes, al do
not know the right way thereunto. Forasmuch as sometimes already it has
been alleged, it seems unto many, for to get riches, and to live at
pleasure, we need but to turn our backs unto God, not to reverence his word,
nor to set by our neighbors, nor to care whither any do them wrong or no,
provided that we gain something, and gather riches together, that we may have
enough to make good cheer withal, and to be at our ease and to rejoice. But
albeeit it happens that such men have enough, and that they seem to live
prosperously and without hardness: and also that they labor to put away from
them al heaviness, striving to make themselves believe that they are without
danger, and that no hurt can happen unto them, yet have they never steadfast
assurance, but do tremble and are troubled: for their conscience does
reprove them, although they be without true repentance and healthful sorrow.
They fear thieves also, chances and ill fortunes: as through infidelity and
ignorance they attribute whatsoever does happen unto them, unto fortune, when
they come unlooked for. It seems unto the world that such men do hold the
way to get riches, and to attain the better: and contrarily, that they are
unhappy and faintharted, which fearing to offend GOD, do not give themselves
to gather by the hurt of their neighbors, but are contented with that little
which they possess justly. Behold the judgment of the world and of the
flesh: but the holy Ghost judges clean otherwise, saying,

Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great treasure, etc. Now
as it is the judgment of the holy Ghost, even so must he make us to
understand it, and to consent thereunto. For naturally it does grieve us to
have but a little, and we make but small account of the fear of the Lord,
because we see him not, and know not what his fear is. I say that we are
naturally thus Pro. 2. 1.
disposed: but if by the reading of the scriptures and resorting unto sermons
we be diligent to learn wisdom, we shall understand the fear of the
Lord. And once having this fear, which is a reverence that leads us to give
a willing obedience unto the word of our God, and to assure us of his
goodness toward us, the which we shall possess how little soever it be, and
shall be more profitable unto us, then are the great riches unto the wicked.
Psalm. 37. 16. Pro. 10. 2. 3. and 13. 25.
A small thing that the righteous has, is better then great riches of the
ungodly. Now that in the fear of the Lord there is assurance, Solomon does
plainly pronounce it. And he does here somewhat signify it, when against the
fear of the Lord, he sets Pro. 14. 26. 27.
trouble: for where trouble and vexation is, and where there is no rest, there
can be no safety, rest, nor peace. Whereupon it does rightly follow, that
they which have the fear of the Lord are happy, though they have but a
little: and the wicked are cursed, though they win all the world. And as they
which fear God are happy and blessed, not only presently, but also in the
world to come (for they are the household folks and children of God:
whereupon it follows that they shall inherit the kingdom everlasting:) the
wicked likewise who are not without fear, not of God, but of present
adversity, and of torments in time to come (as is signified by the trouble)
are cursed even now, though they possess great riches, since that it is with
trouble. And shall be cursed also in time to come. For what profits it a man
to gain all the world, and to loose his own soul? And also since that trouble
is set against the Mat. 16. 26.
fear of the Lord, it follows that where it is, there they are in danger of
their souls, seeing that the promises of God do belong only unto them that
fear him, and not to them which are troubled and grieved for that which
happens in this world, without looking to amend. And forasmuch as the
promises of God, which are infallible, belong unto them which fear him, it
follows again that there is safety in the fear of the Lord: and
contrarily, that they cannot be but in dout and distrust where it is not. For
to make our profit then of this sentence, let the fear of the Lord be our
Luke. 12. 15. and 16. 9. Heb. 13. 5.
treasure, contenting ourselves with a little, avoiding covetousness: after the
admonitions of our Lord, and of the Apostle.

17 Better is a dinner of green herbs where love is, then astalled ox, and
hatred therewith.
Eueryman commonly desires to make good cheer, and to live merrily: and to do
the same, it seems to them which are given to their mouths and subject to
their bellies, that they need no more but to have the table thoroughly
furnished with a number of dishes, and good wine, and to eat and to drink til
they burst, without caring how they with whom they eat and drink are
affectionate toward them, nor what love they bear to them which lay the
table, or for whom they spread the table. It is enough for them to satisfy
their belly, and to devour and swil at their pleasure, so beastly are they.
But Solomon does show us that the great cheer consists not in the
abundance of dainty meats, nor of strong and sweet wines, and that answers
and pleases the palate of the mouth: for he says,

Better is a dinner of green herbs, etc. By the dinner of herbs, he means
a meal that is easily and soon made ready, and which stands not of many
dishes, nor of great cost: but that is simple, light, and showing sobriety
and temperancie. Solomon makes a great account of such a meal, if they which
eat it are friends together. Friendship then is the sauce which makes the
meat good: and not only this, but also it is the rule after the which al our
works ought to be wrought, otherwise they are nothing worth. Solomon Love ought
to be the sauce to meat. 1. Cor. 13. 1.
(I say) does highly praise such a dinner or meal, that he does prefer it
before great, sumptuouse and delicate bankettes, which are holden amongst men
which love not together, but do hate one an other. These great bankets are
signified by the fat ox. Now albeit he speaks this, preferring a small
thing with love unto very great things which are used with hatred: let us not
think that he would make us Charterhouse monks, and to forbid us the use of
meats, the which are al good: but he shows us the excellency and power of
friendship, which makes that which is smally accounted of, and which seems
to be vile and contemptible in respect of other nourishments, to be highly
esteemed. Contrarily, he shows us what filthiness and wickedness there is in
hatred, when for that the good meats and sanctified unto our use, are less
praised then they that are almost of no price, if we make comparison between
them, and that we look unto the common estimation and sale that is made of
them: and likewise of what nourishment and substance the one is in respect of
the other. And also (as the Physicians do say) herbs do not nourishe a man.
We are therefore exhorted to abhor and fly hatred: and are admonished to
keep us from them which hate us: for before that we be well reconciled, their
company and conversation Gene. 4. 8. and 37. 24. 2. Sam. 13. 29 Mat. 5. 44.
Romans 12. 17.
is very dangerous. Righteous Abel has well felt it. So did Joseph who was
hated of his brethren. Likewise, Amnon. We are also exhorted greatly to esteem
friendship, and to seek it with all men: as our Lord teaches us so to do,
and Saint Paul. And are admonished to live soberly with those which love us,
so that our friendship ought not to cause us to exceed in cost, as do the
worldly and carnal men: nor yet so to pass measure that we should take leave
and license to give ourselves unto al intemperancie and superfluity. Let us
understand therefore that we are taught to follow sobriety and temperancie, and
to abstain from making or using of great and superfluous bankets, for to
maintain the which, some dispende outragiously, in forgetting of the poor,
and despising them: as we have an example thereof in S. Luke: and we see it
daily through the world, that they which either make or Luke. 16. 19.
haunt great bankets, make small account of the poor.

18 An angry man stirs up strife: but he that is slow to wrath, appeaseth
striefe.
Experience makes this sentence so plain, that it needs none exposition,
but we have great need to meditate it well and to take heed that we be not
suddenly overcome with anger, nor be provoked to be easily angered and moved to
wrath. Otherwise, we should show ourselves to be out of our wits: for we
seek for that which we should fear, if we have never so little spark of light
and natural knowledge: for being so kindled with anger and wrath, we stir up
debate so much as in us lies: for our fury does stir us up to strive and
contend with our neighbors for nothing, or for a trifle: or else we provoke
our neighbors which cannot bear our Genesis 4. 8. and 37. 23. 2. Sam. 25.
choler to strive against us. Caine was the captain of such as are furious, as
we may see it. And also the brethren of Joseph have followed him. Saul against
David, Judas and the Jews against our Lord Jesus Christ. Nabal moved David
unto anger. Behold how the furious do stir up strife and do show
themselves to be out of their wits, and to do contrary unto that which it
desires naturally. We would not be esteemed such: wherefore we must
abstain from wrath, anger, and fury: and chiefly to keep us from doing of
evil. Leave of from wrath and let go displeasure: freate not thy Psalm. 37. 8.
self, else shall thou be moved to do evil. I say expressly to do evil and
to hurt our neighbors: for it is very needeful to be angry and to show our
displeasure, for to labor to terrify the consciences of transgressors and
wicked people, for to bring them unto repentance, or to make them more
inexcusable. Moses and the Prophets did so handle the Jews. So did our Lord
Jesus Christ deal with the Scribes and Pharisees. And his Apostles and
disciples have followed him. If we follow them as we ought, and as is
necessary, and upon our anger there arises some strife, we must not therefore
be astonished nor discouraged, as though some strange or new thing did happen
unto us: for it happened so unto Moses and to the other above named. Likewise
strife should not be imputed unto us, but unto the rage and fury, to the
malice and wickedness, unto the pride and arrogancy, to the obstinacy and
hardehartednesse of those which offend, and run into al dissoluteness and
insolency. Nevertheless the malicious and perverse Romans 15. 5. 6. 1. Cor. 1.
10. and 12. 13. Ephe. 4. 4. 1. Pet. 3. 8. Mat. 11. 29. John. 13. 19, 1. Cor. 4.
16. and 10. 31. Ephe. 5. 1. Phil. 3. 17. Heb. 13. 17.
will say, that if any strine against us, that it is because we do them wrong,
when we boldly say unto them the truth, with such severity and sharpness as
they deserve. The like has happened unto our Lord and Master Jesus Christ: and
therefore let us not cease carefully to do our office, what thing soever they
lay to our charge. Let it suffice us that the holy Ghost does give a certain
and true witness in our hearts, that we desire not to be angry, but so much
as possibly we can, and as our office requires it, to be slow to anger, and
to quiet strife: for it lies not in us to have peace with all men, when we
bear the word of peace and the message of reconciliation, and that our
sermons tend to lead us to be of one mind and consent. Now as this is the
office and the duty of Pastors of the Church, even so they which are taught
by them, ought of them to take example, and to follow them: and not they them,
but Jesus Christ who speaks and woorketh in them by his holy spirit.

19 The way of a slouthful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the
righteous is plain.
When we have any vocation in hand, and that we earnestly set ourselves to do
what our duty requires, we are glad if we find therein no hardenesse, and
when we find nothing to hinder us from going forward as God has ordained and
commanded by his word: yea if we have any fear or reverence theretoo.
Whatsoever God teaches us by his word, is our estate, our duty and
vocation which the scripture calls, way, If therein we would find no let
nor hardness which may stop us from running our course, let us not be
negligent, sluggish nor slouthful. For they that are such, are void of good
courage and willing mind: and therefore do find nothing of that which God
ordeineth and commands easy to be done, but are so full (as it is said) of
let me rest, that they forbear and cease from al good work, least they
should be pricked, and get a thorn in their finger. Solomon does signify it,
saying,

The way of a slothful man is as an hedge, When as a way faring man meets
with a very thick hedge of thorns which does Pro. 6. 6.
stop him to go any further, and to make have in his way he is troubled and
grieved: even so the slouthful man which is given to take his ease, and to live
in ydlenes, without caring, but for to sleep and to rest, does find that God
which ordeineth to do after the estate and vocation wheretoo he is called,
troublesome and grievous. Solomon calls the same the way of the slouthful:
not because he walks therein, but for that in following the ordinance of God,
he should walk therein. He compares it unto an hedge of thorns, not for to
gainsay that which is written in the law of the Lord, nor also against that
which our Lord says: but he speaks after the opinion of the slouthful: who
is here called slouthful, not for that that Psa. 19. 8. and 119. 14. Mat. 11.
29.
he abstaineth from al kind of work, but because he delights not to walk in
righteousness, according to the word of the Lord: but does turn his back
against him, and stryueth to do the contrary. Solomon does give it us so to
understand, when against the slouthful man, he sets the righteous, saying,
But the path of the righteous, etc. It is then ill spoken, to attribute
goodness to him which cares not to do well: and therefore, let us not consent
unto the^ which shall say of a man, he is a very good man, but he is negligent
and slouthful: he cares not greatly for any work: for it follows well that
if a man be righteous, he is also ready to do well: and contrarily, if he be
slouthful, that he makes no count of goodness nor of righteousness: and
consequently that it is evil spoken, to say that the slouthful is an honest
man: but if he be called a wicked man, it is the truth, as Solomon does
teach it, when against the slouthful man, he sets the righteous. Speaking
thus, he shows that the slouthful, is a wicked man, and that he is void of
al righteousness: and there with that there is neither care nor diligence
whereof we must make account, except so far as we proceed in
righteousness and that we be not grieved to do well, but that we delight
therein, and that we rejoice in it as in a thing that we find very easy to
be done. Solomon does signify this same by the plain pathe. For as the
passenger which finds his way clean from al hindera^ces does delight in his
way: even so is righteousness the cause that man takes pleasure to do
diligently his duty, and to do carefully his office. Let the thieves,
covetous, usurers, deceivers, and corrupters of Marchandizes even kill
themselves so long as they will with laboring, let them be daily at work,
and let them not cease neither day nor night, yet do they not deserve therefore
to be called diligent: for since they are without righteousness, there is
nothing in them but slothfulness. And also when they shall be well considered
of, we shall never find them contented, but complaining that they cannot
attain their purpose: and so their way is as an hedge of thorns.

Furthermore, if such men might obtain their desires without any travail,
they had rather a great deal to do nothing at all, then to work. For also it
is not with any good desire they have to spend the time well, that they labor,
but only they tend to keep themselves from begging. Moreover, forasmuch as
that man which cease to do his duty, for to busy himself about nothing,
or wickedness, does well deserve to be called and esteemed slothful: therefore
it follows that thieves and all they which follow not righteousness, are
worthy to be counted slouthful: and contrarily, that all righteous men are
diligent. For by righteousness they are led to watch and to labor, and not
only to walk, but also to run by their path, with great desire and earnest
affection they have to do their duty. Wherein we may see that the number of
the slothful is great, and that the number of the righteous is very small.

20 A wise son rejoices the father: but a foolish man despises his mother.
After the wonted custom of the world, the fathers and mothers are very glad,
and joyful when their children are advanced to honor dignity, credit,
pre-eminence and authority, and that they be politic and subtle to gather
riches and temporal goods for themselves, and set al their care and diligence
to be rich. The Kings, Princes and rulers of the earth do rejoice, when they
have a great multitude of subjects given to flatter them, and put themselves
in danger for to maintain their quarrels, and to serve their desires, though
they be against God. They which despise God for to show themselves to be
altogether at the commandment of their Prince, are most commonly counted for
the best subjects, and are most acceptable and best welcome. For the kings and
rulers of the earth do set more store by themselves then they do by God, and
would have God forgotten, that they might be obeyed without contradiction.
The Masters and Dames delight greatly to see their servants and maids to be
so busy and diligent to do their work and to profit the house, that they
forget to serve God, and care not though they do wrong unto their neighbors,
so that they please them whom they serve. We see then that al goes to naught
in the world, when we rejoice at the trades and kinds of doing which lead
souls unto damnation, in stead that we ought to weep for it, and rebuke and
threaten those which occupy themselves in any affairs without the fear of
God, and without love to their neighbors. They which so rejoice, shall at last
weep. And therefore, least we be of their number, let us do nothing without
the fear of the Lord, nor without charity, nor let us not delight in such
works: and albeit that we are in the world, yet let us not be of the world:
but let every one of us, according to the degree wherein we are placed of God,
rejoice to see his inferiors to rule and guide themselves wisely in their
business. Solomon does show us that we should so do, when he says, A wise
son rejoices, etc. Al superiors and al such as have any authority are
here closely admonished to be wise, otherwise they could not rejoice at the
wisdom of those which are under their charge and government, but rather
would be delighted with their folly: for fools do exalt foolishnes, and love
their like. They are also admonished to teach wisdom as well by words as by
works, every man after the degree wherein he is placed: for the lesser must
learn of the greater for to become wise, for to rejoice afterward by their
wisdom their superiors and governors. This same (as has been said) is
here closely taught us: but it is openly showed unto children, and consequently
unto al inferiors, that they must needs be wise, and that they should so well
govern themselves by wisdom, that their fathers and mothers, their superiors
and rulers may delight in their conversation and living. For to do it well, the
word of the Lord must be their only wisdom, and that thereby they may be
brought to fear, reverence and humility, that they may willingly give such
obedience as they ought unto their fathers and mothers, to their superiors and
rulers, and may be wholly at their commandment, so that they may rejoice at
wisdom, and not at folly. This same is taught us by the Exodus 20. 12. Deuteronomy.
6. 20. Ephe. 6. 1. Romans 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13.
holy scriptures. Now that the wisdom which is here spoken of, stands in
this, Solomon does show us, when against a wise son, he sets a fool with
his stubbornness: saying, But a foolish man despises his mother. It is not
without cause that Solomon makes mention of the mother, and that he condemns
that man of folly which by his rebellion and disobedience, or other
wickednesses, grieueth and vexes his mother, and makes her sorrowful: for it
is not only commanded us to honor our father, but our mother also. But it
seems to many children that their mothers are but their servants and maids
of the house, and that we need to make none account of them. Solomon does
attribute foolishness unto such men, and that very rightly: for they have not
the wit to consider, that they were made men in the womb of their mothers,
otherwise they had not bin men. For man is not without the woman: but the man
is by the woman, and that not without great pains and sorrows. It is very
like that Solomon not being contented to say, 1. Cor. 11. 8. Genesis 3. 16.
The fool despises his mother: but calling him a man, would put him in
remembrance of these former things: and also that it was not without care of
the mother, that he is grown since his birth, and come to man's state: for that
that he is man, he comes from his mother.

Moreover calling him a man which despises his mother, and rebuking him of
foolishness, he teaches us, that our great age does not exempt us from the
honor that God commands us to bear to our mothers, otherwise we should
show ourselves to be fools.

21 Foolishnes is joy to him that is destitute of understanding: but a man of
understanding walks uprightly.
We commonly call a man fainte hearted, lacking courage, and void wit, when
he cannot, nor will not give himself to follow that which belongs to his
vocation, or that he will not, and cannot tell what kind of life to choose, for
to spend his time about good works, the which God has prepared that we
should walk in them, and that if we do rightly employ ourselves therein,
we rejoice in the Lord. Nevertheless, there is no man which has his heart so
faint, nor his courage so bace, but does apply himself to some thing, for the
mind of man, is never unoccupied, but is filled with thoughts, purposes,
enterprises, wills, desires, affections of sorrow or of joy: For man must
needs pass away his time, the which he cannot do without the former
things, the which are such, as is the disposition of the heart. If the heart
be good and right, the thoughts shall be good and right: contrarily if it be
evil, so shall they also be evil.

This is judged naturally, but yet our Lord does show it us by Mat. 12. 33. and
15. 17. 18
the similitude of the tree, and by the things which proceed from the heart.
Solomon also does give it us to understand, saying, Foolishnes is joy to him
that is destitute of understanding. When he speaks thus, he declares unto
us, that all his affections, delectations counselles and thoughts, which may
and will not choose, and follow some good and right kind of living, do tend
to make him go astray, or else to make other to go astray and to scatter
them: as is signified by foolishnes which is his rejoicing. For foolishnes
here is not taken only for any light vanity which is committed for want of
heed: but is here chiefly taken for all wickedness contrary unto
righteousness. And so the destitute of understanding is counted amongst the
number of them which forsake the right path, for too Pro. 2. 13.
walk by the ways of darkness. And Solomon does here give it us to
understand well, when against foolishnes he sets, walks uprightly, saying,
But a man of understanding walks uprightly: that is to say, that that man
which gives his heart and mind unto the word of the Lord, and rejoices
therein, does not wander, neither does delight to see or to make other to go
astray, but does study and apply himself to take and remove al stoppes and
lets out of the way, which might hinder him from doing rightly his estate, and
which might also hinder his neighbors, that is to say, that his affection is
right, and is continually occupied Psalm. 1. 2.
in meditating the law of the Lord, that he may learn thereby to correct
and amend his life, and be an example to other, for to lead them to walk
rightly: and if it be needful, to use exhortations, admonitions, corrections,
and threatenings. Lo what to walk uprightly means. For we must not only
have care of ourselves, but also that we have an eye unto the edification and
salvation of our neighbors. We cannot do this of ourselves, as Psalm. 51. 12.
and 119. 17. 133 Mat. 3. 1. and 5. 13. 14.
David did very well know it: and therefore, he prays, Create in me, O God
a new heart, etc. It pertains chiefly unto the Pastors of the Church to
walk thus uprightly: for Saint John the Baptist was the voice of a crier in
the wilderness: even such also ought the ministers of the word to be: for
they are the Heb. 13. 17.
salt of the earth: and the light of the world: they are watchmen that must
give account for our souls. Now every one of us must follow them, according
to the degree wherein we are set. We have al here a very profitable lesson,
but chiefly they which have any authority. And we ought to understand that
by how much as we are in higher authority, by so much the more must we be
the wiser. As touching the rest, the wise and they which shall follow their
upright walking, have a promise that they shall not fall into the pit of hell,
but shall go into life: for they cannot walk uprightly but in the straight way
which leads unto life. Contrarily, the destitute of understanding are carried
by death: for rejoicing in foolishness, they yield and obey unto him that
has the Lordship of death, that is to say the Devil, for whom and his Angels,
is prepared the fire that never shall be quenched.

22 Without counsel thoughts come to naught: but in tho multitude of
counselors there is steadfastness.
According to the affairs that we have in hand, so must we choose our
counselors, for to come to the end of our purpose, enterprises, or desire:
otherwise we shall be void of our intent: even as we do daily prove it, and
as they deserve which will govern themselves after their own fantasy, and
despise al counsel: and so doing, do despise God: for of him comes al
counsel. With him is wisdom, and power: and he has counsel and
understanding. Ioh. 12. 12. Esaias. 40. 12. 13. Pro. 8. 14. 15 16.
Who has measured the water with his fist? Who has instructed the spirit of
the Lord? or was his counselor, or taught him? And here before. And as in
governing ourselves after our own fantasies, we despise God, and do show
ourselves very proud and arrogant: even so God, knows how to despise and to
beat down them which so use themselves, in avoiding their purposes and
enterprises. Solomon does show it us, when he says, Without counsel
thoughts come to naught. This has been proved true from the beginning of the
world in Adam and Eve: afterward in the world by the destruction of the flood:
afterward in them Gene. 11. 5.
which builded the tower of Babylon, and so successively in diverse others. As
in Pharao, Saul, Roboam, etc. And of our time we see it in the great states
of the world, which think to destroy the church of God. According to these
experiences, and also as the holy Ghost has given knowledge to the holy
fathers, they did pronounce the bringing of thoughts and enterprises of men to
naught. God does scatter the devises of the crafty, etc. Again, He takes the
wise in their craftiness. The Lord knows the thoughts of man, that Job. 5.
12. 13 Psa. 44. 11. Psa. 146. 3. 4
they are vanity. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, for
there is no help in him. His breath departs, and he returns to the earth:
then his thoughts perish. It is very necessary that God should so deal with
the wicked and proud, and therefore, David douteth not to pray against them,
destroy them O God, Psa. 5. 11 and. 140. 8.
etc. Let not the wicked have his desire, O Lord: perform not his wicked
thought, least they be proud. Therefore if we would not have our thoughts
brought to nothing, nor made vain, but would come to the end of that we
think and purpose, we must come to ask counsel at God, from whom only
comes al counsel. But because he dwells in the inaccessible light, and that
he is of an incomprehensile majesty and highness, that we may be partakers
of his counsel, for to make our thoughts to stand and be steadfast and to
bring forth their effect, he abaseth himself unto us by his word, the which
he communicates unto us by his wise men and discreet, to whom he gives
knowledge, and opens their mouths for to make them to distribute counsel as
we have need thereof. We must then listen diligently to them which are
committed for to teach us, govern and lead us: and as our affairs do
require, and that we should seek counsel of them which are learned and have
experience: for all the counsel that we have need of, lies not in one man's
brain but every man has his measure which it pleases God to give him. We
have need therefore, for to come to the end of our affairs, that God should
raise up for us many wise men and discreet: Solomon does well signify it,
saying, But in the multitude of counselors there is steadfastness. That is to
say, That if it please God for to raise up for us a multitude of wise,
discreet, and men of experience, and that learning of them, we follow their
doctrine, counsel and advise, we shall come to the end of our enterprises, we
shall not be void of our desires, but shall obtain our wish. For, because we
follow the counsel that God gives by his wise and discreet men, and do not
follow our fantasy, we must be assured that the Lord will give a good issue
unto our thoughts and deliberations. We have had almost the like sentence
before. Now Pro. 11. 14.
in them both, we are admonished not to be like unto Absalom, which came not
to his wished end, but wanting men of good counsel, dyed miserably: nor to
David, when he numbered the people: nor to Solomon, which followed after many
women: nor to Roboam. 2. Sam. 18. 9 10. 2. Sam. 24. 1. 1. King. 11. 1. and 12.
8. Esa. 29. 13. 14.
Neither let us be like unto the Papists, which will be saved by serving of
God (or rather the Devil) by men's doctrine: otherwise GOD will deprive us of men
of counsel. Therefore, this people draws near to me with their mouths, but
their hearts are far from me, the wisdom of the wise shall perish.

23 A joy comes to a man by the answer of his mouth: and how good is a word
in due season?
Solomon does not here speak generally, when he says, A joy comes to a man
by the answer of his mouth: Otherwise there should be repugnancy in the
scriptures: the which ought to be neither thought nor said. For our Lord Jesus
Christ says, Truly I say Mat. 12. 36.
unto you that for every idle word that men shall have spoken, they shall give an
account. Whereupon it follows well that man has not joy for every answer of
his mouth, except it be some temporal and transitory joy, which contineweth
not. But let us not think that Solomon busieth himself to put forth a sentence
of any light or slender matter, and to join theretoo a promise, but let us
understand that he promises here, a steadfast joy and one of long
continuance. For these sentences are the words of God, whereby we are rather
withdrawn from vain joys, then invited and exhorted to set any hope or trust
in it. The Devil, the world and our own flesh, do draw but to much to take
joy and pleasure in our words, though they be nothing worth, and that they be
hurtful unto us, as the end does show it. Let us understand therefore that
Solomon does not speak generally of al words which proceed out of our mouths,
but only of those which are uttered, as we are commanded. Solomon does
expound it so himself, when he asks now, saying, And how good is a word in
due season? The which is as if he said, If we will have joy of the answer of
our mouth, our word must be good the^, and for to be good, it must be spoken in
due time, for a foolish and wicked word has never no due time, seeing it
ought never to be uttered. Now we cannot well follow these admonitions, except
we obey unto that which is said, If any man speak, let him speak as the
words of God. Whereupon follows that a word spoken Ephe. 4. 29. and 5. 3.
Collo. 4. 6. 1. Pet. 4. 11. Ps. 119. 13. 23 46. 54. 97.
in due time, being good, is the word of God, and that it is the same answer
of the mouth, wherein there is joy coming to the man that has an upright
heart, and he may say with David: With my lips have I declared all the
judgments of thy mouth. Princes also did sit and spoke against me: but thy
servant did meditate in thy statutes. I will speak also of thy testimonies
before kings, and will not be ashamed. Thy statutes have been my songues in the
house of my pilgrimage. Oh how I love thy Law! it is my meditation
continually. And forasmuch as there is no season wherein we ought not to
preach the word of GOD, therefore it follows that it is good at al times,
and that they which pronounce it with good hearts, have joy thereof. And since
that the Scripture does attribute joy unto this word, it follows that it
takes away joy from the word of men. For albeit that men do laugh in their
worldly communications and talk, and delight therein, and favor it, yet
therein is no true joy: as we may know in many men, and as the end does
show it in all. Contrarily although we speak the words of God as we ought,
and are therefore persecuted and afflicted, yet nevertheless we cease not to
rejoice, yea with an everlasting joy: As our Lord Jesus Christ does signify
it saying, no man shall take away your joy. Albeit that the Apostles, for
speaking in the name of Jesus Christ, were beaten, yet were they John. 12. 22.
Acts. 5. 41.
not without their joy, And so departed joyfully, because they were counted
worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus. Some do understand this sentence, as
if he would say that a man does rejoice and is well pleased, when he
obteineth what he demands Now albeit there is a diversity in these two
senses, yet there is no contrariety.

24 The way of life is on high to the prudent, to avoid from hell beneath.
He does show us the trade and way that we must hold for to live when he
says, The way of life is on high to the prudent. And he does show how we
should be affectionate, and what knowledge we must have for to hold and follow
this path: when he says, that it is to the prudent: and that he adds, to
avoid from hell beneth: if then we will live, we must not hang down our head,
except Luke. 18. 13.
it be for shame and sorrow for our sins, as was the poor publican: but we
must be righteous, not after the manner of the Pharisee, which bragged of his
worokes, which he thought worthy of great reward and commendation: but for to
lift up well both our eyes and our head, let us despise the world and renounce
ourselves, and let us live an heavenly life: as the Scriptures do admonish us
in diverse places: Amend your lives. etc. Seek first for the kingdom of God
Mat. 4. 17. and 6. 33. and 16. 24. Luke 21. 34. 36 Romans 12. 1. 2
etc. If any man will follow me let him renounce himself. etc. Take heed to
yourselues, etc. Watch therefore and pray continually, etc. I beseech you
therefore brethere^, by the mercies of god, that you give up your bodies aliuing
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable serving of God.
And fashion not yourselues like unto this world, etc. And that considering the
season, that it is and 13. 11. 12
now time that we should arise from sleep. etc. The night is past, the day is
at hand, let us therefore cast away the works of darkness. and let us put on
the armor of light. If then ye be risen with Christ, seek those things
that are above, where Christ sits at Collo. 3. 1.
the right hand of God. If we shoot not at this mark, we cannot brag to be
Christians: for our conversation is not such as it ought to be, as S. Paul
speaking in the name of all the faithful, does show us, saying: Our
conversation is in heaven, etc. This conversation is described unto us in Esaias
and in Micheas the fourth Chapter. Phil. 3. 20. Esaias. 2. 1. Miche. 4. 1.
Thus much for the path of life which is above. As touching now the affection
and knowledge that is required for to hold this path, let us mark how we are
admonished. Be you not like an horse, or like a mule which understand not: But
we must suffer ourselves Psalm. 32. 9.
to be handled and guyded by him which says unto us. I will instruct thee, and
teach thee in the way, that thou shall go, and I will guide thee with mine
eye. Suffering ourselves thus to be guided by the word, which is our prudence
and understanding we shall be wise, and as we desire we shall live, following the
way of life, and shall avoid from hell beneath, where there is nothing but
eternal death, nor can be none other. For since that the Gospel does attribute
life unto high, which is contrary unto beneath: it follows well that he which
has not wisdom to go up, and to avoid from beneath, goes to destruction.
We must then mount up to God, for to learn wisdom of him: and for to do
this, let us hear him speak by the mouth of his ministers: since he will thus
teach us. He can well enough teach us without means, but so long as it
pleases him to use these his organes, let us not despise them.

25 The Lord will destroy the house of the proud men: but he will stablish the
borders of the widow.
The wicked proud, presume so much of their credit and power, and of their
prosperity, that they make themselves believe that no evil shall happen either
to them or to their house, and that they shall want nothing, and as they falsely
believe the same, even so, before the eyes and in outward appearance, they
flourishe in this world for a time, which does not seem of small continuance
to the feeling of the flesh: so that the poor faithful, which are afflicted,
are grieved therewith, and tempted to follow those wicked men, for to have
their ease, and to be in prosperity, as they see the wicked are. All this same
has been showed already by the holy Scriptures. Now albeit that in the
former sentences, Solomon has Pro. 2. 2. 22. and 3. 31. and 12. 7. and 14. 11.
sufficiently pronounced destruction and damnation to the wicked, and
steadfastness unto the righteous, yet he is not satisfied therewith: and
therefore, to assure and to comfort chiefly the faithful, he shows now that
which we have heard before, when he says, The Lord will destroy the house
of the proud men. Heretofore he has pronounced the destruction of the
wicked, not naming who has done it: but now he declares expressly, that it
is the Lord. Now the word which he uses, the which we expound Lord,
signifies him that has his being of himself, and by whom al things are, and
without whom nothing is. And forasmuch as it is such a Lord, as does take in
hand to destroy and beat down the house of the proud, it follows, it can
not stand. It is necessary therefore that they and their household which does
follow them, and al their goods, must go unto destruction: for there is no power
that can withstand such a Lord, albeit that the wicked be so proud, that
they strive to withstand him. And also, he is an enemy unto the proud, as
he has always showed, even from the beginning of the world. We do thus
expound the destruction of the House, and not only of the buildings and
material houses: for albeit that the pride of the wicked is showed in
sumptuousnes and costlines of buildings, in the which they are pleased, and
take their delight: yet nevertheless in this place we ought to take the house,
for all that seems to be in the possession of the proud. I say expressly,
which seems to be: for truly, the proud have no possession, since the Lord
God destroys their house, and takes it from them. And as by naming the Lord
to be the destroier, he shows, that the proud cannot withstand him, and
that indeed and truth they have nothing: he teaches us also that no evil
shall happen to the wicked, but from the hand of the Lord, though it seems
often contrary, because that God sends visible means, to the which the
destruction is attributed: and if he works secretly, then they do impute it
unto fortune. But howsoever it be, that destruction comes to the wicked, we
must understand, that it is the Lord which destroys their house, the which
they build with injuries and wrongs, with rakings and extortions, with blood
and with murder: as the Prophets do rebuke them for it: Hear, I pray you, O
heads of Jacob, and ye Princes of the house of Israel: should not ye know
judgment? But they hate the Mich. 3. 1. 2.
good, and love the evil: they pluck of their skins from them, and also the
flesh from the bones, etc. Woe unto him that builds a town with blood, and
erecteth a City by iniquity. The Lord shall enter into judgment with the
antientes of his people Aba. 2. 12. Esa. 3. 14.
and the Princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the Vineyarde: the spoil of the
poor is in your houses. As a Cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of
deceit: thereby they are become great and Iere. 5. 27.
waxen rich. We see therefore that the Lord has good cause to destroy the
house of the proud. Contrarily, he takes care to build and to maintain the
house of the humble, even with theirs which makes no count of them, and also
are despised in the world, yea, afflicted and outraged. Of such kind of
people, I say, God takes pity: and therefore he helps their misery and
poverty. Solomon does signify it, saying, But he will stablishe the borders
of the Widow. By the Widow, he means al such as suffer, poor and
miserable: whom the world cares nothing at all for, but does reject them,
and labor to destroy them. But the Lord mainteineth them as he sees to be
expedient for them, and provides for all their necessities: as is here
signified by to stablishe the borders. The miserable ought here to comfort
themselves, when they see how God does offer himself unto them, and becomes
the Carpenter of their houses, and they which do them wrong are admonished
that they have to do with a strong enemy. Forasmuch as Widows, fatherless
children, and strangers are not commonly supported by men, therefore no man
fears to do them wrong, to oppress, to polle and to do the^ violence: but
notwithstanding they take in hand and join with a strong match: for the Lord
does greatly favor them, as it is here briefly showed us, but more Exodus 22.
1. Esa. 1. 23. Za. 7. 9. 10.
largely in other places. Thou shalt not oppress a stranger.

26 The thoughts of the wicked are abomination to the Lord: but the pure
have pleasant words.
Although that by the corruption of our nature we are al evil, and that we are
as it were yoked to sin, yet the holy scripture does make distinction between
the good and the evil: the which is an argument that God does not impute
wickedness unto al men, and that there be some whom he allows for good and
righteous, and that of his only grace and goodness. If then we have our hearts
and minds hardened in evil, making no account to repent, but delighting in
filthiness and uncleanness, in malice and wickednesses, the scripture calls us
wicked, as we are so indeed. And whatsoever we think, consult of, deliberate,
would, desire and take in hand, is in vain: even so is that which we either do
or say. Solomon does show it us, saying, The thoughts of the wicked are
abomination to the Lord. For since Psa. 11. 7.
the Lord is righteous, and loves righteousness, and that he abhors the
thoughts of the wicked: therefore it follows well there is no goodness in the^:
for, inasmuch as the heart is filled with abominable thoughts, therefore it can
bring forth none other but wicked words and works. This same is taught us by
the similitude of the tree. Let the sayings and doings of the wicked, have
never so goodly show, Mat. 12. 33.
yet are they not acceptable: as we have seen, in the 8 verse. The sacrifice
of the wicked is abomination unto the Lord.

And since also that the thoughts of the wicked are abominable unto the Lord,
it follows, that the wicked are abused, when they labor to say or to do any
thing so secretly that GOD should not know it: for since that he pearceth unto
the thoughts, he must needs have knowledge of the desire, the which is not so
much hid: seeing that men which are pour blind, may know and judge it. And
not only they are deceived, but which worst is, they do injury unto God,
esteeming him less then they do a woorkeman toward his work: for they will
confess plainly, that he which has wrought any thing, knows what is in
it: but that which the wicked think of God, when they will hide themselves from
him, it is as much as if the work should say to him that has made it, Thou
have not made me, or, Thou understand it not. And therefore, it is not
without cause why he complains of them. Yet will they say, The Lord sees
them not. Woe unto them that seek Psalm. 94. 7. Esai. 29. 15. 16.
deep to hide their counsel from the Lord: for their works are in darkness,
and they say, Who sees us? And who knows us? Let us take heed from doing
such injury unto our God, but rather let us give him thanks, saying, O Lord,
thou have tried me and known me. etc. Thou know my sitting and my rising:
thou understand Psalm. 139. 1. 2
my thought a far of. If we do truly confess this same, we will abhor and
detest our evil thoughts, and consequently, we will greatly fear to speak
evil and to do evil, knowing that we are always before our God, who loves no
wickedness. Now for to execute the same well, we must change our nature. Solomon
does give it us to Psalm. 5. 5.
understand, when he says, But the pure have pleasant words. If we be
clean from our filthiness and wickedness, by the grace and working of the
holy Ghost, our thoughts shall not be abominable to the Lord: for our words
shall be pleasant and acceptable unto him. The which could not be, except they
proceeded from pure and clean thoughts: for the inward part must first of
al be pure and Mat. 23. 25.
clean, and then that which is without, shall be pure and clean. And as in this
sort we shall be acceptable unto the Master and Lord of life and salvation,
even so shall we be assured not to perish, but to inioye the presence of our
God. Finally, let us note, That whosoever Mat. 5. 8.
has not pleasant words before God, has filthy thoughts.

27 He that is greedy of gain, troubles his own house: but he that hate th
gifts shall live.
He that is prodigiall, spending excessiuely, or that makes no account to gain
his bread, by giving himself unto some good works, which may help to nourishe
him and his family, they say that he holds a fit and right way and trade to
bring al to naught and to be banker out, and that he falls in decay, and
that he is near unto destruction. We can not deny this same, seeing there
are so many proofs of experiences. But if a man be straight and holds fast,
and spares, and keeps his goods carefully, laboring always to add to them
and increase the stock, he will think himself to be a good and diligent
householder, and it will seem unto him, that he holds a meetely good trade, to
become rich. His worldly and carnal neighbors, will be also of the same
opinion, and will think, that there can be no better means to gain his
living, then to be active, and to be ready to draw unto himself. This is
the common opinion, but yet it cease not to be false and wrong. Solomon does
show it, when he says,

He that is greedy of gain, etc. He reprooueth here al covetous, which
never have enough, and the more they have, the more they desire to have, and
still labor to gather, and care not whether they do wrong or hurt unto their
neighbors, but give themselves to peele them, and chiefly when they think that
their neighbors are simple, and that they have not the power to be revenged and
to defend themselves. They which thus covet gain, do labor to make a sure and
continual recompense, and to fill their houses with such abundance, as never
they nor their posterity may have want: but let them flourish, prosper, and be
at their ease for ever. Solomon, I say, reprehendeth al such covetous men, when
he says, that they trouble their own houses. Now that they trouble their
houses, Saint Paul does show it, They that will be rich, do fall into
temptation and 1. Tim. 6. 9.
snares, and into many foolish and noisome lusts, which drown men in
perdition and destruction. But he reprooueth those chiefly which are in
authority, which have power and are aloft above other, and which have the
charge and office, and have the ruling of their neighbors: and in rebuking
them, he also threateneth them with death and destruction. We ought thus to
understand it, forasmuch as the law expressly does forbid them covetousness,
and that God by his Prophets is angry with them, does reproach them for
their covetousness, and does threaten them above al other, Thou shall Exo. 23.
8. Deuteronomy. 16. 18 19. and 17. 17
take no reward, etc. Thou shall ordeine thee Judges, that they may judge the
people with right judgment. Neither shall thou take any reward, etc. And it
is said of the King also, that he shall not heap up gold and silver unto
himself. As touching the rebukes and threatenings, we have alleged some
places, as the 25. verse. Solomon also gives to understand, that he chiefly
reprooueth great men, when against greediness of gain, he sets, to hate
gifts, the which is very fit and proper unto them which are in authority or
office: even as has bin showed by the law, for he says, But he that hates
gifts shall live.

Moreover let us note in this Antithesis, that when he sets, to live,
against troubling of the house, he does show us that he does not speak of a
temporal trouble, and that soon takes end, but of an eternal destruction, as
the same of the rich. For since that he Luke. 16. 26.
promises life: and they which hate avarice, and gifts, do often live in
penury, poverty and afflictions, the which is not properly to live: let us
not think that he speaks only of this life: otherwise the state of honest
men should be more miserable then the state of the wicked. But let us
understand that he promises life eternal unto those which hate and abhor
covetousness. If we 2. Cor. 8. 7. and 9. 6. Ephe. 4. 28. 1. Tim. 6. 17. Hebr.
13. 5.
will be partakers of this promise, let us follow the admonition of Saint Paul
and of the Apostle, and let us in no wise follow the opinion of the carnal and
worldly, which say, there is no better getting then gifts.

28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the wicked man's mouth
babbleth evil things.
Solomon does not simply say, The heart studieth to answer: for it were then
a general and universal sentence, the which for the corruption of our nature,
and the malice thereof, can not be true: for there are blockishe minds, and
light wits, which study not, but do only rashly think what they will say,
so that it seems, they speak at a venture without study: as they themselves
do well confess, either for to excuse themselves, or for to show that they
care not what they say. For since it is so (as the truth utters) that from
the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks: it follows that man does not
answer without study, albeeit that Mat. 12. 34.
it is without meditation: for study, is done with thought, deliberation,
counsel and advise. Solomon knowing this, would not absolutely say, the heart
studieth: but he says, The heart of the just does study. And so he does
not attribute study to the heart, but to righteousness. If then we would
rightly study to answer and speak as we ought, let us change our nature,
and that of wicked and unrighteous we may be made good and righteous. Then
God will accept us for righteous, give us grace to study for to answer, not
vain nor wicked things, but shall set our affection and desire in his law,
and therein shall study continually: in such wise as our mouths shall talk of
wisdom: and that we may truly say, that the law of the Lord is our
continual study: as also it is Psalm. 1. 2. and 37. 30. and 119. 97. Deuteronomy. 6.
6. and 11. 18.
commanded. And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart: lay up then these words in your heart and in your mind, and bind
them, etc. If we be thus given to study, we shall have an argument of
probation that we are righteous and we shall delight to answer and pronounce
righteous and holy things. We will not also take the name of the Lord GOD in
vain, neither will we bear false witness against our neighbors. To be
short, there shall not come forth of our mouths, any thing but pure, holy and
clean, according too Saint Paul's counsel. And in thus doing we shall put
away from us a wicked mouth, etc. Contrarily, if we make no account of study,
we shall have an argument and proof that we are nothing Ephe. 4. 29. and 5. 3.
Pro. 4. 24.
worth: and as we shall be wicked, even so shall we be light and rash to
pronounce, evil things: as says Solomon, But the wicked man's mouth babbleth
evil things: to wit, against God and against their neighbors: for they make no
conscience of blasphemy against God, nor to belie and to slander their
neighbors, or else to infect them with evil words: the which is against the
opinion of those which say, that words do not stink, against whom Saint Paul
stands, saying, Be not deceived. Evil 1. Cor. 15. 33.
words corrupt good manners. Now albeit that he does attribute evil things
unto the mouth, yet it is not to say, that they do not proceed from the
heart, from the abundance whereof the mouth speaks: but wicked things are
attributed unto the mouth, as unto the instrument, which the heart uses for to
blow or utter out. Even so the wicked may be well called, people without
heart, after the common phrase of speech, which is to say, that a man has no
heart, when he follows not his duty.

Furthermore the wicked sort do not think how they should dispose and order
their hearts, neither do they think they have any, as we may know it, when
they boast that they have spoken something without study, and that they
rejoice in their sayings and outward doings Let them then which speak at
adventure, and utter something nothing worth, not brag to be honest men,
since that Solomon does attribute the spewing out of evil things unto the
wicked. But let every one of us reform his tongue, in not uttering any thing
abroad which shall not be first of al well meditated by the word of God:
otherwise we cannot say that there is any religion in us. If any man think to
be religious or devout amongst Ia. 1. 26.
you, and refraineth not his tongue, his religion is in vain. If we study
well for to answer according to the meaning as we have said, before whom
soever it be, we proceed as we ought, and observe that which our Lord
commanded his Apostles to Mat. 10. 19. Luke. 12. 11 and 21. 15.
keep. For he forbids not study: but he would not have us careful and
to take thought, fearing to want an answer before the great men of the world.

29 The Lord is far of from the wicked: but he hears the prayer of the
righteous.
The scripture witnesses that God fills heaven and earth. Wherein we must
understand that GOD is present every where 1. Kin. 8. 27. Psa. 139. 7. 8 Esaias.
66. 1. Iere. 23. 24.
and over all. And yet Solomon says now, that the Lord is far of from the
wicked: but it is not by distance of place, but by consent and help. For the
Lord agrees not with the wicked, but abhors both them, their thoughts, and
their works, as we have seen here before. He does not help them, but
forsakes and casts them of. And also when the faithful are in affliction,
and feel not the help of the Lord present, Esaias. 59. 1. 2.
they complain that the Lord is far from them, and has forgotten them.
Therefore let us understand that the Lord is far from the wicked, because
he gives them not help: and it is because Psa. 10. 1. and. 13. 2. and 22. 2.
Pro. 1. 25. Psa. 119. 155
they nothing regard his word. Health is far from the ungodly, because they
seek not thy statutes. We may say also that the Lord is far from the
wicked: because that they themselves run far from him, and will neither
know him, nor understand his works, but say there is no God, and that
fortune rules all. We may choose these three senses of the Antithesis that
Solomon makes here, when he says,

But he hears the prayer of the righteous. For since that against to be
far of from, he sets in this verse, to hear the prayer: and the Lord in
hearing, consents unto the righteous, and is their help, and the righteous
by their prayer do draw near unto God, so much as they can, craving his
presence and his help, and wishing to know him more and more, and to
understand his doings and works, it follows well that Solomon does show
that we must understand that the Lord is far from the wicked, after the
former sense. And thus in few words, Solomon does describe unto us the
misery and destruction of the wicked, and also their malice, blindness, and
obstinacy: and contrarily, the felicity, and stabilitie of the righteous, and
also their easiness of learning and obedience, The righteous in this world
seem to be cursed, and as it were forsaken of God: for the world does
afflict them, and labor to destroy them: and for this cause it seems that
God does not care for them, that he hates them, and has rejected them: but
since that God hears their prayer, it follows that they are and shall be Psalm.
22. 2. and. 71. 11
blessed, and shall be firm and stable: for by their prayers, they ask
deliverance from al evils, and that God would preserve the^ and give unto them
everlasting bliss. The which he grants them, as we here do hear, when
it is said that the Lord hears their prayer: Psalm. 23. 18. 19 and. 34. 18
and. 145. 19. and. 50. 15.
and also in other places. And forasmuch as the righteous do pray, the which
God hears, it follows that they become willing to learn and obedient,
using prayer, whereby they obey God, who says, Call upon me in the day of thy
trouble, and I will hear thee: and also that they ask nothing but according
to his will, otherwise they should not be heard. And thus they become willing
to learn, and obedient, and the Lord does not impute their sin unto them,
for the which cause nee is far from them, as from the wicked, we might add
(as the truth is) that God accepts their faith Heb. 11. 6. Mat. 21. 22.
John. 15. 7.
without the which none is acceptable to God, but with faith he auoweth all: as
our Lord promises. We do then understand how we should make acceptable
prayer unto God, and shall have a true argument that we are righteous, to wit,
if we be certain of the goodness of GOD toward us, and that in this
certainty we desire and labor to order ourselves unto the will GOD. For true
faith is not idle, as our Lord does teach us, when he asks repentance
with faith. Whosoever woorketh righteousness, Mark. 1. 15. Gala. 5. 6. Iea. 2.
14. 1. Ioh. 3. 7
is righteous. Now forasmuch as there is none, except he be out of his
wit, which would have God far from him, but al desire his help and
succor, we must needs abhor al kind of wickedness, and that we ask of God
to be justified: that by our prayers we may draw him unto us for to help us
in all our necessities. Albeit then that GOD our father knows well what we
have Mat. 1. 8.
need of before we ask: nevertheless since that he would have us to pray unto
him, and that he delights when we speak unto him privily, let us humble
ourselves before him, submitting ourselves wholly to his holy will, and
confessing that all goodness comes from him, and that of ourselves we have
not, neither can have any thing.

30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and a good name makes the
bones fat.
As the man which has lost his sight cannot rejoice in his heart, but is
troubled and grieved: even so he which feels himself to diminishe in wit,
and loses his understanding, cannot have true joy. Contrarily, as he that
has been blind (if he recover his sight,) does delight and rejoice in
himself: even so he which has walked in the vanity of his thought and
imagination, if he come to be awaked Ephe. 6. 14.
and raised out of his sleep, and rises from the dead, and that Christ does
lighten him, he will rejoice in the Lord, he will cast far from him the works
of darkness, he will be no more darkness, as sometimes he was, but being
light in the Lord, will walk as a Romans 13. 12. Ephe. 5. 8.
child of light, receiving that which is acceptable to the Lord. Solomon
does declare us this same in few words, saying: The light of the eyes
rejoices heart, etc. We must thus understand this sentence: for it should not
be notable, if Solomon spoke of the corporal eyes only, except it were by
comparison, admonishing us, that if we have a joyful heart and are glad, when
the darkness of the night, or of any dark prison, or deep pit, are passed,
and that we Romans 13. 1^, 2. Chr. 20. 12.
do see the brightness of the Sun, and are at large in corporal and
temporal liberty: by a much stronger reason ought we to rejoice when the
night is past, and that the day is come: wherein the Psa. 25. 15. and 123. 1. 2
and. 141. 8.
Lord gives us that we may walk honestly. Likewise the eyes in the holy
Scripture are taken for the spirit and mind of man in many places. But our
eyes are toward thee. Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord. Now when the
Spirit and mind of man is lightened Mat. 6. 22. Psalm. 19. 9. and 119. 14. 16.
162.
by the word, so that thereby it is lead in righteousness and true holiness,
he rejoices and delights. Such is the nature of the word received and
disgested. Nevertheless, when it is said, That the light of the eyes
rejoices the heart, we may take these words as if he said, That man
rejoices in his heart, when he sees himself at rest and peace, and in
prosperity: so that he is not vexed, nor molested. For as the night, the
darkness and obscurity is taken for vexation, sorrow, adversity and
misery: even so the light is taken for the contrary. We have looked for
light, and behold Esai. 56. 9.
darkness, etc. This last sense is very fit for that which Solomon adds,
when he says, And a good name makes the bones fat. For he shows by what
means a man shall obtain prosperity, peace and rest. He would have man so
governed, that he should give none occasion to be blamed and rebuked, nor
that any man should think evil of him: but that he should get not abundance
of temporal goods,, power, credit, and authority: but should labor to live
so well, as he should obtain a good name. He expresses how necessary it is
for man to have a good name, when he says, that it makes the bones fat. For
as when the bones are filled with marowe and compassed with flesh and skin, a
man feels himself whole and sound: even so he which gets a good name, and
is in good reputation with his neighbors, feels his ease: for his neighbors
do not trouble him, and he knows that he proceeds in a good conscience
toward the^, the which is a great prosperity, which Solomon signifies by
fatting of the bones. The bones here, which are members of the body, are taken
for the whole man: but chiefly for the Deuteronomy. 31. 20 Job. 36. 16. Psa. 23. 5.
and. 63. 6. and 65. 12. Esaias. 55. 2. Iere. 31. 14. Pro. 11. 25. and. 13. 4.
inward man, whom Solomon labors by these sentences to frame: otherwise
they should not be notable. Now that to make fat, is taken for ease and
prosperity it is manifest enough in the holy scripture, For I will bring them
into the land (which I swear unto their fathers) that flows with milk and
honey, and they shall eat, and fill themselves, and wax fat.

31 The ear that hearkeneth to the correction of Life, shall lodge among the
wise.
We will not take the ear here, for the corporal member which is so named, nor
harkeneth, for the outward hearing only, though it be very profitable and
necessary: for we may see many of those which hear correction of life, and
yet do not lodge amongst the wise, but do despise and fly them, and some do
fear to meet them, and other some do hate them and persecute them, diverse
are sown by the high ways side. But we will take the ear for the
understanding, and for the inward man, and to hear, for to receive, to get and
to obey. In this sort, there is no doubt but this sentence is generally true,
The ear that hears, or hearkeneth to the correction, Mat. 13. 4.
etc. If we will then be wise and companions of the wise, and to be counted
truly wise, we must not chafe, murmr, despite, nor stand against those
which admonish, reprove and correct us in the name of God and by his word,
but we must diligently hear the word of those which labor to amend and
direct us, that they may draw us away from death, and lead us unto life. They
which chide, correct and threaten us, are the organes and instruments of GOD
for to quicken us: contrarily, they which praise, flatter, and dissemble to see
our fautes, are the organes and instruments of the Devil for to kill and slay
us. And therefore Solomon does attribute life unto correction. In this he does
show us that he which takes upon him to correct, ought to do it by the word
of God, the which only quickneth. For this cause God willing to admonish and
rebuke his people by his Prophet Ezechiel, does say unto him. Thou Eze. 3. 17.
18 19. and 33. 11
shall hear the words of my mouth. And afterward he shows him that if he
do dissemble, that death follows after: contrarily, if he did exhort them,
then life should follow both upon him and upon them which should convert. As
truly as I live, says the Lord God, I desire not the death of a sinner. We
must be ware of the Popish corrections: for they come not from the mouth of the
Lord, but by the doctrine of the Devil. But if we cast of such filthiness and
corruptions, and submit ourselves unto the correction of life which is made
unto us by the pure word of the eternal God, we shall dwell and lodge with the
wise, nor for a day or twain, or certain years, but for ever: for if we
lodge in this world amongst the wise, walking with them as we ought, we shall
follow them unto the heavenly habitations and lodgings, where is and shall be
their abiding: for the very wise indeed have no continuing City Heb. 13. 14.
and. 11. 13.
here, but they seek for one to come. They think themselves guests,
strangers, and pilgrims in this world. Therefore when Solomon does promise us
a lodging among the wise, he does closely exhort us to forsake the world.

32 He that refuses instruction, despises his own soul: but he that
obeieth correction, gets understanding.
It is very necessary that we should be careful for our souls, because that
through the corruption and malice of our nature they be weak and given to
evil: whereupon they easily go to destruction and damnation. But there are but
a few which think upon this necessity, and they think that they provide
well enough for their souls, if they gather treasure enough. So doing, they
turn Luke. 12. 16 and. 16. 19.
their backs unto God, who is the father and shepherd of our souls: they cast
away his word, which is the spiritual food, fit, meet, and necessary for our
souls, the which is communicated by the holy Scripture inspired of God. It
seems unto them that in rejecting 2. Tim. 3. 16.
the yoke of the Lord they shall have a merry time, and shall be at their case,
making good chere after the flesh. In this sort they are deceived if they
think to have care of their souls: for they do rather loose them, as
witnesses the general flood and the overthrowing Luke. 12. 20 and. 16. 23.
of Sodom and Gomorhe, and of the two rich gluttons. Solomon also does
signify it, saying He that refuses instruction, or which cares not for, or
forsakes instruction, or discipline, etc. When by these words he signifies
the destruction of those which cannot endure discipline, and instruction, and
correction by the word of God, he shows also that they deserve to perish,
seeing that in despising their souls, they do against nature. For no man ever
yet hated his own flesh. If the soul be not governed as it ought, then must
the whole man fail, which bears the life of the soul, the which is
maintained by discipline, instruction, and correction. Albeit Ephesians. 5. 29.
then that no correction for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous,
yet let us not refuse the same, seeing it brings forth fruit afterward.
True it is that the Apostle speaks of the chastenings that God sends unto
his children, the which ought not Heb. 12. 11.
to be esteemed after the feeling of the flesh, who abhors the cross, and
shunneth it, as children do the rod, not knowing how profitable it is for
them to be corrected. But we must have respect unto the end: to wit, that
the chastisments bring forth righteousness: for the cross leads us unto
the fear of the Lord, unto a religious and holy life. Moreover, the
instruction or discipline which is spoken of, does not stand only in
words, but also in temptations, afflictions, and adversities which it
pleases God to send us. When the Lord does lay them upon us, we must not
refuse them through impaciencie, murmurings, and dispitefulnesse: He would
have us to possess our souls in patience: otherwise we despise him, the
which is very unwisely done of us: as we ought well to understand it: for it
is great foolishness for a man to suffer Luke. 21. 19
him to perish. The which they do, that refuse instruction: for in despising
their souls, they forsake them, and so they must perish. Solomon therefore by
the despising of the soul, shows the foolishnes and destruction of them
which care nothing at al for discipline. Contrarily, he shows us the
preservation and wisdom of those which willingly and gladly receive al good
instructions, admonitions and corrections that are made to them, and do
patiently suffer the corrections which God sends them, when he says, But he
that hears or obeieth. etc. Forasmuch as against despising of the soul, he
sets, gets understanding: let us understand that they which are not
rebellious against the corrections, but does receive them patiently, are wise,
and by their wisdom are kept from destruction: for as the soundness of the
inward parts of the body is the preserving of the whole man: even so wisdom
which is the spiritual Pro. 1. 33. and. 2. 10. and. 3 13.
health, keeps the inward life of man. We speak thus, because that life and
wisdom lies in the heart, as the Scripture says. And the Lord has not given
you an heart to know, and eyes to see, etc. I have Deuteronomy. 29. 4. Psalm. 22. 15.
and. 40. 13. and. 104. 15. Pro. 10. 8. 13 and. 11. 12. 14. 30. 33.
bin powered out as water, and my heart has been melted like wax, etc. A
number of evils have compassed me about, and therefore my heart has failed
me, etc. And wine that makes glad the heart of man, etc. And albeit that
getting is here spoken of, yet let us not understand that it is any other
thing then a pure and liberal gift of the Lord.

33 The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom: and before honor
goes humility.
As we may see, Solomon is never weary to speak of the fear of the Lord and of
wisdom: for he has already oftentimes talked thereof, and now again he
speaks thereof, saying, The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom.
Wherein he shows to his auditorie, that they ought not to be grieved though
he often repeat and rehearse one self doctrine, and that it is very necessary
for us too have the fear of the Lord set before us, whereby we learn not to
fly from the presence of God, and to hide ourselves from him, as if he were a
sharp and unmerciful judge, or a fearful and cruel tyrant: but wherout we
learn wisdom. This fear does not set before us the pains and torments, for
to be astonished and terrified by them, as are the wicked which have no mind
to amend nor to do well. Albeit that we must fear the judgments of God,
wherewith we deserve to be beaten down for the sins that we commit without
ceassing and continually, desiring God to have mercy upon us, and that being
assured thereof, we should abhor our sins, and turn us to do well, as he
teaches us by his holy word, the which we should have in such reverence as it
should greatly displease us to do any thing against the same, and that our
delight should be to submit and humble ourselves thereunto, for to yield true
obedience unto our God. The holy Heb. 11. 7. Gene. 22. 12 Exo. 14. 31. Ps. 119.
120.
fathers had this fear: as the scripture witnesses of Noe, and of Abraham.
Again in Exodus, The people feared the Lord. My flesh trembles for fear of
thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments. This is the fear that God requires
of us. This fear is the instruction Deuteronomy. 6. 10 and 6. 2. 13. and 10. 12 Psalm.
22. 24. and 33. 18 and 34. 10
of wisdom, as Solomon says: And the cause of our foolishness is, that we
want this fear, whereby we might be truly wise: for it holds us under the
obedience of the word of God, which is the wisdom of the children of God.
Without fear (as has been said) we are but fools, and we must begin
thereby to forsake foolishness, and to come unto wisdom, which is the most
honorable degree that we can obtain in this world: and yet there is nothing
more vile and contemptible then is this fear, which has been spoken of, and
from whence proceeds this wisdom so honorable, even as the worldlings
themselves do say, though they understand it not. But since that Adam sinned,
and that he has made himself vile and contemptible, we must by humility and
lowliness, contempt and shame, come unto honor: for as Solomon says,
Humility goes before honor. If we will be honored, let us not be like unto
our first parents, who from the beginning would be like unto God: and
minding to exalt themselves, have suppressed and overthrown themselves with all
their posterity, yea, even unto hell, from whence none could have raised
himself, except God of his grace and mercy, had not taken pity upon mankind.
In thinking to exalt himself, he has cast down himself into great shame and
reproach. Therefore let us not seek to raise our estate but let us truly
confess ourselves to be such as we are indeed, to wit, vile, and of a base
condition: let us abace and humble ourselves, not praising ourselves before men
to deface others. For to do the same, let us give honor one unto another, and
let nothing be done by contention Romans 12. 10. Phi. 2. 3.
or by vain glory, but by humbleness of heart. And let us chiefly humble
ourselves before God, not esteming ourselves worthy to appear before him, and
he shall exalt us. Two men went up into the Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee,
and the other a Publicane, Luke. 18. 10
etc. And S. Peter says, Humble yourselues therefore under the mighty hand of
God, that he may exalt you in due time, etc. We 1. Pet. 5. 6 Luke. 24. 46 Phi.
2. 5.
must not disdain for to follow Jesus Christ.

The xvi. Chapter.
1 THE preparation of the heart is in man: but the answer of the tongue is of
the Lord.
Forasmuch as from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, it
follows thereof, that he which gives man leave to speak, is governor of
the heart, and does order it for to make it to vttter by the tongue such
speech as he pleases. Notwithstanding, Solomon says, that the preparation
of the heart is in man. Wherein it seems at the first sight, that there are
three absurdities or inconveniences. For first of al it seems by his saying,
that man has power to prepare or dispose his heart as he will: whereupon it
follows that we have no need of the promises that God makes unto us
touching the Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Ier. 24. 7. and 30. 33. Eze. 11. 19. and 36. 26.
Psalm. 51. 12.
refourming of our hearts and minds, and also that we have no need to pray
unto God for the ordering of our hearts, and that in vain the holy fathers
have prayed for it: as David prayed. Secondly, it seems that he does
attribute that unto the creature which belongs unto the Creator only: For
since that the answer of the tongue is of the Lord, it follows also that it
is he which prepares the heart for to cause the tongue to speak. If he must
needs meddle with governing of the tongue, it is very necessary that he have
in his power the ruling of the heart, and to dispose it at his pleasure.

David did so well understand it: and therefore he asks first Psalm. 51. 12.
17. and 10. 19.
the creation and renewing of the mind, and afterward he asks that God
would open his lips: Again, Lord, thou do hear the desire of the
humble: thou preparest their heart, and thine ear hearkeneth thereunto, etc.
Thirdly, it seems that he prefers the creature unto the Creator,
attributing more unto him then unto Iam. 3. 6.
the Lord. For though the tongue is a member very hardly too be governed: yet
is it nothing in comparison of the heart, from whom verily proceeds the
hardness of the tongue. We might allege the fourth inconvenience: that is,
that it should seem that Solomon does attribute freewil unto man, as touching
the inward operations, and should deny it him concerning the outward: which
are not of so great excellency: as our God does well show 1. Sam. 16. 7. Psa.
7. 10. Iere. 17. 10.
it us, when he challenges the knowledge of the inward things. Wherefore
let us not think that Solomon has pronounced the first part of this sentence
affirmatively, as though he gave power unto man for to prepare his heart, as
he will: but let us understand that he speaks after a humane and carnal
sense, in deriding the foolish trust of men, which do boldly think, to
consult, to purpose and to take in hand every work of themselves without
calling upon God: seeing that without him they cannot pronounce the least word
that might be spoken: the which is far much less then to purpose, consult,
and take in hand any thing to do. And is as much, as if he did say, man is so
proud and arrogant, that he dare of himself take in hand al things, even
the highest and the hardest, and yet there is not a little work that is in his
power to do. We must then understand how Solomon uses here an ironical kind
of speech against the arrogancy of men, which dare take so much in hand. And
for as much as the holy Ghost does deride the^, it is an argument and proof
that they are near unto destruction. Now to the end that we may not be
mocked, nor destroyed with Psa. 2. 4. 5.
the arrogant, we must humble ourselves, truly confessing that we have
neither spirit nor understanding which can of it self consult upon any good
work. Solomon did well understand it, as he does here closely show it: but it
is more plainly expressed in the answer and demand that Solomon makes unto
God, and also in the answer that God made unto him. Let us also confess that
we have neither mouths nor tongues which can pronounce any good thing, except
God give it. The confusion of tongues does show it, 1. King. 3. 6. Gene. 11.
7. Psa. 51. 17.
and in other places also. I have expressly said nothing that good is: for evil
answers come of ourselves, and of the Devil, to whom God gives the
reprobate over.

All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the
spirits. Neither David, Job, Esaias, nor Daniel did ever think their Psa. 19.
13. 14. and 51. 3. Job. 14. 4. and 15. 15. and 25. 4.
ways to be clean. And if with an unfeigned heart we daily ask pardon of
God for our sins, our ways will not seem unto us to be clean. For this
cause when Solomon says, All the ways of a man are clean, etc: let us
understand that he speaks of men which have no knowledge of the truth, nor
do follow it, but are guided and ruled by their fantasies, and make themselves
believe so much as they utterly can, that whatsoever they think, say and do,
is good and just, and that there is nothing in them that may be reproved, but
praised and commended. With such kind of people popery is much replenished,
and chiefly the celles and dens of those spiritual thieves, Monks and
Nuns. They also which cannot suffer to be told their faults, but what
wickedness soever they commit, have their mouths ready open to lie, in
reporting themselves to be honest men, do labor so much as they can to make
al their ways clean in their own eyes and before their neighbors. But of al
these same their iniquities are so stinking, that we may know that there is no
cleanness at al in them. If they will not confess it, yet God is not blind:
he has so sharp and pearcing a sight, that nothing can be hid from him: as
already sometimes has been showed by the scriptures, and Solomon does now
show it us, when he says,

But the Lord pondereth the spirits. Solomon compares GOD here unto a
merchant, who for to discern well and truly between one merchandise and
another, uses balances and waits. Now the balla^ces of God are his wisdom,
knowledge and understanding. By such balances he tries the goodness and the
frowardnes of men's hearts, and thereby judges with all equity and uprightness,
and truly. The Lord is in his holy temple, The Lords seat is in Psa. 11.
4. and. 33. 13. and 94. 9. and. 44. 21.
heaven. His eyes consider the poor: and his eye liddes tries the children of
men. The Lord looked down from heaven, and beheld all the children of men. He
which has planted the ear, shall he not hear? If we had forgotten the name
of our GOD, and held up our hands to any strange God, would not God have
sought it out? for he knows the secrets of the heart. Albeeit then that men
do flatter and praise themselves, making themselves believe that there is
nothing but al goodness in their ways, yet they win nothing thereby, but
do rather loose and hurt themselves: for they have to do with a judge which
will not justify the ungodly which delights in his wickedness. Thou art not
a Psalm. 5. 5.
God which love iniquity.

Therefore, what fair show of holiness and righteousness soever that is
showed forth in our life and conversation, yet let us not esteem al our ways
clean: but let us confess that we have marks and blottes, uncleannesses and
filthinesses which have need to be cleansed and purged. Let us believe, That if
we say, we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and there is no truth in us.
When we shall 1. John. 1. 8.
truly confess our filthiness, though we have a judge that looks narrowly
upon us, yet will he have compassion upon Heb. 4. 13.
us.

3 Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be directed.
Albeeit that we find how hard it is, yea almost impossible to bring many
things to pass which we think, of and to finishe them as we would (for most
often our thoughts and enterprises are made void:) yet are we so wise in our
opinion, that we think ourselves sufficient to govern our affairs of
ourselves, and to order our thoughts. And herein we show a pride that
Solomon labors to suppress, when he says,

Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts, etc. He labors also to
deliver us from such weakness as hinders us to work, the which does
seem for to surmount our power and capacity. He labors to turn us away
from distrust, which does torment us, although with great boldness we employ
and occupy ourselves about our duty: but we think that the labor that we
take, shall not bring forth such fruit as we desire, or that it shall come to
nothing, and that we shall loose our pains, and our thoughts shall vanishe into
smoke. Therefore for to remedy these three vices, pride, weakness, and
distrust, he would have us to refer ourselves to the pronidence of God.
They which have committed themselves thereto, have come to the end of their
affairs, whereas other have been made void of their hope. Adam and Genesis 3.
and. 6.
Eve did not commit their affairs unto the Lord, but to the Devil: and
therefore they did not obtain their desire. Noe, contrarily referred himself
unto the providence of God, building an Arc at his commandment, for the
sauegarde of his household, and his thoughts were directed: for as he hoped,
so came it to pass. Let them then which feel themselves weak and void of al
men's help, not be discouraged nor despair, as though it were impossible that
they could obtain their wish and desire: but in working as God gives them,
let them rest upon the providence of God, and he will give unto them
prosperity, as shall be necessary for them. Solomon is not only a witness
hereof, but his father David before him, seeing the worldly prosperity of the
wicked, the which was a great temptation unto the faithful and innocent which
were in adversity does admonish them also, saying, Trust thou in the Lord,
and be Psalm. 37. 3 and 55. 23. 1. Pet. 5. 7.
doing good. Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall relieve thee. And after
them, Saint Peter. And herein we must not scatter with ehe wolves, nor fear
if we become sheep that the wolves should tate us: but knowing the providence
of God, and the care that he has over us, let us be patient and gentle, and
let not the wickedness of men provoke us to be like unto wild beasts which
revenge themselves with their teeth, feet, nails, and horns, for to keep
that which they have, or to spoil other of theirs. Let us then be at peace
and quietness in our consciences, and minds, and toward our neighbors let
us be soft, modest, gentle, and lowly. Concerning the rest, though we must
commit our affairs, and cast our burden upon the Lord, yet is it not to say,
that God would have us to be like unto stones, and that we should be void
of al judgment Solomon does signify it, when he says, Commit thy works: and
David, when he says, And give thy self to do well. They do not preach unto
us that God cares for us for too lead us unto idleness, slothfulness, and
carelessness: but least that we should be overcome with fear, and that over
much thought should drive us unto impaciencie: for the knowledge of the
providence of god does not deliver us from al care, so that it is lawful for
men to be without care, and to live after the pleasure of their sensuality and
lust. We must not for the providence of God suffer our flesh to have his
ease: but that our faith should make us quiet and peaceable, and that we
should provoke ourselves neither inwardly nor outwardly against our
neighbors. When every one of us shall be careful to follow his vocation in a good
conscience, beholding that God does command us so to do, and hoping that God
will bless our labor, as he shall see expedient, committing our works unto the
Lord, then shall our thoughts be directed: for we shall not be made void of
our hope, but shall obtain our desires: as the scripture does show in diverse
places. Therefore let us understand that Solomon would have us to be careful,
and that we should diligently employ ourselves unto work, and that we should
do our works not thinking that of ourselves, we can finishe to make our
enterprise prosperous, or that in our work we must trust upon some body, and
that one of us should stay himself upon an other, scattering our works here
and there, and committing them to many: as do the poor miserable Papists
which have their recourse and trust in many Patrones and Advocates: but
contenting ourselves with one only Advocate, we must make as it were a
scroule of our works, bind them up together, and commit all the charge to
him, without distrusting him. Thus doing, our thoughts shall be directed and
established, that we shall obtain as we desire. Solomon has so understood
it, when he said, Commit thy works. etc.

4 The Lord has made al things for his own sake: yea, even the wicked for
the day of evil.
The names and titles which are attributed unto God in the scripture do show
that he is of such virtue, majesty, and might, that he has no need of any
creature for to borrowe that, which he wants, or to make him more perfect in
himself. The scripture does name him the Almighty, The Lord, The Almighty,
the highest, the holy one: not after the manner of men, which for to flatter the
great men, and to be welcome toward them, will give the^ titles which might
well agree unto their estate, but they withstand their manners and kind of
doings, as some will call the Pope, their holy father: and yet there is neither
holiness nor fatherlinesse in him, except he beget bastardes, or children to
the Devil, by doctrines and men's traditions. Other shall be called Catholic and
most Christian, and yet notwithstanding they shall have neither faith nor
Christianity, but shall labor for to abolishe the faith and religion: as the
interim does give witness, and the prisons, banishmentes, confiscations and
burninges do show it in Popery. But our God is of such nature, that no man
can give unto him titles and names too excellent, yea it is altogether
impossible that we should express by words what he is: for he surmounteth
infinitely al things both heavenly and earthly, both corporal and spiritual, so
that we cannot worthily enough either think or speak of him. Wherefore, let
us with all humbleness, fear and reverence, think and speak of our God,
knowing that of ourselves we are not fit nor meet thereunto.

Now for to think or speak well thereof, let us believe and confess that
which was said at the beginning, That he is of such virtue, and power, that
he has no need of any creature, to borrowe and take of him what he needs.
He has well showed this same, when Genesis 1. Psalm. 33. 6. Esaias. 40. 12.
of nothing he created al things by his only word. Esaias also does well show
it, who is he that has measured the waters with his fist? and counted heaven
with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure? and waighed
the mountains in a weight, and the hills in a balance? Who has instructed
the spirit of the Lord? or was his counselor, or taught him? Nevertheless
forasmuch as God has nothing more precious, nor more that he esteems then
his name, his glory, and his honor, and that he will be known, served, and
honored, for this cause he has had regard to himself when he created al
thingss and would and will still be glorified in them. Solomon does declare it
us now, when he says, The Lord has made all things for his own sake. He
speaks rightly so: for when he purposed to create the heavens, the earth and
that which is contained in them, there is nothing which can move him thereunto,
but himself. The goodness and excellency of things which he purposed to
do, could not stir him up to do it: for there neither is, nor can be in
any creature, any goodness or worthiness, that God of his only grace and
pure liberality has not put in them, and for the which he ought not but to be
praised, glorified, and thanked. To the end then that we may not have such
witnesses against us, let us look to what end God has created us, and let us
follow it, and willingly glorifiyng our Creator, trusting upon his goodness,
and giving ourselves to follow his will: and that we be not like unto the
wicked, which do tend to nothing but to dishonor God, and will not serve him,
and yet he has created them for himself: as Solomon does signify, when he
says, All things. They must therefore serve him against their wills, and to
their hurt and destruction. Solomon does show it when he does more openly
express that GOD has created the wicked even for himself: For he is not
contented to say that God has made the wicked, but he says, even the wicked
for the day of evil. This is a very strange thing at the first sight, to say
that God has made the wicked to be glorified in their destruction. But the
matter well considered, we shall see the goodness and justice of God shine
therein. When he stopped the purposes of the wicked, and does bereave them of
their enterprises they take in hand against his people, any man that has
sound judgment will not say but that it is good: and when for their obstinacy
and hardness he shall destroy them, men shall know that he is just, as he
has done unto the people of Sodom, and to Pharao Genesis 19. 24.
and to the people of Egypt, unto Saul, and unto diverse other wicked men. And
if they dare spue out this blasphemy against God, and say, that the fault
ought to be imputed unto him, seeing he makes the wicked to this end, and
that it is not possible to resist his ordinance and will: to this we may
answer, first of all that Saint James says, When any man is tempted, let him
not say, I am tempted of God, for God te^pteth no man. Secondly, that which
Paul says, But what Iam. 1. 3.
art thou, O man, which disputest with God? We must not be so presu^ptuous, as
to judge of gods works which surmou^t our capacity, Romans 9. 20.
but in humbling ourselves under justice, which is incomprehensible unto us,
let us cry, O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
God! how incomprehensible are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
In this our cry, let us fear the judgments Romans 11. 33.
of God, as did Noe: and let us have compassion upon the wicked, as had
Abraham. Behold, how we must be have ourselves toward the judgments of God,
and not to examine them from Hebr. 11. 7 Gene. 18. 24.
point to point, for to judge of them after our sense and reason: for they are
unsearchable. And if we can not rightly behold the Sun, which is but a
creature, by a more strong reason we must understand, that it is impossible
to see God in his Majesty: whereunto nevertheless we labor when we enquire of
his judgments more then that he does open unto us by his word.

5 All that are proud of heart, are in abomination to the Lord: though hand
join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
It is not without cause that David protests, Lord, my heart is not hautie,
neither are mine eyes lofty, neither have I walked Psalm. 131. 1
in great matters and hid from me. For he desired to live after the will of
the Lord: as he does show by his desires and prayers that he makes: let
the words of my mouth, and the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy
sight, O Lord, my strength and Psalm. 19. 14.
my Redeemer. O Lord, I beseech thee, accept the free offeringes of my mouth,
and teach me thy judgments. Teach me to do thy Psalm. 119. 108. and 143. 10.
will, for thou art my God, etc. Now he knew that he could not please God,
but in submitting himself unto him in all reverence, fear and humility: for
as he well understood, the proud does displease him, and are abominable
unto him. The Lord has well showed it in the overthrow of Sodom, Behold the
sin of Sodom thy sister was pride, fullness of bread, and idleness, etc. He
has done the like in the destruction of the enemies of his people: and the
Eze. 16. 49
Scripture does witness it in diverse places. Amongst other places we have
Solomon, who says now, All that are proud of heart, are in abomination to
the Lord. And since there is none of us, how ignorant soever he be, that would
be abhorred of the Lord, but do all from the highest to the lowest desire to
please him, we must renounce pride, which chiefly consists in the contempt
of the word, and in the boldness or rather overboldness that we have to give
ourselves unto wickedness with a set purpose, even when we know well that we
do evil, and that therein we be assured, or at leastwise labor to make
ourselves so believe that we have no need to fear: but notwithstanding what
resistaunce soever we meet withal, we will go forewarde with our
enterprises. The world destroyed by the flood, was stained with such pride:
as we may Genesis 6. 2. Pet. 2. 5. 6. 7.
know it, when by the space of six score years they regarded not to hear
Noe the Ambassador of righteousness. Even so were the Zodomites which oppressed
just Lot, by their filthy conversation. The people of Israel likewise was
blotted therewith: as we may see by the rebukes that Moses and the Prophets
have often given Deuteronomy. 32. 5 Esai. 28. 14
them. And now when the same wickednesses do reign amongst those which brag
of the name of Christendom, they show well that they are defiled with the same
pride: whereupon we must look for an horrible destruction: for God changes
not. If in time past, he has so revenged himself upon the proud, declaring
that he abhorred them, although he seem to dissemble, or that he knows not
at this time the pride of these wicked mockers and contemners, yet after he
has patiently looked for their amendment, he will destroy them in his wrath,
the which they daily heap to themselves: for the punishments of times past
do declare that the wicked in time present shall not escape the hand of Romans
2. 5. 2. Pet. 2. 5.
the Lord. Let us therefore fly al pride, and not look what credit,
authority and power, the proud have in the world, because they are in great
number, and are well joined and confederated after the carnal sense.
Notwithstanding, these things that the world esteems greatly, shall nothing
let that God at his appointed time should not destroy them: they shall not be
exempted from his wrath, but that it shall be easy for him to destroy them
therein. Solomon does signify it when he says, Though hand touches hand, he
shall not be unpunished. The wicked do give hands one unto another, to do
evil, and do maintain themselves as though they did conspire to resist God:
but he mocketh their conspiracies. Heretofore Solomon has uttered the like
sentences against the froward and wicked, comforting also the upright and
perfect by promises.

6 By mercy and truth iniquity shall be forgiven: and by the fear of the Lord
they depart from evil.
When the superstitious and idolaters do think that God is angry against
them for their sins, and that they fear to be punished for them, for to
avoid the pain, and not sorrow for their sin, they will labor to content
God with ceremonies and observations of doctrines and men's traditions, with
foolish devotions which they do upon a good intent, and other inuentio^s of
their own brains that God never commanded, but do displease him: for he
would have us attentive unto his word only, and that we should serve him
after his commandments, by the which he does declare unto us his will,
whereunto we must obey, forsaking al wickedness. Thus doing we shall have God
merciful unto us: as Solomon does promise us, saying, By mercy and truth
iniquity shall be forgiven.

Solomon here would not have us to linger about trifles for to please God, as
if he were a little child that might be pleased with an Apple or with a
Ball; or some foolish and vain man, which is pleased with worldly pastime:
but that we may not be like unto the Scribes and Pharisees, and lest we
deserve the rebuke that is in Saint Matthew, he sets before us what is the
greatest point Mat. 23. 23.
of the law, and that which God most requires above al things: to wit,
mercy and truth: and does promise us, that if we be true unto our God, not
turning from him after strange Gods, but have al our trust in him, being
assured of his goodness toward us, and certified that he does love us, and that
in this certainty and assurance we be soft, gentle, loving and merciful
toward our neighbors, in helping them with that which they have need of, that
God will be merciful, and will not impute our sins unto us. Notwithstanding let
us not think that he will lead us to trust in our merits, nor that he
intends that by our mercy and our truth we should satisfy our faults before
God, so that by such satisfaction, God should be pleased, and should forgive
us the pain, the which otherwise he had laid upon us for our offenses: but
after the manner of the scripture, he signifies that they which by mercy and
truth shall convert unto God, forsaking their former vices and sins, that
they shall find him merciful: as if he said, If we rest and cease from our
misdeedes and wickednesses, so will God appease his wrath, and make his
judgment to cease, and will forbear the condemnation and punishment that we
had deserved. Now because it is needful for to have constant perseverance in
truth, and follow goodness and mercy, let us fly al wickedness. Solomon
does show us how we shall come unto the end, when he says, And by the
fear of the Lord they depart from evil. The which he has taught us before.
Besides this, let us first of al note, that although Solomon Pro. 3. 7. and 8.
13. and 14. 16.
names mercy before truth: yet we must understand, that by order faith
proceeds, and mercy follows as the fruit, but unseparably.

Secondly, let us note, that the justification that we obtain by the
remission of our sins, is given to faith, for that it lays hold upon the free
promises of God, from whom come al blessings to us, and nothing from our
merits.

7 When the ways of a man please the Lord, he will make also his enemies at
peace with him.
If we be stirred to anger, or that we have a contentious and troublesome
spirit which will suddenly fight, and does delight in fighting, braules, and
dissentions, we should greatly desire peace, and we think that we can have
nothing to profit us without it: the worldlings and carnal men, which will
counsel their neighbors how they shall take their ease, saying, Buy peace, and
an house already made. And indeed peace is a very great blessing, which is
much desired, and chiefly when we have to do with enemies, that we think to
be stronger then we be, and whom we fear should hurt us, and with whom
we should have mortal war. But oftentimes it happens, that willing to
avoid one war, we enter into a more dangerous. We seek peace with men,
and we make ourselves the enemies of God: for we follow unlawful means: as
did the children of Israel for to deliver themselves from their enemies, and to
cause war to cease, had their refuge, sometimes to Exo. 3. and 34. 12. Deuteronomy.
7. 3. Esaias. 31. 1.
the Egyptians, sometimes to the Assirians against the commandment of God,
who had forbidden them to make leagues with strange peoples and idolaters. Woe
to them which go down into Egypt for to seek for help, and have not
enquired of the Lord. The Papists are of that number which seek unlawful
means: as is seen in all their devotions in time of war.

And as touching particular matters between man and man, for to get peace and
to stay his enemy, he thinks there is no way but to suppress him, against
that which Jesus Christ teaches us, Resist not evil, etc. But as we commonly
feel by experience, by such kind of doings the fire is kindeled more
strongly, and for one Mat. 53. 39. Romans 12. 17. 1. Peter. 3. 9.
enemy we get many, as also we deserve: for in so doing we follow not the
ways of peace, which is to please, and to be an acceptable service unto God,
who is the author of al peace, and gives it too them which give themselves to
please him: as Solomon does pronounce it, saying,

When the ways of a man please the Lord. etc. If then we would have that God
should stay our enemies, and that he should quiet them (as there is none but
he, that can do it) let us look so honestly to govern ourselves, that we
neither think, speak, nor do any thing that should displease him. The which
we shall do, if we fear him, and trust in him following his commandments, He
delights not in the strength of an horse: but the Lords delight is Psa. 147.
1^. 11. and 149. 4.
in them which fear him with lowlines of mind. For the Lord delights in his
people: and helps the meekeharted. Let us then proceed after this sort,
trusting in the Lord, that we may protest, Lord, I lift up my soul unto
thee: in thee my God do I trust. Thus doing, our ways shall please the Lord,
and so much as shall be expedient, Psalm. 25. 1. 2.
he will quiet our enemies: as he has done Laban toward Jacob, and Esau
toward Jacob, Pharao toward Moses, Saul toward David: even as we may see
by the holy histories. Let us then walk in humbleness of mind, fearing our
God, depending upon him, and giving ourselves to obey him, then may we say,
The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? the Lord is
Psa. 27. 1. and. 118. 6.
the strength of my life: of whom then shall I be afraid? The Lord is on my
side, therefore I will not fear what man can do unto me: We must thus think,
speak, and work with patience. Cast not away your trust the which has great
recompense of reward. Truly Heb. 10. 35. ^6.
ye have need of patience, that after having done the will of God, you may
obtain the promise.

8 Better is a little with quietness, then great revenues without equity.
Solomon willing to lead us to sobriety, contentation, softenes, and goodness,
to reverence and obedience toward God, unto peace, unity and amity,
toward our neighbors, does set before us, that, Better is a little with
quietness. etc. Wherein he agrees well with two former sentences. But what care
soever he has to Pro. 15. 16. 17.
teach us well and to show us how we shall make our profit of the riches that God
gives us. Nevertheless, those which think and say, that we must turn our
back unto God for to become rich, as do the covetous and usurers, they which
occupy with wicked trades, and do pille, and extort, thieves and robbers and
al kind of people, which have their hearts so much in the world, that they
fear the earth shall fail will mock at his doctriue, even so will the
gluttons, and drunkardes which have insatiable bellies, and al they which know
not the providence of God, and stay not themselves thereupon, but think that
fortune which is nothing, does rule, and that riches do happen to those whom
fortune favors, or which takes care and have cunning to get them. Al such
kind of people will mock at this doctrine as the Pharisees which were covetous,
did mock our Savior Jesus Christ, when he said, Make you friends with the
riches of iniquity. Luke 16. 14. 9.
But what contempt and mockage soever they use, the former sentences cease not
to be true, and we have not only Solomon which gives witness hereof, but before
him David also, A small thing that the righteous has, is better then great
riches of the ungodly. And Psa. 37. 16.
also experience has showed it, and does still show it. Abraham being the
land of Canaan as a stranger, was not after outward appearance to be compared
in worldly wealth with the Kings and Princes of the earth: but the people that
he had in respect of them, was better the^ their great abundance was: for with
this that he was contented and had enough, and possessed in a sound
conscience, without doing wrong to any man, that which he had, he had
obtained the great heavenly riches, which he looked for. Co^trarily, the great
men Heb. 11. 10.
of the earth aspiring continually unto greater riches, having neither
contentation nor enough, but having committed much wrong and violence, and
being at continual strife, in the end perished most miserably. Sodom is a
fearful example thereof. Moses did so understand Gene. 18. 20. and 19. 24.
Eze. 16. 49. Heb. 11. 24. 1. Kings. 17. 10. Luke 12. and 16.
it, when he denied to be the Son of Pharaos daughter. Elie and the widow
which nourished him, did prove it true. For the reproving and condemning of
wicked riches, we may bring examples out of Saint Luke. And for the time
present we may see, if we have eyes, that the poor which are contented with a
little, live more at their ease then they which aspire unto greater riches. I
say expressly the poor which are contented: for the poor worldlings and carnal
minded men which think they serve for nothing but to get, are in a most
miserable state: because that first of al they are never contented, but do
murmr and grudge, even against God, who seeks to kill them, as they hold in
their fantasy and mind: as by impatience they dare spue out. Secondly, they
live in an evil conscience: for being discontented with their poverty, they
persuade themselves that riches are common, and that they may take them where
they find them: and indeed, where they are not seen, they pille, poule and
steal whatsoever they can meet withal.

Thirdly, as they are in pains and torments in this world, even so after this
life they shall remain for ever: for they have bin injurious both to God and to
their neighbors, in that they have not bin contented with the things which God
has given them, though they were small, but murmured and waited not upon his
providence, and in this that they have ravished the goods of their neighbors,
against the commandment of God, Thou shall not steal: and against love. Let
us the^ look to follow our Lord, Take heed, and be ware of covetousness: lay
Luke. 12. 15. Math. 6. 19.
not up your treasures on earth, but make you treasures in heaven: And Saint
Paul agrees herewith, teaching us to help the necessity 2. Cor. 8. 7. and 9.
6. Heb. 13. 5.
of the poor. The Apostle likewise, says. Let your conversation be without
covetousness, etc. Thus doing, we shall possess our goods in righteousness, the
which, as concerning our present purpose, consists in this, that we put our
trust in the providence of God, and that we be good and faithful stewards of
the riches that he has committed unto us. In this manner when we shall have but
a little after the feeling of the flesh, it shalbetter profit, then if we
did otherwise possess great wealth. For they that are rich without
righteousness and equity, shall perish with their goods. When Solomon speaks
thus, He condemns not absolutely great reuenews, Mar. 10. 22. 23.
but those which are wickedly gotten and possessed, which consists, touching
the present matter, in distrust of the providence of God, in insatiable
covetousness, and in contempt of the poor. 1. Timo. 6. 9.


9 The heart of man purposes his way: but the Lord does direct his steps.
As we believe that God has created the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all the contents in them, even so ought we to hold for certain, that he
governs al, and that al is disposed and governed by his providence, and that
al is done by his counsel and ordinance, and this that which we daily confess,
when we say, I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and of
earth. For confessing him to be Almighty, we will not only say, that he has
the power without exercising it, but that he has al creatures in his hand and
subjection, that he disposes al creatures by his providence, governs the
world by his will, and guides whatsoever is done after, as best pleases him:
for we must not imagine, that the power of God is idle: but we must
understand further: to wit, that he is always at work, and that nothing is
done but by him, or with his leave, and with his ordinance. The Scripture does
give it so to understand in diverse places. The heavens were made by the word
of the Psa. 33. 6. and 104. 24. John. 5. 17. A^^. 14. 15.
Lord. O Lord, how wonderful are thy works! My Father woorketh hitherto,
and I work also. Turn you unto the living GOD, who has made both heaven and
earth, etc. He gives life and breath unto al, etc. He which planteth, and
he which waters is nothing: but God which gives increase. There is 1. Cor.
3. 7. and. 12. 6. Phi. 2. 13.
one God which works al things in all men. It is God that woorketh in you both
the will and the deed, even of his good will. And forasmuch as it is God which
exercises his power, never ceasing from woorking, but doing al things as
seems him good both Psa. 135. 6.
in heaven and in earth: as David does confess it, I know that the Lord is
great: The Lord has done al things according to his will, both in heaven and
in earth: let us take heed to attribute any thing to ourselves, as if of
ourselves we had some power: but in all humblenes, let us confess and
acknowledge, Lord I know, that the way of man is not in himself, neither is
it in Iere. 10. 23.
man to walk and to direct his steps. For we must acknowledge, as the
truth is, that we are altogether in the hands of GOD, and that he disposes
of us, against al our humane and carnal thoughts, that we should not
presume to assure ourselves in our estate, allowing it good of ourselves, for
God can change it immediately, and do with it as he has ordained in his
eternal counsel, the which ought necessarily to be fulfilled, and can not be
altered.

Notwithstanding, let us take heed from falling into this false opinion and
error, for to think, or to say, that we have nothing to do, and to meddle,
to think, to counsel and take advise how we should govern them ourselves,
seeing that it is necessary that al must happen as God has ordained from
everlasting. For as it is great foolishness and overboldness to take in hand
any work without the Lord, by whose government we are al ruled: even so is
it great beastliness and blockishnesse, for to esteem that the providence of
God should stop and hinder us that we should not consult and deliberate
upon our affairs, and should not labor to do them with good discretion. And
therefore, as here before, in the first verse, he has mocked at the foolishnes
and arrogancy of those which enterprise of themselves: even so now he
reprooueth the beastlines and blockishnes of those which think that the
providence of God hinders us to counsel how we should rule ourselves in
our business, when he says, The heart of man purposes his way, etc. When he
thus speaks, he does show us that the eternal ordinances of God do not
hinder us, but that we should look upon his will to provide for ourselves,
and to rule al our actions. Now this is not without some manifest reason: for
he which has bounded and limited our life, has also therewith given a
carefulnes, and has fenced us with helps and means to preserve the same. He
has also made us to foresee dangers: and to the end that they should not
oppress us without warning, he has furnished us with remedies. We may now
see what belongs to our office: to wit, if God has committed the charge unto
us to preserve our life, let us keep it: If he does offer us helps and
succors, let us use them: If he does show us of the dangers, let us not cast
ourselves at adventures, and without consideration: If he furnishe us with
remedies, let us not despise them. Let us not then follow these dreamers which
do not consider how the Lord has inspired and breathed the knowledge of
counselling and taking heed, whereby they serve the providence of God, and
unto the conservation of our ownelife: as contrarily, by contempt and
blockishnes they draw and call upon them the plagues which the Lord God has
ordained for them. For we shall see that a man which is careful to consult and
deliberate, shall deliver himself from present and near dangers, and the
foolish and negligent for want of consideration and counsel, shall perish. And
this because that foolishness and wisdom are instruments of Gods
providence, as well for one part as for the other: For this cause God has
hidden from us things to come, that we should withstand them, as in
adventures that men look for, not knowing what shall be the end, and that we
should not cease to set against them the remedies prepared, till we become
unto the mark, or that our care serves us to no profit. Then the providence
of God ought not to hinder us, but that we should do our office, and provide
for ourselves. Behold, Saint Paul says well, that God works both the will,
and the deed in us, and yet he cease not to exhort us to work Phi. 2. 13.
12.
out our salvation.

10 A divine sentence shall be in the lips of the King: his mouth shall not
transgress in judgment.
Divination is a thing very abominable before God, as the scripture does
show us: first of al, when it is commanded that the diuiners shall be put to
death. Secondly, when Israel is praised for this, that they had no soothsaying
nor divining. Thirdly, when it is Leui. 20. 27. Number. 23. Deuteronomy. 18. 11. 2. Kin.
17. 17*
forbidden to ask counsel at the soothsayers. Fourthly, when amongst the
abominations, for the which the people of Israel provoked the wrath of God, it
is said, that they were given to follow soothsayers. Fifthly, when the Prophets
are careful to turn the people away from the soothsayers: yet would Solomon
have that divination should be in the kings lips. Here he desires nothing
against the law of the Lord, but he speaks by a similitude, and would that
as the Divines do promise themselves that they are inspired from God, and that
they persuade men to believe that they give a true and certain answer, as if
God had revealed and spoke by their mouths: even so, that kings and governors
of the earth should be so instructed in the law of the Lord, that according
thereunto they should consult, purpose and counsel to do justice and
judgment, and should give themselves to pronounce righteous and true
sentences, and to publish holy decrees and ordinances: in such wise, that for
the advancement of the glory and honor of God, and for the profit and
salvation of the people, they should be in so great estimation toward the
children of God, as were the Diuiners amongst the superstitious and idolaters.
Solomon does expound himself, when he adds, His mouth shall not
transgress in judgment. For he declares that he would have the divination
such, that the Kings should never speak but things that are right, and
just. Wherein he shows not, what are the great men of the earth, but what
they ought to be in their words, and so consequently in their thoughts and
affections of their hearts, from which the words do come. Wherein also he
gives us to understand, that they which can not divine, do straye from
equity, and consequently, are not worthy to be in authority and government:
yet, it is not to say, that their subjects should not give them honor and
obedience in whatsoever they offend not against God, Romans 13. 1. 5. 1. Pet. 2.
13. 1. Tim. 2. 1.
And they must pray for their Superiors. Likewise, let this sentence serve us
to exhort us to lead so holy a life, that we may please the Lord, and that
we take good heed from provoking him to anger by our wickednesses: otherwise
we should be worthy that he should remove and take away from us such
Princes and Governors as have divination: as he has threatened his people of
Israel, and has executed it, when he gave them Kings, Governors, and
Priests, under whom al things were corrupted, and when he Esa. 3. 2.
made them subject unto idolatrous Kings.

11 A true weight and ballaunce are of the Lord: all the waights of the bag
are his work.
The Kings, Princes and Lords of the earth, do ordeine waights and measures
in their countries, and according to their ordinances must the Merchants sell
and buy their marchandizes, without any deceit or guile. And to the end that
the same may be the better observed, the Magistrates, Judges and Superiors
ought to be watchful that the waights, and measures should be known of al men:
they ought also to be vigilant and take diligent heed to this, that they which
sell, keep not two kinds of waights, and two kinds of measures. Moses was as
the Prince and Governor of the people, and it is to him that God speaks that
he should cause it to be observed. Ye shall have a just balance, and just
waightes, etc. Thou shall not have in thy bag two manner of waightes. Leui.
19. 35. Deuteronomy. 25. 13
Now forasmuch as God has commanded just and true waights, and that he
abhors the contrary, it follows well, that they which cause just waightes
to be kept, and also they which sell them, do the work of God: for he
commands nothing but that he himself should do. Solomon did so mean, as
he shows when he says, A true weight and Balance, etc. He shows also
that the false sellers and they which suffer them, do falsify the work of
the Lord God, and so much as in them lies, do make him a false God: and so
not only they deceive their neighbors, but also they labor to make God
guilty of great enormities: for such sale is abominable, as the places
before alleged do show it. And Micheas, Are not the treasures of wickedness
Mich. 6. 1. 11.
yet in thy house? Shall I purge away the false Ballaunce? etc.

Such sellers also work the work of the Devil, and do serve him, for GOD
must needs be served, otherwise we serve the Devil. Furthermore let us note,
that Solomon does set us down here one kind of Civil ordinances, for to
show us that al such as repugne not the word, and are made for to maintain
good order in political government, are of God and not of men. Finally, we are
here admonished that God loves the division of goods of the world, which are
done without deceit: for if al things were common, we should not need
balances nor waightes.

12. It is abomination unto kings to commit wickednes^ for the throne is
established by justice.
The holy Ghost has been very careful and diligent to show unto Kings,
Princes, and governors of the earth their lesson: as we may see by the
Scripture. Moreover, Provide thou among all the Exo. 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 17. 18. Psa.
2. 10. and 58. 2. and 82. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 6
people, men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truly, hating covetousness:
and appoint such over them, to be rulers, etc. And when he shall sit upon
the throne of his kingdom, then shall he write him this law repeated in a
book, by the Priests of the Levites. And now by Solomon he instructs them,
saying, It is an abomination unto Kings, to commit wickedness, etc. For Solomon
does not pronounce that which the Lords of the earth daily do, as experience
does show it from al ages, for the most part they have bin and are given to
great ungentleness and cruelty: but he shows them what they must do for to be
truly kings, and strongly to stablish their kingdom, for to reign and to
rule in peace, not only of this world, but in joy and rest of conscience. First
of al, he would have the Kings and Rulers of the earth to abhor
wickedness: that is, forasmuch as they are Lieutenantes of the holy and pure
God, which hates al wickedness, they ought to esteem themselves abominable,
and to be displeased with themselves, if they be turned back from pureness
and holiness, and if they should be given to think, say or do, any wicked
thing: so that they might say with David, I abhor all the ways of falsehood.
Again, And I hate al false ways. The Lord would have Ps. 119. 104. and. 128.
163. Amos. 5. 15
us do so: I hate falsehoode and abhor it, but thy law do I love, that is
to hate the evil, and love the good. And because that men refuse to obey him,
he uses great threateninges and complaints, and against the Rulers of the
world. Now as the Kings Psalm. 2. 2. and 82. 2. Esai. 1. 22. 23.
ought to abhor to be given unto wickedness: even so ought they to count
their subjects which commit wickedness, and will not cease, but do delight to
pass their time therein, and hate them which labor to withdraw them from it,
and ought to show forth indeed that they hate and abhor them. The which they
shall do, if they rid both their houses and countries of such people, in
punishing and rooting them out as they deserve, and as God has commanded it.
The which David has well understood: for this cause, for to give a lesson unto
Kings, he makes a goodly protestation. Some good Kings (but few in number)
have followed David: and so their throne was stablished for their time: as the
histories Psalm. 101. 2.
do show it: though some of them have born off great storms: as David, Josias,
Ezechiel. Notwithstanding, because that in the fear of the Lord they have been
turned away from wickedness, and so much as they have been able, have rooted
it out of their dominion, and have followed righteousness in governing both
themselves and their subjects rightly, they have overcome al dangers, and have
reigned in peace: and so they have tried that to be true, which Solomon says,
For the Throne is stablished by justice. The which we must not understand
only of Kings, but also of al them which have any authority, rule and
government: as of fathers and mothers, of masters and dames. This is yet not
to say, that Kings abhorring wickedness, should tend to stablishe their
throne, for to triumph and prosper after a worldly sort, but for to serve the
glory of God which does exalt them, and for to make their subjects live in
peace under the fear of the Lord. And as Kings have here their lesson, even
so also have closely the subjects, which desire the prosperity of their
Kings: that is, that it suffices not to cry, God save the King, but we must
abstain from al wickedness, and follow righteousness: otherwise we procure the
overthrow of the Throne,

13 Righteous lips are the delight of Kings, and the King loves him that
speaks right things.
He continues still in giving instruction to Kings, and would have that he
should not delight to hear iesters, flatterers, liers, and slaunderers, and
that they should not suffer under them, corrupt Judges and Magistrates, which
pronounce either for hatred, or for favor, for love, or for accepting of
persons, false judgments, and wicked sentences, and hard ordinances: but that
they should have about them, and intertaine in their houses and Courts grave
men, wise and faithful men, and that they should delight and rejoice in the
words of their lips and mouths which are very profitable and necessary:
for of such men ye shall hear nothing but just and righteous words, according
as their hearts and minds are directed: and that in their countries and
dominions and Lordships, they should be careful to place such Judges,
Magistrates and Officers, not providing officers for men, but offices of fit
and sufficient persons, for to exercise rightly the judgments of God, and to
pronounce right things and sentences, and to make just and righteous
ordinances for to guide and to maintain the people committed unto them, in
true religion, in the fear of the Lord, and in the reverence of his word, by
the which their subjects do learn to live in peace and love.

14 The wrath of a King is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify
it.
Solomon does not here teach Kings and Rulers of the earth to be furious and
cruel, as was Pharao toward the children of Israel: Saul toward David, and
toward Abimelech the Priest in 1. Sam. 22. 16. Dan. 3. 19. and 6. 16. Exo. 2.
12. and 32. 27. Romans 13. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 14
Nob: Nabuchadnezer toward Sidracke, Misacke, and Abednago, and toward
Daniel: Herod toward Saint John Baptist: and as are now the great Lords of
the earth toward the faithful: He also does not reprove their wrath, which
they ought to use against the wicked, as did Moses smiting the Egyptian: and
against three thousand men: Joshua against the inhabitants of the land of
promise: and as al Rulers ought to do against Rebels: But when he compares
the wrath of Kings unto messengers of death, he shows first of al, that the
Kings ought not to be merciful and gentle toward the wicked, as was Elie
toward his children, and as rulers 1. Sam. 2. 23.
commonly: whereupon is come to pass as it is said, The rent gatherers have
spared the Crows and pardoned them: but they afflict and torment the pigions:
and also the great thieves do escape, and the little pick purses are hanged:
but they must do justice in wrath, and not let the wicked escape from their
hands without punishment for that they have deserved: Let the Kings be careful
and dilligent to weaken the wicked, and to take from the^ al resistance, and
that they may Romans 13. 4.
have no power to be revenged: as Solomon does well teach it, when he is not
contented to say, the messenger of death singularly: but in the plural number,
as Messengers. For a man which has but a little heart, will not suffer himself
to be beaten of a man alone, but if diverse do assail him, how valiant
soever he is, he can not with stand, neither will he try to revenge
himself. Secondly, he shows to the subjects, that forasmuch as death is
naturally fearful, therefore they ought to fear for committing any fault,
whereby they should provoke the wrath of their Superiors against them. And not
only so: but also that they ought to labor to quiet the wrath of their
superiors, though they have not provoked it through their fault. And to do it
well, they must be wise: as Solomon does signify here, when he says, But a
wise man will pacify it. He shows also to Kings what kind of people they
ought to have about them, and to whom they must give ear, for to believe and
follow their counsels. Furthermore, forasmuch as the wise do pacify wrath, it
follows, that fools do still maintain it. Now the wisdom which we must
use for to pacify wrath and anger of Kings, is to be Romans 13. 1.
given to do well, and to give them the honor and obedience that we owe them.
I say expressly, that we owe them: for we must not seek the favor of Kings
by unlawful means, as do flatterers: but we must rather sustain and suffer
the wrath of Kings, then to commit any thing that is against wisdom, which is
taught us by the word, in following the custom and patience of Sidracke,
Misacke and Abednago: for we must rather obey God, and honor and reverence
him, then men how great soever they be.

15 In the light of the Kings countenance is life: and his favor is as a cloud
of the latter rain.
As in the first part of the former sentence he has showed to kings and
rulers of the earth, what they ought to be toward the wicked, even so in
this sentence he shows how they should behave themselves toward the
good, that is, that they should be so sweet, so gentle, so gracious and
favorable, that the good should feel themselves quickened, and restored and
preserved from hurt and detriment, from mole station and trouble, from ruin
and destruction, and that they should not live in sorrow and languishing, but
florishingly and in their prosperity, and to be in peace and rest, in joy and
pleasure. Solomon signifies these things by the light of the kings
countenance, whereunto he attributes life, of the which we make little
account, but think to be in death, except we enjoy the former blessings: for
as by night in darkness though we live, yet if they should continue, and
that we had no day, but were deprived from the brightness of the Sun, we
should pyne away, and think ourselves miserable, and had much ^^ther die, and
also we call such a life a very death: even so when the good and simple, the
righteous, and innocent, have straight and sharp, cruel, and tyrannous rulers,
because that under such rulers they are il handeled, though they live: yet for
the miseries, wrongs and violences which they suffer, they languish and pine
away, and are as it were in death. Contrarily, as when the Sun shines, and
that we have the fruition of his brightness, we live in joy and delight: even
so when princes do show unto the good, their favor and gentleness, they are
at ease, and lead a ioyfullife. He signifies also these things, by his
favor: the which he compares unto a cloud of latter rain. For as such a
rain does ripen the corn, and refreshes the reapers, and makes them glad,
keeping them from thirst: even so the favor of kings, is very pleasant and
profitable unto the good and innocent.

16 How much better is it to get wisdom then gold? and to get
understanding, is more too be desired then silver.
When we follow our natural inclination, which is corrupted and vicious, we
think we proceed rightly, and that we tend to make our profit for to keep
us from hurt, and to maintain us in good estate.

Now our nature does lead us after covetousness: for when we yield unto it,
we praise above al things the worldly and temporal riches, and do nothing
esteem whatsoever we think to stop us, from atteining unto the fruition
and possession of them, we turn our backs to God, we despise al religion, we
forget al charity, we forsake all faithfulness and truth: we make
ourselves believe that in this manner we shall greatly profit, and that we shall
build a fair house, and that we shall gather riches for to live in honor,
and reputation, for to enjoy our ease and worldly pleasures, and to Pro. 2. 1.
and 3. 13. and 4. 4. and 8. 10.
be in joy, and at rest, and that thus we may live a long time, and in good
estate, and great prosperity. But in this opinion we are deceived: as Solomon
does show us. And not content herewith, he reiterateth and repeateth again
the same words, when he says,

How much better, etc. He uses repetitions, knowing what is the nature of
man, and that it cannot but very hardly be changed. And the time is but lost
that is bestowed about many: for the covetous where with the world is filled,
hearing these words, do nothing but mock thereat, and do prefer the goods
of the world, before al spiritual graces, yea even God: and have no other God
but their riches: albeit that with mouth and ceremonies of great appearance,
they make profession to know God. And as they do, so do they teach their
children, to do the like. The covetous are not alone which despise this
instruction, but with them, are those which have their hearts more given unto
worldly and carnal things, then to GOD: as are the ambitious and voluptuous.

17 The path of the righteous is to decline from evil: and he keeps his
soul, that keeps his way.
There is none but naturally does think himself righteous: and even the
dissolute and wanton, the most wicked and ungodly, are the most hardy to boast
themselves that they are honest men. And because they are so arrogant and
presumptuous, therefore they are honest men. But because they are so arrogant
and presumptuous, they well deserve to be reproved, and to be disprooued, and
to be said unto, Your wicked life which is given unto evil, and therein
does delight, is a very true argument that there is no righteousness in you.
Solomon does well show this same closely, when he says, The path, etc.
therewith he gives us a certain proof for to assure us whether we be
righteous or no: to wit, if our conversation and manners are such indeed, as
that we fly back from al wickedness. To help us herein, we have need of
Pro. 4. 26. 27 and 8. 13. and 14. 2. 16. Psalm. 34. 13.
the fear of the Lord and of wisdom, as Solomon has showed heretofore.
And therefore because it is not enough to walk wisely, in the fear of the
Lord, and to desist from evil, as David does teach it, promising the same,
when he adds, And he that keeps his soul etc. And shows that we ought
to give ourselves unto goodness, when he speaks of keeping his way. The
which cannot be done but by resisting evil with goodness.

18 Pride goes before destruction, and an high mind before the fall.
There is none which desires or wishes his destruction, and overthrow: but
we al tend unto the conversation and maintenance of ourselves, and of our
goods. And to do the same, we are all blind, and cannot tell how we should
proceed therein, except we be guided by their word: for after our humane
and carnal sense, we are led for to magnify and praise ourselves, and we
think that in this manner we shall do our business well, and that we shall
prosper. But following such an opinion and fantasy, and holding such trade we
deceive ourselves: for in steed of prospering, we go to destruction and decay.
Solomon does so declare it unto us, when he says, Pride goes, etc. Ada^ has
well proved it, when he took upon himself so much that he would be like
unto GOD, for to know both good and evil, to the end that he might make his
work and business to prosper, in steed of being like unto GOD, he made
himself the slave of the Devil: in steed of prospering, he sought his woe,
and has brought both himself and all his posterity to destruction. We might
bring innumerable persons which have proved that pride goes before
destruction, as Solomon does pronounce, not once, but twice: for he adds,
and an high mind, etc. He uses Repetition, the which serves better to
imprint the doctrine in our minds and understanding, and that we should be
less excusable, if we do not make our profit of the doctrine, And also we
are taught, that the holy Ghost is very diligent and careful to teach us.
Therefore let us not despise this diligence and care: and forasmuch as we
desire to avoid destruction, let us take heed to fly pride, the which lies
not only in our outward conversation, but chiefly in the inward affections:
as Solomon does show it, when he calls it an high mind. An high, brave,
and magnifical conversation, is not properly pride, but the fruit thereof.
Therefore to fly pride, let us refourme our affections, and let us not only
become of an humble and lowly behavior, but chiefly of an humble mind. Thus
doing, we shall not be beaten down, but raised up: for whosoever humbles
himself, shall be exalted, not Mat. 11. 29. Phi. 2. 3. 1. Pet. 5. 5.
of men, but by God, and so the exaltation shall be eternal. And forasmuch as
pride does go before destruction, if we be constrained to suffer some
destruction, let us confess we have not walked in humility, but that pride
has taken and beaten us down. Therefore let us think that they are our own
cogitations and affections which destroy us, and not the visible adversaries,
nor the accidens which happen without having forseene them.

19 Better it is to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to divide the
spoils with the proud.
It is far better to submit ourselves willingly unto the yoke of the Lord,
and to bear the cross, patiently to suffer al afflictions with the people and
children of God in acknowledging and confessing our faults and sins, than to
possess abundance of temporal riches, and to be partakers with the proud and
high minded. In this sort, we shall be companions and fellows of Abraham and
other Patriarchs, of Moses, of the Prophets, made like unto Jesus Christ, and
followers of the Apostles. The Cross and afflictions are signified unto us by
an humble mind. And to the end that when they come we may follow this
admonition, Dearly beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,
which is among you, to prove you, as though some strange thing were come unto
1. Pet. 4. 12.
you. Solomon does show us that we are not alone, but that we have some,
whose example we may follow and learn, when he says, with the lowly. And
therewith he would have us to have compassion of the afflicted, ready to
suffer all kind of affliction with them, in following the Hebrews. To whom the
Apostle gives witness, Heb. 10. 32.
Call to mind the days that are past, in the which, after ye had received
light, ye endured a great fight in afflictions etc. The possession of great
riches, is signified by dividing the spoils with the proud. Wherein is marked
the evil conscience and also the violence of the proud, and here is showed us
that they are so proud and arrogant, that they permit themselves to live of
spoil, and have no pity of the affliction of the humble. Of such presumption
follows destruction: and contrarily, forasmuch as God accepts an humble
mind, there follows restoring and life for ever. Let us then conclude, that
it is better to be of an humble mind with the lowly, then to divide the
spoils with the proud.

20 He that is wise in his business, shall find good: and he that trusts
in the Lord, he is blessed.
Albeit that we must refer ourselves altogether unto the providence of God,
and that we can have nothing but thereby, and that we must have al things of
his hand, and that nothing does come to us but by the pure grace and
liberality of our God, without being Pro. 10. 22. Psa. 37. 3. and 127. 1.
lawful for us to think or say, that we may obtain some thing by our
wisdom and cunning, by our care and labor, for it is the blessing of the
Lord which makes men rich, for this cause also David does admonish us,
Trust thou in the Lord, etc. Except the Lord build the house, their labor is
but lost that build it: yet this is not to say, that we must be slouthful,
and not to do something looking that God should feed us. Even before that
man had sinned, God put him into the garden of Eden for to dress it, and to
keep it, and after his fall and offense he laid pain upon him, and would
that man should eat his bread in the sweat of his face: Genesis 2. 15. and 3.
17 Psalm. 128. 2.
And David allows greatly travel and labor. And we see that men never
cease to work in the world, and still to spend the time in working for to
feed both men and beasts: and yet, we must confess that God provides for all, and feeds them, and mainteineth them. Our Lord does teach it us,
commanding us to ask our daily bread of God, in saying, Give us this day our
daily bread: and forasmuch as he forbideth us to care for clothes or food:
therefore Psalm. 104. 14. 15. 27. 28 Mat. 6. 11. 25.
let us awaite upon the providence of God, and let us wholly depend thereupon,
and not in sloth, and idleness: for in so doing, we shall be worthy to want:
but let us be occupied in care and diligence every one after his vocation,
committing our work unto the Lord, and he will make that our labor shall not
be unfruitful, but shall bring profit according as it has been wont in time
Pro. 6. 10. 11. and 10. 4. and 13. 4.
past, and as he has promised to the children of Israel, by Moses and by his
Prophets: and also experience teaches it. For this cause Solomon douteth not
to say, that he which is wise and diligent in his business, shall find good:
as he has said. And when he admonishes us to wait upon the providence of
God, saying, And he Pro. 10. 3. 4 5. and 12. 11.
that trusts in the Lord, he is blessed. And since that we must work, we
must not look unto our cunning and labor, but must assure ourselves of the
goodness of the Lord, being certified that he will make our work to prosper
enough, for to maintain and feed both us and our family, so much as shall be
necessary for us: he will do this first of al in this world, and finally will
cause us to find everlasting riches in the kingdom of heaven: as Solomon
does signify, calling him blessed which trusts in the Lord: for if God did
us but good here in this world, we should be in like degree, either with the
beasts or with the wicked: and so we should not be blessed. And also the trust
that the faithful have in the Lord, ought not to be stayed upon things of this
world, where we have no abiding city, but ought to be lifted up, above al
heavens, we must follow the faith of our father Abraham and of other holy
Patriarchs. Now forasmuch as in working we must trust in the Lord, and Heb.
11. 9
we cannot do it, except we give our hearts unto his word, the which does
show us what we have to do, and does guide and lead us in whatsoever we
have to do, therefore it follows that the word of the Lord is chief part
of our work. And also the word that we have expounded, business, signifies,
word: after the which signification, we might give an other sense unto this
sentence, and say, he that is attentive unto the word, shall find good. This
sense here is diverse and not contrary, but true agreeing unto the promises
that God has made to them which shall submit themselves unto his word, by
faith and repentance. Moreover, since that in working we must trust in God,
being certified that he will not deceive us, but will fulfill his promise, making
us to find good, and blessing us, it follows that we are taught how we
should follow the faithfulness of our God, and in no wise to labor too
disguise and counterfaite our business and our work, for to beguile and
deceive our neighbors, otherwise we should not have our trust in the Lord,
but in deceit, whereby we might draw the substance of our neighbors unto us,
and in this manner we should deserve that our labor should perish in smoke,
and that we should want al goods. Therefore if we will be partakers of the
promises contained in this sentence, let us proceed in doing of our work and
business with all fidelity and truth, following the counsel of David; Put not
your trust in oppression nor in robbery: be not vain: Psalm. 62. 10.
If riches increase, set not your heart thereon. Finally, let us note that
Solomon does not attribute riches unto works, but unto faith: though goods
do follow works.

21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips
shall increase doctrine.
We find very few people which delight to be esteemed or called fools,
ignorant or blockish, but al desire to be praised and commended as wise,
learned, and discrete. Now for to obtain this reputation and praise, we
labor to do or say some things which are esteemed of the world, and which
do rauishe the minds of men into admiration and woonderment for the newness
and strangeness thereof, or for the fair show, or temporal profit that is
received of it, or is looked of it. In the mean while God is forgotten, and his
word despised, the which only is our true wisdom and prudence, when our
heart is set thereupon, when we truly love it, and that with a sound and
perfect affection, we frame our manners after that which it teaches us. If
we use ourselves thus, God will give us this grace, that for the wisdom of our
hearts, we shall obtain reputation and praise of prudence and understanding:
Solomon does signify it, when he says, The wise in heart shall be called
prudent. And because that some might have asked, whereby shall we know a wise
man in heart, that we may truly call him prudent or learned: seeing that man
sees but the face, and there is none but God which knows and searches the
hearts: I answer, that the wisdom of the heart is showed forth in the
lips, and sweet and gentle words, by exhorting our neighbors to learn,
and gives them a desire to grow and increase in doctrine, and to become more
and more learned. Solomon does give it us so to understand, when he says, and
the sweetness of the lips shall increase doctrine. Here he names nothing
but the lips, because they are the organes and instruments, by the which the
word of God is communicated unto us, the which is our wisdom and
understanding. And yet under the sweetness of the lips, he leaves not to
comprehend al actions and kinds of doings, whereto we are led by love, for
to be a good example unto our neighbors, and to give them instruction, not
only by word of mouth, but also by conversation of life. For it is not enough
that our lips should preach, but also al our life. Behold, this is the
sweetness, whereby we must exhort our neighbors too receive doctrine more
and more, showing unto them the wisdom of our hearts, that to the glory of
God, and profit of our neighbors, we may be praised and commended as
prudent. Notwithstanding we must take heed of the sweetness of false
Prophets and lying Teachers, Romans 16. 17. 18.
that we be not deceived and beguiled as well by their words, as by their
works.

22 Understanding is a well spring of life unto them that have it: and the
instruction of fools, is folly.
When we are greatly a thirst, we desire very earnestly to find some good and
clear fountain, that we may drink thereof, and slake our thirst. Now we
are al naturally dry with blindness, ignorance, vanity, and with folly,
through which we faint, and do miserably dye, except we be succored. And
because we desire life, and cannot tell where to find it, and yet we have
great need of it: for this cause Solomon wishing our good, has heretofore
Pro. 2. 1. and 3. 13. and 4. 1. and 20. and 28. 35. and. 9. 11.
exhorted us unto wisdom, knowledge and understanding, and has promised us
that there we shall find it. And not content heerewith, now he makes us the
same promise, when he says, Understanding is a well spring of life, unto them
that have it. Wherein he shows us that we ought to be very careful and
diligent to read the scriptures, to follow good and true Doctors, to love
their doctrine, and to imprint and grave it in our hearts, that it may there
take such deep rooting, that we may be always seasoned, and may never be
deprived thereof: thus doing we shall find the spring of life, for to guide us
unto immortality. And that this spring may not fail nor dry in us, let us
continewe still drinking of this water, without drunkenness, and let us not
run hither and thither by curiousness, for to hear new things, and which
have great appearance of wisdom: for if we turn back from this
understanding, we can learn nothing but foolishness: forasmuch as, the heart
of fools babbleth out folly: and now he says, Pro. 12. 23.


And the instruction of fools is folly. And as the fools can teach nothing
but folly, even so can they not abide to be instructed, to be exhorted,
admonished, corrected, and reproved by the word of the Lord: but for all
instruction, they desire to hear of pleasant things to the flesh and lusts of
things which have a great outward show of wisdom after the world, of vain
and frivolous things, of foul and slanderous things which are nothing else but
foolishness, the which does so change and dry our souls that they perish,
and run unto eternal death for them. Solomon does give us so to understand,
when against the spring of life, he sets folly: for speaking of life, he
would not have us to stay about this present life, which is common both to al
men and to beasts: but he labors for to make us to aspire unto that blessed
life, which never shall have end. Now since that folly is set against this
spring of life, it follows well that it is no light vanity, wherewith also the
faithful are stained: but because they are truly displeased therewith,
therefore the Lord will not impute it unto them. But folly is a filthiness
which greatly defiles the fools, with the which they are not displeased, but
do take their pleasure therein, and are so sore changed thereinto, that they
perish eternally and as many as do follow them.

23 The heart of the wise guides his mouth wisely, and adds doctrine to his
lips.
For want of having wisdom surely printed in our hearts, we are naturally
inclined to speak at adventure, neither do we make any account to take heed
for to speak well. For this cause if we be reproved for speaking evil, and
that we can not deny it, we excuse ourselves to have spoken it without
thinking to speak it. This excuse should be true, if we did add this word
well: saying that we have spoken evil, without well thinking of that which we
should have said. We cannot speak without thinking: for first of al if we
speak joyfully, it is because we delight therein, and that our heart takes
pleasure so to do: And if we speak angerly or sorowfully, it is because that
we are troubled in our hearts, for the matter whereof we speak. Secondly we
must not belie the infallible truth, the which says, that from the abundance
of Mat. 12. 34.
the heart the mouth speaks. Solomon has well showed us, that some do
speak at adventure and evil also, through want of wisdom, Pro. 10. 8. 13.
14. 20. 21. and 15. 2.
because he has attributed it to the same. He does show us the same now
also, when he says, The heart of the wise guides his mouth wisely. etc. He
says not simply and only the heart, but he adds of the wise: for the heart
alone of it self is nothing worth: whereupon follows that it can do nothing
that is ought worth. It must be reformed by wisdom, for to guide our mouths
well and prudently. If then we be void of wisdom, we cannot speak as we
ought, but where wisdom is, there shall be a good word: as Solomon does
declare the same, when he adds,

And adds doctrine to his lips. That is to say, that the heart of the wise
does teach his lips how they ought to be opened for to speak well: or that the
heart of the wise by his lips teaches other, and gives them doctrine.
These two senses are diverse, but they agree well together: for a wise man also
does them both, and the second is not without the first.

24 Fair words are as an honey comb: sweetenes to the soul, and health to
the bones.
The flesh rejoices and is pleased, when a man is praised and flattered: it
allows well of the words that are uttered: as he thinks none could
speak better to him, nor utter any thing which should please him more, but
how long soever it be, they which listen and give their ears unto such
praises and, flatteringes shall feel that insteede they thought to eat honey,
they have eatengal: and that in steed of drinking some sweet liquor, they
have drunken vinegre: and insteede of having health, they have been taken with
death: As Adam and Eve which believed the serpent, as Roboam which believed his
young counselors, and as the children of Israel which cleaued unto the false
Prophets which preached to them peace, when the Prophets of God did foretell
them the great miseries and calamities that were at hand. Solomon also does
Pro.. 5. 3. 4.
give it us to understand. The Papists also shall feel what the words and
preaching of their Friars are. I have said expressly, that the flesh and
sensuality does well allow of flattering words and not that they are so
indeed. Solomon does well show it, when he does give unto fair words three
titles, which agree with the words of God. The first is, that they are
likened unto the honey comb, the second, that they are sweet unto the soul:
the third that they are health unto the bones. For that which is proper unto
the word of the Lord, cannot agree with the words which come both from the
devil and the flesh: and it were a great blasphemy to attribut unto them such
fayrenes. Now that these titles belong unto the words of God, the Scripture
does show us. The law Psa. 19. 7. and 119. 103. Pro. 4. 20. 21 22.
of the Lord is perfect converting the soul. etc. How sweet are thy promises
unto my mouth! yea more then honey unto my mouth. We will not then say with the
worldlinges, O how well is that spoken, when men talk of matters pleasant to
the flesh: albeit that the words seem to be of God and spoken of devotion
True it is that the gracious and gentle words of friends are very fair, and
are profitable as well to the soul as to the body, when by them we proceed
as God teaches us by his word, and not when some have respect only to
please men, and to win their favor and good will.

25 There is a way that seems right unto man: but the issue thereof are the
ways of death.
As it is not without cause, nor unprofitable, that Solomon repeateth the
sentence word for word, that he set in the fourteenth chapter and twelfth
verse: Even so ought we to be careful to meditate the same, and therein to
behold our corrupt nature, which follows his fantasy and good intent,
turning away from the path that GOD teaches us by his word, also to behold
therein our destruction, that we may labor to avoid it.

26 The person that trauelleth, trauelleth for himself, for his mouth craves
it of him.
There is none except he be impudent, or blockish, which does deny that we
must bear the yoke of the Lord willingly, yet do we al naturally deny it not
by word, but indeed. For God has laid pain, labor, and travel upon our
backs, and yet we love rest, ydlenes, and slouthfulnes: as we are convinced
by our conscience, and the rich worldlinges do show it, when they live after
the pleasure of their flesh, making themselves believe that it is laweful for
them to take their ease, delights and pleasures without applying themselves
too some honest and profitable vocation: for because that they have abundance
of goods, for to live without doing ought, they would think it too vile and
bace a thing for their maistership and worship, to set hand to work, or to
give themselves to some vocation, wherein they might get some money, or serve
their neighbors. All that serve, and are hired either for a year, or from day
to day, and do not their work so carefully and faithfully in the absence of
their Masters, as in their presence, either be it in presence or in absence
do make no account to do their work well, do also show it. And albeit that
diverse, even of those which are not taught in the word of God, be very
earnest and stout at their work, yet is it not to say that they work
willingly, but it is because they love themselves, and desire to gain
something for their profit. Solomon does signify it, saying, The person or
soul that trauaileth, etc. Or, that most commonly, they fear to have nothing
put in their mouths and to eat. The reason that Solomon gives, does show
it, when he says, for his mouth craves it. He shows that it comes not
of a frank and free heart, nor by charity, that they are given to work: but
that they have regard to themselves, and fear to want. And thus Solomon does
not teach us expressly what we have to do: but he does show us what our nature
is, and with what desire it is led, and what we do commonly. And yet we must
not think that he allows us to do that which he pronounces here, except
that in laboring for ourselves we do also take care of our housholdes, and
show compassion on Ephe. 4. 28.
the needy and on the necessity of the poor: and that following the
admonition: let him that stole, steal no more, but let him rather labor, with
his hands the thing that is good, that he may have to give unto him that
needs. He therefore rebukes the slothfulness of our nature, and therewith
does somewhat show us that he which labors not, is worthy to dye for
hunger: as Saint Paul declares, for if any man will not work, let him also not
eat. Some 2. These. 3. 10.
do take here travail for molestation, trouble and punishment: and do
interpret this sentence, as if Solomon did say, The foul of man does forsake
molestation: for his mouth gives him occasion: that Mat. 12. 36. 37.
is to say, That there happens great troubles unto a man that speaks rashly
and without cause. This sense is true, and very agreeable Iam. 1. 26. and 3. 6.
to the scriptures: it agrees also with experience: notwithstanding it is much
constrained: and therefore we will receive the first sense the which does
teach us that we must not be slouthful, but at the lest we should travail
for to avoid poverty, I say, at the least: for that which ought chiefly to
induce us to travail is obedience that we owe unto our Lord, and
consequently the duty that we owe unto our family, and to our poor
neighbors: For God has no need of our travail, nor of the profit that
comes thereof.

27 A wicked man diggeth up evil, and in his lips is like burning fire.
When a man ymagineth evil against his neighbor, that his wicked enterprise
should not be known, and that he should not be let to atchieue the same,
he hydeth himself so much as he can, counterfayting an honest man, or at the
very least dissembling that he would evil to him whom he watches: and yet
in the most deepest and most secret corner of his heart, he looks and
deuiseth by what means he may overthrow and destroy the simple and innocent,
which do think nothing of his trappes that the wicked has prepared, no more
then does the wild beasts think and know that hunters have dug pittes for
to make them to fall into them. Solomon does signify this same, saying,

A wicked man diggeth up evil. He attributes wickedness and ungodliness,
or, as some have, no worthiness to those which divise evil, and conspire to
overthrow the simple and innocent, even God, if it were possible for them: as
are they which brag themselves to be reformed after the Gospel, and say that
they will maintain it: and yet have no religion, and would gladly overthrow
and put down the holy doctrine, and so consequently God, through hatred that
they have conceived against his servants. And whiles that these wicked and
perverse men, dig up evil, laboring to destroy the holy doctrine, and al
order and policy, and to bring al to confusion, if we rebuke them, then they
cry that they are honest men, and are ready to make them repent which say the
contrary, in miscalling and reuiling them, or under color of justice causing
them to make amends by restoring their good name. In these cryings and manner
of doings they belly the holy Ghost, who by the mouth of Solomon calls them
men of no estimation, and perverse. But finally they shall be proved liars with
effect, which they shall not help: for they shall receive their reward with
their father and their God the Devil, who is the father of lies, and a
murderer from the beginning, whom they follow: for no thank to them that the
children of God be not murdered. Now albeit that sometimes, and for a while
such kind of people of no valor and wicked do secretly devise in their
hearts, or with their like in their dens of thieves, or on their alebenche:
yet they cannot always hold out, but that at the last, by gestures,
countenances, manners of doings and words, they will declare their cruelty,
and show that they ask nothing but al destruction and desolation. Solomon
does signify it, when he says, That in his lips is like burning fire.
Their hearts are so full of wicked ymaginations and enterprises, that they must
needs spue out as drunkardes which have drunk too much wine, even til they
burst. They cannot keep themselves back from committing of haynouse and cruel
acts against those which cannot revenge themselves, and to blow out
threatenings against them which desire nothing but their good, and tell lies,
and utter slaunderings, reuilings and shameful things against them which follow
truth and are vnreprehensible before men. Solomon compares these acts and
words unto a burning fire: for as the fire consumes all that it meets with,
except it be quenched: even so men of no account, wicked and perverse, would
spoil and destroy by their power and violences, by their lies and
slaunderings, by their injuries and reuilings, the good and innocent, if God
did not bridle them: so that they work not such desolation as they would, but
such as GOD suffers them. The wicked do vex and torment themselves greatly
for to hurt other: as they well know, and as also the worldlings do confess
it: for they say they take more pain to do evil then to do well. Solomon also
signifies their great travail, when he says,

That they dig, up, and that there is a burning fire in their mouths. And
thus they are very miserable and woeful, when they devise evil for their
neighbors. But if they remain hardened and obstinate, and that they will not
convert from their wicked ways, they shall be yet much more woeful: for they
shall be made void of their intentes, and the evil that they devise to do
unto others shall fall upon themselves: as Caine, Pharao, Saul, Absalom, Judas
and other wicked do now feel it: and the scripture does witness it,
Behold, he trauaileth with mischief, he has conceived sorrow, and brought
forth ungodliness: he has graven and dug up a pit and is fallen himself
into the destruction that he made for other. For his travail shall come upon
his own Psalm. 7. 15. and 9. 16.
head, etc. If we see this daily come to pass in the world, God is
righteous, and though he be slow, yet the wicked, obstinate and hardharted shall
not escape his hands.

28 A froward person sows strife: and a taleteller makes division among
Princes.
If we be not mad and furious, we do rather love peace and unity, then
dissension and war: wherefore we have need to seek the means of peace,
and to maintain it and to fly those of war, and to abhor them. But there
are some people so evil complexioned, and so filled with malice, that they
would have men to think of them that they desire nothing but peace, whereas
they tend to fill the world with braules and dissentions: for wheresoever they
become, they labor to overthrow al good order, al good counsel, and lawful
deliberations and ordinances, al good agreements, and loving pactions. Solomon
calls such malicious men, froward persons: or persons of peruersities: and
not of peruersity alone in the singular number: for they are not content to
have once brought some disorder, trouble or confusion, but they persevere in
exercising their peruersities, by the which they stir up dissentions, not in
one place only, but as he which sows, does not only sow one or two
grains, but does cast al over the ground that he has plowed, and does
cover it throughout from one end to the other, even so the froward do raise up
diverse dissentions, and no thank to the^, that they fill not the world.
Solomon does signify this same, when he says, That a person of
frowardnesses, sows strife. And for to declare unto us, of what peruersities,
and of what strifes he chiefly means to speak, he adds, And a taleteller
makes division among Princes. By a froward person, or man of perverseness,
he means liars, flatterers, sclaunderers, and house burners, which cease not
to blow into the ears of princes, for to encourage them against other princes,
their neighbors, and to make wars against them, whereas before they were
quiet, and united together: and by strife he means, the enimities, the
hatreds, the troubles, and the wars which are stirred up by the false tales
of such perverse men. Wherein he teaches unto princes of the earth, not to
have ytching ears, and that they should not be easy nor inclined to hear
tale tellers, but that rather they should hunt them away, yea root them out
as seditious and rebels, and disturbers of the common wealth, and of common
peace. Therefore let princes take heed to follow the wisdom that David does
show them saying, I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I hate the
work of them that Psalm. 101. ^.
fall away. etc. Secondly, he teaches us that we should be careful too bridle
our tongues, as also Saint James does admonish us, saying, Let every man be
swift to hear, and slow to speak. etc. Again, if any man think himself
religious among you, and refrayneth not Iam. 1. 19. 2^.
his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
Thirdly forasmuch as we love, or should love peace, therefore so much as in us
lies we should be at peace with all men. Further Solomon does admonish us
that we should not be froward nor tale tellers, according to the defense. Thou
shall not go about Leui. 19. 2^.
amongst thy people as a backbiter.

29 A wicked man deceives his neighbor, and leads him into the way that is
not good.
If we will keep ourselves from being deceived and seduced, let us not
indifferently follow al companies: let us take heed of sinners. And to do
this well, let us apply our ears unto wisdom, Pro. 1. 10. and 2. 2. 10. and
5. 1.
for when wisdom shall be entered into thy heart, then shall discretion
preserve thee. etc. Also he has admonished us to hearken unto wisdom, for to
keep us from the strange woman. etc. Now him that Solomon has before called,
sinner, wicked, a stranger, now he calls him man of iniquity, or man of
violence: that is too say, which without doubt of conscience does hurt unto
his neighbors, and makes as it were profession thereof, for to induce others
to do the like. Solomon says, that such a man, seduceth or deceives his
neighbor: and afterward he shows what the deceit is, when he says, and
leads him into the way which is not good. Wherein we see that he speaks
not of any light deceit, as to deceive his neighbor in drawing subtly his
goods unto him, his labor and his pain, even as they are wont to do which
desire to make their particular profit by the hurt of other: and for to do
this, they use craftines and subtlety, that we may take heed of them: but he
speaks of a deceit greatly hurtful, seeing it draws souls unto perdition:
for they must needs perish which walk not in a good and safe way. The other
deceit in comparison of this same is but light for those which suffer it: for
it is nothing but a temporal matter, which is nothing to the soul: albeeit
that they which use it, shall not find it light: for they do it with the loss
of their souls, seeing they are covetous, usurers, thieves and robbers: but
they which lead men into the way which is not good, are murderers not only of
the bodies, but also of souls: whereupon does follow that the deceit that they
use shall be very hurtful unto them: for no murderer has eternal life dwelling
in him. Wherefore we may understand 1. John. 3. 15
that almost all the world goes unto damnation: for it is full of men of
iniquity, which deceive some after one sort, and some after another, in
example of life and conversation, and in words and doctrine.

30 He shuts his eyes to devise wickedness, he moves his lips, and
brings evil to pass.
He continues still in speaking of the wicked, ungodly, and froward, of whom
he has spoken in the three last sentences: and that we should be more careful
and watchful to take heed and beware of them, he does attribute unto them
certain disguisings, which they use when they ymagine evil, and that they
labor to accomplish it. Solomon does signify it, By shutting his eyes, and
moving of the lips. And this is very fitly, for when the wicked do ymagine
evil, they will make as though they saw them not against whom they intend
mischief: or for better to betray them, they will not look upon them with open
eyes, showing them that they are their open enemies, but will show them a
smiling countenance, with lyering eyes. Even so the wicked which would take
their neighbors a^ unawares, for to hurt them, without being able to keep and
save themselves, they will not cry out with a loud voice, saying, It is you
whom we malice: but for to deceive better, they will speak sweetly, as it
were with a fained voice, and will not but half open their mouths. Likewise
Solomon has not said, he opens: but he moves his lips. Let us also
understand that under these two signs Solomon comprehends al gestures and
manner of doings which the wicked use for to counterfaite, that they may
deceive and hurt more easily: for he has studied to give us short sentences
in words, but yet great in understanding. They which have any doings with the
wicked, which feign and counterfaite, do feel that they do not only close and
shut their eyes, and that they do not only move their lips, but that they
have as it were an innumerable ways of doing by the which they feign for to
hurt openly. The Devil is a subtle Doctor: and as he has diverse knackes in his
budget, even so does he teach them unto his disciples for to make the^
masters of art. Among the which they are not the worst which seek our goods,
and take away our good name, and hurt our bodies: but they are the worst which
lie in wait to destroy our souls.

31 Age is a crown of glory, when it is found in the way of righteousness.
Albeit that men naturally desire to live long in a flourishing state, of mean
age, and to continue still in the same power and strength, as we may know by old
men, who lament their youth past, and gladly would that the youth had ten or
twenty of their years: and have no pleasure to think nor to hear speaking
that they are old, except it be that for their age they think that they shall
obtain some office, above and before the youth: yet for all this there is none
but does desire to attain unto a very old age: the which desire is not to
be blamed, so that it is not for fear of death, nor for doubt of what
shalbecome of us after this life, as do the infidels and faithless: but let
our desire behold the promise that GOD Deuteronomy. 4. 4^. and 5. 33. and 30. 16.
has made unto them which shall obey his word: to wit, of prolonging their
days upon earth. Likewise when a man has lived past seventy or four score
years, he boasts often of his old age, and does rejoice therein, and he
looks that some should reverence him, as a thing very honorable: even as at
al times, and amongst al peoples, it has been, except toward wanton and
shameless youths. For it is a natural and very reasonable thing, that folks
should honor their elders: and also God does command Leui. 19. 32.
it. Now well to obey this commandment, the youths must behave themselves
toward their elders, as children ought to behave themselves toward their
fathers and mothers, and chiefly to follow their counsel, so far as they
labor to lead us according as GOD teaches them by his word: otherwise age
is no crown of honor: even as Solomon does signify, when he adds, When
it is found in the way of righteousness. It is not age then which makes the
old man to be crowned with glory: as they which were destroyed by the flood,
have well showed, and they of Sodom and Gomor, and other old doaters filled
with foolishness, ignorance and iniquity: but it is wisdom which makes the
crown glorious. Therefore if we will be honorably crowned for our age, let us
not ask to be praised for our great age, but let us follow that rightly which
God requires of us, every one of us according to the state wherein God has
called us. Thus doing, though we be no old men, yet shall we have age which
shall be a crown of glory unto us. The scripture also speaking of the Elders,
has not respect to the age, but to their duty and office, neither is it
required that a man should be old in years for to bear office, but in
manners. And forasmuch as the aged ought to be of more experience and more
wise, that rightly they may govern others, therefore for this they which bear
office either in the common wealth or in the Church, are called Elders: and
although they be young, yet if they behave themselves as they ought, they have
age which is to them a crown of glory. Thus age does not make men honorable
and glorious, but righteousness.

32 He that is slow to anger, is better then the mighty man: and he that rules
his own mind, is better then he that wins a City.
The mighty, or rather the hasty and furious, are esteemed very excellent, and
win great fame in the world: as we see, and also the holy scripture does give
us examples thereof. At this time were the giants Gene. 6. 4. and 10. 8. 91.
dwelling on earth, Those were the mighty ones which in all ages have bin men of
fame, Nemrod became mighty on earth, etc. And as such mighty men are
esteemed, even so do they also make account of themselves, and think they do
profit, and that they are not cowards, but have a courageous heart, because
they suffer none to devour them, but can soon devour others. Notwithstanding
they which proceed with all gentleness, humanity, lenity, modesty and
clemency, and which suffer with all patience that rather other should do them
injury, wrong and violence then to hurt any person, are counted dizzards,
cowards, and nothing worth, unworthy once to talk with men of honesty, and
worthy to be despised and rejected of al honest men, which will suffer at no
man's hand any molestation. This is the judgment of the world: that is to say,
of al those which are not made new creatures by the regeneration and
sanctification of the holy Ghost. But they which are lightened, sanctified and
regenerated, do judge otherwise, and pronounce with Solomon, he that is slow
to anger, is better then the mighty. Here Solomon does first set and prefer
the slow to anger, before him that is mighty: not for to condemn the strong
and mighty, except that through their force they take leave to do injury and
outrage to their neighbors without cause: the which cannot be done without
anger, hatred, wrath and fury. And it is in this only point that the mighty
ought to be condemned, for strength is the gift of God, wherewith diverse of the
elect and children of God have bin endued, and have used the same in anger and
wrath against the enemies of God, and his people: as Moses, Joshua, and other
governors of the people of Israel: and as all the judges and mighty rulers
ought to use against the^ which do evil. We will then with Solomon prefer the
slow to anger, before him that is mighty, because that he is of great wisdom,
whereby he can temperate his passions, and patiently bear the injuries and
outrages that are done to him, as he knows to be expedient: the which is no
small virtue: seeing that Exo. 34. 6. Psa. 103. ^. Esa. 55. 7. Romans 2. 4.
in the same he is a follower of his God, of whom the scripture witnesses that
he is a God of pity, of clemency, and slow to wrath, etc. And as it is not
for want of might that God is thus patient, as he can and could well show
taking vengeance of his enemies in convenient time: even so God does not take
force for him that is slow to wrath, but that he may overcome his enemies,
when the time is come: whereas the mighty for his arrogancy is often deprived
of his enterprises, and his violence lights upon himself by the just
punishment of God. Lo this is the first cause why we esteem the slow to
anger better then the mighty. Secondly, as the mighty which presumes on his
strength, does greatly hurt his neighbors by moving strife: even so
contrarily, the slow to anger does profit his neighbors, setting them at
peace. Consequently, Prou. 15. 18.
Solomon opposing and preferring him that rules his own mind unto him that
wins a city. He does somewhat expound what he means by the slow to
anger and by the mighty: that is to say, that he is slow to anger that
suffers not himself to be transported of his carnal affections, and humane
and natural passions which provoke him to anger and wrath, unto indignation
and fury, to violence outrage and vengeance, but does rather subdue, tame and
hold in subjection, and mortify them. It is not without cause that Solomon
sets such a personage against him which conquereth towns: For he does no
outrage, violence nor hurt, but only to his vicious and corrupted nature, he
makes no war but with himself, that is, that his flesh or sensuality,
which lusts against the Spirit, should not obtain his desires and
affections: But he that takes towns, does oftentimes make great destruction
and desolation. He that rules his mind quenches a great fire: For
naturally we are al kindled, with wrath, with anger, and with desire of
vengeance: but he that wins cities, mainteineth his fire and kindles it
more and more, and by it he lights another, burning castles and villages,
yea cities and towns also. He that rules his mind is ready to do good
unto them which trouble him without cause: But he that wins towns, does
wrong, and injury, outrage and violence, unto innocents.

Now in these causes of comparison, we see plainly that Solomon does rightly
more commend him that rules his courage, the^ him that takes and wins
towns and cities. But besides these same we may add, that he which wins
cities, does suffer himself to be carried away of his passions and carnal
affections, the which rule in him, and is not master over them. The contrary
is in him which rules his courage, as has been declared. Furthermore Iam. 3.
6.
in the tongue is a fire, yea even a world of wickedness: and in the tongue
there is no evil, but that it comes of the mind: therefore it follows, that
he which rules his mind, is more valiant the^ he which wins cities and
towns: for he rules and conquereth a world.

33 The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposition thereof is of the
Lord.
For to part or to make choice of any thing, is when men use too cast the
chance or lot, for to know what part they shall have, or who shall be chosen.
And it is not come up of late, that this manner of doing is used, but from al
antiquity, and even by the commandment of God among the children of Israel:
the which commandment they followed. And the Apostles also used too cast
lottes, Leuit. 16. 8. Number. 33. 54 Iosu. 14. and 15 Acts. 1. 26. Leui. 19. 31.
and 20. 6. Deuteronomy. 18. 10
Whereupon follows, that it is laweful to use lotterie, so that there be no
inchauntmentes, forceries and art magic and devilish practices, mingled
therewith: which are abominable before the Lord. And in using of lottes for
the partitio^ or election, we must take heed of the false and wicked opinion of
infidels, which attribute unto fortune and chance, that which happens, and
comes to them by lot. For contrarily we must attribute to the counsel and
providence of GOD, whatsoever we obtain by lot, be it much be it little, be
it good, be it evil, be it that it pleases or displeases us. Solomon does
teach us this same, when he says, But the whole disposition thereof, is of
the Lord. Wherefore let us be ready to give thanks unto the Lord for all
things that we obtain, eue^ those things which seem well to be very casual and
set forth to fortune and chance: as are those which happen by lot, for the
worldlings casting into the lotterie, are wont to say, come what may come.
Likewise shall the children of God, if they take not heed and beware. We must
be assured that howesoeuer the lot be cast, that nothing can happen but by
the providence of God, and that that must needs come to pass without changing,
which God has purposed and ordained in his eternal counsel. It is therefore
good reason that we commit al our affairs unto him, beseeching him to guide
them according to his good will, and that we content ourselves with that which
shall happen to us, and give him thanks and praises therefore. Let us then
acknowledge and confess that whatsoever comes to us by lot, the same is the
gift of God, upon such condition that we should be faithful stewardes
thereof. And though the lotteries be lawful in hard matters, yet thelesse that
they are used the better it is.

The xvii. Chapter.
1 BEtter is a dry morsel, if peace be with it, then an house full of sacrifices
with strife.
WHen according to the law that God ordained by Moses, they did sacrifice, and
offered their oblations, the people did eat of the sacrifice, and therein
neither the Leuite, stranger, Leui. 23. 40. Deuteronomy. 12. 7. and 14. 23.
fatherless child, nor widow ought to be put by and left out. In such
assemblies they made good cheer, they eat and drank enough and were filled:
yet is it not to say, that such feasts were the best refreshing that they
could enjoy: for the goodness of the banquet or feast did not stand in the
abundance of meats, neither in the delicate and fine dressing thereof. Solomon
does so show it. Therefore if we will feed at a good banquet, let the meats be
seasoned with friendship and love: let both the host or Pro. 15. 17.
master of the feast and the guest or friend, be good friends and lovers
together, let there be peace between them without any strife. Solomon does
signify it now again, when he says, Better is a dry morsel, if peace be
with it, then an housefull of sacrifices. by the dry morsel, he means a
dinner that asks not much cost for to dress, and in the which we live
soberly without excess: If they which together at such a banquet are friends
and lovers together, their meal is better then are those bankettes, wherein is
strife and debate, yea though that GOD has ordained such bankets: as Solomon
does well signify, when he does call them Sacrifices, wherewith the temple
was filled, the which is signified by the house full of Sacrifices with strife.
Strife and debate do then defile that which God has ordained for his service,
and for the use and joy of men, and for to lead them to sing him praises, and
to give him thanks. Wherefore let us understand that Solomon does commend
peace unto us, and would have us to fly strife, for to live easily, quietly,
and pleasantly, and chiefly according too our mind. The fine mouths, gluttons
and drunkardes cannot easily agree with Solomon, but rather will mock him.

2 A discrete servant shall have rule over a lewd son, and he shall divide
the beritage among the brethren.
The greatest part of the youth do think that they ought to do nothing else
but play, and take their ease and pleasures, and chiefly when they have rich
fathers, and are served and obeyed by their servants and household folks, and
also they think that they should be served as well as the master of the house,
and are not long in wasting the goods that their fathers and mothers, the
servants and household folks have gathered with pain and labor, with great
care and diligence, and labor to rule and govern, and to be feared and
reverenced.

Now in this manner they magnify them, and extol themselves, and do promise
to themselves great riches: but very often they fall very low, and are
suppressed and humbled, and also are deprived of their hope: for they do not
obtain the goods that they promise themselves, but others do take them, at
the least a good part of them. Solomon does show it us, saying, A discrete
servant shall have rule over a lewd son: and he shall divide the
inheritance among the brethren. Here Solomon does well show that God
suppresseth and humbles the proud younglinges even to make them subject unto
the most miserable after the world, and to those which should be their servants
and slaves: for these servants of whom Solomon speaks, were of such
condition, that they were bought and sold as beasts, and were so compelled to
labor for those which had bought them, that they and their children, and
whatsoever they did get, did appertain and belong unto their masters, and
unto their posterity and lineage. Solomon does not speak this without
experience: as he does witness, I have seen servants on horses, and
princes walking as servants on the ground. This Eccle. 10. 7. Genesis 14.
was seen in Joseph the son of Jacob.

Now although that such servants, before the world, were miserable, vile and
abject, yet there were some of them which were not discouraged, but with good
will and right affection endeavored what they could to please their masters: as
they are exhorted chiefly. And even so must al they which serve for wages and
reward do the like for the time that they serve and are hired: for they are,
after a manner of saying, as it were bought for a time, and are bound to yield
subjection and obedience. Whereunto if they be given Ephe. 6. 5 Col. 3. 22. 1.
Tim. 6. 1 Titus. 2. 9 1. Pet. 2. 18.
carefully and faithfully, they are wise and discrete servants, and by their
prudence they shall be exalted, as out of the mire and dust unto honor and
glory, even above the children of the house, which bring confusion: that is to
say, which by their folly, falling away, and dissolution, do set al in
disorder, in making superfluous and excessive expenses. We may see this
government and ruling even in this world: but it shall be seen plainly in the
last resurrection, when the sheep shall be received before the goats: for let
us not think that Solomon would have us only to seek worldly and temporal
honor. True it is, that he speaks of a temporal ruling whereat the children
of God ought not to be stayed, but hope for the eternal, wherein they shall
truly govern over the lewd children. For they shall as it were tread them
under their feet, when they shall be exalted unto the heavenly kingdom, and the
lewd children shall discende down into hell and death eternal. And when Solomon
says, that the discrete servant shall divide the heritage, etc. He shows
that God can well tell how to deprive the lewd children of their hope, and to
work that they shall not enjoy the heritage. And therewith he also promises
temporal wealth unto slaves: and in this, he would assure us, that although we
be the most miserable in the world to the sense of the flesh and outward
fight, yet shall we not want riches: but if need be, GOD shall make us equal
in wealth, with the most richest. This same is well signified by dividing the
heritage with the brethren: for after the Hebrew expositors, to divide the
heritage among brethren, is to take a portion of goods with those which are
brethren, and to whom after the world goods do appertain. But when we
hearesuch temporal promises, let us understand that God will not satisfy his
discrete and wise servants, with riches which are common to fools: and
therefore, let them be assured that the heavenly and eternal riches are
theirs, and that they shall have the possession of them by continuing in
prudence and wisdom. Solomon has showed us the same plainly. Contrarily, if
God threaten the foolish and lewd, Pro. 3. 13. and 4. 5.
to deprive them of their worldly wealth and honor: and make no account to
amend themselves, we must understand that he counts them not worthy of
the heavenly glory, and eternal blessedness.

3 As is the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold: so the Lord
tries the hearts.
Saint Peter does admonish us, saying, Dearly belooued, think it not
strange concerning the fiery trial, which is among you, 1. Pet. 4. 12.
to prove you, as though some strange thing thing were come unto you. This
trial ought in no wise to be given unto fortune. And though the Devils and men
be organes and instruments for too trouble and torment us, yet they do not
prove us, but it is God Job. 1. Exo. 20. 20. Job. 7. 18. Psalm. 26. 2. and 66.
10 and 139. 1
that does it: As the Scripture shows it. Solomon following the same, says,

As is the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold: etc. Wherein we have
to note, forasmuch as the trial of God is compared unto the fining pot and
furnace, that therefore it follows, that god tries our hearts by tribulation
and afflictions, by miseries and calamities: and that sometimes for one cause,
and sometimes for another. For as by the Furnace, sometimes gold is purged and
purified from his scumme, and from his filthiness, and sometimes we try
whether it be good, fine and lawful: even so God also does try our hearts in
sending to us afflictions, for to purify them: for by temptations we are
admonished to confess our faults, and to ask pardon: and thus we are purged
from our scumme and filthiness. The Scripture does show us that diverse
saints being under affliction, have confessed their faults, and have asked
forgiveness, Number. 21. 7 1. Sam. 7. 5 and 12. 10. Psalm. 106. 6 Esaias. 59. 12.
and 64. 5 Dan. 9. 5. Genesis 22. 1 Deuteronomy. 8. 2. Psalm. 26. 2. and. 66. 9 and 139. 23.
and also for those of their neighbors. Otherwise by afflictions and
adversities, GOD tries our hearts, for too prove their righteousness and
perfectness, or to show forth their wickedness and ungodliness. After this
sort GOD tried Abraham, commanding him to sacrifice his son. He has also
proved the children of Israel. Wherefore this sentence may serve to teach us
patiently to bear the afflictions that we may suffer, knowing that it is God
which lays them upon us, for to purge and too cleanse us, and to make us
wise and very discrete to walk uprightly: the which are two blessings greatly
to be desired. As also David does well show it when he requires to be
tried, and when he would have men to praise the Lord. And adding the reason,
he says, O God thou have proved: thou have also tried us, like as silver is
tried. Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my heart: Prove me, and
examine my thoughts. Saint James also says, Blessed is the man which indureth
temptation: for when he has been tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
Iam. 1. 2.
which GOD has promised unto those which love him. And when the Apostle Saint
Peter says, That the proving of your faith, being much more precious then
gold that perishes (though it be tried with fire) might be found unto your
praise, and honor and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Therefore let
us willingly receive the admonition of the Apostle: My son, despise not the
chastening of the Lord, neither fainte when thou art rebuked of him. For whom
the Lord loves, he Heb. 12. 5. 6.
chasteneth: and he scourges every son which he receives. We may learn
this out thereof also, that we can neither do, say, nor think any thing that
GOD sees not better then we ourselves: as has been showed by the scripture.

4 The wicked gives heed to false lips: and a liar hearkeneth to the
naughty tongue.
All men are ready and inclined naturally to hearken unto them which speak
wickedly of other. Some are so delighted therewith, that they think that they
are well thought of therefore, and persuade themselves that they are such, and
do turn the rebuke that is given to their neighbors unto their own praise
and good commendation. Wherein they are deceived: as Solomon does show,
attributing unto them wickedness,, the which in this place is very fit and
meet, chiefly to Princes and Lords of the earth who worship themselves in
their lordships, power and authority, and require for to be worshipped. And
as they delight to hear wickedness spoken, as lying, slaundering, and false
witness bearing for to help forwards the destruction of their neighbors:
even so they themselves are liars: as Solomon does pronounce, saying, And a
liar hearkeneth to the naughty tongue, or tongue of destruction. Here he
calls him a liar, whom before he has called wicked or naughty. Wherein he
shows of what naughtiness or wickedness he speaks: that is to say, of
lying. And thus he accuses the wicked not only to give ear unto them which
lie wickedly, but also that he himself lies: the which is no wonder: for
every man gladly reuerencech his like. We may see that the princes of the
world do love well to lie, they are no niggardes of their promises: but they
perform little or put nothing in execution, and do delight in making them
fair and goodly (as is said) not only in light things: but where by their
leasinges men suffer most, there do they laugh most of all. We do also often
see come to pass that the strifes of Princes do bring great destruction.
There are some which are no Princes, and yet labor to do the like: so that on
what side soever we turn us, we meet with none but liars: so full is the
world of them. And therefore it is not without cause that David lamenteth. And
even of the people of God, it is said, It is a people provoking to wrath.
Lying children, Psa. 5. 10. and 12. 2. 3. Esaias. 30. 9 and 57. 4.
children which will not hear the Law of their GOD. On whom have ye iested?
Upon whom have ye gaped, and thruste out your tongues? Are not ye rebellious
children, and a false seed? And they bend their tongues like their bows for
lies, etc. He also calls destruction or naughty, that which before Iere. 8.
6. and 9. 2.
he had called wicked. Wherein he shows that the liars, false witnesses,
slaunderers and flatterers, are dangerous, and greatly hurtful: as also
experience teaches: for by their tales they do stir up anger, malice,
striefes, seditions, wars, whereby diverse houses and families, even towns
and regions do come unto destruction.

But the worst destroyers, are those which set forth diuelishe doctrine and
men's traditions, in steed of the pure doctrine, or else do mingle them one
with another, coloring the truth: for the destruction that they make is not
of any temporal goods and bodies, but they loose the souls and bodies for
ever. And albeit that it is by deceit, trappes and under color of religion,
yet they which are deceived: cease not to be guilty: as Solomon does
signify, when he calls them liars which hearken unto the naughty tongue, or
tongue of destruction: and the Apostle S, Paul does 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. 10
show it.

Furthermore let us note, that in this place to hearken and to give ear, is
not to hear as passing by: for otherwise we must attribute wickedness and
lying, unto those which are regenerate and sanctified by the Spirit of GOD:
seeing they often hear lips which speak iniquity, and tongues which work
destruction, for the which cause they are afflicted, seeing that GOD is therein
offended, and that their neighbors have hurt thereby also: and therefore they
do reprove them sharply: but to hearken and to give earo, is to hearken with
the heart and mind, and therein to delight. If then we will not be called
neither wicked, nor liars, let us delight to hear the truth, the which is
exempted from al wickedness, and tends not to destruction, but to
conservation and righteousness.

5 He that mocketh the poor, reprocheth him that made him: and he that
reioyeeth at destruction, shall not be unpunished.
All the world boasts to honor God, and persuade themselves that they would
in no wise displease him: for there is no motion so barbarous, nor so
superstitious, and idolatrous, yea so corrupted and dissolute, so passing
measure and intemperate, which has not some kind of doing, by the which men
think to serve God, yea every man particularly labors to govern himself in
such sort that none may think of him but that he seeks the honor of God,
at the least wise, he labors to persuade himself he does so. And yet we
despise the stranger, the fatherles, the widow and other needy and poor,
yea, they are wronged and oppressed against the express ordinance of God, who
has commanded, Thou shall not do injury to a stranger, neither oppress him,
Exo. 22. 21. 22. Leui. 19. 33. 35.
for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. Ye shall not trouble any widow,
nor fatherles child. Thus doing we do mock the poor, with a mockage that is
not light for to offend a man smally, but to do God great dishonor. Solomon
does signify it, saying, He that mocketh the poor, reprocheth him that made
him, etc. Forasmuch as there is none but God that inricheth and makes men
poor, it follows, that we do reproach him when we mock the poor, in not
helping him as they ought, and in doing him wrong, and in persecuting him, for
he is despised for his poverty, and troubled therefore: and therefore it is
even as much as if we did reproach God for setting such a man to be mocked,
troubled, and molested, and that if they do him injury out of the which he
can not deliver himself, that he is the cause thereof. This same is but to
too common in popery: albeeit that they persuade themselves that they would
do no such injury unto God: but the effect does show the contrary, when we
make no account of the poor, in comparison of Images and ceremonies: even when
for to maintain them we will polle the poor: and would to GOD that they
which boast themselves to be reformed after the Gospel were not given unto
such mockery, or rather worse. But what? For to maintain themselves at their
ease and pleasure, to win credit and authority, they will use cruelty
toward the poor, or at the least will make themselves companions of those
which do oppress them, and will as it were hold up their chinne, and make
them more bold. All such kind of people do take their pastime and joy, so to
handle the poor, for to destroy them: for the which they shall not escape
unpunished. Solomon does declare it, saying,

And he that rejoices, etc. He calls the trouble, vexation, damage and
detriment, the spoiling and desolation which the poor do suffer, destruction,
because they are void of humane help, and are tormented and molested, and no
man helping nor succouring them as they ought, but contrarily, they have not so
little but they will have it. This violence may well be called destruction, when
they which do it, care not what misery and desolation they bring upon the
poor, and would rather put them to death, then to fail of eating them, even
to make them to beg their bread. And therefore the Scripture calls them
murderers and menslears. And so they well deserve punishment: as also the
threateninges are contained in diverse places, as we may Esai. 1. 21. Osee. 4.
1. 2 Psalm. 94. 3. Zach. 11. 4. 5 1. Ioh. 3. 15. Romans 12. 15 1. Cor. 12. 26.
Mat. 9. 13. Pro. 14. 31. Mat. 25. 40.
see by the Scriptures, God has executed them also. And forasmuch as there is
none of sound judgment which would be counted a mocker, nor contemner of
God, nor destroyer of the poor, nor that would have God to punish him, we must
weep with those which weep, that we may have compassion of our poor members
which suffer, showing mercy by unfeigned charity to the needy: I will have
mercy and not sacrifice. Thus doing we honor God. For the good that we do
toward the poor, is counted to be done unto God.

6 Childrens children are the crown of the elders: and the glory of the
children are their fathers.
Forasmuch as God blessing man, said unto him, grow and increase, Gene. 1.
28. and 19. 1. 7. and 13. 16. and 17. 2.
and replenishe the earth: and to Noe, and to Abraham, and to other holy
Patriarchs: Therefore old men ought well to rejoice, and count themselves
happy, and to count it for a great honor and beautifying, when they have a
great stock and lineage, and that they may see themselves to be Grandfathers.
David Psalm. 128. 1
shows well this same: and Solomon having regard unto such promises, says,
Childrens, children, etc. If we have then a multitude of children and cousins,
let us confess it with joy and gladness that God has blessed us, and
honored us: and let us not resemble the worldly and covetous infidels, which
complain to be charged with too many children, when they have more then they
do desire, where they ought to rejoice, and thank God, who does communicate
unto them the title of Father, the which belongs Mat. 13. 9.
unto him only. Let us not also be like unto them which do so dote over their
children, that they suffer them to run at randon, and where they list, and
do not teach them the fear of the Lord, and neither do correct and rebuke
them for fear that they should trouble them. Such kind of people, so much
as in them lies, do despise their Crown: for they take the way for to be
troubled and dishonored for their children: seeing it is a daily and common
thing that the children which are not corrected, wax corrupted, and give
themselves unto dishonest and wicked living. Therefore for to Ephe. 6. 4.
Collo. 3. 21. Genesis 18. 19
be crowned honestly with our children, let us follow Saint Paul's teaching:
Fathers, provoke not your children unto anger: but bring them up in
instruction, etc. Be ye the folowers of Abraham, to who^ God gives witness that
he would command his sons and his household after him, that they keep the
way of the Lord, and to do righteousness and judgment. And although it is a
common matter as well unto the children and elect of God, as also to the children
of the Devil and reprobate, to have great posterity, and that ordinarily the
infidels have more children then the faithful, and that God suffers them to
increase: yet the mind of Solomon is not to give the Crown unto the faithful,
but only to the believers: for what he says, is spoken according to the
former promises, the which are not sure and steadfast but unto the faithful, who
do acknowledge the honor that God does unto them, when he gives them
children abundantly. And because they are not unthankful toward God, he
does give them a continual joy, the which shall never be taken from them: but
it shall rather grow unto an eternal blessing, wherein they shall obtain the
crown of immortal glory: for God does not corporally crown his, for
afterward to make no account of them: otherwise their state should be no
better then the same of the infidels: for they rejoice and are glad, and count
themselves blessed to see themselves fathers of a great stock and kindred:
but such joy is not of any continuance, considering the tears, and gnashing
of teeth, which shall follow it. Now that it is the intent of Solomon to give
the Crown unto the elect of God, he does somewhat show it, when he adds,
And the glory of the children are their Fathers. For since he conferreth the
glory and honor of the children with the crown of the Elders, it follows
well, that his mind is to attribute the crown unto the faithful Fathers: for
the children are not honored by infidels fathers, but Psa. 95. and 106. 6. 7.
Esaias. 43. 27. and. 65. 7. Iere. 2. 5. 6. Exe. 2. 3. and 16. 3. Mat. 23. 30.
rather dishonored: and chiefly when they follow the way of their fathers: for
their fathers faults and iniquities are laid to their charge by the Prophets,
saying, they are like their fathers. The Scripture is full of such reproaches.
And if the children have had good fathers, and that they be wicked, their
fathers also are not honored by the^, John the 8 Chapter, 37. verse.

7 High talk becomes not a fool, much less a lying talk a Prince.
There is none so foolish in the world, but persuadeth himself that when he
speaks, none could speak any thing better: and the most foolish do think
they speak goldenly (after a kind of speaking,) and yet they neither say,
neither can, or they will not speak any thing worth, nor wherein they which
are truly wise, may be delighted therewith. Solomon does signify this same,
saying,

High talk, or the lip of excellency, etc. The fool can not have the lip
of excellency: and therefore let us understand that Solomon does not speak
of that which the fool has, but of that which he thinks to have, or that
would that other should give it him. Now forasmuch as there is no word of
excellency, but the pure truth, it follows therefore, that by the lip of
excellency, Solomon understands the mouth which speaks agreeably and
accordingly unto the word of God. He shewerh this same, when against the lip
of excellency, he sets a lying lip, or lying talk: saying,

Much less, etc. For the contrary of lying, is truth. Herein he shows
that the fool has nothing more proper to him then lying, and that he is so
filled therewith, that truth cannot agree with him, neither can he delight in
it, but does hate it. For the foolish whereof Solomon speaks are the
children of the Devil, John. 8. 44.
who is the father of lying. They are like unto him of whom David speaks in
his 52. Psalm and 4. verse. He shows also unto kings and Princes of the
earth that they ought not to be fools to speak leasing, in perverting of
judgment, in making wicked laws, and pronounce unrighteous sentences against
the truth, right and equity: for seeing that they do not exercise the
judgment of men, but of God, and that the scripture calls them Gods, God is
truth, therefore they ought to understand that it is more indecent for 2.
Chro. 10. 6 Psalm. 82. 16.
them to pronounce and to do any false matter, then it is for the foolish and
wicked to counterfaite honest and wise men. Notwithstanding if the world be
replenished with those which sit in the thrones of Kings, and judicial seats,
which commit either indeed or in word great falsnesse: in such wise that we
may almost Psalm. 82. 2. Esaias. 1. 23. Iere. 5. 26. Za. 7. 9.
complain of al superiors and governors, and say to them, how long will ye
give wrong judgment: and accept the persons of the ungodly? And so there are
but a few which are worthy of such seats, but rather to be placed in the
order of fools. Wherefore they ought to look for an horrible and fearful
vengeance. If they Psa. 2. 4. 5. Esaias. 1. 24. Deuteronomy. 17. 18 Psalm. 2. 10.
which have any knowledge of God, will avoid it, let them daily grow and go
forewarde in the same knowledge by the continual study of the divine doctrine.

8 A reward is as a stone pleasant in the eyes of them that have it: it
prospers, whither soever it turns.
We do naturally judge that it is a foul and wicked thing for magistrates
and superiors of the earth, which have the administration of justice, to love
gifts and rewards, and to take them: and even they also which receive them
could well condemn others which should do as they do: but covetousness
has corrupted and does so corrupt the nature and blind the wits, and
peruerte judgment, in such wise that men delight to forget natural honesty,
and find nothing more fair, nor more delectable then to enriche themselves by
the cost of other: they love well to receive and take that which does cost them
nothing, but only to do them pleasure which have rewarded them, for to do
wrong and injury unto other. Solomon does discover this corruption and
wickedness, saying, A reward, etc. He does first compare the gifts and
rewards that are given unto judges, unto precious stones, the which we gladly
behold, because we esteem them and find them fair: and thus he expresses
the great affection that the wicked judges have to take rewards and gifts.
Wherein let us note that he says not what they ought to do, but he touches
the great actiuitie and wicked covetousness of the judges of the earth, which
are very glad and joyful that men will blind their understanding by force of
gifts and rewards. And thus he shows that the worldly and carnal wisdom,
which we commonly desire to be in judges and governors of countries, (for
oftentimes, for the government of the policy and justice, we ordeine worldly
wise men) does hold us back to forget natural honesty, and to be foully
corrupted.

Wherefore we ought to know that the rulers of the earth have need of
another wisdom: the which is mentioned before in the Pro. 3. 13. and 8. 14.
Exo. 18. 21. 1. Sam. 12. 3. 2. Chro. 19. 5. Exo. 23. 8. Leui. 19. 15. Deuteronomy. 1.
16. and 16. 18. Esaias. 1. 21. and 5. 23. Iere. 5. 26. Eze. 22. 27. Miche. 3. 9.
Sopho. 3. 3.
8. chapter and 14. verse. Iethro (the father in law of Moses) did know that
this wisdom was fit and meet for judges: and therefore he said unto
Moses, Do thou seek out amongst all the people, men of courage, fearing God,
men dealing truly, hating covetousness: and appoint such over them, to be
rulers over thousands, etc. Samuel was endued with this wisdom: Joshua
requires the like of judges. These two personages and such like had respect
unto the law of the Lord. And because that GOD has given this lesson unto
judges, the Prophets do cry out sharply against those which do the
contrary, calling them thieves and murderers. Secondly, when he says,
Whither soever he turns, etc. He compares the gifts and rewards unto
men, to whom al things come as they would and wish, of what side soever they
turn them, they obtain whatsoever they desire. Wherein he shows that they
which take rewards, do neither regard right nor equity, but pervert
judgment, and follow the end for the which they have received the rewards.
And as it is not lawful to take rewards for judgment, so also ought no man to
give them, how good right soever they be assured to have. For in thus doing
they should be an instrument of Satan, for to accustom the Judges unto theft
and polling: and they were far better to loose their cause, how good soever
their matter be, then to induce the Judges by gifts to give sentence:
forsomuche as in us lies, we make them to break the law of God, and to
forget honesty and natural equity, and are cause of their destruction and
perdition. They then which have an evil cause do most wickedly, to give
rewards. They therefore which have an evil matter, let them forbear and cease
to do so, and they whose cause is good, let them commit it to God, staying
themselves upon his providence.

9 He that covers a transgression, seeks love: but he that repeateth a
matter, separateth the Prince.
The Princes of the world do desire neither Esaies, nor Ieremies, nor
Ezechiels, nor John Baptists, nor Pastors, nor Doctors, which will rebuke them
to their faces, for their evil doings: but rather they say unto the seers, See
not, and to the Prophet, Prophecy not the truth unto us: but preach unto us
pleasant things, etc. Esai. 30. 10. 11.
And they do abhor those which tell and show unto them their transgressions.
They think al things are lawful for them: they flatter themselves, and also
would be flattered by other: and therefore such as can dissemble not to see
their wickedness, are the best welcome toward them, they win their favor
and friendship, as they do wish and desire the same. Solomon does signify
this same, when he says,

He that covers a transgression, etc. Though it be an ordinary thing to
hide the evil that they do, whose favor and friendship according to the
world we desire, of what quality soever they be, yet do we chiefly
expound this sentence of those which labor to insinuate and creep into the
favor of Princes: partly for to join this sentence unto the two former: and
partly for that, that Solomon does show it, when he adds, But he that
repeateth, etc. That is to say, that he which is not satisfied to have once
admonished the Prince of his evil doing, but, seeing that the Prince
perseuereth and continues in evil, or, again does worse, does continue still
also to reprove him, he separateth the Prince from him, so that he is hated
of him, and is persecuted unto death, if the Prince can apprehend and take him.
The Prophets and Apostles have truly proved this same. So also do they which
reprove any people which persuade themselves that they are Princes, and would
be esteemed for such: but what separation soever is made, we must not cease
to repeat the thing, and we ought well to take heed from hiding their
faults, laboring to hold worldly and carnal friendship with the wicked. It is
al our duties: but chiefly it does belong unto the Ministers of the word.
And our Lord would Esai. 58. 1. Ier. 1. 7. 8. 18. 19. Mat. 18. 15.
have us to preach repentance: the which is not done as it requires, except
that the faults be discovered. And he would have every man to rebuke his
brother. We ought then to understand that Solomon does not here pronounce
what we ought to do: but he shows what the nature of flatterers is: to
wit, that they will not rebuke the trangressions, not because they love their
neighbors, but because that they love themselves, and would also be beloved
of other. Such were the false Prophets amongst the people of Israel, who in
steed of rebuking and threatening the people, and the Princes of their
misdooinges, made them believe that al Ier. 23. 16. Eze. 13. 6.
should go well on their side: and so they loved them not: for they did deceive
and destroy them. Such are those now which become the fellows of the wicked,
or that flatter the Nicodemites. He shows also what the hardiness and
arrogancy of those is, which think themselves great, and mighty: to wit, that
it seems to them that they have license to do whatsoever they will, and that
no man Romans 12. 18. Hebr. 12. 14
ought to rebuke them. But because that we ought to have peace with all, some
expound to cover the transgression, as (Chapter, 10. verse 12.) we have
expounded covers al trespasses: and to separate the Prince, as Chapter 16.
verse 28. If we will follow this sense which is true, and contains good
doctrine, as we have seen, we must say that this sentence is a repetition of
the two former sentences, the which is not indecent nor unmeet. Nevertheless,
because that Solomon by these sentences has labored to advertise us of diverse
and many things, there is no inconvenience to say, how Solomon does give us
here a new advertisement. And therefore, I have taken this sentence in the
first sense, leaving the readers in their liberty to choose which of the two
senses they shall like best, and most meetest.

10 A reproof enters more into him that has understanding, then an hundredth
stripes into a fool.
Forasmuch as we al do offend in many things, it follows that what
wisdom soever we have, yet is it not so perfect but Iam. 3. 2.
that we have great need to be advised and admonished, to be corrected and
reproved, that we may become more wise and better advised. Solomon would give
us the same here to understand. Also Pro. 9. 8. 9.
they which are truly wise and learned, are not arrogant and presumptuous, so
far as to think that they have no need to be admonished and rebuked: but
with all humblenes do hear instruction, and think well of them that rebuke
them. They look not to be handeled sharply, but by the only word of the
messengers of God, they do truly confess their faults: as David at the
Preaching 2. Sam. 12. 1^ Luke 22. 61 62.
of Nathan the Prophet, and as Saint Peter at the only look of Jesus Christ.
Contrarily, the foolish are so proud, arrogant, and so hardened, that not
only they disdain the rebukes by words, and do jest thereat, but also they
kick against the spur, despighting and murmuring against the rods and
corrections of God: and so much it wants that they humbly and with patience
receive them to amendment, that rather they wax obstinate and indurate, and
become worse. Pharao King of Egypt is a glass thereof: as we may see from the
beginning of the seventh Chapter of Exodus, unto the end of the 14. Even so
are the Jews also which were chastened so far as that they forsook GOD, as
a man might say, as it appears by the Scripture.

11 A seditious person seeks only evil, and a cruel messenger shall be sent
against him.
The beginning of this present sentence may be taken after two senses. The
first is, That he which is a rebel to God and his word, and to them which
have charge from him, does show by his rebellion and resistance that he
bears hatred and malice, whereby he deuiseth nothing but to despite God, to
tread his word under foot, and to hurt those which exhort him in the name of
GOD. The children of Israel have thus done in all times: as the Scripture
witnesses. They began even at the departing out of Egypt, and so continued
in the wilderness, and in the land of Canaan. Our Lord Jesus Christ does
rebuke them for it. When we were under Mat. 23. 34.
Popery, living in infidelity and ignorance, we were never a whit better. Let
us now take heed that we become not worse, when the light of life does shine
unto us. This first sense agrees well: for the rebellion of such, comes
because they love not God, nor their neighbors. Now they which have no love,
can not but imagine evil. The second sense is, That he which thus rebelleth,
does tend to nothing but his destruction and overthrow, seeing he has to
do with a strong enemy: for albeit that he deals as he thinks good, with
weak and frail men: yet he rises up against God.

Behold, this is for the second sense, the which depends upon Exo. 16. 7.
Number. 14. 11.
the first: and follows it: for it follows well, that if a seditious person
seeks only evil to his neighbor, that evil again must happen to him: as
has been showed here before. The wicked man must needs fall into the pit that
he has dug for other. Now after what sort soever the seditious seeks
the evil, he is well worthy that evil should light upon him: and therefore,
that he might be punished, A cruel messenger, shall be sent. By the cruel
messenger, he means al means by the which God afflicts and punishes the
seditious, for to destroy them, without any remedy, be they men or Devils, yea
Angels of heaven: be it by pestilence, famine, poverty, war or other
sickness. To be short, al things that are sent unto the seditious for to
destroy him, how good so ever they be of themselves, yet are they cruel
messengers unto the rebel: though by nature they are not such. In this sense
the Esai. 13. 9. Ier. 6. 23. and 50. 42. and 30. 14. Esai. 37. 36
day of the Lord is called a cruel day, and the Assirians and Chaldeans cruel,
and the Medes and Persians, and the chastisements of the Lord cruel: The Angel
of the Lord was a cruel messenger unto the Assirians.

12 It is better for a man to meet a Bear robbed of her whelps, then a fool
in his folly.
Man by his first creation was made very excellent, but by his sin he
became so vile and abject, so cursed and wicked, that he Genesis 1. 26. 27 Eccle.
3. 18 and 7. 30.
is not worthy of himself, to be placed amongst beasts, but ought to be set
more low. The holy Scripture does compare him often unto cruel beasts, as
to Foxes, Wolves, Lions and Leopards. Herein it shows after a sort, that man
is worse then they: considering that these beasts do follow the nature that
God has given them: and man of his own malice has corrupted his first
nature, wherein he was created, for to give himself unto al wickedness, making
himself like the Devil, which is the most dangerous, the strongest and the
most cruel beast to meet with all that is on the earth, for there is no force
nor wickedness to be compared unto the same of the Devil, as Saint Paul does
well show. Now seeing it is thus, it is upon good cause that Solomon says,
That it is not so dangerous Ephe. 6. 10
to meet with a Bear, which has newly lost her whelps, then to have to do
with a fool, that follows his foolishness with a loose bridle: and as
touching our nature, corrupted and malicious, we are al fools and led by
folly, from the which we can not neither will be exempted, but do follow it
most hastily, it follows therefore, that we are very fierce and cruel, except
that God by often admonitions, rebukes, threateninges and chastisements, do
make us soft and gentle. And thus, it is a very dangerous thing to have to do
with a man, before that God has regenerated and renewed him by his holy
Spirit, and has mortified his members which are on earth. If then we be not
so ungentle, nor so cruel as others, it comes not of our goodness, but of
the only mercy Coll. 3. 50.
of God, whereby he has changed and softened us.

Furthermore, let us learn that folly is no small vice, but a wickedness
greatly furious, by reason whereof the foolish are unequally yoked with other:
and thus they are forsaken of al, the which is a great misery, for no man can
dwell with them. And as by Psalm. 5. 6. and 18. 26. Collo. 3. 12.
their violence and cruelty, they drive away other, even so, God can not abide
them in his presence. And such as they show themselves toward or against
their neighbors, even so will God show himself toward them again.

Let us then take heed to follow Saint Paul, which does admonish us thus,
Now therefore as the elect of GOD holy and beloved, put on tender mercy,
kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering: forbearing one an
other, and forgiving one an other, if any man have a quarrel to an other: even
as Christ forgave you, even so do ye, etc.

And in this sort shall be accomplished in us, The Woolfe shall dwell with the
Lamb, and the Leoparde shall lie with the Kid and Esai. 11. 6. 7.
the Calfe, and the Lion and the fat beast together, and a little child shall
lead them.

13 He that rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
The worldlinges and carnally minded, do esteem and pronounce a man to be of
a fainte courage, when he steps not Exo. 23. 4. 5. Mat. 5. 44. Romans 12. 17
1. Pet. 2. 9.
forth to be revenged of his enemies, and to yield them the like, or worse:
but God judges clean contrary, when he commands us to do good for evil
unto our enemies.

Whereupon it follows, that they are worthy and valiant, which do bear
the injuries and do not render evil for evil, but rather good for evil.

It follows also, seeing that God has commanded to do good unto our enemy,
that he which yields evil for evil, shall not go unpunished, as a
transgressour of the law: although that in revenging he seems not to
offend against natural light. I say expressly, he seems: for in this place,
that which is called natural light are deuilishe darknesses, with which the
sensual man has his mind darkened, and can not know how patient he should
be, and bear with his neighbors which fail. Now if God punish them which
yield evil for evil, by a stronger reason the unthankful, ungentle and cruel
which oppress those which have done them good, ought to look for sharp
punishment. Solomon does plainly show this same, when he says,

Evil shall not depart from his house. This is not always seen with the eye:
for the Lord does suffer the unthankful and cruel to prosper in this world,
that they dispose and order their houses at their desires, yea, even a long
time, in outward appearance: but his vengeance cease not for all that to be
ready, for to be executed at time convenient openly: the which he does upon
some later, and upon the other sooner sending them great troubles. And yet he
that suffers not that they should be without evil: for by reason of their
ingratitude and cruelty which they know to be against nature, their
consciences does reprove them, and have their minds in continual fear, and
are terrified with the judgment of God. For albeit they labor by all means to
take their pleasure and be merry, for to forget the evil they do, or persuade
themselves to believe that they do none: yet seeing that they yield evil for
good, they resist against nature, and fight against it, they cannot avoid but
that their wickedness will appear before them, and convince them in their
conscience that they are wicked: and therefore they are in a continual trembling
and fearefulnes, although they labor sore to assure themselves and to be glad:
For there is no peace to the wicked. And so they begin their hell even here
hoth they and their housholdes which follow their steps and ways.

Now forasmuch as by our corrupted nature we are al inclined and given to yield
evil for good, we ought well to fear this threatening, seeing we desire that al
should be well and prosper in our houses and families, both in our time, and
after our decease from generation to generation.

Let us take heed, that we follow not our corruption least we he of the number
of those against whom the Prophet Jeremy does both pray and prophecy.
Therefore to be exempted from such evil, Ier. 18. 19.
we must be governed by the holy Ghost, which may make us to yield that
duty which we owe unto our neighbors.

14 The beginning of strife is as one that opens the waters: therefore ere
the contention be meddled with, leave off.
It is a very dangerous thing to break how little soever it be, a browe or
bancke which keeps in a river in his course, least it should spread over
the erable land or meddowes, or through towns or villages: for so soon as
there is but never so little a breach begone, if the river begin once to grow
and to swel, the violence and rage of the water will easily enlarge the breach:
and the^ there is an inundation and flood made, which brings great temporal
hurt whereas the ouerflowing happens.

Now if we fear such an opening for the danger or hurt that follows, we
must needs fear to begin a striefe, and to stir up any debate amongst our
neighhours of what quality or condition soever they be, but chiefly between
kings and Princes, and lords of the earth. For look by how much as the river
is the greater, by so much shall the breach of the bank be more dangerous:
even so also by how much as men are of greater strength and power, by so much
is the striefe more dangerous which is begun to be raised between the^. We
ought then to fear to begin any strife: for as by a breach and opening of the
bank, the waters break in, which bring great hurt to the goods on the land:
even so also the beginning of a strife, brings great hurt both to the
bodies and souls of men: for hatreds, spites and desires of vengeance are
kindled, 1. Ioh. 2. 3. 14.
which kill the souls. Also by the beginning of strife are raised seditions,
insurrections, frayes and cruel wars, and much blood is spilt, besides
theftes and spoylings, besides whoredoms, and adulteries, and besides other
oppressions. Solomon makes this comparison, when he says,

The beginning of strife is as one that opens the waters, etc. Not that al
things are like and equal, as has been already showed, and also may be
seen by experience, but Solomon makes this comparison, for to show that it
is very hard to let and stop, that many evils should not follow upon the
beginning of strife. And therefore he admonishes that we should take heed
from beginning of debate, saying, Therefore ere the contention, etc. He does
here teach us, that if we see our neighbors to be encouraged to make
debate with us, let us be ready to seek peace and reconciliation with them,
and let us be so gentle, gracious and patient, that we may lead our
neighbors unto quietness, and to desist and leave off the evil that they
devise. And for to do this well, we must take heed from nourishing of hatred
in our hearts: for hatred stirs up strifes. And so to leave off well, before
the Pro. 10. 12
contention be meddled with, we must be inclined to brotherly love.

15 He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemns the just, even they
both are abomination to the Lord.
We al do naturally know that God loves the righteous and keeps the^: and
contrarily, that he hates the wicked, and lets them perish, yea, does
punish and destroy them. We know also naturally that we must be folowers of
God, hating evil, and persecuting it, and to be lovers of goodness, and
folowers of it, and we would be accounted to be thus affectioned: and are
ready to think and pronounce of others which do the contrary, that they be
no honest men. We also judge naturally, that the righteous ought to be
maintained and conserved, and the wicked rejected and cast off. Now for to
help this natural judgment, and for to make them which shall stand against it
more inexcusable, God has given us his law by writing, by the which he
commands us the good, and forbids us the evil, not only giving unto us
the two tables of stone, but also diverse other commandments and
forbiddinges, for the exposition of the said tables: as we may see it in the
Books of Moses: whose doctrine Solomon following, says,

He that justifies the wicked, etc. When he speaks thus, he has regard
unto that which is said: for to declare this same Exo. 23. 6. Leui. 19. 15.
Deuteronomy. 1. 17 and 16. 19. Esai. 5. 23. and 59. 14. Ier. 21. 12. and 223. Amos. 5.
6.
well, the Lord has added unto his law, the Prophets, which have often cried
out upon the wicked Judges. And forasmuch as in justifying the wicked, we go
against the right and natural writing, we woorthily deserve to be abhorred of
the Lord, which is author not only of the law written, but also of natural
knowledge: for we have no knowledge, nor natural light, but that which he has
given us. Against the which if we stand, we are worse then bruit beasts
which follow their nature: and in going against the law written, we are like
unto servants and maids which despise that which they be ordained and
commanded to do about their masters work, and labor to mar al for to
vex and to despite them whom they should please and obey. Now if such,
servants and maids are hated of us, if we have any such, it follows rightly
that we must be in abomination to the Lord, whom we ought to obey and
please, if we stand against the Law that he has given us by writing.
Whereupon follows eternal death: for none can obtain salvation except he
please the Lord God. Wherefore the wicked judges ought well to tremble: for
this sentence is chiefly directed to them, and also the threatenings which are
in the places before alleged.

16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the fool to get wisdom, and he
has no heart?
The flatterers which desire to make their particular profit with the rich,
how wicked soever the rich be, cease not to labor to persuade them to
believe that they are good men, and that they do very wisely whatsoever they
take in hand: and chiefly when they are given to gather together: and
contrarily, the poor are despised, and are counted fools, except they labor
to become rich: and thus it seems unto the worldlings that wisdom comes
from riches. But let the wicked man which is here named a fool, have in his
hand ready for to give so great a price as he can: or that he has for to
hold it and to keep it, yet shall he not be wise. For first of all such
fools despise and reject all means fit and meet to come by wisdom, and
also refuse the thing it self. Secondly, blessed is the man which finds
wisdom. Whereupon follows that no sufficient price that may be given, can
get it. Pro. 1. 7. 22. and 3. 13.
But the means fit and meet to come by wisdom, is to apply our hearts
thereto: the which the fool can not, nor will do: as Solomon here shows,
when he says, The fool has no heart. Leaving then the fools, let us set
our minds, our hearts and understandings, upon the pure word of God: and
we shall obtain wisdom by the grace and gift of GOD. Since then it is the
Lord who gives wisdom, the which we must seek with all our heart Pro. 2. 1.
and we have no heart that is ought worth: Therefore it follows we must
demand a clean heart as David did. Psalm. 51. 12


17 A friend loves at al times, and a brother is borne for adversity.
They that are rich or mighty, which have credit and authority, they whose
matters happen as they would have them, and are in great prosperity, do
find many which do honor and reverence them, which declare themselves to be
at their commandment and show them great tokens of love, laboring to make
them believe that they are their singular friends, but if fortune change and
grow to worse, they which before showed themselves their friends, do mock
at them, turn their backs upon them, or persecute them, where they ought to
be more ready and careful to help them, if they were truly friends: for in
necessity a freende is known.

Whereupon follows rightly, that they which show themselves friends in
prosperity, were not friends indeed. For, as says Solomon, A freende loves
at all times. He regards not whither it be day or night, whether they be in
adversity or prosperity, in a storm or fair weather, in peace or in war in
power or in weakness, in honor or shame, in riches or poverty, but the true
friend loves and declares chiefly his love, when his neighbor is in
trouble, grief and vexation, in sorrow, affliction, and necessity: yea,
though he were hated and persecuted of all the world.

Solomon shows well this same, when he adds, And a brother is borne for
adversity. Forasmuch as the friend is borne as a brother to tribulation
(seeing that the brother never ought to forsake his brother for any misery
that he suffers, but ought to have care of him, chiefly in his afflictions:
for then have we also most need of true friends) he shows well, that we
must be friends unto the needy and painful, and to them which suffer
calamity and misery, and brotherly to help them with all our power: for the
true brother imployeth and bestows himself gladly altogether for his
brother, sparing nothing that he has, or may have, til he has delivered his
brother out of affliction. And when he speaks of birth, in the which the
creature is al new, and begins to be, he shows that he which has
showed himself to be a true friend to his neighbor in prosperity, that in
time of misery he will begin to declare unto him more abundantly his love, not
by words only, but indeed: as we are admonished by the Scripture in
express examples and testimonies. Abraham may be an example, in the
deliverance of Lot: and also Moses Genesis 14. 14 Exo. 1. 12. Genesis 43. Exo. 22.
25. Leui. 19. 9. 10. 18. Deu. 15. 7. Iam. 2. 15. 16 1. Ioh. 3. 17.
when he smote the Egyptian, and in the labor that he took to deliver the
children of Israel: Joseph likewise.

As touching the witnesses, they are many in number. He shows us also by this
birth, that if we have not showed some sign of friendship unto our neighbor,
when he was in prosperity, that yet we should begin to love him in his
necessity, in helping him after our ability and power. By these things we
may know, and also by experience, that the poor, the fatherles, the widows,
and the strangers, have not many friends.

18 A man destitute of understanding, touches the hand, and becomes surety
for his neighbor.
Albeit that Solomon does attribute want of understanding, or faintness of
heart unto a man which becomes pledge for his neighbor, yet he pretends
not to turn us away from answering for our neighbors, when necessity
requires, and so that we may do it without bringing ourselves and our
family into danger of begging our bread miserably, and not that strangers
should be set at ease at our cost: as has been handeled, Chapter 6. verse
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

19 He loves transgression, that loves striefe: and he that exalts his
gate, seeks destruction.
Forasmuch as there is none of us that would be esteemed a transgressour,
neither is there any man that desires (as he thinks) his destruction, let
us understand, that when Solomon does show us that from strife we come to
delight for to transgress, and that from pride or exaltation, which is
signified by him that exalts his gate, proceeds death and destruction, let
us understand, I say, that he does exhort us that we should turn away
from al striefes, which come of enimitie, hatred, malice, and appetite of
vengeance.

Now he says, that he which delights to have such strifes, delights to
do evil, giving himself unto al sin and vices, in committing the which he
thinks to overcome his enemy with whom he is at strife: and so strife is
the root of much mischief, when we are led to strise through hatred and
envy: contrarily, the strife should be maintained, when it requires the
maintenance of the honor and glory of God, his pure truth, and the
edification of his Church, against the Heretics, and to defend the righteous
and innocent against the violence of the wicked. He that loves such debates,
loves not transgression, but does abhor it, and loves truth: for he
follows that which God desires and Iere. 17. 17. 18. 19. Genesis 11 Esa. 36.
and 37. Dan. 4. 2. Sam. 15.
commands. Let us also understand that he does admonish us to put of al
pride and highness of mind, when he threateneth him with destruction which
exalts his gate. Wherefore, let us not be like unto them which builded Babel:
nor like unto Zennacherib, Nabuchadnezer, nor Absalom. We are also exhorted
after a sort that we should be careful to build the Church and house of
God, and to make ourselves friends in communicating of our goods unto the
needy: and in so doing, we shall have not only gates made of corruptible
stones, but also eternal tabernacles in the heavens.

20 The froward heart finds no good: and he that has a naughty tongue,
shall fall into evil.
We may see before our eyes that the wicked and froward have temporal
felicity and joy, that they are at their ease, and do greatly florishe: and
therefore, it seems at the first sight that Solomon stands against
experience, when he says,

The froward heart finds no good, etc. But if we consider the nature of the
froward heart, which is to devise evil continually, and to give no rest unto
his mind, we shall know that the froward heart how flourishing soever he
be, shall not find the good that is spoken of in this place: for Solomon
speaks not here of temporal goods which are common both to good and to bad:
but of those goods whereof David speaks in his Psalm. 34. ver. 13. If such
goods are not found by the froward heart, it is no wonder, for he neither
asks nor seeks it: the which is required in the finding thereof, and also
he is in abomination too the Lord.

Now the Lord does not give unto the froward whom he hates and
abhors, that which he has ordained properly for his children, whom he
loves, and in whom he takes his delight, Mat. 7. 7. Pro. 11. 20.
but sends them evil, whereinto they fall and perish. Solomon pronounces
this fall and perdition, saying, And he that has a naughty tongue, shall fall
into evil. For although he speaks here of the tongue, yet does he not say
any thing which is not joined to the former part, and which follows not also:
for since there can come nothing out of the poke and sack, but that which is
within, even so it follows, that it is necessary for the froward heart to
have also a lewd and naughty tongue, the which speaks from the abundance
thereof. And so, they which speak evil, cannot be said to be good and honest
men, if they will not lie, and falsify the infallible Mat. 12. 34.
truth, which calls the Pharisees which spoke evil, Generarion of vipers.
And also forasmuch as the froward heart does find no good, he must then
needs find evil, that if it be in this world openly, yet hell shall find
him. And therefore, let us not be envious to be of a froward heart, nor
naughty in our tongues, but let us follow Solomon. And because it is the gift
of God, we must Pro. 4. 23.
ask it of him.

21 He that begets a fool, gets himself sorrow: and the father of a
fool can baue no joy.
Forasmuch as it is a blessing of God to beget children, and to have kindred,
it is no reason that we should be grieved when we have a multitude of
children, but confessing truly that it is the gift of God, we must therefore
give him thanks and praises, in following the good old fathers, which rejoiced
when the Lord gave them lineage. And for to continewe in this joy, the fathers
and mothers must be careful and diligent for to enstruct their children in the
Genesis 4. 1. 25. and 21. 6. 1. Sam. 2. Luke. 68. Ephe. 6. 1. Collo. 3. 20. Ephe.
6. 4
fear of the Lord, admonishing, correcting, and chastening them, for to make
them obedient unto God, which commands them, to honor their father and
mother. And for to obey them well, let them follow what S. Paul says, Children,
obey your father and mother in the Lord: for that is righteous.

Now for to lead them rightly thereto, let the fathers and mothers be
careful, of that which Saint Paul does admonish them, And ye fathers,
provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in instruction, and
information of the Lord: And this they must not do only with word, but
chiefly with holy conversation, giving them good example: let them follow also
that which Saint Paul teaches. Let the elder men be sober, honest discrete,
sound in the faith, in love, and in patience. Otherwise the children in Titus.
2. 2.
steed to stand in fear, to be obedient, humble and modest will be proud,
rebellious, arrogant and dissolute: and thus in steed too be wise, they
shall be fools: and in steed of giving joy to their parents, they shall bring
them sorrow: For he that begets a fool etc. Solomon has already
heretofore foretaught us this same. And forasmuch as parents do not conceive
any sorrow for their children, except folly appear, the which cannot Pro. 10.
1. and 15. 20
be seen til they are past their infancy, therefore it follows that to
beget, is not taken for the first generation, wherein the children have no
knowledge nor discretion, but for the disposition that the children do get,
either by the negligence and wickedness of their parents, or else by the
wilfulness, and obstinacy of the children themselves, or else by them both. If
the disposition come by the fault of the parents, then can they not of
themselves be sorry, for the folly of their children, but do rather delight
therein, take pleasure and rejoice thereat. But we must not think for all this
but that Solomon says ture: for God can tell how to find out such parents,
and convert their joy into sorrow, in raising up their children against them, or
giving up their children unto such wickedness that they shall come to the
gallows, or else by destroying both themselves and their children by diverse
miseries and afflictions. But if having done their duty, by admonitions,
corrections, and chastisinges, they could beget none but fools, they shall be
sorrowful, but yet it shall be to the hurt of their children. We may apply this
same unto Superiors and subjects, to Ministers and their people.

22 A joyful heart causes good health: but a sorrowful mind dries the
bones.
There is no man but understands and confesses, that if a sick man do
willingly and gladly take Physic, but that it may be profitable for to
restore strength to the members weakened, and good color unto the face again,
which was decayed by sickness: contrarily, if a man be vexed and troubled,
and that he delights in nothing, nor in any good medicine that is prescribed
him, it shall not profit his body, but will come to nothing, and vanishe away
without restoring him. Solomon does plainly pronounce it, when he faith,

A joyful heart causes good health: but a sorrowful mind dries the bones.
And in this he teaches us, that we may not give over rejoicing, though that
God does smite us and send us sickness: but that with joy we should use
the means ordained of God for the recovering of health, strength, and force,
that we may not be unprofitable, as dry bones, but may be fit and apt to
serve God and our neighbors in the vocation whereto we are called. And so he
teaches us how we must use the things that God gives us for this body,
that we make them not unprofitable and unfruitful: and he shows us that we
must not despise our bodies: for God also has not disdained them, when he
created al things for them, and that he would administer unto them al things
necessary for them: as our Lord Jesus Christ does teach us, when he says
unto us, That we should ask of our heavenly father, that he would give us
this day our daily bread. Also he has created both the Physician and Phisike,
reteining nevertheless to himself the healing. Therefore in using joyfully
the help of Physicians, Eccl. 38. 2. Chro. 16. 1^
and of medicines, let us not put our trust therein, but in God: not doing as
Asa did.

Now albeit that in this sentence we may learn that which has been said,
yet we must understand that Solomon pretends by corporal things to bring
us unto spiritual. And therefore that our bones may not dry away, least we
perish without remedy, let us take heed that when we are sick, yea dead by
our sins, that we be not grieved that the chief Physician Jesus Christ
should come unto us, and exhort us unto repentance, whereunto Luke. 15. ^
let us be given with joy: as also there is joy in it. etc,

23 A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to wrest the ways of
judgment.
There are many which persuade themselves to believe that they do no evil in
taking gifts, provided that they have not exacted nor required them, and that
no man sees any thing, for it is the custom of wicked judges, which would be
in estimation, more to fear men then God, or to labor to set God wholly in
contempt and forgetfulness, and have their respect unto men. But what wisdom
soever they challenge, yet are they wicked: as they should well understand,
when God forbids judges expressly too take gifts, and that he calls them
which receive gifts, thieves and murderers. Solomon also does give them it to
understand, when he says,

A wicked man takes a gift, etc. He discovers and opens the wickedness of
such judges: first of al when he says that they take it out of the bosom:
for he shows that in taking the gift secretly, they do against their
conscience, and that they have more reverence to men then to God, or that they
be of the number of those of whom the Psalmist complains. Secondly when he
says,

To wrest the ways of judgment. For he shows that he violently pulls the
right from him to whom it belongs, as he knows well, but his covetousness
does compel him to counteruaile Psalm. 94. 3.
the gift to him which has given it him, as Solomon has showed heretofore,
saying, that wheresoever the gift is given, it prospers. And thus Solomon
does show us that the judges, which receive gifts, neither can, nor will
administer justice, and therefore they rightly deserve to be called wicked.
Let judges and magistrates understand that they are here admonished, that if
they will rightly administer justice, they must wholly abstain from taking of
gifts. Also they ought to shun flatteries and worldly honors, and to have
no respect of persons, for by these things they wrest judgment, as well as by
the receite of gifts, but the holy Scripture does more often make mention of
gifts, because that gifts are of greater power, so that they which love them,
will be ready for to betray their fathers and mothers.

24 Wisdom is in the face of him that has understanding: but the eyes of a
fool are in the corners of the world.
There are many men which think that they cannot be wise, except they visit
and see far countries, and except they can understand diverse languages, and
except they give their eyes to behold, and their minds to consider the
fashions and manners of diverse peoples and nations, and except they had proved
many things: but the true wisdom requires no man to trot hither nor run
thither, for to be talked with, but she does offer herself unto those which
give their minds and understanding unto Pro. 2. 1.
the word of the Lord, for to believe it and obey it. Such men so attentive
and learned in the word, which is our only wisedo^e and prudence, never want
wisdom, as Solomon does show it, saying,

Wisdom is in the face, or in the presence of the wise: but he that
wandereth hither and thither for to make himself wise, is destitute of
wisdom and prudence: for he is a fool: as Solomon does pronounce, saying,
But the eyes of a fool, etc. Notwithstanding we will not condemn the Queen
of Saba of foolishness, for the voyage that she made unto Jerusalem. For then
there was wisdom but in Iewrie, where the word of God and his servant 1.
Kings. 10
were, and that time there was no such wisdom in all the world as was the
same of Solomon. Our Lord Jesus Christ also 1. Kin. 11. 12. Mat. 12. 42.
has allowed the voyage of the same Queen. We will not condemn the Apostles
of our Lord, which wandered up and down through the world: for it was done
at the commandment of Jesus Christ, and was not taken in hand for to learn
wisdom: for before that they departed from Jerusalem they were filled with
the holy Ghost, which is the spirit of wisdom: but they went Acts. 2. 4.
Esaias. 11. 2.
to win wise men unto our Lord, by the preaching of the same wisdom
wherewith they were indewed. We will not also condemn those of folly which
wanting this wisdom in their country, seek out the places, where God has
planted his pure word, which is the true wisdom.

25 A foolish son is a grief unto his father, and a heaviness unto her
that bare him.
When Solomon has already so often reproved the foolish son, and praised
the wise child: and not contented therewith Pro. 10. 1. and 13. 1. and 15. 5.
2^.
does still rebuke the foolish child, he shows well that it is very
needful that fathers and mothers, and all superiors and governors, should
be very wise, that they may teach wisdom unto their children, unto their
subjects, and to those which they have in charge and government. He shows
also that it is a very detestable thing both before God and men, which have any
good feeling, that A foolish son, which by contempt of holy and honest,
modest, and humble conversation does vex and torment his parents, to whom
he owes al honor and reverence, al obedience and submission, al pleasure and
service. He shows further by so many reprehensions that the foolish children
will not gladly be amended, but do delight in folly, and be hardened therein
by custom, and perseverance in wickedness. And thus folly is so familiar and
acquainted with them that it is almost impossible for to heal them of it.
Wherefore let the fathers and mothers, and also al governors of youth, not be
slouthful and negligent. And when for to signify the mother he says,

Her that bare him, he does give us to understand that there is great
ingratitude and unthankfulness, yea cruelty in the foolish son, when in
vexing his mother, he will not confess the great blessing that he has
received by her, when she did bear him, nine mouths in her womb with great
pain and many sorrows, and that with extreme travail she brought him forth
into the world, and with great care she did nource and bring him up tenderly
in his infancy and youth.

26 Surely it is not good to condemn the just, nor that the Princes should
smite such for equity.
We might marvel why Solomon sets down that which the most idiot and
ignorant does know and confess, for a notable sentence and proverb. It might
well seem that it were for nothing that he has pronounced such a sentence,
seeing also that the most wicked do agree theretoo. But the scripture
requires not only confession of mouth, but true consent of heart. Now
though the wicked have goodly shows for to counterfaite themselves to be
honest and good men, and make us believe that they would not consent that any
righteous and faithful, little or great, should be in any wise troubled,
because they know naturally that it is not well done: nevertheless they
cease not to be fleshed, to do hurt and violence unto the innocent, just, and
faithful man, they are of so froward and wicked a mind, and conscience
corrupted. And therefore, when Solomon says,

Surely it is not good to condemn the just: It is not chiefly to teach us
that we should not condemn the just: for the same is so well known, that it
may make those which do contrary inexcusable. But it is to reprove the tyranny
and violence of the wicked which have authority and power, and to make them
feel that they do against their conscience. And this is chiefly directed unto
kings and lords of the earth, because that without regard to right and
equity, they would have al things to be done after their will and
fantasy. We may thus understand it, by that that he makes mention here of
smiting princes for equity, by which are signified al good governors, which
are often molested and pressed to pronounce wicked sentences, for the pleasure
of their superiors. This serves also for to admonish kings and superiors
of the earth, not to do wrong unto the righteous, but that they should
maintain them, and conserve them: and that if they have good governors and
magistrates in their country and lordships, that they should admonish and
stir them up to justice and judgment, rather then to trouble and torment
them for judging rightly. And herein we have almost a repetition of the 15.
verse, the which repetition is very necessary, for to rebuke the tyranny and
cruelty of the great, the which is so deeply rooted in their hearts, that
their will stands for a law. And when they which commit evil, should be
abhorred, chastized and rooted out, he shows that we should not suffer
tyrants to bear rule.

27 He that has knowledge, spares his words: and a man of understanding is
of an excellent spirit.
There is neither man nor woman but does praise himself in his heart, and we
all do desire naturally to appear learned, though we be ignorant, and feel
and judge it in our consciences: and even the most ignorant do strive by many
words to win estimation and reputation. This is proved by experience after
diverse sorts: and amongst other we shall see the sophistical doctors and
disputers, 1. Ttm. 1. 4 and 6. 3 2. Tim. 2. 15 16. 17. 23
which would show themselves by long and diverse disputations to be good
divines, whereas they understand nothing of that which belongs to God. We
may thus speak of them after Saint Paul. And as touching humane arts, they
which know least of them, will speak of them most boldly. Solomon does show
us well, that we must make no account of such people, when he says,

He that has knowledge, spares his words, etc. Wherein we must learn,
that he which has true knowledge of any thing, speaks not thereof at
adventure and vnconsiderately, but he markerh fit opportunity, he considers
how, when and before that need requires him to open his mouth. And herein
he shows that he has not a flying spirit nor senseles mind but a stayed and
setteled mind, which is not tossed above measure to thrust out words, but
wayeth what he has to say. The same comes of great excellency, whereof
they are partakers which are not delighted with folly nor with ignorance, but
are careful to know and understand profitable and necessary things: and
chiefly by the word, which is our wisdom and knowledge. Solomon does
affirm it when he says,

And a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.

Now forasmuch as the excellency of the spirit is not given us that we
should hide it (for a candle is not lighted for to be put under a bushel, but
upon a candlestick: and it lights all that are in the house) let us not
think that when Solomon praises him which spares his words, that he
would have us dumb, nor that we should fear, as grieved to make our
neighbors partakers of our knowledge, and understanding: seeing also that it
is the nature and property of wisdom and understanding for to communicate
Pro. 1. 21
themselves: but he would have us to speak wisely, the which dwells and
abides with discretion.

28 Even a fool when he holds his peace, is counted wise: and he that
stops his lips, is prudent.
Commonly fools do talk very much, uttering not only vain, frivolous, and
pleasant things to the flesh, but most often ungodly and wicked things,
abominable and detestable things: as flattering words, lies, false
witnessinges, slanders, oaths, periuries, cursinges, blasphemies, and
deniynges of God. This is the common trade of wicked fools to use such
filthiness and infections, and to spue them out of their stinking mouths,
because that their inward parts ouerfloweth: but the wise, which have no desire
but to please God, and to profit their neighbors, do diligently hear and are
sober in words. They love better to be scholars and disciples, then to be
masters and doctors: except they know that Psalm. 5. 1^
their duty requires to speak, for to stop the mouths of the wicked, and
to instruct the ignorant, and to arm them, that afterward they may resist the
evil speaker, as need and opportunity shall require.

Now because that in sobriety of words their wisdom shines, when the
fools dissemblingly do hold their peace, they are counted wise and learned:
it is not therefore to say that they are such: but if we desire to show
ourselves wise and prudent, as behooves, we must keep back things which are
hurtful and bring damage, and which serve for nothing but to dishonor God, and
to offend our neighbors. Solomon has showed us the same.

Now let us note, that to show ourselves wise and prudent in holding our
peace it is not enough too utter nothing Pro. 10. 19. 20. 21.
that is evil: but we must abstain from al hurt, or rather to suffer with
patience the injuries and wrongs, then to do the same unto our enemies and
adversaries, being assured that God will not forsake us, but will deliver us at
the time appointed: for the silence that pleases God consists chiefly in
patience, in faith and repentance.

The xviii. Chapter.
1 HE that is at liberty, seeks freely, and studieth every doctrine, for the
desire thereof he will separate himself to seek it, and occupy himself in all wisdom.
IT is a common saying, whosoever has a fellow has also a master: for he
cannot do whatsoever he would, but must sometimes dissemble, and suffer
things which please him not, and to leave many works that he would gladly
take in hand, because he thinks them either profitable or necessary, and
must subject himself and agree with his fellow, for to maintain familiarity
and friendship, and to have peace, and to avoid and shun greater hurt.

Now if between fellows and companions the matter thus stands bound, it
follows well that he which is bond and slave, cannot follow his desires, but
must yield himself subject and obedient to the will and commandment of his
master and lord, and cannot meddle with such works as come in his mind,
but is bound and tied to the will of his master. Wherefore it seems right,
that there is nothing better then to be at liberty that we may do according
to our will, and follow our counselles. And if we do make this accounte of
corporal liberty amongst the worldlinges, the children of GOD ought much
more to set by their spiritual liberty, of the which we are deprived through
the corruption of our nature, and are the slaves of sin, our flesh Ioh. 8.
34. Romans 6. 16 and 7. 14. Gala. 5. 17.
consenting thereto, and which to obey, it fights against the spirit: in such
wise as we do not that which we would before God. But if we will be set free,
and to do our will at liberty, let us take heed for to separate us from sin,
in not suffering it to rule in our mortal bodies: as we are admonished. In
this sort we shall be delivered, Romans 6. 12. and. 13. 13. 14 Gal. 5. 16. 1.
Pet. 2. 11.
separated and made free for to follow our desires, which shall not be to
obey the flesh and his lusts, but for to serve God willingly and gladly,
according to his word: which is al our doctrine: for in seeking it after our
desire, and thrusting ourselves into the same by faith and good works, we
shall be furnished with necessary doctrine to get wisdom, knowledge and
understanding withal. And there is nothing that we can desire further, except
that we should persevere and profit more and more in the same. But we cannot
attain the end thereof, unless we fight valiantly against the Devil and the
world, yea even against ourselves. Saint Paul does well give us this same to
understand, when he would have us armed with all the armor of God, and when
he shows us the Ephe. 6. 10. Romans 6. 13. and 7. 14 Gala. 5. 17.
co^trarietie which is between the flesh and the spirit. Therefore when by the
word of the Lord we labor to reduce the corrupted and dissolute, they must
not complain that we will take away their liberty, and make them subjects.

2 A fool has no delight in understanding: but that his heart may be
discovered.
The foolish, the number whereof is infinite, do not delight, but to think
wickedly, to speak ungodly, and to do works abominable. Pro. 12. 13. and 13.
16 and 15. 2.
Solomon does signify this same, saying, But that his heart may be
discovered, which is filled so full of uncleanness, that he must needs spue it
up, and publish his folly.

3 When the wicked comes, then comes contempt, and with the vile man,
reproach.
When David says, The wicked has made boast of his own Psalm. 10. ^
hearts desire, and the covetous blesses himself: he contemns the Lord,
etc. he declares the nature of the wicked, and his manners, and kinds of
doing, which are much unreasonable, and ought not to be borne withal. For it
is not against man that he stands up by contempt, but also against God: and
is so vile, filthy and unshamefast, that he has no shame at al, and cares
not to spoil God of his honor, to whom only we owe all honor and glory,
neither makes he any account to give that which he ought unto his
neighbors, but without conscience gives himself to do them injury wrong
and violence, which is to dishonor them. For as the honor lies not in
gesture of body, or words which have some civility and fair show, but in
readiness and diligence of doing our office and duty toward them: even so
the dishonor stands chiefly when we pass not to do that we ought. The
Apostle Saint Paul very largely describes this nature and manner Romans 1
of doing. And Solomon does expound it in few words, saying,

When the wicked comes, then comes contempt, and with the vile man
reproach. Now as the wicked disdaineth even so is he disdained of GOD: and as
he does dishonor, so shall he be dishonored. This is showed us, when the
wicked are compared unto hay, and to the smoke, and to dounge, and to goats.
1. Sam. 2. 30 Psalm. 1. 4. Mat. 3. 12 Psalm. 2. 4 Prou. 1. 25 Psalm. 37. 2. 20.
and 68. 3 Esaias. 65. 5. Psalm. 83. 11 Iere. 16. 4. and 25. 33. Math. 25. 32
And thus contempt and dishonor comes with the wicked and vile man in two
sorts: that is, that he contemns and is contemned: he dishonors and is
dishonored. But the two sorts are not like. For although that by contempt and
dishonor he labors what he can to set GOD and his neighbors at naught,
and at perdition, yet his pains brings not forth his effect, as he
pretends, but fall upon himself, as he shall one day feel.

Moreover, let us note that the lords of the world are here chiefly accused
to be wicked, albeit that for their authority and power they are declared
honest and good men; and to be villains, though now they be named noble,
magnificent, worshipful, right honorable, high and mighty: for in their
hearts they worship themselves, and think not that they are subject unto
God, nor that they ought to honor any man: but God can tell well enough how to
beat down their loftiness and pride: as has been heretofore alleged.
Wherefore let us take good Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Esaias. 58. 7
heed from making ourselves believe that we be great and noble, but let us
walk in all fear, carfulness, and reverence, and let us follow the
commandments and admonitions of our God Romans 12. 10 and 13. 7 Phil. 2. 2.
and of his servants.

4 The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters: and the well spring of
wisdom is like a flowing river.
If we have never so little good feeling with good affection, we desire to
know and to understand how we should rule ourselves for to please God, and
be fruiteful and profitable unto our neighbors: and would be very sorry if
our understanding failed us: but we need not to fear the same, if willingly
we yield us Disciples and scholars of our Lord, hearing them, whose mouths
he has endued with wisdom for too instruct us: for as we find always
something to draw out off hollow and deep waters and rivers abounding with
waters: even so in resorting to wise men, and diligently hearing them, we shall
never want doctrine, but shall have abundance and grow in wisdom, and in all
spiritual and necessary blessings.

Now also Solomon uses the foresaid similitude, for to Prou. 1. 5.
show us the same, when he says, The words of a man's mouth are like deep
waters, and the welspring of wisdom is like a flowing river.

Whereupon let us first note, that when the doctrine, the graces and gifts of
the holy Ghost, which are communicated unto us by the mouth of the wise, are
compared unto hollow and deep waters, unto great and flowing rivers, out of
the which it is lawful, for every man to draw freely, the said spiritual
blessings are freely given unto us: as it is plainly and openly declared,
when Esaias. 55. 1. Ioh. 4. 10. 14
the Scripture speaks of gift and of giving. And thus, must not they which
have wisdom, and chiefly the Ministers of the word of God, be niggardes of
this water, when they have it in all abundance, and that they labor not to
enriche John. 7. 38. Mat. 10. 8.
them selves by the communication of their own wisdom, but let them be
contented to live by their work. Secondly let us note, that though the sluice
be set open, and that we make no account of the water that runs through for
the abundance thereof, yet it is very necessary. Even so, though that the
worldlinges and carnal men do despise the graces and gifts of the holy Ghost,
yet without them they shall perish. Albeit then that the holy Ghost does
display and unfold his graces in diverse sorts and abundantly, yet it is not
to say that we must contemn them or loath them.

Thirdly let us note, albeit that Solomon says simply of a man's mouth, without
adding either good or wise, or righteous or learned: yet ought it to be so
understood: as he himself does show it, when he adds, and the welspring of
wisdom is like a flowing river. For out of the mouth of fools, unrighteous
and wicked, comes nothing but mire and durte, and not water. And also none is
worthy to be called a man, except that in his speech he shows that the
image of God, where after he was created, is not altogether blotted out in
him. The which the wicked will not, nor cannot do, but by their words they
show that they have the mark of the devil their father. Let us understand
therefore, that for to show ourselves men indeed, our words must be as
clear and clean water. And for to do this, let us obey Saint Paul.
Fourthly, let us note that the use of the doctrine and of the Sacraments ought
to be continually in the church, and those that are placed doctors and
pastors in the same, ought to do their office so Ephe. 4. 25 and 5. 3
carefully, that they should content and satisfy the thirsty people with the
word. For if we must quench bodily thirst through charity, by a more strong
reason ought we to refresh the thirsty souls: and that that, which the
Prophet says may be fulfilled, In the wilderness shall waters break out, and
rivers in the desert: and the dry ^say. 35. 6. 7. and 44. 3.
ground shall be as a poole, and the thirsty as springes of water in the
habitation of Dragons. etc.

Fifthly let us note, that we must diligently think upon that which we must
speak: for if we speak at adventure, insteede of drawing of clear water, we
shall draw puddle. And therefore it is not without cause that Saint James, would
have a man to be slow in Iam. 1. 19
speaking, and hasty in hearing.

5 It is not goood to accept the person of the wicked, to cause the righteous
too fall in judgment.
Man loves himself so much, that he is naturally inclined to seek his
profit: and for to do the same, he labors sometimes to be at the
commandment of those whose displeasure he fears: sometimes he favors
those whom he thinks will be profitable unto him: and sometimes he bears
with those to whom he thinks he is beholding and stands bound: and albeit
that he is convinced in his conscience, that they are wicked, and that he
cannot be maintained of them except he do wrong to other: yet he cease not
to have this affection and to do wrong unto his neighbor against his
conscience. Amongst such people, the most pernicious are the judges and
governors of the land which are led with flattering words, and desire to be
commended and praised, which are led with ambition and vaynglorie, and which
are covetous, coveting to get riches for to have credit, and to be mighty.
For this cause Solomon has already rebuked them, and now again he
reprooueth and accuses them, when he says, It is not good. etc. Wherein he
speaks like unto Moses, and unto other Pro. 17. 15. 23. 26. Exo. 23. 1. 2. 6.
Scriptures alleged already here before, which serve unto the greater
condemnation of the wicked, which bear favor and regard, their like, for to
deprive the just of his right. For though the Scripture did make no mention
that such kind of dealings are wicked, yet is there not so wicked a man that
is not convinced naturally: seeing that al judges would be esteemed that they
do justice and judgment: and if they had any just cause or quarrel, they
could tell well how too condemn those which should make them too loose it.

6 A fools lips come with strife, and his mouth calls for stripes.
Seeing that iniquity does cover and close the mouth of the Pro. 10. 11. 32.
and 11. 9 and 12. 6.
wicked, and the mouth of the wicked speaks froward things: and the
hypocrite hurts his neighbor with his mouth: The talking of the wicked is to
lie in wait for blood: and a fool spreads and 13. 16. and 14. 3. and 15. 2.
28. and 16. 27.
abroad folly: and in the mouth of the foolish is the rod of pride. And the
mouth of fools babbleth out foolishnes: and the wicked man's mouth babbleth
evil things: and a wicked man diggeth up evil, and in his lips is like
burning fire: and seeing also that they which have not their affections well
ruled and ordered, nor their passions well tamed, but are impatient, can not
suffer to be contraried, and will not dissemble that which displeases them, it
is not without cause that Solomon says now.

A fools lips come with strife, and his mouth calls for stripes. Therefore
if we desire to do as Saint Paul does teach us, that is, to have friendship
and peace with all men, we must fly back from folly, lest it take root in
our hearts, and fill them therewith, so that from the abundance thereof, our
mouths speak flattering words, leasinges, slanderinges, false witnessinges,
cursings, and other injurious and outrageous words. For if such things come
out of our mouths, and that we should have to do with men that would be
sodeinely moved to anger, impatient and brainsicke, we should not be
without strifes and dissentions, without wars and battles.

Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that we must not continue still to rebuke
vices and wickedness with anger, sharpness and rigor: and chiefly when they
are committed with obstinacy, arrogancy and offense. Neither ought we to
care though some take such reprehension injuriously, call us fools, and starte
up against us: for the Saints which are gone before us, have sustained such
combattes, and we must follow them. And if we must take heed for speaking
foolishly, for to avoid strife and blows, and to be at discord and hatred
with our neighbors, by a stronger reason must we beware of speaking
foolishely before God.

7 A fools mouth is his own destruction, his lips are a snare for his
soul.
For to show that the vanity and folly, that the malice and wickedness of the
fools words hurt him: and that the evil he seeks to do to another by his
mouth and his lips, wherewith he utters flatteries, slaunderinges, lies,
false witnessings, wanton and lascivious words, vain oaths and blasphemies,
shall fall upon his head, and that he shalbeare the punishment, Solomon uses
two similitudes. The first is taken from a thing, which may be diminished and
broken, and can by no means be repaired and set up again.

And thus the fools, are deceived in their speaking: For albeit they know well
that they flatter and lie, yet they say, We will prevail with our tongues, our
lips are our own: who is Psa. 12. 4. 5. Gene. 9. 22. and 11. 4. 21. 9. Psa.
31. 18. 19. and 35. 19 and 50. 17. and. 52. 3.
Lord over us? But the holy Ghost demands that the Lord would cut off
all flattering lips: as has been done toward many: amongst the which
we may set Cham, the builders of Babel Tower, Ismael, Roboham, Sennacherib,
Nabuchadnezer. And with these examples, we have also diverse threatenings.

The second similitude is taken from beasts, which run into the netes and
snares, out of the which they cannot escape, and so must dye. Even so the fool
is taken by his words, and is condemned: Whereupon follows his
destruction. But the things are not altogether like: For the beasts are
simple, and think on none evil when they run into the cords, nets, and
snares. And so they perish without their fault. And the fool by the vanity
and folly, by the wickedness and abomination Pro. 1. 17.
which proceeds and comes out of his mouth, and his lips does set cords
and nets for his neighbors, which have done him none evil: and therefore his
iniquity shall fall upon himself, and shall perish therein. The preachers of
the popish Church and the singers or quier men do set snares for the poor
simple and unlearned: But at the last they shall be taken therein themselves,
with all those which seek by their talebearing the Psa. 9. 16. Mich. 3. 5.
destruction of their neighbors. After this sense we may say that this present
sentence does follow the former: for of strife and blows do come and
proceed great overthrows and destructions: and because we fear them, we
must be careful to speak wisely: to the which let us understand that Solomon
does exhort us: but after the opinion of some, we are exhorted unto fasting,
abstinence, sobriety and temperancie: for as they take it, Solomon does show
the hurt that comes of gluttony and drunkenness, of the abundance and
superfluity of meats and drinks, which pass through the mouth and between
the lips. True it is, that the gluttons and drunkardes do kill themselves,
and send their bodies and their souls unto perdition. Notwithstanding the
first sense seems unto me to agree best.

8 The words of a talebearer are as flatterings, and they go down into the
bowels of the belly.
Solomon here shows us, that the fool which medleth with slandering, and to
bear false witness, and to carry about wicked tales, does not only seek
his own destruction, but theirs also of whom he speaks sinisterlie: and it
is chiefly his purpose to hurt his neighbors by his mouth and to destroy them.
And for to show the same, he uses a similitude taken of a spear or lance
which hurts a man, and is so sharp and pricking, that not only it pearceth
unto the bones, but unto the deepest part of a man, and wounds him to death.
And herein he speaks according to the Psalm. The similitude may be taken
from the poison which hurts the Psalm. 52. 4. and 57. 5. and 59. 7. and 64. 3.
and 140. 2.
man, and pearceth to the bowels. We have seen heretofore diverse times, that
tale cariers and slanderers, liers, and false witnesses, do bring great hurt,
and work great destruction: as we may see it here again, when Solomon does
compare them unto murderers and poysoners, which spare not the lives of their
neighbors. Now if we must labor to fly such kind of people, which desire
the destruction, either of our goods, or of our good name, or of our bodies,
much more them which labor to destroy our souls by false doctrine. And let
us learn, that as we would have none to hurt us either with tongue or with
weapon, even so also let us not hurt any other man.

9 He also that is slouthful in his work, is even the brother of him that is a
great waster.
Many through the world do take their pastime after the flesh, permitting to
themselves whatsoever they desire, in play, in gluttony and drunkenness, in
sloth and carelesnes, in pleasures and voluptuousnes: and care not at al to
set their hand to work, and to do their office, after the state whereuntoo
they are called: and yet they would have us believe that they spoil nothing,
because their intent (as they think) is not such, and that they commit no
evil of set purpose. But if we believe Solomon (as we ought) we will hold them
for great wasters: for he calls him which is slouthful in his work, Brother
of him that is a great waster. Where in he shows that he would have us to
count the slouthful and careless for wicked wasters. And so he privily accuses
them to be thieves and murderers, and that rightly: for they steal that
whereby they live, seeing that they win it not lawfully: and so much as in
them lies, they kill the poor, for whom they should be careful, and
diligently to work. And so slouthfulnes or slacknesse, is no small vice:
seeing that he which is given thereto, is not hurtful only to himself, but
also to his neighbors: though he will not know it. For if we tell him which
is slouthful at his work, that he does not his duty: he will answer, he
does wrong to none but to himself: wherein he belyeth Solomon, yea the holy
Ghost which calls him brother to the master of wasting. Let us then
understand that almen are admonished to be watchful and diligent in their
vocation, and carefully to do their office: and chiefly the fathers of
household, Magistrates, and the Pastors of the Church: for the negligence of
the masters of the house, does so much or more hurt in the household, then
the superfluous and excessive spending. The carelessness of Magistrates,
hurts as much or more the common wealth at home, tha^ the enemies do with
wars abroad. The slothfulness of Ministers and their ignorance together
does no less hurt to the Church, then the cruelty of tyrants, which
strive to oppress it by war and violence. And as the negligent and slouthful
is like unto a great spender and waster, even so shall he be punished likewise:
as it is showed us, in Mat. 25.
the parable of the virgins and talentes. That we may not be of the number of
such, let us watch carefully to do our work with prudence and
faythfulnesse: as we are taught in the said parables. Mat. 24. 42.


10 The name of the Lord is a strong Tower: the righteous runs unto it, and
is exalted.
There is no man but desires to live in peace, and to be out of danger of his
adversaries. And for to obtain the same, every man according to the power he
has, does arm himself with leagues of friendship, and retyereth into strong
places, and if he can, he will remain in places which seems him invincible.
In old time it was thought that the highest places were the surest, for that
the enemies had not easy access to the same. We may see the same in the
building of the Tower of Babel.

Likewise David signifying the safety either that he had had before, or that
he desired presently to have, speaks of the high Genesis 11. 4. Psa. 18. 3. 34
and 27. 5. 40. 3 and 16. 3.
places and of high rocks, and herein he shows us, that all our trust is
and ought to be set in one only GOD, and when he keeps us, that we are
strongly armed, and defended against al contrary power, and that there is no
violence either earthly or hellishe that can hurt us. Solomon does signify
the same, when he says,

The name of the Lord is a strong Tower, etc. Wherein we have to note, that
the name of the Lord, is not this word, God or Lord, or any other word that
we speak of, for to signify that we speak of God: neither is it also this
writing of four Hebrewe letters, Jehovah, which the Jews do say, is the name
of God, and that it is ineffable: And not knowing what this name of God
ineffable is to say. (The which is none other thing then that there is nothing
either in heaven, earth, hell, depthes under the earth, nor tongue, nor voice
that is able to express the least praise which belongs to God, because of
his great glory and excellency) they observe a foolish and foul superstition,
and dare not pronounce these four letters above said, and in their place they
say, Adonaie But the name of the Lord, is himself, as he is named the
Everlasting, Creator, Governor, and disposer of al things: according as he
is called wise, just, holy, mighty, merciful Father and Savior: Genesis 4. 26.
Exo. 3. 13. 14. 15. and 34. 6. 7. Deuteronomy. 6. 13
and according to the fame of these virtues and blessings which are without
number, incomprehensible, and can not be expressed. The holy Scripture does
show it us. For this word of God ought not to be called upon. He expresses
well this name. And when he would have us to swear in his name, he means not
this word, God, or Lord, in witness of truth. His name therefore is himself,
which is compared unto a strong Tower: not as touching himself, that he can or
ought to be compared unto any corruptible thing, how excellent soever it can
be: but the Lord for to humble himself unto our rudeness and weakness,
does compare himself unto earthly things. As here by Solomon he is compared
unto a strong Tower, for to teach us that as the worldlinges do think
themselves out of the danger of their enemies, when they are enclosed in a
strong Tower: even so, if he keep us, we shall not perish. Now for to obtein
such safety, we must fly al wickedness, infidelity and incredulity, al
slothfulness, and carelessness, and give ourselves unto al goodness, and
with care and diligence commend ourselves unto the keeping and protection of
our God. Solomon does teach us this same, when he says,

The righteous runs unto it, and are exalted. For the wicked, unbelieving,
negligent and contemners of the grace and help of God, are cast off from him:
and thus they are not exalted out of the dangers of their enemies, but are
given unto them to do with them as they will: as diverse wicked men have felt,
and do feel. For if they be not at the will of their carnal enemies, yet are
they at their spiritual, to wit, the Devils: as finally, they shall feel it in
eternal torments, being thrust down into the infernal gulfes.

Let us therefore understand, that Solomon does exhort us ^o love
righteousness, and to delight therein, and that in following Psalm. 9. 16.
carefully our vocation, and walking straight in our ways, iwee should depend
wholly upon the protection of our God, and he shall exalt us high, and set us in
so strong a Castle, that our enemies shall not be able to do any thing against
us: and also we shall not fear them, but holding fast the promises of our God,
we shall say, The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? Be
Psalm. 9. 10. and 12. 6. and 33. 18. 19 and 34. 8. and 18. and 37. 39. and 27.
1. and 31. 2.
unto me a strong Tower, and as an house well fenced, for to save me. Let us
also understand that he teaches us to know who they are that are righteous,
what their reward is. Whereupon we may gather who they are that are wicked,
and what their destruction is. And when he says not, He shall exalt
himself: But he is exalted, he does teach us to renounce our merits and
free will.

11 The rich man's riches are his strong City: and as an high wall in his
imagination.
Albeit that Saint Peter does teach us, that al our strength and safety
stands in the name of the Lord: and that it is also the Act. 4. 11. 12
truth, as diverse holy men have proved, and amongst other the people of
Israel, as they do acknowledge it with Moses, yet the worldlings can not
receive it into their minds, but despising whatsoever is said of the
providence of God, and of the care that God Exo. 15. 1 Psalm. 48. 2.
has over us, do occupy themselves about that which they think, and look
for, and stay upon that which they see, and think they can lay hold on, or
upon that which already they have possession of as they think. The ambitious
will think themselves to be very strong, and to be in safety, if many do
commend and praise them, and bow unto them, if they have credit, and that
they think they are esteemed and had in admiration. We might here make a
discourse of all the vices, and of all the vanities whereby men are so deceived,
that they make their fortress of them: not so that they be truly assured: for
if there comes to them never so little affliction, but that they tremble as
an Aspine leaf, though they show a great brag: for the infallible truth
has pronounced, that there is no peace to the wicked.

Now leaving such discourse, let us come to consider the riches Esai. 48. 22.
of this world, the which of themselves are good, after the use wheretoo GOD
has created them, and it is laweful to possess them, and to use them with
thanksgiving. If we look narrowly how they are used, how they are
esteemed, we shall see that they which are without them, or which have not
enough, do tremble and quake oftentimes, with fear they have, either that the
earth (as it is said) should fail them: or that if strife, dissentions and
wars should arise and be moved against them, that they should not have
wherewith to defend them: on the other side, that they which have abundance of
them, wherewith they are contented as they seem, except they have the fear of
God, and that they know how they must use the abundance of riches that God
gives: we shall see that such kind of people will so abuse themselves, that
they will make of their riches their God, or themselves to be gods: and will
persuade themselves to believe, that none evil, how great soever it be, shall
light upon them, but that they shall overcome it well enough: for they have this
Devilish opinion, that al things obey unto money. And therefore, Solomon
speaking upon their opinion, says,

The rich man's riches are his strong city, etc. Wherein Solomon does closely
reprove the opinion of the worldlings and carnal minded, which think and say,
that the rich of the world are happy and good men: for when he discovers
the imagination and fantasy of the rich, which is, to have no trust nor
assurance but only in his riches: In that he says that the riches of the
rich are his strong city: he shows well that the worldly riches are not
righteous: and so they are not good men, otherwise they would hold the name of
God for a strong tower, and would thereto have recourse and would not imagine
their riches to be their strong city, nor their high wall. In such
imaginations there is no righteousness, but all iniquity, wrong, extortion, and
violencee: for since that they have such imagination, and such estimation, of
their riches, no thank to them though they do not spoil and ravish away the
substance of other. And therefore it is not without cause that riches have and
bear the title of iniquity, and that our Lord Jesus Christ Luke. 16. 9. 13
Mat. 19. 23.
does set them against God, and that he does deprive them of the kingdom of
heaven. Solomon then speaks not of al rich men: for many have been rich,
which have trusted in God, and have served him according to his word: but he
speaks of those which contemn God and his word, and have al their
affection set and given to the riches of the world, of whose number Saint
Paul would not have us to be. Saint James also labors earnestly to 1.
Tim. 6. 6. 17. 18. Iam. 1. 9. and 2. 5. and 5. 1. P^o. 10. 22. and. 11. 28.
turn us away from them. Solomon also has travailed to pull us away from them.
If we will follow and obey them, let us take heed to challenge to ourselves any
force, as do the rich worldly men: even as Solomon does signify it, when
he says, not simply, a strong cite: but his strong City. Let us not also
follow our imagination, for by it we could not give ourselves unto goodness.
As touching the rest, let us note that Solomon does not here pronounce what
the rich ought to think or to say: as has been handled. It shall not be also
unfruitful to note that Solomon has compared the name of God only to a
tower: and here he compares riches unto a City, which is much greater then
a tower. It comes not because that he esteems riches more then the name of
the Lord: but we may say that it is because that the worldelings and carnal
minded esteem more the temporal goods, and are more in love with them, then
are the righteous with the graces and gifts of God: and also that they which
desire and love riches, and thereuppon set their hearts, and trust in them,
are much more in number, then are they that have their refuge unto God. And
therefore, the rich have need of a city, where the righteous have enough of a
tower. Moreover, a city which is often more fair to see too, and of greater
show then a tower, ought to be attributed unto worldly rich men, for they will
be greatly seen.

12 Before destruction the heart of man is hautie, and before glory goes
lowliness.
The first creation of man was very excellent, but he remained not in this
excellency, because that he contented not himself therewith. Ge^. 1. 26. 27.
Eccle. 3. 18. and. 7. 30.
Now although that his posterity did well know that for hautinesse of his
heart he had destroyed himself, and al mankind, yet did they make no count to
humble themselves, and to yield obedience unto their Creator: and therefore a
great destruction fell upon the world: as we have seen in all ages, from the
beginning of the world: the which is yet seen to this day: but the world
does judge such destructions and overthrows to come by fortune, or through
the desire and violence of men: and no man knows and sees that it is God,
who smites, to beat down the arrogancy and hautinesse of man's heart. For
this cause, Solomon does admonish us, and would have us to know that the ruins
which happen unto us, come for the pride of our hearts, when he says, Before
destruction the heart of man is hautie. etc. When he pronou^ceth this
sentence, he shows us that we should abhor pride and arrogancy, not only
that we should show ourselves so by words, by works, by gestures, and
behavior, but chiefly that the root should be such from whence such fruits
do come, the which lies in the heart possessed with hautie and hie thoughts,
deliberations inventions, and desires: but we persuade ourselves that we are
something. Seeing that for such hautinesse, he pronounces that destruction shall
follow, the which we in no case desire, but do shun and fear it, he does
show it (as is said) that we should detest pride so that we might truly say,
Lord, I am not high minded, I have no proud looks. Thus doing we shall abace
ourselves, and walk in humility of mind, the which shall make us honorable,
and shall exhalt Psa. 131. 1.
us up to glory: for the which to attain and come too, we must not labor to
show ourselves, and to put forth ourselves after the manner and custom of the
worldlings, who counterfayting the humble minded, do praise themselves, and
also would be praised of other, either for their riches, or for their
knowledge, or for their race and kindred, or for their credit and authority:
but we must pull down our hearts, nothing esteeming ourselves: and it is
necessary that we should suffer the world to count and hold us as vile and
abiects. For Solomon says,

Before glory goes lowliness. Albeit that many, as Abraham, Joseph, Moses,
David, and others, after having bin despised, yea and persecuted, have been
raised unto temporal glory: yet by our lowlines and humbleness, let us take
diligent heed not to look for and desire the same: but if walking in true
humility of mind, and being cast of and persecuted, it shall please God to
raise us up unto temporal glory, and to make us honorable before men, as he
has done these good men, let us use it as though we had it not. The which we
shall do, if being raised we shall procure and seek the honor and glory of
God, the profit and salvation of our neighbors, and if we have not set our
affection upon this worldly glory, we shall aspire and mount up to the heavenly
and eternal: for also it is the same which does chiefly follow lowlines. And
also the holy Scripture does not teach us how to come unto glory, by seeking
honors and high rooms of this world, the which are good: provided that we
obtain them without desiring them: and being placed, do behave ourselves
therein rightly: but by teaching us to have patience when we are despised,
hated and persecuted in the world, knowing that such lowlines shall not long
continue, and that after the same we shall enjoy inestimable and eternal
glory. As touching the rest, we might here allege that which was said,
Chap. 16. verse. 18. 19.

13 He that answers a matter before he hear it, it is folly and shame unto
him.
They that have nimble and light tongues, and can readily say, whatsoever
comes into their mind, do greatly delight to babble and to reason, to
pronounce vain, frivolous, foul, filthy, infamous, ungodly and wicked
things: and are so swift and ready to speak, that they cannot suffer another
to end his matter, yea hardly to begin: and yet they would be counted wise,
and labor to cast of al shame from them: as though they did well deserve to be
praised and honored, for their readiness or rather hastines, of their
indiscreet babbling. And indeed they which are like unto them: or which affect
such babbling, do praise them, and wonder at them, as though they were very
eloquent, and were an honorable thing, and worthy of praise to have such
nimblenes in tongue. But the holy Ghost by Solomon does pronounce that they
are but fools and unshamefast, when he says. He that answers a matter
before he hear it, it is folly and shame to him. If they will not or cannot
confess themselves to be such in this life, and learn to hear, and to hold
their peace, til need requires them to speak, and that they know what and
how they ought to speak, they shall at last be confounded, and be silent
before the great judge, whom they ought to honor by their tongues, in
pronouncing with discretion and modesty things worthy of subjects and
servants of God. And then they shall know that they were fools and
unshamefast, but it shall be too late: such knowledge shall nothing profit them,
but for greater torment. Wherefore, forasmuch as it is needful to fly folly,
and unshamefastness, and that we should fear to be counted fools and
unshamefast, let us not offer to speak, before we have diligently heard: let
us look first to be disciples, before we take in hand to teach. Let us
mark the Psalm saying not, Come children and speak: but Come, hearken unto
me, I will teach you the fear of Psalm. 34. 11.
the Lord. Wherein he declares that they which offer themselves to speak
before they be taught, have not the fear of God, and that it is not possible
that there should come out of their mouths any thing but evil. Let us then
take heed that we offend not Psalm. 39. 2. Iam. 1. 19. and 3. 2.
with our tongues, etc. And because that it is a great perfection in man, to
rule his tongue well, and that we cannot of ourselves attain theretoo, we
ought therefore to pray unto the Lord, Set a watch O Lord before my mouth:
and keep the door of my lips. Psalm. 141. 3.
It is the duty of subjects and of ignorant persons chiefly to hear.
Therefore let children, servants, and maids learn here to be silent, and to
hearken: but principally for to give obedience unto them which may command
them. As concerning the rest, we might here apply that which has been said
before, chapter 17. ver. 27. and 28.

14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity: but a wounded spirit, who
can bear it?
The afflictions are not only troublesome to them which know not God, but also
to the elect and faithful: as we may see it by the fearfulness and trembling
that they have had, and by the complaints they have made, and by the
admonitions which are made to them: amongst other we may allege Abraham,
Jacob, and Danid, who were excellent men. But albeeit that the flesh is
troubled and grieved and mourns underneath his burden, yet nevertheless a
man of a good spirit knowing indeed that al comes to him from the hand of
God takes a good heart, and bears patiently and joyfully the evil he
suffers. Solomon does thus pronounce it, when he says,

The spirit of a man, etc. Here the spirit, can not be taken for the soul:
for all men have souls, and for the greatest part of them, they do not
patiently bear the evil that God does send them: but we will take the
spirit for that which is contrary unto the outward man: that is say, for the
inward man. This spirit we cannot have of ourselves: and therefore, let us
ask, Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me.
This spirit is the means, the strength and power which causes our spirit
strongly and manfully to bear al afflictions and adversities, which happen in
this life, and do weaken and corrupt it, and causes that we be not grieved
for any defaute that we have of necessary things appertayning to the state of
this life. It is the spirit that makes us not to be effeminate, to be
afraid of our own shadow, for to make us soroweful and to trouble us with
the least hurt that might happen: but gives us a man's heart for to resist
the temptations strongly, to suffer patiently the miseries, and joyfully to
bear the burdens that our outward man refuses and rejects for his
weakness. Behold, how we must understand the spirit of a man will
sustain his infirmity, to wit of man. And also Solomon does give it so to
be understood, when he asks, But a wounded spirit, who can bear it? For
against the spirit of man, he sets a wounded, sorrowful, and grieved, and
which has no might, the which is the spirit or courage of effeminate persons,
which are immediately feared, and quake at the shaking of every leaf, and weep
for the least grief, and faint and fall under the least burden that can be
laid upon them. It is impossible for man that has such a spirit or courage
so weak, that he should be able to bear any thing: seeing that his heart
fails him: neither is it possible for the outward man ever to be able to
resist. Let us then understand how Solomon does here admonish us, that we
should not be afraid for the greatness and heaviness of afflictions which
happen unto us in this world: but that putting our trust in God, we should
rejoice even in the most hardest and troublesome time, being certain that the
Lord will give us a good end.

15 A wise heart gets knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks learning.
It is commonly said, that knowledge is a fair possession: and therefore many
do aspire unto it and look after it, as they think: but yet few people do
atteine it: for many in stead of following knowledge to be indewed therewith
and to obtain it, go backewarde, flying from it as from the pestilence, even
as do the simple and idiots in Popery, when they dare, or will not read the
holy scriptures, nor hear the pure truth, lest they should be poisoned there
with: and as do the mockers and contemners, which will not learn so much
goodness, least they should be too wise, and break their wits. These
fellows, what worldly knowledge soever they have, yet are they ignorant: what
carnal wisdom soever they have, yet are they fools. And thus they get not
knowledge: and so long as they remain in such fantasies, neither can they nor
will they obtain her: for she enters not but into the heart of the wise, as
Solomon does pronounce it, saying,

A wise heart gets knowledge. We expound this same of the pure truth of
the word of God, the which only is worthy to be named knowledge.
Notwithstanding we do not refuse the knowledge of men and liberal arts, which
are gifts of God and serve this present life: but when we have learned them
perfitly, yet are we blind and ignorant still, except we have the pure truth,
and that we submit and subject al other sciences, unto the same. And therefore
for to be partakers of this getting, we must not be like unto brute beasts
which have no understanding, but we must have an heart of understanding and
knowledge. Solomon does teach us what we shall do for to obtain this
wisdom and learning, when he says,

And the ear of the wise seeks learning. This is, that we should have a
true affection to know the will of God by his word, and that for to attain this
knowledge we should become the scholars and disciples of God, and of our Lord
Jesus Christ, reading the scriptures, and hearing them diligently which purely
preach the truth. And let us note that he calls not them wise, which need
not to be taught, but those which have a right affection to learn and to be
taught, otherwise they should not need to seek for learning. Let us also
note that forasmuch as Solomon calls knowledge a getting, he teaches us that
in the same is great profit: seeing also that it is gotten by the wise, and
that he has his desire thereuppon: the which is signified by the heart. And
also that we must not think a wise man will set his heart upon a thing of
nothing and unprofitable. And as touching the utility and profit of this
getting, we have seen it handled here before in diverse places.

16 A man's gift enlarges him, and leads him before great men.
Solomon has heretofore rebuked the covetousness and injustice of
Magistrates, Judges, and governors of the earth. And because Pro. 17. 8. 23.
that such wickednesses do reign and abound in the world, and are rooted so
deep in men's hearts, that at al times and in all countries they have spread
forth their branches, and brought forth their wicked fruits: he is not
satisfied with the foresaid reprehensions: but to make these covetous, ungodly
and wicked thieves, which occupy the seat of God, the more inexcusable, he
does touch and reprove them for this, that the poor which bring the^ no
gifts, are trodden down and oppressed, and as compelled, and not of free
access, but only they which bring gifts are best welcome, when he says, A
man's gift, etc. Here he compares the presenter of gifts unto a messenger
that is thought to bring some good news, or that comes from some great
Lord: they will make those stand back which hinder him to pass and come
near, to do his message: they will give place unto him, and bring him to the
kings chamber, and shall be well received, not only of the mean sort, but of the
king himself and of the greatest nobles of his court. Even so is it with him
that brings gifts: he is will come toward wicked judges, they will not let
him tarry and wait at the gate to catch cold, or for to be preassed and
thrust of with one and then with another, which come and wait at the gate: but
the gate is opened so soon as he comes, and is brought in. He calls
here the wicked judges and magistrates great men, because that God has raised
them up into authority, and that they are in so excellent an estate, that
others are subject unto them: or that themselves Romans 13. 1.
do praise themselves, and esteem themselves so much, that they think none
ought to come near unto the^, except they please. Now after what sort soever
he calls them great, yet does he put them in mind of their office,
teaching them that they ought not to humble and abace themselves so low, as to
become slaves and bondmen to gifts and presents: the which they be, when they
receive them: for they do bind themselves to do that wherefore the gift was
given them, and cannot do otherwise.

17 He that is first in his own cause, is just: then comes his neighbor,
and makes inquiry of him.
It is a very dangerous matter to have to do with an ignorant judge, and such
an one as either knows not his office, or is given lightly to believe one
party, and then cares not for that which may be alleged on the other side,
but will condemn him how good right soever he has: and he that can get
first to declare his matter, shall win the day, though his right be not so
good, and what complaint or request soever the other party can make, and that
he declare how he ought to confer the sayings and the allegations of both
parties together, for to know who has the wrong case and who the right: yet
shall it not be heard by a judge that is light of belief and credit, or
ignorant, or that will be corrupted by gifts, or by favor of persons: and
after this sort, judgment is violated and perverted. Whereof Solomon
complains, saying, He that is first in his own cause, is just, etc. It is
not without cause that he makes this complaint: for the office of judges
requires as well to hear the poor as the rich, the stranger as his own
father, and the last as well as the first: and to judge every man rightfully, and
to have an equal balance for all men: for they are in the seat of God: and as
King Iosaphat says, Take heed what ye do: for ye execute not 2. Chro. 19. 6
the judgments of man, but of the Lord, etc. And this is according to that
which is written in the law. But what commandment soever Deuteronomy. 1. 16
there is in the law, yet the Judges have made no count thereof: as we have
proved. Whereupon also with Solomon have proceeded many complaints and
threatenings that God made by his Prophets, against the iniquity and wickedness
of judges: as has bin alleged already. Following this sense then, we will
take the just, not for him which is so indeed, but for him that is justified,
and to whom right is given, and has won his suit. Moreover we will take to
make inquiry, for to complain and make a declaration, in enquiring how his
adversary has gained his suit, and how the judge has not bin more careful to
examine rightly their cause: or how it is possible for the^ which sit in the
seat of God to judge wickedly. Or, to make request, may be taken, for to make
pursuit, that his matters may be heard and looked over again, and that it may
be taken in hand again upon a new sentence, for to examine witnesses and to
bring forth letters and contracts, for to show that he has good cause. But
Solomon shows that such inquisitions shall nothing prevail nor profit, when
he says, He that is first in his own cause, is just, etc. As some do take
it, Solomon would say, That he which begins to plead against his
neighbor, thinks he has a good cause, and that he is just, and therefore,
that the judge should give sentence on his side: but when his adversary is
come, and the matter thoroughly examined, it shall be found otherwise. According
to this sense, Solomon does show us that we are to much affectionate to have
our cause found good, and are blinded therewith. After the judgment of
others, this present sentence signifies. That the just does first accuse
himself, and then is judged of others: as Jesus Christ teaches him. And after
this opinion we must add, That Mat. 7. 1.
the just suffers his neighbor to teach, to admonish, and to correct him:
because he says,

His neighbor comes, and makes inquiry of him. So we are admonished not to
take in hand to be masters, but rather to suffer as little disciples and
scholars to be corrected, as James does exhort Iam. 3. 1. Mat. 18. 15.
us. Notwithstanding it is not to say, that we must not correct those which
err, as Jesus Christ commands.

18 The lot causes contentions to cease, and makes apartition among the
mighty.
Solomon has taught us before that the lot is governed by the Prou. 16. 33.
Lord: the which is a very necessary doctrine, that we should not attribute
any thing unto fortune, but that we should know how things which seem never
so much casual, or chaunceable, do come to pass as God has ordained, and
that we should be contented with whatsoever happens, knowing that it is the
portion that God gives us, and which is profitable for us: and that we should
be certain that if God did know any thing more profitable for us, he would
surely give it us, as a good father does unto his children. Now when he says,
The lot causes contentions to cease, etc. He does teach us that if there
be any thing to be parted among us, and for the which we are in danger to go
to law, that rather we should cast lots who should have it, then to fight one
against another with anger and malice, with hatred and enimitie. And heerin he
something shows that it was not without cause that God did ordeine that the
land of Canaan should be parted and divided by lot among the children of
Israel: it was a very seditious people, and hard to be ruled and contented: as
Moses and the other governors did feel. But because we have not lotterie
much used now, let us learn by this sentence how Solomon would not have us
to be at discord together, but that we should use the means which God
gives us, for to avoid al strife, and that we should not follow our
fantasy, but should submit ourselves by agreement unto the judge, or other
loving and friendly arbitratours: and that we should stand unto their
judgment, without nourishing hatred and rancour between us. Behold what we
have here to learn. As touching the rest, Solomon makes mention of making
partition among the mighty, to pacify those which are obstinate and hardened
to the law, or to fight one with another, by lot. And herein he teaches us
that the word of the Lord ought to have more authority among us to set us
at unity and concord, then the lotterie: and also that it is far better
that the mighty of the earth should agree by lot, then by violence and strife
to obtain what they demand.

19 A brother offended is harder to win then a strong city: and their
contentions are like the bar of a palace.
If al men, how strange soever they be one to the other, either in country,
language, or lineage ought to be united in concord, peace and friendship by
law of nature, and by how much as they are one like to the other, having
been created one like unto the other, and having like affections: and albeit
they have diverse fathers and diverse mothers, yet are they al of one blood: by a
stronger reason, Acts. 17. 26
brethren which are of one flesh, of one father and of one mother, ought to be
careful to keep and hold together. The which Judah considering, Genesis 37. 26. 27
said, What shall this profit us to kill our brother, and to hide his blood? for
he is our brother and our flesh. And ought rightly to fear to be divided
and separated through hatred and enimitie: for if between strangers, which
agree not, there are discords and combats very hardly to be pacified, yet are
they much more harder to be appeased between brethren. Solomon does signify
the same, saying, a brother offended is harder to win the^ a strong city,
etc. For speaking thus, he shows that if a brother feeling himself or
thinking to be offended with his brother, does revolt from him, and
proclaims to be his enemy, that there is no less, but more hardness to
win and quiet him, then for an army to take a strong town and well fenced
city by assault, or to break open the gates of a palace, etc. And thus the
brethren are admonished here to be very careful to keep brotherly unity
together, and diligently to fly al occasions of strife: and chiefly not to be
like unto Caine, who without any injury offered by Abel, conceived a deadly
hatred, not Gene. 4. 8. and 37. 4.
to follow the children of Jacob, which could not suffer that their malice
should be discovered by Joseph. Therefore let us fly al hatred, anger, and
rancour: for they that are entangled therewith, are of the number of
murderers. There are other literal expositions, Mat. 5. 22. 1. John. 3. 15.
but they al serve to show unto the brethren how profitable and necessary it
is for thm to agree together, if they will continue: for if they be well joined
together, they shall be as it were iuincible. If it be thus amongst carnal
brethren, by a stronger reason, they that are brethren in Jesus Christ, and
hold spiritual unity, shall be fortified against all worldly and hellish power.

20 With the fruit of a man's mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and with the
increase of his lips shall he be filled.
Not only man in the Scripture is compared unto a tree, but also almost every
member of his body, as now Solomon makes the mouth and the lips like unto
a tree, or to his branches, or also unto a piece of land, whose fruits and
revenues we gather. For he says, With the fruit of a man's mouth, etc. In the
which comparison he uses Repetition, saying twice al one thing, after the
manner of the Scripture, for a greater confirmation, and to show, that that
which is said is very certain, and shall out of al doubt come to pass.
Whereupon the faithful, which are well instrcted to speak wisely and purely,
ought to be rightly comforted, and the wicked which talk vanity and lying,
ought to be sore affraide, if they understood what Solomon pronounces against
them: for as touching the faithful which speak holy and honest things, as
prayers, Psalms, and spirtual songues, and al other words which serve too
the glory and honor of God, and to the edifying of their neighbors, they have
a promise that their word shall be profitable, and shall be rewarded so
abundantly, that they shall not want any thing, and shall not need to desire any
more. Solomon signifies this same when he says,

His belly shall be satisfied. For as when the belly is filled with meats and
with drinks abundantly, he is full and desires no more: even so the reward of
the good speaker, shall be so liberal, that his desire shall be accomplished for
ever. For as in speaking truth with his mouth, he has confessed God: even so
also he shall be confessed and known of God in the heavenly glory, wherein
Psalm. 16. 11. and 17. 15.
there is fullness of joy, etc. Contrarily, the wicked which have evil mouths,
and venomous lips, have an horrible and fearful threatening, which is, that
as they do give their mouths and lips unto evil, both against God and their
neighbors: even so also they shall have al their fill of plagues for ever. By
this same let us know that it is no small goodness for a man to govern his
mouth rightly, Psalm. 5. 7. 11.
and also to talk wickedly is no small evil.

21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it, shall
eat the fruit thereof.
Even as by violent smyting of the hands, we kill, even so contrarily, in
helping with them we labor to preserve a man in life: and as it seems right
that the evil we suffer, and also the good which we possess, do proceed
from the hands, and that they are the instruments serving either to well doing
or evil, even so we transfer it from the arm, attributing it unto the
profitable or hurteful member, of the hands: as when Solomon says,

Death and life, etc. He gives an hand to the tongue, because it is a member
that hurts very much if it be applied unto evil: and contrarily it helps
much, when it is well used. This same is known, and is seen by experience: for
in lying, flattering, slaundering and false witness bearing against our
neighbor, we go about to destroy him, and no thank to us which have so
venomous tongues that our neighbors of whom we have spoken evil, be not
slain. Contrarily, in speaking truth, and by the same excusing our
neighbors, which otherwise were in danger of their persons, we have preserved
their life: as Joseph, David, and Susanna, and others have proved it. Also in
having words of edification and wholesome doctrine in our mouths, we lead our
neighbors, who are well edified, unto eternal life. But though Solomon does
attribute unto the tongue, that it applies his hand unto contrary uses, the
same is not to say that he allows that the tongue should be a murderer,
except it be by accident, and against the mind and will of him that rules his
tongue: for there is no tongue so wholesome nor healthful that brings not
death unto the wicked, unbelieving, obstinate and indurate, mockers and
contemners of truth. And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,
and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. S. Esaias. 11. 4. 2.
These. 2. 8. 2. Cor. 2. 14. Ia. 3. 3. 9.
James agreeing with Solomon would have us to apply our tongues, to nothing
but to goodness: for having made a complaint against the malice of the tongue,
he does admonish us not to use it as the common sort of men do. If we will
believe Saint James, we shall have a good reward: otherwise we shall have
plagues our belly full: as has been handled in this present sentence: and as
now Solomon does signify it, when he says.

And they that love it, etc. For we love the tongue according as the
affections are ordered. He that has an evil mind, will delight to have a
venomous tongue: he himself also shall be poisoned with his own tale.
Contrarily, he that has a good heart will delight in well governing his tongue,
for the which, good shall come unto him.

22 He that finds a wife, finds a good thing, and draws favor from the
Lord.
We ought to have the estate of marriage in great reverence, for diverse
reasons. First of al, it is honorable. Secondly, it is not the device Heb. 13.
4. Gene. 1. 27. and 2. 24. Mat. 19. 4. Gene. 2. 18. 1. Cor. 7. 2.
of man, but a work and an ordinance of God. Thirdly, it is profitable.
Solomon does express this same in one word, when he says, He that finds
a wife, etc. For there is nothing good which does not proceed from God, and
whatsoever God does and ordeineth by his word, for to be observed amongst
men, is honorable. But he expresses, yet more plainly that marriage is
profitable, and that it is the work of God; when he does attribute is unto
divine grace, saying, He that finds a wife, finds a good thing, and
draws favor from the Lord. Wherein he compares the grace of God unto a
fountain, pit or river, out of the which we may draw abundantly. And this is
for to show how God greatly favors them which are joined together by
laweful marriage: for seeing that it is so, that he which finds a wife,
finds a good thing, it follows thereof also, that the woman which finds an
husband, finds also a good thing: considering 1. Cor. 12. 3. 8 Gene. 2. 18.
that the man is the woman's head, and the woman by the man. But Solomon calls
the wife the good thing of the husband, respecting the end wherefore she was
created. And in this he admonishes wives privily, of their duty that they
have to give unto their husbands, the which is, to be altogether at their
commandment, and that they might use them with all holiness and honesty at
their pleasure, as the good that properly belongs unto them. Let the wives
therefore obey perfitly unto their husbands. Ephe. 5. 22. 1. Pet. 3. 1.
And also Solomon admonishes here the wives to be fruitful and profitable
unto their husbands, to be of a sweet and loving conversation. Wherefore the
wives must not here be delighted, as though Solomon sang forth their
praises, and would give them to understand, that their husbands were bound to
them: but we must understand that in praising good wives, he reproves,
rebukes and blames those wives which do not give their duty unto their
husbands, and shows that they are not worthy to be called wives, except
their husbands do find in them the goodness that ought to be in them. The
husbands also are here admonished not to despise their wives, but to have them
in good estimation, and to love them: seeing that no man despises gladly the
good thing that he has found: and chiefly, when they which favor and love
us, do offer and give it us. Let the husbands therefore love their wives as
their good thing, and not only so, but much more effectuously, as they are
taught. As touching the rest, let them Ephe. 5. 25. 1. Pet. 3. 7.
that are well married, not think that they have gotten this benefit through
their diligence: but let them confess how it was the only grace of God that
brought them unto it, and caused them to find that good gift. And let those
which find themselves not well married, take heed that they blame not marriage,
but acknowledging their fautes, pray unto God to remedy the evil that is
between them.

23 The poor speaks with prayers: but the rich answers roughly.
When we think we have need of any thing that our neighbor can give us, and
that we hope he will grant it unto us, we speak fair and gently unto him,
and beseech him with all humblenes, declaring ourselves to be his lowly and
humble servants, ready to obey him in all things. Solomon does express this
humble manner, saying, The poor: he says expressly, the poor, signifying first
of al, that when man has need of any thing, and can not come by it, except it
be given him, in this respect he is poor, how rich soever he be in other
things. Solomon then does show us, that poverty does outwardly beat down
the horns of pride, the which is a vice naturally rooted in us. He does also
show us, that we al ought to speak graciously one unto an other: for by our
creation we are poor. And if we be raised Job. 1. 21. 1. Tim. 6. 7. Psa. 24.
1. and 50. 12. 1. Sam. 2. 7. 8 Pro. 10. 22.
to have credit and authority, to have power and riches, this comes not of
ourselves: al comes from God. And he enricheth whom he will: and the
blessing of the Lord makes men rich. And therefore let us understand, that
Solomon reprooueth the pride of worldly rich men, when he says,

But the rich answers roughly. I say expressly of worldly rich men, whose
number has always been very great: and amongst other, we may set Pharao,
Nabal, Roboam, Sennacherib and Nabuchadnezer. The rich which have the fear of
God, are not puffed up with their greatness, neither do they esteem themselves
for their riches sake: and therefore they answer not roughly, but are sweet
and gentle in their words: as were Abraham, and the holy Patriarchs, and the
good Kings of Israel, and others, which have been never the more puffed up
for the abundaunce of worldly wealth: but truly knowing that al comes from
the gift and grace of God, have humbled themselves, following that which Saint
Paul teaches us. They are then the rich men of this world, which answer
roughly, not only in words, but 1. Tim. 6. 17.
also indeed and fact: as we may see by the oppressions, violences and
wrongs they do. Now that we may not be of the number of such rich men,
which answer roughly because of their Iam. 2. 6. 7. and 5. 4. 5. 6. Romans 12.
16. Phi. 2. 2.
greatness and riches, according to that which Saint Paul teaches us. And if
we must thus poorly behave ourselves toward men, by a more strong reason
must we earnestly beseech God, as pooremen, destitute of al riches, but
chiefly of such as are spiritual, and not to be puffed up with bragging of our
merits in the presence of the Lord. Let us truly make the confession that
Luke 1^. ^0 2. Cor. 8. 9.
the Publican did, and let us detest the boasting of the Pharesee. Thus doing,
we shall not long remain poor, for Jesus Christ will inriche us: As Saint
Paul says, Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he being
rich, for your sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made
rich.

24 A man that has friends, ought to show himself friendly: for a friend is
nearer then a brother.
We commonly say, it is a good thing to have friends, and that one ought to
prefer the^ before al worldly treasure: for it is an easy thing, to recover
goods, but not so easy to obtain friends. And therefore if one be careful to
keep his temporal riches, and to maintain himself thereby, by a far
greater reason ought he (when he has friends) to keep them well, and maintain
himself with them in amity, being at their commandment, not in words
only, but indeedes also, and truth. Solomon speaks so when he says, The
man that has friends, etc. Herein he regards, that God in his law, has
not given his commandments for a small time, by the which he teaches us that
which we ought to do to our neighbors, and how we should maintain
ourselves in amity with them. Wherefore let us not think, that Solomon
speaks here of table friends, of play fellows, or other dissolutions, and
wicked conspiracies. But he speaks of the friends which have learned by the
word of God to love, and for his love do love. He shows it when he yeldeth
a reason why one should maintain himself in friendship, and that he says,

There is a friend, etc. Table friends are not so surely conjoined, but they
may be easily separated, by the least occasion that can be. But it is a hard
thing to make those friends which love together in God, and by his word, to
leave one an other: for they are brought to love together by the holy Ghost,
which is a band indissoluble. And so, although carnal brothers fall out, and
forsake one an other, yea, although they lift themselves up one against an
other even to the death: notwithstanding, they that love in the truth,
although they be not natural brethren, yet they have a sure and steadfast
conjunction. Insomuch that they love as much, or more in adversity, then in
prosperity. And so it is said, that in a matter of need, one knows his
friend. Our Lord Jesus Christ has showed us by proof, that thus we ought to
love.

The xix. Chapter.
1 BEtter is the poor man walking in his integrity of life, then he that
abuses his lips, and is a fool.
Here Solomon has no regard to speech, which is an easy thing, and wheretoo
the wickedest will accord in word, to the end to get credit, and to be
accounted wise: but if we weigh more nearly the affections, thoughts,
opinions, and fantasies of men, which are very hard to rule and govern, we
shall know that Solomon says not so without great cause: for as it is daily
seen, the poor man is in contempt, and out of favor with all men: and be
there never so much wisdom, prudence or foresight in him, yea, although it
plainly appears, yet is he rejected as unprofitable, and persecuted as a
wicked person. And they which do this, will persuade themselves they do well,
although the ordinary talk go quite contrary. But men for the most part,
speak as birds in a cage, not understanding what they say, nor receiving
fruit or benefit thereof. And thus while the liars, deceivers, flatterers,
backbiters, sowers of false doctrine, and false opinions, shall have the upper
hand, and be reputed honest, each one shall desire to resemble them, because
they are welcome, and much accounted of. So see we well, that not without
great cause Solomon says, The poor man in his, etc. He knew well that we had
need of such advertisement, because there are very few which make account of
poverty, and much less of simplicity, and pureness. Poverty also is a
thing which of it self ought not to be esteemed: it ought (to the end it may
be of some value) to be joined with a good conscience. For this cause Solomon
has well foreseen, not to say simply, The poor man is better, etc. but he
adds, Walking in his integrity and pureness: for it is that which makes the
poor man, being nothing worth of himself, to be found profitable and good,
without the which he that is poor, can not but annoy and hurt, offend and
endamage: but when he is accompanied with integrity, he contenteth himself
with his estate and calling, and will be right sorry to offend any man, either
in word or deed, still desiring to do profit and pleasure to his neighbors.
And thus, He is better then he that abuses his lips, etc. For he that is
such a one, not only is unprofitable, but also noisome and hurtful. As
Solomon expresses it, saying, He is a fool. For (as often it has been said)
he calls him fool, which is given to do hurt, and delights therein. And
herein he shows, that the peruersitie of the lips proceeds from the
folly or wickedness of the heart. And therefore should we lay away our
wickedness, and walk in integrity: the which is ours only, because it is
given us from God, and therein let us delight. Let no man build upon his own
goodness, although Solomon say, Walking in integrity.

Besides this let us note, that when Solomon sets the fool abusing his
lips, a contrary, to the poor man walking in his integrity: he tasketh
the rich worldlinges of folly, which is the wickedness of the heart, whereby
they deprave and abuse their lips, wherewith they speak in pride and malice,
and give license to their own appetite to speak against God and their
neighbors. Then to the end we merit not to be tasked with such wicked and
foolish persons, let us love integrity, and walk in the same, procuring in
all our words and actions the honor and glory of God, and doing truly to our
neighbors every thing, as we would they should do unto us: so that we may
say, I have been vncorrupt before God, and have kept my self from offending
him. I have lifted up my heart to thee, In thee, my God, have I trusted. If we
walk thus, what poverty, or affliction soever we Psalm. 18. 24 and 26. 1.
have, we shall want nothing: for the Lord God is our Sun and Buckler. The
Lord spares no good from them which walk in innocence. Not because our own
righteousness deserves Psalm. 84. 12.
it. For although David (after recital how God assisted him) says, The Lord
has rewarded me according to mine own righteousness, etc. Psalm. 18. 17 21.


Notwithstanding, he trusted not in his own integrity, but in God only, as
he shows it. Note we also that according to the foresaid exposition: when
Solomon says, That the poor man is better, etc. he speaks of the
goodness of the conscience, of manners, Psalm. 18. 3. 31. 13.
and behavior, as well in word as indeed, and will, that for this goodness the
poor man be esteemed, and preferred before the fool, be he never so rich
and mighty: As also God prefers him. But the opinion of some men is, that
Solomon prayseth more Psalm. 34. 11 Luke 1. 51. and 6. 20. Iam. 2. 5.
the condition of the poor man, then of the fool, and that he esteems the
poor man walking in his integrity of life, to be more happy then the fool
which abuses his lips. This exposition contains truth, and depends of
the former: for if the poor man be preferred by God, it follows, that he is
in good estate, and more happy then the fool.

2 Desire without discretion is not good: and he that hastes with his feet,
offends.
Those which are not instructed in the word of God, but led by the sense of
their own corrupt nature, and according to the appetite of the flesh, have
diverse and sundry desires, and haste, (as much as in them lies) to attain
to the end of them, and to enjoy them. They think still, it is no hurt to
desire that, which they have in their fantasy, although they know not what
the end will be, neither if it be profitable for them to obtain it, according
to their desire. If the world reprove and condemn not such desires, the
holy Ghost cease not to blame and reject them as unprofitable and wicked,
saying by Solomon, Desire is naught, etc. And it is in following that which God
forbids.

Therefore seeing God has given such commandment: it is Exo. 20. 17
not without cause that Solomon blames it. For it is not lawful to make that
good, approoueable, which God forbids, whose only will should suffice us,
for the perfect rule of al justice and equity. Likewise naturally we
perceive, that in desiring we are provoked to strife and debate, if we obtain
not our desires, and enjoy them at our pleasure. And therefore Saint James
does worthily rebuke the covetous. But when we see, that the ancient holy
Fathers Iam. 4. 1.
(as Abraham) have had desires, which have not been reproved, nay rather have
obtained according unto them, yea more then Genesis 15. 2. and 12. 2. and 13. 14.
and 21. 1. and 28. 20. 13. Psalm. 50. 14. Mat. 6. 9. Psalm. 145. 18. Romans 3. 9.
they could themselves desire: He desires it according to discretion, as
appears by the promises, and so he obteineth it, Jacob desires that the
Lord God will assist him, following herein the promise made. David desires
often to be delivered from his enemies, for he knew that God would that he
should reign in Israel. Also seeing it is Gods will that we should call upon
him, and that our Lord God has taught us to pray, and that we have the
promise to be heard, we should and ought to understand that Solomon
blames not al desires: for he himself has wished and obtained. And in this
place he shows it also, when he says not absolutely, Desire is not good: but
he adds to it, Without discretion: as if he should say, That when we
wish for any thing, whereof we have not certain testimony in our
consciences, that the word of God allows it, such wish is not good. It is
without faith, which is the foundation of al goodness, yea the goodness of
our desires, and without the same, it is impossible to please God. And by
consequence he imputes it a sin. And for this cause the infidels are
frustrate of their desires: as many have Hebr. 11. 6 Romans 14. 24.
proved it, and principally the enemies of God, and his people, And the holy
scripture yeldeth testimony thereof. The desire of the wicked shall perish.
Likewise, that it is not good to desire Psalm. 112. 10
without discretion. Solomon shows it, when he calls it sin, saying,

And he that hastes. He says the same that we have expounded, but under other
words, wherein he speaks by similitude. For even as he that runs with
his feet, without any other consideration, but that he come to the end of
his race, and atchieue his journey, falls and stumbleth against them that he
meets, and so does them hurt: so he that is ardent in his desires, and
boiling in his affections to do a thing, not knowing whether it be lawful for
him or no, is not clear without damage, principally of his soul, and he
troubles and hurts others, and so sins. And to accomplish his desires
he does that wrong to his neighbors, which he would should not be done
unto himself, and he does them not that good which he is bound to do, and
which he would should be done unto him, if he were in the place and estate of
his neighbors. And (which worse is) he gives not the honor to Gods
providence: which is due theretoo, for he distrusteth thereof, and has al his
whole endeavor on his enterprise and affections. He leaves God behind, and
puts him back, to the end he be not let to run after his desires,
which he would Psalm. 38. 10. and 42. 2. and 119. 20. 131 Esa. 26. 8. 9.
renounce, and be coye to atchieue, if he had God in his thought, and desired
like the Psalmist, and Esaias.

3 The foolishness of man shall pervert his way: And his heart shall fret
against the Lord.
It seems that the wicked prosper and do their business well in this world:
and therefore they are accounted honest, sage, and wise, which thing they
desire and covet, and enforce themselves to appear so. Notwithstanding in
their business, they never come to the full end of that they desire. And
therefore they streine themselves, be it right or wrong to obtain their own
will, and by this means they mar al. First, for them for they have thoughts
and deliberations, which proceed from the malice of their consciences, the
which Solomon calls folly: Eliphas, guile and sutteltie: and David, vanity.
Whereupon enseweth, that they can profit nothing, Job. 4. 12. 13 Psalm. 94. 11.
but must of necessity be frustrate of their enterprises, and attemptes as one
may see by the places before alleged, and as Solomon pronounces it saying, The
folly of man shall pervert his ways: etc. Secondarily, as much as in them
lies, by their folly and wickedness, they do al manner evil, to their
neighbors whereas they should do good and be sage to profit and help
them. And so they pervert their way, practicing and doing clean contrary to
their office and duty. Then as they are perverse, so God is to them perverse,
not permitting them to come to the end of their enterprise Psalm. 18. 27.
as they would: And when they think sure to have an end of the same, God
ouerturneth al, and makes the wicked feel, that it is he that is troubled:
and disturbeth them to dispose their ways, according to the appetite of their
folly. Yea for that cause, he handles them so rudely, that they know not in
what taking they are, but they feel great resistance, whereat they are angry,
agrieued, and dispited. And although it seem to be against men only that
they would deal: notwithstanding insomuch as they cast their rage against
innocents, whose defender God is: they fret and fume against him, not in words
only, but they bear him a grudge also in heart. Solomon speaks so when he
says,

And his heart, etc. One may well say also that foolish men feeling the
judgment of God to persecute them (because they cannot shun it) in their
hearts, do accuse God of overmuch rigor, cruelty, and injustice: and would
that there were no God. And thus they chafe, and fret directly against the
Lord. One may see these two kind of frettings in Cain, he grudgeth against
his just brother Abel, and kills him: and then he accuses God of injustice,
and dispayreth. Genesis 4. 5. 1. Sam. 18. 8
And Saul bears hatred against David, whom he knew and confess, to be
innocent, and persecuted him to the death: and finally feeling that God had
forsaken him, waxes spyteful, and seeks counsel at the Devil. Judas waxed
spyteful against Jesus Christ, the Lamb immaculate, and soulde him to be put
to death. And afterward through despair waxed frantike, and hanged himself.
Solomon therefore shows us that folly is a great wickedness, and that we
ought to be careful to root it out of our hearts: otherwise we shall be so
unadvised, that if our business proceed not according to our desires, we shall
fret against God to our own confusion. Therefore to root out this folly, it
behooves us to be attentive to that sapience which is taught us by the word,
and by the same to learn, how to frame al our ways, and words, to the honor
and glory of God, and to the edification and health of our neighbor. Thus
doing GOD will prosper our proceedings according as he shall think expedient.
And although we attain not wholly to the end of our enterprises, yet we
shall take well in worth all that which shall happen to us, be it prosperity,
or adversity, and not grudge against God: whom Solomon here calls the
Lord, or the eternal. Wherein he signifies that al things are subject to him:
and that it is meet, that without murmr, contradiction, or despite, al
submit themselves to his will, as to the rule of perfect justice, knowing that
what resistance soever we find or what affliction soever we endure, al
happens unto us by his will and providence. And in the mean while he
ceasseth not to love us, assist us, and keep us. And therefore in steed of
grudging, it is meet that we say with David, That if he say to me, Thou
please me not, behold me, Let him deal with me as it 2. Sa. 15. 26. Psa.
23. 4. and 119. 137. Job. 13. 15. Genesis 3.
seems him good. And with Job, Although he kill me. etc. Besides, let us take
heed of striving to exalt ourselves by ambition and arrogancy, as our father
Adam did, who willing to be like to God, perverted his way, and is fallen from
his dignity, and excellency into a miserable estate: and feeling his misery,
hid him from God, but seeing that he could not escape his sight, he laid all the fault upon the woman, and the same upon God, which is a spice of this
murmuring and grudge.

4 Goods and riches gather friends: but the poor man is separated from his
neighbor.
Solomon says nothing in substance here, but that which he has said above:
notwithstanding he seems at the first show both there and here to have
differed from that which he has said else where. But if we consider these
sentences accordingly, we shall find that this present sentence, is as it were a
declaration, by the which he gives to understand, that many are friends to
the rich, and that is not in truth: for they love the goods and not the
person, but only because he is rich, he says not, Man assembleth many
friends: But goods assemble, etc. One makes many fetches, one has many
gestures, one uses many words, too make a man believe he loves him: and
this while has he his heart fixed on his riches, and goods: And all that which
one says, and does about the person, is no more but draw from it, that which
he loves: that is to wit, his goods, his riches, his substance. One may
know this by experience, for if the rich man become poor, they make no
account of him, yea they study rather to do him hurt, and hinderance, then to
aid and profit him, as also Solomon declares it saying,

But the poor man is separated from his neighbor or freende. Those which should
love him, hate him: they which should help him, hurt him: those which should
assist him, absent themselves from him: they which should defend him, persecute
him: and so in verity the poor man has no freende according to the ordinary
course of this world. And therefore when Solomon speaks here, of the poor
man's freende, he speaks not of him, that is so indeed, for he is
inseparable, but of him that should be so, or that has made semblant to be
so. We see therefore that Solomon speaks 1. Esaias. 58. 7.
not here against that which is spoken of before in the seventeenth chapter,
and seventeenth verse, for there he speaks of the true charity that one has
toward his neighbor, which never changes. And here he speaks of the
affection and love, which men have to the riches of the world, and shows that
man is too unreasonable when he prefers things corruptible and transitory,
insensible and dead, before that which is his flesh, to wit, the image Mat.
8. 24. and 25. 35
of God which shines in man. And not only prefers them before the image,
but (which worse is) before God himself whom he despises and hates, when
he sets his affection on riches. And so has God the poor man in
recommendation, that whatsoever one does to him, he reputeth it done to
himself. Insomuch therefore, that we ought to love God above all things: let
us take heed of despising the poor, and of separating them from us, to set our
affections on earthly things, which when a man onceloueth, he cannot easily
withdraw himself, but pursues more and more. And so by this means it is
somewhat practiced that the freende loves always: for the auaritious loves
his riches at al times, and never separateth them from him: but when by the
grace of God he is changed and made a new creature, following heartily al holy
admonitions of the Scripture which tend to turn us from covetousness. These
things thus considered, we may see that Solomon rebukes the world of
avarice and cruelty: which cannot be in a man without defiance and rebellion
against God.

5 The false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that tells lies shall
not escape.
For our Lord God is veritable, and loves truth, and that in the same he
does all his works, and disposes al things, without any disguising,
coloring, or counterfeiting: he will that we which are created after his
own image, should be his followers, making shine that image in us, conducting
to verity. To the which to stick inseparably, it behooves us to fly and
detest the contrary, which is lying. And though we know naturally that we
ought not to lie, neither to God nor men (for we cannot abide that an otherlye
to us:) notwithstanding in that we are so negligent to do our duty, and that
we incline more rather to corrupt this image, and to deprave our nature by
lying, then to continue, and preserve it in truth. For this cause to waken us,
and admonish us of our duty, the Lord God has given us his law by
writing, in the which by two commandments he forbids us lying, neither to
his dishonor, nor to the detriment of our neighbor. Thou shall not take the
name of thy Lord God in vain: Thou shall not bear false witness. etc. To the
first he adds a threatening, and he ordeineth Exo. 20. 7. 16 Deuteronomy. 19. 1^
a temporal punishment to the false witnesses, by the which he ought to
understand, that perpetual torments are prepared for him, if he acknowledge
not his fault and amend. For thou shall destroy Psalm. 5. 7.
al them that speak lies. These commandementes, manacing and threatening
punishment, ought to suffice to convert us from al lying: but our nature is so
wicked, that it weyeth not one warning.

And therefore, after God had once given his law to Moses: his will was, that
he should write the Deuteronomium, which is a repetition or declaration of
the law. And not content herewith, he has raised up diverse wise men, and
Prophets, who seeing the obstinacy of the world, and the stubbornenesse of
it, have inculced the Law and threateninges by voice, and by writing: as is
seen in the old Testamente. And amongst others, Solomon has done so, as
one may see in many of his Proverbs, and presently in this saying, The false
witness, etc. In the which he says nothing, which has not been said, and
written before him in the law, as we have seen. Nevertheless we judge not
Psalm. 5. 7.
this sentence superfluous, seeing the world is so wicked, that it makes no
account of fearing God, when it is so thoroughly warned. We shall learn
therefore in this manace, that the false witness, backbiter, and flatterer,
that those which swear vainly, forswere, and blaspheme, if they escape for a
while the hands of men, and be supported and maintained, yet they cannot
escape the fury and renenge of God. Also the judges, and governors of the
earth, are warned to be careful to punish such people according to the law
of God. We may comprehend under this manace, al false teachers. For their
doctrine is but lies to deceive the souls, and false witness against God, in
that they attribute not the honor to him which is his, but study to have it
to themselves, and so transport it to other creatures.

6 Many hang upon the face of the Prince, and every one is a friend to him
that gives.
When we think we have need of any thing, or that we covet more then we
have, in that our natural covetousness is corrupted, and of it self insatiable,
we look who they be, that have power to do us good, and who are most
inclined to show themselves magnificent, and vseliberalitie. Toward such men
we play the poor, and humble, we rejoice them, and flatter them, submitting
ourselves by words and exterior gesture, wholly to their commandment. And
because Princes, and great Lords are they which have greatest authority, and
which show themselves ordinarily most liberal, there is preasse to come to
them, and many present themselves to do them service, protesting that they are
their humble seruitours. Solomon expresses this saying.

Many hang upon the face of the prince, etc. This is not to say, that he
teaches us so to do, for although it is meet we be subject Romans 13. 1. 1.
Pet. 2. 13.
and under Lords and superiors: notwithstanding we ought not to hang on
their faces, for herein is naught but hypocrisy, and dissimulation. And such
a one hangs on the Princes face, as dispraiseth him, and mocketh him in his
heart, who hates him and would have him put down, for to be in his place,
if it were possible. For, to hang upon the Prince, is not to do him honor and
reave rence, and to humble himself to him with free courage as one ought: But
it is in considering his hautinesse and great power, his credit and
authority, his goods and riches, his promptitude and liberality which are the
face of the Prince, to play the wanton before him, to seem to love him, and to
bear him good and humble affection, to the end to be supported by him, and
draw from him his riches, and be in credit with him, Solomon expresses this
dissimulation and fair show, saying:

And every one is a freende, etc. For he speaks not of him that is a friend
indeed, and loves at al seasons. He that is such a one, regards not if one
give him, and affects it not, but he is rather ready to give, if necessity
require, then to take. He desires gifts, but when great need is, he
speaks not (I say) of such a freende, but of them whom he has treated of.
Such friends love not the person, but rather hate him, for if one give not them
as they desire, they are so active to take, that they imagine and regard, how
they may get into their hands any thing. They are therefore friends to the
gifts, and not the to person. Although Solomon say that every one is a freende
to the man that gives: and says not a freende to the gift: notwithstanding,
in that which we have said, we have not gain said Solomon. For he speaks
not of that which is so indeed before God, but of that which appears
outwardly to the eyes, and of the opinion that they would one should have of
them, which haunt the rich only to get some of their substance: and so he
taxes the hypocrites, flatterers and auaricious, with whom the world is
replenished. As also he gives to understand by these two words, Many, and
every one. He Esa. 9. 9. 17. Psa. 12. 2. 3. Iere. 6. 13. Romans 12. 9. Ephe. 4.
25. Phi. 4. 8.
makes therefore stilly the complaints which are else where. Al are hypocrites
and wicked, and each mouth speaks lauishly, and still also he warns us,
that we walk in verity toward our neighbors, And that we love without
dissimulation, as Saint Paul admonishes us openly. Also those Princes which
have the power to help the necessity of the poor more then others, are
warned not to be so given to covetousness, that they turn the deaffe ear to
those that have need of their succor and aid: But according to the title which
Solomon gives the^ here (the which in his tongue signifies liberal and free
willed) they ought franckly, and in a joyful wise to distribute largely of
their goods, not to minstrelles, Mirthmakers, flatterers, fools, baudes and
Ruffians, as the common use of princes is to exalt and eleuate them to riches
and honor that are nothing worth: but to the indigent and needy, which are
commonly rejected and despised, yea pilled and polled if they have any thing at
al. Princes and great Lords ought to be fathers to such poor afflicted, and to
comfort them, delivering them from adversity and oppression, to the end they
may truly say with Job, I have delivered the poor when he cried, and the
Orphan that had no aid. So every one Job. 29. 12.
in his degree, according as God has given him power, ought to follow this
which is said of the Prince. For as naturally we have every one the courage
of a foolish and ouerhardy prince: so it is meet that correcting our corrupt
nature, we follow in all righteousness that which a Prince ought to do
according unto God.

Moreover if they which love their particular profit use themselves so, that
they show themselves as friends to them that give: by a far more reason, if
one help us in our necessity, we ought truly to be freende to them that
have pity on us, and to please them, and to show ourselves bound unto them.
For if we ought too love our enemies, by a far more reason should we love
them that love us and declare the same love toward us, in communicating to
us, the goods wherewith God has endowed Mat. 5. 44.
them. If one love a tool or instrument which he finds fit for his
business, which cannot move nor stir but when it is moved, because it is
insensible: by a far more reason, ought one to like of the instruments of
GOD which desire to be handeled and conducted by the holy Ghost, and take
pleasure in doing good. If God (as it is true indeed) love such persons, to
whom he is no way bound, by a far more reason ought we too love them, and
do them service in that they have need of us, and that we may stand them in
steed either with counsel, or with the work of our hands according to the
state whereto God has called us, otherwise we should be ungrateful.

Moreover when we covet to have friends rather then enemies, let us be
inclined to give, seeing that as Saint Paul says, It is meet we remember
the words of the Lord, who has said, Act. 20. 35.
That it is a more blessed thing to give then to take. And if the worldlinges
by vain glory, which is a thing of no endurance be provoked to give and be
liberal, not looking for any reward again: by a far more reason,
Christians ought to be moved too liberality, considering the promise of the
Lord. If we do otherwise, Luke. 16. 9
we are infidels, and cannot worthily receive the Supper of the Lord.

7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him, and his friends and fellows
withdraw themselves from him: He gives credit to words, and gets
nothing.
According to the common experience of the world, it is a miserable thing to
be a poor man: for what necessity soever he has, he shall scarce find one
which will have pity or compassion upon him, and help his indigence, but
rahter flee him and hate his company. Solomon following the same experience,
pronounces it thus. It is a very lamentable thing to see the poor man so
discourteously and cruelly handled. But it is far worse, according to common
proof, when those which are of his own flesh and blood, not only, have no
pity on him, but also hate him. If it be so (as daily experience shows it)
we ought not to marvel if those which think themselves nothing bound but by
neighborhood and familiarity, despise him and withdraw themselves from him.
Solomon expresses this great cruelty, when he says, All the brethren of the
poor, etc. When the brethren are faithful, and have the fear of God before
them, they are careful to obey his law and commandments. And so Solomon
speaks here of carnal brothers and infidelles, which have their heart on
their profit altogether. If they have brethren in necessity, naked of aid
and succor, they cannot see them: for they think that they let them, to come
to their purpose: and therefore they hate the^ and cannot give them a good
word, nor hear any request or complaint that they make, nor be their
intercessours in any matter of weight which will do them good: for they are so
attentive to do their own business, that they think if they should give a
good word to their poor brethren, or hear their requests, or complaints,
or bear any burden for them, it would hinder them greatly. Solomon expresses
this beastly barbarousnesse, and says, He gives credit to words, etc.
Joseph the son of Jacob has proved the like beastliness and cruelty, as
his own brothers confess. But although it be so, and that Solomon rightly
reprove the barbarousnesse and cruelty that one uses toward another:
nevertheless Genesis 42. 21.
what affliction and misery soever the poor endure, to the death, yea, yet
let them not despair, but consider there is a God in heaven, which has care
over the poor that trust in him. Then seeing it is so, that God (who is father
of us all) has such care over the poor: let us take heed that we be not
of those brethren which hate the poor, nor of those fellows which withdraw
themselves Deuteronomy. 15. 4. Psa. 22. 25. and 34. 7. and 69. 34. 7. and 42. 9.
from them. If the poor man utter words, requiring us to assist him, yet let
us not despise his request, as vain or envious, but give him a speedy
answer, not of the mouth, but of aid and succor, according as he has need.

Furthermore, let us note, that where he says, All the brethren of the poor
hate him. This hate is very ordinary, and so commonly practiced, that it is
made a custom. And men way not whether they do well or il, and many hate the
poor, which think it not. But they shall not therefore be excused: for their
own conscience accuses them, that they are not so well affectioned toward
the poor, as they would one should be unto them, if they were in that estate.
And thus they bear not that good will to the poor, that they think they do.
Whereupon ensues, that they hate them, for between love and hate cannot be any
good mean. Besides this, let us note that although Solomon wills us to
answer in words, or give words to them which pray and speak to us: yet
notwithstanding he would not have us to feed the poor with words only:
but he shows us, that if we refrain them in speech, and spare our tongue,
by a far greater reason we will grutch to aid them with our goods, which we
esteem fatre more then our words. Let us not therefore be niggards of
profitable speeches, but let us love principally indeedes and truth. Iam. 2.
15. 1. Ioh. 3. 18.


8 He that has a heart, loves his soul, and keeps prudence to find
riches.
There is nothing that we love so naturally as this present life, and all that
we think, say, or do, tends only to get wherewithal to maintain us in the
same, and keep us in good health, and hearts ease: yet although this care be
natural in us, notwithstanding we prosper not, if we have not the heart in
good plight (as they say) indewed with natural understanding, and that we be
of a quick wit, and foresight. For the foolish and brainelesse sort, often put
their life in great hazard, and in steed of finding goods, loose the same,
and mar al they go about: and if we love so much this brief and transitory
life, and the frail and brickle goods, for the maintenance of the same: we
ought far more to love the heavenly life, and felicity which is eternal: but
of ourselves we cannot come to this love, for we are fools, wicked, negligent,
and slouthful: and so we are loose of courage and faint hearted: whereupon
ensues the destruction of our souls, and way to death: and to love our souls
well, and to enriche them, it behooves us to be prudent in heart, as Solomon
says,

He that has a heart, loves his soul, and keeps prudence to find riches.
But when we have naturally a lack of heart, we cannot have it of ourselves,
because we cannot or will not change our nature. That is the work of GOD: as
we ought to understand by his promises wherefore we ought to pray, Deuteronomy. 30.
6 Iere. 24. 7. Ezech. 11. 19 and. 36. 26.
O God, create in me a pure heart, and renew in me the spirit of
righteousness. And also by that which has bin oftentimes touched, of him that
wants heart, and is loose of courage. And by that which has been touched in
the 15. Chapter, and the 31. 32. we may and ought to understand, that he
possesses heart, which is so instructed by the word of GOD that by the same
he has sound judgment, and good advise to conduct himself, in the fear and
reverence of the Lord, and has a good will, and right affection to yield
himself obedient to God, and helpeful too his neighbors. He that is such a
one, loves his soul, and not as Worldlinges do, and Epicures, which study
to live at hearts ease, and have the favor and support of the world without
any contradiction, or resistance. Such men are much deceived, as our Lord
Jesus Christ shows us. But the man that has a heart, loves his soul in
such manner, that he has a care to govern it according Mat. 16. 24 John. 12. 25.
to the will of God, pressed to endure with patience al manner afflictions which it
shall please the Lord to send. In this manner he keeps prudence which
leads him to those goods, which are proper to preserve his soul whom he
loves.

Now the goods which he gets, is the favor acceptable to the Lord, by the
which he obteineth, that his sins be not imputed to him, but is made
partaker of the justice of Jesus Christ, by the which he comes to
everlasting life. Let us note in the rest that although there be none but God,
which provides of his own mere grace and good will, all that which is
necessary for us for the time present, and the time to come, as well for our
bodies, as our souls. Notwithstanding this lets not, but with sound
judgment, prudence and good advise, we may follow those means by the which
we provide for this life, and do that which is good and necessary for our
health. For it is no inconvenience that GOD doethal, and we be his
instruments by the which he works. What heart then soever we profess, what
prudence or understanding we have: let us reknowledge in verity, that it is
only God which wills and accomplisheth: and to him let us give all praise
and glory in all things.

9 The false witness shall not escape unpunished: and he that speaks lies,
shall perish.
Beteweene the fifth sentence of this Chapter, and this, is no difference,
saving in the end of the fifth sentence, there is Shall not escape, and in this
Shall perish, which is the exposition of shall not escape. And so this is here
a repetition not unprofitable to the well disposed: for they are again warned,
that God greatly detesteth false witness bearers and liars, and therefore they
to be careful to think and say, the truth, and flee all lying. This
repetition also serves to make the false witness bearers and liars more blame
worthy, when they have once despised so many warninges, and not taken heed to
amend.

10 Pleasures are not seemly for a fool: much less for a bound man to have
rule over Princes.
Although the wicked which despise true sapience, and are therefore called
fools, have commonly good store of goods, either by succession, or gifts, or
by their own industry, and that they enjoy them in delight and hearts ease,
at their own pleasure: and that because they spend the time gallantly and
make good cheer: they are therefore accounted worthy to live, and have
abundance of riches: notwithstanding because they have not the fear of God
with them, and be not his children, it were more fit for them to have no riches
at all. And that which they have, they usurp it wrongfully by what title
soever they possess it. Whereupon ensues, that they cannot use it, nor
rightfully enjoy it, at their ease and pleasure. Solomon pronounces it,
saying: Pleasures are not seemly, etc. As when we know any one to be a thief,
and live by robbery, we cannot, nor ought not to allow his wickedness, nor
affirm his life good and honest, but rather judge it disordinate, and
detestable. So before God, who knows the foolish, it is not found fit, that
they live at their pleasure and ease of their flesh although he permit them
as is seen: For there is none in the world, according to outward appearance
that have more their pleasures then the foolish and wicked. And as God which
knows all, allows not that the foolish have their pleasures to the damage
of the miserable and afflicted: Even so, when God has opened the eyes of his
servants and principally those which he has lifted up in pre-eminence, and
given too understand the wickedness of the foolish, they ought too detest
and hate those fools whom they see so at their ease. For they cannot enjoy
the delights of this world without great disorder. And although a man cannot
perceive it always, yet it ceasseth not to boe a great hinderaunce to the
feeble, simple, and innocent of whom the fool makes no account, but rather
studieth to afflict and vex them, pilling, and polling them, or refusing to
pleasure them to enjoy the better his own ease and pleasure. Then if pleasures
are not seemly for fools, who notwithstanding seem fit to enjoy them,
because they are rich or of noble parentage, and in authority, or because
before time they have taken pains, to live lastly at their ease: If to such
people (I say) pleasures are not seemly, by a far more reason it is not
fitting, that inferiors should enterprise ought, against or above their
superiors, to put themselves in their ease, or have their pleasures, to the
prejudice of their superiors. Solomon shows this, saying,

Much less for a bound man, etc. By the name of bondsman he means al
inferiors, as children, household servants, waiting men, Chamberlaines,
subjects and vassailes, which are bound to obey, fear, and honor them that
are in power by Gods appointment, and whom they ought to serve without grudge,
or contradiction, and as much as in themlyeth, work their delights, which are
principally in bearing rule, without resistance, or rebellion. For great me^ of
the earth, and al those that have prehemine^ce as kings, princes, magistrates,
governors, fathers, mothers, masters, and rulers, although they have many
cares, and great travail to maintain themselves in their principality,
notwithstanding they have no greater pleasure, then when their subjects and
Inferiors work no sedition against them, but endure in all humility, their
rule and goueruement: which to enjoy, they take thought and deliberate, they
pain and travel themselves, and spare for no cost, esteeming this as nothing,
so they may bear rule: for they know, that in governing, they may do as
please them, and obtain al their desires, every one being at their
commandment: and thus they shall enjoy their pleasures. The foolish thirst
after such pleasure. But of what power, or calling soever they be, it is not
seemly for them, but rather requisite that the wise bear rule over them and
tame them. Whereupon enseweth that which Solomon says, That much less
servants which are slaves, and of the most vile and abject condition of the
world, are meet to govern and bear rule over princes:

But they and all inferiors ought to humble themselves, and by their obedience
rejoice their superiors, for they ought of free will to submit themselves: as
Saint Paul teaches them in many places. One may also say that if the fool be
in prosperity and have his ease and delights, yet can he not use them as he
ought: Much less can a slave of servile condition, bear rule over princes,
and order them as he ought. Let us note first of all, that pleasures are not
forbidden if we use them soberly, and without excess: for God has not given
riches unto man only for to use them, but also to rejoice and take his
pleasure in them.

And so have the Saints, not only used them for necessity, but Leu. 23. 40.
Deuteronomy. 16. 12
also for delight, and yet soberly, to the end the dissolute and ouerlauish,
should not take occasion thereby to work excess. Secondarily let us note,
that to inoye our pleasures well, and to be capable thereof. We ought to detest
and hate folly, and aspire to wisdom, giving ourselves to the same. For we
cannot have the true use of pleasure, if by wisdom we be not taught how to
use it. Also there is no true joy, nor delight but in wisdom, who alone
makes us to enjoy it, as is above seen. Thirdly, let us note that servants
ought to be content with their state, until such time as they may lawfully fet
free themselves: and whiles they be in 1. Cor. 7. 20. 1. Tim. 6. 1.
service, to think their masters worthy of al honor. Fourthly, let us note
that since the pleasure of princes is in bearing rule, they ought to exercise no
tyranny.

11 The foresight of a man makes him defer his anger: and it is his honor to
let faults pass.
Seeing we are all the children of one father, we ought therefore al to desire
to resemble him: and as he is to us gentle, gracious and pitiful, so ought we
to be one to another: as our Lord Iesucs Luke 6. 36, Ephe. 4. 1. and 5. 1.
Col. 3. 8. 12.
Christ admonishes us, and the Apostle Saint Paul, But we cannot so follow
our heavenly father, if we be not endued with prudence and foresight, as
Solomon shows well, when he says not a man does defferre his anger, but the
foresight of a man, etc. He shows also that it is God which leads man to
be courteous and gentle: For foresight, or wisdom or understanding, is of
God. He shows thirdly, that he which is soon moved to anger, has no
foresight, but is frantike and foolish as he shows it by folly Psalm. 4. 8.
Pro. 2. 6.
indeed. Solomon expresses this more plainly else where, and when he adds,

And it is his honor, etc. He shows that the man well grounded in
understanding and foresight, excels in charity toward Pro. 12. 16. and.
14. 29.
his neighbors, who have offended him, when not only he easily pardons
them, and puts in oblivion al their faults and offenses, but also has
great joy, and esteems himself happy, to be in good concord, and union
with them, that have wrought offense toward him. In this he is a right
follower of his heavenly Exo. 34. 6 Luke. 15. 4
father, who is said to be a pitiful God, merciful, slow to anger, full of
mercy and truth, etc. Besides this, note we that Solomon uses here a
similitude, taken of the^ which have any voyage to make in have. As they that
take no care to break down hedges, or fill up brooks and ditches that lie in
their way, but leap or pass over the^: so if we will work by good advise,
and make our voyage to the heavenly kingdom, let us not stand to examine to
the uttermost, every injury that is done to us, thereby to incur hate,
debate and strife, and to take vengeance on them that offend us: otherwise we
cannot come where we would or should come. For if we pardon not men their
faults, our heavenly father will not pardon us ours. Mat. 6. 14 15. 20
Where one may say, he uses a similitude taken of persons puisan^ and
valiant, to whom it is an easy thing to overcome their enemies, and ouerunne
them. It is fit we resemble them, as Saint Paul exhorts us. One might bring
in here that which is said above, Chapter 10. and verse 12. and Chap. 14 ver.
29. and Chap. 15. ver. 18. and Romans 12. 19.
Chap 16. ver. 32. and Chap. 17. ver. 9.

12 The kings displeasure is like the roaring of a Lion: but his favor is like
the deawe upon the grass?
Solomon teaches here two things principally. The one that subjects and
inferiors should take heed least with their wickedness of life, they do
provoke their princes just indignation against them, and that by holy
conversation, and true obedience, they study to win their favor, and make
that they be to them, helpeful and profitable, as the deawe profits the
grass, making it wax green, increase, and multiply, and keeping it from the
heat of the Sun, which otherwise would burn and dry it up. Nevertheless,
this is not to say that we should flatter kings and princes, and make them
drunk with their own greatness and glory: as the common trick and practice
of them is, which will creep in credit with the Lords of the earth, and make
their own profit by them, in putting back and detracting their neighbors.
But it behooves us only to humble ourselves to our superiors, and yield them
that obedience which is due to them by Gods appointment. Thus doing, if they
be not tyrants, we shall profit by them: and although they be tyrants, yet
God will not let our obedience to be in vain, and altogether unprofitable, but
will make that what inhumanity or cruelty soever they execute against us, yet
shall they not devour us as the Lion does the pray which he holds in his
paws, and will make us prosper, and live at our pleasure as he shall see
expedient. One may see this in Pharao king of Egypt, and the children of
Israel, in the wicked kings of Judah and Israel, and in the Prophets. The second
is, that Kings, Princes, and Superiors are advertised of their duties, which
is, That they ought to be moved to wrath and anger, and rore like Lions in
threatninges condemnations, and punishments toward the wicked, which live
disorderly in dispraising and blaspheming God and his word, and in iniuring
and offending their neighbors. Contrariwise they are advertised, that they
ought to be pleasant, gracious, and courteous toward the good, and to keep
them from injuries, and outrages of the oppressions, and violences of the
wicked, as the deawe keeps the grass from the heat of the Sun. And as the
deawe makes the grass to grow and augment: so kings and superiors of the
earth ought to be careful to make the simple, just, and the innocent prosper,
and principally according to the soul, in rooting out of their country al
reprochful persons, and being careful to cause that GOD have audience by
preaching of his word, and that good order be kept without exception of
persons, and true religion observed. Moreover, let us consider, that if God
would that we should be such toward our superiors, it behooves us to be
far more humble, and reverent toward him: for he is king of kings. And if
he appoint us superiors, and command them to be rigorous, or gentle,
according as occasions serve: we ought to understand by far more reason,
that he is such a one toward men as he declares to us, in his word. Who
desires a more ample declaration, then he has set down, in the sixteenth
Chapter, verse 10. until the end of the 15. verse?

13 The foolish child is the fathers sorrow: and a brawling wife is a
continual dropping.
It likes not many fathers to watch and ward their children, and to keep
them under, to learn them to be wise. They have this foolish opinion, that
they should let them do as pleases them: because being young, they may
spend the time merrily, and live without melancholy. They think that if one
should press them to understand wisdom so soon, they would be lean, and
pensive, dull, and blockishe, and not have a quick wit, to think, say, or do
any thing pleasantly, nor show themselves lusty gallants, or merry companions,
as they ought. And therefore such fathers despise God and his word, and are
also the cause that their children are mockers and contemners of al justice and
holiness, and so they sin against the holy Gbost. For this cause they
receive their payment of care which they have had to entertain their children
in folly, and wickedness: whereat they be grieved and much vexed as they well
deserve. They have graffed the tree with evil graffes, and therefore they eat
the fruit of anguishe and sorrow. Solomon expresses it well, saying:

The foolish child is the fathers sorrow. Hely has proved this:
notwithstanding it is not to say, that if fathers be afflicted and receive
grief by their children, who are not wise, that it proceeds always 1. Sam.
2. and 3. and. 4. Genesis 26. 34. 35. and. 28. 8. 9.
of the fathers negligence: for behold Isaac who has been grieved with the
folly of his son Esau. Behold also David afflicted by his son Absalom.

Solomon reproves not here only the fathers, which do not their duties to
teach, admonish, correct, and chastise, their children in time, to make them
renounce folly, and give themselves to wisdom: but he shows also to the
foolish children, that they are disobedient, and rebellious to the
commandment of God, which will, that the child honor the father and mother,
which is not only to make them some sign of reverence, by gesture of the
body, or by words of the mouth, but that they be indeed humble and obedient
to their fathers, and mothers, doing them honor and reverence without faining,
assisting them carefully, and being wholly at their commandment in the Lord,
as they are bound, and as the holy Scripture teaches them in many places:
and as it has been treated of heretofore in diverse points. But the foolish
child in steed of doing this good and honor to his father and mother, does
displease them, work their woe, and hinder and endamage them, as Solomon
shows, when he says, The foolish child, etc. And herein he gives to
understand, that the child that is such a one, is to be holden unworthy to
live upon the earth: and that Magistrates according as the law commands,
ought to put too their hands and punish him, yea with death. And although men
do not their duty therein, yet God which is just, will not leave such
iniquity unpunished, but will work his horrible vengeance, and most terrible
judgment upon such a child. Wherefore, insomuche as we love our children,
let us chastise them betimes, and that it be not long of us, that they shun
not that ruin. Solomon also shows, that fathers and mothers ought not to
esteem it a thing of small value or little importance, that their children are
fools: but to account it a great misfortune and grief: Not so much for the
damage and dishonor they have thereby, as for the zeal of the glory of God,
and edification, and salvation of their children: for they ought to prefer
this above al temporal riches. Of foolish children has been spoken
heretofore. Solomon adds,

And a brawling wife, etc. Although brawling and contentious wives, and which
lift up their voice on high, to injury and offend Pro 10. 1. and. 13. 1. 15.
and 1. 5. 20. and 17. 21. 25.
their husbands and neighbors, think not that they do il, because they have
this as a custom, which they have incurred either by lightness or pride, not
regarding to render due honor and obedience to their husbands, and humblenes
and humanity (as they ought) to their neighbors, nevertheless their brawlinges
are most hurtful, and cause of great ruin and destruction. Although one prove
it but too much, yet Solomon leaves not to show it, when he compares the
brawlinges of a woman, to the cover of a house, which is so broken, that when
it raineth, the water droppeth in, on the planckes and walls, and rotteth
them: so that the house is ready to fall, and makes great ruin and
destruction. So when women are given to contention and brawling, they are cause
of great evil, as is daily proved: but besides this proof, one may see it in
Iezabel.

In this example we see, that brawlinges light not on them only whom they
are meant too, but on them also, which make them. 1. Romans 18. and 19. and 21.
2. Romans 9. 1. Pet. 3. 4. 3. Cor. 14. 34 1. Tim. 2. 11. Ephe. 5. 22.
Wherefore we may understand, that it is not without cause, that women are
warned to be peaceable of spirit, and Saint Paul will have them to hold their
peace. Therefore to be in silence and subjection, let them follow the
admonition of Saint Paul. Women, be ye subject to your husbands, as to the
Lord. We may see by this that has been here handeled, that it is very
requisite for a father of an household to be watchful, both over his wife and
children, to the end, to keep them in wisdom and modesty. For if his
children be fools, and his wife a brawler, he is double miserable.

14 House and riches are the inheritance of ones elders: but a discreet woman
is the gift of the Lord.
Although God is the Creator, disposer, and governor of al things, yea, of
countries and regions, and that he gives kingdoms Dan. 2. 21. and 4. 14.
Genesis 13. 15 and 15. 7.
to whom it pleases him: and although God had given to Abraham the land of
Canaan, and that the children of Israel were the heirs of Abraham:
nevertheless, after the death of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God suffered not to
be said, that he gave, or would give to the children of Israel, the said
land for inheritance. I say this, because it might seem at the first show,
that Solomon transferred to creatures, that which is proper to the Creator,
when he says,

The house, etc. But the resolving thereof is easy: for one may say that
Solomon speaks according to the phrase of speech of children, which succeed
their parents in the goods which they have possessed and left them. Or that he
speaks according to the law of nature, which is, that children shall succeed
in the wealth of their fathers. But this law is not so natural but that it
proceeds from God, who is author of that nature, which is good and
reasonable. Likewise the order of succession is of his ordinance, Genesis 12. 7.
and 15. 15. and 15. 4. and 21 10. 11. 12. Leu. 25. 44 Number. 27. 6
as we find written in many places. Although therefore God give al things
both to the fathers and to the children: notwithstanding, in that he has
ordained, that the children should inherit the goods that their fathers have
possessed, for this cause the houses, and riches which they leave to their
children are called, The heritage of the fathers.

And herein one transferreth not to the creature, that which is proper to the
Creator, seeing he himself calls it so. And so it happens often, that
fathers travel and take pain, to assemble and get goods together. And for this
only, because they have children whom they covet to provide for. And
therefore one may say, that Solomon speaking so, has somewhat admonished
children not to wax proud, for the goods which they possess, and wherewith
they are enriched, not having traveled for them: but that they know that they
have them by the care and diligence of their fathers, unto whom God, and none
but God gave them. And that afterward by their means, he has put them into
their hands, to dispose and spend with sobriety, and aid therewith them
that taste necessity. But although God will, or permit that children
acknowledge their riches to be the heritage of their fathers: yet he will not
that the principal temporal good of this world be reknowledged of any other
but of him alone. Solomon shows it, when he says,

But a discreet woman, etc. That a woman is the principal temporal riches
that a man can have, GOD gives to understand, when he said, that it was not
good for man to be alone, when he called her the aid of man, and when he
Genesis 2. 1^
made her of one of his ribs.

Saint Paul also shows it, willing that men should love their wives, as
Jesus loved the Church. And we ourselves ought to know it, when by the
woman, man obteineth issue, and is made a Ephe. 5. 25.
father which is no small blessing, as may be seen by the desire that the
holy fathers had to have progeny, and the promises that God made them thereof,
which could not have been accomplished without a woman. By these reasons we
may also understand, that a woman, and principally the discreet, is not the
inheritance of the father, but the excellent gift of God. For first, it is not
in fathers to Deuteronomy. 28. 4. 11. Psalm. 28. 3.
give wisdom to their daughters, although their office be to instruct and
teach them in the fear of the Lord, which is the principal wisdom, and
understanding prudence proceeds of the only grace and liberality of the Lord.

Secondarily, for the most part, fathers are not so careful to find wives for
their sons, for fear of forgoing any portion of goods which they possess.
Or if they do, they search them out rich wives, not those that are
discreet. Although therefore, when one will marry himself, it behooves him
with care and diligence, and with great discretion to regard with whom he
match him, and that he ought not to proceed at randon, nor as one careless
and without foresight, yet when we have found a good and honest party, it is
fit we acknowledge that she is come intierlie by the grace and mercy of our
God, which gives us foresight and aduisement to conduct us rightly, and to
seek that which is good and profitable for us. And in the mean while, he
makes us meet with that which he thinks good. Abraham knew well this same,
as he shows it, when he sends his servant to take a wife for his son
Isaac. And since it is meet we have such reknowledging, those which have
discreet wives, ought to prefer them before al Genesis 24. 7.
goods of the world, otherwise they despise not only the creature, but the
Creator, whose gift they esteem not as they ought. On the other side, if the
wife be discreet, she will reproach her husband in nothing, but in all humility
and modesty, will acknowledge first, that she has no discreetnes of herself,
but of the gift of God Secondly, although it be by her consent that she is
married: notwithstanding, it is God that has joined her to her husband, to the
end that by her prudencie, she be his aid and consolation, taking the care
of the house upon her.

15 Slouthfulnes makes one fall a sleep: and a soul accustomed to craft, shall
suffer hunger.
It may seem at the first view, that this sentence favors them that love
sleeping: teaching them how they shall provoke sleep, and enjoy that which
they love: but seeing that sloth is vain, unprofitable, hurtful, dishonest
and wicked, (as one may perceive heretofore) and that it is not good to be
given to sleep: we ought to know that Solomon argues here the sluggishe,
showing them whereto they serve, to wit, to nothing but to occupy a place,
Pro. 6. 6. and 4. 5. 26. and 12 11. 24. 27. and 13. 4. and 15. 19.
and be as it were a let, and damage. Also he threateneth them poverty and
want, whereof they be well worthy: as has been aforesaid. And Solomon
partly pronounces it heeretoo, when he joins the slouthful to him that is
given to fraud, saying,

And a soul accustomed to craft, shall suffer hunger. It might seem at the
first view, that this conjunction is not agreeable, and that Solomon might
have made an Antithesis, putting the slouthful, which cease and will do
nothing, a contrary to him that is accustomed to craft: for he that goes
about to deceive his neighbor, and make his own profit by the hurt of an
other man, is not asleep, nor yet given to rest, but is full vigilant, and
takes great pains. I answer. True it is, that herein the slouthful and the
crafty, are contraries: but they stick not to agree in some points: for as
the crafty by taking pain, gets and snatcheth away other men's substance.
So the slouthful, by taking his rest, depriueth his neighbor of that succor
and aid he ought to show him. And as the slouthful coueteth much, and has
nothing but poverty and want, and suffers much, as he well deserves: so
although the crafty man get goods abundantly: nevertheless, his frauds and
rapines, will not serve him, but he shall suffer hunger, partly because he shall
never have enough, partly because God will not suffer him to enjoy his desires
at full. And yet although in this life he had his desires to the uttermost, yet
finally, he shall be in extreme indigencie, as is written of the rich man.

Let us not therefore learn to sleep here, but rather to watch: nor to take
our rest, but rather to labor: nor to deceive, but rather Luke 16. 24
to follow faith and loialtie: and thus doing, we shall not suffer hunger, but
shall have such suffisance as we shall be content withal.

16 Who so keeps the Commandementes, keeps his own soul: but he that
regards not his ways, shall dye.
If we take, (to keep the commandment,) to fulfill all that which God has
commanded us in his law, there is none which can keep his soul: for there
is none that can so keep the commandment. Saint Paul shows it well in
diverse places. If therefore we will know how it behooves us to keep our
souls, it is Romans 7. 14. and 83. Gal. 5. 17.
necessary we know, how we should govern ourselves to keep the
commandment. Solomon shows it when he says,

He that regards not his ways, shall die. To the keeping of the
commandments he puts the despising of his ways, a contrary. Whereby we
may gather, that to keep the commandementes is, to have a firm affection to
serve God first of al: and next his neighbor, according as God has taught us
by his word: to have care to renounce al unbelief, and to assure ourselves of
the bounty and love of our heavenly father toward us, by the mean of Jesus
Christ, to be careful to forgo al wickedness, and to give ourselves with all
our power to do well, according as God has commanded in his law. Whosoever
keeps so the commandment, although sinned well in him, and that he be in
great fault, as well in his faith, as in his affections, thoughts, and works,
yet nevertheless his faults shall not be imputed to him, to suffer thereby any
detriment: but he keeps his soul to everlasting life. For doing so, he
loves God, and God loves him, he dwells with God, and God with him.
Meanewhile, let us not think Ioh. 14. 23.
that such keeping of the commandment, is the cause of keeping of the soul,
and that by such keeping of the commandment, we deserve the conservation of
the soul: but only that it is the mean to keep the soul to life
everlasting, the which we obtain because God loves us in Jesus Christ. The
love of God is the only cause of our salvation. Although then, that in keeping
the commandment, one keeps his soul: that is not to say, that for any
dignity there is in us, or for any thing that we think or do, we may
merit with God to be reserved in life. Now therefore, since we understand
what it is to keep the commandment, it must needs be easy unto us to
understand the neglecting of the way, which is contrary to this: and not to
make account of all that which God has appointed us by his word, which
teaches us every thing what we ought to think, will, believe, say, or do:
which things are the ways of God, insomuch as he has ordained them: and
conducteth us in them: and they are ourwaies because we ought to walk in them,
and be assured not to perish, when we persevere in the same. And because that
of Psalm. 91. 11.
ourselves, we do nothing but err and go out of the way, we ought to pray,
Lord, make me understand thy way, and teach me thy footepathes. And to
acknowledge in all humility. Lord, Psalm. 25. 4. Iere. 10. 25.
I know that the way of man is not in himself, if we do otherwise, we
regard not our ways: and so we cannot assure ourselves that our life shall be
saved, but we must look for death. For he that regards not his ways shall
die.

One may also apply this sentence to life and death temporal, for if we be
ohedient to our rulers and governors, they are bound to preserve us from the
violence of the wicked. Contrariwise, if not making count of doing our duty,
we live dissolutely, their office is to use the sword against us, For he is
the Minister of GOD for thy wealth: but if thou do evil, fear: For he
bears not the sword for naught, for he is the minister of God too take
vengeance on him that does evil. Romans 13. 4.


Note we, that although it behooves one to renounce himself, too keep his
soul, notwithstanding he must not renounce his ways, but those which he
has followed, obeying Mat. 16. 24.
the corruption of the flesh. Such ways are displeasaunt unto GOD, and
because of them, the Son of God has suffered death. And seeing it was
needful and necessary that the Lamb immaculate, should be so cruelly handled
to deliver us Genesis 6. 5. Isa. 53. 4.
from the eternal perdition, which we had deserved by our corrupt ways, it is
good reason that we hate and abhor them, and that we retire ourselves from
them, making our ways good. Thus doing, we shall not despise our own ways, we
shall not go astray Iere. 7. 3. and. 18. 11. Eze. 18. 23 and 33. 12. Ps. 1. 1.
and 119. 1.
from that which God demands of us. And so we shall not dye, but be blessed
and happy.

17 He that has pity upon the poor, lends unto the Lord: and look
what he lays out, it shall be paid him again.
Our good God bears great love and favor toward them that are poor and
needy: as the holy Scripture testifies, and as has been alleged in the law
in the Prophets and Apostles of foretime. But men make no account of their
aduertisements and admonitions, neither do they fear their complaints and
threatenings, as is seen by the small account that they make of the poor, by
the oppression, outrage, and violence, that the poor strangers, orphans, and
widows endure. And that which is cause, why these poor are so despised,
rejected, and misused, is the malice, ingratitude, and cruelty of men, who are
so ready to their particular profit and so greedy of gain, that they think
if they pill not the^, which cannot defend themselves, they make not their
market half well: and if they should aid the weaker sort any whit at al, or
give any alms to the needy, who have not wherewithal to requyte it again,
they should sustain great loss and never be able to recover it. Thus by
their disordinate desires, they tend still to augmentation, at least wise they
cannot suffer any appearance of diminition or loss. But such people are abused,
as Solomon shows saying, He that has pity upon the poor, etc. When one
lends to an honest man, he fears no loss, but hops, and is as it were
assured that he will not be ungrateful, but will acknowledge and confess the
pleasure which he has done him, and restore willingly that which he has len
thim, yea with profit, and will yield some recompense for the pleasure which he
has done him: By a far more reason ought we to be assured, that when we
have done any good to the poor, we shall not loose it, but it shall be restored,
and we shall have a very good recompense: for we have not done it unto a man,
but to God, who takes it not on this condition, never to restore it again:
but as pure and loyal, ready to yield it again, which he will do certainly,
yea with usury, by a manner of speech: as Solomon expresses it by
Retribution. For this cause we ought to be ready and most willing to
benefit the poor, as Solomon strives to teach us here. And therewithal
declares unto us, first the honor which God does to them, which have pity on
the poor, and do them good, giving them the title of pitiful, which is
properly to him alone: for he alone does benefit us, not being bound thereto:
and we can do no good but what we are bound to do, and should not once
think to receive any recompense for the same again: but rather should
acknowledge that we are unprofitable servants, to think that any one is
bound to us. Our Lord Jesus Christ shows this well. Luke 17. 7.
But our good God gives us such titles to advertise us, that we be his
folowers, and as we would that he should do unto us, so we should do to
others, being certain that he will recompense us well. He declares secondly,
that God requires not of us with rigor that which is his, but he takes it
by borowing, Mat. 5. 7. Luke 6. 36.
to the end to restore it, as though he were bound thereto, although to him al
things appertain. And so to speak properly, it is God which lends, or
rather gives us al things to use and dispose, and distribute to his family,
and we can neither give nor Psalm. 24. and 50.
lend to him. Notwithstanding, this is not to say, that Solomon speaks not
well, when he says,

One lends to the Lord. For one may say, that he iesteth with us, because
of our rudeness and ignorance, as a mother does with her children: to give us
more easily to understand, how ready the Lord is to benefit us, when he
reputeth that which is his own, to be lent him by us, and will restore it to
us as though he were bound theretoo, and as though he had some thing of ours
in his hands.

A man may also say, that he speaks after our manner of speech. For when we
have given any thing to any one which is not base conditioned, and that we
hope he will acknowledge it, and render us again the like or better, we say,
that we have lent him it. Or if one have given us any thing, and that we be
willing to requite it again, we say, that we have but borrowed it.

Thirdly, he declares unto us the liberality of our God, when he says,
That he will restore, the retribution to him that shall have lent. For of his
grace, he makes himself as detter, when it is said, That he will restore. It
is meet to understand and say, that it is of his grace, seeing he can be in
debt to no body, and al are in det to him, and there is none that can pay
that det. And as if one had done him some great pleasure, and had merited to be
recompensed therefore, he promises retribution, declaring that he will not
only render that which has been lent him, but also will give hyre, and profit
to him which has lent it him. Retribution is made first in this world, when
God does give suffisance and contentment to them that are pitiful to the
poor, although it seem often, that they have but little.

Secondly, it is made in the last resurrection. For the rest, because mention
is made here, of restoring, and retribution: the arrogant Psalm. 37. 9. 16. 17.
Mat. 25. 34.
dreamers, which demand recompense of their good deeds, would here found
their merits, and say, that in doing good, they gain the kingdom of heaven.
But it is an easy thing to show them that they are abused: for seeing the
heavenly kingdom is the retribution, and inheritance of our father, which he
has prepared for his children before the foundation of the world, it
follows, that one can not merit it: for we were not before the foundation of
the world, and so children cannot merit the inheritance of their father, what
service or duty soever they do to him. For they neither do, nor can do any
good to their father, which they are not bound to do. If it be so with men,
which can leave their children but temporal things, and of small enduraunce. It
is not fit that we should be so arrogant, as think to come to the heavenly
kingdom by our merits, and bind God to us, to give it. But the kingdom of
heaven is called hyre, reward, or retribution, because it follows our pains
and labors, our works, and good deeds: not that they are worthy thereof,
but that it pleases God so to accept them, and that he himself makes them,
For it is God that woorketh in us both the will and deed, Phil. 2. 13.
according to his good pleasure.

Hereby we have a good argument to know, that retribution comes not by our
merits, but by pure grace, and liberality. Also it would be no
inconvenience to say, that the scripture speaks of God according as one
speaks of Kings and Princes, which use great liberality, and give great
gifts and presents for their pleasure, to those which have done them but a
small service. One may say of such Lords, that they have well rewarded them,
but one can not say, that they have deserved it. If therefore it please our God
to use great liberality toward us, and to call it, reward, let us
acknowledge, that we have not deserved it, but that it is his good pleasure to
deal so with us.

18 Chastise thy son, while there is hope: and let not thy soul spare for
his crying.
Solomon has already often warned children to receive the instruction and
correction of their fathers and mothers: and has showed fathers and mothers,
that they ought to instruct and chastise their children betimes, if they love
them: for otherwise they hate them, which is a thing against nature. For one
loves naturally his own blood, and principally him that is sprung of his
entrails.

Now although it be a thing very hard, and almost impossible that a father
should not love his child: notwithstanding, some stick not to fail often in
this love, in making themselves believe they love their children, and in the
mean while by flatteries, and pardons, or by great liberty and license, they
let them be lost: which is a good argument that they love them not as they
ought to do. And because this thing is so usual, Solomon is not content to
have said:

He that spares the rod hates the child: but he that loves Pro. 13. 24.
him, chasteneth him betime: but to teach fathers, what they ought to do with
their children whom they love, he commands them expressly, Chastise thy
son. How one ought to chastise, has been treated off in the place before
alleged. It rests to know when one should chastise. Solomon shows it,
saying, When there is hope, to wit, that the child by chastisement, may come
to amendment: which is, when the child is yet tender of age, and not
accustomed nor hardened to ill doing, nor has not learned to despise his
parents, nor mock at their admonitions, corrections, menacinges, and
scourgings. This is the time whereof Solomon speaks in the place aforesaid.
And to the end that the child become not a mocker and contemner, obstinate
and stifnecked, and that al hope of amendment pass not: Solomon will not that
one suffer them to rage, exclaim, make noise and murmr, in rebelling either
in high words, or outrageous and violent deeds, but that without delay, they
be reprehended as soon as the fault is spied, be it never so little: we
should understand this, when Solomon says, And let not thy soul spare for
his crying. Some say, Have no regard of his crying. Cease not to chastise him
although he cry. Some, And let it not enter into thy thought to kill him. For
Magistrates are ordained to take revenge on the child that will not be ruled.
Because the Hebrewe tongue endures such diversity of senses, which
nevertheless are not contraries, it is free for every one to follow which he
will. And this while, let us not be of the opinion of them, which say, that
one ought not to chastise children with rods, for that is inhumanitie. Then
if such chastisement be inhumanitie: we may say by far more reason, that
God has taught fathers and mothers to be cruel. When he will have children
that will not be ruled, to be put in the hands of Justices, to be punished
with death: and by consequent, one should accuse God of cruelty, which is no
way lawful. They that will not have them chastised with rods, build upon
this passage of Saint Paul (If at leastwise they read the Scriptures,) to
wit, And you fathers, provoke not your children to anger, but bring them up in
instruction, and information of the Lord.

Here the Apostle forbids not the rod, but he will that the correction be
moderate, and that fathers be not cruel, nor furious toward their children:
for too great rigor is cause that Ephe. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21.
children hate their parents, and that they rebel against them, and retire
themselves from their yoke and subjection, that they loose their courage, and
have afterward no heart to do well.

19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: although thou once deliver
him, yet his anger will come again.
Many think they cannot do their business half well, nor come half so soon
to the end of their enterprises, if they be not angry bitterly against them,
which resist them, or let them to do as they will: and take no heed if they
have just cause or no, to be so angry, but they fret and fume, as though they
were mad. Of the which number one may first put Caine, who has well showed to
his brother Abel, that he was a man of great anger, when he slew him. He
thought by this means to do as he would himself, and to live at his hearts
ease, thence forward: but he has had the pain, and torment thereof as
appears. In the second place one may put the brethren of Joseph. They have
felt the pain of the great anger which they bare against the said Joseph, as
they Genesis 4. 8. 11.
themselves confess. We will set down Pharao King of Egypt in whom this
sentence has been more and manifestly verified, as is seen from the beginning
of Exodus, to the end of the 14. Chapter. One may see that he has borne
great anger against the children of Israel, for the which cause he has
received great wounds, from the which he has been delivered by the prayers
of Moses: but he has not ceased to return to his ire and fury, until such
time as he was drowned in the sea. Also one may set down here al thieves and
murderers, which thirst after man's blood, who ought to be punished by Kings,
Princes and Magistrates: for if one pardon them, they cease not to do so
again, as is commonly seen to come to pass.

Let us understand therefore that we are warned to eschew anger, if we will
be free from pain, punishment and torment. Also Kings and Magistrates are
aduertized, that they profit nothing when they give pardon to the wicked: and
therefore they should let them suffer punishment. Some join this present
sentence, to that going before, according to the third exposition, saying,
That if the fathers anger be so great toward his son, that he thinks to
kill him: this anger or fury, is greatly hurtful to him, but he ought to spare
him, in hope he will amend* And indeed it is not good, that a father of an
household, should yield himself to anger for every matter or trifle, either
against his children or his servants or neighbors. For the anger of man Iam.
1. 30.
fulfilleth not Gods justice. So in what sense soever we take this present
sentence, we are admonished to be gentle, meek, and tractable. Yea, when by
our meekness and gentleness, we omit nothing of that which is our office,
but serve to the glory of GOD, and edification of his Church: and in as much
as we can, convert souls to God, and serve to the augmentation of the
kingdom of Jesus Christ our Lord.

20 Give ear unto counsel, and take correction: that thou may be wise in
thy later days.
We are all by nature not only ignorant, and brutishe, but also foolish, and
wicked, and neither will, nor can of ourselves change and amend ourselves, nor
better our estate.

Notwithstanding, we have not such opinion of ourselves, nor take it not in
good part, that others should account us so, but strive and study to make us
be thought good and wise, and covet that our neighbors should esteem us so.
Whereby we are very much abused: but the abuse is not such, but it may
easily be remedied, as Solomon shows us, saying,

Give ear unto counsel, and take correction: that thou may be wise in thy
later days. He teaches us what we have to do to dispoile ourselves of
ignorance and brutishness, to fly from folly and wickedness, to the end
that at leastwise we become wise in the latter days. And to do the same, he
proceeds by degrees. First, he gives us remedy against ignorance and
brutishnes, when he admonishes us to give ear to counsel. For the counsel
whereof he speaks, is the word of God, which (as has been diverse times
spoken of) is our wisdom and understanding, of the which we participate not
but by the holy Scriptures. Whereupon ensues, that Solomon inuiteth us to
the reading and hearing of Sermons, wherein the holy Scriptures are declared
us: this is the first degree: as we ought to understand by Moses and the
Prophets, when they inuit us so often to hear the word of the Lord, yea,
before al other things. It is the right entry, to come to true wisdom.
Secondly, he gives remedy for folly and wickedness, when he would have us
to take correction: which is to say, That we hearken to the word of God so
attentively, and with such affection, that the threatenings therein pronounced
against us, make us to tremble: that we have fear and horror at the
judgments which they show us to have been executed against the wicked, and
of that they shall sustain in the time to come. And that the admonitions,
exhortations and warnings, make us ashamed of our life passed, and to bear a
special hate to wickedness, whereto we have not only been inclined, but also
given and addicted, and that we take pleasure to amend our life, in walking in all honesty, holiness, and justice.

Behold what it is, to take correction, as may be gathered by many places of
these Proverbs. But one may say, that they which walk by these two degrees,
are wise, as has been seen heretofore in diverse points of this book. The
answer heereto is, that Solomon means, that one hereby aduaunceth himself
further in wisdom, and increases therein successively, and is in way to
give certain proof thereof, and to bring forth fruits. There is also an
other difficulty, which is, that Solomon seems to be content, if we be wise
in our later days. Whereunto we answer, that indeed it is better we be wise
late the^ never, as may be seen by the thief: but we are not promised, that
when we have spent al our Luke 23. 40
life in pleasures of folly, and naugh tinesse, God will afterward give us
the grace to amend, and follow true wisdom. And Solomon gives us hope of
nothing which has not his foundation on the promises of God. And therefore
when he says,

In thy later days, etc. Let us take it for all that time wherein we are
called to faith and repentance, we may well call it, The later days: for first,
after being once called, it is not meet we return to our first estate of
folly and wickedness.

Secondarily, the days of man are short, and he lives (by his will) longer,
in folly and wickedness, then in wisdom and goodness. Wherefore one may
well call his later days, the time which he applies in wisdom and well doing.
Let us note finally, that it is not to be marvelled at, if in the world there
be many fools, and few wise men: seeing they will not follow the counsel of
Solomon.

21 There are many thoughts in the heart of man: but the counsel of the Lord
shall stand fast.
There is none of us which desires not to be in good estate, and have
prosperity of long endurance, but man of himself cannot attain to it in this
world: also there is nothing under the Sun which is not subject to change, as
is daily proved: yea Kings themselves which are puisant and mighty, have not
their estate permanent.

Notwithstanding, man thinks not so, but he deemeth himself not of so small
value, as to take upon him an estate of no endurance, Dan. 2. 21.
rather al they which are come to any degree of prosperity, say naturally in
their hearts, that they will never stir nor move, and al because they have
tasted no adversity: but it happens often, that they are frustrate of their
opinion: which is cause that they think, and rethinke, they take new counsels
and make many deliberations, as Solomon expresses, saying,

There are many thoughts in the heart of man: when he speaks so, it is not to
say, that he allows so many thoughts to be in the heart of man, but rather
blames them, and shows that they are vain, when he sets against them
the counsel of God, saying,

The counsel of the Lord shall stand fast. He argues and reprooueth those,
which of themselves will govern themselves, and place them in estate, stable,
and permanent: and to come to the end thereof they think, consult, and
determine often, and in many sorts: and this without asking at the mouth of the
Lord, without craving counsel at him, and aresting themselves at his word. It
seems to them that they are but too wise, to know how to set in order and
sure estate their business. Such rash headed and arrogant fools ought well to
be reprehended, whereon they esteem themselves so much, and despise so boldly
the eternal wisdom, without the which we cannot but go astray, stumble, and
fall. There are also in the scripture many complainres and threateninges
against such arrogant fellows. Contrariwise, he promises a sure estate Job.
12. 13. Ioh. 5. 12. Psa. 33. 10. Isa. 8. 9. Iere. 11. 7. Leuit. 26. 3. Deuteronomy.
28. 1. Psa. 33. 11.
to them, which renounsing themselves and al their own counsel, take the
counsel which God has ordained them by his word, which teaches them to
yield a voluntary obedience to the Lord, and to cleave to his gooduesse and
mercy, not any thing doubting of his fatherly love toward them. He makes
not this promise of himself, but following the holy Scripture, he has also
regard to that which is said, The counsel of the Lord shall stand for ever.
And so, we take not here the counsel of the Lord for his eternal wisdom:
by the which before the foundation of the world he has ordained al things. This
counsel is secret, and to us incomprehensible. Nevertheless we should not
stick to confess that such counsel is, and shall be firm, as Esaias confesses
it. Also of the firmness of this counsel depends the firmness of that
Esa. 40. 12. Romans 11. 33. Esaias. 25. 1. Romans 16. 25. Ephe. 1. 9.
which is given us daily by the word: for when the word is pronounced to us,
it is because God has so ordained it before the beginning of the world. By
the revelation of this secret, the elect of God are delivered from vanity, and
made firm and stable.

22 That which is desirable in a man, is his upright dealing: insomuch that the
poor man is more profitable then the liar.
Although we be wicked of nature, and many persevere obstinately in their
malice and naughtiness, taking delight to profit themselves by the hurt of
others, in deceauing, polling and robbing, and despise to order themselves by
upright dealing, notwithstanding if they have any thing to barter or use
traffic with their neighbors, that which they most desire in them is,
upright dealing, and that they will not seem to deceive them: for although they
be worth nothing, yet they have a certain fear to deal with cousoners,
liars, hypocrites, and dissemblers, be they never so rich, and diligent in
doing their business: yea they love better to have to do with a poor man
naked of all goods: with whom they think to profit more then with the liar,
dissembler and deceiuer be he never so rich. Solomon expresses well this
same, saying,

That which is desirable in a man is his upright dealing. If this sentence be
practiced and verified any whit by the wicked, that is not say, that it should
not be practiced in all things, and principally in things of weight, and
excellency. As if there be a question to chose, or make a King, Lord,
Magistrate, or governor in a country, it is meet to desire upright dealing,
as Iethro shows: also we may gather it out of many places of the Psalmist. It
behooves us not to be scrupulous about the poorness of the person as GOD
shows well to Samuel, when he appoints him to anoint David King over
Israel: we ought also to understand it by that which Exo. 18. 21. Psalm. 2. 10
and 72. 1. 12 and 82. 1. and 101. 1. 1. Sam. 16. 1 12 Eccl. 4. 13 and 9. 13
is said else where. It is not fit therefore to have regard to nobility or
riches, nor auncientnesse of race, and family, but to desire upright dealing.
Likewise if there be question to choose Ministers of the word of God, it is
right necessary to desire upright dealing because they have the government of
souls, which have bin bought so dearly and preciously. Also one can give no
judgment of a man's upright dealing, but by his former conversation, whereof one
has certain proof. This first part of this sentence may be expounded
diversely, because of one word which has diverse significations in the Hebrew
tongue, to wit, mercy, shame, religion, reproach, and defame: but leaving the
diversity of expositions aparte, let us learn herein, that as we would our
neighbors should use upright dealing toward us, and not disguise themselves
any way: So we should do the like toward all men.

23 The fear of the Lord brings a man to life: And he that it is filled
with the same, lodges where no plague shall visit him.
God greatly recommendeth unto us his fear: as is seen in the Law, the
Psalms, and Prophets of whom we are often admonished Deuteronomy. 4. 10. Psalm. 22.
24.
to this fear.

Now although the fear that he demands, serve to his glory:
notwithstanding he demands it not, for any profit that he shall reap
thereby: for he has no need of us, neither can we profit him any way. But
he demands it to the end, we be advanced in goods, and honor, not only
frail and transitory, but chiefly, heavenly, and eternal. Solomon signifies
it by this word Life, when he says, The fear of the Lord brings a man to
life. True it is, that Superiors ought to keep from al wrong and violence,
those which fear God, to the end they may live in peace, and tranquillity
serving God. And Moses in many places, promises longlife upon earth, to them
which keep the commandments of God.

Whereupon the Apostle Saint Paul building, says, That the fear of God is
profitable in all things having promise of life present, and also of life to
come. Nevertheless, seeing that the life present is common to men with beasts,
and that the wicked oftentimes live in this world, more happily according to
the outward appearance then the good and faithful which have the fear of the
Lord before their face: for this cause when we have promise of life, we
understand that the life present is not but as it were a show of the life to
come, and that we ought not to stay therein, to make our dwelling here
below, as in our heritage: but we must aspire on hie to heaven, where their
life is, that fear god, following the faith of the good fathers. And that with
firm assurance we say with Saint Paul. We are not we cried: but although.
etc. Aso we know that if our earthly house of this Iodging be destroyed, Heb.
11. 13. 2. Cor. 4. 16.
we have an everlasting house in heaven, which is not made with hands. Saint
Paul inuiteth us to aspire to this life. Since therefore it is above, which we
ought to aspire to, know we, and be we Col. 3. 1.
assured, that when life is promised them which fear the Lord, it is meant
chiefly eternal life. Contrariwise when we see the threateninges which are
spoken against them, which are without the fear of God, know we, that they
shall not live, but death shall swalowe them eternally, with that, that from now
many begin their Psa. 55. 20. 24.
hell, partly because their own consciences reprove them: and they cannot rest
therefore, partly because they are afraid of the judgments of God. Whereby
they despair, not seeing any way how they shall escape them: and partly
because they have often great miseries and afflictions, wherewith they are
tormented greatly, not knowing that he is God which afflicts them justly.
Caine was Genesis 4.
the captain of such people, also he began his hell in this world: as may
be seen by that which is written of him. Pharao may well come next after, as
is seen in Exodus, by the plagues which GOD sent him, and by the
acknowledgement which he made of his wickedness, in the which notwithstanding
he remained indurate and hardened. Let us put Saul in the third place, who
pursued David unjustly against his conscience, as is also seen by his own
confessions. 1. Sam. 24. 18. and 28. 7. and 31. 4.
Also God has sent him great miseries and afflictions, from the which, seeing
he could not escape, he had recourse to the Devil, and dispaired and slew
himself: we see therefore what a miserable thing it is to reject the fear of
the Lord, for to give ones self to wickedness: and contrariwise, that there
is great felicity for them which through the fear of the Lord do hate and
detest iniquity, and covet to render true obedience to God, according as he
demands by his word, and to be also at their neighbors commandment, asswel
for the edification and health of their souls, as for the commodity of this
life. Solomon expresses also in other words this felicity, saying, And he
that has the same, lodges, etc. In the which he shows us, that to be
happy by the fear of the Lord, is not enough to fear him in any one part of
our conversation, and in the rest to be given to follow our own fantasies:
as those which feared the Lord, serving likewise their gods: and as the
Papists do, which are followers of this foresaid kind of men: for they make
a show of fearing of God, in that they follow 2. Romans 17.
his word some what, and principally in this that they have observed baptism,
and that they use some loyalty one toward another: for the rest, they are
abominable in their Ceremonies and services which they call divine, being
indeed diuellishe: and they are also abominable in their wicked traffiques,
frauds, and cousonages, in their oaths and blasphemies. Therefore they obtain
felicity by the fear of God, it is not enough to use some fair appara^ce of
holiness, in contemning all the abuse, and abomination of superstitions and
Idolatries, of Painims, Papists, and other infidelles, frequenting sermons of
the word, and communicating the Sacraments: and in the rest to be Athiestes
in our hearts, and our mouths replenished with evil talkings, our affections
burning with avarice, we embrased with hate and rancour, and wholly given to
frauds, cosonages, and other abominations.

But it is meet, that as a man which desires to be whole and sound of body,
follows willingly the counsel of a good Physician, and to fill and satisfy
himself, eats not but good meats convenient and proper to engender blood,
and rejects al others which are not proper to mingle with the good. Even so
we should entirely follow the counsel of God, who is our sovereign
Physician and fill and satisfy ourselves with his fear, following orderly that
which he teaches us by his word, and rejecting al other fear which our
sovereign Physician reproved. Solomon uses the same similitude here, as may
be seen by the word filling, which signifies in his language satisfiyng or
appeasing of hunger, and promises to him that shall satisfy himself with the
fear of the Lord, great assurance, when he says,

That he shall lodge where no plague shall visit him. He uses a similitude
taken by a traveler or stranger who arriueth in a Isay. 8. 12. and 29. 3. and
41* 8. and 43. 1. and 44. 2. 1. Pet. 3. 14.
lodging or Inn, which is out of the danger of thieves, and has good gates
and walls very strong, and those of the house are honest folks and are
careful to shut their doors, and use a traveler or passenger gently, and see
that he be not offended, nor suffer no wrong in their house. Even as such a
traveler is in great surety, according to humane sense: so he that fears
the Lord, finds good lodging, and sure entertainment, and there is no man
that can do him any harm. This is it which God has promised to his people by
Moses, and afterward by David and his holy Prophets. But one may say: there
is none in the world, that suffer more outrages, Leu. 25. and 16. 2. Deuteronomy. 8.
6. Psalm. 22. 24. 25. and 34. 8. Esaias. 33. 14. Exo. 25. 5.
injuries, and violences, nor that are persecuted more cruelly, then they that
fear GOD. Abel has proved it, David, the Prophets, Jesus Christ and his
Apostles, whom he has foretold their afflictions. To this I answer, That to
be visited with evil in this place, is to be vanquished therewith, so that
one is not able to recover himself: as it is taken in diverse places of the
Scriptures.

24 The slothful man has shut his hands into his bosom: and will not take
pain to put it to his mouth.
Solomon has often told us already the nature, gestes, and qualities of the
slouthful, and the misery and poverty which of force they must endure by their
sloth and negligence: notwithstanding, because the number of them increases
daily, and continues, and that we are al of so wicked a nature, that we will
be content too live at our own pleasure without doing any thing, but to
sport and play, and to enjoy the delights and pleasures of this world, and
will not think on the hyre of sloth, nor hear speak of evil, which shall
follow after, which we must of force suffer, will we or nil we, if we be
slouthful: for this cause he contenteth not himself with so many
aduertisements which he has already given us: but to the end we may take more
heed, or at least wise be more inexcusable, and judged worthy of misery, he
repeateth here again under contrary words, the negligence, and little care
of the slouthful, by the gesture of a man, who because of the great cold he
endures cannot put his hand to work, but is constrained to shut it into his
bosom to keep it warm, when he says,

The slothful man has shut his hand into his bosom: and will not take
pain to put it to his mouth. And by good reason speaks he so: for the
slothful will not warm himself with his business, but is still as it were
very chilly and cold. Whereupon ensues that of force the great indigence which
takes and assaileth him, must make him suffer hunger, as Solomon expresses,
saying,

And he will not take pain to put it to his mouth. In so saying he shows
the long abiding of the hand in the bosom, and the continual and obstinate
negligence of the slouthful, which if he would forsake, he might so one
remove his hand from his bosom, and set it a work, whereby he might have
wherewith to return to his mouth and sustain himself. But seeing he makes
no account thereof, he must of force perish with want, and be poor and
miserable. And if one put a contrary to this, that there is a great number of
sluggardes, which put well their hands to their mouth, eat and drink, and
make good cheer, and their goods never fail them: as is seen in the Clergy
and monkery of the Papists. Answer First. Solomon shows what the slouthful
are worthy of, and what it is they deserve: as also the Apostle Saint Paul
shows, when he forbids giving meat to the slouthful. Secondly, 2. The.
3. 10.
seeing they are not worthy to live: and that they usurp that which they
have, as thieves and robbers that live by rapine, yea by what title soever they
possess their goods.

Thirdly, if the slouthful for a time live at their ease, they come atlast unto
great poverty: as is daily seen in many who inherit richly their fathers
patrimonies, and afterward living in delights, without doing any thing, have
not had wherewithal too put their hand to their mouth, but by begging,
filching, robbing or deceiving.

Fourthly, if God spare the slouthful for a time, he knows how to visit
them afterward: and if it be not in this world, it will be in death
everlasting, as may be seen by the wicked rich man, Luke 16.

25 Smite the scornful person, and the ignorant will take better heed: for
if one reprove the wise man, he has understanding to knowledge.
One says commonly that it is best to beat the dog before the Lion: whereby
is signified that to warn and fear the hautie, proud, and arrogant,
stiffnecked, and obstinate, it is best to chastise the feeble, although they
have sinned in little, or nothing. And as one says, who without al right or
reason, so one does wickedly in doing so: and the sentence is practiced, which
says: Censours torment and afflict the Doves, and spare the ravens and pardon
them. For one shall see (as the common use is) that Kings, Princes, and
magistrates and judges will sooner and more sharply punish the simple person
which has not much offended. They are not so taught by God, who resists
stoutly the proud, and gives grace to the humble: as he has well showed at
the Deluge, at the subversion of Sodom, the destruction of Pharao, and other
desolations whereas he has smitten the scorneful, and spared the lowly, to
the end that the ignorant and simple which are not yet well advised, may fear
and learn to walk wisely. Therefore since the superiors of the earth are in
the seat of God, they ought to be his followers in punishing them that have
no fear of God, nor reverence of his word, and that by their dissolute life
and insolency, work great scandalles, and offend their neighbors, with
wrongs and outrages, and violences, to the end that the rest may be afraid to
give themselves to such wickedness, Solomon warns them hereof, saying,

Smite the scornful person, and the ignorant will the better take heed: for
if one reprove the wise man, he has understanding, etc. He says not,
admonish freendly the mocker, and reprehende him in secret: for he knew well
that one should profit nothing that way, as he has above said: But he
will that one smite him, and punish him, according to his demerites, to the
end he may be an example, and that others may come to repentance and
amendment of life, and that they be not so hardy to give themselves to
wickedness, but have it in abomination, and flee from it intierely. See here
the heed which Solomon speaks of when he says, That the ignorant will take
better heed. He will not that by his heed, he hurt his neighbors, but that
he flee from mockery. For the rest, when he puts the wiseman a contrary to
the scorneful, saying. If one reprove the wise, he will have understanding to
knowledge. And that he says not. Smite him: but reprove him: he shows
principally two things. First, that one calls not him wise which has no
fault (for such a one is not any way to be found, or if he be found, yet
he is not to be reproved, but praised, and extolled) but he which by
infirmity being fallen, relieueth himself by repentance, and takes in good
part, to be argued, blamed and reproved: for he knows that such
admonitions, and corrections, serve him for a school to be come yet more
wise, and better advised. As Solomon expresses it, saying,

He has understanding to knowledge. For he understands not at the
beginning but by augmentation, whereof has been spoken heretofore. Secondly,
That they which are tractable and of good capacity, ought not to be handled
rigorously, as the incorrigible, scorneful, and contemptuous: although one may
well use sharp words, and severe speeches: as is to be understood by this
word reprehending: for if a man have wit of himself, he ought therefore, to
be better aduysed, and to guide himself well that he fall not, and it ought to
be a great shame to him, to commit a fault worthy reprehension, be it never
so little.

26 He that hurts his father, or shuts out his mother, is a shameful and
an unworthy son.
There are some children which think it is laweful for them to spend their
fathers goods at their own pleasure, and so they make great wast of the same,
and put their fathers in poverty, and want: and despise their mothers, because
they are women, who do nothing but trouble the house, a lest, and offend
them, and seek to chase them out, principally when their fathers be dead: And
in thus doing, they think themselves courageous champions, honest men, good
companions, and men of account, and light on table fellows, and playepheers,
who know how to flatter them, and make them believe that they are worthy to
have goods, because they know how to spend them pleasantly and in good
fellowship. But because the word of God ought to be preferred before al
humane wisdom, and so by consequence before al foolish fantasies: and that
such children, consumers of substance, and contemners of their parents, not
only despise humane wisdom which teaches children to be sober, modest,
temperate, and humble to their parents, but also are disobedient and rebellious
against God, who commands that one honor father and mother: for this cause
Solomon calls them shameful and unworthy, saying,

The son is shameful and unworthy, etc. Solomon speaks not here obscurely:
for he speaks according to our manner, which is, to call a person shameful and
unworthy, which leads so wicked, filthy and abominable life, and in such
inhumanitie ingratitude and cruelty, that not only he ought to be ashamed
thereof, but also deserves to be opprobrious and despised. Which thing those
children well deserve, which hurt or undo their fathers, and chase, or shut
out their mothers. The law ought so to handle them, that they be an example to
others. But because it pleases us not that our children should come to such
reproach and shame, as to be punished openly, for offenders, and that we
ourselves should be abashed, griened, and vexed thereat, it is meet
aforehande that fathers and mothers be careful to order their life according to
the word of God, and according to the same word to watch over their children,
bringing them up in the fear and knowledge of the Lord. And that mothers take
heed of being too much doted over their children, but that they show themselves
grave and make them fear them. For it happens oftentimes, that children, which
are cockered, and brought up tenderly, work most woe to their mothers. And
principally, when they have most need of succor, which is after the discease
of their husbands when they are widows, or sick, or aged: It is then say I,
that children ill brought up, despise them, offend them, and do them wrong, and
seek in this sort, to shut them out far from them, where by right they should
enterteine them carefully, in all humanity and gentleness, with fear,
humility, and reverence. Such children are shameful and unworthy principally
before God, which knows well how to destroy them, and put them back from him
with the Devil, under whom they serve.

27 My son hear no more the doctrine that leads thee unto errors, from
the words of understanding.
Seeing that Solomon admonishes his son, that is to say, him that is minded
to obey his commandments, and believe his doctrine, and has already a good
beginning, or yields himself attentive, to learn good doctrine: seeing (I
say) that it is to such a son, that he speaks, and admonishes him to
hear no more any false instruction: let us understand that he speaks not of
the instructions of the Priests and Doctors of the Gentiles, which led them to
abominable observations, and who fought directly against the law, in so much
that the most rude amongst the children of wisdom, amongst the people of
Israel might know them, and easily keep themselves from them, if they would
not work against their own consciences, and despise God willingly. It was
easy for them to take heed thereof: for in the law they were often warned,
both by express words and by sharp threatenings: But he talks of the
instructions of them who under shadow of being Jews, and magnifying with
their mouth, the law of God, showing themselves very zealous of the glory of
God, and profit of their neighbors, deceived the people, bringing in sects,
and practicing superstitions, which had some spyce of holiness and religion.
And so they perverted the state of the Church, which was well ordained and
disposed: as Core and his companions. As also those against Romans 16. 1 Ier. 4.
14. Ezech. 13. 1.
whom the true Prophets cried, and amongst the rest Jeremy and Ezechiel. Of
such Prophets the number has been great, as may be seen in the 1. Kings,
chap. 18. verse. 19. And not only then but also in the time of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and his Apostles: the Scribes, and Pharisees, and others were of that
number: as our Savior shows Math. 16. 6 and 23. 13. Phil. 3. 18. Ioh. 2. 18.
and 4. 1.
it, when he wills men to take heed of their leaven, and when he
pronounces them evil luck. Saint Paul also shows it, and Saint John. Such
fellows are very dangerous, because of their doctrine which bear a fair
show, are in the mean while turned from the obedience of the law which is
the true knowledge Deuteronomy. 13. 1. Esa. 9. 15. Iere. 23. and. 18. 15. Romans 16. 17.
2. Tim. 2. 14. Ose. 4. 5. Mat. 24. 4. 11. 23. Act. 20. 29 30. 1. Tim. 1. 4. 2.
Tim. 3. 1 2. Pet. 2. 1 Psa. 25. 4. and 119. 33. and ^^3. 8. 10.
as there are many aduertisementes thereof. Saint Paul also shows the danger
well. Solomon therefore admonishes his sons, to wit, each faithful Christian
man, not to give ear to consent to the instruction of such false Prophets,
which make the true preaching of the word to be despised, which is the true
knowledge, without the which we are blind, and ^^ force must go astray,
stumble, fall, and perish. This present admonition is now as necessary for
us, as it was at the time of Solomon. As we ought to understand by that which
our Lord Jesus Christ has foretold us, and Saint Paul and Saint Peter. Let
us note therefore that we are admonished diligently to read the scriptures
and frequent sermons of the word of truth. For it is there that we hear
the words of knowledge. Not to go astray therefore, we have to pray with
David: Lord make me to know thy ways: direct me in thy truth, and instruct
me.

28 The false witness scorneth judgment: And the mouth of the wicked
deuoureth iniquity.
Many weigh it not much to bear false witness against their neighbors,
although their own consciences reprove them, and this may be, because they
think, or else seek to make themselves believe, that they do no hurt but to
them against whom they witness falsely, who are men as they are, and that they
abuse none by their false witnessing but earthly judges: but here Solomon
does show them that this is not so light a matter as they make it and that
they open their mouths even up into heaven and speak against God: for they
scorn against judgment, the which although men exercise it, notwithstanding
it is not their judgment but of God, of whom judges are but ministers, and as
it were instruments. And he alone is judge of all the world, and so the
wrongful witness, not only stryueth to set Genesis 18. 25. Romans 3. 7. 8. 9.
Psalm. 7. 9. and 9. 8. 9. and 75. 6. 7. 8.
disorder, trouble, and confusion in worldly affairs in doing their neighbors
damage, and abusing the judges to make them err from the right, but also he
despyseth God, and as much as in him lies, depriueth him of his truth, and
righteousness, and consequently of his divinity, for he cannot be God, but
he must be veritable, and just, which is a mockery so detestable, that God
will not leave it unpunished, as Solomon has said before in this chapter, ver.
5. and 9. But the false witnesses are so affectionate to ill speaking, and find
so much sweetness therein, that they think not of that which will follow, but
only to speak evil with great desire, and pronenesse. As gluttons and
drunkardes do which devour meat, and swallowe up drink with the great
desire that they have to fill their bellyes, and cease not to put in their
mouths: for all their pastime is to eat, and drink. Even so false witnesses
apply al their study to speak wickedly. Solomon signifies the same saying.

And the mouth of the wicked deuoureth iniquity. Wherein also he signifies
the ruin of the wicked, which give their mouths to evil speaking: for as the
gluttons, and drunkardes kill and choke themselves with too much excess, even
so the wicked shall be condemned for the words of their mouths. And whereas the
holy scripture applies it self often to our manner of speaking, it must not be
thought strange of that which we have said for when we see any one desirous to
tell a tale, we say he byteth upon it, as upon an apple: and so we say of
gluttons and drunkardes, that they kill themselves, because they never cease as
it were, to drink and eat abundantly. Nevertheless, because the word
devour does signify also, to hyde, some expound it that the wicked
dissemble iniquity, because in bearing false witness they would be thought
to speak truth.

29 Judgments are prepared for the scorneful, and stripes for fools backs.
There are diverse scornful persons in the world and in diverse sorts, as
experience shows it, and Solomon has witnessed it heretofore speaking of the
scorneful in sundry manners. Now although it cannot be but their consciences
must reprove them oftentimes, and ma^ger their hearts they must be afraid of
the judgments of God, nevertheless they cannot truly understand that there
is a God, a judge just and severe, who ought to judge and punish them in ire
and fury. As it appears, when for any remorce of conscience that they have,
yet they reuert not at al from their scornfulnes but are rather obstinate and
hardened therein, as if they had made aliance with death and hell, and as
though they had power to resist God, and to command him to desist from that
which he has prepared Isaac. 28. 14. 15.
for them, and renounce that which he has enterprised against them. But even
as all such presumption is vain, arrogant and wicked, so the holy Ghost
laugheth at it, and shows that it shall be put down, made nothing, punished,
and destroyed, Solomon declares it in this present sentence. Judgments are
prepared etc. For seeing that God is not variable, and that he has prepared
judgments for the scorneful, it follows well that he will make them feel
them punishing them horribly, and without appeal, yea before they themselves
shall know of it, as Solomon signifies by the word of judgments: the which
signifies not here any arestes of the mouth, or any deliberations or sentences
verbal, but the horrible, and fearful Exodus 6. 6. and 74. and 12. 12. Isay.
3. 14. Iere. 1. 16.
execution, of the eternal decree of God against the wicked as it is taken in
other places, where God manaceth the wicked to punish and destroy them. Solomon
also shows it when he joins stripes to judgments, saying, And stripes for
fools b^ckes. For this is but an exposition or repetition of the words
precedent, as the manner of Scripture is to resay one thing twice or thrice,
and to call it by diverse names. That therefore which Solomon has called
judgments, he calls stripes: and the scornful, foolish, threatening them
grievous punishment, not in their goods, but on their own person: for he
says that stripes are prepared for their backs, which is to say that God has
determined, and appointed to afflict and punish the persons of fools by diverse
and sundry afflictions and punishments, as the Egyptians have proved, and also
the obstinate and rebellious amongst the people of Israel and others. Solomon
signifies well the diversity of punishments, when he says not stripes in the
singular number, but in the plural. And that the back or body is taken for
the person, it is manifest, for God afflicts not the wicked only in their
outward members, but also in their souls and minds as they well feel it. And
in other places the back or body is taken for the person. In our common
language we call the guard of the body of any one, him which keeps him to the
end none do hurt to person. And although many scorneful and foolish persons
feel not in this world these judgments and stripes, nevertheless that which
is ordained for them, shall not fail. For having abused the wisdom of God,
they shall receive at last their merits, and deserts. One may also say that
Magistrates and judges are warned of their office: Romans 24.
for they are ordained of God to do judgment and justice, in punishing the
wicked, and delivering the good from all injuries, and violences. Romans 13.
True it is that scornefulnesse, and folly have their principal seat, and
residence in the heart, whereof men cannot be a fit judge, there is none but
God which sounds and proves the hearts. But as a lively spring andful of
water must needs empty himself; or as a draughtful of filth and doung
breaks and casts his smell abroad, and infecteth al them which are about
it: So the scornful and foolish spil their wickedness, in committing great
scandals, or doing great outrages, or violences to their neighbors. Of such
things men are judges, and ought to punish them.

The xx. Chapter.
1 WIne is scornful, and strong drink troublesome: and who so erreth in the
same, is not wise.
ALthough God has created wine and other drinks, which have great strength
and savor, and gives us them not only to sustain and fortify us, but also
to rejoice and delight us, (as may be seen in Moses as has been alleged:)
notwithstanding this is not to say, that one should Pro. 3. 10. Psa. 104. 15.
Gene. 9. 21. and 19. 33.
take such abundance thereof as to be drunk, as Noe, and Lot did. And also it
is not lawful to delight in taking too much thereof, when chiefly for the
abundance thereof one shall not be drunk, as the forenamed were. For the
excessive abundance makes not one drunk always, insomuch that by the same
one commits only one fault or two: But it chauncerh to many, that when they
have exceeded one time, and that the drink pleases, they return thereto twice
or thrice, and afterward continue and persevere therein, as long as the
occupation agrees with them, and there is nothing that pleases them more,
then to intunne the wine into their throtes. And so they abuse greatly the good
creatures of GOD, against whom they are very ungrateful, not acknowledging
that God gives us meat and drink, for to use in all sobriety and temperance.
Also he rendereth them the hire, that they deserve, delivering them up in a
reproved sense: As Solomon shows it in three words. The first when he
says, wine is skornefull. Here wine is not taken for the licour that GOD
brings us forth of the vines: but for him that is adicted to the same, and
has therein so great delight. For as one calls man by the virtue and grace
wherewith he is endued and adorned: So does he also by the vice whereto he
is adicted and wherein he is greatly enwrapped. Example: the man is called
flesh, because he is given to fleshly lusts, the faithful are called light.
You were of late darkness, but now you are light to the Lord. Solomon
therefore calls wine, him that abuses Genesis 6. 3. 2. Cor 5. 21.
himself therein, and by the same is corrupted: and says that such a
drunkarde is skorneful: wherein he signifies well that he is delivered up into
a reprobate sense. As one may understand by that which has been treated of
heretofore of the skorneful. And although we had no passage of the Scripture,
which taught us that we might say, that wine is taken for him which is given
thereto, yet we might say, that Solomon speaks so, applying himself to our
manner, which is to attribute unto wine, that which drunkardes do, and say.
Wherein drunkardes ought to have great shame, and find themselves very
culpable, when it must be, that for their vice, the creature of God which is
good, be so reproched. Also the Lord can hold them culpable in that they abuse
so his good gift, and defile it by intemperance: And finally will declare
against them his judgments Pro. 1. 22. and 9. 7. 8. and 13. 1. and 14. 6. and
15. 12.
and stripes, which he has ordained for them. The second, is when he says,
Strong drink troubles or is troublesome. By strong drink the Scripture
intends ordinarily the drink, which has force to make a man drunk. But
here we take for the person which is so much given thereto, and takes so
great abundance thereof, that by the same he is moved to strife, debate, and
mutuny insomuch that one can have no peace with him, nor reconciliatio^ at al.
And so he that is given to take abundance of drink, which makes drink is
delivered up into a reprobate sense, also he is irreconcilable. As one may see
where Saint Paul says, that they which are abandoned in a reprobate sense
amongst other vices are full of strife, and that they be without natural
affection, people.

The third is, when he says, that who soever erreth in the same is not wise,
When either by ignorance, or astonishment, or wandering of the spirit, he
puts himself out of the right way and goes not where he should, or by
obstinacy, or his own opiniate mind, leaves his way, and afterward cannot
find it again nor knows not where he goes. Therefore drunkardes do so
abuse wine and strong drinks, that they loose thereby al memory, sense, and
understanding. And what rebukinges soever one give them thereof, they make but
a jest of it as Solomon pronounces, saying, wine is skornefull. And move
strife and debate against them, which seek to lead them in the right way,
sooner then they will give them thanks for their friendly warninges, as
Solomon pronounces it, saying: Strong drink is troublesome, or stirs
strife. And so drunkardes by their scornfulnesse and strife do go astray, and
by ignorance, astonishment and wandering of their wits, and by obstinacy and
malice deliberate. Wherefore one may conclude with Solomon that they are not
wise, and also that they shall not be: as Solomon signifies, using the future
tense. And also one may well say, that they are abandoned into a reprobate
sense: for as experience shows us, they give themselves to do things which
are not lawful. Thus doing, they go astray in such sort, that they never
find the kingdom of GOD. For first they have in this life neither faith, nor
repentance, Romans 1. 29.
without the which one cannot serve GOD, and give him the honor and homage
which he owes him, acknowledging him for sovereign king and governor. But
rather by incredulity and wickedness they serve the Devil.

Secondly, they shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven, to enjoy the same
with the wise, just, and sober. Let us understand therefore that Solomon
aduertiseth us covertly 1. Cor. 6. 10.
of that which the holy Scripture in diverse places admonishes us. Let us obey
these holy and necessary admonitions: otherwise we shall be without heart,
and of force must die. For we shall be without wisdom, in the which there is
life. Some translate in the steed of, to go astray, too delight: both the two
agree well with drunkardes: and in as much as they delight too be drunk,
they loose their sense, whereupon of necessity they must go astray.

2 The fear of the king is as the roaring of a Lion: he that provoke him to
anger, offends against his own soul.
If the simple, and feeble beasts which have neither teeth nor nails
sufficient to defend themselves withal; or likewise little children, and they
which feel not themselves strong enough, and well defended, are afraid, when
they hear the Lion roar and approach: it is right necessaty that subjects
be careful too keep themselves from committing any thing, whereby they may
merit to be threatened by their Lords, and superiors, as Solomon has showed
us. And because every one of us has the heart of a king, and that naturally
we covet liberty, or rather Pro 19. 12
rule and Lordshippe, and will not submit ourselves as subjects, but rather
rise up and make rebellions: for this cause Solomon warns us again of the
power, severity and rigor, of the ire and revenge of kings and superiors of
the earth, when he says, The fear of the king, etc. He shows us that as
the Lion being hungry, spares, not his pray, when he has it between his
paws, so if we be apprehended, having offended our superiors, we have too
know that our life depends therevppon. As also he says consequently under
other words, saying: That he which provoke the king to anger, offends
against his own soul. That is to say, that he puts his life in danger,
that he deserves to be executed and put to death by justice, or endure other
pains very grievous. For he that is disobedient to the king, and provoke
him to anger, not fulfilling his will by humble subjection, is the kings pray,
and not they which live honestly, humbly, and religiously. Also kings,
princes, magistrates and governors do not affray with threatninges such
personages. Much less seek they to tear them in pieces and devour them, but
they use benevolence toward them, which is as the deawe upon the grass. When
therefore Solomon says: Pro. 9. 1^.


The fear of the king is as the roaring of a Lion, he that provoke him to
anger, offends against his own soul. It is not to harten proud and cruel
Tyrants against they^ Subjects and inferiors, to the end too vex, torment,
and destroy them: But it is too advertise kings which will raygne truly as
they ought, of that severity and rigor, which they ought to use against the
disobedient, and rebellious, the obstinate, and stiffenecked in their
wickedness, dissolutions, and insolences. Such persons are the pray of kings
and not the simple and innocent, which seek to render due obedience. But as
the use is now, the wolves eat the sheep, they spare the wicked, and afray
the good, doing to them outrage and violence under the color of justice. It is
secondly to show Subjects and inferiors that they ought to walk in fear
under their Lords and superiors. Otherwise to look to prove their fury like
the hungry lions. Also when Solomon says, And he that provoke him to anger,
offends against his own soul: he teaches us not that we should spare
kings in their vices, neither that we should fear to rebuke them for fear
of their anger, and incurring their displeasure. Thus doing we should be
hypocrites, dissemblers, flatterers, traytoures to God, and to them which we
spare in their vices. Which wickedness to eschew, let us follow the constancy
of the Prophets and Apostles, who have spoken frankly and courageously to
kings, and Princes, and have not feared their evil graces, as the holy
Scripture witnesses. Also they have been toward such kings and Princes, as
the pray between the paws, and jaws of the Lion. And according to the
opinion of the world, they have offended against their souls in not speaking
and doing as pleased those kings, and have been worthy of death in the
opinion of carnal men because the Princes were angry at their constancy and
magnanimity, which they have reputed obstinacy, and resistance or rebellion,
as yet at this present, they use to do against the poor faithful sort. He
teaches us not I say, that we should spare such tyrants: But that we keep
ourselves, least by our wicked conversation, and reprochful manners dissolute
and unruly, and our deeds outrageous and violent, we provoke to anger our
Princes and superiors, which are ordained over us. This should be to resist
the superior power: And so we should offend against our souls putting them in
danger of damnation, not only temporal, but also eternal. Therefore if it
behooves us to be careful to keep ourselves from provoking mundane princes
to anger, which Romans 13. 2.
are but Lions whelps: by a far more reason we ought carefully to regard
that we fear the great Lion, who not only teareth in pieces the flesh and
bones of them which resist him, but destroys them for ever. This great Lion
is our God eternal and almighty, into whose hands it is a fearful thing to
fall. It is he of whom it is said. His roaring is as it were the Lion he will
roar and hantche up his pray, and there shall be none which shall recover it. we
have to do also with another Lion which is the Devil, whom we ought still to
provoke to anger and wrath, in resisting him. He Heb. 10. 31. Esa. 5. 29. 30
and 31. 4. Ose. 11. 10. and 13. 7 1. Pet. 5. 8. 9. Iam. 4. 7.
is not like to kings of the world, which have the power from God, to punish
in their anger them which resist them, and to take revenge upon them: but the
more one resistes him, the more, one is assured that he will do no hurt. And
as a people that will resist some tyrant, munite, and arm themselves with all
armor and munitions necessary: Even so to resist the Devil, who is the
murderer of our souls, and to make him flee, it behooves us to arm and
defend ourselves, as Saint Paul admonishes us. Ephesians. 6. verse. 10.

3 It is a man's honor to keep himself from strife: but every fool will be
meddling.
When we are al created to the Image and likeness of our God; it is good
reason that we be his followers, and that we think it great honor if we
follow him well. As when a child has a good father, it is honor to him to
seek diligently to represent the manners of his father in his life and
conversation. Such a child is greatly praised and esteemed amongst them that
have any little sense at all. And also the desire of fathers is commonly that
their children at the least wise resemble them, if they cannot come to a
greater perfection. Now our God and father is the God of peace and love: as
he has manifestly showed unto us, for when we were his enemies and
adversaries by our sins, by the which we fought against him, provoking and
stirring him up to anger against us, he has loved us so much that he has
deigned to make peace with us, and reconciled us to him by the death of his
son. He has not made such peace and reconciliation with us, for the love
that we had toward him: neither has he done it against his will, fearing to
be dishonored thereby, as the fleshly men and Romans 5. 8 Ephe. 2, 1 Col. 1.
21, 22 Ioh. 3. 14 1. Ioh. 49 Luke 2. 13. 14. Ephesians. 1. 5 Col. 1. 21, 22 Psa. 29.
8 Esa. 62. 5. and 65. 19. Mat. 18. 11 Luke. 15. 34
worldlings, proud and arrogant, would esteem themselves to be dishonored
as of a bace mind and courage, if they should seek their enemies, to
reconcile themselves and make peace with them. But he has esteemed such peace
and reconciliation glory and honor. And seeing that for this peace and
reconciliation he will be glorified: it follows well that he esteems it a
glory, and as he esteems it a glory, so has he done it cheerfully,
without forethinking the good which he has done to us ungrate and perverse.
Thus doing, our good God and father has thought it glory and honor to cease
from strife. And seeing it is glory and honor to children to follow the
gentleness, benignity, and humanity of their fathers, it behooves us to
follow our heavenly father ceasing from strife.

And to do this same well, it behooves us to take away al enimities, hate and
rankour, whereof debate and strife, dissentions and mutunies proceed, and to
make peace with all men. It is not therefore Pro. 10. 12 Romans 12. 17. Mat. 5. 44
and 23. 23.
only toward our friends that we should cease our strife, but also
toward our enemies, who ask but our destruction. And it is not meet we
think, that we are dishonored if we humble selves, so far as to seek our
neighbors to make peace and reconciliation with them.

It is not meet that this be done unwillingly: as they that will say they
wish no harm to their neighbors, and in the mean while, will neither see
them nor meet them, nor do them any pleasure at all. It behooves that it be
of francke courage, and Mat. 18. 35
free will that we reconcile ourselves one to another, forgetting injuries
past, as if we never had been wronged: our Savior shows us that we must so
do. And seeing we crave of God whom we Psa. 25. 6 and 79. ^
have grievously offended, that he will have no remembrance of our faults, etc:
It is good reason that we do the like to our neighbors, for it is impossible
that they should so much offend us, as we have offended our heavenly father.

This is showed us by the parable which is in S. Matthew chap. 18. ver. 23.
Ephe. 4. 31 33. and 5. 1. 2
Let us cease therefore from strife (as it is said) and follow that ^ our
glory shall not be transitory, but eternal, for we shall be the children of
Col. 3. 8 Mat. 5. 9
God.

Contrariwise, if we be given to stryfes, this shall be objected against us,
for although the world make account of the virtuous, and stout, and those,
which can revenge themselves, and injury their enemies: notwithstanding the
holy Ghost pronounces them fools, saying by Solomon that Every fool will be
meddling. This is no small reproach to be called fool by the holy Ghost.

4 The slouthful body will not labor, because of winter: therefore shall he
beg in harvest, and have nothing.
It is a great pain and travel to plow, till, and labor the ground in winter,
because of the frost, snow, and rain: as they prove it which meddle
therewith. But for the difficulty which they find therein, they cease not to
apply their labor: Some through hope of gain, some for fear of poverty, and
other some because they know that one should apply his work at al times and
seasons, according to the state wheretoo he is called: and that they should
with all diligence seek to overcome al difficulties, to the end they neither
put themselves nor their family in danger to beg their bread, and for the
most part not to find one which will give any thing. As the slouthful deserve
well, and also Solomon threateneth them therewith, saying,

The slouthful body will not labor, etc. As for the manace of poverty, it has
been amply treated of. But we must note first of al, that there are many
which think themselves not slouthful, and nevertheless if they meet with any
little winter, that is to say, any let, which seems to them hard to
overcome: they are so deintie, that they think one should excuse them of the
work.

Such persons (after Solomon,) ought to be esteemed slouthful: for they labor
not in the winter. Here under Winter he comprehends all the seasons that
seem difficile to them that would live at their ease, and would eat their
bread and do nothing, but that which seems to them good, according to the
sense of their flesh. As also under the name of laboring, we ought to
understand al doings wherein men ought to apply themselves. Secondly it is to
be noted, when he says, that the slouthful shall beg or crave in Harvest,
that idle persons will think thereby that one ought to give them their
demand, when he has gathered goods enough, and that he ought not to spare
from them, seeing they are in poverty, and know well how to spend it. There is
a great number of such sluggardes in the Papacy, were it but amongst the
Monks and Priests. And in every country whatsoever, there are many idle
persons which follow plays and pastymes, after the which they make great
cheer, and search out the tables of them whom they think are rich, or have
made a good harvest, and are liberal. Thirdly, let us note that when he
says. That the slouthful shall have nothing: He speaks principally of that
which the slouthful deserve, and also of that which cannot fail them. For
although idle bellies be for a time filled, notwithstanding it is not wholly to
their contentement: for they have never so much as they would have, and yet at
last they come to a miserable indigence, and are naked of al goods: As they
find, which are in hell. The rich also are warned not to communicate their
goods to such slouthful persons.

5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water: and a man of understanding
will draw it out.
There is none but God alone which can know, and bring to light, that which
lies hid in the heart of man: as has bin showed heretofore by the scripture
in diverse places. And although we think very profoundly without any outward
motion, yet our thoughts stick not to be present with him, as well as if we
should expres the^ by words or works: the 136. Psalm shows this well, and
forthwith declares what it is, insomuch as GOD has formed us as we are. But
al though it appertain to him alone to have such knowledge, and that none
other can have it, nevertheless we are so curious, that we will know that
which we cannot know, as appears by that which has been already said: for
seeing it apperteineth to God, the creature can do nothing in it, and ought not
once to presume to attain thereto. Solomon also shows it well, when he
compares the cogitations deliberations, enterprises, and wills of the heart
of man, to deep waters, saying,

Counsel in the heart of man, etc. This is not to say, that the heart of man
is nor more hidden, and hard to sound, then the bottom of the deepest waters
in the world: But Solomon makes such a comparison, to show that if a man
find it hard, yea impossible to pearce the depth of the great Sea: then he
ought not to presume to know that which man co^sulteth and decrees in his
heart: for it is yet more hidden the^ the depth of Sea: and also it disguiseth
it self in diverse fashions, as every one of us may know, if we consider it
more nearly, according as he is sensual, and given to his natural corruption.
Likewise there is none of us, which knows entirely the counsels of his
heart: for then we should have no sins which should be hidden from us,
for the which David Psalm. 19. 13.
prays, saying, Who is he that knows his offenses? Deliver me, therefore
from my hidden faults. Nevertheless this argues not, but one may somewhat
know what a man is in heart: for if we have the patience to consider
according to the word of the Lord (the which only is our wisdom and
understanding) the words, behavior, and doings of them which seek to hide
and disguise themselves, at last their hearts will not be discovered too us,
and we shall know their counsels, deliberations, and enterprises: For God by
his word will give us such wisdom, that it will be as easy to us to
discover and see that which is in their hearts, as it is to draw water out of
a well or river which is at every ones commandment. Solomon shows us this,
saying,

And a man of understanding will draw it out. It is not without cause that he
says, A man of understanding, Math. 7. 15. Act. 20. 28. Romans 16. 17.
for it is very needful that one have a near regard too draw out such
counsel. Our Lord and Savior shows it us: and the Apostle Saint Paul.
True it is that the Lord to give us the more occasion to watch, permits for
a time that we be somewhat deceived by hypocrites, to the end also that
afterward, having our eyes opened, we may know, that it is he alone, who
gives us the understanding how to draw out that which lay too deep for us
before.

6 The mighty man is named a well doer: but who shall find a faithful man?
It is the manner of worldly men, which seek to get some of the substance of
the rich, to flatter them, and curry favor with them, calling them well doers.
It is al one to them if they lie, making them believe that if in times past
they have received nothing of their benefits, yet by such flatteries in time
to come they will induce them to be beneficial to them. Solomon expresses this
in brief, saying,

The mighty man is named a well doer. Now as he is called a man beneficial,
or well doer, he ought also to be so: for the Scripture gives not such a name
in vain, neither here, nor else where: and this is not to advance flatterers
and encrochers, but Luke. 22. 25 Romans 13. 3.
to maintain the good and just. But it is a thing very rare to find a Prince
or great Lord, which answers to the titles that are attributed unto him, as
experience does well show, whereto Solomon has regard saying,

But who shall find a faithful man? Although it be universally true, and
without exception, that God alone is faithful, and that al men are untrue:
notwithstanding in this place (as the sense requires it, and because he has
spoken in the beginning of the sentence of a mighty man) we will take the man
for him which is in pre-eminence and authority, and will understand that
Solomon accuses here the mighty of disloyalty, oppression, andviolence,
because Esa. 1. 21. and 3. 13. and 5. 23 Amos. 2. 6.
they do not answer to their title of well doing, but in steed of being men
of benificence, they are thieves, robbers, murderers, and homicides, as is
laid against them in the scriptures.

7 He that walks in his integrity, is just: and his children shall be happy
after him.
We desire naturally to be reputed just, and that al go well in our family,
not only during our life, but also after our decease.

Now to the end we have no vain reputation, but be just indeed, yea
before God, and that we ourselves have witness thereof in our own
consciences: Solomon shows us the way that we ought to walk in, when he
says,

He that walks in his integrity, is just: and his children shall be happy,
etc. He says not, he which refers himself to bounty and virtue of his
neighbor, and attends to his merits: to the end we do not as the
Papists do, which recommend themselves to the merits of Saints which are
departed, and attend on the suffrages and works of supererogation of fat
bellied Monks. It is not meet that we be fainte hearted, to rest and take
breath, nor that we ease and repose ourselves, as if our legs were a weary,
or our feet chafed: but we ought too walk being conversant with our
neighbors in sound and pure conscience, without malice, fraud, or any
disguisement: and doing frankely to our neighbors, as we would they should
do unto us, keeping loyalty to them, and love unfeigned, being ready rather to
endure damage, then to hurt another man. This is the integrity in the which al
faithful men ought to walk, to deal purely and justly in the house of the
Lord, which is his Church. This is well taught us in the scriptures. If we
walk in such integrity, we are of the number of them which have place in
the house of the Lord: Psa. 15. and 24 Psa. 33. 4. 15. Psa. 3. 5.
whereupon ensues that he accepts us as just: For the word of the Lord
is righteous, and al his works are faithful. He loves righteousness and
judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. For thou art a God
which love not wickedness. The wicked shall not dwell before thee. It follows
also that we walk according to his law: for there is no integrity but that
which is taught us by the word of God. One may see this clearly in the
Psalm 119. 1. and in many places of the same Psalm, And seeing it is so that
our integrity, lies in keeping of the Law of God, the which is not in our
power, it follows that of ourselves we cannot walk in our integrity. And
therefore although it be called ours, and that it is the way of justice: yet
nevertheless let us take heed to glorify ourselves in our own way, as if of
ourselves we did walk so: but let us ask the guiding and government of our
God. Otherwise we cannot walk according to his commandments, as is showed us
in many places by his promises, Psalm, 25. 4 119. 33.
wherewith we should not have to do, if of ourselves we had the power to
do that which he promises. Wherefore also although it be said, that who so
walks in his integrity, is just: let us not imagine that our integrity
makes us just. But when we walk rightly and roundly, without dissimulation
or fraud in that which God has taught us by his word, we have a certain
argument that we are just: for we bring forth the fruits thereof, the which
make us not just, but because God justifies, and sanctifies us by his
spirit, we bring forth the fruits of justice: and 1. Ioh. 37.
so walking in integrity we have witness that we are just. Also we are
certain of our election to eternal life: for them that he has predestined,
he has also called, and the^ that he has called, he has also justified: and
them that he has justified, he has also glorified. Romans 8. 30.
And so we have testimony of being blessed, not only for ourselves, but also
for our children after us: as Solomon pronounces saying,

And his children shall be happy or blessed after him. Not that the father
deserves it, nor yet the children, but it is by the mere mercy of GOD
according to his promise. Wherefore we ought to understand the promise that
Solomon makes here, according as the Apostle Saint Paul expounds it. All
they Genesis 17. 7 Exo. 20. 6 Romans 9. 6.
which are borne after the flesh, of just people, are not just, nor blesse^
for the same: and contrariwise, they which proceed of the wicked, are not
unhappy therefore: as it is showed to us very well in Ezechiel, Chapter 18.

8 A king which sits in throne of judgment, chaseth away all evil with his
look.
Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and Superiors of the earth are so much doted
over their own greatness, and pre-eminence, that they think one ought to
tremble under them, when in the mean time they pass their days in pleasure,
and make good cheer, sleeping, and resting at their ease, without taking care
to minister justice, and regard to root out the wicked reprochful, and
insolent. Whereby it comes to pass that il deeds increase and endure, and
it is an hard thing to remedy it: for this cause Solomon being willing to
amend such disorder, and looseness, admonishes kings of their duty, saying,

The king, etc. He will first of all that Magistrates be not as them, whom God
complains of by his Prophet Esaias: but that they be set in the throne, not of
pride, pomp, and vain magnificence, nor of oppression, outrage, and violence
(as the most part of them which have the title of administratours of justice,
come to possess the seat, for to make their own profit by wro^ging others)
but that they be set in seat of judgment, that is, in what part soever they
be, their affections and studies tend, to do right to every one, to punish the
wicked, maintain the good, and deliver the feeble and oppressed from the
violence, tyranny, and cruelty of the wicked. Secondly, as God, (whose
liefetenants they are) beholds with his eyes al things: so he will that kings
have eyes, that is to say, care and diligence, to watch over them which are
given them in charge, and of whom they have the government, to the end they
may banish and chase away al wickedness, and that truth, justice, holiness,
and innocence may reign: and because what heed or diligence soever kings and
princes use, yet they are never of themselves sufficient to chase away al evil:
but they have need too have honest me^ to bear charge under them, as Iethro
admonishes Moses thereof: also king Iosaphat constituted Judges. For this cause
the kings Exo. 18. 14. 2. Chro. 19. 5
eyes may be taken also for them which help him to administer justice. This
while it is not meet to say that it is lawful, to refer himself to them
wholly, without taking heed there to himself: for if he make no account to
look with his own eyes, and his officers do any injustice, the fault shall be
imputed to him. It is meet meet therefore that superiors which appoint
officers under them regard nearly what men they be that they appoint. For
the rest, although every one ought to help his neighbor, and defend him, so
much as is possible, from al oppression, and violence, yet is it not lawful for
particular persons which are not in office, to place themselves upon the throne
of judgment, for to chase away evil. Solomon shows it well, when he
attributes this same to kings. So does our Lord Jesus Christ when he
reprehendeth the Apostle Peter, for the cut ear. Matthew. 26. 52.

9 Who shall say, I have cleansed my heart: I am clean from my sin?
It is written that God created man to his own image and likeness: whereto
Ecclesiastes having regard, says: That GOD Genesis 1. 27. Eccle. 7. 30.
has made man just and right, but by unthankfulness, and misknowledge, by
arrogance and rebellion, he has soon defaced and abolished this image, and is
fallen from his righteousness: as is seen in Genesis 3. and Ecclesiastes
signifies it, when in this place before alleged, he says that men have
sought out many inventions. Now man by his fall is so much corrupted and made
servant to sin and death, that all his posterity is infected therewith.
Insomuch that none is exempt from sin, but all are so hardly bound thereto
that they cannot free themselves. And this is not in the outward parts only
that he is such a one, but principally in the inward parts, which soil,
and corrupt the other members. And therefore Solomon demands not, who has
washed his hands or feet? or, who has cleansed his body? for the outward
washinges or bodily purginges, although ordained in the law, served to no
end, but rather were hurtful, but that they were instruments to conduct the
person to search his spiritual purgation in the blood of Jesus Christ, and to
know that he had need to be cleansed inwardely, but he asks:

Who will say, I have purged my heart, I am clean from my sin? Wherein weee
ought to learn that the filth and infection which soileth and corrupts the
person, is of the heart, and that the prrincipal care that we ought to have of
ourselves, is that we be pure and neat in our hearts and consciences, which
thing we cannot attain to by faith and repentance. Let us beware of resembling
the Scribes and Pharisees, to whom Jesus Christ obiecteth their Mat. 23. 25.
hypocrisy. Nevertheless the principal meaning of Solomon (when he makes
such interrogation) is to show us, that man, be he never so just and holy,
ought not, nor cannot truly vaunt himself, that he is pure and clean from
sin. This has been showed by the figures and shadows of the law, when it
behooued us so often to renew the sacrifices, oblations, and washings: and
before Solomon, David well showed it, when he was so heedeful, to ask still
pardon for his sins. It behooves us also to learn so of 1. Kin. 8. 46.
Eccle. 7. 21. Psa. 19. 13 14. and 25. 6. 7 11. and 51. 3. 4. 5 Luke 18. 1. Mat.
6. 12. Luke 18. 9. 1. Ioh. 1. 8. 9. 10. Esai. 64. 6. 8. Psa. 143. 2. Rom 7.
our Savior, when he will, that one pray without cease, and he teaches us to
demand pardon for our sins: And when he shows by the similitude of the
Pharisee, and the Scribe, that man ought not to trust in himself. It is meet
we learn it also of Saint John. Know we therefore, that we ought not to
vaunt of our cleanness, but in all humility and mistrust of ourselves, say
with Esaias, We are al as filth and doung, and al our righteousness is, as a
spotted piece of cloth, etc. And therefore we should pray with the same
Prophet, Now go too Lord, thou art our Father, we are the claye, and thou
art he which formest us, and we are all the works of thy hands. Lord be not
so angry against us, neither remember our iniquities any more. And with David.
Lord enter not into judgment with thy servant, etc. And that we perceive
clearelie (as Saint Paul did) that there is no goodness in us. Thus doing
we shall not proudly vaunt ourselves to have purged our hearts, but we
shall be humbled, and then GOD will exalt us.

10 Two manner of weighies, or two manner of measures, both these are
abomination unto the Lord.
When Merchants which seek to enrich themselves by the hurt of others, use
wicked and unlawful fetches which they call subtitle, to the end to disguise the
commodie and set it forth to make it appear better then it is, or of more
measure and weight, or selling it dearer to the simple, then to the skilful,
they think not that God regards it, much less that he takes ill the
iniquity which they commit in deceauing their neighbors, selling them as
dear as they can, either with disceite, or with less weight or measure then
is lawful: they persuade themselves that God has other things to do, then to
to settle themself to see if there be true dealing amongst merchantes or no,
for they think, that it is but adventure or fortune, or suttletie, or
diligence, which is the cause of making a man rich. This while, although in
craving their trade of fraud, and trumperie, of theft and robbery, they
acknowledge not God as they ought to do: nevertheless they are greatly to blame
because they do against their own consciences. For they would be loath to
have one use them so, and would soon condemn as wicked, al such as use
such traffickes, were it not that they were of the same trade, and study to
get profit thereby. But when God has a care over herbs, and little birds,
yea, over the hears of our Mat. 9. 26. and 10. 29.
heads, which we esteem no great matter, it is good to understand that he
regards well how men use us, and takes it not in good part, if one beguile
us, or pil and powle us: but has in hate and abomination, them which use
fraud and disceite. Solomon shows it, saying,

Two manner of weights, etc. Here we see how for the iniquity of the
disceitful, things without sense, and dead, which can do neither good nor
harm, are abominable before God, much more they which so abuse them. Which
thing Solomon also will that we should understand by this present sentence.
Also it is good reason, that such disceiuers be abhorred of the Lord. For,
as much as in them lies they falsify them: for weights, and measures are the
work of the Lord. There is none but he feels himself greatly offended,
if one seek to make false his work: we ought not therefore to marvel if God
abhor them that sell by false weight and measure, Pro. 16. 11.
or which have one weight to buy by, and another to sell by. This falsehood, and
diversity is marked, or noted, when Solomon doubleth the words, saying, Two
manner of weights, and two manner of measures: which is to say, the great, to
buy by; and the little, to sell by. And they that have a double measure of
corn, the great to buy by, and the little to sell by, are al abominable before
God. Although we had but a natural light which taught us to do to our
neighbors, as we would they should do unto us, yet we ought to be just in
weight and measure: And by far more reason, when God commands it.

11 The child's also shall be known by his conversation, whether his works be
pure and right.
Many think that one ought to let children do according to their own
fancy, not vexing them, nor constreining them at al to keep themselves
upright, and use honest dealings, and good manners, nor to accustom their
wits to practice things pure and right, to exercise their tongues and hands
therein, and others members as need and opportunity require. At leastwise,
there are many fathers and mothers, there are many Superiors and Governors,
which have no care to hold youth under in fear, and refourme their insolency
and dissolution. Whereof it comes, that when children are more in age, they
are of wild and wandering wits, of perverse and corrupted wills and
affections, and apply not their members but to vanity and folly, to shame,
and filthiness, to works wicked and abominable. And when they are come to
perfect man's age, according to the time of life, they neither can nor will find
in their hearts to change, but if they could they would by their wills wax
far worse: as one may see by experience, when they provoke young folks to
give themselves to pastime, with all insolency, and loosenes of life, and that
they desire also to be young again, to accomplish the desires of the flesh,
in their concupiscences. But because we ought to covet that our children
should become honest men, and rejoice to see them in good company, whereby we
may judge, and hope, that in time to come, they will govern themselves honestly
in all pureness, and uprightness, it is not meet that we be of this foolish
opinion, or that we follow this negligence. But that we be heedful, and
diligent, to guide and keep youth which is committed to our charge, bringing
the^ up in the fear and knowledge of the Lord, to the end, that as much as
in us lies, we teach our children and servants good and honest manners, and
that we accustom them in the same: insomuche that we seek to bring to pass
that they give themselves thertoo, and take pleasure therein, and apply al
their whole studies thervppon: if we can gain thus much of our young folks,
we have good hope that in time to come they will walk uprightly, and give
themselves to clean and pure works. Solomon affirms and pronounces it,
saying, The child also shall be known, etc. Let us not think that he speaks
according to the manner and opinion of wise worldlinges, who judge of children
in the time to come, according as they see them inclined of themselves, without
the word of the Lord. For such an inclination be it never so fair, is but
filth, vanity, hypocrisy, and wickedness. But he will that by the word of
God, we govern young age, and that we use them to honest and religious
conversation. It is very necessary to do so: for this word is the rule of
al ages, David shows it well. And Saint Paul praises Timothy, Deuteronomy. 4. 9.
10. and 6. 6. 7. and 11. 18. 19. Psalm. 34. 12. 2. Tim. 3. 15.
in that even from his youth he has had knowledge in holy letters.

12 The Lord has made both these two: to wit, the ear, to hear; and the
eye, to see.
The world is given to speak foul and filthy, injurious and ill words, in
diverse sorts: To do also detestable, hurtful, vilainous and infamous works.
And although the conscience of many, yea, of al, almost reprove them, yea make
them to tremble, will they, nil they, nevertheless they strive to persuade
themselves that God hears not their speeches, nor sees not their doings, But
if a workman which has made a work, do know the same in all parts, and
wotteth well to what use his work is most proper: By a far more reason, it is
meet we do this honor to our Lord Psalm. 59. 7. and 64. 6.
God, and Creator, to acknowledge and confess, that there is, neither words
nor works in the world which he hears not, or sees not, be they never
so hid, and secret. Solomon shows it well when he says,

The Lord has made both these two. etc, He names but two for briefnesse
sake. But that which he let us understand, that there is no part or member
of man which he has not made, and which he has not himself placed upon
the body as seemed him Job. 10. 8. Psa. 139. 5. 1. Cor. 12. 18
good. Then if it be so (as of force we must believe it is so) it follows
that there is neither breath nor motion in any part of man's body, but God sees
it and understands it. And therefore it is by good right, that the Psalmist
complains of the wicked which use violence, and persuade themselves that God
neither hears nor sees any thing. Also because they play so with God, he
pronounces them accursed by his Prophet Esaias. Let us learn therefore Psa.
94. 6. 7. Esa. 29. 15.
here to apply al our senses to hear, say, and do, that which God has
ordained by his word, without despysing or mockery at all, knowing that he
which has made us, is always present with us. And if we abuse our members,
which ought to be the temples of the holy Ghost, let us know that God will call
us to account thereof, Psa. 139.
which we shall not absolutely perform, and therefore he will destroy us, yea
without any difficulty, ad David signifies well when Psa. 59. 9.
he says, But thou Lord wilt have them in derision, and wilt laugh all the
heathen to scorn.

We merit and deserve well then to be derided, despised, and rejected of our
God, if we abuse our members. For it is an infallible argument that the
inward part is infected, and corrupted, when the outward has his mouings.
And thus we are wholly and intyrelie infected and filthy, and by consequent
abominable before our God, whose handywoorkes we abuse wickedly. Let us
learn moreover that if there be any likelihood of goodness in our members,
not to forget ourselves nor to be puffed up with pride, to despise them which
seem not too be so prompt and ready as we think ourselves to be: But in
all humility and modesty acknowledge GOD, who has given us the virtue that
is in our members, to the end we employ it to his glory and the profit of
our neighbors. Otherwise we are unthankful and proud: for without the aid
of him which has given us ears and eyes, we can neither hear nor see.
Balaams Ass saw the Angel. The eyes of the two that went to Emaus Nom. 22. 23
Luke. 24. 16
were closed. For the rest, let us note that if of ourselves we have not the
outward senses, nor the motions thereof, then of ourselves we cannot have that
which is more excellent, as our spirits, and the motions of them which
proceed of the regeneration of the holy Ghost to conduct us in all holiness,
and innocence. For he that cannot do the little, cannot do the much: know we
therefore that our spirits cannot rightly contemplate nor understand but that
God is their helper. Also although we take pain to give counsel, and to
govern, yet our labor is in vain, if God do not govern it. The common
sort hear and obey their superiors, if GOD give them good understanding and
tractable hearts. Princes see clearly, and are wise, and give good order, and
foresee well for the common wealth, if they be aided by GOD. This may somewhat
be understood by the Psalmist, wherefore we have to follow the Psalm. 33. 13.
James. 1. 5.
counsel of S. James. That if any of you have lack of understanding, let him
demand it of God, who gives it to al men simply, and it shall be given him, etc.

13 Love not sleep, lest thou come into poverty: but open thine eyes that
thou may have bread enough.
There is no man which in his own fancy is desirous of poverty:
Nevertheless many sommon it with great have not moving a foot but resting at
their ease, as the slouthful do. And Solomon Prou. 10. 11.
has somewhat touched it: but he will not that we rese^ble such sluggards, as
he declares unto us, saying, Love not sleep. etc. He forbids not one to
take his rest, and sleep, for it is a thing natural to men, which proceeds
not of sin. For if sleeping had proceeded of sin, our Lord Jesus Christ
had not slept as he did. And men of force must sleep, as experience shows
us. For without Genesis 2. 21.
sleep they could not perform their business. But it is meet that sleep
be moderate, and temperate and that it be taken at convenient Mat. 8. 24.
hours. That we resemble not them, which are not content to sleep a nights,
but also spend therein the most part of the day: Nor they which take their
pleasure, to play a nights, and then make the day their night, lying, and
sleeping til breakefast or dinner be ready. Solomon forbids us the love of
sleep, after the manner of such folks, to the end it happen not, that
poverty assail us: not that he means, that the thing which ought
principally to keep us from the love of sleep, is the fear of poverty: but
he has regard to that which we fear naturally above al things, except
death, and threateneth the slouthful with that, which they fear will betide
them. And after this threatening, he admonishes us to wakefulnes, when he
says, Open thy eyes, etc. not to plays, and pastimes, and other dissolutions
and insolences, as there are many who are too much wakeful about the same,
but he admonishes us to watch about our buisinesse which is committed us to
do, as he shows by the promise which he adds, saying, That thou may
have bread enough, for he says, He that labors the earth, shall be
satisfied with bread. In each labor is abundance, the Pro. 12. 11. and 14. 23.
and 13. 4.
soul of the diligent shall be satisfied.

14 It is naught, it is naught, says he that buyeth: but withdrawing
himself aside, he boasts of his bargain.
As there are wicked sellers which disguise their wares, extolling it, and
praising it, and setting it out far more then they ought, by lying and
swearing, or rather forswearing, to the end to sell it for the most that they
can: and sell it with less measure or less weight, or in some other manner of
way, unlawful: So are there buiers which are little better, for they will do
nothing but watch how they may deceive the sellers, and chiefly when they
think that they are not skilful and wily, but proceed in simplicity, or
understand not what the ware is worth, or else are so needy, that they are
constrained to sell that which they have, at a small price: then the subtle and
crafty buyers, know how to disprayse the same, saying, that they know where
is as good, and at a better price, or vary so much, that they make them
forget the number, or else will have more weight, or measure, then it behooves
them, or will give some money in hand, and the rest take at credit, never to
pay. The experience thereof is but too manifest. Nevertheless, Solomon lets
not to show it us, when he says,

It is naught, it is naught, says he, that buieth. He speaks so, to the
end, to show buiers, which will have things almost for nothing, that the holy
Ghost knows well their malice, and that against their consciences they
dispraise in words, that which they would buy, and which they know to be of
a good value, for after that they have obtained it at a low price, they scoff
and jest at the seller behind his back, and glorify themselves in the
deceit they have wrought. Solomon speaks so, when he says, But withdrawing
himself aside, he boasts of his bargain. Some say, Naught, naught, says
he, that possesses: but when the thing goes away, then he praises it.
Wherein they understand, that Solomon blames those which are not content with
their estate and condition, and never say well thereof: but when they are fallen
into a worse, then they acknowledge and confess that they were well. Then
according to this second sense, let us learn to content ourselves with our
calling, although it be poor, and laboursome, knowing that we have nothing,
be it good or evil, but it comes by the will of God our father, to whom we
owe al obedience. and to take al in good part at his hands, to praise it, and
give him thanks for it. For in what sort soever he afflict us, he never
depriueth us of those things which he knows are needful for us.

15 There is gold and a multitude of stones: but the lips of knowledge are a
precious jewel.
The fleshly and wordly men, which will be fine and gaie in their bodies,
houses, and also in their riches and treasures, seek to deck themselves with
goldringes, fair and rich Pearls, and stones very precious, Chains of
gold, and other ornaments about their garments: And as far forth as they
can, they garnish their houses with vessels of gold and silver, to the end,
that all shine with them, and men have them in admiration: for such sightes do
dim the eyes of the poor which are simple, and would gladly be of power to
appear like unto them. So also they seek to hoarde up in their treasuries,
great sommes of gold and money. And when they are so enriched, they please
themselves greatly, as being possessours of the most precious things of the
world. And indeed there is no worldly thing more precious than gold and
pearl. Also the holy Scripture (to apply it self to our rudeness) being
willing to show us the excellency of the word of God, and how we ought
greatly to esteem it, compares it to gold, silver, and precious stones. It is
only because of our rudeness, that such Ps. 12. 7. and 18. 31. Mat. 13. 44.
Psa. 19. 10.
a comparison is made. For the word of God surmounteth infinitely, and
incomprehensibly al riches of the world. And therefore, if we esteem and
praise worldly things that are precious, it behooves us far more to be
affectioned to the word, and say with a pure, and clean heart, The
judgments of the Lord are more to be desired than gold, and more sweet
than honey, etc. The doctrine of thy mouth is better unto me then a thousand
11. and 119. 72. 127. Pro. 3. 13.
pieces of gold, or silver. I have loved thy commandementes more then gold or
Jewels. Solomon has showed us heretofore, that we ought to be so affectioned
to this word. He shows it us presently, when he says,

There is gold, etc. We ought to esteem nothing more precious then the word
of truth, which is spoken unto us by the lips of the Ministers of the Lord.
That word is the knowledge which makes their lips precious. And if the
worldly sort do take pleasure, and delight their eyes when they see fair
Jewels of gold, and precious stones, by a far more reason, we ought to be
attentive to the lips of knowledge, to receive it, not as the seed which
falls by the high way, or on rockie ground, or amongst thorns, to receive
thereby some transitory or temporal taste: but as the good earth does which
makes the seed to flourishe: so it behooves us to receive this knowledge in
heart pure and neat, thereby to rejoice and feed our souls. Not as they
which feed only their eyes, when they behold any fair Jewel, and afterward
have no fruition thereof. But if we receive the word with a good heart, it
will remain with us for ever, and will never depart from us: for it is not like
frail and transitory things, but endures and abides for ever.

And therefore Saint Peter counsels us to love one an other in Esai. 40. 6.
7. 8. 1. Pet. 1. 23.
heart purely, being regenerate not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, to
wit, the word of God, living, and enduring for ever. If we desire to come to
this, let us follow the counsel that Solomon gives us. Get thee (says he)
from a foolish man, etc. Pro. 14. 7.
Thus doing, we shall not only have pleasure to hear the lips of knowledge,
but also our hearts shall be so replenished with science, that of the abundance
there of, our lips shall be opened, and speak to the praise of God, and the
edification of our neighbors, after the counsel of Saint Paul. Ephe. 5. ver.
19. 20.

19 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him
for the unknown sake.
The Lord God in his law permits, that one take a pledge of him to whom
he has lent any thing, but he will that incontinent the pledge be given
again to the poor, and that rather one Mat. 5. 42. Luke 6. 30. 35.
endure some loss, then to be unkind and cruel toward the indigent, and
needy, following that which Jesus Christ has taught us. Solomon following the
law, will that we take heed of loosing our goods which we lend, and for the
surety thereof, to take a pledge, for he says,

Take his garment, etc. And therefore he speaks not of taking a pledge
between brother and brother, that is to say, of him that is of the same
nation, and religion with him that lends, and takes pledge, as there is
express mention made thereof in the law: for it says not, when thou lendest to
whosoever, but, to thy neighbor, to wit, he that is a Jew by nation and
religion as thy self, but he speaks of people which know not one another,
nor know not the faculties, and need the one of the other, as may be seen
by that, where he says, A stranger: but for exposition he says also, The
unknown. For this cause he makes no mention of restoring the gage again
straight way. Nevertheless, let us not think, that he will permit more or
greater rigor then God does in his law. For (as it has been touched) The
law speaks of them which are of the same nation and religion, and which
know one another, and how each thing stands amongst one another. And
Solomon speaks of the unknown, and wills that one be careful to take good
assurance, for one knows not whether they be men of a good conscience, and
conversation, or prodigal, and excessive in expenses, as dicers, gluttons,
drunkardes, and whoremaisters. In whose hands it is not good to trust ones
goods: but if he do, to take a sure pledge for safegarde: for goods are
committed to us, not to let them go at randon, but to dispende reasonably, and
help our neighbors therewith, which are poor and indigent. Mean while, let
us esteem none as strangers, but those which are of a dissolute life. For
Jesus Christ has united us Ioh. 10. 16. Ephe. 2. 14.
all.

17 A man thinks the bread sweet that is gotten with deceit: but afterward
his mouth shall be filled with grauel.
We ought to know by that which is commanded us in the law, and by the great
number of aduertisementes which are made us in diverse places of the Scripture,
that God loves truth, justice, innocence, loyalty, and humanity, and will
that we follow these virtues: where contrariwise, he hates lying, iniquity,
false dealing, deceit and cruelty, and al wicked traffickes, deceites, and
disguisements, which he will in no case that we use. Then if we were the
servants of God, fearing him as we ought: if we would frankly obey our
heavenly Father, as good children, we should think his commandments good,
and take great pleasure, to follow and keep them, being very loath and sorry
to fail in any one point of them. But we are of so corrupt, and wicked a
nature, that we will not hearken to our God and Father, but think that too
sharp and rigorous, which he commands. It seems us, that he is too
severe and rigorous, and that we should never have good day, if we should
yield ourselves subject to his will. For this cause, turning back, and wholly
reuolting from him, rejecting his yoke, we give ourselves to the devil, and
will accomplish his desires as if he were our good father, and we his
children altogether at his commandment: for as he Ioh. 8. 44.
is a liar, and father of al lies, and as he has been an homicide from the
beginning, and has not dwelled in truth, nor truth in him: so we love lying
and cruelty, and take delight to live by fraud and deceit, exaction and
oppression. Solomon signifies this in one word, when he says,

Bread that is gotten with deceit, etc. He says not absolutely, that such
bread is sweet, but he says, That a man thinks it sweet, wherein he
taxes greatly the peruersitie, malice, inhumanitie, and cruelty of man, in
that he has pleasure and delight to live by a wrongful, violent, and
outrageous means, the which brings to his neighbor woe and grief: and is
to him very bitter: for a man can not eat the bread of deceit, but he must
make them eat the fruits of anguishe, whom he deceives, pilleth, and
oppresses. So Merchantes and worldly Artificers, which set not before their
eyes, nor make no account to love their neighbors, as much as in them lies,
make them eat a sharp and sour bread, whom they deceive. So do al Princes,
Magistrates, and Judges which love bribes, and gifts, and which have respect
of persons: but above all the Monks of the Papacy (who under shadow of their
gaie divine service, or rather diabolical, get to themselves the substance of
the simple, which believe in their lying) make folks eat a bread so bitter,
that the souls are lost and destroyed for ever after it. The bread therefore
of falsehood, is not sweet absolutely: because it endomageth them of whom it
is taken. So does it also to them that eat it: for their frauds and theftes,
their exactions, and oppressions, their inhumanities, and violences, (which are
the bread of falsehood or deceit, because they possess not justly, the goods
which they have heaped together by such iniquity, neither can they use them
lawfully) are finally grievous and noisome to them, as Solomon pronounces it,
saying,

But afterward his mouth shall be filled with grauel. He uses here a
similitude of corn, which has been threshed on a dustie flore, or ground,
immediately after the Mill has been picked. Of such corn one may make fair
bread, but they that shall eat of it, shall be vexed at the grauel which they
shall find between their teeth, for it has no savor, but rather hurts the
teeth, when it comes between them. So the bread of deceit will bring in the
end great damage to them which eat it. For through the same they shall be cast
into utter darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

18 Confirm thy thoughts by counsel: and so make war with wisdom.
The Princes of this world have great thoughts, and diverse, and know not for
the most part how to atchiue them. They esteem themselves so great and
puisant that they dote over their own hautinesse and power, and think verily
that none should resist them, or at leastwise if they do, to be able too
bear off the blows, and easily become conquerours. But experience has showed
it in Pharao, and Sennacherib, and many others, and also shows it now in our
time, that the great men of this world are often frustrate of their attemptes:
which ought to be a great shame and grief to them which esteem of themselves
so.

Now to the end that faithful and Christian Princes come not to such
confusion, Solomon warns them saying.

Confirm thy thoughts by counsel: and somake war with wisdom. Wherein he
assenteth somewhat, that kings and Princes should think on that which they
have to do, and chiefly when there is question of war. For it is not meet
then that they be asleep. But he will not that they proceed in the execution of
their thoughts, according to their fantasies, and opinions. For most commonly
by their ambition and disordinate desire of reign and bearing rule, they will
put oftentimes, both them and their subjects in great danger. And therefore he
says not, Confirm thee in thine own thoughts of thy self, but, by counsel.
And that is it which we have already alleged heretofore in some places,
That Kings and Princes are not sufficient of themselves alone to rule and
govern, but they should have about them, men of good counsel and ad^^^e. If
they follow the admonition of Solomon, and that war be moved against them, it
shall be easy for them to resist it: as Solomon promises, saying, And so make
war with wisdom. For we ought to know that Solomon admonishes not
Princes, but because he knows that the will of God is such, as imports
promise. And that which is also done truly by wisdom, is never undone, but
has issue, and durance. Let us understand also, that he commands not to
make war, but he shows that for the good guiding of the same, it behooves
to proceed by wisdom not humane, but divine, which is so say, that one
enterprise no war, but first he knows that God appoints it: whereupon
ensues, that it is not lawful for kings and princes, to make war, to enlarge
their limits, and make themselves great earthlings, but for too defend the
country which GOD has committed them in charge.

Notwithstanding some will say, that the children of Israel have assailed many
people, and destroyed them by war. But for answer one may say again, that
one particular feat which God commands for a time, ought not to be turned in
consequence, to be made laweful for every man. One may say moreover, that that
which has happened to the children of Israel, has been done in figure of
things to come, to wit, to instruct us that we have no acquaintance with the
enemies of God, which are chiefly the Devil, and our own sins.

19 He that reuealeth secret counsel, turns to a backebyter: wherefore
meddle not with him that offends with his lips.
Solomon accuses him of backbiting, whom his neighbor has made privy of
some of his secret imperfections, to discharge Pro. 11. 13.
his heart, and be unloaded thereof, and to have some rest in his spirit: when
incontinently, he publishes that which he has heard or seen in secret, to
the end to be welcome amongst the enemies of him which has bewrayed himself,
or amongst them which are covetous to hear evil speeches of others. And in
this wise, he strives to hurt his neighbor, either in his name, or in his
goods, or else in his person. Solomon does so here, saying, He that reuealeth
secret counsel, turns to a backbiter. And this is, because the world is
greatly replenished with reporters of things which profit nothing, neither to
the^ which tell them, nor to them which hear them. And so of flatterers which
seek to be welcome unto them, which delight to hear one praise and extol
them, and dispraise others. Likewise of backbiters, which seek the decay of
their neighbors, and procure it in lying, and speaking false witness against
them. It is also, because that of our corrupt nature, we are inclined to covet
glory and praise, and think that we should be the rather praised, if we
speak ill of our neighbors. And if we be not often aduertized of our duty,
we forget ourselves, and apply our tongues (headlong) unto evil speaking. And
because we are never so well reformed, but still our nature is inclined, to be
soon again corrupted and perverted, and because evil words corrupt good
manners. Solomon will in no case, that we conspire with the backbiters, nor that
we be familiarly conversant with them, nor that he consent to them any way. He
forbids us this, when he says,

Wherefore meddle not with him, etc. It is very necessary that we
understand this same, according as it has been expounded. For as long as we
be in this world, it must needs be that darnel must grow amongst the Wheat,
but when God has given us the grace to be Wheat, let us take heed that we
turn not into darnel. Let us walk therefore in fear and trembling, and take
no pleasure at al to be amongst backbiters, which offend with their lips,
that is, which speak against their consciences, and against that which they
know to be good and right, and forsake the word of truth, giving themselves
to lying. Then if it will do us hurt, to be amongst such people, much more
ought we to fear, to agree with them, either in speaking or hearing evil. And
we ought to know that when our hearing and speech are corrupted, the rest is
worth nothing, neither within nor without.

20 The lamp of him that curses his father or mother, shall be put out in the
depth of darkness.
After that God had commanded us to honor father and mother, he adioyneth a
promise of long life theretoo, which is singular and special to this
commandment. And therefore Saint Paul says, That this is the first
commandment of promise, and Ephesians. 6. 2
by this promise, he gives hope of felicity and prosperity, to children
which will be obedient to their fathers, and honor them. Contrariwise, he will
that those children which in steed of honoring father and mother, do vex
them by disobedience and curses, shall be put to death, as has been alleged
heretofore. Then seeing he deemeth not such children worthy of the life
present, it follows, that they shall be deprived of the heavenly light, and sent
into uttermost darkness. Solomon signifies this, saying,

The lamp of him, etc. This makes not, that wicked and rebellious children
shall have any lamp of true joy, and prosperity, but only that which they
think they have: which as is said) shall be put out in the depth of darkness.
For they shall be in so great pain, and anguish so sharp, and torments so
troublesome, that of the prosperity which they thought to have, there shall
remain no whit, neither shall there be remembrance of it any more. The pains
that they shall suffer, shall surmount, all that which has gone before, as
contrariwise, the joy that the obedient children shall have of the heavenly
prosperity, shall be so great, that if in this life they have suffered pain,
grief, and tears, they shall be al defaced, and blotted out of remembrance.

We understand therefore by the Lamp, which is clear and bright, joy and
prosperity: And by the darkness, sorrow, sadness, ill luck, and misery,
according as the Scripture speaks oftentimes of light and darkness, shadow
and obscurity. And chiefly in Job, in the Psalms and Prophets. But because
light signifies also knowledge, and darkness ignorance: some say, that
Solomon means here, that rebellious and disobedient children shall be punished
with great ignorance: whereof ensues great decaie. For it must needs be, that
those which can not guide themselves by the words of the Lord, must perish.
And so in what sense soever we take the lamp, and darkness, let us know
that Solomon pronounces for wicked children, everlasting perdition. 1. Kin.
11. and 15. 4. 2. Chr. 21. 7.


Moreover, because in the Scriptures a Lamp is taken for posterity. One might
say, that Solomon threatens unruly children, that their offspring shall be of
none indurance, and the memory thereof soon abolished, or that they shall have
no issue: as is seen to come to pass in many obstinate children, who because
they have not had their parents in honor as they ought: God has deprived
them of issue, and permitted not that they should enjoy that honorable title
of father. Whereof also ensues, that he disaloweth them for his children, and
so consequently, they are the children of the Devil. And therefore in which of
the three senses soever we take this sentence, let us note, that Solomon
foretells destruction to wicked children.

21 The heritage that is gotten in haste, shall not be blessed in the end.
It is a hard thing for a sensual man to endure poverty, and therefore each
one flies it as much as he can, and follows the means which he thinks
will make him rich. And hereby, some haste to get a great heap of gold and
silver; other, merchandise; and others, houses and lands. They think that
when they have been quick at the beginning, and made haste too make
themselves rich, then they shall never have poverty, but their goods will
increase and multiply, and they shall grow every day richer and richer. Now
because they which strive to enriche themselves in haste, proceed therein with
an evil conscience (as they themselves well know: for they would not that one
should proceed with them, as they do with others: and so Saint Paul shows
us their evil conscience:) for this cause they are at last frustrate of their
attempts, and their goods decaie at the twinkling 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10.
of an eye, and vanishe away, so that they fall into great poverty, as many
feel the proof thereof. And Solomon speaks it, saying, The heritage that is
gotten in have, etc. Whereupon ensues, that man enricheth not himself, in
hasting after the goods of this world, seeing that the heritage so gotten, is
not blessed: for the blessing of the Lord makes rich. Which thing Abraham
and other holy fathers, which were not covetous, have Pro. 10. 20.
proved, as the scripture witnesses, saying: that God has blessed them, and
multiplied them greatly. On the other side, Achab and Iezabel, were covetous of
Naboths Vineyarde, and had it by 1. King. 21. Romans 22. Romans 9.
and by: but it was not blessed with them. Also the thirty pence which Judas
received, were not blessed with him.

Let us understand therefore, that in this sentence we are taught to do our
business carefully, and attend with patience the goods and profit which it
shall please God to give us, following many admonitions of the scriptures
alleged heretofore.

22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil, but put thy trust in the Lord, and he
shall deliver thee.
We desire al to be out of danger of the violence and outrage of our enemies,
and to attain thereto, it seems us, that there is nothing better then to
fortisie ourselves, not to sustain and endure patiently the evil which they
will do to us (for that we think is for them to do, which have no blood in
their nails) but we seek to fortify ourselves, to the end, to recompense
the evil which one does to us, or more: for in this case we seek (as much as
is possible for us) to owe nothing unto them, which have given or done us any
thing against our will.

But it is so much absent that we should render ill for il, that we ought to
take great heed that it enter not in to our thought to do any mischief, or to
render the like to them which do us harm. Solomon shows it us well for he
says not, recompense not evil for evil. But say thou not, etc. When he
forbids one to threaten his neighbor with wordrs which proceed from the
heart: It follows well that he reprooueth the inward spring without the
which the mouth could not use any threatenings. Also in the Scripture, speech
is taken for thought, and chiefly when it is said, That the wicked say things
abominable, the which Psa. 14. 1.
notwithstanding they would not speak forth, for although they be wicked,
yet they would be counted honest men, which they should never, be if they
were lauishe of their words. It is not meet therefore that we be reuengeful
in our thoughts, nor that we show ourselves so by words or threatenings, much
less indeed, and execution. But it behooves us to be wary, peaceable, and
patient, as Solomon teaches us saying,

Put thy trust in the Lord: He will not that we take pain, to recompense the
evil which is done to us, but that we have regard to the Lord, hoping upon
his succor and aid, and assuring ourselves that he will not abandon us to the
wicked will of our enemies, but deliver us therefro. Solomon promises it saying,

And he shall deliver, etc. He promises nothing here but the holy fathers
have proved it. And therefore if we will be partakers thereof, let us foll
owe their faith and patience: and for to do it well, let us obey that which our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ teaches his Apostles. And when he says, Put
thy trust in the Lord, let us not think in any wise that the Lord is absent
Mat. 5. 39. 44. Romans 12. 14. 17. Col. 3. 12. 1. Pet. 3. 9. Psa. 10. 1. and. 13.
2. and 44. 24.
from us, or that he is far off, although according to our sense, he be so,
because we cannot always perceive his aid in our anguishes and tribulations,
whereof the Saints also make complaint. It is only according to man's sense
that he is absent from us, for in verity he sees all that is done about us.
He is always present to assist us, and aideth us to the end we fall not in
the danger which is prepared for us as the Saints have well known. And there.
fore after their complaints they comfort themselves with the assistaunce and
succor of the Lord. Note we also that although God reserve the revenge to
himself, nevertheless it is not meet that we should request him to take
reuengement over our enemies, having regard to us: but it behooves us to put
our whole trust in the Lord, referring ourselves wholly to that which seems
Ps. 10. 14. and 13. 6.
him good to do, without desiring hurt to them which do us hurt: for such is
the will of God, although his office be to defend the innocent, and punish
and destroy the outrageous and oppressors, as he does still at times
convenient: finally, when it is said that God will save them which put their
trust in him with patience: let us note that although God suffer the innocent
to endure oftentimes even unto death, by the violence of their enemies:
nevertheless he ceasseth not to be true in his promises, and to fulfill them.
For the innocent which have true patience in their afflictions, and
temptations, although they dye in the same, yet they are saved, and delivered
in that they overcome them, and are victorious by faith, and patience: and
thereby obtain eternal salvation, to the which the children of God ought
principally to aspire: when they have any promise to be saved, and delivered
from the hands of their enemies: for it is then that they are wholly delivered.

23 Diverse weights are an abomination with the Lord, and false balances are
not good.
Solomon has already advertised us in diverse places that we should be just
and equitable in that which we have to change Prou. 11. 1. and 6. 11. and 20.
10.
together as well in buying as selling: and now he admonishes us again of
the same, not sticking to pronounce one sentence oftentimes to the end we
flatter not ourselves in falshoodes and deceites, seem they never so little to
us, but that we know, that if we be not upright, faithful, and loyal to our
neighbors, as we would they should be unto us, we should be the more
inexcusable and worthy of grievous punishment, when we have been dull and
sluggishe, or hardened and obstinate in our frauds, and deceites, after so
many admonitions. It is not only Solomon that has troubled himself to warn
us, but we have the law, the Prophets, Jesus Christ, and his Apostles also.
Likewise (will we or nil we) our own consciences teach us the same, when we
condemn them that use us not rightly, loyally, and faithfully, as we desire:
having then so many masters, we shall grievously be punished, if we despise
to give them audience and obey them.

24 The steps of man are in the hands of the Lord: how then shall a man
know his own ways?
There is none of us, but he naturaly, attributes to himself power to
conduct and govern himself, ann thinks that he has free will and liberty
to do well or evil. In which thoughts there is great pride: for by this means
man rauisheth to himself the honor and glory of God, and makes himself his
God and his Savior, and leaves his creature, as if he had not too do with
him, whereas man ought to humble himself, and know that he ought in no wise
to attribute that to himself which is appertinent to Exodus 15. 13. Deuteronomy. 32.
10, 11. 12. Ps. 6. and 25. 45. 89. and 27 11. Ier. 10. 23.
God. Therefore it is he that guides and governs us. We may also see it in
many prayers. Solomon following his prayers says,

Now the steps of man are in the hands of the Lord, etc. Whereunto Jeremy
accords. But we must note that Solomon speakeh not, of manners, deeds,
deliberations, and affections of man according as he were the son of Adam:
for therein is nothing but corruption, of the which God is not the author: It
is man which has corrupted himself by his own will. But Solomon speaks of a
man, who renouncing himself, and declining from his infirmity and natural
corruption, strives to think well, say well, and do well. We ought to know
manifestly, that God is the author of such steps according to the
testimonies aforesaid: and that Solomon speaks here of the steps of him
that forces himself. He shows it some what, when he uses in his speech
here a word taken of force and puisance, and signifies man: whereby we are
admonished that if we have any powerto apply ourselves to well doing, that we
should acknowledge it to come of god, and not attribute any prayers to ourselves
for the same, but let us say, The Lord is my strength and Exodus 15. 2. Job. 12.
13.
praise, and he is become my salvation, with him is wisdom and strength,
counsel, and understanding. Then seeing it is so that our steps are the
Lords, whose works are incomprehensible to man, it follows Psa. 28. 7. 6^
35. Esaias. 12. 2.
that man of himself, knows not what he has to think deliberate, say or
do, to fly from vice and follow virtue, as Solomon shows, saying,

How then shall a man know his own ways? Here he speaks of man
according as if he were son of Adam, and of nature corrupted: also he
shows it somewhat, when in his speech to signify man, he uses this word
Adam: and though he used it not, ye we ought to understand it so, seeing
that God has created man from the beginning to his own Image, and likeness,
and has made him right or straight: but being corrupted by sin, he has
made himself ignorant, dull, and bruitishe, not because he has not naturally
sufficient knowledge of the good way which he ought to hold, to the end he
be made inexcusable, if his life and conversation be not such, that by the
same, God may be glorified as he ought. When therefore Solomon adds this
present interrogation, it is as though he said: If man endued with virtue,
have Romans 1. 18.
need to beeguided, and governed by the Lord: by a far more reason the
sensual man, which makes no account to resist the affections of his flesh,
shall have no understanding to know that which he ought to follow, neither
makes he account thereof, but rather goes astray.

To know therefore and to understand our way, not that which we imagine or
find good in our own sight, but that which God shows us by his word,
(which is called ours, because we ought to follow it, without declining
either this way or that way, but to obey uprightly our Lord god) it is meet we
renounce our natural corruption, to wit, our first Adam, and that the holy
Ghost fortify us, and give us courage, and teach us the right will of God,
wherein lies our way, otherwise we shall remain dull and ignorant. It is not
therefore in us, nor in our free will, to do or understand that which is our
duty. Nevertheless, when God calls us, and teaches us by his word, we
ought to strive to walk in the way which he shows us, and not cease to
crave his conduict without attending new inspirations, nor that he should
take us visibly by the hand, for to lead us: for the word that is spoken to
us daily, is sufficient to do that same: for by it the holy Ghost teaches us,
and guides us, if we stop not our senses, and draw back ourselves.

25 It is a ruin for a man which deuoureth holiness: and after the vow, to
make inquiry.
Because we see not God with our eyes, and that we hear him not with our
ears, neither also it seems unto us that he neither hears nor sees us:
for this occasion we are not afraid to deprive him of the honor which we
do owe to him, and are abused so far, that we think not of the evil which
will come to us thereby. This while we cease not to be in danger of perdition,
as Solomon signifies, when he says,

It is a ruin for a man, etc. Here Solomon has regard to that which is
written of vows in the law, as God would that Leuit. 27. 9. Number. 30. 3. Psa.
76. 12.
one should do him this honor, to hold holy that which he has vowed to
him, and not to apply it to profane uses, but to yield it to him according to
his promise made. Also when by baptism we are dedicated to him, and sanctified
by the work, we ought to offer ourselves continually to his service, and to
separate ourselves from all profane things, to the end that we be
holiness to the Lord. Exo. 22. 31 Leui. 11. 44 and 19. 2 1. Pet. 1. 14
and that we yield ourselves to him, according as we have promised: and also
he calls us thereto, and commands us, You shall be holy unto me, otherwise we
shall devour holiness, appliyng it to another usage then is lawful, and this
should be after the vows to make inquiry, how we should be delivered
from rendering them to do then as we would ourselves. And in this sort we
jest at God, to be iested at of him again: and to be destroyed, as we well
deserve, then to the end that we fall not into such inconvenience, let us
follow with perseverance that which Saint Paul teaches us, I pray you
therefore brethren that you offer up your bodies Romans 12. 11. 2. Cor. 6. 14
a quick sacrifice, holy, and acceptable unto the Lord, which is your
reasonable service.

26 A wise king dispearseth the wicked, and brings the wheel over them.
Because there are not many kings, princes, and superiors in the world which
make account of vnderstauding or doing their duty, but despising government
and administration, they give themselves to pastime, and against all right and
reason, favor them Psa. 2. 10. Deuteronomy. 17. 18 1. Kings 3. 9.
that are wicked before the good and the just. For this cause Solomon knowing
that they had need to be well admonished, too the end they might return to
do their duty well, or else, be the more inexcusable, is not content to have
so often before warned the kings of that they had to do, but again here he
admonishes them of their duty saying,

A wise king etc. Wherein first of all he shows that kings have need of
wisdom, according to the admonition of David: And therefore they ought too
be careful, too regard the word according as it is commanded them, and
that they pray with Solomon, Thou shall give to thy servant a heart, which
has understanding to judge thy people, and to know the good from the evil. If
kings be so wise, they will not only understand that which they have to do,
but also minister right to every one, according as it appertains. Which
thing Solomon shows us here, although he express but dispersement and
scattering of the wicked: for this is done to conserve the right to the good,
and to make them live in peace.

He shows moreover that kings ought to be mortal enemies to the wicked, in
such wise, that as a mighty king pursuing his enemies and smiting them
athwart, makes some to falhere and other some there, so that they cannot rise
again, even so is it meet that they overthrow and destroy the wicked. And as
in the time when they fought and went to war with wagons or chariottes, they
ran the wheels over the bodies of the enemies, which were smitte^ down to
the ground, to bruze the^, to the end that they should not revive again: so
kings and superiors, ought to bruise the wicked, to the end they have no more
power to do evil to any body. He that would understand by the wheel any
kind of torment that the Jews used, it would be no inconvenience. For the
rest, when Solomon threateneth so the wicked of being dispersed and bruised, let
us understand that he warns us too fly from wickedness, and to give
ourselves to well doing according as God commands it in his law, and
according to the ordinances of our Princes and superiors which are wise and
prudent, and which seek not, but that God be served and honored according to
his word, and their subjects live in peace, and good unity together.

27 The lamp of the Lord is the soul of man, searching all the inward parts
of the belly.
The lamp that is clear and shyning serves to many uses: first to guide them
that walk by night in the dark, and to make them see their way, to the intent
they go not astray, nor smite themselves against any thing, or fall into any
ditch or cave. Secondly, it gives light to them that are locked in dark
prisons, wherein they see neither Sun nor moon: And for these two purposes
it is as it were half a life to them that use it, for those that are, or walk
in darkness, are as it were half dead. Thirdly, it serves to find things
hid in holes, and in the dark. Now that which the lamp does outwardly, and
corporally, the word of God which lives and reigns in our hearts by the holy
Ghost, does the same in wardly and spiritually. And therefore the scripture
calls it Lamp or light, and attributes to the word the things aforesaid:
and this is not without cause, for of ourselves we are and walk in darkness
of ignorance, not knowing what we have to do, and it conducteth us. Thy word
serves for a lamp to my feet, and as a light to my Ps. 119. 105. 130. Romans
7. 14. Ephesians. 2. 8. Ps. 19. 8. 9.
paths. Of ourselves we are dead, being servants and slaves to sin and
death, and the word lightneth us, freeth us, and quickneth us. Of ourselves
we are hypocrites, and cannot, nor will not know that which is in us. But the
word discovers and reuealeth the things that are hid in the depth of the
heart. And so it is not without cause that Solomon says,

The Lamp of the Lord, etc. For as the soul gives life to the John. 8. 31.
32. and 16. 8. Heb. 4. 12. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10.
body, so the word of God makes man quick: and principally when man by faith
cleaves to his promises. For by the law, we are accursed and condemned, in
so much as we cannot accomplish it, but we live, and are saved by the
assurance which we have in the promises: for the innocence, obedience,
justice, and holiness, of Jesus Christ are imputed to us. Nevertheless we
ought not to separate the law from the promises. For were it not Romans 5. 18.
19. 1. Cor. 5. 21. Deuteronomy. 30. 15. Leuit. 18. 5. Romans 3. 20.
our corruption and naughtiness, it were to us a clear lamp to rejoice and
quicken us as one may see. Also it searches well the inward parts of the
belly when it discovers to a man the malice of his heart. For by the law it
is given to know sin.

28 Mercy and truth shall preserve the king, and with loving kindness his
seat shall be established.
For as much as kings have not one only duty toward al their subjects
indifferently, but it behooves the^ to handle the wicked after one sort, and
the good after another: For this cause the holy scripture gives them now one
instruction, and now another, to the end that they may know how to render
every one his deserts. We have seen heretofore, that when Solomon would
encourage kings against the wicked, he has attributed to them, rigor,
severity and cruelty, and to make them meek and gentle toward the good he
Prou. 16. 14. 19. 20. 2. Prou. 16. 35.
has attributed to them mercy and benignity. And now again he warns kings
of their duty toward the good when he says, Mercy and truth, etc. And
therewithal he shows them, that to reign, and bear rule long time, and
without resistance, it is not meet that they use tyranny and cruelty,
disceyt, or disloyalty, but that they be merciful and true. Benignity
regards principally the subjects. For they are willingly induced to love
their superiors, and obey them freely, when they see them gentle, courteous,
pitiful, and that they are more inclyned to mercy then to rigor and severity.
Truth also regards the subjects. For it is not meet that Princes use fraud
to their subjects, but that they defend and keep both them and their goods
faithfully. Notwithstanding one may say that truth has respect principally to
them abroad, with whom Princes have any thing to practice. For if they will
reign peaceably and without contradiction, it is meet that they keep
faithfully their promises, and that they seek no way to break the faith
promised, neither by disceit nor violence or any other means toward them with
whom they have to do, if one will say that mercy regards men, and truth
God, I will notwithstande them: for it is necessary that kings serve God in
truth according to his word, eschewing al things contrary to the same, and
making it be kept of their subjects as much as in them lies, to the end
that God be honored as he requires. And also, as it is so that they hold
the seat of God, who is just and true in all his judgments, it is meet that
they judge with justice and truth, without respect of persons, or
covetousness of gifts and presents, and that they repulse the liars,
flatterers, talebearers, and backbiters, punishing them, and destroying them
with all false witnesses. Thus doing they shall be preserved, and established in
their thrones, as the good kings have tried it. Pharao has not understood
this same, neither has he been preserved, but after many plagues has been
destroyed in the waters of the Sea: one may join Solomon's son who would not
handle his people gently. If therefore kings and princes will not come to the
like condition, let them not lift up their hearts over their brethren: but let
them follow the meekness of Moses, Iosue, David, Josias, Ezechias, and such
others, which have been preserved, and have established their Deuteronomy. 17. 20
thrones by benignity and mercy. And because it is not most commonly
profitable for the people to change their kings and princes, when they have
them that govern well: subjects ought to understand that they are here
warned to pray to God for their superiors, to the end it may please him to
preserve them. And whiles they live in this humility and obedience, that they
give occasion to their rulers to be courteous and just, for to follow their
head.

29 The nobility of young men is their virtue: and a gray head, is the honor
of the aged.
It seems at the first, that Solomon speaks according to the fantasy of
young folks, which glorify themselves in their force, vaunte of their acts
which have any appearance of virtue, and esteem themselves noble, and worthy
to be had in estimation with the world, when they have behaved themselves
valiantly. And also that he speaks according to the opinion and desire of old
men to whom it seems, that it is a great matter to have lived so long that
their bearde and hears are waxen white, and will that one honor them because
of their old age, which shows himself in the whiteness of their hears,
although in themselves be neither knowledge, skill, nor prudence. And if we
should take this sentence thus, it were not far amiss: notwithstanding, it
behooves us to understand, that Solomon has not spoken it to please either
the young or the old, nor to make us stick at their fantasies and affections.
But know we that when he says, The nobleness of young men is their virtue,
he shows first to fathers and mothers, and to al them which have government
or superintendence, if they will that their children, or inferiors become
honorable and renowned, or worthy to be accounted excellent, that they ought
to be careful to teach virtue to youth, and to accustom them to the same: not
unto that which one calls virtue according to the world, which is to be
courageous, and to have blood in the nails, to render evil for evil, and to
do outrage and violence unto them which one has in hate, or to take great
pains to become rich, and to keep (as one would say) a good house, such men
according to the world are willingly esteemed noble. But that in following the
word of God, one give good example of life to the younger sort, that one teach
them, admonish them, reprehend them, and correct them, and that one accustom
them to apply their time in good works, and that they learn to have
charity, yea toward their very enemies. See here the virtue, wherein
consists the noblenes, excellency, glory, and honor, of young folks.
Secondly he shows that the younger sort are knauish and infamous, worthy of
al rebuke and reproach, if not being well instructed they fashion not their
manners in all humility, and modesty, temperance, honesty, holiness and
justice, according to gods word: for in the obedience and faith of the same
there is virtue, and not otherwise. Also therein it is that God craves one to
apply his force, Deuteronomy. 6. 5. Ephesians. 6. 16. 17
and S. Paul shows well that there is virtue in the word: and when Solomon
adioyneth, And a gray head is the honor of the aged: he shows first of al to
old folks, that they ought to be grave temperate, wise, prudent, acknowledging
that God has done them this honor to have maintained them in this life so
long that they are waxen white, and to have given them space to learn virtue,
and follow the same, that they might have vice in disdain, and be an
edification to the younger sort. Secondly, he shows to them that are young,
that they ought not to puff up themselves in pride and disdain against their
elders, although for the feebleness, and debility of the body they seem
unprofitable, and a let or hinderance, but in all humility and gentleness they
ought to forbear them, and with all care and diligence to assist, and honor
them, in such sort that they be wholly at their commandment. It is necessary
that we Leui. 19. 23.
learn this in this present sentence, otherwise there will be no excellency
in the same. Let us not think therefore that Solomon has forced himself to
teach us carnal or temporal nobility, whereof the world makes account, through
some force, magnanimity and harddinesse, which they perceive in the deeds and
feats of some personage led by glory and ambition: nor that he makes great
account of the white hears which are on the chin, or on the head of old men:
for all this passes, but the virtues which he teaches us in this sentence, are
in eternal memory before God, and they which follow them shall remain for ever.

30 Bruised wounds purge evil: and stripes in the inward parts of the body.
When we are bodyly sick, we will be handeled gently, and it seems unto us
that the Physicians and Surgeons are discourteous, and have no compassion upon
us, when they ordeine us sharp medicines, or apply to us any pearcing
ointment, or other thing which augmenteth the dolor for the present time.
Nevertheless it is needful and necessary that sometimes one spare not the
patient for to purge and cleanse him of the filth and corruption which is in
his body. Otherwise he is in danger of his person for the life present. Also
although we be very evil, and that this euilnesse has so corrupted us, that al
our conversation is polluted and defiled thereby, and that there is in us no
entire thing: nevertheless we would have others to flatter us, and account us
for honest men: and think that they which admonish us, reprehende us, check
us, and threaten us, accuse us, and condemn us, are our enemies and hate us.
But it is necessary to purge the inward naughtiness which corrupts al our
conversation, that men rebuke us sharply, and threaten us rigorously, and that
they plundge us even into the depth of hell, making us despair of ourselves,
as if without remedy we were wounded, and murdered even unto the death. This
is the way to cleanse the wicked, which are very much infected, corrupted with
vice and iniquity, and yet flatter themselves in their own diseases. Solomon
pronounces it so, saying, Bruised wounds purge evil. David after the
adultery and murder flattered himself well, when he made no account to
confess his faults. But the sharp and sour reprehension of Nathan, served
him for a purgation. So did the reprehension of Saint Paul to the Corinthians.
But let us note that Solomon speaks not of the wicked reproved: for to such
men rorrection profits nothing, but to make them obstinat, and bring them in
despair, as Cain, the whole world destroyed by the flood, 2. Sa. 12. 12. 1.
Cor. 5. 1 2. Cor. 7. 8
Sodom, Pharao, Saul.

The xxi. Chapter.
1 THE kings heart is in the hand of the Lord: Like the rivers of water, so
he may turn it whither soever he will.
THE kings of the earth are in great estimation and admiration with the
world, men fear them and worship the^, men tremble at their puisa^ce
honoring their highness, and humbling themselves unto them, rendering them
obedience, and fearing to provoke their anger, submitting themselves wholly to
their will and pleasure. Insomuch that they seem to incline the hearts of their
subjects, whither it please them. And it is no marvel if kings be so honored
of the world, seeing that god honors them, giving them his titles, calling
them gods, and superior powers, placing them in his seat, to exercise
justice, and judgment indifferently and uprightly, and willing that men
should submit themselves to them without any resista^ce or rebellion. So kings
make themselves redoubted as much ae they can, to the end to submit their
subjects hearts to them, and bow and order them as it seems them good:
this while what highness soever they have, (will they nil they) yet they have a
superior which has another manner of puisance above them, then they have above
their subjects and inferiors, for they hate not the power to govern their
subjects hearts at their pleasure, although they have authority to command,
and the other ought to obey. But God which is their sovereign Lord, and
ruler, has not only power to command, but also to dispose their hearts at
his pleasure, without let or resistance at al. Solomon shows it them well,
where he compares their hearts to rivers of water saying,

The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, etc. Kings ought not therefore
for to vaunt of their powers: for although rivers swell sometimes, and flow
over with such impetuositie as though they would carry al away with them: and
although also kings have hautie and stout hearts, and think themselves so
mighty, that they ween none may resist them, but that they shall cut and carry
away al at their pleasure: nevertheless as by sluices, rampires, or other
invention one may resist a great river, and stop it from doing harm: so it is
easy to God to set a stay for kings, that they hurt not with the pride and
hautinesse of their hearts: as Solomon signifies clearly, when he compares
their hearts not to great rivers, but only to little running brooks which
turn their courses easily which way one pleases. It is not fit also that they
should vaunt themselves of their free will: for as rivers turn not rhemselues
this way, or that way, nor cannot do it, but men turn their courses according
as it seems them good which have to do therewith: So as Solomon says,

God turns the kings heart whither he will: He says not that he turns it
to this or to that, but whither he will, for as the scriptures show us: he
inclines one to one thing, and another to another thing: one man now to one
thing, and by and by too a contrary. He turned the king of Egypts heart in
Iosephes time, to do well to Jacob and his kindred. Contrariwise he turned
Genesis 45. 16.
his successors heart, to misuse the children of Israel after the death of
Joseph. This inclination ought to be well known of us, when God says to
Moses. But I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a
mighty hand. And yet more manifest Exodus 1. 8. and 3. 19. and 4 21.
when God says, And I will harden his heart, etc. He has turned David's
heart to goodness, as appears, when he says, From this day forward, the
spirit of the Lord shall prosper in David. And afterward has inclined it to
evil: but one might make here two objections: the one, that kings are not
culpable, when they do evil, 1. Sam. 16. 13. 2. Sam. 24.
seeing that God enclineth their hearts thereto: the other, that God is the
cause, and author of sin. An answer to the first objection, although God
do turn the hearts of kings to evil, yet are they nevertheless culpable: for
god by his just judgment, which is incomprehensible to us, provoke them to
evil, either to punish their former sins by other sins, and make them more
fautie, Romans 1. 24.
or for to punish and chastise them whom he thinks good, as he stirred up
Sennacherib, and other kings against his people of Israel: or to try and
exercise his chosen ones to patience: as he has by the minister of Satan
stirred up the Chaldians and Sabians Iam. 1. 13. 14
against Job: but the wicked having no knowledge of the judgments divine, no
reverence to the providence of God, nor any fear of his word, are carried
away by their own concupisences. Likewise the wicked do not refer their
faults unto God, but being reproved by their own conscience, confess their
wickedness, as Pharao knew well that he was an offendour, Saul makes the
same confession or very like. David elected of God, having numbered Exodus 9. 27.
1. Sam. 24. 18. and 26. 21. 2. Sam. 24. 10.
the people, lays not the fault on God, but confesses his own offense.
Wherefore for a brief answer to the second objection, we see that God is
not the author of sin: for the rest, search the Institutions of John Calvin.
So Princes and Magistrates are taught to have God in honor and reverence,
craving his conduct and governance, and that they fear to be given up into a
reprobate sense, as many have been. Also subjects are admonished to pray for
their superiors, otherwise they are in danger lest it will happen to them
according to the threatninges which are in diverse 1. Tim. 2. 1. Esa. 3. 1. Ose.
13. 11.
places. For the rest, if kings which are mighty, as they think, and which
make themselves redoubted, have need to be governed by GOD, who turns their
hearts at his pleasure, it is not meet that we promise ourselves any thing
against the will of God.

2 Every man's way seems right in his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the
heart.
Man is so much given to flatter, praise, and esteem of himself: that he
neither can nor will find any thing in himself worthy of Pro. 3. 5. 6. 7. and
12. 15. and 14. 12. and 16 2. 25.
reprehension, but persuades with himself, that all that he wills, thinks,
enterpriseth, says, or does, is good and just: wherein he is deceived, as
Solomon pronounces it. And because so foolish an opinion, cannot easily be
rooted out of the thoughts of man, therefore Solomon rebukes it now again,
when he says, Every man's way, etc.

3 To do justice and judgment, is more acceptable to the Lord then
sacrifice.
From the beginning of the world, men have thought to do God great service,
when they have offered up sacrifie, of beasts which they killed, of the which,
or of other goods of the earth, they made great oblation and after the flood,
they have not forgotten this custom. And as men have esteemed it, so the Lord
has always Genesis 4. 3. 4. Genesis 8. 20. and 12. 7. 8. and 13. 18.
held acceptable the sacrifices of the faithful, who offered them in firm
faith, and true repentance, regarding the true Messiah which ought to be
sacrificed only and perfect for the remission of their sins, whereat they
were sore agreeued and displeased. And then when he gave the ten
commandementes, he ordained sacrifices, which is a good argument that they
were acceptable too him, as is seen in Leuiticus: I have spoken specially of
the faithful, which are neither hypocrites, nor ambitious, nor thieves, nor
murderers. For although the faithless full of al iniquity, violence, and
extortion, did offer oblations, and sacrifice, which had great appearance of
holiness and religion: and that they showed by Ceremonies that they had a
meruellous great zeal to the service of GOD, nevertheless their sacrifices
pleased not the Lord, but rather provoked him to wrath and anger, and he
despised them as things abominable: but he wills that the wicked should
turn from his evil ways refraining to do injury and violence and giving
himself to al right and equity, in restoring to every man that which belongs
unto him, helping the oppressed and afflicted, Psa. 40. 7. and 50. 7.
and delivering them from the hands of those which do them wrong: which thing
apperteineth principallly to kings and superiors of the earth: but it is
meet also that every one apply himself therein, as much as is possible. And
so his works shall be agreeable to the Lord, more then all the oblations of
beasts, or fruits of the earth, Solomon pronounces it thus in brief, saying,

To do justice and judgment, etc. He shows us in one word that which we
have principally to do, to the end we study not on things, which have a
fair appearance outwardly, and bring no profit, aid nor succor to the poor
afflicted. Also he reproves in brief the kings and governors of the earth,
which are hypocrites, as were the Scribes and Pharisees, which are oppressors.
He reprehendeth likewise all hypocrites, which love to be seen, and praised,
and in the mean while have no care of their Mat. 22. 23. 25. Esa. 1. 10. 23
neighbors, as are in the Papacy, the eaters of the crucifixe, as also are
they which come to sermons of the word, and communicate the Sacraments, and
yet stick not to be replenished with frauds deceites, in humanity, and
cruelty. Wherefore let us not think that Solomon reproves sacrifices, under
the which he comprehends all the works commanded in the first table: but only
the abuse committed therein, neither is he content that one do justice and
judgment, for one ought principally to maintain the honor and glory of God,
and to observe true religion, which is commanded us in the first table. But by
the works of the second Table, the observation of all the law is set down:
for if we abstain to do injury to our neighbors, if in as much as in us
lies, we do succor them which are oppressed, and deliver them, if finally
we employ ourselves to do the works of charity, we give signification of
the fear of God, by the which the fruits of justice, judgment and charity
are brought forth. And therefore although one cannot love god, unless he love
his neighbor: notwithstanding, this is not to say, that the love of God
proceeds of the love of his neighbor. But if we love God truly, it is
necessary that we love our neighbor. As also we have the commandment of
him, That he that loves God, loves also his neighbor. It is true, that if
we love our neighbor, we give a sign that we love God: for the love that we
1. Ioh. 4. 20. 21. Romans 13. 10.
bear toward our neighbor, is the fruit which brings forth the love
which we have to God ward.

And so when Saint Paul says, That he which loves his neighbor, has
fulfilled the law, he exempteth us not from the works of the first Table:
for his intent was to speak in this point of the duty which the law
commands us to do to our neighbors, whereto we would not apply
ourselves, if we did not love them: but loving them truly, we do to them al
duty. And mean while it is true, that the law is accomplished by charity
toward our neighbors, the which proceeds not, but of the love that we
have to God, and thereof yields testimony, as the effect does of the cause.

4 An high look, and a proud heart, which is the lantern of the wicked, is
sin.
When the wicked allow of themselves in their own hearts, and that they think
they are somewhat more excellent then others, they cannot guide themselves, but
they must give some outward sign of this pride and arrogancy, and persuade
themselves, that in so doing, they do well, and by this means, keep their
credit, and come to the end of their attemptes gallantly: but in such sort
of dealing, they abstain not to do injury and violence to their neighbors,
against whom they lift up themselves fiercely, and take joy and delight
therein. And so there is great wickedness in their proceedings, estate, and
joy. Solomon shows it by this word sin, when he says,

An high look, and a proud heart, etc. Wherein we have to note first of al,
That an high look, (as al other brauities and pompes of the body) is a sign
and token of the pride which is in the heart. And therefore one calls it
pride, and it is sin, as it is judged naturally to be without the
scriptures: for men will say, Behold a great pride, to wit, when one sees any
to be very glorious, and bear his head on high, or use any other gesture
contrary to humility and lowliness. And they will say, he has a stout and
lofty heart: Therefore, with nature the Scripture imputes this to pride, and
blames, and condemns it, and threateneth to destroy it, as has been seen
to happen to some, who have been destroyed for their pride which they showed by
outward gesture. And because we will not be so beaten down by the wrath of
the Lord, it be hooueth us to humble ourselves, as well in our hearts, as in
our gesture and dooinges: so that we may protest, Lord I Esa. 2. 11. and 3.
15. and 5. 14 Dan. 4. 26. and 5. 22. Psa. 131. 1.
am not high minded, I have no proud looks, etc. Thus doing, humility
shall be deemed a virtue in us, and we shall be exalted of our God.

Note secondly, that the pride which is betokened by high looks, and a proud
heart, is called the Lantern of the wicked: because they guide themselves by
the same, and therein place their joy and pleasure: for they think they should
not do their business half well, if they should not seek by pride to extol
themselves above others. Note we thirdly, that of the proud heart proceeds
the high look, with all the other fruits of pride, which are in great number,
which we ought to take to be comprehended here under one kind. Let us note
finally, that seeing the lamp of the wicked, is imputed as sin to them, they
make of vice, virtue, and so contrary. Esa. 3. 20.


5 The thoughts of the diligent, are only upon plenteousnes: but he that is
hasty, comes verily to poverty.
We are al slouthful by nature, as we ourselves well perceive, yet
nevertheless, we think that we are worthy to have much substance: but we
judge in the mean while, that there is none but the diligent that ought to
have plenty of goods: wherein we should judge aright, if we understood who
they were that are diligent, for Pro. 10. 3. 4. 5. and 11. 25. and 12. 11. and
13. 4. 23. 25. and 14. 4. 23. and 20. 13.
we will consent to that which Solomon has spoken heretofore, and to that which
he says presently: That the thoughts of the diligent are only upon
plenteousnes, etc. He speaks but of thoughts, but he shows therwithal, that
they are not vain and light thoughts, which are without effect, for he says,
Of the diligent, that is to say, of him which thinks not to covet only, as
the slothful do, but thinks, in employing himself carefully to his
business, to the end it may be dispatched duly, and may profit and yield him
such abundaunce, that he may be far from poverty, and need, which if we
will be free from, we ought not to proceed in our affairs, rashly, and
without consideration (for there is only plenteousnesse, where the diligent
thinks well without rashenesse) as the hasty do, which boil with inordinate
desire, and never obtain their wishes soon enough, as they think, nor such
plenteousnes as they would have: and because they proceed in their
enterprises without good consideration: in steed of having plenty with the
diligent, they run into poverty. As Solomon adds, But he that is hasty,
comes verily to poverty. He is not content to affirm simply this same, but
because he speaks against the sense of many (for we never are soon enough
come to our desires) he strives to confirm his saying, by this word verily,
or only. He has already said the same. Then although there were none other
fault but that he which is hasty, proceeds rashly, and without advise, he
deserves well to be poor and needy, but there are Pro. 20. 21.
other foul faults. One is, that he mistrusteth of the bounty and providence
of God. Contrariwise, he which believes, is not hasty. The other is, that
willing to enrich himself, he falls into temptation, and many foolish
desires, which plundge men in perdition, etc. We Esa. 28. 16. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10.
see likewise by this Scripture, that it is not lawful to covet plenteousnes,
although of it self it be good, and that a man which thinks diligently upon
his business, may lawfully possess it, not setting his heart thereupon. A man
therefore being ready to think upon his business, and diligent to do it,
may possess the plenty which proceeds thereof, with a sure and sound
conscience, and in the Psalm. 62. 11. Luke 12. 15 Mat. 6. 19. 1. Tim. 6. 7. and
17. Hebr. 3. 5. 6.
mean while, shall take heed of covetousness. And to do this well, he shall follow
that which is said in diverse places.

6 To hoard up riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanity tossed too and fro of
them that seek death.
We do al naturally fear poverty, and fly from it as much as is possible
for us, for we see that the poor endure many miseries, and are despised, and
forsaken of the world, yea, hated of their own borne brethren. As Solomon has
said, if one arise against Pro. 19. 7.
them, it seems that they ought to be incontinently quailed: for they have
neither power nor succor, but languish in this world: insomuche that it
seems, they are continually in death. Contrariwise, naturally we love riches,
seeking for the^, and hoarding it up as much as is possible: for we persuade
ourselves that when we have heaped store of worldly goods, in gold and silver,
in houses and other heritages, we shall not be subject to themiseries of this
present life, we shall get many friends, which will favor us, honor us, and
present us with all pleasure and service. And as it seems, we shall be in such
prosperity, that we shall not think to dye, although we know and confess,
that we must needs dye. But to attain to their riches, men imagine frauds,
cousonages, vsuries, theftes, and wicked dealinges, and to practice it, and
atchiue it, they lie, swear, and forswear, they curse and banne, they
renounce God, and give themselves to the Devil. The most part of Merchantes
and Artificers know this same. And if one rebuke them for such wickedness,
straight way they answer, That they should be otherwise fools and should
sell nothing. And in case fathers deal thus wickedly, they will that their
children resemble them, or be rather worse: for at twelve or thirteen years
of age, they set them to keep shoppes, and teach them their crafts, or
rather deceites, by the which they obtain unjustly the substance of the
buyers. And in this manner, they think to establish their state well, and to be
perpetuated either in themselves, or in their children and successors, they
think still to launche forwards, and make themselves strong enough to shun
death: but in steed of exalting themselves, they perish miserably, and go to
Death. Solomon speaks it plainly, when he says,

To hoard up riches with a deceitful tongue, is vanity tossed too and fro of
them that seek death. Wherein we see, that that which the wicked fear,
happens unto them. Moreover, we are admonished, not to be careful to heap
up much goods in this world, seeing it is but vanity and perdition.

7 The Rapines of the wicked shall destroy them: for they have refused to do
justice.
Because it is seen that the wicked which take and rauishe al they can get
either by deceit and guile, or by violence and oppression, or by receite of
gifts and brybes, or other means unlawful, do prosper in the view of the
world, and have credit and authority and that it seems that they be of long
endurance and live at their ease, for this cause many snatch up goods where
they can find them, and for the most part unjustly. Of whom the principal and
captains are the judges and governors of the earth, which deal by respect of
persons, and love and take brybes and gifts, too do wrong to him that has
good right. And although the Scriptures often complain of such pillars, and
raueners, and threatens them destruction, as has been alleged heretofore,
and also their consciences reprove and reprehend them, and they themselves
condemn them which are petie thieves in respect of them, and that they ought
to understand that as they condemn the petie thieves to death, so they
themselves are worthy of ruin and destruction. Nevertheless they think
that to take on all hands and on al sides, is the best way for to make
themselves great and mighty, and have a lasting house, and as it were
perpetual. But because they cannot use such trade, but by renouncing all
equity and right, and doing wrong and injury outrage and violence to their
neighbors dispoiling them of their substance, for this cause their injury
shall return unto themselves. As Solomon pronounces it saying, The rapines of
the wicked shall destroy them. Wherein he speaks principally of kings
judges, and governors of the earth, which are the greatest thieves and
raueners, as is aforesaid. The reason which he adds, shows well that it is
of such men that he speaks, when he says,

For they have refused to do justice. True it is that we ought al to do our
endeavor in helping each one his neighbor, and defending him, inasmuche as we
can, from the yldealing of the wicked. But because the Superiors of the earth
are placed in the seat of God, and that their office (as they can well tell) is
to do justice: It is lawful to understand, that this present sentence
pronounces principally, that they shall perish wickedly: for they make no
account to do right, in ayding the feeble, and defending them, but rather eat
and devour them: as it is laid to their charge, and they Psalm. 82. 2. 6. 7.
are manaced destruction. Ia. 33. 1. and


8 There is a man, whose way is froward, and strange: but the work of the
pure man is right.
There is none but he thinks or strives to persuade himself, that he is an
honest man, and that he walks so uprightly, that in him is nothing worthy
of reprehension: so proud and haughty is the nature of man, striving to
forget his own iniquities, which are continually before his eyes. Insomuch,
that if he commit any thing or imagine against his neighbor, that which he
would not should be done unto himself, it can not be but his conscience will
reprove him. Notwithstanding, he resists it as every one may feel in
himself naturally, and as Solomon has sometimes spoken, when he says here
above, verse, 2. That every man's way seems right in his own eyes. And now
he shows openly, that this opinion of uprightness is false, when he says,
There is a man whose way is froward and strange. Wherein we have to note, that
although it be said, The Lord has looked from heaven upon the children of
Psalm. 14. 2 Esai. 64. 6. Iere. 17. 9.
men, to see if there were any which understood and sought after God, but they
are al gone astraie, etc. And we are al as it were filth, etc. The heart is
deceitful and froward, more then al other things, etc. Nevertheless, Solomon
condemns not vsal, because that God accepts the works of him that is
regenerated, which Solomon calls pure, saying,

But the work of the pure man is right. For although being left off in the
corruption of our nature, we walk in froward and strange ways, doing
wrongful, and abominable works, which lead us to perdition, and that we
cannot be so just, but we must needs sin: nevertheless, when our Lord
Jesus Christ by his holy spirit mortifieth our wicked concupiscenses, and
disordinate affections, he purges us so, that our affections are holy, good,
and just, and cannot be otherwise, insomuche, as the holy Ghost conducteth
them, and guides them. The it follows, that we take pleasure to walk
uprightly, and we cannot be turned therefro, to abandon entirely the right
way, and withdraw ourselves wholly from righteousness for we have the seed of
God which is perpetual, that is to say, which makes them to persevere in
holiness and justice which are engendered of God by his seed. For whosoever is
born of God, does not sin, for his seed remains in him, etc. This 1. Ioh.
3. 9.
is not to say, but this seed is sometimes choked of them, that are
regenerate, as it has been in David, but it is never wholly extinguished.

9 It is better to dwell in a corner on the house top, then with a brauling
woman in awide house.
God at the beginning created man and woman, and joined them together in
marriage, to the end they should live together in peace and unity, whereby
they might have joy and consolation and be an aid and comfort one to the
other, as members of one body. And principally it is said that the woman is
an help too man. But men and women despise the end and purpose of GOD, Genesis 2.
18.
and not weighing the duty which they owe one to another, seek for earthly
goods and substance, and covet earnestly, the highness and magnificencie, the
glory and honor of the world. When they are about to marry, they enquire not
principally of the life and manners of the man or woman, that is to be had, but
above all things they have regard to the goods and riches, to the might,
credit authority, and noblenes of the parentage, that thereby they may become
great and have support and credit, and a great number of people, which shall
wonder at their riches, reverence them and court them: Or at leastwise that
they may have wherewith too walk by their neighbors, live at their ease, and
use great traffic or have inheritance of great revenue. Now because in this
sort they forsake God, and regard more the world, it comes to pass that for
the confusion of such persons, and to punish their vanity and pride their
greedines and avarice, God ouerturneth the laws of marriage: So that a man that
will marry, insteede of finding an honest wife, which should support and aid
him, give him peace, joy and consolation, God gives him a proud and fierce
wife which serves to no other purpose, but to torment and vex him, braule and
make war with him, and put him to great trouble and sorrow: when a man has
met with such a match, he says in his heart, that which Solomon
avouches, saying,

It is better to dwell in a corner on the house top, etc. Also the wife that
will marie, in steed of finding an honest man which will love her, and be
acceptable and pleasant to her, meets with a proud and cruel man, a churl,
and one with who^ she can have no quietness. Then says she also in her heart,
That it is better to dwell in a corner on the house top, then with a brawling
husband in a wide house. Behold here how we should apply this sentence,
although Solomon make mention but of the woman, and not without cause: for
seeing that the woman is chosen by the man, and was created to assist and obey
him, and be subject to him, as the Church is to Jesus Christ: It is good
reason, that she be rebuked by name, when in steed of keeping the household
in silence and peace, she Ephe. 5.
lifts up herself against her husband, and resists him: also because by
proof women are more prompt and ready to strive against their husbands, and
that this vice is most common amongst them, Solomon speaks the rather of the
brawling woman, and blames her: who in as much as she is inferior to her
husband, she ought to suffer patiently the severity of him, rather then to
move debates, and strive against him. Note we also, that when the top of the
house, whereupon one endures great heat and alteration in the summer, and
great cold in the winter, is preferred before the company of a brawling woman,
how rich or noble soever she be: women are warned to walk warily in all
humility and obedience, and be gentle, pleasant, and loving, as they are
taught to be in many places of the scripture, which have been sometimes
heretofore alleged.

10 The soul of the ungodly wishes evil, and his neighbor shall find no
favor in his sight.
There is none but he would be esteemed an honest man, but in the mean
while, al (as it were) have their hearts enraged, and their affections poisoned,
their desires replenished with ra^cor and hate, with strife and will to revenge,
their determinations and enterprises full of inhumanitie and cruelty, of
outrage, violence, and oppression, of murder and homicide. Solomon knew man's
inward wickedness to be such, that they had neither fear nor knowledge of
God, Iere. 17. 9.
but despised al correction, and scorned thereat. And therefore he complains
saying, The soul of the ungodly wishes evil. This is not that he could
sound the hearts, and pearce the inward cogitations: for that appertains to
God only: But he had this knowledge of the desires and affections: as also
we may have by the fruits which proceed thereof. He sees how the wicked
have no pleasure to do works of mercy, nor use charity toward them which
have need and necessity thereof, but rather to do them all the wrong that they
can, not sparing them any more then a hungry Lion, when he has caught his
pray. Solomon expresses such evil fruits, and complains thereof saying,

And his neighbor shall find no favor in his sight, or shall obtain no
mercy, or shall not be spared. The Hebrewe tongue imports al these three
senses in one word: and yet there is no contrariety, although there be
diversity. Also the innocent are diversely despised, and ill handled of the
ungodly, who will not once lend them a good look, nor use any courtesy
toward them, but rather use them as cruelly as they can invent. Know we
moreover, that Solomon taxes here the hypocrites principally, which
counterfeit Saints and Lambs, either by ceremonies or by words or by other
deeds, and gesture, by the which they seek to intrapp them which are not well
advised, and to oppress them, to make their profit by the loss and damage of
others.

11 When the scorneful is punished, the ignorant takes better heed: and when
the wise is instructed, he will receive understanding.
Because this present sentence has been already handled, we Prou. 19. 25.
will note only, that the repetition here made, is very necessary, to the end
we may learn to regard nearly the punishments which happen to the wicked,
either by the judges mouth, or by wars, or by other means, which they
thought not upon. And that these punishements serve to school us, to the end
we may fear to despise, with obstinacy and stubbornness, the instructions,
admonitions, and reprehensions which are made to us, and the good counsels and
aduisements which are given us by the word, knowing that we cannot have too
many examples, to advise us, and bring us in fear. For we are so foolish of
our own nature, that easily we are persuaded, and drawn, to follow the
wickedness of mockers and despisers of al holiness and religion. On the other
side we cannot be so wise, but we shall have great need to increase in
knowledge and understanding. And we ought to take heed, not to think nor say
that we have enough, and that no man has to do to instruct us.

12 The just man instructs the house of the wicked: But for wickedness, God
overthrows the ungodly.
Although the ungodly persecute the just, as though they had deserved it, and
despise to take example by their godly conversation, and although they reject
al good doctrine as unprofitable or hurtful: Notwithstanding the just which is
just indeed, loses not his courage, he cease not to show himself a mirour
of holy life, nor to teach the wicked, counselling them and correcting them,
accusing them and threatening them with the wrath and vengeance of God, and
condemning them as worthy of the horrible judgments of God. Solomon signifies
this when he says, The just man instructs the house of the wicked. He
speaks not so without good proof, for he was in the time of the Prophets
who were of an unstained life and sound doctrine, and ceased not to teach,
admonish, correct, and threaten the wicked according as God commanded them. And
before that time there were many just men which had done the like: As Noe which
was a just man, and was Herald of justice, and condemned the world. One may
here set down Abraham, Lot, Moses, Iosue, and others which were before
Solomon's Genesis 6. 9. 2. Pet. 2. 5. Heb. 11. 7.
time. After whom also there were many other just men, and amongst the rest,
the Apostles of our Lord and Savior and their successors, which have lived
holily, and purely administered the word. And because in the Hebrew tougue, one
word has diverse significations, some for instruct, say consider wisely. And
it is well said: for it is very convenient to regard that which the wicked do,
and to take heed thereof, that we consent not to their works, but rather
reprove them thereof. And also of that which happens or shall happen unto
them, to the end we envy not their prosperity, which is of no endurance, and
after the same, they are in perpetual misery. Other say, to make prosper, as
Abraham made the king of Sodom to prosper, and Jacob Laban, God caused Joseph
to make his master to prosper. But although one instruct the wicked, although
Genesis 14. 16. and 30. 29. and 39. 2.
one consider the state of his house, to seek to refourme it, although one
make his goods to fructify and prosper: Nevertheless because he despises the
word, and is puffed up with pride, and addicted to all wickedness, for this
cause nothing profits him, but all the goods that he gets, be they
spiritual or temporal, turn to his destruction: which if it be not in this
world, God cease not to revenge it at last, as Solomon expresses saying,

But for wickedness God overthrows the ungodly. Here Solomon says nothing,
but the wicked have proved it at al times, and do prove it yet. Also the
Law and the Prophets are full of such threatninges. But although the wicked are
worthy of no good, and that they are threatened destruction: Nevertheless it
is not lawful for us to wish them evil, much less to work them the same:
but rather to desire their welfare, and chiefly the health of their souls, we
ought to instruct them and show them the way of health, and not to be
affraide of loosing our pains: for when we bear the word of truth
uprightly, we are a good smell to the Lord. Thus doing, God will not overthrow
us with the wicked to destroy 2. Cor. 2. 14.
us, but if we be comprehended with the wicked in temporal destruction, God
will gather us again to himself, and deliver our souls from perdition, but he
will destroy for ever the souls of the wicked without any remission.

13 He that stops his ear at the cry of the poor, shall cry himself
also, and not be heard.
God has showed himself very merciful toward us, when before we ever
called upon him, he provided for our necessity, creating al things for our
use, and giving us plenty thereof. Nevertheless to the end we should not be
ungrateful, but acknowledge whence this comes, he permits us to have
poverty, and will that we understand, that without his grace, liberality, and
blessing, our goods profit us nothing: to the end that we may be careful to
crave that he will give us our daily bread: as Jesus Christ teaches us to ask:
and as our good God and father is merciful unto us, and gives us liberally
that which we request: So he will that we resist, according to our power the
poverty of our neighbors, distributing to them any goods, as we would they
should do unto us, if we were in their case. And herein he requesteth
nothing but that which is reasonable: as we ought naturally to understand
without scripture. Notwithstanding to waken our nature, which is negligent to
do good to the needy, and to show us that he has great care over the
poor, he recommendeth them to us by diverse commandementes, in the Law and
Prophets, and in the wrytings of the Apostles and Evangelists: adding
promises, and also threatenings to the commandementes, to give hope to the
liberal and pityful, and to afray the cruel and unmerciful, and make them the
more inexcusable. As has been alleged heretofore. But because that God
executes not presently his threatenings Pro. 14. 31. and 19. 17.
or forgets them easily: and therefore it is needful that one repeat them,
as Solomon well knew: For this cause to the former promises and threatenings, he
adds another saying,

He that stops his ear, etc. This present threatening is executed often in
this life. For one sees that by wars, lawing, famine and evil government
many rich men are impouerished and when they crave any thing, then they
obtain not that which they desire, and whereof they have need. The scripture
also gives us examples thereof. As of Esau who soulde his byrthright. One
sees Genesis 25. 29. and 27. 34. Heb. 12. 17. Luke. 16. 19. Mat. 25. 14. Iam. 2.
13.
that Esau was given to his pleasures, which is a sign that he made no
account of the poor. As also the younger of the two sons spending his
portion prodigally, shows well that he had no care nor regard of the poor.
It is executed also very horribly after this life in hell, in damnation and
death eternal, as is seen in the scriptures. Also as we ought to be liberal
of our earthly goods toward the indigent to sustain this bodily life: so we
ought to have pity on the souls of them, which have need to have their
fautes pardoned: Otherwise God will not Mat. 12. 14. 15. and 18. 23.
pardon us ours.

14 A privy reward pacifieth displeasure: And a gift in the bosom stilleth
furiousness.
When men began to multiply on the earth, it was corrupted Genesis 6.
before God, and replenished with extortion and wrong. Wherein we have
argument that the feeble and weak were oppcessed, that the poor and needy
were despised and forgotten. For this cause God was much an angered, and
destroyed the world by the flood. Also the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and
Gomorrha is multiplied, Genesis 18. 20.
and their sins are very grievous, etc. Ezechiel expounds Eze. 16. 49.
what this cry and sin was. For this cause Gods wrath was kindled against
them, and he destroyed them. Herein we ought to be advertised, that if we
resemble them, we shall also perish by the just vengeance of God. Now to
shun this ire and fury, Solomon shows us what we have to do when he
says, A privy gift, etc. Wherein we have to note, that to imprint surely
in our hearts that which he teaches, he says one thing twice. Also the
doctrine which he gives us here, is so excellent and necessary, that it
deserves well to be repeated, and also declared and expounded. Of it Jesus
Christ himself is a good expositour. If we take this present sentence in this
sense, we have together with the doctrine Mat. 6. 1.
therein, promise of everlasting life: for seeing that God refreineth his
anger, and rage, when we give to the poor for his sake, it follows well that
we shall not perish, but that by his grace and goodness we shall live
eternally. But if we understand this sentence, of brybes and gifts, that the
judges, and governors of the earth take to pervert the law and equity, it be
hooueth us to say, that Solomon accuses the Magistrates and rulers of rapine,
which Romans 13.
ought in their anger to root out the wicked. But to spare and favor them,
they let themselves be corrupted by gifts and brybes, for the which they do
wrong to the innocent: and favor the wicked as has been already spoken of
diverse times. In this sense, we have a menace of eternal death against wicked
judges that spoil and rob. For thieves and covetous persons have no part in
the kingdom of God. They are also accused that they, and those which give them
gifts and bribes, proceed against their consciences 1. Cor. 6.
knowing well that they do wickedly, when they dare not publicly before the
world, the one give, nor the other take: which thing Solomon signifies well,
speaking of privy gifts and of bosom.

15 The just man has joy to do justice: but horror is to them that work
iniquity.
We al desire to rejoice and be merry, and to be exempt from al fear and
horror. But there are very few which know how they ought to rejoice, nor in
what. For after the common trade of the world, the manner of reioicing is, to
take pleasure in laughing at vanity and folly, at filthiness and villainy,
at dissolution and naughtiness, and this is when one reioiceth at the desires
of the flesh. As when one has abundance of riches, credit, and power, or when
one comes to the end of his enterprises, and finds no resistance, but
rather each one favors him, and seeks to please him in all things. I say
namely, that this is the common trade of the world, whereof the just man is
not. And therefore he reioiceth not in this manner, nor at such things. But
he reioiceth in doing well, and helping those which have need of his aid,
defending, and delivering them which are oppressed. Such a care according to
the world, is but trouble, grief and sadness: for doing thus, one has
never good day, as worldlings say and think. But making no account of their
opinion, let us stick to that which the holy Ghost says thereof by Solomon,
saying,

The just man has joy to do justice, etc. Now seeing it appertains
principally to Kings, Princes, and governors to do justice, they are here
taught that their joy ought not to be in delights and pompes, in pleasures and
plays, as their common use is, when they have no fear of God: but to render
right to every one carefully, in defending the innocent, feeble and weak: and
delivering the^ from the violence and oppression of the wicked, and punishing
the oppressors and offenders. Otherwise they are not just, but wrongful and
wicked: which thing is not seemly for them which are placed in the seat of
God, which loves justice and righteousness, and takes pleasure therein. Also
that which causes joy to them, that do justice, is that they are certain
that God accepts their doings, and esteems of them, and they themselves do
nothing whereof their consciences reprove them. The ungodly, and wicked have
no such certainty: true it is that they strive to assure and harden themselves
in their misdeeds, and deliver themselves from al scruple, and cast away care
to rejoice in riots and insolences, excess, and dissolutions. But the word is
true without exception, which says, that there is no peace for the wicked:
which accords well with that which Isa. 48. 22.
Solomon says here, But horror is to the^ that work iniquity. And it is in
following the curses, which are threatened to the transgressors of the law.
Although then that the just in this world, which Deuteronomy. 28. 28 65. 66.
give themselves to do their duty, seem sad and sorrowful, nevertheless for
the quietness, and ease of their consciences, and for the assurance that they
have, that their works please God, they rejoice and take pleasure to employ
themselves to do good. Also although the wicked seek to lead a pleasant life
in toying and fooling, and though they seem merry, yet nevertheless they have
no true joy, for through their misdeeds their consciences accuse them, and
torment them, mawgre their hearts, with the fear of the judgments of God. And
so although they strive to show out wardly a smyling countenance, and take
their pleasure in making good cheer, eating and drinking, singing, leaping,
and daunsing, yet they cease not to have within them the worm that gnaweth,
grieueth them, and makes them sad: and thus they have no true joy. If
therefore at our need we will have joy that is durable, let us beware to do
any thing, whereof our consciences may reprove and accuse us, which thing we
shall well do if the only word of GOD be the rule of al our actions: for we
can have no peace in our consciences but by the same. And there is nothing
which can assure us that we do well, but this holy word. Wherefore it
behooves the wicked, which make no account to do good to their neighbors, but
rather afflict them, and have no right knowledge of God, to tremble, and have
no assurance. Then if they so tremble, they cannot be in lasting joy, but
must needs have Ps. 14. 4. 5.
continual horror and fear, grief and sorrow: where contrariwise the just
are invited to joy. Ps. 32. 10. 11


16 The man that wandereth out of the way of wisdom, shall remain in the
congregation of the dead.
Because the word of God is simple, and teaches us not hye and excellent
things in the opinion of the world: for this cause it is despised, and men make
no account to follow the way which it teaches: thinking it a great dishonor to
be conformable to the same: and that they should be scarce worthy to live.
Likewise men persecuted at al times, and presently do, those, that follow it
as wicked, and esteem them unworthy of life. But those which despising the
word, seek out things which are in price with the world, and follow the^, are
reputed honest men, and are placed always in the most honorable place amongst
worldlings. Which is the cause that they think themselves to be in good
estate, and of such force that they shall never perish. Wherein they disceiue
themselves, for seeing the word of God is our wisdom and understanding, and
that he which does the things appointed by the same shall live: and as we
Deuteronomy. 4. 6. Leuit. 18. 5. Pro. 16. Mat. 22. 32.
see, there is long life in her right hand: it follows, that without this
wisdom there is nothing but death. And therefore Solomon says:

The man that wandreth out of the way, etc. He speaks not of them which are
dead bodily: for if they have been faithful, they are not dead, but live.
Solomon therefore condemns al worldly wise men to death eternal: for there is
none that should be esteemed dead, but those that are in the same. In the
death of the faithful, John. 5. 24. and 11. 25. 26
there is nothing but a passage to life: seeing that our Savior so says. We
are therefore here admonished to follow rightly the only word, if we will
live, and are threatened death eternal, if we wander out of the way of the
same.

17 The man that loves banketting, is worthy of poverty: and who so
delights in wine and delicates, shall not be rich.
It is not ill done to live pleasantly: be it in taking bodily repast, or
doing any other thing (as it has bin partly spoken of elsewhere) God has not
put us in this world to give us only necessary things for ourselves, but also
delectable, and pleasant, to recreate us with sobriety and temperance, without
any disordinate desire. It is not without a very needful cause that I say with
sobriety: for it is not meet that the children of God be like unto
worldlings, which neither think their meat sweet, nor drink good, if they
laugh not with open mouth as they say, and be in company with those which do
play the unthrifts. Whiles they are busy about such delights, or rather about
such wantonness they think not that they offend a whit: and therefore they
spare nothing, but spend superfluously and with great excess. But although it
be late, yet they shall receive their hyre which they deserve: that is to say,
poverty and want. As Solomon threateneth them saying,

The man that loves, etc. This is not to say that it is ill done to rejoice in
taking ones repast naturally, nor that it is amiss to use sweet wine and
meats, which Solomon comprehends under the name of delicates: if so be it
we use them, as S. Paul teaches. For in this also consists the joy of the
Christians: and not in riot 1. Timo. 4. 3.
and great desire to fulfill the appetite of the belly, and pleasant taste of
the mouth. As is the trick of the prodigal and gluttons, to seek to satisfy
their sensuality. Also Solomon says not, The man that delights, etc. shall
have poverty: and he that drinks wine, and eats good meats shall not be
rich. But he says, He that loves, By the which word he shows that he
speaks of him, which is wholly given to banketting, drunkenness, and
gluttony, and has no delight in soberness, and temperance. Solomon
threateneth such a one of poverty, as our Savior does also, which poverty
begins after in this life, as is proved by them which Luke 6. 52.
having spent their goods prodigally, are constrained to beg their bread:
some from door to door, othersome in borrowing money never to restore it
again: the rest in seeking their living by playing the Parasites and
flatterers, which is a miserable estate, but it shall be without comparison far
more miserable after this life. As one may see in the rich man which is in
hell. Let us follow therefore sobriety, and temperance, not desiring to enriche
ourselves. For although Luke 16. 23.
that riches are good, and that it is laweful to be rich, yet nevertheless
one should not set his affection thereon: As has been showed heretofore by
the scriptures. Also being in poverty, we should not detest it, to rage and
murmr against God, nor to give ourselves license to take goods, where we
find them, but by lawful means and ways, we should seek to shun the
same, applying ourselves each one to his business wheretoo he is called.

18 The ungodly shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the wicked for the
just.
It might seem at the first show, that Solomon speaks against experience,
and against the scriptures. First of al (as it is proved in the world) one
beats the dog before the Lion: And so the wicked and ungodly pay not ransom
for the just and righteous, but rather the innocent are the ransom of the
wicked. The answer to this experience is, that it is not amiss that Solomon
speaks contrary to the same: for his intent is not to show how the wicked
are handled of the world, and in the world. For the world afflicts not his
own, to spare the innocent. Secondly, as concerning the scriptures, Solomon
speaks not against them: for although Jesus Christ be the ransom of the
wicked and ungodly (who is only just and righteous Isa. 53. 4. Mat. 20. 28. 1.
Cor. 1. 30. Gal. 3. 13. and 4. 4. 5. 1. Tim. 1. 5. 1. Ioh. 4. 9. 10.
by nature) which he has paid for us wicked and ungodly, as was figured
forth in the law by the sacrifices, and oblations, and was foretold us of
the Prophets, and also as he himself has said, and his Apostles affirmed:
Nevertheless there is no diversity between the scriptures, and that which
Solomon speaks saying, The ungodly shall be a ransom, etc. For if we take
good heed wheretoo the enterprises of the wicked tend, and how God can well
overthrow them, we shall understand how the ungodly shall be the ransom of the
just. For the intent of the wicked is to destroy and root out the just and
righteous without al remedy. But what force soever they show against them,
yea although they put them to death, yet nevertheless God will deliver them,
and put the ungodly and wicked in their place: that is to say, he does to
them, as they had thought to have done to the just: and so they are the ransom
of the righteous. For when God punishes the wicked because of the evil, which
they had practiced against the righteous, it is as though he took some ransom
of them. That which has been said in the 11. chap. verse. 8. accords well to
this. Then seeing the ungodly and wicked are called ransom, let them know,
that God will never discharge the^, no more then an earthly Prince does send
away his prisoners of account, till he have pledge, or ransom for them. Note
we moreover that although the wicked be the ransom of the just and
righteous: yet nevertheless they satisfy not for them: for Jesus Christ
only is the satisfaction for the sins of the whole world.

19 It is better to dwell in a wilderness then with a chyding and an angry
woman.
A wilderness not only is unprofitable, but also noisome and hurtful, as the
children of Israel deemed it: as may be seen by their complaints, and
murmurings against Moses. Also it is proved by this, that besides one cannot
have there what is needeful, it is also replenished with wild beasts,
venomous, and cruel. Notwithstanding Solomon prefers the habitation and
dwelling in a desert, before a chyding and an angry woman, and so declares
that it is a very pitiful case to be accompanied with such a woman. And herein
he says nothing else in substance, but that which he has said here above
verse. 9. although he use other words. For strifes or debates proceed of fury
or indignation. Wherefore one might say, that Solomon uses Repetition, to
admonish them surely that will mary, that they enquire diligently of the
party, which presents herself, what manners, and conversation she is of. For
when one is married, he cannot separate himself again, as one may retire
himself out of another country.

20 In a wise man's house there is treasure and oil: but a foolish body will
devour it.
Although it seem that Solomon praises the wiseman, because he has in his
house precious treasure and oil, by the which things are signified great
riches, delicacies, pleasures and voluptuousness: yet nevertheless, let us
not think that if we have worldly prosperity, that for the same, we are
wise, nor that it is laweful to seek to gather together great store of worldly
substance, nor to take delight in our own pleasures and doings, after the
desires of the flesh. For the most fools and naughtipackes are seen to have
plenty of riches. For the scripture (as we have partly spoken of) teaches
us, that we ought not to set our hearts upon the riches of this world, nor
that we be given to delights and pleasures, to use our flesh to his
appetite. This is not to say that it is ill done to have much goods, and enjoy
the delights and pleasures of this world, so that it be in soberness, and
temperance, and that willingly 1. Cor. 7. 29.
we make our poor neighbors partakers thereof, according to their necessity
and need, and that we be ready to yield to every one without any grudging
when they need our aid, according as S. Paul teaches us. But Solomon
instructs us, that to possess and keep the goods, and pleasures well, which
God gives us in plenty to enjoy them, and use them as we ought, and not to
loose nor scatter them abroad, it is necessary that we be endewed with
wisdom. This sense is plain unto us by the Antithesis which he makes,
saying,

But a foolish body will devour it. When he says, that the foolish know not
how to keep their goods, but disperse, and wast them, he shows well that it
is very necessary for us to be wise, if we will have our dwelling places
replenished with precious treasures and oil, and by consequent, that our
principal treasure be the fear of God. For it is also the beginning, or
principal point of wisdom, and without the same we cannot be wise, nor
consequently capable to keep the goods which God gives us, and dispose them
as we ought. And this is, why Solomon says that the foolish man which is
without fear, without reverence of God, and without wisdom shall devour the
precious treasure. Although he strive to keep that which he has, and spare
it as much as is possible, and seek to increase it: nevertheless he deuoureth
it, because the same is not sanctified to his use, and commonly goes away in
smoke sooner then he thinks it: or by that which is taken from him by war
suits in law, theftes and robberies, or that he himself is taken from his
goods. Besides this let us note first of all that Solomon calls treasure and
oil, the goods that GOD gives to the wise man: because the wise man,
esteems it so greatly that although it be little, and of small valewe, and
that he possesses it with great difficulty: nevertheless, he contenteth
himself with it, he reioiceth in it, and gives thanks to God for it, being
wary not to wast it prodigally, but to spend it soberly, and prefers it
before all the riches and pleasures of kings, knowing Psalm. 37. 16.
that better are a few things to the just man, then great abundance to the
ungodly. For this same reason Solomon attributes not to him, castles, palaces
or great houses, but only a dwelling place, wherewith he is content to dwell
under covert, and lodge there the little goods which God has sent him: not that
it is not laweful for the wise man to possess great riches, and have a
mighty house, and rejoice in the same with all modesty. But he is content
with small things, and of little estimation according to the world without
desiring more: for he imagines that the will of God is such, which he will no
ways withstand. Let us note secondly, that seeing fools and wicked persons
bear envy and hate against the wise and righteous, that they rob them, and
take of their substance, as much as they can, that it is not without cause that
Solomon complains how they devour the precious treasure and oil: as may
be understood, although we have expounded that the fool deuoureth his
substance, because he keeps it not by good and laweful means, and it is not
sanctified to his use. Note we thirdly, that the wise men are admonished to
instruct their family in all wisdom and understanding, to the end that
their children be not fools, and that they be not given to their mouth, and
belly, to consume by gluttony and drunkenness, the substance which they have
spared: but that they learn to use it with all sobriety, and temperance: and
content themselves therewith, without rauishing other men's goods to devour
them, and put them to evil.

21 Who so follows righteousness and mercy, shall find life, righteousness
and honor.
What thing soever we do, we cannot merit at gods hand, nor bind him to
yield and pay us any reward: and this is for diverse reasons. First he has
treated it us, and not we ourselves, and gives us al things abundantly for our
use: whereupon ensues that we are bound to serve him according to his will,
and that we do nothing but that we ought to do. For this cause also our
Savior Jesus Christ admonishes us, When you have done al things which are
commanded you, say, yet we are unprofitable servants, and have left undone
those things which we ought to have done. Secondly, John. 15. 1.
we cannot do well if we become not new creatures in Jesus Christ, as he
himself shows us, whereby it follows that we can merit nothing. As also
S. Paul argues of the same reason that we merit not salvation. Thirdly, we
are never so just but we sin. Ephe. 2. 8. Eccle 7. 21. 1. John. 1. 8. Mat.
6. 12. Romans 7. 14.
Also Jesus Christ shows it us well, when he will, that we ask pardon for
our trespasses. Our works also are never perfect, be they never so good. For
this cause S. Paul braggeth not of his merits but rather accuses himself.
Notwithstanding if we give ourselves to do well according to the word of God,
and if we continewe in the same, we shall not loose our labor, but shall be well
rewarded, as he promises us by his word, and we have testimony thereof in
the scriptures. And amongst the rest, when Solomon says, Who so follows
righteousness, etc. We see here that there is great reward in store for them
that continewe in doing well. It is nothing to begin, if one continewe not. And
therefore Solomon is not content to say, who so follows righteousness, etc.
wheretoo S. Paul accords and inuiteth us to this perseverance. It is not
enough therefore, that for a certain time, we give to every one that which is
his own, and that we be somewhat, and for a certain space pitiful, to them that
have need of another man's aid: but it behooves us to be at al times just and
merciful, seeing we owe continual obedience, and submission to his
commandments, admonitions and demonstratio^s, which if we perform, we are
happy and blessed, as Solomon pronounces it, promising us that we shall find
life, righteousness, and honor. Wherein he shows that we shall want
nothing, but first of al God will give us al things needful, for the body which
he comprehends under this word life. Secondly, that forgiving us our
trespasses, he will assure us of life eternal. Thirdly, that Romans 8. 30. Colos.
3. 3. 4.
having justified us, he will also glorify us.

22 A wise man scaleth the City of the mighty, and overthrows the strength
wherein they trusted.
Seeing we have neither wisdom nor foresight, nor understanding, but that
which we be taught in the word of the Lord so that we serve him in fear
and trembling, it behooves us to understand that a wiseman in this point, is he
which guides himself uprightly, according as he is taught by this word, and
neither trusts in his bodily force, nor in the fantasy of his natural sense,
neither in any industry or nimblenesse which is in him according to the man:
but only leans unto the Lord, and takes him for all his force and might, as
David teaches. Now such a man shall not be void of aid Psalm. 18. 2.
and succor, to be delivered from the hands of his enemies for the Lord will
be always ready, when he shall call upon his name. As David says, and not only
will deliver him, but also make him triumph over his foes, as David
acknowledged. Which thing he himself proved, Psalm. 18. 29.
and many others before him. As Abraham, Iosue, Sampson, Gedeon, and others
which have lived in the fear of the Lord. Solomon expresses it in one word
saying, A wiseman scaleth, etc. And this is following the promises of God, made
to them which shall walk uprightly in his law. So the wisdom which is the
fear of the Deuteronomy. 28. 17.
Lord, is of a far more excellency, then al worldly force without
comparison. It is that which we ought principally to retain in this sentence,
to the end we follow that which the Lord teaches us by his Prophet Jeremy,
and not that we enterprise Iere. 9. 22. 23
war, for to occupy another man's dominions. For although these holy
personages above named, and others have made wars, and that they have
obtained victory against their foes: Yet neuerthelesselet us not think, that
by their example it is lawful for us to invade another man's country, for first
they knew that it was Gods will they should do so. Secondly they were not led
by their own proper affections, searching their particular profit. But they
pursued the glory of God, striving to destroy his enemies, and the enemies of
his Church. Thirdly this happened them in figure, to the end we should
learn to behave ourselves valiantly against the Devil, our flesh, and sin,
which are enemies to God. We are invited to this war in many places of the
scriptures: as it has been alleged partly heretofore. Moreover let us
learn that it is folly to trust in places well fortified and defended
according to the worlds opinion, and that we ought so to walk in faith, and
in the fear of God, that we may say with David. Some put their trust in
chariots and other some in horses: But we have recorded the name Psa. 20. 8. 9.
of the Lord our God.

23 Who so keeps his mouth and his tongue, the same keeps his soul from
troubles.
Itseemeth to many that to shun afflictions, nothing else is needeful, but to
have a multitude of friends, and that they be redoupted, and mighty. And to
get such friends, one ought to be conversant with greatmen, still pleasing them
and flattering them, lying, making false reports, and backbyting, jesting, and
telling tales of laughter. Such people think themselves sure enough, and out
of danger: but they are far disceiued, as common proof shows. For one shall
see it often come to pass, that those which have such vain, and venomous
tongues, fall in great distress, according as they are also menaced in the
scriptures. These menaces are put in execution, now by judges, another while by
stryfes, seditions, and wars, and sometimes Dent. 19. 16. Psa. 5. 7. and 12.
2. and 50. 19.
by other punishments. Now to the end that we may shun such threatenings and
punishments. Solomon shows us what we have to do, when he says. Who so
keeps his mouth, etc. He teaches us to be silent and fly al vain talk that
is superfluous and hurtful, and to follow that which David says, I have bin
domb, and not said a word. And to do well this same, it behooves us to pray
like him, Psalm. 39. 2. and 141. 3.
Set a watch Lord before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips. If we do
thus, he promises us that we shall keep our souls: That is to say, our
persons from tribulation, not that we shall keep them, but that there will come
many: but that by the grace of God, we shall overcome them al, as it is
written. Such deliverance shall not be of small endurance, as David shows us.
There is another kind of Ps. 34. 19. 13
keeping ones mouth: of the which together with this same, it has been spoken
of. Chap. 13. verse, 3.

24 He is called proud, arrogant, and scornful, which in his wrath works
presumptuously.
Although sometimes men of the world attribute names unto personages such as
they deserve: yet nevertheless most usually, they attribute names and titles
which are nothing fitting for the persons: and this is either to flatter them,
or to reproach and blame them without just cause, only because they will be
welcome unto the^, unto who^ they use these honorable titles; and because they
hate them whom they reproach and blame, in giving them vile and infamous names.
And therefore the children of God shall have no regard to such names and
titles, knowing that their names are registered in heaven, and that the memory
of them is eternal before God. But the holy scripture calls no man, but as
is well agreeing either to his nature, his affections, or his manners. It
flattereth no man, although it give very honorable names and titles to the
faithful, neither blames it any body, but upon just cause. For the scripture
is divinely inspired and indicted by the holy Ghost, which is teacher of al
truth, and has lying in hate. And so, when Solomon says, That he is called,
etc: he sets here no title, which is not fitting for him that works
presumptuously: That is to say, to him that does his deeds by audacitie,
temeritie, and rashness, and persuadeth with himself, that he ought not to
fail, but to move himself furiously against them, that will any way withstand
him. Of such men the presumption is so great, that they dare strive against
God, in despiting, cursing, and renouncing him, and despising rashly al holy
religion, good admonitions and corrections. Also it is by good right, that
Solomon calls them, proud, arrogant, and scornful, as in truth they are,
when they are transported with so furious a presumption. Now seeing such names
and titles displease us, let us have regard to use ourselves uprightly, in all
modesty, fear, and humility, and the Lord will grant us his grace. But if
we bear the name of proud, arrogant, and scornful, he will resist us
stoutly, and destroy us, according to the threatenings which have been
alleged heretofore. We may well be obstinate and hardened in our opinion,
despisers of God, and of his word, reuengeful, wrongdoers, and outrageous, but
this can not let God to do his work, and use and execute his just vengeance
against us, for his highness which is to us incomprehe^sible, is above al
worldly highness. As he has well showed at the flood, upon Sodom and
Gomorrha, on Pharao, and the people of Egypt, and upon many others.

25 The desire of the slouthful shall kill him: for his hands have refused to
labor.
Solomon bare great hate both to sloth, and the slouthful, as he shows well,
when so often he threatens the slothful with poverty and need, with
destruction and death. And by such repetitions he teaches us to fly sloth.
And again, presently, when he says, The desire, etc. Wherein also he
shows us, who are the slouthful, that is to wit, curious of the goods and
substance of an other man. For by what right soever they possess goods, seeing
they employe not themselves to labor, they usurp and eat the bread of them
which follow the vocation whereto God has called them, for they are the
servants and children of the Lord, whose the earth and the heaven is, and al
therein contained, and consequently, they only are inheritours of the world.
And so the slouthful are covetous, thieves, and robbers, whereupon ensues,
that they are worthy of death. Also Solomon threateneth the sluggish
therewith, when he says, His desire shall kill him. And when he so says, he
threatens him secretly of eternal death. For if God deem not the slouthful
man worthy of this present life, it follows, that he will not give him life
eternal. It is therefore evil spoken, when one says of a sluggard, that he is
a good man, except he take good for unprofitable: for we ought to attribute
no goodness to him, that God condemns.

26 He coueteth greedily all the day long, but the righteous gives, and spares
not.
Since he puts the righteous, as contrary to the slouthful, he shows well
that the slouthful is wicked, and that he deserves well to have poverty,
destruction, and decaie. And when he puts, gives, and spares not, against
coueteth greedily: he shows the insatiable avarice, and great cruelty of
the slouthful. He shows that the slouthful has no care of himself, and
that he has no compassion, nor pity of the poor. And this is for no small
while, but he perseuereth in his avarice and cruelty. For, as Solomon says,
He coueteth greedily all the day long. And contrary, The righteous never
cease to do good, as Solomon declares, when he says, And he spares not.
Wherein we see, that we cannot claim the title of being righteous, if we
persevere not to use charity, and do the works of mercy. But although it be
said, that the sluggarde has a care of himself, nevertheless the care that
he has, is not properly care, but only a greediness more then bestial. For
if he had a due care of himself, he would study to work the health of
his soul, with fear and trembling. And in this manner, he would save both
body and soul, whereas now they go to wrack and ruin. For judgment shall be
done without mercy, to him that has used no mercy. Contrariwise, the
righteous man provides Deu. 12. 2. 3. Mat. 13. 41. and 25. 31. Ioh. 5. 28. 29.
for his soul and body by giving, and perseuering to do well: Seeing that,
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy, yea, perpetual mercy
both in body and soul.

27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination, by how much more they bring
it with an evil will.
The wicked work in diverse manners both toward God and man: for some proceed
with good intention, and think to do God good service, and ought to be
praised of their neighbors for their deeds. As Saint Paul did before he was
called to the knowledge of the Gospel. As also many in the Papacy, which
think to do God good service in murdering his servants and children, as
Jesus Christ has foretold his Apostles. But what good meaning soever John.
16. 2.
they have, their works are wicked and abominable, and principally before
God. As Solomon has said. He says also, anewe. The sacrifice of the wicked,
is abomination. These here are hypocrites Prou. 15. 8.
having some outward show of holiness, and religion, and within there is
nothing but malice, which makes them use cruelty, and inhumanitie. Although
they themselves think not so, or at leastwise seek to persuade themselves,
that there is no harm neither in their thoughts and deliberations, nor in
their enterprises and proceedinges. See here what they be that proceed with
good intention, and in what reputation their works are with God. Wherevpo^
ensues that they may well travel, before they obtain that which they think they
deserve: for seeing their works are abominable before God, it is meet that
they go to perdition and decaie. There are an other sort of wicked men which
are more shameless. For although they know well, that they neither are nor will
be of any value, and that they do wrongfully against their consciences, being
wholly infected with wicked thoughts, minds and wills, yet nevertheless,
they will have reputation of religion and holiness by some works which have
fair appearance outwardly. But (as they well deserve) both they and their works
are more abominable then the others which proceed with good intention, and
their hypocrisy is more wicked. As Solomon signifies, saying. By how much
more they bring it with an evil will. In the number of these here, one must put
al them that lead a life quite contrary to the law of God, and in the mean
while, seek to blind the eyes of others by ceremonies: which should be good,
if they had upright hearts, and that in the rest, their conversation were
unworthy of blame.

28 The false witness shall perish: but a man that hears, shall still speak.
Although the false witnesses know that they lie, and that their consciences
reprove, and reprehend them, and they can soon condemn those that should
bear false witness against them, and judge them worthy of death, not only
temporal, but also eternal: yet nevertheless they seek to lie assuredly,
without remorce of conscience, insomuche as they think that God neither
hears, nor sees them: and they ween that their falsehood and lying shall not
come to the knowledge of any Judge which shall have power to punish them. For
this cause, the Scripture threateneth them often, as we have seen heretofore,
as well in the law, and Prophets, as in this present book. And again, we
see this present threatening, which is conformable to them that are gone
astraie. Such menaces are made, and redoubled for diverse reasons. First to
terrify, and afraie al liars and false witnessers, and those which take the
name of God in vain: being such as swear superfluous oaths, and are
blasphemers, cursers, and renouncers of God, and that being so often menaced,
they are made more faulty. Secondly, that we be well admonished to take heed
of ourselves, to the end we become careful to follow truth, and to fly from
lying. Thirdly, to the end that Justices, and Magistrates be diligent to
inquire out the truth, and not to let slip the false witnessers unpunished, as
it is expressly commanded them in the law, and has been alleged heretofore.
But because contrary to the false witness, he puts a man that hears: and
against perish, places speaking still: we have to note first of al, that the
liar and false witnesser has neither law nor Faith, and consequently, no
religion: for, to yield obedience to the law, one ought to hear, and to
submit himself to Faith, he ought also to speak. And in these two points
consists the Christian Deu. 4. 1. and 6. 4. Esai. 53. 1. Romans 10. 14. Mat. 1.
15.
religion, besides the which there is no religion. We may know it by the
beginning of the preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ. Then seeing truth
consists in the word of God, which is declared by the law and Gospel, it
must needs be, that he which will not hear the word, must be void of
truth, and replenished with lying, and falsehood, and that he be without
religion, seeing also, he is without God, and forces not if God, which cannot
consist without his truth, be deprived of his divinity, and be no more God.
For in as much as in him is, he makes him author of untruth: and seeing we
utterly abhor the false witnesser, (yea as it were by nature) it behooves us
to hear, and yield ourselves attentive to the word of truth, and then we
shall not be of the number of false witnesses, which perish: but we shall be in
safety in the Church of our Lord God, which is kept by the veritable.

Secondly, after liars and false witnesses have once uttered Psalm. 15. 1.
their lies quite against their consciences, to dishonor God, and blame and
undo their neighbors, finally, they shall have their mouths closed, and be
utterly confused, seeing themselves rejected of God, and be in damnation and
death eternal, and that the evil which they thought to do by their lying, be
fallen upon them for ever, without any remedy. And also where they see that
they, whom they would have destroyed, undone, and made dombe by their
falshoode, shall have their mouths open, and shall speak without cease, and not
perish: As Abel the righteous, although he was slain by Caine, yet
notwithstanding, his blood cried, and Genesis 4. 10. Hebr. 11. 4
being dead, yet he spoke: for God had care over him, as he will have also
over al them which are attentive to his word, taking vengeance in his ire and
fury upon those, which have vexed them, and placing them in the celestial
glory, to have joy, honor, and sauegarde, for ever. See how Solomon
means, that those which hear the word of God, shall speak still.

29 An ungodly man hardens his face, but the just reformeth his own way.
Although the wicked know well, that they do nothing that is good, and that
naturally without the scriptures they see that they are guilty, and
principally before God, as they give and have certain argument thereof, when
they are afraid of the judgments of God, because their consciences reprove
them of their misdeeds: Yet nevertheless as Solomon says,

They harden their faces, That is to say, they have a fierce, and arrogant
behavior, both in words and gesture, to give to understand, that they neither
fear nor doubt any thing: and the more wicked they are, the more they strive
to assure themselves, and set a good face on the matter, saying in their
hearts, we have made aliance with death, and know what hell is. And in this
opinion, they make no account to convert themselves to any goodness, be Esai.
28. 15
it to think, say, or do. Solomon shows that he means this by hardening
the face. When he says, But the just reformeth his own way. For against
hardening the face, he puts reformeth his ways, which is no other thing,
but the fear and reverence, which one has to the word, to study how to
frame his Phil. 2. 3.
mind and thought, his words, and works to the will of God, for to serve him
duly, and work his souls health with fear and trembling. Psa. 5. 9. and 25.
4. 5. 8. 9. and 119. 5. and 143. 10.
Which thing of ourselves we do not: for it is God which works in us both
the will and the effect according as it pleases him. Wherefore we have to pray
with David, Lord lead me in thy righteousness, etc.

30 There is neither wisdom nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.
We ought to be resolved of this, that God aloweth that which is not against
him, loves it, and maintains it, and makes it serve to his honor, and to
the edification of his, according as he sees expedient. But he reprooueth
the wise and sage men of the world. And their wisdom, understanding and
counsel, cursing them, overthrowing them, and destroying them, as the
scriptures witness. Whereby it may seem at first view, that Solomon saying,
There Job. 5. 12. 13. Esa. 5. 21. and 29. 14. 15. and 44. 25. and 8. 9. 10.
Psalm. 33. 10.
is neither wisdom, etc. said against the scriptures. And therefore when he
says, Against the Lord: That is to say, which can let or stay the counsel of
the Lord, overthrow his ordinances, and break of his attemptes, For although
the wise men of the world study to resist him, yet nevertheless his will must
needs be accomplished, yea at his only word without any other ado.
Wherefore when we have God on our side, although we be but a little handful, and
folks Psalm. 33. 8. 9. Esa. 46. 9. 10
without force, and worldly wisdom, yet we ought not to be afraid, though
all the world, and all the power of hell were against us, but in all safety to
say with David, I have laid me down and slept, and have risen up again for
the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of ten thousand of men, etc.
We ought to confess Psalm. 3. 5.
that which Job says, Yea with him is wisdom and force, counsel and
understanding.

31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but the Lord gives
victory.
Men make many preparations for the wars, to the end, that by the same, they
may compass their enemies, and obtain victory against them, or that if it
happen that they be too weak, they may save themselves. And therefore there is
no preparation wherein man more trusts, then in the Horse (for a man being
mounted upon a light and valiant Horse (as him seems) he may pursue his
enemies with more speed, and overtake them sooner then if he were on foot:
and if he have need to fly, he shall save himself the better: for this
cause, the Scripture making mention of war, of assault, or of fight, speaks
rather of Horses, Deuteronomy. 17. 16. Psalm. 20. 8. 9. and 33. 16. 17. and 76. 6. 7.
Esai. 31. 1.
then of any other Munitions, blaming and accusing them that trust therein.
Wherefore, to the end we be not blamed, and accused of vain confidence, let
us put all the hope of our health, victory, and deliverance in the Lord: as
the Scriptures teach us. And also Solomon now admonishes us, when he says,

The Horse is prepared for the day of battle. He forbid death not that one
should defend himself against his enemies, neither to resist them manfully,
and to kill and slaie them, if he cannot otherwise discomfite them: but he will
that one have regard to the Lord. And that we know that al our preparations,
and Munitions Psalm. 121. 1 and 123. 1. Psalm. 124. 1. and 127. 1. and 144. 1.
Psalm. 145. 18 and 147. 10. Exodus 14. 24. and 15. 1. Genesis 15. 14
are but vanity, and serve to no purpose, if God himself labor not,
defending, delivering and saving us from the violence of our foes. And if we
will feel this aid, let us not fear men, be they never so well appointed, but
let us fear the Lord, and call upon his name. And as he can well save and
keep the faithful, which put their trust in him: so can he easily destroy
their foes, as the Scripture witnesses, whereof the people give thanks. And
thus following the promise made to Abraham: and also following other promises,
he has often saved his people, and destroyed their enemies.

The xxii. Chapter.
A Good name is more too be desired then great riches: and a loving favor
more then silver and gold.
EVery one of us is naturally inclined to desire, and choose that which seems
to him good and profitable. And there are some, which are so addicted to their
peculiar profit to enriche themselves, that they forget al honesty, and al
humanity, and care not in what credit and reputation they be, nor if they be
esteemed or no, if they can compass to make themselves tiche and mighty, for
they think still, that if they come once to such estate, they shall then have
need of no body, but many shall have need of them, and favor and flatter
them, showing themselves to be at their commandment: And it is the manner of
worldlinges, and carnal men to make account of the rich, and call them honest
men, and have them in admiration, there are some that although they desire to
be in reputation, yet they think that nothing is to be accounted of but of
riches: And therefore they set al their whole mind and affection thereon, to
the end to be advanced and praised. Al such men are far abused: for it is
not them that we Genesis 6. 4.
praise, but their riches, as they should soon know, if they had eyes: for it
is manifest, that if the rich man once become poor, he is despised of them,
yea that showed themselves in his prosperity to be his greatest friends. And
therefore they are worthy to be reprehended, and so Solomon does reprehende
them saying,

A good name is more to be desired: then great riches. And he shows us that
which we ought to desire and choose above al things in this world, to wit, a
good name, and favor not as the Giants did in the time Noe: nor as iesters
do, which by lies, flatteries, fables, and tales, do purchase favor: but by
discrete manners, and honest conversation, by justice and equity, humility
and temperance, and by other fruits of a righteous heart and sound conscience,
which makes us to get credit, and be acceptable and worthy of praise both
before God and our neighbors. This ought more to be desired of us then all
other things, which one can wish for in this world, be they never so precious,
for they are frail and transitory subject to vanity and corruption, but a
good name and a loving favor remain for ever. Which thing Solomon shows well,
when he prefers it before riches, gold, and silver. Saint Paul also
shows it well, when he wills us to set our minds on things of a good report
and praise, and when he promises that in thus doing, the God of peace will be
with us. But although we ought Phil. 4. 8. 9.
greatly to set by a good name and loving favor, yet nevertheless we ought
greatly to take heed of being ambitious, to covet that others should praise
us, and have us in estimation for our good deeds, but we ought to search the
glory of God, and the edification of our neighbors, without thinking on our
own good name and reputation: for it is not for us to exalt ourselves: we
must tarry til God do it, yea he alone which has power to exalt and humble,
whom he pleases. And if we walk in integrity and uprightness of
conscience, although we be a reproach to al men: yet he will make our
innocence to shine forth, where he sees good, as he has done with Joseph,
David, Daniel, and others. And also as it is seen, when the wicked are
constrained to speak well of them, whom they persecute unjustly.

2 The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of themal.
In this world there are diverse states, as is seen: there are poor men, rich
men, weak and strong, abiects, and advanced. And yet nevertheless this
diversity, God has not sticked to put them altogether, and to bind them one
to another, Solomon signifies this same, when he says,

The rich and poor meet together. But in this meeting there is despite, and
envy, for the rich disdain, and despise the poor, and the poor use envy
against the rich and mighty. In which doing, they dishonor God, which has
put each one in that estate that has pleased him, Solomon shows it well,
saying,

The Lord is the maker of them all. And this is following that which Anna
says, The Lord makes poor and rich, wherein we ought to learn that every
one of us should content himself with his estate, and acknowledge that it is
good, to receive at the hands of the Lord, with thanks giving, all that which
pleases him to send, knowing that he places us, where he thinks most
profit for us: and though we will not acknowledge it, yet it ceasseth not to
be so. Secondly upon this word Meet, let rich Sam. 27. 8.
men learn not to disdain the familiar conversation of the poor, and that it
is no hurt for them to make the^ partakers of the goods which God has put into
their hands: for seeing God is the maker of the rich man, it follows, that
those riches, are committed to him, to do according to the mind of his maker.
Otherwise he should not be a wise, and faithful servant. Thirdly, Let not the
rich man vaunt of his riches, seeing he has them not of himself, and they
are his but for a little season. Also let not the poor man be sad, and vexed
at his poverty: seeing that God who has placed him in that estate, knows
well what is needful for every one, seeing also that poverty is of small
endurance, and that after the same, we shall attain to riches inestimable.

3 A wise man sees the plague, and hydeth himself: But the foolish go on
still, and are punished.
We ought to hold for certentie, that God, who is not unconstant, disposes,
governs, and guides all the world, according as he has foreseen and
ordained before the foundation of the world, and there is none that can let
him, to accomplish his determinations and enterprises, and to fulfill al his
whole will and pleasure. mean while this is not to say, that we ought not to
take diligent heed to that which we have to do, and eschew, according to
the wisdom and skill that God has given us, and that we spare not the
strength and diligence, that he has endued us with, for he will not have the
gifts which he has given us to be idle, and unprofitable. Also as his
providence is no let that we will not: so our will overthrows not the divine
providence, seeing that if we have any will or understanding, it proceeds
from this providence. Also although it behooves that that which God has
ordained eternally, come to pass of necessity, and that none can let it, yet
nevertheless, God by his word desisteth not to teach us that which we have
to do, or eschew, to admonish us, reprehende us, threaten us, and condemn
us, as one may see in the holy scriptures, wherefore we shall do no injury to
the divine providence, when we shall search diligently the scriptures, and shall
carefully hear the word, which is faithfully expounded unto us, and that by
this means they shall learn a good wisdom to the end to govern ourselves
warily that we be not surprised with dangers on the soden, but that we may
shun the damage which may happen to us, that as to sottes, foolish, and ill
advised, we make no account to keep ourselves, and to draw back from the
danger which presents it self to assail us, and intrappe us. Solomon
praises such wisdom, when he says,

A wise man sees, etc. Here he speaks not of carnal and worldly wise men:
for they cannot hide themselves so well, but they will be surprised: but he
speaks of them of whom it has been spoken off heretofore. They that are
such, by the word of the Lord, Job. 5. 12. 13. Pro. 13. 16. and 14. 8. 15. 16.
do foresee the evil which is to come to the wicked, which set not their
minds upon this word. They know also that men practice many evils, to them
which seek to live in holiness, innocence, and righteousness. And so they see
the evil, and hide themselves, trusting in the shadow of the wings of the Lord,
and saying, Keep me as the apple of thy eye, and hyde me in the shadow of thy
wings. And as Psalm. 17. 8. 9. and 57. 2.
they demand this same, putting their trust in the goodness, and mercy of God,
so they obtain it. For although by persecutions, and other adversities they
dye, and fall away according to outward appearance, yet notwithstanding they are
surely hid, under the defense, protection, and safeguard of the Lord. But they
which have not the foresight, nor make no account to guide themselves according
to the word: although for a certain season (as for the space of this life)
they seem to be out of al danger, yet nevertheless experience teaches
often, that GOD spares them not, and when the plagues and dangers of this
world will not touch them, yet they shall not shun the torments that are
eternal: Solomon signifies thus, saying,

But the foolish go on still, and are punished. By this word go on, or
pass forward, is showed assurance and inconsideration or rather the over
boldness and obstinacy, which the ill advised use, who make no account to
learn by the word to fly from the plague, but tarry they never so long, yet
they are punished, but principally after this life, where is no redemption. The
foolish therefore, whereof Solomon speaks, be scorners and contemners of GOD
and of his word, which only gives understanding and foresight. The foolish
are also those, which the world reputeth for most hardy and valiant, and those
that think themselves so. In number with such men one may put Pharao, Saul,
Sennacherib, Nabuchodonozer, Judas, and others, which suffered themselves to be
carried away by the malice of their hearts, and are hardy to do and say ill
without sparing, but when sometimes fearing men more then God, they make show
to withdraw themselves and abstain from doing evil, to the end to shun
temporal torments: But they cannot flee so long, but at the last they will be
punished with everlasting torments.

4 The reward of humility, and the fear of the Lord are riches, honor, and
life.
It is not enough to employ ones self about something, to be recompensed: for
many meddle with matters wherein they have no knowledge but to mar al, and so
they merit sooner to be punished, then to have reward. But in doing any
thing, one ought to know, how and by what means he should proceed not to
loose his labor. Many, to get goods and honor, and to make themselves as it
were immortal, think that there is no way so good, as to make themselves of
value by arrogancy, and pride, by boldenes, temeritie and rashness, without
having regard to the reverence which we owe al to God and to his word: but
after having taken great pains in this sort, they find at last, that not only
they have beaten the wind, and profited nothing, but also that they are
^uynated, and come to decay. Some feel it in this life, and all the wicked shall
feel it in death eternal: for the sentence must needs be true, that
Whosoever exalts himself shall be brought low, and contrariwise he that
humbles himself shall be exalted, as it has been Pro. 16. 18. 19. and 18. 12
treated heretofore. The humble therefore loses not his labor: but is well
rewarded, as Solomon declares it plainly, when he says,

The reward of humility and fear of the Lord, etc. Whereby he shows that the
ways to advance ones self, are humility, and fear: he puts not
humility alone: for many have been humble, that is to say, vile, abject, out
castes, and afflicted, which have not obtained this hyre: but have been still
miserable, and finally have perished for ever, but he joins with humility,
The fear of the Lord, for if we be afraid indeed to offend God, desiring to
yield him obedience according to his word, although to the outward appearance
we be the most vile and abject, the most poor and miserable of all the world,
yet the Lord can well pay us in opportunity and when he shall see good, the
hyre whereof mention is made, seeing he cannot lie, but his truth is infallible.

Now he has promised to them that fear him, that they shall lack no good
thing, and he has promised great riches to their offspring. David praises the
Lord for the gifts that he gives to them which fear him, and promises
them that fear him to fulfill Psa. 34. 9. 10 11. and 25. 12. 13. 14. and 31.
20. 21. and 145. 18. 19. 20.
their desires. Solomon according with the foresaid scriptures, says that the
humble which fear the Lord shall have riches, honor, and life, they shall have
riches, for they shall have suffisance and contentment. They shall have honor,
for the Lord shall deliver them from al rebukes, and shall place them in honors
from this time present, if it be needeful, as David, Joseph, Moses and others.
But it shall be principally in eternal and heavenly honors. They shall have life,
for he will deliver them the hands of those which persecute and oppress them,
and shall make them live, yea in this world, as he has made the aforesaid:
and as he makes presently the poor faithful flock, which he has rent out
of the hands of their persecutors: but the principal life shall be in that
glorious immortality.

5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: but who so keeps his
soul, will flee far from them.
He compares the froward to the hunter, which strives to take and kill wild
beasts, for as the hunter has no pity of the beasts, neither spares he
them, but sets snares in bushes and thorns, wherethrough he chaseth the
beasts, so to take them and use them at his pleasure: Even so the froward
has no pity of the innocent, and to destroy him he has secret fetches,
which are without al humanity, and cruel: as Solomon signifies by Thorns and
snares: for the thorns prick, and the snares that are pitched in the same,
do stay the pray, til the hunter come to work his will and pleasure thereon.

Now as concerning the froward which one may compare to hunbters, there are
some which set snares, and hunt after both goods and odies to rob, and murder
them, as thieves, covetous men, and usurers do, which are replenished with
great cruelty, wherewith being led and tra^sported, they pitch, the snares of
violence and oppression, of process, striffes, and debates, of swords and
weapons, of gifts to corrupt the Judges, or other subtle ways to do injury,
and outrage to the innocent: such froward persons are very wicked, and
hurtful, and noisome to their neighbors: as experience shows but too much.
But thinking to advance themselves and make great profit by this means, they
choke themselves up with the thorns of riches, and care and the delights and
pleasures of this world. And by and by they fall into temptation. Yet
notwithstanding they are not most hurtful, for they spoil but temporal goods,
and kill but the bodies Also it is not of them that Solomon speaks here now,
as he himself shows, when he says, Who so keeps his soul, etc. for to
keep ones soul is not to flee far from them, and their ambushes, to shun
the damage that they may do to the goods and body, be it not that we take
the soul for this present life, and the commodities thereof. They that flee
far from the ambushes of such froward persons, keep their souls, that is to
say, they live out of al danger, and enjoy the commodities that are temporal
and corporal. But Solomon has regard to another life and other commodities,
to wit, spiritual and eternal. Wherefore let us note that there are other
froward persons, far worse then the above named, for they set snares to
destroy the souls, and send them to hell and fire unquenchable. These are the
infidels, superstitious, idolaters, friars, and monks, which persecute the
members of Jesus Christ because of his name. The false Prophets also, and
teachers of lies, and heretics which pitch the snares of false doctrine, and
wicked opinions. And because they are perilous, the scripture uses great
complaints against them, and chiefly in the Psalms. Psalm. 10. 9 and 35. 7. 8.
Romans 16. 17.
If we will truly keep our souls unto life everlasting, it is best we be
careful to flee from their snares, as the Apostle Saint Paul teaches us.

6 Teach a child in the entrance of his way: for he shall not leave it when
he is old.
Many think that it is not need eful to busy themselves about little
children, to teach and instruct them: Some because they think that one
should let them play at their pleasure, and not break their brains with
melancholy about knowledge and instruction. Others, because that children are
light and wanton, and not yet capable to retain that which is taught them,
because they set not their minds thereon, but rather on vanity and folly: but
when Jesus Christ received the children that were brought him, he shows
well, that we ought to be careful to instruct them: and also when he accepted
the praise of children. Saint Paul likewise shows it well, when he praises
Timothy in that he was instructed from Mat. 19. 13. and 21. 16. 2. Tim. 3. 15
his infancy. It is meet therefore to instruct children in the fear of the
Lord by his word, and not to suffer the^ to live loosely in lasciviousness, to
the end that when they become old, they may be so accustomed to hold the
way of holiness, innocence, justice, and true religion, that they can never
withdraw themselves therefro again, but have al their delight and pleasure
therein, Solomon teaches us to do so when he says,

Teach a child, etc. when he says, teach, or give the first principles of
science, and instruction, he shows that if one have no care to conduct, (as
it were by the hand) children in the right way and knowledge and truth, it
must needs be that they will remain ignorant, for they can of themselves
learn nothing of that which they ought to understand, but rather give
themselves too vanity and folly, yea to malice and wickedness, as experience
shows it. And when he says, the child, and not the man, he shows in what
age one is capable to receive instruction, and that we must not tarry til the
person be come to great age, and almost past teaching, for we see that it is
almost impossible to put any good thing into the head of such a one, but as he
has lived in ignorance, so he will continue therein. It is therefore very
necessary to learn betimes, and not to tarry til one have an hard
understanding. Moreover, when he says, In the entrance, or in the mouth of his
ways: Let us understand, that as a little child cannot of himself take his
bodily food, if it be not put in his mouth: so he cannot guide and govern
his soul, if that from the beginning he be not well entered, and that one
fail not to set him right in the mouth of his way, which is called his, not
because he naturally walks therein, or that he chooses it of himself: but
because it is meet that for the health of his soul, and to do his duty
toward God and men, he follow such a way as the Lord has ordained him by
his word. If children from the beginning be so well entered, they will persevere
in goodness, as long as they live in this world, as Solomon signifies well,
saying, For he shall not leave it, when he is old: yea if they have well
received the instruction, so that they have well printed it in their minds and
hearts: for as one cannot be nourished by putting meat in the mouth, if he
do not chawe it, swallowe it, and digest it: So what pain soever one take
with children to instruct them, yet he shall not profit with them, if God give
them not the grace to take pleasure therein. If therefore one see many of
those, with whom one has taken pain in their youth, to be loose and
dissolute in their age, it is a sign that they have not taken pleasure indeed
to have one teach them, and that they are unthankful for that goodness which one
would have done to them, as there are many of that sort, specially in the place
where the Gospel is most preached. wherefore if fathers and mothers desire that
their children become honest, let them begin betimes to instruct them: also
let rulers and magistrates bridle youth, and ministers be careful to
administer the word faithfully, with such facility, that it be as milk too
little ones to nourishe and increase them.

7 The rich bears rule over the poor, and he that boroweth, shall be servant
to the lender.
The man that thinks himself rich when he has great abundance of temporal
goods, not only despises and disdaineth the poor, but also will make them
subject unto him: and to do this same, he uses toward them oppression and
violence, as one sees Iam. 2. 6.
by experience, and Saint James shows it. And this is that which Solomon
signifies, saying, The rich man, etc. Although it be very needeful that they
to whom God has given rule and signiorie be rich to sustain the charges:
yet nevertheless Solomon sticks not to blame the rich, because of their
boldness and arrogancy, their oppression and violence which they use toward
them which cannot defend themselves, or which are bound to them after the
flesh, because of the succor which they show them with their riches, in
helping their necessity: when it appertains only Iam. 1. 5.
to Kings, Princes, and Governors of the earth to rule, we ought to
understand that Solomon blames the rich men, saying, That they bear rule over
the poor. For seeing they usurp that which appertains not to them, they
exercise tyranny for the which they ought to loooke for an horrible punishment.

Now as by the abundance of worldly goods, one is puffed up, and exalted above
the needy: so also necessity constrains folks, to abase themselves, and to
be humble and meek before them, whom they have to do with to be aided, and
succored, as ensues, And he that boroweth, shall be servant, etc. as he has
rebuked the hautinesse and tyranny of the rich, so he reprehendeth the poor
worldlings (which are afraid least the earth fail them) of pulsillanimitie
and flattery. And by good right, for although we ought to serve one an other
by charity, yet nevertheless we ought to take heed of being servants of
men, otherwise we cannot be the servants of Christ. And therefore Saint
Paul bids servants, that in obeying their masters, they be also servants
of Christ. Moreover, 1. Cor. 7. 23. Gal. 1. 10.
note we, that when poverty constrains men to serve, and it is not that
which we desire, but we crave to be at liberty, that Solomon warns us to
work diligently, to the end, that we may have to sustain ourselves with
our family, and that we be not forced to abase ourselves to borrowe more
then God has appointed us by his word.

8 He that sows wickedness, shall reap affliction, and the rod of his
anger shall fail.
The holy Ghost in the sacred scriptures, compares often our works to seed,
be they good or bad, as also there is good and bad seed. Such a comparison is
made very fitly: for like as the labourer, which medleth with the earth,
reapeth willingly such seed as Job. 4. 8. 9. 1. Cor. 9. 11. and 2. Cor. 9. 6.
10. Gal. 6. 7. Ia. 3. 18. Iam. 5. 7. 8.
he has cast into the earth, if the earth be not barren and unfruitful, and
unable to restore the like again: even so it happens to man, according as he
practices and enterpriseth. And as the labourer which has sown good seed,
tarieth patiently, til the time of harvest come, so they which do well, ought
patiently to attend their reward. And as the evil sower cannot look for any
thing but that which is of no value: so although the wicked tarry and attend,
yet they shall perceive that their seed is nothing worth. If they have used
wickedness, either against God, or the holy Ghost, by idolatries and
blasphemy, by despising al religion, and scorning the word, or have vexed and
grieved their neighbors, to oppress and overthrow them, by backbiting and
false reports, by lawing, or subtle means, by injuries, and wrongs, by
weapons, and other violencies. If they sow (I say) such wickedness, although
the punishment be slack, according to man's opinion, yet they shall receive
Psalm. 7. 15.
their reward, as David shows it plainly by other similitudes then of the
sower. Solomon to signify such recompense uses a similitude of the sower,
saying, He that sows wickedness, etc. He threateneth here principally the
wicked, which practice against their neighbors, fraud and deceit, rauine,
and extortion, inhumanitie, cruelty and tyranny, and seek by all means they
can, to destroy and overthrow them, in great anger and fury. He signifies it,
when he says,

And the rod of his anger, etc. By the rod of anger he shows that the wicked
are much enflamed to persecute the innocent by malice, as David does also: And
as has been, and is seen yet by experience. And by and by he shows that
the wicked which so we Psalm. 10. 2.
wickedness, are much hardened and obstinate in the same, when they cease not
to persecute the innocent with rage, until such time as they reap the reward
of their pursuit: to wit, affliction, which makes an end of their wickedness,
and causes the rod of their anger to fail. As may be seen (amongst others)
in Pharao and Saul. Moreover he gives here consolation to them, which
endure the malice of the wicked: for although according to man's judgment it
seems that they will never cease to sow wickedness, in afflicting and
persecuting the innocent, because at al times one has seen, and yet sees,
that the wicked, which are an infinite number in respect of the good and just,
have so done, and do yet still. Nevertheless it will come to pass that their
wickedness shall take end. As David prays. And that the good and righteous
shall be in safety Psalm. 7. 10.
and rest.

9 The good eye shall be blessed, for he has given of his bread to the poor.
We covet greatly that al things be well with us, that we live in peace and
quietness, and that al things which belong to us go well, and that having
prosperity, we increase and grow up therein, so that nothing fail us. The
carnal worldlings which are covetous, to obtain such desires, are very
careful, and greedy to get a great heap of riches and to keep it with all
diligence: and regard not willingly them whom they think to be needy, and
to have occasion to use their aid. For they think verily, that their riches
will diminish, if they should aid therewith the poor, and needy, and cannot
see that the others do their business: so envious, and afraid they are,
never to have enough.

Now that which they fear, shall happen to them, although for a season it seem
that they flourish and prospet: for as with an evil eye, full of hate, envy,
inhumanitie, and cruelty, without al pity, and compassion they behold the
poor, disdain them, and draw back as much as they can from them: so God will
behold them with the like eye, making the^ most miserable, which if it be not
in this world, yet at the last they shall perceive it in hell. But as we would
gladly that in our indigence, whatsoever it be, our neighbors should behold
us with a good eye, and should use liberality toward us. So it behooves us
to behold with a good eye our neighbors, which have need of our aid in
helping their necessity according to our ability. Thus doing we shall have
want of nothing: but shall abound in all wealth, as Solomon promises saying,

The good eye, etc. Saint Paul is conformable in this promise. This is not to
say that our eye is so good, or that we may give 2. Cor. 9. ^
so much of our goods that by our liberality we may merit benediction: for
we cannot obtain it but by grace, and because the Lord has made us a
promise thereof, whereto we wholly trust. Also we are never so liberal, that
we give any thing which is properly our own, seeing that the earth, and all that is contained therein is the Lords, etc. And that which we give, is not
any thing, whereof we ought to make great account, as Solomon shows well, Psalm.
24. 1.
when he calls it bread, which is the most common meat and of least price,
that we ordinarily use. Nevertheless, when God which cannot be bound to any
body, blesses him which with a good and liberal eye beholding the needy,
gives him bread, that is to say, of his goods, which serve to sustain this
life, it is most meet that he which receives the good turn, be not
unthankful toward the Lords steward, but that he honor him, as the organ
and Instrument, by the which God has given him of his goods at his need. But
it is not meet, that he which gives, should desire any regratulation, for he
ought to content himself with the blessing of Pro. 10. 22.
the Lord, the which only makes a man rich. Also they to whom one gives
any thing for mere pity, if the alms be not great, yet they ought not to
despise it, but to receive it with thanks giving.

Moreover, note we, that if we ought with a good eye to distribute our goods
to the needy, that it behooves us not to be angry if another do the like:
to the end we resemble not him to whom it is said, My freende, I do thee
no wrong, etc. Is it not Mat. 20. 13.
lawful for me to do what I will with mine own goods?

10 Drive out the scornful man, and debate shall go out with him, yea
variance and slander shall cease.
It is an ordinary thing (as may be seen) that the courts and houses of
kings and princes are full of hate, envy, pride, and ambition. There is
almost none which is content with his calling, but every one aspireth to a more
higher estate. Some to honor and glory, some to riches, credit, and power,
and strive to exalte themselves one above another. Whereof proceed debates,
dissension, quarrelling, words of defame and slander, which are stirred up,
and maintained by the scorneful who have no reverence of God nor of his word,
and bear no love nor duty to their kings and princes nor to the prosperity
of their realms, and by decreed malice, seek to set al in trouble and
confusion, and delight to work oppression, and violence to their neighbors,
and to dishonor and diffame them, and care not for any thing but for their
own particular profit, and to come to the end of their enterprises by the
harms of others, yea presuming to incite, and provoke princes one against an
other. And so they fill the world with strife, quarrels, and slander: whereupon
ensues the destruction of many people, and the ruin likewise of kings and
princes. Wherefore in so much as kings and princes love to maintain
themselves, and their subjects, and too flourish and prosper, let them be
careful to root out such scorners as Solomon counsels them, saying,

Drive out the scorneful man, etc, And to do this well, let them determine with
David, I will walk in the right way, etc. This sentence may be applied to every
one of us, to teach us to fly from Psalm. 101. 2.
the scorneful, and al contemners of God, and of his word, and not to conform
ourselves in any point with them, as also S. Paul teaches us in diverse places.
But it is principally belonging to kings and princes, to make this horrible
riddance, to the end men may live more surely, and out of strife, quarrelling
and slander.

11 The king is his freende that loves cleanness of heart: and it is for the
grace of his lips.
One may marvel why Solomon speaks so of kings, seeing it is daily proved,
that they make their chief minions, familiars, and darlings commonly of
whoremaisters and ribaulds, of flatterers, fools, and backebiters, of
talebearers, thieves, and rouers, of rash and over hasty persons, of the
ambitious and arrogant, of drunkardes and gluttons, of strife makers, seditious
persons, and moouers of al mischief. Al such men by their feats, deeds and
words, show clear enough that their hearts are foul and filthy, stinking
and infected, and that they will never be otherwise. And so they love not the
cleanness of heart, but one may cease his meruelling, when he shall understand
that Solomon speaks not of worldly and carnal Deuteronomy. 17. 15 Psalm. 2. 10.
kings, Superstitious, and idolaters, ignorant and unfaithful: but he speaks
of them which are truly instructed in the law, and doctrine of God, according
as he commands it, and as David warns them. Such kings do abhor the
wicked, and dispatch the land of them as much as they can: and contrariwise
they love the men of a good and a sound conscience, as Solomon signifies by
him which loves cleanness of heart, the which consists in the true
pureness of faith, and charity not feigned, in repentance and fear of the
Lord. Although such cleanness be known only of God, which sounds the
hearts, and proves the reins, yet nevertheless it manifests it self, for
of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. And the good man from the
good treasure of Mat. 12. 34.
his heart, draws forth good things: for this cause Solomon says, That it
is for the grace of his lips, that the king is his freende that loves
cleanness of heart, he calls the grace of the lips, words of truth,
good and profitable, which tend to the glory and honor of God, and the
edification of our neighbors. By such grace kings know what men they ought
to choose for the government of their subjects, what teachers they ought to
hear, and what kind of men they ought most to assist and favor. It is very
necessary that we have all this grace in our lips: but principally the Ministers
of the word, and judges of the earth, to execute their charge, and
administration well. Thus doing we shall be loved, not only of kings and princes
of the earth, which are well instructed in the word, but also of the king and
ruler of heaven and of earth. And as it is so, that al kings and superious of
the earth ought to be well instructed in the word of the Lord, and to walk
in his fear: one may say well, that Solomon speaks not here of that which
kings do, but of that which they ought to do. And so commands almost all the
kings of the earth: for there are very few that are their friends which love
cleanness of heart, but rather hate them and persecute them. Insomuch that if
God did not defend the pure and clean of heart, they should be often
tempted to give themselves to filth and infamy, to shun the hate of kings,
and too escape their persecutions.

Now when there is none of us, but he desires to be beloved of superiors,
let us understand that we are here counseled to cleanse our hearts, to the
end we may have gracious and pleasantlippes. Under the which we may here
comprehend not only words, but also al works and deeds which show an
inward cleanness: for to shun prolixitie, Solomon has named but the
lips. And also it would be a thing of nothing, and worthy of condemnation,
if we used good words, and that our works were not conformable thereto. Let
us follow therefore that which is taught us. Wash yourselues therefore, and be
cleanly, take away Esaias. 1. 16. 17 Iam. 4. 8.
the filthiness of your works from before mine eyes. But what admonition
soever is made us, it lies not in us to obey it, neither can we purify our
hearts ourselves, there is naught but the blood of Christ Jesus that purifieth
us, when we drink it by faith, and that by the holy Ghost, our consciences
be watered therewith too sanctify us, and make us obedient to the word:
wherefore we had need to pray, Wash me well from mine iniquity, and cleanse
Psalm. 51. 4
me from my sin.

12 The eyes of the Lord have regard to knowledge: but he overthrows the
words of the transgressour.
If we desire greatly to have grace in our lips, to be acceptable to our kings
and princes of the earth, by a stronger reason we ought still to strive, to
please the almighty which is King of Kings, and sees not only the lips, but
also al thoughts and deliberations be they never so deep, al enterprises and
attemptes be they never so hidden. Now although all the world know not that
GOD is so clear of sight, or that he printeth it not in his thought, yet
nevertheless there is none, but he naturally understands, that he is a God,
who ought to be served and pleased. As one may see, when there is no people so
rude and barbarous, which has not some religion and some ceremonies, by the
observation of the which he makes profession of his will to serve God. And so
he has the zeal of God, but this is not to say that he pleases God. For
the zeal almost of al men is without knowledge, wheretoo only the Lord has
regard. As Solomon pronounces saying,

The eyes of the Lord have regard to knowledge. This is not the knowledge of
the wise and prudent of this world which is but vanity: but this is the
knowledge by the which we are assured that God is our father, and that he
loves us, and will save us, by the which also we know so his will, that we have
no greater desire but to obey him according as he commands. This is the
knowledge wheretoo the eyes of the Lord have regard. This pleases him so,
that he demands al things to be done by the same: he approoueth that
which proceeds from the same, and maintains and preserves them which walk
according to the same. Solomon understands it so, as he shows by the
Antithesis, saying, but he overthrows, etc. When he puts overthrowing
against to have regard, he gives well to understand, that God accepts,
allows, and preserves the knowledge, whereunto his eyes have regard.
Contrariwise that he hates and disdaineth the words of the unfaithful, who
are rebels to him, seeing he overthrows their words. And when he puts The
words of the transgressour, a contrary to knowledge, he gives well to
understand that this knowledge is no other thing but the word of truth, of
justice, and equity, the which is so imprinted in the heart of man, that he
assures himself of the bounty of God, and demands nothing sooner then to
obey him. Contrariwise, the words of the transgressour are al purposes,
counsels, determinations, and enterprises of those which despise this
knowledge, and let themselves be carried away by their carnal affections, and
disordinate appetites to follow the wisdom of the world, as also their
deceites and malices. Such words or such doings please not, nor cannot please
God: and therefore he overthrows them, and brings them to nothing, and
deceives the transgressors Esai. 8. 9. 10. and 19. 3. and 30. 1. Job. 21. 14.
15. Esai. 2. 3.
of their intents and enterprises, as he does threaten them. Therefore let us
not be of the number of them which say to God, depart from us, for we will not
know thy ways, etc. But that we inuit one an other, saying, Come, let us
asce^d to the hill of the Lord, he will teach us his ways, etc. And albeit this
knowledge, and al they which keep it, have many enemies, which crave but their
decaie, yet nevertheless, they cannot prevail against them, for the Lord of
hosts, has a care over the^, he keeps them, and defends the^, as Solomon
signifies by the eyes of the Lord, which have regard to knowledge. Also
although the wicked, which are enemies to the church of God, wherein only is
knowledge (as the Pope is, and al his adherents, enemies of truth) use many
words, and very terrible, although they determine and consult to maintain
themselves, and seek and practice to destroy the faithful: Yet nevertheless,
let us take heed not to renounce the true knowledge, knowing that God has a
care over us, and that he will not suffer his enemies to obtain their desires,
but will ouerturne al their enterprises, and destroy them. And so the preaching
of the pure truth shall obtain victory and be permanent, whereas
contrariwise, the adversaries shall perish.

13 The slouthful body says, there is a Lion without: I shall be slain in the
street.
One may wonder at Solomon, that so often, and in so sundry manners, speaks of
the slouthful: but the cause well understood, one ought not much to wonder, for
the number of the slouthful is great, and what admonition soever is given them,
yet they become not a whit more dilligent. Also there are many which esteem not
themselves slouthful, because it seems to them, that they have good occasion
to desist from their duty. They persuade themselves, that they have good will
to be employed, but there are many difficulties which will not permit them.
Solomon signifies these difficulties by the Lion, which is without, which
spares not the^ which are weak, but kills them, and this is to mock the
slouthful withal. Therefore if we will not be mocked, let us beware we conceive
no fear, by the which we may desist from doing our duty. For it is meet
that we be resolute and assured, that if we walk according as God has
commanded us by his word, that he will sooner send his Angels, then he will
suffer us to fall, or to perish without remedy. The faithful endure many Psalm.
91. 11
afflictions, yea, to the loss of life by the violence, and cruelty of Lions,
infidels, and idolaters, but they perish not: for their persecutors have no
power over the soul. When therefore it is needful to do our endeavor, we tempt
not God, if in following his ordinance we despise, and fear not the temporal
dangers which are offered: for to te^pt God is, when without his word, we assay
extraordinary matters, and put ourselves in evident perils. Jesus Christ
shows us both two: first, when he did not cast himself down headlong: as the
devil tempted him to do. Secondly, when he feared not to ascend into
Jerusalem, Mat. 4. 5. and 20. 17. Act. 1. 4.
knowing that he should be delivered into the hands of the Scribes and
Pharisees, and to be put to death. The Apostles went not out of Jerusalem,
because they were so commanded: But when they were filled with the holy Ghost,
they went from Jerusalem throughout all the world, not fearing any Lions, for
they are commanded so. Behold, Act. 1. 8. Dan. 6. 16.
Daniel feared to disobey God, and the Lions did him no harm at al. If
therefore it be needful to expose ourselves to dangers according to the word of
the Lord: let us not fear Lions, let us not say, The Lion is without, etc. But
let us assure ourselves of the promise that God makes to the faithful, Thou
shall go upon the Lion and Adder, the young Lion and the dragon shall thou
tread under thy feet. Psalm. 91. 13.
Note we moreover that the slouthful are are not only they which do nothing,
but also they which for fear of dangers, perform not their duty, although
they apply themselves to other works, which seem to be excellent. As amongst
the rest, they which cover themselves John. 3. 2.
with Nicodemus deed, who came by night to Jesus Christ. Monks and Friars
persuade themselves that they labor well in their divine service, but they are
not only slouthful, but also thieves, robbers and murderers, whereby they
deserve well to have poverty, and to be hanged and executed in hell.

14 The mouth of strange women is as a deep pit: he whom the Lord is angry
withal, falls therein.
We have been amply admonished to keep ourselves from whoredom, and the
dangers have been showed us, wherein they Pro. 2. 16. and 5. 3. and 7. 5.
fall that are whoremongers, and whores. Nevertheless Solomon contenteth not
himself: neither (seeing whoredom is so common a thing) we cannot have too
many aduertisementes, as well to turn the hearts of them, that will be taught,
as to make the incorrectible more guilty, and inexcusable. Therefore to show
us, what danger it is to consent to whoremongers, and whores, he compares
the mouth, that is to say, the speech, pleasant talk, flatteries, and
enticements of strange women, that is to say, of whores, to a deep pit.
Wherein he signifies, that as a beast which is hunted, if he fall into the pit
which is prepared for him, can never get out again, because the pit is very
deep, but must therelye and perish. Even so they which lead their ear to
consent to whooredome, go to perdition: and principally if God by his just
anger chase or hunt them thither, as Solomon signifies well saying, He whom
the Lord is angry withal, falls therein. Which is to say that God being
angry with any one for his sins, makes him to fall into whoredom, to the end
to punish him the more rigourously, and so he punishes sins by other sins.
As also Saint Paul shows well. Romans 1. 14


Let us learn therefore when whooredomes are rife, that the Lord is angry,
and that he is greatly offended for their misdeedes, to the end we may be
careful to keep ourselves from committing any iniquities, for fear least the
Lord give us over to whoredom, and we deserve horrible punishment. Let us
take heed we flee from pomp and delight, bravery and pride, ease, and
ydlenes, gluttony, and drunkenness. For such sins the Lord was angry against
Sodom, Genesis 19. 24 Exe. 16. 49. 15.
and Gomorra, and gave them over to whoredom, yea to filthiness and abominable
infamy quite against nature, and finally destroyed them utterly.

15 Foolishness is in the heart of a child: but the rod of correction will
drive it away from him.
Solomon has told fathers and mothers, that if they love their children well,
they should not spare the rod. And it is not without Pro. 13. 24.
cause that he has made such mention: for it is very necessary for
children to be chastized, otherwise they are lost for ever: Seeing that as
Solomon says,

Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. Which is to say, that
naturally children are so corrupt, that they have al their affections set on
malice and wickedness, on disobedience and rebellion, on dissolutions, and
insolences, on derision, and despising of God, of his word, and of al
religion. David confesses as much of himself: whereupon follows ruin and
perdition as has been seen. And because Solomon knew well that fathers and
mothers, did not desire that their children should go to destruction, but
rather that they were preserved: therefore he teaches them how they shall
unbind this folly from the heart, when he says, But the rod of correction
will drive it away from him. Although the Psalm. 51. 7. Pro. 1. 24.
rod wherewith one beats children, be very profitable, and very
necessary to bring them in awe, and bridle them from many dissolute and loose
deeds: yet nevertheless the best correction to unloose the folly from the
heart, and to drive it away from the child, is, by the word of the Lord, to
exhort him, to show him the way, and to threaten him. Saint Paul shows it
well. Magistrates, are here advertised of their duty, and also we are al
advertised to mortify Ephe. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21.
our flesh, and to repent.

15 Who so does the poor man woong, to increase his own riches, and gives
to the rich, he certainly goes to poverty.
We fear naturally poverty, which to eschew, we strive to heap goods upon
goods. Which thing is very hard to do, except by robbing others, and
principally the poor, who have no power to defend themselves, and by seeking
by gifts and presents to obtain the favor of the rich. And therefore the
custom and use of them which will wax rich, is to work oppression and
violence to the poor, and give to the rich. But they deceive themselves: for
as Solomon says, Who so does the poor man wrong, etc. he certainly goes to
poverty. For that which he rauisheth and takes away from the poor man, can
be of no great value, but in regard that the little which the just man
possesses, is to him a great thing, and that he is content with it, and it is
more worth to him then great treasures to the wicked. And although the wicked
can take no great substance from the poor man: yet nevertheless to maintain
and keep himself in the favor of the rich man, it behooves him to give
great gifts, otherwise he shall not be welcome, and the rich man will despise
him. If therefore he take away but a little, and give much, he must of force
come to necessity.

Moreover Solomon has said, He that does a poor man wrong, dishonors
him that made him. Whereby he deserves Pro. 14. 31
well to have indigence: for he not only dishonors a mortal man, but also
him, that gives abundantly al things to our use. If the poverty appear not
in this life, the wicked shall feel it at the uttermost, in death everlasting.
Then shall be accomplished wholly: See here, my servants shall eat, but you
shall have hunger, See here, my servants shall drink, but you shall have
thirst, etc. Esai. 65. 13 Luke 6. 24.


17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise: apply thy heart
unto my doctrine.
There is none, but he would willingly be thought the faithful servant of
God: and to keep themselves in that reputation, many will be careful to observe
ancient customs, and to hold the doctrines of men, and to follow the
inventions of the Devil, which bear any fair show: or will give themselves to
live after their good meaning, and fancy of their own heads, and take great
pain about such trumperie, and would have God to take it in good part, yea,
and to be bound to them: for they are so much abused, that they persuade
themselves, that there come great merits by the observing of such follies and
abomination. Of the which number are the poor Papists, and al those that are
given to their own senses: but to serve God well, it behooves us to apply our
senses, exterior and interior to the word of the Lord, and submit ourselves
his scholars and disciples, as he has already often Pro. 2. 1. and 3. 1.
and 4. 1.
invited us by Solomon. And again now, when he says, Bow down thine ear,
etc. Wherein he shows, that the administration of the word is very
necessary for us, and that we ought to be subject to the same, as also the
Apostle shows it. For this occasion Jesus Christ himself gave some Apostles,
some Prophets, others Evangelists, and others Pastors and Doctors, etc. Ephesians.
4. 11 Hebr. 13. 17
These are the wisemen whereof our Lord speaks: whose words we ought to
hear, the which are truly the words of Jesus Christ, who is master and
doctor of the wise: for he that hears the the ministers of the truth, he
hears Jesus Christ, and it is he that we ought to hear according to the
commandment of God his father and we ought to hear him, to yield him
obedience with heart, as Solomon shows in saying, And apply thy heart to my
doctrine, for wise men are given us to the end that by hearing them, we may
become wise, which cannot be do one, but by believing their words and putting
them in practice, as Jesus Christ declares. Note we Mat. 17. 5 Mat. 17. 5
Mat. 7. 24
moreover, that those men are wise, which by their words do open us the
knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ. These are they that we ought to hear,
and not the Pope and his adherents, which are but fools, mockers, seducers and
murderers of the souls of the simple, which have them in admiration. Note we
also when Solomon demands the appliyng of the heart to doctrine, that he
shows us, that it is not meet that we remain blind, and ignorant, nor
that we be dumb and idle: for if the heart be truly given too doctrine we
shall see and know that, which we have to believe and do, to serve God and our
neighbors, and of the abundance of the heart, our mouths will sound out
praises, prayers, and thanks giving: And our members will apply themselves to
the service of our neighbors, for such also is the end of the preaching of
the word, that being well instructed, we bring forth good fruits.

18 For it will be a pleasant thing, if thou keep them in thy belly, and order
them together in thy lips.
We love to have joy, pleasure, mirth and delectation: but because of the
corruption of our nature we are ignorant, and blockishe, and have not the wit
to know whereto we ought to give ourselves, to obtain the enjoying of true
delight, and so we had need to be taught. Otherwise al our pleasures and
delights are in vanity and folly, in filth and wickedness, and in all
things which are to the appetite of our sensuality. For this cause, Solomon
to withdraw us from the lusts of the flesh, has willed us to give ear to
the words of the wise, to the end we might be instructed and that knowledge
might pearce to the depth of our hearts. He knew that the children of God
could not be better rejoiced, then by the word of the Lord: for it
surmounteth al worldly pleasures, in them which truly take any smacke therein,
and suck, and swalowe it into their hearts. Also Solomon thought it a great
joy and pleasure, to apply the heart to the words of the wise, and to
doctrine, which is, the word of the Lord, seeing to yield a reason of the
former inuitation, to wit, bow down thine ear, etc. he says, for it will
be a pleasant thing, etc. Here he shows that which proceeds necessarily
of the true hearing of the words of the wise, and applying of the heart to
knowledge, and says, that it is a thing very pleasant, sweet, fair, and
delectable. Which could not be, if one took not pleasure in the former: for
one cannot continewe in a thing wherein he takes no delight, and if for a
certain season he rejoice therein, it is to no purpose. As is soon seen when
he is easily turned therefrom. Therefore Solomon speaks of continuance when
he makes mention Of keeping it in the belly, and ordering the lips: and
covertly he requires that we resemble not the seed, cast in the hye way on
stony ground or amongst thorns. But that we receive the seed in good earth,
which brings forth fruits, which consist in the faith and confession of the
same principally. As one may gather it by S. Paul, Solomon marketh faith (which
is not without repentance) saying, Romans 10. 9. 10.
If thou keep them in thy belly. For we cannot assure ourselves indeed, that
God loves us, for the love of Jesus Christ which died for our sins, if we
be not sorrowful because of the same, and desire not to be delivered therefro,
and take delight in that which God commands us. Behold here how we ought
to keep the words of the wise, and the doctrine in our bellies, that is to
say, within our hearts. He marketh confession or profession, which is but
vanity and folly, if it be not joined with the good works which God
commands us. Our Lord Jesus shows it well, He marketh (I say) this
confession, saying, And if thou Mat. 7. 21.
order them together in thy lips. He says, together. For it is not mere,
that we make confession by halfes, nor that we choose out some of those
works, which God commands us, and omit the rest. But we ought to give al
our understanding to that service which God asks of us, and strive with
ourselves to yield him whole obedience. We see then, that having heard the
words of the wise, and applied our hearts to doctrine, we ought to take
pleasure in faith and repentance, in confession, and the works which follow
thereof. And thus doing, we shall attain to that, which the Prophets speak
of the beauty of Jesus Christ, and his kingdom. Psalm. 45. 3. Esai. 52. 7.
Psalm. 37. 4. 5.
If we take such pleasure to keep the words of the wise in our belly, God
also will take pleasure to fulfill our desires.

19 That thou may put thy trust in the Lord: I have given thee to
understand to day, even to thee.
Those which hear not, nor make no account, to give themselves to that which
is already taught the^ in the former verses, 17. and 18. walk in this world
at haphazarde, and know not what shalbecome of them: as we ourselves have
felt when we were Papists: and so they be blind, and know not to whom to
adresse themselves, to be assured of their salvation, but are in continual
trembling. And chiefly when they deem themselves near temporal death, for
they know not whether they go, and expect rather decaie then safety. If we
will not walk in such uncertainty, let us take good heed, not to despise the
doctrine which we have heard in the two former verses: for it is given us to
make us very wise and skilful, and to the end we should not be afraid of
what affliction soever happen us, or is seen near and imminent: but that we
be assured that the Lord loves us, and that he has care over us, and will
defend, guard, and deliver us from al afflictions, and that by his means we
shall never perish, but he will save us eternally. Solomon affirms it so,
when he says,

That thou may put thy trust in the Lord, etc. The end therefore of the
doctrine which is spoken to us, is, that we be wary, and that the doctrine
pearce even into our hearts, not to rest there by opinion, as does a profane
or worldly history: But to the end we may learn to know, and assure
ourselves that God loves us, and that he will never suffer us to perish, but
will save us for ever, giving us a blessed life in the glory of heaven. Solomon
propounds us this Theology, To day, that is to say, when we have time to
hear it, and apply our hearts theretoo, which is all the time of our life,
the which we ought to imploye, to meditate the doctrine of our God, and to
exercise ourselves in the same, day and night, and principally, when we have
the books of the holy scriptures, and faithful and true Doctors, which busy
themselves to make us understand the same. We ought not to be negligent and
slow, but prompt, and ready to hear and understand, to the end, to believe
by certain knowledge and assurance which may be well rooted in our hearts,
and not to submit ourselves to the faith of others: as those which delight in
their ignorance, and say, that they believe that which the Church believes.
For God by his doctrine speaks to every one of us, and will that every one
receive it, to believe therein, and walk according to the same. Solomon
shows it well, when he is not content to say, I have given thee to understand:
But he adds, Even to thee. Or also, thou, receive the words of the wise,
and doctrine. So none can vaunt himself indeed to be faithful, unless he be
also skilful: for God speaking of his faithful, says, I will give thee
understanding, and will teach thee the way, wherein thou shall walk. Also, al
thy children shall be instructed of the Lord. I will plant my law Psalm. 32. 89
in them, and write it in their hearts, etc: And will sprinckle upon you clean
water, and you shall be cleansed from al your crimes, etc. Esai. 54. 13 Iere. 31.
33 34. Eze. 36. 25
and will cause that you shall keep my appointmentes. Now that, To day, is all the time of our life, yea, all the time wherein the word of God shall be preached
in the Church, it is manifest by the same, that we ought to hear it, believe
it, and obey it at al times. And although the Jews be warned, To day if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, etc. yet the Apostle teaches us,
that the Psalm. 95. 7. 8. Hebr. 3. 12 13. 14.
Psalmist has not only spoken of them of his time, but also of us. And seeing
that Solomon by his doctrine, strives to persuade us, that we put our trust
in God, and that we cannot do so, but by Jesus Christ, which is our
Propitiatory, and our Advocate, it follows, that he sends us to Jesus
Christ, and will that by the doctrine Romans 3. 25. and 51. and 8. 34.
of truth, we learn to believe in him, to the end that we perish not, but
have life everlasting.

20 Have not I written to thee, three times in counsels and learning?
To the end we should not excuse ourselves, if we understand not, how we
ought to put our trust in the Lord: the Lord has given us diversity of
scripture, as the books of Moses the histories, and books of the Prophets,
wherein we may learn to follow the counsel of God, and to know the love
which he bears to us: and not content with this, he has given us, moreover,
diverse scriptures by his Apostles, and Evangelists, to the end we may see
more clearly the right way of al righteousness and justice, of al holiness,
and religion, and that we may contemplate more nearly the bounty of God, and
his love toward us in Jesus Christ his Son, which is our assurance, and our
salvation. And now again, he has given his Church many Pastors, and
Ministers of his word, the which is preached purely to many nations, in diverse
languages, and gives us the old and new Testament, translated faithfully
into many tongues. And so he gives us counsels and learning, in sundry manners,
as Solomon signifies, by three times, putting (according to the manner of the
scripture) a number certain, for the uncertain. If therefore we be ignorant,
dull, faithless, and doutful, it is our great fault, seeing that God has given
us so many scriptures, and so many faithful expositours, which are careful and
diligent to ininstruct us, which cease not to open their mouths often, and to
put their hands to the pen, to make us the more wise and skilful. Such
perseverance is well signified to us, when Solomon says, Have not I written to
thee? etc. Which thing he speaks in the person of God, or of the wakeful
Doctors: And shows us that it is not enough to have care of the Lords
flock for a certain season, but that we ought to continue. Also, that the
people be not vexed, if one cease not to propounde the scripture to them: and
that one strive to print the word of the Lord so well in his heart, that
putting his trust in God, his continual delight be, to meditate this doctrine,
to speak thereof, and to confirm his life thereafter, by good works, and
holy conversation. For in as much as we are inclined to contrary things,
and when we are taught, are slouthful, and negligent, and easily go out of the
right way, which we are entered into: For this cause it is very needful that
one write unto us three times: which is, that he cease not to propound unto us
the holy scriptures, which are replenished with counsels, and learning.

21 To the end, to give thee to know the assurance of the words of truth, to
answer words of verity to them that send to thee.
It is not enough, that we have the holy Scriptures and faithful expositours:
but to the end we may make our profit thereby, and do good to our
neighbors, we ought to read the scriptures, and hear the Doctors, to such
end as God has given them us. Solomon shows us the end, saying, To the
end to give thee to know the assurance of the words of truth, etc. Wherein
he declares to us, that the scripture and Doctors are given us to have a sure
knowledge of the truth, whereto Saint Paul agrees. Moreover, it is meet,
that having so profited in this assurance Ephe. 4. 11.
and certeintie, we know how to render a reason of our Faith, to them which
shall desire to be instructed by us, or which will impugn the doctrine that we
have learned. Solomon will have it so, when he says, To answer, etc. Whereto
Saint Peter agrees, saying, And be ye always ready to answer every one,
that demands reason of the hope which is in you, 1. Pet. 3. 15
etc. The Apostle to the Hebrews shows them well, that one ought so to
profit in the word of truth, that he may be able to answer, when he
says. For when as concerning the time, ye ought to be teachers, yet had you
need again, that one teach you the first principles of the beginning of the
word of God, etc. And Hebr. 5. 1^
if we ought al so to profit in the word of truth, the Ministers above the
rest, ought to be careful thereof, to the end, to instruct the people in sound
doctrine, and stop the mouths of the adversaries of the truth. As Saint
Paul admonishes them thereof, chiefly when he writes to Timothy and to
Titus. But although we ought to answer every one, yet this is not to say,
that we may be al Doctors to have public charge, nor that we ought to know
(of force) how to expound the Scriptures point by point. It is enough for the
simple sort to know that Jesus Christ is their Savior, and that they be so
confirmed therein, that the suttleest Doctors of the world, nor all the power of
hell cannot withdraw them from the hope which they have in God by Jesus Christ
our savior. And as we have not to do, to be so subtle, so it is not meet,
that we be over curious to enquire after that, which appertains not to the
honor and glory of God, nor to our salvation, nor to the edification of our
neighbors.

22 Polle not the poor, because he is poor: and oppress not the afflicted
at the gate.
Solomon following the law and the Psalms, has already often told us of the
poor, accusing and blaming them which do them wrong. But because the world
amendeth not, for any time that comes, but rather waxes worse, and
iniquity increases daily, as is seen by proof: for this cause Solomon
persisteth to admonish us of our duty toward the poor, saying, Polle not
the poor, because he is poor, etc. In commanding this, he first warns
Magistrates and Judges of the earth to have pity and compassion on the poor,
and to yield them presently the right that appertains to them, without
suffering themselves to be corrupted by gifts or brybes, by friends or
parents, to pervert the judgment, and do wrong to him, who through his
poverty has no succor at al. But because experience shows that at al times
the world is replenished with wicked Kings, Princes, Magistrates, and judges,
which favor them whom they please, to oppress and hurt the poor: and that
rightly one may charge them that the spoil of the poor is in their houses:
we ought also to understand that Solomon accuses them of oppression and
injustice, of great malice, and cruelty, for when they be set at the gate
where anciently they Esal. 3. 13.
sat to do justice: whereas for the poverty and affliction of the needful,
they ought to be moved to pity and compassion, they take occasion, thereby to
polle and oppress them, against the duty of their office, and against their
consciences. And this is because they set not God before their eyes, nor have
no fear nor reverence of his word, nor force not to be blamed: For if one
speak not according to their will and pleasure they have power: and therefore
they revenge it presently. And so one proves in them, the truth of the
proverb which says, That if one speak well of princes he lies: and if he
speak evil, they amend him.

Secondly, by this commandment he admonishes every one of us, to beware that
we do no hurt to our poor neighbors, which are afflicted for lack of
goods or worldly succor: That we do them noe harm by disceyte nor violence,
nor under shadow of justice. As they do which by suits in law, gnawe and
eat up the poor, or by any other subtle means: but the world is like to
those great Mastife Dogs, who when they see any little curre that is poor
and feeble, incontinently they run upon him, and all to byte him and tear
him. Even so by how much more one sees a man feeble and weak, by so much the
more he is ready to pille and polle him, and to do him all the damage he can:
whereas, for his poverty and affliction, he should study to do him
pleasure. And because what means soever is made to forbid these thieves and
robbers these covetous catchpols and usurers to do so, and yet they be not
moved a whit more to mercy, but harden themselves in their disordinate
desires, in their crabbednesse and cruelty. Let us understand that this
sentence and others like it, serve for their accusation and condemnation.
Wherefore if we will not be accused nor condemned, as pollers and oppressers of
the poor, and afflicted: Let us obey this sentence or commandment, forsaking
al covetousness, usury and rapine, and al inhumanitie and cruelty, and
finally, al fraud and deceit: insomuch, that being moved to pity and
compassion toward our poor neighbors, we open our bowelles unto them, in
helping them according to our ability, and their need. For seeing al goods
appertain to God, and that they which have them, are stewardes to the Lord,
(or at least wise, ought to be) not only we polle and oppress the poor and
afflicted, when we take to ourselves the substance which they possess, but
also when we disdain to bestow upon them, the goods, which God has given us.
And as (if we do so) we are without al mercy: so we shall have finally a
condemnation without al mercy.

23 For the Lord himself will deal in their cause: and take away the soul of
them which do polle them.
There is none, but being asked whether one should fear God or men more, will
not answer, God: And being asked, whether one ought to choose to be in Gods
favor, or men's rather, will not answer, in Gods. But we prove that the heart
is not like to the mouth, and that one thinks one thing, and says an other:
seeing the evil dealing that one uses to the poor, and the flatteries and
fair shows that one makes to the rich, and also that one is more ready to
please God then men, and fears more to transgress the ordinances of men,
then the commandementes of God. Many fear Leuit. 19. 13 verse. 22.
more to fall into the hands of men, then into Gods hands. If men make any
decree, each one will take heed, to attempt the contrary: and yet they make no
account to transgress Gods laws: he says, Thou shall not do thy neighbor
wrong, neither rob him. And by Solomon, Polle not the poor, etc.

If earthly Judges had made such a decree, men would have been afraid to
have broken the same, for fear of purchasing their displeasure, and being
punished for the same: and chiefly if they should know that Judges had poor
men in remembrance. But for all the commandementes of God, and for all his
threatenings, yet they cease not to polle the poor, and to oppress the
afflicted. For although with mouth they say, that God is the defendour and
protector of the poor, yet because they see ordinarily that the poor and
afflicted are polled and oppressed, and that they which molest and trouble
them, are most strong and prosper, they think that God has no regard to the
affliction of the poor, to deliver them and save them: neither think they
that the Lord will punish them for the same. Yea, the poor themselves are
tempted, to think and say, that God forgets and forsakes them, because
they see, that they which oppress them are in prosperity, which seems
everlasting, and that their afflictions have no end, as has been said
heretofore. But the oppressors, and those which are oppressed, think both
very ill. For seeing that God is a just Judge which sees and knows al
things, he is, and will be the protector of the poor, and will punish them
that oppress them. Solomon shows the decree and the protection, when he
says, For the Lord himself will deal in their cause. And afterward their
punishments, saying, And will take away the soul of them which polle them. This
is as though he should say, The poor neither find Atturnies, nor
Counselors, nor Judges for themselves, because they have not wherewith to
furnishe out the matter withal. Men polle them, and gnawe them even to the
bone. Insomuche that they have not wherewithal to defend themselves, and it
seems that they are lost and cast away, and that they shall never recover
themselves: yet nevertheless they ought not to loose courage, nor to despair:
for God, which is just and merciful, and of more might then all the rest, will
plead for them, and do justice in their cause against the rauishers and
oppressors, whose goods he will not only take away, but also their lives, and
will destroy them for ever. Saint Paul accords heretoo. For let us not
think otherwise, but that Solomon speaks namely of the poor which have 2.
Tim. 1. 6. 7
the fear of the Lord, and that for love of the same, are afflicted of the
enemies of truth. Also God is not the protector of the Infidels, be they
never so poor, and afflicted, but rather sends them misery upon misery,
and adds torments to torments, until such time as he has wholly destroyed
them. And therefore we may well say, that in the 22. verse he forbids the
wicked to afflict the poor faithful flock, for it is of them that he has
care, as we ought to understand by faith and to assure ourselves thereof,
because we know that God is true in his promises.

24 Accompany not with an angry wilful man: and walk not with the furious.
Seeing we are called to peace, it is meet that we seek and follow peace, as
we are all admonished to do. Also we naturally love peace, if we be not
senseles, enraged and inspired with the devil, Wherefore to the end that we may
follow our vocation, and that we be not frustrate of that which we love, let
us have no acquaintance with them which are void of grace, gentleness,
benignity, modesty, temperance, humble mind, and patience, and are
replenished, with pride, cruelty, ire indignation, and wickedness, Solomon
shows that we should do so, when he says,

Accompany not with an angry wilful man. etc. With them that are of that
quality we can have nothing but strife and debate. For either they are angry
with us, or else they provoke us to anger against them, through their too
great ire and fury, whereby they are transported to do us injury and
violence, because we do not as please the^. Such is the nature of anger and
fury: as Abel has Genesis 4
proved it, Joseph, Moses, David, and Jesus Christ, and now the poor
faithful flock: Or else we learn also to be angry and wrathful, whereupon
ensues our destruction, as Solomon shows us when he says.

25 Least thou learn his ways, and reociue hurt too thy soul.
For two causes amongst the rest hurt is due too the yreful and furious man,
and to him that learneth his ways. The one is, Pro. 14. 17 Pro. 1. 7. 22. 15.
18.
because he commits folly, and so is incorrigible, and mocker and contemner
of al correction and counsel, Whereof wisdom complains, The other is, that
he makes debates, whereby he procures the decay of his neighbors, whereby
he deserves well to hurt himself. Nevertheless this is not to say that it is
not lawful to be angry sometimes, provided that it be justly, and
temperately, as Saint Paul shows, otherwise anger is not lawful, for it Romans
13. 4. Ephesians. 4. 26. 31 Ia. 1. 19. 20. Gal. 5. 20
is one of the works of the flesh.

26 Be not thou one them that give their hand upon pledge and are sureties for
debts.
This matter has been spoken of, and amongst other things it has been said
that Solomon seeks not to withdraw us from Pro. 6. 1. 11. 15
doing pleasure and service to our neighbors, whom we know to be in
necessity: but he will not, that for the liberality which we use toward our
neighbors to solace and help them, we ourselves should come into poverty
and need, he shows this now himself, wen he says:

27 Why will thou put thy self in this danger? for if thou have not
wherewithal to pay, they will take away thy bed from under thee.
Saint Paul is agreeable heereto. Now the manner of aiding our neighbors ought
to be, that as we should be content with things present, so we should also
help them with that which we have in hand, and can well spare, and with good
will: for we know not if in time to come we shall be able to satisfy them whom
we are pledge unto, and yet nevertheless in giving our word, we vow to save
them harmless in the time to come for whom we are surety: which is to do
God injury, to whom only it belongs to dispense of things future: and as
Solomon says, we put ourselves in danger of poverty and to have that thing
taken from us which is most necessary to us, which is signified by the bed.

28 Thou shall not remove the ancient land mark which thy fore elders have
set.
Seeing it is commanded, Thou shall not remove thy neighbors mark, which they
of old time have set in thine inheritance: And acurse is pronounced for him
which remooueth the mark of his Deuteronomy. 19. 14 and 17. 17
neighbor: It might seem that Solomon needed not to put this sentence in
writing, which contains nothing else but that which has been said by Moses,
but because we are dull and sluggishe, we have need to be waked by many
messengers: also we are so given to the earth, that we have never enough of
it. And if we be let a lone, we will put other men's possessions to our own,
and usurp them to ourselves. And if we dare not take al for fear of blame,
and reprehension, at least wise in the absence of our neighbors, we transport
and shift the land marks somewhat further which were set and appointed time
out of mind. And so we steal and rob the possessions of our neighbors, and
are accursed, as we have heard by Moses: and also as Esaias pronounces saying,
Cursed be Esaias. 5. 8.
you that join house upon house, and land upon land, til there be no more
place left: will you dwell alone upon the earth? If we will be free from this
curse, we ought to be content with our just patrimony, or with that which
without disordinate desire we gain with our labor, or otherwise get with
equity. And if it be not lawful to transgress that which our ancestors
have ordained lawefully, touching temporal goods, which serve our bodies for
this present life, much less it is lawful to transgress that which the
eternal (who is above al men) has ordained by his word, for the health of our
souls without adding or diminishing any thing. For as the children of Israel
through their rebellion and disobedience, their small trust misbeliefe, did
wander in the deserts forty years, and there dyed, not coming to the limits
which God had appointed them in the land of Canaan: So they which transgres the
laws of God, shall be as Cain, fugitives and ru^nagates in this world, so that
they shall not come to the kingdom of heaven, where out marks are pitched,
from before the foundation of the world. We have not to do, to Allegorizate
this sentence, and principally as the Doctors Sorbonistes do, which say,
Transgress not the bounds of the Catholic faith, which have been ordained
from the beginning by the doctors of the Church, and other learned men, wherein
they would not speak amiss, but would give us good doctrine, if by the
doctors of the Church they understood Moses, the Prophets. Jesus Christ and
his Apostles, who to make us faithful, and obedieut, have taught us the only
word of God, without passing their limittes, or declining either on the right
side, or on the left. But these scholasticall doctors make here a double
fault: first when they think that Solomon has spoken Allegorically here, for
seeing in this sentence (as we have seen) we find sound and pure dectrine,
conformable to the law and the Prophets, and that Solomon speaks not
darkely, nor by similitude, we have no need to search for Allegories here:
for that would be to darken, and corrupt the natural sense of the sentence.
Secondly, they fail in this, that by the fathers, they understand those which
have busied themselves to teach and write since the time of the Apostles,
whether they have given good doctrine or not. It is enough for them, that they
may say, our fathers have done so, or said so, not once regarding if they
have followed rightly the word of the Lord or no, for they bare more
reverence to men then to God, and to man's doctrine, then to the word of the
Lord, as may be seen clearly by the articles of the Divines of Paris.

29 If thou have seen a man diligent in his business: he shall stand before
kings, and not among the simple people.
Albeit the courts and houses of kings and princes, be ordinarily stuffed
with the negligent, slouthful, and idle persons: and as much they can, men
drive out, and expel those which are careful and diligent to apply themselves
to well doing according to Gods commandment: yet nevertheless we will not do
Solomon so much as to reject this present sentence: for he speaks not of that
which is done amongst carnal and worldly kings princes and superiors,
although sometimes such men either for shame, or necessity to the end to
echewe further damage, receive into their courts and houses, wary and diligent
fellows, which will apply their business, and follow their vocation
faithfully: as Pharao received Joseph, Saul David, Nabuchodonozer Daniel: but
he speaks partly of that which one ought to do in a well ordered common
weal: and shows kings and greatmen of the earth what assistance they ought
to have in their courts and houses, to deal in the affairs of their realm
and country: and partly he shows what honor they are worthy of with me^,
that apply their business faithfully and carefully, partly also he speaks of
the account, which one makes of such personages. For if men see a fellow very
cunning in his science or doings, they say straightwaies that he is worthy to
serve a king, and that it is pity that he remains in base estate: Although
therefore that now kings and great men of the earth, crave not much the
assistance and service of honest men, which are wakeful and wary to do their
business: this argues not that this present sentence should not be received,
as true and excellent, seeing it instructs kings of their duty. Also it
shows that we ought not to refuse great charges, neither ought we to spare
our diligence, when the Lord has given us the grace to be nimble and quick
in our business: for it is meet that every one employ himself according to
the talent which he has received of the Lord. Thus doing, we shall not
stand only before kings of the earth, but also before the King of kings, who
will say to every one that has well ministered, It is well done, good and
faithful servant, thou have been faithful over few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: Enter thou into Mat. 25. 21.
the joy of thy Lord.

The xxiii. Chapter.
WHen thou shall be set down to eat with a great Lord, in considering,
consider that which shall be set before thee.
IT is an ordinary thing that the tables of kings and princes of great lords
and rulers are covered with diverse sorts of meats, and with diversity of
wines, and plenty, to show their magnificence, and satisfy their appetite,
and those which bear them company at the table. Insomuch that their ordinary
meals are bankets and feasts, and there each one is provoked, to eat and
drink excessiuely: and so their tables are as it were shops or schools of
gluttony and drunkenness. There they forget God, and al sobriety and
temperance, and take al their delight in stuffing their bellies, whereof
proceeds the despising of chastity: and they give themselves to daunsings
and unshamefast gestures, to want on looks, unlawful kisses, whoredoms and
adulteries. Notwithstanding this is not to say, that it is not lawful to eat
and drink in the company of great men, but it is not meet that one advance
himself, and stretch forth his arm to take meat, and satifie his desire.
There one ought to show al sobriety and temperance, contenting himself with a
little, to show good example to the^ which are set with him, or which wait
about him. It shall be therefore lawful for us to sit down at the table, and
eat with great men, as Solomon signifies somewhat, when he says,

When thou shall be set down, etc. He says not, fly the tables of great
men, and forsake their meats: but he will that we be so wise and well advised,
that we content ourselves with a little quantity of some meat, without
desiring great diversity, as he shows, when he says,

In considering, thou shall consider, etc. Understand we therefore that we are
admonished of temperance which ought to be in great estimation with all sorts
of people, and at al times: Although Solomon here make mention but of tables
of great Lords. And this is because it is not lawful to make ones self equal
with him that rules and has pre-eminence, as commonly table fellows to
maintain familiarity, will not seek pre-eminence, one above another, but
keep themselves equal: we will therefore follow temperance principally in
the presence of great men, and will so esteem of it: that we will sooner work
ourselves violence, then not overcome our disordinate appetite, over the which
we ought to be masters. Solomon will have it so, when he says,

2 And thrust the knife into thy throat, if thou be Lord over the soul.
By the knife in the throat, he shows well, that man ought to force himself
to follow temperance, and how to do himself violence, in mortifiyng his
lusts, which are signified by the throat, for he ought not to be so loose,
as to let his sensual appetite govern him, as Solomon warns us saying, If
thou be Lord over the soul. Which is as though he said, Certainly thou
ought to rule thy unruly appetite: for after the manner of the scripture,
the soul is taken sometimes for the appetite, which is not well governed, not
only in eating and drinking, but also in other things, as to do wrong to
ones neighbors. Therefore that which Psalm. 27. 12. and 41. 3. Romans 13. Ephe.
4. and 5. Col. 3
Solomon speaks by Allegory (as we ought to understand it, for he bids
us not thrust a knife into our throtes to kill ourselves) Saint Paul teaches
in many places without figure.

3 Desire not his delicates, for it is a meat of lies.
He shows here how one ought to thrust the knife into his throat, and how
to be Lord over the soul, and principally in the presence of great Lords:
who although they have their tables well furnished with meats, sweet, and
delicate, and we be invited thereto: yet nevertheless our appetite ought not
to be there too advance us, and make us familiars and fellows with them: for
if they show us a good countenance at their table, this argues not that they
are such, or will remain such as they seem to be: but there is much
feignednesse in them: they show themselves pleasant and tractable, when they
are replenished with cruelty: They will show themselves familiar, and imagine
treason in their hearts: Solomon declares it, saying, For it is a meat of
lies or disceit. Briefly, we are admonished by these three sentences not to
assure ourselves of any thing, although kings and princes of the earth, show
us a fair countenance: for they are variable, and change very quickly, but
that we be content with a mean estate, living by our daily travel and
labor, according to the vocation whereto we are called: there we shall not
eat the meat of lies, if in true obedience we follow our vocation, nor shall
not be frustrate of our attemptes: for when the great men of the earth do
forsake us utterly, yet the eternal Lord of Lords will stick fast unto us.
And therefore we ought to assure ourselves in him saying, The Lord is on my
side, therefore will I not fear what man can do against me.

4 Strive not to be rich, but cease from thine own advise.
The holy scripture shows us that God has created al things and that he
gives us al in plenteousnesse to use, and has never left Psalm. 118. 6.
us without a token of his liberality, sending showers and fertile seasons.
And likewise he has enriched many of his servants as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
David, Solomon, and a great number of others: and hereby he has showed us that
riches are good cretures, and that it is lawful to have plenteousnesse thereof
and be rich: Wherefore it might seem that it is a thing praise worthy to
strive to be rich, and to refuse nothing of that which God gives, but to
rejoice in the 1. Tim. 6. 17. Act. 14. 17.
same as the Lord will have it, and as he has declared by his word, as is
alleged heretofore. But the world has no regard to that which god has
made, but seeing the rich to be at their ease, to have power, credit, and
authority, and each one to flatter them, and have them in admiration. Seeing I
say: their course of life to be such, he coueteth to be rich, and many
travel earnestly to hoorde up substance, and he that does so, is esteemed wise,
wary, expert and an honest man, chiefly of those that would be rich. But one
ought not to busy himself after such matters, nor have such a thought in his
head. as Solomon declares saying, Strive not to be rich, etc. He forbids
not to strive or take pain. For as we have seen heretofore God has
appointed that man should apply himself in his business, he says not, that
it is to be rich, for God which makes nothing evil, has enriched many of his
servants. Also he forbids us not to be wise and wary in ordering our goods,
and making our profit thereof, keeping them or disposing them as we ought to
do but he forbids us to take care for the goods of this world. He will not
that our minds and bodies should wax weary in hoording up goods and riches: as
if without the same we were miserable and of Mat. 6. 19. 20. 25. 1. Tim. 6. 8.
force must perish, whereto Jesus Christ agrees. He forbids us also to be
witty as the children of this world, who think not themselves wary enough, if
they boil not after riches of the world, as if their life consisted in the
same: And so making such commandment, he will that we keep ourselves from
covetousness, whereof Luke. 12. 15.
also Jesus Christ admonishes us. And to obey Jesus Christ well, we ought to
prop ourselves upon the providence of God, according as Psalm. 37. 5. and 55.
23. 1. Pet. 5. 7. Ephesians. 2. 10.
we are taught. And in referring ourselves to the providence of God we ought
not to be idle nor negligent. For seeing that God has created us in Jesus
Christ to good works, which he has prepared to the end we might walk in the
same, our regeneration and satisfaction should be nothing, if we were not
careful to labor and take pains. But our travel ought to be free from al
covetousness of worldly riches, and we ought to regard to what end God has
ordained the labor, which is, that in him we fulfill his will, to put our trust
in him, and yield him obedience. Thus doing, our labor shal-be blessed of him
which commands it, for he wilgiue us suffisance, and our riches shall be
profitable to us. Whereas if by any other means we travel to get riches, they
will be vain and of no profit, and will vanish away, so that we shall not know
what is become of them. Solomon signifies it, saying,

5 Will thou cast thy eyes upon that, when it is nothing? For in bestowing, it
will bestow wings upon it self, like an Egle, and will fly up to the skies.
To show the vanity and unprofitableness of riches, and that we ought not
travel to gather heaps thereof, he calls it a thing of nothing, Or which is
not, or which one cannot obtain to his mind, although he bestow great care
thereon: the which he signifies by casting the eyes, or making them fly. And
signifying this care, he will not that one use it, as he well shows in asking
Will thou cast thy eyes? As if he said, It behooves thee not to cast thy
looks on worldly riches to labor after them to obtain great abundance: for
they are nothing: And though they were somewhat, yet one could not have the^
at his will no more tha^ an Eagle which is swift of wing, and flies aloft. For,
as it follows in bestowing, it will bestow. An Eagle so swift, is as nothing
to us, and we cannot take her, for we cannot fly on hye in the air: which
Solomon signifies by the skies or heavens: for by the same we ought to
understand the air, which is high above us: As sometimes they are taken in
the scriptures. Insomuch as a thing being high in the air, seems too touch
the skies: we ought (I say) to understand it so, and not the heavens which are
the seat of God, and the heritage of his elected. For if it be as hard for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven, as for a cammel to creep
through a needles eye, the riches that are frail and transitory cannot come
there. When therefore it is said that riches will bestow wings upon
themselves, it is given us to understand, either that they are not profitable,
and vanish suddenly out of our sight, as the Eagle does, or as the smoke which
ascends into the air, and no man knows what becomes of it: or that we
are not able enough to obtain the riches which we desire after our own
disordinate couetousenes. And so Solomon shows us that we labor in vain,
and that we be not well advised when we seek to enrich ourselves, or lift us
into an higher estate then God has called us unto. For riches ordinarily make
men proud, so that for their riches, they think they ought to be chosen to
higher estate, which brings to pass, that they fall very low: For he that
exalts himself shall be brought low. Note we therefore, that we ought to be
content, with that which GOD sends, and not given to avarice, nor aspiring to
high estates to become rich.

6 Eat not the meat with an evil eye, and covet not his delectable morsels.
If we set the evil eye against the good eye, which has been spoken of
heretofore: We ought by the evil eye to understand the Prou. 22. 9.
niggarde, snudge, covetous, unkind, cruel, and envious person, which cannot
suffer to see good, but to himself, whereof ensues that he has no delight at
all to succor or aid other men with his goods. Solomon counsels us, that
we should seek no pleasure nor service at the hands of such a one, when he
says, Eat not. etc. By meat we may understand the things which are most
necessary for this present life, as is bread. Also the word that Solomon uses
in his language, signifies, and is most commonly enterpreted bread, and our
Lord Jesus Christ, teaching us to demand our corporal necessities, says,
that we should pray, Give us this day our daily bread. Therefore if of him
that has an evil eye, we ought not to crave that which we have most need
of. Much less ought we to desire him to do us any pleasure, which may recreat
and rejoice us. Solomon signifies it well, saying, And covet not his delectable
morsels. We understand by delectable morselles, that which is pleasant and
recreatiue, because there is nothing wherein, sweet lips, Epicures, and
gluttons, delight more, then in delicate meats, and sweet morsels, yea, they
make their bellies their Gods, Note we moreover, that by meat and delectable
morsels, Solomon declares covertly, that although the evil eye be a niggard,
snudge and covetous, yet nevertheless he handles himself well, he lives at
his ease, and enjoys his pleasures. But he beholds not willingly his
neighbor to flourish and do well especially at his dispense. Nabal the husband
of Abiga was such a one, and so was 1. Sam. 25. Luke. 16.
the rich man.

7 For as if he had thought it in his stomach, he will say to thee eat and
drink, but his heart shall not be with thee.
By this reason he shows well, that it is true, that the evil eye will
counterfaite liberality. He will bid his neighbors sometimes to Bankets, and
will present himself to them, offering them al service and pleasure, and will
protest it so with his mouth, or signify it by some outward signs, as if he
were fully determined so to do, and that his will and mind were such indeed.
This is it that Solomon affirms saying, as if he had thought it in his
stomach, which is to say as if he were well pleased and agreed thereto. So he
will say to thee, eat and drink: But he is an hypocrite and a dissembler,
speaking and making shows and gesture, without al good meaning, as Solomon
declares saying, But his heart shall not be with thee. If a man have a noble
heart, and can know that such is the affection of an evil eye, he will never
seek to have pleasure nor service at his hand, for he cannot abide that one
should help him against his will: And so such succor should be more hurtful
then profitable to him: and it would serve him to no purpose to give thanks,
or to offer his service for the same, or to requite it Solomon signifies it
when he says,

8 Thou shall vomit out the morsel, which thou have eaten: and shall loose thy
pleasant words.
He signifies also that the evil eye is so woe that he has done any good
deed, that he will do some hurt before he can be recompensed for the same. And
(as we say) he will cut his throat that has received ought from him, and will
anoy him, so that no man shall have peace nor pleasure about him. And because it
is a hard thing that we should not speak evil of such fellows, and utterly
hate them, and that we should not seek to be revenged of them: Note we that
Solomon by these three sentences covertly admonishes us to fly al occasions,
which may move ill speeches, debates or strife, which are not fit for the
children of God, which ought to seek and follow all the means of peace,
concord, and charity with all men. He admonishes us also to be careful to
judge and discern, between the liberal that bear a good mind, and the
enuyous which desire but al mischief, to the end we loose not our time with
the envious, thinking to recreate ourselves with them, when they show us a
fair countenance and seem friendly to us. And that we put not ourselves in
that danger to have our throtes cut, and we and our family undone and destroyed
by such envious snudges. We are therefore here warned to fly two things:
The first is the ruin and destruction of us, and our family: The second, the
occasion of debates, strifes, hates, and vproares.

9 Whisper not in the fools ear, for he will despise the wisdom of thy
words.
Although Solomon say the fools have despised wisdom and instruction, and that
they are threatened perdition, as persons lost and cast away, Prou. 17. 24.
yet nevertheless wisdom cease not to address her words to the foolish. And
so it may seem that Solomon speaks now against himself, when he says,
Whisper not. etc. Or at leastwise, that he one Prou. 8. 5.
while approoueth one thing and another while disalloweth it, which thing we
ought neither to think nor say. For the holy Ghost is not variable or
chaungeable in meaning. And therefore, since we see that Solomon knew well the
despising that fools made of the word of God which is our wisdom and
instruction, and yet nevertheless he cease not to utter his words to
fools. And afterward he now forbids speaking to them, know we that the
word of God ought to be uttered to al manner of people, as we have seen
heretofore. And as our Lord Jesus Christ shows it in many parables: Pro. 1.
20. and 8. 1. Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 15.
and commands it to his Apostles, and he himself has spoken in the ears
of fools and contemners of good doctrine. But when men show their folly so
far, that of set malice they reject that which they know to be good, one
ought in no wise to talk of wisdom unto them. It is that which Solomon
means now when he says, Whisper not in the fools ear, etc. Wheretoo that
Mat. 7. Acts. 13. 45.
agrees which our Lord Jesus Christ says, Give not that which is holy to
dogs, and cast not your pearls before swine. etc. And Saint Paul uses it so
to the Jews which blasphemed. One might also say that Solomon speaks here
of particular and secret admonitions because he makes mention of the ears.
And also it is a common phrase of speech to say, I will tell him in his ear,
for I will tell him in secret or by himself. Of such admonitions fools are
not worthy: but ought to be reprehended and corrected openly, to the end to
confute them if it be possible, and to bring others in 1. Tim. 5. 2^.
fear.

10 Remove not the ancient Land mark: And enter not in the fields of
orphans.
We may see in the holy scriptures that God has poor orphans, widows and
strangers in great estimation: for not only he commands us to aid them and
do them good, and himself defends them from wrong: but also threateneth
those which do them injury, outrage, and violence. But men make no account
neither Leui. 19. 91. Psalm. 82. 3. 4. Esa. 1. 17. Exodus 22. 21. 22. 23. 24.
Zach. 7. 9.
of the commandment nor of the defense, and threatening. Solomon knew it well:
and therefore after Moses to make these men more inexcusable, he uses the same
caveat to forbid them, saying, Remove not, etc. Wherein although he speak but
of orphans for breuities sake, yet notwithstanding he lets not to
comprehend the others therein: as he has showed by the generality precedent.
And in the brevity he has the rather named the orphans, because according to
their age they are most weak and least skilful to defend themselves. The
world of the wicked knows it well, and therefore it is the^ whom they rob and
spoil willinglyest. Chiefly those which are given them for tutors and
defendours, are they which polle and eat them soonest, making fair items of
costs, and expenses, and getting account-takers which are favorable unto
them: to the end that those costs and dispences which they bring in, may be
easily allowed, as if they were just and reasonable. They would be afraid
and ashamed to present such accounts before honest and substantial men, and of
a good conscience: and yet they have no fear of God, who will never forsake the
poor fatherless children, but deliver them from oppression by his power and
might, which might the oppressers cannot withstand: and will perform the office
of a good governor, as Solomon pronounces of him saying.

11 For the redeemer is strong: And he will plead their cause against thee.
This is as though he said, because Orphans are weak and quyte void of al
humane succor, thou art so hardy as to polle and oppress them: but although
men have no care to take their cause in hand, and withstand the outrage and
violence that thou use to them, or that thou think thy self the
strongest, and none dare nor can resist thee: yet nevertheless they are not
void of succor. They have a redeemer who not only has good will to deliver
them from thy hands and violence, but also power, which power he will employ
against thee, and thou shall not resist him. And as Orphans and fatherless
children through their weakness and small strength cannot let thee to eat
them, and destroy them: even so what valiancie soever thou have, yet can thou
not let but God will be revenged upon thee, and will put thee to perdition. He
is their father, wherefore he will do his duty to maintain his children.
The Play of Psa. 68. 6.
the strong redeemer shall be that he will make known the wickedness of the
oppressors he will condemn them, and revenge himself upon them, and they shall
notwithstande nor have any succor at al.

12 Apply thy heart to understanding: and thy ears to words of knowledge. Esa.
10. 2. 3.

Oftentimes already Solomon has sought to make us attentive to the doctrine of
God, the which he calls one while law, another while instruction, and
another while wisdom science, and understanding. He does the same again in
this present sentence. And it is because we have great need to be often
advertised of that which appertains to the glory, and honor of God, to our
salvation and the edification of our neighbors: for of our own nature we are
so given to the world, that we despise that which is of God, and it seems
to us that it is but time lost to apply ourselves theretoo, because we be not
thereby the more exalted to wordly honors, nor more enriched with substance,
but the rather despised, and rejected, polled and oppressed. Nevertheless if
we will be exalted to true and perpetual honors, and enjoy the goods which will
not perish, we ought to follow that which Solomon has already often taught
us, and that which presently he does teach us. And to do this same, we ought
to apply al our understanding to learn to serve God, and our neighbors, and
therein to spare neither body nor mind: as God has created both the body and
the spirits, and will that we be wholly his and our neighbors. True it is
that the heart is the principal, as we ought to understand it by many
witnesses of the holy scriptures wherein is said that God beholds the
hearts, and that we are admonished to fear him, and love him with all our
heart, and that true worshippers worship the father in spirit and truth. And
Solomon signifies it here somewhat, when in the first place he requesteth the
applying of the heart. And afterward shows us that by the right affection
of the heart, the outward senses ought to be applied to receive instruction
which he calls words of knowledge. And in this manner he shows us that
we are not sufficiently instructed, if we give not our hearing to the word
of the Lord the which is our knowledge. And so, that the preaching of the word
is very necessary for us: insomuch that without this holy ministry we are all
ignorant. Not that God is not sufficient, and of power to instruct us
otherwise, without outward means by revelations and secret inspirations. But
he will have us to follow the order which he has established in his Church,
and that by men's means we be taught.

13 Withdraw not correction from the child: if thou beat him with a rod, he
will not dye.
It has been spoken of the chastizing and correction of children. But because
for the most part children are very hard to govern, Prou. 13. 24. and 19.
18. and 22. 15.
and almost incorrigible, and there are many foolish fathers and worse mothers,
which will neither chastise nor suffer others to correct their children: for
they strive to persuade themselves that they fear that one will kill their
children, because they are tender and delicate (in which doing they think
themselves more wise, the^ the holy Ghost: And yet they love not their children
so tenderly as they ought, and have not that care over them which they should
have. For persuading themselves that they preserve the bodies of their
children, not willing that they should in any wise be touched, they send (as
much as in them lies) their souls to perdition, maintayning them in folly and
wickedness) for this cause, Solomon not content with the former admonitions
shows now, that they ought not to be afraid, that the rod will hurt the
children when he says,

Withdraw not, etc. He is not content to say: Correct thy child: but
considering how profitable it is to continewe in brydling and correcting
children, he will not that parents having once begun to chastise them, should
leave of incontinent, and grieve to take the pain and care about them to
correct them. As many parents will give over their children, after that for one
or two corrections they cannot make them to amend. Either they despair of
them, or else are afraid to make them dull and blockish, or else utterly to kill
the^. Solomon will have fathers and governors of children to continue in
correcting and chastising them, according as they shall see needful, and
therefore he says, Withdraw not correction, etc. And to show that he
means not correction only of words, he adds. If thou beat him with a rod,
etc. He knew that children would put no belief in words, nor make no
account of verbal speeches and therefore he would have one to deal with the
rod, and promises that the body shall not be hurt therewith, so that death
shall follow, for he says, He should not dye, Wherein he instructs parents
and shows them that they ought not to spare the rod, but should make their
children feel it sharply, to make them remember to behave ^hemselues well, and
not to return to their wonted folly. And shows them that the marks or
little wounds which they shall make with the rod upon the body of their
children shall not be mortal. Also parents are admonished that in chastising
their children, they seek not to kill them. One may say moreover, that when
Solomon says He should not dye, That he gives us somewhat to understand that
those parents which are careful too correct their children, do save them
from the gallows, and do let them from being executed by justice.
Contrariwise they which make no account to chastise them, send them to the
galowes, as much as they can, but Solomon shows us another deliverance, which
is greatly to be set by when he says:

14 Thou shall beat him with a rod, and deliver his soul from hell.
The temporal gallows or gibbet destroys but the body for a certain time,
but hell swalloweth the soul for ever: yea and the body to after resurrection,
to remain in perpetual torments, both body and soul. Wherefore if fathers
and governors ought to be careful to keep the bodies from the gallows by
chastizing and beating their children with rods: by a far more reason, when
by means of the rod, one may keep them from death eternal, they ought not to
be negligent to use the rod, and yet nevertheless no^ think that the
material rod which one holds in his hand, has such virtue of it self
alone, for it is an instrument that GOD makes to prevail as he thinks good.
The principal rod to deliver children from hell, is the word of the Gospel,
which is the power of God to save al believers. And so it is not enough, nor
yet the principal point of correction and chasticement, To beat with the rod,
but with the same the principal and most necessary, is that fathers, and
governors bring up their children, in the knowledge and ways of the Lord. And
therefore they that have Ephe. 6. 4.
children in charge, ought to beecareful, to show them good examples, in
living soberlie in this present world, so that no filthy word proceed out of
their mouths, but only that which is good to the Tit. 2. 12. Ephe. 4. 29.
use of edifying, etc.

15 My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, and I also.
Carnal and worldly fathers are maruellously reioiced when they see their
children increase in beauty, or temporal prosperity, when they see their
bodies are in good health, and they receive pursely profit in augmenting
earthly goods, and when they have the craft to maintain themselves ciuilly
with their neighbors to have them still at their commandment. And yet they are
not careful a whit how they dispose of their souls. They have no care but of
that which is seen with the eye, and rejoice in no other thing. Likewise the
children of such men for the most part resemble their fathers and rejoice not
but in worldly matters. But the faithful and true Christians rejoice
principally, when their children inwardly are well disposed by wisdom. Solomon
shows it when he says,

My son, if thy heart be wise, etc. When Solomon is not content to say
simply, my heart shall rejoice, but adds, and I also, he admonishes us very
well, that the greatest joy of parents over their infants ought to be, when they
see them wise, but not after the world: for the wisdom of this world is but
folly before God: but that they be filled with divine wisdom, although this
world reprove it. Therefore when man beholds but the face, and there is none
but God which sees the heart, one may ask how fathers and mothers may rejoice,
at the wisdom of the hearts of their children. The answer is, that if the
heart be wise, it will show himself so, by works and words which are of God.
For the heart which is truly given to wisdom, suffers not the outward
members to be idle, but as much as in him lies, forces them to say and do
things, which are to the glory and honor of the Lord, and to the profit and
health of his neighbors. And so it behooves the children to rejoice their
parents, employing themselves to say and do things good and honest, just, and
righteous. Solomon signifies it, saying.

16 And my reins shall leap for joy, when thy lips speak righteous things.
See here how the wisdom of the heart, is manifested by the lips, by the which
we shall understand al other members, which we must turn from wickedness and
apply to well doing, according as God teaches us by his word. But Solomon to
shun prolixitie, speaks but of lips, and the rather of them, than of other
members because, they are readiest to manifest the inward parts, and most fit
to show forth the praises of God, and likewise to maintain the heart that it
wander not here and there out of wisdom, as we prove: for when we think
of any thing, it is streightwaies gone out of our hearts, except we common and
talk of it, and speak with our mouths: And also when the lips speak
according as the heart is affectionate, the other members are the more ready to
execute that which is uttered. And when he says, My reins shall leap for joy:
he uses repetition which is familiar in the scriptures. It is the same which
he has said. My heart shall rejoice and I also. For the reins are taken for
that which is most profoundly hidden in man, which is the heart, as may be
understood, in that the knowledge thereof is reserved to the Lord: and when he
ioineth speaking of righteous things to the wisdom of the heart, he shows
that Iere. 17. 9. 10.
wisdom rests not in fantasies, and good intentions of men, but in true
knowledge of the will of God, the which he declares to us by his word, which is
the perfect rule to guide us to will, think lay, and do, that which is right
and equity which rests only in this, that we yield the honor to God which
appertains to him, and that we aid one another in true charity and
brotherly love. This thus considered, we see whereof it is that parents
ought to rejoice principally, in regarding the conversation of their children:
The superiors in seeing their subjects: And the ministers in considering the
flock that they have to feed. Therefore since folly is bound in the heart of
the child, it follows well that al they which have any government of youth,
ought Prou. 22. 15.
very carefully to obey that which Solomon commands them ver. 13. 14.
Otherwise they cannot have true joy: for folly remains: And so the lips
speak not of righteous things: where at all faithful and Christian governors
ought greatly to rejoice. And therefore according to the estate that they
occupy, they ought to use correction, to drive a way folly which is bound in
the hearts of children, the magistrates in one sort, the ministers in another,
and the fathers in another, for they have not al one and the same power. The
ministers force consists only in the word: Magistrates have the sword, and
fathers the rod: and also they may use warnings and admonitions by the word.
For although it appertains only to ministers, to preach the word
publicly, yet nevertheless as magistrates and parents ought to govern
themselves by the same, so ought they to use it toward them which they have
in government.

17 Let not thine heart be envious against sinners: but let it be in the fear
of the Lord continually.
It seems well to young folks that they are wise enough, if they follow the
multitude, and seek to raise themselves up and be of value, in aduauncing
themselves, and working their own profit: although it be to the damage of
their neighbors: and so they are sinners, that is to say, having their hearts
infected and corrupted with malice and wickedness, and showing it in their
conversation with the which they are well pleased. And using themselves in this
sort they flourish and prosper in outward appearance, they have their desires,
and wishes and live at their ease: as it is seen, and has been alleged by
the scriptures. Contrariwise they which are wise indeed, and follow
righteousness, have often misery and calamities, whereby it comes to pass
that they are tempted too do as the foolish and wicked do, to have part of
their prosperity. But Solomon shows them, that if by the wisdom of the
heart they will speak of righteous things as belongs to them, they ought
not to obey such temptations, saying: Let not thy heart be envious against
sinners. Here Solomon teaches us in brief, that which David treats amply,
in the. 37. Psalm, wherein we have to note, that to be envious against
sinners, is, in regarding their temporal prosperity to be agreeued at our own
misery, and not to care what we do so we may attain to their ease and do
as we think they do. And so under this word of envy, or zeal, or
affection, we understand, that Solomon comprehends the prosperity of the
wicked, and signifies that they are happy according to the outward
appearance, for why one seldom enuieth the poor and miserable, neither
coueteth to be in their estate, but rather detesteth them, and flies their
company as much as is possible: For it seems that one shall come thither but
too soon. Also by this word Envy or affection, Solomon shows that he
speaks to them which are miserable according to the world: for they which
are at their ease, think not on other men's estates to desire them, except they
be insatiable gluttons, which know nothing what they ought to do. Note we
secondly, when he puts the fear of the Lord against euuie, or zeal, that
they which suffer themselves Prou. 16. 6.
to be carried away by such envy or affection, have no fear of the Lord: for
by the same they withdraw themselves from evil. And when one desires to
prosper as the wicked do, there is no evil whereto he gives not himself to
come to his desires. And when after having spoken here before of the wisdom
of the heart and speech of righteous things, he admonishes us to the fear of
Lord, he shows that if we do not fear the Lord, we are void and naked
of all wisdom and righteousness, and although it be necessary, and that
otherwise it cannot be, but the fear of the Lord is permanent, yet
nevertheless when Solomon adds, Continually, he says no superfluous thing,
but expounds to us more clearly the true nature of the fear of the fear of
the Lord, and shows us that if we fear the Lord truly we should
continue in wisdom and righteousness. And although according to the outward
appearance, sinners floorishe and prosper, and that miseries assail on al sides
them which fear God, as though they should perish without redemption, and
that there were no end of their calamities: Notwithstanding those which fear
the Lord have an hope, of the which they shall not be frustrate.

18 For surely there is an end, and thine hope shall not be cut off.
Albeit the sense be very true, that the calamities of the just men which fear
God shall have end, and that without al fault: as one may confirm it when
Solomon says, And thine hope shall not be cut off: Yet notwithstanding it is
no inconvenience to say that Solomon yields a reason why one should not envy
sinners, when he says,

For surely there is an end, etc. The cause why one is enuyous against
sinners, is because at al times he has seen them prosper and yet sees them:
and it seems that they shall do so still. But there will be an end, and that
shortly, as (Psalm. 37.) it is well declared unto us. Wheretoo Solomon accords
saying, For surely, etc. Which thing might well afray sinners, and make them
loose their courage, if they had any sense at all. For if there be (as it is
very true) an end of their prosperity, it follows that they perish without
redemption, seeing that all their endeavor is in that which is of no indurance.
And so the end shall be taken here, for deprivation of al prosperity: as also
one may understand it when Solomon puts the hope of the just a contrary to
the end and says:

That it shall not be cut off. When he attributes hope to him which fears
God, he shows that those which walk in doubt and distrust are nothing worth:
although they make a fair show of holiness and justice, as do those which
fear God by the commandments of men. He shows also that it is the common
use of them which fear God, to have afflictions: in that that hope is joined
Esa. 29. 13. Romans 5. 3. 4. and 8. 25. Iam. 1. 2. 3.
to patience which proceeds of tribulation. What afflictions then soever
happen us, let us be patient, And our hope shall not be cut off. For doing
so, we shall not be of the number of the wicked, which are threatened to be
cut down as the grass: but we shall be borne anewe of seed incorruptible,
which shall remain for Psalm. 37. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 23.
ever.

19 O thou my son, hear and be wise, and guide thine heart uprightly in the
way.
When our wisdom and understanding, consists not but in the word of God,
as has often been said, and as it has been Deuteronomy. 4. 6,
alleged: It is not without cause that Solomon inuiteth each one of us to
hear, desiring that by hearing we may become wise. And that we may be the more
careful to obey him, he is not content to say, Thou whosoever thou art, hear:
but, O thou my son, hear. In calling each one of us his son, he shows
his great charity toward us. And by the same he presses us to give him our
hearts, inclyning ourselves to follow, willingly his admonitions and
instructions. He shows also with what affection, Pastors and Ministers of
the Church ought to beled toward the Lords flock: which is that they bear
themselves as fathers toward their children so to lead them the more easily,
to the obedience of the word. As S. Paul likewise does it in many places. He
will, that having heard, we become wise: for he says,

And be wise, As he has admonished us heretofore. And afterward that by
this wisdom we do our duty as we ought to do. For he says, And guide
thy heart uprightly, etc. And so, we understand that the word is not
preached unto us, to live in negligence and idleness, but that by the same,
having learned to be wise, we may bring forth the fruits of wisdom, which
is to guide ourselves uprightly in this world, yielding God the honor which
he asks us by his law, and doing pleasure and service to our neighbors,
according as he commands us by the same, See here the way in the which we
ought uprightly to guide our hearts. Solomon speaks expressly of the guyding
of the heart: for if it be not well affectionate, all that we go about is
manifest wickedness: or if we do any thing which profits, we are led by
hypocrisy: And that which we do fairly before men is but abomination
before God, who beholds the hearts.

20 Keep not company with wine bibbers, nor with deuourers of flesh.
We desire naturally to have wherewith to maintain ourselves in good order in
this life, and to be clothed honestly. Such desire is not to be despised nor
blamed, when it is without avarice and agrees with that which Jesus Christ
teaches us, when he says that we should ask of God our father, that he
would give us this day our daily bread. Wherein as we are taught to fly
avarice, and not to eat the bread of others for nothing: so also we are
taught to content ourselves with a little nourishment and meats which are not
of an hye price nor curious dressing, and apparel, which is not sumptuous.
Wherefore let us neither be glutto^s, nor deintie mouths, nor drunkards, nor
covet the bankets and feasts of such persons, who are never at their ease, but
when they are bibbing and swallowing. Solomon warns us thereof saying, Keep
not company 1. Tim. 44. and 6. 17.
with wine bibbers, etc. He says not, keep not company with them which drink
wine and eat flesh. For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be
refused when it is taken with thanksgiving. And the living God gives us al
things abundantly to use. But he says,

With wine bibbers, etc. He will not that we be hoate nor hasty to fill
ourselves with wine and flesh, not considering wheretoo al things are created.
And shows how it is not meet that we should fill wine down our throtes,
as into a vessel which has a large mouth, nor that we devour meat like
hungry wolves: but that in sobriety and temperance we savor our flesh and
our wine, not so much to take our corporal delight thereof, as to acknowledge
the bounty and liberality, which our Lord God uses toward us, to give him
thanks for the same: as we are bounde^ theretoo, having nothing but by his
grace and mercy. Thus doing although in this world, we cannot choose, but
we must be amongst drunkardes and deuourers of flesh, yet nevertheless we
shall not be with them: for we shall not be partakers of their unfruitful
works of darkness. As Saint Paul tells us. Ephesians. 5. 119.
Note we besides, that there is gluttony, not only in eating too much,
either of Beef, Mutton, or foul, but also of fish: for that is flesh,
although it be not named so amongst the Papists. S. Paul is witness of it.
Wherefore the Papists are much abused, when to abstain from that which they
call flesh, they persuade themselves that they fast, and yet they fill themselves
once a day with fish and wine, so full as the belly will hold, so that they
have no appetite against 1. Cor. 15. 3.
evening* But it so much lacks that they fast and are sober, that they are
rather wine bibbers, and fleshly gluttons, whereby they deserve well to have that
poverty which Solomon threatens to them which are gluttons and drunkardes,
saying.

21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall be poor: and the too much sleeper
shall be clothed with rags.
Solomon gives us here the reason, for the which he will not have us to keep
company with wine bibbers, and in this reason he shows, that of drunkenness
and gluttony proceed poverty, the which we naturally do fear. Gluttons and
drunkardes merit it well, for they are not only spend thriftes, and
wealthwasters, but also they are slouthful, as Solomon marketh it, when he
adds here the too much sleeper whereof Solomon has blamed the slouthful, and
as he has threatened the slouthful of poverty, so does he Pro. 6. 9. 10 11.
now here, when he attributes rags to him that sleeps too much and if we
see not this happen before our eyes, yet let us know that they which continue
in drunkenness and sleeping, shall not escape Gods hand: for if they be not
reputed worthy of temporal goods, they are not capable of heavenly substance.

22 Hear thy father which begot thee: and despise not thy mother when she
waxes old.
Subjection is a very hard thing, and those which are most bounden to yield
obedience, fly from it as much as they can. There is no subjection nor
obedience which is more esteemed amongst men tha^ that of children toward
their fathers and mothers, but children have no care to do their duties, and
principally when their fathers and mothers be old, then the children which
covet to live at their own pleasure, persuade themselves that their fathers
and mothers are too severe and rigorous, or strive to make them believe that
they dote and are mad, and that they know not what they say or do. For this
cause they have great need to be still told of their duty, as Solomon
warns them thereof: and here again, saying,

Hear thy father, etc. Wherein he teaches children nothing but that which
they would should be done unto them, if they had children, as one may
perceive, when there are neither fathers nor mothers so young, which will not
be so honored of their children: It is meet therefore that children have
regard to do their duty to their parents, as Solomon exhorts them in this
verse. Although he attribute great authority to parents: first when he
says, Hear, In this he will that children hold their parents for masters
and true techers, and as bearing words in the name of Christ: for it is him of
whom the father says, Hear him. Also by this word Hear, he shows parents
in what schole they ought to study: that is, in the heavenly fathers school,
by the means of Jesus Christ: otherwise they can say nothing that their
children ought to hear. This is not to say notwithstanding, that fathers and
mothers ought to co^mande their children nothing which is not expressed word by
word in the scripture. It suffices that they command them nothing, wherein
they offend if they obey. Then children ought to hear and render to their
parents, the honor which God commands. It is that which the Apostle Saint
Paul commands, saying, In all things etc. And to the Ephesians, he
expounds what Col. 3. 20. Ephe. 6. 1
al these things are, ween he says, According to the Lord: for it behooves
us to obey father and mother in all that which is not contrary too the honor
and subection which we owe unto God. Secondly, he attributes authority,
when he says, thy father for seeing that God does this honor to men, which
are but his organs and instruments, to communicate his titles too them: it is
no reason that children should disdain them, or once enterprise to disobey
them: for their disobedieuce would not be against men, but against God. Also
fathers are taught too be the imitators of that only great father, which is
the father of bodies and souls: for he has created al, and has care over
al. Even so fathers ought to have care both of the bodies and souls of them
which God has given them. Thirdly, when he says, which begot thee, he
attributes great authority to fathers, for he puts them as it were in the
place of God, to whom only it belongs to bring forth children into the
world, making the mothers fruiteful, as Jacob proved it. And therefore when it
is said: which begot thee, let fathers and mothers, know that they are the
instruments and organs of God: and let children acknowledge, that they should
have been nothing, if God had not made their fathers and mothers fertile, and
that they have al by their means, for the which cause it is good reason, that
Genesis 30. 1. 2.
they yield themselves subjects and obedient to them: and that fathers be
careful over their own works, and let them not go to perdition for fault of
instruction, teaching, correction, and chastisement. But although under the
name of the father, we ought also to understand the mother (for the
commandment imports, honor thy father and mother:) yet nevertheless Solomon
knowing the world to be so depraved and bad, that men make no account of
their mothers, because they are women (as those children tell them, which have
no fear of God) he has made express mention of the mother, saying,

And despise not thy mother when she waxes old. Solomon knew that in an house
or family they made no account of mothers, when they brought no profit to the
house, which comes to pass, when for age they can do no handy work: for
this cause he makes express mention of their age, and will that in the same
one make as much account of mothers, as they did when they were strong and
lusty, and not to reject them as doting and old fools: as is the use of
wicked children, which seek but their own profit or pleasure. Such people
love not to see those which show them their faults and rebuke them: nor those
which serve them too no use, but to spend. Now as Solomon will not, that
principally in age, one should despise his mother, even so he covertly
admonishes mothers to govern themselves so well by the word of God in their
youth, that in their old age they be honorable before their children, insomuch
that they retain authority to command, and their children be they never so
old, fear their displeasure.

23 Buy truth, and sell it not, wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
Albeit this present sentence may be applied to al men because al men have
need to possess truth: as we are invited daily to the same by the preaching
of the Gospel: yet notwithstanding because the former sentence was spoken to
children, and also some which follow touch them (as we may see) it is very
requisite too say, that Solomon continues his purpose, and teaches children
that which they have to do in hearing their fathers: for although he speak
as it were commanding, yet nevertheless we may well say that he expresses
the desire which he has too have children profit.

Now seeing he commands, or desires that children should so well hear
their fathers, that thereby they should buy truth, wisdom, instruction, and
understanding, he shows that parents ought to be possessours of truth,
otherwise their children cannot buy it of them: for one cannot buy of any one
thing which he has not: he will therefore that parents be a good example to
their children, walking without fraud, injury and violence, and speaking
continually the truth. In this wise children may buy of them, that which
Solomon commands or desires here. But because children obtain commonly of
their parents each thing liberally, and without exchange, which is necessary
for them, it may be said that Solomon speaks improperly, when he says,
Buy. Seeing also that in all the world there is nothing which is sufficient to
exchange for truth, wisdom, instruction, and understanding. And when he
admonishes us to buy, it is as if he said: It behooves children to be
careful and diligent to learn of their parents to be true, wise, humble,
obedient, and well advised: and to refrain from al lying, fraud, deceit, and
cousonage: to renounce al vanity and folly, and to fly from al persuasions
which tend to pride and disobedience: and detest al folly and ignorance. Thus
doing, they shall buy, that is to say, they shall obtain truth, wisdom,
instruction, and understanding. Now as they which buy any lands or
inheritance for the most part determine to keep that which they buy, and will
in no case depart from it for fear of want: for we see it comes to pass
that they which sell their lands, do not live by the gain of their money, but
dispende it foolishly, or have it taken from them and lost: so Solomon will that
one keep truth, wisdom, instruction and understanding well, and not depart
from it, as he shows when he says, And sell it not. And so he will that
children persevere in the former virtues, not giving them over in any case: for
according to the custom of the world, he which sells, defeateth himself of
that which he sells, and another seaseth upon it. Mean while let us not
think that Solomon is against that we should make our neighbors partakers
of the gifts and graces, that God has bestowed upon us, either by the means
of our parents or by others: for in communicating them we disinherite not
ourselves, nor diminish them at al, but rather augment them: for the rest,
there are some which take this Romans 15. 27. 1. Cor. 9. 11. Gal. 6. 6. Mat. 10.
8. 1. Pet. 5. 2.
sentence generally, and by buiyng truth, they understand that one ought to
use liberality toward them which distribute spiritual things. And by not to
sell, they understand that doctors ought not to be given to gain, but to
teach freely.

24 The father of the righteous, in rejoicing, shall be glad: and he that has
begotten a wise child, shall have joy of him.
It is no inconvenience to say that Solomon in this sentence, and in the next,
entreats of that which in the 15. and 16. verses he has done, but in an
other manner of speaking. Repetition (as has been often said) is familiar in
the scripture, in the which the holy Ghost shows the great care which he has
over us, as is needful it should be so: for we make no great have to awake
ourselves, and study to do our duty by one only warning, it vanishes away
easily out of our understanding because we are vain and carnal, and by nature
enemies to justice and wisdom: and so we cannot rejoice ourselves in the
same, but in folly and iniquity, according Psalm. 51. 7 Romans 7. 14. Ephe. 2. 3.
as we are conceived and borne: David reknowledgeth it, and S. Paul makes
great complaint thereof. Now therefore seeing by nature, none is wise and
righteous: and it is very hard to come to it, when Solomon says, The father
of the righteous shall be glad, and he that has begotten, etc. he means not
that by their first and carnal birth, children be wise and righteous, as one
may gather it by diverse sentences of his Proverbs: but he shows first of
all to fathers, and mothers, that they ought greatly to love righteousness,
Pro. 12. 15.
and wisdom, and in the same to have al their delight, as well in living after
the same, as seeking to print them well in the hearts and minds of their
children, for if they take no pleasure to follow righteousness and wisdom,
and to obtain the same, and also too make their children partakers thereof by
sound doctrine, by good admonitions, corrections, and chastisements, they will
make no great account, to see them wise and righteous, nor cannot rejoice a
whit in the same: much less will they have that great joy which Solomon
requires of them, as he shows when he is not content to say simply, that
he shall be glad, but he doubleth the word, saying, In rejoicing shall be glad.
And yet again he repeateth it saying, He shall have joy of him.

Secondly, he shows children that they ought to be careful to take good
heed, to the honest manners and holy conversation, to the doctrine and
admonition of their fathers and mothers: and that they seek to mortify their
vain and foolish concupiscences, their carnal and disordinate affections, so
that by the good reformation of their hearts they may show in their lives and
conversation, righteousness and wisdom, and may study to give by this
means recreation to their fathers and mothers: So that (as Solomon requires
it) their parents in rejoicing may be glad. This is the duty of children to
strive to give such joy to their fathers and mothers. And also Saint Paul
gives them express admonition thereof.

25 Let thy father rejoice in thee, and thy mother: and she that bare thee, be
glad.
It is not meet therefore for children to say that they are too young to do
well, and be wise: for it is by wisdom that one rejoices his parents.
Contrariwise he brings but sorrow and sadness to his parents by folly.
Pro. 10. and 15. 20. Pro. 17. 21


26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes delight in my ways.
Wisdom warns us not only to take away al vanity and folly from our
hearts, but also renouncing ourselves to give al our whole affections to her,
for she says not, my friend, or my neighbor, but she says, my son,
showing us, seeing we are her children, that we should be wholly at her
commandment. For seeing we have our carnal fathers in reverence, shall we not
be much more subject to the father of the spirit? She says not, Draw near
thy heart to me, But, Give me thy heart. And so she will not that we be to
ourselves: for that which is given, is no more his which gives it. Wheretoo
agrees somewhat, that which our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us: If any man will
follow me, let him forsake himself, and follow me. To give our hearts well
to wisdom, it behooves us not to follow our own fantasies, and good
intentions, nor that our delight be in that which we think and imagine Hebr.
12. 9
of ourselves, and which we desire by nature, but that we take pleasure in
that which wisdom teaches us, and that her government Mat. 16. 24.
be our delight: as she admonishes us thereof, consequently, saying, And let
thine eyes delight, etc. Wherein we have as it were a repetition, or exposition
of giving the heart. For one can take no pleasure but there where his heart is.
It is meet therefore that we give ourselves to our God, having all our
delight in his word, to follow joyfully the way which it teaches us. This
doing, our eyes shall delight in the ways of wisdom. That is to say, that
our spirits and understanding, take great pleasure to understand that which
wisdom teaches, and also to think on it well, to conduct willingly al our
senses both exterior, and interior to the obedience of the word. That is it
which we ought to understand, when it is said to us, And thine eyes, etc. For
if one see the ways of wisdom but with corporal eyes, he cannot delight
therein: but it behooves our in ward eyes to see it, and regard it joyfully,
so that they may stir up the outward parts to give themselves thereto, and
that we be wholly both soul and body given to to the service of our God. Also
Solomon requires first of all the heart, and then the eyes: wherein he
comprehends all the man, the conduct of whom proceeds from the heart and
the eyes. Therefore as our celestial father is holy, and by good right
requires that his children be holy. So it is meet that fathers of this
world be of an holy conversation, to give good example to their children, to
the end to draw them to the like manner of living, and that in this sort they
possess the hearts of their children, which follow their steps not against
their will, but most willingly.

27 For a whore is as a deep ditch: and a strange woman as a narowe pit.
To give our hearts to wisdom, and delight in her ways, we have to
restrain ourselves from many sorts of wickednesses: the which are natural to
us because of our corruption and malice. Notwithstanding, Solomon inuiting us
to give our hearts to wisdom, seeks not at this present, but to restrain
us from whoredom and drunkenness, whereof whoredom proceeds, as hereafter
shall be seen. One may think that it is because the greatest part of the world
at al times has made no conscience, nor yet does not, to use whores, and be
drunk: or that of these two, proceed many other vices, yea almost al
wickedness. By whoredom and drunkenness one comes to ydolatrie, and to
blaspheme God, and despise al religion, one comes to rebel against his
parents and superiors, to kill, rob, lie, backbyte, bear false witness and
to ymagine and do other wickedness. Therefore to withdraw us from whoredom,
he compares the whorishe person, (whom Prou. 2. 16. and 5. 3. and 6. 24. and
7. 7. Psalm. 7. 16. and 57. 7. Esa. 24. 17. Iere. 18. 10. Mat. 15. 14.
also he calls a strange woman) to a deep ditch, out of the which one cannot
recover, when he is once fallen in. And also he compares her to a narrow pit,
wherein if a man fall and his head before, he cannot bow himself, to bring
his legs beneath, and lift up his head, but must of force be stiffled in the
water, and so perish. And so by such comparisons he shows us, that those
which haunt whoores destroy themselves. As he has showed it. heretofore:
where he treats amply of the ruin and destruction of whoremaisters, and
harlots. Wherefore it is no need to stay long thereon now, nor to tell why the
whore is called a strange woman, for it has been showed. Only note we, that
the Ditch, and Pit, are often taken in the scripture, for ruin and perdition.
Also Solomon compares the whoorishe person to a hunter, which lies in wait
for the beast to bring him into his snares, and kill him, when he says:

28 Also she lies in wait as for a pray: and she increases the
transgressors amongst men.
These Ambushments have been declared here above, where it is said, That a
woman hunteth for the precious life of a man: she is not content to lie in
wait for one man, but she allureth many Pro. 6. 26. and 7. 10.
to her: Not those which keep themselves firm and constant in verity and
loyalty, and will in no wise break the promise made to their lawful choice,
but those which fear not God, and make no account to lie, and deceive their
beloved. It is that, which Solomon means, when he says,

And increases the transgressors amongst men. That is to say, that they
which are of an evil faith, are easily allured to whoredom, be they men or
women. For that which is spoken of the whorishe woman, ought also to be
understood of the man given to whoredom, which suborneth and entiseth by
flatteries and lies, or other subtle, or violent means, many maids, and
wives, which are not of a good Faith and loyalty toward God and men. For the
rest, if we will understand these two sentences of spiritual whordome, which is
far more dangerous then the bodily: or at leastwise, take an admonition by
the same, to wit, that if it behooves us to be careful to fly from whoredom,
to give our hearts to our father, by a far more reason we ought to abhor
idolatry, which is a whoredom, not only dangerous, but also greatly
displeasant and abominable, before the eyes of our father, before his Angels,
and al his elected, which know the truth. We may take allegorically the
harlot, and strange woman, for the governors and heads of the people, which
have not the true religion: for such governors are well like to the deep ditch
and narowe pit: seeing they lead al those to perdition whom they govern in
superstition and idolatry, yea, what zeal or good intention soever be in the
leader, or in them which are led. For if the blind lead the blind, they
fall both into Mat. 13. 14.
the ditch. Of such whoremaisters and whores, the Papaltie is full. Likewise
there are in the same many hunters, which lie in wait, and lay ambushes for
the people, by false doctrine, and traditions of men and the Devil, and allure
to them great multitude of those which keep not faith and promise with their
Creator as they ought. It behooves us to be very wary to take heed of
such hunters, to the end we may be a chaste virgin to Christ. To do this same
well, we ought to hold the simplicity of the Gospel, and to refrain ourselves
from al other fair appearance of holiness and religion.

29 To whom is woe? To whom is sorrow? To whom is strife? To whom is
mourning? To whom are wounds without cause? and to whom is the redness of
the eyes.
Because we fear incommodities, and rejoice when al things come to our
wish, and yet nevertheless we cease not to sleep still in vices and
dissolutions, which are most commonly cause of the incommodities which we
fear, and are yrkesome to us: For this cause Solomon to waken us, and bring us
in mind to fly the dissolutio^s from the which this irksomeness proceeds,
uses many in terrogations, saying: To whom is woe? etc. And this is as though
he asked: who are they which merit by their excess and dissolutions, to have
so great incommodities and miseries, that they are constrained to cry out, we
are woe. Who are they, which come by good right to so much poverty, that they
cannot but have care and vexation, and that greatly? Who are they which come
justly to such brutishness, that they force neither of peace nor concord, but
stir up strife with every one? who are they which are constrained to groan,
and weep, and to shead many tears? who are they which seek to be wounded
for a thing of nothing, for the which they ought not to strive, but rather
leave off, seeing it brings no profit but hurt, for they receive stripes for
it? who are they which merit to have red eyes? Here Solomon makes mention of
many corporal and temporal incommodities and asks to whom they are proper,
who are they to whom they happen commonlyest, and who well deserve them: when
he makes such a demand, it is not for ignorance, but to awake us from sleep,
for he gives by and by after the answer saying.

30 Even to them that tarry long at the wine: and to them that go and seek
mixture.
Here he notes drunkardes, which love to sit long about the cup, and to
empty it often, and are careful or rather greedy and covetous to enquire out
tables where they fill out wine abundantly that they may drink excessiuely:
such prodigal distribution, or excess in drinking, is here called mixture.
Esaias uses the same word, rebuking the vntemperancie of drunkardes. Solomon
therefore answers Esaias. 5. 22.
that the miseries and incommodities aforesaid are well due to the drunkard.
And also we see them come to pass upon them oftentimes, and they are
grievously vexed. Wherefore to the end we may well give our heart to wisdom,
and shun the miseries aforesaid, we ought to obey this word of wisdom,
when she says to us:

31 Regard not thou the wine when it is red, and when it shows his color
in the cup, or goes down pleasantly.
He will not have us to resemble frank drinkers, which are not content to take
and drink wine with sobriety and temperance, and to delight therein moderately
(as to this end God has created wine and other drinks for man) but they give
themselves over wholly to drinking, and use therein great liberty, the which
they think to be delight, and place there affection wholly thereon: As they
show well, when they employ their time to consider of the color of the wine
in the cup, and stand a great while to taste and savor it, and let it go
down softly, and cannot be content but when they drink largely thereof.
Solomon shows us that such fashions are not good, when he bids, Regard
thou not, etc. This is not to say that the color of the wine should not be
good, or that it is ill done to see if the wine be white or red, if it be
clear or troubled: nor also that one does ill when he tastes his wine, to
the end to use it if it be good and neat, and to refuse it if it be
corrupted. But it is not meet to be so curious as the drunkardes are, which
have no other good but drink, as they well show, when they are so much given
theretoo. When they spend so much time in drinking, and drink so excessiuely,
they find it very sweet, and think that nothing is better then to drink
well. They persuade themselves, that in this manner they keep themselves well in
this life, and to live long there is nothing else to be done but to be merry:
and so they think not on the end, unless they persuade with themselves that
if they have lived at their ease to day, they shall be to morrow better: so that
one may put them in the number of those which say. Come I will bring wine, and
we will fill ourselves with Esa. 56. 12.
strong drink: and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.
Herein they are far deceived: for although the wine go down pleasantly,
and that they find it of a good taste, yet nevertheless when they use it not
soberly it is mortal poison: as Solomon pronounces it saying.

32 In the end thereof it will bite like a serpent: and hurt like a
Cockatrice.
He uses here two similitudes to signify one thing. And it is to affirm
the danger which is in wine, when one is given too much theretoo. And so he
imployeth himself to restrain us from drunkenness, and seeks to persuade
us that as the biting of a serpent, and hurt of a Cockatrice are venomous and
mortal: even so drunkardes by too much drinking poison themselves, and kill
themselves, yea more mortally then if they were so hurt with the Cockatrice:
for such hurting touches but the body: but the old serpent and that great
Dragon, which is the Devil, stingeth the souls of drunkardes, alluring them
by disordinate affection, to use wine excessiuely: and so obaying the Devil,
they are deprived of the kingdom of God, and by consequence, go to 1. Cor. 6.
10
death everlasting. And so let us know, that Solomon according to the manner of
the scripture, by corporal similitudes shows us in what danger the souls of
them are, which give themselves to drunkenness: Not that drink which is a
good creature of God, and very necessary, brings with it damage to the
soul: but that by disordinate concupiscence, man is hurt and bitten.
Afterward when concupiscence has conceived, she brings forth sin, and
sin being performed, engenders death.

33 Thine eyes shall look upon strange women, and thine heart shall speak leude
things.
He continues here the matter which he began with, of drunkardes, and so will
do til he come to the end of this Chapter. And in continuing, he shows
that of drunkenness, ensues whoredom and other mischiefs. Whoredom is
noted, when he says, Thine eyes shall look upon strange women, So that by
such loking, one comes to soil and pollute himself, as is seen by common
experience, and we have many examples thereof: as of the children of God, of
Sichem, of Judah, and Thamer, of the wife of Iosephes master, and of David and
Bethsabee. And though the effect follow not, yet such looks are notwithstanding
unchaste, and it is whoredom. The other mischiefs that follow drunkenness,
are marked, when he says, And thine heart shall speak lewd things. He
attributes pronunciation to the heart, because of the abundance of the
mischievous and wicked infection of the same, the mouth speaks Genesis 6. 2. and
34. 1. 2. and 38. 15. and 39 7. 2. Sam. 11. 2. Mat. 5. 28.
things infected and filthy, wicked and unjust: and the other members are
forced to do things contrary to al honesty, and religion justice, and
righteousness. Then seeing it is a very dangerous thing to give ones self to
whoredom and other mischiefs which proceed of drunkenness: It follows well,
that drunkenness is very perilous, as already has been seen: and yet
Solomon sets before us some danger, saying.

34 And thou shall be as he that sleeps in the heart of the sea, and as he
which sleeps in the top of the Mast.
To show the great danger wherein drunkards put themselves, he compares them
to those, which have no regard to the perils of the sea, nor think on them.
And although they be in the heatt, or midst of the sea, very far from the
shore, and likewise in the highest part of the ship, as in the top of the
Mast, exposed to the winds, yet nevertheless, through the little care that
they have, they let themselves fall a sleep: and so the tempest rising and
raging, hurleth them down easily without al remedy. So they which persevere,
and fall a sleep in drunkenness, fall and perish not in the depth of the sea,
but in the gulphe of hell: for they are deprived of the kingdom of God. And in
tarying til such destruction happen them, they are tossed with many
mischiefs: to the which they have no regard as they ought, and think not
that thee do betide them for their drunkenness, so dull and blockish they are
made by overmuch drink. Whereto they are so much addicted, that what evil
soever they endure, yet they purpose no way to abstain, but rather to persevere
in excessive drinking. Solomon sets forth such blockishnesse and lewd
affection, when he says,

35 Then shall thou say, They have stricken me, but I was not sick: They have
beaten me, and I have not felt it: when I shall awake, I will put my self
forth, and seek it still.
Although we add here, Then shall thou say, To declare that it is a
drunkardes talk to say, They have stricken me, etc. Yet nevertheless, Solomon
expounds to us here, rather the disposition and affection of drunkardes,
then these words. They are so transposed by the wine, that they fall asleep so
soundly and so deeply, that although one thumpe them, toss them, and torment
them with great blowrs, or though they fall from high, yet they have no hurt
thereby, nor feel nothing. They are so given to drink excessiuely, that
although they perceive well that the wine has done them hurt, yet nevertheless
as soon as they are again awake, they go to seek out good drink, and to
drink again. And feeling themselves ill at ease with the wine which they have
drunk the day before, to heal themselves they say that they must have a hear
of the same dog which bit them. In this we may see that drunkards are less
sensible then brute beast, for although they sleep, yet one can come never so
little near them but they perceive him: then much more will they feel him
that touches them any way. One may see also that they are less reasonable:
for beasts will neither touch Ose. 4. 11. Esai. 5. 11 Luke 21. 34 Romans 13. 13
Ephe. 5. 18 1. These. 5. 6
meat nor drink, which they perceive to be hurtful for them But whoordome,
wine, and must, take away their hearts. Such drunkardes are well worthy of
curses. And so it is not without cause that we have many admonitions, by the
which we are taught to follow sobriety, and fly gluttony and drunkenness.

The xxiiii. Chapter.
1 BE not thou envious against euel men, neither desire to be with them.
IT is a temptation which greatly presses the feeble and weak, to desire the
estate and condition of the wicked, when the poor faithful see themselves in
affliction, and to be as it were a despising and mocking stock of men, and as
the filth and skumme of the world. And therefore they have great need to be
often admonished to be patient: as also the holy Ghost is very careful to
do it in many places of the scripture, as has been alleged heretofore: and
it is not yet long ago since this matter was treated of. Yet notwithstanding
Pro. 23. 17.
for all this, Solomon knowing that we have great need to be awaked, and
restrained from such temptation, lets not to admonish us of the same,
saying, Be not thou envious, etc. Those which he called sinners, he now
calls according to the manner of his speech, men of malice, or evil men.
Wherein one may see, that the sinners of whom he has spoken, are not those
which sin by ignorance or infirmity, or by lightness and unadvisedness, but
which of set purpose give themselves to do evil, and are so attached with
wickedness, that al their delight is therein, we must not be envious against
such men, nor desire to have alliance or fellowship with them: but rather
flying them as a deadly pestilence, it behooves us to have our hearts set on
the fear of the Lord all the day long, and by the same, to be content with our
estate, be it poor, or be it rich, happy or miserable. If such sinners and
men of malice, or wicked men, have temporal prosperity, it is not of a good
and just getting, but rather by rauine, and outrage: because they have payned
and molested their neighbors, by wrongful ways, as by frauds, usury, theft,
process, and by other unlawful means. Solomon expresses it briefly, when he
says:

2 For their heart imagines rauine, and their lips speak molestation.
Because the faithful ought to love justice and benignity, (and indeed if we
be true faithfulles, we will continually meditate justice and benignity,
whereto our words and our works shall be conformable, and we will hate the
contrary, and fly from it.) For this cause Solomon yelding us a reason, why
we should not be envious against evil men, nor keep company with them,
attributes to them an heart infected with evil thoughts, and wicked
affections, when he says,

That their heart imagines rauine. And as they think wickedly, so they
execute it, as Solomon signifies by the words of the lips, saying,

And their lips speak molestation. For as the wicked speak in wronging and
threatening the innocent, so also they are ardent to pursue and put in practice
their wicked thoughts and determinations, and their threatenings, if they meet
with no lets which keep them from it. If having regard to this reason, we be
not careful to participate of the prosperity of the wicked, nor make no
account of their familiarity and acquaintance, but fly from them, giving
ourselves to meditate the law of God, for to follow it, and continue in the
same, we are blessed, and our prosperity shall be of long Psalm. 1. 3.
continuance, whereas that of the wicked shall pass away lightly. This is
amply expressed throughout all the 37. Psalm. When wicked men imagine rauine,
and molest others, they think to advance themselves, and it seems them, that
by this means they shall make a good house, and heap great riches together,
which shall be worth much to them, whereby they shall have their pleasures and
delights. But they are much deceived, as the foresaid Psalms show it, and
as was seen by experience at the flood, and in Sodom and Gomorra, in the land
of Canaan, and in Babylon. And one sees also (if he have the patience to look
on it) that not only the goods of the wicked perish, but also they themselves
vade and vanishe away. Wherefore if we will have goods which shall tarry by us,
and a house well builded, firm and stable, we ought to restrain al our senses
from folly and wickedness, and give ourselves wholly to think and follow
that, which God teaches us by his word, which is our wisdom and
understanding. Thus doing, we shall prosper in houses, and wealth, which
shall be of great value and pleasure, for as Solomon says consequently,

3 The house shall be built by wisdom, and established by prudence. 4 And by
science shall the chambers be filled, with all riches precious, and pleasant.
For from the beginning God has made al by wisdom, and continues to govern
and guide, and also to establishe al things Pro. 3. 19. 20 and 8. 14. 28. 2.
Sam. 7. 11. Psalm. 127. 1 Deuteronomy. 28. 30 31. 32.
by the same. This was well given to understand, by the Prophet Nathan to
David, saying, And the Lord shows thee that the Lord will build thee an
house. Also David has well understood it, as has been clearly showed. Moses
gave this well to understand to the children of Israel, when he pronounces
the blessings of the Lord upon the obedient, and curses upon the rebels,
and amongst other places, when he says, Thou shall build a house, etc. It
behooves us therefore, to give ourselves to wisdom by the obedience of the
word. And when we have goods, not to attribute them to our own industry and
wisdom, nor to our own deserts. For as we can not merit that God may give
us wisdom, so can we not deserve that which comes thereby. Whereupon
ensues, that we have to acknowledge that al comes from the liberality of
our father, and for the same, give him continual thanks.

5 The wise man is mighty, and the man of knowledge fortifieth his virtue.
It seems that the fools and wicked which are given to rauine and
molestation, are mighty and strong, because that according to outward
appearance, they do what they will, and have such authority, that there is
none which can nor dare resist them. And contrariwise, it seems that there
are no kind of people so weak, nor so miserable and abject as the good and
wise are. As they themselves are tempted, to think also when they regard not
but that which is present before their corporal eyes. But withdrawing ourselves
from such regard, which is false and deceivable, we ought to believe in the
spirit of al truth, which speaks to us by Solomon and says,

The wise man. etc. And so he teaches us that we ought not to constitute our
power and might in things which are present unto us corporally, but in the
wisdom and knowledge which we learn by the word. For also Solomon says
not the man simply, who of himself can not be strong and fortified: But the
wise man, and the man of knowledge. As if he said, It is by wisdom and
knowledge, that a man is strong, and increases more and more in force: not
bodily force which is a very small thing, but force of the spirit, which
consists in constancy and patience, which surmounteth al mundane force, and
escapes the dangers wherein the strong men of the world perish. This same
was seen at al times in Noe, and the Giants which were of his time, in Moses,
and Pharao: In Joseph, and his maistresse: In Daniel, and his enuyers: In David
and Saul, and in many others: as in the Prophets and their enemies: the
Apostles, and their persecuters: and now in the poor faithful, and their
adversaries, which are the great sages of the world: as the Pope, and his
Supposts, Kings, and their flatterers, and tormenters.

Wherefore we ought to understand that we should not aspire to the puisance
and force of this world, which makes a man proud: and so of force he must
perish, seeing he has God for party against him: but being feeble and abject
according to the world we ought to fortify ourselves in humility of
spirit, and then we shall have the Almighty on our side.

6 For thou shall make war by good advise: and safeguard is in the multitude
of counselors.
It is very needful for a man to be wise and skilful: otherwise if war rise
against him, he has no power or force which is worth any thing. For as we
have seen, power is in the wise man, and force in the skilful: without
wisdom a man is not well advised, and despises al good counsel that one can
give him. And so, as he is without power and force: even so he knows not on
what side to turn him to fight with his enemy and overcome him, or put him to
flight, and keep him that he hurt him not. But if a man by the conduct of
wisdom and prudence, advise warily and nearly that which he has to do, and
seek to have the opinion of men of good counsel, if war arise, or he must
begin it, he shall know how to guide it, as Solomon says,

For thou shall make war by good advise. And obtain victory, as Solomon
signifies, saying, And sauegard, etc. Abraham was a stranger in the land of
Canaan, and had no great might, according to outward appearance, and yet he
made war by good advise against four Kings. Moses, Joshua, and some of the
Judges and Kings of Judah have made war, by good advise, to wit, according to
the Genesis 14. 14
commandment of the Lord: and have not only escaped dangers, but also
obtained victory. Wherein we ought to learn, that if by the word of the
Lord, we print in our hearts his fear, which is the beginning, or principal
point of wisdom: if it chance that we must go forth to battle, we shall
handle it well. And although we perish, or die in the pursuit, yet
nevertheless we stick not to obtain victory over our enemies: the which
Solomon calls safeguard: for our fooes obtain not that against us which they
pretend: seeing we perish not for ever as they desire, but our souls are in
consolation, and our bodies rest for a season in the dust, I say namely if it
chance that they must go out in battle, for it would not be good advise nor
counsel, if by ambition or covetousness to reign and enlarge our limits, or
for desire of revenge, we make war as do the great men of this world,
which have no true knowledge of God, and make no account to learn him by his
word. In the same only one finds good advise, and it is made common to us by
multitude of counselors, as Moses, David, Solomon, the Prophets, Jesus Christ
and his Apostles, and also the great number of faithful ministers and teachers
of the truth. If we will believe them, we shal-be wise, and men of knowledge, we
shall have power and force, and by good advise shall make war when it shall be
needful, and not otherwise. And yet before we insinuate ourselves therein, we
shal-bee careful to restrain it: and as much as is possible and lawefull, we
shall search the ways of peace. As Saint Paul admonishes us. If superior
powers do not govern and guide themselves, there is no good advise, and by
consequence, no safegarde, Romans 12. 18.
but destruction: for where no knowledge is, the people falls. And if by good
advise and counsel we must make temporal Prou. 11. 14.
and bodily war, by a further reason, when we have strong, subtle, malicious,
and cruel enemies, which are hurtful to us, and seek to suppress us, to make
war against them, we have need of wisdom and skill, of power and force
fortified with good advise and counsels. For this cause Saint Paul seeks well
to munite us, as appertains, speaking of the preaching of the Gospel, wherein
Christ is communicated, saying, That he teaches every man in all wisdom, to
the end, to make every man perfect in Jesus Christ. We are also admonished to
enterprise nothing rashly, but as it were Ephe. 6. 10. Col. 1. 28.
Organs or instruments of our God, we permit that he finishe his work.

7 Wisdom is haughty to the fool: wherefore he shall not open his mouth at
the gate.
There is not so wicked a man in the world which seeks not to persuade
himself that he is an honest man, and there is none so foolish, which
esteems not himself wise: and yet nevertheless they are al naked of
wisdom, neither will they, nor can they attain thereto: for they are carnal,
and she is spiritual: they are earthly, yea hellishe, and she is heavenly, yea,
above the heavens, and there is none that can be partaker of her, but by the
word of God, the which is despised and rejected by fools, and they have no
understanding thereof. This highness is signified to us, when Solomon says,
Wisdom is haughty, etc. Wherein he approaches to that which David says,
Thy judgments are far from his presence, O Psalm. 10. 5. and 92. 6. 7. Deuteronomy.
30. 11.
Lord, for thy lips are great: and thy thoughts very deep, etc. But it
seems to withstand that which Moses says, That commandment which I
command thee to day, is not hid from thee, neither is it far of, etc. For
Moses speaks to the people of Israel, whom he rebukes of corruption,
frowardness, and folly. The answer is: That Moses in the first place
speaks properly to them which yield themselves easy to be taught, although
his word be addressed to all the people. This is notorious by the promise, The
Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy successors, etc.
the which appertains not, but to the faithful and obedient: as it behooves
us well to understand for the wicked and obstinate are uncircumcised according
as the scripture calls Iere. 9. 25. Eze. 44. 7. Act. 7. 15.
them. In that then, that one has a circumcized heart, he yeldeth himself
obedient to the Lord, and his doctrine is easily found, and not otherwise.
Also although that in the second place he address his speech to all the
people, reproouing them as is said, yet notwithstanding the reprehension or
blame is laid properly against the stubborn and incorrigible, amongst whom
were mingled the humble and obedient: and so they were somewhat polluted, and
blotted with the vice of the stubborn: not that God imputed it to them.
Although therefore that the word of God, which is our true wisdom and
understanding, is near to them which yield themselves easy to be taught, yet
she lets not to be haughty to the fool. And therefore he cannot devise
of her, nor talk of her amongst men that are honest, nor in assemblies: but
babbling much of vain things and wicked, amongst his commapions, he is
dumb amongst the wise, for he can speak nothing which they allow of.
Solomon gives it well to understand, saying, Wherefore he shall not open, etc.
In old time men made assemblies at the gate, and held there the seat of
justice, and the Prophets went thither to pronounce that which God commanded
them. And when by nature we are al fools, and are never made so wise, but
there is left in us many relikes of folly, we ought not to presume to think
that we are fit to comprehend the wisdom of God in perfection: Iere. 17. 19.
but having it in great admiration, we have to hold our peace, and acknowledge
our imbecillitie with Saint Paul, O the deepenes of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
ways past finding out? Romans 11. 33.
etc.

8 They shall call him an imaginer of mischief, which thinks to do evil.
We will not that men have an evil opinion of us, nor that they speak evil of
us: and therefore they which are malicious, and practice to molest the
innocent, or they which weigh it not, manifest not themselves incontinently
what they are, for fear lest they should be let to execute their
enterprises: But think and determine a certain time, that they may
afterward put their counsels in effect: and to do this same, they use
crafts and suttleties, by the which they think to persuade that they are
honest men, what evil soever they do: but their fruits by succession of time,
discover them, and by the same, they show themselves to be imaginers of
mischiefs. And therefore they deserve well that one call them so, for such is
their name, as Solomon pronounces, saying. They shall call him an imaginer of
mischief. When it is so, that man sees but the face, he can not call him
imaginer of mischief, which has but a certain light thought in his heart,
and puts it not in execution. And therefore know we, that Solomon speaks
here of thoughts, which are so associate with counsels, determinations,
affections, and wills, that one can not, nor will not forbid to put them in
effect. Whereupon also, he deserves to be called an imaginer of malice, as
he manifests himself to be: although he strive by certain fair words to
give to understand the contrary: but God discovers them, and shows their
hypocrisy and malice, mawgre their hearts. For although that willingly they
commit evil, yea manifestly, yet nevertheless they would, that men should
know nothing thereof. For if one call them by their name, they crave straight,
that their honor may be repaired, and that he may make them a large amends:
or else they are ready to maintain, and defend their honor by injuries and
outrages, by violence, and oppression. And so against their consciences, they
revenge themselves wrongfully against them that say the truth.

9 The thought of a foolish person is sin: and the mocker is in abomination
with men.
We are naturally framed in such sort, that we persuade ourselves, and will
have other men to think that we are wise and good. And therefore we please
ourselves in our own counsels and determinations, in our affections and
wills, and make great account of the thoughts of our hearts, as if they were
good and righteous. But seeing we are fools, and despise wisdom and
instruction, and do utterly hate knowledge, rejecting al counsel, and
correction, it is impossible that our thoughts should be such as we esteem
them to be, but of force they must be altogether struck naught, what good
intent or meaning soever we have. Solomon pronounces it thus, saying,

The thought of a foolish person, is sin. Whereupon ensues, that of
ourselves we cannot be acceptable to God, whom sin displeases, be it
never so hidden. And so what fair show soever we make before men, yet are we
abominable before God: and it is very hard, yea impossible, that by
succession of time, in continuing in folly, our spirit become not so proud
and malicious, that we cannot endure to have any man reform us, but take
pleasure to resist openly al discipline and correction. In this manner we shall be
also abominable before men, as Solomon pronounces it, saying,

And the mocker is in abomination with men. When he speaks so, he shows
principally the lesson to them which have the sword in hand, and tells them
that they ought to punish the mockers and contemners of al religion, which are
past correction. And afterward he shows the common people, that they shall
take heed of such men, and fly them as an evident plague, and likewise
procure to have them rooted out, to the end they corrupt not others. Otherwise
if we spare them, we make Solomon a liar, as much as we can, for we have them
not in abomination: and so we are not men, but beasts without reason, and
without zeal toward God, and his religion, and without pity and compassion
toward the simple and ignorant, who may be easily corrupted by such mockers.

10 Art thou negligent in the day of tribulation? thy virtue is feeble.
We have always good courage when we have none to resist us, and when we are
at our ease, and al things happen to our wish, and we dare well vaunt
ourselves that we are strong and valiant, and we dare also promise ourselves,
when we are far enough off from the blows, that there is no adversity so
great, which can break or abase our virtue, so that we shall not pursue our
enterprises manfully. But as experience shows it, man braggeth of that which
he cannot be: Behold the children of Israel in the desert of Sinai. Answer,
That having good courage, we will do all that which the Lord has commanded.
But afterward, when they had not the things that they desired, they lost
their courage, and murmured. When S. Peter saw not the army against Jesus
Christ, he seemed to be very valiant: but seeing the stir that they kept
Exo. 19. 8.
afterward he lost courage, and denied his master: Those which do the
like, show well that they are diminished of virtue, as also Solomon pronounces
it, saying,

Art thou negligent, etc? For they which are virtuous indeed, have care to
maintain themselves, what tribulation soever they have. To do this well, it is
necessary that we know certainly that al things come to pass, not by chance,
nor by the will of any creature, be it heavenly, earthly, or infernal, but by
the eternal providence of God, which is immutable, be we certain and assured
that he loves us, and therefore what tribulation soever happen to 1. Cor. 10.
13
us, be it never so grievous, yet he will not forsake us, but will apply al his
power to defend our cause: for he is faithful, and will not suffer us to be
tempted above that we be able, etc. Also to keep well that our virtue wax
not feeble, let us not tarry too meditate these things until the trouble be
come upon us, but let us watch at al times, foreseeing calamities, as Jesus
Christ admonishes us Mat. 24. 42. Mar. 13. 33. Ephe. 6. 10.
thereof, and arm ourselves with the harness of God, as S* Paul bids us.

11 Deliver them that are drawn to death: and will thou not preserve them that
are led to be slame?
God has given many commandments by the which he shows Genesis 9. 6. Deuteronomy. 24.
14
that he will that the wicked be not spared, but that they be put to death.
Then since that the commandments of God be such, Exodus 21. 12 Number. 35. 16
Deuteronomy. 13. 8. Romans 13. 1.
it follows that we ought to obey them, and that we should in no case let
them to be executed. And likewise he has ordained superior powers to be his
ministers, and show vengeance and ire upon them which do evil. And they which
resist this, resist the ordinance of God. Wherefore it might seem at the first
show that Solomon repugned the law and the ordinance of God, when he says,

Deliver them that are drawn to death, etc. The answer is that as God will
yield death to the wicked and that the magistrates punish them, yea with death
if the case require it: Even so he will that one have pity of the innocent,
and that we suffer none to do them violence, but deliver them from the hands
of those that oppress them and vex them: this is first the office of them
which are placed in pre-eminence, and hold the seat of justice. Moses
understood it well as one may see it by the Sermon of Saint Stephen, and
therefore he smote the Egyptian. Also the Lord raised up to the people of
Israel many judges, for to deliver and save the^ Act. 7. 23. Exodus 2. 11. 12.
Psa. 82. 2. Esaias. 1. 23.
from the hands of those, which molested and vexed them, as one may see by the
book of Judges. And God shows Judges well that such is their office, when he
reprehendeth them for the favor that they bear to the wicked, and commands
them to do right to the miserable, and Orphan, etc. It is secondly the office
of every one of us, in as much as he can, not usurping the authority of the
Magistrate, or resisting him, which turns to a scandale, and evil example. It
is also to every one of us that God speaks. Wash yourselues then, be ye
clean, take away the evil of your works, from before mine eyes, etc. Do
justice and judgment, and deliver Esaias. 1. 16. Iere. 22. 3.
him which is oppressed, from the hands of him which wrongeth him. But it is
chiefly the office of Magistrates, which are placed in the seat of God, who
attributes to himself this office of delivering. Also the scripture calls
him the only Savior, and by good right: for they which deliver their
neighbors from oppression, are Genesis 15. 13. 14. Psa. 50. 15. Esa. 49. 25. 26.
but the Organs, and instruments of this great Savior, who does this honor to
his creatures, to constitute the^ in his place: meanewhile (as it is said
(every one of us ought to apply himself to aid the oppressed not going above,
nor against the magistrate, no although he exercise tyranny, David showed it
well, when he suffered not that they should trouble Saul, which was a wicked
man, and would not himself trouble him, although he were the anointed of
the Lord. Jesus Christ also shows it well to Saint Peter. Notwithstanding 1.
Sam. 24. and. 26. Math. 26. 52.
this is not to say that one should not resist and stand against unjust and
cruel magistrates, but then the swoorde that they should use must be
spiritual, to wit, the word of God, which the Prophets and Apostles used in
admonishing, reprehending and threatening by the same those kings and princes
of the earth, which were wicked and cruel: this is the way that they should
use which are not in authority to deliver those which are drawn to death.

12 If thou say, behold, we knew not of it: he that pondereth the hearts,
does not he understand it? and he that keeps thy soul, knows he it
not? and will not he also recompense every one according to his works?
Saint Paul warns us that we should not every one regard the things which
are our own, but also those which are other men's, and complains greatly that
al men seek the things that are Phi. 2. 4. 21.
their own, and not those of Jesus Christ. which complaint may be uttered
almost to al kings, princes, and magistrates of the earth which are led by
ambition, and care not but to make themselves great, and make no account to
minister true justice, they force not if the innocent, the poor and feeble,
be oppressed. For although the wrong which men do to the innocent be well
known unto them, and that the brute thereof be spread al abroad, yet
nevertheless as though they were blind, and deaf, they make semblant to know
nothing thereof, if one come not and make great plaints to the^, and furnish
the^ out with money to make information of that which they know well enough.
And yet to favor the wicked the more, they will not inform themselves as they
ought. They which can speak of it best, and which would tell the truth shall not
be heard, nor they will not examine them, and yet they will be so impudent Liars
that they will say, we have inquired diligently, but we cannot find it so as
they report it, they may well make excuses before men, to appear honest: but
that will serve them but for more condemnation before God, who knows al, and
can well at time convenient render each one his hyre. Therefore let no man make
himself blind nor deaf: but let every one according to his power deliver his
neighbor from the violence, and oppression which is done to him, and let us
not seek to find excuses, when we have not done our duties as we ought:
for it is not good that we should strive to deceive God with our falsehood, no
although it could be, yet we should not will it. Solomon tells us that we
should not make excuses when he says,

If thou say, behold, we knew not of it. This is as though he said, thou
shall not say, we have not known this same. And by and by he shows us by
three reasons that we ought not to use such excuse, and that it will serve us
to no purpose. And to give these three reasons he makes three interrogations,
the first is, He that pondereth the hearts, does not he understand it? He
speaks here briefly, but it is conformable to that which is treated more at
length else where. It is therefore a frivolous excuse to say that they know not
the violence and oppression which their neighbor endures, when Psa. 94. 5. 11
Esaias. 29. 15. Pro. 16. 2. and 21. 2.
they know it, and are bounden to know it. If men receive such excuse, yet
God, which pearceth the hearts and tries them, and discerns the thoughts
and affections be they never so deep, understands well that such excuse is
wicked. And so he argues by the knowledge of God, which is certain and
infallible, and whereto nothing is hid, be it never so secret, wherefore it is
not meet to think that we can deceive him, neither ought we to will it, though
it were in our power, but we should honor it, and have it in admiration, as
David admonishes us. And we ought to keep ourselves Psalm. 139. 6. and 73. 11.
well from saying as the wicked do, How does God know it? and, there is no
knowledge in the Lord. Solomon by this first reason signifies that they which
say that they have not known the violence and wrong which is done to their
neighbors, speak in their hearts as these wicked do. And so they attribute
ignorance to God, and by consequence deny that he is God. The second reason
is, And he that keeps thy soul, etc. It is not a thing which we ought to be
certain of, that God has care over his creatures, and likewise he keeps
the wicked, otherwise they would be soon destroyed, for the Devil seeks but
the destruction of men, and soon takes and deuoureth that which God has
done withal. And therefore the holy Scripture attributes to the Lord the
title of keeper, and savior: as also it is good reason: for there is none
other but he: Then seeing it is so that God is the keeper of souls, it
follows, that there are neither thoughts nor affections in the same souls,
but he knows them well: as also Solomon notes it when he asks saying.

Knows he it not? as if he said one ought in no wise too doubt that God
which keeps the souls, knows not those excuses of the^ which say, that
they have not known the affliction of their neighbors to be frivolous and
vain leasings. He dispoileth them therefore of excuse, and also taxes them
of ingratitude toward God. For seeing that God which keeps their souls,
reco^mendeth to them the souls of their neighbors, they acknowledge not well
the grace that God has done them, when they are not careful to deliver their
poor neighbors, as the Lord demands it, and not content heerewith they lie,
not only to men, but also to God, as Solomon signifies it by the present
interrogatio^. But to the end that we be not abused thinking that Solomon
speaks here of a perpetual keeping: know we that often God keeps the
wicked temporally, for the health and prosperity of his elect, as one may see
by the kings of the Persians and Medians, which were idolaters and infidels,
and by their hands God has given deliverance to his Tim. 8. 1.
people of Israel: And Saint Paul will that we pray for such men, mean while
if they remain obstinate, everlasting destruction is prepared for them, and
they are kept for the same. The third reason is, and will not he also
recompense? etc. In the first, and in the second reason, he argues by the
diligence and care of the Lord, and also by his knowledge and goodness: and
now in this third reason Romans 2. 5.
he argues by the same things: for if God were ignorant and negligent, and
if he were slouthful and il willing, be could not recompense every one
according to his works. Nevertheless he argues principally by his justice,
for it is the office of a judge to do right to every one, rewarding each one
according as he knows him to have done, punishing the wicked, and
preserving the good not that the good, be they never so good, may merit that
God may benefit them, but of his pure grace and liberality, and mercy, he
accepts their works, although they be imperfect, and rewards them
according to his free promises, and according to his eternal election. But to
the wicked which are obstinate and hard hearted, he rendereth them the hyre
which they have deserved, overthrowing them in his ire and vengeance. Let them
therefore that seem not to see the oppression which is wrought too their
neighbors, not look to escape unpunished. And if we ought to be careful to
preserve the temporal life of our neighbors, by far more reason we ought to
be diligent to deliver them from death and damnation eternal as much as in us
lies, which thing we shall do by sound doctrine, warnings, exhortations,
corrections, threatenings and chastisements.

13 My son eat honey, for it is good: and the honey comb is sweet to thy
mouth.
It is a thing notorious and well known by experience that honey is good, and
the honey comb very sweet in taste. Also the holy scripture, being willing to
draw us to take the taste and savor of spiritual things, as in the word of
God, (which is our true wisdom and understanding) compares them to honey, and
to the honey comb, notwithstanding preferring the spiritual before the
terrestrial, as is very good reason. Also now when Solomon says,

My son, eat honey, etc: It is not to command us or admonish us to eat honey
sooner then other good meats: for he has not written his sentences for the
care that he had of our bodies: but his intent was to instruct our spirits and
our understanding. And therefore note we that he speaks so, to make a
comparison, the which he adds consequently, when he says.

14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul, if thou find it?
and there shall be an end, and thine hope, shall not be cut of.
To prove and try the goodness and sweetness of wisdom, and to have joy
thereof, it is not enough to have the knowledge of it. Solomon shows it well,
when he is not content to say, that the knowledge of wisdom shall be sweet and
good to the soul as honey: but he adds a condition saying, If thou find it,
etc. To enjoy therefore the goodness and sweetness of wisdom, it behooves us to
find her. And for to find her: it behooves us to search her diligently: as
Solomon warns us thereof heretofore. And he has declared the Prou. 2. 1. and
3. 13.
goodness and sweetness of her. But one may say that those which are wise after
God, and after his word, are ordinarily evil handled, and endure many vexations
and molestations. For this cause it may seem that there is no goodness nor
sweetness in wisdom, but rather bitterness. Answer. Solomon attributing
goodness and sweetness to wisdom, exempteth not the wise from afflictions and
miseries: but he shows that they should not be grieved thereat, but bear it
out patiently, for they shall be of no long indurance. He signifies it when he
says, and there shall be an end, etc. Now that he means the end of
tribulations, he shows it well when he adds, And thine hope shall not be cut
off. For hope is linked to patience, the which proceeds of tribulation. We
glorify ourselves in tribulation, knowing that tribulation ingendreth
patience, and patience experience, and experience hope. If we hope for that
which we see not, we look for it by patience. Although therefore that the wise
because of their wisdom, endure outwardly great evils and bitter: yet
nevertheless Romans 5. 3. 4. and 8. 25.
they stick not to feel the goodness and sweetness of wisdom: for hoping that
their tribulations shall be of no long endura^ce, and that finally by wisdom
they shall obtain great reward they rejoice themselves, according as Jesus
Christ bids the^. Wherefore Mat. 5. 10. 11. 12. Iam. 1. 1. 12.
being truly instructed in the word of the Lord, which is the true wisdom,
let us say with S. Paul, We will not faint: but although our outward man be
corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day, etc. And to say so
truly, let us take heed to 2. Cor. 4. 16. Prou. 23. 17. 18.
will to flee afflictions, in following wickedness: according as Solomon
warns us thereof, making us the same promise that he now does. Note we
moreover that it is not without cause that I have said, that for to try the
goodness and sweetness of wisdom, and to enjoy the same, it is not enough
to have knowledge thereof, if we do not find it. For many are lightened with
the knowledge of truth, which is the true wisdom (as are they which receive
the seed, by the hye way, or in stony places, or amongst thorns) and yet
nevertheless they find not wisdom, neither yet prove of what goodness or
sweetness she is: but after such knowledge they are in worse estate then
before. Such men have had the knowledge of wisdom, but they have not found
her, because they have not set their mind and affection thereon: which it
behooves them to do that will find her, and have the true joy of her
goodness and sweetness. Wherein we may understand that it is not enough to
be illuminate with the knowledge of truth: but that we ought to be
regenerate and made new creatures to walk in newness of life. Behold, Judas
the traitor knew the truth, but he was not regenerate: and therefore Mat. 12.
43. 2. Pet. 2. 20. Prou. 2. 3.
he has not found wisdom, neither did he enjoy her goodness, and
sweetness.

15 Lay no wait as a wicked man, against the house of the righteous: and
spoil not his resting place.
As the wicked are never in peace, first in their consciences: Secondly,
without, because they have not such prosperity as they desire: even so, as much
as is possible for them: they put the good and just to trouble, wast and
destruction. And to do this same, they have crafts and cautels, subtle ways
and fetches, outrageous and violent, ungodly, and cruel. Solomon signifies the
crafts that they go about by laying of wait, and the outrages, and violences,
by spoiling when he says.

Lay no wait as a wicked man, etc. Wherein we have to note that we esteem
that, which is gathered together in the house or resting place, to be in
surety, and commonly there is that which is best and most precious. Also we
ourselves draw thither to be in covert and safety. Wherefore know we that
Solomon forbidding us to lay wait as the wicked against the house of the
righteous, signifies that the wicked spares not the just a whit, but does
him the greatest damage that he can, and the most trouble that is possible and
when in this point he would not have us too be like unto him, he
admonishes us, that (as much as we can) we put our neighbors, and their
goods in safety, and let them live in rest and peace, not seeking any way to
trouble them. And although he name but the just, yet this is not to say that
it is lawful for us to do damage, or trouble, or molest them, which we know
to be wicked: but he forbids namely the just, because the wicked will rather
do it to the just then to their likes: And also because by our nature we
resemble God, which when they see any little curre to be assailed, they al
run upon him: So do they commonly against the just, which are the most
weak and feeble before the world. This similitude is not improper, as it
appears by the complaint which Psalm. 22. 17. 21.
David makes, and by his prayer. Now the feebleness of the just is well
marked, when Solomon attributes to them one only little house, and not a
realm well defended, nor a strong castle: And when he attributes to them
resting place, and not chambers well garnished with Tapestrie, and beds of
Parament. Mean while what feebleness soever be in the just man, Solomon will
not that we lay wait against him, to trouble him, and put him to destruction:
as the wicked strives to do, to the end he may make himself great, mighty
and rich by the destruction of the just man. But the wicked abuses himself
far, and we also, if we be of his opinion, and follow his order of
doings, for it is impossible to ruinate, and destroy the just, and the wicked
cannot stand, but destroys and undoes himself by his awaites and
practices. Solomon signfieth well this same, saying,

16 For the just man falls seven times, and rises againes but the wicked
fall into mischief.
Although the wicked are hot to pursue the just, and never cease to afflict
them, to ruinate and destroy them, and that oftentimes the just bow under the
burden, insomuch that it seems that they are dispatched, and past remedy, as
likewise they themselves Psalm. 18. 5. 6. and 22. 3. 4. and 44. 10.
are tempted to think, as one may see by the complaints of the holy ones in
the scripture, yet nevertheless they be not abased nor overthrown, according
to the desire of the wicked, but as, seven times, that is to say, often, they
fall: even so they rise again and recover their falls, not by their own
proper virtue, but by the aid of God, which hears the complaints of the
holy. Contrariwise although the world favor the wicked, and sustain them,
and Psalm. 3. 5. and 6, 9. 10. and 18 7. and. 22. 24. 25. and 34. 18
that they themselves maintain themselves well, as it seems too them, and
that they think and say in their hearts, that no evil will ever come to them:
yet nevertheless the evil which they work against the innocent, overthrows
and destroieth them, so that they can never rise again, Solomon pronounces it
in brief, when he says,

But the wicked fall into mischief, or by mischief: to wit, that which they
imagine, and work. And it is that which is said, Behold, he trauelleth to
bring forth iniquity, and has conceived affliction, but will bring forth
lying. He has dug a pit, and Psa. 7. 15. and 9. 15.
made it hollow, but he is fallen into the ditch which he has made, etc. The
Heathen are sunk into the pit which they have made, etc. And so the ruin of
the wicked is mortal, and without recovery, but there is remedy for the just
man's fall. Wherefore when we are in affliction and adversity, and will know if
we may be delivered and raised up from the same, let us take good heed to
put our affiance in God our father, and assure ourselves, that he loves us,
for the love of his son Jesus Christ, and give ourselves to yield obedience
to his commandementes. Thus doing, we are on a sure ground that God accepts
us for inst: and therefore he will not suffer us to perish in our afflictions,
but will raise us up again. Some expound the two former sentences otherwise,
to wit, as though Solomon spoke to the wicked, saying, Let it suffice thee to
be wicked, entangle not the just man with thee in thy wickedness. Put no lets
before him, seek not occasion to slander him, nor trouble not his rest.
Provoke not the anger of God against thee, who loves the just, and restores
the decayed. Take no pleasure in the fall of the just man, for he falls
often, because he is environed with the infirmity of the flesh, And there is
not a just man on earth, which does good and sins not. But the just sin
sometimes grievously. And God permits it to the end that being brought low,
they may love him more fervently, and may become better advised, and more
gentle to their neighbors. The just man in falling, loses not his faith, he
acknowledges quickly his fault, and repents incontinent: and al and every
time that he falls he rises again. He falls not to death, because the
Lord holds him up with his hand, God suffers him to fall, but not to lie
there still. But the wicked fall in their mischief. Their fall serves them to no
good: for they repent not, nor they convert not, nor have no remorse: They are
naked of confidence, and persevere in their wickedness. And likewise, that
which is good, turns not them to good. Now although such sense contain good
doctrine, yet the first is better for the word which Solomon uses, which
signifies to fall, is hardly found in the Scripture, for, to sin, but still
to suffer adversity.

17 Be not thou glad when thine enemy falls: and let not thine heart
rejoice, when he stumbleth.
It is said, that God has not made death, and that he takes no Sapi. 1. 13
Ezeh. 18. 32 and 33. 11. Esaias. 59. 2. Romans 5. 10 Col. 1. 21
pleasure to see the living perish, and it is conformable to that which the
Prophet Ezechiel says, I covet not the death of him that dies, says the
Lord, etc. I am living, says the Lord, I covet not the death of the infidel,
but that he convert from his way, and live. Now when it is so, that by our
sins we are enemies to God, he declares and shows himself very
merciful, when he seeks not our destruction, but calls us to him again,
and gives us access by Jesus Christ his son, by whom he has reconciled
us to him, to give us life and salvation for ever. And as he is such a one
toward us, who are his enemies by nature (for the affection of the flesh, is
enmity against God) even so will he that we be pitiful and charitable toward
them which are our enemies: as he declares it unto To 87. 8.
us sufficiently by the benefits which he shows upon us daily, of the which
we are not once worthy. But not content herewith because we are as it were
blind, dull, and sluggish, not caring to consider his meruellous works, full of
great benignity and bounty, he declares it unto us by his word. He has
also declared it unto us by examples, as of Joseph toward his brethren: of
David toward Saul: of Jesus Christ toward mankind, and very manifestly
toward Exo. 23. 4. 5. Leui. 19. 17. 18. Mat. 5. 44 Romans 12. 17.
them which put him to death: and of S. Stephen toward his persecutours. And
therefore it ought to be manifest that it is not without cause that Solomon
admonishes us saying,

Be not thou glad when thine enemy falls, and let not thine heart rejoice
when he stumbleth. And as it is manifest unto us, even so we ought to follow
it: otherwise we are not the children of God our heavenly father, which makes
his Sun shine on the good, and on the evil. But some will say, that the
children of Israel sang a songue to the Lord for the destruction of Pharao, and
Mat. 5. 45 Fxo. 15. 1. Ind. 5. 1. Psalm. 9 18 and 3. 8* Esaias. 1. 24.
his people. And Debora, and Barac sang to the Lord for the disco^fiture of
their enemies. And David rejoiced at the fall of his enemies. And God said, I
will solace my self with my adversaries, and revenge me on mine enemies: and
therefore that it is laweful to rejoice at the fall of the enemy. I answer,
That we may rejoice at the fall of our enemies, when it serves to the glory
of God, and that by the same fall, we learn to fear the Lord, and magnify
him, and exalt him. But if we have regard to follow our proper injuries, and
search our particular profit, if we mingle our affections therewith, which are
ordinarily il governed: and if because we love ourselves, we are the swifter
to rejoice at the ruin of our enemies, our joy is not righteous. And also it
is that which Solomon forbids us in this present.

18 Least peradventure the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn
his wrath from him.
He puts forth to us three reasons to restrain us from the joy and
pleasure that one takes in the fall and stumbling of his enemy. The first is,
that God sees it: whereon they think not, which rejoice in the evil of their
enemies: neither will they because in pleasing themselves, they proceed with an
evil conscience, bearing hate and rancor against their enemies, and because it
seems to the^ that they are well revenged of the^, when they see that the evil
hapen to them which they wished for. And therefore they think not in their
thoughts that God sees them, although it be so, for all things are plain and
manifest to the eyes of the Lord, yea before their being: as also Solomon knew
well, but he says, Least peradventure, etc. for they which set not God before
their eyes as they ought, regard not the care and providence, the knowledge and
understanding of the Lord: but attribute al to fortune and chance, And so he
speaks according to the sense and apprehension of worldlings and carnal men:
and in the mean while tells us that God knows al our thoughts, although we
think it be not so. Seeing then that we will not have God to see the pleasure
that we take in the fall of our enemies, let us have pity and compassion on
their fall, helping to raise them up again as much as we can. The second reason
is, that such joy is wicked in the Lords sight, that is to say, displeases
him, for it is contrary to the law of charity, the which is agreeable to him
above al things, as he shows it well, when he declares that he will have mercy
and not sacrifice. And also they which rejoice in the fall of their enemies are
co^uinced in their own consciences, that they are replenished with hate, in
that of determinate malice they take pleasure in other men's harms: and so in
spite of their heads, they condemn themselves. The third reason is, that God
will turn his wrath from him, that is to say from the enemy, in whose fall we
take pleasure. And in this manner he which takes pleasure in the fall of his
enemy, shall be confounded, seeing God will pacify him, and raise him up in his
fall: for commonly the envious, which rejoice in the harms of other men, and
are grieved at their prosperity, are confounded, when they see it happen well
to them whom they hate. For the rest: let us know that Solomon shows us here
somewhat, that adversities, ruins, and desolations come to men because of
their sins: for God is not angry with us but because of our sins. And
therefore if he turn away his wrath, he pardons the sins. Note we also,
that seeing he turns away his wrath from him, at whose harms we rejoice,
that he which has such joy, sins. And so the anger which is turned from
his enemy falls upon him: wherefore let us understand that it is very
daugerous to take pleasure in the fall of ones enemy.

19 Frequent not thy self with the malicious: neither be envious at the
wicked.
Because it is a temptation very dangerous, and which greatly ouerpresseth the
feeble and weak, Insomuch that it is very hard for them to keep themselves
from being brought into the same, that is, to search the familiarity and
acquaintance of the wicked because that they see them prosper with the eye
according to outward appearance, and too be vexed and grieved when they are not
in so good estate as they are. For this cause, Solomon knowing the necessity
that we have to be well and often admonished, that we take no heed of the
prosperity of the wicked for to lust after it, and adioyne ourselves to them)
is not content with these former admonitions: but now again he admonishes us
of the same, saying,

Frequent not with etc. This is not to say, that we can exempt ourselves from
the presence of the wicked: for the Darnel shall be Pro. 1. 10. and 2. 12. and 3.
31. and 4. 14. and 23. 17 and 24. 1. 1. Cor. 5. 7. 2. Cor. 6. 14. Ephe. 5. 11.
amongst the good wheat, even to the consummation of the world: But that we
purge the old leaven, that we couple not ourselves with Infidels, and that we
be not pertakers of the unfruitful works of darkness. Wherefore let us
rejoice when we are often warned of such things: seeing that otherwise we
go unto utter destruction with the wicked. For by our nature we are of the
same affection that they are, and incline to their manners, and will not be
withdrawn thefro. We study on the outward face temporal and transitory:
we regard that ordinarily the wicked floorish and prosper, and it seems to
us that they are exempt from all dangers, al afflictions, and al adversities,
wherewith the just are as it were overthrown: insomuch that it seems they
shall never recover it. But the just at the last shall be raised up, as they hope:
for there shall be an end of their evils: as we have seen it.

Contrariwise, wischiefes shall assail the wicked of the which they shall never
rid themselves, and shall be overwhelmed therewith, that there shall remain no
work of their prosperity, Solomon Pro. 23. 18. and 24. 14.
pronounces it so, when he says.

20 For there shall be no end to the evil man: the light of the wicked shall be
put out.
When here before he has said, that there shall be an end for the just and
wise, which hope in the Lord, he means not that they shall perish: but that
their afflictions shall have end, we have to note, that when he says, now that
there shall be no end of the evil man: he means not that the wicked shall be
permanent, and that their prosperity shall be of long indurance: but that there
shall be no end of the plagues which shall affaile them. He himself shows
that we should understand it so, when he adds, The light of the wicked
shall be put out. For by the light he understands the glory, the ease and
prosperity of them, as has been said above.

21 My son, fear the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are
disguised.
Solomon shows us here the office of a good Pastor: for first he calls
them, who^ he teaches, his sons. In that he propounds unto them the word
of God, which is the seed of life, by the which he forms and begets them
to the Lord, as much as is possible for him. Whereby Ministers ought to learn
that their duty is to take care over the flock which is committed to them as
over their children, yea to be more careful of them: because the charge of
them is more difficil, more great, and more excellent, then of carnal children,
because the spirits are more excellent then the bodies, and more hard to
rule, guide, and govern. Secondly he teaches that which God has demanded at
al times to be honored and served as appertains to him, when he says,
fear the Lord, etc. Now that at al times God has demanded to be feared, it
appears first, when he would that Adam should obey his word, and threatened
him of death if he did it not. Secondly, when Abel by faith offered Sacrifice,
which was agreeable to the Lord: and that Genesis 2. 17. and 44. 26. and 5. 24.
and 69.
in the time of Enoch son of Seth, men began to call upon the name of the
Almighty, And Enoch walked according to God: and Noe was a just and an upright
man, walking after GOD. This could not be, but that these men were taught in
the fear of the Lord. Thirdly, when the Lord said that he knew that Abraham
should command his children and his house after him, that they Genesis 18. 19.
Deu. 4. and 6. and 10. Psalm. 34.
should keep the way of the Lord, etc. Moses also shows it in his
writings: as also does the Psalmist plainly and in many places. Solomon has
greatly praised this fear, and has invited us thereto: and yet presently
admonishes us of the same. Then seeing we see that the scripture speaks so
often of the fear of the Lord, and that they recommende it to us so
carefully, know we that it is the principal thing that God requires of us,
for by the same we are turned from al evil, and follow the good that he
commands us. Know we also, that we are so obstinate and stiffnecked in our
disobediences and rebellions, that it is great need to mollify our hearts by
often admonitions of the fear of the Lord. Fourthly, because in this world,
with religion, we have need to live in peace and tranquillity to keep civil
order, Solomon teaches us how we ought to keep it when he warns us too
fear the king: not as the wicked criminals which fear the gibet more then the
men of justice, who are comprehended under the name of King, but as Saint Paul
and Saint Peter teach us. And so although Solomon join the fear of the king,
with the fear of the Lord, Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2. 13.
yet nevertheless we ought not to fear judges and rulers as God, but
according to God and for his sake: and we ought to know that who so despises
the Magistrate, he has no fear of the Lord, but is disobedient and
rebellious to him. Know we also, that seeing the fear of the king is joined
with the fear of the Lord, that Magistrates are as assisters, or Liefetenants
of God, that they ought to represent him, and have his image so imprinted in
them, that it may be seen in their administration. And therefore when Solomon
teacherh us to fear the king, he shows covertly that me^ of judgment ought
to be wise, virtuous, true, holy, and just. Fifthly, because there are many
which despise both God and the king, and scorn all religion and civil order,
and that it is right dangerous to be familiarly conversant with them, least
one should be in the way to resemble the^, for this cause Solomon forbids
us their company and acquaintance, saying,

Meddle not with them that are disguised. They which have not that apparel
which they ought to have, and wear that which is not convenient for them, are
disguised: and men call them so. Now it behooves us al to be clothed and
apparelled with the fear of the Psalm. 2. and 5 Pro. 1.
Lord: as we may understand it by many places. They therefore which despise
the fear of the Lord, and of Magistrates, are by good right, called
disguised. Some call them unconstant and mutable: and it is not without cause:
for the word that Solomon uses, signifies so. And also indeed, they which
fear not the Lord nor the Magistrate, are never firm in a good purpose, but
turn to vanity, folly, wickedness, and dissolutions. For seeing that by the
fear of the Lord one refraineth from evil, and that it is the beginning or
principal point of wisdom, it cannot be, but they which reiectit, must be
vain, foolish, wicked, and by consequence, unconstant and mutable. Others call
them seditious, because they revolt from the commandment of God, and of the
Magistrate, and do the contrary. Of such men the acquaintance and
familiarity is very dangerous, not only because in following them, one is
rebellious to the Magistrate, who bears the sword to punish corporally the
rebels and seditious, but also he is in danger to loose his soul: seeing that
such disguised, unconstant, and seditious, and with them, their adherents, go
to perdition sooner then they are aware of, or then they would, as Solomon
shows it, saying,

22 For their destruction shall rise sodeinly: and who knows the ruin of them
both?
Because we have seen at al times, and yet do see, that the wicked contemners
and scorners of God, and of al good policy, flourishe and prosper, and that
according to carnal sense, and humane apprehension, it seems that their
glory and triumph indureth long. For this cause, if we will believe Solomon,
or rather the holy Ghost (as we ought to do) let us renounce our sense and
vanquish it, to the end that it let us not to know and understand, that the
wicked are not long in glory, triumph, and prosperity, but that straight way
they come to perdition, and sooner then they or others can perceive it, or
know it. As Solomon signifies, when he asks, And who knows the ruin of
them both? That is to say, of the wicked, malicious, and perverse, of whom he
has spoken here above, of the disguised, unconstant, and seditious, of who^ he
has also spoken: Or of the two, that is to say, of them which fear not God,
and which fear not the Magistrate. Noe knew not the ruin of the world by
the flood to come, but that God revealed it to him, and the world thought not
of it: as Jesus Christ pronounces it. Lot Mat. 24. 38. 3. Luke 17. 28 19. Exo.
33. 5. Psalm. 73. 18 19. Psalm. 30. 12 13. and 47. 9 10. 11. Mat. 24. 44. 48. 1.
These. 5. 2. 3 Psalm. 9. 4. 5 2. Pet. 3. 8. Romans 8. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 17 2. These. 1.
7
also looked not for the subversion of Sodom to be so near, nor the
inhabitants of the same. Solomon therefore speaks truly, when he says,

For sodeinly, etc. He speaks according to the threatening of the Lord, ye
are a stifnecked people, I will come sodeinly upon thee, and destroy thee, etc.
And to comprehend this well, it behooves us not to regard the space of time,
wherein the wicked prosper, but we ought to consider and know, that al
things be they never so far off, are now present with the Lord. Also it
behooves us to believe, that as the sufferances of times present, are not
worthy of the glory to come (for our tribulation is of small indurance and
very light, and brings forth meruellously in us a weight of eternal glory)
also the glory, triumph, power, and ease of the wicked, their delights and
prosperities, are not of long indurance, and are nothing in respect of their
ruin and perdition, which shall be for ever. For the Lord Jesus Christ shall
appear in heaven with the Angels of his power, and in flames of fire: working
vengeance on them, which knew not God, etc. Who shall suffer pain, that is to
wit, eternal perdition, etc. There is great difference between the longest
space of time that men can imagine, and a perpetuity which is incomprehensible
to us, insomuche as it has no end. Notwithstanding neither seeing it, nor
comprehending it by our humane sense, and natural reason, it behooves us to
believe it: for God which is veritable, reuealeth it to us by his word.

23 Also these things appertain to the wise: It is not good to know any man's
face in judgments.
Solomon heretofore has put forth to us many sentences so excellent, that we
ought not, nor may not judge, but that they are proceeded from great wisdom:
and as they are proceeded therefro, so they are also profitable to teach
wisdom to them, which give their minds and wills theretoo, and take
pleasure therein. Now although they be a great number, as we have seen, and
that they ought well to suffice to make us wise, yet nevertheless Solomon
adioyneth to them others, which are of no less wisdom then the former, as he
declares by a preface, saying,

Also these things appertain to the wise. That is, that the wise do teach
them, or that they are known to the wise. He uses such a Preface to awake
us, and show us that we ought not to be grieved for the great multitude of
his Proverbs, which are not superfluous, but very profitable and necessary:
seeing that the wise approve them, and teach them to make the simple and
ignorant more wise. Now, that it is to awake us, that he uses such a
Preface, it is manifest, when after the same, he says no new thing, but
that which Moses taught long time before: for it is said, Leuit. 19. 15. Deu.
1. 16. 17 and 16. 19.


It is not good to know any man's face in judgment. And this is agreeable to
that which is said in the law: seeing that GOD, which is only good, yea al
goodness, makes such an edict, it behooves the wise to teach that it is not
good to do the contrary: and that they which desire to be, and show
themselves wise, rest in the same, and beware to go against it. Wherein we
ought to learn, that it is meet for Kings, Princes, Judges, and governors of
the earth to be wise, seeing that it is to them principally that this edict is
addressed, as they are the liefetenantes of God, who has no acception of
persons. As therefore God, regards not the state and condition of men, which
is seen outwardly, whether they be male or female, strong or weak, poor or
rich, skilful or ignorant, simple or crafty, noble or vilaine, to do right
to every one, but he judges justly: Even so behooves it the Superiors and
Rulers of the earth to do. Otherwise God which Esai. 1. 23. and 28. 14. Pro.
18. 5. and 19. 6. 7.
has appointed them goods on earth, will take vengeance on them as they
deserve, and as he threatens them thereof. Solomon therefore says no new
thing, but that which Moses has taught, and he himself heretofore. But
although we have so many aduertisementes and threatninges of it, yet they cease
not to know faces: as Solomon complains. And as it is not meet to know
faces, so is it not good that any man seem to corrupt the Judges, by gifts and
brybes, by fair speech and flatteries, by honors and reuerences, by kindred
and familiarity: but that solicitating his business with modesty, and
without greediness, he attend with patience that which it shall please God to
pronounce by the mouth of the Judge.

24 He that says to the wicked, thou art righteous, him shall the people
curse, and the multitude abhor him.
It is a common thing in the world, that men flatter the wicked, and have them
in admiration, that they esteem them, and call them honest, and that they are
welcome every where, and have such credit, authority and might, that if one
blame them rightly, and for good cause, yet they shall be constrained to vnsaie
it again, and make them some recompense for touching their honor, and hold
them for honest men, if they will not lie in prison continually, or else be
banished. Whereby it seems well (as it is true indeed) that they which hold
up the wickedes chinne, give plainly to understand, that they say to the
wicked that they are just. For in causing by their injustice, that one repair
the honor of the wicked, they condemn the innocent, and justify the wicked.
Then if it be so, that men bless the wicked, it may well seem, that they will
not curse those that justify them. And indeed, if we regard the outward
appearance, and most common dealing, we shall find that the wicked Judges, the
false witnesses, and slanderers, are greatly praised and honored amongst al
people and nations, and that men fear much to speak evil of them. And so
according to our view, and humane sense, we see not that accomplished which
Solomon pronounces, saying,

The people shall curse him, etc. One may see it come to pass, that they which
suffer by the malice of wrongful Judges, can not keep themselves sometimes
from murmuring against such Judges, and that they must needs curse them. One
may see also, that the holy servants of God, the Prophets, cursed and
pronounced mischief against wrongful Judges. Yet nevertheless this present
sentence lets not to be true: for though there be hardly found any Deu. 27.
19. Esai. 5. 23.
man, if he be not very impudent and bold, which will say to him, that he
knows to be wicked, Thou art just: but will speak in his heart by the
affection which he has to gratify the wicked, and also by the works which
proceed of such affection in wronging the poor and innocent, to pleasure the
wicked. Also, although with word of mouth one curse not him which justifies
the wicked, because they will not bring themselves in hate with the mighty and
honorable, and be their enemy: yet nevertheless, there is none so ignorant,
nor none so wicked, which is not convinced in his conscience, that he which
justifies the wicked, is accursed, and detestable. There is also none but he
will say, that it is ill done to justify the wicked: and so by the judgment of
the conscience, and by a certain natural light, The people curse, and the
nations abhor him which says to the wicked, Thou art just. Every one may
judge this in himself: for if he think that one does him wrong to favor
his adversary, incontinently he thinks evil of his adversaries favorer:
and if he thinks himself strong enough, he will come and tell him his mind.
But although most commonly men flatter the favorers of the wicked, and dare
not curse them as they deserve: yet by the just vengeance of God it comes to
pass, that they pursue them as wicked and abominable. And this is done by
them, which have had them in great reverence, and have lived and made good
cheer at their dispense. Vproares, mutinies, dissentions, and seditions are
moved against them which favor the wicked, deciding causes that men know
manifestly to be wrong, and against the common sense of al equity and law. In
this manner, they show themselves violent, outrageous, and tyrants, and so
they are insupportable.

25 But in them that rebuke him, he shall have pleasure: and upon them shall
come the blessing of goodness.
As according to the common essence and ordinary dealing of the world, we see
not that men curse and have in detestation the evil Judges and governors which
favor and justify the wicked: even so it is not ordinary that one should
take reprehension in good part, nor seek to speak well of them which argue
and rebuke him, nor to do them any good turn, but rather to hate and abhor
them: Lot has proved it: Moses, Joseph, and the Prophets Genesis 19. Exo. 2.
13. Gen, 37. Esai. 29. 20. 21. Amos. 5. 10.
also, who make complaints and threatninges for the same. We also prove the
like at this present, in some which vaunt themselves to be reformed according
to the Gospel. For there is none that they hate more then them, which show them
the truth. Wherefore when Solomon says, But in them that rebuke him, he shall
have pleasure. Know we that he speaks not of the common use of the world,
but of the judgment of the conscience, which none can fly, be he never so
wicked and repugnant to the same. For seeing we judge it weldone, to rebuke,
chastise, and correct those which are of dissolute manners, we are overcome in
our own hearts to take pleasure in them which rebuke us, and to take it in
good part, and to allow of their zeal, and praise their affection and study.
Now although the wicked judge it so, will they nil they: yet nevertheless they
are grieved and vexed at corrections and reprehensions. And therefore they
force themselves, as much as they can, to shake of the pleasure that they ought
to take in those that rebuke them. And so it is principally of the good, wise,
and just, that Solomon speaks, when he says, But in them that rebuke him, he
shall have pleasure. For as we have seen, he that chastizeth the scorner, Pro.
9. 7. 8.
receives shame, etc. One might according to the opinion of some, say, that it
is God who has in favor them which reprehend the wicked, as it is true
indeed. For seeing he commands by his word, that one should reprove and
correct them which offend: it follows, that they which obey him in this, are
pleasant agreeable to him, and that he loves them, This exposition is very
agreeable to the promise following, And upon them shall come, etc. For God
rewards them largely, whom he loves and accepts. The great largeness is
set down, when Solomon is not content to say, Blessing shall come: But he
says, Blessing of goodness. Also we can not obtain any goodness, but by
the liberality and bounty of our God. When therefore blessing is joined with
pleasure, it is very requisite to attribute the pleasure to God, from whom
only proceeds al blessing. Nevertheless, if we regard the former sentence
of the 24. verse: where it is said, that the people will curse him that says
to the wicked, Thou art just: The first sense shall be agreeable. And though al
blessing come from only the Lord, yet it is no inconvenience to say, that of
them which take pleasure in those that rebuke them, shall come, the blessing of
goodness: because they shall praise, bless, and thank the rebukers, and be at
their commandment, and do them all the good that they can possibly. One may
also say, that blessing of goodness shall come upon them, which take pleasure
in them that rebuke them. And because the sense may be so diverse, it is best
to say impersonally, but in them that rebuke him, shall be pleasure. And it is
good reason, that the rebukers which argue and reprove us in the name of God,
and by his word, be pleasant and agreeable to us, and that we wish them al
goodness, seeing that in admonishing and reprehending us, they use the
scripture, to advance us, and make us the more perfect. All the scripture is
divinely inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for reprehension, for
correction, 2. Tim. 3. 16.
for instruction, which is in justice, That the man of God may be absolute,
being made perfect to al good works, etc. And to deliver us from our sins,
that we may be saved. They therefore Iam. 5. 19. 20
which rebuke, are well worthy to be blessed, when by their means we obtain
not only amendment of life, but also remission of sins, and salvation of the
soul. Meanewhile it behooves them greatly, which busy themselves to
reprehende, that they be pure of spirit to rule, and master: and that they be
void of ambition and heresy, as our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us.
Otherwise, although that they which rebuke us, are well worthy of reprehension,
yet nevertheless, we are more culpable, and worthy of more condemnation.

26 They shall kiss the lips of him that answers upright words.
They use to kiss in diverse sorts. Some kiss their neighbors Genesis 27. 26 27.
and 29. 11. 13. and 31 55. and 33. 4 and 45. 15. 2. Sam. 20. 9. Genesis 50. 1 Exo.
1 87. Luke 7. 38 Psalm. 2. 12
in sign of peace and amity, but the sign is not always joined with true
meaning. Others kiss for delight and voluptuousness: as do the carnal and
wanton worldlings: And others kiss in sign of reverence and subjection or
obedience: as Joseph cast himself upon his fathers face, and wept over him,
and kissed him: And as Moses issued out before his father in law, and kneeled
down and kissed him: And as the woman of evil life, being behind our Savior
Christ, wept, and began to wash his feet with tears, and kissed them. To
such manner of kissing we are invited: Kiss the Son, etc. We are so
bidden, because it is meet that we subject ourselves to the Son of God,
which has al power and rule in heaven and on earth. And therefore when the
Lord has made us subject to Superior powers, and to them which are placed in
pre-eminence, it behooves us to kiss them, which is, that we ought to do
them homage, and show them honor and obedience, as God commands us. The
second manner of kissing is filthy and infamous, amongst those to whom it
belongs not, and also, amongst those to whom it does belong, it is not
without fault, because they use it not in such sobriety and tempearance as is
requisite: and it is because our affections are never so pure and well governed
as they ought to be. But between Jesus Christ and his Church, the kiss of
delight and pleasure is holy, pure, and clean, and is most necessary for us,
above al things: and therefore the church requires but her spouse to kiss her.
As for the first kind of kissing, it has been at al times in use, and good
estimation, as we may see by the scriptures. Now it behooves us to see how
one shall kiss the lips of him that answers: That is to say, he speaks
and says upright words, which are of truth, justice, and edification. Can.
1. 2. Act. 26. 37. 1. Cor. 16. 20 2. Cor. 13. 12
It may well appear, that men will not kiss them on the first mamaner: for they
have in hate, and persecute them which are true and just, and which carry
sound doctrine, and utter just judgment, as the heathen themselves have
known and confess it: also experience has showed it al times, and in the
scripture there are many complaints thereof. They will not kiss them on the
second manner: for commonly they take no pleasure nor delight in honest, just,
Psalm. 11. 2. and 35. 11. 12. and 37. 14. Mich. ^3. 9. Esa. 30. 9. 10. 11.
and righteous men. They are no better now then were the children of Israel of
whom God complains, it is a people provoking to anger: lying children,
children which will not hear the law of God, which say to the seers, do ye
not see, etc. They will not kiss them on the third manner, but rather will
despise them and cast them down, they will make them captives, and bring them
in subjection and hard servitude, and will imprison them. Joseph has proved
it, Jeremy also and Micheas. Men do noweadaies the Genesis 37. Iere. 38. 6. 1.
Kings. 22. 26. 27. Acts. 4. 23. and 5. 17. and. 12. 2. and 16. 22.
like or far worse to the poor faithful flock: as also they have done to
the Apostles. Then seeing it is so that the world kisseth not the lips of him
that answers upright words, it behooves us to see how one shall kiss them,
and whom it is that kisseth them, for the holy Ghost, which has spoken by the
mouth of Solomon, and guyded his hand to write, is true, and cannot lie. If
we say that it is God which will kiss them, in that he has peace and love
toward them which answer upright words, and that he takes pleasure and
delight in them, it shall be true. It is well given us to understand, when the
scripture tells us, how God behaueth himself toward them which are
righteous. And as God, who is right and just kisseth them which speak upright
words: Even so they which love uprightness, will live peaceably and in love
with them which shall show themselves rightful in their conversation which is
comprehended under the word. But it is spoken here principally of the word,
insomuch that it behooves us to kiss the lips of magistrates, which utter
upright judgments, not only according to the two first manners of kissings,
but also according to the third. For they ought to Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2. Esa.
52. 7. Heb. 13. 17.
do homage as God commands them. Also it behooves to kiss the lips of them
which purely and faithfully preach the gospel, because they utter the glad
tidings of salvation: and we must not kiss them in the two first manners only,
but also in the third, not having regard to their persons, but to him that
sent them. And so Solomon pronounces that rather which we ought to do, then
that which we do ordinarily.

27 Prepare thy work without, and make ready thy things in the field which is
thine, and after build thine house.
God has ordained from the beginning that man should travel to the end to
live by his labor. But by the corruption wherein man is fallen and happened: he
has gone astray, and yet erreth from this holy ordinance, by fraud,
cousonages, violences, outrages, rauines, theftes and spoils: and by such
means has sought to build him a good house. This has been from Noes time.
The earth was corrupted Genesis 6. 11. and 14. Esa. 3. 13. Iere. 5. 26. Amos. 5.
11. Mat. 2. 1. and 6. 10. Haba. 2. 9.
before the Lord, and filled with extortion: And it has continued til Abraham's
time as we see it by the war and pillage whereof mention is made. And after
Abraham, it has not ceased, as we may see by the sacred histories, and by the
complaints of the Prophets: and yet they continue to do the like or worse. And
those which will be reputed the most holiest (as the Pope, the prelacie, and the
munkery) are the greatest deceivers, and the most wicked thieves. For under
shadow of devotion they suck the blood of the poor, simple and ignorant.
After them come they which aid themselves with Judges favors to destroy their
poor neighbors. They which proceed therein appertly by outrage, violence, and
tyranny, are nothing worth: but they are not so culpable. Now to the end that
we be not joined with such wicked men: Solomon warns us to do every one his
own business, to the which God has called us, when he says,

Prepare thy work without, etc. He speaks here but of one kind of work,
to wit rural, and under that he comprehends al other businesses which are
lawful, and by the which one may gain justly his daily bread. He speaks but
of one work to shun prolixitie, and principally of husbandry: for with that
that God has ordained it first, it is the most necessary for the body, and
Genesis 2.
from the same come al our other goods corporal, and temporal, and there is
nothing neither in town, nor village, nor house, the which comes not from
the field. And we have nothing without labor of the earth. It is the custom
of Solomon under one kind to comprehend the rest, as heretofore. And when
he says, Which is thine, we may here learn two things. The first that
we Prou. 12. 11.
ought not to leave and abandon our business to do another man's. For thus
doing we put both ourselves and our family in danger to beg our bread: but
yet I will not forbid one to do his neighbor all the pleasure, and service he
can: and chiefly him which is poor and feeble, and has need to be helped.
Thus doing one leaves not of his business. For the office and duty of
every one is, to aid him cheerfully and without constraint which has need of
it. The second is that we content ourselves with that which is ours, not
coveting to order our affairs at another man's costs. As do they which shift
their neighbors landemarkes, and encroche upon his ground. Otherwise we are
accursed. Cursed is he which remoueth 2. Cor. 8. and 9
the marks of his neighbor.

Moreover Solomon in this sentence shows us, that we ought not to eat our
bread for nothing. Wheretoo that agrees which S. Deuteronomy. 27. 17. Ephesians. 4. 28. 2.
These. 3. 6.
Paul teaches us: If we obey the same, we shall not want an house. As
Solomon promises us saying, And after thou shall build thine house. Whereby
he signifies, that if we will have an house to be ours by just title: it
behooves us to apply carefully our business, and get our bread in taking
pains, according as the state wheretoo God has called us, requires.
Contrariwise, that they which make no account to labor, can neither make nor
possess an house which is theirs, but usurp as thieves and robbers, all that
they have, by what title soever they possess it. But if we take the end of
this sentence for a form of admonition, as the beginning is, according as some
think, it is meet to say that Solomon teaches the father of the household,
how he ought to govern himself, to prosper in his affairs: that is to wit,
that he be careful to employ himself, first of al in things most necessary,
and that when he has done one thing, he do not desist, but labor daily, and
in good order, least one thing let the other to be done, such sense is not
inconvenient: but the first agrees right well with the scriptures, as may be
seen: and contains large doctrine, and of good edification.

28 Be not a witness without cause against thy neighbor: for will thou
deceive with thy lips?
To favor the wicked which they love carnally, and to be welcome amongst
the^, also to hurt, and indamage the innocent whom they hate unjustly, and of
whom they look for no support or favor, men make no difficulty nowedayes to
speak against their consciences, in lying slaundering, and laying false
reproach against them. Solomon shows well that it is against conscience, and
of set purpose when they do so. First when he says, simply, Be not a
witness against they neighbor. For also it is not ill done to bear witness,
against the injurious and wrong workers, the dissolute and reprocheful: But it
is necessary to accuse them, and purchase their correction and punishment. As
we ought to understand if we have any smacke of natural sense, and also the
scripture shows us it in many places. Solomon (I say,) says not simply,

Be not a witness against thy neighbor, etc. but he adds, Leuit. 5. 11.
Number. 35. 30
without cause. And herein as it is said, he shows that the slanderers and
false witnesses do sin against their consciences, and of malice deliberate.
For there is none, be he never so wicked, Deu. 17. 6. Mat. 18. 16. 17. John.
18. 23.
which will not judge it to be very ill done to hurt, or seek to hurt his
neighbor, when he gives him no occasion. Likewise if the wicked endure evil
for just occasion, and that he seeks to persuade himself that he has given
no occasion thereof, he will complain and say that men do him wrong to punish
him: which is a very sure argument that slaunderers and false witness bearers
do sin against their consciences, and of set purpose: seeing they know well
enough, that those whom they witness against, have given them no occasion of
the wrong which they do unto them. Secondly, when he asks, And will thou
deceive with thy lips? For no man seeks to deceive, but he which proceeds
of set purpose, and is reproved by his own conscience that he does evil,
and that he would not that others should do the like unto him. Also Solomon
does prick the conscience of the false witness bearer more nearly, when he
uses interrogation, then if he used a simple affirmation. And rebukes him
more sharply of his malice which is not little, but great and very detestable:
for men are not therewith only indamaged, but also God is greatly wronged
thereby, by the malicious hypocrisy of such people, when under shadow of
religion, they seek to undo their neighbors for to be hollow in witness
bearing, they brag themselves to be honest men, as one may see, when they
make no difficulty to swear that they say true, and they know well that they
lie, and that they shall lie falsely. In this manner they wrong God greatly. For
they take his name in vain, in forswearing themselves, and they recke not if
God be the author of lies: and as much as in them is possible they dispoyle God
of his truth and by consequence of his deity, which is to adnihilate him
wholly: for he cannot be God, if he be not veritable. We see then that it is
for good cause that Solomon attributes fraud to them, seeing they counterfaite
honest men swearing, and promising to say the truth, and their heart is
otherwise bent: to wit, full of treason and disloyalty. And so the disceite is
in the heart, as God well sees it: and the perjured himself well knows it.
Nevertheless in the sight of men, which see but the outward shape, the disceit
is in the lips, when they promise one thing, and do another quyte contrary.
It is thus that they deceive men. And therefore Solomon says, And will thou
deceive with thy lips? We see then that it is a very wicked thing to backbyte
and bear false witness. But yet the world makes no difficulty of it, as
has been said heretofore. And although the scripture admonish us often to
withholde us from false witness bearing, yet nevertheless men amend not.
This is done because they think not that God is witness and judge thereof,
and that they love not their neighbors.

29 Say not, I will do to him as he has done to me, I will recompense every
one according to his work.
Albeeit the world, deuoide of good sense, and right judgment, say, that a man
is worth nothing if he have not blood in his nails, and if he revenge not
himself on them which have offended him, yet nevertheless one cannot so much
abuse himself in speech, but his conscience will show him in spyte of his
head, that one ought to be peaceable, and not to revenge himself on his
enemy according as he desires. For let us take the most wicked man in the
world, who if he have done injury to any one, whom he esteems stronger then
himself, he will be content that he which is offended, should hold his peace
and dissemble the injury which is done to him, and not revenge it, he will not
think him for this, a man of no value. Likewise if he whom the wicked has
offended, go about, and force himself to be revenged, the wicked man will seek
to appease him, and show him that the offense is not so great, that he ought so
to covet to be revenged. Caine shows us this somewhat: for having offended
God by the murder which he had committed, his will was Genesis 4.
good, that GOD who was the stronger should have left him unpunished. And
seeing that he could not shun the judgment, nor fly the vengeance of God,
he complains saying, my puniment is greater then I can well bear. Wherein one
may see that the conscience of a man teaches him, that one ought not to be
revenged over his enemy. And when Saul who was a wicked reprobate at diverse
times justifies David in that he had the power and opportunity to revenge
himself, and yet nevertheless had spared, him: he shows us that a man be he
never so disordinate has 1. Sam. 24. and 26.
witness in his conscience, that he ought not to revenge himself over his
enemy according to his own desire and pleasure. But although we have such
natural light, yet nevertheless we are so perverse, that we seek to extinguish
and quench it. And therefore we have need to be admonished else how, that
is, by the word of the Lord. Also for to show the right way of clemency
and peace to them which show themselves tractable and easy to be taught and
to make culpable and guilty the proud and highminded, the furious and
enraged, the Lord gives us many commandments which have been heretofore
alleged, by the which he shows us that it is not not lawful for a man to
revenge himself, nor do the like to him that has offended him. He shows it
us also by many examples of holy men, which have been before us: and
principally of Jesus Christ our Savior, and we may and ought to behold the
charity of God toward us which were his enemies, and yet as much as in us
lies are his enemies, and provoke him too anger by our sins: for so much was
he absent from revenging himself on us, that he is come to seek us by his
son Jesus Christ to reconcile us to him, and make peace and aliance with us,
to the end that we should not be lost, but saved and kept unto life
everlasting. Then seeing we have so many commandementes and examples, let us
take heed that in all gentleness and humanity we follow them. Otherwise if
we be so rigorous or rather furious and mad, that we will not reco^cile
ourselves with our enemies, we shall have for adversary against us the Lord,
which will send us into utter darkness. Now because the effect of revenge
proceeds from Mat. 18. 3^
the heart, which is ill affectioned, and that the threatenings which proceed
from the same, serve also to inflame it the more, for this cause Solomon
seeks not only to correct the effect, but also to reform our tongues and
lips, and to restrain them from al threatening words, saying, Say not I will
do to him as he has done to me. And if it be not laweful to say so, it
follows well that it is not lawful to do so. But in this manner it may seem
at first blushe that Solomon gives us a doctrine contrary to the law of God,
or more straight, for it seems that the law permits us to do to our
neighbors as they have done to us, and to recompense every one according to
his work, according as it is written, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, foot for
foot, bruise for bruise, wound for wound, murder for murder. But the law
speaks to judges to Exodus 21. 24 Leuit. 34. 19 Deuteronomy. 19. 25 Mat. 5. 58.
whom it appertains to do to the wicked, as they have done to their
neighbors, and recompense them according to their works, and not to the
parties to revenge their own injuries. And as in the time of Jesus Christ our
Lord, there have been false expositors of the law, whom he rebukes: Even
so we ought to understand that Solomon has done the like in his time, and
has spoken to the parties when he says, Say not, etc. And not to judges, and
so he says nothing contrary to the law, and is not more rigorous then Moses
was. For he has not taught that one should revenge himself of his enemy,
but that he should aid him. Exodus 23. 4. 5


30 I passed by the field of the slouthful, and by the vineyard of the man
void of heart.
Solomon cannot but he must needs speak of tentimes of the slouthful, to
blame him, rebuke him, and threate^ him, to the end that we should remember it,
and take instruction thereby to hate and detest the slouthful and sluggish, and
to be careful and diligent to do every one our own business. And to begin
now to blame the slouthful, he makes himself like to a man which goes by
the way, and in passing considers how the fields and vineyards are disposed
and ordered, and according to the order that he finds, enquireth whose is
this or that. He signifies the inquiry, when he affirms that it is by the
field of the slothful and by the vineyarde of the man void of heart that
he passed. For a traveler cannot tell whose this or that is, unless he have
made inquiry. He uses here a repetition or exposition: for the slouthful and
a man void of heart is al one. For why a man is not at any time sluggish, but
because he has not courage to apply his business. Moreover we are here
instructed, that we ought not to be hasty to blame any one, but that to blame
rightly it behooves to have seen or heard it by witness worthy credit.
Otherwise we shall be rash and ouerhasty judges and defamers. To blame the
slouthful and man void of heart he tells the order of his field and
vineyarde, saying.

31 And lo, it was al grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the
face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.
The slouthful, and man void of heart is very worthy to be blamed, when he
suffers by his negligence and lasinesse the good creatures of God to go out
of kind, and, as much as he can, makes them unfruitful and profitlesse. For
God has given the earth to the sons of men, and has appointed them to
labor it continually, to the end that it may fructify and be profitable to
us. The gift is marked. Genesis 1. ver. 28. 29. and Psalm 115. ver, 16. The
ordinance is written. Genesis 8. ver. 22. And so with negligence there is also
contempt, when we apply not ourselves according to Gods ordinance. There is
also ingratitude, when we use not the creatures that God has given us, with
acknowledgement, and thanksgiving, which thing the slouthful do, when they let
thorns and nettles grow in their fields and vineyardes, and give them over to
wild beasts. As Solomon signifies it by the breaking down of the wall.
Therefore when we see that Solomon blames the slouthful, For the thorns and
nettles which had covered, etc. We have to note, that although the earth be
cursed through man's occasion: yet never Genesis 3. 17.
thelesse man is not forbidden, to seek to shun this curse by toil and
diligence, but he is commanded to travel, and blessing is promised him, if he
labor, in obaying the voice of the Lord. It is meet also that the man which
sees the disorder in the field and vineyarde of the slouthful and man void of
heart, that is to say, Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28. 8. Psalm. 12. 8.
in his goods and estate, consider and way the ruin and desolation, to the end
he may take heed not to imitate the slouthful, but learn to be better
advised, and apply himself to his business. Solomon teaches us by his
example that we ought to do so, when he tells us what he did, saying,

32 Then I beheld, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received
instruction.
When he is not content to say, I beheld: but adds, And considered it well
and looked upon it: He shows that to be well taught to take care and
diligence, it behooves to consider attentively and nearly, the desolation,
which is in the estate of the slouthful, and void of heart, to the end we be
not partakers of their sloth, lasinesse, and negligence, and that we praise
them not nor flatter them in any case, but we reprehende them, showing them
whence the desolation comes that is in their goods and estate: as Solomon
does saying.

33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, and a little foulding of the hands
to sleep.
He rebukes the slouthful, flouting them, and speaking according to their
opinion and pha^tasie. For although the slouthful sleep too much, yet he has
never slept enough, neither speaks he of any thing but to sleep a little,
when he has no will to awake. Solomon expressing the words and fantasy of
the slouthful, shows also very plainly that he sleeps too much, and that
the deed is not according to the word for he is not content to say, yet a
little sleep. But he multiplyeth the words and says one thing three times,
under diverse phrases of speech. And herein he rebukes the slouthful sharply
of his too much sleep: and threateneth him afterward with poverty, which
shall come suddenly upon him, and he shall notwithstand it, saying.

34 So thy poverty comes walking on: And thy necessity as an armed man.
Although he have attributed field and vineyard to the slouthful: yet
nevertheless because he tilleth them not as he ought: he tells him that he
shall be ouerpressed with sudden inexpected poverty, the which is signified by
this word walking or as a traveler, or way faring man: for he ariueth, when
no man thinks on him. But it shall not be only sudden, but also rude and
rough, hard and very difficile to overcome or escape, as Solomon signifies by
an armed man, or one well appointed.

The xxv. Chapter.
1 THese also are parables of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah
copied out.
GOd gave commandments to the children of Israel to show them how the king
ought to govern Deuteronomy. 17. 16
himself amongst them. To the which commandments king Ezechias was obedient.
Now amongst these commandments he says: When he shall sit upon the throne
of his kingdom, then he shall write for himself this law 2. Kin. 18. 3 Deu.
17. 18. 19
in a book by the sacrifisers Levites, etc. Wherefore we may understand that
the men of Ezechias whereof mention is made here, were of the Leuitical
sacrificers which were careful to instruct and teach the king Ezechias. And to
do this, they gathered him togitherin a book the sentences which were here
and there dispersed, and put them in order, according to the authors out of
whom they were drawn: and amongst others they have put the proverbs of
Solomon which follow, to the former, to make thereof a book. Wherein we may
see two things: the first, what kings ought to learn and follow of their
predecessors, to wit, good doctrine after the which they may reform their
manners as they ought, in all holiness and justice, and not to regard their
worldly pompes, and carnal magnificencies, neither their pride and
haughtiness, nor their vanities and folly. The second, that about them they
have skilful men, which may be careful to search the scripture, and that they
expound it in such good order and fashion that it may be easy to the hearers
which are ready to be taught and profit therein. And these two things here
appertain principally to Princes and Magistrates which bear the name of
Christians, and say they are reformed to the Gospel. As we may see, when there
is express mention made here that Ezechias which had such men, was King of
Judah, that is to say, of the people of God.

2 The glory of God is to conceal a word: but the Kings honor is to search
out a word.
The worldly wise men desire greatly to be known, to the end to be in honor
and worship. And to come to this, they make their works to shine, and as much
as they can possibly, give a fair show to their speech and words: and al to
darken the glory of GOD, which they have in contempt and derision, and are
enemies and adversaries theretoo. Yet God shows not himself to the eye what
he is, as Esaie pronounces it. Truly thou art a God which hydest thy self.
For he exempteth not the wicked from his vengeance, and yet Esa. 45. 15.
nevertheless he executes it not presently, also he frustrateth not his chosen
of their promises, although he accomplish the^ not so soon as they would. But
he dissembleth, letting the wicked florishe and prosper, and sending
afflictions to the just, reserving to himself that which he has determined
everlastingly, to put it in effect at his time appointed without change of
purpose. And this is for his glory that he does so: keeping himself as it were
covert and in silence. Solomon pronounces it so when he says,

The glory of God, etc. And this is as though he said. Because that God is
still and dissembleth, and it seems to the wicked that he is deaf and
blind, or that there is no God as they say in their hearts. For this cause
they despise him, and as much as they can, bring him to reproach, yea to
nothing if it were possible for them. But we seeing and knowing his bounty and
patience, by the which he inuiteth us to repentance, to the end that we
perish not, we have to call upon and glorify him with David. For the riches
are great, which thou have reserved for them which fear thee, etc. And Psalm.
31. 20.
albeeit God by his eternal purpose (which cannot be but just) is silent and
dissembleth for a time, yet nevertheless kings and governors of the earth
which are his lieftenants, cannot, nor ought not to search their glory in
deferring judgment, but rather their honor is and shall be to make diligent
inquisition of things, to the end that they may readily do justice and
judgment, according as God has commanded them by his word. Solomon well
shows it them, when he says, But the kings honor, etc. Wherein he shows
that the kings of the earth are worthy of contempt and rebuke, for in steed of
searching out a word, that is to say, of being careful and vigilant to do
their duty and office, they are asleep. And if they wake it is not to look
to that which they have to do: so that men may rightly complain of them. Al
their watchings are Isa. 56. 10.
blind: they know nothing: they are al dumb dogs, etc. He shows also that
false witness, as much as in them lies, deprive kings and men that do
justice, and of honor: for they let them to search out the word, when in
steed of verity they witness untruth. Moreover seeing we ought to honor
our Kings, Princes, and superiors. Solomon shows us that we ought to be
careful to let them understand the truth, and not to hyde it from them in no
case, especially when there is question of mainteining the honor of God, the
peace and quietness of the just and innocent. If Kings and their subjects will
well search out the word, it behooves them to be careful to read, hear,
and meditate the doctrine of Moses, of the Prophets and Apostles, the which is
hidden to the sage and prudent Mat. 11. 25. 1. Cor. 1. 18. 1. Sam. 2. 30.
of this world. Thus doing they procure the honor and glory of God, and he
will honor them as he has promised.

3 The heavens in height, and the earth in deepenesse, and the kings heart can
no man search out.
Although the heavens and the earth be things visible and palpable: yet
nevertheless the heavens are so high, and the earth so profound, that if all the
men which ever were, were assembled together to aid one another to reach up to
the heavens, and dig or make a hole to go through the earth, to know how
high the heavens are, and how deep the earth is: yet they could have no sure
knowledge thereof. For they could not mount to the heavens, nor descend from
the one side of the earth to the other. Esaias willing to Esa. 40. 12.
exalt and magnify the puissance of God, attributes to him, that there is
none, but he alone, that can measure these things, saying, Who is he that has
measured the waters with his hand, and has compassed the heavens with his
palm? Solomon pronounces the same now, when he says,

The heavens in height, and the earth in deepenes, and the kings heart. etc.
Not that it is his principal intent to show, that there is none but God, which
can measure the highness of the heavens and the depth of the earth: but he
compares the heart of kings, princes, and superiors of the earth to this
highness and deepenes, to show us that it is not for us to tempt and assay what
the heart of the king is, to make it condescend to our will and be governed
by us. And also the heart of a true king is so upright, that one shall hardly
bow it to wickedness and iniquity, as Solomon has said elsewhere. And
although there is none but God which Prou. 16. 10. and 21. 1.
sounds the hearts of men, how great or little soever they be: yet
nevertheless Solomon speaks here principally of the hearts of kings, and
this for diverse reasons. First because God makes kings otherwise then they
were when they were private persons, as we have seen in Moses, which was
instructed in all wisdom by the Egyptians, and in Joshua. One may see it also
in the Judges which Act. 7. 22. Deuteronomy. 34. 9. 1. Sam. 10. 16
were after Joshua. It is also written, that Saul should be changed into another
man.

Secondly because they are the Liefetenants of God, which boweth for no body.
Also they ought not to suffer that one should search their hearts to make
them incline to another man's will, for their inclination would be far more
dangerous then a private persons. Thirdly, because that subjects ought to
bear such reverence to their superiors, that they should not once think, to
turn the heart of their superious to their appetite, but that they leave it
to God, praying him to dispose it as he shall see good. Fourthly, because that
when magistrates suffer not their hearts to be searched, for to be turned
from right and equity, but that they fear to offend the Lord, and are
afraid that God will use them as the instruments of his ire: as he has done
with Pharao and the Kings of the Assirians and Babylonians. And as he does
now with the Pope, and Kings and Princes which obey him, to persecute and
murder the poor faithful. Then the subjects also shall learn to fear the
Lord, and for his sake to obey their superiors, whom they see to be
conducted by the providence of God, and know that if they have no fear and
reverence toward God and their magistrates, that they shall not escape the
judgment of him who governs the hearts of the magistrates.

4 Take the drossefrom the silver, and there shall proceed a vessel for the
finour.
This present sentence would be little account made of, if we should say that
Solomon taught the finour, how he ought to dispose and purify the silver to
make some piece of work thereof. And therefore note we that the holy
scripture transferreth the names of things insensible, to creatures which have
sense and reason. And sometimes it uses similitudes and comparisons the better
to imprint in our hearts (which are rude) the doctrine which is very
profitable and necessary for us. As when he says, thy silver is turned into
dross, and thy wine is mingled with water. The Prophet Esa. 1. 22.
calls corrupt silver the hypocrites. Likewise Jeremy transferreth the names
of silver and other mettalles to the people of Israel. And chiefly to the
greatest which would be most esteemed. And when Solomon says, Ier. 6. 28. 29
30.


Take away the dross, etc. he speaks by similitude: for this sentence with
that which follows.

5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established
in righteousness.
It is as much as if Solomon should say: As when the goldsmiths are careful to
scumme and purify their silver, then they make substantial and pure work,
which cannot be found fault withal: even so when Kings, Princes, and
Magistrates, are careful and vigilant to root out the wicked, then they reign
peaceably over their subjects which fear to offend them, or do wrong or
grief one to another, and are careful to yield every one that which
appertains to him in all truth and righteousness. The Lord showed this well
when he purged the world by the flood and subverted Sodom and Gomorrha, and
sunk Dathan Core and Abyron. He gave Moses well to understand that he
ought to root out the wicked, when he gave many laws and commandments,
wherein he expressed the punishment, which he would that the wicked should
endure: And has often appointed that the wicked should be rooted out to the
end that others hearing and seeing their punishments might learn to fear and
restrain themselves from the like wickedness. David well understood such
ordinances, and had good affection to follow them: as appears by the
protestation which he makes in the 101. Psalm. Here kings are taught
clearly how they ought not to spare the fire of punishment to purify their
subjects thereby, to the end they may be as clear as silver from the
dross. Also subjects ought to let themselves be ordered by their superiors,
as the silver is by the finour: and in no wise to murmur against the
magistrates, for the punishments which they make although they trouble their
neerestkinne. And as silver, after one has taken away his dross, is of no
less price, but more saleable: even so a nation ought not to think themselves
dishonored if one root out of the wicked which are in the midst of them. Note
we also that although it be said,

From before the king, and that it is meet he have good assistance about him:
yet notwithstanding in that the care and wakefulnesse of the king ought to
stretch throughout al his realm, he ought not to restrain it before him, in
his presence and sight, but stretch it out over al his dominions and charges.

6 Boast not thy self before the King, and stand not in the place of great
men.
We will not abase ourselves, but by our wills, will naturally be advanced, and
appear great, to the end that by this means we may maintain ourselves, and
enjoy our enterprises and attemptes. Adam would have been like to God. The
giants got themselves Genesis 3. and 6. and 11. 1. Sam. 18. 8 2. Sam. 15. 16. and
17.
great renown. The sons of men, began a great building to purchase fame, and
make themselves mighty. Saul seeing himself despised, was angry, and to
maintain his greatness, conspired against David. Absolon coveting after the
Kingdom, wrought treason against David his father. And al these here have
thriued very ill with their ambition and pride. And because Solomon knew well
that we feared the harms, to the which yet nevertheless we went not, but
rather ran headlong as furious and enraged, by our rashness and boldness, by
our pry de and haughtiness of stomach: for this cause he seeks to despoile
us, and withdraw us from al ambition, and induce us to humility, and make us
love it when he says, Boast not thy self, etc. There is none of us but
naturally he has a Kings heart, worldly and carnal, which seeks to be
praised, exalted, and redoupted: and we strive to prefer ourselves before
our neighbors, and covet to be before them in honor and glory. Solomon
thinks not such a nature to be good, which is so full of pride and
loftiness, and will that we prevent one another in honor, esteeming every one
more excellent then ourselves. He shows us this well, when teaching us in
general to humble ourselves toward our neighbors, he names but kings and
great men. Because those are they which ought to be preferred above al men, and
if we humble not ourselves unto such personages, we will easily despise the
others. For this cause we are admonished to be subject to al humane order for
God: be it to the King as a superior; or to governors, as sent by 1. Pet. 2.
13. 14.
him, etc. There are very few that think well of this that Solomon says here,
and think nothing better then to exalt themselves, and strive to make
themselves fellows with Kings and great men of the earth. And it seems that
if they should recoyle, and play the cowards and bashful fellows, then men
would make no more account of them then of sots, and idiots. But to the end
we resemble not such men, but like well of this sentence, to withdraw us
easily from al ambition, pride, and arrogancy: Solomon shows us what it is
that we ought to prefer and esteem as most profitable for us, when he says:

7 For it is better that it be said unto thee, come up hither: the^ thou to be
put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
Here at first view it seems that Solomon teaches us only a modest and
humble civility, but in taking this sentence so, we give it not that
excellency that belongs to it: wherefore we ought to understand, that under
the word of humble civility, he strives to print in our hearts the true
spiritual humility, by the which we are guided to humble behavior, and
modest countenance. Our lord Luke 14. 7
Jesus Christ does the like. Nevertheless our Lord Jesus Christ, nor Solomon
condemn not the first places how high soever they be, but the ambitious
affection: as the Evangelist shows it well, when he says that Jesus told
the bidden guestes a similitude: to beware how they chose the first place at
the table, etc. Now to allegorisate this sentence otherwise by the Minor, it
would be to no edificatio^. Let it suffice us, that the holy Ghost inuiteth us
here to true humility, to the end, that being lowly of heart in this world,
we may be at last exalted, which thing we shall obtain if we be of the same
affection that the Publican was. Luke 18. 1^


8 Go not forth hastily to strife, lest thou know not what to do in the end
thereof, when thy neighbor has put thee to shame.
They that are haughty of courage, do quickly begin strife with their
neighbors. And therefore it may seem, that to bring us to concord, Solomon
has sought to root out of our hearts, pride and ambition, and to plant in
them true humility, which consists chiefly in having God in great admiration
and reverence, we may fear him and obey his will according to his word, and
that we lift not ourselves up against our neighbors, deeming ourselves more
excellent and worthy then they, that we be not folowers of the Pharisee.
Solomon (I say) having told us of such humility, comes by good order to
speak of concord, when he will not that we strive saying, Go not forth
hastily to strife, etc. Wherein he describes unto us the manners of a stout
and unadvised man, and which has too hot a blood. They that are such,
hearing the least word that is to their displeasure, go out into the street
straightway to scold and chide with their neighbor, or to arest him to the law
and trouble him. Of such people the world is full, as one may see daily. So
that one may well complain of al nations, as Saint Paul did of 1. Cor. 6. 6. 7.
the Corinthians. Brother has process against brother, etc. Solomon
describes also the perplexity wherein they fall which are hasty to strife
unadvisedly: which is, that they whom they wish ill too, are often Superiors,
and obtain the conquest: and so make these rash fellows abashed, ashamed,
and confounded: so that they know not what they shall do. In making such
discriptions, Solomon seeks means to withdraw us from al mutinies,
seditions, strifes, and debates: for to be put to shame is a thing which we
fear: Not that it is the principal cause that should withdraw us from being
hasty to strife. For the principal cause is, and ought to be the fear of the
Lord, and next, the charity which we owe to our neighbors. But Solomon in
this case speaks to us as to men, which fear more their damage then God, and
love their worldly honor better then their neighbor. If we will well shun
such perplexity and confusion, let us follow the counsel that Jesus Christ
gives us, Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way
with him. Mat. 5. 25. 26.


9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbor, and reveal not the secret of an other
man.
Men are naturally so hot of blood, and so choleric and furious* that if it
seem them that their neighbor has done the^ any offense, although it be
light and secret, incontinently they rage in public, and sound, as it were a
Trumpet, to give to understand to others that those have offended them greatly,
and seek not but to defame their neighbor, sowing words of reproach here and
there against him. And because this dealing is contrary to humanity, which
we ought to have in great estimation: For this cause Solomon willing to
moderate our choler, admonishes us, that if we have to do with our neighbor
about controversy, we shall talk thereof with him, and seek to make an end of
it, the secretliest that we ca^, without calling witness to us, and that we
discover not the imperfection, and falt of our neighbor, til we have first
talked of it between us and him, and sought to remedy it secretly. Solomon (I
say) admonishes us this same, saying, Debate thy cause, etc. Whereto agrees
Mat. 18. 15 Luke 17. 3. 4.
the saying of our Lord: But if thy brother have offended thee, go and rebuke
him secretly between thee and him. Take ye heed. If thy brother have
offended thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, pardon him, etc: and this agrees
with the law, Thou shall not hate thy brother in thine heart, Correct thy
neighbor, and suffer not sin upon him. We could not so guide ourselves, if
we were not gentle, gracious, and merciful. And therefore to obey Solomon, or
rather Jesus Leuit. 19. 17
Christ well, it behooves us to mortify, dispoile, and cloth: as saint Paul
admonishes us in diverse places. Mortify therefore your members Col. 3. 5
which are earthly, etc.

10 Lest happily, he that hears it, put thee to shame: and that thine infamy
do not cease.
Some think they get great honor in revealing an other man's secret, that is
to say, they creep into reputation by defaming their neighbor, and complain
of him to an other man of some secret offense, or which is none at al, as it
comes oftentimes to pass, that the accusers, and they which complain, do
the most wrong. But it happens (as good reason it should) that in steed of
getting honor thereby, he that hears the accusation or complaint, knows
quickly that it is without cause that the accuser complayneth. And therefore he
that sits in audience, blames him, as he well deserves: and the accuser
gets a mark or blotte to himself, which endures and can not be defaced:
and they that know him well, take him for a liar, talebearer, and backbiter, and
will call (...) so: as Solomon signifies it by the shame and infamy which will
not cease, when he says, Lest happily, etc. He says namely, peradventure,
or happily, regarding first the opinion of the accuser: who thinks that men
will hold his words for true, and deemeth it a great hap if his malice be
discovered, and he have blame and infamy thereby. Regarding secondly, that it
is very hard to change custom, chiefly when it is wicked. Now the custom
is such throughout all the world, that they take pleasure to hear ill speeches
of their neighbors, and that flatterers, liars, and backbiters, are the best
welcome. And so it is great hap if they be rebuked and defamed. They which
slandered David unto Saul, were welcome, and more esteemed then he. But the
holy Ghost which hears them, knows well how to rebuke them, by the
scripture, and to put them to shame, and infamy, which shall never be
abolished. And so if backbiters be not discovered by men, God can well discover
them at time convenient.

11 A word spoken in his due place, is like apples of gold, with pictures of
silver.
If any man seek to garnishe his speech, to please and bring profit and
delight to an other man, he for who^, and at whose pleasure this man speaks,
will say, that his neighbor has a golden tongue, and that his speech pleases
him as well as a jewel of gold, bedecked with white silver. If amongst
worldlings, words be of such price, by far more reason we ought greatly to
esteem of the word of God, which is purely and faithfully administered to us,
and should take great delight therein. Solomon shows us it, when he says, A
word spoken in his due place, or order, or upon his wheels (as Solomon's
language is) is like apples of gold, etc. I know that one might apply this
sentence to al purposes which are spoken of, as it appertains of what matter
soever they be. But when he says, Blessed is he that has his affection set
on the law of the Lord, and meditateth it day and night. We should not find
a word so well spoken in his due place, or upon his wheels, as the word of
the Lord. And therefore with Solomon we will compare it to Apples of Gold,
with pictures of silver: not that the word divine exceeds not far all the
fairest, and most precious things of the world: but the scripture applies it
self to our rudeness, to lead us as it were by the hand, to take a taste
and delight in the word of God: the which in other things is compared to
gold, silver, and precious stones. If one will take here the word, for that
which is proper to pacify quarrels between one neighbor and an other, without
publishing them, the sense shall be very convenient, and not contrary to that
which has been said. For there is no word more fit to pacify strifes, then
the word of the Lord, or that which is conformable thereto.

12 He that reprooueth the wise and the obedient ear: is as a golden earing,
and an ornament of fine gold.
Earinges or pendentes of gold, were in old time in use with maidens and
women, and also other jewels of gold, and pleased them, and (as they thought)
became them well as may be seen, when Rebecca was ready to receive the
earinges of gold that Abraham's man put before her face. And at this day, also
maidens and women which are curious to be seen, take delight to wear precious
Genesis 24. 2^
ornaments, and think themselves gaie, when they shine in gold and silks,
and when they be preciously and pompeously apparelled. And they love such
ornaments so well, that they are very careful in keeping them: and if they
have power and liberty, they will gather abundance of them. We say not this, to
the praise of women and maidens, nor to allow that which they do in this
case. For Saint Paul and Saint Peter rebuke them. But if women be so desirous
to deck themselves outwardly, it behooves us to be 1. Tim. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 3.
3.
very ready to receive inward ornaments to deck and beautify ourselves:
which is, that in all obedience, we lend our ears to them which instruct us
in the word of the Lord, by the which they admonish and instruct, argue, and
reprehende us, to make us more fair and pleasant before our God. Let us take
pleasure in such persons, and esteem ourselves well iewelled, when the Lord
puts before our face such earinges. To do this well, we ought to renounce al
folly, for they which are given there too, despise al counsel, and reject al
correction and instruction, as is said here above in diverse places. And it
behooves us to embrace wisdom, the which makes us attentive to correction,
and procures us to love it. Thus doing, we shall be decked and adorned very
gorgiously: as Solomon signifies it, when he says, He that reprooueth, etc.
The wise man which gives ear to obey corrections and reprehensions, makes
great account of him which reprooueth him, and thinks him well garnished and
adorned thereby. And (as has bin seen) he loves him which reprooueth him,
and becomes sage thereby, and Pro. 9. 8. 9.
grows up in doctrine. Wherefore let us never think ourselves so wise, but
men may find wherein to reprove us: chiefly if we be wise, we will acknowledge
that we are well worthy of rebuke. Not that I will say, that wise men commit
crimes wittingly, but they offend by infirmity. Whereof perceiving themselves
guilty, they suffer willingly to be reproved, and take pleasure therein,
thinking it a great honor to do so. They resist not by murmuring and despite,
they brag not themselves to be honest men, as do the folish and wicked, who
rise up against them, which seek to deck them with earings and spiritual
jewels of sapience: whose merchandise is better then the merchandise of silver:
and her revenue, then fine gold. Pro. 3. 14. 15


13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to
them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his maistresse.
A faithful messenger has bin spoken of elsewhere: notwithstanding, Pro. 13. 17.
Solomon lets not to treat of it now again, and to show us, what we ought
to be in our charges and commissions, and what we ought to do therein, and
whereto to attend. For there is none of us but he is a messenger: not that the
charges or commissions are all alike, for some have more power then some. And
to show us this same, he sets before us those messengers or Ambassadors
which serve their masters faithfully, and by this means give them matter of
joy, and content them so, that they repose themselves wholly upon the^. And he
compares the^ to the cold of snow, which wintereth the corn that is in the
ground, and comes in such a season that it makes it to prosper: so that the
harvest following is fertile and abundant. Or also (which seems more
convenient) he compares them to cold which comes in harvest time, much like
to the cold of snow to refresh them which reap and labor in a whote region:
such cold is a great recreation, for it makes that they which travel, are
not altered, surfeited, nor choked up with the great heat. And it is not
without cause that he makes such a comparison, for they which do their
message faithfully, do keep their masters which send them from great grief
and from al vexation, and as much as they can, yield them matter of recreation.
As we know that it is a great pleasure to a Gentleman, when he has
servants that execute well the charge that is committed to them. Now we are
al messengers and Ambassadors of our God, who has called us into his family,
and sends us as he thinks good, and gives us a charge which he will that we
execute. Not that we have al public charge, as kings and superiors of the
earth, nor as Pastors and ministers of the Church, which are the principal
messengers, as has been said above: But the Lord sends us to our neighbors,
giving us charge that we have care one over another, according to the talent
which he has put into our hands. If we execute our charge faithfully, we
shall be to him as the cold of snow in the Harvest. Not that we can do any
thing to recreate or rejoice him, but he alone of his bounty rejoices, and
delights himself, when in uprightness of heart we seek to execute our
charge faithfully.

14 He that boasts of false liberality, is like clouds, and wind without
rain.
When men see clouds driven by the winds, they look that they shall have
rain, but it chances sometimes that none at all falls, and so they loose
their expectation: Even so when men see any one which is frank of his
promises, they hope to obtain the same of him. But they are very often
deceived, and prove that the greatest promisers are clouds and wind without
rain. They are rich and liberal in promises, but there is no effect following,
and so they boast themselves falsely and are of no profit. They are content to
bear a fair face, and make men gape after them, and hold them in hope of
things. Those which are such, not only are vain, as clouds which are
without water, but also hurtefull, as the wind which dries the earth, sucking
his humor without sending him any again, but making it yawne for thirst and
dryness. The captain of such men is the Devil, and of him they have learned
to boast themselves falsely. Adam well proved the boasting of the Devil Genesis 3.
1. Kings. 22.
to be false. Likewise Achab and Iosaphat have proved it, after that they had
believed false Prophets, by whose mouth the Devil spoke. The Devil sent
clouds, and wind without rain, when he Mat. 4. 9. Luke. 4. 6.
promised our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to give him all the kingdoms of
the world, and boasted that all the glory thereof was his. We see then that
they which brag of things which thy neither will nor can do, are supposts of the
Devil, who is a liar and the father of lies. Also as the clouds and wind
without rain vanish away, and John. 8. 44.
come to nothing: even so these great boasters shall perish with the Devil
their father. For, Thou shall destroy al them that speak lies: and chiefly
when the lie is in slander. As is the false doctrine of the Papists, which
teach of free will, and merits, and other abominable Psalm. 5. 7.
lies, and promise that by this means men shall win paradise and obtain life
eternal. Their destruction is plainly showed the^. Wherefore we ought to take
great heed of al false boasting. And principally 2. Pet. 2. 3.
of things which are to come which are to us uncertain, and of them we
should make no promise, but at Gods good will and pleasure. Also of things
which are present with us, if we will show liberality, let us do it in
secret, without ostentation or vain show, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has
taught us. Last of al let us understand, that the holy Ghost teaches us here
to love one another indeed and truth, as also we are admonished thereof in
John. 1. John. 3. 18.


15 A Prince is pacified by the staying of anger: and a soft tongue breaks
the bones.
Albeeit the anger of kings and great men of the earth, be meruellously to
be feared because of their highness and power, Pro. 16. 14. and 19. 14. and
20. 2. Pro. 16. 19.
and that men hardly escape it, and with great difficulty and danger: yet
nevertheless if one show himself sage before them, he may pacify them, and
in steed of being harmed, find pleasure and utility. Now to show ones
self wise, it behooves him to put of an angry and furious heart, which is
seditious and arrogant, hautie and rebellious, and not to be easy, nor hasty
to show his anger nor wrath, to rise up against his prince, or do damage,
hurt, or violence to his neighbors. If we have Pro. 14. 29 and 16. 32. and
19. 11.
such wisdom and discretion to defer and slack our anger, we shall find
grace at our princes hands, so that they shall refrain their great anger, and
be induced to use benevolence. Solomon has showed this above, and yet now
again he shows it when he says,

A Prince is pacified, etc. Yea, though he be very obstinate, and hardened in
his anger, yet one shall win him by fair words, as Solomon signifies it
saying, And a soft tongue breaks the Pro. 15. 1
bones. This is agreeable to that which is said: A soft answer appeaseth
anger, etc. This has been proved by David and Saul, and David and Abigael.
Meanewhile this is not to say that one ought 1. Sam. 26. and 25.
to seek by fair words to turn away wrath of kings and great men of the
earth, which is and ought to be kindeled against the wicked to do vengeance
on them: for this should be to resist the ordinance of God, but we ought to
be of so peaceable, humble, and obedient a life, that we may win the hearts of
our superiors: and also it is needeful for us to turn them away from al
tyranny Romans 13.
and cruelty, and that we keep them from animating themselves against other
Princes their neighbors, by good admonitio^s and forewarninges, so to
maintain peace, and to live under them in rest and quietness. And if we
ought to be so heedy, to yield ourselves obedient, and humble to men, by a
far more strong reason we ought to take heed to despite, or murmr against
our God which is our sovereign Prince: for it is an horrible thing to fall into
his hands. Nevertheless his anger is not so hard, but it may be broken by a
soft tongue, if with an affectionate heart we yield him praise, prayers, and
thanks giving, with confession of our faults and offenses, acknowledging that
we are wicked, and that he alone is just: as the ancient fathers before us
have done, to turn away the wrath of the Lord both from them, and from their
neighbors. And amongst others, Daniel. Chap. 9.

16 Have thou found honey? Eat that is sufficient for thee: least thou be
ouerful, and vomit it.
God has given us, al meat to use indifferently with thanks giving, which
thing gluttons and drunkardes cannot do, who are not content to take
sufficient, but devour and swalowe such abundance thereof, and with such
excess, that they almost burst therewith, and are constrained often to cast
their gorge: and which worse is, loose both sense and understanding, as is
daily proved: and so they cannot acknowledge the goods which come from God, too
give him thanks for the same, as belongs to him, wherefore to the end that
we be not unthankful for the benefits which God bestows upon us, let us
use it with temperance and sobriety, and be very circumspect that we take not
too much delight in the goodness and sweetness of the meat, to cause us to
abuse the good creature of God, in using the same excessiuely. Solomon under
the name of honey as it seems, admonishes us of this same, when he says,

Have thou found honey, etc. This sense is not impertinent, and contains good
and necessary doctrine: for there is no meat so good but it hurts us, and
wastes and destroys us, if we take too much thereof. If one fill himself
over full, he is hurt thereby: for the stomach is grieved therewith, and the
understanding (which is worst of al) is over laden and dulled. And so he is in
worse estate then brute beasts, who eating and drinking their fill, yet loose
not their natural sense which God has given them: If men vomit, the meat and
drink is lost. And so gluttons and drunkards destroy themselves, and work
destruction, and in this manner they way not God as they ought to do. For not
only they destroy the goods which he has created for the use of man, but
also in as much as in them lies they deface and abolish the image of god. But
it seems to be more convenient to say that Solomon speaks by similitude,
and that the second part of the same follows, when he says:

17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbors house, least he be weary of thee,
and hate thee.
Now the sense of the similtude is such, as if one said, as honey has a sweet
taste, and therefore men delight to eat it, and give it entry into their
bodies: yet nevertheless if one eat more thereof then is needeful, he
ouerchargeth his stomach, and is forced to vomit. Even so, although it seems
that thy neighbor likes of thee, and that he takes pleasure to have thee
familiarly conversant with him, yet nevertheless take heed to be importunate
upon him, and to trouble him at inconvenient hours, and too often, for fear
least he be weary of thee, and in steed of loving thee, fall to hate thee: and
for a friend, become an enemy. As then, it behooves that in all sobriety and
temperance we use meat and drink, how good and sweet soever it be: even so
what amity and familiarity we have with our neighbors, and though they
declare both in words and deeds to be at our commandment, yet let us take
heed to be curious inquirers of their estate, and not to bind on them as
far as our appetite bids us, as if that which they have were ours to
dispose at our pleasure. Such over boldness engenders hate and enmity, whereof
proceed strife and debate, dissension, and sedition, by the which one is often
forced to cast his gorge, and leave that which he has taken unadvisedly.
Wherefore one may well call the Anabaptists authors of sedition, troublers of
peace, and destroyers of charity, when they would have al goods to be common.
One may also call them blasphemers, when they speak against the holy Ghost,
who has said by Solomon, Withdraw thy foot, etc. For if al things be
common, it is lawful to enter every where, and to use al things at ones
pleasure, and there would be no thieves: and so that would be in vain which
God has said, Thou shall not be a thief. Let us not think that it is laweful
to enter into our neighbors house at our pleasure, no although they have
somewhat of ours, and that we would fetch it away, or have a pledge for the
same. Know we therefore that we are here taught that we ought to spare our
neighbor, Deuteronomy. 24. 10. 11.
and not thrust ourselves forth to inquire of his doings, nor to use his goods
at our pleasure, be he never so much our friend. Our duty is to let him be
master within himself, and use his goods as he list privately, as we would do
ours. By this means amity shall be maintained, and we shall live in peace one
with another. Hereby one may conclude that they which smell and seek out good
cheer, and tarry not til they be bidden, but have the face to present
themselves and sit down at another man's table, are not afraid to be hated:
it is enough for them to satisfy their bellies. Of the number of which are the
begging friars, to whom the world is bounden as they think. And therefore
they are importunate too ask, and go not away for two or three biddinges, but
think that men do them wrong to deny them that which they ask.

18 A man that answers against his neighbor as a false witness, is like a
hammer, a sword, and a sharp arrowe.
Solomon has already often treated of the false witness, he has showed
partly the frowardness of the false witness, and Pro. 6. 19. and 12. 17. and
14. 5. 25.
threatened him destruction, the which he well deserves, as has bin largely
declared. And because it has been but partly, that he has declared his
frowardness, and that it is very needeful to know it better, to the end to
understand that they perish not without cause, and that we may have them in
more disdain, now he sets out their cruelty more plainly. And to do this
same, he names the witness by circumlocution, calling him, A man that
answers, etc. Wherein we have first to note, that although in the scripture,
to answer, is taken often for to speak, not being asked nor provoked by other
words: notwithstanding one may say, that in this place Solomon has regarded
that false witnesses to make their words be taken, come not to speak before
the Judge, until they be called by oath. Secondly let us note, that it is said
expressiuely, Against his neighbor, because the intent of the false witness,
is to hurt his equals, either in goods or in good name, or in his body or in all the three, and has not God in his mind: and yet nevertheless he that
answers against his neighbor, tyeth himself to God, and rises up against
him, to bring him to nothing if it were possible. Solomon signifies it when he
calls him a false witness. For seeing he forsweareth himself, he makes God
the author of lies, and depriueth him of his truth (as much as in him is)
without the which God cannot consist, and so there is great boldness and
temeritie in the false witness, when he wrongeth not man only, but God himself
also who has al power, whom it is impossible to resist. He expresses
afterward his cruelty, making him like to three instruments with the which
men do many murders: for the hammer breaks the bones shiuering the^ into
pieces here and there: The sword cutteth and gives great wounds in the
flesh: The sharp arrowe, pearceth deep, and cannot be easily drawn out,
but the iron will remain in the body. And so the false witness has a tongue
very soft it seems, and which is not other in appearance, but that, which
speaks truth, but it is very hard, very sharp, and very pearcing, when it
murdereth and kills the innocents. It is not therefore without cause that
the Apostle Saint James complains of the tongue.

Now when Solomon accuses the false witness of such cruelty Iam. 3. 6. 7. 8
he shows that he is worthy of death: for he that sheedeth another man's
blood, his blood shall be shed. Then seeing we will be neither thought
murderers, nor be murdered, let us learn to speak Genesis 9. 6.
truth and fly from lying.

19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a broken
tooth, and a sliding foot.
They that have broken teeth eat not as they would, and as necessity
requires: but if they be an hungered, languishe, and cannot remedy themselves
according to their desire. Likewise a lame man which is weak of his feet,
cannot go lightly nor soon dispatch a long journey, nor help another to
pasle it: for his feet are not steadfast, but slide, and lets them fall whom he
thinks to help. This is well known by experience: nevertheless, there is
none so toothlesse, but he thinks to feed well if he have wherewithal, and
there is none which has so great desire to go, as the lame, and weak of
foot, but often the toothles and lame, are both frustrate of their intent, and
chiefly in their most need, even so when one trusts the unfaithful: That is
to say, those which have no fear of God, nor reverence of his word, nor have
any affection of humanity toward their neighbors, nor make it no
difficulty to lie and deceive them, to hurt and betray them: when (I say) one
has confidence in such wicked persons, they eat not when they have need, nor
go not when they should go, that is, they are frustrate of that which they
looked for of them when they fall into tribulation: for they are like a broken
tooth, and a lame foot in the time of need. If they be such toward their
neighbors, it is no marvel seeing they are no more profitable to themselves:
forgiving themselves to al despising of God, and al treason toward their
neighbors: for they promise them that they shall prosper, and be without
harm, and shalbehaue themselves valiantly against al assaults. but they come
to their purpose: for God breaks their teeth, and makes their feet slide,
and stumble. If therefore the unfaithful Job. 4. 8. 9. 10 Psalm. 38. and 58. 7.
Psalm. 37. 18.
have any confidence it is vain, and if we have any in him, we are abused.
And so, it is the surest way to trust only in the Lord.

20 He that takes away the garment in the cold season, is like vinegar
powered upon or Alumme, or Soap.
Nitre, or like him that sings songues to an heavy heart.
When it is very cold, and we will keep our bodies from harm, we put on
clothes enough to keep us warm, and lay them not away willingly, for fear of
catching cold, the which we call the enemy of nature: for without taking away
the garment, the cold being great, pearceth so that one feels it even in his
bones, as may be seen when each man trembles thereat. And when men power
vinegar upon Alum or Nitre (which is unknown to us) they melt it away, for it
loses it hardness. Also if any one have an heavy heart, he has no
pleasure to take pains to comfort him, but rather is vexed and grieved thereat
the more, and chiefly if his heart be froward and malicious, and he do
bite on the bridle, as one would say, and is displeased, and takes it in ill
that he is not come to the end of his wicked enterprises, but is desperate
therewith. Or also when a poor conscience is as it were overwhelmed with the
judgments of GOD, and sees naught but death and hell about him because of his
sins. The more one seeks to comfort such men, the more they are grieved
and vexed, and their sorrow is augmented: for they neither will nor can give
place in their minds to any good word of consolation as is seen by proof.
Notwithstanding the intent of Solomon is not to forbid us to comfort them
which are afflicted in their hearts, by sweet and pleasant words: for God
has given us his word to the end that we should use it: for the consolation
of the sad and sorwful. The Lord comfort the afflicted by the preaching of
his word, when he gives efficacy to the admonitions, exhortations, and
warninges, which are done in his name. Esaias. 40. 1. and 51. 11. 12. and 61. 1.
Iere. 31. 10.
And when the wise instruct the ignorant, and that the strong uphold the
weak, the rich help the necessity of the poor, and those that are in
prosperity have compassion on them that suffer adversity. Solomon therefore
will not keep us from taking care to comfort the miserable and afflicted,
neither gives he us to understand, that consolation is hurful unto them: but
he means that if seeing our neighbors in distress, we laugh at their
misery and rejoice and take pleasure at it, whereas we ought to weep and have
compassion on them, and put ourselves in pain to comfort them, we resemble
those which unclothe their neighbors, when it is cold wether, and which spill
vinegar upon Soap and Nitre. He will not therefore have us sing songues to an
heavy heart. That is to say, he will not have us to laugh and rejoice, when
we see our ueighbours in affliction, for so doing (in as much as in us lies)
we augment their misery, which is a thing very wicked before GOD: as our
Lord Jesus Christ shows us. Wherefore let us obey the Apostle Saint Paul,
who says, Rejoice with Luke. 6. 24. Romans 12. 15. 1. Cor. 12. 26.
them that are merry, and weep with them that are sad. So that it may be
accomplished in us which is said, And if one member endure any thing, all the
other members shall suffer with it. etc.

21 If he that hates thee, be hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he
be their stie, give him water to drink.
So much is it unlawful to take away the garment in a cold day, or sing
songues to the heavy heart, when thy neighbor loves thee (or at leastwise
hates thee not) is in misery and distress, that rather it behooves us to
have pity and compassion on them which wish us evil not only in words and
sound shows, but also indeedes, helping them and succouring them at their
necessity. Joseph did so to his brethren, who had showed him great sign of
hate, and executed Genesis 7. and. 42 1. Sam. 24. and 26.
great cruelty against him. David kept that none should do Saul his enemy
harm, where unto Solomon agrees very well saying,

If he that hates thee be hungry, etc. Jesus Christ commands us the like.
Now as concerning the words of Solomon we have to note, that it seems at
the first show, that he is content, that one make as much account of him
which is his enemy, as of a Dog, to whom likewise we give bread and water:
for he speaks but of giving him bread and water. But one may easily exempt
Solomon from such suspicion, first in saying (as the truth is) that the
Scripture under bread and water comprehends all that which serves to nourishe
the body of man, yea under the only word bread. Secondly in saying that
Solomon has named that which is least esteemed, to show that if one refuse to
give to his enemy bread and water, he will not give him other meats which are
Genesis 3. 19. and 18. 5. and 28. 20. and 39. 6. 7 1. Kin. 13. 8. 2. Kin. 6. 22.
Luke 16. 10
exquisite, nor wine which is sweet and delicate, and to show that if one obey
not in a little thing, he will hardly obey in a greater: according also as our
Lord Jesus Christ says, He that is unjust in a little matter, is also
unjust in a great matter, etc. And though in no other place of the Scripture
are found not bread and water, for all the nourishnent of the body of man, yet
Saint Paul shows us, that we ought to understand this place, for all food:
for he names neither bread nor water, but says simply that one should give
to eat Romans 12. 20.
and drink. Understand we therefore that Solomon teaches us to be merciful
toward our enemies, ministering to the^ according to our power, that which they
have need of. And herein he shows that we ought not to hate any body,
although we be hated, neither do il though we be done ill unto, but rather
render good for evil in all things which are possible for us. Thus doing we
shall be the children of our heavenly father which makes the Sun shine To.
12. 14. 17. 1. Pet. 3. 9 Mat. 5. 45
on the good and on the bad, etc.

22 For thou kindlest coals upon his head, and the Lord shall deliver thee.
The first good that comes of our doing well toward our enemies, is that we
kindle coals, or as Saint Paul says, Heap coals of fire upon their heads:
that is to say, we break their hearts. Insomuch that they are forced to
incline on the one side or on the other, that is to wit, that either by our
benefits their courage is softened, and they induced to love us: or if they
be so cruel that they relent not by our benefits, yet nevertheless they shall
burn and be troubled with the witness of their conscience, which shall feel
it self confused and overcome with our benefits. One may see this token in
Saul, and as Saul finally ceased to persecute David, eue^ so our enemies will
leave of to trouble us, and so we shall not loose the 1. Sam. 21. and 26.
good that we have done them. The second, and which is most profitable for
us, is that the Lord will recompense our benefits: And to perform the same,
not only will give us a temporal good thing for a temporal: but also will
receive us for his children. Our Savior admonishes us to do well to our
enemies, to the end we Mat. 5. 44. 45
may be the children of our father which is in heaven, and if we be children,
we are heirs. And seeing it is an heritage, it follows that God gives us
not that which he owes us: for he cannot Romans 8. 17.
be our debtour: and so the retribution is gratis, and proceeds of his free
liberality, without any merit of ours, as we ought well to acknowledge it:
for we ought not to be otherwise toward our God, then we would that our
children should be toward us, and we would have them still to acknowledge
that they have not deserved the goods which we leave them in possession after
us.

23 As the North wind drives away the rain: so does an angry countenance,
the slaundering tongue.
Whiles the North wind blows not, the Southwinde sends him clouds which
distill rain, even so when a man which is in credit and authority, in power
and superiority, shows himself favorable and courteous, then flatterers,
tale bearers, liars, and backbiters, fear him not, but dare easily come before
him, and think themselves welcome, when in secret they bring him false
reports of their neighbors. Contrariwise, when the North wind which is dry
and impetuous, blows, the clouds are scattered, and yield no rain: even so
when a personage which is in pre-eminence shows himself rude and severe,
rough and rigorous, as though he were always angry, the flatterers which
desire to distill rain of lies and backbitinges, dare not approach to him, but
absent themselves away: for although they seek still to cloak their saying, for
to hide their falsehood, yet nevertheless a virtuous judge can well discover
it, and confound them, so that they dare not appear before him: and when he
has caught them, he will scatter them, as the dry Northern wind brings the
clouds to nothing. Here Solomon shows well to kings and rulers of the earth
that they ought not to laugh, rejoice, and take pastimes at flatterers and
backbiters, but rather to be bitterly angry against the^, and in anger to take
revenge upon them, executing that which David purposed to do, saying, He that
privily slaundeth his neighbor, him will I destroy. He that has a proud look
and high heart, I cannot suffer: Psalm. 101. 5.
and he teaches us that to shun the fury of our Princes, and to be in
their grace and favor, we ought to abstain from lying detraction and
falsehood, for here above it is said that the just man's lips do please
kings, etc. And so one may see that al is out of order, when kings give
entertainment rather to flatterers and backbiters then to men of truth, and
also men seek to please them rather Pro. 16. 12.
by lies then by truth. Let us learn also every one of us not to favor in
any case, liars and backbiters, but rather show them an angry countenance to
give them to understand that we have them in horror and detestation, to the
end that they withdraw themselves from us, and be mute and dumb before us,
if so be it, they will not speak truth. Otherwise we are guilty of lying and
detraction, seeing we take pleasure in hearing them.

24 It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, then with a contentious
woman in a wide house.
We have seen this sentence word by word. Nevertheless this repetition
used of the holy scripture, is not unprofitable, but rather Pro. 21. 9.
necessary, because of our rudeness and negligence, or rather (as concerning
this present sentence) because that commonly women are the more proud and
arrogant, they are the more stout and obstinate in their wickedness, and as it
were enraged, insomuch that they will not rest upon reason, what warning soever
one gives them: and also because men are more attentive to match themselves
with rich women, which are come of a good house and kindred, then to inquyre of
their womanhood and good manners, of their modesty and humility. This avarice
or disordinate desire is marked by the wide house. For these causes I say
Solomon sets again before us this present sentence to reprove men and
women according as they deserve. And as the repetition is not superfluous, so
it shall not be unprofitable to apply to this place present that which was
said in the 21. chap. 9. verse.

25 As are the cold waters to a person fainting for drink: so is good news
from a far country.
When any body has long suffered hunger, and through the long suffering of the
same is waxed faint and out of heart, if he find any cold well of water, or
fresh running river, he takes pleasure to drink thereof, he stencheth his
thirst, he recouereth strength, and is renewed again. Even so if any one have
his friend in a far country and thinks that this friend is very convenient
for him, yea necessary, he will be vexed and grieved greatly, and will as it
were pyne away when his friend has not of long time sent him any news. But
if his friend have a care of him, and if he be diligent to let him
understand of his news, which be pleasant and profitable to him: his grief
will pass, his languor will cease, he is well recreated and refreshed, and
heartily thanketh his friend that has him so in remembrance. Now whiles we
are present in body, we are absent in the Lord, which is the best friend that
we can have. And so in respect of us that walk in this earthly country by
faith and not by sight, our God is in a far country. And if so beit he send us
not and distille down upon us his fresh waters, if he send us not of his
good news, we languishe and are faint through spiritual thirst: with the
which he has threatened the children of Israel. We languish I say, and wax
faint if we have the true knowledge of the bounty, and clemency of our God,
and Amos. 8. 11. 12.
know how great a gift it is to enjoy his word and serve him according to
the same, and not to have liberty to do it in the company of the faithful.
David was seized with such languor and faintness. As he expresses it. If we
will be free from the foresaid Psalm. 42. 2. and. 63. 2.
manace, and not lie long in languor, let us harken to our GOD which inuyteh us
so courteously by his Prophet: All you that are thirsty, come unto the waters,
etc. And to obey him, let us come to Esa. 55. 1. Mat. 11. 28. John. 7. 37.
John. 4. 10. 13. 14.
Jesus Christ, who also inuyteth us, and he will give us of the water of life,
which will keep us from thirst for ever. And also it is he which is sent from
a far. For he descended from heaven, and brought good news to the world.
And as he has begun to bring us this good news, so he continues it by
his ministers, whereof we ought to be ravished in admiration, and make great
account and be joyful saying, How fair are the feet of him upon the
mountains which has pronounced and published peace and goodness, which
preaches salvation, who says to Zyon, thy God raineth, we were very far
from our Lord GOD by our sins and abominations, and likewise we were his
enemies: and yet he has not let to love us, and send us his good news.
And therefore we ought to remember that we which were of late Gentiles in the
flesh, were at that time without Christ, strangers Esa. 57. 10. and 66. 19.
Ephesians. 2. 17. 11
in the common weal of Israel, and strangers of the alliances which contained
promise, etc. But now by Jesus Christ, we which were then a far of, are made
near by the blood of Christ.

26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked, is like a troubled well,
and a corrupt spring.
Men judge by the world that they behave themselves well if they maintain
themselves peaceably with every one, and that chiefly to live in peace, one
should bow down himself before the wicked, flattering them, and favoring
them, and should search all the ways he can to have their grace. They think
they do not ill in thus doing, for they have the Devilish proverb in their
heart and in their mouths which says, that we must live by the quick and
not by the dead. And so they think a just thing to make themselves companions
or rather inferious to the wicked. But such justice is no better then
wickedness it self. Solomon shows it well saying, A righteous man falling
down before the wicked, is like a troubled well, etc. Wherein he shows us
that we ought to persevere in righteousness and integrity, to approve our
justice before God, and before his elect and faithful, Otherwise as the
cleanest and purest fountain of the world is unprofitable, yea noisome and
hurtful, if in treading in it with our feet, or otherwise we trouble it: or
else if one cast into the spring thereof any filth or poison to infect and
corrupt it: Eue^ so if the just man consent to the wicked, to be at his
commandment and service, his righteousness shall be unprofitable to him: and he
will make no conscience to give himself to evil, to be a reproach and hurt to
his neighbors, and to corrupt them: and so he shall be no more righteous, but
wicked and unjust, and as a corrupt spring is despised, and men let it go to
ruin: even so the just man which joins himself to the wicked, and becomes
his peer in turning away from his righteousness, shall perish in his
iniquity. Now one ought not to find it strange, that I say, the just man
turning away Eze. 18. 24.
from his righteousness: for although that God be faithful, and perfourmeth
the work which he has begun in his faithful, to make them continue unto the
end, yet nevertheless as there is in some a temporal faith: so in some there
is a temporal righteousness, as one may see it here when Solomon says, A
righteous man falling Luke 8. 13
down before the wicked, etc. And also as one may see it in the place before
alleged out of Ezechiel. But one may say that many of the ancient holy fathers
have fallen down before the wicked as Abraham, the brethren of Joseph, Jacob.
And Jeremy admonishes king Zedechias and his people to serve the king of
Babylon. The Genesis 23. 7. 12 and. 47. 3. and 33. 3. Iere. 27. 12. Romans 15. 1.
Pet. 2.
answer is, that it is not evil to bow down before the wicked for ceremony,
or to obey God, who puts the wicked in pre-eminence and makes us subject to
them: but it is great wickedness to incline to them, to favor them, and
consent to their iniquities. In the time of the primitive church, the kings
and princes were infidels, and yet nevertheless the Apostles would that men
should be subject to them.

27 It is not good to eat much honey: so to search their own glory, is not
glory.
Man from the beginning of his creation has been constituted in glory and
honor, being created of God to his image and likeness, and having obtained of
him the rule over the earth, and al things therein Genesis 1. 27. 28
contained, but man was not content with such glory, but was curious to exalt
himself further, striving to be like God in disobeiyng Genesis 3.
him, whereby he fell: as he has well perceined when he hid himself
amongst the trees in the garden of Eden. Ecclesiastes has expressed this
glory, and also the fall, saying: I have thought in my Eccle. 3. 18.
heart of the estate of children of men, that God has made them excellent,
yet to see to, they are in themselves as beasts. Now as our first fathers have
not kept themselves in the glory which God has given them, and therefore have
slided: even so their posterity has done after them. One may see it in Cain,
who was not content with the honor of first begotten, but he would rule
cruelly, and killed his brother Abel, and therefore he fell into an everlasting
curse. Pharao Genesis 4.
was not content to rule over the people of Egypt, but he would oppress the
people of Israel, and keep them in bondage, and therefore he perished
wickedly. One may here put Absalom coveting, and gaping for the kingdom of
his father: David numbering his Exo. 14
people: Sennacherib besieging Jerusalem: and others, by whom one may see that
it is not good to search ones own glory. Now that which these here, and
others have proved, Solomon pronounces it when he says, It is not good to
eat much, etc. he says so, because experience has not touched our hearts as
it ought, and that it is very needeful for us to be reproved, and told of that
expressly which we have to follow or forsake. As in this present sentence we are
admonished not to be covetous of glory, otherwise we shall be exposed to
ignominy, as it is well marked, saying, That it is no glory when men search
their own glory. Wherein we have to note that we make great account of them
which are exalted in glory and honor, and esteem them as holy: and if it be
in our own selves, we swalowe it (as one would say) like sweet honey. And
indeed also, it is not a thing to be rejected, that this glory when through
the same we forget not ourselves, nor put not God, nor the duty which we bear
to our neighbors in oblivion, seeing also that God which exalts them in glory
which please him: and if we obtain any degree of honor, it is from him that
we have it: and as one may see it when he promises Abraham to make him grow
into a great nation. Genesis 12. 2. and 45. 8. 1. Chr. 29. 25
And Joseph acknowledges his glory to come from God. And Solomon obtained of
God the glory of the kingdom, such a one that no king before him had the like
in Israel. But as God has given us the honey which is very sweet, and al other
good meats for to maintain and keep us in this life: and yet if we take too
much of it, and use it excessiuely we receive harm thereby: Even so if we be
covetous of honor, and search curiously our own glory, we fall into
ignominy, as one may see it by the examples alleged in the beginning.
Whosoever therefore exalts himself, shall be brought low, yea, by the hand of
God, for he resists the proud.

28 A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a City that is broken
down, and without walls.
Those people that will keep themselves safe from the danger of their enemies,
and be in surety, are careful to munite their towns and cities with strong
and good walls al about, and if peradventure there be any breach made, they
are diligent to repair it, to the end that the enemy have no entrance that
way. Otherwise, if they make no account to enuiron the city with good walls,
it is open to the enemy, and easily destroyed: for the enemies which crave but
the ruin of the same, enter in as they will, and pull it, and sack it at their
pleasure: and so the city is dispatched for lack of walls, which is a
miserable thing. Solomon compares to such a city, the man that refraineth not
his appetite, and so approoueth him very miserable. And therefore that we may
know how to eschew such miserable destruction, we ought to understand what
it is that we have to do, to refrain our own appetite, and to be able to
attain to the same, we have to note that the appetite is taken diversely in
the Scripture. First for the inward part of man, in the which are resident
understanding, thoughts, affections, wills, determinations and counsels. And
because this part is corrupted by sin, it is moved sooner to evil then to
good: wherefore it has need to be restrained, otherwise it brings forth
the destruction of the man, Solomon has showed us this. Contrariwise if the
appetite be refrained, Pro. 16. 18. 19. 32. Mat. 12. 35. 36. 37.
the man is preserved: as Solomon shows also. Secondly, it is taken for the
spirit, that is, the blowing, or breathing of the mouth the which follows the
inward disposition: for of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks: if
the breath be good, good comes to the man: but if it be evil, there
follows destruction. Let us understand therefore that it is very necessary
for us to refrain both our inward and outward spirit or appetite: As also
Saint James admonishes us to do. Iam. 1. 19. 20.


The xxvi. Chapter.
1 AS the snow in the Summer, and as the rain in the Harvest are not meet:
So is honor unseemly for a fool.
AS there are seasons wherein snow and rain are profitable, as proof shows
it: so there are persons who are fit to be exalted in honor, because they can
well use the same, as do the virtuous, fearing God, prudent, sage, discrete,
careful, and diligent to do their duty in all uprightness and integrity,
without any lifting up of their hearts, or rising up above others, to despise
them, molest them, or oppress the^. Honor was very seem ely, for Abraham,
Moses, David, Ezechias, Josias, Daniel, and other holy personages.
Contrariwise, there are seasons wherein snow does great hurt, as when it
comes is Summer, when all the things of the earth have need of heat for to
grow and to wax ripe, the snow that falls, lets them to prosper, for it
cloieth the earth, and the things that she bears. Likewise the rain which
comes in harvest, rotteth the corn and grass which are cut down, lying yet
on the field. Now if we fear the snow in summer, and the rain in harvest,
it behooves us greatly to fear, lest fools be placed in honor and glory.
For as Solomon says, Honor is no more seemly for a fool, then snow in the
summer, and rain in the harvest. If fools be placed in honor, they cloye the
earth: for, as much as in them lies, they take the courage from them, which
otherwise would give themselves to well doing. They freese the goods, for they
hate them which seek to prosper and increase, they rotte the grass and corn:
for as much as they can, they corrupt and destroy al good order, and good
policy, and set and show forth slanders, dissolutions, wantonness,
wickedness, infamy, filthiness, villainy, and abomination: as the wicked
Kings and governors, and the false Prophets have done. And also now a days
the Emperors and Kings, the Pope and his Adherentes do, which tend only to
destruction. Here we have to note first of al, that Kings, and al they which
are in any pre-eminence, or which have any honorable government, ought to be
careful to refrain from al folly and wickedness, and to give themselves to
prudence and sapience, and to do their diligence, to abase and bring down,
yea, to root out the foolish which are so unprofitable and hurtful, that if
they be exalted, and once crept into credit and authority, they serve but as
snow does in summer, and Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
rain in harvest. Secondly, as snow and rain which comes not in season, are
the scourges of God, and his curses: even so let us understand that God is
angry against us, and that he chastizeth us, when Esa 3. 2. and 29. 14. Osee.
13. 11.
we have fools for rulers and governors: as also he gives it us to
understand by his Prophets. Thirdly, that the world asks but her own
ruin and destruction. For as we see commonly, men seek not to have wise men
to rule and govern them, but rather give the authority thereof to fools.

2 As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swallowe by flying escape, so the curse
that is causeless, shall not come.
Men set nets, and prepare snares for birds, who have not deserved it: and
it comes to pass often times that they loose both their time and their labor:
and the birds have no harm, but save themselves and escape away by flying, and
fly away, and so the bird-catchers obtain not always that which they desire,
but are often frustrate of their intentes. Likewise mouths that are full of
curses, strive to hurt the innocent without cause, who never offended the^, but
the goodness of God which is very succourable, serves for feet and wings
to them whom we curse wrongfully, and without cause. Insomuch that the curses
which one casts out against them, never touch them: for God turns it away.
Solomon teaches us this saying,

As the Sparowe by flying, and the Swalowe by flying, escape, etc. David had no
evil through Goliath his curse, nor for the malediction of Semei. Also the
children of God feel no evil for 1. Sam. 17. 43. 2. Sam. 16. 5. Mat. 5. 11. 44.
the curse of the wicked: as Jesus Christ shows us well, but their curses
return rather unto themselves, and they bear the pain thereof by the just
judgment of God, as Goliath well proved it: for David cut off his head with his
own weapon. Semei also proved it. And in many places God has threatened
malediction and punishment to them which curse without cause. Those therefore
1. King. 2. 42 Genesis 12. 3. and 27. 29. Exo. 21. 17. Leuit. 20. 9 Pro. 20. 20.
Psalm. 109. 17 2. King. 19. 6
which at randon and without just occasion curse their neighbors, curse
themselves, and hurt not them awhit whom they curse, nevertheless they force
not of it, wherefore they well deserved punishment. And thus while we are
taught not to fear their curses: as the Prophet Esai admonishes King
Ezechias, and his folks. And note we, that it is not said in general, that
the curse shall not happen, But the unreasonable curse, or the curse without
cause: for if one curse us justly, it is to be feared, that we shall feel the
hurt of it, yea, by the just vengeance of God, which will hearken to the cry of
them that curse us. For this cause Ecclesiastes admonishes Eccle. 4. 5. 6.
us not to give occasion to any body to curse us: for the prayer (says he)
of him that curses thee, in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard of him
that created it. And this is in following that which Moses pronounces, and as
by witness we see, that the curse uttered for good cause, comes to pass,
even so, Deu. 15. 9.
we have examples thereof. Moses prayed against Core: Ely cursed the
messengers of King Ochosias: Elisee, cursed the young Number. 16. 15.
children, and two Bears to are twenty and two of them in pieces. Saint
Peter cursed Ananias and Sapphira, and they fell 2. Kin. 1. 10. and 2. 24. Act.
5. 3. 4. 9. and 13. 10
down dead: Saint Paul cursed Elymas, and he became blind.

3 As the whip is for the Horse, and the bridle for the Ass: so is the rod
for the fools back.
It is written, I will give thee understanding, and will teach Psalm. 32. 8. 9.
thee the way wherein thou shall walk, etc. And this is to the end that we be
not fools, and without reason: as also we are warned thereof, Be not as the
Horse, or Mule which are without understanding. Otherwise, as men tame Horses,
Asses, and Mules by bridles, spurs and whippes, or by other means, even so
the Lord has ordained chastisementes and punishments for to tame fools, and
root them out if they be incorrigible. As one may see by the P^al. 2. 9. and
89. 31.
threatninges which are in the scriptures, and now here when it is said, As
the whip is for the Horse, etc. Now even as great Lords, for to tame their
Horses and other beasts, have men to whom they give the charge thereof: even
so our God has his men to whom he commits the charge of guiding them,
which have need to be tamed: he has given to his Prophets and Apostles, to
his Ministers and Pastors his word, which is a cutting sword, more sharp
then any two edged sword. This word has been committed, I say, to the
Prophets and Apostles, and to Hebr. 5. 12. Esai. 49. 2. Ier. 1. 9. 10. 2. Cor.
10. 4. Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2. Pro. 13. 24. and 22. 15. and 23. 13. 14. Pro. 1. 26.
al Ministers for the chastisement, yea, for the destruction of the rebellious.
He has given Kings and Princes, Superiors and Governors, the rod of
iron, to wit, the sword, to chastise fools. He has also ordained that
fathers and mothers should correct their children. Briefly, all those, which
have any pre-eminence or superiority, have charge from God to chastise the
foolish which are committed to their charge. That if the foolish remain
incorrigible and obstinate, they shall not only feel the temporal rod, but
as one is constrained to murder and kill the Horse which will in no wise be
tamed, even so the fools that are obstinate, shall perish everlastingly. And
as an horse which will not be tamed, overthrows his master, eue^ Eze. 3. 18.
so, when one corrects not the foolish, he goes to perdition as he well
deserves, and as it is well given us to understand. And although the foolish
be not corrected, yet they cease not to perish, Saint Paul shows it. It is
meet then that the great men which Romans 2. 12.
are in authority and power, and those which have superintendance and
government, be wakeful, and heedie, to use the rod which God has given
them, in chastizing, and punishing, in admonishing, and reproouing, correcting
and threatening: and that inferiors and al they which know not how to guide
themselves, should submit themselves to that discipline which is convenient for
them. For if brute beasts which have neither sense nor reason, endure to be
tamed, it is good reason that men who ought to have understanding, be not more
wild and sauagde, to the end that, that be not laid against them, which
Moses rebuked the children of Israel with. He which ought to be righteous, is
waxen fat, and has kicked with his heel. And though that God has his
servants to tame and chastise Deu. 32. 15. Esai. 1. 2.
fools, yet nevertheless they profit nothing, if he himself put not to his
hand, as Moses well shows. For although that he admonishes the children of
Israel, Circumcise the forepart of your Deuteronomy. 10. 16
hearts, etc. He shows them notwithstanding afterward that his admonition
is nothing, if God himself work not, when he says, The Lord thy God shall
circumcise thy heart, etc. Even so Dent. 30. 6. Ier. 31. 18. 19.
does the Prophet Jeremy.

4 Answer not a fool according to his foolishness, lest thou also be like to
him.
Men see by experience in this world that fools have power, credit, and
authority, that they are at their ease and prosperity, according to outward
appearance. And for this cause men doubt them and fear them: or else have them
in admiration, and desire their alliance under hope that they shall be well
advanced, and profit by their means. But be it for fear, or for hope, men
favor and flatter them, and seek to covenant and agree with them, without
displeasing them any way. And whereas they commit great wickedness, men will
say to them it is well done, yea, they will encourage them to follow their wicked
enterprises: as the flatterers did Saul, against David, and them which favored
him, and gave him aid and succor. They did this, to be welcome to Saul who
was a wicked fool. And therefore those which do so, are wicked and foolish,
as them to whom they consent and accord. Solomon will not have us to resemble
them: as he shows, when he says, Answer not a fool, etc. To answer, in
this case, is not to satisfy in words any question or demand: but it is to
fulfill, covenant, and accord to the will and appetite of another. For why the
scripture applies it self often to our manner of speaking: for if any one will
say, that two things accord and agree well together, he says, that they
answer well one to an other. Contrariwise, if any one condescend not to our
opinion, we say, that he answers not our purpose: and this is because if
one ask us of any thing which we know, and which pleases us, we answer
willingly: but if it displease us, we nodde the head, and vouchsafe not to
open the mouth to answer. And we understand that Solomon would that we
should disdain fools, and that we should show no sign of consenting to
their folly, otherwise we are in danger to be put in a reprobate sense, and to
be abandoned to al folly. For if evil talk corrupt good manners: the
conversation and accord which we have with the foolish, will make us fools
and wicked, according to the foolishness and wickedness 1. Cor. 15. 33.
which we shall see, and to the which we consent: as with thieves, one
becomes a thief: and with Idolaters, and Idolater. Wherefore we ought to
take careful heed that we answer not Papists and other heretics.

5 Answer a fool according to his foolishness: lest he be wise in his own
conceit.
It seems at first view, that this sentence is quite contrary to the
former. Nevertheless it is not lawful to think nor say that there is any
contrariety: for they are spoken both by one and the same spirit of truth,
which can not be contrary. Wherefore we ought here to take answer otherwise
then in the former sentence. For if one condiscended to the fool, and accorded
to his folly, he gives him occasion to esteem himself wise: which Solomon
will not have done, no more then he will that we be like unto them. And therefore
note we, that the fool seeks wholly to persuade himself that he is wise,
and can not abide one to reprove him, nor reprehende him for his folly. For
this cause, to the end that as much as in us lies, we suffer not the fool to
be so abused. Solomon admonishes us to answer him according to his folly:
that is to say, to rebuke him, and tell him sharply and severely, that there is
nothing but folly in him, and that he is void of al wisdom. Thus doing, he
will know that he is a fool, and will seek to amend himself, if so be it, he
be not altogether incorrigible, and of the number of them which are sharply
rebuked and threatened. We have therefore to answer and resist the Papists, and
principally the most Pro. 1. 24.
esteemed: for, because they are not resisted, but that the ignorant people
favors them, and has them in admiration, they wax so proud, and it seems
them, that they are wise men of the world. And note we, that Solomon speaks
principally to them which have pre-eminence, or super intendance.

6 He that sends a message by the hand of a fool, is as he that cutteth
off the feet, and drinks iniquity.
It is very meet and necessary, that one be well advised and careful to take
heed, whom he puts in trust to do his business, and chiefly those which
are of great importance. See Pharao King of Egypt, who having considered the
wisdom and understanding of Joseph, made him ruler and governor over his
country. Also Nabuchodonozer having seen the great understanding of Daniel,
honored him, and made him governor. It behooves one therefore Genesis 41. 28
Dan. 2. 48. Exo. 18. 21
to be careful to regard who those be which are fit and capable to deal in
affairs, and to commit them to their charge: as Iethro tells Moses. Saint
Paul declares it plainly. 1. Tim. 3. and Tit. 1. and in other places. If one
do contrary, not only he labors in vain, but also has hurt thereby, as
Solomon shows it, when he says,

He that sends a message, or he which commits his affairs, etc. If he
have damage thereby, he well deserves it. For (as we see here) in committing
any affairs to fools, one does them injury: seeing it is as though he cut
off their feet, and constrained them to go. Now he that does such injury
or violence to his neighbor, meriteth well to drink the iniquity, and
sustain the loss: they therefore which favor the wicked, and to advance
them, place them in office, do them injury, and violence: for they lay upon
them a charge which they cannot well weild, but as a man which has his feet
cut off, so that he cannot go, to bear any message from far: and as such
a one does rather fall and hurt himself, than go: even so the wicked cannot,
nor will not do their duty, when they have any commission: and therefore they
go to ruin and destruction, and they which so have cut their legs off,
remain not unpunished, but drink the iniquity. If therefore we love the
profit and health of our neighbors, and our own, let us not put to charge or
office those whom we know to be fools, and wicked persons.

7 Lift up the legs of a lame man: so shall be a sentence in a fools mouth.
Lame men have commonly one leg long, and another short: whereof it comes
that they cannot go at their ease, nor as they would: and so their going is
not pleasant. And though one seek to help them in lifting up the one of their
legs or both, yet they go never a whit the better. Likewise if fools study
to pronounce any thing of excellency, they cannot compass it, nor their
words are not acceptable, but to them only which are like unto them, and
although they have some which by flattery seek to give them heart to say well:
Yet nevertheless their words are not amended. Solomon makes such a
comparison, saying,

Lift up the legs, etc. The which comparison is very convenient for although
the fool have but one mouth, yet when he forces himself to speak well, he
halteth. For as one leg of a lame man, or one side when he walks,
answers not the other and is not agreeable too it: even so when the fool
will meddle to speak well, his mouth is not agreeable to his heart. He has a
short heart as concerning excellent things indeed: for he dispiseth and
rejects them, and fills himself with affections, thoughts, wills, and
determinations out of order, and by hypocrisy and ambition, seeks to stretch
his mouth to things, by the which he may be in admiration, to the end that
men may say of him as of Herod, The voice of a God, and not of a man. But mean
while, Act. 12. 22.
as they which have a clear sight, know well that the lame man's going is not
good: Even so, they which have the understanding of the truth, discern
easily between that which is well, and that which is ill said, although one
seek never so to disguise himself. Behold the children of Israel boasted
themselves to be the people of God, and made profession to serve him: but Ely
filled with the spirit of god, knew well that they were lame, what fair
sacrifices soever they made: and therefore he said to them: How long will you
halt 1. Kin. 18. 21
on both sides? Wherefore if we will speak uprightly of things which are
worthy to be heard, it behooves us to put of al folly, and receive the
instruction of wisdom to frame our hearts well, to the end that a sentence may
be fit for our mouths.

8 As a precious stone closed up in a heap of stones: so is he which gives
glory to a fool.
If we find it strange and without al reason that one should hyde amongst a
great heap of common stones, a precious stone, because it is a rare thing, and
men make much account of it: for it has other virtues then the rest, and is
more delectable to the sight, and while it is thus enclosed, it is almost
impossible to find it, and lies to no use, for one has neither profit, nor
pleasure thereby: Even so we ought to think it an unreasonable thing to see
fools esteemed, and exalted to glory, for glory is an excellent gift of God
which exalts them that seem worthy. And those which desire it, have not
still the inioying of it, but are often cast off, and deprived of it utterly.
And in steed of glory, reap contempt, rebuke, and ignomie. For fools know
not how to use glory according as it is appointed by God, but rather abuse
it, when in steed of giving themselves to gravity, virtue, magnanimity,
prudence and wisdom, Pro. 25. 27
they follow lightness, vice, pusillanimitie, blockishnes, vanity, and
folly: and so their glory can be neither profitable nor delectable, no more
then a precious stone which is enclosed so far in a heap of stones, that one
cannot come by it. Wherefore they which have power to distribute states and
degrees, are here taught, that if they will not loose the precious stone, they
should take heed not to advance fools, malicious persons, dissolute and loose
livers, nor any such: because it is a thing lost. For as one cannot see a
precious stone shine, which is enclosed in a heap of common stones, as well for
the multitude, as for the grosenesse and weight of the stones which are upon
it: even so, the foolish abound so much in vanities and follies, in filth and
infamy, in scandales, and dissolutions, in malices and wickedness, and are so
wayghed down with the same: that they darken, and adnihilate the glory in
which they are placed: for they themselves think, say, and do, things which
tend to the extinguishing of it. And so they are wholly un worthy: yea, what
greatness or nobleness soever they have, yet they are notcapable thereof: no
more then it is to hide a precious stone in a heap of stones be it never so
great. Saul was mighty and puisa^t, and yet nevertheless he showed himself
unworthy of the glory 1. Sam. 9. 1. 2. and 15. 11 23. and 16. 1. 1. Sam. 16. 7
12. 13.
of the kingdom. David's brethren were greater then he, and yet they were
dejected, in that they were not anointed, and David the least of them al was
anointed for King. Even so, although the Pope have power and authority, yet
nevertheless, he is not capable of the glory which the world gives him.

9 As a thorn standing up in the hand of a drunkarde, so is a parable in the
mouth of fools.
The man that is given to drink much, and so is drunk, is so blockish, dull,
and foolish, so void of sense, reason, understanding and feeling, that he
sees not commonly, nor knows not what it is that he has or holds in his
hand, nor how he ought to use that which he has between his fingers. He
makes no more difficulty to gripe in his hand a sharp thorn, then he does a
soft feather, and will give it to kiss to them who^ he meets, as if it were a
nosegaye of flowers, or sweet smelling herbs. And in this wise he shows
that he cares not what harm he do to himself, nor to his neighbors: but as
he pricketh himself, so he pricketh and spoyleth them which do him no hurt,
and which likewise desire that he were in sound estate and good disposition.
And so we see that the drunkarde leads a miserable and wicked life: whereby
it appears that one ought to have drunkenness in great horror and
detestation, and fly the company of drunkardes, as a mad Lion, or any savage
beast. Now if we ought to take heed, of a thorn standing up in the hand of
a drunkarde, because he cannot handle it as he ought: even so we ought to
understand, that fools words are very dangerous. As Solomon pronounces it,
saying,

As a thorn standing up, etc. Wherein we have to note, that as the drunkarde
makes no difficulty to prick his neighbors, and hurt them with some thorn,
or other sharp instrument which he has in his hand: even so the foolish are
hardy and rash to pronounce words, or speeches which are yrksome, grievous,
or hurtful to their neighbors. And that in diverse sorts: for some speak to
their neighbors, making no show to hurt them, and yet secretly practice their
death. As Cain dealt with his brother, when they were together on the field.
Cain rose up against his brother Genesis 4. 8. 2. Sam. 3. 27. and 20. 9. 10 and
11. 6. Mat. 26. 49. and 22. 15. Genesis 39. 17 Mat. 26. Luke 23.
Abel, and killed him. Ioab killed Abner in treason: the same Ioab killed also
Amasa by treason. David used such faynednesse toward Vrias. Judas and the
Pharisees toward Christ. Other backbite and defame in secret, as those which
in the absence of David spoke ill of him to Saul. Others bear false witness,
as Iosephes masters wife: and the Jews against Jesus Christ. Others speak
openly foul words and outrages against the innocent, as if they were greatly
worthy of blame, as they did to the Prophets, to Jesus Christ and his
Apostles, and as they do presently to the true servants of God. And (which is
the most sharp and pricking thorn of al) some bear about false doctrine, the
which pricketh the souls to death. And so the mouth of Papists is the most
dangerous, and they are the wickeddest and woorst fools of the world. One may
add those Magistrates who insteede of pronouncing equity, make unlawful
ordinances, and give wrong judgment. We have also to note, that as the
drunkarde pricketh himself, even so fools words are their own destruction:
as it has been already showed, both by witness and examples. Forasmuch
therefore, as we will not be reputed drunkardes, nor fools, let us look that
we cast away thorns, and carry sentences which are not pricking, and that no
word pass out of our mouth which is not sound, pleasant, and amiable, to
the glory and honor of God, and to the edification and health of us and our
hearers. And this is that which appertains principally to Ministers of the
word, and to them which are committed to do justice and judgment, and this,
toward them which yield themselves tractable and ready to be taught. For we
ought to use thorns against them which are obstinate and incorrigible: not
fearing to incur the note of drunkenness or of folly. Some said, that
Jesus Christ had Beelzebub, that he was a glutton, Mat. 12. 24. and 11. 19 Act.
2. 13.
a drunkard, and a friend to them that lived wickedly. And that the Apostles
were drunk, but being ass^^^d that they walked uprightly, they let not to
prick where it was needeful. So ought al they to do, which have any
administration, to guide themselves uprightly in prudence and wisdom.

10 The mighty man does al things by himself: but the fool gives wages,
yea, he gives wages to the transgressors.
When Solomon praises the man that is great and excellent in virtue, insomuch
that he is sufficient of himself to do his office and duty, even so he does
it, and applies himself thereto carefully: and to express this same, he
says, That he does al things: and blames the fool which hireth folks to
do his business. It may seem at first view, that Solomon reputeth the^
fools that have hired servants under them, to do their work in the house,
or in the town, or in the field: and herein he should blame the good ancient
Fathers, and good Kings which have had a multitude of persons in their wages,
and himself also, for he had no small company to serve him, as the holy
history recites. But Solomon's intent was not such. For also it is lawful,
yea necessary that they Eccle. 5. 10 Exodus 18.
which have much to do, set many about it, to help and aid them. For what
force, virtue, or sufficiency soever they have, they cannot perform al. And
chiefly when a man has store of goods, he uses deeds of charity when he
hyreth poor folks to let them gain their bread, and paieth them their wages
faithfully. It behooves also, as there where are many goods, are many eaters:
so there where are many things to do, must be many workers, as Iethro shows
it to Moses. Solomon's intent therefore is to praise them, which are so grown
and augmented in virtue, that feeling their ablenes they will not be idle, but
rather of free courage employ themselves to do al things which are for their
calling and duty: and so they put the talents of the Lord to profit. And
contrariwise, his meaning is to blame the foolish naughtipackes, which despise
al virtue, and also are void thereof: and therefore they neither can nor will
apply themselves to their work, but rather hire folks for wages, not regarding
if they be sufficient, or if they have courage to do well. As Solomon marketh
it, when he says, That the fool gives wages to the transgressors. That is,
to them which pass over or above that which is their duty, despising it, and
rather giving themselves to do the contrary. And herein is accomplished the
common proverb, Like master, like man. Understand we therefore, that it
behooves us to increase daily in virtue, to the end we may need no Vicar,
Suffragan, nor Liefetenant, but that having negligence and sloth in disdain,
and despising al ease, delight, and pleasure of carnal rest, we may give
ourselves carefully to do our duty, yea, when for the same, we must endure
afflictions and calamities, injuries and wrongs, reproach and ignomie. Let us
follow Moses who carefully and faithfully did his duty, what difficulties
soever came, as one may see it in the scriptures.

Now although such care appertain chiefly to greatme^ of the earth (as likewise
the first word of this sentence signifies it, the which we have expounded
mighty, and one may term it, Master, Lord, Number. 12. 7 Hebr. 3. 2. 5. and
11. 24.
excellent and virtuous) and that it apperteineth also to al the^ which have
any government or superintendance: for they ought above al men to acknowledge
the honor wherein God has placed them, and not to be unthankful for the same,
as Kings and Princes of the earth, which are fallen a sleep in their own
delights, and drunk with worldly pleasures, pleasing themselves in their own
loftines: and meanewhile make no account to do their duty, but hyre men for
wages, yea, negligent men who most commonly ouerturne right. And although the
Pope and his great Minions, Cardinals, and Bishops, be not so exalted by
God, but rather by the Devil, whom they serve and do homage too: yet
nevertheless, because they vaunt themselves to be Vicars of Jesus Christ, and
successors of the Apostles, which were men sufficient enough to do their
office, and applied it: for this cause we will put them in the rank and number
of fools, which do nothing but have their Vicars, and suffragans, the which
they hyre for benefices, and take no care if they be honestme^ or no, for why
they will have the^ no better tha^ themselves: and if they were honestmen, they
would not be served with such, but rather would burn them. Although (I say)
that greatmen above al others, ought to be careful to do their duty
themselves: yet nevertheless, it is meet that al they that are called to the
knowledge of the truth, and make profession to be Christians, be careful to
employ themselves faithfully to do al things which are for their estate,
duty, and office: as we are well taught the same in the similitude of
talents. Meanewhile let us take heed of such pride and presumption, Mat. 24.
and 25. 2. Cor. 3. 5 Phil. 2. 13.
not to esteem ourselves so mighty, that of ourselves we may fulfill that
which is our duty: seeing we are not able enough to think any thing of
ourselves, as of ourselves, but our ableness and might is from God. It is also
he which woorketh in us both the will and the effect, according to his good
pleasure. Also when Solomon says, That the mighty man does, etc. He will
not establishe free will, but that we should give ourselves to work, without
trusting to our neighbors. For God appoints us not, making us virtuous and
able, to live without doing any thing, and passing away the time pleasantly,
but that we labor al our time.

11 The fool which begins his folly afreshe, is like a Dog returning to
his own vomit.
By the corruption and wickedness of our nature we are despoiled of the true
knowledge of God, without the which we have neither religion nor reverence, nor
fear of him, so that we are deprived of al wisdom, and are fools, without
sense, reason, and understanding. And there is none but of himself is such a
one, what worldly wisdom soever he have, for all the imagination of the
thoughts of the heart of man, are only evil at al times, and Genesis 6. 5. and
8. 21. Psalm. 14. 1. 2. 3.
the conceiving of the heart of man, is wicked from his youth up. And therefore
David makes great complaints thereof: and so of ourselves we are ignorant,
blind, wicked and naughty, and can not be otherwise, until such time as God
lighten and regenerate us, giving us true intelligence of his word, and
reforming our hearts, to the end we may live after the same: for this word
is our understanding and wisdom: and therefore we ought to receive it, and
imprint it in our hearts, to the end it may make us vomit all the folly of
our natural corruption, and that we may be well purged from our filthiness and
infections, and that we vomit it in such sort, that we never return
theretoo again, but that we have it in horror and disdain, and that we fly
it as poison, and fear it as a mortal pestilence: otherwise our later
condition would be far worse then the former, and we should give Satan a
more easy access then he had before. Solomon marketh us out Mat. 12. 43. 2.
Pet. 2. 20
the corruption, and return to the same, when he says, The fool which
begins his folly afreshe. And after he notes the miserable condition,
saying, Is like a Dog returning to his own vomit. Wherein we have to note
first of al, that it is not without cause that he calls men foolish: for
from the beginning he has forsaken his Creator from whom comes al wisdom.
Now if for this cause he merit to be called fool, by a more reason he is well
worthy of this name, when having bin instructed in the word of truth, which is
the true wisdom: he returns to his folly: for in so doing he apostateth, and
reuolteth from wisdom, to whom afterward he cannot have recourse. For those
which once have bin lightened and have tasted the sweet word of God, if they
fall again, it is impossible that they should be renewed by repentance, etc.
Secondly we have to Hebr. 6.
note, that although God have eternally reproved the folish which apostate and
revolt from wisdom, and that the first cause of their apostacy is eternal
reprobation: yet nevertheless, God ought not to be so blamed in no wise for
their apostacy. For it is the fool which begins his folly afresh: as
Solomon shows it, etc. Thirdly note we, that although the elect of God after
being called to the knowledge of the truth, commit follies, either through
wickedness, or by ignorance or fragilitie, yet nevertheless they begin not
their folly afresh: as we may see it here, when Solomon compares the fool
which begins his folly a new, to the Dog which eats that which he has
vomitted: for there are none but the reprobate which are like to such dogs.
For although such dogs, after receiving again that which they have vomited,
do not return to it again: even so the reprobate being gone back from the
holy commandment, which they have received, do never return by repentance.
But the elect of God are not denied repentance: as the scripture does witness
in diverse places: and as there are thereof diverse examples: and their last state
is better then the first: for they obtain forgiveness of their sins by the
precious blood of Jesus Christ: but the reprobate lie still wallowing in their
filthiness: and are like not only unto dogs, but also unto swine, which
after their washinges, 2. Pet. 2. 22.
do return to wallow in the mire. Therefore, when we are delivered from the
filthiness of the world, through the knowledge of the word of God, let us see
that we accomplish our salvation in Mat. 12. 34. 32. Hebr. 6. 4. and 10. 26.
fear and trembling: for if we return unto our foolishness, sinning against
the holy Ghost, we can not obtain forgiveness of our sins.

12 See thou a man wise in his own conceit? more hope is of a fool then of
him.
We naturally do desire to be well esteemed and accounted of amongst our
neighbors, and would have men to hope well of us. This desire is good and
co^me^dable, so that in attaining the effect thereof, we behave and govern
ourselves, in the fear of God, and reverence of his word, with humility and
modesty toward our neighbors, and that we may truly protest with David,
Lord, I am not high minded: I have no proud looks, etc. For if we think to
set forth ourselves, Psalm. 131. 1
and to be esteemed as being wise and able enough to win reputation, not
needing to be admonished nor rebuked: and that we be so puffed up with our
worldly and carnal wisdom, that we can abide no admonition, nor correction,
we deprive ourselves of al good reputation, and are in the way to be counted
worse then fools, which are so corrupted, that they have no mind nor desire
after wisdom, nor to get reputation. And indeed, they which think
themselves wise enough, are worse to be corrected and reformed then fools,
which are utterly void of wit and reason. Solomon does so pronounce it,
saying, See thou, etc. This thing has been proved, as the scripture
shows. The Scribes and Pharisees thought themselves just and wise, and
thereby remained obstinate and hardened, and would not receive Jesus 1. Cor.
1. 30 Mat. 3. 7. and 9. 9. and 12. 3. and 15. 13. and 21. 31. and 23 13. Luke
7. 29. and 15. 1. 2. and 16 14. 15. and 19 2. Pro. 3. 5. 6. 7. Romans 12. 16.
Esai. 5. 21. Luke 16. 15. 1. Pet. 5. ^. 1. Cor. 3. 18 19. Col. 3. 12. Phil. 2.
3.
Christ, who of God is made unto us wisdom. But the Publicans and
whoremongers did confess their follies and wickednesses, and repented their
sins, and believed in Jesus Christ, receiving him for their redeemer and
Savior: but those Scribes and Pharisees, which were wise in their own
conceit, scorned him, refused him, and persecuted him unto death. For this
cause are they sharply rebuked, threatened, and condemned, and the tolegatherers
and whoremongers, are comforted, and receive hope to be saved Therefore if we
would that men should conceive a good hope of us, let us follow that which
Solomon does teach us, saying: Trust thou in the Lord with all thine heart,
and lean not unto thine own wisdom, etc: and S Paul says, Be not high
minded, etc. Otherwise, though the world were dazeled with our pomp and fair
show, yet should we be little the better for it: for we can not deceive God
which resists the proud, abhors the high minded, and curses the arrogant.
We see therefore, that it is very necessary for us to follow the
aduertisements of Saint Paul: If any amongst you seem wise, let him become a
fool in this world, that he may be made wise. Moreover, let us note, that
when Solomon says, More hope is of a fool then of him, etc. This is no more
to say, that he allows folishnes to cause us to continue therein: then when S.
Paul says, that where sin abou^ded, Romans 5. 20.
there did grace more abou^d: he allows not sin, neither would he have us to
continue therein, that grace might abound: otherwise Solomon should build
that which he had destroyed, and destroy that which he had builded. Let us
understand then that Solomon compares him, which praises himself, and will
not suffer too be admonished, with him that suffers himself to be carried
away of his unbridled concupiscences, and yet does presume nothing of
himself, whom he calls fool: and pronounces that we ought rather to
hope for the amendment of such a fool, then of him which thinks himself to
be wise. And thus he does closely admonish us, to forsake our foolishnes, that
me^ may not hope in Pro. 22. 1
vain of us, and that we should obtain good fame and renown: the which is
more to be desired the^ great riches. And thus we may desire it, so it be done
without ambition, and only seeking the glory of God, and the profit of our
neighbor: and not to be praised therefore, Mat. 6. 23.
and to be made a wonderment, for to be worshipped: as do the hypocrites,
whom Jesus Christ taxes.

13 The slothful man says, A Lion is in the way: a Lion is in the streets.
When God does command or forbids us any thing, or that he does place us
in any estate, and calls us unto any vocation, we must employ ourselves
therein with all care and diligence, without stopping or lingering to consider
the hurtes, or fear the dangers which may happen: following the good old
fathers: as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Likewise God showed unto Moses that we
must not strive against that which God commands, and will have no man to leave
of his charge which he has given him, Ge. 12. and 31* Exo. 4. 11 Ier. 1. 7. 17
for fear of dangers. But they which will neither obey God nor their
superiors, but will live after their fantazie, and to do little, or nothing,
are ready to allege excuses, and to lay for themselves the dangers which are
to be feared and avoided, as they think. We must not follow the example of
such, except we would be Mat. 10. 28.
counted amongst the number of the slouthful, and to be blamed with them: as
we see that Solomon does rebuke them, saying, The slothful man says, a Lion,
etc. Wherein he shows that they which will not do their duty, do forge
fantastical excuses, without knowledge that it is so indeed. For he says
not, that the slouthful knows that the Lion is in the way, but only that the
slouthful man says it. And for to show how the slothful man is very
desirous to make excuses, he repeateth again his saying. Amongst the number
of such slouthfulmen, we may place the Nichodemites, which do carefully
excuse themselves for that that they know not what shall happen and betide
them, and think thereby to be excused from making confession of their faith.

Now that we may not be of the same number, let us assure ourselves of the
promise of our Lord, Behold I give you power, Luke. 10. 19
to tread upon Serpents, and Scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy,
and nothing shall hurt you. Now that they which disdain and refuse to do
their duties, do not know whether the dangers for the which they excuse
themselves from labor, are present, or to come. Solomon does show it when he
says.

14 As the door turns upon his henges, so does the slothful man upon his
bed.
When the slouthful man remooueth not out of the house, no more then the door
which hangs upon his henges, yea does not stir out of his bed, turning and
tossing now on the one side, and now on the other: as does the door which
is put to and fro, does not remove from his place, but does turn hither and
thither upon his henges, he cannot certainly know what is done in the
streets) but does fear pain so much, and likes so well of the rest, that he
forgeth in himself excuses, by the which he labors to show, or also to
make himself believe, he has good cause to abstain from labor.
Notwithstanding he is not without pain, neither has such rest as he would:
otherwise he would not seek it as he does, turning himself in his bed:
for if he rested after his desire, and at his ease, he would not turn so
often from one side to another: but he tosseth and turns seeking the rest
that he has not. And so they which pass not of doing their duty and office,
cease not to be without pain, though they labor to avoid it: albeit they
have none without, yet do they feel it within: and though they are not
troubled with those that apperteine nothing to their charge, yet are they vexed
and molested with their household. Nevertheless let us not think that Solomon
would rebuke al them which turn them in their beds for to take the better
rest: for it is lawful for them which have labored sore in the day, to take
their rest at night, that they may be the better disposed on the morrow after
for to do their duty: but he blames those which do eschew and fly pain
and labor, and does declare them to be unprofitable: as also he does again
immediately, following, when he adds.

15 The slothful hides his hand in his bosom, and it greeueth him to put it
again to his mouth:
And heerewith he shows that through his slothfulness he must needs come
unto great misery, as has been declared. But it seems that Solomon speaks
here, somewhat by an Ironie, and after our kind of speech. For if we see
any man which willingly abstaineth from labor, though he be a strong and
bold eater, and that he spares not his hand for to thrust it often to his
mouth, yet in mocking him, and rebuking him for that he is not quick and
nimble, but to eat and drink, we say unto him, Thou labourest sore, and
take great pains to lift thy hand to thy mouth. He sweateth (will some say)
for pains he takes in eating. And we must not wonder though Solomon does
scorn and floute the slouthful: for they do well deserve it, seeing they will
eat their bread in idleness, which is not lawful.

16 The sluggarde is wiser in his own conceit, then seven men that can render
a reason.
He shows well that slothfulness is a very dangerous vice, and that if a
man delight therein, he waxes obstinate and indurate: in such wise as it
seems there is no good, nor better, nor more goodly estate then to live
without doing of any thing, and in being idle, They are flouted which let
themselves out to hyre, setting themselves diligently on work: neither can
such as will not work, endure their exhortations, admonitions, and corrections
which do reasonably, and as behooves exhort them to labor, and to set
themselves on work, for to do their duty, and to give good example unto
their neighbors. Of the number of such slouthful persons, which are so wise in
their own conceit, are the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and Monks,
which labor too make themselves believe that they lead an angelical and
perfect life, in doing nothing but only occupied about an heap of trifles,
yea vngodlinesses. For though the Lord should raise them up seven, that is to
say, diverse persons that can give a reason, as well in laboring as in exhorting
them, yet would they nothing esteem it, but would rather despise them, yea
persecute them: as we may see by the fires thar are daily kindeled. In the
same number we may set whooremongers, gluttous, drunkardes, and gamesters.

17 He that passes by and medleth with the strife that belongs not unto
him, is as one that takes a dog by the ears.
As God hates and abhors him that sows strife between brethren: even so
also he loves and accepts him that is careful Pro. 6. 19 Mat. 5. 9.
for to make peace between brethren: yea he accounts him for his child:
for blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Whereupon it may seem (as also it is the truth) that there is no strife but
that we should labor to appease and quiet it, when we once know of it, and
are come where it is, and that we have the power to reconcile the parties
together which are at discord, though the persons do nothing at al belong unto
us, but only that they are men, and also that the matter whereupon the
discord rises, does nothing touch us, and that we in meddling to pacify it,
do put ourselves in danger: for we come not hither to seek our own
particular profit, but to serve God and our neighbors. Wherefore it may seem
at the first sight that Solomon ought not to have compared him that passes by,
and medleth with the strife that belongs not to him, unto one that takes a
dog by the ears. For if it is a good thing to be wished that brethren
should dwell together, yea altogether: even so also ought we too think him a
good man which passing by, sees a strife, and labors Psalm. 133.
to set peace: and so he ought to be esteemed wise and discrete: in steed
where he which takes a dog by the ears, is arrogant and rash, putting
himself in danger of the dogs teeth, if one of his ears do slip or escape
out of his hands or both of them. Even so must we understand that Solomon
does not rebuke him that in passing by, labors to accord them which are at
debate, but he that without witting and learning where about they strive,
without knowing who has right or wrong, does take part and maintain the
quarrel of one of the parties against the other: such a passenger is well
worthy of rebuke, when rashly he puts himself into danger, for one of the
parties: or which in passing by raises a quarrel of a matter whereof he has
nothing to do nor to meddle. And thus, not to be like unto him which takes a
dog by the ears, let us content ourselves to meddle with that which
belongs unto our state and vocation.

18 As he that faineth himself mad, casts fire brandes, arrows and mortal
things: 19 So deals the deceitful man with his friend, and says, am not I
in sport?
God does highly commend unto us faithfulness and loyalty toward our
neighbors, when he does expressly forbid us to Leui. 19. 11* 12. 13.
deceive and beguile them. But so much it wants that we esteem any such
forbidding, that we think not a man to be cunning, except he, can make his
particular profit by the hurt of another, and most what they that are the
greatest deceivers, and which do most hurt, and bring greatest loss and
damage, do persuade men to believe that they do nothing but sport and play,
and that they mean no evil. In which doing they are very dangerous: as Solomon
does declare, when he compateth such deceivers unto those which seem to be
out of their wits and without strength and yet will use great violence, the
which can not be easily helped. This violence is signified, By the casting of
fyrebrandes, arrows, etc. Now as we cannot easily remedy such violence:
even so also can no man lightly and easily rise up from them which would have
men to think that what so ever they do against their neighbors is nothing but
sport. And thus such deceivers are murderers: for no thank to them, though
those whom they deceive, do not perish. And forasmuch as we would not be
counted murderers, let us be careful to keep truth with our neighbors,
following that which Saint Paul teaches us: Let no man oppress or defraude
his brother, in any matter, otherwise the vengeance of the Lord is prepared
ready 1. The. 4* 6.
against us, as against murderers. And if we fear the deceivers which in
sporting bring hurt unto our good name, to our bodies, and to our temporal
goods: by a more strong reason we must greatly fear the sport of Papists,
whereby they destroy souls. I call al their doctrine and al their ceremonies,
play and sport, because that without faith they teach and do all their divine
service, as they call it: for if it were not to live at their ease, they would
not meddle with it. And truly there are many which in their hearts, do mock
at their doing: as we may know it by their words uttered at unawares.

20 Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer strife
ceasseth.
When the fire has taken any part, it is of no continuance, except it meet
with matter fit for to burn, or that there is something ministered unto it, even
so, when any strife begins, it may be quickly appeased, except some
talebearer do labor to maintain it. Solomon making such comparison, does
first of al admonish us, that we shouide not cast debates, strifes, the
faggots of false reports and slaundering, flattery, and false witness bearing
into the fire: for such wood does not cool and quench strife, but mainteineth
and kindles it more: as we have seen heretofore under other Pro. 18. 8.
words.

Secondly, he does admonish us that if we fear least the fire will catch
our earthly houses, we must fear much more to give entrance of talebearers
unto us. Thirdly, as we draw the wood back out of the fire, that it should no
longer burn: even so the office of the Magistrate is to root out talebearers.
And every one of us should labor to quench the fire of strife and debate,
chiefly when we bear our neighbors no good will, or that our neighbors do
stir and provoke us unto anger and strife. And for to do this, we Iam. 4. 1.
must renounce our own concupiscencs: for from them come debates.

21 As the coal makes burning coals, and wood a fire, so the contentious man
is apt to kindle strife.
Solomon compares a riotous and contentious man unto a cole and wood, the
which are good creatures of God, the use whereof is good and necessary, as
experience teaches. It is not to say, that such a man is any thing profitable
for all that: but he would give us to understand, that as when a man cares
not for warming of himself nor for fire, he will draw back the coals and
wood: even so if we will be exempted from strife and dissentions: we must
forsake the company of the riotous and co^tentious. Such men do kindle
dissentions which are of no small continuance: as Solomon does mark it well,
when he compares them unto coals and wood, which make the fire to burn the
longer, and not unto straw the which is incontinently consumed, and
mainteineth not the fire: and so they are very dangerous, and is very expedient
to fly and avoid their conversation. For as when we stand near unto the
chimney or fire, we wax warm: even so when we use the company of the
contentious, we are stirred up to be angry, and to make strifes and debates,
the which cannot be so soon quenched, no more then it is easy to quench a
great flame or great fire. Let us understand then that Solomon does admonish
us to be soft, gentle, and gracious, that we should not stir up any man
unto strife and dissension against us: and also he does admonish us to seek
the company of quiet people, and to fly theirs that are co^tentious. For
albeit that Solomon does not presently compare the contentious unto chafe,
yet are they chafe, which shall burn eternally in unquenchable fire, as al
other wicked shall do.

22 The words of a talebearer, are as flatterings, and they go down into the
bowels of the belly.
The word which we here expound, as flatteringes has been expounded as
wounds, because the word has diverse significations and not contrary: for there
is no repugnancie that the talebearer should flatter him whom he will deadly
hurt: he will speak gentle, that no man may beware of him, and till he have
leisure to hurt at his pleasure: and that not only he may do hurt unto his
goods, of whom he speaks evil, but also that by his false tongue, he may
bring him utterly unto destruction, Solomon does signify it, saying,

That the flattering words go down into the bowels of the belly. As touching
the rest, when he so often rebukes the tale carrier, let us know that it is
because he is inclined unto slaundering of his neighbor: and the which also
is a very abominable thing: for he proceeds therein of malice against his
conscience. The talebearer knows well that he would have no man to speak so
of him. They that are such, are dangerous: but some of them are much more to
be feared then other, when they labor by their tale bearing to turn away the
poor weakelings from the true religion.

23 As silver dross over laid upon a potsharde, so are burning lips, and an
evil heart.
When we delight to see goodly things, if we have any vessel of great price,
for to make the same fair, we will cover it over with gold or silver,
according as we esteem the piece to be worthy: neither will we bestow such
cost and glittering show upon a thing of nothing, as is a potshearde, even so
when a man does delight in the uprightness and goodness of his heart, he will
ouerlay it, after a manner of speech, with pure, clean, sweet, and loving
words, he will make his heart to shine by fit and convenient talk, which
shall bring no hurt nor trouble, no molestation nor hinderance unto his
neighbors, but rather with his talk he will labor to make them glad, and to
bring them profit and honor. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart
brings good things. Mat. 12. 35.
Contrarily, when a man delights in the frowardnes of his heart, he will not
ouerlay the same with holy words for to pleasure therewith his neighbors, to
profit them, and to honor them: but with his fiery lips of evil speaking he
will endeavor to vex his neighbor and to hurt him so much as he can. Behold
the ouerlaying which is fit for an evil heart: such had the Scribes and
Pharisees, which Mat. 12.
could not speak well of Jesus Christ our Lord. And for this cause also our
Lord rebukes them sharply, declaring to them, that they had ouerlayed the
same, with wickedness agreeable to their hearts, when he says to them,
Generation of vipers, how can ye speak well, seeing you yourselues are evil?
Let us therefore understand that Mat. 12. 34.
Solomon saying,

As silver dross, etc. does admonish us that we should be careful to keep
that our hearts be not infected with wickedness and made unfruitful as is a
potsharde. And for to do this, let us arm them with the pure word of the
Lord, which are pure as silver that is purified and perfectly fined: let us
learn thereby to abhor al iniquity and frowardness, that we may not have
furious and burning lips that will utter hurtful things unto our neighbors,
but rather that by our words we may procure their benefit and honor, without
any thing hindering them.

24 He that hates, will counterfaite with his lips: but in his heart he
lays up deceit.
When they which conceive any hatred against their neighbors, do think to
have a just cause to hate them: if they feel themselves strong enough for to
hurt and to bring damage, they will not gladly dissemble it, but do openly
assault their enemy: as Saul making himself believe that David was his
enemy, did pursue him without dissimulation. The enemies of the truth, which
think to do service unto God for killing of the disciples of Jesus Christ,
do boldly pronounce without dissimulation, sentence of death against them.
Even so they which are not ashamed to show their evil mind, do nothing at al
fear to declare themselves enemies to them which please them not. These are
not they whereof Solomon speaks, when he says,

He that hates, etc. But of them which shall know in their consciences that
they do wrongfully hate their neighbors, and yet will not cease their hatred,
the which they will dissemble with sweet words, and will secretly devise in
their hearts suddenly to take them whom they hate, and to hurt them by
deceit, that they may not take heed and avoid them. The captain of such
people is Gene. 4. 8. and 37.
Caine: The brethren of Joseph are so in likewise. The traitor Judas does well
deserve to be set in the same order. Likewise the Scribes and Pharisees, and
al those which hate the truth, which know and make a fair show unto them,
whom they pursue, that they may find means to destroy them. Now we must
carefully take heed that we do not become like unto the first haters, who
are proud: for then we shall not only have men for our adversaries, but God
also who resists the proud. And we must also take heed from being like
unto them, of whom Solomon now speaks: for then should we be cruel and
hypocrites sinning against our own consciences and of set malice. Hypocrisy
is noted and known by the fayning of the lips: and cruelty is discerned by
the dissimulation which lies hid within: and the malice prepensed in them
both: to wit, in the dissembling of their lips, and in the covering of the
disceit. But we may take heed of them both, so that we suffer not ourselves
to be overcome by the sweet words of such as hate us, and that we give
credit unto the admonition following.

25 Though he speak favorably, believe him not: for there are seven
abominations in his heart.
The words of the hateful may seem sweet and amiable: but let us not believe
them: for whiles he speaks so gently, he in uenteth abominable things in
his heart, not only one or two, but many: as Solomon notes by the number of
seven. Nevertheless we Prou. 6. 16.
may say that Solomon means here, that the hateful are given unto six
things that God hates, yea to the seventh, which he abhors. For they which
hate their neighbors invent and seek out all wicked and abominable ways,
yea cruel means by the which they may destroy them, whom they hate. Now if
we ought to beware of such haters, as bring harm to our goods, bodies or good
name: by a stronger reason, we must carefully fly from them which hate our
salvation, which are enemies of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ (without
the which we have neither salvation nor life) and so consequently are our
enemies: as also Saint Paul does well signify Acts. 20. 29. Romans 16. 17. 18
it calling them grievous wolves which will not spare the flock, and yet
notwithstanding will speak favorably for to draw disciples after them, but we
must not believe them. We must believe them Phi. 3. 17. 18
which follow S. Paul, as he exhorts us to be followers of him.

26 Hatred may be covered by deceit: but the malice thereof shall be
discovered in the congregation.
Solomon following that which he has said in the two former sentences, does
show now again what the hateful seek, when he labors to dissemble and
to hide his hatred, by the dissembling of his lips, and by the fauourablenes
and sweetness of his voice, that is to say, that he seeks to deceive him whom
he hates, to take him, to hinder and to hurt him, before he can know it, til
after he is caught and had by the back, and cannot escape. Lo, what the
hateful seeks when he hides his hatred. But he deceives himself: for
nothing is so hid, but at one time or other it comes Mat. 10. 26.
to light. And therefore let the hateful dissemble and hide his hatred so long
as he will, saying he intends no evil against his neighbor or such like
words for to disguise himself and to counterfeit, and to deceive his
neighbor, his hatred shall not remain covered, but his malice (as says
Solomon) shall be discovered in the congregation. He thinks to hide his
hypocrisy, malice and cruelty, from two or three: but God will discover and
defame him before many. Though it is not here in this present life, yet shall
it be in the congregation of his Angels, and of his elect.

Let us understand that Solomon by this sentence does admonish us, that we
should be gentle, soft, and loving, and that we should walk uprightly and
in the integrity of our heart one toward another, without dissembling. Thus
doing, we shall not be diffamed in this world before the congregation of the
Lord, nor at the last day before his Angels and elect. Likewise he does
admonish us that we should not be overmuch pensive, though through the
hatred and malice of the wicked, our righteousness or innocence be not made
manifest and revealed: for it shall come to light the time that God has
appointed, and as says Saint Paul, Some men's sins are opened before hand,
and come to judgment, other some do follow after. 1. Tim. 5. 24. 25.


27 He that diggeth a pit, shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone,
it shall return unto him.
The holy Scripture so uses by similitudes, for to show the wicked, that the
wicked enterprises they take in hand, against their neighbors for to destroy
them, are not only unprofitable, but also hurtefull, and noisome. And amongst
others, it sets forth the similitude of them which hunt the great and wild
beasts, or such Psalm. 7. 16. and 9. 16. and 57. 7. Iere. 18. 20.
beasts as are hurtful: as Lions, Bears, Wolves, and Foxes. These hunters
make pitfalles, and cover them over with green turues, that the beasts may
not perceive them, and that in running over them, they may fall and tumble unto
the bottom: and sometimes forgetting the place where they lie, and running
after the beasts to make them fall in, they themselves often times tumble in
headlong. Solomon does now use the like similitude saying,

He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein. Whereby he shows that so far it
is off, that the wicked profit by their wicked enterprises, that rather
thereby they seek their destruction, and find it ere they know it. And for to
express this same yet further, and to show that albeit the wicked are strong
and lusty, yet they shall not avoid the evil they think to do unto other,
but it shall come to them and overthrow them. He adds another similitude,
the which is taken of a man that stands at the foot of an hill, and with his
arm casts up a stone, and not taking heed of the same which falls faster
and more swiftly the^ it mounted and went upward, stands still not caring for
it, and is suddenly overthrown of the stone. Wherein the faithful are
admonished not to fear the devises and enterprises of the wicked: but seeing
them vexed with them, let them patiently look for the issue which it shall
please God to send: and the evil shall not destroy them, but themselves that
work it. Pharao did invent much evil against the children of Israel: Saul
against David: Judas against Jesus Christ: but the end has showed the truth
of this present sentence. And though we should not see the experience thereof
in this world, yet shall the last day show it, that the wicked have sought
their own destruction, in going about to destroy others. And if they which
invent but our temporal destruction shall receive their reward, worthy of their
pain and labor, by a stronger reason must they, (which seek to intrappe men's
consciences, to destroy their souls, to look for a grievous and fearful
punishment, as the Pope and his band.

28 A false tongue hates the afflicted, and a flattering mouth causes
contention.
The world is not satisfied to see the affliction of the miserable, after the
outward appearance, but labors to add affliction upon affliction: as the
wife of Putipher Joseph's master in Egypt was not contented that Joseph should
be a poor slave, but for Gene. 39. Exo. 1. 33.
to afflict him further, she used a false and lying tongue against him. Pharao
also was not contented that the people of God were subject unto him, but made
wicked laws for to oppress them and make them more miserable. The neighbors
of the children of Israel, as the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, and
Ismaelites, labored more and more to kindle rage and fury against them. The
Babylonians procured laws and proclamations to be made to afflict the poor
Jews the more, that they held in captivity: and as it is said, when we will
kill a dog, we will say and lay to his charge, he is mad. In all times this
has been seen proved, after the which Solomon speaks, when he says,

A false tongue hates the afflicted. Wherein we have to note that that which
Solomon calls a false tongue, he afterward calls a flattering mouth,
because that the custom of liars for more better to deceive and to hurt, is
to flatter, that they may more easily execute that which they have conceived
through hatred. And to the flattering mouth he attributes contention, which
is the fruit proceeding from hatred: for he that hates, desires nothing but
to raise up contentions against them whom he hates, that he may overthrow
and destroy them. Now forasmuch as we would not be counted neither liars,
nor flatterers, let us take heed to follow what soever tends and belongs
to peace, concord and love toward our neighbors, and chiefly toward such
as are most miserable and full of calamity, most despised and weak, which
have no power to be revenged. Otherwise, we should despise this present
sentence, the which is not written, to the end that we should only know
what the liars and flatterers think and do, but also that we should abhor
their affections and works, and also should take heed and beware of them.

The xxvii. Chapter.
1 BOast not thy self of to morrow: for thou know not what a day may bring
forth.
WOrldlinges which neither have nor will have any knowledge of the providence of
GOD, and can not believe that al things come to pass according as the Lord
has ordained Gene. 11. 3. and 27. 41. and 37. 27. Exo. 1. 8. and 14. 3. 1.
Sam. 26. 2. 2. Sam. 15. 1. Kings. 12. 2. Kings. 18.
in his eternal counsel, which cannot change, but do attribute one part unto
fortune and chance: and another part unto their wisdom and worldly and
sensual counsel, are full of arrogancy and boasting of concupiscences and
disordinate affections, after the which they promise themselves great things in
time to come: but most often they are deceived of their mind and hope. Solomon
would not not have us to be like unto such worldlings, when he says, Dan. 4.
Luke. 12. 16. James. 4. 13.


Boast not thy self of to morrow. For besides their arrogance, as we may see
by the scriptures, they guide themselves by chance, not referring and
committing themselves unto the will of God. Chance is marked, when Solomon
says, For thou know not what a day may bring forth. When he thus speaks,
he does not rebuke us of ignorance, though we know not what shall be done to
morrow: for God only has things to come in his presence: and would that we
should tarry patiently and look for that which it shall please him to send,
and that we should be certified that al things come to pass according to his
good will: for the which the foresaid worldlings look not after: and therefore
they are well worthy to be rebuked of ignorance, the which is not imputed unto
the faithful, which wait upon the providence of God. For albeit that
particularly, they know not the things that are to come: yet nevertheless they
know and are certified that nothing can come to pass, but what God will have,
and that he has ordained from eternity. This ignorance is humbleness before
God, who does not count it for ignorance: but when we do so cast ourselves
down, we are received and accepted for well learned and knowing much.
Notwithstanding, though we do not know, what thing the day shall bring
forth, yet he does not mean that we should do nothing, whereof we might
make our profit on the morrow: otherwise we should tempt God, who would have
us to labor, that afterward we might eat the fruit of our labor. Having
regard to this will of God, if we labor faithfully to gather riches, without
over greedy desire, not minding to enriche ourselves, and without desire to
hurt our neighbors, we care nothing for to morrow, but do follow the means, by
the which God will give us our daily bread. Furthetmore let us note, that our
free will is very small, yea of no force, when we neither ought to will, nor can
ordeine of things done to morrow. And if the worldly and temporal matters which
are of no great importance and weight, are not in our power, much less shall we
have power over the heavenly and eternal. Let us also note that Solomon does
here compare the day unto a woman with child, of whom no man can certainly
say whether she shall bring forth a son or a daughter: and as we cannot tell
the same, even so is it too much curiosity to inquire thereof. Let us
therefore understand that by this similitude Solomon does admonish us that we
should not be curious.

2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth: a stranger, and not
thine own lips.
The worldlings and carnal men which care nothing of glorifying God in all
things, and who for all things do not acknowledge him to be the only author
of al things, do greatly praise themselves, and are so puffed up in their
hearts, that the mouth must speak, and sound out the praises of such
boasters: in such wise that some will brag of the nobility of their
parentage: other some, of their wisdom and cunning: othersome, of their
power, credit, and authority: and other some again of their beauty and
riches: and the most foolish boasters of al, will brag of their merits. In the
number of such boasters, we may reckon Absolon, Roboam, Nabuchadnezar, 2. Sam.
15. 2 1. King. 12. 10 Dan. 4. z7. Luke. 12. 16. and 18. 11.
the rich glutton, the proud Pharisee. The end of such people is shameful
and full of confusion: and therefore Solomon, which desires our honor, would
not have us to brag of ourselves but if there be any thing in us worthy of
praise, that we should hold our peace, and let others speak, saying, Let
another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth. And forasmuch as it is very
hard for us to forsake boasting, and that our tongue does ache with the great
desire that we have to praise ourselves, Solomon therefore adds the same
forbidding again, saying, Let it be a stranger, and not thy lips. And let
us note, that he says not, let thy brother, or thy cousine praise thee, but
a stranger. For if the brother praise the brother, or the cousin his cousin,
this is as if a man should praise himself: but if a stranger does praise us,
it is an argument and probation that we walk so virtuously, that they which
are not acquainted with us, are constrained to praise us. Notwithstanding, this
is not to say, that it is laweful for us to do any thing for to be praised:
but in all our conversation, we must seek the honor and glory of God, and the
edification of our neighbors. Thus doing, God without our desire, will raise
up men which shall praise us, according as shall be expedient: as we may see by
the holy histories, wherein he has gathered by writing the deeds and acts
worthy of praise of our old Fathers, that we should praise them and follow
their virtues: and also has brought to light the acts of the wicked, that we
abhorring them, might fear to do the like.

3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty: but a fools wrath is heavier then
them both.
We naturally do desire to be exempted from offices, pain, labor, and
travail, and to live doing nothing, except a very little thing, for to seem
that we would not be idle. And yet for to be at ease, and to live
delicately, we seek the acquaintance, and familiarity of the Lords of the
earth, who for the greatest part, are so void of wisdom, and of modest
affection, and of humble mind, that for a thing of nothing and without cause
they will become angry, and will storm against them that are about them, and will
greatly revile them, and furiously oppress them: so that it were better for
them to help a mason or bricklayer, for to carry stones and mortar, then to
dwell with such fools, with whom a man knows not how to be, except he can
abide injuries and wrongs, oppressions, and violences, even to be weary of his
life, when a man sees that he cannot tell how to avoid their fury, and that
they rather look for death, then for life. Albeit that the children of Israel
being in Egypt, sought not to live ydlely without doing any thing, yet it had
been more expedient for the^ to have suffered more pain the^ they did, then so
to have felt the wrath of the king which caused their sons to be slain.
David also did not seek to live ydlely: but it had been more necessary for
him in man's judgment, to have lived a private and a baselife, then to be the
son in law of Saul, who was a wicked and cruel fool, and persecuted David,
in such wise, that he knew not where to hyde himself, but amongst the
infidels. According to this experience Solomon says now, A stone is heavy,
etc. Wherein he does admonish us, not to be delicate, but to follow our
vocation, though it be very hard. Let us also learn, that it is far better
to bear the yoke of Jesus Christ, which seems troublesome and hard to the
flesh, then to submit a man's self and enclyne unto the traditions and
doctrines of men. For albeeit that at the first approach it seems that they
are Angels which teach them: yet do they proceed with great fury: first
of all against them that will not yield and obey: secondly they destroy for
ever their souls which suffer themselves to be deceived by the^. And further
let us note, that he says not simply and absolutely, wrath, but the wrath of
a fool: for it is profitable for us that the wise become angry with us, when
we fail and err, seeing they seek not our destruction, but our profit, the
which we shall feel, if we do not rebel against them. And contrarily, the
fool by his wrath seeks nothing but destruction, for the which to avoid we
must take diligent heed from consenting unto his folly: for thinking to eschew
a temporal destruction, we shall fall into an eternal damnation: from the which
the fools shall not be exempted, for they wax angry without cause, the which
is equal to murder.

4 Anger is cruel, and wrath is raging: but who can stand before envy?
An angry man is cruel: as we may see by Caine, Esaw, and the brethren of
Joseph. And a man that is furious, is like unto a flood of Gene. 4. and 27. and
37. Exo. 14. 1. Sam. 18. 2. Sam. 15. 1. Kings. 12.
water that descends with raging: as we may see in Pharao, Absolon, and
Roboam. Now that which is seen by experience, Solomon does pronounce, when he
says, Anger is cruel. etc. Wherein he does advertise that the company of the
wrathful and furious man is very hurtful and dangerous, and for this cause that
we should not desire the same, but should rather shun and avoid it. And
forasmuch as we desire not that any man should fly our company, as from cruel
and wrathful, furious and unmerciful men, and also that we would not have our
neighbors to be such toward us, let us understand that Solomon does admonish
us to put from us al bitterness, anger, wrath, and roaring, as does S. Paul.
The angry and wrathful Ephesians. 4. 31. 32. Col. 3. 8.
are very dangerous, but the envious are far more cruel: as Solomon does
pronounce, when he says,

But who shall stand before envy? For besides cruelty and raging, the which
we may correct in the angry and wrathful, the envious is ambitious and
arrogant, a dissembler, purposing malice, obstinate and hard of heart against
his conscience, so that they are altogether without reconciliation: as we may
see in the Scribes and Pharisees against Jesus Christ our Lord. Thus we are
advertised to take diligent heed of the envious, and also that we ourselves fall
not too it: following the admonition of S. Peter. 2. Pet. 2. 1.


5 Open rebuke is better then secret love.
Love is little worth and serves them to no purpose whom we think we love,
or that we would persuade ourselves we love, except that we declare the
same by good deeds toward them, in helping their necessity. And therefore
S. John does admonish James. 2. 14. 1. Ioh. 3. 17. 18.
us to help the necessity of our brethren. It were better for us to be openly
rebuked, then so to be loved: as Solomon does pronounce it, saying,

Open rebuke or correction, etc. For if we do openly rebuke our neighbors,
if they are easy to be taught and tractable, they will be ashamed, and will be
ware of returning to the like fault, and will return unto God by true
repentance: as did David, after that the Prophet Nathan had rebuked him. That
rebuke was much more profitable for him, then the secret love of Nabal: who
sought to do 2. Sam. 12. 1. Sam. 25.
David no hurt, but yet he would not help his necessity. As there are many
such which will persuade themselves that they love their neighbors enough, when
they do them no wrong nor violence, though they have no mind at al to do
them any good. Such kind of love is so secret, that it is nothing, but rather
hatred: for where there is no love, there is hatred: seeing there is no mean
way between both. Moreover, we are admonished rather to reprove and correct,
then to dissemble the fautes of our neighbors: and also we are admonished that
we should not desire to be flattered, but to be sharply corrected and rebuked.

6 The wounds of a lover are faithful: but the kisses of an enemy are hard.
We call a tree a true and faithful sister, when it fails not to bring forth
her fruit in due season: even so we call rivers true or faithful sisters, when
they faint not, but do always run abundantly. After this sense Solomon
does call the wounds of a lover which chasteneth, when he says, the wounds
of a lover, etc. For albeit that after men's carnal reason, we take not the
chastizementes and corrections in good part, yet are they fruiteful. And thus,
Solomon does admonish us that we should count the chastizements of the wise
and just, profitable and fruiteful: seeing they love us, and that they labor
to make us that we should take our profit, not only temporal, but also
spiritual and eternal. For they seek to make us exercised and profit in the
fear of the Lord God, whereby we are turned from evil, to follow
righteousness and holiness, and consequently come to the accomplishement and
perfection of this profit, which is the possession of the everlasting
blessedness. The wounds therefore of such people are very faithful, and so
must we receive them in good Psalm. 141. 5.
part, with patience and with joy, and say with David, let the righteous smite
me, for that is a benefit: and let him reprove me, and it shall be a precious
oil, that shall not break mine head, etc. And if we must thus behave
ourselves toward men which of love that they bear us, do chasten us: it is
therefore good reason that we should take in worth, when the Lord which
loves us Heb. 12. 5.
with an incomprehensible love, does correct and chasten us: even as the
Apostle dothadmonish us: my son despise not the chastizement of the Lord,
neither faint when thou art rebuked of him: for the Lord corrects every
son that he loves, etc. Now as we must patiently suffer their chastening
that loves us: even so contrarily, we must fly and abhor the flatteries of
them which hate us: as Solomon does admonish us, saying, and the kisses, etc.
Albeit that such kisses after the outward appearance are pleasant, as the word
which we have expounded hard may import: yet when they are full of treasons and
murders, the which are things much abominable, then are they truly very
hard: as amongst other the kiss of Judas the traitor.

7 The person that is full, treads under feet an honey comb: but unto the
hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
It is lawful for us to eat and to drink, of such things as GOD has created
for our use, and also it is as lawful for us to abstain from them: as we may
in some sort gather of S. Paul. I say in some sort: for the intent of S.
Paul, was not to handle, whither it were laweful Romans 14. 3. 6 Phi. 4. 11. 12
for us either to eat, or to abstain: but knowing that their use is free and
lawful for us both to take and to leave, we should be careful to keep
ourselves that we fall not into one of these two extremities: the one whereof is
properly vicious and damnable, the other is dangerous and hurtful. The vicious
extremity is marked by Solomon, when he says, The person that is full,
treads under feet, etc. Wherein he does show us that we ought not to
desire superfluity and excess in eating and drinking, but that we should
fly and avoid al gluttony and drunkenness, and al intemperancie. For besides
that all the person is made heavy and ill disposed, men come to despise and
mar the good creatures of God, which is a great unthankfulness. Solomon
does note the contempt and spoiling, by treading under feet the honny combs.
We may also say that Solomon means that the person which has abundance of
riches, and does not confess that God does give them to him, for to use
soberly and temperately, cares not though the better part be lost: as are
they which never have their tables furnished enough to their mind and desire,
at the which they entertain a sort of idle bellies. There are the combs of
honey trodden under feet, there is much good meatelost, that would serve well to
fill the hungry soul. And thus let us understand that Solomon does exhort us
unto sobriety and temperancie, how rich soever we be, and would have us
to confess that they come from the goodness and liberality of the Lord,
that we should fear to make any spoil, or to have them in contempt. But as
touching the dangerous extremity, it stands in the abstinence of meats and
drinks, when any man cares not to nourishe and to sustain himself, but
does famish and hungerstarue himself, so that with the great greediness
that he has to eat, he cares not what he takes and eats, but deuoureth
the first meat that he meets and comes to, be it good or bad, sweet or
bitter. Solomon notes this extremity, saying, But unto the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet. The which I call dangerous, because that the person
which so rules himself, runs in danger to poison himself. Nevertheless
we may say that Solomon means that they which are poor, and stay to eat
til they have a stomach, have no need of sause, for to dyne withal, and that
the meat which the gluttons do abhor, as if they were bitter, are to them
sweet and pleasant. Now as they that are full, despise good meat, even so the
worldly wise which are puffed up with their knowledge, do nothing regard and
esteem the good meat of our souls, which is the word of God, the which to
the faithful is sweeter then honey. Contrarily, as the hungry take Psalm. 19. 11.
them to al kind of meats that they meet with, and are in danger to be
poisoned: even so the ignorant do consent as soon unto a false doctrine as
unto a good and true: and so their minds and understandings are easily
poisoned. They also which are delighted in the pleasures and voluptuousness of
this world, and do enjoy the^, do nothing esteem heavenly things. They which
challenge righteousness by their works, and think themselves rich by the
righteousness of them, are not earnest, neither do hunger that GOD should
grant them grace, or should show his goodness to them: but they which hunger
and thirst for righteousness, do find the yoke of Jesus Christ sweet, and
his burden light, and do manly and courageously bear the cross, yea death.

8 As a byrd that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his
own place.
The nature of the byrd is to be careful of his nest, that he may nourish,
maintain, bring up, and keep his littleones. Notwithstanding yet will he
suddenly fly from his nest, and forsake his little byrds, And this shall be
sometimes for to go seek food for herself, and for his youngones: and so
this comes of the care that he has to feed them well: sometimes forasmuch
as he has perceived something wherewithal he has been feared: and so he
wandereth and flies far off, for to save his life, and forgets some of
his little ones. Such is the nature and kind of doing of little byrds, as we
may see it by experience. And the holy scripture makes mention of it, not to
the end that we should know it: but the scripture speaks of birds,
comparing unconstant men unto them, which easily are afearde, forsake their
office, and forget their duty. And thus by this comparison the scripture
does rebuke the fearfulness, the weakness and inconstancy of men: as
here, when Solomon says,

As a bird that wandereth, etc. True it is that as the byrd does fly far
from his nest for to seek food and meat, even so, when the Sun is up, man
must go forth unto his work and to his labor, til it is night: but he
should not go far from his place. For he that does his office and duty,
wheresoever he goes, he does not wander far from his place, but keeps
residence there as he ought. And also when the scripture compares man unto
the bird that flies her way, most commonly it serves for to rebuke him, as
in this present sentence, or for to threaten to take his rest from him. Now
that we may not be taxed of inconstancy, of fearfulness, or of weakness,
let us take heed to be careful to hold fast our place, in walking diligently
and faithfully in the state wherein God has placed us: and let us for any
fear that can be, made us, say with David: In the Lord have I put my trust,
how then say ye unto my soul, Psalm. 11. 1
fly away to your mountain as a bird? For if in holding our place we walk
in the fear of the Lord, and do ask in a sure trust with David, keep me
as the apple of thine eye, etc. again, Psalm. 17. 8 and 57. 2. Psalm. 91.
Have mercy upon me, O GOD, have mercy upon me: for my soul trusts in
thee, etc. he will not fail to assist us, and to keep and save us, as he
promises. For he is not like unto the bird which wandereth far from his
nest, and forgets his Dau. 33. 11. Exo. 14. 4. Mat. 23. 27.
young: but he is like unto the Egle which stirs up her nest, flootereth
over her birds, stretches out her wings takes the^, and bears them on her
wings. He is also like unto the hen which gathers her chickens under her
wings. Wherefore confessing that of ourselves and of our own nature we are
weak, unconstant, and fearful as little birds, let us run under the
wings of this hen, trusting in the fatherly care of our father, and
wondering at his goodness which he shows to them which trust in him,
saying, How excellent is thy mercy, O God! therefore the children of men trust
under the shadow of thy wings. I will Psalm. 36. 7. and 61. 4.
dwell in thy Tabernacle for ever, and my trust shall be under the couerings of
thy wings.

9 As the ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so does the sweetness of a
man's friend by hearty counsel.
When the body is at his ease and in health, the heart is merry and glad: as
we feel it by experience. And therefore after this experience, Solomon says,
that the ointment and perfume rejoice the heart. Not that he will teach us
that for to possess our delights and sensual pleasures we should apply
oyntmentes and perfumes unto our bodies for such delights, because they are
too curiously desired, and used excessiuely, are not acceptable unto God,
albeit he has created al things for the use of man, to whom it is laweful to
use al good creatures, soberly and te^perately, with giving of thanks. But
Solomon speaks of ointment and perfume, by comparison, and would, that if we
rejoiced in such things, and that we found them sweet, we should also
rejoice at the unfeigned sweet counsel that the neighbor gives: for by such
sweetness the soul of man is brought in good health: as Solomon does
pronounce, saying,

So does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. When we see
that our neighbor loves us, and that he desires nothing but to procure our
wealth and our salvation, and to cause us to attain theretoo, he does teach,
admonish, exhort, reprove, correct, rebuke and threaten, according as he
sees to be expedient and necessary for us: so far is it of that we should
stomach or despyte him, that rather considering the gentleness and good
affection that he bears to us, we should receive his counsel pleasantly and
acceptably, though in outward appearance it be sharp and sour: as David did
the reprehensions of Nathan the Prophet: and the Apostle Saint Peter of the
rebuke that Saint Paul gave him. Otherwise the good and sweet favor of
Christ, which is brought unto us by his ministers, 2. Cor. 2. 14. 15. 16.
should be savor death unto death, and should go unto perdition.

10 Thine own freende, and thy fathers freende forsake thou not: neither enter
into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbor
that is near, than a brother far off.
We are so unconstant of nature, that weecannot hold that which is profitable,
and that which is familiar unto us, and as it were common by custom, but we
desire new things, and therefore we labor to make alterations, the which are
not always profitable, but oftentimes bring great hurt, whereby we have
troubles and most heavy sorrows: in such sort that we know not on which side
to turn us, insomuch that weedare not resort unto our own carnal brethren:
for we have experience that the rich brethren do not care for their poor
brethren, nor would gladly to see them, and also Pro. 19. 7. Pro. 18. 24.
do hate them. Wherefore, when we have proved and tried our friends, we
ought not to change, but to hold them still: as Solomon has already
admonished us. And now he does the like, when he says,

Forsake not thou thine own freende, etc. And herein, he teaches us, that
if we have good neighbors, who have always showed signs and tokens of love,
and have been favorable and helpeful unto our house, that we should in no
wise separate ourselves and loose such neighbors: for in time of necessity
such neighbors will be more ready to help us, then our own carnal brother:
and oftentimes we loose both time, labor and our hope to resort unto such
brethren. Solomon does signify as much, saying, Neither enter thou into thy
brothers house in the day of thy calamity. He means not that it is ill
done of us to resort unto our brother to have succor of him in adversity:
but he signifies that most often we gain nothing in beseeching him. As
Joseph in man's judgment got nothing in beseeching his brethren: they took no
compassion or pity on him, but sold him for a poor slave. And so it is far
better to have good neighbors near unto us, and willing to help us, then
brethren that care nothing for us, and are far from us. Let us therefore
understand, that neighbors are admonished to maintain peace, concord and
love amongst themselves, and to help one another: and brethren are rebuked
for their cruelty, when they refuse and deny brotherly duty. For albeit that
they kill not their poor brethren, as Cain slew Abel: yet are they the brethren
of Cain, and are murderers, when in not helping their brethren, they declare
their hatred which answers to murder.

11 My son, be wise, and rejoice mine heart, that I may answer him that
reprocheth me.
Be it that Solomon speaks here in the person of God, or of the ministers
of the word, or of fathers and mothers, or other superintendents, let us know
that when he asks of us that we should give ourselves unto wisdom, and
that in so doing, we should inwardly rejoice him, he admonishes us
carefully to frequent the word, and that thereby we should learn to amend
our lives, forsaking al infidelity and incredulity, al superstition and
idolatries, al malice and iniquity, al offenses, insolences and dissolutions:
and that we should convert by true faith, and by true repentance to trust
upon the goodness of our God, to love the good that he commands, and to
give ourselves to do it. For we cannot otherwise rejoice our good God and
father, then in turning to him, and obeying with a free mind his word: as he
has well showed, when he repented to have made man, and that Noe found Genesis 6.
and 19
favor in his sight: and when he ouerthrewe Sodom, and delivered Lot: When
he raised up Moses, and diverse Prophets, to instruct the people in all
wisdom and prudence, and to make them turn unto his God: and when he says
expressly, Return you therefore, Eze. 18. 30. and 33. 11. 18
and repent you of al your transgressions, and wickedness shall not destroy
you, etc. As sure as I live says the Lord, I desire not the death of a
sinner: but that he should convert and live. Deuteronomy 30. 8. Iere. 32. 38.
Thou shall return and obey the voice of the Lord, etc. And they shall be my
people, and I will be their God, etc. What think ye? If a man have an hundred
sheep, and that he has lost one, does Mat. 18. 12.
he not leave nientie and nine in the mountains, and goes to seek the same
that went astray? It is the will also of your heanenly father, that not one of
the least shall perish. What man among you, who Luke. 15. 4
having an hundred sheep, if he has lost one, does he not leave nientie
and nine in the wilderness, and goes his way after that which which is lost?
etc. Even so I tell you, there shall be joy in heaven for one sinner that
repents, etc. Herein, all they which have charge, ought to learn whereat
they should rejoice: to wit, for the conversion of them that have gone astray,
and of their perseverance in goodness, that they have learned by the word: as
S. Paul does Phi. 2. 14
show it to the Philippians. And thus, the Papists do not execute their
charge with such joy as they ought to do: for they rejoice at the profit of
the purse that they receive, and not for the edification and salvation of the
people. Now albeit that the poor faithful which are the children of God, and
of wisdom, do give themselves unto wisdom, and labor to please God, and
their governors by holy life: yet the wicked cease not to trouble them, to
do them injury, to revile them, and to slander them: as in all times the true
and faithful servants of God have been subject thereto: but they ought not
care for it: for our good God and father takes these reproaches as done against
himself, and knows well how to resist the^, if we persevere in wisdom: as
Solomon does signify when he adds, that I may answer him that reprocheth
me. Answering, here is taken for resisting, and to confound, and to revenge,
as also in our language we use it in this signification. Now as God thinks
him to be provided of answer and defense against our oppressors and
slaunderers, if we apply ourselves unto wisdom: even so, so much as in us
lies, we make God to be dumb, and make him ashamed, when we give ourselves
unto vanity, foolishness, and wickedness: and likewise those which have
charge over us: as Saint Paul complains of the Galathians. Gala. 4. 20.


12 A prudent man sees the plague, and hides himself: but the foolish go on
still, and receive hurt.
Albeit that Solomon has pronounced this present sentence Pro. 22. 3.
word for word before, and that it has been largely handeled, yet
forasmuch as Solomon has not thought the repetition thereof superfluous, we
ought not to think it unprofitable, if we handle it here again. And
therefore, let us note that this present life is replenished with miseries and
calamities, with hurtes and dangers, and that we are here as it were in an
high way, which is, occupied with thieves and robbers, which wait for to cut
the passengers thotes, and to spoil them. And first of all, there are subtle
and malicious devils, which demand nothing else but to kill us: and therefore to
avoid their claws and griping, we must be very wise: as we are admonished:
and to arm us well, as Saint Paul does teach 1. Pet. 5. 8. 9. Ephe. 6. 10.
us. Thus doing we shall not be counted of the number of the simple and rude,
which are indamaged, not taking heed of the devils craftiness, but by such
means we shall hyde ourselves under the protection of our God, who will
preserve and save us from hurt. Psalm. 91.


Secondly, there is the world of the wicked, who have always exercised, and
do daily still exercise great tyranny against the poor servants of God, and
that after diverse sorts: for some seek riches for to become rich, and
therefore do violence to the body for to win and to get them: and other
(which are yet worse) by false doctrines and traditions of men, not only
devour the houses of the poor simple, but also destroy both their bodies and
souls, sending them to the fire of hell. Against the which we must resist, not
with worldly and carnal policy to do them violence: but seeing they are
instruments of the Devil, we must fight against them with the 1. John. 5. 4. 5
Luke. 21. 19. Romans 7 Gala. 5.
self same wisdom that we do against the Devils: and as we are admonished,
we must possess our souls with patience. Thirdly, we have our own flesh
which watches and spieth us, and does us great violence and oppression: as
Saint Paul complains thereof, If we withstand not our flesh, we are but
simple and foolish which receive hurt, as we well deserve. For the more we obey
to our flesh, and the lusts thereof, the more are we made the enemies Iam.
1. 13. 1. Cor. 14. 20.
of GOD, by whom only we live and die. Therefore if we will surely hide us
from the plague, and receive no hurt, obeying the admonition of Saint Paul,
for we must not think that Solomon would advertise us to be wise after the
worldly sort.

13 Take his garment that is suertie for a stranger, and a pledge of him for
the stranger.
This present sentence is contained in the. 20. chapter and. 16. verse.

14 A curse shall be imputed unto him that prayseth his freende with a loud
voice, rising up early in the morning.
Because that the slothful and negligent lie snorting in their beds, and
are not diligent to rise early in the morning, when we will signify any thing
to be done, or that it shall be done with great care and diligence, or hastily
and without tarriance, we attribute unto him early rising: for they that have
care, and will hasten to dispatch some work, do not as the slouthful do, but
having taken their reasonable rest and sleep, do rise early and betimes in
the morning. And also the Scripture signifiyng some thing that is done with
diligence and with speed, says that he rose early in the morning to do it.
And thus when Solomon says:

A curse shall be etc: Let us understand that he would not that we should be
ready and hasty to publish and proclaim the Genesis 49. 27 Psalm. 5. 4. and 46.
6. and 143* 8.
praises of men, how great friends soever they be: otherwise we should give
occasion to other to think us to be hypocrites, and that by fair words and
flatteries, we should seek to enter into their favor whom we would bless with
our moth, and yet curse them in our Esaias. 5. 11.
hearts: or else also we give occasion to them whom we bless openly to be
grieved with our blessings, and to hold and count us for cursed, yea, if so be
they be modest and humble. For we shall see some arrogant and ambitious, which
are greatly delighted, that men should blow the trumpet, and pipe out merrily
with a loud voice their praises. Now we may say that a curse shall be imputed
unto him, that shall bless his friend with a loud voice: rising up early in
the morning. And this agrees with that which Jesus Christ pronounces: Woe be
to you when al men praise you: for even so did your fathers Luke. 6. 26.
to the false Prophets. Let us learn here not to be curious to set forth
the praises of men: but let us be careful and diligent to give glory and
honor unto our only God, as it behooves: and let us take good heed in any
wise to hurt the good name of our neighbors by slaunderings, flatteries,
leasings, and false tales.

15 A continual dropping in the day of rain, and a contentious woman are a
like.
The woman is given of God unto man for his ease, help, and comfort, that man
being not alone, might the better maintain and uphold his house, and preserve
the same in a good state, and that al things should be done between them
for the edification of their family, and that it should not fall into decay
and destruction. Wherefore, when we will marry, we must not look unto high
estates, neither to riches, neither to nobility, or to an ancient stock,
neither to credit, authority, or to the power thereof: but the chief point
stands in enquiring after the honesty, genlenesse, humanity, wisdom,
holiness: and innocence of the party that we desire to have in marriage.
For it may come to pass that we may be married highly and rightly, for to
raise our house, and to live at our ease: but therewith we may meet with a
lofty and arrogant party, whom nothing may please: and there shall be
continual criyng and soul wether, whereupon strifes and debates will arise, and
one of the parties shall withdraw on the one side, and the other on the other:
the which is cause of great ruin and destruction: as Solomon Pro. 19. 13.
has well showed it before, and at this present does pronounce the same again,
saying,

A continual dropping in the day of rain, etc. Albeit that he does not
speak but of the wise, yet when the husband is contentious, the dropping is
very dangerous. And as by the continual dropping an house falls to decay:
even so when either the man or the woman is given unto contention, the children
and household servants areeuil edified. The which is much worse the^ if any
sumptuous and gorgeous house fall into decay, without being repaired. For the
children and servants which are brought up by an evil example, do not only
perish concerning the body, but the souls also go unto eternal destruction:
yea if the children follow the evil trade of their fathers and mothers. We
ought then to be very careful to look narrowly and straightly what party we
take in marriage: for if Eze. 18.
the wife be contentious and riotous, seeing it is a vice very natural unto
women to be riotous, it is almost impossible to quiet it: no more then it is
possible to stop the wind when it blows vehemently that it should go no
further: and no more it is possible to forbid any man to smell the sweet and
pleasant baume or ointment that is carried open in the hand. Solomon does
signify this same, saving,

16 He that hides her, hides the wind, and she is as the Oil in his right
hand that utters it self.
The more that we labor to withstand the wind, the more do we feel it
vehement and stormy: and the more that the ointment is pressed in the hand,
the more greater is the odor: even so also when we labor to suppress a
riotous woman, and to make her to hold her peace, so much the more will she
cry out, and take on the more. Nevertheless it is not to say, that we should
not labor to reduce women unto modesty and humility: as S. Paul does in
diverse places, showing what ought to be the conversation of the wives: even as
has been alleged heretofore. Now when Solomon speaks thus at diverse times
of women, making them like unto the covering of a house perced through in a
stormy wind, and because that for their sakes he does attribute crying unto
the ointment, they should be greatly ashamed, and careful to keep themselves
silent, and to behave themselves humbly and modestly. And forasmuch as the
husbands ought to be the more wise, and to show the way unto the wife, who
is the weaker vessel, let them therefore understand, that their lesson is
here given them, that they may learn not to live in their houses like fierce
and cruel Lions, but to be modest and quiet. It were expedient to show here
the decay and destructions that comes of the riots and contentions between
the husbands and the wives: but Pro. 21. 9. 19 and 25. 24.
it has been already largely handeled.

17 Iron sharpeneth iron: so does a man sharpen the face of his freende.
We know by experience that when we rub or whet the edge of a knife that is
blunt, upon some hard or sharp thing, as upon some piece of iron, or whet the
same upon an other knife, it is made to cut better then it did before: even so
also when man, which of himself, is not thoroughly awake, nor quick unto work,
is stirred up, and as it were pricked and spurred up by an other, which will not
let him sleep, then is his face sharpened: then does he take courage, and
show himself free and willing to yield his duty, and to do his office
more readily then he was before, except he be intractable, obstinate, and
hardened. For then so far it is of, that he should be sharpened to do well,
that rather his mind is stirred up unto wrath and fury, to contentions and
debates, unto murmurings and seditions against him that provoke him: as Noe,
Lot, Moses, the Prophets, Jesus Christ and his Apostles have tried it by
experience: and also now we have trial thereof, in the scorners and contemners
of the word of the Lord, when we labor to sharpen and quicken them up by
wholesome doctrine, by holy admonitions, exhortations, and declarations, by
reprehensions, corrections, and threatninges. Such kind of men are like unto
swords which have their edge so thick and so blunt, that it will not cut, do
what you can, albeit that you take great pains to whet and sharpen it. Now to
the end that we may not be of the number of such indurates, let us be
counseled to awake out of our sins, when daily we are labored to be
sharpened by the word of the Lord, without any regarding whither we be strong
and mighty, learned and wise. We must therefore be folowers of David, in that
that he patiently suffered Nathan to sharpen his face: and of S. Peter, which
wept, when Jesus Christ sharpened his face by his countenance: and resisted
not: when S. Paul did also sharpen by his reprehension.

18 He that keeps the Fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that
waits upon his master, shall come to honor.
By the Fig tree, we may understand al things that are brought out of the
earth, and carry fruit. And so, Solomon does signify, that he which is
careful of keeping the blessings that his land brings forth, shall be
sustained and nourished with them, so that he shall never want, nor never
shall be constrained to beg his bread, nor never shall be blamed for negligence,
nor for contempt of the good creatures that God has given unto him for his
use: as are the slouthful, the prodigal, and light people, which have no
consideration of not wasting the substance that God gives them, for to keep
it well, and for to distribute the same well unto their household, and to the
poor that need and want. Solomon does signify this same, when he says,

He that keeps the Fig tree, etc. Nevertheless, this is not only to show
us of the foresaid care, but to make comparison: as he does show it, when he
adds,

So he that keeps his master, etc. Wherein he warns servants not to
forsake their masters, promising unto them, that as the Fig tree brings
forth his fruit for his use, that keeps good watch, even so, the master
shall help all the necessities of his servant that forsakes him not, but does
keep him at home with him, and is careful to serve him. And thus, as he
honors his master, keeping him, and not forsaking him: even so, his master
will honor him, not blaming, nor casting him off, but will succor him in all his
necessities. We have here then, diverse instructions. The first is, that we
should not contemn the earthly blessings as unprofitable, but that we should
keep a good watch, for to use them as God has ordained. So doing, we shall
not be beggars, but enriched by the blessing of God, who will give us the right
and Mat. 6. 24. 25.
profitable use of the riches he gives us into our hands. Yet
notwithstanding in keeping watch of our goods, let us take heed that Luke 12.
15. 22.
we be not careful of to morrow, but rather let us be careful of this, to
follow the doctrine of Jesus Christ. The second point, That al 1. Tit. 6. ^.
Hebr. 13. 5. ^
subjects and inferior persons, al children and servants ought to help
their Superiors, to be ready at their commandment, and diligently to do
their will, as it has been to fore showed by the scriptures. The third point,
That al they which are in authority Romans 13. 1. Ephe. 6. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 1. Tit.
2. 9. 2. Pet. 2. 13
should keep well that they contemn not, nor despise their subjects and
inferiors, which are not disobedient, nor forsake them, but do honor them,
doing their office, and paying unto them, that which belongs to them: as they
are warned to do in the places before alleged. The fourth, If it is not
lawful for subjects and inferiors to forsake their carnal masters: by a more
strong reason must we be careful to keep and hold fast our heavenly great
master: and he will not despise us, but giving unto us abunda^tly al things in
this world to use, in the end he will honor us, glorifying us in his heavenly
kingdom for ever.

19 As in water, face answers to face: so the heart of man to man.
When a man looks into a clear spring of water, he sees his image, even as
if he saw himself in a glass, or little difference: and so he sees how
taul he is, by the correspondancie or representation that is showed in the
water: and as he remooueth and changes place, even so does his
representation: and if he stand still, it stands still also: so that it might
seem to them which are not accustomed to see such a thing, that the
representation had moving, life, and understanding: the which is false
nevertheless, as we know: for it is nothing but a dead shadow, and which
soon vanishes away. Even so, when we apply our hearts and minds to behold
the natures, customs, and manners of our neighbors, we see our image, and may
judge what we are: for we are like unto ourselves, and are the lively images,
and the true representations one of an other, in as much as we are all the
children of Adam. And so, if we see any malice in our neighbors, let us not be
pleased in ourselves, and flatter us, in praising ourselves more then they: for
we have the root of al evil in us, as we show well, when God does slack us
the bridle. It may seem at the first sight, that Solomon does admonish us
hereof, when he says,

As in water, etc. But there is another sense and meaning, which agrees better
according to the nature which is in the water and in the heart of man. For as
one water agrees and is like unto another, but yet it runs, and has no
steadfastness to come and stand by the other: even so albeit that the hearts
of men are one like to another, and that they have some likeness together, and
some knitting and conjunction, yet is there no tenure and hold: for as one man
does easily separate himself from another, and turns away his mind, not
caring for his acquaintance, alliance, or confederacy: To day, a man will show
himself well minded toward his neighbor, and in less while then turning of a
hand he will be gone, and show disdain, or will declare to be his enemy. And
thus Solomon teaches us, that we must not look to men to trust in them, no
more then to the water which rometh, and is not known where it becomes: but
the Lord is faithful, and changes not, in whom we must trust: and say with an
assured heart with David, it is better to trust in the Lord, then to trust in
men, etc. Thus doing, though the hearts of Psa. 118. 8. 9.
men do run away from us as does water, yet shall we not remove. For they
that trust in the Lord, are as mount Sion, which cannot Psalm. 125. 1.
be removed, but stands fast for ever. Contrarily, if forsaking our God, we
put our trust in men, we shall be frustrate and void of our hope, and shall be
accursed. Albeit then that God has created, and set us in this world for to
serve one another, yet for to have a sure Iere. 17. 5. Psalm. 129. 1.
help we should look to the Lord, as David teaches us.

20 The grave and destruction can never be full, so the eyes of man can never be
satisfied.
At the beginning man was created after the image of God, after the which he
was exempted from death and destruction: into the Gene. 1. 27. 2. Pet. 2. 4.
Jude. 6.
which the Angels fell, to wit, those that sinned. Now the Devil seeing himself
thus deprived of glory and felicity, and to be damned for ever, did envy
the glory and blessed estate wherein man was placed: and therefore from the
beginning he has made his batteries, that he might throw man headlo^g into the
same damnation. Now man has Gene. 3.
not resisted the assaults of the Devil, but has easily yielded unto him: by
his rebellion and disobedience has put out this image, introducing sin into
the world, and by sin death. And as the Devil Romans 5. 12. John. 8. 44. 1.
Peter. 5. 8. Ephe. 6. 10. Mat. 12. 43. John. 8. 44.
from the beginning has been a liar and murderer, even so does he not
cease to pursue his work. S. Paul does well signify the same. And thus the
Devil is never filled nor satisfied with the damnation of mankind: as also
Jesus Christ our Lord does signify it well. And forasmuch as by the continual
envy of the Devil, and by the sin of man, who has consented to the Devil,
al human creatures tend to death, and go to the grave, and that in man's
judgment and outward experience, the sepulcher or grave corrupts and
brings all the body which it receives to nothing, and never refuses any, nor
never yields any back again, but consumes them, without any remedy, as
the worldlinges and carnal men esteem, and as it is seen before our eyes,
and by experience in all worlds: for this cause, that which is proper to the
Devil, is attributed unto the grave, and is called destruction that never can
be full. For when Solomon, having named the grave, sets afterward
destruction, this is by Repetition or exposition. For it is as if he said, the
grave which consumes, and swalloweth what soever is given too it, is never
weary of receiving and corrupting all that is brought unto it. Now that which
Solomon pronounces in this place, is seen by experience to the eye: and
therefore, Solomon tends not to teach us the nature of the grave, the which
is known: but rather he will set before us our misery, and partly show us the
fruits of our sins, which are death and destruction. For if there had been
no sin, we had had no need of grave: and without sin, there had bin no
temporal nor eternal death: but because of sin, John. 11. 25. 26
we must dye, and be buried. Notwithstanding if we dye in the fear of the
Lord, being assured that he is our resurrection and our life, the grave shall
not be our destruction, but as a rest, wherein our bodies do sleep, looking
for the blessed resurrection: and our death is a ready passage from death to
life. Contrarily, to the unfaithful the grave and temporal death are their
entrance unto eternal destruction. For albeit that at the last, they shall rise
again, yet shall it not be to live, but to be tormented in pains everlasting:
the which is a very sharp and hard death, and which never shall have end.
Solomon the^ Dan. 12. 2. Ioha. 5. 29.
does rebuke me^ for their vnsatiablenes, co^paring their greedy desires unto
the grave and destruction: as he does show, when he adds,

So the eyes of man can never be satisfied. Wherein we have to note, that he
speaks of the man that is left in his natural corruption, who suffers
himself to be transported by his evil concupiscences and disordinate
affections. For they that are regenerate, and made new creatures by the holy
Ghost, are satisfied, and crave nothing further, but only that the good will of
God should be done and fulfilled. And for to conserve this satisfying well, they
fight, laboring for to destroy and kill the relikes of sin, which are still in
their flesh, the which, because of the same relikes, lusts against the
spirit. And so, Solomon speaks not of the eyes of the children of God, but
of the evil affections of the children of Adam, which also Gal. 5. 17.
are the children of the Devil. And as the Devil is not filled nor satisfied to
see, and to pursue the decaie and destruction of men: even so his children have
never satisfied enough their affections, but do daily grow, as we prove it
by experience in many: as in the ambitious, covetous, and usurers. Solomon
calls such affections, eyes, and not without cause: for whatsoever is set
before man's eye, he still desires to see more. Even so we can never satisfy
our affections, and chiefly when they tend to ruin and destructions whereunto
they which tend thither, are like unto their father the Devil, who is never
satisfied with the destruction of men.

21 As is the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold: so is every man
according to his dignity.
We have already had this same sentence, saving that in place of, So does
the Lord try the hearts: we have here, So is every Pro. 17. 3.
man according to his dignity. This is not to say, that man of himself has
any dignity or excellency, whereby he should deserve to be so handled: or
thus, or to have such and such reputation: for all men of themselves are
nothing worth, they are nothing but earth and dirt, filthiness and corruption,
and are filled with malice and wickedness: and so they deserve not to be
esteemed nor praised. But as the gold is more precious then the silver not of
it own self, for it is a dead creature, and serves to no use, except because
that we trim and dress it for to serve unto profit, S: unto delight: even
so, one man shall be more worthy and more excellent then an other, because that
God by his favor esteems him, and dresseth him for to make him serve as he
shall think good: as Saint Paul says: For who separateth thee? and what have
thou, that thou 1. Cor. 4. 7.
have not received? etc. And daily, the more that God esteems and sets by
an humane creature, so much the more does he examime and try him the more
narrowly, and exercises him by great assalts: as our holy ancient fathers
have always tried by experience, and above al, Jesus Christ our Lord, who of
himself only was worthy to be esteemed and praised: for he is the Lamb
without spot. It is he that has not sinned, neither was there any guile found
in his mouth. It is he only, of whom the Father says, This is my well
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And yet, he has Mat. 3.
been tempted in all things, yea, even to the going down to hell. Wherefore
when God sends us afflictions, let us not think that it is because he has
rejected us, or does hate us: but let us know, that it is because that of his
grace and mercy, he judges us worthy for himself, does love us, and that
he receives us for his household servants and children: let it be, that he
does afflict us for our sins, be it, that he would prove our Faith and
patience, and humility and obedience. For (as it has been handeled) God does
prove us by afflictions for diverse causes. As touching the Pro. 17. 3.
reprobate, forasmuch as by the afflictions which are sent them, they return
not unto God by repentance, and that they do not bear them patiently, but do
murmr and despite God, and are desperate, they are neither like unto gold
nor silver, but to dry wood, to chafe, and to hay, which is easily consumed
in the fire.

22 Though thou should braye a fool in a Mortar, among wheat brayed with a
Pestel, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
When we bray wheat in a Mortar, we vnhuske the skin, so that afterward it
is easy to separate the good flower from the bren: but the fool is so
obstinate and hardened in his folly, that for any chasteninges, how grievous
and sharp soever they be, yet can he not be deprived of it: as in diverse
places here before, Solomon has complained of it: and as we may show by
examples of the scripture: and amongst other of Pharao and of the Jews, which
God corrected by diverse and sharp afflictions. Wherein we have to note, that
albeit naturally we are al fools, yet the scripture calls the mockers and
contemners of God and of al religion chiefly fools, which will not amend for
any thing that may happen. And so, though he loose his time in correcting and
chastening such kind of people, Pro. 22. 15.
yet is it not to say, that we should forbear to chasten them whom we count
fools: for foolishness is bound in the heart of a child: but the rod of
correction shall drive it away from him. And albeit that for their sake, and for
their profit we loose time, and win nothing, yet it is very necessary to
bray them, that first of al they should serve for example, and other should
fear to commit folly. Secondly, that troubles might cease, and that they
which love wisdom, and follow it, might live in peace. Let us therefore
understand, that Solomon does not pretend to forbid that Justices Romans 2. 5.
should not punish fools, but he reprooueth the foolish of obstinacy, and
of hardness of heart: and for this cause does foreshew them privily their
eternal destruction: as Saint Paul says, But thou, after thine hardness, and
heart that can not repent, heapest unto thy self wrath, against the day of
wrath, and of the declaration of the just judgment of God.

23 Be diligent to know the state of thy flock, and take heed to the heardes.
Many do think it a vile and a base thing, and greatly to be contemned, that
man should be contented to rule his family, and the affairs of his house in
simplicity, which are fit and meet to help the necessities of his children
and household, and should not aspire as concerning the matters of this world
no higher. Such a man shall be counted faint hearted, and a man nothing worth:
and they will say, he is a cowarde and a fool. And therefore they that would
exalt themselves, set up their feathers (as is said) and labor to fly, higher
and higher: and to do this, they follow the Eryers, which find no house worse
then their own. And so, these men which would be esteemed and be aloft, do go
away far from their family, and seek to dwell with Kings, Princes, and
Lords of the earth, for to get riches, and to obtain glory and honor,
credit and authority, and to make their name perpetual for ever. This desire
is very disordinate: and therefore Solomon would not have us to follow them:
as he does show it us, when he says, Be diligent to know, etc.
Notwithstanding, let us not think that it is evil done for a man to give up
and forsake his low estate, when God does place him in higher state, and does
exalt him. As we will not accuse Joseph, when from the going out of the prison,
received Genesis 41. Exo. 3. 1. Sam.
it, insteede whereas he was a poor slave, to be the second in the country
of Egypt: nor Moses, when he left the flock with Iethro, and received the
government of the people of God: nor David, when he left his fathers flock,
and followed the court of Saul, and obtained the Crown, etc. For we must follow
the calling of God: but if we be not assured of his calling, let it suffice us
to take care of the riches which are in our possession already: the which
Solomon does signify by the flock and heardes. For in old time men were
very diligent to raise and bring up cattle: as we may see it in Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, and other children of Jacob, which were Pastors, and had many
great flocks. If we be not contented therewith, and that we aspire more high
after the world, thinking to bring us ease for a long time, and during which
time, to possess great riches, and to enjoy glory and honor, and to be in
credit and authority, we are deceived: as Solomon does show us, saying.

24 For riches remain not always, nor the crown from generation, to
generation.
The worldlings and carnal men, by the experience that is seen in the world,
will speak according to this sentence: they will say, that there is nothing here
beneath that is sure and stable, and that al things are subject unto
changinges, and that sodeinly they are removed and altered, yea, that easily
they vanish away. We shall see riches to vanish out of their hands which
possess them, either by fire, or by water, or by thieves and robbers, or by
subtle means, or by law and suits, or by excess and dissoluteness: we shall
see at this day, great Lords to flourish and prosper, to be mighty and
fearful, which quickly vanish away, either by war, or by death, either
violent or natural. As these alterations are seen with the eye, even so do
they confess them, but it is not as they ought. For all they which have not
known, neither do know the providence of God, do attribute such alterations
unto the violence and malice of men, or to fortune and chance, and so much as
in them lies, they deprive God of his government, and do spoil him of his
Majesty, glory, and power. And so, it is not true, that the worldlings and
carnal men speak agreeable to this sentence, but in appearance only: for
Solomon does not here in any wise pretend to derogate the government, glory,
power, and Majesty of God, but rather to maintain them, when he pronounces
that the riches and honors of the world are of no long continuance: and
herein he confesses the providence of God. Otherwise, he should not have
spoken in true wisdom: Pro. 8. 14. 15 16. and 10. 22 and 16. 9. 33
and also he should speak against himself. For here before speaking in the
person of wisdom, he has said, I have counsel and wisdom, I have
understanding, and I have strength, etc. And the blessing of the Lord does
make men rich. And the heart of man purposes his way: but the Lord does
direct his steps. The lot is cast into the lap: but the whole disposition
thereof, is of the Lord. Daniel also did well know the providence of God: as
appears Dan. 2. 20. 21. 22. and 4 14.
in his book. Wherefore, let us not be careful to attain unto high degree:
but whilst it shall please the Lord that we are in a low state, let us not
loose that which our fields bring forth, but let us with care and diligence
gather them, according as God has sent it us, and showed in our earthly
possessions: the which Solomon does signify by the mountains, saying,

25 The heye discovers it self, and the grass appears, and the herbs of
the mountains are gathered.
He speaks thus, after the situation of the land that the Lord had given to
the children of Israel, wherein there were a multitude of mountains. And as we
must be diligent to gather the goods that God gives us, even so also, ought
we not to be curious of brave and costly garments, which may be of great
show, and great price, nor a multitude of men living of our wages, for to do
our work with so great superfluous exspences, or to be about us to reverence
us: but according to the profit that we can lawfully spend by our revenue, let
us be clothed, and hold servants to do our work, Solomon does teach the
same, saying,

26 The Lambs are for thy clothing, and the Goats are the price of the field.
Likewise we should not be greedy of dainty and delicate dishes, nor to be
superfluous and excessive in eating and drinking, as wantons, gluttons,
drunkardes, nor to deny food to those which do our work, as unmerciful and
cruel men which suck the blood and the substance of their hirelinges as much
as they can: but let us be sober and temperate, contenting ourselves with
little: and as we would be nourished, even so, let us administer necessities
unto our servants, maids, and hirelings: according to that which Solomon
does teach us, saying,

27 And let the milk of the Goats be sufficient for thy food, for the food
of thy family, and for the sustenance of thy maids.
And as we must be sober, so must we maintain our family, our children and
household servants in sobriety. And thus in these five last sentences, we are
taught to fly covetousness, and to content ourselves with things present,
not to be ambitious, but to continue and hold still the state wherein God has
placed us, walking in the same with all humbleness, to abhor al braveness
and gorgeous attires, walking with simple and honest garments: and to hate
daintiness, gluttony and drunkenness, using common meats with soberness
and temperancie.

The xxviii. Chapter.
1 The wicked fly, when none pursues: but the righteous are bold as a Lion.
WE do al naturally desire to have peace and rest, to live safely and without
fear, and also to flourishe, to triumph and to prosper in this world. This
desire of it self is not evil: but the means most often times are unlawful
and wicked, by the which men labor to enjoy their desires: and also our mind
and heart is fixed and set so much therevppon, that we suffer ourselves by
them to be transported and carried away, neither do we care what we do,
provided that we may come to enjoy them. The wicked for to accomplish their
desires, will not care what they do, but will run hither and thither, up and
down, doing oppression and violence unto the innocent, which can not be
revenged: as Cain against Abel his brother: the sons of Jacob against Joseph
their brother, Pharao against the children of I-Isreal, and Judas against Jesus
Christ. But as these have obtained nothing by their violence and oppression,
even so al wicked me^ shall profit little better. And albeit that in man's
judgment and outward appearance we tremble and quake under them, and that we
on the one side do greatly fear their presence, and that they on the other
side are bold and safe, and fear no man, yet for all that in spyte of them,
and let them do what they can, their conscience does reprove and rebuke them
so lively, that though no man do pursue and hunt them, but that all the world
(as a man mightsay) does commend and praise them, yet do they not cease to
fear and tremble within: as we may know by the confessions which the wicked
before alleged have made, and by witnesses of the scriptures. And according
unto the threatenings contained in the law, Solomon says,

The wicked fly, etc. Wherein we have to note, that Solomon speaks of the
flight of the wicked in the plural number, and of the Leui. 26. 36. 37. Deuteronomy.
28. 65 66. 67. Esai. 57. 20. 21.
pursuit in the singular: and is as much as if he did say, Albeit that no man
pursues a wicked man, no, not one, yet do they al fly, and are al troubled
and feared by their own conscience, which fights against them. Contrarily,
although that in man's judgment, and outward appearance, the just and innocent
be poor and miserable, and that they are always in danger, and be never in
safety, and are not suffered to live in rest, and that men labor to fear and
trouble them by great pursutes that are made against them, and that it seems
they have neither place nor time, where they may be safe and in peace: yet God
makes them invincible, because he has purified their consciences, the which
do not condemn them, and because they desire nothing more then to obey his
word. And this is according as he has promised in his law. And by his
Prophets he does often promise, that he will deliver his poor sheep, and
Leuit. 26. 3 Deuteronomy. 28.
make them dwell in safety, that none shall make them afraid. Whereunto Solomon
accords, saying,

But the righteous, etc. Wherein let us note, that as the Lion of himself has
no power to defend and save his pray, and cannot assure himself, and be bold,
except that God had given him such a nature, and maintained him therein: even
as we of our own selves are not righteous, but the same comes of the grace
and mercy of God, which changes our nature and imputes the righteousness of
his Son Jesus Christ unto us: even so of ourselves we should fly as wicked,
but by the free promises he assures and makes us bold, printing them in our
hearts by his holy spirit. And this is the cause for the which we see the
poor faithful to be so constant in bearing the persecutions with joy and
patience. And as the Lion, (according to the nature he has received of God)
knows well how to use his strength, to assure himself, and be bold: even so
the righteous trusting in the righteousness of Jesus Christ, the which is
imputed unto them, do fear no power, whither it be earthly or hellish,
carnal or spiritual: but say with David, The Lord is my light and my
salvation, of whom shall I be Psalm. 27. 1. 2, 3
afraid? etc. And thus it is not in their own power that the just do trust,
assure themselves, and are bold, but in the power and might of GOD, in his
grace and mercy. For as of themselves they are bare and void of
righteousness, as they know well enough: even so also they know well, that
they want al strength, except that the almighty does uphold them, and work
in them both the will and the deed. Notwithstanding, let us understand, that
albeit none of himself is just, but that of our own nature we are wicked and
ungodly, yet does the holy scripture call us righteous, when we referring and
giving unto the grace and mercy of God, by the means of the obedience that
Jesus Christ has rendered for us, and trusting that he is our righteousness,
our satisfaction, and redemption, we mourn and lament our sins, and striving to
bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, in love unfeigned. For the principal
fruits that God requires that we should bring forth toward our neighbors,
is, that whatsoever we would that men should do unto us, we should do unto
them the like. And the scripture calls those wicked, which utterly despise
these things, and scorn the^, and delight in all kind of wickedness.

2 For the transgression of the land there are many Princes thereof: but by a
man of understanding and knowledge, a realm likewise endures long.
If we diligently read the holy scriptures, we shall find that the children
of Israel in small time have had many Governors, Judges, and Kings. And if we
ouerlooke the profane Chronicles, we shall see that in all nations there has
been often mutation and changing of governors, Princes, and Kings. The
worldlings and carnal, do not think from whence these alterations come, but do
chiefly attribute them unto fortune: yea, when a King has been overcome by his
enemy, we will say, That fortune was against him. But the holy Ghost by the
scripture does teach us far otherwise: to wit, that it is God who changes
Kings, and kingdoms, as seems him good: and albeit that he does change
them after his will, yet is it not without Dan. 2 and 4.
good cause. Sometimes he does remove and take away Kings because they be
wicked: as he took away Soul and others: sometimes, because the people was
unworthy to have good Kings: as he took Josias the King of Israel, from the
children of Israel, in the 18. year of his reign, or there aboutes: for he
was very angry against Judah, because of their iniquities. And this is the
cause that Solomon 2. King. 23.
sets before us, when he says,

For the transgressions of the land, there are many, etc. And because that
oftentimes we see it happen, that the people follow the manners of their King
and of his governors, we ought to be very careful and diligent to pray unto
God, that it would please him not to give us a King in his wrath, but that he
would place over us such rulers as are of a sound and perfect conscience,
and that will walk honestly and religiously, justly and uprightly before us, to
the end, that after their example, we might live holily and chastely under them,
separating ourselves from al iniquity, foolishness, and wickedness. Thus
doing, the Lord will not sodeinly change our governors, after he has given us
good, for to punish our iniquities: but because that through understanding and
knowledge, we have been turned from al offenses, dissoluteness, and
insolency, from al maliciousness, wrong doing, and cruelty, the Lord will
have pity upon us, and having given unto us by his grace, good Superiors and
upright Magistrates, he will continue his grace toward us, in prolonging, and
making their kingdom and government long to endure. This is it that Solomon
means, when he says, And by a man of understanding. etc. Albeit that
Solomon speaks in the singular number, yet because of the Antithesis, we must
understand that he speaks of many men, by whose wisdom and good counsel,
Kings and Rulers are confirmed and stablished, and are not sodeinly changed.
True it is, notwithstanding that whatsoever comes to pass by the
understanding and knowledge of many, may also be done by the wisdom and good
counsel of one: as the Ecclesiast. declares. We may also say, that a King
Eccle. 9. 13. 14. 15.
of understanding and knowledge, may long uphold and maintain himself in his
estate, and to let and stop his enemies from stealing his Empire and kingdom
from him: as it happened in the days of David, Solomon and Ezekias. But how
soever we take this sentence, yet have Kings, Princes, Governors, and Judges of
the earth, their lessons therein, by the which they are admonished to be
attentive Deuteronomy. 17. 18 19. 20. Psalm. 2. 10. 11. 12. Psalm. 20. and 21.
and diligently to hear the law of God, as it is appointed them: and that
they should not be ignorant, but learned in the fear of the Lord: as the holy
Ghost does counsel them. So doing, they shall not perish in the wrath and anger
of God: but he will give unto them their desires, and raise them unto glory and
dignity: as the faithful do crave and require the same, and as they affirm
and confess it. And as they should be thus ruled by the word of the Lord, even
so, also ought they to be diligent and careful in nourishing and mainteining of
their people. And for to finish this well, they must be diligent to maintain
and defend the good and quiet, and to root out the wicked and seditious: as
David does teach them, by the protestation he makes, and as S. Paul does
teach them. The people also have therein Psalm. 101. Romans 13. Esai. 3. 2. 3.
Osee. 13. 10. 11
their lesson, to wit, that they are admonished to live holily and innocently,
and not to provoke God to wrath by their iniquities, least God give them a King
in his wrath: as he has threatened before this time, the children of Israel.

3 A poor man, if he oppress the poor, is like a raging rain, that leaves
no food.
It is a very evil thing that is daily committed in the world, that the
mighty and rich do polle and eat the little and poor: though God Exo. 22. 21*
Leuit. 19. 13 Esai. 1. 23. and 3. 13.
has expressly forbidden it in his law, and that he does often complain
thereof by his Prophets. But moreover this is worse, when he that is poor,
shall extort and show such cruelty to them which are in necessity and
poverty, that he will pil and eat them. Solomon does signify it, when he
compares such a poor man which spoileth the substance and goods of the poor,
unto raging rain, that carries away with it the seed and trees with the fat of
the earth: and after the same, is great want and scarcity of vittailes. Such a
raging rain does not only not profit it self, but also brings great hurt
unto the earth, and to them which have dressed, sown, and planted it. Even so,
such a poor man as extorteth and wringeth from an other poor man, has soon
consumed that which he has ravished, and cannot be enriched therewith: for
that which he can get, and take from a man in necessity, is not much, but a
very small thing, in comparison of the great desire wherewith he is carried to
make a spoil upon the needy. And not gaining ought thereby, he does great hurt
and destruction to him whom he pilleth and spoileth: and afterward he cannot
help him, though he would. But if he that is rich and mighty, does take pity
and compassion of the poor man that he robbed, he has wherewith to help him.
And so, as it may seem, he is not so dangerous nor hurtful, as is the poor
that extorteth from the needy.

Wherefore, let us understand that the poor which have need of charitable
alms, relief, and mercy showed unto them, are admonished to turn away from
al ravening and extortion, and chiefly of the needy: otherwise as the
worldlinges and carnal, which look not to the hand of God, which sends
such seasons as him pleases, does curse the raging rain that brings
famine: even so, the poor which do extort upon the needy, shall be cursed of
God, who will cast them into an horrible necessity, wherein they shall be
perpetually tormented.

4 They that forsake the law, praise the wicked: but they that keep the law,
are angry with them.
There is none how wicked soever he is, that does not desire to have good
reputation, and to be placed in the number of honest men, as if he submitted
himself unto the law of God as he ought to do. And for to have this
reputation, they will do many goodly things which shall have some sight of
goodness, righteousness, and religion, the which shall dazel the eyes of the
simple and ignorant: but they that have a quick and sharp sight, and diligent
ears, and will apply themselves rightly, to know what they ought either to say
or to do, for to submit themselves unto the law of God, and not to decline
either on the right, or on the left hand, may judge and discern, that such
shadows are of no value. Solomon does give us marks and tokens thereof, by
the which we may so judge, when he says, They that forsake the law, etc.
When we shall know what it is to praise the wicked, we shall understand who they
are that forsake the law. And therefore we must note, that to praise the
wicked, is to commend him, to allow of him, to favor him, to reverence him, to
help him, to maintain and uphold him, to take his part, to defend and to
justify him: as do flatterers, liars, slanderers and false witnesses: as do
al Judges and Magistrates, which are corrupted with covetousness, ambition,
acception and regarding of persons, with cruelty and tyranny: as do al Kings,
Princes, and Superiors of the earth, which care not to follow right and
equity, but will have their will for every law: as also do al they which call
themselves Prelates and men of the Church in Popery, which are led with
avarice, and ambition, and desire to live in pleasures and wantonness. All such
kind of people do forsake the law: for they have no reverence unto the word
of God, nor love to their neighbors, and despise al good order, and al
policy well ruled. The present exposition Romans 2. and 3 1. Pet. 2.
of praising, may be drawn out of Saint Paul, Saint Peter, and others. And
also Solomon does show us that we must so understand it, when he adds,

But they that keep the law, are angry with them. For against praising, he
sets to be moved, or to be angry. Wherein he declares that they which
give and apply themselves rightly and with a pure desire to refourme their
spirit and understanding, their manners and conversation according unto the
word of God, and to keep good order and policy well ruled, that they shall be
so far of, from praising the wicked, or should favor them any thing, that
rather being inflamed and stirred up against them, because of their
wickedness, they will rebuke, chide, and reprove them, they will threaten and
condemn them, and according to the power that God has given them, they will
destroy and root them out: the Exodus 32. 27 Numb. 16.
which chiefly is the duty and office of good kings, princes, and superiors
of the earth: as Moses does well show it them. Moreover let us note, that as
to forsake the law, is to despise and reject it, and to turn al our mind
from it: so also to keep the law, is to esteem and receive it, and to give
our hearts altogether to be ruled and governed thereafter: and not perfectly
to fulfill it: for it is impossible by reason of their weakness of the flesh,
for the corruption of our nature, and for the relikes of sin which co^tinualy
dwells Romans 7. Gala. 5. Romans 8.
in us: as Saint Paul does well show it: but for Jesus Christ his sake who
has fulfilled it for us, we are delivered from condemnation. Some say that
they which forsake the law, are moved against them that keep the law.

5 Malicious men understand not judgment: but they that seek the Lord,
understand al things.
When a man delights not to do a thing, or does not accept and take in good
part that which is told him, he will say he Psalm. 36. 3.
understands nothing. According to the which sense it is said of the wicked,
that he forbeareth to understand, and to do well. And according thereafter,
Solomon says, Malicious men understand not judgment: for when men are given
unto malice and wickedness, and that they think to do nothing but hurt, they
understand not judgment: that is to say, they take not in good part, that they
are showed what is good and right, neither delight to apply themselves thereto,
yet, forasmuch as for to punish the malicious, God does abandon and give them
up unto a reprobate sense, we may say that the malicious are so dull, ignorant
and blind, that they cannot know what is good and right: and for this cause
do turn away, and do clean contrary, as if they had conspired to turn al
vpside down. In the number of such, we may chiefly place al wicked judges,
Psalm. 82. 5.
of whom it is said, they will not be learned, nor understand, but walk on
still in darkness: and al they also which falsely usurp the title of Pastors
and Ministers, of whom it is said, The Priests said not, Where is the
Lord? and they that should minister the law, knew me not: the pastors
also offend against me, and the Prophets prophesied in Baal, and went after
things that did Iere. 2. 8.
not profit. And finally, we may place al contemners and scorners of God and
of his word: for they understand not judgment, but are rebellious against
God, and outrageous and cruel against their neighbors, without any remorse or
care of amendment: the which is a certain argument that they do not delight
in any thing that is good and right, and will understand nothing therein. This
kind of blindness or blockishnesse does proceed of contempt of God, whom
they will not vouchsafe to call upon, nor accknowledge as they ought. Solomon
does signify this same, by his Antithesis or contrary, when he says,

But they that seek the Lord, etc. And therewith he shows us that if we
will take delight in goodness and righteousness, and willingly to hear
admonition, and to be set in the right way, we must seek God, in calling
upon him, praising, thanking and confessing that he is the author of al
goodness, and therefore must needs wholly submit ourselves unto his word,
which is the rule of al righteousness and equity. Thus doing, we shall
understand whatsoever we ought to do, for to serve God in a sound conscience,
and our neighbors in true love. Herein consists and stands the right
understanding of the judgment that God requires of us: as we may understand
by the scripture, when David joins understanding with the service of God. To
the end therefore that we may understand judgment as we ought, and that we
Deuteronomy. 29. 9. Pro. 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
may want nothing of that which we ought to understand, but may understand
whatsoever is necessary for us to walk rightly, let us be diligent to seek
the Lord, as Esaias does admonish us. Now as it is necessary for us to seek the
Lord all the days of our life, and in any wise not to turn from his presence,
even as we are admonished, Esaias. 55. 6. 7 Psalm. 105. 4.
Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face evermore: eue^ so must we
increase and profit from day to day in the understanding of judgment: seeing
that we never understand it so al, that we can learn no more: for all that
we know and understand 1. Cor. 13. 9. 12.
is never perfect in this world, as S. Paul dot pronounce it. Wherefore, when
Solomon says, that we understand all, if we seek the Lord: let us therefore
imagine a state of perfection in this life, whereunto nothing may be added: but
that we have a right sound, and true understanding, according as the Lord
shall see to be expedient, and as it shall please him to give the measure and
portion of his graces. And when we see that the wicked are moved to seek the
Mat. 9. 13. Ephesians. 14 17. 18 19.
Lord: and also that Jesus Christ says, I am not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance: let us know that the malicious whereof Solomon
speaks here, are such as are obstinate and durate in their malice, of whom
Solomon speaks.

6 Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, then he that
peruerteth his ways, though he be rich.
When Solomon is not contented to have exalted the poor that walks in his
integrity, thereby the poor ought to be admonished to be contented with their
state, without murmuring, or dispiting of God, and without giving themselves to
deceit, to evil trades, or to rauishing and the every. And when he
suppresseth and blames the rich which is peruersly and wickedly led, then
let us al remember the admonition of the Apostle Saint James, Let the brother
of low degree, rejoice when he is exalted: contrarily, he that is rich, in
that he is made low, etc. Iam. 1. 9. 10.


And also let the rich tremble at the thereatninges of Jesus Christ, who
says, Woe be to you, ye rich men: for ye have your consolation, etc. and of
Saint James, Now go to, ye rich men, Luke 16. 24. 25 Iam. 5. 1.
weep, and houle, for the miseries that shall come upon you, etc. Not to the
end that they should despair, but in true humility of heart they should be
turned unto the Lord, whose blessing makes rich, and not the labor that is
taken to gather goods together with great covetousness: and that renouncing
the same, they should use the goods which God gives them, with thanks giving:
as have done the holy Patriarchs, which had abundance of riches, the which
they held, not with blame and offense. Likewise Solomon does not simply and
absolutely beat down the rich, nor riches, which are the good creatures of
God, but the rich that governs himself evil to the slander and hurt of
his neighbors, in gathering riches on al sides, and having gotten them,
denies to show mercy unto the poor and needy, fearing lest his goods should
decay and diminish, and the earth should fail. The simple poor man is better
then such a rich man: and that for diverse causes, as has been showed Pro.
19. 1.
already.

7 He that keeps the law is a child of understanding: but he that feeds
the gluttons, shameth his father.
When fathers and mothers are godly, wise, and prudent, and do follow the
word of God, then are they careful to instruct their children, and to show them
how they should follow God, and how they should live under the law* For
when the parents are wise, they greatly delight that their family should be
given unto wisdom, that God may be honored and served amongst them, and
that the house and affairs thereof should be in good state, and that nothing
should be wasted nor consumed. The children which follow the mind of their
parents (which is this,) are wise: as Solomon does pronounce, saying,

He that keeps the law, etc. By the law, Solomon does not only understand
the chief commandments of God, which do teach us to serve him with true
religion, but also al instructions which show us how we should govern our
houses in all soberness, modesty, and temperancie, that may shun and avoid
all superfluities, excess, dissoluteness and wantonness, by the which the
goods of an household are unprofitably spent. Solomon does show it, when he
adds,

But he that feeds, etc. Wherein he shows rightly unto children, that if
they will keep the law well, that is to say, the doctrine that is given them by
their godly wise parents, and will themselves also be wise, that they ought to
be contented to live soberly in their house, without desiring the company of
gluttons and drunkardes, for to spend excessiiuely with them: for if they
feed gluttons, so much as lies in them, they show that their fathers and
mothers never made any account to teach them: and so they do dishonor unto
their parents and make them ashamed. This that is said of fathers and sons,
may well be applied unto superiors and subjects.

8 He that increases his riches by usury, and interest, gathers them for
him that will give alms unto the poor.
Riches are the good creatures of God, and to get them and possess them is
lawful: but al ways and means to come by them are not lawful, because that
God does blame, forbid, and condemn them, for that, that in following them we
do distrust the providence of the Lord, and wound the charity of our
neighbor, not helping him in his necessity, but rather bringing him to more
poverty: Ezo. 22. 25. Leut. 25. 35. 36. 37. Deuteronomy. 23. 19
as they do which lend their money to their poor neighbors upon usury, against
the commandment of God. And therefore, if we will righteously get goods, and
possess them lawefully, let us beware we oppress not our poor neighbors
with usury and over plus, in taking profit of them for the money or other
goods that we have lent them: but let us follow the doctrine of Jesus Christ.
Thus doing, Mat. 5. 42. Luke 6. 34. 35. Psalm. 15. 5 Eze. 18. 8. 13
we shall be blessed, following righteousness: and doing contrarily, we are
wicked and accursed. Nevertheless when Solomon says,

He that increases his riches, etc. It may seem at the first fight that he
allows usury, and that he praises and commends him who by usury and
increase does augment his riches: seeing it is a mean and instrument by the
which he that is merciful gets wherewith to give alms unto the poor: the
which is a very Oseas. 6. 6. Mat. 12. 7. Heb. 13. 16.
acceptable service unto God. To this same we may answer in two sorts: first
of al, that God often uses wicked instruments for to acomplishe a good work:
as for to send Joseph into Egypt, that he might be governor of the
country, and might sustain his father and his brethren in the time of famine,
he used his brethren, Geu. 37. 27. 28. and 45. 5.
who were wicked instruments, miserably selling their brother Joseph. And when
God pleased to chasten his people, he stirred up wicked and ungodly enemies of
true religion: as Pharao, the Assyrians, and Babylonians, and other nations.
When it pleased him to deliver us from tyranny of the Devil by Jesus Christ,
he stirred up against him, the Scribes, Sacrificers, and Pharisees, and Judas,
who desired nothing but to sheede innocent blood. And so the usurers are wicked
instruments, whereby God gathers riches, for to distribute them afterward
in alms deeds unto the poor by merciful men. But for all this, the usurers
are never the more justified, either before God, or before men that rightly
understand the truth. It happens then by the providence of God that the
riches evil gotten are afterward by other means employed: and yet for all
that they that have geathered them, are never the better: for in gathering them
they have labored to hurt their neighbors: and in keeping them, they have (so
much as in them lay) famished and starued the poor. The second, seeing that
it is not lawful for to do evil, that good may come thereof, let us know that
the holy Ghost, for to allow and commend a lawful and good work, does not
respect what proceeds thereof, though it be good and profitable: otherwise
he should allow all the evils that are done against his faithful servants.
For we know Romans 8. 28.
that al things work together for the best unto them that love GOD, even to
them that are called of his purpose: and so the most wicked should be justified
before GOD: the which we must neither think nor say: but for to allow a
lawefull and good work, the holy Ghost respects the will and mind of him
that has done it: to wit, if that his mind were set wholly to follow that
which God teaches him by his word, after the which all our works should
be ruled. Otherwise, what goodness soever proceeds thereof, and what fair
color soever they have, yet are they wicked and abominable. Notwithstanding
let us note, that it is not evil done to augment our riches, provided that we
do no wrong to any man, and that we oppress not the poor, but that we
govern ourselves toward our neighbors, as we would that they should
govern themselves toward us, as if we were in their place and state, and
they in ours: as Jesus Christ does admonish us. And we must take good heed
Mat. 7. 12.
from following the opinion of those which say, that they do no wrong unto
their neighbors, when they would gladly receive and take money at the price
that they give it to their neighbors: for Jesus Christ speaks of a mind well
governed by unfeigned love.

9 He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be
abominable.
For to serve God as we ought, it is not enough, to hear that which he
teaches us, but also we must give our hearts theretoo, Psalm. 50. 14. 15 and
145. 18. 19 Mat. 7. 21.
and with a right affection set ourselves to conform our manners unto his
word, for to obey him: and in this wise we shall please him, and he will hear
our prayers. But for to be counted rebels before God, and to have our service
counted abominable, there needs not but the turning away of our ears from
hearing of the doctrine which he presents and offreth unto us: as Solomon
does well signify, saying,

He that turns away his ear, etc. For he straightly commands us to hear
his word, and has in all times ordained ministers thereof. And also whosoever
despyseth to hear the doctrine, does fall to al disobedience and rebellion:
and as he detesteth all honesty and virtue, even so does God abhor all the
service that such a contemner does offer unto him, how fair and holy soever
it appear. And thus all the service that the Papists do call divine, is
nothing but filthiness and stinking puddle. We must therefore be careful to
hear the doctrine, that we man obtain faith, which is the true foundation of
our prayers. As except we have faith, being assured that God does love us,
Romans 10. 17.
and will give us whatsoever we require, so far as shall be expedient for our
salvation, we can not with a free heart and earnest mind make our prayers
unto GOD. Even so can we not Mat. 21. 22. John. 15. 4. James. 1. 6.
be heard, except we pray in true faith. And therefore, Jesus Christ does
admonish us to ask in faith, and promises us that we shall obtain.
Wherefore, let us know that the prayer whereof Solomon speaks here, is not
properly prayer, but crying which proceeds of no right affection, but only
of hypocrisy, or of fear of torments, or of custom, and as if a man would
acquit a thing, in hope of gain and profit. With such kind of clamours
popery is filled. But Solomon does call it prayer, because it has some show
thereof, and that the wicked do so call it, etc. For also true prayer is never
abomination before God, seeing that it is the principal service that we can
do unto God: not that he has need thereof, but forasmuch as calling upon
him in our necessities, we hope to receive al good things of him, and not of
any other, confessing that he is the only author of al good things, and that
we can have them no where else. And also under the invocation of the name of
GOD, the scripture comprehends all the service that we owe unto him. Let us
note then that albeeit the law was not written until the time of Moses, yet
in all times there has been doctrine, whereunto it behooued to give Gene. 4.
26. Joel. 2. 32. Romans 10. 13.
ear, that such as heard the same, might believe in God, and obey him.
Otherwise the sacrifice of Abel could not have pleased God, no more then the
oblation of Caine. For without faith it is impossible to please GOD, Heb. 11.
6. It is not to say that faith must needs be perfect, for to make our prayers
to please God: but it suffiseth us to follow the steps of Cornelius, Acts
10. Furthermore let us note, that if their prayers which turn from the law
were abominable, by a more strong reason then must theirs which turn away
from the Gospel, be much more abominable. and they that are such, must look
for wonderful great torments. Heb. 10. 29.


13 He that causes the righteous to go astray by an evil way, shall fall
into his own pit, and the upright shall inherit good things.
By the corruption and malice of our nature we are all blind and ignorant, and
know not how to govern ourselves, nor what way we must hold to walk, and
to save ourselves from dangers, and chiefly from them which lead our souls to
destruction. Now albeit that by our transgressions and disobedience we had well
deserved to have remained in darkness and blindness, and to go unto
destruction, yet God has had mercy on us, and for to open the eyes of our
understanding, he has given us his word, the which Psa. 119. 105
serves us as a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our steps: yea it is
the way whereby we must walk, if we will not err. And for to do this well,
the Lord does print the same in our hearts, by his holy spirit, according
to his promise. Let us then Iere. 31. 32.
follow the guiding of the holy Ghost, and we shall not wander astray by the
evil way of offenses and dissolutions, of seditions, of vprores, of doctrines
and inventions of men, nor of other enormities, and shall not fall into the pit
of ruin, of destruction, of damnation and eternal death: but walking by the
straight way, we shall come unto life, wherein we shall inherit the true
blessedness which never shall fail.

Now as the Lord of his mere grace does give us such a guide, even so
would he have us direct the blind, the simple, and ignorant: and that so much
as we possibly can, we should keep them from going astray into the evil
way. And for to do the same, let us exhort them to ascend up to the hill,
following the prophecy Esaias. 2. 3.
of Esaias. Otherwise, if we give offense by evil doctrine, or evil conversation
unto our neighbors, and chiefly to them which are single of heart, and desire
to live sincerely in truth, justice and holiness, we prepare a pit for them,
but we shall fall into it ourselves: as Solomon threateneth, saying,

He that causes the righteous to go astray by an evil way, shall fall into
his own pit, etc. And in this threatening he does well show us, that when God
has reformed our hearts by his word, we must take diligent heed with what
people we walk, and we must needs fly a company of offenders and
dissolute men, whose lives are an evil example. Otherwise, what righteousness
and integrity soever there is in us, yet are we in danger to be corrupted, and
to forsake the good way for to stray by the evil. For also without such
companions we are so weak, that without the offense of other we do easily
run astray by an evil way. Behold David (of whom we say that he was a
righteous and perfect man, seeing that God does give him witness, that he
had found a man according to his own heart) who by the regard of his eyes
went 2. Sam. 11. Luke. 22. 32 Mar. 14. 17. 1. Kin. 11.
foully astray, by the evil way, in committing adultery and murder. Saint Peter
(for whom Jesus Christ had prayed, that his faith might not fail) went astray
by the evil way in renouncing his master, by swearing, cursing, and
forswering. And Solomon himself, who was so wise, was carried into the evil
way, by committing whoredom with strange and Heathenishe women, and by
committing of idolatry.

Now albeit that such going astray is wicked, dangerous, and mortal unto them
which give offenses, and not contented too be corrupted themselves, labor to
corrupt others and to destroy them: albeit (I say) that the going astray of
such men is deadly: as Solomon does mark it, when he says, Shall fall into
his own pit: yet is it not deadly unto the righteous and perfect, to whom God
of his grace and goodness does reveal, giving faith and repentance, to the
end: that in steed of the pit of ruin and destruction, they might obtain the
eternal blessedness which God has prepared for his children, for their
inheritance: as Solomon does note it, saying,

And the upright shall inherit good things. Wherein we have first of al to
note, that since that Solomon, against the pit, sets good things, he
speaks not only of worldly things, which are common both to the good and
evil, and are of no continuance: but he speaks chiefly of the kingdom of
heaven, and of everlasting life. True it is nevertheless that the just and
faithful do inherit the good things of this world, and do obtain Psalm. 33.
18. 19. and 34. 10 11. and 37. 9
them in such abundance and sufficiency that they have enough: and the
offenders, castawayes, and dissolute do often fall even in this life, into
great misery: as the Psalms before alleged do pronounce it, and as it might
be showed by diverse examples. In Jeremy there are great threatninges against
the false Prophets which Iere. 23. 1. Kin. 18. 4^
caused the people to go astray: and so were four hundred and fifty false
Prophets slain. Secondly, that the upright and perfect are the children of
God: otherwise they could not inherit this good thing: for the inheritance
belongs unto the children. Thirdly, forasmuch as this good thing is an
inheritance, therefore it can not be deserved, but is obtained by grace: as
also it is by grace that God has adopted us for his children.

11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit: but the poor that has
understanding, can try him.
The riches of this world are the good creatures of God, and by them in
wisdom and prudence, we may and we ought to bring forth good fruits of love,
pity, compassion and mercy, in helping with a free heart and ready will, the
poor and needy. And such fruits are of sweet savor before God, who
desires mercy, and not sacrifise. And they that are careful to bring them
forth, are very wise and prudent, in the wisdom of the Lord, but such
wisemen are very rare and thinly sown. As we may see by the great contempt and
disdain that the poor are in, by the negligence, unmercifulness, cruelty,
ravening and theuery of the rich: who are never satisfied, and have never made
an end in gathering of riches, but heap up still without ceassing: and so
doing, they think they work diligently and carefully. For as says Solomon,
The rich man is wise in his own conceit. He says expressly, in his own
conceit: for to show us that albeit the rich esteem themselves wise, and that
they would be so counted of other, yet are they not such indeed, for God
judges the^ far otherwise: as we may see it, when he rebukes, threateneth and
condemns such rich men, calling the^ fools thieves, robbers, and murderers,
and depriueth the^ of the heavenly heritage. Even so when by the word of the
Lord, we have learned to despise riches, and to govern us wisely in being
contented with that which the Lord shall give us, we may try the worldly rich
me^ and having found what they are by the word, to judge the^ fools. Solomon
does declare it so, saying, But the poor that has understanding, can try
him out. Yet Solomon does not simply say, the wise shall try him out: but he
says, The poor that has understanding. And this comes because that the
poor being in necessity, is more inclined and has more occasion to enquire
out the rich, and to judge that they are not such as they esteem themselves
to be, when they are void of pity and compassion, and use not their riches
as they ought. But either they lock them too fast (as do the covetous and
usurers, which are afearde that the earth will fail them) or else they fat
themselves only as hogs in a stye, or else do spend them in play, in
sumptuousness and pompes, in superfluities and excess, in gluttonies and
drunkenness, in whoredom and other filthiness, as prodigal persons: and yet
nevertheless care not a whit for the cry of the poor. He also says not
simply, the poor: For if the poor beee not wise and learned, he will desire
to be like unto the rich: and thus he shall not try him out for too judge him
to be other then wise, seeing he is of the same affection.

Furthermore, let us know that Solomon giving such wisdom of imagination
unto the rich, does privily denounce their malediction: for it is said, Woe
be unto you that are wise in your own Esaias. 5. 21.
conceit, and prudent toward yourselues. Therefore if GOD has given us
riches, let us not delight in them, as though for them we were more excellent
then other, and as if it were lawful for us to use them after the lusts of our
flesh: but let us humble ourselves, and behave ourselves faithfully, knowing
that we have nothing but what we have received, and also that we have
received it as disposers, for to distribute them according to the will of our
master. And therefore, let us not esteem and brag never the more for our
riches, but let us follow the admonition of the Apostle Saint Paul, Charge
them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, and that they
trust not in uncertain 1. Tim. 6. 17 18. 19.
riches, but in the living God, which gives us abundantly all things to enjoy.

12 When righteous men rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked come
up, the man is tried.
We mightily rejoice when we are at ease, and prosper, and come to the end of
our enterprise, and that we are not gain said nor resisted: and for these
very causes do we rejoice, as experience teaches. And therefore when Solomon
says, When the righteous, etc. it is as much as if he said, the people feel
themselves exceeding happy, and do much rejoice when the righteous do
prosper and have such credit and authority, that they will rule quietly,
without troubling or molesting their neighbors: then have we also matter of
rejoicing and gladness: as also Solomon has declared the same here before,
when he says, In the prosperity of Pro. 11. 10.
the righteous, the city rejoices.

Now that we must so understand this first part of the present sentence, the
second part does plainly show it, when it is said, But when the wicked come
up, etc. The which is as if he said, when the wicked do prosper, and have
credit and authority, every where they tread under feet, and do greatly
vex their neighbors, and trouble them, greatly extorting, doing wrong and
violence, robbing, spoiling, and murdering them. Behold how the man is tried,
or sifted out, in the lifting up of the wicked. For the joy that we have for
the righteous, we may bring forth Joseph the son of Jacob, Moses, Joshua,
David, Josias, and Ezekias. And for the trial of the man, when the wicked are
raised up, we bring forth Pharao, Saul, Achab, and other wicked ones which
troubled the people of Israel. Moreover, let us note that Solomon does show
us that we ought greatly to desire the prosperity of the just, and to pray
that God would maintain them, and not suffer them to be grieved and vexed.
Contrarily, he shows, that we ought to hinder and to stop so much as we
possibly can, that the wicked may not come into credit and authority, to have
power and government: for in their exaltation and lifting up, the world is
troubled and molested, and chiefly those which live religiously and godly.

13 He that hydeth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that confesses, and
forsakes them, shall have mercy.
Albeit that the hypocrites are wicked and malicious, and are filled with
diverse filthiness and infections, and are very abominable before God, yet as
if they were righteous and innocent, as if they were pure and clean, they
brag not only before men, for to be counted of them holy and righteous, and
to obtain praise and glory before them: for they do the works which have a
goodly Mat. 23. 5. Esaias. 58. 1. Luke. 18. 9
show of holiness and religion, to be seen of men: but also they boast even
before God, as he complains of it by his Prophet Esaias. And Jesus Christ does
also declare it unto us by the example of the Pharisee. And thus so much as
they can, they hide their misdeedes, and seek to be rewarded of God, as though
they were worthy of it, and had justly deserved it. But they shall never get or
obtain that which they think and desire to do. For, as Solomon says,

He that hides his sins, shall not prosper. Caine (as he thought, and as
he would feign have had it) did hide his sin, saying, Am I my brothers
keeper? but he prospered never the more, Genesis 4. 9.
seeing he was a runnagate and a vagabond. When Judas by a kiss betrayed the
innocent blood, he hid his trespass: even so also he prospered not, but did
miserably hang himself. And so they that think to hyde their sins from God,
shall not prosper, but the curse of the Lord shall fall vponthem, and shall never
obtain forgiveness: as never had Cain, Saul, and Judas: and also al their
like shall never obtain it: for malediction lies upon them, which think to
hide their counsel from the Lord. Contrarily, if indeed Esaias. 29. 15.
and truly, we feel ourselves grievously faulty before God, if we confess
our sins, and that through great displeasure and sorrow we forsake and turn
from them, and ask forgiveness thereof of the Lord, he will grant us mercy,
as he did unto David, Daniel, Matthew, Peter, Zacheus, and to the publicane,
and to the sinful woman, to Mary Magdalin, out of whom Jesus Christ cast seven
Devils: even so will he do to al poor which will turn unto him with an
unfeigned heart: as Solomon does pronounce it, saying, But he that Esaias. 55. 6.
7 Eze. 18. 30. 31. 32.
confesses and forsakes them, etc. Whereunto agree these places of
scriptures, Seek the Lord, whiles he may be found* call upon him whiles he
is nigh. Let the unbelieving man forsake his way, and the Lord will have mercy
upon him. Return you, and repent you for your offenses, and your sin shall
not destroy you. Wherein we see that to obtain pardon and forgiveness, it is
not enough to confess ourselves sinners: as Pharao, Saul, and Judas have
proved it, and felt it: but in confessing of our sins, we must leave them:
as did the holy old fathers: and amongst others David, Peter, Matthew and
Zacheus. But some will say that during this life sin does cleave so fast and
unseparably unto us, as we may well feel, and as the Apostle Saint Paul does
well show it, by the complaint he makes: and therefore they conclude that we
cannot Romans 7 Gala. 5.
leave nor forsake it: and so we never obtain mercy: or for to obtain it, it
is not required to forsake sin, and that it is enough to confess the same.
Whereunto I answer, Albeit that sin does not forsake us, yet do we leave
it, when we abhor and detest it, and that we suffer it not to reign in our
mortal bodies, Romans 6. Gala. 5. Ephe. 4. Colo. 3. Romans 8. 1.
but do follow what the Apostle Saint Paul does teach us of the
mortification of the old man, and of our earthly members. Thus doing, we
forsake sin, and do obtain mercy. For as says Saint Paul, There is now no
condemnation to them that are in Jesus Christ, which walk not after the
flesh, but after the spirit. Besides this, we have to note first of all in
this word to Confess, that auricular confession has no foundation in this
place. For when Solomon wrote, there was no popish Priest, but every man
privately confessed himself to GOD, and the people in common confessed their
sins, not in numbering them one by one, as the Pope would have us to do: the
which cannot be done seeing also that no man can rehearse the faults that
he does in an how respace. Nevertheless I will not condemn the confession
that is made unto men: for it is necessary. First of al, if GOD do advertise
me of my sin by men, I must confess them unto him, that GOD may be
gloryfied. As Joshua does admonish Acham thereto. And David being admonished by
the Prophet Nathan, confessed he had sinned. Secondly, Iosu. 7. 19. 2. Sam.
12. 13
when we have offended our neighbors, for to reconcile us unto them, we must
confess the sin that we have done against them. Thirdly, it is very
profitable that we should open unto our brethren our imperfections, to the
end that knowing our necessity, they might be stirred up to pray for us, and
that by their prayers, we may be helped: as we are admonished. Fourthly, let
us Iam. 5. 16
note, that he which forsakes his sins, ought to esteem himself never the
more for it, but to humble himself, and acknowledge that he forsakes not his
sins of himself, but because that God has mercy upon him, and gives him
true repentance, and the guiding and government of his holy Spirit. Thou have
chastened me, and Iere. 31. 18. 19.
I have been as an untamed calfe. Convert me, O Lord, and I shall be
converted. Even so, Solomon does not promise him that he shall not obtain as
he has deserved, but that he shall obtain mercy. Wherein we ought to
learn that we do never so clean forsake our sins, but that we be
always still faulty: otherwise we should have no need of mercy, and should
not need to ask forgiveness of our sins: but that we should be rewarded
according to our deserts. The which we neither ought to think nor say,
except that we will be unthankful unto the goodness of our God, and renounce
his mercy.

14 Blessed is the man that fears always: but he that hardens his heart,
shall fall into evil.
We are often admonished by the holy scripture to fear the Lord, by
admonitions, promises, and examples. Gather the people unto me, and I will make
them to hear my words, the which they shall learn, that they may fear me all the days of their life, etc. Deuteronomy. 4. 10. and 6. 13. and 10. 12. Psalm. 22. 24.
25. and 33. 18. and 34. 8. 10.
Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve, etc. And
now Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but only that thou
should fear the Lord thy God, and walk in all his ways? etc. Ye that fear
the Lord, praise the Lord: and fear him all the seed of Israel, etc. But the
eye of the Lord is over them which fear him, and look for his goodness, etc.
The Angel of the Lord does pitch his tents round about them which fear
him, and to deliver them. Ye that are his Saints, fear him, for they that
fear him shall want nothing that is good. As touching examples, we have the
holy Patriarchs and Kings, the Prophets and Apostles, which feared the Lord,
in distrusting themselves: and also have done well. Now albeit that in this
book, Solomon has already at diverse times exhorted us to fear the Lord:
yet forasmuch as we never think thereupon as we ought, and that we trust too
much to ourselves, and that it is most necessary for us to walk in fear and
trembling, serving the Lord, as David does admonish us: for this cause Psalm.
2. 11. Pro. 14. 16
by promise he does exhort us now again to fear, saying, Blessed is the man
that fears always, etc. Him, that he calls now blessed, he has before
called wise, saying, The wise man fears, and departs from evil. And indeed,
he that departs from evil, does show great wisdom, wherein there is great
prosperity and felicity. Pro. 3. 13.
But he is not contented simply to say, He that fears, but he adds,
always. Wherein he shows, that we must persevere unto the end, in the
fear of the Lord: otherwise we should not work out our salvation, but
should fall into evil, as Solomon does declare it, saying,

But he that hardens his heart, shall fall into evil. That which now he
calls, hardening of the heart, he calls before, is careless, saying, But a
fool rages, and is careless. Therefore he that hardens his heart, is a
fool: whereupon it does well follow, Pro. 14. 16.
that he deserves to fall into evil, as he is now threatened. And forasmuch as
Solomon sets hardening of heart, and to be careless, against fearing,
therein he shows us, that for us righly to fear, we must humble ourselves,
and distrust ourselves, and become gentle and easy to be taught, under the
yoke of the Lord, confessing that therein is rest, and out thereof is falling
and destruction. And whilst we do thus fear, distrusting ourselves, let us
take good heed from distrusting the help of God, or to dout what love he
bears us. In this sort, in fearing and being careful and diligent to keep
us in the obedience of our God, we shall not fear to be forsaken nor rejected
of our God and Father: for there is no fear in love: but 1. Ioh. 4. 18
perfect love casts out fear, etc. If we believe that God loves us, his
love is so perfect and accomplished, that when we have any knowledge thereof,
we rest quietly out of fear, neither are troubled with any fearfulness. And
although we be not altogether exempted from fear, yet does it not let that
we should not enjoy peace, which we obtain by faith, when we have our refuge
unto God, as unto a still and safe harborowe or Haven from al danger, of
tempests and perils. Further more let us note, that as their felicity which
do always fear, does chiefly stand in the remission of their sins, and
in eternal life, even so the evil, whereinto the hardened of heart do fall,
lies chiefly in this, that having heaped sin upon sin, they never obtain
pardon, but are cast down headlong into eternal death.

15 As is a roaring Lion and a hungry Bear, so is a wicked ruler over the
poor people.
It is known that the Lions and the Bears are wild and cruel beasts: and
chiefly when they desire the pray, after they have been long without meat, to
meet with them is very dangerous: for if they have once caught their pray,
they tear, and devour it, without any remedy: for as much as they are
mighty, and do proceed therein with so great violence, that none can deliver
the pray from their paws or jaws. Even so the holy scripture willing to
declare the cruelty, violence, and power of men, does compare Psalm. 7. 3. and
17. 12. and 22 22. Esai. 5. 29. 30
them unto Lions and Bears. And now Solomon compares the wicked (unto Lions
and Bears) which have power and domination, and exercise their cruelty upon
their subjects, which are so pulled down, that they can not resist their
power, nor deliver themselves from the oppression of the wicked rulers: and
even so they are as poor sheep between the paws and teethe of Lions and
Bears. Solomon for to signify the weakness and small power of poor
subjects, uses a word in his lauguage, which comes of a verb that
signifies to attenuate, or to lessen and to make weak. And says expressly,
Over the poor people, feebled and brought down, the which is for to tax the
cowardice and slacknesse of the wicked, which dare do nothing against their
equals and like, but do counterfeit the valiant captains against those that
cannot be revenged. We may daily see that wicked rulers will favor the wicked,
which shall be amongst the people, and will oppress the poor simple. We need not
to go far of, to seek examples hereof. It is not long since, that we might
have said to the City which did boast herself of the reformation of the
Gospel, that which Esai reprocheth to the City of Esai. 21. 22 23.
Jerusalem, saying, How is the faithful City become an harlot? She was full of
equity, and justice lodged therein, but now they are become murderers. Now
albeit that the wicked rulers are mighty and cruel as Lions and hungry
Bears, yet as David took away the pray 1. Sam. 17. 34.
from the Lion and the Bear, and slew them: even so the wicked rulers cannot
always come unto the end of their enterprises, and to have their desires: for
the Lions shall suffer want, and be hungerstaruen. And this is by the power and
might of the Lord, which rayseth the poor, and beats down and suppresseth
the high minded: as have Psalm. 34. 11
Pharao, Saul, Achab, Nabuchodonozer, and many other proved true. Wherefore
though the wicked governors be cruel and mighty, yet ought we not to stand in
fear of them: seeing that the ruler of heaven and earth is on our side,
against them: so that we may say, The Lord is mine helper, I will not fear what
man can do unto me. And though we fear them not, yet must we not leave of
from obeying them, when they do not turn us away from the true service of God
by their oppression and extortions. On the other side, when the rulers Psalm.
118. 6. Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2.
are the Lieftenants of God (who is of a pitiful and merciful nature) they
ought to be greatly ashamed for degenerating by cruelty from him who has done
them this honor, to communicate his name unto the^, and instead to be gentle
as lambs, they should become like unto Lions and Bears. And when as they
should tremble for their destruction. For if God does give power unto his
faithful servants Psalm. 9. 13. Esai. 31. 4. Osee. 11. 10. and 13. 7. 8.
to tread the Lion under feet, he can also destroy the wicked which become
Lions and Bears: for he is the great and mighty Lion: as he is called by the
scripture. Moreover let us note, that when the wicked rulers are compared unto
Lions and Bears, that we be admonished for to take heed of the^: by a
stronger reason then, of that Lion the 1. Pet. 5. 8.
Devil. For these same make no war but for to get riches, and to take our
bodies, but the Devil seeks to devour us. And thus on al sides, we are open
as a pray: but, for all that, we must not fear nor be discouraged, for as
much as we have the Almighty on our side, who in time convenient can and will
safely deliver us from al dangers and perils, and to place us in safety.

16 A Prince destitute of understanding, is also a great oppressor: but he
that hates covetousness, shall prolong his days.
It seems unto the Princes of this word, that they have nothing to do to
labor to learn wisdom, either humane or divine: and therefore they are
blockishe and brutishe, and do suffer themselves to be transported with a
loose bridle, by their lusts and carnal affections: but God has well showed
them, that they ought not to be so beastly and ignorant, when for to guide his
people of Israel, he ordained Moses, who was instructed in all wisdom of the
Egyptians, and was mighty in doings and sayings: and that for his Act. 7. 22.
Exo. 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 17. 18 19. 20.
better instruction, and to make him more wise, he gave him his law, his
statues, and ordinances. He also has showed them by Iethro, when he said, And
do thou provide amongst the people men of strength, fearing God, and true, and
place them over the multitude. Thirdly, he shows it, when he willed the King
to write out a book of the law for himself. Fourthly, when he has placed so
many wise Kings over his people: as David, Solomon, Iosaphat, Josias, Psalm. 2.
and 82 Esai. 1. and 3. and 56.
and Ezekias. Furthermore, he does show it by diverse admonitions that he
pronounces against them. It is therefore a most wicked thing, that the Princes
and rulers of the earth, should be void of wisdom and understanding, and it
is also very hurtful and dangerous: as their subjects do prove it by
experience. For how great desire soever they have, to get wherewith to furnishe
out their easy living, and to maintain themselves long in credit,
authority, and power, and to do al things after their desire, yet do they
oppress the people by extortions. Solomon does pronounce it so, saying, A
Prince destitute of understanding, etc. When he is not contented to say
destitute of understanding, but in the plural number, says, Of
understandings: he shows that it is not enough for Princes to be wise,
gentle, and prudent, after the judgment of the flesh, but that they must be
very diligent to hear the word of God, the which is our wisdom and
prudence. And that they do commit extortions, of covetousness of getting.
Solomon does show it when he sets the hatred of covetousness against
extortions, saying, But he that hates covetousness, etc. He shows also
that the fruits of covetousness are extortions, and that they which do them,
are covetous, though they do excessiuely wast the riches that they rauishe. He
shows also that they which are given unto extortions, are of no long
continuance, when he affirms, that he which hates covetousness, shall
prolong his days. The which is true. For albeit that after man's judgment, it
seems that the oppressors and rauishers do live long, yet forasmuch as
when they think least, and rather then they would, they are taken out of this
world, they do not prolong their days. But though they which hate
covetousness, should decease this life in the flower of their age, yet
forasmuch as they despise the world, and aspire unto the heavenly riches, they
content themselves with such number of days as it pleases God to give them,
and had rather to dye then to live: and thus they prolong their days: for also
they obtain eternal days: and contrarily the covetous which work extortions,
do perish eternally. And before their end it often happens, that they which
do extortions are hated, and meet with many evil things which shorten their
days, after man's judgment. Contrarily, they which hating covetousness, do
no extortions, but use gentleness and liberality, are loved: and therefore
they are preserved and saved, so much as may be. The Princes here then, are
admonished to give themselves unto wisdom and prudence, and thereby to fly
avarice. For so far is it of, that we should prolong our days by
covetousness, that rather thereby we are destroyed. For, Pro. 15. 27.
as we have seen, the covetous of gain, does trouble his household. Hereunto
we may add, that which is treated of in 12. Chapter of Saint Luke, and 1, Tim.
6. and James. 5.

17 A man that does violence against the blood of a person, shall fly unto the
grave, and they shall not stay him.
Violence against the blood of a person, is done in diverse sorts. First of al,
in killing of our neighbor, as Cain slew his brother A-bel: and as the
infidels and Idolaters do, persecuting and burning Genesis 4. 8.
the poor innocents. Secondly, in doing some wrong unto our neighbor: as did
the sons of Jacob, selling their brother Joseph unto the Israelites. They
wrought violence against his blood: as they Genesis 34. 28 and 42. 21. 22.
afterward confessed it. As Judas betraying the innocent blood, and as do al
those which fayning to know the truth, do betraye the poor faithful.
Thirdly, violence is done to the blood, by thefts, rauenings, exactions, and
extortions: as did the greatmen of Jerusalem, and the common people of Judah and
Israel, toward the poor Esai. 1. and 59 Eze. 22. 17 Miche. 3. 9 10. 11. and 7
2.
and feeble: even as the Prophets do reproach them for it. Fourthly, violence
is done unto the blood, when we do not our duty in helping the needinesse of
the poor. For after we are destitute of love, there is nothing but hatred,
which is counted murder. Now after which of these foresaid manners soever we
do violence unto the blood, we think to make our profit, and to take our ease,
and to be in credit and authority, and out of danger. And indeed whilst God
does dissemble and patiently give the looking on, the wicked bear the sway,
do flourishe and prosper in the outward appearance: and therefore every man
is at their commandment, and they are maintained as if they were honest men:
and it seems that they should never perish, nor be destitute of people to
maintain or supporte them, but though he tarry, yet must they themselves (as
they tend to destroy other) fall headlong into destruction, without having any
man to give them succor for to keep them from it. Solomon does threaten them
there with, when he says, A man that does violence, etc. And for to show
that they shall not avoid destruction, he makes them like unto them which fly
and can not be kept back, and also find no man to pull them back, if they
meet with a pit, they fall therein. In the number of such people we may place
Pharao, which perished in the sea: Saul, who slew himself with his own sword:
Absalom, who remained hanging by the hear of his head: Judas, who hung
himself. These have done violence against the blood: and also they hasted to
their destruction, without that any man has preserved them. We may here place
the conspirators of this City, which had earnestly determined (as they
thought) to have done violence against the blood: but by the just vengeance of
God, they have of themselves run unto the pit, and could find no help to
profit them.

18 He that walks uprightly, shall be saved: but he that is froward in his
ways, shall once fall.
The worldlings and carnal men have in their heart and mouth this diuelishe
proverb, He that becomes a sheep, makes himself a pray for the Wolf:
and therefore they govern themselves in all ungentleness, violence and
cruelty, for to maintain themselves not only against them which labor to do
them wrong, and to be revenged of them, but also to oppress the simple,
feeble, and innocents. And indeed, they make them to suffer much: as
experience teaches: and also the innocents do complain thereof. And even
because of the infirmity of their flesh, they think that God makes no Psalm.
10. 1. 2 and 17. 8. and 44. 10. 23. Psalm. 37. 73
account of them, therefore they are tempted with the prosperity of the
wicked. But albeit, that the faithful feel strong afflictions, and that even
under the same they dye, yet do they not perish: for God does strengthen them
and sustain them, giving them patience and constancy, and very often
breaks the enterprises of the wicked, and delivers his faithful from their
oppression and violence, and thus he saves them: as the Patriarks, Moses, the
people of Israel, the Prophets and Apostles, and some good Kings, as David and
Ezekias. After the same experience Solomon pronounces, that he that walks
uprightly, shall be saved. But the principal part of salvation lies not in that
which is said, but in the remission of our sins, and in the possession of the
crown of immortality, the which they that walk uprightly and innocently, and
in the same suffer temptation. Contrarily, Iam. 1. 12. Mat. 5. 10
albeit that the wicked which live disorderly in all wickedness, do flourish
and prosper for a time: yet at the last, they fall sodeinly to destruction: as
many wicked have felt by experience: To wit, Pharao, Saul, Absolo^, and Judas.
And according to the same experience, Solomon adds, But he that is froward in
his ways, shall once fall. As also, they which have conspired to destroy the
Church of God have felt. But the principal part of their fall, lies in the
hardening of themselves in their frowardness, they are not only contented to
do frowardly in one sort, but run unto many wickednesses: as Solomon does note
it in his tongue, when he says not singularly, he that is froward in his
way: but in the plural number, He that is froward in his ways. And thus
hardening themselves, they obtain not remission of their sins, but perish in
them, and go unto eternal death.

19 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that follows
the idle, shall be filled with poverty.
Solomon knew well enough, that God had not created man to be as a stone, or
some other immovable thing, but to the end that he should spend the time
about some good work. He knew also that man, because of his corruption and
vicious nature, is much more inclined to cease from well doing, then to occupy
himself faithfully. And in this sort, rebelling against the ordinance of his
Creator, he well deserved to be deprived of the use of the good creatures that
God had given him from the beginning of his creation, and to be brought to
great necessity. And therefore, having compassion of his neighbors, he does
admonish them to labor, and to be occupied aboutsome work: and does the same
sometimes in threatening the idle and slouthful, and sometimes in making large
promises unto the careful and diligent: as we have already very often seen.
But because we are deaf, and will not vouchsafe to occupy ourselves about that
which we ought, Solomon is not contented with the former admonitions and
promises, but to stir us up the more, he sets down here word for word the
promise that he has made heretofore, saying, He that tilleth his land, shall be
satisfied with bread. Whereunto Pro. 12. 11
he adds a threatening agreeable to the same, out of the 6. Chapter, when he
says, He that follows the idle, shall be filled with poverty. As touching the
promise, it has bin handled already, and concerning the threatening, it has
bin also explicated and expounded. But besides that which has bin said, we
have to note, that Solomon compares Pro. 12. 11. Pro. 6. 6.
poverty, unto meat, and that very fitly: for as when a man has abu^dantly
filled his belly with meat, he is grieved and pained: even so, when a man has
long fasted, it greatly troubles and vexes him. Now sithe^s we will not be
filled with such meat, which is nothing but poverty, sorrow, and famine, even a
bitter death, let us take heed we follow not the slouthful, but diligently to
apply ourselves to do our work, according as we are called of God. Thus
doing, we shall have want of nothing that is necessary for us.

20 A faithful man shall abound in blessings: and he that makes have to be
rich, shall not be innocent.
The world is filled with falsehood, vntrothe, deceites, lies, rauishinges and
evil trades, as it is both heard and seen indeedes and words, in such wise,
that it is not certainly well known whom a man may trust. For this cause also
the holy scripture makes great complaints of such wickednesses, and
condemns all the world: and amongst other places it is said, The earth is
filled with wrongs Gene. 6. 13. Psalm. 12. 2. 3 and 114. 1. 2. 3 Romans 3. 4.
Esaias. 59.
and extortion. And also it is said, that God is true, and every man a liar.
And if Esaias made so great complaints for the untroth of the people of God,
must we not think that there where God was not preached, all was much more
gone astray? And indeed, if God of his grace did not except some from the
common condition of men, there should be none righteous, true nor faithful:
for we are all of one nature corrupted and defiled. And thus, so long as the
corruption of the world lasts, it is said that Noe was a man just and Gene.
6. 9.
perfect, we must understand he was so, not of himself, but because that he
found favor before the Lord. Likewise whatsoever faith, croath, verity and
righteousness was in Abraham and other Patriarchs, in Moses and other Prophets,
in David and in other most holy kings, in the Apostles and other holy
servants of God, the same came of the mercy he had on them, and regenerated
them, and Ephesians. 1.
sanctified them by his holy spirit, for to separate them from the corruptions
of this world. And therefore, when Solomon says, A faithful man shall
abound, etc. Let us not imagine that there may be found in all the world a man
that is faithful of himself: but let us confess that it has pleased God of
his mere mercy, eternally to elect whom he would, whom also afterward
he Ephe. 1.
would call by his word, that he might bring them to righteousness and
innocence of life in Jesus Christ.

And therefore, if the faithful man do abound in blessings, that is to say,
if GOD do endowe him with his graces and gifts, if he give unto him
abundaunce of wealth, if he give him rest and peace, if he place him in glory
and in honor amongst his neighbors: to be short, if althings come to pass
as he would have it, and that he wants nothing: and that which is much more
worth, if God give him witness by his spirit that he is of the number of his
children, and inheritours of those number to whom Jesus Christ will say, Come
ye blessed children of my father, Mat. 25. 34.
possess the kingdom which was prepared for you from the beginning of the
world: yet this is not to say, that he does deserve by his faythfulnesse. But
as he is faithful by grace, even so by grace does he abound in blessings: for
also God should have no need to promise us blessings, if we could deserve
them. Now forasmuch as there is none of us, but would gladly enjoy the
foresaid blessings, let us therefore understand that Solomon promising them
unto the faithful, true, upright, and perfect man, does labor to bring us to
abhor lying, falshoode, unfaithfulness, deceites, and wicked trades, and
does exhort us unto faithfulness, truth, integrity, and uprightness, for
to walk honestly with our neighbors, as we ought to do, without laboring to
be rich to their hurt and hinderance. Otherwise in steed of obtaining the
former blessings, and promises in the law, the curses shall fall upon us: as
Solomon Deuteronomy. 28.
does well signify briefly, saying, And he that makes have to be rich,
etc. He says not, which is rich: for albeeit that for the greatest part,
the rich are cursed and deprived of the kingdom of God, because they trust in
their riches, and are not stayed upon the providence of the Lord, and because
they fill themselves, and have their comfort, and care nothing at all for the
affliction of the poor, and pass not to feed the hungry soul: and also
because they rise up and wax proud, despysing the little ones, and so much as
they can, do tread them under feet, and that worst is, not caring for God
nor his word, but blaspheming his holy name, and by their violences and
oppressions, cause him to be blasphemed, ye the riches are the good creatures
of God, and the rich men that use them well, are blessed of God: as Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Job, and the good kings of the people of God. But he says,
that makes have, which is transported by his unbridled concupiscences and
affections, and burns with covetousness, and runs about in such wise that
he cares not what he does, be it good or evil, be it wrong or right, provided
that he can soon be rich. Such a man will hold neither faith nor truth, and
therefore he shall not abound in blessings: but forasmuch as he serves
strange Gods, setting his heart upon riches, and turning his heart from God,
and that againstloue he proceeds against his neighbors by unlawful
means, to enriche himself and to make them poor, he shall be accursed: as
Solomon does signify, saying, that he shall not be innocent. And it is
according to the manner of speaking of the scripture, the which threatening the
wicked with malediction and punishment, says, that they shall not be
innocent. True it is that the Exo. 20. 7. Deuteronomy. 5. Ier. 25. 29. and 40. 12.
Nehe. 1. 3. Luke. 16. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 10 1. Tim. 6. 17.
chiefest pain for such riches, stands in eternal death: as the rich
glutton and Judas the traitor do feel: but in abiding such confusion, they
feel great sorrows in this world: as Saint Paul does show it. Now to the
end that we may be exempted from such sorrows, let us fly covetousness:
and if we have abundance of those worldly riches, let us possess them as we
possessed them not. And that we may well do the same, let us obey the lesson
that Saint Paul teaches the rich.

21 To have respect of persons, is not good: for such a man for a piece of
bread will deal unfaithfully.
He says, that God is no acceptour of persons. S. Peter speaks thus after
Moses and the Prophets. And because that the superiors Act. 10. 34. 35
and governors of the earth have the pre-eminence and power from God, whose
lieftenants (as it were) they are, and even Exo. 23. 3. Leui. 19. 15. Deu. 1.
16. and 17. 2. Chro. 19. 6 7. Prou. 24. 23.
are called Gods, they are often admonished in the scripture not to have
respect of persons, but to be folowers of the most highest. Solomon in
following such doctrine has said, it is not good to have respect of any person
in judgment. But albeit that the superiors of the earth are so often
admonished of their duty, and threatened with destruction and damnation for
their disloyalty and unfaithfulness, notwithstanding it is seen that almost
every where the favor and respect of persons takes place, and judgment is
given in respect of persons, and that the one is borne up to oppress the
other, that wrong is done to him that has the right, and right to him that
has the wrong, that the wicked is cleared, and the just and innocent blamed
and condemned. For this cause Solomon is not contented with the admonition that
he has made heretofore, but to stir up and awaken the superiors of the
earth, to rule them, or to make them inexcusable and more guilty, he does
admonish them again saying, To have respect of persons is not good, etc. For
to do shame unto their superiors, and to show them their filthiness, he
compares them unto knaves and varlets, who for a morsel of bread, or mess of
pottage, or other thing of small price, will do, or take in hand to do
whatsoever a man would have, when he says, for such a man, for a piece of
bread, etc. And indeed it is a thing very dishonest and foul, that they whom
God has placed in seat, and does so much honor unto them, as to call them
Gods, should fall into the order of the most vile and abiectes of the world,
and should become knaves and villains. It is not to say, that they which have
respect of faces, in judgment are contented with the offering of a piece of
bread: we will give so much to a dog: but by a piece of bread Solomon does
signify great presents and gifts that are given unto Governors, Judges and
Magistrates, for to corrupt them, and to cause them to give wrong judgment:
And does show the^, that it is no great matter, nor of any great profit, for
to take gifts, and that if they had a noble heart, right and perfect, they
would in no wise take gifts, how great and excellent so ever they were, no
more then a varlet, which feels not himself an hungered, would not gladly
receive an alms of bread, but would have a piece of money: and even so a
dainty curre being used to the greasy kitchen, will not care for a piece of
bread. And thus the wicked superiors are here compared unto hungry dogs,
which cannot be filled. Esa. 56. 10. 11


22 A man with a wicked eye hastes to riches, and knows not the poverty
that shall come upon him.
An envious man is vexed, when he sees that his neighbors do prosper, and he
that is not stayed upon the providence of God, fears that he shall not be
soon enough rich. For this cause both the one and the other do post hither
and thither to get riches, so much are they carried away with sinister and evil
affection, the which Solomon does signify by a wicked eye, saying, A man with
a wicked eye, etc. It is not needful to expound what it means, to haste
after riches: for it has been expounded here before in the 20. verse. and
also it may be understood by that which has been said at the beginning: but
we must note that it seems to them which haste both by envy and by
distrust, that if they can gather riches, that they shall never want. Solomon
does pronounce it so, saying, and knows not the poverty shall come upon him.
He speaks after the opinion of those which haste to be rich, and yet for
all that he threateneth them with poverty, and declares unto them that their
actiuitie shall not exempt them from want: as we daily see the experience
thereof: and this comes because that God blows upon the riches of such men,
and their riches consume as smoke: and S. Paul does note it well, when he
attributes uncertainty 1. Tim. 6. 17. Psa. 34. 10. 11.
unto riches. And this is according to the scripture, which does attribute
vanity unto the riches of this world. And thus we are admonished to cleanse
our eyes, and not to set our hearts upon worldly riches, that we be not
tempted to ravish the substance of other men, but rather that by love we
should be inclined unto liberality: and we may assure ourselves that we
shall never want. Moreover let us note that the world esteems such men for
honest, of good wit and understanding, that can quickly become rich, and does
reverence them, but the holy Ghost pronounces that they are filled with envy
and falsehood, the which does blind them, and feed them with vain trust: as
they shall feel, chiefly when they are Luke. 16. 19.
with the richeglutton.

23 He that rebukes a man, shall find more favor at the length, then he
that flattereth with his tongue.
Those that are feeble and needy, or that are not contented with their state,
desire to make their gain at them that are great and rich, and seek by all
means for to obtain good will, and to get the favor of those which may raise
their state. And amongst other means they use to flatter, knowing that such
words are pleasant and acceptable in the ears of such as are delicate,
boasters and proud, which seek after nothing but the praise of men, and would
be exalted as high or rather more high then God. But they which walk in the
fear of God, and in all humbleness, do confess, that they have need to be
admonished, yea corrected and rebuked, and not flattered, but rather are
thankeful to them, which are severe and sharp. As David did receive the
reprehention of Nathan with all humbleness: as also Ezekias did patiently
hear the threateninges of the Prophet Esaias. They then that fear God, which
are wise and 2. Sam. 11. 2. Kings. 20.
humble: are not troubled when they be rebuked, but rather honor them which
rebuke them, will gladly hear them, and follow their counselles. It comes to
pass also that even they themselves which love to be flattered, think not
well of themselves for having given ear to flatterers, and at last come to
know that they which rebuked them, spoke the truth, and that for their
profit: and therefore at length they detest the flatterers, and do love them
that are sharp and severe. And this is it which Solomon pronounces, when he
says, Psalm. 141. 4. 5


He that rebukes a man, etc. David does well show us, that they which
rebuke us, ought to be best welcome, saying, Inclyne not my heart to evil, that
I should commit wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not
eat of their delicates, let the righteous smite me: for that is a benefit,
etc. Let us then learn, not to resist, nor despite them, which reprove us,
but rather let us give them thanks, and to love and reverence the^: for in
rebuking us, they seek not our hurt, but they seek our benefit, our honor
and salvation: where they which dissemble to see Eccle. 6. Pro. 15. 5. 12 31.
32. and 19. 20. 25.
our faults, care not though we go to destruction. Let us learn this same
of this sentence. To this purpose it is said: It is better to hear the
rebukes of the wise, then the song of fools, etc. If we pass not after this
sort to abase and to humble ourselves, we show that we are fools and
mockers, whereupon follows destruction and damnation. Let us therefore
understand that they which rebuke us when we fail either in words or
deeds, are organes and instruments by whom God will pull us back from death,
and bring us to life.

24 He that robs his father and mother, and says, it is notransgression,
is the companion of a man that destroys.
The fathers and mothers which govern and guide their children as it behooves,
are not without great care and great pain: for they desire that their children
should profit and prosper, and should chiefly grow in wisdom and
discretion: and herein they bear a great love unto their children. For this
cause, God not willing that children should be unthankful toward their
parents does command, Exo. 20. 1^*
Honor thy father and thy mother. This honor stands not in words and
gestures of the body only, but in reverence and fear, in obedience, help,
succor and service also: so that the children, for to give the honor they owe
unto their fathers and mothers, ought to have such affection toward them,
that they should love them, commend them, and greatly to fear their
displeasure, and to do all things in such sort, that their parents do suffer
no loss, through their fault: but so much as in them is, they should help
them to ease, and be altogether at their commandment. Solomon does teach us
briefly, saying, Hear thy Father, who has begotten thee, etc. The same does
our Lord, and S. Paul. Wherefore, Prou. 23. 22 Mat. 15. 3. Mar. 7. 9. Ephe.
6. 1. Col. 3. 20.
when in steed that the children are bound to sustain Father and Mother,
they spoil them of their wealth, so far is it of, that they honor them,
that they rather use cruelty, as thieves do against poor passengers. The
thieves will say they are honest men: even so the children, because they are
the heirs of their parents, will not think they have offended, though they
draw unto themselves the substance and goods of their parents: but Solomon
does deny, that they do well, but says that they exercise the transgression
of thieves, which lie in weight for to rob and spoil such as pass by them,
when he says: He that robs his Father and Mother etc. This sentence might
well seem strange unto children, which will not obey their Fathers and
Mothers, but will be masters over the goods of their parents, and spend them
at their pleasure, because they think themselves to be heirs of them. But
Solomon does handle them very gently, when he compares them but unto
thieves: for truly, they are worse, seeing they are bound unto their fathers
and mothers by a double band, yea threefolde: to wit, for creation, generation
and bringing up: and very thieves will have respect to do no wrong nor violence
unto them of their blood: and to hold their hand, will go far from them,
and be afraid to meet with them. Children then are admonished to preserve
the wealth of their fathers and mothers, and in no wise to spoil them of it:
otherwise they shall be like thieves, and consequently deserve death.

25 He that is of a proud heart, stirs up strife: but he that trusts in
the Lord* shall be fat.
The worldlinges and carnal minded, which desire to prosper and to be rich,
and to make their particular profit, be it to the hurt of another, or
otherwise, are led and carried with an overboldness, arrogancy and proud
heart, so that where they esteem their neighbors to give them some let,
whereby they cannot attain to their purpose, they are incontinently ready to
show that they are not fain thearted, but that it is whole right, as it is
said. And for to show the same, they begin to braule and contend against
them which mind them no hurt, and do dog them, laboring to destroy them,
for to come unto their purpose and desire, that is, to be fat, and to be at
their ease, to the hurt of their neighbors: as did Caine, Pharao, Saul, and
other proud hearts: and as we have seen it, and do still see by experience.
According to the which Solomon pronounces, saying,

He that is of a proud heart, stirs up strife. Heereunto agrees S. James,
from whence comes strife and debate amongst James. 4. 1.
you? Is it not hereof, to wit, of your lusts? etc. Now that the proud,
whose heart is gross, do stir up strife, thinking to be fat and to take
their ease, Solomon does show it, when against the same he adds, but he
that trusts in the Lord, shall be fat. And also therewith he shows that
the highminded do not come to that whereunto they pretend, and obtain not
their desires: for it is as much as if he said, ye lust, and have not:
yeenuie, and have indignation, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, and get
nothing, because ye ask not: but the humble and patient which stir up no
strifes to maintain themselves thereby in prosperity, and to live in wealth,
at their ease, but rather suffer to be spoiled: such humble minded trusting in
the Lord, and depending of his providence, goodness and liberallitie, shall
abound in wealth. For the Psalm. 10. 11. and 33. 18. 19. and 34. 8. Iere. 17 7.
8.
Lord never fails them that put their trust in him: as we see that many
Saints have proved it true by experience: and also God who neither lies nor
ca^lye, has so promised. Moreover let us note that the scripture uses this
word to be fat, after our manner of speech. For when a man is welthy, we will
say of him he is very fat, or full. And albeit that fatnes is promised unto the^
that trust in the lord, yet let us take good heed, from esteeming that our
trust may be such that therefore we should deserve to be made fat: but let us
acknowledge that it is the gift of God, proceeding of his mere and pure grace
And therefore if we be fat, let us not abuse the abundance that God gives
us in dissolutenes and wantonness, in pomp and excess in superstitions and
ydolatries, as did the children of Israel, as we may see by the rebukes that
Moses gives them. Let us note also that to trust in the Lord, is not to hope
in him, and to do nothing but to be idle. They which so use it shall be made
fat. In trusting in the Lord we must bestow our time in well doing, and by
the fattning we have received, to fat also the needy and poor, and thus we
shall abound. chapter. 11. 24. 25.

26 He that trusts in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walks in
wisdom, shall be delivered.
The gentle hearted do take great matters in hand, and do put themselves in
hazard of many dangers, and it comes of the great courage they have, and
that they think they have wit and understanding enough, for to end their
matters, and to know to avoid the dangers. When they do thus, they think
themselves to be wise and quick witted, but the holy Ghost pronounces
contrarily, saying,

He that trusts in his own heart, is a fool. Wherein we have too note, that
to trust in our heart, is too make account of ourselves, and to be governed and
ruled after our own fantasy, without taking heed what end we shall come
to, and have, and without knowing whether GOD does allow our enterprise, or
not, and if we put ourselves in danger, whether he will give deliverance, or
no. Solomon does show it by the Antithesis, attributing deliverance unto
wisdom, when he says, But he that walkethin wisdom, shall be delivered. Many
have tried it by experience, as the Patriarchs, and other Saints. And albeit,
that in man's judgment and outward apparaunce, the most wise do perish, yet
do they not cease to have deliverance: for dying temporally, they are set
free, and delivered from the power and tyranny of sin, death, and the devil,
and are exempted from the torments of hell. For walking in wisdom, we renounce
ourselves, and cleave unto the guiding of the Lord, as he teaches us by his
word, which is our wisdom and prudence.

27 He that gives unto the poor, shall not want: but he that hides his
eyes, shall have many curses.
There is none that desires want, nor that wishes to be poor. And therefore
the worldly and carnally minded, for to save themselves from it, and carefully
to gather together, and enclose so much wealth, as they can by any means
possible: and they think, that by such means they shall avoid lack: and
indeed, after man's judgment, it is the best way that a man can take: but the
holy Ghost does teach us an other means, clean contrary to natural reason,
when he says by Solomon, He that gives to the poor. This is much against
natural reason, the which says, that we must gather and hold fast, for to
avoid poverty. She looks not to that God can and will do: she is blind in
the works of the Lord, and chiefly in those that he works according to his
free promise: the which notwithstanding are infallible: for it is true, He has
promised Deu. 15. 7. 8. 9 and 24. 19. Deu. 28.
blessing to him that gives unto the poor: whereupon it follows well, that
he shall never want. For blessing signifies abundance of riches, and
contrarily, cursing signifies want of riches, miseries, calamities and
sorrows. And after this signification, Solomon threatens the churlish and
cruel, the thieves and robbers, the covetous and insatiable throtes, which
regard the poor nothing pitifully, nor have any compassion of them: he
threatens them, I say, that as they are not merciful, and suffer the poor to
endure many griefs, afflictions, and sorrows, yea and disdain, and abhor
them, and are rather ready to curse them, then to bless them, and to trouble
them, then to maintain them: even so shall God grievously punish them, and in
diverse manners: as Solomon does signify rightly, when he is not alone
contented to say, that he which hides his eyes shall be cursed: but says,
also, that he shall have many curses: that is to say, that he shall suffer
many miseries. But his greatest and chiefest wealth, abundance and fullness
that he gives to the poor, stands not in abundance of earthly blessings,
but as he is merciful, so does he obtain mercy: the which Mat. 5. 7.
consists in this, that God does not impute his sins unto him, but in
forgiving him, does count him always righteous, and makes him to persevere in
righteousness, that he may continue in using liberality Psalm. 112. 2. Cor. 9.
Mat. 25.
toward his neighbors. And for the full measure of his felicity, Jesus
Christ counts the alms done and given unto himself, that is given unto the
poor, and does promise to recompense it with the kingdom of heaven. Even so
the woorst and greatest curses, that shall fall upon the churlish and cruel,
which care not to show mercy to the poor, are not the sorrows that be
suffered for want of earthly riches: but because that God imputes their Deu.
15. 5. James. 2. 13. Mat. 15.
sins unto them, and condemns them without mercy. For because they have
despised the Son of God in his members, therefore shall they be sent into
the fire, that never shall be quenched.

28 When the wicked rise up, a man hides himself: but when they perish, the
righteous increase.
They that have the election and free choice of placing rulers and governors,
either in the Church for to preach the word, and to administer the Sacraments:
or in the common wealth for to minister justice, in rendering right to him, to
whom it appertains, in maintaining the good, and punishing the badde, ought
diligently to take heed to commit the same to such people, as S. Paul
teaches us, writing to Timothy and Titus, and Iethro and Moses. For if in
such offices and authorities we raise up wicked men, or that they themselves
rise up, usurping the places and seats, orders and degrees consecrated for to
serve God and his people, the good, Exo. 18. 21. Deuteronomy. 1. 13.
righteous, holy and innocent, know not where to become. For so much it
wants that they may have audience, for to pronounce that which shall be true,
and to declare what is law and right, that rather they are constrained to fly
and to hyde themselves, because of the great searching that is made after them.
Many holy men have tried this true by experience: and amongst other, Moses,
David, Elias, and other Prophets, and the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:
who were persecuted from city to city, and were not spared, till they were
cruelly and shamefully slain. And as they have bin used, so do the Papists
still continewe the same against the folowers and such as hold the same truth
preached by the foresaid Prophets and Apostles. And to leave the Papists, we
know that of late in fresh remembrance, there has been a company of wicked,
which bragged of holding the reformation of the Gospel, which not only have
labored to cause that the good, righteous, innocent and quiet should hide
themselves, but also had devised to destroy them by treason, to the end that
they should have no leisure to hyde themselves. And therefore we ought to take
very good heed, what people we raise up to the seat of Justice, least we make
thereof a den of thieves, robbers, spoylers, and murderers. Solomon does
admonish us hereof, saying, When the wicked rise up, etc. Wherein we have to
note: first of al, that he speaks of the wicked in the plural number because
the world is fall of them: as the scriptures do complain thereof. And also,
when the wicked rise up, many cleave unto them, and show their wickedness,
the which before they held covered under the cloak of hypocrisy, and of
fear to be taken: but when they perceive themselves to be a great company,
then are they bold to follow their wicked enterprises, to oppress and torment
the good and innocent, then they think none can resist them, nor let them to
accomplish fully their evil will, as it seemed well unto Pharao, unto Saul, and
unto Achab, to the Scribes and Pharisees, and to all the persecutors of the
faithful. Secondly let us note, that when he speaks of the good, wise, just,
and innocent, which are not heard so long as the wicked, and their tyranny
bears rule, and cannot tell where to hide themselves, so that they are
compelled to fly, and not to be seen: he says not, that men hide themselves:
for the number of them is so small in comparison of the wicked, that as we have
already alleged once, the scripture complayneth that there is none righteous,
none that understands, none that seeks after God: and therefore he says
in the singular number, a man hides himself. For as it has been said, the
number is very small: And even so the Preacher concludes. Now that by the man
that hides Eccle. 7. 2^.
himself, we must understand the small number of the righteous and innocent:
Solomon shows by the Antithesis he makes, saying, but when they perish, etc.
This is not to say that the destruction and perdition of the wicked is cause of
the great number of the righteous: for there is none but the grace of God which
makes us righteous, and that for Jesus Christ his sake, whose righteousness he
imputes unto us: but it is that when we see the wicked are rejected and
punished, or otherwise we see their destruction manifest, and that the virtuous
and people fearing God, are in authority and bear rule, many fear, and
abstain from doing of evil before the world, and also will do the works of
the righteous, that they may be had in good estimation, and avoid rebuke,
shame and punishment. And also the good people which did not appear, and had
no credit during the authority of the wicked, and seemed to have been clean
gone, come again into light, are commended and honored, as they are worthy:
they flourish and prosper, and live in peace. Now albeit that we must stop and
let so much as we can, that the wicked rise not up, yea every man in his place,
yet it belongs to none, but unto the Magistrates to punish them, neither is
it lawful for any man to wish or desire their destruction, but rather we must
pray for their conversion: except that we see manifestly they be obstinate, and
past amendment, and are of the number of the reprobate.

The xxix. Chapter.
1 A Man that hardens his neck, when he is rebuked, shall suddenly be
destroyed, and cannot be cured.
THe doctrine of God, which consists in commandments, admonitions,
exhortations, declarations, corrections, reprehensions and threateninges, is
compared unto a yoke that is bound upon the neck of oxen. Now as there are
some oxen which cannot be tamed, nor made to carry the yoke: even so is Iere.
5. 5. Mat. 11. 29
the world filled with rebels which harden their necks, that is to say,
which wax obstinate against the law of God, and against his admonitions,
reprehensions and threatenings, as we may see by experience: and the
complaints thereof are contained in the scripture, even against the people of
God. And Deu. 9. 23. 24
as the oxen which refuse to bear the yoke, do tend unto death: (for when
we see that we can use them no longer, then we fat them for to kill them) even
so do the rebels and indurate which have need of the yoke of correction
and reprehension, and do with obstinacy reject it, do think well to play the
valiant captains to defend themselves, and to despyte them which correct and
reprove them. But God, against whom of set malice they bend themselves, can
suddenly destroy them without help: as diverse rebels do feel it well: and
Solomon does pronounce it, saying,

A man that hardens his neck, etc. And thus we are admonished to bend our
neck to the yoke of the Lord, that is to say, to become gentle and
tractable, easy to be taught and humble, when in his name and by his word we
are exhorted, admonished, corrected, rebuked, and threatened: yea, if we will
be preserved and Psalm. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 7. Acts. 7. 51.
exempted from destruction. We are often admonished hereof. Let us humble
ourselves therefore, and become obedient, that it may not be reproched us that
we are people incorrigible: even as Saint Steven does reproach the Jews
therefore. For since we have the word more clearly and plainly then had the
Jews, we deserve well to be suddenly destroyed and that without remedy, if we
harden our necks against the doctrine. For seeing that it is not of ignorance
or of infirmity only, that we err and fail, but do wilfully also resist
the holy Ghost: and thus by our sin we deserve to be bruised without help:
and also we cannot be helped: for sin Mat. 12. 31. 32. Heb. 6. 4. and 10. 26.
against the holy Ghost cannot be pardoned: neither also can it be repented
of. Wherefore we can find no reconciliation. We have to note further, that
they which take in hand to correct and judge others, and in the mean while
despise that which they themselves do teach, and also do as evil, or worse
then they whom they reprove, shall not be exempted from destruction: as Jesus
Christ and Saint James do well show. Saint Paul also does attribute Mat. 7.
2. and 23. 4. Iam. 3. 1. Romans 2. 3.
hardness of heart unto them, and does threaten them with destruction. We
might apply this present sentence to this matter, and say, A rebuking man
hardharted, etc. But the first exposition is received of al expositours, and is
the most meetest: For this cause we will follow it. Notwithstanding we may
learn, whether we be reproved, or rebuke other, that we should not harden
our neck: that is to say, if we be rebuked, that we should yield ourselves
tractable and easy to be taught, receiving correction with humility, fear
and obedience: and if we reprove other, to be ourselves of an vnreproouable
conversation, desiring of God without fayning that he would correct and
chasten us. For albeeit that men find nothing in us to be reproved, yet can
we not justify ourselves before God: for before him none of us of ourselves
are innocent, and he shall find but too much to be rebuked in us all.

2 When the righteous are in authority the people rejoice: but when the wicked
bears rule, the people sighe.
There is no people or nation how ignorant and barbarous soeeuer it is, which
does not desire to floorish and to prosper, to live at ease and in rest, to
rejoice and triumph. And for to obtain such pleasures, we arm and fortify
ourselves, we gather vittalles together abundantly, and labor to grow rich
mightily: we seek friendship and couenantes of them, whom we esteem most
mighty, or the meetest to help us, and save us from danger. And when we are
thus armed, we think ourselves happy, and are pleased: And therefore we laugh,
we rejoice, we leap, we dance, we sleep, we rest, and make us good cheer,
without caring for any man. The Gene. 6. Mat. 24. 38. Genesis 18. and 19 Eze. 16.
49. Luke. 17. 28. Dan. 5. 1.
world in the time of Noe lived after this fashion and manner: even so, did
the Zodomites in the time of Lot: even so, did the Babylonians in the time of
Balthazar. But the end of all these people has well showed that they were not
happy, in that sort that no man ought to rejoice therefore: for they miserably
perished. And for this cause also Solomon does show us, wherein chiefly the
prosperity of a nation consists, and wherein they ought to rejoice, saying,

When the righteous are in authority, etc. He sets the ruling or
multiplying of the righteous. For the people is never more happy, neither ought
they at any time more to rejoice, then when the just do rule and reign over
them, and is governed by a multitude of them. It is a very commodious and
profitable thing, for a nation, when it wants not righteous men, as we may
well understand it: first of all when God preserved, and delivered the family
of Noe from the flood, because he was righteous: Not that he had deserved Genesis
7. 1. Gene. 6. 8. and 18. 26. Gene. 41.
the same by his righteousness: for in that that he was righteous, it came of
the only grace of God. Secondly, when God promises unto Abraham to save
Sodom, if there were fifty righteous therein. Thirdly, the people felt it by
experience in the time that Joseph governed in Egypt: also under the reigns of
David, Josias and Ezekias they have known it: and now where the righteous do
rule, be it either in the Church, or in the civil policy, the people are
very happy: and so they rejoice. For to rejoice, after this sort, is to have
the possession of the things for the which we joy. Contrarily, to lament them
(when Solomon adds, But when the wicked are in authority) it is to be
deprived of prosperity, and to be in misery and trouble, and to go unto ruin
and destruction. Otherwise, the present sentence could not be verified. For the
worldly and carnally minded, do not delight that the righteous should multiply,
or have domination, but they rejoice when the wicked, which are their like, do
grow in number, and bear the authority. They cannot taste the prosperity
they have under the reign of the righteous: even as the children of Israel,
when David, Josias, Ezekias, and other righteous reigned. As they have well
showed, when they confessed not the blessings and graces that God bestowed upon
the^, when such men ruled, and when they triumphed during the reign of the
wicked, as if they had won al. They were accursed, not knowing that the wrath
of God was kindled against the^, and his vengeance prepared for to destroy
them. Let us therefore understand, that we have good cause to be glad, when we
are ruled by righteous men: for therein God does show us that he loves us,
favors and mainteineth us. And when he gives us wicked rulers, we have
cause to sigh and lament, and to confess that we have grievously offended: and
therefore, that God rejects us to destroy us, except we return unto him.
Let us also understand, that the principal of the world are admonished to give
themselves unto righteousness, whereby they handle the wicked rigorously and
sharply, and the good, gently and softly, that their subjects may live under
them in peace, and therein to rejoice, not after the desires of the flesh, but
after God: and that they which have to ordeine Magistrates, let them diligently
and straightly look of what conversation they have been from their youth, that
they bring not in such wicked men as were Pharao, Saul, Roboam, Achab, and
other wicked: under whom the people suffered much, as the holy histories do
witness. And if in the common wealth and administration of the civil policy,
we ought to be thus careful to choose good men, by a stronger reason then must
we have regard unto the Ecclesiastical ministry, where the governing of souls
is required, which are far more precious then the body and the goods. For
the wicked Prelates, by the tyranny of their traditions and inventions, do
greatly torment men's souls, and so do make them to lament and sigh: first of
al, in this world: secondly, in hell. But the good and faithful Preachers of
the pure truth, do comfort the children of God, assuring them of their
salvation: as they are commanded to do. And the people which have such
Ministers, ought to rejoice: as they are Esai. 4. 1. and 52. 7.
admonished to do.

3 A man that loves wisdom, rejoices his father: but he that feeds
harlots, wastes the substance.
Solomon has said before, that the wise son rejoices the father: and now
he says, A man that loves. etc. Wherein he Pro. 10. 1.
shows, that wisdom is meet for every age, and also that old age
exempteth not us from the duty that God requires and commands that we
should give unto father and mother: the which Solomon does not now name, yet
his intent is not to exclude her: but it is only to avoid prolixitie and
tediousness. For he labored to give us quick and short sentences, without
any derogation to the commandments of God. And this is not without cause that
he shows not only unto children, but also unto the aged, that such is
their duty toward fathers and mothers: to wit, to be given unto wisdom,
to love him not only with word, but with deed, learning thereby to lead an
honest, holy, righteous, and upright conversation, by the which God may be
honored, and our parents succored: in such sort that they may rejoice, and
have cause in their children of praising God, and to give him thanks. For, for
the greatest part, when men are aged, they persuade themselves that they have
nothing to do to obey their fathers and mothers, and indeed, they cast off and
reject the fatherly yoke. Some think their fathers and mothers live too long:
as did Absolon, who persecuted his father 2. Sam. 15. Genesis 9. 22. 4. 8. and 26.
34 35. and 28. 8. 9
to death. Some again do scorn their fathers, as old dreamers and doaters:
as did Cham unto his father Noe. Other some work wickedness for to grieve and
vex their fathers and mothers: as did Cain, who slew his brother Abel: and as
Esau, who took wives for to vex his father and mother. They that desire the
liberty of the flesh* and which by pride and arrogancy do reject the
fatherly yoke, count themselves valiant, and not to be fainte hearted: and do
count them doltes which persevere and continue in the obedience of fathers and
mothers: but contrarily, the holy Ghost pronounces that they are wise, and
do love wisdom: and so, have no faint heart, neither are doltes, but strong
and valiant: for they can well tame their carnal and unbridled lusts. Solomon
does show it us briefly, By loving of wisdom. For whosoever loves wisdom,
is also again, loved of her: and she instructs him in all knowledge and
understanding, and armeth him with counsel and discretion, with power and
constancy, with modesty, sobriety and temperancie: she decketh him with
chastity and shamfastnesse. Solomon does show this same, when against loving
of wisdom, he sets to feed or to entertain harlots: and against
rejoicing of the father, he sets, wasting of the substance, saying,

But he that feeds harlots, etc. Under feeding of harlots, he comprehends
al manner of vntemperancie: as pompes and sumptuousness, gluttonies and
drunkenness, daunces and games, and other dissoluteness, whereby we are
led to make excessive exspenses, and to spoil much substance unprofitably,
and to the hurt of other: the which is not to rejoice him, but rather for to
vex him and to bring him sorrow. Let us also note, that rejoicing of the
father, is by wisdom to maintain him, and to preserve his goods, and to
feed him therewith: or if he have no substance, that the son should learn
to be a wise steward of that which he possesses, so that he may help the
necessity of his father. Solomon had good regard heereunto, when he said
not, He wastes the substance of his father: but generally and indefinitely he
says,

He wastes the substance. For where the fathers and mothers want, the children
are bound to bestow their own substance for to succor them. Diverse do
understand by wasting of the substance, the loosing of the goods and waxing
poor: as the prodigal son. And after this sense, a man does rejoice his
father, when he behaueth himself honestly in his hoshold, and Luke 15.
that he is contented to spend sparingly, and where it is lawful, necessary
and profitable. For also fathers and mothers are naturally glad, when they see
that their stock keeps a good house, and do prosper: and moreover the
fathers and mothers help forward their children so much as they can, to make
them grow and prosper: and are more careful thereof, then to teach them the
fear of God, and love toward their neighbors: the which notwithstanding is
the chiefest point for to lead them to love wisdom. Furthermore let us
learn, that if the fathers and mothers will have true joy of their children,
they ought to be careful to nourish them, and to bring them up in the doctrine
and learning of the Lord: as Saint Paul does admonish them thereto. If the
Magistrates also will rejoice of their subjects, let them not suffer
dissoluteness and wastful spending. Likewise if Ministers will rejoice of the
people that is committed Ephe. 6. 4.
unto them, let them not dissemble their follies.

4 A King by judgment mainteineth the country: but a man receiving gifts,
destroys it.
They that have kingdoms, rule, and Lordship, that have credit, authority,
and power, that have administration, pre-eminence and government in their
countries, and over any people, do much desire that their subjects should not
break forth and rebel, but to live peaceably under their jurisdiction, and
would that their country should flourishe and prosper under their obedience.
But there are very few Lords that know how and by what means to maintain
their country in such estate. Some think that by haughtiness and pride, by
cruelty and oppression they should reign over their subjects, and hold the
country in their obedience. Some labor to gather riches and to take of al
hands to be wondered at of the people because of their great substance, and to
the end, that none should dare do any thing against them: and they think that
being rich, they have enough wherewith to revenge and to defend their country
against them that would invade and assault the same: and also to tame, and
order them, who by rebellions, vprores, seditions and treasons, would revolt
from their obedience and subjection. And in the mean while, they pass not
though the weak be oppressed, as fatherless children, widows and strangers:
they neither revenge, nor maintain their cause, but are given to flatterers,
to mealemouthed men, to players, to iesters, and to such as can make them
pass their time merrily, and also to them that labor too corrupt them by
gifts and by presents. And so doing, they will in no wise yield unto them
which in the name of the Lord and by his word do declare, that they ought to do
justice and judgment. And because that in this manner they are rebels, not to
men only, but to God also, who comma^deth the^ to judge justly: for this cause,
in steed of mainteining Exodus 23. 2. Leui. 19. 15.
their country, they destroy it, For because of their wickednesses, the Lord,
who is Judge of the world, who^ no man can resist, does take vengeance of
them, spoiling and destroying their country: as in the time of Noe, the earth
was corrupted before God, and filled Genesis 6. 11.
with extortion: and for this cause, he destroyed the world by the flood. In
the time of Lot, Sodom thought to defend herself with pride, oppression, and
other abominations: but God knew well enough how to take vengeance. The
children of Israel were defiled with like iniquities, yea, more horrible, as it
is reproched unto Genesis 18. and 19.
them by the Prophets, that they exceeded the abominations of the Gentiles
and Infidels: and amongst other places, they are sharply rebuked in the 1.
Chapter of Esai, and in the 16. Chapter of Ezechiel, Eze. 16.
and in the 5. Chapter of Jeremy. Even so could God well destroy them, as it is
seen by the holy histories. Now forasmuch as God is righteous, and does
judge the world, he will not therefore spare that people from punishment,
wherein there is no judgment, albeit he seem to prolong the time, and
dissemble the matter. Wherefore, let the Lords and Rulers of the earth, which
desire to maintain their countries, yield themselves obedient unto the law
of God: let them submit themselves to the Lord: let them do justice and
judgment, in rendering the right to whom it belongs, and delivering Deuteronomy. 17.
18. Psalm. 2, 10. and 82. 3.
the poor and weak from the violence of their oppressors. Solomon in few
words does teach them this same, saying, A King by judgment mainteineth the
country. He shows also what people we ought to place in the government of a
country: and that they which labor by gifts and presents to win the favor
of their Superiors and Magistrates, are deceived and beguiled: for by such
means they think to make their profit, but because they labor to hurt their
neighbors, and to destroy them, their own wrong shall light upon their own
heads: and thus they destroy themselves, as they shall one day feel, come it
early, come it late. Furthermore, let us note, that the Kings, Princes, and
Superiors of the earth ought to offer themselves to defend those that are
injured and oppressed, and to deliver them: otherwise, they do no judgment:
and that they which suffer oppression, ought not to revenge themselves, but to
have their refuge unto judgment, and without being led with desire of
vengeance. For it is not lawful to ask the help of superiors for to hurt our
neighbors, but to the end that we may live in peace, and obtain that which
is ours.

5 A man that flattereth his neighbor, spreads a net for his steps.
They that use sweet and flattering words to their neighbors, and uphold them
in whatsoever they say, labor by this means to be welcome unto them, and to
gain something by them, not caring whither they do any pleasure or service to
them whom they flatter, or is profitable for them: yet nevertheless they
persuade both themselves and them whom they flatter, that whatsoever they do
and say, flatteringly, they do, and speak it for their pleasure and service.
But when they know well they lie, they are convinced in their conscience that
they go about nothing else but to beguile and deceive the^ whom they flatter,
even with a most dangerous deceit, which brings death: as Solomon does
signify By the nets that they spread for his steps whom they flatter. For
as the bird that is taken in the net, is in danger of death, even so, they also
which believe flatterers, fall into great perils: to wit, either into shame,
reproach, and evil name, or into loss of goods or friends, or loss of life.
Our first father Adam, believing and obeying the flattering speeches of the
devil, fell not only into reproach and loss of goods, but also he lost his
life: Dalila flattereth Sampson, and spreads the net for him: Judge. 16. 1.
King. 12.
for yielding unto her demand, he could not avoid death. Roboam by the
flattery of young men, lost al his kingdom, except a tribe and an half.
Herod delighting in the flattery of the people, which cried, The voice of
God, and not of a man: was eaten of worms. Act. 12. 21.
Even so, we see that flatterers bring great hurt unto them that willingly
hear them. Therefore we must give them no entrance with us, but to reject
them, and abhor them: and chiefly they that labor to fill their bellies and
their purses, do most destroy the souls of them which yield unto their
words. Saint Paul does admonish us hereof in diverse places, following
therein Jesus Christ, Mat. 7. 15. and 16. 6. Romans 16. 17. 18 Col. 2. 8.
who has very diligently forewarned his Apostles of the same.

6 In the transgression of an evil man is his snare: but the righteous does
sing and rejoice.
When the wicked do give themselves to think or to do evil, it is for to
hurt their neighbors, to take them unprovided and to destroy them, though
they be innocent, and never thought once to Psalm. 31. 5. and 35. 7. and 91. 3.
and 119. 110. and 124. 7. and 141. 4.
do them hurt: as there are many complaints thereof in the scripture, the
which compares often the wicked unto foulers, hunters and warrenners. And
because, that without cause and wrongfully they ymagine the destruction of the
innocent, they themselves fall into destruction. And thus whiles the wicked lay
and prepare their nets, snares and pitfals for the innocent, they prepare them
for themselves. Wherefore, when Solomon says,

In the transgression of an evil man is his snare: we may understand that the
wicked devise the destruction of the righteous: and therefore must we beware
of them, and pray unto the Lord Psa. 7. 16. 17. and 9. 16. and 35. 8. and 57.
7.
that he would deliver us: and chiefly from them that labor to turn us away
from the true religion, and to deprive us of the pure service of God, and
consequently of eternal life: as David makes diverse requests for the same.
We may also understand that Solomon means that there are snares in the
transgression of an evil man, because that intending to hurt his neighbors,
and to destroy them, he prepares snares for himself, and is destroyed. These
two senses are both true, as we may see it in the scriptures, and they both
agree well unto the last part of this sentence, the which is contrary unto the
first, howesoeuer we take it. For albeeit the wicked are sharp and earnest in
persecuting of the just, who is weak of himself, and can make no resistance,
yet the righteous does not cease to assure himself of the grace of God and of
his help, defense and protection. Solomon notes this assurance, by singing
and rejoicing, when he says, But the righteous does sing and rejoice. David in
his afflictions has trusted in GOD: as he witnesses in diverse Psalms. And
as he is assured, even so does he exhort others Psalm. 13. 6. and 18. 2. and
56 11. and 59. 17. Pal. 5. 12. 13. and 9. 10. and 22 23. Exodus 15. Judge. 4. and
5. Psalm. 7. 18. and 58. 11. 12. and. 59. 17. 18.
to be assured. When also the wicked do perish, the just for all that do not
loose their hope, but rather sing and are glad. As when Pharao and his people
perished in the Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sange a songue. And wen
Sisara with his army was discomfited and vanquished, Debora and Baracke sange a
songue of thanksgiving. This trust or confidence is well set forth in diverse
places. Now that we must take this rejoicing and singing, it is plain enough
by that which is outwardly and temporally showed: for after the judgment of
the world, and outward apparaunce, there are no people more sorrowful nor more
miserable then the righteous. I say expressly, before the world: for the
righteous are always joyful. 2. Cor. 6. 10.


7 The righteous knows the cause of the poor, but the wicked regards not
knowledge.
For as much as the poor are not able to succor their neighbors, but have
great need themselves to be succored, they are therefore commonly destitute
of friends, though they have many parents and kindred. Solomon heretofore,
following experience, Pro. 14. 20. and 19. 7. Exodus 23. 3. Leui. 19. 15.
does pronounce it. For this cause, though that God does forbid to have
respect of the poor, and to prefer them in their causes, yet would he that
we should take pity on them, to assist them, to know their matters, to
maintain them in their good right, to defend them, and to deliver the^ from
wrong and violence of the ungodly and wicked. But yet no man cares to follow
the will of the Esaias. 1. 23. and 3. 12. 13. 14. and 10. 1. 2.
Lord therein, so that we may rightly complain of the iniquity that reigns
on all sides in the world, with the Prophet Esaias. It is not without cause that
I have said, on all sides of the world: for seeing that the Prophets do
complain so sore of the people of God, ought we not to understand, that
amongst the Idolaters, there were great opressions, and that unrighteousness was
spread over all? And also now it is very hard to find such as have care to
do right unto the poor, and that will know their matters, to do them right.
Albeit, that this has bin in all times, and is still manifest enough unto the^
that will see: yet Solomon entending to show how much the poor have great need
to be succored, and how they want such as should favor them, does mark
the foresaid difficulty, when he says,

The righteous knows, etc. He has noted it, I say in two sorts: first of
all, forasmuch as he says, that it is the righteous which knows. For it is
very hard to find a just man: as we have showed it heretofore by the
scripture. Secondly, when he says not, the righteous men do know, but says
in the singular number, the righteous man knows: for to show the scarcity of
such as have care to do right unto the poor, and consequently the difficulty
to find them out.

Furthermore, attributing knowledge unto the righteous, he shows that we
have knowledge enough, if we be righteous: for God does not leave them in
ignorance, whom he indueth with righteousness, and places in his seat, for
to administer the same: but gives them knowledge and wisdom, that they may
Job. 29. 16.
do their office. Moreover he sheweh that the righteous are careful to examine
and to enquire: otherwise they could not know the cause of the poor: seeing
the wicked are witty, and strive so much as they can to give light and fair
show unto their cause, for to darken the right of the poor, that it may be
overthrown. But (as has been said) the righteous that desire to do justice
without acception of persons, are endued with knowledge and are careful to
enquire to the end that whatsouer other go about to darken, the same might be
manifest unto them. Contrarily, the wicked judges and Magistrates, which
proceed through favor, by acception of persons, and by covetousness of
gifts and presents, should make no account of enquiring for to know to whom
the right belongs: they will know nothing thereof, they close their eyes,
that they may know nothing: and also when they understand it, they
understand not that same to judge justly, but of set malice do wrest
judgment. This is that which Solomon does express unto us, saying,

But the wicked regards not knowledge. And albeit, it is of set malice that
the wicked judges will not understand to do well acccording to the duty of
their office, yet the same happens not without the secret and just
providence of God, which blinds the wise of the world, for to punish the
sins of a country: as Esaias. 3. 2. 3 and 29. 14 Esaias. 1. 22. 23. and 28. 7
and. 56. 10.
he has threatened the children of Israel therewith. And as he has
threatened them therewith, even so have they had: as we may see by the
complaints that are in the scripture against the unrighteousness and
oppression which reignedin Judah and Israel

8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.
We have proved by experience in all times, and yet do try that the kings
and princes, the rulers and superiors of the earth rise up, and fight one
against the other, and labor to destroy houses, castles, villages and to wnes.
And they do the same, being led with ambition and desire of reigning, to wax
rich, and to be great, orels being moved with wrath and indignation, with
hatred and desire of vengeance. And albeit that men do such things of their
own will and set malice, yet do they come to pass by the just judgment of
God, which by such vprores, dissentions and wars does punish the contempt
of his word, revenge the violences and oppressions, the filthiness and
uncleanness, the offenses and dissolutions, the deceit and guile that the
mighty of the world commit and the common people, who despise the threatenings
that God makes them by his servants, scorning at his judgments, as though
they should never be attainted, albeit the examples are set before their
face: as the judgments that he has exercised in the time of Noe by the
flood: in the time of Lot, upon Sodom and Gomorrha: in the time of Moses, upon
Pharao and his people, in the time of David upon Saul: and many times upon the
children of Israel and other wicked scorners: whom we may reproach with
malediction. Woe be to them that draw wickedness as it were with Esaias. 5.
18. 19 and 28. 14. 15 and 5. 24. and 28. 7.
cords of vanity, etc. And to declare the punishment of such as Esaias does
foretell them, saying, As the flame of the fire consumes the reed, and the
flame consumes the straw: even so shall their root be like rottenness: and
their budde shall ascend as dust. By the abouesaide examples, and the foresaid
reproaches and threateninges, we see that scornful men bring a City into a
snare. For look how the destruction of birds is, when they are taken in the
net, or snare: even so does a country run to destruction, when the people
thereof is given unto the foresaid scornings: and chiefly when the Rulers and
Superiors are infected therewith. For if they scorn God, when he sends
them his soldiers for to chasten them, they will easily also mock at men: and
so they will kindle them more, and hasten them to make destruction of the
country: as it is well proved by the wars that are raised up in our time.
One Prince does scorn an other, and do so move and stir up one another,
that the one spoileth of the one side, and another of the other. Contrarily, if
through the fear of the Lord, the rulers and superiors of one country do
give themselves unto wisdom, and that they are careful to cause the people to
walk therein, then they shall not snarle the city, but shall appease and swage
the wrath as well of God, as of his organs and instruments, and shall deliver the
people from perdition. This is that which Solomon pronounces saying,

But wise men turn away wrath. Hereof we have diverse examples Exo. 14. 10. and
16. 2. and 17. 2. and 32. 1. Number. 11. 1. and 14. 1. and 16. 46. Eccle. 9. 14.
2. Sam. 20, 16
first of al in Noe, who by his wisdom turned away the wrath of God from his
family. Secondly, Joseph preserved and saved Egypt, and the house of his father
that they perished not by famine. Thirdly, Moses did often turn away the
wrath of God from the people of Israel.

Fourthly it is said that a little town, where there were but few men within
it, was beseeged of a great king: and there was a poor wise man found, who
saved it by his wisdom, etc. Fifthly, it is said that a wise woman saved a
city from overthrowing by the soldiers of Ioab.

9 If a wise man contend with a foolish man, sometimes the fool is angry,
sometimes he laugheth, but there is no stay.
It is not without cause that God gives wisdom to men, but it is to the end
that thereby they should guide themselves so wisely, that none should justly
have occasion to contend with them. And not only so, but also to the end they
should know how to correct the foolish, and to contend against them, in
reproouing them, rebuking and threatening them. They that are wise, do their
duty, when they so behave themselves. But they loose their time in the sight
of the foolish: for the foolish reject al correction, and do scorn al
instruction and discipline: as it is largely showed here before in the first
Chapter, and in other places. And besides that they despise and reject, and
scorn, they do also furiously persecute the wise which contend with them, for
to bring the^ unto amendment: yea, they persecute them without ceasing: as
Solomon does pronounce it, when he says, If a wise man contend with a foolish
man, sometime he is angry, sometime he laugheth etc. By the anger, we
understand the furious persecutions: and by the laughter, we may understand the
contempt, reiection and mockery, even with persecution: as it is so taken, in
Genesis 21. 9. Albeit, that the Hebrewe has diverse Gal. 4. 29.
verbes, yet are they al of one signification: to wit, to laugh and to mock:
whom Saint Paul does interpret to persecute. There are some that take this
sentence, as if Solomon said, Be it that the wise having any matter to commen
of with the foolish, whither he be angry, or laugh, yet can he not quiet
and content the foolish man. The wise man shall profit nothing to contend
with a fool, though he speak never so gently with all humanity and clemency:
as also Jesus Christ does reproach the Jews thereof. Now the diversity Math.
11. 16
of opinons does proceed hereof. For to avoid tediousnes, it is not openly
expressed, whether it is the wise or the fool that is angry and laugheth. But
in what sense soever we take this sentence, we see that the foolish is never
the more amended, after what sort soever we contend with him: yet most commonly
he does remain obstinate, scorning all exhortations, even with choler, which
is not soon quenched: as Solomon notes, saying, that there is no stay, or
ceasing, or rest. Yet is it not to say, that we should not continue to strive
and contend against fools, in rebuking, and threatening them: for GOD would
have his word to be declared unto all creatures, and that by the same word
we should labor to bring al men unto faith and repentance.

10 Bloody men hate him that is upright: but the just has care of his soul.
Because that at the first sight there is none so simple but seems well to
understand that the murderers do hate the man that walks uprightly and
sincerely. For this cause it might seem that Solomon does not pronounce here
any sentence of excellency. But there is great difference between thinking to
understand, and to understand indeed and in truth. For every man how
ignorant soever he is, does presume to understand: but it is very hard to
find such as truly does understand and know that Bloody men hate him that
is upright. For it appears not that a man is a murderer, except that by
deed of violence and oppression he kill and sley his neighbor. But we
think not that he does hate his neighbor that pursues him in judgment, at
least wise of hatred, for the which he is to be rebuked: though under color of
good right he labor to destroy his neighbor. And also for too show that they
may well hate their neighbor, in pleading against him, they will say, that in a
whole book of Law, there is not one ounce of love. And as it is said, so it
is practiced by them, which neither can demand nor desende their right, with
such modesty as is required, but suffer themselves to be carried about of
their affections, not resisting their passions. Now a man is a murderer that
hates his neighbor, and that without cause is angry with him, and who having
the riches of this world, has no compassion of his needy brother, is void of
love: of what state and degree soever 1. John. 3. 55. Mat. 5. 22. Mat. 5. 44.
Romans 12. 20.
he be, as it is showed us, when it is commanded us to love our neighbors
and to feed them. Whereupon it follows, that they which hate good men deserve
rightly to be called bloody men and murderers. The which notwithstanding the
world does not know, nor will understand. For because that upright men are
contrary to the worldlinges, which think themselves and would be accounted
wise and upright men, therefore the worldlinges labor to persuade themselves
that upright men are wicked: and therefore do bear them hatred, the which
they declare by their fruits: that is to say, by outrage, oppressions
violences and cruelties that they exercise against those men which walk
uprightly and sincerely. And because that they labor to deceive themselves
with false and cruel persuasion, Solomon does call them murderers, and shows
how they are blooddy men, when he says, that they hate the upright man, that
in no wise thinks to do the^ any injury or wrong, nor to use with them fraud
and deceit, nor with any other person.

Now he judges of hatred: not that he knows the hearts, but because it is
seen by his evil fruits. And albeit that al hateful men are murderers, yet is
this chiefly against wicked kings, princes, magistrates and judges, that he
pronounces this sentence: for seeing that God, who is right and just, and
therefore takes care to preserve upright men, does make and ordeine them his
liefetenantes, and gives them his place, they above al other ought to be
upright and careful of the lives of upright men. And not only, not to do them
any injury, but also to save and defend them from all oppression, in
punishing the oppressors and wrong doers. Solomon does well teach them this
lesson, when he says,

But the just have care of his soul. Forasmuch therefore as we would not
be counted murderers or bloody men, let us take heed to put away al hatred,
and to turn ourselves from doing any injury and oppression: and chiefly, that
we do no hurt unto them that walk uprightly and sincerely, but rather let us
be careful over them, and that with a frank and free heart we be ready to
do them all the pleasures that we possibly can. And thus doing, we shall not
be accused of murder, but shall be counted upright, even before God.

11 A fool powers out al his mind: but a wise man keeps it in till
afterward.
There are some that make a great account of themselves, and do also desire to
be reputed of toward other: and therefore they brag so much as they can,
and pronounce from their mouths all things that they think may serve to
win praise, and to be in admiration: and are so puffed up with vainglory,
pride and arrogancy: their hearts are so infected and corrupted with malice,
that if they think a man does or says any thing that is contrary unto their
desire and affections, incontinent they show the poison that lies hid in
their thoughts, in outraging, iniurying, and cursing the^ which either do or
say any thing that likes them not. And when they use themselves so, they
think they are excellent, and have their hearts in good estate: but the holy
Ghost does declare unto them, that they are faint hearted, when he calls them
fools, saying by Solomon,

A fool pours out all his mind. Now when the fool despises and rejects
all counsel, all admonitions, corrections and threatninges, it follows
rightly that he not his heart armed with good thoughts, but filled with all
malice and wickedness. forasmuch as from the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaks, it follows also that from a wicked treasure of his heart the fool
brings out wicked things, by the which he opens al his thought and shows
that it is nothing worth. If then we will not be fools, nor counted such, let
us be careful to arm our hearts with wholesome doctrine, willing to receive
admonitions, corrections, exhortations, and threatenings, that are made unto us
in the name of God and by his word, that we should learn to walk in
humblenes of heart, and in no wise to brag, and not sodeinly to do injury,
outrage, and to curse our neighbors, that make no great count of us but
despising us, labor to provoke us unto wrath and anger, and to contend with
them. Thus doing we shall be wise as follows,

But a wise man keeps it till afterward. That is to say: Albeeit that the
wise, after his wisdom, being sold under sin, is provoked to show forth
his wrath and his choler, yet nevertheless, by the wisdom wherewith he is
indewed, he restrains it, and powers not forth his thought, but keeps it
back til afterward, that is to say, till he see that it is needful to
declare it, or til afterward, signifies, that he commits the matter unto
God, who can at the last well show what he thinks, of the foolish, and to be
revenged of them.

12 Of a Prince that hearkeneth unto lies, al his servants are wicked.
Forasmuch as the Princes of the world have great burdens, and that also in
great number, the which they cannot well execute by themselves, as Iethro does
declare to Moses, for this cause they have need to have officers and Ministers
under them, that they may bear a part of the charge and burden: as says
Iethro. Exodus 18. 18. 21. 22


Now the right and true Princes, do desire to have good ministers and good
officers, and are careful to admonish them to do justice and judgment: as did
king Iosaphat. They that are like unto 2. Chro. 19. 6. 7.
him, do not desire to have about them a great number of Ministers to serve
them with a fair show, to be magnified and exalted above their subjects by
pride and arrogancy. They desire not to be accompanied in their houses with
scoffers and iesters, talecarriers, flatterers and slaunderers: but they
follow what David protests to do. I will know the perfect way, and will
walk in my Psalm. 101. 3.
house with a perfect heart. Contrarily, wicked and unfaithful Princes do
gladly hearken unto flattering tales, false reports, and backitinges: and
therefore they love not to have either in their towns or houses upright and
true men: but do reject, yea persecute the^. For this cause they can have none
other but wicked ministers and servants: as Solomon does very plainly
pronounce, saying.

Of a Prince that hearkeneth unto lies, etc. We may here allege, Pharao,
Saul, Acab, and other. We may say also that there is a threatening enclosed
within this sentence: to wit, That God for to punish the Princes that delight
to hear lying tales, will not suffer that they shall be served with good and
virtuous men: but as they are wicked, even so does God give them for their
companions wicked men, which will be very ready to show them some wicked act
of unfaithfulness: as they also are unfaithful unto God, when in steed that
they should continually meditate in the law of God, and have al their delight
therein, for to learn to follow the way of truth, they give themselves unto
lies. Therefore, let the princes which desire to be well served, become the true
and good servants of God, who loves truth, the which they ought to follow,
for to serve him rightly, and minister justice truly: otherwise they serve the
Devil, and iniquity reigns in them, by the which the feeble, poor, and
innocent are oppressed.

13 The poor and the usurer meet together, and the Lord lighteneth both their
eyes.
Solomon has said heretofore, The rich and the poor meet together, the
Lord is the maker of them al: and now he Pro. 22. 2.
says the same, saving that in steed of the rich, he sets the usurer. But
there is no great differnce therein: for oftentimes we see the rich men of
the world to be given unto usury, spoiling, to deceit and fraud, for to
attain unto greater riches. We see almost daily that the usurers become
rich, or at the least labor to be rich. The poor then that is destitute of
worldly riches, and the usurer, whose mind and affection is altogether set to
make profit of, and to multiply his gold and silver, and other goods, to the
hinderance of his neighbors, and chiefly of the needy and poor: though they
be of a clean contrary state, yet do they meet together: that is to say,
that they are mingled together, and occupy one with another. The poor man
has need that the usurer should help him with his abundance: and the usurer
which is full and rich, cannot himself do all his business alone: wherefore
he must needs set the poor man on work. Behold how the poor and the
usurer meet together. Notwithstanding it often happens that the poor man
being pinched and grieved with his needinesse and poverty, and distrusting to
be able to obtain that which is necessary, enuieth the prosperity of the
usurer: and the usurer that has a covetous heart, and abounds in riches,
does contemn the poor, either by pride, or for fear he should want
himself.

Now they both proceed thus, through want that they know not that God made
them, and that as he has made them, so will he also maintain them in this
life, and gives them wit and understanding for to know how to govern
themselves in this world: as Solomon has well noted, saying, that the Lord is
maker both of Pro. 22* 2
the poor and rich: and now, when he says,

The Lord lighteneth the eyes of them both. For, to lighten the eyes, is to
quicken and to comfort: as it is so taken in diverse places of the scripture.
Behold how God lighteneth the eyes both of the poor man and of the usurer,
quickening and giving the^ knowledge: 1. Sam. 14. 27. 29. Esdr. 9. 8. Psa. 13.
4.
but there are few poor, and usurers that do know the same, as we may
judge, for that that there are but a few poor men contented with their estate,
and very few also of usurers which do loathe and abhor their estate, to
forsake it, and to abstain from al extortions and exactions, from al fraud,
deceit and spoiling, If it were otherwise, they would every where obey the
admonition of Saint James, that he which is of a low and poor estate, would
rejoice ween he is exalted, contrarily, the rich would Iam. 1. 9. 10. 11.
rejoice in his low degree and when he is abaced, etc. As touching the rest,
let us note that when God lighteneth as well the eyes of the usurer as of the
poor, and that he makes the Sun to rise both upon the good and bad, we
ought not to judge of med according Math. 5. 35.
to the prosperity they enjoy, nor after the adversity they suffer. For also
most commonly the righteous are in misery and calamities, they are afflicted,
tormented, and persecuted: and the wicked prosper and floorishe, they are
honored, and praised, as has been already sometimes handeled. Some
understand by lightening of the eyes, governing and moderating the hearts and
minds, so that God makes the poor man to be contented with his state, and
the usurer not so sore to afflict the poor man as he would: the which
contains truth. Othersome understand that God has mercy on whom he will,
and shows mercy to the poor man, to the rich, to the sinner and usurer. And
this sense contains truth also: but the first is the most fittest: as may be
seen by the scriptures alleged.

14 The king that judges the poor in truth, his throne shall be established
for ever.
The kings and superiors of the earth are often ambitious, proud, arrogant,
and high minded: They love to be exalted, to be had in reverence to be feared
and doubted. And to the end that none should dare to do any thing against
the^, they will brag and magnify themselves, and as the same shall seem to
them to be necessary, they will arm and fortify themselves against those whom
they take to be their enemies. And least their own subjects should rebel
against them, and revolt from them, they will handle them most severely and
sharply, most ungently and cruelly. In doing the same, they think to make
their name perpetual, and it seems to them that their kingdom shall never
depart from their house, so long as the world shall last. And for to arm
themselves strongly in their fantasy, they will hold themselves in with the
great and most mighty, will honor them and show them favor, in disdaining
and treading the poor under feet, which have neither power nor mainteinance,
and will overthrow their right to pleasure therewith the stronger. Now because
that in so doing they justify the wicked, and make wicked decrees, they are
cursed, and so they cannot prosper, nor be permanent and established for ever,
as they persuade themselves, but shall Esaias. 5. 23. and 10. 1. 2.
be suddenly destroyed, according as they are threatened. And also we have the
examples thereof in the floode of Noe, in the subversion of Sodom, in the
destruction of Pharao and his army, and in the discomfiture of the kings and
their people, of the land of Canaan: in Saul, Achab, and Baltasar. But where
the kings without preferring the poor in their causes will take pity of them,
yielding the^ the right that belongs unto the^, then shall they cause their
throne long to endure, as Solomon does pronounce saying.

The king that judges. etc. But against this sentence we may allege that if
ever there were governors, judges, and kings, which have judged the poor in
truth, Moses, Joshua, Sampson, Gedeon, David, Josias, Ezekias, and Iosaphat,
have done it, and yet they have not stablished their throne eternally. For, as
we may see, they have not long continewed, and even between the reign of the
one and the other there have been horrible dissipations, and after them al, and
yet still the people over whom they reigned, is in great desolation.

Now hereunto we may answer that the establishme^t for ever ought not to be
referred to that which is seen to the eye, but unto the faith and contentation
that God has given unto those kings, and to that, that he bears their
justice in perpetual memory, the which shall never be abolished. We may also say
that the good kings do not reign in their own name, but do confess
themselves to be the lieftenants of Jesus Christ, and to be ministers of his
kingdom, the which shall endure for ever, and that at the last they shall enjoy
this eternity.

15 The rod and correction give wisdom: but a child set at liberty, makes
his mother ashamed.
Forasmuch as wisdom is of greatest excellency, and of greatest profit, not
only unto old men, but also unto young people, as we have seen by the
admonitions and declarations that Solomon has made us heretofore oftentimes,
therefore the fathers and mothers that desire to have their children to profit
well, must be diligent to make them learn wisdom not worldly and carnal
(which is nothing Pro. 13. 24. and 22. 15. and 23. 13. 14.
else but vanity and foolishnes before GOD) but the heavenly wisdom, that
expels foolishnes which is bound unto the neck of of the child.

But forasmuch as children will not give themselves thereto, except they be
constrained by corrections and rods, therefore Solomon in diverse places
admonishes fathers and mothers for to beat their children with rods: now he
affirms that the rod and correction give wisdom. And thus if we desire
that our children should be wise, we must be diligent to correct and chasten
them. Not that by our rods and corrections we can atchiue to give them
wisdom, for it is a work of the holy Ghost. True it is, that the
corrections and rods are instruments ordained of God, and do profit so much
as it pleases him: and therefore, when we correct and chastise our children to
make them wise, we must diligently commend our work unto God: For also if
the rods and corrections of themselves give wisdom, then none of those
children that are corrected Prou. 10. 1. and 15. 20. and 23, 15. 16
and chastened should remain obstinate. And forasmuch as they give wisdom
unto children, even so they bring joy unto the fathers and mothers. Therefore
let the fathers and mothers for the profit and honor of their children, and
for their joy and consolation, peace and rest, keep and hold their children
short, correcting and chastening them: for if they give them the bridle, they
shall proceed in Pro. 10. 1. and 15. 20. and 17 21. 25.
folly, whereof they shall be grieved and ashamed: as now Solomon says.

But a child set at liberty, etc. And since that Solomon who was so wise,
stands so long in declaring that we must correct and chasten children,
therefore let us know that it is a very necessary thing: and therefore ought
not to be despised nor neglected.

16 When the wicked are increased, transgression increases: but the righteous
shall see their fall.
Wickedness has ever reigned, as we may see it in Cain and Lameth, but when
the world was grown and multiplied, by the Gene. 4.
disordinate and unbridled lusts of the sons of God toward the daughters
of men, the wicked did multiply. At this time were the Gene. 6. 41.
Giants dwelling on earth: afterward the sons of God agreed with the sons
of men, etc. Then as the wicked and cruel multiplied, Genesis 6. 5. 11. 12. 13.
even so did wickedness increase and multiply. The like was found true by
experience in the Canaanites, and also in the people of Israel, that where the
wicked did grow amongst them, even there wickedness also did increase. And in
these years past we have had but too much experience thereof.

Now it is common that when the wicked see themselves a great number, they
wax bold to do infinite evils, and chiefly against the poor and feeble,
against the righteous and innocent, against the good and upright, for to
destroy them if it were possible: and do boldly promise too themselves that
whatsoever they do Psa. 10. 6. Esaias. 28. 15. Psa. 10. 2. Psa. 14. 6. and 22.
8. Gene. 6. 8. 13 and 7. and 18. and 19.
they shall feel no hurt thereof. And this is because they delight in their
worldly prosperity, even to care nothing for God. And to discourage the
righteous, whom they persecute and would make to despair, they scorn them,
that being so feeble, they dare hope and trust that God will deliver them. But
as Noe found favor before GOD, who revealed unto him the end of al flesh,
and showed unto him the destruction of the world: and as God foretold
Abraham: and as the angels foretold Lo^ of the destruction and overthrow of
Sodom, and the same also: and as God has made many other righteous to see the
destruction of the wicked, which were mighty and many in number: as to the
children of Israel, David, and other good kings and judges: even so will he
also show us the same favor, if we walk truly in righteousness and
uprightness: as Solomon does promise us, saying,

When the wicked, etc. And this agrees with that which is written in diverse
places. Thus we see that the wicked, how mighty Job. 22. 15. Psalm. 37. 34. and
52. 7. and 58. 11. Esaias. 66. 24.
and great a number soever they be, can they not atchieue to the end of their
enterprises: but must fall and perish. And contrarily, the just that are weak,
and which daily do perish even before our eyes, are preserved, and behold
the vengeance that God takes of their persecutours. And thus we are taught
not to weigh, nor to judge things, as we see them at the first sight, but we
must look to the threatenings that God makes against the ungodly, and to the
promises that he makes unto the righteous, for they are certain, and other
things that we see with our eyes, do pass and vanishe away to nothing.

17 Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest, and will give pleasure to
thy soul.
There is neither old nor young, but desires rest and peace, and also
therewith to have wherewith he may be delighted and made to rejoice. And as it
is a thing to be desired, even so also it is proper unto the nature of man: and
chiefly unto the aged, which are not of such power and might that they can
labor, as can they that are in their floorishing age. But commonly we know
not the means whereby we may come to obtain these desires, and when we
know them, yet will we not hold them. For albeit that Solomon has sometimes
exhorted the fathers and mothers to correct and to chasten their children with
rods, and that he has promised them, in so doing that they shall drive out
and expel foolishnes from the hearts of their children, and shall deliver their
souls from hell, yet for the most part the fathers and mothers do not
understand that they ought to chasten their children, and do much fear to
anger them, and for to rejoice and to give them recreation, they let them run
where they list. Whereupon it comes, that in steed of resting upon their
children, and to have pleasure in them, and to delight in their good
government, in their modesty and obedience their children do torment them,
and vex them by their dissolutions, lewdness and rebellion. And therefore,
again Solomon does admonish them, correct thy son, etc. And he promises
them that in so doing they shall have rest and pleasure. For in correcting their
children, foolishness which was bound unto their hearts is put away, and
thereby wisdom is given them: whereupon follows rest and pleasures. For a
wise son rejoices his father: Pro. 10. 1. and 15. 20.
Herein Solomon teaches the fathers, what duty they owe unto their
children: and to the children he teaches what they owe unto their fathers and
mothers, not only that which is necessary, but also what is pleasant, yea even
before God. For children must not be given to vanity and foolishness, to
uncleanness and dishonestie, for to give recreation unto their fathers and
mothers: but they ought to follow whatsoever God commands them, and to have
their fathers and mothers in abomination and hatred, which should demand
the contrary, or that should hinder them to follow what God commands.

18 Where there is no vision, the people decay: but he that keeps the law,
is blessed.
It is written, before time in Israel when a man went to seek an answer of
God, thus he spoke, Come and let us go to the Seer: for he that is called
now a Prophet, was in old time called a Seer. And 1. Sam. 9. 9
since that a Seer is a Prophet, we will take the vision for a Prophecy: as the
same is taken in Esaias. This kind of vision has ever been necessary in the
world for the preservation of men, and has greatly profited the people of
Israel, when they had Seers that governed the^, the want of the^ brings great
hurt: for having the Prophets, Esaias. 1. 1.
they were instructed in the will of God, which showed the^ the way to salvation
and life: but being destitute of Seers, they know not what they should do.
They gave themselves unto superstitions and idolatries, unto craftiness and
rauine, to doing wrong, extortions, and violences, and other wickednesses: and
so provoked GOD unto wrath against them: and for this cause he raised up
enemies to spoil and destroy them: as we may see in the book of the Judges,
and in other holy histories. Likewise all other nations being destitute of
Seers, or rejecting the word of God, have suffered horrible wasting. And still
now we see that the nations which have not the pure preaching of the Gospel,
are vexed and tormented with wars, by the which a great number of people
does perish.

Now according to these experiments: Solomon says, Where there is novision,
the people decay. Except then that we receive the word with all obedience, by
the which word, God does reveal himself unto us, and does declare his will
unto us, we are cursed: for by such contempt we go to perdition: though for a
time it seem that we do prosper and florishe. Let us therefore receive the
vision, that is to say, the wholesome doctrine, whereby we are instructed what
the will of God is: and in this sort, we shall not decay, but shall be happy and
blessed, as Solomon does pronounce, saying,

But he that keeps the law, etc. That we may well and truly keep this
law or doctrine, we must hate and abhor our sins, and with all our hearts
follow and do the good deed that God commands us, and to distrust
ourselves, and to call unto him for our help: and also we must be assured
that he will not fail nor deceive us, though we accomplish not perfectly
that which he commands us: but of his only grace and goodness he gives us
faith and repentance, and he does accept and allow them for the fulfilling of
his law, and does pardon and forgive us our imperfections, so that they do
truly displease us. And thus though it is said, that he that keeps the law
is blessed, yet let us not think that we can fulfill it: but forsaking our
merits, let us weep and lament for our maliciousness, and imperfections,
desiring of God that he would please to guide us in his ways. So doing, we
shall not walk in over weening and arrogancy, for boldly to give ourselves
unto al kind of sins: we shall not abide in ignorance, for to dout of the
doctrine, and religion that we should hold: neither shall we be destitute of
consolation, for to fall into despair: nor we shall not be left in the power of
the Devil, for to be troubled in our consciences by his cruelty and tyranny,
and to fall under his temptations, Let 2. Pet. 1. 9. Amos. 8. 11.
us therefore be attentive, and give diligent heed unto the word of the
Prophets, and such famine as the Jews are threatened withal, shall not fall
upon us.

19 A slave will not be chastized with words: though he understand, yet he will
not answer.
It is a common thing in the world, that men labor to do contrary to that,
that is commanded them, and is forbidden them, though they well understand it
is reason to obey. And therein we show ourselves of a slauishe condition,
though that in despising the forbiddings, and resisting the commandementes, we
think to be exempted from bondage, and to live at liberty and in freedom.
For being rebellious against that which is, and that we know to be reasonable,
we serve and obey our unbridled lusts and wicked desires. Contrarily, we are
in true liberty, when with a free heart and mind, without constraint we
submit ourselves unto that which is reasonable. Whereupon it rightly follows,
that we are not at liberty of ourselves. For neither we will, nor can be
governed, but after the desire of our flesh, the which is enimitie against
God. And thus, this is verified in us, that a slave will not be chastized, etc.
It were in vain to preach unto us, to admonish us, to reprove us, and to
Romans 1. 7.
threaten us, except that God did set us at liberty, and make us free by his
Spirit, we serve our lusts, by the which with all our power, we rebel against
God, and thinking to set ourselves at liberty, we become more the slaves of
sin. Wherefore, we must humble ourselves, and confess with Saint Paul, that
we are bondeslaues, sold under sin, and that there is a law in our members,
fighting against the law of our mind. And therefore we ought to weep with
him, saying, O wretched men that we are! who shall deliver us from John. 8. Romans
7. 14. 24.
the body of this death? And we must pray with David, O create in me a clean
heart, and rene we a right spirit within me, etc. And in the mean while to
give our hearts unto the word of truth, and therein to persevere: and in this
sort we shall not be servants that Psalm. 51. 12. 13. 14.
will not answer, but framing our lives unto the word of truth, we shall be
free by the grace of the Son of God. Behold, how we must learn to know
and to change our servile state, when Solomon reprooueth servants, for that,
that being admonished of their duty, albeit that they rightly know, that it
is reason they John. 8. 31.
should obey, and not be deaffe, yet esteem nothing thereof. For if servants
that are bought for money, are to be reprehended when they yield not obedience
to them that have bought them, or possess them by succession: and that for the
doing of their duty, they ought to be subject in all things unto their
masters, as Saint Paul Ephe. 6. 5. Col. 3. 22. 2. Tim. 6. 1. Tit. 2. 9. 1.
Pet. 2. 18. 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 29. 30. and 7. 23. Luke. 12. 47.
does admonish them: by a stronger reason then, we are rightly to be
condemned, if we be not obedient unto our God, who has redeemed us with a most
precious ransom. For this cause Saint Paul does admonish us, that we should
confess such a benefit. Let us take heed to make as though we heard not such
admonitions, the which are so clear and plain, that we can not excuse us not
to have heard them. Otherwise, after that God by words shall have opened unto
us his will, he will punish us for our disobedience. And albeit that Solomon
speaks here, of those that were of servile condition, because they were
gotten and bought with money, or taken in war: notwithstanding, we may
stretch this sentence unto hirelings, who during the time that they gain the
money of an other, are slaves: but the greatest number of them, for all the
things that are showed them, and admonitions that are given them, yet do they
not pass to do their duty. Some of them desire nothing but to pass away the
time in idleness: other somelabour to deceive and to steal: and so, albeit
that they well understand and hear, yet will they not answer. They know well
enough, that whatsoever is demanded of them, is reasonable: as they well show,
when before their masters, they will appear good servants, and in their
absence, do the worst they they can, But if they be not beaten of their
masters, as were the poor slaves, yet shall they not escape the whippe of GOD,
as daily is seen.

20 See thou a man hasty in his matters? there is more hope of a fool, then
of him.
As we have seen heretofore in diverse places, that fools are obstinate and
past correction, and for this cause, they are rebuked and despised, threatened
and condemned, as people in whom there is looked no amendment, and of whom we
utterly despair. And therefore, when Solomon says, That there is more hope of
a fool then of him, that is hasty in his matters, or in his words, let us
not understand that we must hope for any thing of a fool: but that the hasty
man in his matters is not only a fool, but worse tha^ a fool: and if it be
a hard matter to bring a fool to goodness, it is a thing much more hard to
be done with him that is hasty in his matters. And thus, albeit that Solomon
sets the hasty man against the fool: yet let us not think that Solomon
goes about to blame the diligence that a man gives to follow his vocation:
whom he has praised and commended before, by rebuking of the slothful. For
also there is great difference between the diligent and hasty man: the
diligent does carefully look to what he has to do, and labors not to
loose the time, but to spend the same in works that may profit him, and
bring no damage unto his neighbors: he is not envious toward his
neighbors, for to hinder them from their profit, but will rather help them,
and be glad of their prosperity. A hasty man is without care: he is
fervently minded, he is earnest about his matters, without considering what
shall be the end: he cares not though he troubles his neighbors: he
proceeds ignorantly, and suffers himself to be carried with a loose bridle,
after his unbridled lusts: he casts God at his back, he makes no count
of his word, and rejects his providence. This same, is gathered partly in
this present sentence, wherein Solomon more dispaireth of the hasty man, then
of the fool, and partly in the nineteeneth Chapter, and 2. verse: and partly,
in the one and twentieth Chapter, and fifth verse. And because the hasty man
is such, he shall be cursed of God, and shall feel his vengeance, as has been
handled. If we shall say hasty in his words the sense shall be fit enough: for
the tongue is a dangerous and an unruly evil. To the end then, that we fall
not into the number of Pro. 18. 20. Iam. 3. 3. and 1. 13.
such hastiemen, let us obey the admonition of Saint James, Let every man be
ready and hasty to hear, and slow to speak. Thus doing, we shall not be
hasty in hearing, and slow of speaking. So doing, we shall not be given unto
idle talk, vain babbling, to blaspheming, to unjust rebukes, to cursing, to
lying, false witness bearing, to backbiting, to flattery and false tales, nor
to dishonest talk: Ephe. 4. 29. and 5. 3. 19. Collo. 4. 6.
but we shall weigh our words, following the holy admonitions of Saint Paul.

21 He that delicately brings up his servant from his youth, at length he
will be even as his son.
There is a common proverb, that says, Save the thief from the galowes, and
he shall kill thee: or, Fat the villain, and he shall prick thee. And this is
according to experience. For if a man do graciously entreat a villain, he
is ready to be unthankful, and in place to acknowledge the humanity and the
gentleness that is used and showed toward him, he will use sharpness, and do
extreme wrong, without cause, rising up against him, to whom he stands
bound, and will labor to subdue him, and persuade men to believe that he to
whom he is detter, does owe unto him: and in steed that he should be his
servant, he would reign over him, yea destroy him. Now according to this
experience, Solomon says,

He that delicately brings up his servant, etc. He names a servant, by whom
he means al persons that are bound to give honor, service, subjection and
obedience to other. And thus, he comprehends al those that are under the
power of Kings and Magistrates, of fathers and mothers, of Lords and Masters.
And albeit that such inferiors are not of a servile or slavish condition, as
were the slaves bought for money, or taken in war, notwithstanding, they are
bound to acknowledge those with all humbleness, under whose tuition they are,
to be their superiors: and to understand that they ought in no wise to rise
up against the^, but the more ge^tly they are handled, so much the more to
humble themselves: as Saint Paul does closely teach them. But forasmuch as we
see most commonly to happen, that the servants and other of vile and low 1.
Tit. 6. 1.
condition before the world, do wax proud when they are gently entreated
and suffered to have their pleasure, Solomon by this sentence warns al those
that are in authority, that they should not slack the bridle unto those that
are under their subjection and yoke, for to let them live after the desires of
their flesh, nor to take their pleasures after the lust thereof: but should
use gravity and moderate severity, and should accustom them to bestow the
time about good works, after as they are called, and to teach them to live
soberly and temperately, yea rather austerely, then to suffer them to run
where they list, Otherwise the superiors are in danger to feel their pride
and arrogancy: as Solomon does signify, when he says, that at the length
the servant will be as the son: yea even as the son that feels and
knows his heart, and because he knows himself to be his fathers heir,
and that he thinks the goods do appertain and belong unto him, therefore
he will do after his pleasure, as a Lord and Master, and will murmr against
his father, unless he suffer him to have the ruling of the goods of the house
at his pleasure: and chiefly when the fathers are waxen old, the children,
which have bin most delicately brought up, do curse them, calling them old
doaters, and giving them other injurious words, except they be permitted to do
with the goods as they will. Now forasmuch as it is so, that by our corrupted
nature we are al of a servile condition (for we serve our wicked lusts, and
vnbriled affections, and the law of sin, the which holds us captives)
therefore we have need that our God (who is our Lord, that has dearly bought
us with the blood of his only son) shoul hold us under his yoke and
discipline, and not to nourishe us up with the ease of our flesh, making us to
enjoy his riches in delicateness and pleasure, in abundance and excess: but
should tame and chasten us, that we rebel not against him, nor disobey him: as
it is our manner and custom, to fall away when we enjoy our pleasures: even as
we may see it in the holy histories, and as experience teaches through all the world. It is then very needful for us to crave of our God with Jeremy, let
him correct us, not in his wrath but in judgment, lest Ier. 10. 23. 24. and
31. 18.
he bring us to nothing. Convert me O Lord, and I shall be converted, etc.
Thus doing, we shall truly be the sons of the great Lord of heaven and
earth, and fellow heirs of al things with Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom
our good heavenly Father of grace and mercy has adopted us for his children,
before the foundation of the world.

22 An angry man stirs up strife: and a furious man abounds in
transgression.
As it is said, Behold, how good and joyful a thing it is, for brethren to
dwell together in unity: even so there is no man (if he have Psa. 131. 1.
any sound judgment) but desires to live in peace and concord with his
neighbors: as also Saint Paul does admonish us thereof. But albeit that this
is the judgment, yet many can not, or will Romans 12. 18 Mat. 5. Ephe. 4 and 5.
Phil. 2. Collo. 3.
not follow the fit and right means to obtain this peace, the which Saint
Paul does teach us in diverse places, following the doctrine of Jesus Christ.
But in steed of being so humble, modest, patient, soft and gentle, we will
strive with our neighbors in rising up against them in wrath and anger: and
yet we will persuade men that we dare not once murmr, and whinch against the^:
and therefore they will be out of troubles, and far from vexations.
Notwithstanding, experience shows the clean contrary: for such people do
often meet with shrewde heads, that know how to answer and resist them,
and give them a sharp repulse: whereupon rises strife. According to this
experience, Solomon has said, An angry man stirs up strife or debate: and
now he says again, An angry Pro. 15. 18
man stirs up strife, etc. And forasmuch as we desire, or that we should
desire peace, let us understand, that forasmuch as Solomon is so careful to
advertise us of this experience, he does thereby admonish us to put away
wrath and anger, and also to fly the company of angriemen, which are sodeinely
angered. Thus doing, we shall live peaceably with our neighbors, and also have
peace with our God: for he loves the peacemakers, calling them the children
of God. And also having peace, and seeking Mat. 5. 9.
to continue the same with our neighbors, we will abstain from many injuries,
outrages, cruelties, and oppressions, whereunto they are readily given, which
rise up in anger and wrath against their neighbors: as Solomon does
pronounce, saying,

A furious man abounds in transgression. Whereupon follows, that as he
makes war against his neighbors, and oppresses them: even so will God pay
them again, and knows how to be revenged on them in his wrath and anger, the
which he shall feel eternally for ever. Therefore if we will have God merciful
unto us, let us be soft and gentle unto our neighbors, following the
admonition: Cease from anger, and leave of wrath: fret not they self Psa. 37.
8. 1.
also to do evil.

23 The pride of a man shall bring him low: but the humble in spirit shall
enjoy glory.
A man rises in pride diverse ways. First of al, when he is not contented
with the state wherein God has placed him, being high Gene. 3. and 11.
or low, but labors to rise up higher: as our father Adam, as they which
builded Babel, as Absalom did in his fathers life time. Secondly, 2. Sam. 15.
when a man reioiceth and braggeth of his power: as did Pharao King of Egypt,
and other infidel kings, which vexed and oppressed the people of God. Thirdly,
when we are pleased, and rejoice in our riches, and contemn and despise the
poor: as did Nabal the husband 1. Sam. 25. Luke. 16.
of Abigail, and the rich glutton. Fourthly, when we esteem ourselves for the
authority and credit we have with them, which are of power and estimation,
as did Aman. Fifthly, when we persuade Hester. 3.
ourselves to be wise and prudent by our travail and policy, and other of
such kind. Al those that be proud in any of these sorts continue not long in
high estate, but their pride does bring them down: as have all the former
aledged persons experimented, and all those that shall be like unto them, shall
fall also, yea very suddenly: as amongst other, the poor Papists, which boast
of their merits, by the which they promise themselves to fly unto heaven: but
forasmuch as in this sort they renounce God for their savior, and become
saviors to themselves, they shall be thrown down to hell. Wherefore, let us
take heed we follow neither them, nor those that have been named before, least
we go to destruction with them, and with the Devil, who is the Prince of the
proud: but let us learn to acknowledge our God and father, and humble
ourselves under him, confessing with our hearts, that we have nothing but of
his only goodness and liberality, and be contented with the state wherein it
has pleased him to set us: and our good God of his grace and mercy will when
the time is come, glorify and magnify us. Solomon has pronounced these
things, and not contented herewith, he pronounces yet again the like, saying,

The pride of a man, etc. And this is because it is very hard Pro. 16. 18.
19. and 18. 12
to beat into the mind of the proud, that he ought to humble and cast
himself down: and also that the poor faithful which are contemned in the
world, have great need of comfort: for to possess Luke. 14. 11 and. 18. 14.
the which, let us believe this present sentence, the which agrees with that
which Jesus Christ our Lord says,

24 He that is partner with a thief, hates his own soul: he hears
cursing and declares it not.
Albeit that we come all from one father and one mother, and that we be al
of one flesh and blood, and that for this cause we should have such
fellowship in goods, as we should not suffer our neighbors to want: never
thelesse we cease not to be partakers of the riches of this world, and too
appropriate and hold to ourselves that which comes to us: so that we judge
them to be thieves that take any thing of that which we possess, against our
wills, and do esteem them as abominable, yea naturally because they bring
us hurt. But that which ought to make them more detestable unto us, is that
they are disobedient unto God, who forbids to steal. For the honor of God
ought to be more precious unto us then all the gains of the world. Now albeit
that we count the thieves for abominable, yet as there are thieves that
persuade themselves, or labor to put into their fantasy, that it is not ill
done to take goods where a man can find them: even so there are some which
judge that it is wickedly done to rob, and also if they can, will cause them
to be taken, and yet will be glad to have part with the thieves: as it is
reproched unto them that are such. When the thieves and their partakers do
thus behave themselves, they well Psalm. 50. 18 Esai. 1. 23. Romans 2. 21.
think to make their profit, and to maintain themselves richly in this life:
and they think also that they have very great care for their souls, because
they labor to have abundance of wealth to sustain them. Because the more they
love themselves, the more they labor to gather riches: and they think that in
this sort they do well make their profit: but to make a temporal gain that is
not certain (for they may be robbed themselves, as they have robbed other:
neither can they long possess them: for they themselves are not of long
continuance, and yet during their life, that which they have stolen does
vanishe away, either by excessive expenses, or after some other sort that they
look not for) they destroy their souls for ever, and get shame so long as
they live, the which they can not shake off, nor purge them thereof. Solomon
signifies this same, saying, He that is partener with a thief, etc. The
destruction of their souls, is noted by the hating of the soul. For no man
preserves that willingly which he hates, but strives to loose and to
destroy it: albeit nevertheless, that the theeuse persuade themselves that
their intent is not such, when they steal, and gather the booti^ together,
and use the same at their pleasure: but indeed and truly, they destroy their
souls: for thieves and robbers shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The
shame is marked, when it is 1. Cor. 6. 10
said, He hears cursing When the thieves and their partakers or accessaries
are taken, they are compelled to hear cried, out upon the thieves, out upon
the wicked: and if they hear it not with their corporal ears, they know well
enough, that they are condemned and evil spoken off. Now that they can not
repulse the shame, nor purge themselves of it, Solomon does show it, when he
says, And declares it not. Some expound this same as if he would say,
that they which are parteners with thieves, dare not complain of the rebukes
that is laid to their charge: and indeed, if the thief thinks that any good
and sufficient proof may be brought against him, he will take good heed from
lamenting of his case: but if he think to be maintained, or that he knows
the probation is not plain enough, not only he will complain, but also will
ask amends for slaundering and taking away of his good name, and will do the
worst he can against those which blame him. And albeit that in this sort, he
does signify some what the cursing that he has heard, yet he does not
declare it for to repulse, and to clear himself thereof. For though he
labors to cover his shame, yet it can not be always hid, but at the last,
it will come to light, so that he shall not be able to deny but that he is
wicked: as Saint Paul says, The sins of some men are manifest of
themselves, coming before to judgment: 1. Tim. 5. 24.
and other some come after. We may also say, that by not declaring the cursing
that he hears, Solomon means, that the thieves and their parteners are
deaffe, and drink up the reproaches and injuries sweetly, that are made them,
and take al in good part: provided that they stop them not to make their
hand and get what they can. They are like unto great mastiue curres, which
whilst they are gnawing of the bones, care nothing at al for the little whelps
that bark after them, and thinks scorn once to remove to bite them: but
because that the word which has been expounded, cursing, signifies also
swearing, some understand that Solomon would say, That though an oath be
given unto the thieves partener, yet will he not declare and reveal the truth,
but will forswear himself. Even so it is a thing that is but too common; that
men had rather blaspheme God, then to discover and open the sin of their
neighbor, when it is required. But it might be said, that Solomon is rather
tied here unto the partener of the thief, and his accessarie, that takes
part of the booty, then to the thief that has stolen the goods from an
other. We answer heereunto, that there is good cause. For if the thief be
guilty, then he that hides and partaketh with the booty, is much more
guilty: for not only he is a thief, but also so much as in him lies, he
justifies the thief, when he consents unto his spoylings and robberies.
And these are of the number of those whereof Saint Paul speaks: who though
they knew the righteousness of Romans 1. 32.
God (that is to say, that they which do such things are worthy of death)
yet they will not only do them, but also allow other that do the same. For
if the accessaries and those which are parteners with thieves, knew not that
the thieves were guilty, they would in no wise conceal nor hide them, neither
would they also hide themselves.

25 The fear of man brings a snare: but he that trusts in the Lord, shall be
exalted.
The snares, in the scriptures, do signify trouble, vexation, sorrow,
affliction, destruction, and overthrow. And this, by a similitude borrowed of
beasts which are taken in the snares, in the toil, or in pursenets, which for
to deliver themselves, do take great pains: but they can not escape, but must
needs be taken, and perish. Now as fearful beasts, seeing or smelling the
hunters and folowers, do fly before them for fear of them: and it comes to
pass most often, that in flying and thinking to save themselves, they run
and fall even into the toils and snares: even so, men which are easily feared,
do soon fall into evil. For their adversaries seeing their fearfulness and
faintheartednesse, do take thereof greater boldness, and promise themselves
that they shall easily overcome such fearful men. The which the Prophet Number.
19. 9 Deuteronomy. 7. 17 and 20. 1. Esai. 7. 4. and 8. 12. and 10. 24. Joshua. 1. 9.
Ier. 1. 8. 17 Eze. 2. 6. Mat. 10. 26. 28.
Esai, and also Moses and Joshua, and other servants of God have well known.
For this cause they have diligently admonished the people of Israel not to
stand in fear for the power, greatness, and multitude of their enemies.
Likewise when a man fears, or is afraid of any thing, he easily forsakes
the duty of his office, and to do according to their will, whom he fears,
and to turn away from God, yea, to be rebellious against him. And for this
cause the Lord often admonishes his servants not to fear men, nor to
esteem their greatness. Moreover, when we are afraid, we do not so well
remember to run unto God, nor to trust in him: but rather, do regard and look
unto natural and carnal means, and so run unto them, and most what return
void of our expectation and hope: and thus we fall and run unto destruction: and
in this sort the snare is brought and set: as we may understand by the
scripture, My bowels, my bowels, woe is me, the transgressors have offended:
yea, Esai. 24. 16 17. and 42. 22.
the transgressors have grievously offended, fear, and the pit, and the suare
are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. But this people is robbed and
spoiled, and shall be al snared in dungeons, and they shall be hid in prison
houses. The destruction of the^ that through fear have refuge unto creatures,
is very well described in the thirty, and one and thirty of Esai: and
against the Moabites, which trusted in their idolles, Jeremy says, O
inhabitaunt of Moab, fear, the pit and the snare are upon thee, says the
Lord: and Ier. 48. 43.
he that flies away for fear, shall fall into the pit. For whatsoever
affliction or adversity shall then happen unto us, let us not be dismayed, but
with all constancy, following our vocation, let us look for help from above.
For as a poor feeble beast cannot deliver himself out of the snare, when the
same is taken: even so, can we not of ourselves save us from the calamities of
this world, from what part soever they come, but the only power of the Lord
must deliver us from them: as we may see by many examples of the scriptures,
and as it is very plainly expressed in the 124, Psalm. Wherefore, trusting in
his goodness and power, and saying in our hearts, The Lord Psalm. 118. 6
Psalm. 31. 1 and 50. 15
is on our side, I will not fear what man can do unto me, let us call upon him
to help us with David, and he will not fail to grant us our request. For he
promises us, Call upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee.
And as he has promised, so will he also perform the same faithfully: as
diverse Saints have tried it by experience. Now both following of the promise
and also experience, Solomon pronounces, But he that trusts in the Lord,
shall be exalted. He compares trust in the Lord unto a strong and high Tower,
or unto so sleep and so high a rock that no man can ascend up to the same,
so that if a man can come thither, he shall be out of the dangers of his
persecuters. And herein, he does welshewe us, that it is in God, that we
ought to put our trust and confidence, if we will be delivered from fear, and
set out of danger, and be in safety. And it is not in this place only that
the scripture uses this comparison, to teach us, where we ought to put our
trust, but also in diverse other places, it calls God Psalm. 18. 3 and 31. 4.
and 71. 1. Pro. 18. 10.
a strong and well fenced City, a strong Tower, a Rock, an high place, and
such like names. The name of the Lord is a strong Tower, the righteous flies
unto it, and is delivered. And also without comparison the scripture does
openly declare us, that if we put our trust in God, we shall not perish, but
shall be delivered from al dangers. And albeit that in trusting in the Lord we
Psalm. 33. and 34. and 91.
have cause to be assured, and to be far from fear, because we have an
Almighty Savior: yet distrusting ourselves, let us work out our salvation in
fear and trembling, Phil. 2. 12.

26 Many do seek the face of the ruler: but every man's judgment comes
from the Lord.
The Kings, Princes, Rulers and Superiors of the earth, are of a great
Majesty: as we ought to understand, when God places them in his throne, and
that he calls them Gods, and sons of the most highest. And therefore we
must take good heed from making Psalm. 82. 6.
the rest of men his companions: for besides this, that we should sport and jest
with God (the which is in no wise lawful, but ought chiefly to be avoided) we
should be in danger to be consumed. For as a little whelpe thinking to play
with a Lion, would at the last anger him, he should be devoured by him: even
so, a King or a Ruler will not long delight to have a person of a mean and low
state to be his familiar, and as it were his companion. Yea also, though for a
certain time a King has counted a man for his father, and shall so have called
him, at the last he will be grieved, and cause him to be taken: as we have
seen in our time the example thereof. The Kings and great Lords of this
world, are like unto wild beasts, and are Pro. 16. 14. and 19. 12. and 20. 2.
compared unto Lions, and unto such as bring the message of death. But albeit
they are such, and that there is but too much experiences thereof, yet
forasmuch as they counterfaite the magnifical and liberal, in giving great
gifts and presents unto their whores, bawdes, flatterers, and tale bringers,
and where there is no need: for this cause many desiring to go forward and
make their profit, and to wax rich, labor to come near unto them, and to
please them. And as we have seen, many do bow before the face of the
Prince: and every man is friend to him that gives. And according Pro. 19. 6.
hereunto Solomon says now,

Many do seek the face of the Ruler, etc. Thus doing, they think to belitle
Kings, and to be raised up: but forasmuch as the Kings heart is in the hands
of the Lord, and that he turns it as best pleases him, we must not
therefore think to make our state better, yea, though the Kings and Rulers
did bear us the best face and countenance in the world: for the Lord turns
the heart of Pro. 21. 1.
the King to whatsoever pleases him. And according thereunto he says now,
But every man's judgment comes from the Lord. And thus, he can obtain
nothing of the Ruler, whose favor he desires, but what God has given him.
The judgment then in this place, is taken for that, that God has judged and
sent to every man: as it is so taken, Deuteronomy. 18. verse 3. What favor soever
the great me^ of the world do bear us, let us take heed unto the providence of
God, and let us depend wholly upon this same: and so doing, he will judge us,
and send us such and so prosperous state, as he shall know to be expedient
for us.

27 A wicked man is abomination to the just, and he that is upright in his
way, abomination to the wicked.
Albeit that al men are of one flesh, and of one blood, and that more is, al
are created and made like to the image and likeness of GOD, the which we
ought to have in great reverence, and to hold it dear, and for this cause do
we bear honor one unto an other, and do not contemn no man, how vile and
low soever he be before the world: yet there are some which of set malice and
of a shameful obstinacy, do drown themselves in all dissoluteness and
lewdness, are delighted to despite God, by their misdeeds and
transgressions, and to oppress their neighbors by wrong doings and
cruelties, by polling and pilling, by lying, and slaundering, false swearing
and false witness bearing: and chiefly rise up against the weak and feeble,
against the simple and innocent. And in this manner, so much as in them lies,
they corrupt and put out the image of God in them, and also in their neighbors
whom they labor to loose and destroy. And so, they show themselves wicked and
ungodly, and unworthy of that image: and therefore they are abominable before
God: as he has well showed, when he cursed Caine, destroyed the world by the
flood, overthrew Sodom and Gomorrhe, and drowned Pharao, and al his army in
the red sea: and that he rooted out the inhabitants of the land of Canaan,
before the face of his people: and when by the infidels he tormented the
children of Israel, and sent them into captivity amongst the idolaters: and
that now they are still in an horrible confusion. And as we see this same by
examples, even so also may we know it by the testimonies of the scriptures:
and amongst other places by the curses that God pronounced, and by the
threatenings that he makes in diverse places by his Prophets. We have had
diverse sentences also thereof in this book of the Proverbs. And as such
wicked men are abominable before God the Lord: even so are they which give
themselves to walk in the right ways of the Lord, and delight and take
pleasure therein, not well pleased with these wicked men: but as Solomon says,
A wicked man is abomination to the just. And this comes chiefly, because
that the wicked are enemies of God, as is showed us. For so far as they are
our enemies, we must not Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 27. and 28. Psalm. 5. 5. Psalm. 139.
19 Mat. 5. 44.
hate them, but love them. Now albeit that upon good cause the wicked are
abominable unto the just, and that the wicked ought to be converted and to
labor to please both God and the just, which are of a good and upright
conversation, by the which they bend unto edification, for to set the wicked
in the way of salvation, yet the wicked are hardened and become obstinate in
their malice, and do delight therein, so that of vice they make virtue, and of
virtue vice: and in steed that they should love the just that gives them
good example, and to do them honor, and to reverence them, they abhor them:
as Solomon says, adding,

And he that is upright in his way, is abomination unto the wicked. He
speaks here according to experience. For Cain had not slain just Abel, if
he had not hated him and abhorred him. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were ill
entreated of the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, because they hated them.
Lot suffered the like of the inhabitants of Sodom. Moses, David, the
Prophets, Jesus Christ and his Apostles were abhorred of the wicked: and also
the wicked have thought to do good service unto God, by killing the just: as
still at this day, they persuade themselves in persecuting them which profess
the name of Jesus Christ. But for so much as in so doing they justify the
wicked, and condemn the innocent, and call evil good, they are therefore
cursed, Esai. 5. 20. 23.

The xxx. Chapter.
The words of Agur the son of Iaketh.
1 The prophecy which the man spoke unto Ithiel, even to Ithiel, and Vcal.
ACcording to the Hebrews, the fourth part of this book begins at this
place: and after the opinion of Aben Ezra, Agur was a man that lived in the
time of Solomon, which walked in righteousness, expert in knowledge, and
honorable amongst those of his age: and for this cause King Solomon has
enclosed his words of wisdom into his book: and that Ithiel and Vcal were
wise men, that were the companions or Disciples of Agur. But R. Leui the son
of Gerson, says, that it seems, or it is thought how Solomon was named
Agur, because of his words or sentences which he has comprised in this book:
and that Agur, signifies a gatherer together: and that he did name himself
the son of Iaketh. Howsoever it be, the words which are set down hereafter
are called, a Prophecy, or charge, for their excellency, and contain very
grave sentences, and of great weight.

2 Surely, I am more foolish then any man, and have not the understanding of a
man in me.
Whosoever he be that speaks, either Solomon, or an other, he speaks of
himself in great humility, though he was indewed with great gifts and
graces, and has uttered excellent sentences, to the great edification of those
which consider and lay them up as they ought. Diverse saints (though they knew
that God did greatly esteem them) did not yet boaste of their greatness and
excellency for to tread down others under them: but they have shewwed great
humility. Abraham might well know, how greatly Genesis 12. and 13. and 15. and
17. and 18. Genesis 18. 27. and 23. 7 Act. 7. 25 Exo. 4. 10
God esteemed him, by the promises that he had made him: and yet he pronounces
no excellent thing of himself, but names himself powder and dust: and also
does humble him before the Hethites. Moses knew also that God would give
deliverance to the people of Israel by his hand, and yet he confesses, that he
is not sufficient. David knew that God had caused him to be anointed king
over the people of Israel, and yet he submits himself unto Saul, who was
rejected of God. Afrer that the Lord had declared unto Hieremie, that he had
appointed him a Prophet, he humbles himself saying, he was a child. Saint
Paul knew that the Lord had counted him worthy to be his Apostle, and yet
he confesses that he was not worthy to be called an Apostle. And
notwithstanding that these holy men have thus humbled themselves, they have not
ceased to show themselves excellent in following boldly and manfully their
vocation, and doing their office duly. Moreover also though the person that
speaks here, knowing what he was himself, do greatly humble himself,
saying: that he is more foolish then any man. Yet for to explicate what he
means by foolishnes he adds, that he has not the understanding of a man:
and for more ample exposition, says consequently.

3 For I have not learned wisdom, nor attained to the knowledge of the
Saints.
And yet for all this, he has a spirit gorgiously decked with knowledge, both
human and divine, and shows himself very witty and of a settled, and
discreet mind, by the sentences and words that shall follow hereafter. And
therein he teaches us, that our own mouths should not praise us, as Solomon
has Pro. 27. 2.
admonished us. He teaches us also, that what gifts, graces, and virtues
soever we have, we should not extol ourselves above our neighbors, by
contenrion and vaineglory: but that through humbleness of heart we should
esteem an other man more excellent then ourselves: as we are admonished
thereof. Phillip. 2. 3. For albeit that we must esteem the gifts of God that
are in us, and to make them shine by good doctrine and holy conversation, yet
must we think, they are not given us for to boast of them, nor to extol
ourselves above our neighbors, but to labor to set forth the glory of God,
and the salvation of our neighbors. We should not then presume to have of
ourselves any humane wisdom, or knowledge of the saints, that is to say, of
the word of God, and knowledge thereof, the which may be called Knowledge of
the saints for diverse causes.

Frst of al, because that God gives the knowledge of his word unto his elect,
whom he sanctifies and separateth from the filthiness and pollutions, whereunto
the wicked and reprobate are given. And by this word are they sanctified and
made saints: Jesus Christ does well show it, saying, Sanctify them by thy
truth, etc. Secondly, it may be called the knowledge of the saints: that is
to say, John. 17. 17.
of holy things: for there is nothing that makes us to be given unto an holy
life, and pure and clean conversation, but only this word, by the which God
declares unto us his will, which is the rule of al hones. Thirdly, it may be
called, the knowledge of saints, that is to say, of heavenly things, because it
brings us to have our conversation in heaven, by faith and hope, and at the
end to have perfect possession thereof. We shall not need, I say, to presume
of ourselves, in this sort though we be but fools before the world, which
would have us to praise and boast ourselves, for God shall accept and allow us
for wise men. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God, and
therefore he admonishes us saying, Let no man deceive himself: if any man
amongst you seem wise, let him become 1. Cor. 3. 18 19.
a fool in this world, that he may be made wise. It is not enough to say
that we are fools, brutishe and ignorant, but we must confess it, and feel
indeed: for if we have nothing but the bare word, and do not think lowly
of ourselves, there is nothing but feining and hypocrisy, the which is greatly
detestable before God, who demands a sincere and upright heart, and whereunto
the mouth agrees. Let us take heed then to be like those who for to
counterfeite the lowly, and repentant, will with mouth blaspheme, but cannot
suffer to hear their faults reproved, but to be revenged, will say, they are
honest men, and are also good Christians or better then any other: and also will
labor to revenge themselves upon them, that take paiues to make them know
their faults.

4 Who has ascended up to heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind
in his fist? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all
the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his sons name, if thou
can tell?
Agur has said himself to be foolish, and for to expound how he was
such, he has declared that he had neither humane wisdom, nor divine
knowledge.

Now for to show that none is capable of that whereof he confesses himself
to be destitute, he makes many questions, the which are so much as
negatiues. And this is for to show that there is none but God only, that has
wisdom and understanding, that is mighty and politic, that is wonderful and
worthy of great renown and praise.

The first question, (Who has ascended up to heaven, and descended?) ought to
be understood negatiuely, if we vndersla^d it to be spoken of men. For albeit
that some by special privilege have been translated or ravished up into
heaven, as Enoc, Elias, and Paul: yet it is true that no man ever went up into
heaven or descended of himself. For if we take the heavens for this great
heavenly firmament, we know that they are inaccessible and cannot be
reached: as also Moses does give the same something to be understood, Genesis 5.
24, 2. Kin. 2. 11. 2. Cor. 12. 2. Genesis 1. 1 Deuteronomy. 30. 11. 12.
saying: For this commandment that I command thee, this day, is not hid from
thee, neither is it far from thee, nor in heanen, etc. And if we take the
ascending up into heaven, for the pure knowledge of the mysteries and secrets
of God, and for the light of spiritual understanding, which is the true
wisdom and knowledge of the saints: as it is so taken in the 3. Chapter and
the 13. verse, of Saint John: No man ascends up to heaven of his own and
natural understanding, which is brutishe and senselcsse. For the natural does
not comprehend the things that are of the spirit: there is none but the holy
Ghost, who is the spirit of 1. Cor. 2. 14.
Christ, which ascends up to heaven, and descends from thence. It is he
that is the spirit of wisdom and understanding. And by him the son of man
Jesus Christ did ascend up to heaven. No man knows the father, but the son,
who is the Lord. And we Esaias. 11. 2. Mat. 11. 27.
may say that the holy Ghost descends from heaven, when by the word of God
he teaches us al truth, and guides us in the same. The which he did when
Jesus Christ being descended from heaven, took our nature, and in the same
has taught us the will of God his father, and does teach it us daily by the
Apostles and ministers that he has ordained in his Church, which are only
the instruments of his spirit, who reuealeth unto us what we ought to know
of God. And when the spirit does thus give us to know the things which are
of God, it is not to the end that we 1. Cor. 2. 10. 11. 12.
should have our affections fixed here. and that we should be as it were
buried in earth, but as Christ is risen by the glory of God, so should we
walk in newenesse of life, bending and setting all our desires above in the
heavens: as S. Paul does admonish us thereof. And being so ascended, let us
descend unto our neighbors without forsaking heaven. The which we shall do,
if leading Romans 5. 4. Collo. 3. 12
an honest, holy, and heavenly life, we occupy ourselves in hearing of
wholesome doctrines, admonitions, exhortations, and declarations.

Thus doing, we may say with Saint Paul, that our conversation is heaven. And
so albeit that our bodies, yea our whole persons be on earth, yet are we
ascended up to heaven, and there have our dwelling by faith and hope. And
finally as Jesus Christ is ascended above al heavens, for to prepare the place
for us, so shall we rise again by his power, by the which also we shall
ascend up to heaven, though none be ascended: as it is given us to
understand by this first interrogation. The second, Who has gathered the
wind in his fist? Cannot be answered affirmatively of any man whatsoever: for
he has no power to stay the wind: there is none but God that can use it at
his pleasure: as he has created Amos. 4. 13.
the wind, so does he hold and lock it up, as in a treasure house, that it
should not blow, and afterward does send it forth when he shall think
good. There is none then but God that gathers the wind in his fist? that is
to say, which hides it, and Psalm. 104. 4. and 125. 7 Iere. 10. 13 and 51. 15
holds it by his power, and then vnlooseth it so softly and smally, so great
and vehement as he pleases: and there is no man that has in any wise the
wind at his will, The Apostles, which were very familiar and friends of
Christ, could not make the wind to cease that tossed them on the Sea: but
Jesus rebuked the winds and the Sea, and a great stillness and calmness
followed. And therein he declared that he was not only man, but the son of
Mat. 8. 26
God also, yea everlasting and eternal God.

Now if a man have not the wind in his power, which is a creature made for
his use, much less has he power over the spirit of God, who is the spirit
that only inspireth into man wisdom and prudence, and indueth him with
graces according to the measure of the gifts of Christ, who has the fullness
of this spirit, for to hold the same as it pleases him, and also to
distribute the same to whom he shall see good: and chiefly to the elect of God
his father, which confess him. And we al have received of his fullness, grace
for grace. Grace is given unto us according unto the measure of the the gift of
Christ. Now there are diversity of gifts: but there is John. 1. 16 Ephe. 4.
7 1. Cor. 12. 4
but one spirit. The third, Who has bound the waters in a garment? The
waters of their nature that God gave them in their creation, covered all the
earth: and for the commodity and use of man he has discovered the earth,
making the waters to withdraw themselves which he has enclosed in their
limits, that they should not pass their bounds without his leave or
commandment: as the Genesis 1. 9 Psalm. 33. 7 Iere. 6. 22 Job. 38. 8. 9 10. 11.
Psalm. 104. 6 7. 8. 9 Exo. 14. 21 Ios. 3. 15. 16 Eze. 36. 25 Esaias. 55. 1 John.
4* and 7
Scripture witnesses. And thus, there is no man that can bind so great an
heap of waters with his garment: but God does enclose and hold them in at
his pleasure: as besides these witnesses of the Scripture, we may see it in the
miracles that he wrought in the red Sea, and in the flood of Jordan. And if a
man has not the power to bind in the material and corporal waters, so much
the less are we capable of the clean waters of the holy Ghost, the which
satisfy the^ that drink thereof, and does fill them with all prudence,
wisdom, knowledge and understanding. But as God has promised them unto unto
us, so does he exhort and call us to drink them. And as he does exhort and
call us, even so does he give them unto us by Jesus Christ, when by faith we
receive his word, the which quickneth unto eternal life: as he does assure us
thereof.

The fourth, Who has established all the ends of the earth? It may be
answered, that it is neither one man, nor al men together. Mat. 6. 27 and 5. 36.
They have no power to add one cubite unto their height, neither to make one
hair white or black: how then can they establish the earth at their pleasure
or will? And also the earth is an incomprehensible heaviness and greatness: as
the Scripture does witness. But God only creating the earth has stablished the
ends thereof, Job. 38. 4. 5. 6
and there is none that can augment or diminishe it, it is he who by his
Prophet Esaias says, Who is he that has measured the waters with his fist,
etc. Thou have set all the borders of the earth, thou Esaias. 40. 12. Psalm. 74. 18.
have made Summer and Winter. And if we can neither give ordinance to the
earth, nor establishe her bounds in our hands, so much the less can we
handle the wisdom of God which fills heaven and earth at our pleasure: but
we must acknowledge that we are bruitishe, and to demand of God the wisdom
that is meet for us. For if he be owner of the earth, and the contents
thereof, and who has given the same to men, by a more strong reason he gives
wisdom, whereby we are drawn from the earth, and raised up to heaven.

The fifth, What is his name? It is impossible to be named, seeing that (as
has been said) the foresaid things are not in no man's power whatsoever.
And thus, man can have no fame nor praise for the things aforesaid. But the
mighty God is he alone, that has al those things in his hand: whose name
we know not, except he reveal it unto us. For albeit there is no people so
barbarous, but knows that there is a god, yet whe^he is not glorified as God,
nor thanks given unto him, but that the most part of the world and almost
every where, they are become vain in their thoughts, as says Saint Paul: by
this is showed that we know not Romans 1. 21.
his name. To the end then that he may be glorified of us, let us worship
him alone, in calling upon him, giving him thanks, singing forth his praises,
and confessing him to be author of al goodness, and obeiyng him according to
his word in all fear and reverence. He has declared his name, unto us, which
is not only wonderful, and worthy that we should tremble at it, knowing our
infirmity, but also therewith that we should be assured because of his
goodness, and love that he bears unto us. For as his name is the Almighty,
the everlasting, strong, fearful, taking vengeance, and punishing the wicked
and ungodly, that he is a burning fire, and co^suming his enemies, and that it
is a very fearful matter to fall into the hands of the living God: even so his
name, is the God, only Savior, father of mercy, pitiful, patient, slow to
wrath, showing mercy unto a thousand generations, protector and defendour of
the afflicted, and al them that trust in him. Behold a very wonderful name as
it is he is here expressed: but it is far of from being set forth and
described according to the dignity and excellency thereof. For there is no
understanding that can attain unto the perfection of this name: and
consequently there are neither mouths nor tongues that can declare and show
forth this name, according to the worthiness thereof.

The sixth, And what is his sons name, if thou can tell? If we know not
the name of the father, we cannot know the name of the son: for the sons do
oftentimes bear the name of their fathers, even from son, to son that they
may boast of the Nobility and long continuance of their stock and lineage.
Likewise, if the fathers were never men of renown, the children are little
regarded to be known. Wherefore, if we speak here of men, we may rightly
answer, that no man knows the name of his son, that is ascended up into
heaven: for we cannot know the name of that which cannot be. And therefore,
if we will know the name of his son that is ascended up into heaven, we
must pull away our regard from men, and come to God, and he will teach us the
name of his son: For none knows the son but the father. None can come
unto me except my father draw him. And Mat. 11. 27. John. 6. 44. and 17. 1. 5.
again, praying unto the father that he would glorify him, he shows well
that it is the father that gives the name of his son to be known. And also
the son, who is the everlasting word of the father, is one self God with
the father. And how shall we come unto the father, seeing he dwells in a
light that is inaccessible? John. 1. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 16
For this cause has he sent us his sacred word by his Prophets, Apostles
and Ministers, yea by his own son, by whom he has declared his name unto us,
such as we have heard: and also therein he declares unto us the name of his
son. And first of al, he shows him unto us, to be almighty and eternal,
when Moses does teach us that God made al things in speaking the word. The
heavens were made by the word of the Lord, etc. Al Genesis 1 Psalm. 33. 6 John. 1.
3 Collo. 1. 15 16. 17. Heb. a. 1. Gene. 22. 18. Gala. 3. 8. 16.
things were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made, etc.
By whom also he made the worlds.

Secondly, he does show him unto us, merciful, and a redeemer. And al nations
shall be blessed in thy seed, who is Christ. The Scepter shall not be taken away
from Judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until that Silo come: which
signifies the son, or Messiah. And in Leuiticus, by the Sacrifices, which
were figures of the only sacrifice, by the which he has found eternal
redemption, in offering up himself.

Thirdly he shows him a Savior unto us, when he saves and delivers his
people from Egypt. For this is the angel that guided Gene. 49. 10. Heb. 9. 12.
Exo. 13. 21. and 14. 15. Esaias. 7. 14. and 9. 6.
them, who is called the Lord: and is called the angel of God. This name of
Savior is well expressed, when he is called Emanuel. And a child is borne
unto us, and a son is given unto us, etc. It is also well expressed in Saint
Matthewe the first Chapter, and in Luke the second Chapter. Behold an
excellent and wonderful name, and the which cannot be comprehended, nor
expressed as is worthy. For this cause Saint Paul exalts him above al
things that Phil. 2. 9. John. 5. 23.
may be named. Wherefore, let us confess ourselves brutishe that we may
glorify God our father: the which we cannot do, if we contemn the son.
For albeit that he has so much humbled and abased himself, yet God has not
ceased to give him al authority, al power, al government, and to commit unto
him the salvation of our souls, to the end that whosoever believes in him,
should not perish, but be saved by his name. And as we may understand in these
dictions, and words, God, and Jesus, we must not comprehend John. 3. 16.
Acts. 4. 12.
the name of the father and the son, but in the divine and everlasting power,
in the goodness, righteousness, truth and mercy.

5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield to those, that trust in him.
We neither will nor can understand what God is toward us: and for this cause,
when he speaks unto us, we believe him not, nor make account of his word, no
more or less then of tales and fables. And when he offers himself unto us to
help us, to defend and to deliver us, we do no more trust him then the most
miserable man in the world. And albeit that he might justly reject us, cast us
of, condemn and destroy us for our malice and ingratitude, yet taking pity
upon us, he yeldeth himself unto us and bears with our rudenes, and
dissembleth and will not know our malice and ingratitude. And for to do this he
speaks unto us, not in his almighty and high majesty, but by similitudes
that are familiar: and amongst other, for to teach us that when he speaks to
us, we ought greatly to praise his word, and to hold it true and infallible,
without any douting, and also that it should be our chiefest delight, he
compares his word unto silver that is thoroughly purified and cleansed from al
his dross, and whose goodness and pureness may easily be known. And now the
wise man does Psalm. 12. 7. and 18. 31. and 119. 14.
the like, saying, Every word, etc. Not that we can find any thing, in this
world how precious soever it is, that is worthy to have the word of God to be
compared unto him: for it surmounteth infinitely and beyond reason, al things
which are and that may be ymagined to be excellent and precious. Also there is
nothing in this world how precious soever it is, but does participate with the
earth, and needs Psalm. 119. 21 127. 162. Pro. 3. 13.
to be purged and cleansed from his dross and superfluities: before he can be
pure and clean: but the word of God is pure and clean of it self, and
neither has nor can have any dross: for it proceeds not from a furnace and
fyning pot, but from the mouth of GOD, which neither can, nor will bring forth
any work, but shall be so perfect as it ought to be, and wherein nothing may be
amended. Wherefore when it is said, is pure purged, or tried as it were in the
fire, even as we purify and try gold or silver, it is not to say that at any
time it has been in tangled or mixed with any filthiness or superfluities, but
only that it is infallible, true and faithful, and should in no wise fear to
believe our God, when he speaks unto us by his scripture, by his servants,
Prophets, Apostles, Pastors, and Doctors, but that his word should be very
precious and dear unto us, as the worldlings make great account of gold and
silver, of Jewels and precious stones when al those things are thoroughly
purged from their superfluities and filthiness: and so at the least let us
give so much honor unto our God, when it pleases him to speak unto us, and
to offer us his gifts and spiritual graces, his favor and mercy by his word,
as do the worldlings give unto goldsmiths whom they esteem, to be no
deceiuer: and that we may say with an unfeigned heart with David. The law of
the Lord is perfect, restoring Psalm. 19. 8.
the soul, etc. If we give not thus much honor unto the word of GOD, albeit
that of it self it is purified silver, we turn the same, so much as in us
lies, into brass, iron, and lead, yea into dross, and so to our destruction.
And as the worldlings rejoice, and take great delight, when they are well
furnished with gold and silver thoroughly fined, and with very precious jewels:
even so ought Psalm. 119. 14
our delight to be in the word of God, for to cleave theretoo by faith and
conversation, so that we may say, I have delighted in the way of thy statutes,
more then in all riches. In this sort, as the rich which enjoy their
pleasures, are esteemed before the world to be happy, even so shall we be
happy and blessed before our God when our joy shall be in his word. Furthermore,
when men are furnished, Psalm. 1. 2.
with riches, they so glorify and rejoice, that they persuade themselves to be
out of danger of their enemies, and do promise to themselves that none evil
shall come to them. For they think they have wherewith to withstand them and to
defend themselves, and are strongly fortified: as Solomon has pronounced, the
rich man's Pro. 10. 15.
goods are his strong city. And if they have such trust in their riches which
are vain and transitory, by amore strong reason, when the everlasting, and
the living God does give himself unto us, both himself and al his riches by
his word which indureth for ever, we must well understand and mark what he
says unto us, and to be fully assnred thereof, without any doubt: for as it is
written, He is a shield to the^ that trust in him. Whereunto the wise man
agrees in this present Psalm. 18. 31.
sentence. Wherein we are taught to fear nothing that may hurt us: for we have
a good shield for to withstand al adversary and contrary power, and to
overthrow and confound the^. And forasmuch as God is our buckler and shield, we
are admonished to show ourselves strong and valiant. For as a buckler is not
profitable in the hand of a feeble and weak child, of a slouthful, cowardly
and faintharted soldier: even so except we be strong, diligent, and stout,
it is but in vain that we shall call God our shield. And therefore S. Paul does
admonish us us, Finally, my brethren be strong, in the Lord, and in the power
of his Ephe. 6. 10.
might, etc. Moreover, when it is expressly said, to those that trust in him,
let us understand that as the unbelieving do despise God, even so does he
despise and cast them of, and gives them unto Satan. For this cause S. Peter
does admonish us to withstand him, being strong 1. Pet. 5. 9.
in the faith: and in this sort we shall obtain victory.

6 Put nothing unto his words, least he reprove thee, and thou be found a
liar.
Moses having admonished the people of Israel to hear and to keep the
ordinances and statutes that he taught them to do: for to show the people what
obedience, submission and straight observation they ought unto those
ordinances: he says, Ye shall put nothing unto the Deuteronomy. 4. 2.
word, that I command you, etc. This is that which he shows the^, that God
for to try our obedience, will not have us to run by unknown and crooked
ways, for to run cross the fields, to devise what we shall think good: but
that he will hold us as it were bound and tied wholly unto his word, and should
know that the same is al our wisdom, and that we must not be learned for to
mingle any thing with the word of God: but should make this conclusion,
forasmuch as God has spoken unto us, it is not lawful therefore for mortal men
to enterlace any thing therein, whatsoever: but should be contented to have
heard such a master. But there is nothing worse kept then is this for men
think always to have in them some reason, and to be able enough to govern
themselves. Now this is a great pride, when men will discern between good and
evil, yea after their own fantasy: and contrarily God will be esteemed alone
wise for us, and that we should be as poor sheep, hearing the voice of their
shephearde, and that we should forget this ableness that the unbelieving
ymagine to have: that we should know, Oh, there is nothing in us but error and
foolishnes, there is nothing but vanity and lying in us, until that God have
taught us. And as when it is said: Ye shall put nothing thereto, this is for to
show us that God only is wise, and has authority to rule us, and should
learn to hold this simplicity: to wit, that we should be only wise for to
obey what he commands us, that he may have al pre-eminence: even so when he
forbids, to take any thing from this word, it is not without cause. For if
we will partly and in somethings obey God, and notwithstanding would exempt
ourselves from what we thought good, behold such a partaking should never be
received, as there are many which will be content to obey that which shall not
be too grievous and sore for them: but if there be once a thing that troubles
them, they straight ways desire to be discharged, and do contemn the same.
But whosoever keeps all the law, if he break but one point, yet is he Iam.
2. 10.
guilty of al. Heereunto agrees the wise man: for having commended the word of
God unto us, in attributing there too pureness and faythfulnes, dignity and
excellency, saying that it is purified as gold or silver is purified: having
also attributed unto God, that he is our force, defender and protector,
saying, that he is their shield that put their trust in him: for to show us,
that this only pureness and excellenle^cie, ought to suffice us, and that we
should ymagine no other truth, nor to labor to feign any other excellent thing
besides this word: and also for to show unto us, that this word is so
excellent and precious, that it will not suffer any mixture: and that thereby
God certifieth us sufficiently of the help, defense and protection that he
gives unto them which receive this word with assurance, he admonishes us
saying, Put nothing unto his words. He says not, and take nothing from
them: albeit that we must understand, that as we ought to put nothing there
too, so must we not also take any thing from it: but the wise man would
defend, and chiefly forbid that wherein wise, holy and devout men in their
own sight do most rejoice, and challenge merit: as Monks and Nuns, which
brag of their works of supererogation, by the which they persuade themselves
that they merit and deserve both for themselves and for other, for that, that
they do more (as they think) then is commanded them. But this their bragging
and boasting is against their own conscience. For if they have servants or
maids which do more then they are commanded, they will say, that they are
servants for the Devil, because they do more then they are commanded.
Whereupon follows, that so far it is of that by their works of
supererogation (as they call them) they deserve any thing of God, that rather,
they forsake and renounce him for their Lord and master, and do auouche the
Devil for their master, whom they serve as may be judged by their own mouths.
Therefore if the wise man forbids that which is praise worthy before men,
which forget their duty, by a more strong reason let us understand that he
closely forbids that which is evil without contradiction and gain saying.
For albeit that al men by their natural corruption do take from the words of
God, in not giving unto him perfect obedience, in not trusting only in him
altogether, yet there is no man whose conscience does not condemn, that it is
ill done to diminishe and take from the words of God. The wiseman therefore
labors to make us forsake our own wisdom, the which is both a foul folly,
and also detestable and abominable before God, and would not have us to mingle
it with the word of God, which is so pure and clean, so faithful and true. By
this foul wisdom and foolish rebellions and ouerweening, we judge that the
word of God is but a small matter, that it is too simple and plain, and that it
is of no great show or appearance. And therefore by this wisdom, either we
despise and refuse the word of God, or for to help him, or for to give it more
goodly show, we bring in our devotions and fantasies, our traditions and
customs, thinking in this sort to have a more strong stay, then if we did
stand to the simple and plain word of God, and to be better armed and fenced,
then if we were contented that God only should be our buckler and shield. In
which doing we do outragiously misuse our God, who only is most good and most
mighty, and tread under feet holy things and precious pearls, to wit, his
word so excellently purified. And in this manner we make ourselves exceeding
guilty and reproueable, not before the wise worldlings, who in this matter do
well allow us, but before God, who knows the hearts, and searches the
raines. And also he will not fail nor miss to reprove those which are so
arrogant to put to his word: for even when they put and add too, they do
then take from it, not yelding him the honor, that belongs unto him, neither
rendering the obedience they owe unto him. For there are none of those braggers
but will omit many things, and sin fowly also in diverse things. And those
that we shall esteem the most holy and most devout, are commonly the foulest
and most stinking, so that we may place them in the number of them which are
reproved and rebuked, in the Psalm. 50. ver. 16. And also the wise man places
the^ in the like order, saying, least he reprove thee: adding theretoo the
cause, and thou be found a liar. For it is as much as if he said, God only is
truth, and his word is only true: wherefore thou must trust unto it, and not
presume to add unto his word. For albeit that for a certain time he dissemble
and wincke at it, yet at the last he will reprove thee, and convince thee of
lying and falshoode. For he that presumes to add unto this pure and
infallible truth, is alyer: not only because he puts forth trifles for to
obscure and darken the truth, but also that he reproves God of lying, and so
much as in him lies does make the truth nothing worth, when he has mingled
therewith, the fantasies and inventions of his own head. And thus, he rightly
deserves to be reproved and rebuked, yea with sore and grievous punishment:
wherewith the liars are threatened. Psalm. 5. 7.


7 Two things have I required of thee: deny me them not, before I dye.
Albeit that he which speaks here, has called himself brutish, confessing
what he was of himself, yet we see here that he was very wise and well learned,
when he knew that it was to God, to whom he ought to direct his prayers, in
confessing him to be the author, and also giver of al good things, and that no
where else we can find nothing that is any thing worth or obtain it. And
knowing this, he shows himself very discreet, when he directs himself
unto God, who has promised to help and to succor those which shall require
him in truth that he will hear them, giving them according unto their requests
when time requires it, and as shall be expedient. The which promise is enclosed
in the covenant that the Lord made with Abraham And in performing of this
promise, he has provided for the generation of Abraham, for to deliver them
from Genesis 12. 33. and 13. 14. 15 and 17. 7. 8. Genesis 4^. 7. 8. Exo. 2. 23. 24.
and 3. 4.
their bondage and afflictions: he sent Joseph before the^ into Egypt, for to
feed them in the time of famine. When they groned and lamented under the
tyranny of Pharao, God remembered this covenant, and provided for them a
deliverer: And not only then, but also in all their necessities: when they cried
unto God in sure trust, he succored the^ at their need, as we may see in the
holy histories, and by the care that he had to sent the^ his servants the
Prophets. The which David does well acknowledge. The wise man then looking and
trusting Psalm. 22. 5. 6. and 34. 5. 6. 7. 8.
in this covenant, does direct his request unto God, saying unto him, Two
things have I required of thee. When he says, I have required, and that again
he requires the same: he shows that he was neither cold nor mad, neither
light nor impatient to look for the help and assistance of God, but that his
heart was fervent and through great and invincible constancy he perseuered in
prayer and patience, looking for his good pleasure, nothing distrusting but
that he should obtain his request: as he does well show, when he is not grieved
nor wearied to co^tinew his prayer: the which he could not do, if he distrusted
God. And therewith by this continuation he shows that he believes and
knows how God only is the author of al goodness, and how we must not seek
for that which is profible or necessary for us elsewhere, or of any other: and
also this word thee, does show it. For it is as much as if he said, for to
obtain whatsoever I shall need, I should not run unto the creatures, how holy
and worthy soever they be: but as I believe that thou art Creator of al things,
even so I believe that of thy power, goodness, and providence, thou only
gouernest thy creatures, giving unto them, whatsoever thou know to be
expedient unto them: and therefore, it is thou only, who have the power and the
will to help, and to grant my request, that I have already required. And as
he does express, his request tends to obtain two things: also two
things chiefly are very necessary for us, for this present life: to wit, an
holy and pure conversation, and riches for to sustain the outward man, that
we may be strong for to do our office. It may seem after a sort, that Jacob
making his vow unto God demands Gene. 28. 20.
of him these two things, that is to say holy conversation, when he says, If
the Lord God will be with me, and keep me in the way that I shall walk: and will
give me bread to eat, and clothes to put on, etc. True it is, he desires the
help, defense and protection of God, but under the same we may comprehend
holy conversation, for it follows the help of God. Now the wise man knew
very well that these two things are necessatie for us in this temporal and
transitory life: and therefore he requires, saying,

Deny me not them, before I dye. When after having said, I have required, he
adds, Deny me them not. He continues still his request, not by distrust or
doubt that he has, how God will not hear him, but rather for to signify
and confess that al riches both temporal and spiritual come from God alone,
and that if he should deny them unto us, there is none that can do us any
good, neither can obtain any thing healthful for us. The holy fathers did well
understand this: as they do declare, when they do, as it were importunatly
complain of the absence of God, and that they demand, he would arise, and
would show his face, and that he would not hide himself, nor be far from
them. He shows also, that he prays with an earnest affection, without
fayning, and that he feels truly and indeed how he had great need that
God should assist and help him. For also every man of himself, wants
whatsoever is necessary for him: but there are none but the faithful which
feel it truly: and therefore they pray with a true affection of heart.
Forasmuch as it is necessary for us in this life, to walk holily, and to have
victuals and food: and that after our decease and departure we cannot give
remedy, and amend that which we have done amiss, and that the dead do
nothing participate with the living: Therefore the wise man requires that God
would grant unto Eccle. 9. 6.
him that which he requires, before he die. Wherein we ought to learn, that
we must not eat our bread with idleness, but to spend our time in good
works, the which we should labor to obtain by prayers and requests: for
of ourselves we can do nothing: It is God that works both the will and the
deed, even of his good pleasure. And because that the days of man are short
and that Phil. 2. 13.
he vanishes away as does the grass, and that there is none that knows
certainly either the day or the hour of his departing out of this life, we are
taught that if we will do well before we dye, we must not defer nor put of
from day to day, but with all care and diligence to give ourselves unto goodness,
what age soever we have: and that in working, we should not challenge any
thing unto our free will, or free choice, as if we had power of ourselves to
govern us: but we must confess that it is the grace and mercy of God that
guides us: as the wise man does show us in this request, by the which he
asks two things, the which he now declares, saying,

8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me not poverty, nor riches:
feed me with food, meet for mine estate.
When he says that God has created man unto his likeness and image, we ought
to understand that man at the beginning of his Gene. 1. 27.
creation was pure and clean, was wise, upright, and true: as S. Paul also
does give us the same to understand, having admonished us, to mortify our
earthly members, etc. He would have us to put on Col. 3. 5. 10. 12
the new man, which is renewed by the knowledge of God after the image of him
that has created him, etc. And for to show us how we should conserve this
image in the knowledge of God, he does admonish us: Now therefore as the elect
of God, holy and Ephe. 4. 22.
beloved, put on tender mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long suffering, etc. And according heereunto, he exhorts us, to cast of,
concerning the conversation in time past, the old man, which is corrupt
through the deceiuable lusts, etc. But men by their pride and ingratitude are
turned away from this knowledge, and have contemned it, as a vain thing: and
in stead that they were made excellent of God, they are concerning themselves
as beasts: and in place that God had made them upright, they have Eccle. 3.
18. and 7. 30.
sought many inventions, by the which they have cast of the uprightness and
excellency, that consisted in righteousness, wisdom, holiness and truth. And
being thus spoiled, in steed that they should have humbled themselves, and
be confounded and ashamed, they have thought themselves to be wise: they have
commended themselves as if they were saints, righteous and true: but they are
become vain, foolish, yea mad and liars: so that it is not without cause why
the scripture makes diverse complaints of it. And in this sort they have
thrown themselves into death, from the which they in no wise of themselves
rise again, neither also will be raised: for Psalm. 4. 3. and 39. 6. and 62.
10. and 116. 11.
it is to the same that their corrupt nature does wholly tend, and take his
delight. Now because we desire not death, but do fear it, and would gladly
shun it, and cannot of ourselves, therefore it is necessary for us to ask
of God, that he would purify and cleanse us from that which brings us death:
that is to say, from our sins and misdeedes: (the which the wise man
comprehends under vanity and lying) and for the which we pray with him:
Remove far from me, etc. Wherein first of al he shows us, that if we will
truly pray unto God, we must confess our sins unto him: as does the wise
man, requiring that it might please God to remove far from him vanity and
lying. And in this manner he confesses that he is brutish, and that if God did
not take mercy upon him, he should be nothing but vain, foolish, and to change
the glory of the incorruptible Romans 1. 23.
God, into the similitude of the image of a corruptible man. The which
contains lying: for being ydolaters, we do falsely usurp the name of God,
giving the same unto ydols. And for this cause also, the wise man has joined
vanity and lying together, and makes but one thing of them both, the which is
the first of the two things that he puts into his request. And also it is
good reason that we should be careful first of al to serve God, and to yield
unto him only, the honor and the glory which belongs unto him. And the same
well to begin, we must abhor ydolatrie: the which is here signified by
vanity and lying. And also the Prophets do call ydols, vanity Esaias. 41. 44.
29. and 44. 20 Iere. 2. 5. 11. and 10. 3. 14. 15. and 14. 22. and 51. 17. 18
Romans 1. 24.
and lying: though they use not the like words: yet those which they use, are
of like signification. Now it is not without cause that under vanity, (which
with us, is ydolatrie) we should comprehend al sins: for it does beget them
and bring them forth. In all ages, and amongst al nations we have seen, and may
yet still see, that the ydolaters (even those which are the deuoutest) do give
themselves unto dishonestie, filthiness and uncleanness, unto oppression and
crucltie, even with an unbridled lust and desire. And the Prophets also do
make great complaints thereof, and do reproach the ydolaters that they have
forsaken God, and that they have their hands full of blood. If then we will
begin earnestly to serve God, we must begin first to hate ydolatrie,
following the doctrine that Jacob gave to his household, and God in the beginning
of his law. Notwithstanding we might say that vanity is the corruption and
wickedness Gene. 352. Exo. 20. 3. 4.
wherein we are borne, and that it is rooted in us from our conception: the
which vanity, if we yield unto, and obey, brings forth his fruit: to wit,
lying, either in words or deeds, or falsehoode. The which fruit man brings
forth to the dishonor of God, and hurt of his neighbors: to wit, when he
is become an hypocrite and ydolater: afterward vain swearing, blaspheming,
perjury, manifest contemning and scorning of the truth, and holy Religion:
when he is become a false witness, slandering, flattering, and a taleteller,
and to counterfeit and to shadow things to deceive: and also when he does not
unto his neighbor as he would be done unto. And thus, the wise man desires to
be purified from all the inward and outward transgressions that he shall commit
against the law of God. And because that evil words corrupt good manners, 1.
Cor. 15. 33
we have need not only that vanity which is in us, and falshoode that we
commit, should be removed far from us, but also that we should fly and avoid
al evil and naughty tongues, and all wicked men in their trades, and that we
should ask of God to give us fellowship of wholesome words and holy
conversation. The second thing, he requires, is, give me not poverty, etc.
After that the wise man has required what is necessary for the life of the
soul, he asks such things as are necessary for the body, the which we may
lawfully demand. For albeit that Jesus Christ does show us by diverse
arguments and reasons that we ought not to care for Mat. 6. 25.
food nor other corporal necessities of this life, and that he does
admonish us to seek first of all the kingdom of God and the righteousness
thereof: yet nevertheless he does not thereby forbid that we should not
ask and seek for our corporal necessaries: otherwise he would not teach us to
pray unto God our father for to give us our daily bread: neither also should
any man have need to til and plowe the earth, to plant, to sow, to gather and
lay up in sellers and garners, the fruits that the earth has brought forth.
It is then lawful for us to ask things at Gods hands, that are necessary for
our bodies: as we have seen heretofore how Jacob has demanded them: but yet
it must be done without care, and without distrust: and that we should know
that as the earth is the Lords, so does the same obey him, bringing forth his
fruits according as he commands it: and thus, we can have no food, but so
much as it pleases God to give us thereof, yea though we labor. For he which
labors, or he that waters, is nothing: but God that gives the increase.
Wherefore we must know that it is not only laweful for us 1. Cor. 3. 7.
to ask and seek for our bodily necessities, but also it is necessary, (in
humbling ourselves and confessing that all riches come unto us from the
bountifulness and liberality of our heavenly father) we should not be
unthankful, but that without dissimulation we should give him thanks
therefore. Now that we may rightly ask and seek for such things of him, as
are necessary for us, we must not follow the desires of our flesh, the which
is insatiable, but to content ourselves with mediocrite, as the wise man does
show us, in this present text, the which contains three members. The first
is, he requires that God would not give him poverty. Wherein there seems
to be an absurdity. For albeit that he confesses (as it may seem) that
poverty is given of God, yet is it there refused, where it ought to be
precious, if it be a gift of God: and also to consider how God has always
had the poor in great estimation, and has exalted many of them: and also
Jesus Christ says that to them Mat. 5. 3. and 25. 40.
belongs the kingdom of heaven: likewise he calls them his brethren.
Heereunto we answer, that as a child says to his father give me no rods:
even so the wise man calls poverty, the gift of Genesis 3. 17. 18 Leui. 26. 14.
Deuteronomy. 28. 15 Prou. 6. 9.
God, and requires that God would not give him poverty. And this is because
he knows that poverty is a rod, yea a curse that God sends in the world
for the sins thereof. And albeit that we must patiently bear poverty, when
God gives it, and never the more to think that God hates us, no more then a
good and wise father hates his child, when he gives him rods: as we are
well taught it, when God by his word so diligently commends the poor, as
has been alleged sometimes. And although that Saint Paul says, Romans 8. 35.
That neither hunger nor nakedness shall separate us from the love of Christ:
and that in poverty we must neither be discouraged nor despair: yet is it
lawful to avoid the same, by the means that God teaches us by his word,
the which are labor, and prayer. For albeit that labor is ordained of God,
yet shall it not profit any thing, except God himself do bless it, the Gene.
2. 15 and 3. 17. Ephe. 4. 28. 2. These. 3. 6. Psalm. 50. 15.
which we must obtain by prayer: as he does teach us, when he says, Call
upon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee. Whereunto the wise
man now agrees, when he runs to God, beseeching him, that he would not
give him poverty. Thus praying he requires privily that God would grant him
grace that he might be able to labor, and that he would bless his travail,
the which otherwise, should be vain and of no profit. We see then there is
no absurdity in the request of the wise: but that it is laweful for us to make
the like request: as also Jesus Christ does teach Mat. 6. 11.
us, when he would have us to ask our daily bread. The second is, he asks
that God would not give him riches. Wherein it might seem at the first sight,
that he would rebuke riches, and reject them, as if they were evil and
hurtful: but if his intent were such, it should be evil: seeing that God has
created riches, and gives them to whom he thinks good for to make them to
prosper: as he did to Abraham and other Patriarchs, to David and other kings,
to Job and to diverse other: and also the scripture calls riches a blessing:
as has been already alleged diverse times. Therefore it is not the mind of
the wise man to refuse riches, as evil things: for in so doing, he should do
injury to God: but the wise man did distrust himsef, and knew that he was of
the same nature, that were many more which had abused, and did abuse the riches
of the world in diverse sorts, to the dishonor of God, to their own hurt,
and also the contempt and hurt of their neighbors. For the rich men of the
world do often abuse their riches unto ydolatrie: for the which to maintain
they will spare nothing: as may be seen in the making of the molten Calfe, and
when it is said that the images of the heathen are but silver and gold
(albeeit it is Exo. 32. 3. Psalm. 115. 4. 1. King. 11. 7. and 12. 28.
said for to show the unprofitableness and the vanity of ydolls, and the
foolishness of ydolaters) and Solomon built an high place for Camos the
abominable ydol of the Moabites, etc. And Jeroboam made two golden calves.
And now also and at all times we may see amongst the Papists, how the
rich do spate nothing for to maintain their service, which they call divine.
They abuse riches also unto their own hurt, when they distrust GOD, and put
their trust in their riches. For so doing, they deprive themselves of the
kingdom of God, as the rich have done. Finally, they abuse them, to the
contempt and hurt of their neighbor. Mat. 19. 23. Luke. 12. 19. and 16. 19.
James. 2. 6. and 5. 4. 1. Tit. 6. 9. 10 17. 18. 19.
For they care not to help them, as the two foresaid: but rather do oppress
them. S. Paul has comprehended these three abuses, from the which he would
have the rich (with out forsaking their riches) to turn away. Therefore when
the wise man says,

Give me not riches, etc. He does not condemn them, but he protes^th that
he has not set his heart upon them: and prays unto God, as David did,
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, Psalm. 119. 36
and not to covetousness. For except that God himself give help, it is an
ordinary thing to be given unto covetousness, even from the least unto the
most. Ierem. 6. 13.


The third is, that he requires that God would feed him with the
breadmeete for his estate. Wherein he desires according Mat. 6. 11.
to that which Jesus Christ does teach us to say, Give us this day our daily
bread. And therewith we must be contented, as Saint Paul does teach us.
Wherein we are taught, that every man should carefully and faithfully employ
himself and labor in his vocation: otherwise he shall not be maintained with
the bread meet for his estate: that is to say, of the food that God has
prepared and appointed for him: but of the bread of other men: and so, he shall
exceed. For here, the state is not taken after the manner of worldlinges, who
commit great abuses for to maintain their state. The word that is here
translated, state, comes of a verb which signifies, to ordeine and appoint.
And so, when it is said.

Maintain me with the bread meet for my state: it is not to say, according
as I think to belong unto me, because of my highness and power, or of
worthiness and excellency: but as the bread that we eat justly, we call
ours, because God does give it us, and makes it ours by his grace: even so
do we call the bread that God ordeineth for us, the bread of our state, and of
the which we may justly and lawfully eat without doing hurt to other. Now by
the discourse of the former words, we may see, how the wise man has asked
of God holy and clean conversation, and wealth wherewithal to live, which are
two things very necessary for this present life: as has been handled, in
the 7. verse. For if our hearts be purified from vanity, and our mouths
cleansed from lying tales, as the wise man desires, the rest of the actions and
works of man will be pure and clean. And also that the wise man has desired
holy conversation, he shows, by the reasons following, when he says:

9 Least I be full, and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? or least I be
poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
According as the wise man was the son of Adam, he was of the same vicious
and corrupted nature, as well as other, the which he knew well enough: and
therefore distrusting himself, he feared least he should fall into the
enormities which are daily committed by the word, whereby the wrath and anger
of God is provoked, and so come to destruction. Now he saw that the rich
men were always full, and filled themselves: that is to say, that they enjoyed,
so much as they could, their worldly and carnal delights and pleasures, and
wallowed in filthiness, pollutions, and abominations, with an unbridled
lust, in taking their delights and pleasutes, in sleeping and resting, in
gluttony and drunkenness, in whoredom and committing other shameful acts. For
the which things God made his wrath to fall upon them, sending a flood of waters
upon all the earth: making fire and brimstone to rain from heaven upon
Sodom: suddenly killing of the rich glutton (Luke the 12.) who boasted of
his abundance: and condemning the rich into hell, of whom Luke speaks in
his 16. Chapter. When these men were at their ease, because of the abundance of
wealth and riches they had, therefore they made no account of any admonitions,
declarations, and threatenings: as may be known in that that they amended not
their lines, when Noe, the Ambassador of righteousness, condemned them by
building of the Arc: and when the Zodomites daily afflicted, the soul of
righteous Lot: also when poor Lazarus full of sores, lay at the rich man's gate.
In this manner they denied God by deed: and though they had not at al opened
their mouths, yet had they in great contempt and scorning said at the least in
their hearts, who is the Lord? Whereunto Job agrees, where he accuses the
rich which say unto god, depart from us, for we will none of the knowledge Job.
21. 14. 15 Esa. 29. 15. 16. and 5. 19.
of thy ways: and Esaias, Woe to those dreamers, which hide their counsel from
the Lord: and say, who sees us? etc. Who says, let him hasten his work. For
this interrogation, Who is the Lord? is as much as negation: to wit, that there
is no Lord. The which negation agrees well with the rich of this world, that
are covetous: Ephe. 5. 5. Col. 3. 5.
for they are ydolaters. And forasmuch as they are ydolaters, they deny that
there is a Lord, if it be not by words, yet it is with heart and deed, when
they place their wealth and felicity in riches which are of no continuance.
And therefore we may understand that it is not without cause that Jesus Christ
does pronounce woe, and that Saint Paul does deprive them of the kingdom of
heaven. Therefore when man, which is left unto himself, is Luke. 6. 24. 1. Cor.
6. 10.
so unreasonable, that for transitory and vain riches he will deny the
everlasting and almighty God, and loose his kingdom, it is not without cause
why the wise man requires of God, give me not riches. He saw also that the
poor did suffer much in this world. For they have nothing wherewith to
sustain themselves, neither do they find any that will help their need, as
they would gladly find some. And because they set more store by their panches
and bellies, then by the law of God, which says, thou shall not steal, they
forget this law, and give themselves unto stealing, laboring to persuade
themselves it is laweful to take something where they can find it. I say
expressly, laboring, and not believing. For if they believed that it were
lawful to rob, they would not hide themselves: and also when they should be
demanded, they would freely confess the theeuerie and robbery: but to cover
themselves they are feign to be forsworn, taking the name of God in vain.
The which the wise man feared, should happen unto him, as he does declare. And
albeit he adds not, that it is in vain, yet it neither ought nor can be
understood otherwise, then to say the truth. For commonly thieves are more
ready to swear falsely, then to speak truth. And also, forasmuch as God
wills and commands that we should swear by his name, when we have need,
therefore the wise man would not fear to take the name of his God, if it were
not in vain. Besides this, let us learn two things. The first is, That when
the wise man fears to be poor, least he should steal, and to be
perjured: he teaches poor men to require of God patience and a contented
mind, that they may forbear to steal: and that this is the principal, that
they may beware from taking the name of God in vain. For as God will not hold
him innocent, that takes his name in vain, even so thieves shall not inherit
the 1. Cor. 6. 11
kingdom of heaven. And thus the robbers have not only men against them, but
also they fall into the hands of the living God, the which is an horrible and
fearful thing. The second, that the rich are admonished to open their hands
and their bowels unto their poor brethren: as we have diverse instructions
thereof in the scripture, Heb. 10. 31.
as well in the old as new Testament, which have been sometimes alleged
before: let them be careful to help their necessities, to the end that they
give none occasion that the name of God be blasphemed, neither that their
neighbors should be spoiled and robbed: but so much as they can, let them
exercise mercy to the end that so much as in them lies they may save both
the bodies and souls of the poor. And as the rich ought to behave themselves
after this sort toward the poor, even so ought the wise in like case to do
unto the ignorant.

10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, least he curse thee, when thou have
offended.
We say commonly, that we must not add to, or increase his affliction that
is already afflicted. And although we should or ought to understand rhis
same naturally, yet are we so evil, that we resist that which we know to be
our natural duty. Because of this malice, God for to bring us unto amendme^t,
or if we will not be corrected, for to make us the more guilty and inexcusable,
does give us commandments, whereby he does show us that we should not afflict
the afflicted, but does forbid it us with threatenings. But there are no
commandments nor threatninges that can hinder or let many to delight to
trouble the miserable: as the flatterers, slaunderers, Exo. 22. 21 22. 23. 24
and tale carriers who because they may be the better welcome, will labor by
their false tongues, to sting and to make poor servants and slaves to be
hated of their masters, who are sharp enough otherwise, yea but too cruel:
and will tell such tales without knowledge of any fault: saving that by a
sinister judgment they will count some small and light thing for a fault, which
is not worth the speaking of: or else of set malice they interpret some thing
evil which is not so of it self, or at the least wise is tolerable: or else,
if a man make a fault, it may be ignorantly. The wise man would not have us
like unto these people, as he very plainly shows us, saying,

Accuse not a servant unto his master. And this that he says of the servant
(who was sometimes in a miserable state in respect of the world) we must
observe toward al persons which are in the power or in the subjection of an
other. For albeit that we have no such servants, yet the doctrine ceasseth not,
but to appertain unto us: and in observing of it, we must add nothing unto
the word of God. For it is contained under the commandment, Thou shalbeare no
false witness against thy neighbor: and it teaches us to walk in love, the
which covers a multitude of sins, as we have seen. It is patient, it
bears the infirmities of our neighbors: so far is it of Pro. 10. 12 2. Cor.
13. 4.
that it gives affliction upon affliction, or has an evil tongue, for to
torment him that seems to be at peace. Such charity is commanded us, not
only in the new Testament, but also in the old: even also toward our
enemies: by a more strong reason the^, toward those which nothing labor to
hurt us, we must be pitiful and merciful: Exo. 23. 4. 5.
or at the least wise, that we procure the^ not any trouble, by our
accusations, tales, slanders, or flatterings. For if we behave ourselves
otherwise, we shall be greatly guilty for the wrong that we shall do them, and
shall give them occasion to curse us, for the fault we shall commit against
them: as the wise man does express it saying,

Lest he curse thee when thou have offended, The which is done when the
afflicted complain of them which oppress them: for in crying out upon, and
complaining of the oppressors, is as much as if Deuteronomy. 15. 9
they cursed the^. Now God hears the cry of such afflicted, whereof it
follows, that he counts that which is done and committed against the
miserable poor, for sin: of the which number were chiefly the servants and
slaves, the which were handeled worse then beasts. For this cause the wise man
sets them forth, and would have them to be borne with all, and their
imperfections and weaknesses to be dissembled, rather then to cause them to be
evil entreated through tales and flatteries. Yet notwithstanding if the
miserable (as it is their custom for the greatest number) do commit
wickedness and ungodliness to the dishonor of God, to the slander and
detriment of their neighbors, we should not then hold our peace, nor fear
their cursings, but to accuse them according to the order that Jesus Christ
has appointed* Moreover let us note, that albeit the wise man does threaten
the accusers of the Mat. 18. 15
miserable for their cursing, yet does he not allow that we should curse,
though also a man were accused wrongfully. He knew well enough that Joseph a
slave in Egypt, had not cursed his masters Genesis 39
wife, though she had accused him falsely. David being a poor fugitive, did
not curse those which accused him unto Saul, but saved Psa. 109. 3. 4
himself as he might: and also prayed for them. He therefore does not allow
cursinges, but he reproves the vnpatiencie of the miserable, which know not
that it is God which raises up accusers against them, for to try their
patience, and to bring them unto the knowledge of their faults, that they might
come unto amendment: and knowing that they have well deserved to be accused, not
only before men, but also before God, they require pardon of their faults.
Therefore if we be miserable, and that it pleases God, to raise up against
us such people as do desire nothing but to stain us, for to make us yet more
miserable, even to destroy us, yet let us not for all that use cursings, but let
us follow that which Jesus Christ teaches us, concerning love toward our
enemies, and also his example Mat. 5. 44
therein. For when he was accused, he cursed not, but stood like a sheepee not
opening his mouth before his shearer. Finally, let us note, that as the
servants are miserable, that have evil willers, even so for the greatest number
the masters are too sharp and hard, too severe and rigorous, too wicked and
cruel: and therefore it is not without cause that the wise man would not have
servants to be accused to their masters. And closely herein he admonishes
as well the masters, as the servants to do their dueitie one toward another.
The which Saint Paul does largely and clearly handle in the Ephesians 6. and
Collos. 3. 4. and Titus 2. and Saint Peter 1. Chapter. 2.

11 There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their
mother.
God at the beginning created man like unto his image and likeness, that he
should walk in all holiness: as the Apostle Saint Collo. 3. 10
Paul declares. And since that, for to correct his corruption and his
wickedness, he has given him commandments: and the better to draw him, to
frame his life after them, he made him promises: and would that we should
order ourselves with all our affection and in true humility, with all softness
and gentleness under the obedience of his commandementes, and should trust
altogether upon his promises. And to the end that we should fear to forsake
them, he adds threatninges against the disobedient and vnbeleening, and
condemns them unto death. But there are but few people that make any great
account to maintein this image in them, which obey the commandments, which
trust in the promises, and which fear the threatninges and condemnation of
death: as we feel the same but too much in our time: and as has been seen
in old time, even as the holy histories do declare. And with these proofs we
have also now the wiseman which makes great complaint thereof in this present
sentence, and in other following: in the which he accuses not one man alone,
or some family, but a great number. For he says not, there are some men: but
he says, There is a generation. By the which word he signifies a very great
number, and a continual stock: and is as much as if he said, that from father
to son, and from son to son, the evil continues, and that the
successors do follow the corruption and the wickedness of their predecessors,
in a great number, and in a long time together. And as touching this present
sentence, we must note, it is not without cause why the wise man makes such
complaint. For nature teaches us that we should greatly esteem our fathers
and mothers, and should honor them in obeying them, in helping their
necessities, and in being altogether at their commandment without vexing or
troubling them: seeing we condemn those which do the contrary. Although that
young children do not think nor take such heed unto this natural law, as
they ought to do: yet is it not to say, but that it should be graven in
their hearts: as we may see it, when they are come to age, and have children:
For without the Scripture they could well enough ask their children the duty
they owe them. And the Heathen likewise, which never knew any thing of the
holy scripture, could very well say, That we cannot yield any recompense unto
our fathers and mothers. But in the time of the wise man, and long time before,
God, for to help nature, and to waken him up, had given his commandments by
writing: amongst the which he commands, Honor thy father and thy mother,
and to move the children to obey them, he adds a promise, saying, that thy
days may be long Exo. 20. 12.
on the land which the Lord thy God gives thee. And albeit that the promise
does closely import and carry with it a threatening and condemnation against
the disobedient: nevertheless, to the end that we should fear and be more
guilty and inexcusable, if we failed in the duty toward our parents, God
expresses the threatening. He would have the parents to procure the
punishmente of their rebellious children, and to bring them before the judges.
Forasmuch as there is such natural light, such commandments, such promises
and threatenings, and such condemnation, it is not Exo. 21. 17. Deuteronomy. 21. 12
therefore with out cause that the wise man complains or wondereth at this,
that in all ages there are so many disobedient children unto their fathers and
mothers, not only ignorantly or carelessly, contemning their commandments, but
also of set malice resisting the^ with wrongs and injuries: as the wise man
does signify by the curse that he repeateth, when he is not satisfied in
saying, Curses his father, but adds, and does not bless his mother, as it
is the manner of the Scripture, to rehearse one very thing under diverse words.
Orels we may say that the wise man makes here an argument of consequence,
from the greater to the lesser: as if he said forasmuch as there is a
generation of children, so corrupted, that they forbear not to curse their
fathers and mothers, which are the heads and lords of the house, it follows
well that they make no account to do any good unto their mothers, who are
inferiors to their fathers. For it is also the custom of wicked children,
that though verily they seem to fear and honor their fathers, least they
should be beaten or driven out of the doors, or dishinherited: yet will they
boldly show, that they greatly despise their mother, and labor to persuade
themselves, that they need not to make any account of them, because they are
women, and have no power nor authority to deprive them of their portion of the
goods. Wherein there is great pride and great unthankfulness: for seeing God
has given the^ this honor to be mothers, the children ought to be subject
unto them in all humbleness and obedience. And since they have Job. 4. 4. Eccle.
7. 24
suffered so much pains in bearing them in their wombes, and have suffered so
great sorrows in bringing them forth, and have so much care to nurse them and
to bring them up, they should be ready and diligent to do them good again.
The which the wise man does teach them to do, when he complains, they
bless not their mothers. And forasmuch as it happens most often that those
children which have been wantonly brought up, are the soonest ready to curse
their fathers, and to grieve and trouble their mothers, the fathers and mothers
ought to learn that they are here taught too nurse and bring up their
children in instruction and doctrine of the Lord. And when also it is said,
Thou shall not speak evil of the judges of thy people, etc. princes are taught
to be careful too keep Exo. 22. 28.
their subjects under.

12 There is a generation that are pure in their own conceit, and yet are not
washed from their filthynesse.
He complains of a vice that has reigned of long time, and wrought much
evil: that is, that in place that we should be displeased with our filthinesses,
we have praised and esteemed them, as if we were very pure and clean, and
that there were in us nothing to be blamed. Cain had the like estimation of
himself, when he said, My punishment is greater then I can bear. The people
in the time of Noe, the messenger of righteousness, which had no repentance,
have Genesis 4. 13
well showed they were clean in their own eyes: even so have those of Sodom
done likewise in the time of righteous Lot, which would not receive any
exhortations: and the Jews, which would not hear the preaching of the
Prophets, who rebuked the^ in the name Genesis 19. 7
of the Lord: as they are often reproched for it: and the Scribes and Pharisees
in the time of our Savior Jesus Christ, who bragged of their righteousness,
and mocked our Lord, and blasphemed both him and his doctrine.

Now that these people have fallen into this abominable vice, and were greatly
guilty before God, the scripture does declare unto us: First ofal, when God
regarded not the offering of Cain. Secondly, Genesis 4. 5. and 13. 13.
when it is said, Now the people of Sodom were wicked and grievous sinners
against the Lord. Thirdly, what have I to do with the multitude of your
sacrifices? Cry out with open throat, Esaias. 1. 11. 58. 1.
spare not: tell my people of their transgression, etc. Fourthly ye are they,
which justify yourselues before men, but God knows your Luke. 16. 15 Mat.
23. 25.
hearts, etc. Because of such hypocrisy, which was incorrigible, great plagues
followed. The world was destroyed by the flood: Sodom and her neighbors were
overthrown with fire and brimstone: The Jews were destroyed by wars, and
the remnant carried away captive to Babylon. And after the resurrection of our
Lord they were Mat. 23. 35. and 24. 15. Luke 18. 11 13. Job. 14. 4. and 15.
14. 15. 16 and 25. 4. 5. 9.
brought into great desolation, as he had foretold, as we also see it. And
thus it is not without cause that the wise man complains thereof. In this he
admonisherh us that we should not brag of our pureness, as did the Pharisees: but
that we should humble ourselves, with the Publican: and that with Job we
should confess there is none that is borne of an unclean seed, that can be
made clean. What is man that he should be clean? and who is he that is borne
of woman, that can be declared righteous? And how may a man be justified with
God? or ho we can he be clean, that is borne of a woman. Forasmuch then as
we can not wash ourselves from our 1. John. 1. 8. 9
filthiness, let us not therefore be so glorious, as that we should think
ourselves to be pure and clean: for if we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just for to pardon our sins, and to cleanse us from al iniquity.
Let us then be ashamed of our sins, but not to confess them, saying with
Esaias, We are all as filthiness, and all our righteousness is as a polluted
clothe, etc: and with Saint Paul, Esaias. 64. 6. Romans 7. 14. Psalm. 51. 3. Psalm.
51. 1.
we are carnal, sold under sin. And in confessing them, let us pray with
David, Have mercy upon me OGOD after thy great goodness, and according unto
the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine offenses, etc. When we shall do thus
in good conscience, God will accomplish his promise unto us, that he has made
us, to wit, that he will power clean water upon us, and we shall be clean, etc.
Eze. 36. 25.
And albeit that of ourselves we are not clean, (for sin dwells
continually in us, and have need daily to ask pard on for our sins and
offenses) yet if we truly humble ourselves, as has been said, God will accept
us for just and clean, having sprinkeled our consciences with the precious
blood of his Son. And in this sort we shall not be clean in our own eyes,
and yet we shall be washed from our filthinesses, by the grace and mercy of our
heavenly father, who will impute unto us the righteousness of his son: whom
1. Cor. 1. 30.
he has appointed to be our righteousness, sanctification and redemption.
We must therefore with all humility confess Jesus Christ to be such, least we
be presumptuous, and puffed up with our own righteousness and holiness, as
Simon: but let us prostrate ourselves at his feet, as did Marie Magdalen. Thus
doing, we shall condemn ourselves, and shall not be condemned, but shall obtain
remission of Luke 7. 37. 39
our sins, though they be never so many. Contrarily, if we think there be
any cleanness in ourselves, God will blind us, and give us up unto a reprobate
sense: as he has already done the Jews and Luke 17. 10
the Papists. In place then of justifying ourselves, yea, though we had done
whatsoever God commands us: yet let us say (as Jesus Christ has taught us)
We are but unprofitable servants, etc.

13 There is a generation, whose eyes are hautie, and their eyeliddes are
lifted up.
In the former sentence he has reproved the hypocrites, making a great
complaint against them: and now he deals with the proud. And albeit that
pride rules in the deepenesse of the heart, yet spares he not to judge
thereof, marking it by the external and outward signs, which come from the
disposition and inclination of the heart. Neither must we marvel though he
deal with the proud, framing a complaint and accusation against them: seeing
that man of himself is nothing: for God made him, and not he himself. And
although he be created according to the image and likeness of his Creator,
nevertheless he is made of the dust of the earth: and it is Genesis 2. 7. and 3,
19.
said, that he is dust, and shall return to dust again. And as he is nothing
of himself, even so also has he nothing of himself: so that we may well say
unto the proud, Whereof comes it that earth and dust is proud: and What have
thou, that thou Eccle. 10. 1^ 1. Cor. 4. 7.
have not received? and if thou have received it, why do thou boast as
though thou had not received it? For the proud have always delighted in
themselves, and boasted of their wisdom, power, counsel, credit, authority,
antiquity, nobility, experience, and riches, as if they had al these things
in themselves: and have not confessed that God holds al in his hand, and
gives being, to who^ soever he pleases. He teaches, strengthens, exalts,
makes noble, raises up, and inricheth whom he will. And as has been said,
the proud neither can nor will in any wise confess this same: and therefore it
is no wonder though the wise man complains of the^. And as we have said, he
notes their pride by the outward signs, as we may see in other places, as the
scripture shows, in threatening Psalm. 18. 28. Pro. 6. 17 Esai. 2. 11 and 5. 15
Psalm. 131. 1.
the proud. And because there is none of sound judgment, but fears to be
hated of God, and to be beaten down with his mighty hand, we must humble our
eyes, even by the guiding of the heart: so that we may protest with David,
Lord, I am not high minded: I have no proud looks, etc.

14 There is a generation, whose teethe are as swoordes, and their jaws as
knives, to eat up the afflicted out of the earth, and the poor from among
men.
He reprooueth now the cruelty of the great men of the earth, which has
continually reigned: as we may see it in Caine, and in Genesis 4. 8. 23 and 6. 4.
Exo. 1. 8 1. Sam. 18 Psalm. 14. 4 and 57. 5. Miche. 3. 1.
Lamech, and in the mighty Giantes, which filled the earth with cruelties: in
Pharao, and in his people: In Saul, who persecuted David: as we may see by the
complaints that are contained in the holy scriptures. Now I have expressly
said, that the wise man touches the cruelty of the great men of the earth,
which are in diverse sorts: for some are great in riches, some are great in
credit and authority, some in power, and other in multitude of friends. The
which also the wise man shows, when he says, That their teeth and their
jaws do serve them as knives and swords, to eat up the afflicted out of the
earth, and the poor from among men: and herein he shows that the Proverb is
true, which says, the great eat the small. And also commonly we see that the
great will not quarrel with their equals, but with them that are feeble and
weak, and which have no blood (as it is said) in their nails, to be revenged,
(that is to say) which can not scratch and have none to support them, but
rather are vexed on al sides, and know not to whom among men they may go to
have refuge. Wherein there is great cruelty, as the wise man has noted, when
he compares them unto wild and cruel beasts, which have teeth and jaws
meet to devour the pray: and when he compares them unto thieves, and
murderers, which use knyues and swords to kill the passengers, and such as
they bear malice to. And albeit that in exercising their cruelty, they show
themselves bold and valiant, yet are they villains and cowardes: as the wise
man marketh, when he says not, that it is to fight against them which are
mighty, well armed, and of a stout stomach, but for to eat up them which are
of no resistaunce; and are altogether naked and destitute of al force and
power, so that they can not defend themselves, from the violences of the
unmerciful and cruel. And thus, it is not without cause that the wise man
complains thereof. And herein, he exhorts that if we have any greatness
and power, that we should have pity and compassion of the afflicted, and such
as are poor.

15 The Horseleach has two daughters, which cry, give, give. There be three
things that will not be satisfied: yea four, that say not, it is enough: 16
The grave, and the barren womb, the earth that cannot be satisfied with water,
and the fire that says not, it is enough.
If in these two sentences we understand nothing but that which is offered at
the first sight by the letter, they shall serve us to no instruction. And if the
wise man would teach us none other thing by them, then as the words do
sound, he has set down no excellent thing in them, nor that is worthy of
admiration. The which we neither ought to think nor to say. And therefore, it
is necessary for us to understand that the wise man speaks here in
parables and by comparison: and does greatly touch thieves and robbers, the
covetous and usurers, the spoylers and extortioners, the whoremongers and
adulterers, the gluttons and drunkards: and al such as suffer themselves to be
carried away of their unbridled concupiscences. He calls them first of all
horseleaches: the which has her tongue forked, as it is said, and with these
two forkes, which the wise man calls two daughters, she sucketh man's blood,
and will not leave the skin, til she be full, eue^ ready to burst. Even so also
these people are not easy to be pleased, but having two daughters, that is to
say, diverse ways and means to hurt, and to oppress their neighbors, and to
vex themselves, they cease not to desire more and more to follow their lusts.
The which the wise man signifies, when he is not contented to have said
once, give, but does repeat it, saying,

Give, give, Wherein he shows an insatiable covetousness in such people:
and therewith also he calls, the pollings, extortions, exactions, spoylings,
whoredoms, delights, voluptuousness and excess gifts: not so that
whatsoever they obtain is given them with a free and liberal mind: but
forasmuch as although that they exact and constrain, or use craft and
subtlety to get what they desire, yet do they not spare to use this language,
give, give: and also that which they take, and that which they use does cost
them nothing but the taking. Secondly, he compares them unto four things.
And for to do this, he uses repetition: for not to be full, or not satisfied,
and not to say, it is enough: is al one thing. He uses also Correction: for
having affirmed but of three things, afterward he affirms of four. And
this is for to prick so much the more the insatiable desires of those which
have no care but to serve their flesh.

The first is, the grave, which for the sin of man, the more bodies either
great, mean, or small that are given too it, yet does it refuse none, but
does consume them al, and bring them al to dust, as an executioner of the
sentence of God, In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat thy bread, till thou
returnest to the earth again, Gene. 3. 19.
etc.

The second is, The baren womb: the which though it be so restrained, and as
it were closed up, that it can conceive no children, yet does it not cease
continually to desire seed: as we may see by Rachel, the wife of Jacob. The
third is, The earth that cannot be Genesis 30. 1.
satisfied with water, and yet is not watered with the rain from above,
neither with fountains or rivers for to be moistened: or we shall take the
earth that is not satisfied with water, for the same that is so cleft and so
dry, that albeeit, it is thoroughly wette with water, yet it cease not still to
want, and to receive thereof so much as comes and falls: as we may see in
sandy ground. The fourth is, the fire, that consumes whatsoever is cast into
it, how strong and hard soever it be. When the wise man compares the carnal
and sensual, the dissolute and thriftles, the unmerciful and cruel, unto these
foresaid things, he blames not the said things: for they follow nothing but
the nature given to them of God. But as has been said, he pricketh men which
are corrupted and not contented to follow the good nature wherein God has
created them at the beginning, but do usurp the nature of those things which
have no reason, and do so abuse them, that that which ought in no wise to be
blamed in those creatures, yet is it very detestable and abominable when men
follow it: as there is none of us, but does so judge of it. To make an
Allegory otherwise, it should be unprofitable: as al men of good sense may
judge it. But let us learn to be modest, temperate and sober, being contented
with that which God gives us, without abusing the natural kind of the
foresaid creatures: otherwise they shall be our judges.

17 The eye that mocketh his father, and despises the instruction of his
mother, let the ravens of the river pick it out, and the young Egles eat it.
It is a thing contrary unto nature (as has been handled heretofore in the
11. ver.) that children should be rebellious and injurious to their fathers and
mothers: as also it is against the commandment and threatening of God. And so
it cannot be, but that the children being of full age, and years of
discretion, must needs sin against their consciences, and of set malice, when
they do injury and wrong unto their fathers and mothers: or also when with an
envious and malicious arrogancy, they mock at them, and despise to hear
their admonitio^s: it is a thing very wicked, detestable, shameful, and highly
monstrous. For this cause the wise man fears not to pray or desire that
such children might be forsaken and given to be spoiled, as they do well
deserve. The which desire he expresses, saying,

Let the Ravens of the river, etc. Wherein we have to note, that the Ravens
and Eagles do fly and follow aftercarion and dead bodies: and because they are
often times cast into the rivers, the which does often cast them up again
upon the shore, the Ravens and Eagles resort thither for their food, and
chiefly pecke out the eyes, as we may see it by experience: and then as they
have need, they eat the rest of the dead body. And thus the wise man
compares the mocking and contemning children unto carions, which are cast out
unto the devouring birds, and desire to have them eaten. And herein he
desires nothing of his own mind, but according to the threatening that God
makes against the rebels, which care not to obey his word. And because we see
in the gesture and Deuteronomy. 28. 26 Ier. 16. 4. and 34. 20.
moving of the eyes, the mocking and despising that lies hid within the
heart, for this cause the wise man does not speak but of the eye: and thereby
he signifies all the malice of man, yea, wholly a malicious man, who is nothing
but a carrion, worthy to be cast Mat. 13. 4. 19. 1. Pet. 5. 8.
out, not only unto the birds of the air and beasts of the earth, but to
the Devil also, that is the bird that eats that, which is sown by the high
ways side, who is also, the roaring Lion. We might also say, that this is a
threatening against wicked children, unthankful and contemners of so great
pains that their fathers and mothers have taken for them: by the which he
denounces unto them, that not only they shall be prevented with sodeine death,
but also that they shall be cruelly and shamefully slain, and cast to be
devoured by the beasts, which they have exceeded in cruelty: and shall be left
unburied. And because he makes mention of the instruction of the mother,
therefore children are exhorted in fear and reverence to receive and obey the
commandments of their mothers: though they be women, and that after the sense
of the mockers and scoffers, they ought not to regard their words. Moreover,
when instruction is attributed unto the mothers, women shall not be excused for
the weakness of their kind, for having learned nothing to teach their
children.

18 There be three things hid from me, yea four, that I know not. 19 The
way of an Eagle in the air, the way of a Serpent upon a stone, the way of a
ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid. 20 Such is the
way also of an adulterous wcman: she eats and wipeth her mouth, and says, I
have not committed iniquity.
Albeit that adultery is a very horrible and detestable sin before Gene. 2.
24. Gene. 6. and 7. Exo. 20. 14. Leui. 20. 10. Deuteronomy. 22. 22.
God: as he showed at the first, when he ordained marriage, and that he has not
said, that three or four, or more, shall be one flesh, but, man shall forsake
father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one
flesh. Secondly, when he sent the flood upon those which had taken the
daughters of men for their wives. Thirdly, when he says, Thou shall not
commit adultery. Fourthly, when he commands adulterers to be destroyed: yet
nevertheless, when there have so many adulteries been committed of long time,
and that are still daily committed, it is showed, there is no great account made
of such filthiness: and that as it were in despite of God, they are
delighted in that which he greatly abhors. Wherein the men and women that
are such, do show themselves impudent and shameless. And as they have not
God before their eyes, and persuade themselves he sees them not, even so will
they not acknowledge their iniquity: and think that they cannot be reproved.
For as they persuade themselves that they do none iniquity, even so they make
themselves believe that their trade and ways can not be seen: and therefore
dare they present themselves before the world without shame, as if they were
honestmen, ready, boldly to prove them liars, which would blame them, as they
are worthy thereof. The wise man in this present parable, does declare unto
us this impudency. And is as much as if he said, Even as men can not know
the way of an Eagle in the air, etc: neither the signs and tokens of the
pollutions of a man with a maid: and the secret inticementes that the man
uses to make the virgin consent unto him, with whom he burns in
concupiscence, by the which allurements man is defiled, though he has not once
touched the virgin: even the adulterers eat, that is to say, delight in their
whoredoms. And then, as gluttons and drunken servants, when in the absence of
their masters, have spent the time in eating and drinking, if they feel and
perceive their masters to draw near, do wipe their mouths, to seem that
they have neither drunk nor eat: even so the adulterers, after having
committed whooredome, do wipe their mouths: they counterfeit and dissemble to
be honest men, and they think they are not known, and that they can not be
convinced and overcome, and their ways to be as sealed letters. And therefore
as if they were pure and clean, holy and righteous, they boldly say, they
have done none evil: yea, and though Htb. 13. 4.
they be taken in the deed doing, yet would they have men to think that such
abomination were natural things, and not to be regarded: the which is as much
as if they said, that they are not guilty. But at the last they shall feel,
that, that which they eat is bitter. For God will condemn whoremongers and
adulterers.

21 For three things the earth is moved: yea, for four it can not sustain
it self. 22 For a servant when he reigns, and a fool when he is filled
with meat, 23 For the hateful woman, when she is married, and for a handmayde
that is heir to hermaistresse.
It is amost certain thing that the earth remoueth neither higher nor lower,
neither on the right side, nor on the left side, but remains steadfast in his
place, that God has ordained for it, except he himself do remove and shake
it. Now that it remains sure, the scripture does witness it, And therefore,
when it is said, The Job. 9. 5. 6. Psa. 18. 8. 1. Chro. 16. 30. Psa. 93. 1.
earth is moved, we will not take it for this earthly Element, but for the
^^habitants thereof, as it is so taken in diverse places of the scripture. And
also the word that is translated, moved, in the wise man's tongue, does not
signify the remoouing of one place unto an other, but to tremble, to be
angry, and to be stirred up, and troubled Eccle. 1. 4. 1. Sam. 27. 0. Esai.
11. 4. 9.
for fear or for wrath. And so as touching the 21. verse, the wise man
means, that by the world the inhabitants of the earth are troubled,
grieved, sorrowful, fearful, and angry, for the coming of four things: and
that also they can not hold, but be in fear, or to be angry, it is not for
us to teach these things: for the troubles and vexations that happen, are but
too much known, when the vile and abiectes are exalted, when the foolish and
wicked are made rich, when riotous women are maistresses in the house, and
when maids become dames. Now forasmuch as we desire not to be troubled with
such things, let us know, that the wise man does admonish us here, that
we should be careful to look narrowly and straighly what persons we ought to
prefer and exalt. And as we desire not to be troubled, even so, when we are
exalted to an higher degree, let us not trouble any man by our pride, malice,
rigor and chorlishnesse: as do they commonly which are exalted from a low
and miserable state. In the which number the wise man does first of al set the
servant and slave, saying, that when such a person comes to be raised up to
honor, and power, he is so proud and high minded, so churlishe and sharp,
so unmerciful and cruel, that none can continue with him. And whatsoever is
said of the servant, we must also understand it of every vile man, and abject
person, who has not the fear of God, and is not contented with his state,
wherein God has placed him. In the which order we may set Saul, who was of the
lowest trybes and of the least family 1. Sam. 9. 21. and 15. 17.
of Benjamin. I say expressly of the servant, who has not the fear of God: for
Joseph indeed was a servant in Egypt, but the people were moved neither with
fear, nor with anger, when he was exalted, and ruled the country. David was a
shepherd in the house of his Father, and when he had obtained the kingdom, he
wrought no trouble nor sorrow to the people.

Secondly he places A fool when he is filled with meat, that is to say, the
wicked fool, that feels himself rich and at his ease, of set purpose does
despise his neighbors, and desires more to hurt them, then to help them: as
did Pharao King of Egypt: Nabal, the Carmelite and others. 1. Sam. 25.


Thirdly, the hateful woman, who is of so strange and troublesome manners, and
of so unmerciful and cruel conversation, that she Genesis 39. 1. King. 16. 31. and
18. Mat. 14.
is feared, or rather that men are compelled to hate her, as she deserves. In
the which number, we might also set the wife of Joseph's master: Iezabel,
Achabs wife, through whom the land of Israel was moved, and provoked: Then
Herodias. Fourthly, he sets, A handmayde, who of her self is miserable,
when she comes to succeed her maistresse, when from a vile and low degree
she is raised up to honor, from riches to poverty, from labor and pain, to
rest and pleasures. Most commonly such handmaydes keep no modesty nor
humility, but are so arrogant and proud, so churlishe and sharp, that no man
can abide them. To the end therefore that we stir not, nor move the earth,
let us be careful to behave ourselves lowly and gently, though we be exalted
and lifted up.

24 There be four small things in the earth, yet they are wise, and full of
wisdom: 25 The Pismyres, a people not strong, yet prepare they their meat in
summer: 26 The Conies, a people not mighty, yet make they their houses in the
Rock: 27 The Grasshopper has no King, yet go they forth al by bands: 28 The
Spider takes hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.
The wise man continues still to teach us by parables, setting forth unto us,
four of the least and smallest beasts of the earth, to be our teachers and
guides, that we should learn instruction of them. And to the end, that
although it ought to shame us, that we must be taught by such little beasts,
yet that we should not refuse their instruction, he does attribute wisdom
unto them: and least we should despise this wisdom, he shows that it is not
feigned by them, when he says,

Yet are they wise, and full of wisdom. Whereupon follows that it is God, who
has created them in a wise nature, the which they have not lost, nor yet
forsaken, as man has done, abolishing by his transgression and rebellion, the
image and likeness of God, wherein he was created: And is so spoiled of
wisdom, and become so ignorant, dull, and blockish, that the least beasts,
must teach him his lesson, and show him, how he must govern himself. Now
albeit we should be ashamed thereof, yet should we thank God, who by such
Doctors, helps our rudeness and weakness, and makes that profitable unto
us, which at the first sight, offers it self before our eyes, and in our
fantasy, to be vile and contemptible, and as a thing of no price nor
estimation. And also the wise man does call them, The small things of the
earth. Wherein again we should have shame: for we should be wholly occupied to
consider spiritual and heavenly things, for to be preserved in wisdom, to
know to govern ourselves, and to spend the time as we ought, in woorking
diligently and courageously, without dout or fear, and should not suffer our
weakness to make us slouthful and negligent, or our highness to turn us
away from our office and duty: and we must look down to the earth, and
toward low, small, weak, and contemptible things for to be taught of the^.
Wherein we may know that we have nothing to brag ourselves of, nor to
challenge any excellency.

Notwithstanding, we are so pleased with ourselves, that either we can not, or
we will not, take heed from esteeming ourselves, if we feel and perceive in
ourselves any strength and power, any cunning or aptness. On the other side,
we love so much the ease, delights and rest of our flesh, that we make
ourselves believe we are weak, and should mar ourselves if we should
labor: or by distrust and fear, give ourselves over to the government of
those whom we esteem mighty: no man dare come near unto the great Lords,
least they should displease them, though with them he might employ himself to
do what God commands him. It is the custom of those which will do nothing,
to allege they are feeble and weak, to be excused and borne with, and that
they might eat their bread in idleness and without doing any thing. But the
wise man will receive no such excuses, as he does plainly show, when he
brings forth the Pismyre, and declares that it is a people, that has no
strength, and that yet they labor in summer, which is the appointed season to
gather and to lay up victuals in store. And Pro. 6. 6.
this is that which Solomon shows unto the slouthful. And therein he shows
that we must in the appointed time and season, apply ourselves after the power
and wisdom that God has given us: and that in so doing there shall be no
season so sharp, wherein we shall not obtain, whatsoever shall be necessary for
us. For to provoke us the more to take pain, and not to fly back for our
weakness, and that we should labor to follow our vocation, and to persevere
therein, he sets before us the Conies, which are without strength, and have
no resistance, but fly and sodeinly run away at the barking of the least
whelpe that is: and yet notwithstanding are so continually in scraping, that
they will atchiue to pearce even the very hard rock, for to make themselves
lodging and to hide themselves therein. The rocks (says David) are a refuge
for the conies. Psa. 104. 18 Mat. 16. 18 1. Cor. 10. 4.
Therefore let not our feebleness make us cowardes: Let every one of us
occupy himself after his capacity and ability, taking the rock, which is
Jesus Christ for his refuge. And in this sort we shall be in great safety. And
to the end, that we should not look for the protection and sauegarde of the
great lords and mighty of the earth: or if we be destitute of their guiding
and government Let us not be discouraged, as were the Jews. In the third
place he 1. Sam. 8. 5
sets before us, the Grasshoppers, saying, they have no king, yet are they
strong, and are guided valiantly, as people expert in the wars: as he
expresses, saying, they go forth al by bands: that is to say, they assemble
and gather together a great multitude and by heaps: as those which God sent
into Egypt. And also the holy scripture, for to signify a great power,
speaks so of grasshoppers. Though we be destitute of temporal protection,
yet let us not Exo. 10. 12. Iud. 6. 5. and 7. 12.
leave of to bear ourselves valiantly, knitting ourselves together by faith,
being assured, that we have the king of kings for our protector and
governor, who will not forsake us, but will give us weapons to resist the
infernal and hellishe powers. And therefore, what evil soever the world or
the Devil do invent against us, let us not be discouraged, but let us follow
Saint Paul's admonition, Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to
stand against the assaults of the Devil. And because Ephe. 6. 11.
the greatness and authority of men, is often cause that the small and weak
dare not do that which belongs to their office, the wise man, fourthly
sets before us, the Spider, that is very weak, yet does she not fear to
haunt the Palaces of Kings, and there to spinne her web, crossing and
traversing, and one while taking one side, and an other while an other, for to
spread her web, and to make it so long as ever she can. Even so, let no
highness of Princes, turn us away from doing our duty, and that we should
not largely do whatsoever belongs unto our office. According to some men's
judgment, by the Pismire that labors willingly, and without constraint, men
are rebuked for that they will not labor but by compulsion: By the conies, they
are reproved for their overmuch boldness: By the Grasshoppers, which fly
keeping their orders, they are rebuked that though they have kings, princes,
and magistrates, yet do they not obey them, but would rule over other. By the
Spider in kings palaces, we have an example of labor: and signifies that
they that rule the common wealth, ought above al things to be vigilant and
careful.

29 There be three things that order well their going: yea, four are comely in
going. 30 A Lion which is strong among beasts, and turns not at the sight of
any, 31 A lusty grayhounde, and a goat, and a king, against whom there is no
rising up.
When a man walks blameless in his manners and conversation, and applies
diligently himself to do his office, we say he goes right: and if he do the
contrary, we say he goes astray, and that he walks not in the right pathe:
and so we call the life of man, a pathe, a step, or a way. After the which
manner of speaking the scripture agrees, Gene. 5. 22. and 6. 9. 12.
for to be the more familiar unto us: as it is said, that Enock walked with
God: and Noe was perfect in his time, walking with God: and al flesh had
corrupted his way upon earth. And because that albeit that God often does
admonish us by his word to walk honestly, yet do we make no account
thereof, and will not acknowledge what our duty is. For this cause to rebuke
our negligence, or rather our malice, God sets beasts before us, declaring
unto us that they are of a better nature then we be, and that they know well
how to do their duty: as we see in Esai the first Chapter, and second verse,
and in diverse places of these Proverbs: and now the wise man sets before
us three. And when such rebukes are given us, they are not to confound us, but
to make us better advised and more discreet, and also to be ashamed of that,
that we must go to the school with the beasts. The first of the three is,
The Lion, which is strong among beasts, not only in his members, but also of
courage, and by the same his courage he walks fiercely in his way: and there
is no beast how strong or great soever he be, that may turn him or make him
go out of his way: and so he orders very well his steps, and walks
comely. The wise man does not set before us the cruelty of the Lion: for if
we did follow him therein, we should be like unto the Devil: but he 1. Pet. 5.
8.
would have us to follow the courage, the boldness and nimblenesse of the Lion,
to the intent that whatsoever the Devil or men can do against us, yet should
we always go boldly forwards, as God does teach us by his word, and
should in no wise be afraid. Herein it is, that we should be like the Lion, as
Solomon does show us. By the second, that is, the Greyhounde that is lusty to
run, he does admonish us, that we should not be like unto the Snaile, Pro.
28. 1.
that creeps very softly, but should be ready and diligent to run our
course: as we are exhorted in other places of the scriptures, Psalm. 119. 32 1.
Cor 9. 24 Heb. 12. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 7.
that we may truly say, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith. And for to do this well, we must take heed from
following of hungry Dogs. For if we be gorbellies, gluttons and drunkardes, we
can not be swift to run our course, but desire to be at rest: as the Prophet
Esai, in the 56. Chapter 10. 11. blames the rulers of Israel. And therefore
Jesus Christ does exhort us saying, Take heed to yourselues, that your
hearts be not overcome with surfeiting and drunkenness, etc. Even so must
Luke 21. 34
we take heed from following their envy, but that rather we should be joyful
for the prosperity of our neighbors, and sorry for their misery: let us not
be like unto Semei: nor like unto the multitude of people which mocked at the
affliction of our Lord: who are called 2. Sam. 16. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Mat. 27. 29.
40. Psalm. 22. 17
Dogs. By the third, that is the Goat, which by a natural care and boldness
that he has, feeling himself armed with strong horns, does walk before the
flock, when they are led to pasture, we are admonished, that for to walk
rightly, we must be an example unto our neighbors, and to labor to go
before them by honest and holy conversation, that they may follow us. This
belongs unto al Christians, and chiefly unto those which have any government
either spiritual or temporal: but we must beware that we stincke not as Goats
do, least we be placed at the left hand. The fourth Mat. 25. 33.
thing, whereby we are here admonished to order our manners and conversation
right, is not a beast, but a man, not vile nor abject, but one that is in
authority, and has power over other, and is ruled with such wisdom,
gravity and severity, that he is obeyed, without any resistance or
rebellion. For although before the world we are not al Kings, and that it is
not lawful for us to usurp to ourselves the Kingly authority, yet, forasmuch
as we have al naturally royal hearts (for we would be content that al men
were subject unto us, and we subject to no man) it is therefore good reason
that we should order our steps as wise, severe and grave Kings, that we
might so rule and reign over our lusts, and our sins, that they should
have no reign nor rule in us, as Saint Paul does admonish us in diverse places.

And also, if we be Christians, we are Kings. And in this, that we are
Kings, it is not to reign worldly. For our kingdom Romans 6. 12. Exo. 19. 6.
Apo. 1. 6. Iam. 4. 1. 2.
is not of this world, but is spiritual: the which if we will quietly possess,
we must tame and subdue our lusts. After some we may say, that this parable
shows, what the Prince ought to be, to wit, like unto the Lion, to the
Greyhound and to the Goat: that he may be feared of the wicked, and loved
and honored of the good.

For the Lion uses no cruelty, except he be provoked: and holds in his
nails so fast as does the catte, and never displayeth and vnclaspeth the^ but
only in the fight. Even so should princes never exercise their wrath and
displeasure, nor take weapon in hand but upon necessity. The Greyhound does
not persecute his guestes, but only the wild beasts: the Goat goes before
the flock as a keeper: Even so the Prince ought by good laws to rule his
flock and to preserve it. If the princes do thus govern themselves, no man
will rise up or rebel against them. For they have GOD for their keeper, and
defender against rebels and seditious subjects.

32 If thou have been foolish in lifting thy self up, and if thou have
thought wickedly, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
Of our vicious and corrupted nature, we are all senseles, and do delight in
our malicious foolishnes, and do think we are something and are ready
through pride and arrogancy to exalte ourselves above or against our
neighbors, and which worse is, against God. And being thus senseles, we can
not so much as think a good thought, but all evil. Therefore when the wise man
speaks conditionally, Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21.


If thou have. etc. We may resolve his words casually, in saying, forasmuch
as thou have been folish. etc. When he so speaks, he teaches us, that
although we of ourselves are nothing worth within, yet ought we to take heed
to be defiled in our conversation. And therefore let us understand, that he
does exhort closely to labor to refourme our thoughts, desires, purposes,
counsels, affections and lusts. For otherwise we cannot have a quiet and
modest conversation: the which he signifies, By laying the hand on the mouth.
Mow he makes mention of the hand, and the mouth, because by those members we
show and exercise foolishnes, arrogancy and malice which is within: with the
hand we make signs of iniquity, we steal, we use shameless touching and
feeling, and do violence, in fighting, killing, and sleying. And for this
cause the scripture reprocheth that they have stretched out their hands unto
theuery and Esai. 1.
that their hands are full of blood, and also it does exhort us to keep the^
innocent from evil. From our mouths come vain words, oaths, false oaths,
blasphemies, false witnessinges, tales, backbitinges and flatteringes:
whereupon do follow great inconveniences, and great offenses: and are ready
chiefly to misuse our mouths, and it Iam. 1. 19. and 3. 2.
is very hard for us to tame the same, and to cause it to keep silence, as
it ought: as we prove the same but too often, as also the scripture declares
it. Wherefore we must stand upon our watch, following that which David says,
I will take heed to my ways, Psa. 39. 2.
that I offend not with my tongue, etc. But forasmuch, as of ourselves it is
an impossible thing, therefore we must pray unto God that it would please him
to have care to open and shut our mouths, as Psa. 51. 17. and 141. 3.
he shall see to be expedient: as the scripture teaches us to do.

33 When one churneth milk, he brings forth butter: and he that wringeth
his nose, causes blood to come out: so he that forces wrath, brings forth
strife.
Albeit that Saint Paul says, Be angry, but sin not: yet is it not well
done at any time nor a man to be given and accustomed Ephe. 4. 26. Pro. 15. 18.
and 26. 21. and 29.
unto wrath, nor to be sodeinly angry, as Saint Paul does show it, when he
says, Let not the Sun go down on your wrath. For also from thence do
proceed debates and strifes. He that forces wrath: that is to say, which
often and sodeinly is angry, brings forth strife. The wise man compares
such a man and his fruit, unto two things, whereof the one is good, and the
other evil: that is to wit, after the nature and kind of butter, and sheading
of blood. But the same makes not the similitude fautie. For in a comparison it
is not required that all the parts should agree and be like in every point:
it suffices that there be some one point agreeable to the matter that is
handled: otherwise there should be in the Prophets and Evangelists certain
comparisons very absurd: the which we must neither think nor say. Therefore,
albeit that it is profitable to beat and churne the milk, to bring forth
butter, yet should it be very wickedly done of a man, often or sodeinely to
be angry. For as of the beating and churning of the milk, we bring forth
butter, even so, an angry man stirs up and provoke strife. And as by too
much wringing of the nose, we wipe it not, but wring and make blood to come
out, which is evil: even so also of wrath and striefes do oftentimes rise
murders.

The xxxi. Chapter.
1 THE words of king Lemuell: the prophecy which his mother taught him.
AFter the Hebrwe and Latin expositours, Solomon is called Lemuel, 2. Sam. 7.
12. 13.
that is to say, of God. For albeit that David had elder sons then Solomon,
yet was none of them ordained king but Solomon, according as God had foretold
David by the Prophet Nathan. The which was performed in Solomon. Now he 1.
Kin. 8. 20. 2. Sa. 12. 25.
calls the sentences following, his words: Because that he having heard
them of his mother, had gathered them into writing. Wherein he shows that
albeit he had been the scholar of the Prophet Nathan, yet did he not
despise the instruction of his mother, but had the same in great estimation: as
he shows when he calls it a Prophecy, that is to say, doctrine, whereby
his mother has expounded unto him the will of God, as he has declared by his
word: as it is so taken in the 1. Cor, 14. verse. 1. And thus, this mother
does well show unto the the great Dames and Ladies, and unto al mothers, that
they ought not to spend the time with the children, in talking of vain
things: but that they should have the word of God in their hearts, for to be
able to teach their children both by mouth and by example: as the Apostle
Saint Paul does show them. I say expressly too be able to teach their
children. For though women be never so 1. Tit. 5. 4. 1^ Tit. 2. 3 1. Cor. 14.
34 1. Tim. 2. 11
well learned, yet ought they not to take in hand to teach publicly as
Ministers of the Church. And albeit that we find it not writtenin any other
place, that the mother or Solomon has taught him, yet ought it to be enough
for us, that he himself does here confess it. And also it is to be
believed how David, who was a great Prophet, for to correct and amend the
fault that they had committed together during the life of Vrias her first
husband, was careful diligently to instruct Bethsabe the mother of Solomon. We
might also say that Solomon calls his mother, the Church, in the which he
had been taught by Nathan the Prophet, and by the Priests. Howsoever it be,
when Solomon gathers by writing that which had been taught him, he shows
us how greatly careful and diligent we should be to hold and lay up that
which is taught us, for to frame thereby our manners and conversation, that we
may teach our neighbors by good doctrine and holy conversation.

2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, O son of my
vow?
The mother of Solomon does well declare how much she loved, him, when she is
not satisfied with saying once, My son, but does repeat it. And in the same
repetition she declares how he is her son: that is to say, that she has
conceived him in her womb, that she did bear him with travel and pain, that
she brought him forth with sorrow, and nursed him up. And albeit that diverse
mothers do persuade themselves that their children ought to be contented
therewith, yet will not she stay there, but even as she had nursed him
corporally, even so would she also be a spiritual mother. And also there
with in remembering her womb, she shows him that he ought in no wise to
despise her, nor to refuse her holy admonitions, and that she would teach him
nothing, but that should be for his profit, and that she would not abuse
him, to work his destruction, seeing he is the fruit of her womb. But
moreover for to declare unto him her motherly affection, and how she never
forgets him, she calls him the son of her vow.

Now we often make vows for to obtain that which we greatly desire, and
esteem to be profitable, or necessary: as Jacob Genesis 28. 20. 21
does. And thus, when she says, What, son of my vow? She declares that
she never ceasseth to pray for him, and to desire his health and prosperity.
And it is as much as if she called him her well beloved son, on whom she
sets al her heart: as she did show the same indeed, 1. King. 17. When she
desires David for to erect and place Solomon in the kingdom, against Adonias.

Moreover, let us note that these words are no flattering speeches, but sweet
declaratio^s, for to draw her son unto obedience, and to teach him, what is
his duty, that he should not be unthankful nor rebellious.

3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways, which is to destroy kings.
God by Moses taught kings their lesson and what they should Deuteronomy. 17. 16 17.
do. Now David had sworn unto Bethsabe the mother of Solomon, that her son
should reign in his steed after him: for this cause she teaches her son
the same lesson: In the which GOD says that the king shall not take unto him
many wives. According to the which lesson she says unto her son, Give not
thy strength etc. That is to say, Give not thy mind to follow and delight in
many women, for to weaken thy self, both body and mind with them, and to
consume thy substance in mainteining them, and to entertain them in pleasures,
pompously, and voluptuously: as whoores do daily desire, and are as insatiable
as graves: the which is the overthrow and destruction of the rich and mighty:
as the Giants, Genesis 6. and 7 Judge. 16.
and Sampson, have proved by expreience: and now Bethsabe does declare unto
her son, when she adds, Nor thy ways, which is to destroy kings. For this
is as much as if she said: how great and mighty soever men be, yet if they be
given unto women, they seek their overthrow and destruction: the which also
fails not though it belong before it come: as David has tried it for a
certain time in the persecution of his son Absalom: as God had threatened
him. And with the same destruction is Solomon threatened. And the execution
thereof was done upon his son Roboam. We might also say, that she saying,
Give not thy ways, etc. does admonish him that by his manners and
conversation he should not give 2. Sam. 12. 10 1. Kin. 11. 11 and 12. 16
any evil example, the which would send such kings unto destruction as
should follow it, or that would more ouerpasse him: as we may see in
Roboam. After some men's judgment, this mother does exhort her son to be
well contented with the kingdom, that God has given him, and that he should
not strive to subdue the other kings, for to get their countries, and further
to enlarge his dominion. Al such exhortations are very fit and necessary to
frame the manners of kings, and they do agree very well unto the lesson that is
given them, nevertheless the most apt Deuteronomy. 17.
sense in my judgment is, that this mother does exhort her son, not to
apply himself, to any thing that might work his overthrow, when he should be
king: for the custom of the Hebrews is to use the singular for the plural,
and plural for the singular. And so it should be as if she said, give not
thy ways, while thou art a king to destroy thee.

4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for
princes strong drink.
Wine is created in differently for all men. Al creatures of God are Psa. 104.
15 1. Tim. 4. 4 Romans 14. 21.
good, and nothing is to be refused when it is received with thanks giving.
Whereupon we may know that although it is good neither to eat flesh, nor to
drink wine, yet neither the use of wine, nor of other sweet and pleasant
drinks, ought to be forbidden kings and princes of the earth: seeing also
that kings are commonly better able to furnishe themselves with delicates then
other. And therefore, let us understand that the use of wine is not here
forbidden to kings, but only the overmuch pleasure that is taken therein, and
the excess that is committed in it, though nothing else is spoken of but
drinking: for the scripture in diverse places to express Genesis 19. 31. Psalm. 69.
13. Mat. 24. 8.
intemperancie and drunkenness, does speak but of drinking. And we also in
our language, when we would express the intemperancie of some men, do say
plainly and simply they drink, or that they are drinkers. The which is much
to be blamed in all persons: for the scripture forbids excess to all men,
and depriueth al drunkardes of the kingdom of God. But mention is made here
of kings and princes for diverse causes. The first is, that this exhortation is
directed unto Solomon the son of king David, and who was ordained king after
his father: whose mother did only privily exhort him: for being a woman, she
had not the public administration. The second is, that the kings and
governors, above al other should be temperate and sober: for seeing it
belongs to them to punish excess, dissoluteness, riotousnesse and
offenses, therefore they should serve for an example unto the common people:
so that they may not be checked: Awake ye drunkardes Esaias. 1. 5. Esa. 56. 12
and 5. 11. 12.
and weep, etc. And forasmuch as they are judges, they ought so to guide
themselves: as that in judging other, they condemn not themselves: and that it
should not be reproched them and cast in their teeth, Why see thou a mote in
thy brothers eye, and considerest Mat. 7. 3
not a beam in thine own eye? The third is, that the kings and great Lords
because of their great riches do live for the most Romans 2. 1.
part carelessly and idly, and for to pass away their time joyfully and
merrily, keep good cheer, making feasts, drinkinges, bankettes, suppers, and
rear suppers, superfluous and excessive, and drink and Esaias. 28. 7. 8
eat almost til they be ready to burst and to spue, as they are blamed for it.

5 Least he drink, and forget the decree, and change the judgment of all the
children of affliction.
The mother of Solomon does not set down the former reasons: but to avoid
prolixitie and tediousness, she touches the chiefest and principal: that is,
that if kings be given to wine, there is danger that they making no account of
the law of God, should overthrow the right of the poor. Whereupon we must
first note, that which is written: When the king is placed in the throne of his
kingdom, then shall he write out for himself a book of this Deu. 17. 18. 19
law, wherein there is showed unto him, that he ought not in any wise to
turn away from the law of God, neither by contempt, nor by forgetfulness:
much less by scorning or mocking. And for to avoid these things, he ought to
take heed and beware of wine: Pro. 20. 1 Osea. 4. 11. Esaias. 28. 7 Esaias. 1. 23.
Psa. 82. 5. 6. 7
For wine is a mocker, etc. Whooredome, wine, and new wine, take away the
heart. But they also have failed by wine, and have gone astray by drunkenness.

Secondly, let us note that the great men of the earth despising the decree,
and scorning thereof, do give themselves unto corruption, as they are blamed
therewith. Whereupon God complains of them, with threatening them. And this
is that which the mother exhorts her son to do, fearing least by wine he
should change the right. And she says expressly, of all the children of
affliction: that is to say, of the miserable: for they are they whom God
commends unto us. But it seems that they would despite God, forasmuch as
it is a common thing through the world that the great do eat the small: as
experience teaches: and the scripture also complains thereof. And the same
is well noted here, when it is not simply said, The son of affliction, but
all the sons of afflictions: as if it were said that a drunken king will not be
touched nor moved with compassion toward any poor, but will be wicked,
unmerciful and cruel toward all the miserable, for to show favor unto those
that do wrong.

Thirdly, let us note that she speaks not but of the changing of the right
and judgment of the afflicted. For albeit, it is said, thou shall not respect
a poor man in his cause, yet does God chiefly commend them unto us, because
they are never maintained, but rather trodden down, and the rich and mighty
favored: even so to the end that judges should be advertised of their
office, and that having omitted and forgotten it, they might be more guilty and
worthy of greater condemnation: and in steed that they have despised to
deliver the sons of affliction, they shall be holden under affliction, from
the which they may never be delivered. Fourthly, let us note, that although the
kings have diverse magistrates and judges under them, yet ought they themselves
to watch, for to yield and to make other to give right unto whom soever it
belongs, and not to live in pleasures.

6 Give ye strong drink unto him, that is ready to perish, and wine unto
them that have grief of heart.
Wine was not only created for necessity, but also for to rejoice a man's
heart. According heeretoo the mother does admonish Psa. 104. 15
her son and all those which have the ability, to comfort the miserable and
sorroweful, in giving them either ale or wine to drink, or other pleasant
drink, according to the commodity and use of the country. Now she calls
such miserable and sorrowful, ready to perish, or perishing: not to teach us
that which some unmerciful and cruel men do teach in popery, that a man is
not bound to help his neighbor, but in extreme necessity. For she calls them
not perishing or ready to perish, which are past help, as are they which are
in extreme necessity but those which have sorrowful hearts: as she herself
does expound it, when she commands wine to be given to them which have
grief of heart.

For except we care to help them, they tend unto perdition. A sorrowful
spirit dries the bones. Wherein we may see she Pro. 17. 22.
has not forbidden kings and princes the use of wine, but the excess and
curiousnes of drinking the finest and most excellent: for it may happen to
kings, to be ready to perish, and to have grief and sorrow of heart.

7 That he may drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
She declares to what end we ought to tend in giving strong drink or wine
unto the miserable and grieved: to wit, to make them merry, so that they may
feel their misery no more, to be tormented still. Wherein she shows that we
must neither give such sorrowful persons drink too pinchingly, nor too
abundantly, but meanly and indifferently. For as in drinking too little, their
sorrow should not be driven away: even so by drinking too much, they might
forget the Law of God, the which might because afterward of greatr and more
grievous sorrow, that is to say, that forgetting Mat. 5. 17. Heb. 10. 26. Esaias.
55. 1. 1. Cor. 10. 4. Exo. 17. 6. Mat. 11. 28. John 4. 10. 14. and 6. 50. 51.
53. and 7. 37.
the Law, they could hope for no salvation, but only look for an horrible
condemnation and perpetual torments. For in dispising the Law, we despise
Jesus Christ, who is not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it. Whereupon
it follows they deserve to have greater sorrow and grief: as the threatening
pronounces. But we must stoutly withstand such grief, in drinking, not
material wine, but spiritual drink, whereto we are exhorted. And to be
partakers thereof, we must come unto Jesus Christ, who is the rock of whom our
fathers have drunk. Jesus Christ himself calls us, by declaring to us what
he is. And daily he covers the table for us, and offers us drink and
meat, by the preaching of his Gospel, and by the administration of his
Sacraments. And thus, it chiefly belongs unto the ministers of the word, to
give strong drink unto them, that are ready to perish, and wine to those
which have grief of heart. And also the scripture, Esaias. 40. 1. 1. Cor. 14. 3.
which the ministers must handle, serves fit for the same. And Saint Paul in
diverse places exhorts us to rejoice in the Lord: and would also have us one
to comfort an other. The which ought to be done in diverse sorts.

8 Open thy mouth for the dombe, in the cause of all the children of
destruction.
It seems unto kings and governors of the earth, that they do their duty
well, when having heard the pleading of both parties, they judge according as
the matters have been alleged: and yet they see some simple and ignorant man
that cannot allege his right, nor declare his cause and matter, the which of
it self is good, thus they will persuade themselves, that they have done their
duty very well, when they shall suffer their senses to be blinded by some
babbler and prater, that knows cunningly how to color his pleading, to make
his matter seem good, the which is nothing worth. Such judges and magistrates,
for to justify themselves, and to wash their hands, will say, The case and
right is open and plain to every man, we cannot judge but according as the
matters have been alleged and proved. But if in this sort the simple and
ignorant be deprived of his right, the judges are not absolved before God, who
will examine, search out and consider al points of the matter thoroughly. And
forasmuch as they are his lieftenants, they ought therefore to follow him: as
also they are taught by his word. And also it is now showed them, when it is
said, Open thy mouth, etc. For they Psa. 10. 13. 14 Deu. 1. 13. 16 17. and 25.
1. Esaias. 1. 17.
cannot open their mouths for the simple and ignorant, as they ought, without
good inquisition. For although it is said, Open thy mouth, etc. yet is it not
to say that we should, whether the malice be right or wrong, favor the simple
and weak: seeing it is said, Thou shall not regard a poor man in his cause.
And it is not Exo. 23. 3.
without cause, that they are thus admonished, seeing the world is full of
people, who by their shadows and colors do labor to darken the right of
those that are not able to revenge themselves, and therefore are called dumb.
This same is but too too much proved true: and again it is signified unto us,
when it is not said, In the cause or matter of some one son of variation and
coulouring, but of all the sons of destruction: noting the great multitude of
clokers and painters, and signifiyng that the simple are sore oppressed of al
sides, except the superiors be very diligent too make inquiry, for to be
able to open their mouths to pronounce righteous sentences, and to give right
unto the simple and weak. After this sense we set the dumb against the
children of variance, or painting. But there are some which in place of
variance, do say, of the tra^sitorie world: and othersome of destruction and
death, and other, of those which are forsaken. And in this sort there should
be no Antithesis, but it would behoue us to resolve this present sentence, as
if it were said, defend him that is not able to defend himself, susteining
their cause that go to destruction, because no man makes account of them, but
rather every man seeks their destruction: as it is none other but the custom
of the world.

9 Open thy mouth: judge righteousness, and judge the afflicted, and the
poor.
The scripture in steed of saying, judge justly, does say, judge
righteousness, or also judge after righteousness. Such words are chiefly and
most often directed unto the rulers of the earth, because it is their office to
minister righteousness and justice: and most often they care nothing for it,
but to live deliciously and voluptuously they commit the same unto such persons
which for the most part are corrupted, and do overthrow the right. And thus
in steed of opening their mouth to judge righteousness, they open their hands
to take gifts and rewards. They open their ears to hear flattering tongues
and praises of their friends: they open their eyes to behold their parents,
to look upon the rich and mighty, that they may favor them against al
right, and to the hurt and hinderance of those which have no maintenance, nor
can revenge themselves. The which is a great wrong done unto God, who so
carefully commends the poor unto us: as it has been diverse times showed us
heretofore. And therefore, the mother admonishing her son to open his mouth
to judge righteousness, or to judge justly, does declare how he shall do
the same, when he says, That he should open his mouth to judge the afflicted
and the poor: that is to say, that he should defend and maintain the cause
of him that is oppressed and lacks help, wants power and wealth: as also
all judges are exhorted there unto. If this doctrine were well printed in the
hearts of kings and rulers, the poor faithful ones, should not be so
cruelly handeled and entreated, as they be. Psalm. 82. 3.


10 Who shall find a virtuous woman? for their price is different from
pearls.
Women of their nature are very light and unconstant, and do mar al, if a
man suffer them to do what they will: as we have proved by experience in our
first mother: whose daughters the women have at al times showed themselves to
be, in following her, yea in doing worse: as amongst other we may place
Dalila, Iezabel and Herodias. And therefore it is not without cause that the
wise man, as wondering and amassed at the unprofitableness of the malice of
women, does ask, Who shall find a virtuous woman? a woman that has good
courage, and that does diligently apply herself to do her duty in the fear
of the Lord, submitting herself and pleasing her husband, and ruling her
household, in the way of holiness and righteousness, in soberness and
temperancie, with diligence and care. An husband that finds such a wife,
ought not to hate, reject or despise her, except he be out of his wit or
mad: but if the worlings do greatly delight in themselves when they have
things and jewels of great price, as silver, gold, and precious stones, and
if they esteem these things greatly, how much more ought the husband to
esteem a virtuous, and a valiant wife. For as the wise says here, For her
price is different from pearls: that is to say, far more excellent. And it
is good reason that the husband (whose wife is valiant) should not make
account of all the riches in the world, so much as of his wife. And that for
diverse causes. First of al, she is created after the image and likeness of
God. Secondly, without the woman, man was not perfect. Thirdly, she is flesh
of his flesh, and bones of his bones. Genesis 1. 27. and 2. 18. 23.
And the fourth reason, which is the chiefest, is that the woman is bought for
as great a price as is the man: to wit, with the precious blood of the Lamb
without spot. Whetevpon follows the fifth, that she is heir of the heavenly
kingdom: seeing that it is neither Gala. 3. ^8.
to male nor female: for ye are alone in Jesus Christ.

Now as touching the the state between man and wife it is this, they ought to
beecareful to walk in all modesty and gentleness one with an other: let the
wife behave herself virtuously in all subjection and obedience, that she may
compel her husband greatly to love her: and let the husband for his part, be
so gentle, and show her such love that he may give her occasion to be
virtuous: and let them in this sort edify their families, by good examples,
and cause them to live holyly,

11 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he shall have no need of
spoil.
It is very meet that the word to find, which the wise man does use in the
former sentence should contain in it self experience: for a man cannot be
contented with the wisdom of a woman, neither can he bring that he has
found a virtuous woman, except he has tried her. And also when it is sai^^,
The heart of her husband, etc. The wise shows plain that he speaks of
experience, and not of a single meeting. For a discrete husband, would not
refer al to his wife, nor rest upon her, nor commit the government of his
house unto her, nor trust in her, unless he has had good witness and
experience of her. He shows also that he speaks of a good and wise
husband, and that is modest and of a setteled mind. For a wicked, foolish,
hasty, or blockish man will make no account of his wife, how virtuous soever
she be: and so cannot trust in her: but the good husband and wise, having good
testimony of his wife, or having well tried her, will love her, and so well
esteem of her, that he will not enquire of her government, and will not fear
that he should spoil any thing, but will trust in her for all his domestical
and household affairs, and will commit them al unto her government. And that
for the love he bears unto his wife, knowing her to be virtuous according to
that which S. Paul says, Love believes al, hops al. etc, not that 1. Cor.
13. 7.
he puts his steadfast assurance of his salvation in his wife, or that he
has a certain testimony, that nothing shall perish under her hand, when also
he cannot promise that he will save himself: for Iere. 17. 5.
such a trust is cursed. And when the wise adds, and he shall have no need
of spoil, he shows moreover that he speaks of a good husband. For an evil
man will not be satisfied with the use of that which he may lawefully have,
but will by all means he can, spoil and get the goods of his neighbor, and
will never have enough in his fantasy. But the manners of the wise are without
covetousness, and is contented with present things: that is to say, with that
which he and his wife possess, win and get justly, without doing wrong, or
oppressing of any other: and being thus content he shall have no need to
spoil his neighbors: for he has enough, and wants no riches: the which
are signified by the spoils, because that the riches of a family are made a
spoil and a pray to the enemies in the time of war. Besides this same, let
us note that men which take young maids in marriage (forasmuch as the marriage
according to the ordinance of God is a band not to be broken) are here
closely admonished to love them, not for their corporal beauty, nor for their
riches, but to love them in God: in such wise that knowing that young maidens
are not commonly wise, they should be careful and diligent to teach them,
and to take pains to make them virtuous wives, otherwise their hearts could
not trust in them. On the other side the wives are taught to become and yield
themselves to learn and to be gentle, humble and obedient, 1. Cor. 14. 34 1.
Tim. 2. 1. 1. Pet. 3. 1. Ephe. 5. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 8.
that they may win the hearts of their husbands, and that they give them
not occasion to judge evil of them, nor to distrust them. This doctrine may
also be gathered out of the writings of S. Paul and S. Peter.

12 She will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life.
He shows that the good husband shall not be deceived in trusting in his
virtuous wife, and shall not be frustrate of his hope, that is, that his wife
will not waste the goods of the house, but will duly and orderly spend the^, and
will rather labor to augment and increase them, then to diminish them. For as
he says, She will do him good: that is to say, she takes pains to increase
the riches of her husband, and of her labor comes profit to the house. And
she does no evil, that is to say, she does him no hurt, nor works him no
trouble. And when she has thus begun, she ceasseth not, but continues all the days of her life. Wherein al wives are admonished never to cease from well
doing unto their husbands: otherwise they are rebels, not only against men,
but also against God, who has given the woman to man for his benefit, and to
be an helper unto him, not for a day or a year, but for ever: for God Genesis 2.
18. 24 Mat. 19. 5. 6.
says, It is not good that man should live alone: I will make him an helper.
And also has joined them unseparably together. The wives ought therefore to
continue in well doing unto their husbands, and to work them no trouble. And
for to do this well, they must be humble and patient, modest and prudent for to
win their husbands, if they be chourlish and sharp: and for to nourse and
cherishe them, if they be gentle and gracious. And thus by well doing they shall
overcome the evil with goodness, and shall maintein goodness.

13 She seeks wool and flax, and labors cheerfully with her hand.
He begins to declare how the wife for to show herself virtuous, yields
and does good unto her husband. She is not idle, nor negligent, she is not
curious in running from house too house, for to learn news, nor to babble and
to speak things which are not meet, and so to pass away the time
unfruitfully and vainly: but she is careful to handle and to deal with that
which is meet for the degree and estate of women, as is here signified, when
it is said, she seeks wool and flax: and she is not grieved to apply and
occupy herself about these vile and contemptible things: but knowing that
they agree with her estate, she deighteth to work on them. She thinks not
herself dishonored, nor also wearied though with her hands she spinneth
wool and flax, but her delectation is to do that which is profitable for her
household. And also it is the duty of wives to take the care of the house:
and the Apostle Saint Paul would have them to govern the household, and to
keep the house. The which is not done, if so be that the wives are delicate,
and think highly of themselves, and that they 1. Tim. 5. 14. Tit. 2. 5.
disdain small works, the which notwithstanding are profitable and necessary
for their family, for to clothe and array them. Women ought naturally to
understand this same: but yet to help nature and to stir it up, the holy
Ghost disdaineth not to humble himself even so far as to declare unto them
how they ought to behave themselves in their household: and that when they
work such works without covetousness, they do that which is pleasing unto
God. And therefore, let them apply themselves diligently without contempt, how
noble or rich soever they be. They that dedesire matter of high speculation,
will mock this, which we ought to praise and honor, seeing it is the doctrine
of the holy Ghost, for we must not count that vile which it pleases him to
teach. And therefore let not the husbands despise their wives, which apply
themselves in working those things which seem of small importance, when they
do that, that God teaches them by his word, and by his spirit.

14 She is like the ships of merchantes: she brings her food, from a
far.
It is a very profitable thing to have merchantes, that may send ships to the
Sea and to the rivers, to fetch provision from far countries, to help the
country that has need. And for this cause God has made the Sea and the
rivers nauigable: as it is after a sort given unto us to understand, when God
gave man Lordship over Genesis 1. 28. Psa. 107. 23
the fishes in the Sea. But merchants do greatly abuse them, committing
themselves to the dangers of the Sea and rivers by ambition, curiousness and
avarice, desiring to become great, to see diverse countries for to feed their
eyes, and to learn to talk of far countries and at pleasure: and chiefly
desiring to wax rich, without care of helping the needy either of their own
country or of another. It is enough for them to gain much: as they are
rebuked by James in his fourth Chapter, verse 13. And because they are so evil
affectioned, God does oftentimes overthrow their enterprises, and destroieth
their riches, and beats down their pride: as he threatens Esaias. 23. 10.
them by his word: and as we have seen the execution thereof also. And albeit
that the trades which they use, be profitable, yet their intent is wicked. And
also the wise woman does not compare the virtuous woman unto merchants which
send ships to the waters, but only to the ships, that are laden, and may be
ruled. Even so the virtuous woman receives the charge and office which it
pleases God to lay upon her, and suffers herself to be governed of God by
his holy spirit: and by this government, and not of herself, She brings
her food from far: that is to say, she tarieth not to work, til her family
be in extreme necessity, but she provides from a far, and labors to
prevent poverty, without distrust in God. For he would have us to labor, to
sow, to reap, and to lay up: and also he gives fit and convenient seasons
therefore: and those which despise them, are so far from trusting in God, that
rather they tempt him, because they would live without the means that he has
ordained. And if the wives: which are the most weakest vessels, must be such
puruieours, by a more strong reason then ought the men to be very vigilant,
without caring for to morrow: as they are admonished. Mat. 6. 25.


15 And she rises, whiles it is yet night: and gives the portion to her
household, and the ordinary to her maids.
For too show that it is not by avarice, nor of desire to be finely kept,
that the virtuous wife does bring her food from far, the wise woman does
well declare, how vigilant and careful she is, when she lies not in bed til
the day is come, but rises, whiles it is yet night. She declares also that
she spares not to give whatsoever is necessary and expedient unto her
household, not only unto her own children, but also to those which serve her,
and do the business of the house. Wherein we have to note, first of al, that
in praising the virtuous woman for that she rises before day, she admonishes
al strong persons and such as are in health, not to be given to love sleep,
but to be ready to rise up early, after having taken convenient and necessary
sleep, to make them more apt and meet to hold out and continewe all the day
in their vocation, and not that they should wax slouthful and negligent, as
do those which sleep too long. This admonition ought to be received of al
persons of good health, and also kept, unless they will be blamed with the
slouthful, and be in danger of poverty as they are. And though they came not
into the like danger, yet should they love Pro. 6. 9.
to rise very early and betimes in the morning: for not only it has been
praised at al times, and of al people of sound judgment, because it is
healthful for the body, and that they may have the more time and leisure to do
their business: but also (which is far better) the early rising is fit for to
meditate the works of God, to call upon him, to give him thanks, and to sing
praises unto him: as we may see in diverse psalms: and also to do pleasure
and service unto our neighbors. And albeit the wise woman does praise the
rising before day, and does attribute and give the same unto the virtuous
woman, yet is it not to say that she blames al those which do not so. For we
ought not to make and appoint a law or one egall rule for all men, when the
complexions are not alike. For one man may better for bear sleep and to
watch, then another. Notwithstanding, let them which are of an healthful and
strong co^plection, take heed from persuading themselves that they should
spoil themselves, if they rose early in the morning: for then they should not
be virtuous women, but very slouthful. Secondly, let us note, when the virtuous
woman is praised, giving the portion to her household, etc. That it is not
meet for women to prepare delicates, but they must be diligent to provide for
the household, and to fly idleness. Thirdly, when she gives the ordinary
portion, women are taught to beware that their household make no excess in
eating and drinking too abundantly: and also that they do not deny them such
things as are necessary for them, but that they do faithfully distribute them
to them, that the household fall not in to sickness, but being sustained,
nourished, and fed with a competent portion, they may be occupied about their
work as it behooves. And for to do this well, they have need of liberal
husbands, and which will not be too hard and straight: for such husbands will
not suffer willingly that there should be an ordinary trade, and reasonable
for the maintenance of their household servants, and cannot see expenses to be
made, so sparing and niggardly are they. After the judgment that we have given
upon this sentence, there is a repetition: but there are some which by the
ordinary or appointed portion, do understand the works and business where
about the virtuous woman does set her maidens giving unto every one her charge
and task, that they should not be idle, but should spend the day in labor,
and should not take and eat their meat for nothing. And in this the servants
and maidens are admonished to look well whereunto they are called: that is to
say, that they should not eat the goods of their masters and dames, but only
by laboring faithfully. This admonition belongs also to those which are
hired for an other.

16 She considers a field, and gets it: and with the fruit of her hands
she planteth a vineyard.
For to make her sentence brief and short, she tells not what it is that
moves the virtuous woman to consider the field: but when God forbids us to
covet, we must understand, that the virtuous woman does not desire to buy
away the goods of her neighbor, except that he himself does offer it, and
set it forth to sale. And so, forasmuch as the field is offered unto her,
and that she knows not of what value it is, nor what she shall give for it,
she considers it, least she should buy, she knew not what, as it is said:
and also that keeping love (whereunto we are al bound) she should not take the
field of her neighbor for a morsel of bread, but that she would give him a
reasonable price for it: as she would have done to her, if she were in steed of
the seller: otherwise she should be a thief, yea, a murderer: as are al those
which draw to the^ the goods of other men almost for nothing, respecting
nothing but their particular profit. It is said that she considering it, she
gets it: not for nothing,nor yet of the substance of her neighbors: as there
are diverse which suttlely draw unto them the money of their neighbors to buy
land withal: but the virtuous woman buyeth land of the substance that she
justly possesses, as it is well signified, when it is said, With the fruit of
her hands, etc. She calls that the fruit of her hands, which she justly
possesses by her travel, care, and diligence, or otherwise, without the hurt
of her neighbors. Now when the virtuous woman is thus praised, we may
understand, that it is lawful to sell and to buy fields and vinyardes, but
yet let it be with the fruit of our hands, and not with other men's money: and
also God in his law permits us to buy land. Moreover, when she planteth
a vineyarde, that is to say, when she is careful in woorking in the field that
she has bought, Leuit. 25. 14
and that she makes the same to profit, she shows unto women that they
ought not to be delicious, but that they must apply themselves unto work,
when it is necessary. Whereupon follows, that men which are commonly more
mighty then women, ought not to spare themselves, but eat their bread in the
sweat of Genesis 3. 17. 19
their face: as God has commanded them.

17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.
It was the manner of our elders in old time to be clothed with long gowns, of
what state soever they were. And we know that long gowns do much hinder: and
for this cause, when they would travel, and do any thing with diligence, or
fight against their enemies, Exo. 12. 11 1. Kin. 18. 26 2. King. 4. 29 Iere. 1.
17. Esai. 5. 27.
or run a race, or take a voyage, they trussed and girded up their garments
about their loins, and that so straight, that they should not fall down. They
trussed them up (I say) when they went a voyage, when they ran, when they
walked, when they began to work, when they fought, when they did work. And for
this cause, for to show the force, diligence and care of a virtuous woman, and
how she did not spare herself, the wise says,

She girdeth her loins with strength, etc. The girdle buckeled straight,
shows the diligence: and when it is said, And strengthened her arms, there
is showed that she spares not herself: for to strengthen the arms, is
nothing else but strongly and with great courage to lay the hands to the
work. Wherein the women are admonished not to become delicate: and because
that the precious garments do often hinder us from working (for we fear to
soil Luke 12. 35 1. Tim. 2. 9. 1. Pet. 3. 3
or to use them) let them follow the doctrine that S. Paul and S. Peter
teaches.

18 She feels that her merchandise is good: her candle is not put out by
night.
By her merchandise we understand all the works whereto the virtuous woman
does apply herself, for to bring in riches unto her husband. When she
feels, or she tastes that her works please her husband, and bring
profit unto the house, she cease not to apply the same: as it is signified,
when it is said. Her candle, etc. For the burning candle or Lamp, signifies
that the person is not given to be idle, but that she waketh about her
business, and guides herself rightly therein, foreseeing what she has to
do. Whereunto we are al called: and chiefly diligently to understand and
carefully to occupy ourselves about that which belongs to the service of God
and our salvation. True it is, that the Lamp or candle which is not put out by
night, signifies in other places, continual prosperity, joy, comfort and
glory, which the virtuous do Mat. 25. 1. Luke 12. 35 Psalm. 18. 29 Pro. 13. 9.
and 24. 20. Ier. 25. 10.
enjoy, what troubles soever do happen to them in the world. And we may also
understand it by that, that the wicked are threatened that their Lamp or
candle shall be put out. But the first exposition does seem to me the best
agreeing to the line of the text.

19 She puts ont her hands to the wherle, and her hands handle the spindle.
He continues in declaring how the virtuous wife does good unto her husband,
in applying herself to spinning: the which is a work meet for women: the
which ought not to be contemned, though it seem not a thing of any great
profit.

But forasmuch as the holy Ghost admonishes women to apply themselves
thereto, therefore they ought to follow this doctrine, nevertheless without
refusing greater works, when they can apply themselves theretoo. And when
their minds is not able to reach higher after the world, let not the
husbands chafe thereat, though there seem to them little gain to come thereof.
And there are some husbands, which had rather they should play then work.

20 She stretches out her hand to the poor, and puts forth her hands to
the needy.
Albeit that the virtuous woman is very attentive unto her work, and that by
this means she labors to do good unto her husband, yet is she not led
with covetousness, nor with desire of decking herself: and has not only
care to provide for her household servants, but also she has pity and
compassion of the poor and miserable: not with words only, but really and
indeed. She shows mercy toward them, for she woorketh for them with her
hands, helping them at need: as it is declared in this sentence, by a
repetition, the which ought to serve for our remembrance, that both men and
women which have the wealth of this world, might remember to succor the poor
and needy. It serves also to admonish the husbands that they be not vexed
though their wives do give themselves to the service of the poor: but that
rather they should stir them up theretoo: and that they may be occupied
therein, to give their wives wherewith to do it.

21 She fears not the snow for her family: for all her family is clothed
with double garments.
He has said, He that gives to the poor, shall not want: and now he shows
the effect. For having commended the mercy of the virtuous woman, he declares
that she exercises it without distrust, and without thinking in the hard time
that either she or her family shall be grieved and pinched with any need: for
as he says, She fears not, etc. By the snow, he signifies the sharp and
hard seasons and weather, the which are very hard to be passed of the poor
hungersteruen which are al too true, ill shod, and have cold nourishment.
After this declaration, he shows that being liberal toward the poor, she
has no need, when he says, For all her family, etc. It seems at the
first sight, that this is the reason, for the which the virtuous woman does not
fear the snow, etc. But by the consideration of her good furniture (the which
is signified, by double garments, or by the Scarlet, as some do interpret it)
she was led not to fear, she should be carnal, if she trusted in the
abundance of her riches: and so she should not be virtuous, but foolish: as
was the rich man spoken of in Luke. And she should be of the number of the
worldlings, which think themselves Luke 12. 16.
safe, and that they shall not want, because they have great provision. This is
not the reason then, nor the consideration for the which she does not fear:
but the wise declares, that her liberality shall not bring her any hurt, but
that she shall have enough for all that: wherewith she is well armed and provided
against the most hard and sharp seasons of weather: and being so provided,
she needs not to fear the storms and tempests. For if in poverty and
affliction we should not fear the evil, but be assured that God both does and
will assist us, without forsaking us, so much the less have we a reason to
fear, or to distrust, when God shows liberality unto us, giving us
abundance, but we must rejoice in our Lord, who gives us al things abundantly
for to use, not putting our trust in these earthly creatures, but in the living
God. He sets also before us, the care that the virtuous woman has to
provide things for her servants, for to keep them, and to maintain 1. Tim.
6. 17.
them in health, least women should accustom themselves to be negligent and
idle.

And let us note, that it is expressly said, that it is against the cold, and
not to cloth her family gorgiously, and to give them change of raiment for a
bravery: as do the proud women, which desire to go brave, and also to show
their children brave: and because of their bravery, they think that other are
not worthy to come near them. Yet this is not to say, but that it is lawful
to have Luke 16. 19 Iam. 5. 1. Esai. 58. 7 Mat. 5. 42. Luke 3. 11 Iam. 2. 15.
1. Ioh. 3. 17 18.
change of garments: so that therein we take heed from being like unto the
rich, spoken of in S. Luke: nor to the rich, to whom horrible threatninges are
made. And for to redress and amend this same, let us follow that which is
taught us: when thou see one that is naked, cloth him, and hide not thy
self from thine own flesh: and such like admonitions.

22 She makes herself Carpets: fine linen, and Purple is her garment.
By these present words we may know that it is not only lawful for us to
use things that are necessary for us, but also delectable and pleasant: and
chiefly, when with delectation there is profit, and that they serve to some
honest and decent use, and not to excess, dissoluteness, vanity, ostentation
and bravery. For our good God does allow us that we should delight modestly
in cunning woorkmanships: and also it is himself that gives man the knowledge
to do them. And thus it is lawful to have ornaments, but we must not spend al
our time therein, as diverse do. The wise does show it, when after having made
mention of necessary works, he speaks of delectable, preferring them unto
the necessary. And let us not think that the wise does praise braveness,
and esteem it: but let us know that he prayseth the virtuous woman, because
that she is so diligent about her work, that by her diligence she provides
for her family, not only necessary things, but also pleasant ornaments,
which are not unprofitable.

23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he fitteth with the elders of
the land.
When a married wife is virtuous, and that she is known such an one, her
husband is not despised, except he be altogether a fool and unprofitable: but
forasmuch as it belongs unto the man who is the head, to direct his wife,
both by doctrine and by deeds, therefore when it is seen that his wife
proceeds virtuously, he is praised and honored, he is raised up to dignity
and authority, and has a good name among the great which are truly ancient
in manners and conversation, and not only in years. The good name is noted,
when it is said,

That he is known in the gates: by the which those are signified which have
the government of the people, because that in them they gathered themselves
together to commen and talk of their matters, and to plead the law. The
dignity and authority is signified, when it is said, He sits, etc. Now
although that none ought to affect the chiefest rooms, yet every one should
take pain to make himself capable, that he may duly exercise his office,
when it shall please God to make him sit amongst the elders. For by the wisdom
of God do Kings reign, and the Counselors decree Pro. 8. 15. 16
justice. After some we may say, that the wise understands that the husband,
knowing that his wife is virtuous, does keep good and continual residence in
the judgment seat, for to handle such matters as shall be offered, and hastes
not home, but taking care of the common matters, he commits to his wife all the household affairs: and so doing, he gets a good name, and is in good
reputation. Nevertheless this is not to say, that we ought to thrust in
ourselves to meddle with the common wealth, except we be called: but let every
man keep beneath, til it please God to raise him up.

24 She makes sheets, and sells them, and gives girdles unto the merchant.
He returns to praise her for her house wiuerie, and for her merchandise, the
which she governs carefully to make it to profit. And when he says, She
makes, and then, sells and gives, He shows that it is of her labor she
sells. Wherein the Merchantes and shop women have their lesson: that is to
say, that they ought to work and to labor to gain their living, and not to
be idle in their shoppes, for to mark the merchandises that pass by them,
that they may buy them at a low price, afterward for to make them dear and
to raise the price, and to sell them them so dear as they can, to the hurt of
the common people. The same is to flea of the skin, to eat the flesh, and
to break the bones. And this trade has the very Heathen greatly blamed, to
wit, to buy that which we will sell again immediately much deerer. Such as
follow this trade, are Ingrossers, and are worthy of malediction and cursing:
and also it is said, The people will curse him that withdraws the corn: but a
blessing shall be upon the head of him that sells Pro. 11. 26.
corn. And also the virtuous woman is praised for that she sells, and
gives the woorkmanship of her hands to sell.

25 Strength and honor is her clothing, and in the latter day she shall
rejoice.
He has spoken of the corporal vesture and clothing, wherewith the virtuous
woman is clothed: and now, for to show that she sets not her affection
upon such ornaments, as do foolish, vain and curious women, which desire to
please the eyes of the world, he declares that she has an other garment
far more excellent: that is, that with the earnest mind she has to do
good unto her husband, and to provide for her family, and not to be weerie
nor unprofitable, she applies herself stoutly unto good works: wherewith
she is strengthened more and more, and gets glory and honor. And thus her
clothing, wherein she chiefly delights, is strength and honor. And such
clothing is much more excellent, then are the gorgeous garments of the
worldlinges. For though for a certain time the worldlinges are joyful in their
pomp, yet have they afterward sorrow and mourning: as they Luke. 6. 24.
James. 5. 1. Luke. 16. 23 Esaias. 3. 15.
are threatened therewith: and as we have an example thereof in the rich. And
thus has it happened unto the daughters of Sion, according unto the
threatening of Esaias: But the clothing of the waking and watchful wife,
brings perpetual joy: as it is signified, when it is said, and in the latter
day she shall rejoice. We may take this latter day after three sorts. First of
al for the time of old age, wherein the worldlings do commonly lament, because
they cannot laugh and rejoice as they did before, and that their old age is
filled with misery. But they which in the flower of their age have behaved
themselves manly and valiantly, and have of a free mind applied themselves to
do well, are not grieved for old age, but bear the same patiently, and what
evil soever they suffer, yet they cease not to be glad and joyful. Secondly,
for the time wherein temporal death approaches. Then are the worldlinges
greatly tormented in their consciences, the which do reprove the^ for their
pomp, pride, vanities and follies: but those which have been delighted to
work righteously, do then rejoice, being assured of the remission of their
sins. Thirdly, for the day of the last resurrection, wherein those which have
been well and profitably occupied, shall have great cause of joy. For they shall
possess the kingdom of heaven, and the worldlings shall have cause of mourning
for the torments that they shall suffer. Or if ye will take this word, in the
latter day she shall rejoice, Mat. 25. 34. 35.
more simply, that is to say, that the virtuous woman shall have continual
prosperity and joy: what time soever happen, the sense shall be meet enough.
After what sort soever we take it, women are admonished to be modest, and
sober in decking themselves, and to apply themselves with a free heart unto
work and labor.

26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the law of grace is in her
tongue.
As she behaueth herself virtuously in her business and works, even so does
she also in her words. The worldly women do think themselves very virtuous
when they can open their mouths readily to pronounce that which comes in
their fantasy, without discerning whether the words they talk be meet or
no: but the virtuous woman is guided by wisdom to speak that which is
convenient. Wherein the women which desire to speak well, are admonished to
give their hearts to learn wisdom, not to labor to please the wise of this
world by their words, as do they which have sogred mouths, but to utter
forth words of edification, and such as do not provoke their neighbors unto
wrath or despyte: but by soft and gentle words would win the hearts of
their neighbors, after the example of the virtuous woman, which has the law
of grace in her tongue: that is to say, that does so rule and guide her
tongue, that it serves as it were for a book, out of the which is learned al
goodness, wherewith we may judge that her heart is filled. For from the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. And thus the women are taught, that
for to be virtuous and to show themselves such, they must suppress their
nature, the which is suddenly to speak foolishly, to be spiteful, and
lightly to be angry. And for to do this suppression, let them follow the
virtuous woman, according as the wise does briefly at this present teach
them, and as Saint Paul does more largely in diverse places. And therefore
they ought to give their minds unto the reading of the holy scritpure, and to
hearing of sermons of the word of GOD, which is the true wisdom of all the
faithful.

27 She considers the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of
idleness.
The virtuous woman has not a faint nor effeminate heart, as have they which
are contented to be d^intily nourished and kept, and yet care to know how
they should govern in the house. They rest, they pastime and take their
pleasure, and labor to live in wantonness, and leave all the charge unto their
husbands: but she considers how she should govern her children and
other her household servants, which are contained under the word of household:
that she may cause them to spend the time in well doing. And it is not to
be discharged in charging them: but to the end to show them the way that
they should hold, she herself labors diligently: as the wise does
signify, which says not only, She considers, but also that she eats not
the bread of idleness. In the same she gives an instruction to her household
that they ought to labor, and to eat their bread in the sweat of their face.
And also she shows unto women that they ought not to eat, except they work.

28 Her children rise up, and call her blessed: her husband also shall praise
her.
Because that the virtuous woman takes care both of the bodies and souls of
her children, as it has been declared in the former sentences, therefore it
comes to pass that her children do grow in age and wisdom, in counsel
and discretion: as the wise does signify it, saying, her children rise up. And
being thus grown and increased corporally and spiritually, they have a true
knowledge of the care that their mother had of them, and how she has wrought
virtuously, for this cause they do greatly esteem her, they do praise her
and honor her, and speak of her as of her that must al ways prosper, and
never be overcome with evils. The which the wise does signify, saying, and call
her blessed. On the other side, her husband also seeing her conversation so
virtuous, and that by her means his children have well profited, cannot blame
her, but being contented with her, speaks of her all the good he can
possibly: as the wise adds, saying,

Her husband also shall praise her. If we shall take this word rise up, more
simply, that is to say, for they come forth, and show themselves to declare
the praises of their virtuous mother, and to bring her in reputation in the
world, there shall be no inconvenience. But in what sense soever it is taken, we
must understand this same of aged children, well taught, and well manneried. For
little children, which are without discretion, cannot so speak, except that we
will say that their good bringing up, shows that their mother is well worthy to
be praised, for the care that she had and still has to govern and to bring
the^ up godly. And indeed, when we see the children of a house to be godly
brought up, we cannot forbear, but must praise and commend their mother.
Wherein children are taught not to be unthankful toward their mothers, and
not to be ashamed to acknowledge and confess openly, how much they are bound
unto them. The which they cannot do, except they greatly esteem her, and
greatly love her: otherwise also their praise should be but dissimulation. The
husbands also are here admonished to content themselves with their wives, when
they take pains to do their office and duty. And we^ to do this, let them
not be severe and sharp, but gentle and amiable, bearing with their wives,
when through infirmity or ignorance they do not so well as they wish they
should do.

29 Many daughters have gotten wealth, but thou have surmounted them all.
We shall see in the world many great housewiues, who by their care and
diligence, by their greediness and covetousness, in sparing and locking up,
in gathering together and drawing to them, by right or by wrong, will become
rich. But although in so doing they heap together great abundance of riches,
and that they come to great wealth, yet is it nothing, or very little, in
comparison that the virtuous woman does: as we may see it by that which has
been rehearsed of her, from the 10. verse hithertoo. It is most often seen to
happen, that the wealth of those great housewiues, does suddenly vanishe and
come to nothing: but that which the virtuous woman gets, continues, as we
may see by this present rehearsal, and amongst other places in the 25. verse,
when it is said that she shall rejoice and laugh in the last day. For there are
many which delighting in their prosperity, are at the last constrained to
lament their misery, as they are threatened therewith in Esaias chapter 32. 9.
but the wealth righteously gotten shall be of continuance by the blessing of the
Lord. In steed that we have said, they have gotten wealth: we might say,
they have wrought valiantly, or they have done virtuously. For there is the
very selfsame word of the 10. verse, the which has been translated,
virtuous. And the sense should not be unfit, but should be as if it were
said, That there are many wives which have some kind or part of virtue: and
in deed they do some things that are worthy of praise: but yet the same is
nothing in comparison of that which the wife truly virtuous does.

30 Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vanity: but a woman that fears the
Lord, she shall be praised.
The maidens and wives of their corrupt nature are curious, and desire to see
such things as profit them nothing, but rather do hurt them and bring them to
dishonor: as Dina and Thamer. Likewise Genesis 34. and 38. 13.
they desire to be seen, and to please the eyes of worldlings. And to do the
same, they color and paint themselves to seem fair, and of a beautiful hew,
and pleasant countenance. And this is that which the wise calls favor and
beauty. And such painting and countenance does well like the worldlings, whose
eyes are full of adultery: they praise and commend such women as can disguise
and trim up themselves: and in their mind and fantasy they shall seem to
be fine and honest: but they which shall walk faithfully and plainly, shall be
counted foul and uncomely. Wherein they are deceived, as the wise does show,
when he calls favor deceitful, and beauty vanity: declaring that those
which color themselves with such favor and beauty, are deceived. And herein
he says nothing which has not always been proved by experience, even from
the beginning of the world. Adam found and saw favor in his wife when he
yielded to take the forbidden fruit of her hand. The sons of God, saw great
beauty in the daughters of men. Sichem Genesis 3. and 6. and 34.
saw that Dina was fair. But they were aldeceiued, and found not that which
they looked for: and in steed to find happiness, they fell into great
troubles, as the end has showed. And in following the same end it is written,
many have been deceived by the beauty of women: for by it is love kindled as
it were a fire. Wherein we may see that the wise yelding and applying himself
unto our kind Eccle. 9. 10.
of speech, uses here this word favor improperly. For properly to speak,
favor is the good will that we bear to another, without his deserving. And
such women as would be found fair, do not seek to show or to bear
favor, but most often do sell themselves to them, that will give most.
Notwithstanding, for all that, they will labor to persuade their whoremongers,
that they show them much favor in yelding themselves over unto them: though
they take gifts and presents of them: and the poor fools (so much are they
deceived) will again thank them greatly for it: as though they had received
some great benefit, and that they were much beholding unto them. And in this
manner they praise and esteem that which is nothing, but vanity and deceit,
yea very hurtful and pernicious unto them, which linger after such favor and
beauty. For they which color themselves, and desire to seem fair and of
comely favor, and they which delight therein, are both carried and led of the
Devil, who is a liar and a deceiuer, and the father of lying and deceit. The
women therefore which labor to make themselves to seem fair, are not to be
praised nor commended, but 1. Pet. 3. 4.
they whose virtuous heart being hidden, is without corruption, and of a mild
and quiet spirit. For although the voluptuous worldlings do nothing esteem
such virtuous women, yet forasmuch as they are highly esteemed with God, we
must therefore greatly esteem them also: as we are here thereof admonished,
when it is said, but a woman that fears, etc. For when the wise man says,
she shall be praised: the same is as much as if he said, that she ought to be
praised, and had in good reputation, honor and to be blessed and saved so much
as possibly may be from dishonor. For it is good reason that we should praise
and esteem that which our God praises and loves. Now that he praises the
virtuous woman, the wise man shows, when he attributes unto her, the fear
of the Lord: for all they which fear him are welcome unto him, he does assist
them and keep them: as has been handled already in diverse places. Therefore
if women will obtain true praises, they must have then the fear of the Lord:
the which is showed forth by honest and holy conversation, and when they apply
themselves to that which God commands in his law.

31 Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in
the gates.
Although that of ourselves we do nothing that is ought worth, and that we
well deserve to be blamed, even for the best and most perfect works which
proceed from us, in the greatest truth and sincerity that we are able, (for
they are never such as they ought to be: and that which is good in them,
comes not from us, but from God, who works in us both the will and the
deed, according to his good pleasure) yet, if we will suffer the holy Ghost to
regenerate and to sanctify us, that we may walk in newness of life, that we
are at defiance with the world, and do not yield thertoo, but do strive to
follow the good will of our God, he will cause us to be praised, as though we
ourselves were authors of the goodness: and that which he works in us, he
calls ours. And therefore, after that the wise man has rehearsed the good
works of the virtuous woman, he will have her to be praised, not only privately
of her husband, and of her household, but also publicly. For having said, Give
her of the fruit of her hands: that is to say, acknowledge her pains and
labor, and bless her: for this cause he adds afterward, or we must cause
this confession to be made, when he says, And let her own works praise her
in the gates: that is to say, that the virtuous woman ought to be praised and
commended in the great congregations, because of her virtue that shines in her
life, and conversation. Now if the virtuous woman be worthy of public praise,
by a stronger reason ought her children to acknowledge the labor that she has
borne for them, and never to forget it: to be wholly at her commandment, and
to help her with all their power, according to the commandment of God, Honor
thy father and thy mother, etc.

Praised be God for ever and ever.
