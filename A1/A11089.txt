ODES. IN IMITATION OF THE SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS, With Sundry other
Poemes and ditties tending to devotion and piety.

HS

M.D.CI.

TO THE VIRTUOUS LADIES AND GENTLE WOMEN READERS OF THESE DITTIES.
WHen for my own private recreation I had penned some of these poemes yet not
ente^ding to make them publyke, for that I feared their soon receiving the
deserved censure of the slenderness of their worth. Yet having by chance
communicated them with a friend, I was not a little urged, to afford them the
liberty of open view, but also persuaded to their further augmentation. And
now having yielded unto the one, and adventured the other, I knew no better way
then to make dedication of them unto your selves, whose sweet voices or
virginalles may voutsafe so to grace them, as that thereby they may be much
bettered, and the rather if it shall please you to obtain of some skilful
Musician, such requisite tunes, as may unto them be best fitting. And therein
craving your helpful furtherance, and for my presumption your favorable
pardon, I humbly take my leave, excusing my self with my own good meaning:

Vttred as ensues. Vid.

The vain conceits of loves delight
I leave to Ouids art,
Of wars and bloody broils to write
Is fit for Virgils part.
Of tragedies in doleful tales
Let Sophocles entreat:
And how unstable fortune fails
Al Poets do repeat.
But unto our eternal king
My verse and voice I frame
And of his saints I mean to sing
In them to praise his name.
Yours in his best endeavors R. V.

ODES. IN IMITATION OF THE SEVEN PENItential Psalms:
To so-many several tunes of Music.
In imitation of the first penitential Psalm. Beginning.
Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 6.
WHen my misdeedes o God
May thee to anger move,
Amiddes the rigor of thy rage
Voutsafe me not reprove.
Nor when for my offense
Thy chastisment must be,
In thy displeasure o dear Lord
Let it not light on me.
Thy mercies Lord I crave
Of strength I am bereft,
O salve the soreness that my sin
Upon my bones has left.
My much agrieued soul*
In sorrows does abound,
How long o Lord shall they endure
Or comfort be unfound.
O turn thy self to me
And rid my soul of pain,
Even for thy mercies which exceed
And ever do remain.
O hasten thee o Lord
To save and set me free,
Amongst the dead (to their avail)
There Is none can thinck on thee.
And in the depth of hell
Where there is no redress,
Who is it that will give the praise
Or unto thee confess?
My sighinges for my sins
Have past in painful wise,
And I each night will wash my bed
With tears of wailing eyes.
My sight is vexed with fear
Of fury in thy rage,
Oh that my sins must be my foes
To wear me out in age.
A way a way from me
All ye that are unjust,
Let him my mournful sound receive
In whom I put my trust.
That I with joy may say
How to my suits accord,
Voutsafed has to condescend
My dear and loving Lord.
Let shame my foes befall
And vexed let them be,
Their own conversion or their shame
Lord let them quickly see.
Glory o God to thee
And unto Christ thy son,
As also to the holy ghost
Let endlesly be done.
AMEN.
In imitation of the second penitential Psalm. Beginning.
Beati quorum remiss sunt. Psalm. 31.
O How much blessed may they remain
That pardon for their guylt obtain,
And whose great il and each offense
Lies hid in contryte penitence.
What happy state may he be in
To whom our Lord imputes no sin,
Whose conscience does no guyle retain
That can himself beguyle again.
I did my sins in silence hold,
In grief whereof my bones grew old,
M^ane while my days in plaintes of pain
Without redress I spent in vain.
But when o Lord thy heavy hand
No day or night I could withstand,
But that in anguish ouerworne
My conscience pricked as with a thorn.
Lo then o Lord I did begin
To utter all my secret sin,
No longer list I ought conceal
But each injustice to reveal.
Against my self I said will I
My wrongs confess and faults defy,
To thee o Lord, o Lord to thee
That haest from all absolved me.
And since I thus thy mercies find
Let each of good and godly mind,
Aproche to thee in happy time
To pray for pardon of his crime.
For such as so do sinck in sin
That still they plunged lie therein,
Unable are of thee to gain
What contryte sinners can obtain.
O Lord my refuge restes in thee
When troubles do enuyron me,
O free me then my freedoms joy
From such as seek me to annoy.
Great comfortes Lord I do conceive
Thou me thy servant wilt not leave,
But wilt instruct and guyd me right
And keep me ever in thy sight.
O ye that careless are of grace
Behold and see your brutish case,
And be not as the horse and mule
That live deuoyd of reasons rule.
And thou o Lord in mercies ryf
Voutsafe restrain their straying life,
With bit and bridle make them stay
That unto thee will not obey.
Since that for those of sinful trade
Full many scourges there be made,
Well him, that does in God repose
Whose mercies may his soul enclose.
Be therefore joyful in our Lord
All that to righteousness accord,
Let each with gladness bear his part
That has a pure and perfect heart.
All glory be O Lord to thee
And to thy Son in like degree
As also to the holy Ghost
Perpetual and enduring most.
AMEN.
In imitation of the third penitential Psalm. Beginning.
Domine ne in furore. Psalm. 37.
AMiddes thy fury my dear lord
Rebuke not me,
Nor let thy chasticement befall
When wrathful thou shall be.
Thy arrows in my self I feel
Already stand,
I see o Lord thou fixed haest
At me thy aiming hand.
Within my self (o woe is me)
No health I find,
Through fear and terror of thy face
That semes to wrath enclynde.
My very bones disturbed be,
Gone is their peace,
My own beholding of my sins
Does woork my woes increase.
And as my sins surmounting are,
I must confess,
So are they mounted on my head
And heavy me opresse.
My crimes forepast and pardoned
Like scarres remain,
That putry fyde break out a new
Because I sin again.
A woeful wretch am I become
Crooked I grow,
Each day I wail and while I live.
I will continue so.
My members by illusions led
Me so restrain,
My healthlesse body is unapt
True virtue to retain.
By great affliction I am brought
Exceeding low,
Be moved Lord through my loud groans
Thy mercies to bestow.
My suits o Lord tend all to thee
Thou know my case,
My plaintes and penance Lord accept
That so I may have grace.
Within my self my silly heart
Is vexed still,
My force is lost, my sight I lack,
To see and shun my il.
In my displeasing thee o Lord
Right well I see,
My freindes are foes, my soul is sought
And force is wrought on me.
They wish my il, and speak my scorns,
And when they smyle,
Their hate admittes no time of stay
To study fraud and guyle.
But I alas with patience pressed
Must all for-beare,
Like to the dumb and seeming deaf
I neither speak nor hear,
And for because o gracious God
I trust in thee,
Thou wilt I know my loving Lord
Give ear and aid to me.
Let not o Lord my foes prevail
Least they rejoice,
Since scars my feet I may remove
But they advance their voice.
Of my misdeedes I am prepared
To bear the smart,
Still is my sin before my sight
And sorrow in my heart.
I will reuolue my faults fore-past
Amiddes my mind,
And those I truly will confess
That I may mercy find.
Hate has confirmd on me my foes
In wrongful wise
And still they live and do increase
Whose envy never dies.
They yield me il that gave them good
And me defy,
Because I goodness would ensue
From which they seek to fly.
Forsake me not o Lord my God
In state destrest,
Be ready Lord to my relief
My life in thee does rest.
To Father Son and holy Ghost
All glory be,
From former endless date to dure
To all eternity.
AMEN.
In imitation of the fourth penitential Psalm. Beginning.
Miserere mei Deus. Psalm. 50.
Have mercy o good God on me
In greatness of thy grace,
O Let thy mercies manifold
My many faults deface.
Foul filthy loath-some ugly sin
Has so defiled me,
With streams of pity wash me clean
Else clean I cannot be.
To well my foul vnclensed crimes
Remembrance do renew,
To plain in anguish of my heart
They stand before my view.
To thee alone o Lord to thee
Thease euilles I have done,
And in thy presence, woe is me,
That ere they were begun.
But since thou pardon promisest
Where hartes-true-ruthe is shown,
Show now thy mercies unto me
To make thy justness known.
That such as do infringe thy grace
Be made ashamed and shent,
As ryfe thy mercies to behold
As sinners to repent.
With favor view my foul deffects
In crimes I did begin,
My nature bad, my mother frail,
Conceau'd I was in sin.
But since thy self affectest truth
And truth it self is thee,
I truly hope to have thy grace
From sin to set me free.
Since to thy faithful thou before
The secret science gave,
Whereby to know what thou would spend
The sinful world to save.
Whose heavenly hysope sacred drops
Shall me besprinckle so,
That it my sin-defyled soul
Shall wash more white then snow.
O when mine ears receive the sound
Of such my souls release,
How do sin-laden lymmes rejoice
At hattes true joys increase?
From my misdeedes retire thy sight
View not so foul a stain,
First wype a way, my spots impure
Then turn thy face again.
A clean and undefiled heart
O God creat in me,
Let in me Lord, of righteousness
A spirit infused be.
From that most glorious face of thine
O cast me not away,
Thy holy Ghost voutsafe o God
With me that it may stay.
The joy of thy salvation Lord
Restore to me again
And with thy spryte of graces chief
Confirm it to remain.
That when at thy most gracious hand
My suits received be,
The impious I may instruckt
How they may turn to thee.
For when o Lord I am releast
From vengeance and from blood,
How joyful shall I speak of thee
So gracious and so good.
Thou Lord wilt give me leave to speak,
And I thy praise will show,
For so the graces do require,
Thou do on me bestow.
If thou sin-offringes had desyr'd,
As wonted weere to be,
How gladly those for all my illes,
I would have yielded thee.
But thou accepts in sacrifise,
A sorowing soul for sin,
Despysing not the heart contryte,
And humbled mind within.
Deal graciously o loving Lord,
In thy free bounties will,
With Syon, thy dear spouse in earth,
And fortify it still.
That so thou may thence receive,
That sovereign sacryfise,
From alter of all faithful hearts,
Devoutly where it lies.
To thee o Father glory be
And glory to the Son,
And glory to the holy Ghost
Eternally be done.
AMEN.
In imitation of the fyft penitential Psalm. Beginning.
Domine exaudi orationem meam. Psalm. 101.
O Let o Lord thine ears enclyned be
To hear the prayers that I make to thee:
And my hearts grief that breaks forth in cries
O let it have the power to pearce the skies.
Turn not from me thy favorable face,
What day or hour I am in heavy case:
But when I call to thee in my destresse
O hear me Lord and send me soon redress.
My days and years alas with little gain
Like unto smoke how are they past in vain:
My forces Lord how are they partch'd and dry,
Devotions lack yields moisture no supply.
The blasted grass my image now can show,
My withered heart confirms that it is so:
And I forgotten have unto my grief,
To eat the bread of my souls best relief.
And my too much regard of earthly care
Before my self for grace I could prepare,
Made reason to abandon reason quyte,
And to affection fast it self unity.
Bur now o Lord, since that I do begin
To see my self, and know the shame of sin,
From earthly train I will retire my mind,
Thee will I seek, my saving health to find.
In desert like as lives the Pelicane,
Or as the crow that does day light refrain
Or chirping sparow sitting all alone.
I shroud, I watch, retired, I make my moan.
But while O Lord I do endure this life
Expecting peace by fleeing wordly stryf
Old freindes I find become new noisome foes
O love me Lord, for loss of love of those.
My penance not restraind through scorn of theirs,
My food I take with ashes and with tears:
Thee more I fear, least thou on me should frown,
That can me raise, and raising cast me down.
My days declyne as does a shadow pass,
And I as hay that whylome was as grass:
But thou from age to age shall ever be,
Then evermore o Lord forget not me.
Voutsafe o Lord in puissance to arise,
To raise thy Sion that depressed lies:
Now is the time, the time does now expyre,
It mercy wantes, and mercy does desire.
This glorious woork was first begun by thee,
Thy servants erst were glad the stones to see:
And they will grieve with hartes-afflicted care,
If so the ruynes thou do not repare.
But when o Lord thy woorks shall show thy fame
The faithless people then shall fear thy name:
And eartly kings shall bend their glory down,
At thy celestial glory and renown.
Because thy Church thy Syon thou did buyld,
Where thou would ever have thy honor hild:
And haest not unregarded hard the plaint,
Of faithful folk, thrall'd in untruths restraint.
And that no time remembrance may impare,
Of thy maintained woork, and mercy rare,
Let people now, for people to ensew,
Thy praise record, thy praises to renew,
For from high heaven to this low earthly place,
From blis to bale our Lord enclynes his face:
The groans to hear, the greiued to releasse,
To free from thrall, to make affliction cease.
The more may Sion now sound forth his fame,
Jerusalem his praises may proclaim:
Where in his Church his people do accord,
And whereas kings are subjects to their Lord.
Who may o Lord thy datelesse days relate,
That of all ages ouerpasse the date:
It Is thou to us haest put appointed space,
O stop not me ere half I run my, race.
The world and welkin first by thee were made,
Thou heavens sphere, thou earths foundation laid,
Thou shall endure, they shall consumed be,
Thou made time, time has no force on thee.
Thease elements by alteration strange,
Shall changed be, and so remain in change:
But thou o Lord that works all at thy will,
VVa'st erst the same, the same remaining still.
Vousafe o Lord there offspring to preserve,
That thee in fear and faith and love do serve:
And in thy ways directed to remain,
A lasting life in lasting bliss to gain.
Unto the Father, Son and holy Ghost,
All praise and glory be ascrybed most,
As herefore before the world begun
And as it now, and ever shall be done.
AMEN.
In imitation of the sixth penitential Psalm. Beginning.
De profundis clamaui ad te Domine. Psalm. 129.
Even from the depth of woes
Wherein my soul remains,
To thee in supreme blis
O Lord that highest reigns,
I do both call and cry:
It Is deep hart-sorrowes force
That moves me thus to wail,
It Is pity Lord in thee
Must make it to avail,
Thine ears therefore aply.
If stricktly thou o Lord
Observed haest my sin,
Alas what shall I do?
What case then am I in?
If rigor thou extend:
But well o Lord I know
Sweet mercy dwelles with thee,
And with thy justice then
It must expected be,
And I therefore attend.
My soul does wait on thee,
Thy grace confirms my trust,
My warrant is thy word:
Thou keep promis just,
Keep me o Lord secure:
Let thy afflicted flock
Comfort in thee retain,
From dauning day to night,
From night to day again,
Let still their hope endure.
There is with our good God
Much mercy still in store,
Redemption does remain
With him for ever more,
Abundant is his grace:
His people he affects
He will not leave destrest,
The thralled he will free,
With ease of their unrest,
And all their faults deface.
All glory be therefore
O Father unto thee,
And so unto the Son,
The like great glory be,
And to the holy Ghost:
Such as it wonted was,
Before the world began,
Such as now yet it is,
And ever shall remain,
Above all glory most.
AMEN.
In imitatio^ of the seventh penite^tial Psalm. Beginning.
Domine exaudi orationem meam. Psalm. 142.
VOutsafe admit thy gracious ears,
With myld regard for to attend,
The prayers that a playning heart,
With sorowing sighs to thee does send:
And let thereto o loving Lord
Thy justice and thy truth accord.
In rigor of thy righteous doom
O do not skan thy servants cause,
For there is none on earth alive
Through faultlesse life freed from thy laws:
Then how may I in sinful plight
Seem just in thy all-seeing sight?
The friend of sin, the foe of souls,
Down to the earth my soul has brought,
Which to the heaven should aspyre,
Since from the heaven it was wrought:
O raise it up again to blis
From earth and all that earthly is.
Amids the darck misled am I,
Where lack of light sins view denies,
I hue a life more like to death,
While dead from grace my body lies:
And whereas care through secret smart
Sends anguysh to afflict my heart.
But I o Lord recall to mind
What thou have done in time before,
And how thy justice has been great,
But how thy mercy has been more:
Thus hope of help still comfort gives,
While mercy still with justice lives.
My stretched hands to thee display
The ensigns of my yiedling heart,
My soul as earth that water wants
Of virtues fruit can bear no part:
I faint, send soon relief of rain,
Least else unfruitful I remain.
Thy face of pity not of wrath
Turn not o loving Lord from me,
And let not Lord my own misdeedes
Have lasting force to anger thee:
For so might I compare my case
To theirs that furthest fall from grace.
But since my hope is firm in thee
Let me betymes thy mercy have,
The way of health make known to me,
My feet from erring paths to save:
Only to thee my soul retyres,
Only thy mercy it desires.
O free me from my sinful foes,
To thee I fly to be secure,
Teach me the lesson of thy will,
And let me put it well in ure,
Thou art my God and God of all
That for thy aid and comfort call.
Thou wilt voutsafe to me o Lord
Thy holy spryt to be my goyd,
My faith and hope in thee is such,
And such it ever shall abide:
Reuyue thou wilt me for thy name,
Goodness in thee requyres the same.
So that at last by thee o God
My soul from bale to blis be brought,
And that in mercy thou sub^ert
All those my souls destruction sought:
And force of foes destroyed may be,
And I made safe for serving thee.
All glory be to thee o God,
The Father of eternal might:
And to the Son, and holy Ghost,
Three in an vndeuyded plight:
As now it is, and was of yore,
And shall endure for evermore.
AMEN.
EXTRACTS OF THE SIBYLLAES PROPHESIES OF CHRIST.
Sibylla Persica.
Thou serpent fraught with craft and cruelty
Shall by a mightier strength be trodden low,
And on base earth, the high God borne shall be,
And from a maid the branch of blis shall grow:
And that true word, unseen before of all,
Shall now be seen, and shall be felt withal.
Sibylla Libyca.
IN obscure darcknes light shall glistring shine,
The Synagogs straight bands unbound shall be:
The king of life be seen of mortal eyes,
And in a maidens lap shall nowrisht be,
And high above the gentiles he shall reign,
And shall in mercy his estate maintain.
Sibylla Delphica.
ATtend (o earth) thy sovereign Lord to see,
And know thy God, which is Gods only son:
Child of the highest, and most high is he,
Whose being by no earthly wight begun:
He shall the great expexted prophet be,
Of worthy greatness, and great dignity.
Sibylla Cumea.
AMaid excelling all in sainctitie
And whose clear beauty shall the stars exceed
Of Child (in future time) conceau'd shall be,
And of the rarest sacred blood and seed:
And from the heavens the sweet dew down shall fall
Into her breasts to nowrish him withal.
Sibylla Erithrea.
IN later age, high God will him abase,
And unto low estate himself inclyne,
Mixing his nature with our human race,
His Godheid to our manheid to combyne:
And lo the little lamb in strawy bed,
Shall of a maid be nowrished and fed.
Sibylla Samia.
O Fond Judea, why do thou neglect,
The certain knowledge of thy very God,
Thy happy days why do thou so reject?

With thorny crown his head why do thou press?
And for his taste a bitter potion dress.
Sibylla Cumana.
WHat time the third days sleep has taken end
The time prescry bed also end shall take,
Of death, whose rule to that space did extend,
And then as from his sleep shall wax awake,
He whose now bringing lives reuyned joy,
Shall show how men from death may life enjoy.
Sibylla Helispontiaca.
EVen from the heavens most high and stately throne

And of all creatures take regard of one,
Of modest meekness, and most gracious hew:
And as a man God shall be borne on earth,
And of an hebrew virgin have his birth.
Sibylla Phrigia.
THe earth shall rent at fearful trumpet sound,
And kings as vassals at Gods seat appear,
In justice all his judgments shall abound,
Yiedling to men as men deserved here:
unto the good, still during heavenly joy,
And to the il, long-lasting helles annoy.
Sibylla Tiburtina.
Thou Bethlem art the birthplace of thy Lord,
That does from Nazareth assume his name,
O blessed moother, blis does thee afford,
His love, that leaves himself pledge of the same*
O blessed be that sweet milk-yeilding breast,
To no wrish God, right happily adrest.
FINIS.
THE FIFTEEN MYSTERIES OF THE ROSARIE, OF OUR BLESSED LADY. WHEREOF The first
five. are joyful. The second sorrowful. And the third glorious.


The first joyful mystery.
Containing the Anuntiation of our blessed Lady.
WHen heavens rare love resolved man's release*
From thrall to him that first produced sin,
It was decreed that this redeeming peace,
Must by a God and by a man begin,
Then on Embassage was an Angel sent,
unto the best of all the best on earth,
With grace-ful greeting to declare the intent,
Of Gods design in such a sacred berth.
And even as she assented to the same,
Eft-soones in her conception did begin,
And blessedness gave title to her name,
And joy at her glad heart did enter in.
The second joyful mystery.
Containing our ladies visitation of S. Elizabeth.
HEr change exchanged not humbleness for pride,
That bore Gods Son and yet would go to see,
Her in whose womb Gods servant did resyde,
vain points could not with her pure virtue be.
And as her coosins ears received her voice,
One child by Simpathy the other moved,
Which outwardly both moothers made rejoice,
Whose joy each child by inward joy approved,
From virgins mouth the dittie then begun,
How much her soul did magnify her lord,
Which since inured help-seekers from her son
Therein her praise, in his praise to record.
The third joyful mystery.
Containing the birth of Christ.
AT Ceasars hest to Bethlem she repaires,
As duty wild, where duty had no claim,
No harbenger her loging there prepares,
Her poor estate fyndes harbor like the same.
But when as God in chyldheid would appear,
Odors and Angels brightness it adorn,
And with dear love, her loving babe so dear,
She does adore as soon as it is borne.
High privilege exempted her from woe,
Which but Gods mother none could else obtain,
And heavenly bounty did on her bestow,
That she a maiden ever should remain.
The fourth joyful mystery.
Containing the presentation of Christ in the temple.
AT time prefixed by ryte of ancient lore,
That now the moother must her babe present,
Though not impure, but purer then before,
And pureness bringing with her where she went.
As warned then, through hyre of hope and faith,
Good Simeon comes, to see his wished sight,
Where as the Swan he singes before his death,
And in one joy does end all worlds delight.
And all they years old Anne devoutly spent,
That with her age encreast her godly zeal,
Did now bring joy unto her hearts content,
And joy to all where joy she did reveal.
The fifth joyful mystery.
Containing our Ladies fynding of Christ in the temple.
Sequestered love does foster grief and joy,
Twixt fear of loss and hope of happy gain,
Such was her case that lost her little Boy,
Whose joy reuyn'd in fynding him again.
In Temple once buylt by the wysest king,
Where not til now the wise king took his place,
Who yet no kingly port did thither bring,
But wisdom vttred with a chyldish face.
With like in years she happily might him seek,
But did him find with doctors in dispute,
He left repose to fraudlesse minds and meek,
And took in hand wise folly to confute.
The first sorrowful mystery.
Containing the apprehension of Christ.
WOE worth that sorrow should succeed to joy,
Or for the il the good sustain the smart,
But since the son would suffer wrongs annoy,
The mother bears her undeserved part.
For when as he destrest in garden prayed,
And bloody sweat ran down his face amayne,
And Judas false him Iudasly betrayed,
Lost joy her left, betrayed unto pain.
And when with rage the Jews led him away.
Then anguish her surprys'd and led in thrall,
And all that out wardly on him they lay.
Does in wardly unto her heart befall.
The second sorrowful mystery.
Containing the scourging of Christ.
T'Apease the rage of causeless raging Jews,
false Pylate wild true Christ should scourged be,
Crime knew he none, and yet he did refuse,
unpunished to set the guiltless free.
Then was sweet Jesus to a pillar tide,
And helhoundes lasht at his fair tender skin,
Embrude with blood al round on every side,
Thinck then how stood th'aquyter of our sin.
And in what sorrow his poor moother stood,
For his great good, their so great il to view,
Her heart bled inward, and distild the blood,
Forth at her eyes, though altered in the hew.
The third sorrowful mystery.
Containing the crowning of Christ with a crown of thorn.
FOr change of torture not for ease of grief,
The Jews do from the pillar Christ unloose,
While his sad mothers hopes of his relief,
Increase her sorrow in his lengthned woes.
For they his dolor to deryde and scorn,
The king of kings in mockage king do call,
And on his head they fix a crown of thorn,
And in his hand a reed to rule withal.
Yiedling pure love impure dispight and hare,
Accursed rebels to a king of grace.
That purchase now the due disgraceful state,
Of their still kinglesse and contemptuous race.
The fourth sorrowful mystery.
Containing Christ his bearing of his Cross.
WHen Pylat pressed by the Jewish rage,
With wrested conscience gave the doom of death,
The Jews made have their fury to aswage,
In the extinguishing lyf-giuers breath.
And his deaths engyne, burden of his woe,
They make him bear, that him to bear they made.
Him in the way to death to tortur so,
Til they his fainting force, give forced aid.
Well may his mother mourn this to observe,
That from his burden lodes her mind with woes,
And he well ask what withered stocks deserve?
When fruteful trees are served so of those.
The fyft sorrowful mystery.
Containing the crucifying of Christ.
OH woe is me at this great end of grief,
Christ is arrived at his dying place,
Lamblyke he stands, bereft of all relief,
Subject of sorrow, vassal of disgrace.
For on his cross all naked they him nail,
And rear it up, and wound him in the ^yde,
Which all the blessed of heaven do be wayl,
While of the earth th'accursedst it deryde.
The sword of sorrow peirseth now the heart,
Of his lamenting mother in her dolor most,
Whose dear Sons sorrow, and surmounting smart,
Now takes an end, in yiedling of his ghost.
The first glorious mystery.
Containing the resurrection of Christ.
SVbdued sorrow glory now ensues,
For from the cross the soul of Christ descending*
Bringes to expecting souls the cheereful news,
Of heavens entrance, their de^ynments ending.
And to his corpse his ghost returned again,
Triumphant raises it from closed toombe,
Terror unto the actors of his pain,
Whose hate, and death, and hell, is overcome.
And glory that his sorrows now had chased,
Extinguished woe in his kind mothers heart,
And glory there and in all others placed,
That of his anguish had sustained part.
The second glorious mystery.
Containing the ascension of Christ into heaven.
WHen forty days the day had ouerpast,
Of that now life that Christ from death had taken,
He did resolve his heavens return at last,
To leave the world that had him first forsaken.
And having to his mother now appeered,
And also unto his apostles true.
Confirmd in faith, and in his glory cheered,
On Olive mount he biddes them all adieu.
And there liftes up himself to sacred blis,
Th'unworthy world no more him so retaynes,
And all the glory that in heaven is,
To him is yielded and to him remaynes.
The third glorious mystery.
Containing the coming down of the holy Ghost.
Placed in his throne and glorious chair of state,
Our loving Lord regardful of o^^ weal,
Would let no more then ten days run their date,
Ere he his keeping promis would reueal.
What time his mother and disciples bent,
In secret wise to invoke his name,
Down unto them his holy Ghost he sent,
With glorious fire their hearts for to inflame,
And to conioyne to his Church now begone,
That spirit of truth that ever must it guide,
In only truth, while shyneth any Sun,
Maugre the woorst, of daunted hellish pride.
The fourth glorious mystery.
Containing the assumption of our blessed Lady.
WHen hence to part the virgin did obtain,
The Hierarchies their due attendance gave,
To bring her sin-lesse soul to endless reign,
While saints on earth brought her pure corpse to grave.
Which therein laid, and found thence ^o be taken,
Makes piety to faith to recomend,
That soon her soul to earth returned again,
And took her corpse and did therewith ascend.
A due prerogative, and due alone,
Unto that body that had borne a child,
As never did, nor never shall do none,
That never was with thought of sin defyld.
The fyft glorious mystery.
Containing the coronation of our blessed Lady.
ASsumpted so with soul and corpse combyned,
As glorious as at last the blessed shal-bee,
And placed in her princely seat asygned,
Like (...) worthy self appeered she.
And that eternal ever three in one,
There crowned her the highest heavens Queen,
Where angels yielded honor to her throne,
As seemly might to her estate be seen.
And she that erst replenisht was with grace,
Now placed where grace flows out in plenties store,
Where as she sees her sons most gracious face,
And sues for such as sue to her therefore.
AVE MARIA.
HAil Marie, filled full of grace,
Our Lord remains with thee,
And thou among'st thy sexes race,
Remainest blessed to be.
And as thou blessed did become,
So did thou blessed bring,
The blessed fruit that from thy womb,
So blessedly did spring.
Both now and when we yield our ghost,
To him prefer our case,
Because his mercy lasts most,
And thou art full of grace.
EPITHETES OF OUR BLESSED LADY.
Templum Dei.
WHen God would from the heavens to earth his progres take,
No palace there he found, that might him entertain,
Save one rare edifice, which earthquake could not shake,
The woorthiest woork of praise, that might on earth remain.
Fair court of sanctity, made holier for his sake,
That thee the Temple made, his presence to conteyne:
O Temple where as God, voutsafed for to be,
Still may we him adore, adoring still in thee.
Porta Caeli.
WHen grace came from above, then wa'st thou made the gate,
By which it entered here, and brought the hope of blis,
Which hope in hearts of men, remains still in state,
And still through faith and love, alive preserved is:
Then since thou wa'st the door, for grace this to relate,
So art thou heavens gate, and well accords this,
That as God unto men, did thee his entrance make,
Men entrance unto God, again by thee may take.
Scale Caeli.
HOw may our heavy load, enclyning to descend,
Ascend up in the air, beyond the egles flight,
Except by such a guide, as will assistance lend,
And can from step to step, direct the passage right:
Or rather her own self, us better to defend,
The ladder will become, that scaleth heavens height,
By whose degrees of grace, to blis we may attain,
And in our mounting up, not to fall down again.
Electa vt Sol.
Brave ornament of heaven, and comforter of kind,
Of whom the shyning Sun, does but the shadow seem,
Which as it is elect, and has his place assygn'd,
Above the planets all in earthly eyes esteem,
Above all saints to thee, is woorthely resygn'd,
The seat in supreme blis, that best does thee beseem,
Where thy fair beauteous face, no foggy clouds can hyde,
But chosen there by grace, in beauty do abide.
Pulchra vt Luna.
WHen Ph^bus fyrie steedes, in compassing the ground,
Leave night behind their backs, til they again return,
Then that there should some light, in darcknes yet be found,
Fair Phobe stays behind, supplying Ph^bus turn:
Where she through borrowed light, in beauty does abound,
And cheers therewith the earth, that might in darcknes mourn,
So thy fair influence, fair Cynthia us extend,
Which thy most bounteous son, does thee most freely lend.
Stella Maris.
BRight shyning star by sea, in lands abandoned fight*
At once apparent seen, on either side the spherre,
The goodly guyd of all, and guyding all aright,
That in this raging sea, ensue thy brightness clear:
And bending not there course to such illuding light,
As may mislead to wrack, ear danger do apeer,
For thy direction leads, unto the port of rest,
Those guyded by thy self, whose guydance is the best.
Ciuitas Dei.
Fair City stately buylt, by singular deuyce,
Of that great Architeckt who is of greatest art,
With all those goodly stones that are esteemed of price,
Which to this fairest woork, their fairness do convert:
And through far aquaducts, from springes of paradise,
The waters thither led, which do refresh the heart,
And to octroy this town, with all-surpassing fame,
The buylder here himself, a Citizen became.
Turris David.
HIgh Tower of stately port, and far to be descried,
And far from thence again, the world about to view,
It self the sentinel, that therein does abide,
To give aduyce of foes, or danger to ensue:
Well furnished for defense, for e'ury time and tide,
For there a thousand sheilds are hanging on a rue,
Not weapons of offense, but for defense to be,
Of all such innocents, as from oppression flee.
Nauis Institoris.
IF certitude of gain, may stit the searching mind,
To venture in the ship, from whence misfortunes flee,
That governs the ^yde, and does comaund the wind,
And speedely returns, with goods that precious be,
The barck of blis is she, and fortunate by kind,
With grace she fraighted is, and is of custom free,
Taking but for her hyre, and her inritching trade,
Love of devoted minds, that rich by her are made.
Puteus Aquarum.
Clear well that ouerflowes, with water fresh and fine,
More pure then unicorn, could water ever make,
Made by the hand of him, that water turned to wine,
Who giving it the force, dry sorrow to aslake,
Made that it never should, to any drought enclyne,
But that at all assaies, men might refreshing take,
And our their healthes decay, in deadly agonies,
Since from the flud of life, the issue does atise.
Quasi plantatio Rosae in Jericho.
Even as the fragrant Rose, on prickling stalk does grow,
In fairness and sweet smell, and virtue to be seen,
And woorthyest to be worn, and well beseeming so,
In place of diadem, in garland of a Queen,
So thou which heaven did once, on bryry earth bestow,
In fairnes, smell, and force, and burgeo^s ever green,
Show that this goodly flower, may thy resemblance be,
Save in his vading kind, which cannot be in thee.
Lilium Conualium.
THe little lilly flower, that grows in the dale,
Leaves not in low degree, sweet fairnes for to show,
Which Solomon himself, could never counteruaile,
With all his gorgeous cost, he lyked to bestow;
So thou sweet smelling flower, whom sorrows did assail
And worlds esteem debase, to fortune that was low,
Did not therefore restrain, the splendure of thy face,
Nor now from heaven to earth, the greatness of thy grace.
Flos Campi.
THe fair flower of the field, the dayes-eye does apere,
When thence al flowers beside, retire and vade away,
For to this only slower, does each month of the year,
For comely beauties cause, become the month of may,
Bnt that dayes-eye in deed, which does all seasons cheer,
And keeps her beauty still, which no time can decay,
The dayes-eye is of day, where night may never be,
And thou celestial flower thy self art only she.
Lilium inter Spinas.
AMiddes a guard of thorn, this goodly lilly grew,
Defended from the foe, that would it feign deface,
Who near it to aproche, the entrance never knew,
With poison to infect, where filth had never place,
Yet such might be the hate, that heeron did ensue,
That he reserved revenge, unto succeeding space,
What time a crown of thorn, the sons head did sustain,
To make the mothers heart, be pricked with the pain.
Quasi Cedrus.
Like as the Cedar does, her nurs Libantis hill,
Pay with begotten fame, of her dear nowrishing,
In that so talle a tree, as all trees does excel,
Most stately there does stand, in verdure flourishing:
And does through savor sweet, serpents away expel,
So that high tree of blis, that from the earth did spring,
Unto the earth again, her sweetness does extend,
Il things to drive a way, that may the good offend.
Quasi Palma.
THrough burden of thy grief, long did thou live deprest,
Part-bearer of the woe, thy dear son did sustain,
But as it was a grief, to see him so destrest,
Love made it seem some joy to help to bear his pain:
Yet grief had never force, so far thee to molest,
That thou did virtue want, thy courage to maintain,
No more then is the palm, deprest by heavy weight,
Who does thereby the more, endeavor to be straight.
Quasi Cypressus.
Like to the Cypres tree, on holy Sion hill,
That fair and vncorrupt, in vigor does endure,
And with sweet smelling breath, her near aprocher fill,
And does for Temples yield, her timber ever pure,
So on that sacred mount, thou art remaining still,
And in that Temple wrought, whence grace men must procure,
And where aproching souls, do thy sweet sent rec^aue,
And where no su^er thou, do vnrelieued leave.
Quasi Oliua.
WHen earths foul face of sin, might not the heaven see,
The waters all did hyde, that unto earth pertayn'd,
Except the Arck wherein, few were reserved free,
There to expect the time, that mercy might be gayn'd,
From whence the hopeful Noe, a pigeon did let flee,
Who by an Olive branch, brought news that hope remayn'd,
So thou the Olive tree, whereout our joy did spring,
Becam'st the sign of joy, and joy it self did bring.
Quasi Platanus.
Like as the goodly plane, does beautify the field,
And far her root extend, more steadfast for to stay,
To make her farspred boughs refreshful shadow yield,
For trauelers repose, in hotest time of day,
So thou exalted art, of heaven to be beheld,
Where in assured state, thy boughs thou do's^ desplay,
To the refreshful shade, of trauelers desire,
That pas in dangers dread, of soul afflicting fire.
Hortus Conclusus.
Most pleasant garden plot, true Paradise of praise,
Erected in the room, of Paradise of iore,
But yet that garden far, exceeding sundry ways,
As perfect second works, exceed things wrought before:
All closely walled about, inmolate it stays,
No serpent can get in, nor shall for evermore,
All goodly flowers and fru^^s, here in perfection grow,
Virtue on stocks of grace, has them engraffed so.
Fons signatus.
PVre ^ountaine surely sealed, from each infectious thing.
Whose water does exceed, the taste of Nectar sweet,
And in two milk-whyte streams, did issue out and spring,
And for one only taste, allowed to be meet,
Who by diuineful power, did to it virtue bring,
That turned it to a red, whose color could not fleet,
And taken from thy breast, did yield it from his side,
To salve the sins of men, when on the cross he died.
Speculum sine Macula.
Clear crystal erst conseald, in rock of heavens height,
Was framed into a glass, to mirror virtues face,
Whence lookers on receive, conseruatiue of sight,
And can no spot espy, to make it bear disgrace:
But serves as a book, and moves much delight,
By pureness therein seen, impurenesse to deface,
And sacred was the skill, that pullisht it so clear,
That through it unto men, salvation did appear.
L'enuoy.
LEt not offense mistake dispraising this my praise,
As to dispraise the same, in deeming it too much,
Whose worth demands more, of duty many ways*
And does deserve dispraise, in that it is not such,
But since devotion has, afforded these assayes,
Let not vncaus'd offense, all causeless seem to grutch,
For heaven did by behest, most blessed her ordain,
And she ordayn'd her praise, successyue to remain.
FINIS.

A REPREHENSION OF THE REPREHENDING of our ladies praise.
FIE foul contempt of self-defyling breath.
That dare disgorge, against so great purity.
The poisson issued from defect of faith,
To serve to witness thy impiety.
Whence can it come but from infernal hat^
That earth-bred wretches are become to brag,
As Gods own mothers glory to abate,
To call and count her but a saffron bag.
Or that a ^il the subject unto sin
Dare equalize her self as good as she,
In whom no thought impure has ever bin,
Or least of purenesse-want might ever be.
No Saint or Angel ever taught them this,
For heaven did her entytle full of grace,
And her conception of the king of blis
Her high regard comends to every race.
Her self of her own praise was prophetess,
And of the races that should it conserve,
Needs must they then her euer-praise profess
That love and law enuyteth to observe.
The honor to a mother such as she
To such a son must argue greater love,
Which may not unto him offensive be,
In whom kind love can it no less approve.
But hatred of her laud may never grow
Of zeal that love unto her son may raise,
Nor can the child his love on such bestow,
As kindle hatred at the mothers praise.
He which is mighty her has magnifyde,
Let faithful then her ever magnify,
While the unfaithful in conceit abide,
Of doing well her praises to deny.
And let performance of her worthy praise,
Of her praise-yeilding race remain the sign,
That so the blame that for it others raise,
Become the marck of their dissenting line.
And let contempt of her with such abide,
As pay in hell the tribute of their pride.
THE TRIVMPHE OF feminyne Saints.
THe trump of fame soundes forth the factes,
Of wel-deseruing wights:
And kings with honor do reward,
The service of their knights.
Of such therefore I ceas to sing,
My song of such to frame:
Whose meed restes in no princes power,
Nor praise in earthly fame.
And of the sex of woman kind,
Though not of those of yore:
With seared breasts against their foes,
That warlyke armor wore.
But such as armed were with faith,
Against soul-killing evil:
And did in combat overcome,
The flesh, the world, and devil.
And for thy love o Jesus Christ,
And glory of thy name:
That found no woes to be endured,
But did endure the same.
Their faith did bring them to endure,
Endurance blis did bring:
In blis they now do sing to thee,
Now here of them I sing.
Unheard it was in earth before,
Unsounded forth by ^ame:
Unknown that ere in silly sex
Such resolution came.
Til will and virtue did conioyne,
In choice of chiefest good:
And grace gave aid, and faith gained force,
And nothing it withstood.
As Teela first example gives,
Whom fire could not annoy:
And bears and lions left unhurt,
Each other to destroy.
Fierce rigor woorking rigours ruth,
No hurt the hurtlesse find:
Yet she a martres is estem'd,
That martred was in mind.
Euphemia thrown to savage beasts,
By men of beastly mood:
Found beasts deuoyd of savageness,
And men more thirsting blood.
And all the torments that she had,
To her not seemed pain:
But when a sword transpearst her corpse,
True glory was her gain.
The noble Anastatia,
Poor christians did relieve:
Whose heath nish husband her therefore,
Unkindly did agrieue.
But when the sword and cruel death,
Did her from thralle release:
The heavens her freedom did restore,
With endless joy and peace.
Besides this Anastatia,
A martres and a wife:
Two virgins of like name and faith,
Lost each like wise their life.
The elder that most pains endured,
Most is her glory spread:
That losing first, paps, hands and feet,
Did lastly lose her head.
Mylde Dorothey endured much,
And died by dint of sword:
Whose suffrance did her love approve,
To her dear loving Lord.
She dead, to him Th^^-phil^^.
sweet roses sent,
That dying did her scorn:
Which moved him her to ensue,
That else had been forlorn.
Erasma in her faiths defense,
Did wade through many a woe:
Until the hedsman ended all,
In his death-bringing blow.
And with this virgin, virgins three,
Did gladly yield to die:
So selling life at rate of death,
Vndying life to buy.
Seraphia her settled love,
To Christ was so entyre:
That strokes with cudgels she sustaind,
And burning flames of fire.
And last of all, her life and all,
For his dear love she left:
And gaynd an euer-lyuing life,
In steed of that was reft.
Sabi^a nobly did ensue,
Seraphia noble dame:
Yet nobler either in their acts,
Then only in there name.
Refusing of ungodly gods,
The service to fulfill:
She rather yielded to the sword,
Then to the pagans will.
As Authia the woes beheld,
Which were by tyrants done:
Unto the constant Bishop Eleuth^rius.
,
Her so wel-beloued son.
She joyed to have so good a child,
For Christ to suffer smart:
But when with him she strangled was,
Then ioyed most her heart.
Affra in turning unto Christ,
Turned from a life impure:
And for his love the fyres fierce flame,
Was willing to endure.
And to a stake when she was tied,
Even as the fire was made:
I give the thanks o God for this,
This glorious martres said.
Sincere was Simphorosas faith,
As did by deeds appear:
In gayning unto her belief,
Her spouse and children dear.
And with her husband to accord,
And sons in number seven:
To live in Christ to die for Christ,
To love and live in heaven.
Fides and Spes and Charitas,
Borne of S^p^^^ sage.
Ripe in their faith and forti^^d^,
Though green in years of age.
Were whipped, thrust in boiling pitche,
And hedded afterward:
Whose worth the world of right admyres,
And heaven does reward.
When blessed Blandina had the rack,
And sundry tortures past:
Unto a bull wrapped in a net,
She was with fury cast.
And when of this so feirce a beast,
No harm she could receive:
Then with the sword, men woors then beasts.
Did her of life bereave.
Potamina a noble Dame,
Was with her mother Marcella.
brent:
When fearing-threates nor ^uries ^orce,
Might move her to relent.
She being dead to him Basilides.
app^^rd,
That her did aid in death:
Whereby he turning unto Christ,
Was martred for h^s faith.
Thryce happy was Felicitas,
Tha^ happily did see:
Her sons her sayings to ensue,
And of her faith to be.
And for the same by diverse deaths,
A deathles life renew:
Which by the sword she lastly gaynd,
And so did them (...).
The maid Martina being led
Appollo (...) adore:
The Idol of it self fell down,
As she it came before.
A Lion unto her they put,
Her body they did wound:
And by the sword her life she lost,
And life thereby she found.
To offer to the Idol Gods,
Cecilia did refuse:
And contumelies, pains, and death,
Contented was to choose.
And in a skalding caldron cast,
And thryce struck with the sword:
Attayning so unto the joys,
The heavens do afford.
Fair Agatha in beauty rare,
And wealth did both abound:
But virtue which is more of worth,
Might more in her be found.
Unhurt on Irons hot she stood,
Cut of were both her paps:
Her life she left, and gained blis,
So ending al mishaps.
The loyal Appollonia.
Withstood the pagan laws:
For which with violence her teeth,
Were torn from out her jaws.
And when for her a burning fire,
The helhoundes did provide,
Into the same she went her self,
And constantly she died.
Russi^^ and Sec^n^^ both,
Sisters and virgins were:
Both living in the love of God,
And dying in his fear.
From sundry sorrows which they (...),
The sword did them release:
And life and joy forth with began,
As woe and death did cease.
Basilia having fixed her love,
Where love is best beloved:
Took no regard of carnal love,
By fond affection moved.
To Christ she vowed chastity,
And being forced to choose
A heathens love, or loss of life,
To live she did refuse.
Eugenia worthy well her name,
Not of Dianaes train:
To offer therefore did refuse,
Unto her Idol vain.
She drowned not tied to a stone,
And in the Tiber cast:
But on a Christmas day to Christ,
By dint of sword she past.
Concordia with the heavens in peace,
And with the earth at stryf:
With blows was beaten unto death,
And ended so her life.
United fast in faith and hope,
And Charities accord:
She died here in perfect p^ace,
And so lives with her lord.
Pure Margares a prised pearl,
For Christ himself to buy:
In tender years embraced his love,
A^^ for his law did die.
The devilish dragon burst in twain^,
That meant her to destroy:
Her death and sorrows here but short,
Brought life and lasting joy.
Columbae sixteen years of age,
Resolved a chaste intent:
Whose vow to Christ a loose yongman,
To violate was sent.
But him a savage bear had slain,
Had she not stayed the force:
A virgin martres so she did,
And he obtayn'd remorce.
Theodosia martirs did salute,
As at the bar they stood:
And prayed them pray for her to him,
For whom they shed there blood.
For which the ireful judge ordaynd,
To tear her breasts a way:
And to rent open both her sides,
And cast her in the sea.
Sweet Catharin beloved of Christ,
To Christ was constant seen:
In leaving for his only love,
To be a crowned Queen.
Yet crowned she was with martyrdom,
When torments from her fled:
And Angels bore her ghost to blis.
When she had lost her head.
The true believing Barbara,
Falls Gods would not adore:
And lost her fathers woorthlesse love,
For Christ his love and lore:
Strange torments he on her imposed,
And in straight prison hild:
And lastly her his only child,
With his own hands he killed.
Young Agnes aged thirteen years
In Christ reposed her trust:
And not for favor nor for force,
Would yield to ought unjust.
No harm she had, when in the fire,
She thrown was by her foes:
And with a sword thrust through her neck,
Were ended all her woes.
Christina fair and noble maid,
Did unto Christ obey:
For which she ^y'd unto a stone,
Was cast into the sea.
But Angels aided her to land,
Where she more woes did taste:
And as an arrow struck her heart,
Her soul to heaven paste.
When Fausta in her faithful mind,
Resolved did remain:
The Idol priest wild with a saw,
To cut her corpse in twain.
But when he saw it hurt her not,
He in her faith affied:
And comfort from the heavens received,
With her when as he dyed.
^udelia many did convert,
Unto her lords belief:
Which in the Persian pagans did
Enkindle irefull grief.
Unto the Sun she would not pray,
Nor yet the fire adore:
And had the skin flead from her face,
And lastly died therefore.
Sout Iuli^na did endure.
The torments of the evil:
And did in combat overcome,
Th'accursed cruel devil.
And after all her conquests gaynd,
Then gained she renown:
For by the sword unto her due,
Remaynd a martirs crown.
Victoria well might called be,
That worthy minded maid:
That in her self subdued sin,
With courage vndismayd.
And gained virgins unto Christ,
And acts of wonder wrought:
And did by martyrdom attain,
The garland that she sought.
Because the Idols to adore,
Lucia did refuse:
She threatened was she should be thrust,
Into the common stews.
No no quoth she; the mind being pure,
The body is vnstaynd:
Then with the sword she martrid was,
And glory so she gaynd.
To Fortunata for her faith,
Much evil did betyd:

From whence her savior pleased:
To call her blessed soul to blis,
Where with her woes were eased.
Febronia with resolved force,
For chastity and faith:
Endured with patience to the end,
The woorst of tyrants wrath.

Teeths loss, and either breast,
And with the sword all loss of woe,
And gain of lasting rest.
Macra a maid of heavenly mind,
No earthly things did move:
For prison, fire, nor loss of breasts,

To paradise did pas.
Z^a a glorious martyrs Nicostr^tus.

Before the altar prayed:

The faithful had conuayd.

Was hanged on a tree:
Both by her he^^^, and by her neck,
And so her crown had she.
Charitina with fire annoyd,
And cast into the seas:
Came forth and had no hurt at all*
Nor feeling* of unease.
Then were her hands and feet cut of,
But he whom she did love:
Even as she prayed, received her ghost,
Into his joys above.
Eulalia ardent in her zeal,
Unto her loving lord:
To suffer torments many ways,
Most midly did accord.
And lastly in the burning fire,
Lauding his holy name:
To him her soul she sacryfys'd,
And died in the ^lame.
The like in love the like in zeal,
In some succeeding space:
A second good Eulali^ was,
A like endu'd with grace.
The rack she felt, and sundry grieves,
The last; of life the loss:
When foes of Christ, for faith of Christ,
Did nail her on a cross.
While Emer^^^i^na. yet

And unto happy heauen^ joys,
Her ghost straight was conveyed.
Chaste Theodora to the stews,
To be deflowred led:

And with him yielded breath.

Her neck unto the sword.

As she that false defamed was,
And first did bear her name.

And lived in his lore:
And for the same she lost her head,
And gained heaven therefore.
Imprisned Leocadia long.
Did for her faith remain:
Whose faithful mind remained free,
In most afflicting pain.
Til God at length for her release,
Her ghost took thence away:
Her suffrance by a martirs crown,
In glory to repay.
The virgin Bibiana was,
Established in belief:
Which faithless foes could not subvert,
By guerdon nor by grief.
So long her body lashed was.
With knotted whips with lead:
That her sweet soul to heaven past,
And left it lying dead.
Euphrasia with more maidens chaste,
In place unchaste was placed:
But he their purity preserved,
That purely him embraced.
Then by their death-contryuing-crue,
Stones to their nectes were bound,
And so into the water cast,
The innocents were drowned.
Antonia had her tender limbs
Beyond all measure payned,
And three days hanged by one arm,
Most constant still remained.
And two years having prisned been,
Received at last her hyre,
What time her soul her body left
Consuming in the fire.
Lucretia, not that Lucres once
Which did her self destroy,
Did for true faith and faithful love,
Bear wrongful griefs annoy.
The one in earth her glory left,
The other in heaven and earth:
Because more worthy was the cause,
Why she endured death.

Constantly^yeilded breath.

With Leonilla* of that lore,
And settled Secund^^a.

Did bring to Christ his love:
And Reparata (dead) whose ghost,
Ascended like a dove.
Fair Flora and Maria both,
And Fla^ia Do^itilla:
Good Dula and Demetria,
Gaudentia and Lucilla.
With Alexandra six beside,
For Christ their blood have spent:
And Ciriaca and fy^e more,
With bodies rac'd and rent.
With other martyresses twelve,
Theodosia went to heaven:
Even as at S^^irna for that cause,
Died holy virgins seven.
Six that were called Cand^da,
Gave beauty to that name.
More fairer far then ^t self ^ound,
Does signify the same.
Some married were and some were maids,
Their suffrance sundry ways:
There cause all one, their only king,
Did all to glory raise.
Seven of the name of Iulia,
Did one of them ensue:
Whereby eight martirs glorious crowns,
To this one name is due.
And of the name Iustina five,
As of Pelagia were?
Of Martiana there were three,
Whose count Valer^^ bear.
Of this most glorious troop and rank,
Of martrid woomen-kynde:
I shall not need to recon more,
Though many more I find,
For even as these, rehearsed here,
There cross with Christ sustayn'd:
So did the rest, and all with Christ,
Al glory have obtayn'd.
In sundry regions of the earth,
Full many more beside,
For faith, for vow, for zeal to Christ^,
Full gloriously have did.
Chaste VV^^n^frid did feel of death,
The bloody stroke and sting.
As Dymp^a of her father did,
A pagan Irish King.
With soul and body vndefyld,
In endless life to reign:
Good Vrsula, and all her troop,
Endured to be slain,
And C^rdula that hid her self,
Her life thereby to save*
Came forth and yielded unto death,
Her life thereby to have.
To bring the number in accomp^,
Unable is my skill:
Of all such glorious martirs names,
And their endured il.
But in the Lamb his book of life,
No one omitted is:
Nor no one woe that they sustaynd*
Vnrecompenst in bli^.
No more then their formenter^ miss,
Their just reward in hell:
For each inflicted grief and smart,
Wherewith they them did quel.
Exyl'd those wretches are from heaven,
And odious dead in earth:
Yet in helles horror never die,
Though ever feeling death.
Mean while, the chosen saints of God,
In heaven ever live:
And ever glory unto him,
In all rejoicing give.
Al clad in white for purity,
Each with a golden crown:
And bearing palms of victory,
As enseignes of renown.
No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
No heart of man conceived:
No sight, no sound, no thought of joy,
As now they have received.
All griefs are now extinguished,
All sorrows have ^n end:
No tears can fall from weeping eyes,
Nor sighs from heart ascend.
O g^orio^^ troop, whose praise the heavens,
With melody refou^^ (...)
Accept that we as c^coes here,
Yield noise unto the sound.
And when for your true followed faith,
We any woe sustain:
Our constant suffrance of the same,
Voutsafe of God obtain.
Deo gratiae.
A RESEMBLANCE OF MARTYRS.
BEfore the craggy flint
Meets with the hardened steel,
It seems not to conteyne,
The virtue it conteynes,
But when it does the stroke
Of swift encountering feel,
Even then the force appeers,
That hid in it remains,
Right so resolved minds,
Through wicked fortunes wheel,
Encountering with mis^ap,
And feeling bitter pains.
Make fire of sacred Jove,
From ardent zeal proceed:
Which mounting up to heaven,
Does all the Stars exceed.
TE DEVM LAVDAMVS, OR The song of S. Ambrose, and S. Augustyne.
TO thee O God we praises give,
We thee our Lord confess
Eternal father, all the earth,
Adores thy woorthynesse.
The Angels, heavens, and heavenly powers,
Yield praises all to thee:
The Cherubinnes, and Scraphinnes,
Sound out incessantly.
O holy, holy, holy, Lord.
O God of Sabbath,
Thy glorious majesty repleates,
The earth and heaven both.
To thee the quyre so glorious,
Of thy Apostles all,
To thee the number woorthy-praise,
Of prophets cry and call.
The army of thy martirs bright,
Thy praises do express:
Thy holy Church through-out the earth,
Does thee o Lord confess.
Father of endless Majesty,
Thy only Son withal,
Together with the Holy Ghost,
Comforter of us all.
Thou King of glory art O Christ,
And ere the earth begone,
Thou of thy father did remain,
His ever being Son.
Thy willingness man to releas,
Made thee in earth to come:
And for that cause not to abhor,
Thy maiden-mothers woombe.
And when the sting of cruel death,
By the was vanuisht quyght,
Thou opned'st then thee realm of blis,
To each believing wight.
In glory of the father thou,
Do sit at Gods right hand:
We hold thee for the judge by whom,
Our causes must be skand.
We humbly therefore thee desire,
Voutsafe thy servants aid:
Of whom with thy most precious blood,
The ransomes thou have paid.
O make that we rewarded be,
With thy deer saints in blis:
Even with thy glory and thy grace,
Which ever during is.
Thy people and thine heritage,
O Lord save and defend:
And govern them, and still their praise,
In altitude extend.
And from offending thee by sin,
This day do thou us save:
And mercy have on us O Lord,
Lord on us mercy have.
And as our trust in thee has been,
Such let thy mercy be:
Confounded let me not become,
That hoped have in thee.
HOW GOD IN ALL AGES has bin served with Sacrifise.
Sacrificium sub lege Naturae.
WHen God created man, and rule unto him gave,
Of creatures all on earth, and every earthly thing,
And knowledge of his God, did in his heart engraue,
Subjection so to know, unto his sovereign King:
Then for to know and yield, what homage he would have,
Nature by her instinckt, unto his mind did bring,
And Sacrifise it was, and well accepted than,
Thus man's adoring God, with sacrifise began.
Sacrificium sub lege Moses.
When from the hows of thralle, through aid of heau'uly might
Gods people were led forth, by Moysis then their guyd,
For this new freedom found, it rested that of right,
God with augmented thanks, must now be gratifyde:
And him to honor more, in more then wonted plight,
Old Sacrifise was now, with new rytes beautifyde,
So for more good received, more gratitude did rise,
Which still to God was don, in doing sacrifise.
Sacrificium sub lege Euangelica.
When Gods dear Son from heaven, did unto earth desced,
Lost love of God again, for man's release to win,
Himself in sacrifise, blood-sacrifise did end,
When his high prised blood, did satisfy for sin:
But since Gods service must on sacrifise depend,
He changed, not took away, what faith did first begin,
And did ordain himself, in Sacramental wise
To be to God for man, a sovereign sacrifise,
SAINT PEETERS COMFORT.
Even there where sin, my silly soul defyld,
Shame bad me hy, and seek to hyde my face,
Foul face of mine, that that fair face behild,
And could my so well knowing it out face,
And make himself even whom I did deny,
True witness, unto my falls perjury.
I scarsly was gone forth out of the halle,
When sorrow straight my soul did apprehend,
Poor soul of mine, deseruer of thy thralle,
Whose fault no manner skuses can defend,
Only unfeigned tears, told my destresse
And with my grief declared my guiltiness.
In sorrows iayle, thus captive did I ly,
And there lament, and there my case complain,
And there did pity ouer-heare my cry,
And did in my behalf access obtain,
To sue to him whom I denied to know,
To let him know my grief for doing so.
Who daigning then upon my heart to look,
upon my heart, the spectacle of woe,
He there-vpon so great compassion took,
That he on it sweet mercy did bestow,
Sweet mercy, that it self so far extends,
As to accept contrition for amends.
And that the world here of might witness be,
His mercy renouated al his love,
The Effects whereof all men in me might see,
But none more then my self did ever prove,
The good I had before, that still I hild,
Only my guylt he only has annild.
For where my soul for mercy only sought,
It mercy found, even in the most degree,
And mercy love with it united brought,
Deer love, my dying souls restauratie,
Life of my life, which did me now restore,
To lively strength, which I did lack before.
The wound is healed, yet must the skar remain,
The skar my still remembrance of the sore,
For which, kind grief still will I entertain,
That never may sufficiently deplore,
Kynd-grief it is, close in my heart it lies,
To urge the euer-dutie of mine eyes.
For though my heart all comfort have received,
That heavens comfort did on it bestow,
Yet can it not of that grief be bereaved,
That does even out of that self comfort grow,
For in admyring so great grace extended,
I grieve that I so sweet a Christ offended.
My dearest Lord, oh might I die for thee,
That bragged to die with thee, and the denied,
By thy strong aid I must assisted be,
For never thought shall in my breast abide,
To say I will, and not assistance crave,
Because my will, must thy will also have.
That sheep was I which did his way mistake,
And he the shepherd that recalled me,
Of me his mercies-miracle to make,
By abling me his deputy to be,
For he my self a shepherd did ordain,
That not deserved to be a shepherds swain.
Thus not my cry me and punishment therefore,
His pardon only stretched to deface,
But he me raised to what I was before,
And did renew and ampliphy his grace,
And I that fell the lowest of eleauen,
Still hold my charge to keep the keys of heaven.
The Rock of stone he has confirmed me,
VVhereon the buylding stands that cannot fail,
Against which helles puissance and superbitie,
May offer force, but never shall preuail,
Thus I that late through feeble fainthes fell,
Support the force, that breaks the force of hell.
Do thou me love, thryce did he ask of me,
In three demaundes of feigned doubtfulnes,
For what my love to him was bound to be,
And what it was, I needed not express,
Well he it wist, and would but let me see,
By such demaundes, how well he loved me.
And more then these; do thou me love quoth he,
God wot more cause had I my Lord to love,
Yet such he did allow my love to be,
As that it did a more reward behooue:
Giving to me the office for my meed,
At parting hence; his lambs and sheep to feed.
Love is my debt, for love and mercy due,
And gratitude the intrest thereon rising.
The obligation stands in heavens view.
And was set down by equities devising.
The date it bears is endless to auail,
My soul the pawn to forfait if I fail.
Performance of thy promis Lord I see,
Strengthened am I, my brethren strength to give,
My faith shall never fail thou warrant'st me,
Then in my mouth truth must for ever live,
And though I die; succession will supply,
Vndying truth, unto posterity.
And all the graces thou have given to me,
To bynd and lose the free and bond of sin,
Must not in my liues-ending ended be,
Though by thy gift they do in me begin,
But in successiue power remain for ever.
To yield the lasting graces of the giver.
O endless comfort ending thus my care,
Vn-ending thanks must therefore be my part,
Which for thy due, I duly will prepare,
To offer on the Alter of my heart,
Whereas the sire of love for ever lies,
To serve for my eternal sacrifise.
SACRVM CONVIVIVM.
WHen time approached that the lamb of life
Must yield himself among the wolves to die,
Who did repay his peace with mortal stryf,
And his meek patience with most cruelty,
Then in the space that yet to him remaynd,
For his few freindes his fare-wel he ordaynd.
It was the night before the dismol day,
He caused prepare his last and fare-wel feast,
Desyr'd before, deferred by delay,
Delayed well, to time befitting best,
For words and deeds, at parting done or said
In memories conseruance best are laid.
And as his will, and custom had decreed,
That at this feast a lamb must be the meat,
So he that was th'unspotted lamb indeed,
Gave them therein, his Image for to eat:
Retayning yet for their more greater good,
Far better meat then his self-seeming food.
For that no sooner was the Paschal donn^
And custom and their bodies satisfied
But that eft soones another feast begone
And of a lamb, and that before he died
Himself was he, and he himself did give
Eaten to be, the while himself did live.
Which to ordain, he bread and wine did take,
And with his sacred breath did bless the same,
And did thereof his blood and body make.
Through that self might that all of naught did frame,
And could not now be destitute of art,
One thing into an other to convert.
And as the lamb their bodies had suffys'd,
The true Lambs body turned into bread,
Was now the supper for their souls deuys'd,
True bread of life alive and seeming dead,
Flesh of his flesh, bread his true body made,
When as eternal truth the word had said.
Take eat this is my body, were the words,
Which vnrepugnant hearts did so receive,
For humble faith gainsaying not affoordes,
And well they wist he would them not deceive,
And in his wisdom he right well foreknew.
What faith their would, and should heeron ensue.
For from that instant, in succeeding space,
In en'ury region that is far or ny
Where Christian lore did paganism displace,
As all foregoing times do testify,
Thus was the faith, this is the faith of old,
Held by the whole, now by the part controld.
Christ said not, eat this in my memory,
But that his body take and eat they should,
Nor said he that it did him signify,
But was himself that for them give he would,
His truth and justice could not bear the stain,
One thing to say, and it unsay again.
And for he would that those whose souls he fed,
By his example so should others feed,
Least but themselves none might be nowrished,
His plenteous goodness hereupon decreed,
That they in memory of him lyke-wise,
Should with like food, like faithful souls suffyse
Hence is descended that successyue power,
Of celebrating this soule-feeding feast,
And that remaining reverence to this hour,
As elder times devotion has expressed,
And hence it comes, that to our lasting joy,
This heavenly meat our souls on earth enjoy.
And as by kind, loues-grief increases love,
So love that caused, that God with men did live,
Caused that for love he did great sorrow prove,
Whose sorrow to his love more force did give.
And so less wonder his great love did move,
To leave himself the caution of his love.
Thus comes it that the seeming bread we see,
Is that same corpse our savior Christ had here,
Yet not in that self manner is it he,
But as in covert veil so does apeere;
His body true, in Sacramental wise,
Beheld by faith more then by earthly eyes.
And as he had his body at his will,
When doors and walls against it could not resist,
But did it use, and yet no place did fill.
And wrought therewith such woonders as him list,
So still remains, his will, his word, and might,
In heaven and earth, in his all power-ful plight.
His body does his soul import withal,
A body by effect of sacred sawes,
A soul by sequel which is natural,
Conioynd in one, by his efficient cause,
Touchstone of fath whereby God would us teach
His heavenly works exceed our earthly reatch.
And when our souls presume unto this feast,
In clean atyre they must themselves present,
(Least else they fare as the unwelcome gest,
That il atyred to the wedding went)
That so this bread of life such virtue give,
That eating it, with it we ever live.
And that esteem and condign reverence,
That grave Antiquity of duty gave,
Unto a thing of so great excellence,
Let in all ensuyng seasons have,
And live that faith, whereof Christ gave the ground,
As long as faith may on the earth be found.
A COMPLAINT OF S. MArie Magdalen. At her not fynding Christ in his sepulcher.
A Las my Lord is gone,
How must I now deplore,
Where may he be that is each where,
And I him see no more.
Hope led me here to seek
Recure of my destresse,
But sorrow here has sought me out,
And found me comfortless.
Here life late seemed dead,
Head dead I seem alive,
It is my death him thus to miss,
That may my life reuyue.
Ye windows on my face,
That serve me not to see,
Serve now of water stild of woe,
The conducts for to be.
Instead him to anoint,
Whom here I cannot have,
Make that the plenty of my tears,
May ouerflow his grave.
Perhaps it may him move,
His presence to imparte,
To see how moistning these dry stones,
I therewith dry my heart.
Good Gardner that art here,
To keep this garden place,
Lo how I water al thy plants,
With rain fallen from my face.
Be grateful for this good,
And tell me I thee pray,
Where is he laid if so thy self,
Haste carried him away.
If it have troobled thee.
Here to afford him room,
O let me know but where he is,
My heart shall be his toombe.
And thou thereon may write,
This epitaph in verse,
Here life that lately lay for dead.
Lives and reuyues his hearse.
OF THE INVENTION, OR fynding of the Cross of Christ.
IN Britain soil fair Helena was bred,
The worthy Empress of the world of yore,
The cause that Yorck. Romes glory more did spread,
Then Rome it self could ever spread before,
There was she borne, and there she brought him forth,
That brought Rooms diade me to greatest worth.
To greatest worth for that he it adorned,
Even with the Cross in middle top of all,
Raising to honor that which pagans scorned,
And honoring therein him self withal,
Whose title now, Great Constantyne became,
First Roman Emperor of Christian name.
Good Siluister that sat in Peeters chair,
Succeeding those that all had suffered death,
Now to salvation did the soul prepare,
Of Constantyne by teaching him the faith,
Whereby himself an endless life might have,
Whose now conversion many lives did save.
For when his mercy, mercy him had gained,
And he in sacred font had bathed bin,
His soul and bodies weal he both obtained,
In being cured of leprosy and sin,
Then that the more he might Christ's glory rear
He on his creast his cognizance did wear,
It was the sign that heaven to him did show,
For patron of the ensign he should bear,
When against Maxentius he in arms did go,
And unto his encouragement did hear,
An Angels voice, that in the air did cry,
Thou in this sign shall have the victory.
All which did so this noble moother move
To due esteem of such a sacred sign,
As this of him, that so much merits love.
To whom her hearts dear love she did resign,
That ardent zeal, did animate her mind,
To seek where she his hidden cross might find.
Led by desire that kindled was of love,
She took her voyage to the holy land,
Faith was her guide, hope did her will approve,
Speed did assist, to what she took in hand.
Desire, and love, and faith, and hope, and speed,
Did all concur, to her deserving meede.
And as her feet did travail on the ground,
Her inward mind did up to heaven stie,
Where the right holy land was to be found,
Of him whose presence this did sanctify.
So what in earth her bodies travail sought,
In heaven her mind in more perfection wrought.
And there high God beholding her intent,
And knowing well whereto devotion tends,
And that it all unto himself is meant,
That unto ought approaching him intends,
Did even accept her ardent fervor futch,
As erst her faith that did his vesture tutch.
And so concurred to what she went about,
That his hid cross so hidden might not be,
But she at last it happily found out,
Though doubtful which the right one was of three,
Until a corpse laid on it; did renyue,
Showing withal; her faith to be alive.
It was the third day of the month of May.
The worlds fair may pole thus was found again,
And now reared up that long obscured lay,
As if reserved for her own honors gain,
whom faith, and love, and hope, and zeal, did raise,
To raise therein her glorious fame and praise.
L'ENVOY.
Sometime the Cross as sundry records tell,
Deryuing virtue from our Saviors death,
Has had the force, the devil to expel,
And by the same confirmed Christian faith,
But now it seems, faith has sustained loss,
Because the devil has chaste away the cross.
COMPLAINT OF CHVRCH CONTROVERSY.
THe golden world long since is worn away,
As now the golden year has taken end,
The Iron world does still remain and stay,
And in his rust does to his ruin tend,
And in the show of virtue and of truth,
Seeme-good seeme-gospel turns all to ruthe.
At Babel tower where tounges confusion came,
It stayed the woork that fond advice begun,
But fond advice now seeks to disframe,
A tabernacle seated in the Sun,
And tounges confusion Church-war has procured
Lately begun and yet to long endured.
True yet it is that strife has ever been,
Twixt good and il in deadly feud depending,
But never such confusion has bin seen,
Nor diffrent numbers in so great contending,
As in our days when each one truth does claim,
And of untruth each does each other blame.
While Truth herself the heavens begotten child
And glorious imp of high Antiquity,
Lies ouertrod and under foot defyld,
By each and all that woork her inury,
All disagreeing in their own truth claming,
Yet all agreeing in truths false defaming.
God (...) good corn did cast into the ground,
But soon the devil threw in cockle there,
God first his Church on earth did firmly found,
Where straight the devil did his chapel rear,
God unto Truth the formoste place assygnd,
And fall hood with the devil came behynd.
When God in Adam had his Temple buylt,
The serpents synagog began in Eve.
Good Abels blood his wicked brother spilt,
At his Gods-woorship diuel-taught to grieve,
So soon began illes envy unto good,
Two only borne; one sheddes the others blood.
Through Moses God did give his Church a law,
And Chores crew against it did rebel,
Hating to live in order and in aw,
With their misleader went alive to hell,
They claymed truth, rejecting right of his,
And served the diu'l in serving God amiss.
Saint Peeter did ensue his masters lore,
Which Simon Magus, stoutly did withstand,
And that great pastor greatly hate therefore,
But firstborn truth obtayn'd the upper hand,
And that falls Prophet mounting up in pride,
Fell down out of the air to earth and did.
In ancient paths trod by our elders feet,
The way is found which is to rest assygnd,
But self-sought by ways for self-choosers meet,
They ever seek that seeking never find,
Blind guydes they be, guyders of blind they seem,
And with them fall ere they of danger deem.
To mend amiss was ever woork well done,
In faults and manners of Church-mennes abusion,
But by no prophet ever was begone,
Reforming of abuses by confusion,
Nor for some faults grown through Church-me^nes defect.
No good man ever did new Church erect.
Il thrift may to that builder well befall,
That will a faire-built edifice deface,
And with the rubbish of the broken wall,
Erect some cottage in an obscure place,
And to adorn it with usurped fame,
Gives it the title of the others name.
Must now an vpstart Martin or a John,
In question call the firm fidelity,
Of her whose pallas on a rock of stone,
Presents the picture of her chastity?
Who was of heaven, and earth long heild in grace,
Ere ought was heard of this new-risen race.
Why has not else each man like priuelege,
To chop to change, to found what faith he list,
And wrested scripture for his proofs aleage,
And against a world in self conceit persist,
And say all say amiss, except as he,
And all his words Gods word and Ghospel be.
If free it be for one its free for all,
For all can claim the like instinct of spirit,
But shrewd suspicion does apeere withal,
That of falls prophets all the name do merit,
Their fruit is il, themselves were never sent,
They come to late, to soon to such intent.
Susanna like, they Christ his Spouse accuse,
And will both judges and accusers be.
But like as Daniel falsehood did confuse,
By untruth found in contrariety,
So contradictions in these falls accusers,
Shows them to be, the world and her abusers.
And as the spryte of God did Daniel move,
The innocent accused to defend,
The spirit of God his dear spowse so does love,
That to her falls accusers in thee end,
In steed of casten stones their blood to spil,
They against the rock themselves shall cast and kill.
AN EPIGRAM.
A Puritaine did plain himself of late,
Of late grown controversies into great debate,
And prayed him to whom he did complain
That he his censure would afford him plain,
Well then quoth he if neither I shall flatter
But speak my conscience freely of the matter,
You are in fault, to make so much contending,
How can so new a faith, so soon lack mending.
AN EXPOSITION OF the Aue bell.
THe Chaser of my sence-detayning slumber,
undid the windows of my closed eyes,
And freed my thoughts from sleeps confused cumber,
That humors turned unto fantasies,
And fair Aurora ready at the tide,
VVithdrew the ayes darck curtin all aside.
In waking silence as a while I lay,
Ere my fresh muse new exercise had found,
I heard the bell that sounds thryce a day,
And took the sense leaving mine ear the sound,
For soundes and sights are messengers assygn'd,
To bring lost memory unto the mind.
And that same message which the Angel brought,
To her chaste ears that could no noise receive,
That might suggest conceit of any thought,
Her mind of any purity to reaue,
Was by this noise unto my mind renewed,
Whereby light idle fancies were eschued.
Est soones thereon to my remembrance came,
Breach of the Law, the first lawmakers made,
First act of sin, first cause of knowing shame,
First opened gap, for death man to invade,
Loss of heavens love, purchase of earths il will,
Fynding of sorrow, hid in seeking skill.
Alas O wretched man that made the offense,
Justice of thee demanded the amends,
And for thy want of yiedling recompense,
Thy vnacquyted gilt still down descendes,
As does some inward rooted malady,
By heritage unto a family.
Thus stood from age to age and race to race,
The score of sin unpaid vnraced out,
The world had not the worth to purchase grace,
Hope sighing sat between despair and doubt,
And thraldom was the woeful misery,
Of helpless man's successyue malady.
So long til heavens great care conceived grief,
At man's unableness himself to free,
And love no longer could withold relief,
And sweet relief that may thryce happy be,
Came even at last when else lost had been all,
And all did save, and all vp-hold from fall.
Love first bred grief and grief did pity move,
And pity sought the way to woork redress,
And kind redress the true effect of love,
Did salve the s^re that seemed remediless,
Justice for right, mercy for grace did crave,
Justice had right, mercy her favor gave.
Which to accomplish that eternal word,
Which was with God and was himself a God,
His heavenly presence would the earth afford,
And in a virgins closure make abode,
Whereof an Angels voice the message brought,
As metalls noise renewed it to my thought.
To her it came whom heavens wide view did see,
For pureness all the worlds most worthy creature,
A chosen mansion for the dietie,
Adornd with virtues fitting to her feature,
Whom nature made, to show the heavens her skill
And heaven through her the earth with grace did fill.
And where a serpent with his poysned sting,
In paradise infected Adams wife
A pure white dove from paradise does bring,
To Iosephes spouse restauratiue of life,
And in a virgins bed the seed does sow,
Whereof the tree and fruit of life does grow.
Her ears conceived first the Angels voice,
Her heart conceau'd the heavens high decree,
Her soul just cause conceived to rejoice,
And her pure womb as pure as pure might be,
Conceau'd withal; and that strong infant bred,
Who with his foot did break the serpents head.
Against the time, his birth-tyme to adorn,
Came down on earth to consecrate the ground,
(With Al^ion rest) Peace that in heaven was borne,
Because there might no noise of war be found,
When to the world the Prince should show his face.
That came to all the world to offer grace.
Whose entrance when it pleased him to take,
Into that country whereof death is King,
His own self virtue mydwyf he did make,
And to annex more wonder to the thing,
From his pure mothers closure he did pas,
Even as the Sun makes entrance through the glass.
O sacred force enforcing such a berth,
The wonder of the wonders most of worth,
The breath of heaven clad in core of earth,
Through an vnopened passage passing forth,
A human body spryte-lyke does dispose,
His powerful self that may no puissance lose.
And that sweet Infant of eternity,
Is borne the infant of a virgins woombe,
And God is man and so affinity,
Does twixt the earth and twixt the heaven come,
Whereby The Almighty maker thus we see,
Kinsman to men, to make himself to be.
Making withal the virgins glorious fame,
In faithful hearts engraven for to stand,
(Where of Gods mother she must bear the name)
In fair carracters of a sacred hand,
And such a mother, maid and wife to be,
As all her sex excelles in all thee three.
Clear chastity descending from her throne,
To do her homage here upon the ground,
A garland brought, made by her self alone,
Of Flowers that only were in Eden found,
And with obeisance set it on her head,
With title of eternal may denhed.
The Angels trumps did sound the heavens peace,
An eastern star streamed out the fire of joy,
God on his footstool did his state decrease,
New amity extinguished old annoy,
Hate had no place on all the earth to dwell,
But did remove unto her hows in hell.
O Infant offspring of vnending line,
That in this world to spring would so begin,
And with old Adams race thy self combyne,
And be the man to satisfy for sin,
True God, true man, except with sin defyld,
Who for to be a man became a child.
Thus God in chyld-heid did appear on earth,
Admitting time his manly growth to show,
Whose days yet crossed were by cross of death,
Ere time on him could man's full time bestow,
But since for man he would lost life obtain,
He death to kill would first of death be slain.
A SECONDARY exposition.
THe contemplation of the mystery,
Of the subjected state of heavens king,
And the reuyual of the memory,
That three times thryce a day the bell does ring,
Leads down my muse from height I erst began,
Unto the lowness of the life of man.
First how in darcknes of self-knowing state,
And as if all foregoing time were night,
We enter in at this worlds cumbrous gate,
As does the day new dawning with his light,
And that first treasure Time on us bestows,
In chyldish things unwittingly we lose.
Thence grow we up as do the hours of day,
Our days and years outrunning youthful rage,
From all repose Time carrying us away,
Does unaware draw on our middle age,
And through his haste will us no leisure lend,
Once back to tutne, youths errors to amend.
At noontyde of our days we do arryue,
As does the Sun at midday in his height,
What time the bell a second sound does give,
To move remembrance of the heavy weight,
Of sins huge burden when high heavens grace,
In human flesh released human race.
The midday time, has but the name of time,
For time himself no moment has of stay,
Nor we repose before or after pryme,
But as the Sun declyneth with the day,
So we declyne even at our highest rate,
Changing with time the change of our estate*
E^t soones draws on the euentyde of our years,
As does the Sun draw down ward to the west,
What time the bell renews to our ears,
The sound of joy now twyce before expressed,
To show how in the worlds declyning ^ase,
Attendant hope obtayn'd expected grace.
Now of our life is come the better part,
And of our labors fruit to reap the gain,
If youths endeavors wrought our well desert,
Or if in life so long we do remain,
For from the tree where we behold the bud,
Much fruit falls down ere it be ripe and good.
Lastly as day, our days their ending take,
And as before from darck night we arose,
Our day our nights return again does make,
And we yield up unto our last repose,
Our claim to earth, and all that nature gave,
And lay us down where death shall dig our grave.
OF THE STATE OF SOLItary life dedicated to the service of God.
OVVel are you that have subdude,
The force of worlds desire,
And in the forte of solitude,
For safety do retire.
Retired from freedom so supos'd,
In straightnes freedom find,
Because true freedom is enclosed
In circuit of the mind.
The world and fortune you depryue,
From doing you despite,
Dead unto men, to God alive,
That gives lives true delight.
That soul says God which I affect,
I will withdraw aparte
And tell unto it in effect,
The secrets of my heart.
Think th^n you that retired live,
For Gods dear love and dread,
His love your souls desire did give,
Retired lives to lead.
Where as with him you might confer
When sole your selves you deem,
And so alone less never ar,
Then when alone you seem.
Faith of yourfort is governor,
Love is liftenant there,
Hope is ordained officer,
The ensign for to b^are,
Contempt of wealth is treasurer,
Who works no guyle for gaynes,
VVhithin whose coffers never there,
Corrupting dross remains.
Pure Chastity the charge does take,
The cloister clean to keep,
And of her thoughts the broom does make,
Wherewith she does it sweep.
Obedience which does sacrifise,
In valued worth exceed,
Is ready for each exercise,
As duty deemeth need.
Perseverance is Sentinel,
The watch-woord watch and pray.
Whose due observance doing well,
The heavens do repay.
THE SVBSTANCE OF human flesh.
AS once I did behold,
The potters active skill,
In ordring of his earthen pots,
According to his will.
And some for worthy use.
And some for servile trade,
As he them from one clod of clay,
In sundry fashons made.
And when they al were wrought,
And each was put a part,
No cause they had (If they had could)
To blame their makers art.
To each it might suffice,
To serve his use asygn'd,
Since each to serve some proper use,
Was vtile in his kind.
Then as thereat I mused,
It came unto my thought,
How God even from one mass of clay,
All human kind had wrought,
As Well the silly wretch,
That lives in low degree,
As any mighty Emperor,
How puisant so he be.
And how at his estate,
None rightly may repyne,
Since that the woork man of his woork,
Has freedom to ^esigne.
And each in each degree,
Sufficient has in charge,
And he the more whose mighty rule,
Extends most at large.
For how more great the charge.
Cares burden greater weyes,
And greatness bears the greatest brunt,
And breeds the lesser ease.
And virtue can as well
In cottages remain,
As honor may in high estate,
In courts of Princes reign.
Let each him then dispose,
Well in his charge to serve,
To have the hyre that at the last,
VVel-doing does deserve.
For when a while on earth,
Each has served in his turn,
Earths fragile woork erst made of earth,
Must unto earth return.
VISIONS OF THE worlds instabillitie.
I.
WHen musing on this worlds v^sted fastnes,
Ere sleep attained my senses to surprise,
Agreeued at the woeful wretchedness,
That sad examples set before mine eyes:
It chanced me in this perturbed plight,
By Morpheus arrested for to be,
In whose close prison lying in the night,
Srange visions then there did apeer to me:
A spacious Th^^re first me thought I saw,
All hanged with black to act some tragedy.
Which did me unto much attention draw,
To see the sequel of the mystery:
About the which; my brain often have I broken,
To skan what such phantasmataes betoken.
II.
I saw a Holly sprig brought from a hyrst,
And in, a princely garden set in was,
Where of all trees it strove to be the first,
In stately height whereto it grew a pace:
Talle Cedar trees it ouertopped far*
And all with coral berries ouerspred.
It seemed the roses beauty for to man,
And to deface it with a skarlet red:
Where at the Gardner when he it suspected,
Or might perhaps misweene this trees intent,
For all first favor now grew il affected,
And all the Toughes a way did race and rent:
Thus stood disgraced the stock so brave before,
Which now of grief grew dead and sprung no more.
III.
Two stately pillars then to me appeared,
Of Ruby the one of Saphir the other wa^,
That on their bases strongly stood up reared,
Whose vnder-ground^woork was a rocky place:
And through transparent lusture shyning bright,
They not alone their beauty did extend,
But they did serve as lanternes in the night,
The trauailors from straying to defend:
Yet it befell; he that the soil did owe,
Began to d^uyse these pillars down to take,
On his new buyding them for to bestow,
And woorkmen brought, and theretro ginnes did make:
But out alas, in langor I complain,
In forceing them; they fell, and burst in twain.
IIII.
I saw a bird, of Egles race I deem,
For that she hatched was in Egles nest.
Which of a Lord was held in high esteem,
And to his lure she only her adrest:
But it so fell that he a Hawk espyde,
And took such pleasure in her speckled plume,
That he for her his fair foul thrust a side,
In undeserved sorrow to consume:
But lo this Ha^ke he now bore on his fist,
Oblyg'd and taught to come when as he lured,
Would not by him be lured as he list,
But was by stelth to others lures enured:
Which when he saw, in wrath and in despyte,
He wrang her neck of from her body quyte.
V.
A pleasant crop of trees then did I see,
On which sweet nightingales did sit and sing,
Til one that sem'd to hate their melody,
Sought how he might them to destruction bring:
He sat up snares and grinnes and lymy twigs,
And all deuyses that might them betray,
And brake their nestes that were among the sprigs,
And many killed and many chaste away:
And that they should no more come there again,
The very trees unto the ground he threw,
That scarsly any one he let remain,
But see how just revenge did soon ensue;
His foot s^ipt in a pitfal he had cast,
And down he fell and so his neck he brast.
VI.
A Giant then me thought there came in place,
Who dreaded was for greatness of his stature,
And many trembled to beh^ld his face,
And mused at the strangeness of his nature:
for he a sword did hold in either fist,
And freindes and foes he cared not to kill,
For few could in his favor long persist,
Because to keep his love was such a skill:
At last a monster all compact of bones,
Came traytor-lyke and with a darte him ^ent,
That down he fell and so was dead at once,
And as it seemed, few did his loss lament:
And where alive he monuments defaced,
Now dead, no monument on him was placed.
VII.
When all these things were vanished from my view,
At such unwonted sights I greatly mused,
And though I not the certain meaning knew,
Yet did it seem, although it seemed confused:
That things which are the cause of others wrong,
Themselves do often also suffer wrack,
Whereby is seen that sway endures not long,
And that revenge not always comes slack:
And that theirs none on earth has leave to tarry,
And that when bearing-rule has taken end,
Fame does suruyue, and takes an inuentarie,
Of rulers actions and whereto they tend:
And unto after ages she it shows,
To learn them what of good or il ensues.
VERSES OF THE worlds vanity, supposed to be made by S. Bernard.
And translated into English to be sung to the tune they bear in Latin.
WHy does this world contend,
For glorious vanity,
Whose wealth so subject is,
To mutabilitie.
As earthen vessels fail,
Through their fragillitie,
So stands wordly force,
Unsure and slipperie.
Caracters ra'st in ice,
Think rather permanent,
Then earthly vanities,
Vading incontinent.
Shadowed with virtue pure,
But falls in recompense,
At no time yiedling us,
True trust or confidence.
To men more credit gi^^,
That want fidelity,
Then trust in worldly wealth,
Which is but (...).
Falsehood in fond-delight,
Pleasures in ^ranticknes,
Desired vanities,
Of fleeting ficklenes.
Where now is Solomon,
Sometime in royalty,
Or Sampson with his great,
Inuincibillitie.
Or gentle Ionathas,
Praised for freindlynesse,
Or fairest Absalon.
So rare in comlynesse.
VVheare now is Ceaser go^,
High in authority,
Or Dives with his fare,
And sumptuofitie.
Tell now where Tullie is,
Cleerest in eloquence,
Or Aristotle fled,
With his intelligence.
O sil^y vermens food,
O mass of dustynesse,
O dew, o vanity,
Whence is thy loftiness.
To morrow for to live,
Thou haste no certainty,
Do good to all therefore,
While thou haste liberty.
This wordly glory great,
How short a feast it i^*
And like a shadow here,
Lo how it vani^ hes.
Which takes rewards away,
Of long continuance,
And leads us in the ways,
Of erring ignorance.
This earthly glory most,
Which here is magnifyde,
In Scripture termed is,
As grass that's withered.
And as the lightest leaf,
The wind a way does blow,
So light is life of man,
For death to overthrow.
Think that which thou may lose,
Is not thine certainly,
This world will take again,
These gifts of vanity.
Think then on things above,
On them thy heart adresse,
Contemn all worldly wealth,
For endless blessedness.
FINIS.
