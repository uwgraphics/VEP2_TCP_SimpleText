FOR The Colony in Virginea BRITANNIA.

Laws Divine, Moral and Martial, etc.

Alget qui non Ardet.

Res nostrae subinde non sunt, quales quis optaret, sed quales esse possunt.



Printed at London for Walter Burre. 1612.

To the Right Honorable his singular good Lord, the Lord LAWARR, of the
heroyicke and Religious Plantation in VIRGINIA-BRITANIA, the sole personal
Aduancer, his Majesty's Lord Governor and Captain GENERAL.
OF all things we enjoy, the Founders worth
Is still most praide for: In attempts of war,
The Chargers fame is ever most set forth:
Of all things founded true Religion far,
We are worthyest Palm, and merits holiest meede:
This then Heroyicke Lord your glory shrines,
That you are sole personal Lord of this great deed,
Which more by all else shund the more it shines:
Skorne then all common Aims, and every Act
Where every vulgar, thrusts for profit on,
Nor praise; nor prise affect, like the mere Fact
Nor any other Honor build upon,
Then only this, since it is for Christ's dear word,
You shall be surnamed; The most Christian Lord.
By an unworthy follower of the same fortune, your Lordships Servant, William
Strachey.

To the much Honored, in all Nations acknowledged the most renowned famous
Factor and Professor of all Actions that have the warrant of Religion, Honor
or goodness, Sir THOMAS SMITH Knight, and in this piou^ Plantation of
Virginia-Britania, the unremovable cordial friend, and right bounteous and
well chosen TREASVRER.
SIR, if the traffic with all Nations,
(Vent'ring your Purse for profit) has renowned
Your noble mind with all men's commendations,
For this divine gain, it is triple Croun'd,
In which you traffic not with men, but God:
Not venturing, but surely gaining Souls:
Not only such as Idleness had trod,
As low as hell, and given their flesh to Fowls,
In our own Country: but such souls beside,
As living like the son of Earth, the Moule
Have never yet Heavens saving light descried:
More then the world he gains, that gains a soul:
Which but your self, though few or none esteem,
Assures your soul a heavenly Diadem.
William Strachey.

To the Right Honorable, the Lords of the Council of Virginea.
NOblest of men, though it is the fashion now
Noblest to mix with basest, for their gain:
Yet does it fare far otherwise with you,
That scorn to turn to Chaos so again,
And follow your supreme distinction still,
Till of most noble, you become divine
And imitate your maker in his will,
To have his truth in blackest nations shine.
What had you been, had not your Ancestors
Begun to you, that make their nobles good?
And where white Christians turn in manners Mores
You wash Mores white with sacred Christa^ blood
This wonder ye, that others nothing make;
Forth the^ (great LL.) for your Lords Sauiors sake.
By him, all whose duty is tributary to your Lordships, and unto so excellent a
cause. William Strachey.

To the constant, mighty, and worthy friends, the Commit^ies, Assistants unto
his Majesty's Council for the Colonie in VIRGINEA-BRITANNIA.
WHen I went forth upon this voyage, (Right worthy Gentlemen) true it is, I
held it a service of duty, (during the time of my unprofitable service, and
purpose of stay in the Colonie, for which way else might I add unto the least
hight of so Heroicke and pious a building) to propose unto my self to be
(though an unable) Remembrancer of all accidents, occurrences, and undertakings
thereunto, aduentitiall: In most of which since the time our right famous sole
Governor then; now Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Gates Knight, after the
ensealing of his Commission hasted to our fleet in the West, there staying for
him, I have both in the Bermudas, and since in Virginea been a sufferer and an
eye witness, and the full story of both in due time shall consecrate unto
your viewes, as unto whom by right it appertains, being vowed patrones of a
work, and enterprise so great, then which no object nor action (the best of
bests) in these times, may carry with it the like fame, honor, or goodness.

Howbet since many impediments, as yet must detain such my observations in the
shadow of darkness, until I shall be able to deliver them perfect unto your
judgments, (...) I shall provoke and challenge) I do in the meanetime present
a transcript of the Toparchia or State of those duties, by which the^^ Colonie
stands regulated and commanded, that such may receive due chicke, who
maliciously and desperately heretofore have censured of it, and by examining of
which they may be right sorry so to have defaulked from us as if we lived there
lawless, without obedience to our Country, or obseruancie of Religion to God.

Nor let it afflict the patience of such full and well instructed judgments,
unto whom many of these constitutions and Laws Divine or Marshall may seem
ancient and common, since these grounds are the same constant, Asterismes, and
stars, which must guide all that travel in th^se perplexed ways, and paths
of public affairs; and whosoever shall wander from them, shall but decline a
hazardous and by-course to bring their purposes to good effect.

Nor let another kind quarrel or traduce the Printing of them to be delivered
in particular to officers and private Soldiers for their better instruction,
especially unto a Company for the (...), unsettled and unfurnished, since we
know well how short our memories are oftentimes, and unwilling to give sto^ge
to the better things, and such things as limit and bound mankind in their
necessariest duties.

For which it transcends not the reach of his understanding, who is conversant,
if but as for a festival exercise, (every (...) Moon) in reading of a book,
that records and ed^cts for manners or civil duties, have usually been fixed
upon engraven Tables, for the Commons daily to ouerlooke: a custom more
especially cherished by those not many years since in Magnuza who have
restored (as I m^^ say) after so great a flood and rage of abused goodness^,
all Laws, literature and Virtue again, which had well nigh perished, had not
the force of piety and sacred reason remaining in the bosoms of some few,
opposed it self against the fury of so great a calamity, of whom it is an
undeniable truth, that the means and way whereby they reduced the general
def^ction, was by printing thereby so houlding up those inuolued principles,
and Instructions wherein (as in a mirror, the blind and wandering judgment
might suruaye, what those knowledges were, which taught both how to govern,
and how to obey, (the end indeed of sociable mankinds Creation) since without
order and government, (the only hendges, whereupon, not only the safety, but
the being of all states do turn and depend) what society may possible
subsist, or commutatiue goodness be practiced. And thus law^s being published,
every common eye may take survey of their duties, and carrying away the tenor
of the same, meditate, and bethink how safe, quiet, and comely it is to be
honest, just, and civil.

And indeed all the sacred powers of knowledge and wisdom are strengthened by
these two ways, either by a kind of divine nature, which his happy creation
has blessed him with, the virtue whereof comprehends, foreseeth and
understands the truth and cleerenesse of all things: or by instruction and
tradition from others, which must improve his wants, and by experience render
him perfect, awaking him in all seasons a vigilant obseruer of civil cautions
and ordinances, an excellent reason enforcing no less unto the knowledge of
him that will shine a star in the firmament, where good men move, and that
is, that no man does more ill then he that is ignorant.

For the avoiding of which, and to take away the plea of I did not know in him
that shall exorbitate or go aside with any delinquencie which may be dangerous
in example or execution, albeit true it is how he is indeed the good and
honest man that will be good, and to that needs few other precepts. It has
appeared most necessary unto our present Ethnarches Deputy Governor Sir Thomas
Dale knight Marshall, not only to exemplify the old Laws of the Colony, by
Sir Thomas Gates published and put in execution by our Lord General Laware
during his time one whole year of being there, but by virtue of his office, to
prescribe and draw new, with their due penaltyes, according unto which we
might live in the Colony justly one with another, and perform the general
service for which we first came thither, and with so great charges and
expenses, are now settled and maintained there.

For my pains, and gathering of them, as I know they will be right welcome to
such young soldiers in the Colony who are desirous to learn and perform
their duties, so I assure me, that by you I shall be encouraged to go on in
the discharge of greater offices by examining and favoring my good intention
in this, and in what else my poor knowledge or faithfulness may enable me to
be a servant in so beloved and sacred a business. And even so committing to
your still most abstract, grave and unsatisfied carfulness, both it and my
self, I wish return of seven fold into such his well inspired bosom, who
has lent his helping hand unto this new Sion. From my lodging in the black
Friars.

At your best pleasures, either to return unto the Colony, or to pray for the
success of it here. WILLIAM STRACHEY.

Articles, Laws, and Orders, Divine, Politic, and Martial for the Colony in
Virginea: first established by Sir Thomas Gates Knight, Lieutenant General,
the 24. of May 1610. exemplified and approved by the Right Honorable Sir
Thomas West Knight, Lord Lawair, Lord Governor and Captain General the 12.
of June 1610. Again exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale Knight,
Marshall, and Deputy Governor, the 22. of June. 1611.

WHereas his Majesty like himself a most zealous Prince has in his own
Realms a principal care of true Religion, and reverence to God, and has
always strictly commanded his Generals and Governors, with all his forces
wheresoever, to let their ways be like his ends, for the glory of God.

And forasmuch as no good service can be performed, or war well managed,
where military discipline is not observed, and military discipline cannot be
kept, where the rules or chief parts thereof, be not certainly set down, and
generally known, I have (with the advice and counsel of Sir Thomas Gates
Knight, Lieutenant General) adhered unto the laws divine, and orders
politic, and martial of his Lordship (the same exemplified) an addition of
such others, as I have found either the necessity of the present State of the
Colonie to require, or the infancy, and weakness of the body thereof, as yet
able to digest, and do now publish them to all persons in the Colonie, that
they may as well take knowledge of the Laws themselves, as of the penalty and
punishment, which without partiality shall be inflicted upon the breakers of
the same.

1 FIrst since we owe our highest and supreme duty, our greatest, and all our
allegiance to him, from whom all power and authority is derived, and flows as
from the first, and only fountain, and being especial soldiers emprest in
this sacred cause, we must alone expect our success from him, who is only the
blesser of all good attempts, the King of kings, the commander of commanders,
and Lord of Hosts, I do strictly command and charge all Captains and
Officers, of what quality or nature soever, whether commanders in the field,
or in town, or towns, forts or fortresses, to have a care that the Almighty
God be duly and daily served, and that they call upon their people to hear
Sermons, as that also they diligently frequent Morning and Evening prayer
themselves by their own exemplar and daily life, and duty herein, encouraging
others thereunto, and that such, who shall often and wilfully absent
themselves, be duly punished according to the martial law in that case
provided.

2 That no man speak impiously or maliciously, against the holy and blessed
Trinity, or any of the three persons, that is to say, against God the Father,
God the Son, and God the holy Ghost, or against the known Articles of the

3 That no man blaspheme Gods holy name upon pain of death, or use unlawful
oaths, taking the name of God in vain, curse, or banne, upon pain of severe
punishment for the first offense so committed, and for the second, to have a

holy name, for the third time so offending, he shall be brought to a martial
court, and there receive censure of death for his offense.

royal authority upon pain of death.

5 No man shall speak any word, or do any act, which may tend to the derision,

shall openly be whipped three times, and ask public forgiveness in the
assembly of the congregation three several Saboth days.

6 Every man and woman duly twice a day upon the first towling of the Bell

Months. Likewise no man or woman shall dare to violate, or break the Sabbath
by any gaming, public, or private abroad, or at home, but duly sanctify and

according to the commandments of God, and the orders of our Church, as also
every man and woman shall repair in the morning to the divine service, and
Sermons preached upon the Saboth day, and in the afternoon to divine service,
and Catechizing, upon pain for the first fault to lose their provision, and
allowance for the whole week following, for the second to lose the said

Minister where he is resident, within the same Fort, or Fortress, Towns or
Town, shall choose unto him, four of the most religious and better disposed as
well to inform of the abuses and neglects of the people in their duties, and

likewise every Minister shall keep a faithful and true Record, or Church
Book, of all Christnings, Marriages, and deaths of such our people, as shall
happen within their Fort, or Fortresses, Towns or Town at any time, upon the

times a week for one month, and ask public forgiveness in the Assembly of

unto any holy, and consecrated place, to the divine Service of God, which no

necessity shall require in that case to have extraordinary allowance of

19 There shall no Capttain, Master, Mariner, saylor, or any else of what
quality or condition soever, belonging to any Ship or Ships, at this time

for any tool or instrument of iron, steel or what else, whether appertaining
to Smith Carpenter, Ioyner, Shipwright, or any manual occupation, or
handicraft man whatsoever, resident within our Colonie, nor shall they buy or
bargain, for any apparel, linen, or woollen, housholdstuffe, bed, bedding,
sheet, towels, napkins, brass, pewter, or such like, either for ready money,
or provisions, nor shall they exchange their provisions, of what quality
soever, whether Butter, Cheese, Biscuit, meal, Oatmele, Aquauite, oil, Bacon,
any kind of Spice, or such like, for any such aforesaid instruments, or tools,
Apparel, or housholdstuffe, at any time, or so long as they shall here remain,
from the date of these presents upon pain of loss of their wages in England,

foresaid provisions, upon pain of 3 times several whipping, for the one
offender, and the other upon peril of incurring censure, whether of disgrace,
or addition of such punishment, as shall be thought fit by a Court martial.

20 Whereas sometimes heretofore the covetous and wide affections of some
greedy and ill disposed Seamen, Sailors, and Mariners, laying hold upon the
advantage of the present necessity, under which the Colony sometimes suffered,
have sold unto our people, provisions of Meal, Oatmeale, Biscuit, Butter,
Cheese etc, at unreasonable rates, and prises unconscionable: for avoiding the
like to be now put in practice, there shall no Captain, Master, Mariner, or
Saylor, or what Officer else belonging to any ship, or ships, now within our
river, or hereafter which shall arrive, shall dare to bargain, exchange,
barter, truck, trade, or sell, upon pain of death, unto any one Landman member
of this present Colony, any provisions of what kind soever, above the
determined valuations, and prises, set down and proclaimed, and sent therefore
unto each of your several ships, to be fixed upon your Maine mast, to the
intent that want of due notice, and ignorance in this case, be no excuse, or
plea, for any one offender herein.

21 Sithence we are not to be a little careful, and our young Cattle, and
Breeders may be cherished, that by the preservation, and increase of them, the
Colony here may receive in due time assured and great benefit, and the
adventurers at home may be eased of so great a burden, by sending unto us
yearly supplies of this kind, which now here for a while, carefully
attended, may turn their supplies unto us into provisions of other qualities,
when of these we shall be able to subsist our selves, and which we may in
short time, be powerful enough to do, if we will according to our own
knowledge of what is good for our selves, forbear to work into our own wants,
again, by over hasty destroying, and devouring the stocks, and authors of so
profitable succeeding a Commodity, as increase of Cattle, Kine, Hogs, Goats,
Poultrie etc. must of necessity be granted, in every common man's judgment; to
render unto us: Now know ye therefore, these promises carefully considered,
that it is our will and pleasure, that every one, of what quality or condition
soever he be, in this present Colony, to take due notice of this our Edict,
whereby we do strictly charge and command, that no man shall dare to kill, or
destroy any Bull, Cow, Calfe, Mare, Horse, Colt, Goat, Swine, Cock, Hen,
Chicken, Dog. Turkey, or any tame Cattle, or Poultry, of what condition
soever; whether his own, or appertaining to another man, without leave from
the General, upon pain of death in the Principal, and in the accessory,
burning in the Hand, and loss of his ears, and unto the concealer of the same
four and twenty hours whipping, with addition of further punishment, as shall
be thought fit by the censure, and verdict of a Martial Court.

22 There shall no man or woman, Launderer or Launderesse, dare to wash any
unclean Linen, drive bucks, or throw out the water or suds of foul clothes,
in the open street, within the Pallizadoes, or within forty foot of the same,
nor rench, and make clean, any kettle, pot, or pan, or such like vessel
within twenty foot of the old well, or new Pumpe: nor shall any one
aforesaid, within less then a quarter of one mile from the Pallizadoes, dare
to do the necessities of nature, since by these unmanly, slothful, and
loathsome immodesties, the whole Fort may be choked, and poisoned with ill
aires, and so corrupt (as in all reason cannot but much infect the same) and
this shall they take notice of, and avoid, upon pain of whipping and further
punishment, as shall be thought meet, by the censure of a martial Court.

23 No man shall imbezell, lose, or willingly break, or fraudulently make
away, either Spade, Shouell, Hatchet, Axe, Mattocke, or other tools or
instrument upon pain of whipping.

24 Any man that has any edge tool, either of his own, or which has
heretofore been belonging to the store, see that he bring it instantly to the
storehouse, where he shall receive it again by a particular note, both of the
tool, and of his name taken, that such a tool unto him appertains, at whose
hands, upon any necessary occasion, the said tool may be required, and this
shall he do, upon pain of severe punishment.

25 Every man shall have an especial and due care, to keep his house sweet
and clean, as also so much of the street, as lies before his door, and
especially he shall so provide, and set his bedstead whereon he lies, that it
may stand three foot at least from the ground, as he will answer the
contrary at a martial Court.

26 Every tradsman in their several occupation, trade and function, shall duly
and daily attend his work upon his said trade or occupation, upon peril for
his first fault, and negligence therein, to have his entertainment checked for
one month, for his second fault three months, for his third one year, and if
he continue still unfaithful and negligent therein, to be condemned to the
Gally for three year.

27 All overseers of workmen, shall be careful in seeing that performed,
which is given them in charge, upon pain of such punishment as shall be
inflicted upon him by a martial Court.

28 No soldier or tradesman, but shall be ready, both in the morning, and in
the afternoon, upon the beating of the Drum, to go out unto his work, nor
shall he return home, or from his work, before the Drum beat again, and
the officer appointed for that business, bring him of, upon peril for the
first fault to lie upon the Guard head and heels together all night, for the
second time so faulting to be whipped, and for the third time so offending to be
condemned to the Galleys for a year.

29 No man or woman, (upon pain of death) shall run away from the Colonie,

30 He that shall conspire any thing against the person of the Lord Governor,
and Captain General, against the Lieutenant General, or against the
Marshall, or against any public service commanded by them, for the dignity,
and advancement of the good of the Colony, shall be punished with death: and he
that shall have knowledge of any such pretended act of disloyalty or treason,
and shall not reveal the same unto his Captain, or unto the Governor of that
fort or town wherein he is, within the space of one hour, shall for the
concealing of the same after that time, be not only held an accessory, but a
like culpable as the principal traitor or conspirer, and for the same likewise
he shall suffer death.

31 What man or woman soever, shall ro^bany garden, public or private, being
set to weed the same, or wilfully pluck up therein any root, herb, or flower,
to spoil and wast or steal the same, or rob any vineyard, or gather up the
grapes, or steal any cares of the corn growing, whether in the ground
belonging to the same fort or town where he dwells, or in any other, shall
be punished with death.

32 Whosoever Seaman, or Landman of what quality, or in what place of command
soever, shall be employed upon any discovery, trade, or fishing voyage into any
of the rivers within the precincts of our Colonie, shall for the safety of
those men who are committed to his command, stand upon good and careful
guard, for the prevention of any treachery in the Indian, and if they touch
upon any shore, they shall be no less circumspect, and wary, with good and
careful guard day and night, putting forth good Centinell, and observing the
orders and discipline of watch and ward, and when they have finished the
discovery, trade, or fishing, they shall make have with all speed, with such
Bark or Barks, Pinisse, Gallie, Ship. etc. as they shall have the command

their commission, or to carry any such Bark or Barks, Gally, Pinnice, Ship.
etc. for England or any other country in the actual possession of any
Christian Prince, upon peril to be held an enemy to this plantation, and
traitor thereunto, and accordingly to lie liable unto such censure of
punishment (if they arrive in England) as shall be thought fit by the Right
Honorable Lords, his Majesty's Council for this Colonie, and if it shall so
happen, that he or they shall be prevented, and brought back hither again
into the Colonie, their treacherous flight to be punished with death.

33 There is not one man nor woman in this Colonie now present, or hereafter to
arrive, but shall give up an account of his and their faith, and religion, and
repair unto the Minister, that by his conference with them, he may
understand, and gather, whether heretofore they have been sufficiently
instructed, and catechized in the principles and grounds of Religion, whose
weakness and ignorance herein, the Minister finding, and aduising them in all
love and charity, to repair often unto him, to receive therein a greater
measure of knowledge, if they shall refuse so to repair unto him, and he the
Minister give notice thereof unto the Governor, or that chief officer of that
town or fort, wherein he or she, the parties so offending shall remain, the
Governor shall cause the offender for his first time of refusal to be whipped,
for the second time to be whipped twice, and to acknowledge his fault upon the
Saboth day, in the assembly of the congregation, and for the third time to be
whipped every day until he has made the same acknowledgement, and asked
forgiveness for the same, and shall repair unto the Minister, to be further
instructed as aforesaid: and upon the Saboth when the Minister shall catechize,
and of him demand any question concerning his faith and knowledge, he shall
not refuse to make answer upon the same peril.

34 What man or woman soever, Laundrer or Laundresse appointed to wash the
foul linen of any one labourer or soldier, or any one else as it is their
du^ies so to do, performing little, or no other service for their allowance
out of the store, and daily provisions, and supply of other necessaries, unto
the Colonie, and shall from the said labourer or soldier, or any one else, of
what quality whatsoever, either take any thing for washing, or withhold or
steal from him any such linen committed to her charge to wash, or change the

The Summarie of the Marshall Laws.
Ye are now further to understand, that all these prohibited, and forefended
trespasses and misdemenors, with the enjoined observance of all these thus
repeated, Civil and Politic Laws, provided, and declared against what
Crimes soever, whether against the divine Majesty of God, or our sovereign,
and Liege Lord, King James, the detestable crime of Sodomie, Incest,
Blasphemy, Treason against the person of the principal Generals, and
Commanders of this Colonie, and their designs, against detracting, murmuring,
calumniating, or slaundering of the Right Honorable the Council resident in
England, and the Committies there, the general Council, and chief Commanders
here, as also against intemperate raylings, and base unmanly speeches, uttered
in the disgrace one of another by the worser sort, by the most impudent,
ignorant, and profane, such as have neither touch of humanity, nor of
conscience amongst our selves, against Adultery, Fornication, Rape, Murder,
Theft, false witnessing in any cause, and other the rest of the Civil, and
Politic Laws and Orders, necessarily appertaining, and properly belonging to
the Government of the State and Condition of the present Colony, as it now
subsisteth: I say ye are to know, that all these thus joined, with their due
punishments, and perils here declared, and published, are no less subject to

Tumult, and practice of arms, are not exercised, and where these now following

42 All Captains, Officers, and common Soldiers, or others of what condition

Marshall court.

43 All other faults, disorders, and offenses that are not mentioned in these
Laws, Articles, and Orders shall be and are supplied in the instructions which

49 Whosoever shall not retreat when the drum or trumpet sounds the same,
whether it be upon any sallies, made out of any town or fortres, or in
skirmish, or in any encounter, shall be punished with death.

all things may be governed in good order, as no doubt, our Right Honorable Lord
General does assure himself, that all good and upright men that have the
fear of God, and his service, and their own honor in regard, will demean
themselves no less, then according to the dignity of their place, and charge
of their command, the united powers of his Lordships knowledge, being so full
of approved nobleness, and the well known, and long time exercised grounds of
Piety, as without question he cannot but desire rather a little number of good
men, obedient and tractable, submitting to good order and discipline, then a
great army, composed of vicious profane, quarrellous, disobedient, and
ignoble persons, wherefore in his Lordships behalf, I must entreat all
Governors, Captains, Officers, and Soldiers, and nevertheless do inioyne,
ordain and command them to carry themselves in their several duties and
charges, according to the intention of his Lordship, declared by these present
Ordinances.

51 Every Captain shall cause to be read all these laws which concern
martial discipline, every week upon his guard day, unto his company upon
pain of censure of a Martial court.

Instructions of the Marshall for better inhabling of the Colonel or
Governor, to the executing of his or their charges in this present Colony the
22. of June. 1611.
ALbeit the zeal which I bear unto this business that we have all now in
hand touching the subsistence of this plantation, might justly take up all my
spirits, and would require a large and passionate explanation of mine own
thoughts and promptness to gain and possess the hearts of all understanding,
noble and religious spirits thereunto, yet I must crave pardon (considering at
this time many present impediments) if I wrap up any impatient desires and good
affection hereunto, to all such unto whom these necessary effects of my duty
and office shall appertain, and must be declared in few words and aduises,
appertinent yet (if not essential, as heat to blood, to the advancement
hereof) my desire then by these is chiefly to let all the worthier and better
sort to understand, how well it shall become their Honors, birthes, breedings,
reputations and fa^shes, to do their bests, and emulously to actuate in this
work, the utmost of their cleerest powers of body and mind, where the travail
of both is so dearly valued, and highly interpreted by all good and wise men,
who knowing the grounds of all goodness, cannot but know this, how this
hazardous voyage (as yet but in her early days, reflecting only the comfort
of fair hopes) is undertaken by you, more to honor God, your country, and to
profit your knowledges, then for any other ends of profit, which speaks for
you (in despite of envy and calumny) that you have minds much in love with
virtue, and are right noble and worthy instruments, to be employed in so sacred
and heroicke a cause, if it were well known here the care that is had of this
plantation in England, and the travel that is taken therein, and the fire that
does not only burn in the general body of our dear countrymen, to the
encouragemet and joy one of another amongst themselves, but flames out (even to
the view of strange nations, as well our neighbors, as far remote) for the
furtherance and advancement of this honorable enterprise, there is no man here
would think that this my induction, had either fashion or purpose of a
complement. If the wisest man that ever spoke or writ (except him that was both
God and man) summed up all the reckonings of worldly felicities in these two
words Laecari and benefacere, employing a cheereful mirth with well doing (from
which it cannot be severed) who has more cause to be cheerful, and inlie
glad then you that have the comfort of so great weldoing, to which no other may
be compared? for what weldoing can be greater then to be stocks and authors of
a people that shall serve and glorify God, which is the end of all our
Creation, and to redeem the^ from ignorance and infidelity, to the true
knowledge and worship of God, whereby you are made partakers of this promise,
that they which lead others into Righteousness, shall shine like the stars in
the sirmament, wherein be right well assured, that your happiness is envied by
many a right knowing, and excellent virtuous man in England, who cannot happly
by reason of other their employments and callings, be partakers of that
Comfort here, as they are by their Endeavors there at home. I shall not need
to advise any Colonel, or Governor here for the present how to carry himself,
for each man's own experience here has made him out goal use of my admonition,
which my affection would willingly else afford if there were cause. Only to
discharge my service to god whose soldier I do now profess my self impressed,
in this so glorious and great a cause of his, my duty to my Sovereign Liege
Lord and King, and to his Highness my Royal Prince and Master, to my Country
and the expectation of many Honorable select, painful, and Religious
adventurers, Patrones of this business, I have conceived no whit impertinent
to deliver and publish to every imminent officer in this Colony here present,
and for the direction and guiding of such who may hereafter arrive here such
and so many few in structions as may the better enable them to execute their
charges, no whit doubting, but every Colonel, Governor Captain, and other
Officer may sufficiently understand his and their duties, as they are
Soldiers, but happily not yet as they are, or may be Coloni, members of a
Colony, which compriseth and inuolueth here, as well all the industrious
knowledges and practices of the husbandman and of his spade, as of the
Soldier, and of his Sword, since as Money is the payment and wages of the one,
so of the other are the fruits of the earth the tillage and manuring of the
Land, and in very truth of more necessity and use shall we here be of the
latter then of the other, whether of you be comprehended the soldier himself
or his Salarie, since more easy it is to make a Husbandman a Soldier, then a
Soldier a husbandman. And indeed the necessity of our subsisting, and the very
danger which our enemies of this Country can any way put us unto (our
Companies and people well commanded) requiring the choice rather of the one
then the other. These being then the ends and intents of this work, and so
understood, by every supreme and chief commander, I refer him to these
following instructions.

All Governors of Town or Towns, Fort or Forts, shall be ready (when so be it
they shall be summoned thereunto) to take their Oaths of Allegiance unto his
Majesty and of faithfulness unto such his majesty's Lieftenant or to his Deputy
or Deputies (authorized by Commission to command over and within the prec^ncts
of this whole Colony, or Colonies, by the Tenor of which Oaths they shall
solemnly attest to perform all Integrity, uprightness, Justice and sincere
administration of the discipline and Laws in all causes and cases, for the
good of the Colony or Colonies, provided and declared, and shall endeavor the
best they may, with all carfulness to advance the dignity, and subsistence of
the same, as well by giving often in charge, and taking no less into their
own care, both the particular preservation of all such helps of what
condition soever (especially of cattle, and al kind of such breeders, which
may ef^oones redound unto the vtility and profit of the same, as by tendering
the provisions of the store, and the we^l husbanding of the same, be they of
what several quality soever Nor is he meanly to be watchful, and jealous
over his own ways and carriage in all particulars, making profession, and
practice of all virtue and g^odnes for example unto others to imitate, it being
true that examples at all times prevail far above precepts, men being
readier to be led by their eyes, then their ear, for seeing a lively pattern
of industry, order and comeliness, we are all of us rather swayed unto the
same by a visible object, then by hearing much more in well i^struct^d Arguments.

Every such Governor therefore shall make it his firit duty to resort daily and
vsu^lly to the divine Service, next to put in execution the Laws duly against
offenders and with all cherish and reward the well deserving, and lastly with
all worthiness and circumspection on, abeare himself unto and toward his
Garrison, entreating all men as well strangers as others, with all Grace,
humanity, and sweetness of a noble nature, and manliness, unto all which I
heartily advise, and withal inioyne every such Governor of Town or Towns, to be
most indulgent, and careful to perform, as he will answer the contrary
(beside with the loss of his own Honor, with such other penalties, as the
neglect of so behoofefull and necessary business in him, may draw upon the
Colony.

Further he ought to be most vigilant, circumspect, and provident for the
conseruatio^, defending, and keeping the Town or Fort, for and unto his
Majesty, wherein he is placed chief commander, and therefore ought the more
duly to strengthen his Judgment, and remember his reputation, that he fall
into neither of those extremes, which the needy and prodigal are most what
culpable of, the one wasting the stocks, commodities and provisions of the
store, by which he must subsist, and the other by being ravenous and corrupt in
himself become likewise enforced to tolerate the same in his inferior
captains, and so leave the poor Soldier and Labourer, miserably pilled,
oppressed and starued.

Further he ought to provide that the companies be trained, and that they may
be made ready for the public service, and for that the condition of this
country does require rather shot then other Arms, either for offense or
defense, and time being precious with us in respect of our daily labors and
works abroad belonging to our subsisting, in so much, as a small portion
thereof may be affoorded and allowed unto such exercising and training,
therefore it is appointed by the Marshall, that the Captains that shall have
the Guard, during their time of Guard (their people as then being exempted from
their daily labor and work abroad) and their Officers shall teach every
Soldier to handle his piece; first to present it comely, and soldier like,
and then to give fire, by false firing, and so to fall his Piece to the right
side with the nose up, and when their soldiers are hardy and expert in this,
they shall set up a convenient mark fast by the court of Guard, at which every
Soldier shall twice discharge his piece, at the releeuing of the watch,
morning and evening, and he that shall shoot nearest the Governor shall do well
to allow some addition of victuals, or pay, or some prize of encouragement,
that every one may thereby emulously contend to do best: Concerning the
training, and cleanely exercising of their Arms, and their postures, the
captains shall have order and directions for the same under the Marshals hand
which they shall put in Execution during the time of their Guard.

41 It is also required that the Governor never lie out of his Town or Fort
whereby he may the better keep good espiall upon all officers, that they
perform their several duties each one in his place especially in good
observation of the watch and Guard, for the more confide^t securing the charge
committed to him:

He shall not suffer in his Garrison any Soldier to enter into Guard, or to
be drawn out into the field without being armed according to the Marshals
order, which is, that every shot shall either be furnished with a quilted coat
of Canuas, a headpeece, and a sword, or else with a light Armor, and Bases
quilted, with which he shall be furnished: and every Targiteer with his Bases
to the small of his leg, and his headpeece, sword and pistol, or Scuppet
provided for that end. And likewisee every Officer armed as before, with a
firelocke, or Snaphau^se, head-peece, and a Target, only the Serieant in
Garrison shall use his Halbert, and in field his Snaphaunse and Target.

The Governor shall have a Principal care, that he use his Garrison to the
daily wearing of these Armors, least in the field, the soldier do find them
the more uncouth strange and troublesome.

Lastly the Governor shall have a singular care to put in execution all such
Orders and Instructions as shall be delivered unto him from the General, or
his deputy or deputies, concerning the employments of his Garrison upon such
manual works and duties, as shall be thought necessary and convenient for the
better subsisting both of the Laborer, and Garrison committed unto him* In
which is not to be forgotten the chary conservation of powder, and munition,
which will the better inhable him for the defense of his Charge.

The Governor shall be better instructed by taking notice of the Laws
published, that these following abuses are provided for, impious and malicious
speaking against the holy and blessed Trinity, Blasphemy, and taking Gods holy
name in vain, traitorous words against his majesty's person, or Royal
Authority, vnreuerent Demeanor toward the Ministers and preachers of the same,
the detestable crime of Sodomie, incest, theft, murder, false witnessing,
treason against the Person of the General, and principal Commanders of this
Colony, and their designs, against Detracting, Murmuring or slaundering of the
Right Honorable, the Council resident in England, and the Committies there,
the general Council and Subalternate Commanders, here, as also against
intemperate raylings and base unmanly speeches uttered in the disgrace one of
another, all which the Marshall Law, as well as the Civil Magistrate is to
punish, but these which concern in particular the military Discipline, to
enable your judgment for your sentence to be required, that it may with
greater cleerenes, and understanding, called to censure offenses in the Marshal
court be delivered, I have abstracted, as follows

Instructions of the Marshall for the better inhabling of the Captain of the
watch, to the executing of his charge in this present Colony. the 22. of June.
1611.
SIthence, as in every living creature, there be many and sundry members, and
those distinct in place and office, and all yet under the regiment of the
soul, and heart, so in every army, commonwealth, or Colonie (all bodies a like
compounded) it cannot be otherwise for the establishment of the same in perfect
order and virtue, but that there should be many differing parts, which directed
by the chief, should help to govern and administer Justice under him. And if
it be thus in this civil Audit, and courts of a well settled State, much more
sure as it required, to be in their beginnings, and no less shall we read, how
that first and great commander over the Colony of the children of Israel,
conducting them from Egypt to make their plantation in the land of Promise,
appointed Captains over Tribes and hundreds for the wars, and Elders to sit
upon the bench (whilst unto himself all great causes were brought, whether
martial, or civil to direct and determine it otherwise being impossible, so
many and infinite occasions both being to be thought upon, and requiring
judicial audience, should ever come by one man (of how indefatig^ble a spirit
soever) to be decided or determined. Out of this example commended unto us by
the holy writ, it may well be, that many Officers are still continued in all
united societies, religious and well governed: having then thus religion, beside
prescription and reason, (which mine own breeding has taught me how to make
the best use of, to be my guids in this new settlement, and in this strange and
heathenous (contending with all the strength and powers of my mind and body, I
confess to make it like our native country, I am not a little careful to
adhere and take unto mine own endeavors, as many furtherances, as may help to
work out with me the ends of this great employment, which has now possessed
and furnished all states of Christendom with discourse and expectation what may
be the issue thereof, and to what perfection so great, and frequent leuies of
moneys, and annual transportations for these four years of men, and
provisions, may bring this English plantation unto: And as I have constituted
subalterne officers according both to the ancient and modern order of the
wars, and well approved the government and magistracy, resembling and
maintaining the laws of England, so I have taken pains to present so many and
such instructions to such special officers (whom our necessity teaches to
establish amongst us) as may most nearest concern them for the present,
(leaving out yet I confess many appertinent ones, which the time and our
early days here of settlement may not yet admit of. Let me advise therefore
every officer now established, to hold it a service of duty faithfully to
execute such orders and instructions, as I have made it my minds labor to
express and draw out for him: and amongst the rest (our no little safety
consisting in our watch and guard as well by day as night, we being set down in
a stranger land, savage, and treacherous, and therefore many sudden and
barbarous accidents to be feared, I have as follows extracted the duty of the
captain of the wrath an office not meanly appertaining and necessary unto this
Colony, and whose ignorance, and supine negligence may much endanger the
safety thereof.

That Captain who is Captain of the watch, must have a special care of the
safeguard and preservation of the Town or Fort committed to his charge, and of
the lives and goods of the soldiers, and Inhabitants, that through his defect,
negligence, or Ignorance in his charge, he gives not opportunity to the enemy
to execute any of his deseignes, for the indamaging of the place or the
Inhabitants: Now for the more faithful executing of his charge, he shall do
well to take notice, that being the chief commander of the watch, he he is to
answer for all Disorders, Misrules, Riots, Tumults and what unquietness
soever, shall happen in the Town or Fort, and that if any of these shall fall
out to be, he is to commit the parties so offending, to the Provost Marshall,
making the Governor therewith acquainted, that the offender may receive such
punishment, as his fault shall deserve, of what quallity soever he be.

At the setting of the watch, he is to repair to the place of Arms, with his
Gorget about his neck, if his company have not the Guard, there to be present
with the Sargeant Mayor, at the drawing of the Billets for the Guards, that he
may the better know the strength of his watch, and how the companies are
disposed upon their Guards.

He is to remain from the setting of the watch upon the main court of Guard,
or Guard appointed for him and his Rounders that if any occasion present it
self wherein his endeavor is to be used, he may be the readier found to
receive the chief Officers direction, or to reform any abuses that shall come
to his knowledge, by the misdemeanors of any to be found in the camp, town
or fort.

The Ports being shut, and the word delivered out from the Governor, he is to
see that al his Gentlemen, appointed for his assistants, do come upon their
guard, where he is so to order it that by drawing of Billets according to their
lots, they may execute their rounds, whither first, second, third. etc. and
after the Corporalls have set out their centinells, he is to pass from his
court of guard, with three or four of his assistants, and so to make the round
about the camp, town, or fort, from guard to guard, receiving from every
Corporal the word of guet, that their be no error, or abuse, by variety of
word: after which he is to go into the court of guard, to see that such
officers, rounders, and soldiers, appointed for that guard, be there present
upon their guard, then he shall search the pieces whither they be charged with
Bullet, and that the soldiers be furnished with poulder and match for the
better defense of the guard, committed to his charge, so commanding and
inioyning every officer, and soldier to execute his duty, for there better
security of the camp, town, or fort: he shall depart to the next guard there
to do the like, and so from guard to guard, until he has visited all the
guards and centinells of his watch, giving in charge to the officers of each
guard to send forth their rounders, according to their order and directions.

Further he shall command all disordred people (untimely sitting up late in
usual assemblies, whither in private meetings, public tap-houses or such like
places) unto their rests, for which he shall cause all fire and candles to be
put out and raked up in the town, and such night walkers, or unruly persons
whom he shall meet in the streets, he shall either send to their lodgings,
or to the Provost Marshall, according as their misdemeanou^ shall require.

He being returned to his own court of guard shall see his rounders set forth
every one according to his order of Billet, from hour to hour, and he shall
inform himself from these rounders which walk their rounds, two hours
before day break, whither the Captains and their guards, and their companies
be in arms according to their duties: if they be not he shall walk around
toward the morning unto those Guards, and cause them to be put in arms, and
shall inform the governor of those Officers neglects, that they may receive
punishment: after this at the discharge of the watch, he is with his guard to
attend the Sergeant Major for the safe opening of the Ports.

At the opening of the Ports, he shall cause the people to stay that are to
go out of the Town, a pretty distance from his guard, that they may give no
incombrance to his guard, until such time, as he has sent out certain
Sergeants to discover forth right, and upon each side, as far as the limmits
of that fort are prescribed: At the return of the Sergeant, he shall cause
those of the Town to go out leisurely and without thronging or confusion, and
those without to come in, in like manner, warning the Gards to stand in arms
one hour after.

From thence he shall return to the maine Guard or place of arms to assist
the Serieant Mayor for the disposing of such men as are appointed unto ^^eir
several business and works of the Colony for the whole day following: and
likewise to see that those Captains, who have the Guard, do put in execution
the commandments of the Marshall for the trayning and disciplining of their
men for the better inabling them to the service of the Colony.

After which he shall do well to present himself before the Governor, or
chief Officer, to understand his further commands.

It shall be his duty the time being come, when the general morning work is
to be left off, to cause the Drum to beat, and with his Guard of Rounders to
assist the Captains or Capt. to bring the laborers into the Church to hear
divine service, which being ended he is to return to the maine Court of
Guard, there to be present for the ordering of all matters whatsoever to
happen, during his time of being Captain of the watch, and when it shall so
fall out that the Indians do at any time come in way of trade or visitation
unto the Camp, town or fort, he shall leave order with the Guards that the
suffer not them to enter before such time as they have made him acquainted
first of their being there, who shall inform the Governor to know his
pleasure, which being understood he shall so accomplish, at al times,
appointing Guards upon such Indians, that they do not steal any of out
^ooles, Axes, Howes, Swords, Pieces or what thing else; and that none of our
people talk publicly or privately with them, or that they truck or trade with
them, or do any other unorderly Act, without leave granted for the same from
the Governor, or chief Officer, the omission of which duty, will be required
at his hands.

He must likewise take notice of all such breaches of the public Laws and
Articles, as shall be committed in the time of his Guard, and accordingly
command such persons to the Provost Marshall, as shall be found trespassers
and breakers of the said Laws and Articles.

At the time or hours appointed for the afternoon work of the Colony, every
labourer to his work, and every craftsman to his occupation, Smiths, Ioyners,
Carpenters, Brick makers and. He shall cause the drum to beat again, to
draw and call forth the people unto their labor, when again the work on all
hands toward night being to be left off, he is to cause the drum likewise
then to beat, and as before assist the Capt: with the whole company to bring
them to evening prayer.

If it shall so be that he be Capt. of the watch upon Sunday, it shall be
his duty to see that the Saboath be no ways profaned, by any disorders,
gaming, drunkenness, intemperate meeting, or such like, in public or private,
in the streets or within the houses.

It shall be his duty half an hour before the divine service, morning and
evening, to shut the Ports and place Sentinels, and the Bell having tolled the
last time, he shall search all the houses of the town, to command every one, of
what quality soever (the sick and hurt excepted) to repair to Church, after
which he shall accompany all the guards with their arms, (himself being last)
into the Church, and lay the keys before the Governor.

If at any time any alarm be taken, he is to strengthen himself from the
maine court of guard, taking a competent proportion of that guard, for the
securing of his person, and so to repair to the place where the alarm was
given, to inform himself by what means the alarm came, causing his rounders
to command all guards to be in arms for the readier execution and resistance
of any peril, and conservation of their charge, and if he find the alarm to
be truly given, and that the enemy approach the Fort, town, or camp, he is to
send to advertise the Governor or chief officers to know his directions for
the assembling of guards, and ordering and drawing a force, for the better
prevention of the enemies designs.

Lastly, when the guard is set, and another Captain has the watch, he shall
present himself before the Governor or chief Commander, to give account unto
him of all such accidents, trespasses and neglects, as have been committed
during the time of his watch.

Thus to conclude, though his office amongst many others be a chief and
principal office, and there be many weighty and frequent duties required in
this great duty of the Captain of the watch, yet these are the most essential
and necessariest which I can yet advise, the nearest to concern us.

Instructions of the Marshall, for the better inabling of a Captain, to the
executing of his charge in this present Colonie. June the 22. 1611.
THat Captain that will honestly and religiously discharge himself, and the
duty entrusted to him, shall do well to conceive of himself, as the master
of a family, who is at all times so to govern himself, as knowing assuredly
that all the crimes and trespasses of his people under him shall be exacted at
his hands, not only by his superior officer and Judge here, but by the great
Judge of Judges, who leaves not unpunished the sins of the people, upon the
Magistrates, in whose hands the power and sword of Justice and authority is
committed, to restrain them from all delinquences, misdeeds and trespasses.
And moreover since the Captain is to know, that not only the command of their
civil duties is at his directions, for which he is to answer, but likewise al
their actions and practices which shall break forth in them, contrary to the
divine prescriptions of Piety and Religion: their periuries, blasphemies,
profaneness, ryots, and what disorders soever, and generally all their
breaches of both the sacred Tables, divine, and morrall, to GOD and man, and in
this place most especially, where the work assumed, has no other ends but
such as may punctually advance the glory, and propagation of the heavenly
goodness, for which so many religious laws and ordinances are established,
and declared, all tending to the subsisting of a Colony, the first seed-plot
and settlement of such a new temporary kingdom and state, as may reduce, and
bring poor misbeleeuing miscreants, to the knowledge of the eternal kingdom
of God (therefore by him first shut up in misbeliefe, that in his due time,
when it should so please him, he might again on them show mercy) It is
carefully therefore by each Captain to be considered, how precious the life of
a poor soldier is, but how much more precious his soul, and that he make
conscience how he expose the first to apparent ruin and mischief, or suffer
the other to run on into headlong destruction: for the first let his wisdom,
knowledge, and circumspection be ever awake, and ready how to employ, and when
and with what assurances, regards and cautions, either left to his own power,
or prescribed him by virtue of these from the Marshall, and for the other, let
him first be mindful to give witnesses in his own life, how careful he is
to please God, who must bless all that he undertakes, and walk himself in a
noble example of Justice and truth; which does not only enforce a reputation
and respect from other men, but an imitation and following of the like by other
men: And unto this may the diverse and frequent changes and strictness of the
place where we are, and the hardness of the many with whom he shall have to do,
with other chances and difficulties be motives sufficient to persuade him, in
which yet let him remember this, that it is in vain in such place as here, to
pretend only to be virtuous and religious, except a man be virtuous and
religious indeed, and that virtue extend it self to example. But since I
assure my self that of this advice no Capt. voluntarily employing himself in
such a business as this is, and only for the business sake, has any need, I
commend him to the following instructions.

Every Captain shall (if conveniently he may) present himself before his
Colonel or Governor, once a day, to understand his commands, the which he must
be careful, neither to exceed at any time, nor be defective in their full
accomplishment, albeit he shall have a show and presentment at any time of a
better advantage, since concerning his employment he may be ignorant of the
chief commanders ends.

He shall do well to have a special eye and regard over his company, that
they as well br^ake not the public Laws, and Orders prescribed them, but
also perform all duties and services unto which they shall be for the
present commanded, the which that he may with the better aptness and
conueniency draw them unto, it shall be his duty to have knowledge, and take
notice of every one of his under Officers, offices and duties; that he may the
readier reform faults committed, either by negligence, or ignorance, and at
the time of watch he shall send his Serieant to the Serieant mayor for the
word, and if he have the watch himself, he shall after the word given out,
call upon his court of guard, all his company (unless his Sentinels) and
assembled together, humbly present themselves on their knees, and by faithful
and ze^lous prayer unto almighty God commend themselves and their endeavors to
his merciful protection.

After prayer, either the Captain himself, or some one of his under officers,
shall accompany the Centinell to the place of Guet, after which he shall search
all the pieces upon the court of guard, that they be charged with bullet
against the Captain of the watch or Sergeant Major shall come to visit them,
and also that they be furnished with Poulder and Match, for the discharge of
their duties, during the time of their watch and ward: and it is his duty,
after that the Sergeant Major or Captain of the watch have made their round
some time after midnight to walk his round, to see that his Sentinels do hold
good watch in their guet, and that all things be quiet and peaceable, and no
disorders in the town, and that if alarm be given, he give order to his
Sentinels to take it with all secrecy, without any tumult or noise made, for the
^^act performance whereof, he must have especial care that he weaken not his
guard, by giving leave unto any of them to be absent from the guard, but upon
just and lawful cause, and reason to be alleged: likewise he is to appoint
certain gentlemen for rounders in his company, the which are to make their
said rounds from hour to hour, according to the directions of the Captain of
the watch.

Further, about two hours before day, the Captain shall put on his arms, and
cause all his company to arm themselves, and so to stand in arms until one
hour after the discharge of the watch in the morning, which time expired, he
shall return with his company unto the court of guard, and there, with public
prayer, give unto almighty God humble thanks and praises, for his merciful
and safe protection that night, and commend himself and his, to his no less
merciful protection and safeguard for the day following.

And because that, during the watch, that time is appointed for the exercising
of his men, and fashioning them to their arms, he shall set up a convenient
mark by his court of guard, where he shall teach his men the exercise of
their arms, both for the comely and needful use thereof, as the offensive
practice against their enemies, at which mark his men shall discharge their
pieces twice, both morn^ng and evening, at the discharge of the watch, having
procured from the Governor some prize of encouragement due unto him that shall
shoot nearest, then he shall file and rank, and exercise his men in such
military actions, according unto such form and exercise, as he shall receive
from the Marshall, not forgetting by the way, that all the Courts of guard, and
all the members of the watch and ward, are under the command of the Capt. of
the watch.

Further, the Captain is to make it his especial duty to have religious and
manly care over the poor sick soldiers or laborers under his command, for
which cause he shall visit such as are sick, and provide so that they be
attended, their lodgings kept sweet, and their beds standing the same height
from the ground which is provided for in the public Injunctions, as likewise
he shall call for such things for them out of the store, or from the
Physicians or Surgeons chest, as the necessity of their sickness shall
require.

Further he is to know, because we are not only to exercise the duty of a
Soldier, but of the husbandman, and that in time of the vacancie of our watch
and ward we are not to live idely, therefore the Captain sending his Serieant
to the Serieant Mayor for the word, shall likewise give in charge unto his
Sergeant to make demand of the Serieant Major, what service, work, and
business he has in charge, from the Governor, to command him and his men to
go upon him the next morning, after notice whereof, he shall so provide, that
he and his men be ready at the relieuing of the morning watch, the Drum
summoning him thereunto to effect the same, for which he shall bring ^is men
unto the place of Arms, by the maine Court of guard, where the Sergeant Major,
or the Captain of the watch, shall conduct them to the place of the subsisting
business, providing them such laboring and needful Instruments or tools, as
the work for the present shall require, in which work the Captain himself
shall do exceeding worthily to take pains and labor, that his Soldiers
seeing his industry and carfulness, may with more cheerfulness love him, and
be encouraged to the performance of the like in that business whereupon they
are employed, contrariwise himself taking his case, and inioyning them to
toil and work, may breed both a weariness of the business in the employed,
and give a way unto much hatred, and contempt unto himself.

Now concerning the tools and instruments, and the furnishing his soldiers
therewith, the Captain shall send his Serieant to the store to make demand
thereof, and leaving a note under his hand for the receipt of the same, thereby
charging himself to the redeliuerie of them again at the finishing of the
work. The companies thus furnished, and being assembled in the place of arms,
the Serieant Mayor or Captain of the watch, upon their knees shall make their
public and faithful prayers unto almighty God for his blessing and protection
to attend them in this their business the whole day after succeeding, which
done the Serieant Mayor or Captain of the watch shall extract out of the
companies howsoever divided, and deliver unto every Master of the work
appointed, his propper and several Ging, to take their ways thereunto, where
the said Masters and ouer-seers of such works shall be present with them to
labor, and hold to labor such his Ginge until 9. or ten of the clock,
according unto the coldness or heat of the day, at which time he shall not
suffer any of his company to be negligent, and idle, or depart from his work,
until the Serieant mayor, or Capt. of the watch causing the drum to beat shall
fetch them in unto the Church to hear divine service, which being effected,
every man shall repair to his lodging, to provide himself of his dinner, and
to ease and rest himself until two or three of the clock in the afternoon,
acording to the heat and coldness of the day, at which time the drum
beating, the Capt: shall again draw forth his company unto the place of Arms
as a foresaid, to be disposed of as before upon their work until five or
six of the clock, at which time the drum beating as before, at the command
of the Sarjeant mayor or Capt. of the watch, they shall be by one of them brought
in again unto the Church to Evening prayer, which being ended they shall
dismiss the company; those that are to set the watch, with charge to prepare
their Arms, the others unto their rests and lodgings.

All these duties the Captain must not be ignorant nor negligent to put in
execu^ion, as being duties which will be exactly required at his hands by the
Marshall, as also so to behave himself that he may be as well beloved as
obeyed of his soldiers, that thereby they may as well know, how to obey, as he
to command, and that he endeavor by all means to conserve his men, as annoy
his enemy, and painefully to execute with all diligence such matters as he is
enjoined by his superiors, and to have no apprehension of fear, but of shame
and infamy.

Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Lieftenant to the
executing of his charge in this present Colonie June the 22. 1611.
WHen the Captain is present he is to be assisting to his Captain, in
providing that all directions that are commanded by the Superior Officer, as
well his Captain as other, be put in execution, that the company be well and
orderly governed, and such duties duly and daily performed as are enjoined by
the Governor or chief officer; and likewise that the duties of the inferior
officers or Soldiers be no less diligently and sedulously discharged, for he
being, as is said, a help, and aid unto his Captain, is therefore accountant
to and with his Captain for such omissions, disorders and neglects, as the
company shall be found faulty in.

He ought faithfully to inform his Capt: of all abuses, disorders, neglects,
and contempts that shall happen in the company, of what nature or condition
soever they be.

If his Captain shall at any time demand his opinion in any matter of
consequence, he shall faithfully and sincerely deliver it, but not presume to
advise his Capt. vndemanded, unless it be upon extraordinary occasion of present
and imminent peril.

It shall be his duty in all quarrels, braules, debates, and discontentments of
his soldiers to accord and agree them without partiallity, and with the least
troubling of his Cap. with the same, and if he cannot with his courtesies, and
gentle interposition work them into peaceable agreement, he shall then
acquaint his Captain, and afterward faithfully put in execution his Captains
directions.

He ought to train and exercise the company that they may be expert in the use
of their arms when they shall be commanded to public service. He ought
likewise to see that the inferior officers be duly obei'd the one by the other
without singularity or contradictio^, and the soldiers obey the^ all in
general, each one according to his place.

By his care every Squadron shall have his arms serviceable and clean, and at
the setting of the watch that they be provided of powder, match, and bullet,
for the defense of the guard, and if the company be unfurnished to advertise
his Captain, or send his Serieant to the munition Master, that order may be
presently taken for the supply thereof.

He shall do well, if conveniently he may, morning and evening (or at least
once a day) to present himself before his Captain, to know his commands, and
to inform his Captain, of the state of his Company.

It shall be his duty to have care that the company be ready (as is expressed in
the Captains duty) to go forth and attend the daily business, and public
labor appertayning to the Colonie, which shall be commanded by the chief
officer, In which he shall have a hand in executing, and an eye in
ouer-seeing, that every one take his due pains, and not loyter, and idly
mispend the time appointed unto the dispatch of such business.

He is to have a hearty and religious care that the soldiers do not make
breach of the laws, and duties, divine, civil, or martial, enjoined them to
observe upon so necessary reasons and strict penalties, but that he inform,
correct and punish to the utmost of his authority limited, the trespassers of
the same, or the omission of any duty whatsoever, with the approbation of his
Captain.

He is not to make it his least care to ouer-see and take charge of the
lodging and bedding of all in general in his company, that according unto the
public edict the preservation of their healths be provided for, and that one
point of slothfullnesse in the common soldier prevented, and met with, of lying
upon or to near the ground, which neglect in the officer has bin the loss of
many a man.

For his order of command and march in the field, and quartering he shall be
appointed the manner thereof by the Marshall, when occasion of service shall so
require, like-wise the order of trayning and exercising his Captains company
he shall have under the marshalls hand.

He is amongst other his duties most carefully, like a charitable and well
instructed Christian, merciful and compassionate, make often and daily survey
of such of his company as shall be visited with sickness, or wounded by any
casualty of war, gunpoulder, or other-wise, in which he shall take such
order that the lodgings of such as shall be so sick or hurt, be sweet and
cleanely kept, themselves attended and dressed, and to the uttermost of his
power to procure either from the store, or the Physician and Surgeons chest,
such comforts, healps, and remedies, as may be administered and applied unto
them, and to have care that they be not defrauded of those means and remedies
which are for them delivered out of the said store or chests.

And for that this officer is in the abscence of his Captain to be called unto
the Marshall Court as his deputy, for the better inhabling of his judgment,
when his opinion is to be required in the censure of offenses and crimes of
what quality soever, which shall be brought thither to be sentenced, I refer him
to the abstract of the laws in brief anexed unto the duty of his Capt.

Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of an Ensign to the
executing of his charge in this present Colonie, June the 22. 1611.
IT is requisite for every soldier to stand upon his credit and reputation,
proposing unto himself that their can be no less equal, or to be compared
with dishonor, and sure in matters of arms and their execution, what
dishonor can be greater then the loss of the ensign, for which it ought to
be committed to the charge of a right valiant, and well governed soldier, who
may not leave nor loose it, but where the loss of his life shall quit him of
that duty.

So far as touches his command, or government in the company, he is to know
that he has no command where his Captain or Lieftenant are present, but in
their absence I refer him to the duty of the Capt: which he is to execute as
religiously, painfully, and circumspectly as the Captain: he being answerable
unto his Captain for all defects, neglects, disorders, and contempts of
duties, in his company whatsoever.

In the government of his company he is to be asistant unto his superior
officers, in teaching and inabling all his inferiors, every one his particular
duty, with fair persuasion and all gentleness, and sweetness of command, and if
any thing shall happen, either disorders or neglects of duties, it shall be fit
for him to advertise his superior officers that redress may be had, for he
has no power of himself in their presence to punish, correct, or do any act
of executions upon his companions.

When the time of exercise and training shall be of the company, he shall be
there ready and assistant unto his superior officer (if so be it his colors
be not drawn forth) for the better furtherance of him in the so training, and
disciplining of the men.

He shall see all commands of his superior Officers put in execution, and not
stand ignorantly in defense (as some have) and it is the property of the
ignorant so to do, that he is tied to no other duties, but to the carrying of
his colors. For no inferior officers duty, whether Sargeant or corporalls,
but he is to perform and execute (if they shall be by any disaster, defeat,
or visitation of sickness disabled personally to discharge it themselves)
being so commanded by his Superior officers, during the time of guard, yea the
duty of the Centinell he is to undergo, and from which neither the Captain
nor Lieftenant are exempted upon urgent occasion.

In the happening of any dispute, quarrel, or debate amongst the soldiers, the
same being brought to his knowledge, he shall do his best to end and compound,
whose authority and persuasions, if they shall not be powerful enough to
reconcile and set at one, he shall then inform his Lieftenant, or Captain:
that order with the most speed and conuenience, may be taken therein.

He shall hold it his duty to visit the sick or hurt in his company, and to his
power of them take the same care, and make the same charitable provision for,
as is inioynd both the Captain and Lieftenant.

It is his duty to command the Corporalls to bring their squadrons to his
lodging, who shall conduct them to his Lieftenant, and they both conduct them to
their Captain, at the beating of the Drum, whither for any manual labor and
work, for the Colony, or whither to be lead unto the Church at any time to
hear divine service.

He is to visit the arms of the Company, and at the setting of the watch to
take care, and so at all time, that they be not unserviceable, and if any want
be then of ma^ch, poulder, or bullet, or what else defect, he is to advertise
his Superior Officers, that they may then and at all other times be supplied
and amended.

To be brief he is an assistant to the Lieftenant in the same nature that
the Lieftenant is to the Captain, and may not by any means intrude into the
command of the one or other, they being present.

In the absence of the Captain, and Lieftenant (when he is then to be
Captain of the watch) I refer him to the duty of the said Captain of the
watch.

For his Order of march, and flying of his colors, and his carriage in the
field, and upon service, he shall be ordered and instructed by word of mouth from
the Marshall, when occasion shall be offered.

Thus mutch is needful for him to know touching his command, and his carriage
to his officers and company, so far forth as he and they are soldiers, and as
the necessity of this present state and condition which we are in does require.
But concerning the public and daily manual business which appertain to our
settling there as Planters of a Col^nie, he is to make it his duty, to be a
diligent not only ou^r-seer, but labourer, himself accompanying therein, and
seconding the example of his Captain, and industrious Lieutenant, that the
necessary and daily taskes of such works and husbandry (without which we
cannot here keep footing, nor possibly subsist) may be in due time accomplished
and brought to pass.

Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Sergeant to the
executing of his charge in this present Colonie, June the 22. 1611.
THat Captain who shall dispose of a H^lbert, by virtue whereof a Sergeant is
known, ought to make choice of a man well approved, that has passed the
inferior grades of a resolute spirit, quick apprehension, and active body, for
it is a place of great pains and promptitude, and that Sergeant who will be
able to execute his duty in sincerity and uprightness, must not be slack to
punish where it is deserved, nor over rash to abuse his authority, unbefitting
an officer of such moment.

This officer has in the absence of his superior officers the command of the
company, to see them do their duties, and observe laws and orders in all
things, and punishment of them by his Halbert, or otherwise in his discretion,
for defect or negligence in any part of order.

This officer is to attend upon the Sergeant Major for the word upon the
shutting in of the Ports, at the Governors lodging or place of arms, according
as the Sergeant Major shall appoint, then he is to give the word to his
Captain, Lieftenant, and Ensign, and unto his corporal or corporalls having
the guard.

He must see the Soldiers of his company furnished and provided with munition,
as shot, poulder, and match, at the setting of the watch.

He is to call, or cause to be called the Corporalls roll, to see who are
absent or negligent in the discharge of their duties.

He is to see each soldiers arms cleanly kept, and serviceable, and if
default be, he is to reprove the corporal for his negligence in the
ouer-sight of that duty, and to punish the soldier.

He must see the soldiers practice their arms, and therefore it is requisite
that he know the use of all sorts of arms himself.

If the watch be set by squadrons, he shall lead that squadron, that is to
watch to the Parado, and there draw Billets for his guard, and from thence lead
them to the guard.

He shall see the setting out of the Sentinels, and after shall have care that
silence and good order be kept upon the guard, and that no man depart from the
guard without the leave of him, or his corporal, and that no man be absent
above one half hour, having a special regard that he weaken not his guard,
by giving leave unto above two at a time to be absent, least he disable
himself in the performance of that duty of trust and charge which is committed
unto him of the guard.

He shall see that his corporal or corporals, do put his or their squadrons
into arms, two hours before the relieuing of the watch, who shall so abide in
arms, at least one whole hour after.

If the watch be set by whole companies, it is his duty to place every soldier
in his order, and to see them march in rank and file, and himself being
eldest Sergeant to march upon the right point in the vaunt-guard: if he be the
youngest he is to march upon the left point in the rere-ward, each taking care
of half of the company, unless when more companies march together, they be
appointed any other place by a superior officer. When the Sergeant is appointed
to lead out any shot, he shall go upon the side of the utmost rank, and see
that they take their level, and give fire, and do all things with comeliness
and leisure, and so likewise in the retrait.

A Sergeant of each company, presently after the discharge of the watch shall
be in the place of arms, or market place, to attend the Captain of the watch
to the opening of the Ports, that they may be employed by him, for the
discovery without the forts, of any ambushes or attempts of the enemy, with
such guard as he shall appoint them, the Captain of the watch having caused
all those of the town, about, to go forth, to forbear and stay until the
said Sergeants return, which Sergeants are to command those that are coming
in, to stay until those in the town are coming forth, and then they shall
discover right forth before the Port, and to both sides of the Port, so far
until the discouerers of the other forts meet where they end; the discouerers
being returned, those of the town shall be suffered to pass out leisurely,
and after those being without shall come in as leisurely, without throng or
crowd, that they be the better discerned by the guard what they are. The Ports
being open, the Sergeants shall return to their guards, where they shall
instruct their soldiers in the practice of their arms, and shall show them
the ready use of them, and do their endeavors by their best means, to
encourage the towardly, and instruct the ignorant.

If upon his guard, in the absence of his superior officer, any soldier of his
guard shall offend, he shall either punish him by his Halbert, or if the
quality of the offense so deserve he shall disarme him, and keep him prisoner
upon the guard, until the watch be releiued, and then he shall bring him to
his superior officers, that he may receive condign punishment according to the
condition of his offense.

The Sergeant ought to know every soldier, and to take notice of their
particular lodgings, and to make it a point of his duty to see that they keep
their lodgings clean, and that their beds do stand a yard about the ground,
to have an eye into their diet, their thriftinesse and conversation, to advise
them to the best, whereof he is to make report unto the Captain or chief
officer, that they may receive estimation for good, and punishment for evil
behavior.

He is to inform himself of the sick, or hurt, in the company, and to visit
them once a day, and to inquire whether they be not defrauded by the
Physicians and Surgeons, of such necessary helps as are delivered unto them,
for their preseruations and recoueries, and to inform his Captain of the
negligence and abuse of such, who should in that case deal unjustly with them
that their dishonesty may receive due punishment.

He is likewise to address himself unto the Sergeant Major, and
Store-maister, for the supplying of his company with munition, and victuals,
upon any occasion: and concerning the munition, he is to have a principal
care, that the soldier do not spend it away in vain, but only at such times
as they are appointed for exercising and training.

He is likewise to take notice of all defects and abuses in his company, and to
inform his superior officers, that they may be redressed, and Justice take
place,

He shall with great diligence attend the commands of his Captain, and of the
Sergeant Major, and at all times put them in present execution, rebuking such
as do amiss, showing them their faults, and teaching them by a good example
in himself, to tread in the way of all civility and goodness. If any debate
shall happen between soldier and soldier, he having knowledge thereof,
shall do his indeauor to agree, and reconcile them, that it come not to his
superior officers, and if through obstinacy he cannot agree them, he shall
commit them, or inform his superior officers, who may take order therein.

He is to provide that none of the company be absent when the Drum shall call
them forth to work, in which works he is to be a president himself, both by
laboring in the same, and calling upon others to do the like,

He is to go to the Store, to take out such Tools, as are required for the
works in hand, and there to vnder-write unto the book of the store-Maister,
or unto a note to be filed, thereby charging himself to be accountable for the
said tools, when the work shall be performed, over which he is to have a
regard, that they be not neglectfully laid up, spoiled nor broken without
examining by what means they came so broken, that the wilful breaker thereof
may receive punishment, and the said tool or tools so broken, withal the
pieces, he shall bring unto the store, to show the same for his better
discharge.

Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Corporal unto the
discharge of his duty in this present Colonie, June the 22. 1611.
THe Corporal is in grade and dignity above the private soldier, and
therefore care ought to be had in the choosing of this officer, for that it is
an office of good account, and by neglect of this duty, many inconveniences may
come upon a camp, town, or fort, therefore it is fit that he surmount and
excel his inferiors in valor, diligence and judgment, and likewise in the
practice and use of all sorts of arms, whereby he may the better be enabled
to instruct and teach this squadron committed to his charge.

The Corporal ought (having the third part of the company given him in
command) to sort and assist them in their quartering or lodging, to have a care
that they be clean and sweet, and that their beds in the same be laid three
foot from the ground, he is to carry a hand over their dye^, thriftinesse,
and conversation, and to advise and instruct them at all times to demean
themselves as good Christians ought to do, and to make report thereof unto his
Captain or chief officer, that from them they may receive credit and
estimation for good behavior, and punishment and disgrace for their
misdemenours.

He is to have a special care of their Arms to see them duly furnished and
kept in order, and when the Drum beats to be in a readiness at the
Colonies; and if any be absent, he shall make it known to his Sergeant or
superior officer.

When he marches, he is to lead a file, he ought to be daily conversant
with his little company committed unto his charge, and the company being in
the field, to lodge with them, and provide to his power for their wants, and to
instruct and teach them how to use and handle the weapon they carry: Likewise,
to remember well how each one is armed and appointed when he receives him
into charge, then to see no part of his furniture or arms be broken or
spoiled, but to have care that they be preserved clean and seruice-able.

He ought to have a vigilant eye upon the good behavior of his company, not
suffering them to use any unlawful and prohibited games, nor that they give
them selves to excess of drinking, surfitting and riot, but that they be
conformable to all the Martial laws: that they likewise make spare of their
pay or victuals, the better to furnish themselves in comely and decent manner,
with apparel and other necessaries fit and requisite for them, wherein the
Corporal ought to use his utmost endeavor.

In presence of his Captain, or superior officer, he is to take upon him no
more then the condition of his office does require, but diligently to attend
and execute what they shall command, that his example may serve for a President
to the rest of his squadron.

At the setting of the watch he is to see that they be furnished with poulder,
Bullet and match, and that their arms be serviceable and soldier-like.

If the company watch by squadrons, he and his squadron shall be brought by the
Sergeant unto the place of watch, and from him receive the word and directions,
in what manner, and where he shall place his Sentinels, whether by day or night^
which he is to see performed.

When the Corporal with his squadron shall be brought to the place where he
and they shall watch, he and they must provide eft-soones for wood for fyring
upon the guard, that beside for their own comfort, they may have fire ready
always upon the guarde to light their match upon any proffered occasion.

He is to cause silence to be kept upon the court of guard, and to govern
the watch, so that the labor be equally divided of his squadron, either in
watch, work, or service, and to take care in all respects, that they perform
the duties of good and honest soldiers.

His Sentinels being placed, he is to let none pass without the word, unless
it be the Captain of the watch, or Sergeant Major, unto whom (after he shall
have perfect knowledge of them,) he is to deliver the word at their first
round, but before the delivery of the word, he shall take the Captain of the
watch and Sergeant Major alone within his guard, the corporal being
accompanied with half a dozen of shot with Match in Cock, to have an eye over
the rest of the rounders that accompany the Captain of the watch or Sarjeant
Major, and not to suffer the rounders to come within the centinell, and if at
any time of the night after their first round, the Sergeant Mayor or Captain
of the watch shall go their round, as it is their duties, then they are to
give the word to the Corporal, unless they mistrust the doubt the memory of
any Corporal: the Corporal is not to go out single to take the word of any
round but to take two, or three, or more of his guard with him, and if it
shall be a round of more then two, then he shall ^^^w out all his men in his
guard in their arms, the Corporal shall at no time (to receive the word)
pass beyond the Centinell, but make him that has the word to come forward
within the Centinell, and shall cause the rest to stand without the Centinell,
and those that are out by the Corporal for his guard shall keep their eyes
and arms in a readiness over him that is to give or take the word of the
Corporal, until such time as the Corporal be satisfied of him.

He must make good his guard until he be releiued the which he shall the
better do if he keep his men together upon the guard; he must visit the
Sentinels sometimes unawares to them, and must be ready to go to them at the
first call.

He shall put his men in arms two hours before the discharge of the watch,
so to remain one hour after.

He shall warn his Centinells to make noe alarm but upon just cause, and
then with as much silence as may be, and in like silence he must advertise the
Captain of the watch, and the next guards unto him, and so without notice or
sign of contusio^ from one guard unto an other.

If upon his guard any of his soldiers shall misdemeane himself, or offend in
any of the public laws, divine, civil, or martial, he shall bring him to
his superior officer, then upon the guard, that he may receive punishment.

His duty is to provide that none of his Squadron, be absent, when the drum
shall call to any labor, or work, or at what time soever they shall be
commanded there unto for t^^ ^eruice of the Collonie, in the performance of
which said works he is to be an example of the rest of his Squadron by his
own laboring therein, and by encouraging and calling upon others at any time
negligent, idle and slothful, that thereby giving encoraging to his superior
officers he may be held by them worthy of a higher place.

He must likewise receive such instruments and tools, as spades, shouels,
axes, etc. employed in the work, from his Sarjeant to dispose, and to deliver
the same unto the laborers with all the care he may, to his utmost, that none
of them be broken, lost, or wilfully spoiled, without drawing the parties so
breaking, loosing and wilfully spoiling the same into punishment; and after the
work done he shall gather the said tools in again and re-deliuer them up
unto his Sargeant, all, and the same, who is to be accountable unto the master
of the store unto whose book he has underwritten for the receipt of them.

And by reason he is well knowing of every man in his Squadron, and thereby
cannot but miss the pretense of any man from any duty whatsoever, sooner then
happily the superior officers may, his care shall be to attend his squadron to
the usual works and day-labours, and unto frequent prayers, and the divine
service at all times, and upon all the days in the week, giving due notice
unto his superior officer, of the neglect of either duties in their kind that
reformation may follow.

He shall not suffer any gaming, hear any profane lewd speeches, swearing,
brawling, etc. or see any disorder whatsoever upon his court of guard, or
elsewhere, without present information given thereof unto his superior
officer, that the offenders may be duly punished.

He shall take notice of all bands and proclamations published by the
General, procuring a copy of the same from the Provost Marshall, the same
duly to be read unto his squadron, that they may be made the perfecter in the
knowledge of them, and thereby learn the better to forbear the trespassing in
forbidden things, remembering the penalty of the same, and execute things
commanded, considering the reward thereof, whether in Camp, Town or Forte,
Field or garrison.

He shall read, or cause to be read, the Soldiers duty, every time of his
guarde in some convenient time and place, during the same, thereby to remember
them the better of their general duties.

Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a private soldier, to
the executing of his duty in this present Colonie. June 22. 1611.
IT is requisite that he who will enter into this function of a soldier, that
he dedicate himself wholly for the planting and establishing of true religion,
the honor of his Prince, the safety of his country, and to learn the art
which he prosesseth, which is in this place to hold war, and the service
requisite to the subsisting of a colonie: There be many men of mean descent,
who have this way attained to great dignity, credit, and honor.

Having thus dedicated himself with a constant resolution, he ought to be
diligent, careful, vigilant and obedient, and principaly to have the fear of
God, and his honor in greatest esteem.

In making choice of his familiar accquaintance, let him have care that they be
of religious and honest conditions, not factious nor mutenous murmurers, nor
evil languaged and worse disposed persons: his choice being made he is to
carry him self discreet, temperate, quiet and friendly, withholding himself
from being to lavish of speech, for such as take liberty unto themselves to
talk licentiously, to slander, rail, and backbite others, do usually make
bankrout of their friends, of estimation, and of their own peace and quiet of
conscience.

He must be careful to serve God privately and publicly; for all professions
are thereunto tied, that carry hope with them to prosper, and none more highly
then the soldier, for he is ever in the mouth of death, and certainly he
that is thus religiously armed, fights more confidently and with greater
courage, and is thereby protected through manifold dangers, and otherwise
vnpreuentable events.

He must be no blasphemer nor swearer, for such an one is contemptible to God
and the world, and shall be assured to be found out and punished by the divine
Justice: whereof we have instant examples.

He must refrain from dicing, carding, and Idle gaming: for common gamsters,
although they may have many good parts in them, yet commonly they are not
esteemed according to their better qualities, but censured according to their
worst, procuring enemies, questions, brawles, and a thousand following
inconveniences.

He must not set his mind ouer-greedily upon his belly, and continual
feeding, but rest himself contented with such provisions as may be
conveniently provided, his own labor purchase, or his means reach unto:
above all things he must eschew that detestable vice of drunkenness; for then
a man is not apt nor good for any thing, and by that beastly disorder, many
great armies have miscarried, and much disquiet and tumults raised in camp,
and civil towns, whereupon does fail the sword of Justice upon their necks,
which in that case they have compelled to be drawn.

Chastity is a virtue much commended in a soldier, when uncleanness does
defile both body and soul, and makes a man stink in the nostrils of God and
man, and lays him open to the malice and sword of his enemy, for commonly it
makes a man effeminate, cowardly, lasie, and full of diseases, and surely such
who have unlawful women still trudging about with the^, or in whom custom has
taken away the sense of offending in that kind, commonly come to dishonorable
ends.

He is tied in his entering or inrowling into any company, to take his oath of
faithfulness, and sincere service to his Prince, General and Captain: to be
conformable to the laws provided for the advancement of the intended
business, and for the cherishing of the good therein, and punishment of the
evil.

He must be true-hearted to his Capt. and obey him and the rest of the officers
of the Camp, Town, or Fort, with great respect, for by the very oath which he
takes he does bind himself and promise to serve his Prince, and obey his
officers: for the true order of war is fitly resembled to true religion
ordained of God, which binds the soldier to observe justice, loyalty,
faith, constancy, patience, silence, and above all, obedience, through the
which is easily obtained the perfection in arms, and is as a means to
atchieue great enterprises, though never so difficult: certainly, who wants
the virtue of obedience and patience, though never so valiant otherwise, yet is
he unworthy of the same name.

A soldier must patiently suffer the adversities and travails which do fall
out in the courses and chances of war: he must not be ouer-greedy, nor hasty
of his pay, albeit he may stand in some want thereof, but must with a cheerful
alacrity show his constancy, avoiding by all possible means, rebellions and
mutenies, which most upon such pettish occasiones are run into: by no means
must he be a pertaker with such mutiners, for the end of such is sharp and
shameful death.

If in Skirmishes Incounters, or surprise of town the enemies be vanquished,
let him set all his care and diligence in execution of the victory with his
Arms, and not in rifling and spoiling for trash, for so he shall be accounted
an unruly freebooter, beside innumerable are the disorders and mischefes which
do happen by ravenous Pillagers, many times to the dishoner of the action, and
to the loss of their lives, therefore he shall pursue the victory until the
enemy be wholly ended and the place fully carried and possessed, the Guards
placed, and liberty granted from the chief Commander to sack and spoil,
wherein by any means let him avoid murder and cruelty, and violation of
women, for those are odious to God and man, rather in such cases let him show
himself pitiful and merciful unto the vanquished, rather defending the
silly women and Children then procuring their hurt and damage, for in so doing
it will be right acceptable to God and his Commanders.

Such Arms as he is appointed to serve with, whither Musket, Caliuer or Target,
let him be very dilligent to use all his industry to excel in the use of
them, for thereby he may conserve his own life and his fellows, for the which
purpose he shall call upon his Sergeant and his Corporal to instruct him
therein, until he come unto perfection.

He must learn the several sounds of the Drum, whereby he may obey that
which he is commanded; for the Drum oftentimes is the voice of the Commander,
he shall carefully note and mark the signs made by the Captain and
officers, without talking or prattling unto his next companions: for that is
vnbesitting a Soldier, and makes him incapable to hear what is given in
command.

In skirmishes and incounters he shall be resolute and valiant, for that
soldier which is timorous and fearful can never bring his heart to any hearty
enterprise, nor dares to attempt any hot, bold, or audacious charge or
service, by reason of his cowardly spirit and fear.

He must be careful to be always vigilant and ready, being placed for a
Centinell, or in the Court of guard, where he shall not put of his arms,
until he have leave from the Captain: for therein consists the security of
the Camp, Town, or Fort.

He shall do well to keep his fidelity unspotted to his Prince and General,
although his sufferings may be intolerable and infinite, and shall not fly
unto the enemy: for to be branded with infamy of a traitor is a foul and
odious offense, and rigourously punished among all nations, and never yet
traitor came to good end; of which we have examples infinite.

He must not be shifting from company to company, but serve in the company
where he first began, and if at any time he shall depart for his preferment,
let him demand the good liking of his Captain, who if he shall deny it him
in such a case, it shall be imputed no offense in him to appeal unto the
General or chief officer.

At the sound of the Drum, for the setting of the watch with his arms being
fix and serviceable he shall repair to his colors, and it shall be
commendable in him by the way to call upon his Corporal, so that all the
Squadron meeting together at the Corporals lodging may attend the Corporal
unto the colors, and if he be unprovided of munition he shall acquaint his
Corporal therewith, who shall see him furnished.

When the company or squadron march to the guard he shall hold that order in
which he was placed by his Sergeant, marching in a comely and graceful manner,
and being armed at the place of guard he shall pose his arms according unto
the Corporalls direction, and behave himself in all his actions as befitting a
religious Soldier in that holy place of guard, without doing any act of
profaneness, disorder, or ought else, tending to the pollution of the same
either in word or deed.

When his Corporal shall appoint him forth for Centinell, he shall shoulder
his piece, both ends of his match being alight, and his piece charged, and
p^ined, and bullets in his mouth, there to stand with a careful and waking
eye, until such time as his Corporal shall relieve him, and to let no man
pass nor come up to him, but to force him stand, and then to call his
Corporal.

He must harken diligently and look well about him from his place of Centinell
for the approach of any about the Camp, Town, or Fort, or the dich thereof, or
if he hear any noise, to call his Corporal to advertise him of the same.

He must have a special care that he sleep not upon his Centinell, nor set
his arms out of his hands: for therein he makes himself subject for any
passenger by to take away his life, beside the general inconvenience that may
come upon the Camp, Town or Fort.

His Corporal having releiued him and brought him to the guard, he shall do
well to read the Laws and ordinances for the government of the Camp, Town, or
Fort, constituted and prescribed by the Marshall, the better to enable his
memory for the exact observance of those laws whereby he shall not only avoid
the trespassing against the same, but also get the reputation of a well ordered
and governed soldier.

Such gentlemen or others, as are appointed by their Captain for rounders, and
approved by the Sergeant Major or Captain of the watch, amongst them those
rounders that are appointed to attend the Captain of the watch on his guard
are to receive their directions from him, as Likewise those of the companies
upon the guards for their order of rounding, according to the time of the night
in what hour they shall make their Rounds,

The Rounders from the guard, from the Captain of the watch, are to visit the
Centinells, and Courts of guards, making their rounds upon the rampart,
harkning and listening and looking over into the ditches, if they can hear or
see, or discover any troops, or men near the town, taking care besides that
there be good watch kept both by the Centinells, and upon the court of guard,
and if any noise or tumult be near the rampart, they may step down and
inform themselves of it, and bring the trespassers to the next guard,
committing them there until after the round made they have acquainted the
Capt. of the watch of such disorders. The rounds from the Ports are to round
the streets to take in charge that no disorders, breaking up, or fiering of
houses of yc store, or roberies, magazin, riots or tumult in Taphouses, or in
the streets, or in private houses at hours untimely be committed, and the
offenders to bring to the next guard, and to inform the Captain of the watch;
All rounders are to be subject and obedient unto the Captain of the watch and
his commands during his time of watch.

Two hours before day he must be ready in arms with his piece charged and
provided, and a match a light at both ends and bullets in mouth, there to
attend the command of the Corporal until further directions be given, and at
the time appointed for the exercise of his arms, he shall be tractable and
obedient to his officers executing such commands as they shall impose upon him,
that he may be the better trained and inhabled to offend his enemy, and to
defend himself.

He shall be careful to observe al words of command, postures and actions,
according to the order of training published by the marshall.

The exercise being ended and the prisewon and lost he shall pose his arms at
the court of Guard, and there give diligent atendance that he be at no time
absent from his Guard, above one hour, without leave from his Officer, and
that not without leave of his Officer.

The watch being relieved and he free from the guard he is to dispose of the
rest of the time for his own particular use until next morning at the
discharge of the watch: when at the call of the drum, he shall attend at his
corporalls lodging there to receive such instrument, or tool as the business of
that day shall require, from whence he shall march to the place of arms or
maine court of guard; there to be disposed of by the captain of the watch for
that day service of the Colonies, in which he shall do his best endeavor like
a painful and industrious servant of the Colonies to discharge his duty for
the furtherance of his work, and incouragment of such who shall be the more
stirred up by his example of goodness, to the imitation of the like: and thus
doing, he shall give cause unto the General, unto his Captain, and chief
officers, to take notice of his painfulnesse, who may according to his desert
in time give him advancement for the same.

He shall continue at his work until the drum beat, and that his Captain,
his officers or overseers of the work, give order unto a cessation for the
time, and for the same purpose attends to lead him in, whom he shall orderly
and comely follow into the Camp, Town or Fort, by his said Captain, officer
or ouerseer him meeting, to be conducted unto the church to hear divine
service, after which he may repair to his house or lodging to prepare for his
dinner, and to repose him until the drum shall call him forth again in the
afternoon, when so (as before) he shall acompany his chief officer unto the
field, or where else the work lies, and there to follow his easy task until
again the drum beat to return home: at which time according as in the
forenoone, he shall follow his chief officer unto the church to hear divine
service and after dispose of himself as he shall best please, and as his own
business shall require; with this caution carefully to preserve the tool or
Instrument with which he wrought to serve his turn again the next day as he
will answer the contrary upon the peril prescribed

Concerning his order of march and carriage in the field when occasion shall
present it self, he will easily acquire and learn the same by experience,
provided that he be careful to march, rank, and file, and not straggle, or be
disobedient unto proclamations of the General for therein consists the
princicipall part of his duty, until when I leave him with this caveat, that
he diligently mark, consider and remember the orders, which the higher
officers do observe, in ordering their files and ranks, and surueying their
squadrons of footmen, and to the placing of the great Artillery in the march
and settled camp, and the plot of the quartering, according to the disposition
of the ground where the camp shall then be, with the manner of entrenching,
placing of Ordinances and Guards for the defense of the same, that in the
knowledge and execution of these duties, the General having understanding of
his promptitude and diligence may confer upon him, and call him unto place of
preferment and command.

That there be no neglect found in him, in his marching to the Guard or Field,
and that in the same he do not forget or leave behind him any piece or
parcel of his Arms appointed him by the Marshall for his own defense, or
offense of the enemy.

A Prayer duly said Morning and Evening upon the Court of Guard, either by the
Captain of the watch himself, or by some one of his principal officers.
MErciful Father, and Lord of heaven and earth, we come before thy presence to
worship thee in calling upon thy name, and giving thanks unto thee, and though
our duties and our very necessities call us heereunto: Yet we confess our
hearts to be so dull and untoward, that unless thou be merciful to us to
teach us how to pray, we shall not please thee, nor profit our selves in these
duties.

We therefore most humbly beseech thee to raise up our hearts with thy good
spirit, and so to dispose us to prayer, that with true seruencie of heart,
feeling of our wants, humbleness of mind, and faith in thy gracious promises,
we may present our suites acceptably unto thee by our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.

And thou our Father of al mercies, that have called us unto thee, hear us and
pity thy p^0re servants, we have indeed sinned wonderously against thee
through our blindness of mind, profaneness of spirit, hardness of heart,
self love, worldliness, carnal lusts, hypocrisy, pride, vanity,
unthankfulness, infidelity, and other our native corruptions, which being
bred in us, and with us, have defiled us even from the womb, and unto this
day, and have broken out as plague sores into innumerable transgressions of all
thy holy laws, (the good ways whereof we have wilfully declines) and have
many times displeased thee, and our own consciences in choosing those things
which thou have most justly and severely forbidden us. And besides all this we
have outstood the gracious time and m^anes of our conversion, or at least not
stooped and humbled our selves before thee, as we ought, although we have
wanted none of those helps, which thou vouchsafest unto thy wandering children
to fetch them home withal, for we have had together with thy glorious works,
thy word calling upon us without, and thy spirit within, and have been
solicited by promises, by threatenings, by blessings, by chastisings, and by
examples, on all hands: And yet our corrupted spirits cannot become wise before
thee, to humble themselves, and to take heed as we ought, and wish to do.

Wherefore O Lord God, we do acknowledge thy patience to have been infinite
and incomparable, in that thou have been able to hold thy hands from revenging
thy self upon us thus long, and yet please to hold open the doze of grace,
that we might come in unto thee and be saved.

And now O blessed Lord God, we are desirous to come unto thee, how wretched
soever in our selves, yea our very wretchedness sends us unto thee: unto thee
with who^ the fatherless, and he that has no helper finds mercy, we come to
thee in thy Sons name not daring to come in our own: In his name that came for
us, we come to thee, in his ^^diation whom thou have sent: In him O Father, in
whom thou have professed thy self to be well pleased, we come unto thee, and
do most humbly beseech thee to pity us, and to save us for thy mercies sake
in him.

O Lord our God our sins have not outbidden that blood of thy holy Son which
speaks for our pardon, nor can they be so infinite, as thou art in thy mercies,
and our hearts (O God thou see them,) our hearts are desirous to have peace
with thee, and war with our lusts, and wish that they could melt before thee,
and be dissolved into godly mourning for all that filth that has gone through
them. and defiled them. And our desires are now to serve and please thee, and
our purposes to endeavor it more faithfully. we pray thee therefore for the
Lord Jesus sake seal by in our consciences thy gracious pardon of all our
sins past, and give us to feel the consolation of this grace shed abroad in
our hearts for our eternal comfort and salvation: and that we may know this
persuasion to be of thy spirit, and not of carnal presumption, (blessed God)
let those graces of thy spirit, which do accompany salvation, be powered out
more plentifully upon us, increase in us all godly knowledge, faith, patience,
temperance, meekness, wisdom, godliness, love to thy Saints and service,
zeal of thy glory, judgment to discern the difference of good and ill, and
things present which are temporary, and things to come which are eternal

Make us yet at the last wise-hearted to lay up our treasure in heaven, and so
set our affections more upon things that are above, where Christ sits at thy
right hand: And let all the vain and transitory inticements of this poor
life, appear unto us as they are, that our hearts may no more be entangled and
bewitched with the love of them.

O Lord, O God, our God, thou have dearly bought us for thine own self, give
us so honest hearts as may be glad to ^eelt the possession of thine own. And
be thou so gracious, as yet to take them up, though we have desperately held
thee out of them in times past, and dwell in us, and reign in us by thy
spirit, that we may be sure to reign with thee in thy glorious kingdom,
according to thy promise through him that has purchased that inheritance for
all that trust in him.

And seeing thou do so promise these graces to us, as that thou requirest
our industry and diligence in the use of such means as serve thereto (good
Lord) let us not so cross our prayers for grace, as not to seek that by
diligence, which we make show to seek by prayer, least our own waied condemn
us of hypocrisy. Stir us up therefore (O Lord) to the frequent use of
prayer, to reading, hearing, and meditating of thy holy word, teach us to
profit by the conversation of thy people, and to be profitable in our own,
make us wise to apprehend all oportunities of doing or receiving spiritual
good, strengthen us with grace to observe our hearts and ways, to contain
them in good order, or to reduce them quickly, let us never think any company
so good as thine, nor any time so well spent, as that which is in thy service,
and beautifying of thine Image in our selves or others.

Particularly we pray thee open our eyes to see our natural infirmities, and
to discover the advantages which Satan gets thereby. And give us care to strive
most, where we are most assaulted and endamaged.

And thou O God, that have promised to bless thine own ordinances, bless all
things unto us, that we may grow in grace and in knowledge, and so may shine as
light in this dark world, giving good example to all men, and may in our time
lie down in peace of a good conscience, embaulmed with a good report, and may
leave thy blessings entailed unto ours after us for an inheritance.

These O Father, are our special suits, wherein we beseech thee to set forth
the wonderful riches of thy grace toward us, as for this life, and the things
thereof, we crave them of thee so far as may be for our good, and thy glory,
beseeching thee to provide for us as unto this day in mercy. And when thou will
humble or exalt us, govern us so long, and so far in all conditions and
changes, as we may clean fast unto thee our God unchangeably, esteeming thee
our portion, and sufficient inheritance for evermore. Now what graces we crave
for our selves, which are here before thy presence, we humbly beg for all
those that belong unto us, and that by duty or promise we owe our prayers
unto, beseeching thee to be as gracious unto them, as unto our own souls, and
specially to such of them, as in respect of any present affliction or
temptation may be in special need of some more speedy help or comfort from
thy mighty hand.

Yea our Lord God we humbly desire to bless with our prayers the whole Church
more specially our nation, and therein the kings Majesty our Sovereign, his
Queen and royal seed, with all that be in authority under him, beseeching
thee to follow him and them with those blessings of thy protection and
direction, which may preserve them safe from the malice of the world, and of
Satan, and may yield them in their great places faithful to thee for the good
of thy people, and their own eternal happiness and honor.

We beseech thee to furnish the Churches with faithful and fruitful
ministers, and to bless their lives and labors for those merciful uses, to
which thou have ordained them, sanctify thy people O God, and let them not
deceive themselves with a formalitie of religion instead of the power thereof,
give them grace to profit both by those favors, and by those chasticements
which thou have sent successively or miredly amongst them. And Lord repress
that rage of sin, and profaneness in all Christian states wh^^h breeds so
much Apostasy and defection, threatening the taking away of this light from
them: Confound thou O God all the counsel and practices of Satan and his
ministers, which are or shall be taken up against thee, and the kingdom of thy
dear son. And call in the Jews together with the fullness of the gentiles,
that thy name may be glorious in all the world, the days of iniquity may come
to an end, and we with all thine elect people may come to see thy face in
glory, and be filled with the light thereof for evermore.

And now O Lord of mercy, O Father of the spirits of all flesh, look in
mercy upon the Gentiles, who yet know thee not, O gracious God be merciful to
us, and bless us, and not us alone, but let thy ways be known upon earth,
and thy saving health amongst all nations: we praise thee, and we bless thee:
But let the people praiss thee O God, yea let all the people praise thee, and
let these ends of the world remember themselves and turn to thee the God of
their salvation. And seeing thou have honored us to choose us out to hear thy
name unto the Gentiles: we therefore beseech thee to bless us, and this our
plantation, which we and our nation have begun in thy fear, and for thy glory.
We know O Lord, we have the devil and all the gates of hell against us, but if
thou O Lord be on our side, we care not who be against us. O therefore vouchsafe
to be our God, and let us be a part and portion of thy plople, confirm thy
cauena^t of grace and mercy with us, which thou have made to thy Church in
Christ Jesus. And seeing Lord the highest end of our plantation here, is to set
up the standard, and display the banner of Jesus Christ, eue^ here where satan's
throne is Lord, let our labor be blessed in laboring the conversion of the
heathen. And because thou use not to work such mighty works by unholy means,
Lord sanctify our spirits, and give us holy hearts, that so we may be thy
instruments in this most glorious work: lord inspire our souls with thy grace,
kindle in us zeal of thy glory: fill our hearts with thy fear, and our tongues
with thy praise, furnish us all from the highest to the lowest with all gifts
and graces needful not only for our salvation, but for the discharge of our
duties in our several places, adorn us with the garments of Justice, mercy,
love, pity, faithfulness, humility, and all virtues, and teach us to abhor
all vice, that our lights may so shine before these heathen, that they may see
our good works, and so be brought to glorify thee our heavenly Father. And
seeing Lord we profess our selves thy servants, and are about thy work, Lord
bless us, arm us against difficulties, strength us against all base thoughts
and temptations, that may make us look back again. And seeing by thy motion
and work in our hearts, we have left our warm nests at home, and put our lives
into our hands principally to honor thy name, and advance the kingdom of thy
son, Lord give us leave to commit our lives into thy hands: let thy Angels be
about us, and let us be as Angels of God sent to this people. And so bless us
Lord, and so prosper all our proceedings, that the heathen may never say unto
us, where is now your God: Their Idols are not so good as silver and gold, but
lead and copper, and the works of their own hands. But thou Jehovah art our
God, and we are ye works of thy hands: O then let Dagon fall before thy Arc,
let Satan be confounded at thy presence, and let the heathen see it and be
ashamed, that they may seek thy face, for their God is not as our God,
themselves being Judges. Arise therefore O Lord, and let thine enemies be
scattered, and let them that hate thee ^lie before thee: As the smoke
vanishes, so let Satan and his delusions come to naught and as war melts
before the fire, so let wickedness, superstition, ignorance and idolatry perish
at ye presence of thee our God. And whereas we have by undertaking this
plantatio^ undergone the reproofs of the base world, insomuch as many of our
own brethren laugh us to scorn, O Lord we pray thee fortiffe us against this
temptation: let Sanballat, and Tobias, Papists and players, and such other
Amonits and Horonits the scum ^ dregs of the earth, let the^ morke such as
help to build up the walls of Jerusalem, and they that be filthy, let the^ be
filthy still, and let such swine still wallow in their mire, but let not ye rod
of the wicked sal upon the lot of the righteous, let not them put forth their
hands to such vanity, but let them that fear thee, rejoice and be glad in
thee, and let them know, that it is thou O Lord, that raignest in England, and
unto the ends of the world. And seeing this work must needs expose us to many
miseries, and dangers of soul and body, by land and sea. O Lord we earnestly
beseech thee to receive us into thy favor and protection, descr^^ us from the
delusions of the devil, the malice of the heathen, the invasions of our
enemies, and mutinies and dissentions of our own people, knit our hearts
altogether in faith and fear of thee, and love one to another give us
patience, wisdom and constancy to go on through all difficulties and
temptations, til this blessed work be accomplished, for the honor of thy name,
and glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: That when the heathen do know thee to
be their God, and Jesus Christ to be their salvation, they may say, blessed be
the king and Prince of England, and blessed be the English nation, and blessed
for ever be the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth* that sent them
amongst us: And here O Lord we do upon the knees of our hearts offer thee the
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, for that thou have moved our hearts to
undertake the performance of this blessed work, with the hazard of our person
and the hearts of so many hundreds of our nation to assist it with means and
provision, and with their holy prayers, Lord look mercifully upon them all,
and for that portion of their substance which they willingly offer for thy
honor and service in this action, recompense it to them and theirs, and reward
it seven fold into their bosoms with better blessings: Lord bless England our
sweet native country, save it from Popery, this land scour heathenisme, and
both from Atheism. And Lord heat their prayers for us, and us for them, and
Christ Jesus our glorious Mediator for us all.

Amen.
