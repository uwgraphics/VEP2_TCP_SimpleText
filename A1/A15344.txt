TO THE HONORABLE, AND HIS VERY GOOD LL. SIR JOHN POPHAM Knight, Lord chief
Justice of England, and Sir William Periam Knight, Lord chief Baron of her
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, T.W. heartily wishes the abundant riches of al
Gods mercies in this life, and eternal blessedness in that which is to come
through Christ.
THough I doubt not (my good Lords) but that you have ere this heard of the
fearful and lamentable fire, that in September last light upon the town of
VVooburne, in the county of Bedford, and am fully persuaded, that according
to the measure of heavenly wisdom, that God has vouchsaued to you both, you
have made spiritual profit, not only thereof, but of sundry other such like
judgments past already, in diverse quarters of our kingdom, and justly feared,
that hereafter may fall out upon us for our sins: yet because the
particularities of that punishment are not so well and certainly known as were
meet, men's minds are so various, and fame increases by going, as we say in
the Proverb, besides that even in these things, likewise there is a truth fit
to be understood, and also because the generality of men, either see them not,
because they are blind, or else be amazed at the^ for a while, because they
have no further insight, or else make not good use of them, because they are of
careless hearts, I have thought it sit, and that under your Lordshippes
protections, and with your good acceptance also I trust, to publishe though a
short, yet a true narration of that pitiful spectacle, and therewithal, some
meditations of mine own concerning that matter begun within a day or two
after the aforenamed fire it self, and finished in how short a space I will
not write, least I might seem to vaunt. In regard of the matter, I have aimed
at nothing but this, that the truth it self being laid open, and some
observations made thereupon, men might be lead by the hand to make some
profitable use of it, they being drawn on to repentance for that which is
past, and carefully to look to themselves for that which is to come, least
otherwise the flame of Gods wrath should break forth further against us, and
that to our utter wasting and destruction. For the manner observed in this
discourse, it is not so methodicall I confess, as it should be: but the reason
thereof was the sudden fear and great grief, that I conceived upon the very
view and sight of the ruins it had made, all making me unfit indeed for that
present, especially for matter or manner to handle such a subject, as it
ought, both the one and the other then took such a deep impression in me, and
that is the reason also and nothing else I assure you, why I seem as it were
so confusedly to deal in the cause, for how can a distempered mind be sit,
especially in method to propound any matter, since that to the orderly
delivery of things, there must of necessity concur a quiet heart, and a
stayed head? Howbeit this I dare notwithstanding protest, that for the body of
the treaty, there is in it nothing unsound or uncertain, and therefore in
that respect may the more safely be received. As for the reasons leading me to
present this little labor to your Lordships, though they be many and the same
weighty also, yet take them I beseech you, in a word as it were. You have
vouchsaued me sundry honorable favors, and I would not willingly seem or be
thought, either unmindful of them, or unthankful for them in any duty that
God has or shall be pleased to enable me to perform. You execute the justice of
the land, nay which is more, the very justice of God himself, even derived
from himself, by her Majesty's holy hand and power. How fit therefore it is,
that his example should be set before you, whose person you do in some sort
bear, and whose judgment also you execute in your functions, that so you
might in your places tread also in some good measure in his paths, your selves
can more wisely judge, than I am able to relate. You both profess the holy
gospel of Christ, and may in some sort and sense be reckoned amongst them,
that mourn for your own sins, and for the transgressions of the land also.
How meet it is, that you and others with you should see, that you have not taken
up this lamentation without cause, as welfor that which is past and present, as
for that which is feared to come. But I will repress my self in these
things, and will not cease according to all the graces that I have received
from God, to comme^d these causes into his most merciful hands, who only
works wonderful things both in heaven and in earth, that so turning us from
our evil ways unto himself, and knitting our hearts daily more and more unto
him, we may have assured hope of the bettering of our estate in this life
according to his own good pleasure, or at the least of the everlasting saving
of our souls, notwithstanding all the troubles and turmoiles that may fall out
in the world. The Lord always and in all things also direct your Lorships both
by his holy spirit, and until the day of Christ make perfect in you all
good works that he has begun for the prosperity of Sion, or the commodity
of the common wealth, to his glory, and your everlasting comfort through
Christ. London the 1. of November. 1595.

Your Lordships bounden and ready ever in Jesus Christ, Tho. Wilcocks, the
Lords unworthy.

A short narration of the fearful fire, that fell in the town of VVooburne,
in the County of Bedford, on Saturdaie, the 13. of September last. 1595. Lord
Jesus begin and make an end.
MEN, brethren and fathers, yea and whosoever amongst you truly fears God,
unfeignedly loves his law, stedfastlye believes his promises, and sincerely
obeieth his will to you, and to every one of you, I say, are the words of
truth, and exhortation following directed: not of a hateful heart I assure
you against any, for I wish and would labor your good generally, and
especially the salvation of your souls, as mine own: nor yet of a mind
curious in other men's causes, with the neglect of them that belong to my self,
for I know it to be displeasing before God, and unprofitable to my self, but
of an earnest desire in christian charity, by all means lawful, and that
according to my uttermost ability, to assay to do good unto others, as unto
mine own soul, and to labor what I can, the setting forth of his glory, that
has created us and placed us in this world, for that special end and
purpose, that so at the last also, after we have a little glorified him here,
we might thorough his mercy, and Christ's merits, obtain the fruition of
everlasting life, and the immortal glorification of our bodies and souls, in
that great and last day. Wherein, if either through the uncleanness of my heart,
or the pollution of my hands, or through any other weakness or want in me, or
of me, I shall miss of my purpose: or else through the carelessness, contempt,
or any other corruption besides, of those into whose hands this treatise shall
come, these poor labors shall not sort these desired effects, I shall for mine
own and their transgressions (which are lettes and hindrances to so worthy a
work) mourn in my soul in secret, to see or hear the hand of God come forth
so heavily against us for our sins, and yet I shall again comfort my self,
as well as I can, not only in this of heathen men, that in great and hard
matters to have a will is sufficient, but especially in that heavenly speech of
the holy apostle, that God (if there be first a willing and cheerful mind)
accepts us according to that we have, and not according to that we have not:
this being always provided also, that that good, whether it be of affection,
or of action, that we have, we have from him, who works in us both the will
and the deed, according to his own good pleasure, and therefore will accept it
in us, as his own good work, notwithstanding our imperfections and defects
cleaving thereto.

What a fearful fire fell in the town of Wooburne, in the County of
Bedford, on Saturday, as they call it, the thirteenth of September last past,
sundry of the people there felt, to their extreme losses, yea utter undoing,
diverse did behold to their great grief, and many have heard of, even to the
sorrow of their hearts. This was so much the more lamentable, not only because
it burnt up sundry houses, and baies of building, to the number as I take it,
of some hundred and thirty, one with another such as they were, of dwelling
howses, and out houses, as barnes, stables, houels, and such like, but also
because it consumed whatsoever store was laid up in the same, as corn, hey,
wood, fern, and such other like provision, for man and for beast, for the
back and the belly, to bake and to brew with, and for such other both
necessary use, and profitable maintenance: yea (which may add to and increase
the pitifulnes of the spectacle, and the very matter of the narration it self)
not only many things within the house, being almost utterly spoiled, broken to
pieces and consumed, as tables, stools, bedsteds, wainscot, presses, glass in
the windows, pewter, brass, copper, leather, and such like, but even of that
which was carried into the streets to save it, if it might be, from the force
of the fire, as linen, bedding, platters, dishes, kettles, much stolen away,
and sundry sorts of ware, of the traders of the town, as frise, durance,
sheewes, and such like, purloyned and imbeseled. By means whereof it comes
to pass, that the most of them are greatly weakened, as in respect of that
poor estate worldly, which before they enjoyed, yea that diverse of them having
their store and provision consumed, and as it were eaten up with the flame of
the fire, hardly have for themselves, their wives, children, and servants,
bread to slake hunger, drink to cool thirst, wood to warm them with all, or
houses to hide their heads in, I will not say convenient (for that were a great
mercy in this judgment) but not such as over head, are able to keep out the
rain, snow, and other moisture that falls from heaven, or on the sides to
beat back the boisterous winds, and cold air, this indeed being rather
wrought, by the indiscretion or rage of some, that came in to succor and help
their distress, by bursting in pieces the tiles of the house, and breaking
down walls, windows, glass, and all (and yet no doubt of it, meant to do
their best endeavors, for aid and relief) than by the violence or vehemency
of the fire.

Many I doubt not, are greatly egar, and greedy as it were, to hear of, and
to understand the mean whereby this miserable fire, and fearful flame was
inkindled: which desire of theirs, as I cannot mislike, if it be free from new
fanglednes and curiosity, and have this adjoined there withal, that they
labor what they can, to make a good and profitable use of the same: so will I
to my uttermost ability, though not in all and every particular, yet in truth
and plainenes, assay to satisfy, and certify them thereof. A simple old
woman, as simple and seely, as ever I knew almost, slow in speech, deaf in
hearing, and which is worst of all, very dull of understanding and sense (named
for her age, old Ioane) dwelling in a poor cottage, at the further end of
the town, toward Brickhill, having shifted her bed straw, and put new
thereinto, laid the old in the chimney of her said house, supposing in
deed, as she affirms, that there had bin no fire in the same. Afterward
going abroad, about some businesses that she had to do, though verily they
were but mean and small (as such poor folks have no great affairs) the
cinders and sparks that were in the same chimney, took hold of that straw, so
carelessly cast thereinto, and inflamed, and by means thereof set on fire that
thatched house, and in very short time took hold of others adjoining unto it,
that were thatched also, and so proceeded in fearful both measure and manner,
from one to another, till it had made that lamentable desolation, that is yet
to be seen. And as this was the beginning of this woeful work, so was it
without al doubt very much furthered, by the absence of sundry the inhabitants
of that town, who being at that time far from home, and abroad in the fields
about their worldly affairs, could neither so prouidently prevent the rage of
that fire, nor so powerfullie put it out, as by all probability they might
have done, had they been at the very beginning thereof. Besides this is most
certain, that the Lord raised up even almost at that very instant, a great and
mighty wind, to carry it as it were from one house or place to another (the
fire also it self, naturally gathering wind unto it) (as to me was told)
was even made thereby the more forcible and furious, whilst all things, that
either they had for defense, or had gotten in for provision, were so far off
from lessening the fury of the fire, that they did rather increase the same.
For besides, that the thatch of their barnes and out houses, was greatly dried
with much and long parching heat and drouth going before, and so they were the
more meet matter, for the flame to set upon, besides this I say, their corn,
their hay, their wood, their fern, and other provision laid thereinto, and
being very drily inned, as they use to say, was fit food for the fire to
feed upon, not only for the increase of the extreme heat, and violent rage
of the fire it self, but even to the turning and burning of the matter it
self into dust and powder. And not only the sudden, but the great puffes and
blastes of the said wind also, did carry sparks and flames from one house
to another, yea (which is more strange) from the one side of the town to the
other: this being by the faithful testimony of sundry credible persons, not
only ear, but eye witnesses also, truly reported, that there was by the
violence and vehemence of the same wind taken up, from one of the houses so
consumed, and standing not far from the Church, a flake of thatch inflamed,
as broad as it were a sheet, and carried quite and clean over the Chauncell of
the Church, the schoolehouse, and some other housing of the west side of the
town, and fell upon some of the housing of the east side of the said town,
where also it burned some fifteen or sixteen baye of building as I take it.
To all this we may add, as means to increase this inkindled flame, the
carefulnes of the people, come together out of the fields, and their
carelesnes also. If any man think it strange, that such contraries should
either be in one and the self same subject, or further one and the self same
action, let him weigh, that the care that they had, to carry some of their
goods out of their dwelling houses, into the streets and other places, least
the fire also should have taken hold thereof, made them careless to stop the
passage of the fire, which driven as I say, by the force of the wind, did not
only pass speedily from one place to another, but made as it were a glade from
the end of the town, on the backside of it especially, even to the Church or
temple yet standing there (thanks be to God) not much decayed or defaced, to
the end the people might more diligently resort and repair thereto, and more
fruitfully profit by the heavenly exercises there performed, than there have
done, or else God will proceed further, yea more fiercely against it, the town
and all. And which is not of least consequence concerning this cause: Though
the people of the country came in very lovingly and readily, (many of them
leaving their own labors, and freeing their hired workmen from their task,
and paying them notwithstanding their days wages) to help to extinguish and
quench the fire, and indeed though diverse of them wrought and toiled very sore
and hard there about: yet some through want of experience, in such particular
actions and causes, and other some for lack of good guidance and direction, (a
special remedy doubtless in such extreme and dangerous causes) took not the
readiest and easiest way to stop or hinder the passage of this fearful flame,
but being as commonly people are, in other cases of greater quiet, and
therefore no marvel in this hurly burly, of many minds, what through
ignorance and strangenes of the sight, and want of experience in such unusual
actions, confounded in themselves, cried some one thing and some another, and
indeed did some one thing and some another, all supposing they said and did
for the best, but indeed, though not of purpose (for I dare not so much as
think that any carried such bad minds) increased rather the desolation and
wast, than any manner of way lessened the same.

In all this lamentable discourse or narration, there are surely many points
worthy the observation and marking: all and every one whereof directly tend
to the manifestation of most excellent things in God himself, for example, his
great power, his gracious providence, his perfect justice, his heavenly
wisdom, and mercy more than fatherly, yea more than can be spoken or thought
of: and to the declaration of many foul and fearful corruptions, that lie
lurking in us, and altogether serve for our Christian admonition and
instruction, as well for that which is past and present, as also for all time
hereafter to come, specially if we have eyes to see the ways of God in his
works, or hearts to tremble at his judgments, or minds that can be affected
with his favors, or any grace and ability to make good use either of the one,
or of the other. For tell me I pray you first, was not this a plain proof of
his power, upon so small beginnings to make so great a flame, and wasting fire?
to execute his judgment by so weak instruments and means? to raise up the
creatures for the further dispersing of the judgment? to accomplish his own
purpose and counsel, in so short a season, and small a time? to strike such
fear and amazednes into the minds, not only of weak women and little
children, but of men (who seem to have more courage and wisdom) that their
heads should not be able to devise what were most profitable, nor their hands
fit to execute any thing to speak of in comparison? If any and every one of
these be evident declarations of his might and majesty, what then are al these
together, but strong instruments more effectually to persuade our hearts in his
all-working and almighty power? And does not this show his wonderful
providence, that he did not only bear the persons of all and every one of
them, as it were upon the wings of his gracious goodness, so as we may by a
manner of speech say, and confess it to the glory of his name, and the
strengthening of our persuasion in trouble against time to come, that not one
of them did so much as dash his foot against a stone, but spared much of that,
that the fire had, as we may say, laid hands on, and the flame no doubt,
would have consumed that, that it had fearfully taken hold of, had not he
restrained it, and kept it as it were in his fist? Does not this argue
hisiustice, in striking for sin? he that knows Gods nature will easily give
glory to God in it, and confess the truth. For we know by the truth of the
word, and our experience and observation in the world, that he delights not
in punishing the sons of men, and if their transgressions were not as it were
gable ropes to hale down judgments, surely men should never taste of this,
howsoever it might be always in the divine nature. Nay I will say more. May
we not as well in the manner of the judgment, as in the judgment it self,
yea in the very things stricken with his wrath, behold the haude of God
punishing the sins of men, in those members and matters, they had most abused
to licenciousnesse and evil. Yea to speak more plainly of this particular,
was it not a token of wrath from above, by fire to consume their bread, meat,
and strong drink, that they had prepared against the fair, thereby to put
them in mind how they have offended, yea do offend (notwithstanding this
chastisement and correction) in abusing these blessings to gourmandise, and
drunkenness? And does not this manifest his wisdom, that in that outward
judgment he has scourged, as sundry profane and careless men, so some also
that in some measure, do unfeignedly fear his name, heartily love his truth,
and carefully walk in obedience of his will? And why has he done it? Surely
that in both sorts, they themselves and al men might see, that if God, as in
respect of outward punishment, spare not his own people (who are as dear to
him as the apple of his eye) he will much less in this, or that which is to
come, wink at the sins of the wicked, (for if judgment begin at the house
of God, as Saint Peter says, what shall be the end of them that obey not the
gospel of God?) and that his servants might understand, that therefore they
are chastened of the Lord in this life, to the end that the dross of their
corruption being scoured from them, they should not perish with this wicked
world. And as for his mercy, what can we cast our eye upon (I will not say,
if we look upon it with sanctified and enlightened minds from above, but even
in the light of reason or nature) and that in this very desolation it self? or
think upon with our minds, in which we may not see the glory of it break
forth as the sun in his greatest brightness? For if the Prophet Jeremiah for
himself and his people, did frankly confess it, as he does indeed, Lament. 3.
that it was the Lords mercy that they were not consumed: And the faithful in
Isaiah, willingly acknowledge, that unless the Lord of hosts had reserved some,
though but few, they had been as Sodom, and made like unto Gomorrah? Have not
we as good cause, with unfeigned minds and mouths, also to speak and declare
the same? More than the one half of the town, by much, was neither touched by
fire (howsoever it was threatened therewith) nor received any great loss: and
yet I hope they think not themselves more righteous than the rest, sure I am
they should not imagine any such thing, for eue^ amongst them that felt not the
flame, I am sure there were as great transgressors, as they that tasted of it.
And as for them upon whom the loss did light, and indeed lies very heavily,
a great part of their dwelling houses, I confess was sore set upon and
assaulted, yea very much scorched with fire, but yet not destroyed: much also
of their goods or household stuff graciously spared, though greatly defaced
and impaired. And which is a very rare and strange thing, specially in so
exemplary a judgment, none of them or theirs, in their bodies or persons, hurt
with this fearful flame. Nay which is more: of all that confused multitude that
was there for needful help and succor, some running one way and some another,
some crying one thing, and some another, some doing this, and some that, and
all as if it were a beast of many heads for the time, by reason they were
without good guides or government, not one of them all I say, for ought I
heard, maimed or hurt. Surely, if a better eye had not watched over them than
humane, and a more not only mighty, but gracious hand vphelde them, than
their own, a thousand to one as we say in our proverb, but that in climing
of houses, beating down of tiles, occupying of axes, casting of water, (all
which and many the like are used in such fearful extremities) every one
besides running thick and threefold in another neck, but that diverse had
been wounded, if not slain. And yet to the end we might behold, even as it
were with our bodily eyes, as well as with the eyes of our mind, Gods great
and gracious goodness, not one of so many did miscarrie, or was as we may say,
scarce touched at all, with any dangers either deadly or grievous. What shall
we say then? without all controversy, he that cannot learn by that which is
past, to fear and tremble before God in so fearful a judgment, must needs
be deemed to have at the least, a careless heart, if not benumbed and
senseless. For shall the Lion roar, and not all the beasts of the forest
fear? And he that cannot be thankful for the gracious reservation, that God
of his mere mercy has made both of men, buildings, goods, etc. and that as
well for other men's as for his own, may justly be said to be of an
unthankful mind and mouth to Godwarde, and of an uncharitable heart toward
his brethren. And whosoever cannot use it to further him in faith unfeigned, and
sincere repentance, as in regard of the former part of his life misspent, and
for carfulness and circumspection for that which is to come, let him doubt at
the least if not despair of his present and subsequent condition. For if God
shall give us so lively documentes as these are, and we not receive
instruction thereby, or be in some good measure bettered thereby, both for
knowledge, belief, and obedience, he shall have just occasion to take up that
grievous complaint against us, which he has done to men of like quality and
disposition, and to say, Hearken O heavens, and thou O earth, hear, for the
Lord speaks: I have brought up children, yea I have exalted them, but falling
away they have rebelled against me. The ox knows his owner, and the ass his
Masters cribbe, but Israel knows not, my people consider not. Ah sinful
nation, ah people laden with iniquity, a very wicked seed, corrupted
children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have contemptuously provoked the
holy one of Israel: wherefore should ye be smitten any more, since you increase
your falling away: the whole head is dangerously sick, and the whole heart
languisheth, from the sole of the foot to the top of the head, there is no
soundnes, but wounds and swellings, and a sore that runs continually, etc.
which miserable mischiefs, and grievous inconveniences, that we may through
Gods goodness speedily avoid, as also by the same assuredly attain the
contrary good things: it shall be good for us to mark, first the hand that
strikes us, lest otherwise not knowing that, we run whither we should not,
and forsake that we ought to cleave unto. Secondly, the causes moving such
exemplary judgment, because the ignorance thereof may make us to lay it where
we should not, and to clear them that we ought to charge. And lastly, the
ends that are aimed at in these chastisements, because as we are not afflicted
without cause, so we are not chastised but to some good and holy purpose.

He that thus corrects men, is even the eternal God himself, as we may
well see, not only by this general sentence of the Prophet Amos, saying, Is
there any evil in the city that the Lord has not done? chap. 3. meaning by
the term evil, the evil of punishment and affliction, and not the evil of
sin and transgression, because God cannot that way (he is so absolutely
good) be an actor at al: but also by the particular confession, that Job the
holy man of God makes, when he says, even of the greatest judgments almost,
that can fall out upon men in this life: The Lord has given, the Lord has
taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord. And as Gods word does almost every
where in plain and audible terms affirm the same, saying, The Lord does
whatsoever pleases him, both in heaven, and in earth, and in all deep places:
so reason grounded upon religion confirms it likewise. For if this be not so,
why do we say we believe with our hearts, and confess with our mouths that
God is almighty? Is it not because we are certainly persuaded both by the
will of GOD revealed in his word, and by his works manifested in the world,
that no such things as these, are or can be performed, but by not only his
permission and providence (which indeed reach not unto the actions of God,
otherwise than as he suffers and foreseeth the same, but to his
determination, council, foresight, or appointment) but by his all-sufficient
might and power also, at all times, in all places, and in all things, ruling,
yea ouerruling the same, according to the good pleasure of his own will: which
if it were not true, we should in our profession of it, have been found
falsifiers of truth, and in our persuasions of it, deceivers of our own
hearts. Neither does this hinder it (howsoever in humane reason it may seem
so) that in the execution of his councels, he uses means. For as we are sure,
that with means, and without means, yea and against means too, he can
perform whatsoever he will, either as in regard of the grievous punishment of
the wicked, or as in respect of the merciful deliverance of his own people
(which we may plainly and particularly see, in the passage of the Israelites
through the red sea, that not only giving the^ way, but being as a wall for them
on the right hand, and on the left, and serving of or the drowning of the
Egyptians therein) so he both appoynteth and uses the means, not for any
impotencie, or weakness in himself, for he is the God of all might and power,
communicating it in great measure to many, and yet having never a whit the
less in himself, and brideling that that he has given them, making their
rage also to turn to his praise, but that he might the more effectually
humble, who being gross of nature, are hardly brought under, or made to
stoop, but by such apparent and forcible means. And this may appear, not
only then when he uses gross and outward means (and yet the same powerful
also) because they better sort with our nature, and more lively affect all our
senses, but even then when he makes the weakest, and the meanest able to
effect most great and excellent matters. And therefore unless we be in sin
hardened as flints, these and such like things, cannot choose, but pinch and
pearce us very far. To apply all this to our particular, as purpose, so past,
yea and if you will present visitation also: which howsoever, as in regard of
time it be past already, yet are the monuments, and the very cinders thereof so
present before us, that all our senses, sight, hearing, feeling, smelling,
tasting, may still, yea and I fear me will a long while be satisfied
therewith. Wherein though the Lord used the carelesnes and negligence of a
silly poor wretched woman, for the beginning of this punishment, as you have
heard already; and though for the continuance, increase and carrying of it,
yea scattering of it abroad, he raised up a mighty wind, and other instruments
and means above expressed, to serve his own turn with, for the declaration of
his majesty, and the chastisements of the sins of the people: yet still if
we have any grace, we must steadfastly look upon him, and unfeignedly
confess, that he as it were alone, has wrought this great work. And the
knowledge and practice of this point does holy Job teach us, and that not
only in matters of the like nature and event, but in such plain terms also,
as will admit or receive no other construction. For howsoever he was not
ignorant of, yea by the credible report of his escaped servants, he knew well
enough, and was persuaded, that the Caldeans, Sabeans, Satan and al, had as it
were conspired and consented, but yet every one, in and about the things
wherein they were employed, as for example, in driving away his cattle, as it
had been a pray or spoil obtained in just war, in the overthrowing of that
house wherein his children were banqueting, and in the rest of the miseries
and afflictions that God was pleased to exercise him withal, yet does he from
the heart, frankly and freely confess and say, The Lord has given, the Lord
has taken away: And to his discomfortable and wicked wife affirm, Shall we
receive good at the hand of God, and not receive evil also? And indeed if we
be not thoroughly persuaded of this in our hearts, as by the clear light of the
word, so by the gracious working of Gods blessed spirit in our several
souls, we shall with the blind and superstitious of the world, irreligiously
ascribe as they do, the matters and occurences that fall out in this life, to
fortune and secondary causes, which is nothing else in truth, but to spoil
and rob the divine majesty of his power, providence, wisdom, justice, and
whatsoever therein is most excellent. And if we do not with a sound mind and
mouth, give glory to God therein, and confess it to the praise of his name,
surely it is impossible, either to minister sound consolation to others that
are distressed, a duty that in charity we are bound to perform toward men,
or with patience and comfort to undergo our own calamities and miseries, a
cause that we ought greatly to care for, or quietly and confidently to expect a
joyful issue of them and way to escape therefrom, a matter that we must
patiently hope for, or else all will be naught on our sides. For how is it
likely that a man should quietly endure the crosses and losses that fall upon
him, who knows not that they are inflicted, not only by a superior, but by
an absolute ouerruling power, and the same not usurped, but most holy,
lawful, and just? or how can he so much as think of a comfortable
deliverance, that is not well and thoroughly persuaded of the almighty power and
providence of God, who if he work it not for him, it can never be effected?
And if he cannot as a skillful Physician, heal the maladies and sicknesses of
his own soul, and minister consolation to his own conscience, how shall we
imagine him able to do it to others? For as for men's mischieuons minds (if our
crosses and calamities come altogether from them) they cannot be satisfied,
till we be ruinated and overthrown: and Satan's malice specially against Gods
people, has neither end nor measure, if it be not restrained. This persuasion
therefore, that we are under Gods almighty hand and power, in whatsoever state
or condition we be, being well settled in our hearts, will undoubtedly cause us,
that in the time of our prosperity, we shall not be puffed up in pride above
measure, and in the days of our adversity, not to be too much depressed, but
even for the time present patiently to bear, and for the time to come, with
comfort to expect and wait for such a delivery and issue out of all troubles,
as the Lord shall see to be fit for the glory of his name, the benefit of his
people, and our own everlasting good. Whereas without this, we shall either with
some of the wicked languish away in distrustfulnesse; murmuring, and all manner
of impatiencie, or with other some fall to ungodly devises and shifts,
imagining either to have our necessities satisfied by co^sonage, fraud, force,
theft, or some such like wicked way, or else that our griefs may and shall be
recovered by repayring to witches, sorcerers, coniurers, and sundry other such
wicked persons, the practice whereof we may behold to too many in our time
overtaken withal, and running riot to that great and grievous excess of
evil. Wherefore we may well see and say, that it much stands us in hand
indeed, yea and greatly imports all and every one of us, to be rightly and
religiously persuaded, as of other grounds and principles of Christian
religion, so of this one point particularly, and that not only for the
avoiding of iniquity and sin, in loving and liking, in seeking and striving
to them, who^ for their gross and grievous transgressions, we ought to loath
and abhor, but even for the faithful accomplishment of many good duties in
piety toward God, in charity toward men, and in comfort and patience, as
in respect of ourselves. For otherwise, how shall we steadfastly trust in, or
religiously call upon him, whom we believe not to be almighty? or how can
we comfort our selves or other men, if there be any power that is either
equal with, or can ouerrule the same?

Now we are to see what causes should move the Lord, in such fearful
measure and manner, as many times he does, to exercise and execute his
judgments. Of a truth it proceeds not of himself, and his own nature, as
though he took pleasure in punishing the sons of men. For the scripture
tells us in many places, that he is as it were of another disposition,
namely, slow to wrath, and of great goodness, and inclinable to much mercy,
(for which purpose see Exodus 34. and Psalm. 86.) neither indeed delights he
to afflict his own creatures, specially man the excellentest and chiefest of
the rest. Some thing then from elsewhere, must of necessity draw him and drive
him to do it, or else it could never be performed From our selves therefore
surely, and our most grievous transgressions, is the first, yea and as a man
may say, indeed is the only cause of all our misery, of what kind, sort,
or condition soever it be, either outward in the body, or inward in the
mind, temporal in this life, or everlasting in that which is to come. Which
because men are not easily persuaded of, nor willingly yield to (pride and
conceitednes concerning some good things in themselves, takes so strong hold
of them, and possesses them so mightily) God in sundry places of the holy
scripture, does not only plainly describe the corruption of man's nature,
saying, The thoughts and imaginations of man's heart are only evil, every day
from his youth upward: and again, There is none that does good, no not one,
they are al become corrupt and abominal le, etc. But also by his Prophet
peremptorily tells us, that our sins are they that make a separation betwixt
the Lord and us: and again in another place, Thy destruction O Israel is of
thy self. For the further clearing and confirmation of which point, we are to
mark that God at the first made man, just, holy, innocent, righteous, etc. but
he not continuing in that excellent estate, corrupted himself and all his
posterity, who as they were by creation in his loins, so were they all
standing with him in innocence, had he stood, and falling together with him
through transgression. So that now it is no more natural for man, as man, that
is to say, vitiated and corrupted as he is, to breath or speak, than it is
for all and every one of them, every way and every day to sin. On the other
side, God is a God, with whom there can dwell no manner of wickedness, yea whose
eyes can at no hand behold that which is evil, whether it be in devise, or
desire, in thought, in word, or in deed. As soon therefore as man has sinned
any manner of way, so soon has he plunged himself, as in regard of Gods
absolute and exact justice, into most grievous and fearful judgments. And
though God strike not presently therefore (as we see many times, according to
his nature inclinable to mercy, yea mercy it self, he does with much
patience and lenity forbear) we must not think as the wicked do, that
either he does it not, because he cannot, (for what is it that he cannot
accomplish?) or because he cares not for the sins of our souls, for we know
that he hates sins, and sinners to, but rather to express the wonderful
ouerflowing mercy that is in him, waiting for men's conversion if it may be,
yea assaying to work it by all good means possible, or else that forbearing
them, and they not amending, he way the more sharply and severely in his
justice punish the^ for abusing of his goodness, and turning his grace into
wantonness, as the Apostle says. Which thing the world either not soundly
knowing, or else not sincerely confessing the same to be true, falls into
fearful, dangerous, yea deadly extremities: sometimes accusing God of
injustice, as as that either he strikes them without cause, or more than by
reason of the offense committed, they have deserved: sometimes they post the
cause of their punishment, from them selves to others, supposing that other
men's sins rather than their own, have thus provoked the Lord: and sometimes
again, they ascribe or attribute all to secondary causes, as to such a
conjunction and influence, of such and such planets, to the negligence or
reachlesnes of such and such persons, to the strength and power of such and
such winds and waters, etc. And sometimes they do profanely charge and
accuse their miserable mishap or fortune, as they call it, making her with the
heathen a God, or goddess: and sometimes they fling out into one corruption,
and sometimes to another. By means whereof, they as much as in them lies, rob
God of his government, as though there were any thing that without him or
against him did bear sway in the world, and spoil him of his justice, as
though that he, which indeed is the only just judge of the world, could do
injustice or wrong, and forget his long forbearing hand: and so besides that
they deprive him of his honor in thankfulness, profit not thereby to amendment,
and make other things, namely creatures, God, and a creator as it were, yea
sometimes such things as never were in the nature of things, but in man's
imagination and conceit only, and hinder themselves, and it may be others
likewise, by their bad example also, from the sight and sense of sin, yea
from religious repentance, and godly sorrow for the same, whereby they might be
led unto amendment of life, not to be repented of, and plunge themselves into
innumerable pains of body and soul here, and without special favor and
grace of forgiveness from God (who only forgiueth sins) into everlasting
torme^rs in the world to come. Whereas Gods children are so far off from
entering into these corrupted courses, that many times before judgments, I
will not say have seized upon them, but even before they have been threatened
against them, have yet in the reverend fear which they have had in their hearts
of them, either humbled themselves, and as we may say, prevented the pouring
forth of Gods wrath upon them: or else at the thundering out of the same, or
the first stroke thereof laid upon them, have soundly and speedily cast down
themselves at the feet of Gods mercy, in faith unfeigned, and sincere
repentance, and so if not removed the temporary or outward punishment (and yet
upon their submission, God has been pleased many times, graciously to grant
the same) have notwithstanding found favor from the Lord to undergo it for the
present with patience and prayer, and sincerely to profit by it (yea indeed to
overcome it) to Christian mortification and holy obedience.

As for the ends, why God should strike us, we must know and believe, that it
is impossible that they should be (whether we respect them in themselves, or
as they proceed from him that is only good) of any other nature than he is.
For as all his affections and actions are merely and absolutely good, so must
also all his purposes, and the ends that he aims at be likewise, though
always happily by reason of Satan's malice and man's corruption, they bring not
forth this effect in man. To make this plain by some particulars. His love is
absolutely good, and no man that knows what either GOD or nature means,
can deny it: for if the love of earthly creatures, as of parents to children,
husbands to wives, friends to friends, etc. be good and lawful, then that
which is in and from the divine majesty must much more be so, because it is
more certain, more holy, and indeed infinite, he having it also in himself,
and of himself absolutely and perfectly good, whereas others have it but by
communication, and that in measure, and in men much vitiated and corrupted
through the taint of original sin. And yet this so excellently and absolutely
good, he labors to manifest, as in the correction of all men generally, so
particularly of his own people and children, according to which the spirit
says, in the Apostle to the Hebrews. My son despise not the chastening of
the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord
loves he chastises, and he scourges every son that he receives: And if
we be without correction whereof all are partakers, than are we bastards, and
not sons and dauhgters. Wherefore since in this and such like actions, he
aims at the manifestation of his love, and that is indeed the principal end
of his chastisements, specially as in regard of his own people, it cannot be
but good. True it is that flesh and blood sees not this, nor thinks so. The
reason is, because their eyes are blind, and their understandings dark. But as
it is not reason, because a blind man beholds not the Sun, to conclude,
there is no Sun: so is it absurd to say, because the wicked worldlings,
neither feel nor fear these things, therefore they are not. For these are as
all the rest of the things of God, specially as in respect of his purpose and
end, spiritual, and therefore must be spiritually discerned: but they are
carnal, and sold under sin. Again, in as much as since the deprauation and
corrupting of Gods image, we are nothing else but both in body and soul
tainted with all manner of evil: and since that even since our regeneration and
new birth, we carry about with us (so long as we dwell in these houses of
clay, and earthly tabernacles) the relikes and remainders of sin: and we know
by the light of the word, every where almost revealing it, and by the stinging
testimony of our own heart (which even tells it us every day that we rise
up, and every night that we lie down) that sin displeases his blessed
majesty, and God has appointed punishments and corrections, both outward and
inward, as one special mean to repress the rage and power of evil in us,
whilst it scoureth from us the dross of our corruption, and so mortifying in
some measure sin in us, fashioneth us the better and more effectually unto
sanctification (for this we may assure our selves of, that the decay of the
one, is the increase of the other) we may even thereby see, as if it were in a
most clear and lively looking glass, that he aims at in these corrections,
which he has sealed, not only his own glory, but our good, both temporal
and eternal, in this work of fatherly chastisement and affliction. And this
sure cannot choose but be good also, howsoever sometimes by reason of the thick
cloud of our own corruption, interposed between Gods works and our reformed
judgment, we cannot so sensibly see, or so plainly perceive the same, as we
would or should. Neither is this al, the bettering of us in this life, but for
as much as our good estate here, is in the purpose and council of God, yet
through his own mercy and grace only, infinitely as I may say, to be
bettered in the life that is to come, and afflictions do not only frame us to
obedience in this world, but in some sort pledge up unto us the salvation of
our souls in eternal blessedness, according to which the Apostle affirms: We
are chastened of the Lord in this world, that we should not perish with the
wicked in that which is to come. And again the spirit in another place says:
By many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. Men by all this
should be persuaded, of the holy purposes and blessed ends of Gods visitation,
and earnestly labor by these (since God also himself is pleased by them, to
aim at that end, and to effect that grace in us) to be out of love and liking
with this present evil world, and all the vanities and delights of the same,
using it and them no further, than as by it and them we may be furthered in
more excellent graces, and to hunger and thirst after that eternal felicity,
that is laid up in the heavens for all those, that in faith, patience, prayer,
and other good works, look for and long after his blessed appearing.

Thus we see what God minds to effect by striking us: but whether these
fruits follow in me^, let our own practice declare. We are so far off from
taking these things as pledges of his love, that the more he lays upon us
that way, the more we think he hates us. And the reason is, because we
measure these matters, not by the line or elne of reason reformed, or religious
reason, but by our understanding much corrupted and defaced, from that
integrity which it had in creation. And then how can we in that darkness see
light, seeing that hinders us from beholding graces more clear than these,
that are to be seen in afflictions and corrections? And if we cannot see in
them his love, till the thick scales of our ignorance be pulled from the eyes
of our minds, and understanding, how shall we perceive that he assayeth our
good therem, til the same also be removed and taken away? For as we are hardly
persuaded of this, that strokes testify the favor of him that soundly and
roundly lays them upon us: so shall flesh and blood never yield to this,
that blows better us, till the heart specially enlightened believe the same,
and we know either by experience in our selves, or by observation in others,
that they have not by nature, but by grace, gained that glorious issue. The
like may we say of pledging up unto us the hope of heaven. For what man, if
he have not more in him than man, will imagine that so hard a measure of
afflictions and sorrows, as lie not only upon the backs, but are in the
souls of men, yea godly men, should testify unto them such heavenly graces?
we rather say and see, that the father that beats the child much and often,
hardly minds to give him the inheritance, and to make him Lord and heir of
all. Howbeit Gods word tells us, that it is far otherwise with Gods elect:
for if we suffer with Christ, we shall reign with him, and being made
conformable unto him in his afflictions, we shall also be like him in glory,
we knowing that the momentany and light afflictions of this life, do cause
unto us, or bring with them a far most excellent and eternal weight of
glory. Now whether in these points it be better for us, to believe God and his
holy word, or to trust our own reason, and humane judgment, I had almost
said, let all the world judge, but let the godly especially speak their
minds, and deliver their sentence according to truth and right.

Whatsoever hitherto has been delivered, concerns especially, either the
narration it self, and the thing done as we say, or else some profitable
points arising therefrom, or appertaining thereto. All which no doubt of it,
are profitable, if they be laid to heart, to build us up in knowledge and
judgment. But there is another thing besides, that as in all causes generally,
so particularly in this, we must carefully labor to attain to: and that is
conscience of the things that we know, and care to profit by them, to the
bettering of us in this life before God and man, and in our own hearts also,
that so in the comfortable feeling of it, we may have assurance of hope and
heart, that we shall not be confounded in that which is to come. And to this we
cannot come or be brought, but by making special use of and particular
applying unto our own souls, the points of instruction, or the several and
sundry actions that God does for, or amongst the sons of men. Without which
indeed, as in the public ministry, all pains taken is but labor lost, and
as it were words spoken in the air, as the examples of former ages, and the
experience of our own times, do but too sufficiently show: so in all private
doctrines or documents, whether they be delivered by the audible voice of man,
or propounded unto us by the works of God, in his mercy toward his own
people, or in his judgments toward the wicked, will be at the most, but as
a wonder of nine days, as we say in the Proverb, and like unto water spilt
upon the ground. True it is, and I am sure every good man will confess it,
that neither the one nor the other, can indeed, either do us good in this life,
or further us unto eternal salvation (to make us without excuse and defense
before God, and in our selves, I deny not, but some power they have) otherwise
than as they are sanctified, by the almighty working of the blessed spirit.
And therefore, when, or where, or howsoever God deals with us, we should
presently and unfeignedly humble our selves in prayer, and call and crave for
grace to profit thereby. Howbeit though that I mean the gracious work of Gods
spirit in our hearts, be a principal mean of our spiritual profiting, yet
neither is it the only, neither indeed does it fol low thereupon, that the
others above recited, should be rejected or refused. For even as in our
natural life, the first and chief cause of all is God himself, who as he
gives it us, so vpholdeth it and maintains it, according to his good will,
that being here true that the Apostle says, In him we live, we move, and have
our being: and yet no man so unwise as to refuse meat, drink, cloth, sleep,
and other necessary helps and aides that way, for that were to tempt God, and
to live (if some one or other could do it) rather a miraculous than a natural
life, so in our spiritual life, though God by his holy spirit work all in
all, in the hearts of them that he has marked out unto eternal blessedness,
yet no man that fears God, or cares for his own salvation, neglects, much
less despises the word, sacraments, prayer, admonitions, exhortations,
rebukes, public, private, etc. but more carefully frequenteth, and more
religiously uses the same, and labors more to treasure the^ up in his heart
for goodness, than he does all or any of the outward things appertaining to the
body or natural man. And even so is it in this case, of applying to our
purpose, and making use in our souls of the ways and works of God, general
or particular, open or secret. To that therefore we come, as indeed unto the
life and soul of the other things before going, and therein direct our
speech, as first to the whole land generally, who upon every such particular
occasion should make special profit, as well because all the several members
in a kingdom, or in a Church, make but one political or ecclesiastical
body, and therefore if one suffer, all should suffer, and if one rejoice, all
should do likewise, as also because some in Gods purpose and judgment are
stricken, that all or many others, at the least might amend, because all have
sinued and gone astraye, and stand in need of the grace of God. And this is
that surely that our Savior means, when in the Gospel he says, were those
Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices, greater sinners
than all the other? I tell you nay, but except ye amend your lives, ye shall
all likewise perish: so secondly to the particular persons, and places touched
and afflicted with this present and searefull judgment, who if others, then
they much more, should unfeignedly stoop down, and heartily and hastily also
humble themselves, under the hand that has stricken them, by how much not only
in their own knowledge and conscience, their sins are greater than other
men's, but also because the punishment was present in their eyes, fell upon
their bodies, goods, and houses, and should (which whether it does yea or no
I know not, but if it do not, I pray God it may) more effectually therefore
pearce and enter into their souls and spirits, for all time, present, and to
come. What a mighty hand of God has gone forth against the whole land, by
manifold and fearful fires in the several quarters and corners of it? which
whosoever will but seriously think upon them that are past, and recall to
memory those that howsoever men forget them, are yet fresh, and as it were
bleeding in the hearts and eyes of them that fear God, he caunot choose but see
and confess strange and wonderful judgments. In some particulars behold the
rest: the burning of Beckles, the wasting of Nantwich, the co^suming of
Marleborough in the west, and which though it come in the last place is not the
least judgment, the destroying of Stratforde upon Auon twice in one year,
with that great and grievous punishment. Nay let us proceed further, London
the blazing beacon to the whole land, and the mother city of all the
kingdom, has bin made through the justice of God against it for sin, a
fearful spectacle of Gods wrath to others, not only while diverse private
men's houses, goods and possessions have been defaced thereby, but while the
steeple of their cathedral Church (a place that many imagined for the devotion
and holiness of it could not have been touched with any such judgment) was not
only inflamed and consumed it self, but ministered matter of fear also, and
that not without good cause and respect, that it would have fired the whole
city it self. Sundry other sorts of judgments has God exercised that
famous place, and the whole land withal, as with that infectiue and
destroying sickness the plague or pestilence, that noisome disease of the
small pocks, measels, etc. great penury and scarsitie of victuals, and by
means thereof and together with the same, a general dearth of all things,
belonging either to the pleasures or the profits of this present life: to which
also add the threatening of the sword for a fearful invasion, and the fear
of domestical stirs to disturb our long and happy peace, with infinite
others, according to the innumerable multitude of sins and transgressious
multiplied against his majesty, the very sting whereof stands up in our
souls to accuse us every night when we lie down, and every day when we rise
up. And yet who has, I will not say soundly profited by these things, for
unfeigned humiliation before God, but thought seriously upon them for the
bettering of us, or for any other good respect before men in the world.
Certainly whosoever will look into these things with a single eye, I do not
think the contrary, but he shall clearly perceive, that whatsoever iniquity
was in any particular person, state, or degree amongst us, or whatsoever
disorder was either in church or common wealth, it rests notwithstanding this
hand of justice and judgment gone forth against us still unreformed: as
though we thought that God in heaven did not either behold our sins, or did
strike us without cause, or as though there were no end why he did punish us.
And though it be true indeed, that in the midst of these judgments, he has
remembered mercy, and has not let his wrath lie hard upon us, lest we also
might reach out our hands to iniquity, but has given us great abundance of
manifold favors, turning our sickness into health, our penury into plenty,
our dread of danger and distress into all manner of holy joy, and over and
besides has bestowed upon us the blessed light of his holy word both in the
public ministry and private exercises of it, the very know ledge and light
of it breaking forth as the flowings of the sea, if we could so have accepted
of it: and all this has been done to this end, that we might have been led
by the lines of love, and cords of men, to have walked more uprightly and
carefully with the Lord; who is the God of our life, and of our health, and of
our peace and all: yet have we misled by the malice of Satan, and through the
corruption of our own hearts, and deceived by the pleasures of sin, which
endure but for a while, lift up our heels and our hands against him, and
hardened our hearts and our faces against all his ways, in all his works,
either of mercy or of judgment, for he that was filthy, is filthy still,
and all the abominations of the land (under the burden whereof also the very
earth it self groaneth, and therefore men should much more mourn, if they were
not senseles and graceles) are so far off from being lessened and diminished,
that they daily increase and get head amongst us and over us, which whosoever
will but in vprightnes of heart and judgment, in the particulars consider of,
cannot but give glory unto God, and herein acknowledge and confess the truth.
As for the pride of the land, it is increased, not only by the excess and
abuse of our commodities at home, but by bringing in of foreign wares, and
old and new fond devises, which in the finenes and in the variety and
vanity of them, do over and besides wast and wear the wealth of our own
country, our gold, silver, tin, lead, and other things of worth and
durablenes, being transported for such trumperie. Gluttony and drunkenness, I
think, did never so much abound, no not when England had the name for great
hospitality and housekeeping, there being come now in the steed of it, not
only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich, noble and all, either no
housekeeping at all, or the same so pinching and miserable, as not only the
poor being ready to starve in our streets, cry out of it, but even the very
maniall servants, many times do very bitterly, and that not without good
cause, complain of the same also.

Touching the extortion, oppression, briberie, usury and other iniquities that
every where amongst high and low do daily prevail, what shall we say, the
very stones in the street, and the beasts in the field, and other dumb and
insensible creatures, though men should hold their tongues, do in their kind,
seriously cry out against it and say, even as the Prophet did in his days,
Justice is turned into gall and wormwood, and the poor are bought and sold
for silver, and the needy for shoes: whoredom and filthy life, in all sorts
and degrees of men, both openly and secretly, did never so much over flow and
increase as at this day. The civil Magistrate says, either he has no law to
punish it, or corrects it at the most with a simple whipping: and as for
those that have the ecclesiastical censures in their hands, they surely have
no will to do it, but use their authority rather to pick men's purses, than to
instruct their consciences, and to convert men unto God. Yea, I wish with all my
heart, that even the very ministers themselves, to whom for ought I see, there
is no other thing left to repress evil by, than crying out against iniquity,
were not in this as in other matters of as great consequence tongue-tied and
mute, or else as the prophet says in another place, that they were light and
wicked persons, and had polluted the sanctuary, and wrested the law. To
rehearse all transgressions in the several sorts and particularities of them,
would be too long and tedious, take one therefore, and the same as the most
common, so the most grievous, that by it we may judge also of the rest: the
profanation of the Sabbath is the sin that I mean. Where is the man, woman,
or child, that has care and conscience publicly to sanctify it, either by
reverent and religious preparing of themselves to come to public assemblies as
they should, or to repair thither duetifullie as they ought, or to carry
themselves there as beseems such heavenly exercises of prayer, preaching,
etc. What househoulder, man or woman, what child, what servant has any regard
privately to spend it well in meditation and conference of things publicly
taught them, in singing of psalms, in prayer, in thinking seriously upon the
creatures, in visiting the sick, in doing the works of charity and
christian love? Or rather who prophaneth it not in public, and in private, by
themselves and in company and in every place almost: some by thinking it to be
a day of bodily rest only, and therefore give themselves and theirs over to
sleep more and longer then, than on other days besides: other some making no
more account of the holy assemblies of the church, and religious exercises
therein, than of profane and common meetings, nor so much many times, and
receiving the word with no more reverence and attention than a profane tail,
other some sitting idle at their doors, gaping and gazing, suffering, yea some
times commanding their servants and children to abuse it, by dicing, daunsing,
carding, stooleball playing, and other unlawful and wicked recreations: others
also poasting over their worldly affairs, as matters of accountes, repayring
to Justices for execution of law, visiting and intertaining their friends, and
such other worldly things, to that day, with a thousand such like
abominations, fearfully committed and performed upon that day, that of all
others should be best spent. For these may not we say, as the Prophet
speaks in cases of meaner importance: Shall not the land tremble for this,
and every one mourn that dwells therein? Or as another Prophet speaks
against the people that descended from Iaakob, for their pride, contempt of
Gods word; and other iniquities, Aram before, and the Philistines behind, and
they shall devour Israel with open mouth, and yet for all this his wrath is
not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still: and good reason, for the
people turns not unto him that strikes them justly for their sins, neither
do they seek the Lord of hosts: therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel,
head and tail, branch and body in one day. The ancient and the honorable man
he is the head, and the Prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail, with many
such other things as follow in that ninth chapter of Isatah, which I would
desire the godly reader, with care to look upon, and in conscience to make use
of. For who knows whether this be yet, the day of Gods grace offered, and
the acceptable time if it be received? Or who can tell whether this be not a
foretelling and a forerunning sign also, that the land may (and that or ever
it be long, for ought we know) be consumed with fire from the West, by the
Turk, Pope, Spaniard, and other instruments of Gods wrath to punish a sinful
and rebellious nation: All which would be glad, not only for the enlarging of
their territories and kingdoms, but even of hatred more than cruel, and
bloody against us to whet their teeth upon our bodies and bones, and to bath
their swords in our blood: or else who can or dare say, that this may not be an
assured testimony, that the Lord Jesus shall shortly come in the clouds, in a
melting and consuming fire going before him, and destroying all things, with
great power and glory to judge the quick and the dead? Sin not at the height it
is at, does in full provoke the one, and with earnestnes calls for our
adversaries to come out against us in troops and armies, and on the other side
all signs (if I be not deceived) that should go before that great and
terrible day of the Lord be accomplished already. Since things then are so
uncertain, that we know not when nor where, nor how the Lord will come upon
us, and yet we cannot but fear that he is nigh, even at the door, why
should we defer with the wicked, even therein, or thereby, causing the
Lords wrath to break forth against us to our utter confusion: or rather
considering that all these things must be dissolved, why do we not make this
use of it, to learn what manner of people we should be in holy conversation
and godly life, looking for, and hastening unto the coming of that day of the
Lord, by the which the very heavens being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the
elements shall melt with heat? But who (I will not say practices these things,
for the number of such persons is almost as rare in the world, as a black
swanne amongst fowls) thinks upon these things seriously? Surely, surely,
the most part busy their minds and their mouths also far otherwise: for
some give themselves over to filthy and foolish speech, which not only
brings no grace or godly edification to the hearer, but rather corrupts
good manners. Other some though they fall not so foully, yet are overtaken in
their discourses of pleasure, of profit, hauking, hunting, merchandise,
purchasing lands, etc. which though in themselves they be not evil, yet
because they continually put better matter out of place, they are become the
sin of their souls. And if it so fall out, that now and then, they or some of
them stumble upon good things, be it either in word or deed, by the motion of
their own mind, or occasion from others, it is certainly but as a flashe
lightening, no man knows whence it comes, nor whither it goes, and even
vanishes away, as if it were in the first appearing of it. And therefore
surely through their sins of ignorance, negligence, carelesnes, contempt and
prophanenes, it is likely that vengeance shall break forth from the Lord in a
grievous both measure and manner, and fearfully consume both bough and branch,
root and body, trunk stock, and all in a day.

And if this be the state and condition of the generality, as indeed it is,
what shall become of the particulars, the whole body consisting of them as it
were of several parts, but that they also must remain under the same
judgment? To you therefore that now are under this hand and hammer of Gods
heavy indignation is it that I write and speak. Can you deny, but that even
many days and years already passed, you have long ago pulled this and a
more grievous judgment by much, down upon you from almighty God? If you
should, the heavens would blush at you, and the earth would bear witness
against you, and testify unto your faces, the filthiness of your words and
works. Me thinks it should be far better for you to give glory to God,
and unfeignedly confess that it is his singular favor to have spared you so
long, and that it is his more then common mercy, that ye were not al consumed.
What has been threatened against you out of Gods word, you cannot be ignorant
of. What punishments have light upon you, by the plague, the small pockes, and
now this last fearful fire, you cannot but feel. What? Has God stricken you
without a cause? Be it far from you, either to speak it or think it, for that
were to condemn the most just judge of the world for your own clearing, yea
and to go against the stinging testimony which every day when you rise up, and
every night when you lie down, tells you the clean contrary. But if you
should proceed to that height, are not other me^ that have watched over you,
and preached and spoken unto you in the name of the Lord, able to convince you
of falsehood to your faces, and to throw the dounge of your iniquity upon your
countenances? Give them therefore leave to declare the truth to you, and labor
to bear with patience, and to profit by the word of exhortation, since it is
directed to you for your good, and unfeigned humiliation also: for they know
you, and your offenses far better than you your selves. Perhaps you will think
this speech strange, but deceive not your own hearts, I beseech you, for if
you will weigh, that naturally we are blind to discern sin, and after they
see it, yet many times they are partial in their own ways, and even bleare
up their understanding, and harden their hearts, and again that they are more
quick and better sighted, to discern other men's transgressions than their
own: as also that God reuealeth not the sins of the people unto his faithful
servants the Prophets by the halfes, I think you would, or at the least I am
sure you should be of another mind. To reckon up all the particulars were hard
and impossible, for who can understand his faults? And yet not to lay down
some, were to fail in the iustififying of the charge, which were unjust, and
to let you alone in your iniquities, which should be uncharitable. This
therefore I say, that amongst the infinite and innumerable sins of your
souls, there are some particulars that have been and are most odious before
God, and most apparent in the view of the world. Amongst which I reckon in the
first place a fearful contempt of godliness in the most of you, and a great
and grievous carelessness thereof even in the best. How often and long has God
spoken unto you, by the public ministry of his word, in the holy exercises
of prayer, preaching, administration and participation of his blessed
sacraments? If you could have seen your happiness in that behalf, both for the
length of them, and the graces of the men that God used as means to publish
his truth unto you, your favors both ways not far inferior to any
congregation of the land, and in these respects indeed going before many it
had been well: but how little you have profited by them, nay how carelessly
you have heard them, and how coldly you have frequented them, your gross
ignorance in the grounds of Christian religion shows the first, few or none
of you being able to render a reason thereof, to them that shall ask you, and
your sleeping in the church, talking one with another, and turning of your
books there, and using of your own private devotions or prayers in the time
of public preaching and prayer, a grievous transgression no doubt proves the
second: and your daily and continual absence therfrom, and specially upon the
Lords day then lying in your beds, haunting of alehouses, riding and going
abroad for your worldly affairs of pleasure and profit manifests the third.
And how weary you are when you are there let this testify: none prevent the
time of public assemblies, and some come in the midst of your exercises, to
the great disturbance of the same, and others that are there: and that some
again before the sermons are finished, other some after the prayers made, and
before the singing of the Psalm, and the usual blessing to be pronounced
depart thence, whereof you as well as they that tarry should be partakers,
posting also out of the Church, as it were from a play or may game, as though
you supposed, that no more reverence should be showed there than in other
places, or that some part of divine service belonged unto you and not other
some, whereas in truth you ought to be alike partakers of the whole. And how
should we look for any goodness where this that is the seed of sin, and the
nurse of all abominations swayeth so much? Surely when men have once cast Gods
law behind their backs, and have it not in deed in a high and reverend
regard, what can there be to restrain them from evil? or to direct them in
good? Nay what shall not then be right and lawful, though indeed it be
never so corrupt and vile. From this therefore, as from a stream and fountain
of filthiness, have flowed all your oaths, particular transgressions, as first
for example your swearing and cursing: by the first blaspheming of Gods name,
and haling down wrath and vengeance from the Lord upon your selves, your wives,
children, family, friends, yea all the goods and cattle that you have and
possess, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in
vain, and sure we are that the plague of God shall not depart from the house
of the swearer: as also we may perceive by the sign of the flying book
mentioned Zachar. 5. in which were contained curses against every one that
swears, who also should be cut off as well on this side, as on that: yea that
this judgment should enter into, and remain in the midst of such swerers
houses, and should consume the same with the timber thereof, and stones
thereof. And by the second not only testifying the malice and madness of your
own hearts, against men and other creatures of GOD, upon which you power out
the poison of your minds and mouths, but drawing iniquity with the cords of
vanity, and sin as it were with cart ropes, that so that might be fulfilled
in you, that in the book of Psalms is spoken of the notorious wicked, As he
loved cursing, so shall it come unto him, and as he loved not blessing so shall
it be far from him: and as he clothed himself with cursing like a raiment,
so shall it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. And
by both of them defiling the air above you, and polluting the earth beneath
you, with the creatures thereupon, yea by your bad examples, infecting and
corrupting your wives, children, servants, and all that have any conversation
or acquaintance with you, who having nothing to learn from you but that which
is evil, will in the pronenesse of their own nature to naughtiness, easily
tread in your bad steps, and much more easily resemble you in corruption, than
other men in goodness, by how much you do more nighly and straightly by many
ways touch them than others. And as for your own idleness, and the bad
bringing up of your youth and children, both sons and daughters, it is
pitiful to behold, and I cannot without great grief of heart, think or
speak of it: what a shame before men, nay indeed what sin is it before God,
to see amongst you day laborers and men of manual occupations (who according
to Gods ordinance, and his just punishment upon them for sin, should eat their
bread in the sweat of their brows, and get it as we say with their fingers
ends) haunt and frequent alehouses, spending there not only hours, but
days, and in that time besides the neglect of their callings, by which they
should maintain themselves and theirs, wasting that also which they have
gotten, and should be as the reward of their honest labors, so the necessary and
needful relief of their wives, children, and other at home, where they should
rather spend it in deed, to the increase of mutual comfort amongst
themselves, than upon the sons of Beliall, and wicked and lewd persons in
those houses of unthriftiness, yea some of them of dishonesty? Now for your
youth, is it not lamentable to see boys and girls, of ten, twelve, yea a
fourteen years of age, and many under these years also, to swarm in your
streets, and to run up and down daily in mire and dirt, both wearing out
their shoes, and spoiling their apparel, and that without laying their hands
to any honest labors to get some thing toward their maintenance and relief?
Yea and some of them I fear me that follow not this bad trade, worse occupied
by much, in pilfering, breaking of hedges, learning to lie, swear, and make no
concsience of any sin. And as for those few that you seem to put to
learning, if you consider the places whither they go, the persons to whom (I
need nor particularize this, for you know what I mean) and the small profit
they take thereby, it were almost as small a transgression before God and men,
to let them live idly with the rest, as to train them up in sort as they are.
God has graciously provided far better for you, if you could either see it or
have care and conscience to use it well. As for your selves, you have long ago
done what you could to put religion from you, by offering not only manifold
unkindness to the persons that offered it unto you, but contempt to the
truth it self, and yet though it be full sore against your wills, it is by
honorable, and others, and those that love you, and care for you more than your
selves, vphelde still. And now what go you about, namely to banish learning
from you and yours? Perhaps you will think it a hard charge, but surely it
appears not only by this, that you suffer your schoolehouse, the place
appointed for the good bringing up of your youth, to go to foul decay, but
have no regard at all in a manner that they might attain to some good measure
of knowledge in humane learning, what will be the issue consider: in a word.
Contempt of the word carries with it always all manner of impiety: and lack
of knowledge, breeds all barbarousnes: and then what can you look for, but
even to have that fulfilled in you, that the scripture speaks of a rebellious
and stifnecked people, Ephraim shall eat up Manasseh, and Manasseh Ephraim,
and so you to become a savage and wild people deuoid of piety, charity,
religion, righteousness, love, etc. and filled with all manner of ungodliness
and sin, to which as seems to me by your crooked paths, you have made more
than post haste already. And though God by many crosses and losses laid upon
you and yours, labor to stay you therefrom, and particularly has plagued
almost al of you, with great and grievous poverty, (more I am sure than many
of you will be known of) so that (some few of you excepted) you live for the
most part by shifting, if not dishonest devises and trades: yet you will not see
the hand that strikes you with beggerie as it were, and contempt for your
idleness and carelesnes, and so turn unto him, but shifting it from your selves
unto others, unjustly lay the fault upon those that in many respects have
been but too bountiful and beneficial unto you and yours. And yet I would even
from the bottom of my heart, if GOD saw it so good, that your iniquity and
sin had stayed here, and had not proceeded further. But surely it is far
otherwise with you: for as the godly through the light of God his truth, and the
powerful working of his blessed spirit, are mightily carried from faith to
faith, and from one good work to an other, so are you in Satan's malice against
you, and the strength of your own corruption violently harried from one
transgression to another evil, that so that may be true in you, that the
Apostle speaks. The wicked must wax worse and worse, and filling up the
measure of their transgressions, be at the last overwhelmed with his most
fearful and just judgments. What shall I say of your excessive drinking,
abusing therein and therewith that and many other his good creatures, given you
sometimes for necessity especially, and some times for delight also, I
confess? yea, is it not written in many of your faces and foreheads, so that
he that regards but the rednes of your eyes, the heat of your countenances,
the swelling of your veins, and sundry such other outward signs of
intemperancie, might with small a do point and painte out, what manner of men
you are, and as if it were with great capital letters written in your
foreheads, so as he that runs may read the same, see and behold bouling
and quaffing written therein? And yet herein is this your sin amongst others,
become exceedingly sinful, that many of you leave your own houses, and go up
and down to other places for strong drink and company, and not contented
therewith, you delight to draw others from towns and places abroad and round
about you, to be partakers with you of the self same iniquity, and that not
only upon your market and fair days, and times of resort, but even upon
other days of the week, yea upon the Lords day it self, wherein you are so
far off from withstanding evil, that not one of you yet for ought I know,
has been found either to repress this foul vice of quaffing and drunkenness
in your selves, or to shut your doors against them that fall into riot and
excess that way. Add unto these, the adulteries, whoredoms and fearful
filthinesses that have heretofore, and daily do fall out amongst you, and
then you shall see also, whether God have causeleslie stricken you, with this
and other judgments: or whether you have not indeed good cause for the same,
unfeignedly and speedily to humble your selves least otherwise the wrath begun,
proceed and break forth, to an utter wasting of you and yours. For your
secret sins that way, I will say nothing, but leave them to God to whom they
are best known, and to your own hearts, which should be touched with a godly
sorrow for them, and for your other iniquities likewise. Consider a little I
pray you of your open transgressions, and weigh them for amendment of life.
Diverse of your daughters and maidseruants, have been in former time and of
late, shamefully defiled. Your sons and other of your families, have been the
authors and the actors of this grievous villainy, wherein also sundry of them
have grown to this shamelessness in their sin, that they have gone with out
stretched necks, and brazen foreheads, as though they had done none iniquity
at all. Your town by this mernes too much impouerished already, has been
charged with the keeping of a bastardlye brood, beside other foul
inconveniences that have followed and flowen from this grievous transgression.
To reckon up the rest of your iniquities would be to too tedious, by these
labor to learn, to loath, and to leave them, and all the other whatsoever, and
soundly and speedily to turn unto the Lord, and no doubt but you shall find
favor, for yet with the Lord there is mercy, that he may be feared.
Otherwise, know and assure your selves, that if through the pleasures of sin
which endure but for a while, your hearts shall be hardened, and you either
put the evil day far from you, or do not with speed turn unto God, in a
holy conversation and amendment of life, you and yours shall both feel the
hand of God pursuing you in this life, and eternally perish in that which is
to come. Good and bad are this day propounded unto you, and the way of life and
death set before your eyes, Look well to it, and beware that the Lord have not
just occasion through your carelesesse and contempt of his truth, to say, Thy
destructon, O Israel, is of thy self, I know that the ways and the works
of a man's life, are not in his own hands or power, but that it is God that
works in us, both the will and the deed according to his own good pleasure.
