TO THE HONORABLE AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR ROBERT CARRE, Gentleman of the Kings
Bedchamber, etc. all holy Wisdom to walk in the Way to eternal Bliss.
SIR,
YOur extraordinary approbation, and acceptance of my Directions for walking
with God, falling into your hands, by Gods good providence, I know not how;
accompanied with such noble circumstances, and expressions of much undeserved
respect to the Author; but especially of your affectionate love to the 1. Tim.

glorious Gospel of the blessed God (far dearer to every gracious heart,
which truly tastes the mystery, and mercies of Christ in it; then it is
dearest blood, or whatsoever is most de^^re-able under the Sun, or admired
most amongst the Sons of men), has encouraged me at this time, to take the
boldness, to present this present Treatise more immediately, and by special
interest into your own hand. And I am the far better pleased with my choice;
because I hold it a matter of singular comfort, and special consequence, to
have an hand in diverting the eye of any, that attends upon earthly Majesty,
from too much gazing upon the outward illustrious splendor, which is wont to
glister in the Courts of great Princes; to the admiration, and embracement of
the glorious, and ever-lasting beauty of the Lord Jesus: In respect whereof,
all the fairest beams of felicity and joy, which shine from the most orient
Imperial Diadems, that crown the face of the Earth, are but a Moate of
darkness, and Lump of vanity. And that for diverse reasons; 1. First, Such as
stand in the presence of mighty Kings, are, or ever should be, men of greatest
parts, deepest understandings, and most eminent abilities every Way: Which
being happily sanctified by a fruitful influence from Heaven; and by the help
of the holy Ghost, bent to the right end, and spent upon the Objects, they
ought; become gloriously serviceable to the King of Kings; proportionably to
their native excellency above ordinary gifts, and the vulgar sort of
sufficiencies. Great endowments, in what kind soever, gvided by a divine hand,
in their exercise and agitations, do ever, a great deal of good. To give
Instance, and not stir from the Court: The Lord of Heaven vouchsafed to King
James, of famous memory, and One of the learnedest Princes, that ever wore a
Crown upon Earth, such a strong and enlarged understanding, that we should
have magnified it, as admirable, even in a private man. The same good hand of
providence in great mercy, directed it upon the right Object; even the defense
of the But as for the holy truth professed by my self, and those of the

approove, and like the practice of King killing; wherefore has not his
Holiness imposed some severe censure, with a fearful frown, upon the Book
of Mariana the Jesuit, (by whom Parricides are commended, Nay, highly
extolled) when his Holiness has been pleased to call-in some other of
Mariana's books. Again, wherefore did his Holiness advise himself, to
censure the decree of the Court of Parliament in Paris against John Chastell?
Wherefore did he suffer Garnet and Oldcorne, my Powder-miners, both by Books
and Pictures, vendible under his nose in Rome, to be inro^led in the Canon of
holy Martyrs? And when He saw two great Kings murdered one after another:
wherefore by some public declaration did not his Holiness testify to all
Christendom, his inward sense, and true apprehension of so great misfortune,
as all Europe had just cause to lament, on the behalf of France? Wherefore did
not his Holiness publish some Law, or Pontificiall Decree, to provide for the
security of Kings in time to come? Ibid. page 222.223. See Histor. Jesuit. put

given such a deadly wound to that Beast of Rome, that He is never like to
stand upon His four legs again: He has also left in His learned Labors,
such an immortal monument of Demonstrative light, and invincible Remonstrance
against that bloody superstition, that I am persuaded, it will prove a most
sovereign The mighty working of King James his Works upon the Adversaries, is
intimated unto us to in the Preface before his Works.

They look upon His Majesty's Books, as men looking upon Blazing (...), with
amazement; feating they portend some strange thing; and bring with them a
certain influence, to work great change and alteration in the World: Neither
is their expectation herein deceived; For we have seen with our eyes, the
Operation of His Majesty's Works in the Consciences of their Men so far, as
from their highest Con^l^ve to their lowest Cells, there have been, that have
been converted by them. Bishop of Winten.

detestation of Popery. Chamier, that great glory of France, and the whole
Christian World, was bountifully enriched from Heaven with singularity of
learning, and Polemicall Parts; which being turned the right way, have happily
produced a Panstratia, such victorious Volumes, and so unanswerably triumphant
over all Popish Sophistry; that not all the Jesuits in Christendom, tho they
should rake Hell afresh, for some new, rotten distinctions, to uphold their
tottering Babell, shall ever be able to reply to any purpose. Gnash the teeth

out of the Body, may be innocent of the fact. O Hell Hounds! O diabolical
wretches! O infernal Monsters! How long then? How long shall Kings, whom the
Lord has called his Anointed; Kings, the breathing Images of God upon earth;
Kings, that with a wry, or frowning look, are able to crush these earth-wormes

World for pure clemency and humanity. Ibid. page 235. Adue religion of the

Sir Francis Bacon. Essaie. Of Religion.
Butcherers of people, Firers of States, and Blowers-up of Parliaments, as
former Histories never heard of. Thus, when men of Place, and imploiment,
mighty and remarkable in the World, improove the utmost possibilites of their
Wit and Art; of all their natural, and acquired Parts, to serve their own
turns, and attain their private ends; to rise, revenge, grow rich; or more
immediately by some special service, to advance the Kingdom of darkness, and
dominion of Antichrist; O the Luciferian pride, the injustice, the cruelty, the
Machiavellisme; the putting of fair pretenses upon pestilent plots; the
drowning of innocence in the Depths of State; the crafty and merciless
pressures of Gods people, and those, over whom they domineere! It is then a
work of great Weight and Worthiness, to win a great man to the ways of God.
Hereby the common state of goodness is mightily strengthened; and which is an
equal happiness, the Devils side goes down, and Belials hang the head. For
according to the eminency of his Gifts, and greatness of Place, is the
excellency of good, or excess of ill, that He does. It were to be wished
therefore, if God so pleased, that all the incurable, and implacable enemies to
the grace of God, good men, and power of godliness, were Dunces and Fools;
that they might not be able to manage their malice and power, with such Depths
and dexterity, to the more dangerous under-mining of the kingdom of Christ;
and their own more desperate ruin, and greater damnation. 2. Secondly, Great
men are subject to great temptations; And therefore, it is the harder Task,
and more honorable triumph, to turn them on Gods side. Had not an All-mighty
hand mastered the temptation, steeled his Faith, and represented to his eye,
the matchless glory of an immortal Crown; Moses had never been able to have
parted with the magnificent state, and pomp of Pharaohs Court: where He might
have wallowed in variety of all worldly delights; and to take part, with His
afflicted Brethren, of a world of miseries, in a vast and roaring Wilderness.
There was never carnal man since the Creation, but in such a Case would have
followed the Court, and forsaken Gods people. Hester, a weak Woman, could
never possibly have holden out, against the fury of so mighty a Favorite, the
hazarding of Her high Place, the favor of so great a King, and even life it
self; had She not been upholden by an extraordinary strength from Heaven. No
great Woman in the World, wanting Grace, would ever have run such an hazard:
but have suffered the servants of God to sink, or swim; so that She might
swim down the Current of the times without crossing, and enjoy the present
without peril. It was a (...) temptation* (...) ^^nathan, and a very (...)
Dilemma: Either, leave to adhere to David, or resolve to lose a Kingdom. But
the hope of an earthly Crown, could not hire Him to hold His peace, and betray
the innocence of His heavenly Friend: And Jonathan answered Saul his Father,
and said unto Him; Wherefore shall He be slain? What has He done? The
dread of dis-countenance from two angry Kings, whose indignation is as the
roaring of a Lion, was a terrible Motive, to have made Michajah temporize: (not
a Server of the Times, and His own turn in the World, but would in this Case
have tuned His Pipe to Ahabs pleasure, especially encouraged by the flattering
concurrence of so many false prophets). But the sight of the mighty Lord of
Heaven and Earth sitting upon His Throne, and all the Host of Heaven standing
by Him, infused such an holy fortitude into the spirit of this Man of God; that
no greatness, terror, or Majesty of any crowned Potentate, could possibly
daunt His courage, or dash Him out of countenance: And therefore He answers
with a resolution, as high as Heaven, and out of a sacred pang of seraphicall
zeal: As the Lord lives, whatsoever the Lord says unto me, that will I
speak. So that He may discharge a good conscience, and do as God would have
Him, He is at a Point. That Message, which the ^lmighty had put into His
mouth, must (...) Him to a centur^ (...) from so (...) own Coat; to a
suspicion of dis-loyalty, for crossing so peremptorily the Kings Plot; to
smiting, both with the fist of wickedness, and taunts of the tongue, from His
fellow Seers: Nay, tho His faithful dealing throw Him into a Dungeon, there to
be fed with the Bread of affliction, and Water of affliction; until the full
wrath of an enraged profane King fall upon Him to the uttermost. Thus, let the
World say what it will, whatever flesh and blood suggest to the contrary;
Howsoever unsanctified great Ones storm and disdain; yet assuredly, every
true Friend to Jesus Christ, must be content far rather to be dis-courted,
then desert a good cause; or not to defend the innocence of a gracious Man, tho
in disgrace; and to speak for Gods people, tho Haman rage to root them out
quite, as a company of singular exorbitant fellows, who serve God as they
list, and keep not the Kings Laws: Hest. 3.8.
As is unanswerably evident, by the precedence of these newly named, noble, and
holy Saints. I confess, this may seem precise Doctrine, and a divine Paradox
to all the great Masters of pleasure, and Minions of luxury and pride; whose
blood runs fresh in their veins, and marrow is yet strong in their bones;
Nay, who having attained the height of their ambitious aims, sit now aloft in
the very top of their un-blessed bravery and greatness, drunk with the
pleasant wine of worldly prosperity, and holding in scorn, the holy preaching
of the good way, the syncerity of the servants of Christ, and society of the

precise walking, will incomparably more comfort them upon their Dying-Beds, in
that great and last encounter with all infernal powers, about the immortality,
bliss and glory; or the endless, and unsupportable pains, and misery of
their Souls; then if they had been the sole, and sovereign Commanders of all
the Kingdoms of the Earth, all their life long. But no marvel in the mean
time, that, as the Spirit of truth tells us, and punctually to my purpose; 1.
Cor. 1.26.
Not many Wise men after the flesh, nor many Mighty, not many Noble are called:
Not for any impossibility; For the irresistible might of the Spirit, works
upon whom it will; and some Great Men are good: but by reason of the
difficulty. Being beset with such variety, and strength of temptations, they
are rarelier, and hardlier wrought upon by the Word, and woone out of Satan's
en-snarements. High rooms, temporary happiness, and abilities above ordinary,
so puff them up, and transport them beyond themselves, with such a deal of
Self-love, Selfe-opinion, Self-prizing; that their proud and obstinated
spirits, will by no means stoop to the simplicity of the Gospel, ^^gularitie
of the Saints, and the foolishness of preaching. But if at any time, they
hear of a Nathan, Jeremy, Amos, Chrysostom, Latimer, etc. They are very loath
to lend their attention, lest thereby, they should be made Melancholic, put
in mind of the Evil day, and tormented before their time. But if they have the
patience, They are ready to startle in their seats, and whisper One to an
Other: You see now these preciser Fellows would damn us all to Hell: Let us
break their bonds asunder, and cast away their Cords from us. Such ado there
is, and a world of work, to bring such noble Bedlams into their right minds;
and to fright such Idolizers of their own sufficiencies; and wilful graspers
of their gilded Fetters, from their admired follies, and honorable servitude.
3. Thirdly, a gracious Man about a Royal Person, is a goodly Sight; and full
well worth even a Kings Ransom. Fidi imperator bus manete, sed any hos Deo,
propter quem and ijs, quibus commissi a^ traditi estis. Nazian. Orat. 12.

At qui propter Deum? Quia si Deum m^tuetis, and studiose dabitis operam, ut
eius mandata servetis, fideles his etiam Dei causa eritis. Elias.


For never any, except himself truly fear the great God of Heaven, can
possibly be cordially, and conscionably serviceable to any of our earthly
Gods. A Principle so clear, and unquestionable, that no Man of understanding,
and Master of his own Wits, except himself be notoriously obnoxious, can have
the face to deny it. Please they may, be politically plausible, flatter
extremely, and represent themselves to ordinary observation, as the only Men
for loyalty and love: But if we could search, and see their hearts, we should
find them then most laborious to serve themselves; and advance their own ends,
when they seem most zealous for their Sovereigns service. Ahitophel, in the
Sunshine of peace, and calmness of the Kingdoms time, did accommodate
himself to the present, both in Consultations of State, and religious
conformity: But no sooner had this hollow-hearted man espied a dangerous
tempest, raised by Absoloms un-naturall treachery, but He turned Traitor to
his natural Lord: when He observed the Wind to blow another way, He followed
the blast, and set his sails according to the weather: Which made David after
complain; But it was thou, O Man, even my Companion, my Guide and Familiar: We
took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the House of God in company.
Wherefore let Great Men, without grace, profess, and pretend what they will;
and protest the impossibility of any such thing, as Hazael did in an other
Case; yet ordinarily, (I know not what some One moral Puritan amongst a
million might do) in such tumultuous times, and of universal confusion, for
the securing of their temporal happiness; which, without timely turning on
Gods side, is all the heaven they are like to have in this World, or the World
to come: I say, upon a Point of great advantage, and advancement with safety,
they would fly from the declining State, and downe-fall of their old Master;
tho formerly the mightiest Monarch upon earth, as from the ruins of a falling
house. And it can be no otherwise; for they have no internal Principle, or
super-naturall power, to illighten and enable them, to set their shoulders
against the Torrent of the times, and to be overflowne with it. But now, He
that truly fears God, would rather lose His high Place; Nay, his posterity; As
much hearts-blood, if He had it, as would animate a whole Kingdom; then leave
His lawful Sovereign Lord, in such a Case, upon any terms, tho He might
have even the Imperial Crown set upon His own Head. For conscience, that
poor neglected Thing; Nay, in these last, and looser times, even laughed at by
men of the World; yet a stronger tie of Subjects hearts unto their Sovereigns,
then Man or Devil is able to dissolve; ever holds up his Royal heart erect
and unshaken, when all Shebnaes, Hamans, and Ahitophels, would hide their
heads, and shrink in the wetting. Which conscience of his, if upon such
occasion He should unhappily wound; He knows full well, it would follow Him
with guilty cries, for his so base temporizing, and traitorous slinking, all
the days of his life. Whereas graceless and selfe-seeking greatness, can
well enough, in the mean time, conquer such clamorous accusations of an ill
conscience, with the boisterous excess of carnal contentments, even as the
Sacrificers of their Sons to M^loch in the fire, drowned their lamentable
cries, with the louder sound of Tabrets and Drums. Ambitious Nimrods, are
able by the inordinate heat after humane greatness, to digest, and drive away
the afterstings of bribery, baseness, if not close bloodshed (their ordinary
means of mounting) with their delight in domineering, and being adored above
others. It is a fit Passage therefore in our Common Prayer-Booke: That it may
please Thee to endue the Lords of the Counsel, and all the Nobility, with
grace, wisdom, and understanding. Grace is fitly put in the first place: For,
understanding and wisdom, without this heavenly Jewel, do but prepare their
Owners, to do the greater mischief; To oppress innocence with finer tricks,
and more unobservedly; to plague Opposites more plausibly; to compass their
own ends more exactly; and at last, for the abuse, and misimploiment of their
great Parts and Places, in serving themselves, and not seeking Gods glory, to
be damned more horribly. Without sanctification by special grace; the rarest
endowments All virtues turn to vices, when they become the servants of
impiety. King James Remonst. page 249.
degenerate: Wisdom into craft; O the vanity of great Men, who think it to
be the chief fruit of their greatness, to abuse their power insolently, to
the ruin of their inferiors! Not remembering (being blinded by their passion)
that they have a Superior over them, to make them yield an account of their
unjust proceedings, forcing to make restitution with interest. Histor. of
France. In Lewis the tenth.
Power into private revenge; Valor into violence; Prudence into plotting their
own ends; Courage into foole-hardinesse, to uphold a faction; Policy, into
plastering over soule-businesses with fair colors: All of them are basely,
and unworthily made subordinate, and serviceable, only to the setting forward,
and safe-garding their own outward felicity. Without this celestial
Loadstarre, to steer aright in all affairs, there will ever be some warping.
A great man, a Friend, an enemy, fear, cowardlinesse, affection, faction,
partiality, covetousness, malice, or something, will certainly sway, and
transport away. But now, a godly Man, besides his presence, Qui eateros
dignitate praestat and authoritate, debet maiori etiam pietate in Deum
effulgere, quo caeteris exemplosit, virtutem colendi and divina mandata
servandi. Cyr. Alexand. lib. 8. in Joan.
exemplary precedence in piety, and prayers, which are ever pleasing and
prevailing with God; the discharge of his Place with integrity and truth,
improving industriously all opportunities, high favors, interest in great
Ones, and utmost possibility every way to advance Gods glory, promote good
causes, protect good Men; He may also, by observing the calmnesse of a Royal
countenance, and openesse of a Princely ear unto Him, wisely and humbly
suggest some things, and speak those words for the public Good, and good of
religion, whereby not only a Kingdom, but the whole Christian World may fare
the better. Upon these, and the like grounds, I hold it an high happiness, and
great honor, to have an hand in working spiritual good upon those excellent
spirits, which hold high Rooms, or stand in near attendance unto mighty
Princes. And by this time, you easily discern my drift, and rightly apprehend
the top of my ambition in this Dedication: even to do your Soul good, Which
is much more Worth then the Whole World, and must never die. To which I
conceived a door opened; when it pleased you, in more then ordinary manner, to
manifest your liking, and allowance of my last Book. And therefore, Sir, I
beseech you, out of the generousnesse of your noble disposition, to do me that
f^vour; Nay, that right; Nay, that honor, for so I shall account it: As not to
conceive the least thought, that hereby I go about to seek great things to my
self; or ever to come nearer the Court, then by the continuance of my daily
heartiest prayers for the salvation, and life of King Charles, my dread and
dearest Sovereign. I am drawing apace toward my long Home, Eccles. 12.5.
and must shortly appear before that high and everlasting Judge; and therefore
I desire to lose no time, but to ply, all I can, the business God has set me
about, for the short remainder of these few and evil days; that by the
mercies of God, I may finish my course with joy; and give up that last, and
great account, with favor and comfort, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Me
thinks, besides many other, and mighty divine Motives, that one Parete ijs,

to make me the happy Instrument of helping you toward Heaven; and give me
leave to gain this advantage, for your spiritual good, by your love unto my

slippery Place, tho you stand in the presence of the mightiest Defender of the
true Religion, of any Monarch under Heaven. For although Satan be most
solicitous, and stirring in all Places, and now more then ever (the long Day of
Mankind drawing fast toward an evening; and the Worlds troubles, and time
near at an end) to do all the mischief, He can possibly; yet you may be
assured, He reserves his most desperate services, ambushments, surprises,
practices, and Powder-plots, for Kings Courts: Because He finds there, an
extraordinary Confi^ence of Greatness, Power, Wit, Policy, noblest Parts, and
other mighty engines; the edge and excellency whereof, if He shall be any
ways able, by improovement of the utmost skill, in his old Trade of tempting,
to turn the Wrong way; He gains far more, then if He should win to His
side some millions of private Men. If He prevails there, He knows himself
in a fair way, to make foul work; and is often wont thereupon, to empoison,
and plagve even a whole kingdom. For your support therefore, and surer
standing in such a Case; and that you may trample upon, with an holy contempt,
and noble disdain, the false, Delectatio occidit and praeterijt, vulneravit
and transivit, miserum fecit and abijt, infelicem reddidit and reliquit.

durelesse, pestilent sweetness of worldly pleasures, and vanishing glister of
all earthly glory; there is no way in the world, but to embrace the Lord Jesus,
in the arms of your ^umbled Soul, fallen out for ever Ista est filioli, vera
poenitentia, quando sic convertitur quis, ut non revertatur; quando sic
poenitet, ut non repetat. Ibid. Sermon. 3.
with every sin, and fallen in love unfainedly with all Gods blessed ways.
For by Faith, and Faith alone, (which how it is brought into the heart by the
Holy Ghost, you have in the Body of the Book) we overcome the world. And that
in all respects; Not only in regard of the furious enticements, and keen
baits of carnal delights, riches, and rising; but also, of comminations of
cruelty and torture; Nay, of the stinging provocations of contumelies, and
cruel mockings. May you please to take notice of the power, and property of it
this way; and in what manner this glorious Princess conquers, and sets her
triumphant foot upon the neck of the World, as upon Her vanquished Vassal,
in two or three passages. 1. First, While as yet the Soul, tho never so
admirably, and universally endowed with rarest illuminations of humane
wisdom, natural, moral, metaphysicall learning, and Mysteries of State, is
wholly gvided by the eyes of sense, and carnal reason; it looks upon the
world, and worldly things, as upon the only Paradise of sweetest contentments,
choicest pleasures, and chiefest Good; of the favor and fruition whereof, it
would rather be damned, then dispossessed: But upon the Kingdom of Christ, and
it is spiritual glory, as upon a thing not worthy searching into, and seeking
after; a sower, strict, and uncomfortable condition; fit only for some few
precise fools, and those, scorned, contemptible underlings; who understand not
the world, but want Wit, and Art, to grow rich, and rise; to render themselves
remarkable to the eyes of men, and greaten their posterity. But let that
glorious eye of Faith be once planted in the Soul, and the Case is quite
altered. Those former fading Lights of sense and reason, are obscured by the
presence of this heavenly Sun, and vanish, with all their vanities. For now
this new, beautiful Lamp, shining in the face of the Soul, does represent to
it is apprehension, the World, set out in greatest bravery, and to the utmost
worth, as worth Esto, delicieris, Esto, inebrieris; body and cr^s and annos
december and viginti and triginta, and quinquaginta, and centum etiam, quod est
impossible: imo f^voles, ponamus etiam quid ultra centum; Quid vero
lucraberis? Nibil. Chrysostom. in Epist. ad Philip. Sermon. 13.

Si quis divitum universum mundum possideret, totque scr^os haberet, qunt nunc
in ^rbe terrarum sunt homines, ac ubique terrarum aedes, civitates, gentes sua
ditione teneret, ^ontes ac fluuiy auro sibi pro aqua fluerent; tribus certe
obolis huiusmodi hominem, una cum divitijs suis, nisi ad columasp^^aret, dignum
non duceremus. Idem. In Mat. Hom. 64.


nothing; as a dead rotten Carrion, a very Dunghill, full of all loathsomenesse,
deformity and filth. Which heated by the fire of men's furious lusts, sends up
continually such fumes of vanity, and he lish Mists; which unhappily hide their
sight from any glimpse at all, of all that incomparable beauty, which shines
in the countenance of Christ; or glory of the joys above, which last
eternally. But it now looks upon the Kingdom of grace, as upon a Rock of
Diamonds, or Crystal Mountain thick beset, and glistering full fair with
variety of richest Pearls, and truly orient; I mean, as upon the most
amiable, and admirable Object under the Sun; as the best, and blessedest
thing to be loved, and looked after in this life. 2. Secondly, Every man is
naturally, and notoriously greedy of hearts-ease, and joy in one kind or
other: of which, rather then they will miss, they do not stick, many times,
to light a candle at the Devil himself, for some joviall lightsom-nesse and
mirth, such as it is; a madness above admiration, and followed with infinite
miseries. And therefore, until they lay certainly hold upon, and really
possess something more precious, surer comforts, sounder joys, which may
out-balance the weight of all wordly treasures, and overtop the height of all
humane happinesses, both in excellency and sweetness; they will by no means,
upon no terms, suffer their hearts to be drawn, and divorced from possession
of the present, and the Bird in hand, as they say; I mean, from that poor,
little, lean, imaginary nothing of contentment; which they seem to extract,
with much ado, and most certain loss of eternal bliss, from earthly
things. They will, in the mean time, stick to the world as fast, as
Pherecides the Athenian, to the ship; who held it on the shore with his hands;
and one of them cut off, He held it with the other; and both being cut off,
He held it with His teeth. But let once the weary Souls of these former
Worldings, truly wounded, and broken in pieces with weight of sin, and sense
of wrath; lean upon, and lay down themselves in the bosom of the Lord Jesus,
bleeding upon the Cross, prizing his purity as well, as His Passion; and so
taking Him upon And how that is learned, Chemnicius tells us: Ordo divinus est,
quod vult quidem Evangelizare, sed pauperibus; vult sanare sed centritos; vult
praedicare dimissionem, sed captivis; Vult educere and liberare, sed vinctos,
hoc est, sub peccato conclusos; Vult consolari, sed contristatos, and lugentes;
Vult respicere sed ad contritum spiritu: Beneplacitum est Domino, sed super
timentes eum, and in eis, quisperant super misericordia eius; Vult reficere,
sed laborantes and oneratos; Vult coronare misericordia and miserationibus, sed
caput humiliatum, non turgidum; Vult infundere oleum misericordiae, sed
vulneratis, etc. Exam. Decr. Trident. p. 2. De Contrit. cap. 4.
Gods terms: And then reflecting with a sensible and serious contemplation,
upon that Pearl of great price, of which they now stand possessed; by the worth
whereof, they have sealed, and made sure unto them, a full discharge from the
endlesnesse of Hellish torments, and a most undoubted right to eternity of
Heavenly joys; Nay, possession given them of the thrice glorious, and
ever-blessed Deity, and all His perfections, excellencies, felicities, so
far as an infinite Godhead is conceiveable, and a Creature capable: I say,
then, and never before, will they easily, and willingly leave their Hold-fast
of the World, and be content for ever after to settle their dearest love,
seek their truest Hilaritatis nostrae omnis rivulus defonte ducendus pietatu;

frequenter, and currit familiariter per plateas coelest^^ Jerusalem, visitando
Patriarchas, and Prophetas, salutando Apostolot, admirando exercitus Martyrum
and Confessorum, etc. August. Tom. 9. p. 2. page 1003.
above. 3. Thirdly, Faith has many precious Effects: It justifies, pacifies,
purifies, mortifies, rectifies in all troublesome turnings of our life, and
also satisfies the heart. As the Soul of Man is immortal by nature; so it is
immeasurable in it is appetite and aspirations, edged with an infinite desire.
The boundless capacity whereof, can never be filled, until it apprehend, and
enjoy as it is own, an object infinite, as well in eminency of good, as
durability of time. And therefore except Faith, by bringing the Lord Christ
into the Soul, give us the infinite God himself, and make Him our Portion, the
Cor humanum in desiderio aeternitatis non fixum, nunquam stabile potest esse;
sed omni volubilitate volubilius, de alio in aliud transit, quaerens requiem,
ubi non est. In his autem caducis and transitorijs, in quibus eius affectus
captivi tenentur, veram requiem invenire non valet; quoniam est tantae
dignitatis, ut nullum Bonum, praeter summum Bonum eisusficere possit. Ibid.

Cum obiectum intellectus sit omne ens, nunquam eius capacitas explebitur, ac
proinde ad ultimam persectionem non perveniet, done^ apprehendatur omne ens:

heart of Man never will, or can possibly be satisfied in this World, or the
World to come. But here be tossed continually, and torn in pieces, like the
raging Sea, with restless distractions, carking, discontent: And hereafter
roar everlastingly in Hell with unknown horrors; and for the irrevocable
exclusion, from the supreme and sovereign Good, the ever-springing Fountain of
all peace and pleasure, and His glorious presence even for ever and ever. If
the Soul of man, says Lib. 1. Sect. 12.
Hooker, did serve only to give Him Being in this life, then things
appertaining unto this life would content Him, as we see they do other
Creatures: Which Creatures inioying what they live by, seek no further; but in
this contentation do show a kind of acknowledgement, that there is no higher
Good, which do any way belong unto them. With us it is otherwise. For although
the beauties, riches, honors, sciences, virtues, and perfections of all men
living, were in the present possession of One: yet somewhat beyond, and above
all this, would still be sought, and earnestly thirsted for. It is no marvel,
says Quid in hoc mundo stabile? Quid firmum? Quid porro non breve and
incertum, and c^sui non serviens? Quale istud bon^m est, quod semper timeas
amittere? Quod vel auferendum a^s te metuas, vel a te relinqueadum scias. Nam
etsi nullo eripiatur casu, vel morte certe perdendum est. Et si vita nostra
tendatur per mill annos, and ad extremum illum totius diem aetatis, quotidiana
voluptate veniamus; quale hoc quaeso Diu est, quod sine deletur? Aut quis
illius voluptatis structus est, qui statim ut cessaverit, videbitur tibi no^
fuisse? Age iam, transactum vitae tuae tempus animo revolve. Nonne videbitur
tibi umbra quaedam fuisso, quod transijt, and instar somny tenuis incertum esse
omne, quod videtur? Hoc idem and decrepitus senex sentire potest: Cui convenit
dicere cum Propheta, Dies mei sicut umbra declinaverunt, and ego sicut foenum
arui. Quod si baec etiam hic possumus dicere, ubi quamvis brevis, tamen quia
praesens est, vita ista magni penditur; Quid in futuro dicturi sumus, ubi
maiori aetatis scientia, transactum omne pro nihilo est. Haec tu tecum
diligenter revolvens, and brevitatem vitae huius aeternitatis contemplatione
despiciens, ipsum quoque contemptum mundi maiori cum virtute contemn; Et ad
illum tantu^ diem para te, in quo mundi gloria finienda est. Aug. Epist. 142.
Green^ham, if riches fill not the Soul, for they were all made for man, His
Soul for God. Whatsoever is capable of God, that can never be satisfied with
any thing else: All riches, all preferments can not satisfy one soul: But
when God is come, it is full and whatsoever is added more, it runs over.
These, and the like, are the mighty Works of Faith. And even so let this
Princely, and victorious Grace, attended with all Her heavenly train, tread
down triumphantly before you still, the painted Bables and Babels of al
transitory glory, and ungodly greatness; hold still fresh and flourishing in
your ^ie, the immortality and bliss of a never-fading Crown; and shine fair
and fruitfully in your Soul; until it set you down safe, in the midst of the
most glorious and ever-during Kingdom of Heaven; and having there finished her
blessed Task, resign you up, and leave you for ever, to the Beatificall
vision, and full fruition of Jehovah, everlastingly blessed; and to the
endless enioyment of fullness of joy and pleasures, at His right hand, even
through all eternity.

in a sacred Cabinet of richest Jewels; I mean the most selected, and wisest
Aphorisms, or Proverbs, that ever issued out of mortal brain: Every one of
them, for the most part, especially from the tenth Chapter, independent,
entire, and absolute in themselves; clear and manifest by their own native
brightness; not needing such reciprocal light, and luster for each others
mutual discovery, and interpretation. And therefore they are naturally not
capable of any coherent Logical Analysis, and other circumstantiall
expositions, ordinarily incident to other parts of Scripture. Whence it is,
that this Book of Proverbs is compared to a great heap of gold rings, rich,
and orient, severally; and every one shining with a distinct sense by it self:
but other contexts of holy Writ, to gould*chaines so interwoven and enlinked
together, that they must upon necessity, for the rendering unto us aright, and
fully their several senses, be illightened and receive mutual illustration,
one from another.

This present Proverb does represent unto us the extremest Hell upon earth,
the greatest misery, and most un-supportable that can possibly befall a Man in
this life; I mean the horror of a guilty and enraged conscience. Which is set
out;

First, by the excellency of it is opposite; the invincible ability and mighty
strength of that truly stout and heroical heart, which is happily upholden
with the heavenly refreshing influence of grace, Gods favor and a good
conscience: The spirit of a man will sustain his ^firmity: Whence take this
first note.

of Gods favor, is able to pass through the pikes, and conquer all comers.

2. When the heavenly beams of Gods pleased countenance begin to break out
upon a man, through the dark and Hellish mist of his manifold and heinous
sins, the unquenchable heat of His everlasting love through Christ dissolving
them into nothing; and fairly shine with a comfortable aspect upon His humbled
Soul; ipso facto, as they say, Heaven and Earth* and all the Hosts of both are
everlastingly reconciled unto him, and become his friends; the storms and
tempests raised by all the powers of Hell are presently calmed for ever doing
him any deadly hurt. All the creatures then, pull in their horns, retire their
stings, bite in their poison, s^ib'd, and awed by those divine impressions of
their Creators blessed image stamped upon them by the Spirit of grace; and dare
no more offer any violence or vexation to him, (except upon particular
dispensation for his spiritual good and quickening) then to the Apple of Gods
own eye. Hear the promise from Gods own mouth: And in that day I will make a
covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of Heaven,
and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow, and the
sword, and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down
safely, Hos. 2.18. Nay, they are so far from charging their several stings
upon the Saints, that they will change their very natures, to do them service.
They will rather become an astonishment and horror to the whole Creation, then
they be hurt. How often have they suspended and put off their native power, and
properties, for the protection and good of Gods people? The very Sea, that most
raging and roaring creature, must stay his course and current, to give passage
and preservation to a true Israelite: The Stars must fight, and the Sun
stand still for the aid and advantage of Gods armies. The Lions must leave
their savage rage and trade of blood, and become Lambs and loving unto a
Daniel. The Crows will feed an Elijah: The flames of fire must hold in their
heat, from burning a Shadrach, Meshach or Abednego: The devouring belly of a
dreadful fish must be turned into a Sanctuary of safty to a Jonah: A popish
Furnace heated with the very malice of Hell shall become a bed of down and
Roses to a Thus spoke blessed Bainbam in the midst of the fire. O ye Papists
behold, ye look for miracles; and here now you may see a miracle: for in this
fire I feel no no more pain, then if I were in a bed of Down; but it is to
me as sweet as a bed of Roses. Acts and Monuments page 1030.
Martyr of Jesus: The very dead lines of an ordinary His Majesty was moved to
interpret and conster the latter sentence in the Letter (alleged by the Earl
of Salisbury) against all ordinary sense and construction in Grammar, as if by
these words, For the danger is past as soon as you have burned the Letter,
should be closely understood the suddainty and quickenesse of the danger, which
should be as quickly performed, and at an end as that paper should be of
blazing up in the fire; turning that word of as soon, to the sense of, as
quickly. Discourse of the manner of the discovery of a late intended Treason,
etc. Hear King James his own words. I did upon the instant interpret and
apprehend some dark phrases in the Letter contrary to the ordinary grammar
construction of them, (and in another sort then I am sure any Divine or Lawyer
in any University would have taken them) to be meant of this horrible for me
of blowing us up all by Powder. His Majesty's speech in the last Session of
Parliament, printed 1605.
Letter, must represent to a Royal conceit, a meaning quite contrary to the
natural sense and all Grammatical construction, before a blessed Parliament
be blown up with Popish Gunpowder: A brittle A virtuous Gentlewoman in this
Land doubting very often of her Salvation, made her case known unto a worthy
Minister of God; who often counseled her, to take heed of inquiries further
then Gods word, and trust assuredly that she might conclude her Salvation out
of Gods word, without any further revelations: yet still did the temptation
grow upon her, in so much that having a Venice Glass in her hand, and the
selfsame Minister sitting by her, presently breaks forth into lamentable
words; you have often told me, that I must seek no further then Gods word, but
I have bin long without comfort and can endure no longer: Therefore it I must
be saved, let this glass be kept from breaking, and so she threw it against
the walls. Here might the Lords hand for this tempting of his Majesty, have
left her to the everlasting woes of her distrustful heart: yet the Lord that
is rich in mercy, having stamped her with the seal of his Election, was
content to satisfy the languishing Soul with a miracle: the Glass rebounds
again, and comes safe unto the ground; which the Minister having gotten into
his hands; faith, Oh repent of this sin, bless God for his mercy, and never
distrust him more of his promise: for now you have His voice from Heaven in a
miracle, telling you plainly of your estate. This was curiosity, and might
have brought despair; yet it was the Lords mercy to remit the fault, and grant
extraordinary confirmation of her Faith. Yates. Gods arraignement of
Hypocrites, page. 357.
Glass must rebound unbroken from the hardest stone, to help to bind up a
broken heart, bleeding with grief, for absence of her Spouse, and wan^ of the
assurance of his love, etc. Nay the devil himself, though he walks about
like a roaring Lion seeking with restless rage, and desiring infinitely to
devour the Lords inheritance, yet cannot possibly add one link to the
chain, in which by the merciful and mighty hand of God, he is hampered; nor
go an hairs breadth beyond his commission: Though it be utterly impossible,
that that damned Angel should so far change his divellish nature, as to do
any of Gods chosen, directly, any true good; yet he is everlastingly musled by
an Almighty arm, from ever doing them any deadly hurt. He may be suffered
sometimes to shake his chain at them, and roar upon them hideously, to drive
them nearer unto God, and fright them from sin; But he shall never either in
this world, or the world to come have his full swinge at them, or fasten his
hellish fangs upon their redeemed souls.

most precious, and almost, if not altogether omnipotent Grace of Prayer. This
great Master of miracles has wrought from time to time many and very
remarkable wonders both in Heaven and Earth. It made the Sun, that mighty
creature, Ios. 10.12, 13.

sudden, in the heat of his swiftest course: Ion. 2.1, etc. 10.

It turned the Heaven into brass for three years and a half; Iam. 5.17, 18.
and afterward turned the selfsame brass into fruitful clouds, and
fountains of rain: 2. Kings 19.15.35.
It killed an hundred fourscore and five thousand of the enemies of Gods
people in one night: For the freeing of Elisha from a strait and dangerous
siege, 2. Kings 6.17.

men, endowed with an extraordinary spirit.

to all generations of the Church to the Worlds end, the Almighty and
wonder-working power of Prayer. And I am as sure, that the Petitioners were men

Nathanael, since thy new birth, thou wast never so extraordinarily passionate,
as Jonah was, when out of a pang of strange distemper, he thus answered the
mighty Lord of Heaven and Earth: Jonah 4 9.
I do well to be angry even unto death.

Fourthly, Gods Favorite is further furnished with an other spiritual weapon
of impregnable temper, and incredible might. I mean Faith, Faith is only able
to perform; fullness of joy, and constancy of content, in the midst of the
changes, wanes, eclipses and fuls of all external things; and that one day, as
well as another, throughout the course of a man's life in that latitude and
extent, whereof this life is capable. Ward.

Father of li^hts, and flowing as it were more immediately and sweetly from his
blessed face, is of such a divine invincible, and lightsome temper, and has
such an anti-patheticall vigor and ability, against all spiritual darkness
and dampes; whether of affliction, temptation, troublesome confusions of the
times, the valley of the shadow of death, the Grave, Hell it self; that it is
ever able, either to dispell it, or dissolve it, or support it self strongly
and triumphantly even in the midst of it. Suppose a soul beautified with
Grace, to be seated, if it were possible, in the very center of that hellish
Kingdom, yet would it, by its Heavenly strength, and glory, in despite of all
infernal powers keep off at some distance all the darkness, torments and
horror of that damned place. Whence it is, that it is so often in the holy
Scriptures compared to light. Now what power and prevalent antipathy our
ordinary light does exercise against his most abhorred Opposite, darkness,
you well know, and it is elegantly and punctually for my purpose expressed by
One in this manner: We see, and prove, says he, by daily experience how
powerful and dreadful a thing the darkness of the night is. For when it
falls, it covers, and muffleth up the face of the whole world. It
obscureth, and hides, the hue, and the fashion of all creatures: It binds up
all hands, and breaks off all employments: The night comes, says our
Savior, wherein we cannot work. It arresteth, and keeps captive all living
wights, men and beasts, that they must be still, and rest there where it
arresteth them: yea it makes them fearful, and faint-hearted, full of
fancies, and much subject to frights. It is of all others such a powerful, and
unconquerable Tyrant, as no man is able to withstand. And yet nevertheless, it
is not of that might, that it is able to overwhelme, or to quench the least
light in the World. For we see the darken the night is, the clearer the Stars
shine: Yea the least candles light, that is lighted, withstandeth the whole
night, and not only suffers not the darkness to cover, or to smoother, and
oppress it, but it gives light also even in the midst of the darkness,
and beats it back for some space and distance on every side of it: so that
which way soever it is borne, or wheresoever it comes, there must darkness
depart and give place unto the light; all the power, and the dreadfulnesse of
it, cannot help or prevail ought against it. And tho the light be so weak,
that it cannot cast light far about, or drive the darkness far from it,
as in the spark of an hot coal, yet cannot the darkness cover or conceal,
and much less quench it; but it gives light to it self alone at least; so
that it may be seen a far off in the dark; and it remains unconquered of
the dark, tho it cannot help other things nor give light unto them. Yea (that
which is yet more wonderful) a rotten shining piece of wood, which h^th the
faintest light that can be found, yet remains invincible of all the power of
darkness; and the more it is compassed about with darken^sse, the clearer
light it gives. So little is darkness able to overcome, or k^epe down an^
light; but that it rules and vanquisheth, and expels the dark^n^ss^, which
else overwhelmeth, and ^^areth, and fettereth* and puts all things in fear.
Now if this natural light be so pow^^full, and so able to prevail against the
darkness of the night: why should not that spiritual Light, that Gods Spirit
does kindle, and set up in the hearts of Gods Children, be able to afford them
light in darkness, and to minister sound joy and sweet comfort unto them, in
the very midst of their heaviest, and most hideous afflictions. Assuredly, it
must needs be unconquerably able, with far greater power, and in an higher
proportion. For our visible light does spring but from a finite and material
Fountain, the Sun, it self a creature: but the Spiritual light, I speak
of, flows immediately from the glorious face of the only true,
incomprehensible and eternal (...) 1. Ioh. 2.5.
Light, the Suns creator, who dwells in the light that no man can approach
unto, and is an everlasting wellspring of all Life and Light; which it does so
far represent and resemble in Divine excellency, and mightiness, that it
thence receives by a secret and sacred influence, fresh successions still of an
infinite triumphant power, and prevailing against all spiritual darkenesses
for ever. Suppose all the men that dwell within the compass of our Hemisphere
should address themselves with all their wit and weapons, with all their power
and policy to keep back that universal darkness, which is wont to seize
upon the face of the earth at the setting of the Sun; yet by all this strong
and combined opposition, they should but beat the air: But now, upon the very
first approach of that Princely light, but peeping up in the East, it would all
^ly away in a Lux cito coelum, terras, maria illuminat, and momento temporis
sine ulla comprehensione, relectis surgentis diei splendore regionibus, nostro
se circumsundit aspectui. Ambros. H^x. Lib. 1. Cap. ^.
moment, and vanish into nothing. Semblablely, if all the understandings upon
earth, and all the Angels in Heaven should contribute all their abilities, and
excellencies to illighten with cheerfulness and joy, a guilty conscience
surprised sometimes with hellish darkness and clouds of horror upon sight
of sin, and sense of divine wrath; yet all would not do, they should all the
while, but wash a Blackamoore, as they say: but now, let but the least glimpse
of the light of Grace shine into that sad and heavy Soul, and it would far
more easily and irresistably chase away the very darkest midnight of any
spiritual misery, then the strongest Summers Sun, the ^hinnest Mornings
mist. Give me, if you will, Judas his heart, or Spiraes horror; or a vexed
spirit torn and rent in pieces with the raging guilt of both those woeful men;
and let that supposed rufull Soul, weary of its hellish burden, and thirsting
sincerely for the water of Life, but cast it self upon the mercy, truth, and
power of the Lord Jesus, so sweetly offering himself in that precious promise,
Matthew. 11.28. resolving to take him for an everlasting husband; and ipso facto,
as they say, it might be put into a very Heaven upon Earth. For this glorious
grace of Faith, the Prince of all spiritual light and lightsomnesse in the
truly humbled Soul, thus shed into such a dark and grieved spirit, does
enkindle and set on shining all those Fides est in Christiana anima fandamentum

The point appears, and is further prooved by manifest, and manifold
experience: David having bin formerly, woefully wasted with great variety and
extremity of dangers and distresses, was at last plunged into a most desperate
perplexity. 1. Sam. 30 6. Which had bin able to have swallowed up into
despair, the manliest vigor of the greatest spirit upon earth, not supported
with grace. (The like or a less, caused King Saul to fall upon his own
sword;) yet He blessed man, by the power of his spiritual peace, and the
beams of Gods pleased face-shining upon his Soul, did patiently, and sweetly
comfort Himself in the Lord His God; and stood like an impregnable Rock
unshaken with the raging assaults of any tempestuous sourges. He was at this
time hunted by Saul like a Par^ridge in the Mountains; cashierd by the Princes
of the Philistines as a f^llow of suspected fidelity; robbed by the Amalekites of
His wives; His sons, and His daughters; The Town, to which He returned for
safety, was burnt with fire; And to make his calamity complete, and most
cutting, even His own men were ready to stone Him: Now in this great distress
upon the first apprehension whereof He wept, as the story says, until He had
no more power to weep; yet coming to Himself, and recollecting His
spiritual forces, His heavy heart ready to sink and fall asunder in His
bosom, did fetch by the hand of faith, comfortably fortified by sense and
experience of former favors, such heavenly strength from Iehova, whom He had
made His portion; that thereupon His courage was revived and raised to that
height, that He presently pursued his enemies with extraordinary valor and
resolution, cut them off quite and recovered all. And David says the text, was
greatly distressed: for the people spoke of stoning Him, because the Soul of
all the people was grieved, every man for His sons, and for His daughters:
but David encouraged Himself in the Lord his God, etc.

What a bitter Sea of unmatched miseries, did break out upon blessed Job,
which with a sudden unexpected violence, bearing down that Hedge of
protection, which God had set about Him, (the raines purposely let loose by
divine dispensation to Satan's malice in the mean time) did fearfully
overflow him to that height and horror; that He stands registered in Gods Book
as an unparalled Instance of extraordinary sufferings and sorrows; calamities
and conflicts; to all succeeding ages, no Nemo quisquam in ulla Historia tot

day; As poor as Job: Many wives are passionate, and peevish in time of

confess, is wont to roar and rage fiercely enough about Gods blessed O^es,

reach, and his chain so lengthned as he had against Job. The painful anguish
of some one part* would not only deprive a Man, of the pleasure of the worlds

Satan's extremest malice* who had power given Him to inflict them God himself

seldom does he set them up for His Mark; hunt them as a fierce Lion; set His
terrors in array against them; and command the poison of his arrows to drink
up their spirit; as Job complains: It is no strange thing, neither should it
much moove, but only make us walk more watchfully, to hear men of the world,
and drunken Belialls to belch out from their rotten hearts upon the Alebench
such base slanders as these. These Professors for all their fair shows, are
certainly all of them notorious Hypocrites. Tho they look never so demurely,
they are not the men they are taken for, etc. But to have a Man's nearest,
familiar, understanding Christian friends to charge Him with Hypocrisy, is a
most cruel cut to a troubled conscience: And this was Intimi fuerunt Iobi

hoard of grace, which his heavenly heart had treasured up in the time of
prosperity; out of that spiritual strength, which He had gotten into His
soul by his former humble acquaintance, and conversation with His God, and
knowing full well, that tho all was gone, yet He still possessed Jesus Christ
as fully, if not more feeli^gly as ever before; He becomes hereupon as rare and
admir^ble a Pattern of Patience to all posterity; as He was an extraordinary

But now on the other side, the tyth nay the ten hundredth part of Jobs
troubles, caused gra^elesse Achitophell, to saddle his Ass, get himself home,
put his household in order, and hang himself.

So true is that which the blessed Prophet tells us Ier. 17.5. etc. Cursed be
the man, that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart
departs from the Lord. For He shall be like the heath in the desert, and
shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the
Wilderness, in a saltland and not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusts
in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be as a tree planted by
the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not see
when heat comes, but her lease shall be green, and shall not be careful in
the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.

This impregnable comfort springing from grace, and a good conscience, even in
evil times, did steel the spirit of blessed Luther with such spiritual
stoutnesse, and so hardened his fore head against a world, Ezekiel. 3.9.

nay an horrible hell of most reproachful and raging oppositions, that he
became a Spectacle, a Miracle of rarest Christian fortitude, and invincible
courage to the whole world, and to all posterity. I am persuaded, that holy
truth of God, which he so gloriously pro^est, and that power of godliness,
which he so faithfully practiced, did infuse into the heart of that Man as
much unconquerablenesse of resolution, and fearelesnesse of the face of Man, as
ever dwelt in any mortal breast, since the Apostles time. Witness amongst the
rest, that one extraordinary expression of His imcomparable magnanimity: when
his friends were earnest, and eager upon Him, not to venture Himself, amongst
a number of Perfidious Papists, and bloodthirsty Tigers; He replied thus: As
touching me, says He, Fox in the story of Martin Luther, page 849.
since I am sent for, I am resolved, and certainly determined to enter Worms
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; yea tho I knew, there were as many
Devils to resist me, as there are tiles to cover the Houses in Worms. This
Man of God did upon the two Pillars of His Heroical heart, courage and
patience, most nobly sustain the malice and hatred, almost of the whole world.
The Devil, and the Pope did concurrently countermine with all their cruelty,
and cunning against this victorious Champion of Heaven, and mighty underminer
of their dark and damned kingdoms. Almost all the Princes, Priests, and
people of Christendom, did breed and breathe out nothing but thoughts of
indignation and threats of Death against Him. Millions of lasie, and lustful
Monks, having like so many pestilent Locusts of the infernal Pit, seizd upon
the face of Europe, with their envenomed swarms, and lying at ease
encloistered in Sodomy and blood, gnashed their teeth at Him with Hellish fury,
and like true Friends spet fire in His face. And yet for all this, this holy
Saint, (which, I more admire, and prize higher, then the victories of a
thousand Caesar's, or the most renowned valor of the greatest Alexander) having
so many incarnate Devils continually roaring about Him, with open mouth, ready
every hour, and enraged with implacable thirst to drink up His blood, and
swallow Him up quick; yet I say, enjoyed such a triumphant tranquillity of
mind, and unshaken presence of spirit, that like a mighty Son of thunder by
His constant and powerful preaching, for the space of nine and twenty years,
so shook the pillars of Popery, that I am persuaded the Beast will never stand
upon His four legs any more: And writ eloquently and excellently, almost, if
not as many volumes, as Austin did, that great glory of the Christian World in

that infamous (...) of the blessed Truth, which He formerly professed, became a
spectacle of such spiritual misery and woe to the whole world, that there is
not any thing left unto the memory of man more remarkable.

Upon the very first revise of his recantation, and ser^ou^ consideration in
cold blood what he had done, he acknowledged himself utterly undone and for
ever. His spirit suddenly smitten with the dreadful sense of divine wrath for
his Apostasy, and split in pieces, as it were, with so grievous a bruise,
fainted fearfully, faild him quite, and fell a sunder in his breast like drops
of water. Hear some rufull expressions of his desperate state, from his own
mouth: Oh, that I were gone from hence, that some body would let out this weary
Soul! I tell you there was never such a Monster as I am; never was man alive a
spectacle of such exceeding misery. -- I now feel Gods heavy wrath that burns
like the torments of hell within me, and afflicts my soul with pangs
un-utterable. Verily desperation is Hell it self. -- The gnawing worm of
unquenchable fire, horror, confusion, and which is worst of all, desperation
it self, continually tortures me. And now I count my present estate worse,
then if my soul separated from my body were with Judas, and therefore I desire
rather to be there, then thus to live in my body. -- The truth is, never had
mortal man such experience of Gods anger and hatred against him as I have. --
If I could conceive but the ^east spark o^ hope in my heart of a better state
hereafter, I would not refuse to endure the most heavy wrath of the great God,
yea for 2000. years, so that at length. I might attain out of misery. -- He
professed that his pangs were such, as that the damned wights in Hell endure
not the like misery: That his state was worse then that of Cain and Judas, and
therefore desired to die. -- O that God would let loose his hand from me, and
that it were with me now, as in times past, I would scorn the threats of the
most cruel Tyrants, bear torments with invincible resolution, and glory in
the outward profession of Christ, till I were choked in the flame, and my body
turned into ashes.

Uses. 1. If it be so then, that an heavenly hoard of grace, good conscience,
Gods favor etc. happily treasured up while it is called Today, has the sole,
and sacred property, and privilege, to hold up our hearts, In times of
horror: inabling us in the mean time patiently, and profitably to master all
miseries, pass through all persecutions, conquer all Comers; and at length by
the help of God, to pull the very heart, as it were, out of Hell; with
confidence, and triumph to look even death, and the Devil in the face, and to
stand with boldness, before the terror of the last Day, like an unmooveable
Rock, when the Sons and daughters of confusion, who have slept in harvest,
and misspent the gracious Day of their visitation, shall entreat the
mountains, and Rocks to fall upon them: I say, it being thus, let every one
of us like Sons and daughters of wisdom, in this short Summers Day of our
abode upon earth, and in this glorious Sunshine of the Gospel, and precious
seasons of grace, employ all means, improove all oportunities, to gather in,
with all holy greediness, and treasure up abundantly much spiritual strength,
and lasting comfort against the evil Day. To which, let us be quickened, by
such considerations as these:

1. This wise, and happy treasuring up, of heavenly hoards, and comforts of
holiness before hand, will sweetly mollisie, and allay the bitterness, and
smart, of that heaviness and sorrow; of those fearful amazements, and
oppressions of spirit, naturally incident to times of trouble, and fear, which
ordinarily do very grievously sting, and strike through the hearts of carnal
and secure Worldlings, with full rage, and the very slashes, and fore-tastes of
Hell. Of all other passions of the Soul, sadness, and grief grates most upon
the vital spirits; dries up soonest the freshest marrow in the bones; and most
sensibly suckes out the purest, and refinedst blood in the heart. All the
Objects of lightsomnesse, and joy, are drowned in an heavy heart, even as the
beauty of a Pearl is dissolved in vinegar. Now the only Cordial, and
Counter-poyson against this dampe of light-heartednesse, and Cut-throate of
life, is the secret sweetness, and shining pleasure of that One pearls of
great price; Math. 13.46.
three orient rays whereof, are righteousness and peace, Math. 13.46. Romans
14.17.
and joy in the holy Ghost treasured up in the Cabinet of a good conscience.
The glory, Math. 13.44.
pretiousnesse, and power of which hidden treasure, purchased with the sale of
all sin, does many times shine faireliest upon the Soul, in the saddest
times; inspires for the most part into the hearts of the owners, the greatest
courage, and constancy of spirit even in the days of adversity, and vexation;
inables them to digest, and bear without any great wound* or passion those
crosses, and cruelties, which would break the back, and crush the heart of
the stoutest Temporizer. Was there not a great deal of difference think you,
Isa 38.
betwixt the heart of Hezekiah, who had walked before God in truth, and with a
perfect heart, when He heard the news of death from the mouth of the Prophet;
Dan. 5.
and the heart of Belshazzar, when he saw the handwriting upon the wall. Give
me a great man, who carries a way, the credit and current of the times; with
all bravery, and triumph wallowes, and tumbles himself in the glory and
pleasures of the present: Throw Him from the transitory top of His heaven upon
earth, upon His last bed: present unto His eye at once the terrible pa^gs of
approaching death; the ragefull malice of the powers of Hell; the crying wounds
of His bleding conscience; the griesely fourmes of His innumerable sins; His
final farewell with all worldly delights; the pit of fire and brimstone, into
which He is ready to fall: And I tell you true, I would not endure an hours
horror of His woeful heart, for His present Paradise to the worlds end. But on
the other side, let me be the man, whom the corruptions of the time confine to
obscurity, who mournes in secret for the horrible abominations, and crying
sins, that reign amongst us, who thinks that day best spent, wherein He
has gathered most spiritual strength, against that last, and sorest combat;
and by the mercies of God, and humble dependence upon His omnipotent arm, I
will look in the face, the cruellest concurrence of all those former terrors,
with ^^^fidence and peace.

2. Secondly, By this spiritual hoarding of comfortable provision against the
Evil day, we may prevent a great deal of impatiency, dependence upon the Arm
of flesh, base fears, sinkings of heart; un-manly deiections of spirit,
desperate resolutions, and many passionate distempers of such raging and
distracted nature, which are wont to seize upon, and surprise, unholy and
unprepared hearts, when the Hand of God is heavy upon them. How bravely and
Heroically did patient Job bear and break through, a matchless variety and
extremity of calamities and conflicts? The softest of whose sufferings would
have struck full cold to the heart of many a Carnalist, and made it to dye
within Him like a stone as Nabals did. One of the least, the loss of His
goods, I am persuaded, would have caused many covetous worldlings to have laid
violent and bloody hands upon themselves. For instance: Ahitophel, only
because the glory of his state-wisedome was obscured, and overtopt at the
counsell-Bord, sadled His Ass, gate Him Home, put His household in order, and
hanged Himself. The only cause of His fainting in the day of disgrace, and
dis-acceptation was His false, and rotten heart in matters of religion. While
the Crown sat with security, and safety upon David's head; He walked with Him
as a companion unto the House of God. But when the wind begun to blow a little
another way and upon Absoloms side, like a true Temporizer. He follows the
blast, and turns his sails according to the weather. And therefore His hollow
heart, having made the Arm of flesh His Anchor, and a vanishing Blase of
honor His chiefest blessedness, shrinkes at the very first sight, and
suspicion of a tempest, and sinkes this miserable Man into a Sea of horror.
But now on the contrary: what was the cause, that Jobs heart was not crushed
into pieces, under the bitter concurrence of such a world of crosses, of which
any one severally was sufficient to have made a Man extremely miserable? The
true reason of His patient resolution, amid so many pressures, was the
spiritual riches* He had hoarded up in the time of His happiness. Amongst which
the divinest, and dearest Jewel lay nearest unto His heart, as a counterpoyson,
to the venom and sting of the Devils deadliest malice. I mean a sound and
strong faith in Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world:
which now began to shine the fairest in the darkest Midnight of His miseries;
and sweetly to dart out many heavenly sparkles of comfort, and such glorious
eiaculations as these: Though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him. Cap. 13.15.
And that cap. 19* 23, etc. Oh that my words were now written, oh that they were
printed in a Book! That they were graven with an iron pen, and lead, in the
rock for ever. For I know that my Redeemer lives, etc.

There were two cutting, and cruel circumstances largely insinuated Cap. 29.
and 30. which did keenely sharpen the edge, and mightily aggravate the weight
of Jobs miseries:

The one was this: He had bin Cap. 29.6. etc.
happy. Now as that man's happiness is holden the greatest, who has bin in
miserable condition; for He tastes the double sweet; of remembering his
forpassed misery; and enjoying his present felicity: Felicem fuisse, miserrimum.
So on the contrary; It is the greatest misery, they say, to have bin happy.

The other was that, which most nettles a generous nature. He being a Man of so
great honor and worth; whose rare, and incomparable wisdom, even the Princes
and Nobles adored as it were with a secret, and silent admiration, as appears
Cap. 29.9.10. was now contemned of the most contemptible. The children of
fools, and the children of base men; that were viler then the earth, make him
their song, and their Byword, cap. 30.8.9. For when true noblenes, and worth
is down, and any one of the Lords Champions dejected, it is ordinary with all
those dunghill dispositions, to whom His sincerity was an Eie-sore; His power
and authority, a restraint to their lewdness; the glory of His virtues, fuel
to their envy; to run as a Raven to the fallen Sheep, to pick out His eyes; I
mean, which yet ^asts of a truly cowardly, and merciless constitution, to
wound his very wounds, and to vex his vexations. This was Jobs case.

But what now ministers comfort to Jobs heart, against these corrosiues? Even
consciousnesse of His graces, and integrities treasured up, and exercisde in
the days of His peace. He reckens up fourteen of them, Chap. 31. From
consideration hereof, He gathers toward the end, this triumphant resolution
against the ^orest of His sufferings: I would even crown mine head with the
bitterest Invective of my greatest adversary: whence it is clear, that the two
potent pillars of Jobs ^^rong, and strange patience, which all generations will
admire to the worlds end, were a sound faith, and the sanctified fruits
thereof, prepared and practiced in the time of his prosperity.

3. Thirdly, by fore-provision of Gods favor, grace, good conscience, and such
spiritual store, we shall be able worthily to grace, and honor our
profession; truly to enoble, and win a great deal of glory, and reputation
to the state of Christianity: when the ambitious Rufflers, and boisterous
Nimrods of the world shall see and observe, that there is a gracious invisible
vigor, and strength of Heaven, which mightily supports the heart of the true
Christian in those times of confusion and ^eare, when theirs shall be like the
heart of a woman in her pangs, and fall asunder in their breasts, even like
drops of water. That He is as bold as a Lion, and unmooveable like Mount Zion
in the Day of distress, and visitations of God; when they shall tremble at the
shaking of a leaf, and call upon the Mountains to cover them. That He shall
be able then to say with David, Psalm. 46.1.2. The Lord is my refuge, and my
strength, etc. Therefore will I not fear, the the earth be remooved, and tho
the mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea: But they shall cry, out
of the bitterness of their spirits, with the hypocrites, Isai. 33.14. Who among
us shall dwell with the devouring fire! Who amongst us shall dwell with
everlasting burnings? God is much honored, and His truth glorified, when it
appears in the face of men, that a poor neglected Christian, or in the worlds
language, a precise fool, is able by the power of grace, and influence of his
favor, to affront and outface all the frownings, and malignant aspects of the
proud Giants of the world. And he is the Lords noblest Champion, and a
Professor of the truest, and heavenliest dye, that holds out in the wetting,
and shrinkes not in the Day of adversity. Chrysostom speaks to the people of
Antioch like himself, a Man of an invincible spirit, against the tyrannies of
his times: Ad pop. Antioch. hom. 2.
In this, says He, should a gracious differ from a graceless man, that he
should bear his crosses courageously; and as it were, with the wings of Faith,
outsoare the height of all humane miseries. He should be like a Rock, being
incorporated into Jesus Christ, inexpugnable, and unshaken with the most
furious incursions of the waves and storms of worldly troubles, pressures and
persecutions. And blessed be God, that even here upon earth, in this vale of
tears, there is such a visible and vast difference, betwixt a wicked and godly
man. The one is like the raging Sea that cannot rest: the other stands fast
like a Rock, which shall never be remooved. An unregenerate heart is ever
restless, commonly in these three regards at the least: First, by reason of an
endless, and unsatisfiable appetite after pleasures, riches, honors, revenge,
or what other Darling delight it has singled out, and made special choice of
to follow, and feed upon with greatest contentment, and sensual sweetness,
God has justly put that property, or rather poison into all earthly things
doted upon, and desired immoderately, that they shall plague the heart, which
so pursues them; by filling it still with a furious and fresh supply of more
greediness, iealousies, and many miserable discontentments: so that they
become unto it, as drink unto a man in a Dropsy, or burning Fever, serve
only to inflame it with new heat, and fiery additions of insatiable thirst,
and i^ordinate longings. Secondly, because of the many secret grumblings, and
stinging reclamations of a gauled conscience against its present guilty
courses, and forbidden pleasures. Thirdly, in respect of a continual
ebullition, as it were, of confused and contrary lusts, out of the empoysoned
Fountain of original corruption, which fill it with many damnable
distractions, and tumultuations of Hell. But now if besides this inward
boiling, it be also tossed with outward troubles, what a miserable Creature is
a carnal Man? Even as the Sea, if besides its internal agitations; by the
restless motions of estuation, descention, revolution, and reflection; it be
also outwardly turmoyl'd with storms, and tempestuous winds, How ragefull and
roaing will it be? But the other is like a strong unmovable mountain, that
stands impregnable against the rage of wind and weather. And all the cruel
incursions, and ungodly oppositions made against it, either by men, or Devils,
are but like so many proud, and swelling waves, which dash themselves against a
mighty Rock. The more boysterously they beat against it, the more are they
broken, and turned into a vain foame and froath. Come, what come will, His
heart is still in His breast, and His resolution as high as Heaven. Pestilent
then is that Principle of Machiavel, Comm. lib. 2. cap. 2.
a Fellow not to be named, but by way of detestation, and savours rankely of
cursed Atheism. Whereby He teaches in sense and sum; That Heathenish
Religion did inspire Her Worthies of Old, with invincible, and victorious
spirits: But Christian Religion begets effeminat^nesse, deiections and sear.
He speaks to this purpose, which to me seems strange: That such a profound
Professor of the depths, or rather diuelishnesse of policy should dote so
sottishly. And yet it is no such strange thing: for many times we may observe;
that deepest Policy, by the curse of God upon it, for opposition to goodness,
turns into extremest folly. And all counsels, and politic constitutions
against Christ, are but the brainelesse infatuations of Ahitophel. For that
which this fellow holds there, holds strong contradiction, both to common
sense, and a thousand experiences to the contrary. For the first, and in a
word, Let the great Master of mischief, and of most abhorred atheistical Such
as that he ^aught unto Caesar Borgia: To employ men in mischeivous actions,
and afterward to destroy them, when they have performed the mischief.

To depresse those whom thou have grieved; and to destroy those whom thou have
deprest, etc.


Principles of State, tell me; whether a real assurance of a Crown of life,
and endless joys in another world, be not more powerful to raise a Man's
spirit, to the highest pitch of undaunted nobleness of spirit, and
unconquerable resolution, then a vain breath of immortal fame amongst
miserable men after this life? And in this lies the sinew of His proof. For
the second; Let the Acts of the ancient Jews be indifferently wayed, from whose
magnanimity, in causes of most extreme hazard, those strange and unwonted
resolutions have grown, which for all circumstances, says a great Divine, no
people under the roof of heaven did ever hitherto match. And that which did
always animate them, was their mere Religion. And let the Chronicles also,
say I, of later times be searched, and we shall find from time to time, many
renowned Worthies to have for ever ennobled the matchless and incomparable
courage of Christianity with in imitable impressions of valor, and visible
transcendency above all humane boldness, and affected audacities of the most
valiant Pagans. To begin with great Constantine, the first mighty Commander of
a Christian Army: with what victorious glory did He confound, and cut off many
potent Extinctis quinque Tyrannis Dioclesiano, Maximiano, Maxentio, Maximino,
et Licinio tenet monarch^m solus Constantinus. Chron. Carrion. lib. 3.
Heads of Paganism? Thrice was the whole world most famously fought for:
between Alexander and Zerxes, Caesar and Pompey, Constantine and Licinius.
This last was most Dimicarunt enim in utram partem fieret in^linatio; an

illustrious, wherein Constantine the Great did mightily conquer, and
triumphantly carry all before him; the heroical and royal spirit of
Christianity, trampling victoriously upon the desperate rage of the most
furious, foole-hardy Pagan Tyrants. I might here pass on to Theodosius, and
his miraculous conquests, and so along, but the disgression would be too
unseasonable. Therefore I leave you for the prosecution of this point, to
Anti-Machiavel. Even in later times, woefully plagued under the reign of
Antichrist, with a vast degeneration from primitive purity and power, Christian
Religion, tho empoysoned with Popish superstition, yet did so far inspire
it is Warlike Professors with extraordinary spirits, Lib. 2. Theor. 3.
that in point of manhood they did wonders, to the astonishment of the whole
world, and all succeeding Ages. That Expedition, I confess was a devise and
invention of the Pope, whereby He might come to be in feoffed in the King domes
of Christian Princes. So that on His part the project was pestilent. As King
James has excellently observed, in his Re^^onstrance against Perron. page 166.
For near the space of two hundred years, she, meaning Rome, made the force
and flower of the world to fall by millions, in the foolish conqvest of

Godfrey of Bulloigne, that famous Warrior, with his followers, conquered in
less then four years, all the goodliest Provinces of Asia, and drove out the
Turks. In that dreadful and cruel conflict in Solomon's Temple, as himself
reports in a letter to Boh^mund, King of Antioch, their men, by the great The
History of the Turks, page 24. Tantum ibi bumanisanguinis fusum, ut caesorum

680.
slaughter of the enemy stood in blood above the ancles. At that terrible, and
bloody battle at Ascalon, as most report, they slew an hundred thousand
Infidels, etc. The valor and victories of Hunniades, whose mighty spirit, and
incredible courage, for any thing I know, have no parallel in any precedent
Story, were so great, and did like a violent tempest, and impetuous torrent so
batter and beat down the enemies of Christ, that He was rightly reputed the

with the loss of three thousand, He killed that valiant Vice^oy of Asia,
Mesites Bassa, with His son, and twenty thousand Turks more: Hist. of the
Turks, page 270. Etseq.
at that famous battle of Vascape, wherein he got the greatest victory that
ever any Christian Prince before that time obtained against the Turkish Kings,
with fifteen thousand soldiers, He overthrew Abedin Bassa, sent against Him
most ragingly, by reason of a late shameful loss, according to Amuraths
instructions, by the slaughter of the Hungarians, to sacrifice unto the Ghosts
of their dead friends and companions, with an Army of fourscore thousand
fighting men. Scanderbeg also, was such a Mirror of Manhood, and so terrible
to the Turks, that nine years after His death, passing through Lyssa where His
Body lay buried, they dug up His bones with great devotion; reckoning it in
some part of their happiness, if they might but see or touch the same: and such
as could get any part thereof, were it never so little, caused the same to be
set, some in silver, some in gold, to hang about their necks, or wear upon
their bodies, thinking the very dead bones of that late invincible Champion
would animate their spirits with strange, and extraordinary elevation, and
vigor: Tam clari Herois venerati, nobile bustum, Ossaque, mar^^^ aque in^clum

all through success, and constant prevailing against that most mighty,
bloodthirsty Turkish Tyrant, the terror of Christendom, who drunk with the
wine of perpetual felicity holds all the rest of the world in scorn, and is
the greatest, and cruellest scourge of it, that ever the Earth bore. And

Idolatry of the Romish Church most principally and with special curse,
blasts, and brings to naught all undertakings of the Christian world against
that wicked Empire; the practice also of some pestilent Principles proper to
that Man of sin has plagued the most hopeful enterprises in this kind. For
instance: The king of Hungary, by the help of Hunmades, was in a fair course,
and forwardnes, to have tamed, and taken down, nay to have for ever crushed,
and confounded the insolency and usurpations of that raging Nimrod; but then
comes in the Pope with a beastly trick and utterly dashes and undoes all. For
He, out of His Luciferian pride, by the power or rather poison of that
Antichristian cutthroate Position; Of keeping no oath, nor faith, with
Infidells, and Heretics, unhappily undertook to In conclusion, having much
spoken, (meaning Julian the Cardinal) of the authority and power of the great
Bishop, He in his name dis-anulled the League whatsoever, by the King made with
the Turk, and absolved Him, with the rest whom it might concern, from the
oath they had given and the promises they had made. History of the Turks,
page 292.

Evangelists; and of Amurath, by His Ambassadors, upon their Turkish Alcaron.
Whereupon, they resolutely break the league; raise a great Army presently, and
against their oath, and promise set upon the Turk with perjury, and
perfidiousnes accompanied with Gods curse, exposed the Christian party to a
most horrible overthrow in that Certutum est totos dies, noctesque tres, diu

bloody battle of Varna, and cast upon the Profession of Christ, such an
aspersion, and shame, that not all the blood of that rope of Popes, which
constitute Antichrist, could ever be able to expiate.

Look upon the story, and consider what a reproach and inexpiable stain does
rest upon the face of Christian religion, by this wicked Stratagemme of Popish
treachery, and that even upon record to all posterity: For Amurath the Turkish
Emperor in the heat of the sight, plucked the writing out of His bosom,
wherein the late league was compris'de, and holding it up in his hand, with his
eyes cast up to Heaven, said thus: Hist. of the Turks, page 297.
Behold thou crucified Christ this is the league thy Christians in thy Name
made with Me: which they have without cause violated. Now if Thou be a God, as
they say Thou art, and as we dream revenge the wrong now done unto Thy Name
and Me, and show thy power upon Thy periurious people, who in their deeds deny
Thee their God.

2. Secondly. Since a stock of grace, and the comforts of a sound conscience,
be only able to crush all crosses, outface all adversaries, take the sting
out of all sorrows and sufferings; and serve in the evil Day as a sovereign
Antidote to save the Soul from sinking into the mouth of despair, and
extremest horror; then three sorts of people here offer themselves to be
censured, and are to be frighted, and fired out of their damned security, and
cruel case.

1. Those fools, Sons and daughters of confusion and sloth, who having a
price in their hands to get wisdom, yet want hearts to lay it out for
spiritual provision before hand. They enjoy by Gods rare, and extraordinary
indulgence, and favor, life, strength, wit, health, and many other outward
happinesses; nay the most glorious Day of a gracious visitation, that did ever
shine upon Earth; many golden and goodly oportunities, many blessed seasons and
sermons to enrich their fowls abundantly with all heavenly treasures: and yet
they are so far from spending their abilities, entertaining those merciful
Offers, and apprehending such happy advantages for their true and eternal
good, that they most unworthily, and unthankfully, abuse, mispend, and
dis-imploy all their means, time and manifold mercies, to serve their own
turns, attain their sensual ends, and possess the Present, with all the
carnal contentment they can possibly devise. These vassals of self-love, and
slaves of lust, are so lulled upon the lap of pleasure by the Siren songs of
Satan's solicitors; and so drunk with worldly prosperity, by swimming down the
current of these corruptest times with full sail of sensuality and ease, that
they fall asleep, for all the while of the happy Harvest in this life for
Inning grace into the Soul under the Sunshine of the Gospel; wasting their
precious time of gathering spiritual Manna, in grasping gold, clasping about
the Arm of flesh, s^ruing themselves by all wajes and means into high rooms,
crowning themselves with Rose-buds, and tumbling voluptuously in the pleasures
and glory of this false and flattering world. But alas poor souls, what will
they do in the evil Day! When after the hot gleame of earthly glory, and a
short calm and cut over the Sea of this world, they are come into the Port of
death, to which all winds drive them, and having there let fall that last
Anchor, which can never be weighed again, shall be set in the land of
darkness; the dust whereof is brimstone, and the rivers burning pitch; where
they shall meet with whole Armies of tempestuous and fiery plagues, and the
envenomed Arrows of Gods unquenchable anger, shall stick fast for ever in
their Soul and flesh; where they shall never more see the Light, nor the Land
of the living, but be drowned in everlasting perdition, in the Lake, even a
boiling Sea of fire and brimstone, where they can see no bank, nor feel no
bottom. What will these sleepers in Harvest say, when they shall be awaked at
that dreadful Hour out of their golden dreams, and in their hands shall
find nothing; but the judgment of God growing upon their thoughts as an
impetuous storm, death standing before them unresistable, like an armed Man;
sin lying at the door like a bloud-hound, and a guilty conscience knawing at
the heart like a Vulture? When they shall lie upon their last Beds, like wild
Bulls in a net, as the Prophet speaks, full of the wrath of God; saying, in
the morning, would God it were Even: and at Even, would God it were morning,
for the fear of their heart, wherewith they shall fear, and for the sight of
their eyes, which they shall see. I say in what case will they be then? Then,
But my words do fail me here, and so does my conceit. For as none knows the
sweetness of the Spouses kiss, but the Soul that receives it; so neither can
any one conceive this damned horror, but He that suffers it. The Lord of
Heaven in mercy awake the^ in the mean time, with the peircing thunder of His
sacred and saving Word, Rev. 14.2.
that they may be happily frighted, and fired out of their amassed
Soule-murdring sloth, before they feel in Hell, those fearful things, we so
faithfully forewarne them of.

To rouse them out of this cruel carnal security, let them entertain into
their most serious thoughts such considerations as these:

Consider,

1. Why thou came into this world. There is not so much as one Age past,
since Thou layest hid in the loathed state of being nothing. Above five
thousand years were gone, after the Creation, before there was any news of
Thee at all. And thou might never have bin; God had no need of Thee: He gave
Thee a Being only out of His own mere bounty. Potest Deus facere multa, qua
non facit: immo in infinitum ultra omnia, quae unquam facta sint, alia and
alia: Idq^e non modo secundum individuas rerum rations, sed etiam secundum
specificas, and generi^as, atque adeo simpliciter; ut docet Thomas hic Art. 5.

Infinite millions shall never be, which might have bin, as well as Thou^ Gods
omnipotency is equally able and active to have prod^ced them as Thee: And no
parts of that vast Abyss of Nothing, can possibly make any resistance to
Almightinesse.

And besides being so, that Thou must needs have a being, there is not any
Creature, that ever issued out of the hands of God, but thou might have bin
that, either for the kind, or for the particular. All is One to Him, to make
an Angel, or an Ant: To create the brightest Cherub, or the most contemptible
Fly: For in every creation, no less then Omnipotency must needs be the
Efficient, and no more then Nothing is ever the Object. Now what a miraculous
mercy was this, that passing by such an Miser ego in quantum deberem diligere
Deum meum, qui me fecit, cum non eram? -- Non enim eram, and de nihilo fecit

Contritione cordis.
un-numbred variety of incomparably inferior creatures, He should make Thee an
everlasting Soul like an Angel of God, capable of grace, and immortality; of
incorporation into Christ, and fruition of Iehova Himself blessed for ever?
Nay and yet further, tho thou wast to have the Being of a reasonable creature;
yet there was not an hour from the first moment of time unto the worlds end,
but God might have allotted that to Thee for thy coming into this world. And
therefore Thy time might have bin, within the compass of all those four
thousand years, or there abouts, from the Creation until the Coming of
Christ in the flesh; when as all without the Pale, and Partition Wall, were
without the Oracles and Ordinances of God, and all ordinary means of
salvation: Or since the Gospel revealed, under the reign of Antichrist; And
then a thousand to One, thou had been choakt, and for ever perished in the
damned mists of his Devilish Doctrines. What an high honor was this, to have
thy birth and abode here upon earth appointed from all eternity in the very
best and blesseddest time; upon the fairest Day of peace, and which is
infinitely more, in the most glorious Light of Grace, that ever shone from
Heaven upon the Children of men? And so of the place; Be it so, that Thou must
needs be in this golden Age of the Gospel, and gracious Day; yet thy lot of
living in the world at this time might have lited (for any part of the earth,
might have received Thee, where Thou could have set but thy two feet)
amongst Turks, Pagans, Infidels, a whole world to Quid quod nostris
temporibus, vix sexta pars orbis habitabilis Christo nomen dederit? Suffra

the confines of Christendom; yet Thou might have sprung up in the Popish
parts of it; or in the scismaticall, or persecuted Places of the true Church in
it. It was a very singular favor; That thou should be borne, and bred, and
brought up in this little neglected Nooke of the world, yet very illustrious by
the presence of Christ in a mighty Ministry; where Thou have, or might have
enjoyed in many Parts thereof the glorious Gospel of our blessed God, and all
saving Truth with much purity and power. Now put all these together; and tell
me in cold blood, and after a sensible and serious ponderation thereupon* Do
thou think, that all this ado was about Thee, all this honor done unto Thee,
and when all is done, Thou art to do nothing, but seek Thy self, serve Thine
own turn, and live sensually? Came Thou out of Nothing into this world to
do just nothing, but Neque propt^r^a creati (...), ut ederemus, atque
biberemus, ^^stque ^^^eremur, sed ut pla^^ remus Deo, and bonis potiremur
^uturis. Chrysostom. in cap. 6. M^^. Hom. 23.
eat and drink and sleep* to game; go in the fashion; and play the good
fellow* to laugh and be merry, to grow rich and leave tokens of thy pleasure in
every place? etc. If any after so much illightning, be so prodigiously mad, as
to continue in such a conceit, I have nothing to say to Him, but leave Him as
an everlasting Bedlam, abandoned to that folly, which wants a name to express
it. Turn then thy course for shame, nay, as Thou have any care to be saved,
and to see the glory of the new Jerusalem; as Thou desire to look the Lord
Jesus in the face with comfort at that great Day; as Thou fear to receive
thy portion in Hellfire with the Devil, and His Angels, even most
intolerable and bitter torments for ever and ever; at least in this thy day, in
this heat and height of Thy spiritual Harvest, awake out of thy sensual
sleep, come to thy self with the Prodigal; strik^ upon thy thigh; and for
the poor remainder of a few, and evil days, address thy self with
resolution, and constancy to pursue the One necessary Thing, and to treasure up
much heavenly strength and store against thine ending hour. Get thee under
conscionable Means, and quickening Ministry, and there gather grace as
greedily as the most gryping Usurer graspeth gould; contend with an holy
ambition, as earnestly for the keeping of Gods favor, and an humble
familiarity with His heavenly Highness by keeping faith and a good conscience,
as the proudest Haman for an high Place, and pleased face of an earthly Prince.
And why not infinitely more? This was the end, for which thou wast sent into
this World; This only is the way to endless bliss, And this alone will help
us and hold out in the Evil day.

2. That, If a man would sit down, and call His thoughts together, but for one
half hour, and consider this seriously: I have but a very little time to live
here; It is another place, where I must live through all eternity: As I spend
this short time, so shall it be with me for ever: I say, if this were thoroughly
considered, I wonder that any thing should take up the intentions, and thoughts
of a Man's heart, but only to make sure his salvation. The little Point of
time, we live in this world, is nothing, to the duration before it, or to the
eternity following it: It is therefore most fit, and best wisdom to spend
it, were it ten times longer, in those courses which may make the everlasting
time to come, endlesly and un-utterably comfortable unto us.
upon the little ynch of time in this life, depends the length and breadth of
all eternity in the World to come. As we behave our selves here, we shall fare
everlastingly hereafter. And therefore how ought we to ply this moment, and
prize that eternity? To decline all entanglement in those inordinate affections
to the possessions, and pleasures of the Present, which hinder a fruitful
improovement of it, to the best advantage for the spiritual good of our
Souls; Let us be moved with such reasons as these, which may be collected
from the words of a worthy Writer, which run thus with very little variation:

1. If we could afford our selves but so much leisure as to consider, That he
which has most in the world, has, in respect of the world, nothing in it: and
that he which has the longest time lent him to live in it, has yet no
proportion at all therein, setting it either by that which is past, when we
were not; or by that time in which we shall abide for ever: I say, if both, to
wit, our proportion in the world, and our time in the world differ not much
from that which is nothing; it is not out of any excellency of understanding,
says He, but out of depth of folly, say I, that we so much prize the one,
which has (in effect) no being: and so much neglect the other, which has no
ending: coveting the mortal things of the world, as if our Souls were therein
immortal, and neglecting those things which are immortal, as if our selves
after the world were but mortal.

If it be so, That there is no difference of the time past, in respect of
pains, and pleasures, between that fellow, which has wallowed all his life
long, in worldly delights; and Him, who has been exercised with variety of
afflictions and likesome sufferings: what a prodigious madness is it, to
prefer the sensual ease of a vain life, before the sweetest pain of a
mortified course? Especially, since very shortly, the one ends in endless
pains: and the other in endless pleasures. And also in the mean time, that
is true; That tho the air which compasses adversity, he very a ^^^ure: yet
therein we better discern God, then in that shining light, which environeth
worldly glory; through which, for the clea^en^sse thereof, there is no vanity,
which escapes our sight.
2. Let adversity seem what it will; to happy men, ridiculous, who make
themselves merry with other men's miseries; and to those under the cross,
grievous; yet this is true, That for all that is past, to the very instant. the
portions remaining are equal to either. For be it, that we have lived many
years and (according to Solomon) in the^ all, we have rejoiced; or be it, that
we have measured the same length of time, and therein have ever-more sorrowed:
yet looking back from our present being, we find both the one and the other,
to wit, the joy and the woe sailed out of sight; and death, which does pursue
us, and hold us in chase, from our infancy* has gathered it. Quicquid at at is
retro est, mors tenet.
Whatsoever of our age is past, death holds it. So as whosoever he be, to whom
Prosperity has bin a servant and the Time a friend: let him but take the
account of his memory* (for we have no other keeper of our pleasures past,) and
truly examine, what it has reserved, either of beauty and youth, or fore-gone
delights; what it has saved, that it might last, of his dearest affections, or
of whatever else* the joviall Springtime gave his thoughts contentment, then
unvaluable; and he shall find, that all the art, which his elder years have,
can draw no other vapor out of these dissolutions, then heavy, secret, and sad
sighs. He shall find nothing remaining, but those sorrows, which grow up
after our fast-springing youth; ^vertake it, when it is at a stand; and overtop
it utterly, when it begins to wither: in so much as looking back from the very
instant time, and from our now being; the poor, diseased, and captive
creature, has as little sense of all his former miseries, and pains; as he,
that is most blessed in common opinion, has of his forepassed pleasures, and
delights. For whatsoever is cast behind us, is just Quis illius voluptatis
fructus est, quistatim ut cessaverit, ut debitur tibi non fuisse? Age iam,
transactum vitae tuae tempus animo revolve. Nonne videbitur tibi umbra quaedam
fuisse, quod transijs, and instar so ^nij tenuis incertum esse omne quod
vid^^ur? Hoc idem and decrepitus senex sentire* Cui convenit dicere cum
Prophet^, Dies mei sicut umbrae declinaverunt, and ego sicut faenum ar^^^. Quod
si haec etiam hic possumus dicere, uli quamvis brevis, tamen quia praesens est,
vita ista magni penditur, quid in futuro dicturi sumus, ubi majori aetatis
scientia transactum omne pro nihilo est? Aug. Ep. 142.
nothing.

To ponder also profitably upon eternity, that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom, and so improove this short moment upon earth, that it may go well
with us for ever; let us take notice of, and sensibly to heart, this one
quickening passage, confidently averred by a great Writer. Si Deus diceret
damnatis, Impleatur terra arena minutissima, ita ut totus orbis hisce arenae
granulis repleatur, a terra usque ad Coelum Empyreum; and millesimo quoquo anno
Angelus veniat, dematque ex hoc arenae cumulo unum granulum, cumque post tot
millenarios annorum, quot sunt granula, ea exhauserit, liberabo vos a gehenna:
O quam exultarent damnati, damnatus se non aestimarent: nunc autem, post omnes
hos millenarios restant alij, and alij millenary in infinitum, in aeternum and
ultra. Hoc est pondus grave aeternitatis, quod opprimit damnalos. Cogita, O
peccator, hoc pondus tibi imminere, nisi resipiscas. -- Qui fit, quod tam raro,
tam modice, tam obiter, de ea cogitemus?
If God, says He, should speak thus to a damned Soul: Let the whole world be
filled with sand from the earth to the Empyrean heaven, and then let an Angel
come every thousandth year, and fetch only one grain from that mighty sandy
mountain; when that immeasurable Heap is so spent, and so many thousand
years expired, I will deliver Thee out of Hell, and those extremest horrors;
that most miserable forlorn wretch, notwithstanding, that he were to lie
through that unconceiveable length of time in those intolerable Hellish
torments, yet upon such a promise would infinitely rejoice, and deem himself
not to be damned. But alas! when all those years are gone, there are thousands
upon thousands more to be endured, even through all eternity and beyond. How
heavy and horrible is the weight of everlastingnesse in that burning Lake, and
those tormenting flames, when a damned man would think himself in Heaven in
the mean time, if he might have but hope of coming out of them, after so many
infinite millions of years in them?

3. That it would not profit a man, tho he should gain the whole world, if he
lose his own Soul, and that a man can give nothing in exchange for his Soul:
Christ himself said so. Suppose thy self crowned with the confluence of all
worldly felicities, to have purchased a Monopoly of all pleasures, honors and
riches upon the whole earth, to be attended with all the pomp and state, thy
heart could desire. Yet what were this momentany golden dream to a real
glorious eternity? How stinging would the most exquisite delight be, curiously
extracted out of them all, accompanied with this one conceit; the Soul is
lost everlastingly. All these painted vanities, might seem perhaps a gaudy
Paradise to a spiritual Fool, who has his portion in this life; But what
true pleasure can a Man, in his right wits, but morally and illightned no
further then with Philosophy, take in them; since, setting other respects aside,
they are so fading, and He so frail. For the first: God has purposely put a
transitory and mortal nature into all things here below. They spring, and
flourish, and die. Even the greatest kingdoms, and strongest Monarchies, that
ever were, have had, as it were, their infancy, youthful strength, Man's state,
old age, and at last their grave. See the end of the mightiest states that ever
the Sun saw, shadowed by Nebuchadn^zzars great Image. Dan. 2. 35. There was
never Empire upon earth, were it never so flourishing or great, was ever yet so
assured, but that in revolution of time, after the manner of other worldly
things, it has, as a sick body, bin subject to many innovations and changes,
and at length come to nothing. Much more then, the pride and pomp of all other
inferior earthly glory has fallen at last into the dust, and lies now buried
in the grave of endless forgetfulness. For the second; Imagine, there were
constancy and eternity in the forenamed earthly bables, yet what Man of brain,
would prize them worth a button, since His life is but a bubble; and the very
next hour or day to come, He may utterly be cut off from them all, for ever.
To day he is set up, and to morrow he shall not be found: for he is turned
into dust, and his purpose perishes. Take them both together thus: Set upon
the head of the Worthiest Man, that the earth bears, yet wanting grace in His
Soul, all the most orient imperial Crowns, that ever highest ambition aimed
at, or attained unto; put upon Him the royallest roabes, that ever enclosed the
body of the proudest Lucifer; fill Him with all the wisdom, and largest
comprehensions, which fall within the wide compass, and capacity of any
depths of policy, or mysteries of state; furnish Him to the full with the
exactness, and excellency of all natural, moral and metaphysicall learning;
put Him into the sole possession and command of this and the other golden
world: In a word crown Him with the concurrence of all created earthly
excellencies, to the utmost and highest strain: And lay this Man thus
qualifyed and endowed upon the one scale of the balance, and vanity upon the
other, and vanity will overweigh Him quite. Men of high degree are a lie: to be
laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter then vanity, Psalm. 62.9. The
rich Fool in the Gospel teaches us, that there is no man so assured of his
honor, of his riches, health or life; but that he may be deprived of either or
all the very next night. Besides, by a thousand other causes, means, and
ways, He may also be suddenly snatched away from the face of the earth in
anger, for setting his heart and rest, upon such rotten staves of reed,
transitory shadows, and indeed that which is nothing. Will thou cast thine
eyes upon it which is nothing? for riches, (conceive the same of all other
worldly comforts) takes her to her wings as an Eagle, and flies into the
heaven, Prove. 23.5. How truly then is that mad and miserable Man a Son of
confusion, who spends the short Span of his mortal life in wooing the world,
who was never true to those that trusted in her, ever false-hearted to all Her
Favorites, and at length most certainly undoes spiritually and everlastingly
every Wretch that is wedded unto Her; who passes through a few and evil days
in this vale of tears, in following feathers, pursuing shadows, raising
bubbles and balls, like those which Boys out of spittle and soap in their
pastimes, blowing up with their quills, ere they be tossed three times, burst
of themselves, I mean worldly vanities, but in the mean time suffers His
immortal Soul, more worth then many mate^^all worlds, and for which, He can
give nothing in exchange, to abide all naked, destitute and empty, utterly
unfurnished of that comfortable provision, and gracious strength, which should
support it in the day of sorrow; and leaves it at last to the tempestuous
winter-night of death, and all those desperate terrors that attend it, like a
scorched heath-ground without so much as any drop of comfort, either from
Heaven or earth.

2. A second sort, worse then the former, are such, as are so far, from
treasuring up in this time of light, and merciful visitation, soundness of
knowledge, strength of says, purity of heart, clearness of conscience,
holiness of life, assurance of Gods favor, contempt of the world; many
sanctified Sabbaths, fervent prayers, holy conferences, heavenly meditations,
days of humiliation, righteous dealings with their Brethren, compassionate
contributions to the necessities of the Saints, works of justice, mercy and
truth, a sincere respect to all Gods Commandments, a careful performance of
all spiritual Duties, a conscionable partaking of all Gods Ordinances, a
seasonable exercise of every grace, hatred of all false ways, an hearty and
invincible love unto God and all things that He loves, or any ways belong unto
Him, His Word, Sacraments, Sabbaths, Ministers, Services, Children, Presence,
Corrections, Coming, etc. which are the ordinary provision of Gods people
against the evil Day, I say, they are so far from prizing, and preparing
such spiritual store, that they hoard up stings, scourges, and scorpions for
their naked souls, and guilty consciences, against the Day of the Lords
visitation; I mean lies, oaths, blasphemies; Adulteries, whoredoms,
selfe-pollutions; variety of strange fashions, gamings, revellings; drunken
matches, good fellow meetings, wanton dancings; usuries, falsehoods,
hypocrisies; plurality of ill gotten goods, Benefices, Offices, honors; filthy
jests, much idle talk, flanderous ^^les; scoffs, raylings, oppositions to the
Holy way etc. And that with a cursed greediness and delight. For they cry One
unto another out of a boisterous combination of good fellowship, with much
eagerness and roaring: Come on therefore -- Let us fill our selves with costly
wine, and ointments, and let no flower of the Spring pass by us. Let us crown
our selves with Rose buds, before they be withered: Let none of us go without
his part of our voluptuousness: Let us leave tokens of our pleasure in every
place: For this is our portion, and our lot is this. Let us lie in wait for
the righteous: because he is not for our turn, and be is clean contrary to
our Quin potius auferantur, quibus coram male vivere pudet, qui peccantium
frontem (...) non verb^, quia (...) tamen ipso vita (...) dissimili feriunt
(...) verberant.

doings, etc. But alas! what will be the conclusion of all this, or rather the
horrible confusion? Even all their ioviall revellings, roaring Outrages, and
sinful pleasures, which are so sweet in their mouths, and they swallow down
so insatiably, shall turn to gravel and the Job 20.
gall of Aspes in their bowels, and to fiery enraged scorpions in their
consciences. Where lurking in the mean time, in the mudde of sensuality, and
lust, breed such a never dying worm, which if God think fit to awake upon
their last Bed, is able to put them into Hell upon earth, to damn them above
ground, to know upon their Soul and flesh, with that unheard of horror, which
seizde upon Spir'as woeful heart. Caeterum vultu and facie satis valens, mente
and intellectu constantissimus, memoria potentissimus: nunquam eadem verba bis
repetit: venientes omnes ad se recipit: sermones and doctos and graves ac
maturos profert, se iusto Dei judicio damna^^^, se jam in inferno esse and inde
inenter cruciari Optare se in loco Iudae and Caini esse. Gribaldi. epist. de
tremendo divini judicij exemplo, etc. page 38.

Immisit Deus ex illa hora in cor ejus vermem corrodentem, ign^m
inextinguibilem, ut horrore, Confusione, desperatione, subito repleretur. Qui
vermis and ignis nunquam exinde illum dereliquerunt; ut se long deteri^ri in
statu testetur, quam si separata a corpore anima cum judah Cain, and caeteris
damnatis esset: desiderans se loco cujusvis mortui and damnati esse pottus,
quam si in corpore vivere. Ibid page 43.


Who protested being fully in his right mind, that He would rather be in
Cain's or Judas his place in Hell, then endure the present unspeakeable torment
of His afflicted spirit.

To beat them from this bedlam desperate course of greedy hoarding up such
horrible things unto themselves, against their ending hour; Let them consider;

1. Besides the eternity of joys for the one, and of torments to the other
hereafter, the vast and unvaluable difference in the mean time, in respect of
true sweetness and sound contentment, between the life of a Saint and a
Sensualist; a Puritan, as the World calls Him, and a goodfellow, as he terms
Himself. Let us for the purpose peruse the different passages of one day; as
Tom. 5. Sermon. contra Gulam and caeteras corporis volupt Producamu^ homines duos
in medium, quorum alier lasciviae sit and voluptatibus deditus, alter vero
prorsus sit his rebus demortuus, etc. Adeamus istorum domos. -- Inveniemus
certe alterum, libris incumbentem, vacantem rei divinae, abstinentiae, vel
rebus necessarus incumbentem, habentemque cum Deoser ^onem^ de reb^s
coelestibus diss^rentem, and Angelum potius agentem, quam hominem. Alterum ver^
madentem mero-dantem operam lasciviae-debacchantem -- delicijs incumbentem, non
solum vivendo (...) mortem, sed esse mortuis long inferiorem,
perniciosioremque Daemone agitato, and furijs. Vbi vero dies illuxit, am^ttit
omnem, quam ex lascivia ceperat, voluptatem* si ^^dem Familiam ob mu^murantem
and insectantem se ^urgio conjugem, objurgantes amicos* ^^^micos ludibrio se
habentes recognoscit.
Chrysostom excellently delineats them, and represents to the life. Let us
produce two men, says He; the one drowned in carnal looseness, sensualities,
and riotous excess; the other crucified and stark dead to such sinful
courses and worldly delights: Let us go to their houses and behold their
behavior.

We shall find the One, reading Scriptures, and other good Books, taking times
for holy Duties and the service of God; sober, temperate, abstemious; diligent
also in the necessary duties of His Calling, having holy conference with God,
discoursing of Heavenly things, bearing himself liker an Angel, then a Man:
The other, joviall, a vassal of luxury and ease, swaggering up and down
Alehouses, Tavernes, or other such conventicles of good fellowship, hunting
after all the ways, means and men to pass the time merrily, plying his
pleasures with what variety, he can possibly all the day long, railing and
roaring as tho He were enraged with a Devil, tho He be stark dead, while He
is alive. etc. Which is accompanied, with murmuring of the family, discontent
of the wife, chiding of friends, laughing to scorn, of enemies, etc. Whether
of these courses now do you think were the more comfortable? I know full well
the former would be cried down by the greatest part, as too precise: and the
latter would carry it, by a world of men: but hear the Puritan Fathers
impartial holy censure, quite cross to the common conceit, and humor of
flesh and blood. It is excellent and emphaticall, arguing His resolute
abomination of the ways of goodfellowship; and infinite love and admiration of
the holy Path. Having given to the Goodfellow His hearts desire all the day
long in all kinds of voluptuousness, and delight: yet for all this, Quis
igitur, qui mentis sit compos, non potius optet mill obire mortes, quam diem
unum hanc vitam degere?
Who is he says He, that is in his right mind, and has His brains in His
head, that would not choose rather to die a thousand deaths, then spend but one
day so? This peremptory passage would be holden a strange Paradoxe from the
mouth of any modern Minister, and so appears to the carnal apprehension of
all those miserable men, who are blindfolded and baffled by the Devil to the
eternal loss of their Souls. But besides that, it might be made good many
other ways, it is more then manifest by comparing that threefold sting, that
dogs every sinful delight at the heels, etc. See my Book of Walking with
God* page 17^. with the comfortable contentment, and secret sweetness, which
might and should attend all well-doing, and every holy duty done with
uprightness of heart. The very Philosophers do tell us of a congratulation, a
pleasing contentedness and satisfaction in doing virtuously according to their
moral Rules. What true, solid, and singular comfort then, do you think may
be found, in those godly actions, which spring from faith, are guided by Gods
Word, directed to his glory, and whose bewailed defects and failings are most
certainly pardoned by the blood of his Son? Now what an extreme madness is
this, for a Man to sell His salvation for a life of pleasures; abhorring the
ways of Gods Child, as too precise, and painful; whereas besides Hell for
the one, and Heaven for the other hereafter; in the mean time every day spent
so sensually, is a true Purgatory: And every day passed in the contrary
Christian course, is an earthly Paradise.

2. Secondly, Let them mark well the different Ends of these men.

Tho the one now carries away the credit and current of the times, and with
all bravery and triumph tumbles Himself in the pleasures, riches, and glory of
the world; and the other is kept, as they say, under batches, neglected and
contemptible to carnal eyes, trampled upon with the feet of pride and malice
by the prouder Pharisees, and hunted with much cruelty and hate by Men of this
World: Yet watch but a while; and you shall see the End of this upright man*
whatsoever his sorrows and sufferings, troubles and temptations have been in
this life, to be most certainly peace at the last. Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace. Psalm. 37.37. He either
passes fairly, and calmely through the Port of Death, to the Land of
everlasting rest, and rejoicing; or else, if a tempest of extraordinary
temptation seize upon Him in the Haven, when He is ready, to set foot into
heaven, which is the Lot of many of Gods dearest Ones, for ends seeming best to
the ever-blessed Majesty; as, perhaps to harden those above Him, that hate to
be reformed, etc. Yet all the hurt he has thereby, is upon the matter, besides
serving Gods secret holy pleasure, an addition to His happiness; for an
immediate translation from the depth of temporary horror, as in Master
Peacocke, and Mistress Bretlergh, to the height of endless joy, makes even the
joys of Heaven something more joyful. He feels those never-ending
pleasures, at the first entrance more delicious and ravishing, by reason of the
sudden change, from that bitterness of spirit in the last combat, to the
excellency, and eternity of heavenly bliss. His Soul in this case after a
short eclipse of spiritual darkness upon His Bed of death enters more
lightsomly into the full Sun of immortal glory. But what do you think
shall be the end of the other Man? He is in the mean time, it may be, in
great power, and spreading Himself like a green Bay tree, revelling in the
ruff and top of all worldly jollity and wealth, wallowing dissolutely in
choicest delights and vamest pleasures; yet wait but a while, and you shall
see him quickly cut down like grass, and wither as the green herb^. For God
shall suddenly shoot at Him with a swift arrow. It is already in the bow; even
a bow of steel shall send forth an arrow, that shall strike Him through, and
shall shine on his gall. His power, and his pride shall be overthrown in the
turn of an Hand. All his imperious boisterousnes^e shall melt away as a vain
foame. The eye which saw Him, shall ^^e him no more; neither shall hi^ place
any more behold him. He must down into the grave naked and stripped of all power
and pomp; all beauty and strength: a weaker and poorer worm, then when he
f^^st came out of the womb. Here further for this purpose and fuller
expr^ssion of my meaning in this point, how a worthy friend of mine, instancing
in the exemplary and dreadful downe-falls of Haman, Shebnah and others,
labors to fright graceless great Ones, out of their luxury and pride;
security and sinful pleasures; by consideration of their Ends. Oh then says
he, ye rich and great, ye proud, and cruel, Ambitious and honorable, take
from their woeful examples, the true estimate of your riches, and your power,
your pleasure and your honor, wherein ye trust, and whereof ye boast, but as
Israel in Egypt, of a broken reed. Consider that like sins, will have like
ends: That God is to day and yesterday, and the same for ever: That the pride
and cruelty; oppression and luxury of these times have no greater privilege,
then those of the former: But when for a while, you have domineered far and
near, Had what you would, and done what you li^t, dispeopled Parishes and
plains for your Orchards and walks; pulld down many houses, to set one up;
from between whose battlements, and turrets at the top, you can see no end of
your meadows, your fields, and your lands; the measuring whereof as the Poet
speaks, would weary the very wings of the kite: When your Clientary train
has bin too long for the street; and your bare respect has shook the hat
from the head, and bent the knee afar off: when you have clapped whole Manours
on your backs; or turned them down your throats: when you have scoured the
plaine^ with your horses, the fields and woods with your bounds and the heaven
with your hawks: when with pheasant^ tongues you have furnished whole feasts;
and with the Queen of Egypt drunk dissolved pearl, even fifty thousand
pounds at a draught, and then laid your head^ in Dalila^s lap: When, if it
were possible, yo^ have spent your whole lives, in all that royal pomp, and
pleasure, which that most magnificent King and Quee^^ did Hist. 1. for an
hundred and fourscore days: (...) word, when you have wallowed in all
delights, and stood in pleasures up to the chin: Then even then, the pit is
dug, and death, of whom you dream not, stands at the door. Where are you
now? Or what is to be done? Come down, says Death, from your pleasant
Prospects; Alight from your Iades; Hood your kites; Cupple up your curres; bid
adieu to pleasure; out of your beds of lust; Come naked forth, and down with
me to the chambers of death: Make your beds in the dust; and lay down your
cold carcasses among the stones of the pit at the roots of the Rocks. And you
great and delicate Dames, who are so wearied with pleasure, that you cannot
rise time enough to dress your heads, and do all your tricks against dinner:
To wash your bodies with musk, and dawbe your faces with vermilion and chalk;
To make ready your pleasant baits, to poison men's eyes, and their souls. You
whorish lezabels think you now, you are meat for men? Nay come headlong
down to the dogs. If not suddenly so, yet dispatch and put off your caules,
eare-rings, and round tyres; your chains, bracelets and mufflers; your rings,
wimples and crisping pinns; your* hoods, vailes and changeable suits: your
glasses, sine linen, with all your Mundus muliebris. Isa. 3. And put on
stink, in stead of sweet smell; baldness in stead of well-set hair; burning
in stead of beauty: Worms shall make their nests in your breasts; and shall
eat out those wanton windows, and messengers of lust. Yea rottenness, and
stinch; slime and filth shall ascend, and sit down in the very Throne of
beauty; and shall dwell between your eie-browes.

All this is very woeful, and yet there is a thousand times worse. Besides all
this, Thou, that now lays about the for thee world and wealth; for transitory
pelf and rotten pleasures; that lies soaking in luxury and pride, vanity, and
all kind of voluptuousness; shall most certainly, very shortly, lie upon thy
Bed of death, like a wild bull in a net full of the fury of the Lord; either
sealing thee up finally in the desperate senselessenesse of thine own dead
heart, with the spirit of slumber, for everlasting vengeance, even at the
door; or else exemplarily enraging thy guilty conscience upon that thy last
bed, with hellish horror, even before hand. For I say [Ordinarily] 1. First,
because, Sometimes (...) notorious Ones* and yet without all (...), may
represent, to the eye of un-judicious Bystanders, whereby they are (...)
fearfully hardened, a notable show of dying well. In my time, says the French
A^thor of Essaies, Three of the ^ost exercr^ble persons that ever I knew in all
(...), and the most infamous, have been seen to die very orderly, and quietly,
etc. I have also my self o^served some of higher place notorio^sly wicked, who
by their carriage in their last sickness, have suggested conceits, especially
to those who were willing to be hardened by their deaths, that they made a good
end, as they say, whereas they had no true touch in Conscience at all, or
feeling remorse for their former extremely sinful life. Which is occasioned
sometimes, by the un-skilfulnesse of some spiritual Physicians about them, who
are ready to dawbe, and draw a skin only over their un-searched sinful sores,
now at their death, as they were to play the Men-pleasers, and Sow-pillowes
under (...) in their life time; Fellows as excellent in palliate Cures; as
utterly un-acq^ainted with the mystery of comforting afflicted Consciences
aright, and speaking seasonably to such as lie upon their last Bed. Hear

people in their unsaving state: Hear Green^ams doom of such a death: They

known some such upon the very first thought, they should certainly die, to
have fallen into desperation, and could never be recovered. And although many
f^rma^l Professors, may go to Hell with many g^od speeches, and Lord* Lord,
in them (...) appears in the f^^l^sh Virgins, and those in the seventh of
Mattheww; yet I ^ave ^nowne of some of them; who have died very fearfully
indeed, and full of cruely desperate horror.
ordinarily, the more notorious servants of Satan, and Slaves of lust, depart
this life, either like Nabal, or Judas: Tho more by many thousands die like
hard-hearted sots in security, then in despair of conscience. If it be so
with thee then, that thine heart, when thou shall have received the sentence of
death against thy self, die within thee as Naballs. ( And most commonly, says
a worthy Devine, Conscience in many, is secure at the time of death: God in his
justice so plaguing an affected security in life, with an inflicted security at
death.) I say then thou will become, as a stone: most prodigiously blockish; as
tho there were no immortality of the Soul, no loss of eternal bliss; no
Tribunal in Heaven, no account to be made after this life, no burning in Hell
for ever. Which will make the never-dying fire more scorching, and the
ever-living worm more stinging; by how much thou wast more senseless, and
fearelesse of that fiery lake into which thou wast ready to fall. Death it
self, says the same Man, cannot awaken some consciences, but no sooner come
they into hell, but conscience is awakened to the full, never to sleep more,
and then she teareth with implacable fury, and teaches forlorn wretches to
know, that forbearance was no payment. But if it please God to take the other
course with thee, and to let loose the cord of thy conscience upon thy dying
Bed; thou will be strangled even with Hellish horror upon earth and damned
above ground. That Worm of Hell, which is a continual remorse, and furious
reflection of the Soul upon its own wilful folly; whereby it has lost
everlasting joys, and must now lie in endless, easelesse and remediless
torments, is set on work, whilst thou art yet alive, and with desperate rage,
and unspeakeable anguish will feed upon thy Soul and flesh. The least twitch
whereof, not all the pleasures of ten thousand Worlds, would ever be able to
countervaile: For as the peace of a good, so the pangs of a guilty conscience
are unspeakable. So that at that time, thou may justly take unto thy self
Pashur's terrible name; Magor-Missabib; Fear round about: Thou will be a
terror to thy self, and to all thy friends. And that which in this woeful
case will sting extremely; No friends, nor Physic; no gould, nor silver; no
height of place, nor favor of Prince; not the glory and pleasures of the whole
World; not the crowns and command of all earthly kingdoms, etc. can possibly
give any comfort, deliverance or ease! For when that time and terror has
overtaken thee, which is threatened Prou. 1.24. Et seq. Because I have called,
and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded: But ye
have set a^ naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will
laugh at your calamity, and will mock when your fear comes. When your fear
comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a Whirlewinde; when
distress, and anguish comes upon you. Then shall they call upon Me, but I
will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord. They
would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they
eat the fruit^ of their own way, and be filled with their own devises. I
say, when this terrible time is come upon thee; then will the mighty Lord of
Heaven and earth come against thee, Hos. 13.8.
as a Bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rent the caul of thy
heart, and will devour thee like a Lion: Isa. 66.15.
He will come with fire, and with His charets like a Whirle-winde, to render
His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire: All his terrors at
that hour will fight against Thee, and that un^quenchable anger, Deuteronomy. 32.22.
that burns to the very bottom of Hell, and sets on fire the foundations of
the mountains: The empoysoned arrows of His fiercest indignation shall be
drunk with the blood of thy Soul, and stick fast in it for ever. In a word,
the fearful armies of all the plagues and curses, sorrows and un-sufferable
pains denounced in Gods Book against final Impenitents, shall with
un-resistable violence take hold upon thee at once, and pursue thee with that
fury, which thou shall never be able either to avoid, or abide. And who is
able to stand before this holy Lord God? who can abide in His sight when He is
angry? who can deliver out of His hand? what man or Angel; what arm of flesh
or force of Arms, what creature, or created power; what Cherub or which of the
Seraphins is able to free a guilty conscience from the ever-knawing Worm, and
an impenitent wretch from eternal flames? Oh, Me thinks a sensible
forethought of these horrible things even at hand, should make the hardest
heart of the most abominable Behall to tremble at the root, and fall asunder
in His breast like drops of water! To have his end in his eye; and seriously to
remember the tribulation, and anguish that shall shortly come upon His Soul,
the affliction, the Worm wood and the gall, should fright and fire Him out of
all His filthy graceless, good fellow courses!

3. Thirdly, Let them consider, what horror it will be in evil times, I
mean, not only at death and the last Day, which are the most terrible of all;
but also, In times of disgrace and contempt; of common fear, and confusions of
the state; of sickness, crosses, restraint, banishment, temptations, or any
other days of sorrow* I say at such times, to find in stead of peace, fiery
scorpions in their consciences, innumerable sins graven there, with an iron
pen, un-repented of! Hear how excellently Inter omnes tribulationes humanae
animae, nulla est major tribulatio, quam conscientia delictorum. Namque si ibi
vulnus non sit, sanumq^e sit intus hominis, quod conscientia vocatur* ubicunque
al^bi passus fuerit tribulationes, illuc confugiet, and ibi inveniet Deum. Si
autem ibi requies non est, propter abundantiam iniquitatum, quoniam and ibi
Deus non est, quid facturus est homo. Quo conf^giet, cum caeperit
patitribulationes? Fugiet ^b^gro ad civitatem, a publico ad domum, a domo ad
cubiculum, and sequitur tribulatio. A cubiculo jam quo fugiet, non habet nisi
interius ad cubile suum. Porro si ibi tumultus est, si fumus iniquitatis, si
s^a^nmasceleris, non illuc potest confug^re. Pellitur enim^n^e, and cum inde
pellitur, a seipso pellitur. Et ecce hostem suum inven^^, quo confugerat;
seipsum, quo fugiturus est. Quocunque fugerit se, talem trohit post se: and
quocunque talem traxerit se, cruciat se. In Psalm. 46. p. 502.
Austin foretells and forewarnes them, into what a forlorn and fearful state,
they shall most certainly fall, when after a short gleame of worldly glory,
they fall into tempestuous, and troublesome times. Of all afflictions incident
to the Soul of man, there is none more grievous, and transcendent; then to
have the Conscience enraged with the guilt of sin. If there be no wound
there, if all be safe and sound within, if that bird of the bosom sing
sweetly in a M^^s breast; it is no matter, what miseries be abroad in the
World, what storms, or (...) be raised against Him What arm of flesh* or rage
of foes beset Him round: For He in this are, has presently recourse unto His
conscience* the safest Sanctuary, and Paradise of sweetest repose, and finding
that sprinkled with the blood of the Lamb, filled with abundance of peace, and
God Himself there, reconciled unto Him in the face of Christ, He is
courageously fearelesse of all, both mortal and immortal, adversaries and
oppositions: Tho the earth be remooved; and the mountains carried into the
midst of the Sea, tho all the creatures in the world should be turned into
Bears or Devils about Him, yet His conscience being comfortable, he is
undaunted and confide^t, and more then conqueror over the whole world, and ten
thousand Hells. But on the other side, if by reason of the reign of sin,
there be no rest there; if God be not there because of the abounding of
iniquity, what shall a man do then? Whither shall he fly, when the hand of
God has found Him out, and the swift Arrow of the Almighty sticks fast in his
side? He will fly, says that ancient Father, out of the Country into the
City; out of the streets into his House; out of his House into His chamber;
horror still dogging Him at the heels. And from His chamber, whither will he
go, but into the inmost Cabinet in his bosom, where his Conscience dwells?
And if he find there nothing but tumult and terror* but guiltiness,
confusion and cries of despair; which way will he then turn himself; Or
whither will he fly then? He must then, either fly from Himself, which is
utterly impossible; or else abide that torment, which is beyond all compass of
conceit or expression of tongue. For all the racks, says another, wheels,
wild horses, Poena autem vehemen^ and multo saevior illis. Qua^ and Coeaitius
gravis invenit, and Roadamanthus; Nocte ^i^que suum gestare in pecture te^^em.
hot pincers, scalding lead poured into the most tender, and sensible parts of
the body; yea, all the merciless, barbarous, and inhumane cruelties of the
holy house, are but flea-bitings, mere toys, and May-games, compared with the
torment, that an evil conscience will put a man to, when it is awakened.

3. A third sort, the worst of all and most pestilent, are those, who do not
only not labor in the time of harvest to treasure up comfortable provision
against days of dread, and mispend the Day of their visitation wickedly; but
also out of a transcendent strain of impiety, labor might and maine, to put
out and utterly extinguish the heavenly Sun, that creates this blessed day,
and makes the season of our spiritual harvest most glorious, and incomparable:
I mean to suppress and quench the saving light of a powerful Ministry,
wheresoever planted, and prevailing; under the sacred influence, and sovereign
heat whereof, all Gods hidden Ones are wont to gather that heavenly stock of
grace, Comforts of godliness, and good conscience, which is able to hold up
their heads invincibly in heavy times.

These are the vilest of men, and of the most Let us not be Scotners, lesters,
and Deriders; for that is the uttermost token and show of a Reprobate, of a
plain enemy to God in his wisdom. Hom. Of some places of Scriptures, by
which some take offense, P. 2.
forlorn hope: for they are unhappily transported with extremest malice, and
storm against the very means, which should sanctify them, and Men, which
should save them. They do not only make their own souls sure for damnation:
but also hinder the power of the Word all they can, (...). 1* Th^ssal. 2.16.
lest others should be saved. Whatsoever thou do, do not become one of
this damned crew: who heartily desire, that the Sun of sincere preaching were
quenched, and put out, tho it were with the blood of God^ faithfullest
Messengers; as did the M^n of Anathoth in Ieremies time. Ier. 11.19. 21. She
preferred John Bapt^st^ head before the half of Herod's kingdom, Mark. 6 2.
Herodias in John Baptist time, and that (...), rurs^s haec in se^psam

percelebrem illam concionem in Ecclesia recitavit, cujus exordiumest: Herodias
denuo insanire, denuo commoveri, denuo saltare pergi^: denuo ^^put Ioinn^s in
disco acc^pere quaerit Socra. Hist. Ecclesiast. Lib. 6. cap. 16.
other Herodias improperly called Eudoxia in John Chrysostomes time, and many
thousands, even within the Pale of the Church at all times. Above all, I say,
Beware of that crying sin of Let none marv^ll why I (...) med^le with (...),
especially in this time of peace and prosperity of the Gospel, as tho it were
unnecessary and unseasonable: For Aust^^ tells us truly: Illi maxim
perse^^untur Ecclesiam, qui ^^^re^^iani, nolunt been vivere. Per hos enim
opprohr^um habet Ecclesia, and ab his inimicitias sustine^, quando
corripiuntur, quando male vivere, non permusuntur, quando cum eis vel verbo
igitur, i^si, mala in suis ^ordibus meditantur, and erumpendi occasionem
requirunt. In Psalm. 30. page 205. Those especially persecute the Church* who
professing Christianity will not live graciously, etc.
persecuting the power of godliness, without which never any heart knew what
true comfort meant; Profession of the truth, without which Christ will not own
us at the last day; conscionable Ministers, under Whose painful labors, we
gather our spiritual and heavenly Store, against evil times in this harvest
of grace: And that either with thine heart, by hatred, malice, heart-burning;
with thy tongue, by slanders, scoffs, rash censures; with thine hand, by
supplanting, oppression, wrong; with thy purse, policy, power, mis-informing,
or any other way of vexing, or violence. If thou will needs be wicked, be so
more moderately; If there be no help, but thou Will to Hell, post not so
furiously; If nothing will-worke, but thou art wilfully bent to be damned, be
damned more tolerably. For Persecutours are transcendents in sin, and shall
hereafter be paid home proportionably. Be none of them for such reasons as
these.

1. All their malice, and rancour; all their bitter words and scornful jests;
all their bloody, merciless mischiefs, and machinations against the power of
preaching, and Gods people, strike immediately at the face of Jesus Christ.
Acts. 9.5. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And at the precious Ball, and
Apple of Gods own eye; Zech. 2 8. For he that touches you, touches the Apple
of His eye. God is our Shield, Psalm. 84.11. Now the Shield takes all the blows.

2. They are hunted many times with furies of conscience and extreme horror
even in this life. Pashur put blessed Jeremy in the stocks; but thereupon, He
had a new name given Him Magor-Missabib; Ier. 20.2.3.
Fear round about; He became a terror to Himself, and to all his friends.
Zedechiah smote faithful Micaiah upon the face; 1. King. 22.24.25.
but afterward according to that Prophetical commination, He was feign to run
from chamber to chamber, to hide himself. John Baptists head, which Herod cut
off, sat in the eye of the Tyrants conscience, with such griesly forms of
guiltiness, and blood; that when he heard of the great things done by Christ,
he was perplexed, and no doubt afraid, that John Baptist was risen from the
dead to be revenged upon Him. I have heard of a Man, who for a time did
furiously, and desperately set Himself against a Minister of God; labored
might, and maine, by all means to disgrace, and vex him; both by power, and
policy; by slanders, oppressions, malice, contempt. But at length, the Word so
got within Him, and hamperd Him; and the terrors of the Almighty took hold
upon Him with such un-resistable rage; that he came trembling and quaking unto
that man of God, whom he had so wickedly wronged; and durst not steer a foot
from him, for fear the Devil should take him away alive; or the earth open
her mouth, and swallow him up quick; or some other strange remarkable
judgment seize upon Him suddenly, and brand Him for a notorious Beast, and
cursed Castaway. So or to such sense he spoke.

3. Many of them come to very horrible, exempla^y, and woeful ends. Pharaoh
long since, by a dreadful confusion at the red Sea was as it were hanged up in
chains, a spectacle of terror for Persecutors, to all posterity. Antiochus
swelling with anger, and breathing out fire in his rage against the people of
God, did proudly protest, that He would come to Jerusalem, and make it a common
Burying place of the Jews: But the Lord Almighty, 1. Maccab. 9.
the God of Israel smot^ him with an incurable, and invisible Plague: for as
soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless
came upon him, and ^ore torments of the inner parts. -- So that the worms rose
up out of the body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and
pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all
his army. Acts 12.23.
Herod in the height of his hatred against the Gospel, and pride in
imprisoning and persecuting the Apostles, was eaten up of worms in a most
fearful prodigious manner. Gardener gaping for news of the dispatch of those
two blessed Martyrs of Jesus, Latimer and Ridley, at Oxford deferred his dinner
until three or four of the clock at afternoon, delighting more in drinking
the blood of the Saints, then in his ordinary food: But upon the return of
his Post, He fell merrily to his meat: And mark what followed: The bloody
Tyrant says the Story, Acts and Monuments, page 1787.
had not eaten a few bittes, but the sudden strok^ of God, His terrible hand
fell upon him in such sort, as immediately he was taken from the table, and so
brought to his bed, where he continued the space of fifteen days, in such
intolerable anguish and torments, that all that ^eane while, during those
fifteen days, he could not avoyde by order of urine or otherwise, any thing
that he received: Wh^^eby his body being miserably inflamed within (who had
inflamed so many good Martyrs before) was brought to ^ wretched end. For
further enlargement of this Point, look into the Stories of the primitive
Church, Acts and Monument^, Theater of Gods judgments.

4. A cry far louder, then the noise of many waters, or voice of greatest
thunder knocks continually, with strong importunity, at Gods just Tribunal for
a shower of fire and brimstone, and an horrible Tempest to be rained down upon
their heads* I mean, a cry of blood, wrongs, disgraces, and slanders,
wherewith they have laden the Saints of God. Rev. 6.10. And they cried with a
loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy, and true, do thou not judge, and
avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth!

5. They are the principal provokers of Gods wrath against a nation. Their
hateful heat, overflowing gall, and scornful carriage against Gods people,
does ripen apace His fiercest indignation; fill up full the vialls of His
vengeance, and draw down upon a kingdom a desperate, and final ruin without
all remedy. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and
mis-used Hi^ Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people,
till there was no remedy. 2. Chron. 36.16.

6. Their spiteful spirits being once thoroughly set on heat with this fire of
hell and infernal rage against the grace of God and His people, commonly
continue in fl^me and fury until their fearful and final confusion. And
they being once flesht, as it were, with the blood of the Saints, Nullus semel
ore receptus -- pollutas patitur sanguis mansuescere fauces.
at lest by scoffs and slanders (for even lewd and lying tongues are keen
razours, and sharp swords, scourges and scorpions that fetch blood) they feed
insatiably upon the damned sweetness of such supposed cursed revenge, until
they be seizd upon with irrecoverable ruin; and fall amongst the firers of
their malice, and Arch-persecutors of all Professors, the fiends of Hell. This
is my meaning: This pestilent and crying Sin of persecution is like the gulf
of drunkenness, which Austin compares to the Pit of Hell, into which, when a
man is once fallen, there is no redemption, or return. A Persecutour is rarely
or never ^eclaimde: Either by miracle or Ministry; mercy or misery. Fire from
Heaven falling upon the first Captain and His f^^y, did not fright the second
Captain and His fifty from pressing upon Elijah to apprehend him. 2. Kings,
1.10.11. The soldiers who came to take Jesus, as soon as He had said, I am
He, were strangely upon the sudden, stroke down to the ground. Ioh, 18.6.
and yet this miracle did never a whit mollify and abate the malice of the
Priests and Pharisees against Him. Not even the Mini^^ry of Christ Himself,
though He spoke as never Man spoke; Not that of Stephen, whose face appeared to
His Hearers, as it had been the face of an Angel; not that of the Apostles
freshly filled with the holy Ghost from heaven, did at all dis-enrage or ^ame
those fellows, which were possessed with this f^ule spirit of scornful
contradiction. See Luc. 4.28.29. And 16.14. Act. 7 54. And 2.13. Not all those
horrible miraculous plagues of Egypt, were able to quench Pharaohs fury
against the people of God* until he was choakt in the red Sea. No kindness
from David, though extraordinary, and matchless. 1. Sam. ^4 11. And ^6 9.
could turn Sa^ls heart from hunting him, as when One does hunt a Partridge in
the mountains.

And no marvel, tho they be not moved by all or any of these means; for
they scorn, persecute and contemn the very means, which should amend them,
and the only Men, who should convert them. Whether of the two, think you, is
likelier to recover? That man, who being dangerously sick; yet entertaines the
Physician kindly, and takes patiently what is prescribed: or He, who having a
Potion presented unto Him very sovereign for his recovery, throws the glass
against the wall, spils that precious Receipt, and drives the Physician out at
doors? Conceive proportionably; between the Persecutour, and the less
pestilent sinner, who meddles nor maliciously against the Ministry.

7. They are already in the pestilent Path, and very hie-way, that leads to
sin against the Holy Ghost. The horriblenesse, and height of which dreadful
villainy may bring upon them even in this life, impossibility of pardon. Matthew.
12.31.32. and liablenesse to that flaming judgment and ^iery indignation
threatened, Heb. 10.26. etc. And that they are Cum quotidie nostram
sanctificationem blasphemant, quid aliud blasphemant quam spiritum sanctum.
Aug. Tom. 10. par. 1. page 45.
growing toward this sin, if they be not quite gone that way, appears,
because they despitefully traduce; with much malice and mischief persecute the
very works of Grace, and graces of Gods Spirit shed into the hearts, and
shining in the lives of the children of light. 1. Ioh. 3.12. Psalm. 38.20. 1.
Pet. 4.4. If a man would drink, swear, swagger, revell, and roar with them:
If he durst be an Ignorant, an Usurer, a Sabbath-breaker, a Worldling, a doter
upon, and defender of heathnish superstitious customs; a practiser, or Patron
of Old anniversarie fooleries, and rotten vanities; an incloser, gamester,
good fellow, etc. Oh! then He should be the only Man with them; entertained
into their hearts and houses with all affectionate embracements of kindness
and acceptance: but if the same man, by the mercies of God, once begin to
break from them, and out of the snares of the Devil; to dis-rellish, and
detest his former ways of nature and naughtiness; to love and reverence the
most searching Ministry; to read the Scriptures, and best books; to sanctify
the Lords Day, to pray in his family; to renounce resolutely, His running with
them to the same excess of riot, to abandon and abominate their lewd and
licentious courses; In a word to turn Christian; Oh! then He is an arrant
Puritan, a Precision, an humorist, an Hypocrite, and all that naught is; even
as Et nulli nocentiores habentur, quam qui sunt ex omnibus innocents. Lactant.
lib. 5. Cap. 9.
bad, as the false tongues of the Devils Limbs can make a blessed Man. He was
a good fellow, will they say, but he is now quite gone: a proper man, and of
good parts, but his Puritanisme has Bonus vir Caj^s Seius, sed malus tantum
quia Christianus. Tertul. Apol. page 1.
marred all. While Paul humored the Pharisees, in persecuting and plaguing the
disciples of the Lord, He was a principal and much honored Man amongst them:
but when he turned on Christ's side, He was holden a pestilent-fellow, the
very (...). Act. 24.5.
plague. So that it is plain and palpable, whatsoever may be pretended to the
contrary, that those cursed Cains, dogged Doegs, and scoffing ^^maels, that set
themselves and spend their malice against the Ministers and people of God,
hare, slander, and persecute the very works of Grace, and graces of Gods
Spirit in them. Even their z^ale, holiness, hatred of sin* reformation, etc.
are an Eyesore, and heartsore to such hateful wretches, and Owls of Hell,
^ho cannot endure any heavenly light.

8. As stigmaticall Rogues burnt in the hand, curtal'd of their ears, branded
in the forehead, are in the Common wealth; so are Persecutors in the Church.
By mutual intelligence, and information of Gods people, or some more public
lasting record and Monunument of the Church, they have many times such a Mark
set upon them; that they carry it to their graves, yea to the judgment Seat
of God; that it may be known a sore-hand to that glorious Tribunal and all
the triumphant Church, what 2. Timot. 4.17. Ezekiel. 2.6.
beastly men, stinging Scorpions, and pricking thorn's they have been among^t
Gods Children, and in the sides of the Saints. Such a brand had Alexander the
Copper smith set upon him by Paul. 2. Tim. 4.14.15 And such a Brand was set
upon Diotrephes that m^litious prating companion, by Saint John. 3. Ioh 10. So
are those blood thirsty Tigers, Gardener, Bonner, and the rest of that cruel
litter, and persecuting pack, branded, that their names shall rot* and their
memories be hateful to the Worlds end. So too many in these times, though they
be very jolly fellows in their own conceits, adored as Idols, by their
flattering Dependants, applauded generally as the principal Patrones of
revelling and good-fellowship; ^et in the censure of the Saints, and by the
doom of divine wisdom, they are clearly known, and justly reputed enemies
of all righteousness, and Satan's special Agents to do mischief against the
Ministry.

9. And it is to be feared; they will find no mercy upon their Beds of death,
and in their last extremity, cry they never so loud, or promise they never so
fair. God in just indignation is wont to deal so with those, who drink up
iniquity like Water, without all sense or fear of a glorious dread^ull Majesty
above. See Ezekiel 8.18. with those, who refuse to stoop to Gods Ordinance, and
submit to the Scepter of Christ, when they are fairly invited by the
Ministry. See Prove. 1.24.28. Ier. 7.13.16. and 11.11. With great Ones, who
grind the faces of the poor. See Micah. 3 4. with abusers of the riches of
His goodness, and long suffering* See Romans 2.4 5. How much more do you
think, shall impenitent Persecutors be paid home in this kind? See 2.
Macchab. 9.13.17. There that great and cruel persecutor, Antiochus, being
seizd upon by an horrible sickness, promises very gloriously upon that his
last Bed; Besides many other strange reformations, even that he also, would
become a Jew himself, and go thorough all the World that was inhabited, and
declare the power of God. But for all this, hear what the I know the Book is
not of divine authority; and therefore the Place quoted, taken only from the
hand of an humane Historian. And so conceive of it; But we see the Authors
conceit of that wicked man. If any think, that God is said to have had no
mercy upon him, only in resp^ct of deliveran^e from his disease: Hear what
some say in the case. Antiochus was ind^ed re^lly and seriously grieved; and
acknowledged that his affliction was for His sins, lib. 1. cap 6. ^. 11. (...)
was not truly penitent for the offense committed against God, and his
neighb^^^, (...) his own calamity, and misery, and therefore could not obtain
mercy, to remision of (...) of the punishment: So also the damned in Hell,
know, and confess, that they are pan^she^ for their sins, but have not true
repentance, for their offense against God. Of this easure and gloss, let the
Authors render a reason themselves. In Antioche, says Cyprian, An^ichr^^us
expressus. De Exhort. Martyr ij. Cap. 11.
Writer of that story says of his spiritual state, and of Gods resolution
toward Him verse. 13. This wicked person prayed also unto the Lord, who would
now have no mercy on him.

10 All their spiteful speeches, scurrill sco^fes, pestilent lies, insolent
insultations, etc. are as so many Crowns of Glory and joy unto the heads, and
hearts of all persecuted patient Professors. 1. Pet. 4.14. Act. 5.41. Job.
3.36. (So that they infinitely miss the malicious Mark, their revengefull
humors would gladly hit, the hurt and heartbreaking of those, they so cruelly
and cunningly hunt with much rancour and hate.) And not only so, but most
certainly hereafter, if they die not like drunken Nabal, and their hearts
become as stones in their breasts, upon their Beds of death they will all, tho
now passing from them, with much bitterness of Spirit, and without all
remorse, turn into so many envenomed stings, and biting scorpions, unto their
own consciences, and know upon their hearts, with extremest horror.

11. The whole body of the militant Church, join all as one man with a strong
concurrent importunity at the Throne of grace; and with one heart and spirit
constantly continue there, such piercing prayers against all stubborn
impenitent scorners; all incurable, implacable persecutours, as the people of
God have bin wont to pour out in such cases, as Lament. 3.59. etc. O Lord!
thou have seen my wrong, judge thou my cause. Thou have seen all their
vengeance, and all their imaginations against me. Thou have heard their
reproach, O Lord, and all their imaginations against me: The lips of those that
rose up against me, and their devise against me all the day. Behold their
sitting down, and their rising up, I am their music. Render unto them a
recompense, O Lord, according to the work of their hands. Give them sorrow of
heart, thy curse unto them. Persecute and destroy them, in anger, from under
the heavens of the Lord. Now I would not be in that Man's case, against whom,
Gods people complain upon good ground at that just and highest Tribunal, one
half hour; for the imperial crown, and command of all the kingdoms of the
earth: for who knows, whether just at that time, the righteous Lord for his
children's sake, and safety may rain upon such a man's head, snares, fire and
brimstone, and an horrible tempest.

12. And the prayers of the Saints poured out in the bitterness of their
souls vexed continually with their malicious cruelties, and cruel mockes, are
means many times to bring Persecutours to an untimely end, to knock them
down before their time. Do not you think, that the faithful Jews at
Jerusalem, hearing of Antiochus marching toward them, like an evening Wolf,
to drink up their blood, had presently recourse unto Gods righteous Throne
with strong cries, to stay his rage? And do you not think, that those very
prayers drew down upon him that horrible, and incurable plague, whereupon He
died a miserable death in a strange Country in the Mountains? Herod, for any
thing we know, might have lived many a fair Day longer, if he had dealt
fairly with the Apostles of Christ. But putting One to the sword. Act. 12.2.
And another in prison. verse. 4. He put the Church to their prayers. Est
quaedam precum omnipotentia.
verse. 5. Which prayers, for there is a certain omnipotency of prayer, as
Luther was wo^t to say, did create full soon those vermin, that eat him up
horribly in the height of his pride. verse. 23. The Cum* Arrius Constantinopoli
in Ecclesiae communionem recipiendus esset, Alexander e^us urb^s Episcopus,
to^a nocte in templo prostratus oravit Deum, ut Ecclesiam praesenti periculo
liberaret, and de Arrio blasphemiarum poenas reposceret. Postridie Arrius m^gna
suorum caterva in templum deductus, inter cundum corripitur horribilibus
ventris torminibus, laxat^que alvo petit latrinam, in qua sedens vn^ cum
excremen^is effudit jecur, intestina, impuramque animam, sortitus soedum,
suaque impietate dignum exitum. Sozom. lib. 2. cap. 28. Bucol. Anno Christi.
336.
Ecclesiastical story reports, that the loathsome, and dreadful end of
Arrius, that execrable enemy to Jesus Christ, was hastened by the prayers of
the good and orthodoxe Bishop Alexander, who wrastled with God in earnest
deprecations against him all the night before. Do you not think, that
Gardener went sooner into his Grave for his cruelty toward Professors of the
truth, by their groans against him, and by the cry of the blood of that
glorious Pair of Martyrs at Oxford, which he so insatiably thirsted after?
Let all those then, that tread in these men's paths, tremble at their ends. And
if no better motive will mollify their doggednesse, yet at least, let their
love unto the world, themselves, and sensual ways, take them off and
restrain them from this persecuting rage; least it set on work the prayers of
Gods people, and so they be taken away before their time, and cut off from a
temporary supposed heaven of earthly pleasures, to a true everlasting Hell of
unspeakeable torments, sooner then otherwise they should.

13. The hearts, and tongues of all good men, and friends to the Gospel, are
filled with much glorious When the wicked perish, there is shouting. Prove.
11.10.
joy, and heartiest songs of thankesgiving, at the downfall of every raging
incurable Opposite; when the revenging hand of God has at length to the
singular advancement of the glory of his justice, singled out, and paid home
remarkeably, any impenitent Persecutour, and implacable enemy. See for this
purpose, The song of ^oses, Exodus 15. Of Deborah, Judges 5. The Jews feasting
after the hanging of Haman; Esther. 9 17. Psa. 52.6.9 And 58.10. And 79.13. 1.
Macca. 13.51. (Only, let the heart of Gods child be watchful over it self
with a godly jealousy in this Point. That His rejoicing be, because Gods
justice is glorified, His Church delivered, Satan's kingdom weakened, etc. not
only for his own ease and end, for any personal or particular by-respect.)
Now it is an heavy case: A man, in His short abode upon earth to behave
himself, so like a dogged Curre, and incarnate Devil, that all good men are
and ought to be passingly glad, when he is gone.

In this Point I comprise and conclude, all sorts of Persecutours: Of which
some are professed and open, as Bonner and Gardener, and many such morning
Wolves: Some Politic and reserved, who many times are the more pernicious.
For of all manner of malice, and ill will, that is most execrable, deadly, and
does the most hurt, which like a Serpent in the fair green grass, lies
lurking in the flatterings and fawnings of a sleering countenance. Which kisses
with Judas, and kills with Ioab: entertaines a man with outward forms of
complement, and courtesy, but would, if it durst or might, stabbe Him in at the
fifth rib, that he should never rise again. When a man's words to thy face,
are as soft as oil or butter; but his thoughts toward thee, composed all of
blood and bitterness; of gall and gunpowder. Some are notorious villains, as
many times in many places, the most desperate blasphemers, stigmaticall
Drunkards, rotten whore mongers, cruel usurers, and fellows of such infamous
rank, are as so many bloody Goades in the sides of Gods servants; and the
only Men to pursue all advantages against the faithfullest Ministers: Some are
of more sober carriage, fair conditions and seeming devotion; Act* 13.50. Some
are the basest fellows, the most abject and contemptible vagabonds, and the
very refuse of all the Rascals in a Country. This we may see by Jobs
complaint. Cap 30. But now, says He, they that are younger then I, have me
in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of
my flock. -- They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
were viler then the earth. And now am I their song, yea, I am their By Word.
And in David's: Psa. 35. Yea, the Abiects gathered themselves against me, etc.
and I was the song of the drunkards, Psalm. 69.12. And in the Persecutours of
Paul, Act. 17. But the Jews which bel^eved not, moved with envy, took unto
them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, etc. Some again are men of
place and parts. As the same David complains in the same place. They that sit
in the gate, speak against me. Haec forma praecipue notat and laxat eos, qui
e^ant in aliqua dignitate seu authoritate: uterant judices, and seniores
plebis, qut sedere, and convem^e solebant in loco publicorum judiciorum, ubi de
R^p. and rebus sorysageadum erat. Iudicia enim exercebantur inportis, Ruth. 4.
Putatis hoc, fratres, Christo tantummodo con^^gi^se? Quotidie illi in membris
ejus contingit, quando forte necesse erit servo Dei prohi^er^eb ietat^s, and
luxurias in aliquo velfundo, vel oppido, ubi non auditum suerit verbum Dei.
August. in Psalm. 69.
That is, men in high rooms and of great authority.

And as all sorts of Persecutours, so I comprehend all kinds of persecution.

1. By hand; as did Herod. Act. 12. Julian, Bonner, etc.

2. With tongue; by mocking, Galat. 4.24. compared with Genesis 21.9. See also
Psalm. 69.20. Hebr. 11.36. By slandering, even in reporting true things
maliciously to the prejudice of Gods children. Psalm. 52. By reproaching and
reviling. Zeph. 2.8. By insulting with insolent speeches. Ezech. 36.2. and 26.2.

3. In heart; by hatred, Ezech. 35.5. By rejoicing in the downfall or disgrace
of the Saints. Ezech. 35.6.

4. In gesture; Ezech. 25.6. Because thou have clapped thy hands, and stamped
with the feet, etc. Behold therefore, I will stretch out mine hand upon thee,
etc. Take heed of so much, as looking sour upon, or brow-beating a servant of
Christ, lest thou smart for it.

Look upon the quoted Places, and you shall see Offenders in any of these
kinds, plagued and paid home as Persecutours of Gods people.

And thus let such extremely Wicked men be frighted from persecuting any way,
those Men or Means, which are appointed and sanctified, to furnish us with
spiritual store and strength against the days of evil.

Ob. But against that, which has been said in this Point for the singularity,
and sovereignty of grace and good conscience to support the Spirit of a Man in
evil times, to keep it calm in the most tempestuous assaults, and conquering
over all comers, it may be objected, and some may thus cavil.

Men, who never were, or ever did desire to be acquainted with Gods grace or
good men, express sometimes, and represent to Bystanders an invincible
stoutnesse, much boldness and bravenesse of mind in times of greatest
extremity, and under most exquisite tortures; and therefore it seems not to
be peculiar to the Saints, and the privilege of Gods Favorites alone, to
stand unshaken in stormy times, undaunted in distress, and comfortable amidst
the most desperate confusions?

Answ. I answer; Such confidence is only in the face, not in the heart;
enforced, not kindly; affected, not effectual; not springing from the sole
Fountain of all sound and lasting comfort in humane Souls; sense of our
reconciliation to God in Christ; but from some other odd accidental Motives;
from Weak and unworthy grounds.

1. In some, from an ambitious affectation of admiration and applause, for
extraordinary undauntednesse of spirit, and high resolution. It is reported of
an Irish Traitor, that lying in horrible anguish upon the Wheel, an Engine of
cruellest torture, with his body bruised, and his bones broken, asked his
friend standing by, whether he changed countenance at all, or no. Affecting
more as it seems, an Opinion of prodigious manliness, and unconquerablenesse
in torment; then affected with the raging pains of a most terrible execution.

2. In others, from a strong, stirring persuasion, and consciousnesse of the
honesty, and honor of some civil cause, for which they suffer. But fortitude
in this case, does not arise, from any inspired religious vigor or heavenly
infusions; but from the severer instigations of natural conscience, and
acquired manhood of a mere moral Puritan. Many such moral Martyrs have
been found amongst the more generous, and well-bred heathen. It is storied of
a brave and valiant Captain, who had long, manfully, and with incredible
courage with-stood Dionysius the elder in defense of a City; that He
sustained with strange patience, and height of spirit the merciless fury of
the Tyrant, and all his barbarous cruelties: most unworthy of Him, that
suffered them, but most worthy him that inflicted the same. First the Tyrant
told him; how the day before, he had caused his son, and all his kinsfolks to
be drowned. To whom the Captain stoutly out staring Him, answered nothing, but
that they were more happy then himself, by the space of one day. Afterward he
caused him to be stripped, and by his executioners, to be taken, and dragged
through the City most ignominiously; cruelly whipping Him, and charging Him
besides, with outrageous and contumelious speeches: All which notwithstanding,
as One no whit dismaide He ever showed a constant, and resolute heart. And
wit^ ^ cheerful, and bold countenance went on still, lowdly recounting the
honorable* and glorious cause of His death; which was, that He would never
consent to yield his Country into the hands of a cruel Tyrant. With such
stoutnesse did even mere moral virtue steel the ancient Roman spirits, that
in worthy defense of their liberty; for preservation of their Country, or
other such noble ends; They indifferently contemned gold, silver, death,
torture; and whatsoever else miserable worldlings hold dear, or dismal.

3. In some, from an extreme hardness of heart, which makes them senseless
and fearelesse of shame, misery, or any terrible thing. This we may sometimes
observe in notorious malefactors. A long rebellious, and remorselesse
continuance, and custom in sin* raging infections from their roaring
companions* a furious pursuit of outrages, and blood; Satan's ho^ iron searing
their consciences, and Gods just curse upon their fearful, and forlorn
courses, so fill them with foole-hardinesse, and with such a ferall
disposition, that they are desperately hardened against all affronts, and
dis-asters. So that tho such savage-minded, and marble-hearted men be to pass
through the streets, as spectacles of abhorrednesse and scorn, as hateful
monsters, and the reproach of Mankind; to be thrown into a Dungeon of
darkness, and discomfort, and there to be laden with cold irons, coldness, and
want; from thence to be hurried to that loathed Place of execution, and there
to die a Dogs death, as they say; and finally to fall immediately and
irrecoverably into a Lake of fire: yet I say for all this, out of a desperate
hard-heartednesse, they seem still to be in heart; and to represent to the
beholders, a great deal of undauntednesse, and neglect of danger in their
carriage, and countenances. O the prodigious Rock, into which the stone in a
graceless heart may grow; both in respect of desperateness in sinning, and
sense-lesnesse in suffering!

4. In others, from an enraged thirst after humane praise, and immortal fame,
as they call it. Which may be so prevalent in them, and transport them with
such a vainglorious ambition this way; that it may carry them with much
seeming insensibility, affected patience, and artificial courage through the
terrors, and tortures, of a very violent, and Martyr like death. Hear what
Austin says to this Point, Putatis Catholicos defuisse aut deesse posse, qui
causa humanae gloriae paterentur? Si non essent hujusmodi homines, non d^^ere^
Apostolus, si tradidero corpus meum, ut ardeam, charitatom au^em non habeam,
nihil mihi prodest. Sci^bat ergo esse posse quosda, q^i hoc jactatione
^acerent, non dilectione. August. in Psalm. 44. page 474.

This humor also haunted the Heathen, amongst whom the most wicked did in some
sort desire to leave some remembrance of themselves to posterity: Witness that
unknown fellow, who of set purpose did burn the Temple of Diana in Ephesus;
who being demanded wherefore he did it, answere^, that he determined by some
notable villainy (seeing by virtue he could not) to leave some memory behind
him after his death. Hence it was, that sometimes they would adventure
desperately, and pass through, with extraordinary courage many corporal
afflictions, for praise of men; or to be any ways famous in following ages.


Think ye there never were any Catholics, or that now there may not be
some, that would suffer only for the praise of men? If there were not such
kind of men, the Apostle would not have said, Though I give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, I am nothing. He did know right well, that there
might be some, which would do it out of vaineglory and self-love, not for
divine love, and the glory of God. O the bottomless depth of Hellish
Hypocrisy, which lies hid in our corrupt hearts! O the blind and perverse
thoughts of foolish men! O the murderous malice of that old red Dragon, which
exercises such horrible cruelty both upon our bodies and souls!

5. In some, from false grounds of a supposed good estate to Godward; from an
unsound persuasion of their present spiritual well-beeing, and future
welfare. Such Pharisees, foolish Virgins, and formal Professors, are to be
found in all Ages of the Church, especially, in the fairest, and most
flourishing days thereof, and when the Gospel has the freest passage, who
thus many times, in the great it of all earthly extremities, even upon their
Beds of death represent to all about them from a groundless presumption of
being reconciled unto God, a great deal of confidence, resolution, and many
glorious expectations. Upon a partial survay, and perusal of their time past,
not stained perhaps with any great enormities, notoriousnesse, or infamous
sin; out of a vainglorious consciousnesse unto themselves, of their many
good parts, general graces, good deeds, and plausiblenesse with the most; by
reason of a former obstinated distaste and prejudice against sincerity, and the
power of godliness, as tho it were unnecessary singularity and peevishness;
and it may be, confirmed also unhappily in their spiritual selfe-cousenage,
by the unskilful, and unseasonable palliations, I mean mis-applications of
some abused promises unto their un-humbled Souls, from some dawbing Ministers,
Ezekiel. 13 11. Isai. ^.15. The Prophet which tells lies is the tail. Ezekiel.
13.10.
a generation of vilest men, excellent Idiots in the mystery of Christ, and
merciful Cutthroates of many miserable deluded Souls, to whom they promise
life and peace, when there is no peace toward, but terrible things even at
hand, tumbling of garments in blood, Isai. 9.5.
noise of damned Souls, and tormenting in Hell for ever; I say from such false
and failing grounds as these, they many times in that last extremity, (the Lord
not revealing unto them the unsoundnesse of their spiritual estate, and
rottenness of their hopes) demean themselves chearefully, and comfortably, as
tho they were presently to set foot into Heaven, and to lay hold upon eternal
life; but God he knows, without any just cause or true ground. For
immediately upon the departure of the Soul from the Body, shall they hear
that woeful doom from Christ's own mouth, as Himself has told us
beforehand, Depart from me; Matthew. 7.23.
I never knew you. Such men as these, having been formerly acquainted with, and
exercisde in the outward forms and complements of Religion, are wont at such
times to entertain their visitants and Bystanders, with many goodly speeches,
and Scripture-Phrases, representing their contempt of the World, Willingness
to dye, readiness to forgive all the World, Hope to be saved, desire to be
dissolved, and be in Heaven, etc. They may cry aloude with much formal
confidence, Many having served their appetites all their lives, presume to
think, that the severe Comma^dements of the All-powerfull God, were given but
in sport; and that the short breath, which we draw, when death presses us, if
we can but fashion it, to the sound of mercy, is sufficient: O quam multi,
says a reverend Father, cum hac sp^ ad aeternos labores and bella descendunt.
Rawl. in the Preface to His History of the World. Many conceit as great an
efficacy in these five words, Lord have mercy upon me, spoken with their last
breath, for their translation of their souls into heaven, as the Papists do
of their five words of consecration, for the transubstantiation of their Host.
Dike.
Lord, Lord, open to us; mercy, mercy, in the name of Christ, Lord Jesus
receive our spirits, etc. which last eiaculations, did they spring from a truly
broken, penitent, and heavenly heart, and were they the periods, and
conclusions of a well-spent life, might blessedly break open with unresistable
power the gates of Heaven; unlocke the rich treasures of immortality, and fill
the departing Soul, with the shining beams of Gods glorious presence: but
unto them such goodly and glorious speeches are but as so many catchings and
scrablings of a Man over head in water: He struggles, and strives for hold to
save Himself; but He graspes nothing but water; it is still water, which He
catches; and therefore sinkes and drownes.

6. In others, from a mis-guided headstrong Zeal in will worship; an
impotent, peremptory conceit, that they suffer in the cause of God, and for the
glory of Religion. This unhallowed fury possessed many Hereretikes of old. Upon
this false ground, the Osiander. Cent. 4 page 174.
Donatists in the fourth Century after Christ offered themselves willingly, and
suffered death most courageously. And so did the Epiphan. Her. 80.
Euphemites, who for the multitude of their supposed Martyrs, would needs be
called Martyrians. Stories also tell us, Many of the Turks ^ight by turning
Christians, have saved their lives, and would not, choosing rather to dye, (and
as i^ is reported) also to kill themselves, then to forsake their damnable
superstition. Hist. of the Turks, page 284. The Assasins are a company of most
desperate and dangerous me^ among the Mahometans, who strongly deluded with the
blind zeal of their superstition, and accounting it meritorio^s, by any means
to kill any great enemy of their religion; for the performance thereof, as men
prodigal of their lives, desperately adventure themselves unto all kind of
dangers. Histor. of the Turks, page 120.
that Turks, Tartars and Mores both fight and dye most bravely and resolutely
for the blasphemous opinions of Mahomet. And that the Assasins, a company of
bloody Villains, and desperate Cut-throates, who would without all scruple or
fear undertake to dispatch any Man, whom their General commanded them to
murder, dyed oftentimes with great constancy and un-dismaiednesse: And this
they accounted a special point of Religion. But especially at this Day, the
Popish Pseudo-martyrs, indeed true Traitors, are stark mad with this
superstitious rage. First, they drink full deep of the golden cup of
abominable fornication in the hand of the great Whore. Immediately whereupon
they grow into an unsatiable and outrageous thirst after the blood of Souls,
empoysoning them with the doctrine of Devils: And also after the blood of
whomsoever withstands their accursed superstitions, even tho they wear
Imperial Crowns upon their Heads; by plotting, and practicing treasons,
parricides, assasinates, empoysonings, ruins of whole Nations, barbarous
Massacres, blowing up of Parliaments* and a world of bloody mischiefs, which
cast an inexpiable stain, and obloquy upon the innocence of Christian
Religion. At last, they come to Tyburne, or some other Place of just execution;
and then they will needs bear the world in hand, that they are going toward
Heaven, to receive a Crown of Martyrdom. They seem there already to triumph
extraordinarily, and to contemn tortures: with an affected bravery, they
trample upon the Tribunals of Justice, kiss the instruments of death, in sign
of happiness at hand; and throw many resolute, and rejoicing speeches, amongst
the people as tho they had one foot in Heaven already. When alas! poor,
blind, mis-guided Souls, while they thus wilfully and desperately abandon
their lives upon a groundless, and graceless conceit, that they shall become
crowned Martyrs; they are like a Man, who lying asleep upon an high and steep
Rock, dreams that He is created a King, guarded with a goodly train of
ancient Nobles, furnished with many princely Houses, and stately Palaces,
enriched with the Revenewes, Majesty, and Magnificence of a mighty Kingdom,
attended with all the pleasures, His heart could desire, etc. But starting up
upon the sudden, and leaping for joy; falls headlong, and irrecoverably into
the raging Sea; and so in liew of that imaginary happiness, He vainly
grasped in a dream, He destroies Himself, and loses that little real
comfort, He had in this miserable life. That damned pair of incarnate Devils,
the English Fawkes and French Ravillac; the one, after that in the Popes cause,
He had embrued His hands in the Royal blood of a mighty King, and the
greatest Warrior upon Earth; The other having done His utmost to blow up at
once, the glory, power, wisdom; the Religion, peace, and posterity of the
most renowned State under the Heavens; were both prodigiously bold, confident,
peremptory. But was this courage think you inspired into them, by the Lion of
the Tribe of Judah, already triumphant in the Heavens, or by that roaring
Dragon of the bottomless Pit? A man of an understanding, impartial,
discerning spirit, would scarcely wish a clearer demonstration of the Truth,
and Orthodoxnes of our Religion, then to mark the different Ends of our
blessed Martyrs in Q. Mary's time, and those Popish Traitors, which are
sometimes executed amongst us. They both ordinarily at their Ends express a
great deal of confidence: But in the Pseudo-Catholicks Antichristian Martyrs,
it is so enforced, artificial, ambitious, affected; Their speeches so cunning,
and composed upon purpose to seduce the simple; Their last behavior ^o plotted
beforehand, and formally acted; Their prayers so unhearty, plodding and
perfunctory; Their whole carriage so unspirituall, and unlike the Saints of
God, discovering, neither former acquaintances with the mysteries of true
sanctification, nor those present feeling elevations of spirit, which are wont
to fill the Souls, which are ready to enter into the Joys of Heaven; that to
a spiritual eye, to a man verst in the purity, and power of godliness, it is
most clear, that their comfort in such cases, is of no higher strain, nor
stronger temper, then the moral resolution of an Heathen, and headstrong
conceit of Heresy can represent, or reach unto. It is otherwise with the true
Martyrs of Jesus, slain most cruelly by that great Whore, the MOTHER of
HARLOTS, drunken with a world of innocent blood, as with sweet Wine: As we may
see and feel in that glorious Martyriology of our Saints, in the merciless
times of Queen Mary. The constant profession, and power of our most true, and
ever-blessed Religion did create such an holy, and humble Majesty in their
carriages; such a deal of Heaven, and sober undantednesse in their
countenances; such joyful springings, and spiritual ravishments in their
hearts; such grace, and powerful peircings in their speeches; such zeal, and
hearty meltings in their prayers; such triumphant, and heavenly exultations
amid the flames; that it was more then manifest, both to Heaven and Earth; to
Men and Angels, that their Cause, was the Cause of God; their Murderer, that
Man of sin; their blood, the seed of the Church; their Souls, the Jewels of
Heaven; and their present passage, the right and ready way, to that unfading
and most glorious Crown of Martyrdom. That which in fiction, was fathered
upon Father Campion, was most true of every one of our true Martyrs: That every
one might say, with heavy heart that stood:

Here speaks a Saint, here dies a Lamb, here flows the guiltless blood.



Thus you have heard, upon what weak props and sandy foundations that
confidence stands, and is built, which carnal men seem to lay hold upon with
great bravery in times of trouble, and distress But the comfort which sweetly
springs from that spirit, I speak of, supported, out of special favor, and
interest, by the hand of God, All-sufficient, and the unconquerable calmnesse
of a good conscience is grounded upon a Rock; upon which, tho the rain
descends, the floods come, the winds blow, the tempests beat; yet it stands
like Mount Zion, sure, sober, strong, lasting, impregnable. Nay, Vir pius ex
peri^culis vires majores colligit. Eos non vis temporis, non Principis terror,
non oration, non invidia, no^ metus, no accusator, non calummator, non

it is of that heavenly metal, and divine temper, that it ordinarily gathers
vigor and puissance from the worlds rage; and grows in strength and
resolution together with the increase of all iniust oppositions: Persecutions,
and resistance serve as a provocation, and seasoning to it is sweetness. It is
not enforced, formal, artificial, affected, furious, desperate, misgrounded,
ambitious, upon an humor, in the face only, only in hot blood, out of a
vainglorious pang, etc. Such may be found in Aliens, and resolute
reprobates. It were nothing worthy, if strangers might meddle with it: If Men
or Devils, or the whole World could take it from us; If it were sustained only
by any created power, or arm of flesh. This Pearl that I praise, and persuade
unto, is of an higher price, and more transcendent power, then any unregenerate
Man can possibly compass, or comprehend. It has for it is seat, a sanctified
Soul; for the Fountain of it is refreshing, the Spirit of all comfort; for
it is foundation, the favor of God; for it is Warrant, the promises of Amen, the
faithful, and true Witness; for it is object, an immortal Crown; for it is
continuance, the prayers of all the Saints; for it is companions, inward peace,
invincible courage, an holy security of mind; for it is end and perfection,
fullness of joy, and pleasures at Gods right hand for evermore. In a word, this
courageous comfort, and true nobleness of spirit, which dwells in the heart of
the true-hearted Christian does differ as much from, and as far surpasses all
the groundless confidences of what carnal men, or religious counterfeits
soever; as the real possession of gold, an imaginary dream of gold; as the
true natural, lively Grape, which glads the heart, a painted juycelesse Grape,
which only feeds the eye* as a strong, and mighty Oak, rooted deeply in the
earth, which no storm or tempest can displant or overthrow, a Stake in a dead
hedge, or Staff stuck lightly into the ground, which every hand may snatch
away, or blast of wind supplant, and overthrow.

Secondly, the trouble of a wounded conscience, is further amplified by it is
Attribute, intolerablenesse. But a wounded Spirit who can bear? Whence, note;

Doctr. That the torture of a troubled Conscience is intolerable.

Reas. 1. In all other afflictions, only the Arm of flesh is our adversary;
we contend but with Creatures at most; we have to do but with Man, or at
worst, with Devils: but in this transcendent misery, we conflict immediately
with God Himself: Frail Man with Almighty God; sinful Man with that most
holy God, Habac 1.13. Nahum 1.6.
Whose eyes are purer then to behold evil, and who cannot look upon iniquity.
Who then can stand before his indignation? Who can abide in the fierceness of
his anger? When his fury is powered out like fire, and the Rocks are thrown
down by Him: When he comes against a man as a Bear that is bereaved of her
Whelps, Hosea 13.8.
torent the very caul of His heart, and to devour him like a Lion. No more
then the driest stubble can resist the fierest flame; the ripe Corn, the
Mowers sharpest sithe; or a garment, the Moath: no more, nay infinitely less
can any power of Man or Angel withstand the mighty Lord of Heaven and Earth,
when He is angry for Sin. Psalm. 39.11.
When thou, says David, with rebukes correctest man for iniquity, thou as a
Sed primo intuitu absurda videri posset comparatio Dei cum tinea. Quid enim

non aliter tamen occulata ejus maledictione consumi reprob^s, actinea caeco

Moath make his beauty to consume. Alas! when a poor polluted wretch, upon
some special illumination by the Word, or extraordinary stroke from the rod,
does once begin to behold Gods frowning face against Him, in the pure Glass of
His most holy Law; and to feel divine justice by an invisible hand, taking
secret vengeance upon his conscience; His heavy heart immediately melts away in
his breast, and becomes as water. He faints and fails, both in the strength of
his body, and stoutnesse of his mind. His bones, the pillars, and
Master-timber of his earthly Tabernacle, are presently broken in pieces, and
turned into rottenness: His spirit the eye and excellency of his Soul, which
should illighten, and make lightsome the whole Man, is quite put out, and
utterly overwhelmed, with excess of horror, and flashes of despair. O this
is it, which would not only crush the courage of the stoutest son of Adam,
that ever breathed upon earth; but even break the back of the most glorious
Angel, that did ever shine in Heaven, should He lift up but one rebellious
thought against his Creator! This alone is able to make the tallest Cedar in
L^banon, the strongest Oak in Basan; I mean the highest look, and the
proudest heart; the most boisterous Nimrod, or swaggering Belshazzar, to bow
and bend, to stoop and tremble, as the leaves of the forest, that are sh^ken
with the wind.

2. In all other adversities, a man is still a friend unto himself, favors
himself, and reaches out his best considerations to bring in comfort to his
heavy heart. But in this, He is a scourge to Himself, at war with Himself,
an enemy to Himself. He does greedily and industriously fetch in as much
matter, as he can possibly, both imaginary and true, to enlarge the rent, and
aggravate his horror. He gazes willingly in that false glass, which Satan is
wont in such Cases, to set before Him; wherein by his Hellish malice He makes
an infinite addition both to the already un-numbred multitude, and to the too
true heinousness of his sins; and would feign, if He will be lead by his
lying cruelty, mis-represent to his affrighted imagination, every Gnat as a
Camel; every Moate as a Molehill; every Molehill as a Mountain; every
lustful thought as a Sodomiticall villainy; every idle word as a desperate
blasphemy; every angry look as an actual bloody murder; every intemperate
passion, as an inexpiable provocation; every distraction in holy duties as a
damnable rebellion; every transgression against light of conscience, as a sin
against the holy Ghost, etc. Nay, in this amazedness of spirit, and
disposition to despair, He is apt even of his own accord, and with great
eagerness, to arm every several sin, as it comes into his mind with a
particular bloody sting, that it may strike deep enough, and stick fast
enough in His already grieved Soul. He imployes and improoves, the
excellency, and utmost of His learning, understanding, wit, memory, Sed

to argue with all subtilty, with much Sophistry against the pardonablenes of
his sins, and possibility of salvation. He wounds even his wounds, with a
conceit, they are incurable, and vexes his very vexations, with refusing to be
comforted. Not only crosses, afflictions, temptations, and all matter of
coffeehouse; but even the most desirable things also in this life, and those
which minister most outward comfort; Wife, It is said of the same Spira, that

about Him; whatsoever He thinks upon, remembers, hears, sees, turn all to
his torment. No marvel then, tho the terror of a wounded conscience be so
intolerable.

3. As the exultations of the Soul; and spiritual refreshments do
incomparably surpass, both in excellency of Object, and sweetness of
apprehension all pleasures of sense, and bodily delights: so afflictions of the
Soul, and spiritual pangs do infinitely exceed, both in bitterness of
sense, and intension of sorrow the most exquisite tortures, can possibly be
inflicted upon the Mul^o saeviorlongeque atrocior est anuni* quam corporis

Body For the Soul is a spirit, very subtle, quick, active, stirring, all
life, motion, sense, feeling; and therefore far more capable and
apprehensive, of all kinds of impressions, whether passions of pleasure, or
inflictions of pa^^e.

4. This extremest of miseries, a wounded spirit, is tempered with such strong,
and strange ingredients of extraordinary fears; Ier. 20 4. Prove 28 1. Levit.
26 37. Psalm. 53^.
that it makes a man a terror to himself, and to all his friends: To flee
when none pursues, at the sound of a shaken leaf: To tremble at his own
shadow; to be in great fear, where no fear is: Besides the insupportable
burden of too many true and causefull terrors, it fills His dark and
dreadful Fancy with a world of fained horrors, ghastly apparitions, and
imaginary Hells, which notwithstanding, have real stings, and impresse true
tortures upon his trembling and woeful heart. It is empoysoned with such
restless anguish, and desperate pain, that tho life be most sweet, and Hell
most horrible; yet it makes a man wilfully to abandon the one, and willingly to
embrace the other, that He may be rid of it is rage. Hence it was, that Judas
preferred an Halter and Hell, before his present horror. That Spira said
often, (what heart quakes not to hear it?) that He envied Sae^e dixit

asked, Whether He feared more fearful torments after this life: Yes, said
He: But I desire nothing more, then to be in that place, where I shall expect
no more. Expectation, as it seems of future, did infinitely aggravate and
enrage His already intolerable torture.

5. The Heathens, who had no fuller sight of the foulness of sin, or more
smarting sense of divine vengeance for it, then the light of natural
conscience was able to afford and represent unto them; yet were wont in
fiction to shadow out in some sort, and intimate unto us, the insufferable
extremities of a mind troubled in this kind; by hellish furies, following
malefactors with burning firebrarnds, and flames of torture: What understanding
then is able to conceive, or tongue to report, in what case that sinful
conscience must needs be, when it is once awakened; which besides, the notions
of natural light, has also, the full Sun of Gods sacred Word, and that pure
Eye, which is ten thousand times brighter then the Sun, and cannot look upon
iniquity, to irradiate and enrage it to the height of guiltiness, and depth of
horror? Both heart and tongue; Man and Angel must let that alone for ever.
For none can take the true estimate of this immesurable spiritual misery, but
he that can comprehend the length, and breadth of that infinite unresistable
wrath, which once implacably enkindled in the bosom of God, burns to the very
bottom of Hell, and there creates the extremity and endlesnesse of all those
un-expressable torments, and fiery plagues, which afflict the Devils and damned
Souls in that horrible Pit.

6. Not only the desperate cries of Cain, Judas, Latomus, cum ex ambitione

Latomus, and many other such miserable men of forlorn hope, but also the
woeful complaints even of Gods own dear Children discover the truth of this
Point, to wit, the terrors and intolerablenesse of a wounded Conscience. Hear
how rufully three ancient Worthies in their times wrastled with the wrath of
God in this kind. I reckoned till morning, says Hezekiah, that as a Isai.

mourned like a Dove. Thou Job 13 26.

strangling, and death rather then my life. Tho God in mercy preserves his
servants from the monstrous and most abhorred Act of selfe-murder; yet in some
melancholic mood, horror of mind, and bitterness of spirit, they are not
quite freed from all impatient wishes that way, and sudden suggestions
thereunto. Psalm. 32.3, 4.
My bones waxed old, says David, through my roaring all the day long. Day and
night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of
Summer. Thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presses me sore. There
is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger: neither is there any rest
in my bones, because of my sin. For mine iniquities are gone over my head: as
an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. -- I am troubled, I am bowed down
greatly; I go mourning all the day long. -- I am feeble, and sore broken. I
have roared by reason of the disquj^tnesse of my heart. Hear also, into what a
depth of spiritual distress three worthy servants of God in these later
times, were plunged and pressed down under the sense of Gods anger for sin:
Blessed Mistress See the Discourse of the holy l^fe, and Ch^istian death of
Mistress Katherin Brettergh.
Brettergh upon Her last Bed was horribly hemmed in with the sorrows of death;
the very grief of Hell laid hold upon Her Soul; a roaring Wilderness of woe
was within Her, as She confessed of Her self. She said, her sins had made
Her a prey to Satan; And wished that she had never been borne, or that she had
been made any other creature, rather then a Woman. She cried out many times,
Woe, woe, woe, etc. A weak, a woeful, a wretched, a forsaken woman; with
tears continually trickling from her eyes. Master In the narration of His
dreadful desertion upon his Bed of death.
Peacock that man of God, in that His dreadful visitation and desertion,
recounting some smaller sins, burst out into these words. And for these,
says He, I feel now an Hell in my conscience. Upon other occasions, He
cried out, groaning most pitifully: Oh me Wretch! Oh mine heart is miserable!
Oh, Oh, miserable and woeful! The burden of my sin lies so heavy upon me,
I doubt it will break my heart. Oh how woeful and miserable is my state, that
thus must converse with Hell Hounds! When Bystanders asked, if He would pray:
He answered; I cannot. Suffer us, say they to pray for you. Take not, replied
He, the Name of God in vain, by praying for a Reprobate. What grievous pangs,
what sorrowful torments, what boiling heates of the fire of Hell that blessed

John Glover, felt inwardly in his spirit, says Fox, no speech outwardly is
able to express. Being young, says He, I remember I was once or twice with
Him, whom partly by His talk I perceived, and partly by mine own eyes saw to
be so worn, and consumed by the space of five years, that neither almost any
brooking of meat, quietness of sleep, pleasure of life, yea, and almost no kind
of senses was left in Him. Upon apprehension of some backsliding, He was so
perplexed, that if He had been in the deepest Pit of Hell, He could almost
have despaired no more of His salvation: says the same Author: In which
intolerable griefs of mind, says He, although He neither had, nor could
have any joy of his meat, yet was He compelled to eat against his appetite,
to the end to differ the time of His damnation, so long, as He might,
thinking with Himself no less, but that He must needs be thrown into Hell,
the breath being once out of his Body. I dare not pass out of this Point,
lest some Child of God should be here discouraged, before I tell you, that

blessed be thy Name for evermore, which have s^^wed me the Path of life. Thou
did, O Lord, hide thy face from me for a little season, but with everlasting
mercy thou have had compassion on me: And now blessed Lord thy comfortable
presence is come; yea Lord, thou have had respect unto thine hand-maide, and
art come with fullness of joy, and abundance of consolations: O blessed be thy
Name my Lord and my God: O the joys! the joys! the joys, that I feel in my
Soul! Oh they be wonderful! They be wonderful! They be wonderful! O
Father, how merciful, and marveilous gracious art thou unto me! yea Lord, I
feel thy mercy, and I am assured of thy love, and so certain am I thereof, as
Thou art the God of truth, even so sure do I know my Self to be thine, O
Lord my God; and this my Soul knows right well, and this my Soul knows
right well. O blessed be the Lord; O blessed be the Lord, that has thus
comforted me, and has brought me now to a place more sweet unto me, then

refresht and ravished when the storm was over: Truly, my heart and Soul,
says He (when the tempest was something alayed) have been far led, and
deeply troubled with temptations, and stings of conscience, but I thank God
they are eased in good measure. Wherefore I desire that I be not branded with
the note of a castaway, or reprobate. Such questions, oppositions, and all
tending thereto, I renounce. Concerning mine inconsiderate speeches in my
temptation, I humbly, and heartily ask mercy of God for them all. Afterward by
little, and little, more light did arise in His heart, and He brake out into
such speeches as these: I do, God be praised, feel such comfort, from that,
what shall I call it? Agony, said One that stood by; Nay, quoth He, that is
too little; That had I five hundred worlds, I could not make satisfaction for
such an issue. Oh the Sea is not more full of water, nor the Sun of light,
then the Lord of mercy! yea His mercies are ten thousand times more. What great
cause have I, to magnify the great goodness of God, that has humbled, ^ay
rather exalted, such a wretched Miscreant, and of so base condition, to an
estate so glorious and stately! The Lord has honored me with His goodness? I
am sure, He has provided a glorious Kingdom for me. The joy that I feel in
mine heart, is incredible. For the third, hear Acts and Monum. Ibid.
M. Fox: Tho this good Servant of God suffered many years so sharp temptations,
and strong buffetings of Satan: yet the Lord, who graciously preserved Him all
the while, not only at last did rid him out of all discomfort, but also framed
him thereby to such mortification of life, as the like lightly has not been
seen; in such sort, as He b^eing like one placed in Heaven already, and d^ad
in this world, both in word and meditation, led a life altogether celestial,
abhorring in His mind all profane do^ngs.

7. No arm of flesh, or Art of man; no earthly comfort, or created power can
possibly heal or help in this heaviest case, and extremest horror; Heaven
and earth, Men and Angels, friends and Physic; gold and silver, pleasures and
preferments, favor of Princes; nay the utmost possibility of the whole
creation must let this alone for ever. An Almighty hand, and infinite skill
must take this in hand; or else never any cure or recovery in this world or the
world to come. Bodily diseases may be eased, and mollified by medicines:
Surgery, as they say, has a salve for every sore: Poverty may be repaired and
releived by friends: There is no imprisonment without some hope of enlargement.
Suit and favor may help home out of banishment. Innocence and neglect may
weare-out disgrace: Grief for loss of a wife, a Child, or other dearest
friend, if not by reasons from Reason, that death is un-avoidable, necessary,
an end of all earthly miseries, the common way of all Mankind, etc. yet at
last is lessened and utterly lost by length of time. Cordialls of Pearl,
Sapphires, and Rubies, with such like, may recomfort the heart possessed with
Melancholy, and drowned in the darkness of that sad, and irksome humor,
etc. But now not the most exquisite concurrence of all these, nor all the
united abilities, which lie within the strength and sinews of the Arm of
flesh, can help any whit at all in this Case. Not the exactest quintessence
extracted from all the joys, glory and pleasures, that ever the world enjoyed,
can procure, or minister one jote of ease to a Soul afflicted in this kind,
and thus trembling under the terrors of God. In such an Agony, and extremity
had thou the utmost aid, and an universal attendance from Angels and men;
could thou reach the top of the most aspiring humane ambition, after the
excellency and variety of all worldly felicities: were thy possessions as large
as East and West; were thy meat continually Manna from Heaven; every day, like
the day of Christ's resurrection: Were thy apparel as costly and orient as
Aarons Ephod; nay, thy Body clothed with the beauty of the Sun, and crownde
with Stars; yet for all this, and a thousand more, thy heart within Thee
would be as cold as a stone, and tremble, infinitely above the heart of a
woman, entering into travel of Her first Child. For alas, who can stand before
the mighty Lord God? Who dare plead with Him, when He is angry? What spirit
of man has might, to wrestle with His Maker? Who is able to make an agreement
with the Hells of Conscience? or to put to silence the voice of desperation?
Oh! in this conflict alone, and woeful wound of conscience, O miseri, in quanto
errore, versamini. Patatisne hunc morbum ejusmod^ esse, quipbar^^acis, aut open

of the Rosie-Crosse, nor the most exquisite extraction, which Alchymy, or Art
it self can create, is able any whit, or at all to revive ease, or assuage. It
is only the hand of the holy Ghost, by the blood of that blessed Lamb, Jesus
Christ the holy, and the righteous, which can bind up such a bruise.

Uses. 1. Counsel to the unconverted: That they would take the stings out of
their sins, and prevent the desperateness, and incurablenesse of this
horrible wound, by an humble, sincere, universal turning unto the Lord, while
it is called Tempestive incipiamus sentire conscientiae horrores, dum ^empus
est gratia, qua vulnerata conscientia sanari potest suavissimus Christi
promissio^ibus. Nam si sensum hunc differamus, etc. Rolloc. in loan 5. page 287.
To Day. For assuredly in the mean time, all the sins they have heretofore
committed in thought, word or deed; at any time, in any place, with any
company, or to which they have bin any ways accessory, are already upon record
before the pure Eye of that high and everlasting Judge, written exactly by the
hand of divine Justice in the Book of their consciences, with a pen of iron,
with the claw of an Adamant, with the point of a Diamond, or if you can name
any thing, which makes a stronger, deeper and more lasting impression: and
there they lie, like so many Lions asleep, and Giants refreshing with wine,
gathering much desperate poison, and s^inging points; that whenever
hereafter, they shall be effectually and finally awaked by Gods angry hand,
they may torment most ragingly, and tear their woeful Souls in pieces
everlastingly, when there is none to help.

Now we may see and observe many times, one little sin, at least in the worlds
account, and conceit of carnal men, to plunge a guilty conscience into the
depth of extremest horror, and a very Hell upon Earth: As I have heard of, and
known in many: One for a sudden, unadvised imprecation against Her own Soul,
in case She did so or so: Another, for a thought conceived of God, unworthy so
great a Majesty: Another, for covetously keeping a thing found, and not
restoring it, or not inquiring after the Owner: Another for an adulterous
project, without any actual pollution: Another, by concurring with a company
of scoffing Ishmaels only once, and ere He was aware, by lifting up the
hands, and casting up the eyes, in scorn of Gods people, etc. Yet afterward
they sadly revising these miscarriages in cold blood, some of them some five or
six years after, God being then pleased to represent them with terror, and
their native stings, were cast into that affliction of conscience, and
confusion of spirit, that their very bones were broken; their faces filled with
ghastlinesse and fear; their bodies possessed with strange tremblings and
languishing distempers; their very vital moisture turned into the drought of
Summer: In which dreadful perplexity they were in great danger of destroying
themselves, and of being swallowed up of despair. If the guilty sense then of
one Sin, when God sets it on, and says unto it, Torment, draws so many fiery
points of stinging Scorpions after it; charges upon the excellency of the
understanding with such hideous darkness; rents the heart in pieces with such
desperate rage; grindes into powder, the arm and sinews of all earthly
succor; melts, like Dew before the Sun, all those delights, and pleasures
which the whole world offers, or affords to comfort in such a Case; In a word,
makes a man so extremely miserable, That He would make Himself away; wishes
with unspeakeable grief, that He had never been; that He might return into
the abhorred state of annihilation; that He were any other Creature; that He
might lie hid world without End under some everlasting Rock, from the face of
God; Nay, that He were rather in Hell, then in His present horror: I say it
being thus, what unquenchable wrath; what streams of brimstone; what restless
anguish; what gnashing of teeth; what knawing of conscience; what despairefull
roarings; what horrible torments; what fiery Hells feeding upon His Soul and
flesh for ever, may every impenitent wretch expect, when the whole black and
bloody Catalogue of all His sins shall be marshold and mustered up together
at once against Him? every one being keened with as much torturing fury, as
the infinite anger of Almighty God can put into it* after that He has
accursedly with much incorrigible stubbornness out-stood the day of His
gracious visitation, under this glorious Sunshine of the Gospel, wherein He
either has, or if He had been as As if a foolish wretch should choose rather
to starve at the Bakers Stall, then lay out His penny in bread. So God knows
many a wretched man famisheth his Soul to spare His purse; contented to live
in a barren and dry wilderness, where there is neither bread nor water of life;
where there is no vision, no preaching; rather then to feed His Kids by the
Tents of the Shepherds; that is, to dwell, where He may hear, or (which were
more charitable) to procure that He* with others may hear, where he
dwells. S. Crook.
provident for His immortal Soul, as carking for His rotten Carcass, might
have enjoyed very powerful means all His life long: And yet all the while
neglected so great salvation; forsook his own mercy; and so judged Himself
unworthy of everlasting life.

If a lighter Sin many times lite so heavy, when the Conscience is
illightened; How will thy poor Soul tremble under the terrible, and
untolerable weight of all thy sins together? When all thy lies, all thy
oaths, all thy rotten speeches, and railings; All thy bedlam passions, and
filthy thoughts; All thy Good-fellow-meetings, Ale-house-hauntings, and
scoffings of Gods people; All the wrongs thou have done, all the goods thou
have got ill, all the time thou have misspent; Thy profanation of every
Sabbath, thy killing of Christ at every Sacrament, thy Non-proficiency at every
Sermon; Thy ignorance, thy unbelief, thy worldliness, thy covetousness, thy
pride, thy malice, thy lust, thy luke-warmenesse, impatiency, coffeehouse,
vainglory, Self-love; The innumerable swarms of vain, idle, wandering, and
wicked imaginations; In a word all the pollutions, distempers, and
estrangednesse from God in thine heart: all the villainies, vanities, and
rebellions of thy whole life; I say, when all these shall be charged upon thy
graceless Soul by the implacable indignation of that highest Majesty, whose
mercy, Ministry, and long suffering, thou have shamefully abused; whose anger,
patience, and pure eye thou have villanously provoked all thy life long; Alas
what will thou do then! What wings of the morning will then carry Thee out of
the reach of Gods revenging hand? What Cave shall receive thee? What Mountain
can Thou get by entreaty to fall upon Thee? What darkest Midnight, or
Hellish Dungeon shall hide thee from that wrath, which Thou shall be neither
able to abide, or to avoid? In this case, I would not have thy heart in my
Breast one hour, for the riches, glory and pleasures often thousand worlds.

Neither bless thy Self in the mean time, because Thou have neither fear,
fore-tast, or feeling of the wrath which is to come, the vengeance which hangs
over thine Head, and the horror which dog's Thee at the heels* Ne, quod

willing to deal so roughly with the unregenerate, if He could choose: for He
stands ever in most danger of losing them, when He carries Himself toward
them, in so hard a fashion: wherefore He rather flatters, and faunes;
endeavoring to rock them asleep still* if he can, in the Cradle of
security and presumption. Neither will He storm thus, (to wit, labor to
pull them by the strength of utter despair, as it were, quick into Hell, and
to make them kill themselves, or do some other most gross and unnatural
crime:) but when he sees his advantage, in regard of some bodily cross, or
distemper; or that he sees the Lord will needs awaken their sleepy
consciences. Whately, New Birth Cap. 5. Qui jugum suscipiunt Diaboli, Diabolus
eos delectat, and decipit, ne discedant a malo impij usque ad mortem suam.
Incertus Author, In Mat. Cap. 11. Hom. 28.
For that is the very complement of thy misery, and perfection of thy madness.
To be sick, and senseless of it, is the sorest sickness. To have Satan
slash thy Soul with so many sins, one after another, and to feel no smart,
is a most desperate security; To have all this misery toward, and to be
confident, and fearelesse, is the misery of miseries.

The reasons, why thou art at rest from their guilty rage in the mean time;
and that so many sleeping Lions, I mean all thine unpardoned sins, do not
yet awake and stir; terrific and tear in pieces, are such as these.

1. Satan is subtle, that He will not meddle much, or molest thee extremely,
until He be able to do thee an irrecoverable mischief. He is wont not to
appear in His true likeness, and so terribly; not so much to disquiet and
trouble any of His own, before He have them at some dead lift, and desperate
advantage; as under some extraordinary Cross, great disgrace, grievous
sickness; In time of some deep Melancholy, un-avoidable danger, universal
confusion; When He conceives in all probability, that they have out-stood the
Day of their visitation, hardened their hearts, that they cannot repent,
received the sentence of death against themselves; And at such other like
times, when he hopes, He shall be able to crush, and confound them suddenly,
utterly and for ever. And then he plays the Devil indeed, and shows
Himself in His colors. For He then infinitely endeauours with all cunning
and cruel industry, after He has wafted them a while down the current of
the times, with as much carnal peace and pleasure, as He could possibly, to
cast them upon the Rock of a most dreadful ruin, and swallow them up quick
in the gulphe of calamity and woe; of despair, selfe-destruction, everlasting
perdition of Body, and Soul. But you must know, that in the mean time, until
He can spy such an opportunity, He labors might and maine to keep them in
as merry a mood as may be. He lays about Him, by all ways and means, He
can devise, to plot and provide for them, and that with great variety and
curiosity, fresh successions and supplies continually, of pleasures,
contentments, the countenance and favors of the times, sensual satisfactions,
all earthly prosperities. If He can help it, and have his will, they shall
wallow still in all worldly felicity, and be attended upon with all the
delights their hearts can desire. And all this, to continue them with more
easiness and irresistance in the damned way: And lest otherwise, they should
grow weary of His slavery, sensible of their gilded fetters, and so labor
after liberty, and enlargement from His Hellish bondage. For He knows full
well, that if thy endured much hardship in His service, they might perhaps
think of seeking after a new Master; that want of comfort in the world, might
draw their hearts to delight in the Word; Not finding happiness upon earth,
might make them enquire after that which is in heaven. That crosses and
crossing their courses, being sanctified for that purpose, may happily help to
break their hearts, and bring them to remorse for sin; which He mainely
fears, and opposes with all the craft and power, He can possibly; lest
thereupon, they break out of His fooles-Paradise, into the Garden of Grace;
out of the warm Sun, into Gods blessing.

In managing this maine policy, for the more secure detainement of His Vassals
in the invisible chains of darkness and damnation, and in an everlasting
distaste and dis-affection to the good way; by holding up their hearts in His
sinful service, and wooing them, to go on quietly toward Hell without any
grumbling; He works many ways.

1. He plots all He can to procure them success in their wicked enterprises;
and unlawful attempts, especially, against the faithful Ministers, and people
of God; for that does infinitely confirm, harden, and encourage them in their
profane courses, and opposition to grace. Herein He does many times mightily
prevail, by improving the oportunities, and pressing the advantages, which he
gains, by the executions of Gods justice, and rebellions of his Children. The
sins even of His own people do many times provoke Gods just indignation
against them; and enforces Him, to raise up their adversaries, as scourges, and
to give them success, for the humiliation, and chastisement of his chosen. See
Psalm. 81.14.15. Isai. 10.5 6. etc. Ezech. 22.19.20. Whereupon Satan fills the
hearts of the wicked so prevailing, and conquering, with a great deal of
pride, selfe-applause, insolency, contempt of godliness, selfe-conceitednesse
of their own righteousness and worth; and so hardens them extraordinarily,
and holds them with much obstinated resolution in the ways of death, and
prejudice against the holy Path.

2. He helps all he can, to have them thrive and prosper by oppression,
usury, simony, sacrilege, bribery, covetousness, cousoning, Machiavellian
tricks, etc. That so His service may seem more sweet and gainefull unto them.
To the effecting whereof He receives notable assistance, and special
advantage from the corruptions of the times, and conscionable simplicity of the
Saints. For the first, These worst and ulcerous times, wherein so many Vines,
Olive Trees, and Figge-trees wither away in obscurity; and so many Brambles
brave it abroad in the world, tumbling themselves in the pleasures, splendor
and glory of the present; wherein so many brave Princes are walking as servants
upon the earth; and too many servants of luxury and pride are mounted on
horseback; I say they are the only season, for Satan to gratify all* His
graceless Ones; and to hoist them up by the common, but accursed stairs and
stirrops of bribing, baseness, temporising, ill offices to humor greatness,
and other such vile means, and accommodations, into eminency in the world, and
high rooms; where he keeps them in a golden captivity with great
contentment, and locks them full fast in the Scorners chair, with much
security to their own sensual hearts; and notorious service to Himself.
Whereas indeed and truth to men that have eyes in their Heads the ascent is
slippery, the Top shaking, the downfall desperate. For the second; It is
incredible to consider, what a deal of advantage in worldly dealings, the
covetous Dwell in a cruel and crafty worldling, does suck out of the
single-heartednesse, plain dealing and un-suspiciousnesse, of conscionable
men, for their rising and enriching, if God cross it not.

3. He draws them by all the baits, He can devise, to all the incentives,
and preservatives of carnal contentment: as to Tavernes, Alehouses,
Play Houses, Whore-houses, Gaming-houses; to May-games, Morricedances, Church
Ales; to Cards, to Dice, to Dancing; to Feasts, Wakes, Mis-rules,
Drinking-matches, revelliu^s, and a world of such sinful haunts, Galat. 5.21.
Bedlam-fooleries, and Good-fellow-meetings. Wherein He is mightily furthered,
by Wicked Men's impatiency of solitariness; and their enraged eagerness of
carrying with them to Hell, as many as may be. For the first, Tho a good man,
as Solomon says, be satisfied from Himself; dare full well, Prove. 14.14.
and desires full often to be alone; because the bird of the bosom sings
sweetly to His Soul in solitariness: yet all the Sons, and Daughters of
pleasure, have no pleasure at all, nay ordinarily are most loath to be by Quin

themselves. Solitariness puts them into their dumps, makes them extremely
melancholic, and weary of themselves. They would rather be any where, in any
company, any ways imploide, then alone. Mistake me not, they can walk by
themselves, to feed upon contemplative filth, speculative wantonness, and
adulteries of the heart; to plot revenge, preferment, enlargement of their
estate; to renew upon their sensual hearts their youthful pleasures, etc. But

stare; they abhor, (...) endure, it is to them a tor^ure, a Rack, the very
beginning of Hell. And that is the reason, to decline the tings of guiltnesse,
and torment before their time; why they have so often recourse unto the arm of
flesh, for refreshing; to the mirth and madness of wine, pleasures, and many
other fugitive follies; That they cast themselves into such knots of
good-fellowship; appoint so many set-matches of joviall meetings, and hunt
after such variety of the times entertainment, as they call it: which they
account the very life of their life and without which they would rather be
under ground, then above it. For the second, Hear, How swagge^ingly they cry
unto their companions in iniquity, to make haste with them toward Hell. Come
with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk pr^vily for the innocent
without caus^: Let us swallow them up alive, as the grave, and whole, as those
that go down into the pit: we shall find all precious substance, we shall
fill our houses with spoil. Cast in thy lot among us, let us all have one
purse, Prove. 1.11. etc. Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that
are present: and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth. Let us fill our
selves with costly wine, and ointments: and let no flower of the Spring pass
by us. Let us crown our selves with Rose buds, before they be withered. Let
none of us go without His part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of
our ioyfulnesse in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this,
etc.

4. And in all these cursed conventicles of good-fellowship, and furious
combinations for profaneness, and against Piety, the Devil himself is ever
present amongst them in His Pontificalibus, as they say: And there disposes,
enclines, manageth and accommodates all opportunities, circumsta^^ (...), men's
several corruptions, and (...) wicked wits to make their meetings, as merry,
as may be; and to put all possible sensual sweetness into their carnal
delights.

5. Lastly, That which is principally for my purpose; Besides, that like a
crafty Iugler, He casts a mist before the eyes of His slaves; and like a false
Merchant, puts a counterfeite gloss upon the face of sin; He also hides
away the sting from them, and withholds the horror until afterward. Every sin
in it is own nature, ever looks fouler then the Devil Himself; O that the
ougly, fearful, and filthy shape of it could be seen with bodily eyes, that
thereby it might provoke all men to a mortal and immortal hate and
detestation of it! The sting is pointed with the keen unquenchable wrath of
God; the horror is heated with the very fire of Hell: And yet ordinarily Satan
takes an order by His craft and industry, that these never appear, until it
appear unto Him, that in all probability, the sight of them will sink their
Souls into irrecoverable woe.

The not feeling then of their spiritual misery is so far from making them
not miserable, that it ministers occasion to the Devils malice, mightily to
aggravate their misery, both present and future.

2. An other reason, why many are not troubled in the mean time, tho there be
infinite cause, and a world of woe to come, is, because their consciences by
reason of surfeit in sin, and being drunk with worldly delights as with
sweet wine, are cast into a dead sleep: And there lulled still, and locked full
fast in an imaginary Paradise of golden dreams and transitory fancies, by the
charms and enchantments of earthly pleasures. And if at any time, any noise of
terror sound in their ears from the Lords Trumpeters in the Ministry of the
Word, so that they begin to stir, then the Devil begins to be stir
Himself, and to rock them fast again with His Syren-songs in the Cradle of
security. Here therefore we may take notice of a fourefold conscience: 1. That

good and quiet; when it has peace with God, and with it self; so that the
happy Soul may sweetly sing in it is own bosom; My belov^d is mine, and I am
His. 2. That which is neither good, nor quiet; when it lies forlorn under the
sense of Gods wrath, and full of horror in it self. As that of Judas,

good but not qui^t; when the pleased face of God does shine upon it through the

reconciliation: As in many new Converts, who being truly humbled for all
sin, cast themselves upon the Lord Jesus and his sure promises, for
spiritual and eternal life; and yet are not as yet sensible of any assurance.
4. That which is quiet but not good; when it is as full of sin as a Toade of
venom, as Hell of darkness; and all those innumerable sins unrepented of,
unpardoned, like so many mad Ban-dogs, and fell Mastives, tho asleep for the
present, will in the evil day, especially of sickness, death, judgment,

fly in the face of the proudest Nimrod, ready to pluck out his very throat
and heart, and to torment with unspeakeable horror; and yet for all this, it
is untroubled, senseless and secure. This kind of conscience, is to be found,
I fear me, in the most that hear me this day, and so generally over the
Kingdom. It does not in the mean time, trouble and terrify.

1. A great number, by reason of their ignorance in the Book of God; and by
consequent un-acquaintednesse with the sinfulness and cursednesse of their
spiritual state, revealed thereby. This is the very case of a world of poor
ignorant besotted Souls amongst us; more is the pity, especially now, when
the glorious Sun of Christ's Gospel shines so fair, and fully in many
places! For want of light in Gods Law, they look upon their sins, as we do
upon the Stars in a cloudy night; see only the great ones of the first
magnitude; and here one, and there one: But if they were further illightned,
and informed aright they might behold hem, as those infinite ones in the
fairest, frosty winters Midnight. A worthy Divine, sets out excellently the
quietness of this ignorant conscience by a very fit res^mblance, thus: Men
judge of their ignorant consciences, says He, as they do of their blind,
dumb and ignorant Ministers. Such neither do, nor can preach; can neither
tell men of their sins, nor of their duties. Ask such a blind-guides people,
what their conceit is of him, and what a kind of Man their Minister is, and
you shall have Him magnified for a passing, honest, harmless man, wondrous
quiet amongst his neighbors. They may do what they will for Him; He is none
of these troublesome fellows, that will be reproving their faults, or
complaining of their disorders in the Pulpit; Oh such an one is a quiet good
Man indeed. Thus judge many of their consciences. If their consciences be
quiet, and lie not grating upon them, and telling them, that their courses are
sinful and damnable, and that their persons are in a dangerous condition: but
rather by their sil^nce, ignorance, and vain pretenses do justify them, and
tell them, all will be well enough. Oh then what excellent consciences have
these men! They make no conscience of Family Duties; once in the year to come
to the Sacrament serves the turn; they are common swearers in their ordinary
communication; make no conscience of sanctifying Sabbaths, etc. And their
consciences let them alone in all these: do not give them one syllable of ill
language: Oh what gentle, and good-natured consciences think these men they
have? But alas! what evil consciences have they?

2. Nor others, In peace there is a total d^position, both of Arms and
Enmity; all hostile affections are put off: In a truce, there is but a
suspension, and a cessation of Arms for a season, so as duri^^ the same, there
is stil^ provision of more fo^^ces, and a preparation of greater strength.
by reason of a covenant with death, and an agreement with Hell. Such as those,
Isai. 28*15. who negotiate by their plausible Agents, Ease, pleasures,
prosperity; and conclude some kind of concord and composition for a time with
Satan, sin, and their own consciences. But to tell you the truth, it is no
true peace, but a politic truce. For these implacable, desperate spiritual
enemies of theirs, are ever in the mean time preparing Arms, Ord'nance and
many fiery darts, still levying of fresh forces, whole armies of fiery
Scorpions, and flaming terrors, with which as soon as the truce is ended,
they will set upon them with more violence, fury and fierceness then ever
before.

3. Nor others, By reason of an insensible Brawnednesse grown over, and a
desperate searednesse impressed upon their consciences by extraordinary villainy,
and variety in sin. Such as those, Isai. 5 19. By drawing iniquity a long
time with cords of vanity, and sin, as it were with a cart-rope, by waving
the glorious light of the Word under which they sit, and which shines on their
faces as a foolish thing; (...). 1. Cor. 1.18.
by villanously trampling under foot the power of it with despite, and scorn,
many times against that light, which stands in their consciences like an armed
man; (...).
Nay, and by treading out with custom in sin, the very notions that nature
has engraven in their hearts, as Men do the ingravings of Tombe-stones which
they walk upon, with foul shoes; I say thus, at length their consciences
become, so utterly remorselesse, and past all feeling; so brawned, so seared,
so sealed up with a reprobate sense; that with an audacious, and Giant like
insolency, they challenge even God Almighty Himself to draw His sword of
vengeance against them. Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
and sins, as it were with a cart-rope: That say, Let him make speed, and
hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the holy one of
Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it. (...). Iam. 2.19.
These Roarers, and swaggering Belials, in this respect have consciences, worse
then the Devil himself. For He believes and trembles. Even those already,
desperate and damned spirits, tremble at the forethought of that fuller wrath
which is to come; and yet further-deserved damnation.

4. Nor others, who, when it begins ever and anon to grumble, mutter, and make
a noise lull it asleep ag^ine with songs of pleasures; and still the cries of
it with outward mirth, as Saul was wont to lay the evil spirit with Music.
These men's consciences are qujet, not because they are savingly appeasde; but
because they are sensu^lly pleas^e: Not because they want matter to trouble,
and terrify; but because they will give them no leisure, to set their sins
in order before them. For this purpose, and to keep these furious Mastives
musl'd in the mean time, they have recourse unto and improove, both variety of
delights, and multiplicity of employments. For the first: This is the reason,
as one says wittily, that many are so eager in the pursuits of their
pleasures, because they would make Gods Sergeant, their own conscience that
pursues them, drunken with these pleasures: just as many men use to do,
getting the Sergeant that comes to arrest them into the Tavern, and there
making him drunk, that so they may escape. For the second: How was it possible
that Ahitophel should hold out so long from hanging himself* and horrible
confusion of spirit; especially since He harbored in His bosom such a false
rotten abominable heart, as appeared by that villainous counsel He gave
Absalom, to lie with His Fathers Concubines, in the sight of all Israel; except
He had been a Counselor of State, and so necessarily taken up continually
with extraordinary variety, vicissitude, and succession of most weighty and
important affairs; which would wholly possess His mind with an
un-interrupted attention, agitation and exercise; and not give it any leave to
reflect upon it self, with those severer cogitations in cold blood, which are
wont to correct and condemn the enormity of exorbitant courses. And thus in
all ages, many great Men, of great wisdom, being great offenders, purposely
put and plunge themselves into multitude of businesses; that they may have no
leisure, to listen unto that, which their consciences would secretly tell them
in their ear, of their Machivellian plots, prodigious lusts, and plausible
cruelties. The noise of attendants, visitants, Dependants, and great
employments drown the voice of conscience in such Cases, as the Drums in the
sacrifices to Moloch, the Cry of the Infants. But while the Men of the world
are thus wholly detained, and do so greedily upon purpose entertain the time
with cares of this life, and dealings in the world; their consciences deal
with them, as Creditors with their Debitors: while they have any doings, as
they say, and are in trading, in policy let them alone and say nothing; but if
once down the wind, in sickness, poverty, disgrace, etc. Then comes Sergeant
after Sergeant; Arrest upon Arrest; Action upon Action: All their sins are
set in order before them, and fall full foul upon the now distressed Soul, as
Ravens upon the fallen Sheep, to pick out the very eyes and heart of it, and
to keep it down in the Dungeon of despair for ever.

5. Nor others, because they cosen themselves with a formal false conceit of
a comfortable spiritual state; as did the Phari^ie, Luke 15.11. with a
groundless presumption, that they are in Gods favor; as did those, Matthew.
7.22. And the five foolish Virgins, Matthew. 25. When as God knows, they are
mere strangers to the Mystery of Christ, and far enough from any sound
Humiliation.

Thus the blindness, security, searednesse, slumber, Selfe-deceite, or some
other such distemper of the Conscience conceales, and keeps in, the stings of
those sins in sensual men; which without turning unto the Lord, in truth,
while it is called To Day, will hereafter torment with intolerable and
restless terror through all eternity.

3. A third reason, why thy unlamented, and unpardoned sins, tho every one of
them be armed with a several bloody and fiery sting, and of their own nature
so heavy with horror, that they are able to sink Thee into the bottom of
Hell; do not as yet stir, nor press upon thy Soul, with the insupportable
weight of divine vengeance, is this: They are in their native soil; where they
were borne, bred and brought up; in their own Element, as they say: I mean in
a carnal heart, soaking in sensuality, and not resolved to be reformed. We
say in Philosophy, An Element is not heavy in it is own Place. One Bucket full
of water upon the Earth would be burdensome to the Back of that Man; who,
were He in the bottom of the Sea, would feel no weight at all from all the
water there, tho it were three miles high over His head. A sensual heart,
settled upon it is lees can bear without sense, or complaint, a world of
wickedness, which out of it is Element and humor, would be crushed into
Powder, and tremble with horror upon the sad apprehension of the least sin,
especially set out by Gods just indignation. While Belshazzar was in His
Element, revelling and rioting amongst His Lords, His Wives, and His
Concubines, drinking wine swaggeringly and contemptuously in the golden and
silver Vessels of the Temple, He felt no touch in point of conscience, or
terror at all. But put out of His humor, by the handwriting upon the
plaster of the Wall, His countenance was presently changed, and his thoughts
troubled him, so that the joints of His loins were loosed, and His knees smote
one against another.

4. Fourthly, The never-dying worm, that naturally breeds, and Voluptas

grows big in every unregenerate conscience, which beats back still the
searching power of the Word, and secret warnings of the Spirit, is like a Wolf
in the foot: Feed it continually with fresh supply of raw flesh, and it will
let the Body alone; but withdraw that, and it devoures upward. While the
Sons and daughters of pleasure, and all those who have their portion and
Paradise in this life, stop the mouth of this hellish worm, with variety of
carnal delights, they do well enough, and find pretty ease, and exemption
for a time from the rage and bitings thereof: But they may assure themselves in
evil times, when the days are come upon them, wherein there is no pleasure;
when the Play is done; when all worldly comforts and comforters like runaway
servants, and drunken Serving-men, are to seek, when they have most use and
need of them; I say, that then the time, and turn is come; that the worm of
conscience, destitute now ^or ever of any further satisfaction from sensual
sweetness, will ragingly turn upon the Soul, devour like a Lion, know like a
Vulture, vex eternally.

5. Fifthly, If the weight of the whole world were now laid upon any of these
Bodies here lately buried, it would not stir or groan: And why? Because it
is naturally dead. Proportionably, Tho the burden of sin, far heavier then
a mountain of Grave siquidem, grave, inquam, and onerosum est peccatum, and
omni plumbo ponderosius. Chrysostom. Ad. Pop. Antioch. Hom. 31.
Lead, then this mighty and massy earth under our feet, lies upon every
impenitent Soul, ready every hour to press, and plunge it into the lowest
Pit yet wretched, and bewitched Thing, it neither feels any smart, nor fears
any hurt; it is neither sensible of the present weight, nor troubled for the
future wrath; And what is the reason? It is spiritually Mortuus est autem
peccator, maxim ille, quem moles consuetudinis premit, quasi sepultus Lazarus.
Parum enim erat qui^ mortuus, etiam sepultus. August. de temp. Sermon. 48.
dead. It is stark dead in trespasses and sins. The strong man is gone away
with all. And there is no stirring, nor sense of this cursed Burden, until,
Ephesians. 2.1.
Either a stronger then He lay hands upon this Hellish Tyrant, disarme Him,
and throw down His Holds; and a Neque negari potest, non minoris esse
virtutis, immo aliquanto majoris, e morte animas mortuas excitare ac corpora
mortua. Musc. In Evang. Joan. cap. 5.
mightier voice of the Son of God, then that which made Lazarus come out of
the Grave, put life into it: Or else that the dreadful thunder of Gods fierce
and final wrath, the Day of visitation being expired, awake it to everlasting
woe.

6. Tho in the mean time, thou be extremely miserable, and if thou dyest in
thine impenitent state this day, thou must most certainly lodge this night in
the Lake of fire and brimstone amongst the damned; yet thy sins for the
present do not represent to the eye of thy conscience those forms of
foulness, and terror, of which they are naturally full; and which without
timely repentance, thou will hereafter find and feel in them, to thine
endless grief: because thou look upon them in the false Glass of
vainglory, ignorance, self-love, selfe-conceitednesse; painted over by the
Devils dawbing, with whorish intising colors of pleasure, profit, preferment,
worldly applause, and other such goodly and golden outsides. Whereas a true
and effectual beholding them in the clear Crystal of Gods pure Law, hunted
continually at the heels with divine vengeance; all the curses in this Book,
and plagues innumerable, internal, external, eternal; and in the bitter
Passion of Jesus Christ, without whose hearts-blood, not the least sin that
ever was committed, could ever have been remitted, were able to ^right and fire
a very Blackamore out of His black skin and a Leopard from His spots. Ier.
13.23.
And thou something easest thine heart also against the terror of the Lord for
thy sins, by looking upon Gods mercy with false spectacles, and so enlarging
it beyond the limits of His Truth. But hear, what that excellent discoverer of
the Depths of our Selfe-cousoning hearts tells thee in such a case: As a man
passing over a bridge, says He, which his false spectacles make to seem
broader, then in deed it is, being thereby deceived goes besides the bridge,
and so is drowned: so is it with those whose deceitful hearts make the bridge
of Gods mercy larger then it is, they are in danger of falling beside it, into
the waters of eternal destruction. For the Gods mercy be of the largest
extent, yet it is bounded with His Truth. And therefore usually in the
Scriptures we find these two coupled together, Gods mercy and His Truth. Now
His Truth tells us; that the good tidings of the Gospel belong only to the
poor, to the brokenhearted, to the captives, to the blind, to the bruised.
Luke 4.18. That He only who confesses, and forsakes His sins, shall have
mercy. Prou. 28.13. That except we repent, we shall all perish. Luke 13.3.
That except we be borne again, we cannot see the Kingdom of God. Ioh. 3.3.
That God will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalpe of such an
one, as goes on still in his trespasses. Psalm. 68.21. That if we regard
iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us. Psalm. 66.18. That no
fornicator, nor idolater, nor adulterer, nor eff^minate, nor abuser of Himself
with mankind, nor thief, nor covetous man, nor drunkard, nor reviler, nor
extortioner shall inherit the Kingdom of God. 1. Cor. 6.9.10. That without
holiness no man shall see the Lord. Heb. 12.14. That every one that calls on
the Name of Christ savingly, must depart from iniquity. 2. Tim. 2.19. etc.
Compare now these and the like Places with thine heart, life, and present
impenitent state, and tell me in cold blood and impartially, whether any mercy
at all as yet belongs unto thee upon good ground, yet lying in thy sins.

2. In a second place, the Point may serve for warning to those, who are
already washed from their sins; that they defile their Souls no more: who
having been cured by casti^g their eyes upon the brazen Serpent, from those
many fiery stings; that they rebel no more; who wounded formerly at the
heart-roote with grievous horror, and now healed with the blood of Christ,
that in the name of Christ, they turn not again to folly. Let them call to
mind, and lay to heart the ensuing considerations, when they are first
tampered with, and tempted again to any sin: which, me thinks, should be of
power, not only to keep Gods blessed Ones from putting their hands to iniquity;
but also to restrain, or at least to cool the courage even of the Devils
slaves, in the very heat of the most furious entisement to their best-beloved
sin.

1. Sin is most hateful. It is the only Object of all Gods infinite hatred.
His Love is cut, as it were, into diverse streams, and carried upon variety of
Primum enim divini amoris objectum, est ipsa Deitas, ac Filius ille dilectus.

Objects. He loves in the first place, infinitely, ad-equately His own blessed
Self, His own Son, who is called the (...). Coloss. 1.13.
Son of His Love, His Angels, His Saints, His Servants, His Creatures, All
things He made: Thou love all things that are, and abhorrest nothing which
Thou have made. For never would Thou have made any thing, if thou had
hated it. But He hates Deo nihil est in odio, nisi malum, hoc est, nihil est
ei invisum, o ^iosum, excerabile, nisi malum. Hoc autem est peccatum ipsum, and
praeterea nihil. Zanch. De natura Dei. Lib. 4. Cap 7.
nothing at all, properly and formally, but sin. The whole infiniteness of
all His hatred, is spent wholly upon sin alone; which makes it infinitely and
extremely hateful. Now what a thing is this, that an infinite divine hatred,
like a mighty undivided Torrent should withal it is united forces, and
detestations run headlong, and rest upon every sin; be it but an officious
lie, Ephesians. 5.4. Gal. 5.21. Matthew. 5 28.
foolish talking, jesting, revelling, a wanton glance, a vain thought, an idle
word, and such like lighter sins in the worlds account; which to reprove in
some companies, nay almost every where, would be holden to be a sour and
unsufferable preciseness: So desperately impudent are the times, both in
disgracing of sincerity, and dawbing of sin! And what a woeful wretch is
every impenitent Sinner, who has such a world of unpardoned sins lying upon
His Soul, and such an immeasurable weight of hatred lying upon every several
sin! And what a prodigious Bedlam is He, who will wittingly, and willingly
put His hand to any sin; which once committed, is inseparably, and
individually attended with the infinite hatred of so great a God. For which the
pains of Hell must upon necessity be suffered; either by the Party Himself
or his Surety: Either it must be taken off by the blood of Jesus Christ; or
else the Delinquent, must burn in Hell for ever!

2. It is most foul. Even fouler then the foulest Feind in Hell, then the
Devil Himself. And let none stumble at this truth: It appears unanswerably
thus: Sin made him a Devil, and sunk Him into Hell and therefore sin is
more rank Devil and horrible Hell it self. For it is a principle in
Philosophy of unquestionable truth; (...) A^^st. Posterio. Anal. Lib. 1. Text.
15.
Whatsoever makes such, is it self much more such. The Sun that lightens
all other bodies, is much more light; The fire which heates all other things,
is much more hot: So that which defiles another thing* is much more fulsome:
Sin alone brought all hellish misery upon Satan, and made him so foul,
therefore is it far fouler. If any could strip him of his sins, he should
re-invest him into the shining roabes of all his former Angelical excellency
and perfection; and restore him into height of favor again with the most
High. Illud, quod maxim videtur Deus odissi, scil^ce^ Diabolum, non odit nisi
ratione peccati: and eum amaret, si peccatum non esset, tanquam creaturam suam.
V^de Sap, 11. Nihil odisti eorum quae fe^isti. Quod intelligendum, est nisi
propter peccatum adjunctum, quod ipse non secit. Peral.
For God hates the Devil for nothing else in the world but for sin.

Ob. But if sin be so ougly, may some say* as you have set it out; how comes
it to pass, that it is so amiable in the eyes of the most? Why do all sorts
of people pursue and practice it with such eagerness and delight? Why does the
whole world run a madding after it?

Answ. Herein observe an universal Soule-swallowing Depth of Satan's damned
Policy. He knows full well, that should sin appear it it is own likeness,
every eye would abhor it, every Mothers Son would detest, and defy it. And
therefore, He takes a course, by the exquisitnesse of his colors, and
excellency of painting, to put a seeming fairness upon an Hellish face;
whereby the greatest part dote upon this deformed Hag to their endless
damnation. For we must know that Satan, in this mystery of cousoning by
colors, incomparably surpasses the most famous Baudes, and noble Strumpets,
that ever were. So that it seems to be the conceit of the ancient Quae omnia

Fathers, that the Devil did immediately reveal unto whorish women this Art
of painting; at least, He was most certainly an extraordinary assistant to
the first Inventors of it. Now for painting sin, to make it more plausible
and passable, we may see variety of colors, and cousoning tricks ministered
unto Satan by our false hearts, His Agents for that purpose, I mean (...)

fools, and eyes of vanity; whereas understanding men, and those that have
eyes in their heads, discover in her so doing and daubing, an addition of a
great deal of artificial loathsomeness to Her natural foulness: So it is in
this case. The greisly face of sin being dawbed over with the Devils
painting, and false luster, carries away captive all carnal men, and detaines
in a Fooles-Paradise, indeed an hellish prison, a world of deluded Ones. Yet
those few illightened Souls, whose eyes have been happily opened, by
spiritu^ll Eye Salve, to turn from darkness to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, behold a double deformity and ouglines, in so foul a monster
deceitfully dress^d in the Devils counterfeite colors, and gilded over
garishly in His personated Angelical glory.

3. It is most filthy. Far filthier then the most stinking confluence of all
the most filthy, fulsome, nasty, loathsome things in the world: And it must
needs be so; For whatsoever a Man can conceive to be most contrary, distant
and opposite to the infinite clearenes, purity, sweetness, beauty, and
goodness of God; all that, and much more is sin in the highest degree. Hence
it is, that in the Scriptures, it is compared to the filthiest 2. Pet. 2.22.
mire, in which a Sow will lie down to cool, and cover her self: To the
loathsome vomit, not of a man, but of a Dog: Romans 3.13. Alludit ad hominem,
qui tetrum anhelitum ex corruptis spirat extis; and ad cadaver quod ex
sepulchro intolerabilem spirat odorem. Buc.
To the unsavory poysonfull dampe, which rotten Carkases exhale out of opened
graves: Ezech. 16 17. Their way was before me, as the uncleanness of a
remooved woman.

To the dirt under the nails; or the stinking sweat of the Body; or the
putrified matter of some pestilent ulcer: Ibid. (...). Beza reddit, excrementum
malitiae, Metaphora a digestione naturali, qua qui^quid in ^^bo assumpto non
praebet utile nutrimentum corpori, tanquam (...) excrementis deputatur. Par.
To the very excrements, which Nature having severed from the purer part of the
meat, thrusts out of the stomach, and casts into the draught: 2. Pet 2.20.
(...).
To the filthiness, pollutions, and impurities of the world, so called by a
singularity, for sin is the transcendent filth of the world: To all the
uncleanness, for which the Purifications, cleansings, washings, and
sprinklings were appointed in the Leviticall Law: Ezech. 22.2.
To abomination it self, etc. Nay, and yet further, which makes for the
further detestation of sin: Whereas all outward filth defiles only the Body;
this of sin by the strength and contagion, of it is insinuating poison soakes
through the flesh and the bone, and enters and eats into the very mind and
conscience, Tit. 1.15. defiles the pure, and immortal Soul of Man. How long
might we cast dirt into the Air, before we were able to infect the bright
shining beams of the Sun? Yet so filthy is sin, that at once with a touch
it infects the Soul, a clearer and purer essence then it; and that with such a
crimsin and double-^^ed stain, that the Flood of Noah, when all the World was
water, could not wash it off: Neither at that last and dreadful Day, when this
great Universal shall be turned into a Ball of fire, for the purifying and
renewing of the Heaven and the Earth, yet shall it have no power to purge or
cleanse the least sin out of the impenitent Soul: Nay, the fire of Hell
which burns night and day, even through all eternity, shall never be able to
raze it out.

4 It is most infectious: Spits venom on all sides, far and wide: corrupts
every thing it comes near. By reason whereof, it is fitly resembled to Matthew
16.12.
Leaven; to a 1. (...). 5.6.

Nay, at the very first breaking out, it suddenly blasted, as it were, both

delightfully, and impenitently, like a lump of Leaven, it soures all the
Soul, defiles the whole Man, and every thing, that proceeds from Him: His
thoughts, desires, affections, words, actions, and that of all sorts; natural,
civil, recreative, religious. It does not only unhallow his meat, drink,

spiritual services, and divinest duties; His prayer, hearing, reading,

in a Minister, Magistrate, Master of a Family; as lying, swearing,
filthy-talking, scoffing at Religion, opposition to godliness,
Sabbath-breaking, an humor of Good-fellowship, or the like, represent it self
to the eye of the World, in His ordinary carriage; and hang out as a rotten
fruit in the sight of the Sun; it is wont fearfully to infect or offend by
a contagious insinuation, and ill example, all about Him; to diffuse it is
venom to His Family, amongst His Sons, and Servants, over the Parish where
He lives, all companies where he comes, the whole Country round about,
especially, if He be a Man of eminency and Place.

5. I understand (...) in a genera^l notion, and not as restrained unto, or
resident in any species. And I know, that divisio m^li, in malum culpae and
malum poenae, is not generis univoci in species; but vocabuli aequivo^i in sua
aequivocata. Culpa habet plus de ratione mali, quam poena. Et non solum quam
poen^ sensibilis, quae consistit in privatione corporalium bonorum -- sed etiam
universaliter accipiendo poenam, secundum quod privatio gratia, vel gloriae,
poenae quaedam sunt. Aquin. p. 1. q. 48 Art. 6.
It is extremely ill. A far greater ill, then the eternal damnation of a
Man. For when He has Ilen many millions of years in the Lake of fire, and
under the dominion of the second death; He is never the nearer to satisfaction
for sin. Not all those Hellish ^lames through all eternity, can possibly
expiate the stain, or extingvish the sting of the least sin. Nay, the very
destruction of all the creatures in the world; of Men and Angels, Heaven and
Earth, is a great deal less ill, then to offend God with the least
transgression of His laws. For all the creatures of ten thousand worlds, were
they all extant, come infinitely short in excellency of worth, of the
Hearts-blood of Jesus Christ. And yet without the effusion of it, no sin
could ever have been pardoned, nor any Soul saved. A man would think it a
lesser ill to tell a lie, then to lie in Hell: But hear Chrysostom; Although
many think Hell to be the supreme and sorest of all evils; yet I think
thus, and thus will I daily preach: That it is far bitterer and more grievous
to offend Christ, then to be tormented with the pains of Hell.

6. It is full of most fearful effects.

1. It deprives every Impenitent. 1. Of the favor and love of God, the only
Fountain of all comfort, peace and happiness: which is incomparably the most
invalue-able loss, that can be imagined. 2. Of his portion in Christ's blood;
of which, tho the drops, weight and quantity be numbered, finite, and
measurable, yet the Person that shed it, has stamped upon it, such height of
price, excellency of merit, un-value-ablenes of worth; that he had infinitely
better have his portion in that sweetest wellspring of life and immortality;
then enjoy the riches, pleasures and glory of the whole World everlastingly.

For a bitter-sweet taste of which, for an ynch of time, He villanously
trampleth under-foote, as it were, that blessed blood, by wilfully cleaving to
His own ways, and furious following the swinge of His own sensual heart
(even against the check and contradiction of His grumbling conscience). 3. Of
the most blissful presence, freedom, and communication of the Holy Ghost;
and all those divine illuminations, spiritual feastings, sudden and secret
glimpses and glances of heavenly light, sweeter then sweetness it self,
wherewith that good Spirit is wont to visit and refresh the humbled hearts of
holy men. 4. Of the fatherly providence and protection of the blessed Trinity,
the glorious guard of Angels, the comfortable communion with the people of God,
and all the happy consequents of safety, deliverance and delight that flows
thence. 5. Of the unknown pleasures of an appeased conscience, a Jewel of
dearest price, to which all humane glory is but dust in the balance. Not the
most exquisite extraction of all manner of Music, Sets, or Consorts, vocal
or Isntrumental, can possibly conveigh so delicious a touch, and taste to the
outward ear of a Man; as the sound, and sense of a Certificate brought from
the Throne of mercy by the blessed Spirit, sealed with Christ's blood, to the
ear of the Soul, even amidst the most desperate confusions, in the evil Day;
when Comfort will be worth a World; and a good Conscience, ten thousand
earthly Crowns. 6. Of all true contentment in this life; of all Christian
right, and religious interest to any of the Creatures. For never was any sound
joy, or sanctified enjoyment of any thing in the world, found in that Man's
heart, which gives allowance to any lust, or lies delightfully in any sin. 7.
Of an immortal Crown, the un-speakeable joys of Heaven; that immeasurable,
and endless comfort, which there shall be fully and for ever enjoyed, with all
the children of God, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Christian
friends; yea, with the Lord Himself, and all His Angels, with Christ our
Savior, that Lamb slain for us, the Prince of glory, the glory of Heaven and
Earth; the brightness of the everlasting Light, etc. In a word, of all those
inexplicable, nay, unconceiveable excellencies, pleasures, perfections;
felicities, sweetnesses, beauties, glories, eternities above.

2. It does every hour expose Him to all those evils, which a Man destitute of
grace divine may commit; and unprotected from above, endure. It brings all
plagues. 1. Internal; Blindness of mind, Hardness of heart, deadness of
affection, searednesse of conscience, a reprobate sense, strong delusions, the
spirit of slumber, slavery to lust, estrangednesse from God, bondage under the
Devil, desperate thoughts, horror of heart, confusion of spirit, etc. And
spiritual mischiefs in this kind, more, and more dreadful, then either Tongue
can tell, or heart can think. Least of which, is far worse then all the
plagues of Egypt. 2. External. See Deuteronomy. 28.15. etc. 3. Eternal. See my
Sermon of the four last things.

3. By it is pestilent damning Property and poison, it turns Heaven into Hell,
Angels into Devils, Life into death, Light into darkness, sight into
blindness, Faith into distrust, hope into despair, Love into hate, humility
into pride, mercy into cruelty, security into fear, liberty into bondage,
health into sickness, plenty into scarceness, a Garden of Eden into a
desolate Wilderness, a fruitful Land into barrenness, Peace into war,
quietness into contention, Obedience into rebellion, Order into confusion,
virtues into vices, blessings into curses, etc. In a word, all kind of
temporal, and eternal felicities, and bliss, into all kinds of miseries, and
woe.

7. What heart, except it be all Adamant, and turned into a Rock of flint,
but possessing it self with feeling thoughts, and a sensible apprehension of
the incomprehensible greatness, excellency and dreadfulnesse of the mighty
Lord of Heaven and Earth, would not tremble and be strangely confounded to
transgress and break any one branch of His blessed Laws, especially,
purposely, and with pleasure; or to sin against Him willingly, but in the
least ungodly thought? For alas! Who art thou, that liftest up thy proud heart,
or whettest thy profane tongue, or bendest thy rebellious course against such
a Majesty? Thou art the vilest wretch that ever God made, next unto the Devil,
and His damned Angels; A base, and an unworthy Worm of the Earth, not worthy
to lick the dust, that lies under His feet; A most weak and frail
creature, Earth, ashes, or any thing that is naught; the dream of a shadow,
the very Picture of change, worse then vanity, less then nothing; Who, when
thy breath is gone, which may fall out many times in a moment, thou turnest
into dust, nay, rottenness and filth, much more loathsome, then the Dung of
the Earth; and all thy thoughts perish. But now on the other side, if thou cast
thine eyes seriously, and with intention upon that thrice glorious and highest
Majesty, the eyes of whose glory thou so provokest with thy filth and folly,
thou may most justly upon the commission of every sin cry out with the
Prophet: O Heavens be astonished at this: be afraid and utterly confounded!
Nay, thou might marvel, and it is Gods unspeakeable mercy, that the whole
frame of Heaven and Earth is not for one sin fearfully, and finally
dissolved, and brought to naught! For He against whom thou sinnest, inhabiteth
eternity, and unapprochable light: The Heaven is His Throne, and the earth his
footstool: He is the everlasting God, mighty, and terrible, the Creator of
the ends of the earth, ^c. The infinite splendor of his glory and majesty, so
dazles the eyes of the most glorious Seraphims, that they are glad to adore Him
with covered faces Duae aliae alae, quibus faciem legehant, satis indicant, ne

hosts is his name, whose power and punishments are so infinitely irresistable;
that He is able with one word to turn all the creatures in the world into
Hell; nay, even with the breath of His mouth to turn Heaven and Hell, and
Earth, and all things into nothing. How dare thou then so base and vile a
wretch, provoke so great a God?

8. Let the consideration, and compassion upon the immortality, and dearness
of that precious Soul that lies in thy bosom, curb thy corruptions at the
very first sight of sin, and make thee step back as though thou were ready
to tread upon a Serpent. Not all the bloody men upon earth, or desperate
Devils in Hell, can possibly kill, and extingvish the Soul of any man; it must
needs live, as long, as God Himself, and run parallel, with the longest line
of eternity. Only sin wounds Mors, quae non mod^ nos a praesin^t^^s mali^

had infinitely better never have bin, then be for ever. For by this means,
going on impenitently to that last Tribunal, it becomes immortally mortal,

as one of the Ancients speaks. It lives to death, and dies to life: never in
state of life or death yet ever in the pains of death, and the perpetuity of
life; It Is death is ever-living, and it is end is ever in beginning: Death
without death; End without end: Ever in the pangs of death, and never dead: not
able to dye, nor endure the pain: Pain exceeding not only, all patience, but
all resistance: No strength, to sustain nor ability to bear, that which
heareafter, whilst God is God, for ever must be borne. What a prodigious
Bedlam cruelty is it then for a man, by listening to the Syren-songs of this
false world, the lewd motions of His own treacherous heart, or the Devils
desperate counsel, to embrew His hands in the blood of His own everlasting
soul, and to make it die eternally? For a little paltry pleasure of some base
and rotten lust, and sleeting vanity, which passes away in the act, as the
taste of pleasant drink dies in the draught, to bring upon it in the other
world, torments whithout end, and beyond all compass of conceit? And his
madness is the more, because besides it is immortality, His Soul is
inco^parably more worth, then the whole world. The very sensitive Soul of a
little sly, says Musca sole praestantior S^^arte tur^ata ^^ne q^ererent, number

Austin truly, is more excellent then the Sun: How ought we then to prize, and
preserve from sin, our understanding, reasonable Souls, which make us in
that respect, like unto the Angels of God?

9. Ninthly, What an horrible thing is sin, whose weight an Omnipotent
strength, which does sustain the whole Frame of the world, is not able to
bear? Almighty God complains Isa. 1.14. even of the Sacrifices, and other
services of his own people, when they were performed with polluted hearts; and
professes, that He was weary to bear them. And how vile is it, that stirs up
in the dearest and most compassionate bowels of the All-mercifull God, such
implacable anger, that threw down so many glorious Angelical spirits, who
might have done Him so high honor for ever in the highest Heavens, into the
bottom of Hell, there most justly to continue Devils, and in extremest torment
everlastingly? Cast all mankind out of His favor, and from all felicity for
Adams sin? Micah 7.18.
caused Him, who delights in mercy, to create all the afflicting miseries in
Hell; eternal flames, streams of brimstone, chains of darkness, gnashing of
teeth, a Lake of fire, the bottomless Pit, and all those horrible torments
there? And that which does argue, and yet further amplify, the implacablenes
and depth of divine indignation; the infiniteness of sins provocation,
Isaiah 3^.33.
and desert: Tophet is said to be ordained of old: Everlasting fire to be
prepared for the Devil and His Angels: Matthew. 25.41.
As if the All-powerfull wisdom did deliberate, and as it were sit down, and
devise all st^^ging terrible ingredients, a temper of greatest torture to make
that dreadful fi^e, hellish pains, most fierce and raging, and a fit
instrument for the justice of so great and mighty a God to torment eternally
all impenitent reprobate Rebels. God is the Father of Spirits; our Souls are
the immediate Creation of His Almighty Hand; and yet to every one that goes on
impenitently in his trespasses, He has appointed, as it were a threefold
Hell. There are three things considerable in sin: 1. F^st autem peccatum
hommis inordinatio, atque perversit as, id est, a praestantiore conditore
aversio, and ad condita inferiora conversio. August ad Simplician. Lib. 1. q.
2. page 871.
Aversion from an infinite, sovereign, unchangeable good: 2. Conversion to a
finite mutable, momentany good: 3. Continuance in the same. To these three
several things in sin, there are answering three singular stings of
extremest punishment. To aversion from the chiefest Good, which is objectively
infinite, there answers Pain of loss as they call it, Privation of Gods
glorious presence, and separation from those endless joys above; which is an
infinite loss. To the inordinate conversion to transitory things, there
answers Pain of sense, which is intensively finite, as is the pleasure of
sin; And yet so extreme, that none can conceive the bitterness thereof, but
the Soul that suffers it, nor that neither; except it could comprehend the
Almighty wisdom of Him that did create it. To the eternity of sin,
remaining for ever in stain and guilt, answers the eternity of punishment.
For we must know At inquiunt: Sine sine puniri non debet culpa cum sine.
Iustus ninarum est omaipotens Deus: Et quod non aeterno peccato commissum est,
aeterno non debet puniri tormento* Quibus citius respondemus, quod recte
dicerem; si^udex iustus dist^ctusqu^ veniens, non corda hominum sed sacta
pensaret. Iniqui enim ideo tun^ cum sine deliquerunt; quia cum sine vixerunt.
Vn^uissent quippe sine sine ^ive^e, ut sine sine potuiss^nt in iniquitatibus

16. in cap. 41. Job.
that every impenitent sinner would sin ever if he might live ever; and
casts himself by sinning into an impossibility of ever ceasing to sin of
Himself: as a Man that casts himself into a deep Pit, can never of
Himsel^e rise out of it again: And therefore naturally eternity of punishment
is due to sin. How prodigious a thing then is sin, and how infinitely to
be abhorred, and avoided, that by a malignant meritorious poison and
provocation, does violently wrest out of the hands of the Father of mercies,
and God of all comfort, the full vials of that unquenchable wrath, which brings
caselesse, endless, and remediless torments upon His own creatures, and
those originally most excellent.

10. Tenthly, The height and inestimablenesse of the price, that was paid for
the expiation of it, does clearly manifest, nay, infinitely aggravate the
execrable misery of sin, and extreme madness of all that meddle with it. I
mean the hearts-blood of Jesus Christ, blessed for ever: which was of such
pretiousnesse and power, that being let out by a Spear, it amazed the whole
Frame of Nature; darkened the Sun miraculously, (for at that time it stood in

opposition to the Moon) shook the Earth, which shrunk and trembled under
it, opened the Graves, clave the Stones, rent the Veil of the Temple, from the
bottom to the top, etc. Now it was this alone, and nothing but this could
possibly cleanse the filth of sin. Had all the dust of the earth been turned
into silver, and the stones into pearls; Should the maine and boundless Ocean
have streamed nothing but purest gold; would the whole world, and all the
creatures in Heaven and Earth have offered themselves to be annihilated before
His angry face; Had all the blessed Angels prostrated themselves at the foot
of their Creator: yet in the Point of redemption of Mankind, and purgation of
sin, not any, nor all of these, could have done any good at all. Nay, if the
Son of God Himself, which lay in His bosom, should have supplicated and
solicited, (I mean without Cum dicimus ^lium (...) na^uram. (...) (...)

suffering and shedding His blood) the Father of all mercies; He could not
have been heard in this case. Either the Son of God must die, or all Mankind
be eternally damned. Even then, when thou art provoked to sin, think
seriously, and sensibly of the price that upon necessity must be paid for it,
before it be pardoned.

11. Sinful pleasures are attended with a threefold bitter sting. Whereof see
my Directions for walking with God, pa. 171. Which though the Devil hides from
them in the heat of temptation; yet in His seasons, to serve his own turn,
He sets them on with a vengeance.

12. Compare the vast, and unvalu-able difference, between yielding to the
entisement, and conquering the temptation to sin. For which purpose, look
upon Joseph and David, two of Gods dearest servants. And consider the
consequents: what a deal of honor and comfort did afterward crown the head,
and the heart of the one: And what horrible mischiefs and miseries fell upon
the family, and Ps. 51.3. My sin is eve^ before me.
grisly horrors upon the conscience of the other. Survay also the distinct See
the life of Galeaci^s Caracci^lus, containing the Story of His admirable
conversion from Popery, and his forsaking of His Marquesdome for the Gospels
sake: written first in Italian, translated into Latin by Beza; and into

Stories of Galeacius Caracciolus, and Franciscus Spira, then which in their
several kinds, there is nothing left to the memory of the latter times more
remarkable. And you shall find in them as great a difference, as between an
Heaven and Hell upon earth. The one withstanding unconquerably variety of
mighty entisements to renounce the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and return to
Popery, besides the sweet peace of His Soul, attained that honor in the
Church of God, that He is in some measure See Crashaw in His second Dedicatory
Epistle before the Book.

of God and our true Religion, to the Synagogue of Satan, and abominations of
the scarlet Whore, besides the raging and desperate confusion he brought upon
His own spirit, became such a spectacle to the eye of Christendom, as has
been hardly heard of.

vanishing delight of the choicest, sensual, worldly contentment, if thou will, of thy sweetest sin, with the exquisitnesse and eternity of Hellish
torments. Out of which, might an impenitent reprobate wretch, be assured of
enlargement, after He had endured them so many thousand, thousand years, as
there are sands on the Seashore, hairs upon His head, stars in the
firmament, grass piles upon the ground, Creatures both in Heaven and Earth;
He would think Himself happy, and as it were in Heaven already. See before
page 39. But when all that time is past, and infinite millions of years
besides, they are no nearer end, then when they begun; nor He nearer out, then
when He came in. The torments of Hell are most horrible; yet I know not
whether this incessant desperate cry in the conscience of a damned Soul, I
must never come out, does not outgoe them all in horror. What an height of
madness is it then, to purchase a moment of fugitive follies, and fading
pleasures, with extremity of never ending pains?

When thou art stepping over the threshold toward any vile act, lewd House,
dissolute company, or to do the Devil service in any kind, which God forbid;
suppose thou see Jesus Christ coming toward Thee, as He lay in the arms
of Joseph of Arimathea, newly taken down from the Cross, woefully wounded,
wanne and pale; His Body all gore-blood; the beauty of His blessed and heavenly
face, darkened and disfigured by the stroke of death; speaking thus unto Thee:
Oh! Go not forward upon any terms, Commit not this sin by any means. It
was this and the like, that drew me down out of the Nonne Dei filius cuns

arms of my Father, from the fullness of joy, and Fountain of all bliss; to
put on this corruptible, and miserable flesh; to hunger and thirst; to watch
and pray; to groan and sigh; to offer up strong cries and tears to the Father
in the days of my flesh: To drink off the dregs of the bitter cup of His
feirce wrath; to wrestle with all the forces of infernal powers; to lay down
my life in the gates of Hell, with intolerable, and, save by my self,
unconquerable pain; and thus now to lie in the arms of this mortal Man, all
torn and rent in pieces with cruelty and spite, as thou see. What an heart
have thou, that dare go on, against this dear entreaty of Jesus Christ?

15. When thou art unhappily moved, to break any branch of Gods blessed Law,
let the excellency and variety of His incomparable mercies come presently into
thy mind: a most ingenuous sweet and mighty motive, to hinder and hold off all
gracious hearts from sin* How is it possible, but a serious survay of the
riches of Gods goodness, forbearance and long-suffering leading thee to
repentance, to more forwardnes and fruitfulnes in the good Way; The public
miracles of mercy, which God has done in our days, for the preservatio^ of
the Gospel, this kingdom, ourselves, and our posterity; especially, drowning
the Spanish invincible Armado, discovering, and defeating the Powder Plot,
sheilding Q. Elizabeth, the most glorious Princess of the world, from a world
of Antichristian cruelties; saving us from the Papists bloody expectations at
Her death; etc. The particular, and private Catalogve of thine own personal
favors from Gods bountiful hand, which thine own conscience, can easily
lead Thee unto; and readily run over from thine infancy to the present;
wonderful protections in thine unregenerate time* that miracle of mercies, thy
conversion, (if thou be already in that happy state); all the motions of Gods
holy Spirit in thine heart, many checks of conscience, fatherly corrections,
excellent means of sanctification, as worthy a ministry in many Places, as
ever the world enjoyde; Sermon upon sermon; Sabbath after Sabbath; bearing with
thee after so many times breaking thy covenants; Oportunities to at^aine the
highest degree of godliness, that ever was; etc. I say how can it be, but
that the reuise of these and innumerable mercies more, should so mollify thy
heart, that thou should have no heart at all, nay infinitely abhor, to
displease or any way dishonor, that High and dreadful Majesty, whose free
grace was the Wellhead and first Fountain of them all?

Let this meditation of Gods mercies to keep from sin, be quickened by
considering: 1. That thou art far worthier, to be now burning with the most
abominable Sodomite in the bottom of Hell; then to be crowned with any of
these loving kindnesses: That if thou were able to do Him all the honor,
service and worship, which all the Saints both militant and triumphant do; it
would come infinitely short of the merit of the least of all His mercies unto
Thee in Jesus Christ. 2. How unkindelylie God takes the neglect of His
extraordinary kindenesses unto us. 2. Sam. 12.7, etc. 1. Sam. 27.28.31. Ezech.
16.

16. Mark well, and be amazed of thine own fearful and desperate folly;
when thou fallest deliberately into any sin: Thou lajest, as it were, in the
one scale of the Balance, the glory of Almighty God, the endless ioies of
Heaven, the loss of thine immortal Soul, the precious blood of Christ, etc.
And in the other, some rotten pleasure, earthly pelf, worldly preferment,
fleshly lust, sensual vanity: And suffers this, prodigious madness! Be
astonished, O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid! to outweigh all
those.

17. Upon the first assault of every sin, say thus unto thy self: If I now
yield, and commit this sin; I shall either repent, or not repent: If I do not
repent, I am undone; If I do repent, it will cost me incomparably, more
hearts-greife, then the pleasure of the sin is worth.

18. Consider, that for that very sin, to which thou art now tempted, Revel.
21.8. Heb. 13.4. 1. Thessal. 4.6.
suppose lying, lust, ouerreaching thy Brother, etc. many millions are already
damned, and even now burning in Hell. And when thy foot is upon the brinke,
stay, and think upon the wages. And know for a truth, that if thou falelst
into that sin, thou art fallen into Hell, if God help not out.

19. Never be the bolder to give way unto any wickedness; to exercise thine
heart with covetousness, cruelty, ambition, revenge, adulterjes, speculative
wantonness, selfe-uncleannesse, or any other solitary sinfulness; because
thou art alone, and no mortal eye looks upon Thee. For if thine heart
condemn thee, God is greater then thine heart, and knows all things; and
will condemn thee much more. If thy conscience, be as a thousand witnesses;
God, who is the Lord of thy conscience will be more then a million of
witnesses. And thou may be assured, Howsoever thou blessest thy self in thy
secrecy, that what sin soever, is now acted, in the very retyredst corner of
thine heart, or any ways most solitarily by thy Self; tho in the mean time
it be concealed, and lie hid in as great darkness, as it was committed,
until that last and great Day, yet then it must most certainly Iniquitates
tuae omnibus populis nudabuntur, and cunctis agminibus patebunt, u^iversa

20. Consider the resolute resistance, and mortifyed resolutions against sin,
and all entisements thereunto of many, upon whom, the Sun of the Gospel did
not shine with such beauty and fulness, as it does upon us* neither were so
many heavenly discoveries in the kingdom of Christ, made known unto them, as
our days have seen. (For upon our times, which makes our sins a great deal
more sinful, has happily fallen, an admirable Confluence of the saving light
and learning, experience, and excellency of all former Ages, besides the
extraordinary additions of the present; which with a glorious Noonetide of

sanctification). Hear Ego sic cense^, sic a^i^ue praedicaho, (...) acerbius

Chrysostom, But I think thus, and this will I ever preach; that it is much
bitterer to offend Christ, then to be tormented in the pains of Hell. He
that writes the life of Anselme, Nilin munao, quantum pe^care, timebat.
Conscientia mea te ie, non mention; quia saepe ill^m ^^b veritatis testimonio
profitentem a^di^imus: Quod si hine peccati horrorem; hinc ^^serni lolorem
corporaliter cerneret; and necessario uni little immergideberet; prius infernum,
quam peccatum appeterei. Aliud quoque non minus forsan aliquibus mirum dicere

says thus of Him; He feared nothing in the world more, then to sin. My
conscience bearing me witness, I lie not; For we have often heard Him
profess: That if on the on^ hand* He should see corporally, the horror of
sin; on the other the pains of Hell; and might necessarily be plunged into
the one, He would choose Hell rather then sin. And an other thing also no
less perhaps wonderful to some, He was wont to say: To wit; That He would
rather have Hell, being innocent, and free from sin; then polluted with the
filth thereof, possess the kingdom of Heaven. It is reported of an other
ancient holy Man, that He was wont to say: He would rather be torn in
pieces with wild horses, then wittingly and willingly commit any sin. Jerome
also in one of His Epistles, tells a Aliu^ juveniliaetate s^orentem, in
amoenissim^s hortulos praecepit abduci. Ibique inter (...) candentia, and
rubentes rosas; cum leni juxta murmr aquarum serperet ri^us, and mollifihilo

story of a young Man, of most invincible courage, and constancy in the
Profession of Christ, under some of the bloody Persecuting Emperors, to this
sense: They had little hope as it seems, to conqver Him by torture; and
therefore they take this course with Him: They brought Him into most fragrant
Gardens, flowing with all pleasure and delight; there they laid Him upon a Bed
of Down softly enwrapped in a net of silk; amongst the Lillies, and the
Roses, the delicious murmr of the streams, and the sweet whistling of the
leaves; they all depart, and in comes a beautiful strumpet, and uses all the
abominable tricks of Her impure Art, and who^sh villainies to draw Him to her
desire: Whereupon the young Man, fearing that He should now be conqvered by
folly, who was Conqverer over fury, out of an infinite detestation of sin,
bites off a piece of His Tongue with His own teeth, and spits it in the face of
the whore: And so hinders the hurt of sin, by the smart of his wound. I might
have begun with Joseph, who did so bravely and blessedly beat back, and
trample under His feet the sensual solicitations of His wanton and wicked
Mistress. He had pleasure and preferment in His eye, which were strongly
offered in the temptation; but He well knew, that not all the offices and
honors in Egypt, could take off the guilt of that filth; and therefore He
resolved rather to lie in the dust, then rise by sin: How can I do this
great wickedness, and sin against God? I might pass along to the Moth^^ and
seven brethren. 2. Mac. 7. who chose rather to pass through horrible tortures,
and a most cruel death, then to eat swines ^lesh against the Law: And so come
down along to that noble Army of Martyrs in Q. Mary's time; who were contented
with much patience, and resolution to part with all, wife, children, liberty,
livelihood, life it self; even to lay it down in the flames, rather then to
submit to that Man of sin; or to subscribe to any one Point of His Devilish
Doctrine.

Thus as you have heard, I have tendered many reasons to restrain from sin;
which by the help of God may serve to take off the edge of the most eager
temptation; to cool the heat of the most furious entisement; to embitter the
sweetest bait, that draws to any sensual delight. Now my most thirsty desire
and earnest entreaty is, that every one into whose hands, by Gods providence
this Book of mine shall fall, after the perusal of them, would pause a while
upon purpose, that He may more solemnly vow, and resolve that ever hereafter,
when he shall be set upon, and assaulted by allurement to any sin, He will
first have recourse unto these twenty Considerations, I have here recommended
unto Him, to help in such cases; and with a punctual seriousness, let them
sink into His heart, before He proceed and pollute Himself. I could be
content, if it were pleasing unto God, that these lines which thou now read,
were writ with the warmest blood in mine heart, to represent unto thine eye,
the dear affectionatenesse of my Soul, for thy spiritual and eternal Good;
so that thou would be throwly persuaded, and now before thou pass any
further, sincerely promise so to do!

3. Thirdly, The point may serve to set out the excellency of that high and
heavenly Art, of co^forting afflicted consciences. The more dangerous and
desperate the wound is, the more does it magnify, and make admirable the
mystery and method of the Cure and recovery. Which were it well known, and
wisely practiced; what a world of unnecessary slavish torture in troubled minds
would it prevent? So many thousands of poor abused, deluded Souls should not
perish, by the damning flatteries, and cruel mercies of unskillfull Dawbers:
what an heaven of spiritual light-somnesse, and joy might shine in the hearts,
and show it self in the faces of Gods people? Until it please the Lord to
move the hearts of my learned and holy Brethren in populous Cities and great
congregations, who must needs have much imploiment, and variety of experiments
this way; or some special men extraordinarily endowed and exercised herein,
put to their h^lping hands, and furnish the Church with more large and exact
discourses in this kind, take in good part this Essay of mine.

Wherein I first desire to discover and rectify some ordinary aberrations about
spiritual Cures. Which fall out, when the Physician of the Soul,

1. Applies unseasonably the Cordials of the Gospel, and co^forts of Mercy;
when the Corrosives of the Law and comminations of Judgment are convenient and
suitable. Were it not absurd in Surgery, to pour a most sovereign Bal^am of
exqvisite composition, and inestimable price upon a sound part? It is far
more unseemely and senseless, of and an infinitely more pestilent consequence
in any Ministerial passages, to profer the blood of Christ, and promises of
life to an unwounded conscience, as belonging unto it, as yet. It is the only
right everlasting Method to turn men from darkness to light, from the power of
Satan unto God; and all the Men of God and Master Builders, who have ever set
themselves sincerely to serve God in their Ministry, and to save Souls* have
followed the same course; to wit, First to wound by the Law, and then to heal
by the Gosp^ll. We must be humbled in the sight of the Lord; before He lift
us up. Iam. 4.10. We must be sensible of our spiritual blindness,
captivity, poverty; before we can heartily seek to be savingly illightned
enlarged from the Devils slavery, and enriched with grace. There must be sense
of misery, before showing of mercy; Crying, I am unclean, I am unclean,
before opening the Fountain for uncleanness; stinging, before curing by the
Brazen Serpent; smart for sin, before a Plaster of Christ's blood;
Brokennesse of heart, before binding up. God himself De utraque apertion^

promise Christ, upon their coming in, to illighten and make them lightsome,
with raising their thoughts to a fruitful contemplation of the glory,
excellency, and sweetness of His blessed kingdom. Isaiah in his first
chapter, from the mouth of God does in the first place behave Himself like a
Son of Thunder, pressing upon the consciences of those to whom He was sent,
many heinous sins; horrible ingratitude, fearful falling away, formality in
Gods worship, cruelty and the like: afterward verse. 16.17. He invites to
repentance: And then follows verse. 18. Come now and let us reason together,

who taught as one having authority, and not as the Scribes: With what power,
and piercing, did our Lord and Master labor to open the eyes, search the
hearts, and wound the consciences of His Hearers, to fit them for the Gospel,
and His own dear Hearts blood? See Mat. 5. etc. And 23. And 25 etc. Of John
Baptist, who by the mightiness of His Ministerial spirit, accompanied with
extraordinary strength from Heaven, did strike through the hearts of those that
heard Him, with such astonishment about their spiritual state; with such
horror for their former ways, and fear of future vengeance, that they came
unto Him thick, and threefold, as they say: And the people asked Him saying,
what shall we do then? Then came also Publicans to be baptized, and said unto
Him, Master, what shall we do? And the Soldiers likewise demanded of Him,
saying, And what shall we do? Luke 3.10.12.14. Of Peter: who Act. 2. being
now freshly inspired, and illuminated from above with large and extraordinary
effusions of the holy Ghost, shadowed by cloven fiery tongs; in the very prime
and flower of His Ministerial wisdom, bends Himsel^e to break the hearts of
His Hearers. Amongst other pie^ci^g Passages of His searching Sermon, He tells
them to their faces, they standing before Him stained with the horrible guilt
of the dearest blood, that ever was shed upon earth, most worthy to have been
gathered up by the most glorious Angels, in vessels of gold; that they had
crucified and slain that just and holy One, the Lord of life, Jesus of

the Bar, and might perhaps, by a general plausible discourse, without
piercing or particularizing, have insinuated into the affections, and won the
favors of His Hearers, who were to be His Judges; and so made way for His
enlargement, and particular welfare; yet He for all this, very resolutely and
unreservedly, crosses and opposes their greedy, lustful and careless
humors with a right searching, terrifying Sermon of righteousness,
temperance, and judgment to come. Acts 24.24.25. That unhappy Felix was a
fellow polluted with abominable adultery, and very infamous for his cruel and
covetous oppressions, and by consequent unapprehensive, and fearelesse of that

well that that was not the way; neither best for them, nor for His Masters

course to cause the Tyrant tremble; that thereby He might either be sitted

Austen, that famous Disputer in His time counsels to this purpose in this
Point: (I express the sense and sum, and no more then may be collected and
concluded from the Place; I will not ever tie my self grammatically and
pedantically to the words, precisely, and to render verbatim; save only in some
cases; as of Controversy, or some other such like necessity of more Punctual
quotation).

The Conscience is not to be healed, if it be not wounded. Thou preachest and
pressest the Law, comminations, the Judgment to come, and that with much
earnestness and importunity: He which hears, if He be not terrified, if
He be not troubled, is not to be comforted. Another hears, is stirred, is
st^ng, takes on extremely: Cure His contritions, because He is cast down and
confounded in Himself.

Chrysostom, had thoroughly frighted the minds of His Hearers, with the terror
of judgment, and expectation of torment; and with the name of an Axe, and
their rejection, and entertainment of other children; and by doubling the
punishment, to wit, of being hewed down and cast into the fire: when He had
thus every way tamed, and taken down their stubbornness, and from fear of so
many evils, had stirred them up to a desire of deliverance; then at length He
makes mention of Christ.

God powers not the oil of His mercy, says Dues non infanditoleum

So also are all our modern Divines, who are instructed unto the Kingdom of
Heaven.

peccatorem. Methodus haec servatur in concionibus, ut ad extremum consolationi
locus detur. In 2. Sam. 12.


Peter Martyr magnifies Nathans method of preaching, and commends it to all the
Ministers of God. He first proposes a Parable, as we do Doctrines, for the
illumination, and conviction of the understanding. Then He applies it more
particularly, and to the present^ where He does notably exagitate and
aggravate the Sin, by recounting, and opposing Gods extraordinary bounty and
most merciful dealing with David, by the cause of it, contempt of the Lords
commandment, and dreadful things ensuing thence: Afterward that He might
strike the heart through with astonishment and dread, He threatens terribly: At
last upon compunction, and crying, I have sinned, He sweetly comfort and
rayseth to the assurance of Gods favor again.

If this course must be taken with relapsed Christians; why not much more,
with those who are stark dead in trespasses and sins?

It is the care of those Ministers, which divide Gods Word aright, say our ^
great Divines of Great Britain, first fitly and wisely to wound the
Consciences of their hearers with the terrors of the Law, and after to raise
them by the Promises of the Gospel, etc.

The Spirit first terrifies those, who are to be justified, with the Law:
breaking and humbling them with threats scourges and lashes of Conscience, that
thereby despairing of themselves, they may fly unto Christ.

Davenant* is to be propounded to the impious and impenitent -- to strike
terror into their hearts and to demonstrate their just damnation, except they
repent, and she to Jesus Christ.

Perkins that great Light of our Church, both for soundness of learn^ng,
sincer^ty of judgment, and insight into the Mystery of Christ, te^ching, How
Repentance is wrought, tel^ us,

That first of all a Man must have knowledge o^ four things: Of the Law of
God; Of sin against the Law; Of the guilt of sin; and of the Judgment of
God against sin, which is His eternal wrath: In the second Place must follow
an application of the former knowledge to a Man's self, by the work of the
conscience assisted by the holy Ghost, which for that cause is called the
spirit of bondage; in this manner.

The breaker of the Law is guilty of eternal wrath, says the Mind:

But I am a breaker of the Law of God, says the Conscience as a Witness, and
an Accuser:

Therefore I am guilty of eternal death, says the same Conscience, as a Judge.

Every Law shall have His part in the Lake, which burns with fire and
brimstone: Revel. 21.8.

But I am a Liar:

Therefore I shall have my part in that everlasting fiery Lake.

And so of other sins; Covetousness, Cruelty, Drunkenness, Whoredom,
Swearing, Defrauding, Temporizing, Usury, Filthiness, Self-uncleannesse,
Foolish talking, ^esting, Ephesians. 5.4. Revellings, Galat. 5.21. Profaning the
Lords Day, strange apparel, Zeph. 1.8. And innumerable sins more; which
being all severally pressed upon the heart, by a discourse of the guilty
conscience, as I have said, must needs full sorely crush it with many cutting
conclusions: from which set on by the spirit of bondage, is wont to arise much
trouble of mind; which, says He, is commonly called, the sting of the
conscience, or penitence, Act. ^.37.
and the compunction of heart. And then succeedes seasonably, and comfortably
the work of the Gospel. The Soul being thus sensible of and groaning under
the burden of all sin, is happily See Isa. 57.15. Mat. 11.28. and 9.13.
fitted for all the glorious revelations of the abundant riches of Gods dearest
mercies; for all the comforts, graces and favors which shine from the face of
Christ; for all the expiations, refreshings, and exultations, which spring out
of that blessed Fountain, Zech. 13.1.
opened for sin and for uncleanness.

Never any of Gods Children, says Of Repentance. Sern. 7.

The course warranted unto us by the Scriptures, says The Preachers (...). page
201.202.203.204
Hieron, is this: First, to endeavor the softning of our Hearers hearts, by
bringing them to the sight and sense of their own wretchedness, before we
adventure to apply the riches of Gods mercy in Christ Jesus. The preaching of
the Gospel is compared by our Savior Himself unto the Sowing of seeds as
therefore the ground is first torn up with the pl^^gh, Mat. 13.
before the seed be committed unto it: so the f^llow ground of our hearts must
first be broken up with the sharpness of the Law, Ier. 4.3.
and the very terror of the Lord, 2. Cor. 5.^^.
before we can be fit to entertain the sweet seed of the Gospel -- I would
have a Preacher to preach peace, and to aim at nothing more, then the comfort
of the Souls of Gods people: yet I would have Him withal, frame his course to
the manner of Gods appearing to Elijah. The Text says, 1. ^^g. 19 12.12.
that first a mighty strong wind rent the Mountains, and brake the rocks:
then, after that came an earthquake; and after the earthquake came fire: and
after all these, then came a still, and a soft voice. After the same manner, I
would not have the still and mild voy^e of the Gospel come, till the strong
tempest of the Law has rent the sto^y hearts of men, and have made the^^
beli^es to tremble, Habak. 3.16.
and rottenness to enter into their bones. -- Or at least, because our
Auditories are mixed, consisting of men* of diverse humors, it shall be good
for Him to deliver His doctrine with that caution, that neither the humbled
souls may be affrighted with the severity of Gods judgments, nor the profane
and unrepentant grow presumptuous by the abundance of Gods mercy. Prou. 27.7.
-- The person that is full, despises the hony-combe, says Solomon: And what
does a proud Pharisie, or a churlish Nabal, or a Politic Gallio, or a
scoffing Ishmael, care to hear of the breadth, Ephesians. 3.18.
and length, and depth, and height of the love of God in his Son Jesus?
Except it be to settle them faster upon their lees. Act. 7.51.

bridle, and a rod to the Fools back, etc. -- He that intends to do any

The Word of God, says In His Commentary upon the Revel. c. 14.
Forbes, has three degrees of operation in the hearts of men. For, first it
falls to men's ears as the sound of many waters, a mighty great, and confused
sound, and which commonly, brings neither terror, nor joy, but yet a
wondering, and acknowledgement of a strange force, and more then humane power.
This is that effect which many felt, hearing Christ, when they were astonished
at His Doctrine, Mark. 1.22.27. Luke 1.32. Ioh. 7.46.
as teaching with authority. What manner doctrine is this? Never man spoke like
this man. This effect falls even to the reprobate, which wonder and vanish:
Ha^ak. 15. Act. 13.41. The next effect is the voice of thund^r. Which brings
not only wonder, but fear also: not only fills the ears with sound, and
the heart with astonishment, but moreover shakes and terifyeth the conscience.
And this second effect may also befall a reprobate. As Felix. Act. 24. The
third effect is proper to the elect: the sound of harping, while the word not
only ravish^th with admiration, and strikes the Conscience with terror; but
also, lastly fills it with sweet peace and joy, etc. Now albeit the first
two degrees may be without the last; yet none feel the last, who have not in
some degree, felt both the first two.

Answ. Who can tell, that these greeved not? It follows not that they had no
grief, because none is recorded. All particular actions and circumstances of
Actions are not recorded: It is enough that the grief of some, as of the
Jews, Acts 2.37. and 16 29. Luke ^ 38.
of the Iaylour, of the woman that washed Christ's feet with Her tears* and of
others, is recorded.

Lidia might be prepared before she heard Paul. For sh^e accompanied them
which went out to pray, Acts 16.13 14.
and she worshipped God: Or else Her heart might be then touched, when she
heard Paul preach. The like may be said of those which heard Peter, Act.
10.41.45.
when Her preached to Cornelius; And of others. Certain it is that a man must
both see and feel Hi^ wretchedness, and be wounded in Soul for it before
Faith can be wrought in Him. Yet I deny not, but there may be great difference
in the manner and measure of greeving, etc.

and our justification with Him.

The preparation to repentance. (He means Evangelicall) are those legal sits
of fear and terror, which are both in nature and time too, before Faith.

pains of the travel going before; so neither, no true repentance without
some terrors of the Law, and streights of Conscience. -- The reason is plain.
None can have repentance, but such as Christ calls to Repentance. Now He calls
only sinners to Repentance. Mat. 9.13. even sinners heavy laden with the sense
of Gods wrath against sin. Mat. 11.28. He comes only to save the lost
sheep, that is such sheep, as feel themselves lost in themselves, and know
not how to find the way to the fold. It is said Romans 8.15. Ye have not
received the spirit of bondage again, to fear: which shows, that once they
did receive it, namely, in the very first preparation unto conversion, that
then the spirit of God in the Law did so bear witness unto the^, of their
bondage and miserable slavery, that it made them to tremble. Now there, under
the person of the Romans, the Apostle speaks to all Believers, and so shows,
that it is every Christians common case.

Dike of the Deceitfulnes of Man's Heart. cap. 15. p. 190.
Gods mercy may not be such, whereby His Truth in any sort should be
impeached. As it should, if it be prostituted indifferently and promiscuously
to all, as well the insolent, and impenitent, as the poor humble, and broken
hearted sinner. For unto these latter only is the promise of mercy made. And
if to others, the gate of mercy should be set open; Gods mercies (as Solomon
says of the wicked's, that they are cruel mercies) should be false and
unjust. mercies. But God never yet learned so to be merciful, as to make
Himself false and unfaithful.

The first thing that draws unto Christ, is to consider our miserable estate
without Him. D. P.
-- Therefore we see that the Law drives men to Christ: And the Law does it by
showing a Man His sin, and the curse due unto the same. -- We must know, that
nothing performed of us can give satisfaction in this matter of humiliation. --
Yet it is such a thing without which we cannot come to Christ. It is as much
as if a man should say, the Physician is ready to heal Thee, but then it is
required, that Thou must have a sense of the disease: etc! No Man will come to
Christ except He be hungry. Only those that are troubled receive the Gospel.

No Man will take Christ for his Husband, till He come to know and feel the
Weight of Satan's yoke. Till that time, He will never come to take upon Him the
yoke of Christ.

To all you I speak, that are humbled: Others that mind not this Doctrine,
regard not the things of this nature; But you that mourn in Zion, that are
brokenhearted; you that know the bitterness of sin, to you is the salvation
sent.

C^lverwell in His Treatise of Faith p. 45
Under the causes I comprehend all that work of God, whereby He works Faith
in any, which stands especially in these three things:

1. That God by His word, and Spirit first illightneth the understanding,
truly, to conceive the Doctrine of Man's misery, and of His full recovery by
Christ.

2. Secondly, by the same means He works in His heart, both such sound
sorrow for His misery, and fervent desire after Christ the remedy; that He can
never be at quiet, till He enjoy Christ:

3. Thirdly, God so manifests His love in freely offering Christ with all His
benefits to Him a poor sinner, that thereby he draws Him so to give credit
to God, therein, that He gladly accepts Christ offered unto Him. These three
works of God, whosoever finds to have bin wrought in Himself, He may
thereby know certainly He has Faith. But without these, what change of life
soever may be conceived, there can be no certainty of Faith.

Throgmorton in His Treatise of Faith. page 149.
The Law first breaks us, and kills us with the sight, and guilt of sin,
before Christ cures us, and binds us up.

The holy Ghost works and makes Faith effectual by these three Acts: D. P.


1. First, it puts an efficacy into the Law, and makes that powerful to work
on the heart; to make a man poor in spirit; so that he may be fit to receive
the Gospel. -- The Spirit of bondage must make the Law effectual; as the
Spirit of adoption does the Gospel, etc.

2. The second work, is to reveal Christ, when the heart is prepared by the
spirit in the first work, then in the next place, He shows the unsearchable
riches of Christ, what is the hope of His calling, and the glorious inheritance
prepared for the Saints; what is the exceeding greatness of His power in them
that believe. I say we need the Spirit to show these things, etc.

3. The third Act of the Spirit, is, The testimony which he gives to our
spirit, in telling us that these things are ours. When the heart is prepared by
the Law; and when these things are so showed unto us, that we prize them, and
long after them, yet there must be a third thing: To take them to our selves,
to believe they are ours: and there needs a work of the Spirit for this. For
tho the promises be never so clear, yet having nothing but the promises, you
shall never be able to apply them to your selves. But when the holy Ghost
shall say, Christ is thine, All these things belong to Thee, and God is thy
Father; when that shall witness to our spirit by a work of His own, Then
shall we believe, etc!

P. Baine in his Sermon. upon Ioh 3.16. p. 39.
This is the order observed in our justification: 1. First There is a sight of
our misery, to which we are brought by the Law. 2. Secondly, There is by the
Gospel an holding forth of Christ, as our redemption from sin and death. 3.
Thirdly, there is a working of Faith in the heart to rest on Christ, as the
ransom from sin and death. Now when a man is come hither, He is truly and
really just.

Cade in his Iustific. of the Church of Engl. Lib. 1. Cap. 5. Sc^^. 1.
We teach that in trve conversion a man must be wounded in his conscience by
the sense of his sins; His contrition must be compungent, and vehement,
bruising, breaking, renting the heart, and feeling she throws (as a woman
laboring of Child) before the New Creature be brought forth, or Christ truly
formed in Him. It is not done without bitterness of the Soul; without care,
indignation, revenge. 2. Cor. 7.11. But as some Infants, are borne with less
pain to the mother, and some with more: so may the new-man be regenerated, in
some with more, in some with less anxiety of travel. But surely grace is not
infused into the heart of any sinner, except there be at least so great
affliction of Spirit for sin foregoing that He cannot but ^eele it, etc.

D.S. in his Bruised Reed. page 13.14.15.
This bruising is required before conversion. 1. That so the Spirit may make
way for it self into the heart by levelling all proud high thoughts! etc 2. To
make us set an high price upon Christ's death -- This is the cause of relapses,
and Apostasies, because men never smarted for sin at the first; They were not
long enough under the lash of the Law. Hence this inferior work of the Spirit
in bringing down high thoughts, is necessary before conversion.

By this time it does most clearly, and plentifully appear; what a foul, and
fearful fault it is; for men, either in the managing of their Public
ministry; or more private Passages, of conference, visitations of the sick,
consultations about a good estate to Godward, and other occasions of like
nature; to apply Jesus Christ and the promises, to promise life and safety in
the evil Day, to Souls as yet not soundly illightned and afflicted with sight
of sin, and sense of Gods wrath; to consciences never truly wounded and
awaked. I insisted the longer upon this Point, because I know it full well, to
be a most universal, and prevailing Policy of the Devil, whereby he keeps
many thousands in His cursed slavery, and from salvation: To confirm as many
Pastors as He can possibly, willing enough to drive their Flocks before them
to damnation, in an ignorant, or affected Prejudice, and forbearance, of that
saving method of bringing Souls out of Hell, mentioned before; and made good
with much variety of evidence: And to nourish also in the hearts of natural
men, a strong and sturdy disconceite, opposition and raging, against downeright
dealing, and those men of God (able as they say, but falsely and furiously
against their own Souls by their terrible teaching to drive their hearers to
distraction, Selfe-destruction, or despair) who take the only right course to
convert them and to bring them to Jesus Christ as He Himself invites them, to
wit, laboring and heavy laden with their sins, Matthew. 11.28.

Dawbers then, who serve Satan's craft in this kind, and all those who dispense
their ministry without all spiritual discretion and good conscience, of whom
there are too many, as great strangers to the right way of working grace in
others, as to the work of grace in themselves; I say, they are a generation of
dangerous men. Old excellent, as they say in an accursed Art of conducting
poor blinded Souls, merrily, toward everlasting misery, and setting them
down in the very midst of Hell, before they be sensible of any danger, or
discovery of their damnable state. Great men they are with the men of this
world, with all those wise fools and sensual great ones, who are not willing
to be tormented before their time, or rather who desire impossibly to live the
life of pleasures in the mean time, and yet at last to die the death of the
righteous. They have still ready at hand, hand over head, mercy, and pardon.
Heaven and salvation for all comers, and all they come near, without so much

affect and applaud, tho to their own everlasting undoing. They swell under
such Teachers with a Pharisaicall conceit, that they are as safe for
salvation, as the precisest of them all; but alas! their hope is but like a
hollow wall, which being put to any stresse, when the tempest of Gods
searching wrath begins to shake it, in the time of a final trial of it is
truth, and soundness; it shatters into pieces and comes to naught. Hear the
Prophet: Isai. 30.8. etc.
Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may

lying children, children that will not hear the Law of the Lord: which say to

and to the Prophets, prophecy not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth
things, prophecy deceits. Get you out of the way: turn aside out of the path:
cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. Wherefore, thus says the
Holy One of Israel: Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression, and
perverseness, and stay thereon: Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a
breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes
suddenly at an instant. And He shall break it as the breaking of the potters
vessel, that is broken in pieces, he shall not spare; so that there shall not
be found in the bursting of it, a sheard to take fire from the harth, or to

mudde-wall without straw, or mortar made only of sand without lime to bind
it; which in fair weather makes a fair show for a while; but when abundance
of rain falls, and winter comes, it moulders away, and turns to mire in the
streets. Their vain confidence in prosperous times, before it come to the
Touchstone of the fiery trial by Gods searching Truth, may seem current; But
in the tempest of Gods wrath when the stormy winters night of death
approaches, or at furthest, at the judgment Seat of the just and Highest
God, it prooves to be counterfeite: Matthew 7.22. and 25.11.
when at last they shall cry Lord Lord like the foolish Virgins, And those Mat.
7. in stead of imaginary comfort, they shall be crushed with horrible and
everlasting confusion. Ezech. 13.11. etc.
Hear the Prophet: Say unto them which daube it with untempered mortar, that
it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower, and ye, O great hail
stones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall rent it. Lo, when the wall is
fallen, shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have
daubed it? Therefore thus says the Lord God, I will rent it with a stormy wind
in my fury: and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great
hailestones in my fury to consume it. So will I break down the wall that ye
have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that
the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall
be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus
will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have it dawbed
with untempered mortar, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither
they that daubed it: To wit, the Prophets of Israel, which prophecy concerning
Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for Her, and there is no peace, says
the Lord God: Such as with lies make the heart of the righteous sad, whom God
has not made sad; and strengthen the hands of the wicked, that He should not
return from His wicked way by promising Him life. Ezech. 13.22. These fellows
hold and bear mere civil men in hand, that their estate is sound enough to
Godward, whatsoever the purer and preciser Brethren prate to the contrary: Sunt
etiam apud nos qui been alioqui, and ciuiliter vivunt, qui tamen nullo
desiderio verbi tenentur: istos homines nunquam ego sanctificatos di^^rim,
neque eorum virtutes esse existimarim, sed virtutum umbras duntaxat, and
simulachra, cum sine sanctisicatione and participatione divinae naturae, nulla
possit esse vera virtus. Rolloc. In Ioh. cap. 8. Time has been, perhaps, when
we have thought civil honesty to be regeneration: God forgive us: It must be
more then civilitie that brings to Heaven; more then formalitie that makes a
Christian, etc. Dr. Sclater, Sick Souls Salve, page 21.
and yet the holy Ghost tells us, that without holiness no man shall see the
Lord. Hebr. 12.14. That formal Professors are very forward men; whereas Jesus
Christ professes, that He will spew the lukewarm out of His mouth. Nay, and
if there be talk even of a good fellow especially of some more commendable
natural parts, and plausible carriage; if He be so but moderately, that I may
so speak, and not just every day drunk; well, well, will they say, we have
all our faults, and that is His. But as concerning the faithful servant of
God; they are wont to entertain the same conceit of Him, which Ahab did of
Elijah to wit, that 1. King. 18.17.
He was a troubler of Israel: Which one of the captains had of the Prophet
sent to anoint Iehu, that He was a 1. King. 9.11.

Austin describes some of these Selfe-seeking, and Soule-murthering Dawbers in
His Days; Far be it from us, says He, that we should say unto you: live as
you list, do not trouble your selves, God will cast away none; only hold the
Christian Faith: He will not destroy that which He has redeemed, He will not
destroy those for whom He has shed His blood; And if you please, to recreate
your selves at Plays, you may go; what hurt is there in it? And you may go to
those Feasts, which are kept in all Towns, by joviall companions, making
themselves merry as they suppose at these public meetings and comessations,
but indeed rather making themselves most miserable, I say you may go, and be
jovial, Gods mercy is great, and may pardon all. Crown your selves with Roses
before they wither. -- You may fill your selves with good cheer and wine,
amongst your good fellow companions: For the creature is given unto us for that
purpose that we may enjoy it. -- If we say these things, peradventure we
shall h^ve greater multitudes applaude and adhere unto our Doctrine. And if
there be some, which think, that speaking these things, we are not well
advisde, we offend but a few, and those precise Ones, But we winn^ thereby a
world of people. But if we shall thus do speaking not the words of God, not
the words of Christ, but our own; we shall be Pastors feeding our Selves, not
our flock.

Bane of this Kingdom: To wit, A light, affected and unprofitable kind of
preaching, which has been of late years taken up in Court, University, City
and Country. Hear something more largely what reason led His royal judgment
to this resolution; and desire of reformation:

The reasons of the Kings Directions for Preaching and Preachers, as I received
them from the Hand of a public Register.
His Majesty being much troubled and grieved at the heart to hear every day
of so many defections from our religion Both to Popery, and Anabaptisme, or
other Points of separation in some parts of this Kingdom; And considering with
much admiration, what might be the cause thereof, especially in the Reign of
such a King, who does so constantly profess Himself an open adversary to the
superstition of the One and madness of the other; His Princely wisdom could
fall upon no One greater probability, then the lightness, affectednesse, and
unprofitableness of that kind of preaching, which has been of late years too
much taken up in Court, University, City, and Country. The usual scope of
very many Preachers is noted, to be a soaring up in Points of Divinity too
deep for the capacity of the people; or a mustring up of much reading; or a
displaying of their own wits, etc. Now the people bred up with this kind of
teaching, and never instructed in the catechism, and fundamental grounds of
religion, are for all this aerie nourishment no better then abrasae Tabulae,
mere Table Books ready to be filled up, either with the Manualls, and
Catechismes of the Popish Priests or the Papers and Pamphlets of Anabaptists,
etc.

In another place, he resembles with admirable fitness the unprofitable
pomp, and painting of such Selfe-seeking discourses, patched together and
stuffed with a vaineglorious variety of humane allegations, to the red and blew
flowers, that pester the corn, when it stands in the fields; where they are
more noisome to the growing crop, then beautiful to the beholding eye. They
are King James his own In the Preface to his Rem^nstrance against an Oration
of the Cardinal of Perron.

decorum to enter the Stage with a Pericles, in his mouth, but with the sacred

Poet, after the example of an heathen Orator:

These things being So; how pestilent is the Art of Spiritual Dawbing? What
miserable men are Menpleasers, who being appointed to help men's Souls out of
hell, carry them headlong, and hoodwinkt by their unfaithfulness and
flatteries toward everlasting miseries? Oh, how much better were it, and
comfortable for every man that enters upon, and undertakes that most weighty
and dreadful charge of the ministry, a On^^, vel Angelorum humeris

Paul; by using no flattering words nor a cloak of covetousness, nor seeking
glory of men; but preaching in season, and out of season; not as the Scribes,
but in the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power; Keeping nothing back
that is profitable, declaring unto their hearers all the counsel of God;
holding the Spiritual children which God has given them, their glory, joy,
and crown of rejoicing* still watching for the Souls of their flocks as they
that must give account. Heb. 13.17. (The terror of which place, Parete us qui

I take you to record this Day that I am pure from the blood of all men! Let us
be moved to this course and frighted from the contrary; by consideration of
the different effects and consequents of plain dealing, and dawbing, in
respect of comfort or confusion: Faithfulness this way:

1. Begets those which belong unto God to grace and new obedience: See Peter's
piercing Sermon; Act. 2.23.37.

2. Recovers those Christians, which are fallen, by remorse and repentance, to
their former forwardness, and first love; See Nathans downright dealing with
David* 2. Sam. 12.7.13.

3. Makes those which will not be reformed, inexcusable. See Paul's Sermon to
Foelix: Act 24.26. How strangely will this fellow be confounded, and more then
utterly without all excuse, when he shall meet Paul at that great Day, before
the highest Judge?

4. It is right pleasing and profitable to upright hearted men, and all such as
happily hold on in a constant and comfortable course of Christianity. Do not
my words do good to him that walks uprightly? Micah: 2.7. It makes them still
more humble, zealous, watchful, heavenly minded, etc.

5. Hardens the rebellious and contumacious. See Pronunciat sore, ut populus

reign and rejoice with Him in unknown and unspeakable Bliste through all
eternity.

But now on the otherside the Effects of Dawbing and men-pleasing are most
accursed and pestilent; in many respects.

1. In respect of Gods word and messages: first, not dividing it and dispensing
them aright. Secondly, Dishonouring the Majesty, and weakening the power of
them many times, with the unprofitable mixture of humane allegations,
ostentations of wit, fine frier-like conceits dug with much ado out of
Popish postills, etc. Even as we may see at harvest time a land of good corn
quite choked up with red, blew and yellow flowers. As King James does
excellently allude in the forecited In the Preface of his Remonstra^ce against
Cardinal Perron.
place. Thirdly, Fearful profaning them by mis-application against Gods
will: Ezech. 13.22.
Making the heart of the righteous Sad, whom God would not have made Sad; and
strengthening the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his
wicked way, by promising him life. Fourthly, Villainous perverting and abusing
them to their own advantage, applause, rising, revenge, and such other private
ends:

2. In respect of the flattering, and unfaithful Ministers themselves. First,
Extreme vileness, Isa. 9.15. Secondly, Sanguinem ejus Do^inus de manu

3. In respect of their hearers, who delight in their lies, in their smooth and
silken sermons; Sudden, horrible, and unavoidable confusion. Isa. 30.13.14.

Burning both together in hell for ever, without timely and true repentance;
banning there each other continually, and crying with mutual hideous yellings:
O thou bloody Butcher of our Souls, had thou bin faithful in thy Ministry,
we had escaped these eternal flames! O miserable man that I am; Woe is me,
that ever I was Minister; for now besides the horror due unto the guiltiness
of mine own damned Soul, I have drawn upon me, by my unfaithful dealing,
the cry of the blood of all those souls, who have perished under my Ministry,
to the everlasting enraging of my already intolerable torment!

Give me leave to conclude this point, with that patheticall, and zealous
passage of reverend and learned Greenham against negligent pastors, amongst
whom I may justly rank and reckon also all Dawbers (for as well never a whit,
as never the better) and Men-pleasers; For self preachers are, for the most
part, ^or the painefulnes of that unprofitable way of preaching, wherein there
is ordinarily so much affectation on the one side, and expectation on the
other, of such a deal of curiosity, variety of extraordinary conceits, tricks
of wit, ostentation of reading, etc. that it puts the Penman to a great deal
of pains, and tortures his wit extremely: Then, afterward, the irksome
tediousness of committing it so punctually and precisely to memory; The
fearfulness in delivery, and danger of being out; Vainglorious, doubting
that they shall not be app^^^ded, as they were wont: Fear, lest the next time
should less^n their former reputation of wit, reading, etc. I say, such
considerations as these, are many times notable (...), to keep them from

His words:

Were there any love of God from their hearts in those, who in stead of feeding

reckoning to thee, who in most strict account will take the answer of every
Soul committed unto them* one by one? Or with what ears do they often hear
that vehem^nt speech of our Savior Christ, Feed, Feed, Feed? with what eyes
do they so often read^ that piercing speech of the Apostle, Feed the slocke
committed unto you? But if none of these will move them then the Lord open
their eyes to hear the grievous groans of many Souls lying under the griefly
altars of destruction, and complaining against them; O Lord the revenger of
blood, behold these men, whom thou have set over us to give us the bread of
life; but they have not given it us: Our tongues, and the tongues of our
children have stuck to the roof of our mouths for calling and crying, and
they would not take pity on us: We have given them the tenths which thou
appointedst us, but they have not given us thy truth; which thou have commanded
them: Reward them. O Lord, as they have rewarded us; Let the bread between
their teeth turn to rottenness in their bowels. Let them be clothed with
shame, and confusion of face, as with a garment: Let their wealth as the Dung
from the earth, be swept away by their executours; And upon their gold and
silver, which they have falsely treasured up, let continually be written, the
price of blood, the price of blood: For it is the value of our blood, O Lord.
If thou did hear the blood of Abel, being but one man, forget not the blood
of many, when thou go into judgment.

I now return to rectify and tender a remedy against the first aberration.
Which I told you was this: When mercy, Christ, the promises, salvation, heaven
and all are applied hand overhead and falsely appropriated to vnhumbled
sinners: whose Souls were never rightly illightened with sight of sin, and
weight of Gods wrath; nor afflicted to any purpose with any legal wound, or
hearty compunction by the Spirit of bondage: In whose hearts, Fo sumus omnes
ingenio, ut nunqua^ velimus quaerere Christum, nisi impulsi sensu aliquo
miseriae, ac indigentiae nostrae. Qui valent, non egent medico, sed male
affecti, inquit Christus; Venite ad me omnes, qui fatigati and onerati estis,
and ego faciam ut requiescatis. Quotquot igitur Christum praedicant, Christi
exemplo hoc discant, nempo, quo tempore alliciunt homines ad fidem, proposita
illa suavitate, quae est in Christo, codem tempore extimulandos esse ipsos
peccati ac miseriae suae sensu ad Christum amplectendum: Nam hae duae parts
doctrinae semper conjungendae sunt, Doctrina miseriae, and Doctrina
misericordiae in Christo Jesus. Rolloc. in Joan. c. 4.
sense of their spiritual misery, and want, has not yet raised a restless
and kindly thirst after Jesus Christ?

In this case mine advise is; that all those who deal with others about their
Spiritual states, and undertake to direct in that high and weighty affair of
men's Salvation, either publikly or privately in their ministry, visitations of
the sick, or otherwise; that they would follow that course of which I largely
discoursed a little before taken by God himself, his Prophets, his Son, the
Apostles, and all those men of Let none speak against the preaching of the Law,
for it is the wholesome way that God Himself, and His Servants in all Ages
have taken. He did reprove, convince, and curse Adam and Eve, and after He
preached, the Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents head. -- So John
Baptist dealt with His hearers. And our Savior Christ says, He came to
seek, and to save the lost. Peter, Act. 2.37. first preached the Law, and
after the Gospel. So Paul and Silas, Act. 16. The contrary, is the way to make
people curse us hereafter, tho it please them for the present; As if one should
heal a sore on the top, and not corrasive it, to draw and eat out the core,
it would within a while break out again, with far greater danger: So shall
we find it in this case. Rogers of Dedham in His Doctrine of Faith, page 97.98.
God in all ages, who have set themselves, with Sincerity, faithfulness, and
all good Conscience, to seek Gods glory in the salvation of men's Souls; to
discharge aright their dreadful charge, and to keep themselves pure from the
blood of all men; To wit, That they labor might and maine, in the first Place,
by the knowledge, power, and application of the Law, The Law first humbles,
then the Gospel comforts. The Law has three works: First, it inlighteneth a
miserable sinner, in whom God has a meaning to work Faith, with a clear, and
particular sight of His misery, and woeful estate He stands in by sin.
Secondly, it does also by the working of the Spirit, convince the Party, that
that is particularly true of Him, which before He used to post over His head,
as pertaining to others, not to Him: But now God makes Him take this to
Himself, and to apply and appropriate it, as if the Minister spoke to Him
alone by Name; and to think the Minister knows all His heart, looks on Him,
and speaks directly to Him; Though it may be the Minister knew Him nor, or
not His case, but God makes Him so to think. Thirdly, upon these two, it
raises terror, and puts this sinner out of His old, secure, and peaceable
course of impenitency, that He went on in. Whether it be the profane that
went on boldly in His sin; or the civil man trusting in His own
righteousness. -- And makes Him as one shot into flesh with a cross, or
bearded arrow, which He cannot shake out, nor abide the smart, but stampes as
one s^^^ng with an Add^r, (...) cannot stand His ground, but is wholly
possessed with fear^ Ibid page 68. etc.
to illighten, convince, and terrify those that they have to do with,
concerning conversion, with a sensible particular apprehension, and
acknowledgement of their wretchedness, and miserable estate, by reason of
their sinfulness and cursednesse: To break their hearts, bruise their
Spirits, humble their Souls, wound and awake their Consciences, etc. To bring
them by all means to that Legal astonishment, trouble of mind, and melting
temper, which the Ministry of John Baptist, Paul and Peter wrought upon the
Hearts of their hearers. Luke 3.10.12.14. Act. 16.30. And 2.37. That they may
come crying feelingly and from the heart, to those Men of God who happily
fastened those keen arrows of compunction and remorse in the sides of their
Consciences and say; Men and Brethren, what shall we do? Sirs, what must we
do to be saved? etc. As if they should have said: Alas! we see now, we have
bin in Hell all this while; and if we had gone on a little longer, we had most
certainly lien for ever in the fiery Lake; The Devil and our own lusts were
carrying us hood-winkt, and headlong toward endless perdition. Who would have
thought we had bin such abominable beasts, and abhorred Creatures as your
Ministry has made us; and in so forlorn and woeful estate? Now you blessed
Men of God, help us out of this gulf of spiritual confusion, or we are lost
everlastingly. By your discovery of our present sinful and cursed estate, we

pieces with extreme, and restles anguish, as tho many fiery Scorpions stings
stuck fast in them; Either lead us to the sight of that blessed Antitype of
the Brazen Serpent to cool and allay the boiling rage of our guilty wounds, or
we are utterly undone: Either bring us to the Blood of that just and holy One,
which with execrable villainy we have spilt as water upon the ground, that it
may bind up our broken hearts, or they will presently burst with despair, and
bleed to eternal death. Give us to drink of that sovereign Fountain, Isai.

meant sin, and by selling it, the renouncing and disclaiming of sin. -- Now
to sell this, is (as the nature of selling we know requires) to part with the
right, and title, and interest, that a Man has unto it* the secret and inward
love to it, and the outward and common practice of it. He that would enjoy this
heavenly treasure, which the Lord does so freely and graciously tender unto us,
by the preaching of the Gospel, must resolve to make a through sale, and to
forsake not some, but every sin, every corruption, every breach of the will
of God, whatsoever. Hieron. in his third Sermon upon Matthew. 13 44. What must
the sinner sell? All that He has. What is that? His Goods, Lands, Children?
No, These be none of His own, God has but lent him these to use; and some
that would have Christ, and shall, have no goods to sell: What then is our
own? Our sins and nothing else. He that will have part in Christ, must part
with his sins; He cannot have Christ, and keep any One of them. Rogers in
his Doctrine of Faith. p. 171. etc. Qui volit pro dignitate sua astimare donum

sell all, even all our Sins to the last ^ilthy ragge of our heretofore doted
upon minion delight, So that we may enjoy our blessed Jesus, whom, you have
told us, and we now believe, God has made both Lord and Christ: etc.

Now when we shall see, and find in some measure the hearts of our Hearers,
and spiritual Patients thus prepared; both by legal dejections and terrors
from the spirit of bondage; Though a Man dares not apply the promise to One,
only terrified by the Law, yet to One truly thus humbled by the Gospel, and
contrite hearted, we do no other. Rogers, Ibid page 141.
and also possessed with such melting and eager affections, wrought by the
light of the Gospel, and Offer of Christ: When their Souls once begin to
feel all sins, even their best beloved One, heavy and burdensome; to prize
Jesus Christ far before all the world, to thirst for Him infinitely more, then
for riches, pleasures, honors, or any earthly thing; to resolve to take him as
their husband, and to Heb. 5.9.
obey Him as their Lord for ever, etc; and all this in truth: I say then, and
in this case, we may have comfort to minister comfort. Then, upon good ground
we may go about our Masters command. Isa. 40.1. (which man-pleasers many
times pitifully abuse) Comfort ye, Comfort ye my people; ( H^c ad exilium

against their lothnesse to believe, and holding off in this case to take his

But now in the mean time, until sense of Spiritual misery and poverty raise
an hunger and thirst after Jesus Christ; before such like preparations, and
precedent affections, as have been spoke of, be wrought in the hearts of men,
by pressing the Law, and proclaiming the Gospel; and that in Sincerity; (for
the degree and measure, we leave it to God, as a most free Agent, in some they
may be stronger, in some weaker) the preaching or promising of mercy, as
already belonging unto them is far more unseasonable, and unseemely, then
Snow in Summer, rain in harvest, or honor for a fool. It is upon the matter,
the very Sealing them up with the Spirit of delusion, that they may never so
much as think of taking the right course to be converted. What sottish and
sacrilegious audaciousnesse then is it in any Dawber to thrust his profane
hand into the treasury of Gods mercy, and there hand over head, without any
allowance from his highest Lord to scatter His dearest, and most orient pearls
amongst Swine? To warrant salvaon to any unhumbled Sinner? To strengthen the
hands of the wicked, who never yet took sin to heart to any purpose, and
thirst far more (such true Gadarens are they) after gold, satisfying their
own lusts, and perking above their brethren, then for the blood of Christ, by
promising them life? To assure mere civil men, and Pharisees who are so far
from the sense of any spiritual poverty, that they are already swollen as full
as the skin will hold, with a self-conceit of their own rotten
righteousness, that they shall be saved as well as the most puling precisian?
Especially, since there is such a cloud of witnesses to the contrary, as you
have heard before. Besides all which, upon this occasion, take two or three
more. Hear a most faithful and fruitful workman in the Lords harvest, of
great skill, experience and success in the most glorious Art of converting
Souls, which makes me more willing to urge his authority, and esteem His
judgment in Points of this nature. None, Rogers of Dedham in his Doctrine of
Faith, page 63.
says he, can prove or show president, that faith was wrought in an instant
at first, without any preparation going before: Nor can it be conceived how a
man should believe in Christ for salvation, that felt not himself before in a
miserable estate, and wearied with it, and desired to get out of it into a
better. As the needle goes before to pierce the cloth and makes way for the
thread to sew it: So is it in this case. Afterward He tells us how and in what
manner and order, these predispositions, and preparative Acts, required for the
plantation of faith, and so securing us of the right season, and a comfortable
calling to assure men of Spiritual safety, are wrought in such, as God is
drawing unto Jesus Christ. He requires from the law, First, Illumination:
Secondly, Conviction: Thirdly, Legal terror. From the Gospel by the help of
the Spirit; First, Revealing the remedy: Secondly, Belief of it in general:
Thirdly, Support in the mean time from sinking under the burden, and falling
into despair. Fourthly, He makes contrition to fo^low Legal terror, and
precede that repentance which is the Daughter of Faith, and in order of nature
follows after it. See ibid. page 121.122 123.124.

See also Master Hookers Preface to His Book, added in the second Edition.


Contrition; Which is attended, with some kind of, First, Desire. Secondly,
request. Thirdly, Care. Fourthly, If any be troubled, because he talks of
hope, joy, etc. before Faith, let Him seek satisfaction. Ibid page 161.162.
and weigh well His distinction of the Gifts of God, page 125.126. where He
tells us of three kinds of them:

First, some common to El^ct, and Reprobate; as knowledge in Scripture,
Prophecy, Tongues, Miracles, and such like.

Secondly, some special belonging to the Elect only, as Faith, by which we
are justified, a renewed heart, a good conscience, the fear of God, and such
like graces.

Thirdly, some middle ones, wrought in the heart of those, that be not yet
actually the children of God; yet certainly shall be; And which whosoever
have wrought in them, shall surely have Faith, and cannot go long without it;
Such is this contrition, and such dispositions as be in men before Faith,
which yet are wrought by the Gospel. These are better then common Gifts, yet
not actual Graces, and yet gracious inclinations to Faith, which are in those
that are to be justified; and which (if we speak properly) cannot be
wrought in any that shall perish. See Master Hooker in the Preface to the same
Book.


Hope. Fifthly, Joy. Sixthly, Hungring and thirsting after mercy and after
Christ. Seventhly, Resolution to sell all, to wit, all sins, not to leave an
hoof behind, etc. And thus (says he) God brings along the man, that He
purposes to make His. And when he is at this pass, God seals it up to him,
and inables him to believe; And says: Since thou will have no Nay; Be it unto
thee according to thy desire: And God seals him up by the Spirit of promise,
as surely as any writing is made sure by sealing of it. Then he believes the
word of God, and rests, and casts himself upon it. And thus he finds himself
discharged of all woe, made partaker of all good, at peace in himself, and
fitted, and in tune to do God some service. This is to some sooner, to some
later; according to the helps and means they have, and wise handling they
meet withal, and as God gives power. -- It is hard to say, at what instant
faith is wrought, whether not till a man feels that he apprehends the
promises, or even in his earnest desires, hungring and thirsting; For even
these are pronounced blessed.

But here (for I desire and endeavor as much as I can possibly, in every
passage to prevent all matter, both of scruple in the upright hearted, and of
cavil in the contrary minded) let no truly humbled sinner be discouraged,
because He cannot find in himself these several workings, or other graces,
in that degree and height, which He desires and has perhaps, seen, heard, or
read of in some others: If he have them in As a great Divine says of Faith:
Non ex gradu, aut mensur^ fidei dependet justificatio, sed ex ver^^a^e:
Justification depends not upon the degree, but the truth of Faith. Davenantius
in Expos. epist. ad Coloss. page 21. So may we say proportionably of other
graces, in respect of comfort from them; and yet that of Austin is most true;
Si dixisti, sufficit, perijsti: If any say, he has grace enough, he has
just none.

Minime certe bonus est, qui melior esse non vult. Bernard.


truth, and truly thirsts and labors for their increase, he may go on with
comfort. Neither let any be disheartened, though He did not observe so
distinctly the order of the precedent acts, nor could discern so punctually
their several operations in His Soul: yet if in substance and effect they
have been wrought in Him, and made way for Jesus Christ, He needs not
complain.

As this man of God in experimental divinity, so our renowned and invincible

Champions in their Polemicall discourses upon other occasion, speak to the
same purpose, telling us also of some antecedent Acts humbling and preparing
the soul for conversion. There are say they; certain internal effects going
before conversion or regeneration, which by virtue of the word and Spirit, are
wrought in the hearts of those which are not yet justified: Such as:
Illumination of the mind and conscience with the knowledge of the word and will
of God, for that purpose, Sense of sin, fear of punishment or legal terror;
advising and casting about for enlargement from such a miserable estate, some
hope of pardon: etc. Let me but add one other, and He also of excellent
learning; And then I have done; Such is the nature of man, Says Yates in his
Model of Divinity, lib. 2. ca. 26
he; that before he can receive a true justifying faith, he must as it were
be broken in pieces by the law: Ier. 23.29. -- We are to be led from the
fear of slaves, through the fear of Penitents, to the fear of sons: And
indeed, one of these makes way for another, and the perfect love thrusts out
fear; yet must fear bring in that perfect love, as a needle or Bristle draws
in the thread after it; or as the potion brings health. In the preparation and
fitting us for our being in Christ, he requires two things: First, The
cutting of us off as it were from the wild Olive Tree. By which he means two
things. First, A violent pulling of us out of the corruption of nature, or a
cutting, as it were by the knife of the law, of an unregenerate man from His
security, etc. Secondly, A violent atraction to Christ for ease; man at the
first plainly refusing it. The hunted beast flies to his den, the pursued
malefactor to the horns of the altar, or city of refuge. Paul's misery Romans
7.24. Drives him to Gods mercy. The Israelites are driven into their chambers
by the destroying Angel; Balaam is made to lean back by the naked Sword;
Agur to run to Ihiel and Veall, that is Christ: Pro. 30.1.2.3; When he is
confounded with his own brutishness. God must let loose his Law, Sin,
Conscience, and Satan to bait us, and kindle hell fire in our Souls, before
we will be driven to seek to Christ. Secondly. A paring and trimming of us,
for our putting into Christ by our humiliation for sin, which is thus wrought:
God gives the sinner to see, by the law, his Sin, and the punishment of it:
The detection whereof drives Him to compunction, and a pricking of heart, which
is greater, or lesser, and carries with it diverse Symptoms, and sensible
passions of grief. -- And works a Sequestration from his former courses, and
makes Him loath Himself, etc.

And yet by the way, and once for all, take this Caveat, and forewarning: If
any should think of these precedent Acts, Neither let any dream, that these
are any Productions of free will; I heartily abhor Popery, Pelagianisme, and
all enemies to the Grace of God: But know, that they are the Effects of the
Word and Spirit.

these preparative workings of the Law, and Gospel, which make way for the
infusion of faith, as any meritorious means to draw on Christ; it were a most
false, rotten, foolish, execrable, popish, absurd, Luciferian misconceit; and
might justly merit never to obtain mercy at Gods bountiful hands, nor part in
the merits of Christ: I speak thus to fright every one for ever, from any such
abhorred thought. God the father offers His Son most freely. God so loved the
world, that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him
should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ioh. 3.16. Unto us a child is
borne, unto us a Son is given. Isa. 9.6. If thou knew the gift of God,
says Christ unto the woman of Samaria, and who it is, that says to Thee, Give
me to drink. Ioh. 4.10. Much more they, which receive abundance of grace, and
of the Gift of righteousness, etc. Romans 5.17. Christ calls Himself, a Gift;
And it is called, the Gift of righteousness. And nothing so free as Quod nam
sit hoc donum ipse exponit verbis sequentibus, and quis sit qui dicit tibi:
Donum igitur est ipse Christus silius, quem dedit nobis Pater. Rolloc. in
Johan. page 196.
Gift. And therefore those Divines speak not unfitly, who say, It is given
unto us, as fathers give Lands and Inheritance to their children; as kings
grant pardons, to their subjects, having merited death: They give them, because
they will, out of the freeness of their minds. All those who would come unto
Christ and desire to take him as their wisdom, righteousness,
Sanctification, and redemption, must be utterly unbottomed of themselves, and
built only on the rich and free mercy of God revealed in the Gospel. They
must be emptied, First, Of all conceit of any righteousness or worth in
themselves at all: Secondly, Of all hope of any ability or possibility to help
themselves. Nay filled, thirdly, with sense of their own unworthiness,
naughtiness, nothingnesse: Fourthly, and with such a thirst after that water
of life, Ioh. 4.14. that they are most willing to sell all for it, and cry
heartily, Give me drink, or else I die. And then when they are thus most
nothing in themselves, do so long for the rivers of living water, they are
certainly most welcome unto Jesus Christ; and may take Him most freely; Hear
how sweetly He calls them; Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the
waters; and he that has no money, Come ye, buy, and eat; yea come, buy wine
and milk, without money, and without price. Isa. 55.1. In the last day, that
great day of the feast, Jesus stood, and cried saying; If any man thirst let
him come unto me, and drink, He that believes on me, as the Scripture has
said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water; Ioh. 7.37.38. It is
done; I am Alpha, and Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give unto him,
that is a thirst, of the Fountain of the water of life freely. Revelat. Chap.
21. Verse. 6. And let him that is a thirst come, and whosoever will let him take
the water of life freely, Romans 22.17. We must therefore by no means conceive
of the forenamed preparatiue humiliations and precedent works of the Law and
Gospel, as of any meritorious qualifications to draw on Christ (for he is
given most freely) but as of needful predispositions, to drive us unto Christ.
For a Man must feel Himself in misery, before He will go about to find a
remedy; be sick before He will seek the Physician; be in Prison before He
will sue for a pardon; be wounded before He will prize a Plaster, and
precious balsam. A sinner must be weary of His former wicked ways, and tired
with legal terror, before He will have recourse to Jesus Christ for
refreshing, and lay down His bleeding Soul in his blessed Bosom; He must
be sensible of His Spiritual poverty, beggary, and slavery under the Devil,
before He thirst kindly for heavenly righteousness, and willingly take up
Christ's sweet and easy yoke. He must be cast down, confounded, condemned, a
cast away, and lost in Himself, before He will look about for a Savior; He
must cry heartily; I am unclean, I am unclean; before He will long, and
labor to wash in that most sovereign, and Soule-saving Fountain, Zach. 13.1.
opened to the house of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin, and
for uncleanness; he must sell all, before he will be willing and eager to buy
the Treasure hid in the field.

Now thus to prepare, wound, afflict, and humble the Soul, that it may be
fitted for Jesus Christ, and so for comfort upon good ground, let ministers, or
whosoever meddle in matters of this nature, publickely or privately, use all
warrantable means, Vidisti ulcus? vidisti morbum insanabilem non unius, non
duorum, non december, sed mill? Quidergo dicit posthaec, Lavamini, mundi estote?
Number peccatum putas habet? Ipse Deus dicit, non audiam vos: and dicit, Lavamini;
Quorum vtrumque utiliter ingeritur, id, ut terream, hoc, ut alliciam; sed cos
non audis, spem poenitentiae non habent. Quod si non habent poenitentiae spem,
quomodo dicit, Lavamini? etc. Chrysostom. tom 5. de Poenitentia, Homil. 3.
fair, and foul, as they say, let them press the law, promise mercy, propose
Christ, etc. Do what they will seasonably and wisely; Let them improve all
their learning, wisdom, discretion, mercifullnesse, experience, wit,
eloquence, Sanctified unto them for that purpose; So that the work be done.

Besides many other large Commentaries, and Expositions, Downam, and Whately
are excellent for a more punctual, clear, and compendious Opening of the Law,
and ranking in order, and distinct representing of the several sins against
it. Make use of the twenty considerations before, page 63. etc. and of the
three ways of examining the Conscience in my Treatise of the Lords Supper, to
help to make a Man Miserable and vile in His own eyes; sensible of His
sinful, and cursed state, that thereupon He may be stirred to go out of
Himself, and make toward Christ.
In pressing the law, besides other dexterities and directions for managing
their ministry in this Point succesfully by Gods Blessing, let them take notice
of this Particular, which may prove very availeable to begin this Legal work;
It is a Principle, attended upon with many a Probatum est:

Pressing upon Men's consciences with a zealous, discreet powerfullnesse, their
special, principal, fresh-bleeding Sins, is a notable means to break their
hearts, and bring them to remorse. That most heinous and bloody sin of
killing Jesus Christ, in which they had newly imbrued their hands, pressed upon
the Consciences of Peter's hearers, breaks and tears their hearts in pieces.
Act. 2.23.36.37. So Adultery, secretly, intimated by Christ's words, unto the
woman of Samaria, Ioh. 4.18. Seems to have struck her to the heart, verse. 19.
So the Jews having Idolatry pressed upon their consciences by Samuel, 1. Sam.
7.6. The sin of asking a king; ibid. 12.19. Usury by Nehemiah, 5.12. Strange
wives by Ezra, cap. 10.9. were thereupon mightily moved, and much mollified in
their hearts, as appears in the cited Places. Consider for this purpose, that
work upon David's heart, by Nathans Ministry, And Felix trembling, when Paul
struck Him on the right vein.

The reasons, why this more particular discovery, and denouncing of judgment
against a Man's principal sin, is like, God assisting with the Spirit of
bondage, to put such life into the work of the Law, are such as these.

1. The Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, being welded by the hand
of the holy Ghost; and edged as it were, with the special power of Gods
blessing, for the cutting asunder of the iron-Sinewes of a stubborn and stony
heart, does crush and conquer, strike through and break in pieces, with an
unresistable puissance, proportioned to the insolency, or easiness of
resistance. My meaning is this; As Philosophers say of the Lightning; that by
reason of the easiness of the passage, weakness of resistance, porosity of
the parts, it pierces through the Purse, Scabberd, and Bark without any such
scorching and visible hurt; but melts the money, the sword, rents and shivers
the tree, because their substance and solidity, does more exercise, and improve
its activenes and ability: So this Spiritual Sword, tho it strike at every
sin, and passes through, even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit,
and of the joints, and marrow; yet the hairy pate of the maine corruption, and
Master sin, it wounds with a witness; it there tortures and tears in pieces
with extraordinary anguish and smart, Searching and sense: for that opposes
with the most flinty iron-Sinew, to blunt and rebate its edge, if it were
possible.

2. In Consciences regularly, and rightly wounded, and awaked, sins are wont
to bite, and sting proportionably to their heinousness, and the exorbitancy of
their former sensual impressions. Some like a Mastife, some like a Scorpion,
some like a Wolf in the Evening: (But understand, that spiritual anguish
surpasses immeasurably any corporal pain; therefore conceive of them with a
vast dis-proportion) Now the Minion delight or Captain sin frighting the
heart with greatest horror, and stinging with extremity proportionable to its
former vastation of Conscience, does by an accidental power, (God blessing the
business) give a great stroke, to drive a man to deepest detestation of
Himself, to throw Him down to the lowest step of penitent dejection, to
eneager His thirsty greediness after pardon and grace, and at length to fire
Him out of His natural estate.

3. A Man's principal, and most prevailing sin is Satan's strongest Hold.
When He is in danger to be dislodged, and driven by the power of the word out
of the other parts of the Soul, as it were, and from Possession of a Man by
all other sins; He retires Hither as to His Castle, and most impregnable
Fort. And therefore if this be soundly beaten upon by the Hammer, and Horror
of the Law, and battered about His ears, he will be quickly enforced to quit
the Place quite.

It may be good counsel then, and often seasonable to say unto those Men of
God, who desire to drive the Devil out of Others, in some sort, as the King of
Syria said to his Captains, Fight neither with small nor great, save only
with the King of Israel. My meaning is; Let them address the sharpest edge of
their spiritual Sword, yet as well with an holy charitable discretion, as with
resolute, downeright dealing against those sins, which bear greatest sway in
them, they have to deal with. Be it their covetousness, ambition, Lust,
drunkenness, Lukewarmenesse, monstrousness of the fashion, sacrilege,
oppression, usury, Backsliding, murder, luxury, Opposition to the good way,
Hatred of the Saints, or what other sin soever they discover in them, to
minister greatest advantage to Satan, to keep them fastest in his clutches. No
sin must be spared, but let the reigning sin be paid home especially.

For opening of the most rich and Orient Mines of all those sweetest mercies
folded up within the Bowels of Gods dearest compassions, (...). Colos. 1.13.
and of the Mystery of his free grace and love through the Son of his lous;
upon purpose to invite, and allure those that are without, to come in, and to
stir up our Hearers, The wisdom of the blessed Spirit Himself teaches us
to make use of Gods mercies, to preach mercy for this purpose. See Isai.
55.7.8.9 ^oel 2.13.

Rebels will far more willingly come in upon Pro^lamation promising mercy,
and assuring them of pardon, if they will humble themselves, and return to
obedience; If there be no hope of being received to grace, there will be no
desire to return into the state of grace.

^a est conscientia peccati and irae Dei adversus peccatum, ut nisi allecti
suavi aliquo misericordiae de^^n Christo sensa, nunquam velimus credere in cum,
aut ad cum consugere. Roll^c. in Johan cap. 5. verse. 20 page 270.


to bring broken hearts, bruised Spirits, bleeding Souls unto the Throne of
grace, upon the same ground, but infinitely more gracious, that encouraged the
Servants of Benhadad, to address themselves toward the King of Israel; 1.
Kings 20.31.
And his Servants said unto Him; Behold now, we have heard that the Kings of
the House of Israel, are merciful Kings; Let us, I pray thee, put Sackecloth
upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the King of Israel,
peradventure, he will save thy life. The most desperate Rebels heretofore,
upon present true remorse for their former rage in sin, resolving sincerely
to stand on Gods side for ever hereafter, may safely and upon good ground thus
reason within themselves; Alas! we have done very villanously, we have served
Satan a long time; we walk up and down as condemned men, ripe for destruction
long ago; Hell it self even groans for us, we may justly look every moment
for a Mittimus, to cast us headlong into the dungeo^ of Brimstone, and fire:
and yet we will try; we will go and throw down our selves before the Throne
of grace in dust and ashes, and cry as the Publican did unto the great God of
heaven* for He is a merciful God, gracious, long suffering, abundant in
goodness, and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity,
transgression and sin. And then, not only peradventure; but most certainly,
they shall be received to mercy, and he will save the life of their Souls; I
say for this Point, of Preaching mercy only to hearten Men to come in, and to
nourish in them a hope of pardon, in Case of penitency, etc. See my discourse
of true happiness. p. 173. And I will only add and advise at this time this one
thing of great importance in the Point: That after a plentiful magnifying and
amplifying the mercy of God, by its infiniteness, eternity, freeness, and
imcomparable excellency every way, only upon purpose to assure the greatest
sinners of most certain acceptance, and pardon, if they will presently turn
with truth of heart, from Satan to the living God, from all sin to his holy
Service; I say that we then take heed and make sure, as much as in us lies,
that no impenitent unbelieving wretch, none that goes on in his trespasses, or
lies willingly, and delightfully in any one sin, receive any comfort by any
such discourse, as though, as yet, He had any part or interest at all in any
one drop of all that boundless and bottomless Sea of mercy (that were a
means to nail Him fast to His natural estate for ever;) But only thence
conceive, that if He will presently lay down arms against the Majesty of
Heaven, and come in with a truly penitent humbled soul, thirsting heartily for
Jesus Christ, and resolve unfeignedly to take His yoke upon Him, there is no
number or notoriousnesse of sin, that can possibly hinder his gracious
entertainment at Gods mercy-Seate. For this end let us tell all such that
though the mercies of God be infinite, yet they are dispensed according to His
Verba, quae di^i, scripta sunt, and divinis authoritatibus continentur; quia
misericors, and miserator dominus, longanimis, and multum misericors, and

Truth. Now the Oracles of Divine Truth tell us, that those who shall find
mercy, are such as confess, and forsake their sins; Who so confesses, and
forsakes his sins shall have mercy. Proverb. 28.13. Those then who do not

forsake them, shall have no mercy. That the Parties to whom good tidings of
mercy and comfort are to be preached: are the poor, the broken hearted, them
that are bruised: those that labor, and are heavy laden; All that mourn, etc.

reigns in such a One, etc. And yet alas! How many miserable men, will needs
most falsely persuade themselves, and others, that they have a portion in the
mercies of God, and hug with extraordinary applause, and embracement, the
formal flattering messages of Men-pleasers and Time-servers, to dawbe over
such rotten hopes; who yet notwithstanding, go on still in their trespasses;
who were never yet sensible of the burden of their corruptions, and spiritual
beggary; never wounded in conscience, or troubled in mind to any purpose for
their sins, never mourned in secret and sincerely for the abominations of
their youth; could never yet find in their hearts to sell all for the buying of
that one pearl of great price, nor ever yet so prized Jesus Christ, as to
leave their darling pleasures, though very base, and abominable, to enjoy the
unspeakeable and glorious pleasures of His gracious kingdom? Nay such as
heartily serve some Captain, and Commanding sin in heart, or life, or
calling, as their own consciences, if they consult with them impartially in
cold blood, can easily tell them; as Lust, the world, ambition, the times, the
fashion, their pleasures, their profits, their Passions, their ease, self
love, pride, revenge, the dunghill delight of good fellow-ship, or the like.
And here then Let me discover a notable depth of Satan, whereby he does
baffle, and blind fold His slaves most grossly: you know full well, and hear
often the common Just, as in the Prophets time; This is a rebellious people,
lying Children, Children that will not Hear the Law of the Lord* which say to
the Seers, See not, and to the Prophets* Prophecy not unto us right things,
speak unto us smooth things, etc. Isa. 30.9.10.
Cry of all carnal men, especially under any conscionable Ministry, against
preaching of judgment, and for preaching of mercy; See the causes why they

Disc. of true Happiness. page 179, etc. But what do you think is the reason,
that they gape so greedily after Preaching of mercy? Not that they can, endure
the preaching of it, as I now have taught, and as it only ought, to those that
are without; To wit, To have first, the dearness, the sweetness, the
freeness, the full glory of Gods immeasurable mercy revealed unto them, only
as a motive, and encouragement to come in; but ever at the Close and
conclusion, to be made to understand and know certainly, that not so much as
one drop of all that bottomless depth of mercy and bounty in Jesus Christ,
does as yet belong unto them, lying in any state of unregeneratnes, or in any
kind of Hypocrisy; whilst they regard any wickedness in their heart, and are
not willing to pluck out their right eyes, and cut off their right hands, I
mean to make an everlasting divorce from their former dearest sensual
delights, and sins of their bosom: for only they who confess and forsake
their sins, shall have mercy. Pro. 28.13. This way of preaching mercy would
nettle and gall them, as much perhaps as pressing of judgment, Nay, why not
more? Proportionably to that which A Deo ahaliena, (...). Basil. Ascet. cap. 2.

Divines hold, That the privation and loss of heavenly joys, and beatificall
presence of God is far bitterer, then the torments of sense, and positive
pains of Hell. But to tell you their true meaning, and their very hearts:
Their aim in so complaining, and calling for mercy from our Ministry, is, to
have it so, and in such a manner proposed, and preached, that they may thence
collect, and conceive, that they are in state good enough, to go to Heaven as
they are; though in truth, they be mere strangers to the life of God, and
holy strictness of the Saints; were never truly humbled with sight of sin
and sense of wrath, nor experimentally acquainted at all, with the Mystery of
the New birth; That they may conclude, and say within themselves: Howsoever
some Ministers of the purer, and preciser streine, fright us continually with
nothing but judgment, terror, damnation, and will not suffer us to be quiet,
no not so much as in One sin; yet it is our good hap, sometimes to meet with
some merciful men, who will help us to Heaven without so much ado, and upon
easier terms, etc. In a word, they would upon the matter have just so much
mercy, as might assure, and warrant them to carry securely their sins, in
their bosom to Heaven with them; to live as they list in this life, and to dye
the death of the righteous; Which is a conceit most ridiculous, absurd, and
more then utterly impossible. What a hateful trick then is this, and horrible
imposture, which they suffer Satan to put them upon!

In proposing of Christ, Let the Man of God, set out as much as He can
possibly; the excellency of His Person, the unvaluable pretiousnesse of His
blood, the riches of His heavenly purchases, the gracious sweetness of His
invitations, Mark. 16.15. Matthew. 11.28. Ioh. 7.37. Rev. 22.17.
the generality, and freeness of His offers, the glorious Privileges He
brings with Him; reconciliation to God, Adoption, forgiveness of sins,
justification, righteousness, wisdom, sanctification, redemption, etc.
Possession of all things; For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollo, or
Cephas; or the world, or life, or death; or things present, or things to come;
All are yours, And ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods. 1. Cor. 3.22.23. Let
Him tell His Hearers, that the blood of Christ, is called the blood of God,
Act. 20.28; and therefore of infinite merit and unvaluable price. It sprang out
of His humane nature, and therefore finite in it is own nature and lost upon
the ground; But the Person that shed it, being the It was the Son of God, and
Lord of life, that dyed for us upon the Cross, but it was the nature of Man,
not of God wherein He died; and it was the nature of God, and infinite
excellency of the same, whence the price, value, and worth of His Passion grew.

offend from time to time, who refuse to I mean with a hearty willingness to
sell all, to part with all sin, and with a sincere resolution for
after-obedience: To take Him as a Savior, and a Lord. Never did any take Jesus
Christ savingly; who took him not as an Husband and a Lord, to serve, love,
and obey him for ever after; as well as a Savior, to disburden Him of His
sins, as a King to govern Him by His Word and Spirit, as well as a Priest to
wash him in His blood. Never was any truly justified, who was not also in some
measure truly sanctified.
take Jesus Christ offered most freely, and without exception of any person,
every Sabbath, every sermon, either in plain, and direct terms, or implyedly,
at the least. Oh! Little do people think, who sit under our Ministry,
unwrought upon by the word, what a grievous, and fearful sin they commit,
and carry home from the House of God, day after day; in neglecting so great
salvation, in forsaking their own mercy, and in judging themselves unworthy of
everlasting life; I mean, by choosing, upon a free Offer of his Soule-saving
blood, to cleave rather to a Lust, Horrible indignity! then to Dignitas and
amplitudo tum personae filij Dei, tum beneficij, ac salutis tantae, per tantam

take the Son of God for their dear and everlasting Husband. This not

heart, that Arguet mundum. Tum causam reddens, eo inquit, quod non credunt in

velocissimam. Ideo dictum est supra; Qui non credit in filium, jam condemnatus
est. Contra vero fides, justitia potissima est, adeoque sola. Nam ea aufert
reatum omnium peccatorum, and liberat a condemnatione. Nulla est condemnatio
ijs qui sunt in Christo Jesus. Atque hinc usurpata est praeclara illa sententia;
Nullum peccatum nisi infidelitas; nulla justitia nisi fides. Non quod sola
infidelitas sit peccatum; sed quod infidelitate, ut ait Augustinus, manente,
man^at peccatum omne; and ea rursus decedente, aboleatur, quoad reatum,

caetera non solvantur; dum non credit in humilem Deum homo superbus -- Cum
dicitur; Arguit mundum de peccato, non alio quam quod non crediderunt in

Faith, cap. 10 page 409.
Divines speak of it, as of a most transcendent sin, the greatest sin, the
sin of sins, the only sin, as it were, from such Places as these: But
when the King heard thereof, He was wroth, and He sent forth His armies, and
destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their City* Mat. 22.7. He means,
those who were invited to the Sons marriage, and made light of it. He that
believes not is condemned already, because, he has not believed in the Name
of the only begotten Son of God. Ioh. 3.18. When the Comforter is come* He
will convince the world of sin. -- because they believe not on me. He
means, this sin alone, says Austin. As though not believing on the Son of
God, were the only sin. It is indeed the maine, and master sin, because
(as the same Father speaks truly) This remaining, the guilt of all other
sins abides upon the soul; this removed, all other sins are remitted. Nay,
and besides the horriblenes, and hainousnes of the sin; what height, and
perfection of madness is it? That whereas a Man but renouncing his base,
rotten, transitory, sinful pleasures, dogged continually at the heels with
vengeance, and horror; And only taking Jesus Christ in whom are hidden, and
heaped up the fulness of grace* and treasures of all perfection; might have
thereupon (to say nothing of the excellency of his person, purchases of his
passion and possession of the most blessed Deity) a full and free discharge
thereby, at the hands of so happy an Husband, from every moment of the
everlastingnesse of Hellish torments; and a Quod autem lucrum dari filium? O

Deed presently sealed with His own hearts-blood, for an undoubted right, to
every minute of the eternity of heavenly joys, yet should in cold blood most
wickedly, and willingly, after so many entreaties, invitations, importunity,
only for the good of His poor immortal Soul, refuse the change! Heaven and
earth may be astonished, Angels, and all Creatures, may justly stand amazed at
this prodigious sottishnes, and monstrous madness of such miserable men! The
world is wont to call Gods people, precise fools, because, they are willing to
sell all they have, for that One pearl of great price, to part with profits,
pleasures, preferments, their right hand, their right eye, every thing, any
thing, rather then to leave Jesus Christ, etc. But who do you think now, are
the true, and great fools of the world? And who are likeliest one day to
groan for anguish of Spirit, and say within themselves, This was he, whom we
had sometimes in derision, and a Proverb of reproach. We fools accounted His
life madness, and His end to be without honor. Now is he numbered among the
Children of God, and His Lot is among the Saints. Therefore have we erred from
the way of truth, and the light of righteousness has not shined unto us, and
the Sun of righteousness has not rose upon us: we wearied our selves in the
way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts where
there lay no way: But as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it. What
has pride profited us? Or what good has riches with our vanting brought us?
All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by,
etc. Nay, and yet further, besides the extraordinarinesse of the iniquity, and
folly in refusing Christ freely offered, it shall most certainly be hereafter
plagued with extremest tormenting fury, and most desperate gnashing of teeth.
For with what infinite horror, and restless anguish will this conceit rent a
Man's heart in pieces, and gnaw upon His Conscience, when He considers in Hell,
that He has lost Heaven for a lust: and whereas He might at every sermon,
had even the Son of God His husband, for the very The work is done one Christ's
part* -- There is a righteousness which God has prepared, and is therefore
called, The righteousness of God. Nothing is looked for at our hands, but
only to take it, to believe it, and apply it unto our selves. D.P. Christ is a
free Gift, and may be had for the accepting. -- Humiliation is no further
requisite thereunto, then as it is a means to bring us to accept, and lay hold
of that grace, and life in Christ, which is freely offered. D.V. But lest any
mistake this Taking, hear what resolution before, and conversation afterward,
these two great Divines, excellently versed in the mystery of Christ, speak
of: Object. But some will say, Is nothing else required? Must God do all, and
we nothing, but take the righteousness prepared? Answ. It is true; we must
live a holy, religious, and sober life; for this end the grace of God has
appeared, etc. D.P. Howsoever though thou may have him freely, yet
notwithstanding, thou must have him as thy Lord: thou must be his servant, He
thy King, and thou His Subject, etc. When God h^th enlightened the eyes of a
Man, that He can see where this treasure is, -- He is so inflamed with the
love thereof, that He resolves He will have it, whatsoever it cost Him -- Yea
but there is a price put upon it; it must cost thee dear; a great deal of
sorrow, trouble, and other crosses. Tush, tell me not of the price; whatsoever
I have shall go for it, I will do any thing for it. Why, will thou cu^ be
thine a^^ections? Will thou give up thy life? Will thou be content to tell all
that thou have, and beg all thy life time, so thou may have this treasure?
I will do it with all my heart; I am content to sell all that I have; nothing
is so dear unto me, but I will part with it; my right hand, my right eye;
nay, if Hell it self should stand between me and Christ, yet would I pass
through the same unto him. This is that violent affection which God, puts
into the hearts of His Children, that they will have Christ whatsoever it cost
them. Although I confess, all that repent and lay hold on Christ shall have
mercy; yet what is this to thee, thou wretched Man? So long as sin has
dominion over thee, what art Thou? So long we are not only dead, but also
rotten in sin; so that it may be said of us, as it ^as as Lazarus, Ioh. 11.
Lord, says Martha, he stinketh already. So we are not only (...) and rotten
in sin, but even stink thereof, so long as any sin or sins have dominion
over us. D.V. Christ receives none, but them that deny themselves; are willing
to take up the Cross, and follow Him; that mortify the deeds of the Body by
the Spirit. To Justification nothing but Faith is required: but this caution
must be added; It must be a Faith that purifies the heart, that may work an
universal change, that may show it self in fruits, and bring forth fruits
worthy amendment of life. D.P.
taking; and have lived with Him for ever in unspeakeable Bliss, yet
neglecting so great salvation, must now, crying out therefore continually
against Himself, as the most raging Bedlam that ever breathed, lie in
unquenchable flames, without remedy, ease, or end! It is the highest honor
that can be imagined, and a Mystery of greatest amazement that ever was, that
the Son of God should make suit unto sinful Souls to be their Husband. And
yet so it is; He stands at the door, and knocks, if you will give Him
entrance, He will bring Himself and Heaven into your hearts. We are Christ's
Ambassadors, as though God did beseech you by us, We pray you in Christ's
stead to be reconciled to God; We are Christ's spokes-men, that I may so
speak, to Woo and Win you unto Him. Now what can you say for your selves
that you stand out? Why come you not in? If the Devil would give you leave to
speak out, and in plain terms: One would say, I had rather be damned then
leave my drunkenness; Another, I love the world better then Jesus Christ; A
third, I will not part with my easy and gainefull trade of Usury, for the
treasure hid in the field; And so on, So that upon the matter, you must needs
all confess, that you hereby judge your selves unworthy of everlasting life,
that you are wilful bloody Murderers of your own Souls, that you commit such
a wickedness, that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth cry shame upon you
for it. Nay, and if you go on without repentance, you may expect that the
Hellish gnawing of Conscience for this one sin of refusing Christ, may
perhaps hold scale with the United horrors of all the rest. What is the matter
I marvel, that you will not entertain the Match? If we stand upon honor,
and noble family; He that makes love, and suit unto our souls, Revel. 19 16.

gold; his locks are bushie and black as a Raven. His eyes are as the eyes of

are as a bed of Spices, as sweet flowers. His lips like Lillies, dropping sweet
smelling myrrh. His hands are as the gold rings set with the Berill: His belly
is as bright Ivory, overlaid with Saphires. His legs are as pillars of marble,
set upon Sockets of fine gold: His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the
Cedars. His mouth is most sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely, See Gifford

Now you must understand, that the Spirit of God by these outward beauties and
braveries, labors in some measure to shadow out, and represent unto us, the
incomparable excellency of inward graces; the dignity, the glory, the
spiritual fairness of Jesus Christ, that we may know, that He is wholly
and altogether lovely, delectable, and precious. If upon ease, and contentment,
He can lead us to fullness of joy, and pleasures at Gods right hand for
evermore. If we desire honorable Alliance; He will bring us to an innumerable
company of Angels, to the general assembly, and Church of the first borne,
which are written in heaven; and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
just men made perfect. If we stand upon wealth, we shall have In Christo, tanta

all things with him; which is a large Possession. If we respect love: Ioh
15.13.
Greater love has no Man then this, that a Man lay down His life for his
friends. And he being the brightness of His Fathers glory, and the express
image of his person, Hoc verb^ [(...)] non voluit dicere Apostolus, Christum
per assumptionem sormae servi, abjecisse forma dei, and desusse quod erat: sed
tantum quod gloriam illam and Majestatem, in qua erat apud Patrem, ita

came down from his bosom, the wellspring of immortality and bliss, the
fullness of joy, and that unapprocheable light, into an House of flesh, upon
this base and miserable earth. He passed through a life full of all manner
vexations, miseries, persecutions, indignities, slanders, speaking against of
Sinners, etc. He was so prodigiously slandered, that they said, Ioh. 8 48.
He had a devil; Whereas, Col. 2.9.
the fullness of the Godhead dwelled in him bodily. He was cunningly hunted
long, and at last violently haled by a Pack of Hell Hounds, to a cruel and
bloody death, which for the extremity and variety of pains, for the enraged
spite of the executioners, for the innocence, and excellency of the Person
suffering, the like never was, shall, or can be endured. His passions were
such, so bitter, and unsupportable, that they would have made any mere
creature to have sunk down under the burden of them to the bottom of Hell.
He was tortured extremely, and suffered grievous things both in Body and
Soul, from Heaven, Earth, and Hell. His blessed Body was given up as an Anvile
to be beaten upon, by the violent, and villainous hands of wretched Miscreants,
without all measure or mercy; until they had left no one part free from some
particular and special torment. His skin and flesh were ^ent with scourges;
His hands and feet pierced with nails; His head with thorns; His very heart
with the spear point. All His senses, all his parts, indeed His whole sacred
body was made a rufull spectacle to Angels and to Men, of all the most base and
barbarous usage, which malice could devise, and cruelty execute. But all this
yet, was but a shadow of His suffering, the substance of His suffering, was the

erant a nobis commeritae. Ergo poen^ts animae Christus toleravit. Chamierus,

mean, that Christ suffered in Soul only by Sympathy with the Body; But also
immediately from the wrath of God for our sins. Hear him a little after.

said it (and all Antiquity allow of it) Non soluit unionem, sed subtraxit

restrained; and for any comfort from thence, His Soul was even as a scorched
heath ground; without so much as any drop of dew of divine comfort: as a naked
tree, no fruit to refresh Him within, no leaf to give Him shadow without: the
power of darkness let loose to afflict Him: the influence of comfort
restrained to relieve Him. winchesters Sermons, page 356. Wounded He was in
Body, wounded in Spirit, left utterly desolate. Ibid. page 157.


Agony of His Soul; Give me any affliction save the affliction of the mind,
For the spirit of a man, says Solomon, will sustain all His other
infirmities; but a wounded spi^rit, who can bear? Yet His soul, though He
was the Prince of glory, and Lord of Heaven and earth, upon the Cross, was
even as a scorched Heath, without so much, as any drop of comfort either from
heaven or earth. The grievous weight of all the sins of all his Children, the
least of which had bin enough to have pressed them down into the bottom of
Hell, lay now heavy upon him. The powers of darkness were let loose to
afflict Him; He wrastled even with the fierce wrath of His Father, and all the
forces of the infernal kingdom, with such anguish of heart, that in the
Garden, it wrung out of his precious Body, a Sweat, as it were great drops of
blood falling down to the ground; with such agony of spirit, that upon the
Cross, He cried, My God, my God, why have thou There are six kinds of
dereliction, or forsaking, whereof Christ may be thought to have complained:
First, by disunion of person: secondly, by loss of grace: Thirdly, by
diminution, or weakening of grace: Fourthly, by want of assurance of future
deliverance and present support: Fifthly, by denial of protection: Sixthly, by
withdrawing* of solace, and destituting the forsaken of all comfort. It is
impious once to think, that Christ was forsaken any of the four first ways.
For the unity of His person was never dissolved; His graces were never, either
taken away, or diminished; Neither was it possible He should want assurance of
future deliverance, and present support, that was eternal God, and Lord of
life. But the two last ways he may rightly be said to have been forsaken.
Field of the Church, Lib. 5. cap. 18.
forsaken me! And the measure of all these sufferings, and sorrows, were so
past all measure, that all the creatures, save sinful Men only, both in
heaven, and earth, seemed to be amazed and moved with them. The Sun in the
heavens drew in his beams, unwilling as it were to see the spotless blood of
the Son of God, spilt as water upon the ground. The Earth it self shrunk, and
trembled, under it. The very Rocks rent asunder, as if they had sense and
feeling of His intolerable, and, save by Himself, unconquerable pains; The
whole frame of Nature seemed astonished at the mournful Complaint of the Lord
of the Whole World. These, and far more then these, or then can be expressed,
our blessed Savior, being Son of the most high God, endured for no other end,
but to ransom us from the bondage of Satan, and of Hell, in a thirsting
desire of saving all Penitent sinners; And to offer himself freely, a most
glorious, and everlasting Husband to all those, who with broken and believing
hearts cast themselves into His bosom. Such admirable, and unutterable
perfections, beauties, indowments, sufferings, and inflamed affections, as
these, in the heavenly Suter unto our sinful Souls, does mightily aggravate
the heinous and horrible sin of refusing Him.

Thus, and in this manner, would I have the Men of God to magnify, enlarge,
and represent to the hearts of their Hearers, all the excellencies of Jesus
Christ, with the worth, merit, and efficacy of His blood: To set out to the
utmost they can possibly, the glory of the Gospel with all the riches of
mercy, goodness, and free grace, revealed, and offered therein etc. So that
they tell them withal; That Jesus Christ takes none, but such as are willing,
to take upon them His yoke: That he gives himsel^e to none, but such as are
ready, to sell all, in the sense I have said, that they may enjoy his blessed
self. That the glorious grace of the Gospel shines savingly, to none, but
such as deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts; and live soberly, righteously,
and godlily in this present World; That those whose Souls are cleansed by the
blood of Jesus Christ from all sin, are only such, as walk in the light, as
God is in the light; who make conscience of detesting and declining all sins,
and works of darkness discovered to them by the light of Gods holy Book,
and sincerely set their hearts and hands, with love, and careful endeavor to
every duty enjoined therein. In a word, That, as that Fountain opened to the
house of David for sin and for uncleanesse, I mean the blood of that
immaculate Lamb, Jesus Christ, the holy and the righteous, does turn all the
sins even the very scarlet and crimson, of a truly broken heart, and every
true Mourner in Zion, into snow, and wool, so it will never wash away the
least sinful stain from the proud heart of any unhumbled Pharisee, That
hereby no strangers unto the love and life of godliness, may be deceived by
appropriating unto themselves any of these glorious things, which are only
proper to the sealed Fountain; but only conceive of them as excellent motives
to cause them to come in. I would have the Preaching of Christ fill the soul
of every true hearted Nathanael every time with unspeakeable and glorious joy,
with all those Euangelical pleasures, which neither eye has seen, nor ear
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man; But I would have it only
make every unregenerate Man sensible of what infinite blessedness He bereaves
Himself by continuing a Rebel; that thereupon He may be moved to make have
out of His present Hell, into this new heaven so fairly opened, and freely
offered unto Him.

Besides pressing the law, promising mercy, proposing Christ, etc. to stir
men in their natural states, to make them entertain thoughts of coming in,
to humble them in the sight of the Lord under the heavy burden of all their
sins, assure them also of pardon, in case they will leave Satan's service,
and so prepare them for Christ; Let Gods Ministers lay hold upon all
warrantable ways, which they shall find, and feel out of their Ministerial
experience, and holy wisdom to be availeable, and prevail for that purpose.
So that the work be done in truth: And that they do not like the Devils
dawbers, deceive them to the eternal ruin, and damnation of their Souls, by
telling them that they have Christ already, and are safe enough for salvation,
whereas indeed, as yet, there is no such matter.

Such points as these, are wont to make attentive natural men, to startle in
their seats, to look about them something more then ordinarily: To wit, to
divide the precious, from the vile; To distinguish that One true happy state of
grace, from all states of unregeneratnesse, and all kinds of Hypocrisy: to
tell them out of the Book of God, How far a Man may go in general graces,
and doing many things, etc. and yet come short of Heaven: To deliver Marks of
sincere Professors, of a saving Faith, of true repentance, of a sound
conversion, etc. But I would have this done with a great deal of spiritual
wisdom, and heavenly understanding, with much godly discretion, and caution;
least thereby, either the formal Professor may be encouraged, or the weakest
Christian disheartened: To discourse of the fewness, and scarcity of those
which shall be saved; and that even Exijt, qui ^eminat, seminare, inquit]

under the light, and within the sound of the Gospel; See Math. 20.16. Many
are called, but few chosen. Consider the Parable of the Sower. Mat. 13. There
is but one good soil, upon which the seed of the word falls prosperously; but
three reprobate grounds, as it were, upon which it is lost, as water upon the
ground. See my first Doctr. upon Genesis 6.8. etc. Thus let the Men of God
acquaint themselves, with such Points, as they conceive, the likeliest, and
most pregnant to pierce their Hearers hearts, and come closest to their
Consciences; that so, by the help of God, they may pull them out of Hell.

And there are some places also in the Book of God, which being rightly
handled, and powerfully applied, seem to have a special keenness to strike
at, and cut asunder the iron sinews of the most obstinate heart; And of more
aptness to serve for the rowsing and awaking of mere civil men, formal
Professors, Pharisees, and foolish Virgins out of their desperate slumber of
spiritual Selfe-deceit. Such as these. Deuteronomy. 29.19.20. And it come to pass,
when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless Himself in His
heart, saying; I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine
heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: The Lord will not spare Him, but then
the anger of the Lord, and His jealousy, shall smoke against that man, and all
the curses that are written in this Book, shall lie upon Him, and the Lord
shall blot out his name from under Heaven. Ps. 78.21. God shall wound the hairy
Scalpe of such a One as goes on still in his trespasses. Pro. 1.24.28. Because
I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched forth my hand, and no Man
regarded: etc. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall
seek me early, but they shall not And justly they find Him not, ex l^ge
talionis. God himself answers them; Nay, their own hearts answer themselves:
Go, whom you have spent your life in seeking, seek to them now. Let them save
you, at this, whom ye sought at all other times. As for me, it shall come to
pass, as I cried, and you would not hear; So you shall cry, and seek, and
shall not find, or be heard, (says the Lord). Yes, they found Him; but with a
door shut between Him and them. But what found they? The Parable of the ten
Virgins tells us; a Nescio vos. -- Hoe knows them not: they took too short a
time to breed acquaintance in. Nescio vos they find, that so seek. Profecto
ad hoc tonitru etc. At this clap, He that waketh not, is not asleep, but
dead. Winchesters Sermons, page 181. I demand; Will any time serve to seek
God? Is God at all times to be found? It is certain, Not, The very limitation,
(of Dum inveniri potest) shows plainly, that other times there be, wherein
Seek Him you may, but find him you shall not. Idem Ibid. page 178.

suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. Ezekiel. 24.13. In thy filthiness

land of Sodom, and Gomorrah in the Day of judgment, then for that city. And.

heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. And 5.46. And if
you salute your brethren only, what do you more then others? and verse. 20. I
say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of
the Scribes, and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of
heaven. These fellows represented to the eye of the World, a goodly and
glorious show of freedom from gross sins; I am not, says the Pharisee,
Luke. 18. as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, etc. Of works;
First, Of righteousness; I give tithes of all that I possess: Secondly, Of
Piety; He went up to pray. Thirdly, Of mercy; Besides fasting, and prayer,
they gave alms, Mat. 6. etc. And yet Christ speaks thus peremptorily to his
hearers. Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees, etc. ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. He
says not simply; ye shall not enter: But ye shall in no case enter. And yet
how many who come short of these, will be very angry, if the ministers, tell
them, that they shall certainly come short of the kingdom of heaven.

I have done with dawbing and plaistering over rotten hearts with plausible
persuasions, that they shall not be damned: I mean that most cruel, and
accursed trade of strengthening with lies, the hands of the wicked, that he
should not return from his wicked way by promising him life. Ezekiel. 13.22.
Whereby thousands, are sent hood-winckt to hell, more is the pity! even in
this blessed time of the Gospel: And I come now to another error, about
comforting afflicted Consciences. Which is this:

2. When the spiritual Physician promises comfort, applies the promises,
assures of mercy, acceptance and pardon:

1. When the ground of grief, is not in truth trouble for sin, but some
outward trouble. Some, in such a case may cast out by the way some faint, and
formal complaints of their sins, and seem to seek direction, and
satisfaction about the state of their Souls; when as the true root and
principal Spring of their present heaviness, and hearts-griefe, is some
secret earthly coffeehouse, the bi^^ng and bitterness of some worldly
sting. It may be the loss or desperate course of some over-loved child;
decay, and going backward in their estate; fear of falling into beggary; some
unexpected discontents and disappointments after marriage; Some great disgrace,
and shame fallen upon them in the eye of the world; Some long and tedious
sickness, pinching them extremely for want of peace with God, and patience to
pass through it. Or the like.

In this case, after the man of God by his best wisdom, and searching
experimental trials, and Interrogatories fitted for that purpose, whereby he
may give a strong conjecture, if not a peremptory censure, has discovered the
Imposture: Let his desire and endeavor be, to turn the torrent of worldly
tears (and taking on for transitory things) upon sin. When a vein is
broken, and bleeds inward, or a man bleeds excessively at the Nose, the
physician is wont to open a vein in the arm, so to divert the current of the
blood, that it may be carried the right way, for the safety and preservation
of the party. Do proportionably in this point.

Let such know. First, That 2. Cor. 7.10.
sorrow of the world works death. Quid autem est seclidi^m mundum? Quando
contristaris propter divitias, propter gloriam, propter mortuum; omnia haec
secundum mundu^; id^o and mortem fa^^t. Nam qui propter gloriam contristatur,
invi^et, and saepe perire cogitur. Qualis erat tristitia Cain and Esau: hanc
tristitiam vo^at secundum mundum, quae trisiibus perniciosa. Chrysostom. in 2.
Cor. cap. 7.

Sicut tinea comedit vestimentum, and sicut vermis rodit lignum, ita tristitia
nocet cordi. Bern. de modo been vivendi. cap. 11. It pierces even to the
marrow of the bone, it makes bitter our whole life, and poysoneth all our
actions. Char. lib. 1. cap. 31. Worldly sorrow works a change in the body, it
brings gray hairs on the head, and furrows and wrinkles in the face. It
turns youth into old age, and strength into weakness, and so causes death.
Dike of repentance. cap. 1.


It dries the bones, consumes the marrow, chils the blood, wastes the Spirits,
eats up the heart, shortneth life, and cutteth off too soon, from the day of
gracious visitation. It is a base thing for an immortal Soul to be put thus
out of tune, and temper with mortal things, and most unworthy it is heavenly
birth, breeding under the ministry, and everlasting abode. Secondly, That
sorrow spent upon the world, is like a perfumed precious water, thrown into
the channel, or sinke-hole, which would make a sweet sent in an humbled soul,
and help excellently against the noisome savor of sin. Fire put into the
thatch, would turn all into combustion; Tristitia enim sic est, quomodo
stercus. Stercus non loco suo positum immunditia est. Stercus non loco suo
positum, immundam facit domum; loco suo positum, fertilem facit agrum. --
Inveni nescio, quem tristem: stercus video, locum quaero: Dic, amice, unde
tristis es? Perdidi, inquit, pecuniam. Locus immundus, fructus nullus, Audiat
Aposiolum; Tristitia mundi mortem operatur. Non solum fructus nullus sed magna
pernicies. Sic and de caeteris rebus ad gaudia secularia pertinentibus; quas
res longum est enumerare. Video alium tristantem, gementem, flentem: multum
stercor^s video, and ibi locum quaero. Et cum viderem tristem, flentem inspexi
and orautem. Orans, nescio quid mibibonae significationis ingessit. Sed adhuc
locum quaero. Quid enim si iste oraus, gemens, magno fletu mortem roget
inimicis suis. Etiam sic jam plorat, jam rogat, jam orat; Locus immundus,
fructus nullum* -- Inspexialium rursus, gementem, flentem, orantem; stercus

peccatum: agnosco agrum, expecto fructum: Deo gratias. Bono loco est stercus,
non ibi vacat, fructum parturit. August. de temp. Sermon. 151.
Dung placed in your parlour, would impoison all; But lay the one upon the
hearth, and it would warm, and comfort; the other upon the land, and it
fatneth and makes fruitful: So sorrow misplaced upon earthly things, fills a
man with swarms of carking confusions, and brings many devouring Harpies into
the heart; but being turned upon Tristitia illa solum ad peccata utilis est;
quod hinc manifestatur: Qui pro amissis divitijs contristatur; damnum non
solvit: Qui pro mortuo contristatur, jacentem non excitat: Qui propter morbum
contristatur, non solum non curatur, sed etiam auget morbum. Qui vero in
peccatis contristatur, hic solum utilitatis aliquid amplius a tristitia
accepit; absumit enim and evanescere facit peccata. Chrysostom. in 2. Cor. cap.
7. Mortem lugere omittens, luge peccata, ut ipsa deleas: propter hoc enim
tristitia facta est, non ut in morte, nec in vlla alia re tali doleamus, sed ut
ipsa ad delenda ut amur peccata: Et quod hoc verum sit, exemplosacio
manifestum. Remedia medicinalia propter illos tantum morbos, facta sunt, quos
toller^ possunt, non propter illos, quos nihil ad juvare possunt, etc.
Mulctatus est quispiam pecunijs, tristatus est, mulctam non emendavit: silium
amisit, doluit, mortuum non resuscitavit, nec defuncto pr^fuit: Flagellatus est
quis, alapis caesus, contumelijs affectus, doluit, non revocavit contumcliam,
etc. Vides horum nulli prodesse tristitiam. Peccavit quis, tristatus est,
peccatum delevit. Idem ad Popul. Antiochenum, Hom. 5.
sin, and former sinful courses, which is the only right, proper, profitable
use thereof, it may procure a great deal of ease, and enlargement to the heavy
Spirit, and help to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Thirdly, That the
tithe perhaps of taking on, trouble of mind, vexation of Spirit, sadness and
sorrow, about worldly things in respect of the bulk, and quantity, if sincere,
and set upon the right object, might serve I mean both repentances: Legal,
which is bred by believing the threats of the Law, and by accident leads unto
Christ. Evangelicall, which springs from Faith in the promises of the Gospel,
after we have taken Christ. For Faith must go before this repentance, as the
ground and root thereof. In time, Faith and Evangelicall repentance are both
together, but in the order of nature, Faith is first.
to drive us unto Christ, and afterward in Gods gracious acceptance, for
saving repentance. Me thinks it should be a very quickening motive to make a
man Quid enim quispiam sacere possit, quo genero sum virum cogat contristari?
Auseret pecunias? Sed habet in Coelis divitias. Patria eijciet? Sed in
coelestem civitatem mittet. Vincula inijciet? Sed habet Conscientiam solutam,
and exteriorem non sentiet catenam. Sed interficiet corpus? At iterum resurget.
Et sicut cum umbra pugnans, and aerem verberans perculere poterit neminem: Sic
and cum justo pugnans cumumbra tantum pugnat, and vires suas dissolvit, nullam
illi plagam valens infligere. Itaque da mihi de Coelorum r^gno confidere, and
s^vis, me hodie jugula; caedis? gratias tibi habeo, quod me celeriter ad illa
hona transmattis. Chrysostom. ad Pop. Antioch. hom. 5.
be sorry for nothing but sin, and to turn all his grief and groans, sighs,
and tears, upon his transgressions Igitur postquam manifest oration
demonstravit, quod neque pecuniarum mulctam, neque contumeliam, neque
calumniam, neque flagella, neque valetudinem, neque mortem, neque aliud quid
talium inducta tristitia iastaurare posset, sed solum delere peccatum, and
bujus est destructiva; certum, quo a propter hanc solam causam facta est. Ne
amplius igitur pecuniarum jacturam doleamus; sed cum peccamus, tantum doleamus:
multa enum hic ex^ri^^^ia utilitas. Mul^la^us es? ne doleas; neque enim
proderit. Pe^cu^^^ Dole, utile namque est. Ibid.
only: To wit; To Consider, that an impenitent carnal worldling does pass
through even in this life (where he has all the heaven he is ever like to
have) incomparably more comfortless hearts-griefe, slavish torment of mind,
and heaviness of Spirit toward endless pains, then the strictest Christian,
and most mortified Saint, does endure in his passage to everlasting pleasures.
Fourthly, That, besides, many other pestilent properties, worldly sorrow does
also double, nay multiply, and mightily enrage the venom, bitterness, and
^ting of every cross, accident, loss, disgrace, etc. When 2. Sam. 17.23
Achitophel, ita ratiocinatur: Absalom, aut vincet, au^ non: sino^ vincat,
incidam in manus Davidis: Si vicerit, adhuc ego inglorius vivam, Chusat
consilio videbitur vicesse.

-- Voluit potius mori, quam inglorius vivere. ^et. Mart. in 2. Sam. cap. 17.


Ahitophel was disgraced, by neglect of his counsel, which was in those days,
as if a man had enquired at the Oracle of God, carnal grief so grew upon him,
that he gate him home to his house, put his household in order, and hanged
himself. What was the disgrace to this desperate end? Haman being crossed by
Mordecaies discourtesie, and contempt, did so trouble himself, and take on,
that, having Hest. 5.11.12.13.
told his wife, and friends, of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of
his children, and all things, wherein the King had promoted him, and how he
had advanced him above the Princes, and servants of the King, etc. Yet
professes unto them; that all this availed him nothing, so long as he saw
Mordecai the Jew, sitting at the Kings gate. Now whether do you think was the
most grievous thing to bear; the bare omission of a mere complement, or an
universal distaste, and dis-injoyment of all outward comforts heaped upon Him
to the height, and in excellency? The hundredth part of Jobs losses, and less,
has many times since, made many a covetous worldling to cut his own throat. I
have known some, for the loss of an over-loved child, to have languished,
fallen into a consumption, and lost their own lives. But now on the other
side, besides many other gracious effects, sorrow, according to God, is more
delicious, and sweeter then any worldly delight: As Quamvis quid tristitia
molestius? Sed quando secundum deum fit, mundi gaudio melior est. Illud enim in
nihilum desinit; haec autem poenitentiam haud poenitendam in salutem operatur.
Et enim, quod admirabile in ist^, hoc est, quod nullum poenitet sic doluisse,
id quod mundanae tristitiae proprium est. Quid germanius germano filio? and
quid morte illius majorem dolorem infert? Attamen parents se ipsos prae dolor
plangentes impetu luctus, quamvis inde nullam ferant utilitatem, ij tamen post
tempus poenitentia^ agunt quod immodice doluerunt, [worldly mournig must be
mourned for, and such tears unwept, with a new supply of teares] cum nihil
utilitatis inde consecuti sunt, imo and se magis afflixerint: sed non talis est
tristitia secundum Deum, sed habet gemina commoda: and quod quis se non incusat
ob dolorem; and quod tristitia in salutem desinit: Ambobus illis commodis ista
privata est: Chrysostom. in 2. Cor. cap. 7. Hom. 15. Sicut enim mundi gaudium
tristitiae consortio copulatur, ita etiam secundum dominum lacbryme jugem
pariunt, certamque laetitiam. Idem, in Matthew. 2. hom. 6.
Chrysostom truly tells us in many places. To whom Modern Divines accord. The
very tears, that a good Conscience sheds, says Ier. Dike of conscience. cap.
13. page 232.
one, have more joy, and pleasure in them, then the worlds greatest joys. This
is certain, says Concedo quidem illud, in ipso moerore, ac dolor piorum plus
gaudij inesse, and verae laetitiae, quam in risu huius mundi: Nam cumsuspirijs
inenarrabilibus conjunctum est gaudium ineffabile. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 11.
page 670. Dulciores sunt lachrymae orantium, quam gaudia Theatrorum. August. in
Psalm. 127. page 743.
another, that there is more lightness of heart, and true delight in the
sorrow of the Saints, then in the lowdest laughters of the world. For
unspeakeable joy is mingled with un-utterable groans.

2. When it is not any kindly touch of conscience for s^^ wrought by the
ministry: but terrors, and affrighting distempers arising from the dark mists
of a melancholicke humor in the brain, which cause a man to complain. In
this black, and sad humor, Satan, God suffering him, (and of it self also it
is pregnant enough this way) has great advantage to raise, and represent to
the Fantasy many fearful things, terrible objects, griesly thoughts,
hideous injections and temptations to despair, selfe-destruction, etc.
Whereupon the party so affected and afflicted is wont out of impatiency of such
uncouth horrors, and heavines to address himself, and have recourse to some
man of God, some noted Physician of the soul; not from any purpose and
resolution to become a new man, and alter his courses; but only for hope of
ease, enlargement from the tyranny of that ferall passion, and recovery to
wonted quietness of mind: not expecting or aiming at all, at any other change;
but from present melancholy to former mirth; from this abhorred, irksome,
insupportable state of sadness; to his accustomed sensual, or civil
contentment at least.

In this case let the art, and aid of physic be improou'd, to abate and
take off the excess and phantasticalnesse of this horrible humor: and then
let the party be advised, to imploie, and spend the native, and kindly Dolor
melancholicus converti debet in dolorem, qui est secundum Deum. Alsted. Theol.
Casuum, cap. 25.
sadness, of that uncomfortable constitution, in sorrowing for sin, in
trembling at the threats of Gods judgments, in fearing to offend, and flying
under the wings of Christ for sanctuary; that so he may happily bring
supernatural, and heavenly lightsomnesse into his soul, by pardon from God,
peace of conscience, and evangelicall pleasures. It is incredible to consider,
what assistance, and advantage a gracious man has, by his sweet Quid Christo
suavius? -- Apprehensio cujus est cum suavitate magna, and gaudio incredibili,
ut re^ plane suavis est ea, quae apprehenditur. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 8. page
556.
communion with Jesus Christ, and those refreshing beams of comfort which
shine from his face, to confine and conquer those many impertinent, irksome,
and vexing vagaries of this wild humor; which with much folly and fury
tyrannise in the fearful fantasies of graceless men, and make their life
very disconsolate, and abhorred. I am persuaded, the very same measure of
melancholicke matter, which raises many times in the heads, and hearts of
worldlings, (having besides, the guilt of their unforgiven sins staring with
griesly representations in the face of their consciences, and acquainted with
no comfort but that which comes from carnal joys) continual clouds of many
strange horrors, and ghastly fears, nay and sometimes makes them stark mad; I
say, the very same in a sanctified man may be so mollified and moderated by
spiritual delight, and sovereignty of grace, that he is not only preserved
from the sting, and venom of them, but by Gods blessing from any such
desperate extremities, violent distempers and distractions, which keep the
other in a kind of hell upon earth. If the very darkness of the hellish
dungeon were in the heart; yet reaching out the hand of faith, and receiving
Christ that blessed Sun of righteousness, would dispell and disperse it to
nothing: Much more me thinks, the light of grace and heavenly wisdom, may
in some good measure, dissolve and master the mists and miseries of this
earthly humor. Religion then, and religious courses, and conformities do not
make melancholic men mad; as the great Bedlams of this world would bear us in
hand. For you must know that besides Belials and debosht companions, there are
a generation of worldly wise men also, right brave and jolly fellows in their
own conceits, and in the opinion of some flattering clawbacks; But by
testimony of the Truth it self, stark mad about the service of God and there
own salvations, who cursedly ^eare their own consciences, with the hottest
iron in the Devils forge, by breaking out into such blasphemies as these, when
they hear, or see, any extraordinary heavie-heartednes, temptation,
distraction, or spiritual distemper, to have seizd upon any that desires to
be saved: You see now, what becomes of so much reading the scriptures, of
plying prayer, and private duties with so much ado; of meddling with mysteries
of religion; of meditating so much of heavenly things; Of taking sin so
deeply to heart, and holding such strict conformity to Gods word, etc. Blessed
God! Is thine holy book become, (execrable blasphemy!) a perverter,
distracter, and empoysoner of men's souls; which being the glorious issue of
thine own infinite understanding, was purposely created as a most precious
(...), hoc est, a sanandis omnibus morbis.
Panacea, an universal medicinal storehouse for the cure of all spiritual
maladies; an inexhausted treasury of all sound comfort, true joy, peace, and
refreshing! Now the Lord rebuke thee Satan, and return as dung upon thine own
face this villainous, base and wicked slander, which by thy graceless
instruments thou labourest to cast upon the glorious face of Christianity, the
incomparable sweetness of the ways of grace, and that One necessary thing. I
have known, when the only wise God, has suffered for ends seen and seeming
good to his heavenly wisdom the hideous, and raging humor of melancholy, to
darken the native clearenes of the animal spirits in the brain, requisite to
a due discretion of things apprehended; and to blunder, and disorder the
objects, and operations of the fantasy in his dearest child, even to
distraction, and breaking out into that inordinate passion, against reason; I
say then, the concurrent cry and clamor of the enemies to the power of
Godliness to be: This it is now to be so bookish, to follow preachers so much,
to be more holy then their neighbors, never to have done in serving of God:
Her so much reading the scriptures, and such poring upon precise books (so
they call those, which most pierce the conscience, and guide the cleerliest in
the holy path) has made her stark mad: The Puritan is now besides her self,
etc. Now I say again, the Lord rebuke thee Satan, who sits with such extreme
malice, and soule-killing folly in the hearts and heads of such miserable men,
whom thou so sottishly hood-winkes, and hardens to the height, for a most
desperate downefal, and horrible confusion at last.

Were now the glorified soul of that blessed Saint consulted with, and asked:
Did thou ever receive hurt by reading Gods blessed book, by searching
sweetly into the great mystery of Christ crucified, by meditation upon heavenly
things? Did the sacred sense of those divine Oracles dissettle thy noble
faculties, or ever make sad thy heart? etc. Oh! with what infinite indignation,
would it sly in the face of such cursed Cavillers, and wranglers against the
truth?

Is it possible for the sole, and sovereign Antidote sent from heaven by God
himself against the sting and venom of all heart-griefe, and horror; the
sacred Sun of saving truth, which is only able to ennoble and glorify our
understandings with wisdom from the breast of the everlasting counsel of
Jesus Christ, should become the cause of discomfort, and dissettlement of the
soul? No, no. There is such a quickening, healing, and mighty efficacy and
vigor shed into it from the Father of lights, and shining in it from the face
of Christ, that by the help of the blessed spirit, it can turn darkness into
light, death into life, hell into heaven, the deepest horror, into height of
joy. Tell me of any misery upon the body, soul, outward state, or good name;
any calamity felt or feared in this life, or the life to come; and if thou will
be converted and counseled, I can send thee to some, both Promise, and
Precedent in this book of God, which may upon good ground fill thine heart as
full with sound comfort, as the Sun is of Light, and the Sea of Waters. Nay,
give me a wounded spirit with all it is inexplicable terrors, and bitterness;
which is the greatest misery, and extremest affliction, of which an
understanding Soul is capable in this life. And let first all the physicians
in the world, even the Rose-knights, as they call themselves, lay all their
heads, skill, and experience together, for the cure; Let all the highest
Monarchs upon earth shine upon it with their Imperial favors for comfort; Let
the depth of all humane wisdom, and the height of the most excellent oratory
be improoued to persuade it peace; Let all the creatures in heaven and earth
contribute their several abilities and utmost, to still it is rage: And when
all these have done, and have done just nothing; I will fetch a cordial out of
Gods own book, which shall mollify the anguish, expel the venom, and bind
it up with everlasting peace, which passes all understanding; that the broken
bones may rejoice, and the poor soul groaning most grievously under the
guilty horror of many foul abominations, and ready to sink into the gulf of
despair, be sweetly bathed and refreshed in the fountain opened by the hand
of mercy for sin, and for uncleanness, Christ's dearest blood, the glorious
wel-spring of all lightsomnesse, and joy.

Hear how precisely for this purpose, and how punctually against such
pestilent cauillers some of the ancient Fathers do Puritanize:

lectio praestat. Chrysostom. in Genesis Hom. 29.
Chrysostom, either of body, or soul, but may receive a medicine out of Gods
book;

One comes oppressed with sadness, and anxiety of businesses, overwhelmed with
grief; But presently hearing the Prophet saying, Psalm. 42.11.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou so disquieted within
me? Hope thou in God, for I will yet praise him, who is the health of my
countenance, and my God; He receives abundance of comfort, and abandons all
heavines of heart.

Another is pinched with extreme poverty; takes it heavily, and grieves, seeing
others flowing in riches; swelling with pride, attended with great pomp, and
state: But he also hears the same Prophet, saying; Psalm. 55 22.
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: And again, Psalm.
49.16 17.
Be not afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is
increased: For when he dies, he shall carry nothing away: His glory shall
not descend after him.

There is another, which assaulted with insidiations, and calumnies, is much
troubled, thinks his life uncomfortable, finding no help in man: He is also
taught by the same prophet, that in such perplexities, we must not resort to
the arm of flesh. Hear what he says; They slandered, and I prayed. Psalm.
109.2.3 4.
The mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against
me: They have spoken against me with a lying tongue. They compassed me about
also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. For my love,
they are my adversaries; But I give my self to prayer. Another is slighted,
and contemned by some base contemptible underlings; and forsaken of his
friends; And that is it, which most troubles his mind, and goes nearest to his
heart: But he also, if he will come hither, does hear that blessed man
saying: Ps. 38.11.12.13.14.15.
My Lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand
afar off. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
that seek my hurt, speak mischeivous things, and imagine deceipts all the day
long. But I, as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens
not his mouth. Thus I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no
reproves: for in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou will hear, O Lord my God. He
concludes thus:

Thou have seen, how that any misery pressing our mortality, a convenient
Ant^ote may be taken out of Scripture, and all the carking of this life may be
cured; neither need we to be greived for any thing which befalls us. Therefore
I beseech you that henceforward, you would come hither, and listen diligently
to the reading of divine writ. And not only when you come hither, but also
take the bible into your hands at home, and receive with great affection, the
profit to be found in it. For from thence springs much gain: First, that the
tongue may be reformed by it: The soul also takes wings, soars aloft, and is
gloriously illightened with the beams of the Sun of righteousness, and that
while is freed from the entisements of impure thoughts, enjoying much
calmness, and contentment. Furthermore, that which corporal food does for
increasing bodily strength: the same does reading perform to the soul.

All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable: and writ by
the spirit of God for this purpose, says great (...). Basil. in Ps. 1. Non
dicit, ut inde alij nobis applicent pharmaca, sed (...)] singuli ipsi nobis
eligamus.
Basil, that in it, as a common Mart of soule-medicines, every one of us may
choose a medicine proper, and fit for his spiritual malady.

even of Her sex, whom as I told you before, much reading of Scriptures and
other good books made mad, if the extremest malice of the most mortal enemies
to the ways of God may be credited; does stir them up with extraordinary
earnestness to a diligent, industrious and fruitful reading of Gods Book, in
many Passages of His Epistles.

men that made the Homilies, seem to apprehend themselves, and they commend to
us the excellent sweetness, which may be sucked from the breasts of
consolations in meditating upon the Scriptures, by this their emphaticall and
effectual expression: Let us ruminate say they, and as it were chew the cudde,
that we may have the sweet juice, spiritual effect, marrow, honey, kernel,
taste, comfort and consolation of them.

I have said all this, upon purpose, least melancholic men should be miss-led,
or disheartened by the cursed counsel of carnal friends, and wicked clamours
of the world, from turning their sadness into sorrow for sin; and from plying
Gods blessed book, and the powerful ministry thereof, the only wellspring of
all true lightsomnesse, and joy; and able as I said before, if they wilbee
converted, and counseled, to dispell the very darkness of hell out of their
hearts. Me thinks, they rather above others, should be encouraged hereunto:
1. Because they have a passive advantage, that I may so speak, when it
pleases God, to sanctify for that purpose, and set on work the spirit of
bondage, by reason of their sad dispositions, and fearful spirits, to be
sooner affrighted, and dejected by comminations of judgments against sin;
more feelingly to take to heart the miseries, and dangers of their natural
state; more easily to tremble and stoop under the mighty hand of God, and
hammer of his Law. Guiltiness, and horror; damnation and hell beget in their
timorous natures stronger impressions of fear: whereupon they are wont to
taste deeplier of legal contrition, and remorse; and so proportionably to feel
and acknowledge a greater necessity of Jesus Christ; to thirst after him more
greedily, to prize him more highly; and at length to throw their trembling
souls into his blessed bosom with more eagerness, and importunity. And
having once entered into the holy path, their native fearfulness being
rectified, and turned the right way, they many times walk on afterward, with
more fear to offend, ( and happy is the man that fears always) more
watchfulness over their ways, tenderness of conscience, impatiency of losing
spiritual peace, sensiblenesse of infirmities, and failings, awfulnes to Gods
word, etc. 2. And because of all others, such men have most need of
lightsomnesse, and refreshing: which when carnal counselors, and flattering
mountebanks of the Ministry, labor to introduce into their dark heads, and
heavy hearts by the arm of flesh, outward mirth, and such other means, they
only palliate, and dawbe: and are so far from doing any true good, that
thereby they drown them many times deeper and more desperately into the
dungeon of melancholy afterward. So that, a melancholicke man, let him turn
him, which way, he will, is like, without the light of grace, to live, a very
miserable life upon earth, and as it were in some part of hellish darkness:
to which also at length, shall be added the torment, if he dye impenitently.
But now let them address themselves to the book of life, and thence only
they may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of consolation: Let them
lean their sorrowful souls, improoving natural sadness to mourn more
heartily for sin, upon the promises there: and every several one will shine
upon them with a particular, heavenly, and healing light, with sound, and
lasting joy. All those then are stark mad, either with ignorant or learned
malice, who bear the world in hand, that reading scriptures, plying the
powerful ministry, taking sin to heart, etc. will make melancholic men mad.

If you desire to know, before I pass out of the point, the differences
between the heavines of a melancholic humor, and affliction of conscience
for sin, take notice of such as these.

1 Terror for sin springs out of the conscience, and from the smart of a
spiritual wound there: Melancholy dwells, and has his chief I mean in
respect of terrible representations. For I know well from the learned
Physicians, that that humor is originally settled in the spleen. But from
thence arise clouds of Melancholic vapors, which annoy the heart, and
passing up to the brain, counterfets terrible objects to the Fantasy; and
polluting both the substance, and the spirits of the brain, causes it without
external occasion, or object, to forge monstrous fictions, and terrible to the
conceit; which the judgment taking, as they are presented by the disordered
Instrument, delivers to the heart; which by reason of the Sympathy between the
brain and the heart, the thoughts and affections, and having no judgment of
discretion in it self, but giving credit to the mistaken report of the brain,
is affected proportionably with terror, sadness, and fear.
residence in the fantasy: uncomfortably ouercasts, and darkens the
splendor, and lightsomnesse of the animal spirits in the brain.

2 The melancholic man is extremely sad, and knows not why: He is full of
fear, doubts, distrust, and heaviness, without any true and just ground,
arising only from the darkness and disorder of the fantasy, the griesly
fumes of that black humor in the brain: But a broken heart, a thousand to
one, can readily tell you, the particular sins, the crying abomination, the
legal hammer, and ministerial hand that made it bleed. His trouble is
ever^p^^^^a^se, clear, and evident, and the greatest that ever brought misery
upon mankind; weight of sin, and the wrath of God. A melancholic man will
ride many miles, walk many hours, and at length be able to give no account
of the exercise, and discourse of his mind, or what his thoughts have been
all the while: But he that is troubled in mind for sin, can for the most
part tell right well, and recount exactly to his spiritual physician, the
several temptations, suggestions, and injections; the hideous conflicts with
Satan: His objections, exceptions, replies, (...), Ephesians. 6.11. (...), 2. Cor.
2.11. (...), Revel. 2.24.
Methods, Devises, and depths, which have afflicted his heavy Spirit, since the
first illightening, convincing, and affrighting his awaked, and working
Conscience.

3 The soul may be seized upon with terror of conscience, and spiritual
distemper, the body being sound and in good temper; In excellency of health,
purity of blood, symmetry of parts, vivacity of spirit, etc. But the horrors of
melancholy are wont to haunt corrupted constitutions; where obstructions
hinder the free passage of the humors, and spirits; the blood is overgrosse,
and thick, etc.

4 Melancholy makes a man almost mad with imaginary fears, and strange
Chymaraes of horror, which have no Being, but only in the monstrous
compositions of a darkened and distempered Brain. He is many times by the
predominancy of that cowardly humor, afraid of every man, of every thing, of
any thing; of a shadow, of the shaking of a leaf, of his own hands, of his
own heart. He Haec est ratio, cur aliqui timent non timenda: cur in
suspiciones mirabiles and falsissimas cadunt: ita ut credant se aliquan^o
quaeri ad mortem, vel ad incarceratione^, vel spoliationem, and inde fugiunt
nemine persequente, trepidantes timore, ubi non est ti^or. Cognovitalem tempore

in nemora occulta, nec ultra comparuit. Gerson de passionibus animae Consid. 20.
fears where no fear is, where there is no probability, no possibility, even
in the very midst of security. His fear sometimes is so extremely foolish;
that he can Let a melancholy person upon the sudden hear, or see some
fearful thing, the strength of his imagination is such, that he will
presently fasten the thing upon himself. As if he see, or hear, that a man
has hanged himself, or is possessed of a Devil, it presently comes to his
mind, that he must do so to himself, or that he is, or at least, shall be
possessed. In like manner upon relation of fearful things, presently his
fantasy works, and he imagines, that the thing is already; or shall befall
him. Perkins. Cases of Conscience. cap. 12. sect. 2.
hear of no fearful thing fallen upon others, but he thinks verily, the
very same thing shall befall him: so prodigious, that Sic aliquis existimabat
se gallum, and more galli cantabat. Alius murilegum, and sub lectis mures
quaerebat. Alius imaginans se habere cornua in front, verecundabatur
quotiescunque videbat se inspici, and frontem tegebat. Alius imaginans se
notari de insectione leprae, vel de morbo caduco, omnes fugiebat, and
trepidabat aspectus, and sermones. Alius imaginans se habere pedes ferreos
calcabat validissime super terram. Alius ambulare non audebat phantasians pedes
suos esse vitreos. Gerson. loco supra citato.
some of them, thinking their feet to be of glass, have been afraid to
walk: Others imagining themselves to be noted for lepers, durst not come into
any company, etc. But now a troubled conscience is ordinarily fearelesse of any
thing, but the anger of God. Bodily tortures, outward trouble, tyrants threats,
even the Prince of terror, death it self in his apprehension and eye, would
be as nothing, to the guilty glance of one cursed lust. He would not care, or
fear though all the creatures in Christendom were turned into Bears, or
Devils about him, so that all were well at home. If he could get into his
bosom that sweet peace which passes all understanding; Oh! then would he
be more then conqverour over the whole world, and ten thousand hells.

5. Melancholy may be something abated, the brain cleared, the heart eased by
the aid and excellency of the art of physic: But in the case of a wounded
conscience, there is no help under heaven to be had; No friends, or physic,
Non Siculae dapes, etc.

Not all King Denis dainty fare,

no mirth or music, no princely favor or dainty fare, etc. can possibly give
any ease at all. Nay they will all far rather enrage the wound, then weaken
the rage. It is Christ, Christ, and nothing but Christ, which can comfort in
this confusion of spirit.

3. When complaint of sin is confusedly only and in general: When any comes
with a troubled conscience for sin, we ought wisely to discern, whether
they be meanly grieved with a general sight of their sin, or whether they
be extremely thrown down with the burden of particular sins* if so they
be, then it is good at the first to show, that no sin is so great, but in
Christ it is pardonable, and that there is mercy with God that he might be
feared: so on the otherside, showing the mercy to come from God, but so as they
are nothing fit to receive mercy, unless they feel their particular and
pricking sins. But if their sorrow be more confessed in general things,
then it is good to humble them more, and more, to give them a terror of Gods
justice for particular sins: for experience does teach, that this is the best
way to obtain sound comfort both to see our sin, and to be humbled to see
our sin: -- That being thoroughly thrown down, we may directly seek
Christ, and keep no stay until we have found comfort in him, who then is most
ready to free us from our sin, and to comfort us with his spirit when we are
most cast down with our sins, and most fear them. Greeneham. In his Grave
counsels page 6.
Many deal with God, and his ministers in confession of their sins, says a
good Divine, as Nebuchadnezzar with his Inchanters about his dream, that he
had dreamed; he told them, and desired an interpretation; But what his dream
was he could not tell. So many confess themselves sinners, and cry out that
they are greiuous offenders, and desire pardon: But wherein they have sinned,
and what their sins are, they cannot, or will not tell. And how is it
possible the physician should help him, who only says, he is not well, but
will not tell him where? I have sometimes visited those, who being pressed to a
sight and sense of their sinnefulnesse, and cursednesse, upon purpose to fit
them for Christ, have acknowledged in general, that they were sinners, but
descending to the particulars of the Law, (which was horrible to hear)
justified themselves through out. Of which extreme spiritual misery and
prodigious madness, Ignorance (Tho I know Satan mannageth that, and all other
advantages with all the malice, and cunning he can possibly, to the overthrow
of souls) is the principal ground; the prime, but pestilent occasion: I say,
Ignorance, which though it be not perhaps so much talked of, taxed, and taken
to heart as others, yet is a loude-crying sin of the Kingdom. For it is a
most incredible thing, and of infinite amazement, how universally it reigns in
this glorious Id quidem aud^o dicere, clariorem Evangelij Christi doctrinam
nulli unquam populo ante propositam esse, quam sit ca, quam nos quotidie
audimus in Ecclesijs nostris.

-- Si profecto non ba^eremus aliquid aliud ^om sub Coelo: excepta hac tam

noone-tide of the Gospel! And therefore musts needs provoke God mightily, and
hasten the remooving of our candlestick. And in the mean time, besides many
more, and that dreadful doom at last. 2. These. 1.7.8. it brings upon most,
(more is the pity and shame, especially so glorious beams of a blessed
ministry shining about us) these two special mischeifes; which at this time I
only mention, because they serve fitliest for illustration of the point.
First, ignorant people sticking fast in his clutches, stand all, as they say,
at the Devils mercy, and devotion, to do with them what he will; even as a
poor helpeles Lamb in the bloody paw of a Lion, or asilly Wren in the
ravenous claw of a Kite; to slash and mangle their woeful souls at his
pleasure, with a cursed variety of Per ignorantiae malum a nescientibus
innumerabilia perpetrantur mala. Aug. Tom. 7. page 2. lib. 6. contra sulia.
Palag.
innumerable sins; they, in the mean time, which is the perfection of their
misery, neither fearing or feeling any hurt at al, by reason of the hellish
mists, and miserable lethargy of spiritual blindness, which makes them
sightlesse, and senseless. Secondly, when times of sorrow come upon them, when
melancholy and old age grows on, and they say unto the world, upon which they
have doted all their life long, I have no pleasure in thee; when losses,
crosses, and heavy accidents befall them; when hideous injections, temptations
to selfe-murder, despair etc. press them full sore; and they thereupon begin
to cast about seriously, and to conceive with great terror and anxiety of
spirit, what is like to become of them in the other world: Then in such
extremity, and forced by necessity, they are wont to have recourse to Ministers
for ease and help; and alas! then we are at our wits end, as they say, and in
much perplexity how to deal, and what to do with them. For upon the first
entrance into a discovery of their spiritual state, we see evidently with
grief of heart, that their Those that have no mind at all to hear, or read
the Word, if at any time through the remorse of their conscience which accuses
them, they feel any inward grief, sorrow or heaviness for their sins, for so
much as they want the salve and comfort of Gods Word, which they do despise,
it will be unto them rather a mean to bring them to utter desperation, then
otherwise. Hom. of Repentance, page 2.
ignorance has betrayed them to the Devil, and now in the evil day exposed
them to his merciless cruelty and cunning; even as if a man should commit a
ship without sails, rudder, pilot, etc. to the rage, and roaring of the
tempestuous devouring sea; or put a poor weak naked man into the field
against an implacable mighty adversary, completely armed from top to toe. We
tell them truly, that the true way to comfort, is to Repent and Believe. But
for the first, by reason of the sottish disacquaintance with themselves, with
their miserable, sinful natural state, and their gross ignorance in the Law
and Word of God, they only cry out in the general, they are very grievous
sinners; but to descend to any competent examination of the conscience, search
of their souls by the sight of the law, particular survay of their sins, and
so to special repentance, because, of their spiritual blindness, they are
utterly unable. Nay many in this case are so destitute of matter of humiliation
for sin, that they can scarce tell you what sin is. At the most, they have
not learned, or think that there is any other breach of the seventh
commandment, but the gross acts of uncleanness; that there is any sin
against the ninth, but giving in false witness against their neighbors in open
Court: They look no further into the sixth commandment, but unto the actual
bloody murder of the hand; into the third, but to blasphemy and swearing; And
so proportionably in the other commandments. For the other also, although they
have heard much of Jesus Christ, and if he be talked of, pretend a very
foolish and false presumption of having part in him; yet to the knowledge of
his person, offices, excellency, sweetness, effectual ministry, and of his
whole mystery, they are mere strangers. And so, when they should now upon
this occasion of trouble of mind, be brought by knowledge and application of
the Law and Gospel, through the pangs of the new birth into the holy Path,
they are to begin to learn the very first principles of religion; in How
wisely, graciously, and necessarily then did King James direct, for profitable
catecheticall teaching in the afternoon upon the Lords Day, in all*

directions from abating, that his Majesty dot^ expect at our hands, that it
should increase the number of Sermons, by renewing upon every Sunday in the
ater-noone in all Parish-Churches throughout the Kingdom, that primitive and
most profitable exposition of the Catechism, wherewith the people, yea, very
children may be timely seasoned, and instructed in all the heads of Christian
Religion: The which kind of teaching to our amendment be it spoken, is more
diligently observed in all the Reformed Churches of Europe, then of late it
has been here in England. I find his Majesty much moved with this neglect, and
resolved, if we that are his Bishops, do not see a reformation hereof, which

which they have not so much skill ( I speak a reproachful thing) as I could
teach a child of five, or six years old in few days. Now when the old red
Dragon has drawn them into the Lists, armed with all the power and policy of
hell, and furnished with all his fiery darts, they are so far from ability to
put on, and manage the whole spiritual armor with dexterity, and wisdom,
that they are stark Idiots and Infants, in the very speculative knowledge of
the nature and use of every piece thereof. They have no skill at all at that
excellent, invincible weapon, the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of
God: by which Jesus Christ foiled that foul Fiend in the most hideous and
horrible Cast thy self down; Destroy thy self. Mat. 4.6. Fall down and

temptations, that were ever suggested to the mind of man. And therefore he
does bring them too often thus blindfolded and baffled, to perish themselves,
as they say, in a most bloody and desperat^ manner, both temporally, and
eternally.

The Pharisees, Papists, and our ordinary Ignorants, are all foully faulty this
way. They love, and labor to enquire, and look no further into Gods Law, then
to the gross acts, and greatest transgressions only. If they find themselves
free from these, they out of a most absurd, and sottish selfe-conceitednesse,
justify and applaud themselves, as no such dangerous and damnable Delinquents.
Hence it was, that Christ teaches, and tells the Pharisees, that not only the
gross act of adultery was to be taken notice of, but also, that even a I am
mo^ chatus est eam incorde suo] hoc est dicere: Qui dat operam in venusta
corpora curiosius intueri, and decoras aucupari facies, talique animam

Chrysostom. in Matthew. 5. Hom. 17.
lascivious, and lustful look after a woman, was a transgression of that Law;
and to be taken to heart as adultery before God. That not only killing a man
with a bloody hand, but also rash anger in the heart, railing, and reviling
speeches; Nay, even a frowning face, a contemptuous gesture, discovering inward
rancour and rage, kill the soul, and cast into hell, etc.

Hence it was, that Bellarmine, as the grand Impostor, and Impoisoner, so the
great Pharisie of Christendom, upon his bed of death, could hardly find what
to confess, or any matter of absolution. Prodigious Pharisaisme! Of which,
hear some passages from the reporter of his death:

Bellarmines Death, by C.I. a Jesuit, p. 343.
Such was the innocence of the man, (to wit, Bellarmine) that albeit he was in
his perfect sense, yet could he hardly find what to confess; Insomuch as his
ghostly Father was in some perplexity, as wanting matter of absolution; till by
recourse to his life past, he found some small defects, of which he absolved
him.

Now nothing troubles my conscience. For God (his goodness be still Not much
unlike the Pharisie, Luke 18. God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers.
thanked therefore) has so preserved me hitherto, as I do not remember in
the whole course of my life, ever to have committed any scandalous action; Page

amongst the rest, he let fall also this speech: For my self, I shall think
it no small favor to be sure of Purgatory, and there to remain a good while
in those flames that must purge, and cleanse the spots of mine offenses, and
satisfy the just wrath and justice of Almighty God. page 372. I know very well
what Bellarmine concludes de Purgatorio, lib. 2. cap. 2. sect. ult.
purgatorium pro ijs tantum esse: Qui cum venialibus culpis moriuntur. Et rursum
pro illis, qui decedunt cum reatu poenae, culpis jam remissis. But yet since the
Pontificians teach; that venial sins may be taken away in this life; by
knocking the breast, by the Bishops blessing, by only entering into an hallowed
Church, by being sprinkled with holy water: and by other such easy remedies.

holy was his life, not stained with mortal sin? How secure a conscience,
that had at his death no scruple; But for the exchange of one good work for
another etc. page 367. This holy man began his Prayers, He said the Pater
noster and Ave Maria: And he said distinctly the Psalm Miserere to the end:
And he said the Creed all through. As though mere saying did sanctify and
save. Resting upon opus operatum, the work wrought, is an horrible popish
imposture, empoysoning all their supposed religious services. When it ringeth
to the Ave Maria, says Ledesma, Christian doctrine, page 35. We may obtain
indulgence by saying, at the first Toll, Angelus Domini, etc. at the second
Toll, Ecce Ancilla Domini, etc. at the third Toll, Et verbum caro factum est,

learned men, I am extraordinarily amazed their strange infatuation, and ever
receive satisfaction from that, 2. These. 2. Because they received not the love
of the truth, that they might be saved. -- For this cause God shall send them

should have made such transcendent fools of themselves, by writing and
believing so sottishly, and ridiculously.

warned to say also the Creed, etc. said it all through, and with the end of the

last words were, vitam aeternam, Amen. page 387.

Hence it is, that carnal men are well enough content to hear the
Commandments read, and perhaps will be angry if at any time they be omitted:
Would you know the reason? They go along with the Minister, and applaud
themselves pharisaically all the while, saying secretly, and securely to their
own souls; We thank God, we are no image-worshippers, no murderers, no
adulterers, etc. And so depart home from time to time, as highly conceited of
themselves, and yet more damnably deceived, then that Pharisie, Luke 18.11.12.
Of whose outward, For he fasted, prayed, gave alms, Matthew. 6. and tithes of
all that he possessed, which even formal services, would seem to our
ignorant Iusticiaries, too much forwardnes,
religious, charitable, and righteous performances, they come far short. But
they cannot possibly with any patience, endure a particular unfolding, and
powerful application of Gods Law after Christ's manner, Matthew. 5. a punctual
survay of their sinful states, and special search into their lives and
hearts. This cutting, yet conscionable course, stirs up, and raises in them
the ill spirits of murmuring, cavilling, reviling, and perhaps persecuting the
faithful Messengers of God, as a generation of terrible Teachers. To
expositions, exercises, and considerations of this nature, they are drawn with
very ill will, and much ado; even as a bankrout to his counting-booke, a foul
face to the looking-glass, and a Traitor to the rack.

By reason of this affected ignorance in the Law of God, and lothnesse to
descend to particulars, it comes to pass, that many in trouble of mind
complain in general of sin only, and confusedly. And thereupon, as though
they were competently cast down, expect comfort; and perhaps many draw it from
some Dawbers: Whereas particularizing of our sins, is a necesary precedent,
and preparative to a sound humiliation.

And therefore in this case we must deal with such, as Surgeons are wont to
do with a tumor, or swelling in the body: Who first apply to the affected
place drawing, and ripening plasters to bring the sore to an head, that the
corruption may have issue, and then heal: So a general complaint of sin,
and confused grief, must be reduced to particulars. It is a principle in the
mystery of Christ resolved upon by best Divines, rightly instructed to the
Kingdom of Heaven: That a confused acknowledgement, and general repentance
only for known sins is never sound and saving; But only common, formal,
perfunctory, and that of counterfeite Converts, not truly touched with sense of
their sins, nor heartily resolved to forsake their pleasures. If they can be
first brought to the sight, sense, and acknowledgement of some one special
notorious sin, which has most reigned in their heart, life, o^ calling; and
be in some good measure illightened, convinced, and terrified about the
heinousness, and horrible guilt of it, it may be a good means by Gods
blessing, to bring in the rest. For ordinarily true repentance is first
occasioned by some one special sin laid to heart. The Apostles, Act. 2. do
specially press the murder of Christ upon the Jews. Christ himself adultery
upon the Woman of Samaria, Ioh. 4. Samuel, Idolatry upon the Israelites, 1.
Sam. 7. The sin of asking a King, chap. 12. Ezra, taking strange wives: Ezra
10. Nehemiah, usury: chap. 5. etc.

To further the work of a more particular setting their sins in order before
their eyes; it were much to be wished, and a very happy thing, if all the
wounded consciences, and troubled in mind we meet with, were furnished
beforehand, with a competent speculative knowledge, at the least of the
particulars in Gods Law, exorbitant passages of their life, and gross
corruptions of their hearts. We might so, by Gods help, more easily bring
them to particular remorse, and fit them sooner, and more seasonably for
comfort. We find a most hard, and right heavy task, to encounter the Devils
devises, wiles and depths, in a poor, distressed, tempted Ignorant.

4. When the party is dejected for some notorious sin only. It is I knew a
man a mere stranger to Jesus Christ, both in knowledge and practice; and yet
not visibly notorious. Who pleasing himself many years that he was not noted
to be extraordinarily naught, upon a time was suddenly set upon by some
drunken companions, and made drunk. Whereupon in cold blood he took on
extremely, and was very much grieved. As evidently appeared by his not sleeping
many nights together, and by the troublednesse of his countenance. He came to
a Minister, cried out against himself, and those who ensnared him: that after
so many years sobriety, he should be so shamefully overtaken, etc. He was
counseled upon this occasion to make a full and further search into his heart
and life, and so proceed to a sound, and saving repentance, etc. But the
ground of his grief being specially shame of his fact amongst his neighbour^,
after the nine nights wonder of his being drunk was over, He was, where he
was before. Now had the Minister ministered comfort hand over head at the first
sight, and drawn over a skin, without any further search; tho the man might
be undone both ways; yet by so doing, He should have been justly liable to
that fearful woe denou^^ed against them, who strengthen the hands of the
wicked, that He should not return from His wicked way, by promising Him life.
But dealing faithfully, He delivered His own Soul.
sometimes seen in mere civell men, that having a long time preserved their
reputations entire and unstained, in the eye of the world, from gross and
notable enormities; and yet after foulely shaming themselves in the sight of
men by some infamous fall, seem to take on much, as tho they were truly
troubled with the remorse; whereas perhaps the present hearts-griefe arises
rather from loss of credit, then wound of conscience (tho to favor their
credit, they cunningly father it upon conscience). Or let them be indeed
affrighted very grievously for a time with the horror of that one sin; yet
stay the cry, and abate the rage of that One with some superficial comfort,
and they are healed, and put into an happy case in their own conceit, and in
the opinion also perhaps of their unskilful Physician; tho they search no
further, and dive no deeper into the loathsome Dunghill of those many
abominable lusts, and corruptions in their heart and life, of which they are as
full as the skin will hold.

Now it is a foul and fearful oversight in a Minister; nay, it may prove
an error stained with spiritual bloodshed, to promise pardon to such partial
Penitents.

Suppose a man sick of a Plurisie, should send to a Physician, and tell Him,
He is sore troubled with a Cough, and entreat His help, concealing other
Morbilateralis nota sunt, dolor punctorius, difficilis spiratio, febris
continua, tussis, pulsus serratilis. Piso de Morb. Cogn. and Cur. lib. 2 cap 7.
signs and symptoms, which ordinarily accompany that disease; as His short
and difficult breathing, the stinging stitch in His side, etc. The Physician
may address Himself to cure the Cough, and yet the Patient die of an
inflammation seized upon the membrane girding the ribs and side. It is
proportionably so in the present Point. A man may complain, and cry out, houle
and take on extremely for some one horrible heinous sin, and that may be
well; but except he proceed to a further discovery, and sorrow proportionable
for his other known sins, they will be the destruction, and death of His
Soul. If a dozen Thieves be entered into thy house, it is not enough for Thee
to lay hold on the Captain Thief only, and thrust Him out at doors: If Thou
suffer but one of them to lurk in any corner undiscovered, and not turned out,
He will serve the turn to cut thy throat, and take away thy treasure. Crying
out of one capital sin only is not sufficient: we must confess and
forsake Indefinita Propositio valet universalem in materia necessaria. Paulus
ab Eitzen. lib. 2. page 116.
all, if we look to find mercy: Prou. 28.13.

And yet here I would have no true Penitent dejected, or mistake: the bare
omission of some particular sins, in this case is not ever damnable. For we
must know, that if a man deal truly with his own heart in a sincere
acknowledgement, confession, and repentance for discovered and known sins;
(and He ought to labor, by clearing the eye of natural conscience, and
industrious inspection into Gods pure Law, to know as many as may be) and for
all those that come into His mind, when He sets himself apart, solemnly to
humble and afflict His Soul before God; (and He ought to remember as many as
He can possibly) I say, if so, then for secret and unknown sins, which are
committed in weakness and ignorance, the Lord accepts a general
confession, as we see in David's practice, Psalm. 19.12. Who can understand His
errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Sins there are many, and that
in the best men, which are not only unnoted of others, and free from the
worlds observation, but even unknown to a man's own self, and invisible to
the watchfullest eye of the most waking conscience; which notwithstanding are
clearly subject to the search of Gods All-seeing eye, and to the censure of
His pure Majesty: For Hell and destruction are before the Lord, how much more
the secretest ways of the sons of men? Sins there are also, which even in
the zealous exercise, and holy work of Repentance, may not come into the
consideration and remembrance of one truly Penitent; which if He could recover
into his memory, He would heartily, and with much indignation acknowledge,
bewail and detest: So un-numbred are the cursed bypath of men's crooked
ways. But for both these sorts of sins, I must say thus much for the comfort
of the true Convert; that both those unknown sins which He commits of
ignorance, if He truly repent for all His known sins, and labor with
sincerity and zeal for further illumination of conscience, and fuller
revelation of every corrupt Passage both in heart and life, in judgment and
practice; and those sins of knowledge also, which came not into his mind, if
with diligence, and without dissimulation, with hearty prayer, and best
intention of spirit, He endeavor to recover them into His memory, that He
might also mourn for, and mortify them with the rest; carrying ever in His
heart this resolution, that as any sin shall be discovered to His
conscience, or return into His mind, He will abominate and abandon it; I say,
both these kinds of sins (it is a Pearl for the true Penitent, let no
stranger meddle with it) to such an one, upon such conditions are most
certainly washed away by Christ's blood, and Gods free mercy, upon His general
confession and repentance. David's Petition, O cleanse thou me from my secret
faults, did assuredly prevail with God for the forgiveness of all His
unknown sins, and shall be powerful for that end, to the worlds end, to
all those that so pray, with David's spirit and sincerely.

Besides these two cases; first, want of knowledge; and secondly, want of
remembrance in the sense I have said: There is also a third, and that is,
thirdly, want of time: which if truly so, does also sometimes excuse the
omission of some particular sins. As we may see in the Thief upon the
Cross. For want of leisure, He could not possibly punctually revise His vile
abominable life, nor peruse with remorse all the particulars of His former,
wicked, and abhorred courses. But He had infused into His Soul by Jesus Christ
an habitual Some think it only an action. But that Phrase, Zech. 12.10. Of
pouring the Spirit of grace (meaning Repentance) upon the House of David, and
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, seems to argue it to be a quality, or
infused gift, so as Faith and Charity are. So also that Phrase of giving
Repentance, Act. 5.31. and 11.18. For if God give it, we receive it. Now we
cannot properly be said to receive an action, which we do, but the power,
gift or grace, whereby we do it. That speech also, Matthew. 3.8. Bring forth
fruit meet for repentance, shows, that Repentance it self is not an outward
action, but an inward grace to be expressed in outward actions. Dike of
Repentance, cap. 1.
grace of true Repentance; which if He had lived, would have carried Him
faithfully along over all the notorious Passages of His lewd and loathsome life,
with a truly contrite, broken, and bleeding Soul. So that, if He had had
space, I doubt not, but He would have prooved a very eminent, extraordinary,
and exemplary Penitent. And therefore the Lord in mercy, did graciously It is
the inward and habitual Repentance, the inward frame, bent, and disposition of
the Soul that God respects more, then the outward Act; as we may see by that
of David, Psalm. 32.5. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord,
and so thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. The inward purpose and
disposition of David's heart to repent, was sufficient to moove God to forgive
His sin, before His outward, actual, and particular Repentance was expressed.

accept the desire and purpose, the inclination and preparation of His heart
that way.

But to return to the Point, and give my advise in the Case proposed:

Let the Party, who so takes on for some notorious sin only, and there takes up
His rest, be told; That tho He dwell with deepest sighs, heaviest heart and
saltest tears, upon some of His greatest and most special sins; yet the
rest must by no means be neglected. That which is most crying, and crimson,
must serve as a Crier, that I may so speak, to summon the rest into the Court
of Conscience, and as a Remembrancer to bring them to mind and remorse: As
David's murder and adultery brought even His Birth-sinne into His memory: Psalm.
51. And that sin of strange wives many other sins to Ezra's mind, Ezra 9.
When a father beats His child for some one special fault, He is wont to
remember unto Him, and reckon with Him for many former mis-demeanours also.
When a Bankrout is once clapped up for one principal debt, the rest of His
Creditours ordinarily come thick and threefold upon Him. When once Thou begins
to reckon with thy conscience for some one extraordinary rebellion, never cease
until thou have searched thoroughly, and ransackt it to the bottom, that it may
smart soundly, before Thou have done, with penitent anguish, and true remorse
for all thy other sinful corruptions also. When horror for some one heinous
sin has seized upon thy heart, follow Gods blessed hand leading thee to
conversion, and through the Pangs of the New Birth to unspeakeable and glorious
joy, by giving way to all the rest, to bring in their several inditements
against thy Soul. And be not afraid thus to arraigne, cast and condemn thy
Self as guilty of innumerable sins, and worthy ten thousand Hells, before
Gods just Tribunal. For then shall thou there most certainly find a gracious
Advocate at His right hand; To whom if Thou make suit, and seek in truth, He
will by the plea and price of His own precious blood, sue out a pardon for
thine everlasting peace. When the guilty rage of thy reigning corruption begins
to press upon thy conscience, lay on load, and more weight still by a
penitent addition, and painful apprehension of all thy other sins, that
growing very sensible of thy spiritual slavery, weary of the Dungeon of
lewdness and lust, sensuality and death, wherein the Devil has kept Thee
long; and thine heart being happily broken and bruised to the bottom, and
scorched, as it were, in some measure with Hellish flames of guilty horror; Id
quod primum omnium operatur in nobis sitim hanc, ac desiderium hoc gratiae, est
sensus peccati, ac miseriae nostrae. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 7. page 474.
Thou may see, and feel the greater necessity of Jesus Christ, set Him at an
higher price; with more eagerness and impatiency thirst for His
righteousness, and blood; long for spiritual enlargement, more then for
worlds of pleasures, glory, or wealth; relish the hidden Manna of the promises
most kindlily, and cast thy wounded and bleeding Soul with more delight and
sweetness, into His blessed arms of mercy and love. For, O how acceptable is
the Fountain of living waters, says a worthy Divine, to the chased Heart
panting, and braying? The blood of Christ to the weary and tired Soul? To the
thirsty conscience scorched with the sense of Gods wrath? He that presents Him
with it, How welcome is He? Even as a special choice man, One of a thousand.
The deeper is the sense of misery, the sweeter is the sense of mercy. The
Traitor laid down upon the block, is more sensible of His Sovereigns mercy
in pardoning, then He, who is not yet attached. -- In our dead security before
conversion, God is feign to let the Law, Sin, Conscience, Satan, a deep
sense of our abominable and cursed state loose upon us, and to kindle the very
The Lord will not part from any drop of His mercy to them, which f^^st have not
been swallowed up of His judgeme^ts, which have not labored, and been heavy
laden, which have not been locked up in Hell for a season, and felt for a time
the fire thereof in their bones, which have not been Baptized with the Baptism
of their own tears: He that feels not these things in some measure here,
elsewhere He shall feel them. Gr^^^^ham, page 2. cap. 32. Edis. 3.
fire of Hell in our souls, that so we might be rouzed, and afterward more
sweetly and soundly raised and refreshed. For after the most toylesome labor
is the sweetest sleep, after the greatest tempests the stillest calmes.
Sanctified troubles and terrors establish the surest peace. And the shaking of
these winds makes the trees of Gods Eden take the deeper ro^ting.

I confess, that commonly true Converts at the first touch, and turning, and
after too, cry out most of, and are extraordinarily troubled with some One
capital sin, and that which in their days of darkness and vanity, wasted
their conscience most, and detained them with strongest entisements, and
hold-fast in the Devils bondage. Hence it was, that Zacchaeus was so ready, and
willing to restore fourefold, that so He might be rid of the sting and
horror of His former reigning sin, Luke 19.8. That blessed Paul, as it
seems, amongst other dreadful apprehensions of His former unregenerate
courses, was so much vexed and wounded in heart, for that He had been a
Persecuter, 1. Timoth. 1.13. 1. Cor. 15.9. But yet should they take-on never so
much, houle and roar for that one sin; if besides, they did not by the
conduct of the blessed Spirit, descend also to a more particular
acknowledgement, confession and repentance of all other known sins, (and
they ought, by clearing the eye of natural conscience, industrious inspection
into the pure Cristall of Gods Law, discover as many as they can possibly) all
were nothing. He which is grieved, say Divines, for one sin truly, and
unfainedly from His heart, will proportionably be grieved for all the sins
that He knows to be in Himself. If we favor any one sin in our heart,
or life, or calling, we cannot enjoy Gods favor. If there be any sensual
lust, or secret corruption, which a man purposely labors to cover and conceal
from Gods pure eye, the search of His Word, and mortifying grace; what hope can
He have, that it is covered with the blood of Christ from the wrath that is to
come, or warranted by any promise of grace from the damnation of Hell? In a
true Penitent, there ought to be an utter cessation from all gross
abandonable sins, and at least dis-allowance, dis-affection, and all possible
opposition, even to un-avoidable infirmities, and inseparable frailties of the
flesh.

5. Fifthly, when the Physician of the Soul promises mercy and pardon hand
over head, without that spiritual discretion, which is convenient for a matter
of so great consequence, and requiring such a deal of dexterity in discerning,
to a man upon His Bed of death, who has formerly bin notorious, or only
civil, howsoever a mere stranger to the power of godliness, and the truth of
Profession, because now in the evil Day, He takes on extremely, by reason of
His extremity; cries out of his sins; O I am an heinous, horrible and grievous
sinner! If I were to live again, what would not I do? A World for comfort
now, and to die the death of the righteous: because He Howles upon His bed, as
the Prophet speaks, and breaks out oftentimes into a roaring complaint of
sin, and cry for pardon, by reason He now begins to fear and feel the
revenging hand of God ready to seize upon Him for his former rebellions, etc.
Or when He assures Him, having been a formal Professor only, and foolish
Virgin, of bliss and glory; because out of a former habituated spiritual
Selfe-deceite, He cries, Lord, Lord; seems to bystanders very confident,
that He shall presently receive a Crown of life, thanks God that nothing
troubles Him; Professes to every one that comes to visit Him, that He
believes and repents with all His heart, forgives all the world, makes no doubt
of Heaven, etc.

Here by the way, we must take notice, that many having out-stood the day of
their gracious visitation, having neglected so great salvation, forsaken their
own mercy, and judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life, all their life
long, by standing out against the Ministry of the Word, in respect of any
saving work upon their souls; and now at length being overtaken after the
short gleame of worldly prosperity, with the boisterous winter-night of death,
and darkness of the evil day, may keep a great stir upon their
dying-Beds, or in some great extremity, with grievous complaints of their
present intolerable misery, and former sinful courses procuring it, with
incessant cries for ease and deliverance, being now caught like wild Bulls in
a Not full of the wrath of God, with earnest and eager ^uing and seeking for
pardon and salvation, now when worldly pleasures are past; and yet be not
truly penitent, not soundly and savingly humbled, not rightly fitted for Christ
and comfort. Consider for this purpose, Prove. 1.24.28. In the day of
visitation, God called upon them, and stretched out His hands, but they
refused, did not regard; set at naught all His counsel, and would none of His
reproof: And therefore in the Day of vexation, when extremity and anguish
shall come upon them, like a Thief in the night, a whirle-winde, travail upon
a woman, suddenly, extremely, un-avoidably, He professes beforehand, that
then they shall call upon Him, but He will not answer; Hic refelluntur, qui
peccatorum veniam se consequnturos non dubitant modo unius horae quadrantem,
quo Deum invocent, nacti fuerint: Cum hoc in loco Deus se no^ ex audituru^

creature, when they are pinched, when they are in extremity, will they not cry,
will they not mourn for help, etc. Their cries in the evil Day were not
hearty prayers, but Howlings upon their Beds. Their earnestness in such a case
is ordinarily like the tears, prayers, and cries of a malefactor newly
condemned. He is very earnest with the Judge to spare Him. He roares out
sometimes, and takes on extremely, yet not heartily for his former lewdness,
but horribly, because He must now loose His life. He seems now, when He
sees His misery to relent, and to be touched with remorse, but it is only
because he is like to be hanged. Again, many there are, who satisfying
themselves and others, with a goodly show of a Form only of godliness, may
upon their last Bed discover, and represent to Bystanders, a great deal of
fearelesnesse about their spiritual state, much O quam multi, says a reverend
Father, cum hac spe ad aeternos labores and bella descendunt!
confidence, many ostentations of Faith, and full assurance, and behave
themselves, as tho they were most certainly going to everlasting bliss, when
as, God knows, their Answer at His just Tribunal must be, I know you not:
And in truth and trial, they have no more part in Christ, nor other portion in
Heaven, then the foolish Virgins, and those, Luke 13.26.27. They are so
confident, not because they have escaped the danger, but because they never saw
the danger. And hence it is, that many of them die with as much confidence, as
the best Christians; they have no more trouble then holy men. To be sure I am
free from danger, and not to know it, may beget equal confidence.

Now concerning the present Case, I must tell you, that for my part, I would
not much alter my censure and conceit of a Man's spiritual state, whom I have
thoroughly known before for the manner of His death. The end of Gods dearest
servant, after an holy life and unblame-able conversation, may not appear in
the eye of man so calm and comfortable, as was expected; by reason of much
tenderness of conscience, some strong temptation, spiritual desertion,
violent distemper of Body; or because God would have the manner of His death
serve the glory of His justice, in hardening those about him, who were so far
from being won by His godly life, that they heartily hated it; or for some
other secret and sacred end seen, and seeming good to Divine wisdom, who
ever disposes every circumstance, even of the least affair most sweetly and
wisely. And yet this, as it does not prejudice His salvation, neither should it
His Christian reputation. Hear that great Greeneham in His grave Counsel and
godly Observation, Page 9.
Doctor in the Art of rightly comforting afflicted consciences. But what if you
should die in this discomfort? For my part (as I my self look for no great
things in my death) I would not think more hardly of you; neither would I wish
any to judge otherwise of Gods Child in that state of death: For we shall not
be judged according to that particular instant of death, but according to our
general course of life; not according to our deed in that present, but
according to the desire of our hearts ever before: And therefore we are not to
mistrust Gods mercy in death, be we never so uncomfortable, if so be it has
been before sealed in our vocation and sanctification. Non potest male mori,
qui been vixerit. Prorsus consirmo, audeo dicere, credidi propter quod loquutus
sum: Non potest male mori, qui been vixerit. August. lib. de Disciplina Christ.
cap. 2.
On the otherside, a notorious wretch which has swumme down the current of
the times, and wallowed in worldly pleasures all his life long, may seem to
die penitently and resoluedly to be reformed, if He recover; and yet His
sorrow of mind, but such only as the terrors of an awaked guilty conscience
produce; and His resolution to cast away His sins, only such, as a man has
in a storm to cast away His goods, not because he does not love them, but
because he fears to loose his life, if he part not with them. Or a mere
civil Man, or formal Professor, may upon His Bed of death be very
confident, and seem to be full of comfort; and yet that confidence no other,
then the strong imaginary joyful conceit of a covetous man grasping a great
deal of gold in his dream, but when He awaketh, behold, his hands are empty.

For a more full and clear apprehension of my meaning and judgment in the
Point, let us take a survay of the different and several kinds of death, which
ordinarily befall the Godly, and the wicked.

The death of Gods Children are diverse.

1. Some of their holy and zealous lives do determine and expire sweetly,
fairly, and gloriously, even like a clear Sun in a Summers evening, without
any storm, or cloud of temptation and discomfort. The darkesome and painful
passages and pangs of death are illightened, and sweetened with the shining
beams of Gods glorious presence, and fast embracement of Jesus Christ in the
arms of their Faith. So that to them, the very joys of Heaven, and
exultations of everlasting rest mingle themselves, with those last agonies, and
expirations of death. Their heads are, as it were, crowned with immortality,
and endless peace upon their beds of death. Luther, that blessed Man of God,
died sweetly Decimo septimo Februarij die, Lutherus coepit aegrotare gravitis
ex pectore: and quanquam erat imbecillior, prandit tamen cum filijs, and
familiaribus su^^, atque coenavit. Inter coenandum argumentis asseruit sore, ut
in altera vita illa beata alter alierum recognoscat. Post caenam sumpto

Deus omnis consolationis, ago tibi gratias, quod filium tuum Iesum Christum

quem Pontifex Romanus, and reliqua impiorum turba persequitur; and afficit
contumelia: Rogo te, mi Domine Jesus Christ, suscipe animulam meam. Mi Pater

My heavenly Father, (said He at his death) eternal and merciful God, thou
have manifested unto me thy dear Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. I have taught
him, I have known him, I love him as my life, my health, and my redemption:
whom the wicked have persec^^ed, maligned, and with injury afflicted. Draw my
Soul to Thee. After this, He said as insued thrice. I commend my spirit into
thine hands, thou have redeemed me, O God of truth. God so loved the world,
that he gave his only Son, that all that believe in Him should have life
everlasting. Ioh. 3. Hear how another blessed Master John Holland, a faithful
Minister of Gods Word,
Saint of God ended his days: Having the day before he died continued his
meditation and exposition upon Romans 8. for the space of two hours, or more, on
the sudden He said; O stay your reading! What brightness is this I see? Have
you light up any candles? To which I answered, No; It is the Sunshine, for it
was about five a clock in a clear Summers evening. Sunshine, says He, nay,
my Saviour-shine. Now farewell world, welcome heaven; The Day Star from on
high has visited my heart. O speak it when I am gone, and preach it at my
Funeral, God deals familiarly with man. I feel his mercy, I see his
Majesty; whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God he
knows; but I see things that are un-utterable. So, ravished in spirit, He
roamed toward heaven, with a cheerful look, and soft sweet voice, but what
He said, we could not conceive. -- With the Sun in the morning following,
raising himself, as Jacob did upon his staff, he shut up his blessed life,
with these blessed words: O what an happy change shall I make? From night to
day? From darkness to light? From death to life? From sorrow to solace? From
a factious world to an heavenly being? O my dear brethren, sisters, and
friends! It pittieth me to leave you behind: yet remember my death when I am
gone, and what I now feel, I hope you shall find, ere you die, that God does,
and will deal familiarly with men. And now thou fiery Chariot, that came down
to feth up Eliah, carry me to my happy Hold: And all ye blessed Angels, who
attended the Soul of Lazarus, to bring it up to heaven, bear me, O bear me
into the bosom of my Best beloved. Amen, Amen, come Lord Jesus, come quickly.
And so he fell asleep. That this is true, the In His Sermon entitled, The
Souls Solace against sorrow, page 17. etc.
reporter and By-stander, that ancient learned reverend Minister of God, Master
Leygh adds: I say the truth, my Brethren, I lie not, my conscience bearing
me witness in the holy Ghost, etc.

2. Others may end their days very uncomfortably in ravings, impatiencies, and
other strange behaviors. Nay, the fiery distempers of their hot diseases, may
sometimes, even in the Saints of God, produce furlous carriages, fearful
distractions, and some despairefull speeches. But these being the natural
effects and issues of melancholic excesses, Phrensies, and burning Fevers, are
sins of infirmity in sanctified men. For which, if they come again to
themselves, they actually repent; if not, they are all undoubtedly, by a
general habitual repentance, and Gods gracious acceptance thereof, pardoned
by the Passion of Christ, and buried for ever in his bloody death. That last
and unreversable doom, at the dreadful Tribunal of the ever-living God must
pass upon us; not according to the violent, and unvoluntary distempers at our
last hour, but according to the former Passages of our life; the sinful, or
sanctified expense of the days of health. Hear that other Perkins in his
Salve for a sick Man.
great Artist in the Mystery of dealing with trouble consciences. The common
opinion is, that if a man die quietly, and go away like a Lamb, (which in
some diseases, as consumptions, and such like, any Man may do) then he goes
straight to heaven: but if the violence of the disease stir up impatience,
and cause frantic behaviors, then men use to say, there is a judgment of
God serving either to discover an Hypocrite, or to plague a wicked man. But the
truth is otherwise: For indeed a man may die like a lamb, and yet go to
Hell: and one dying in exceeding torments, and strange behauiours of the body,
may go to heaven.

3. The death of some others is mixed, to wit, of fearful tempestuous storms,
and almost, if not altogether, despairefull agonies, in the beginning of their
last sickness, and a fair refreshing glorious calm, and joyful triumphs
over temptations, and fear, toward the conclusion of their life. For some
secret end and holy purpose seeming good to his heavenly wisdom, God suffers
sometimes even his dearest servants, to taste, as it were, of the fire of Hell,
and for a while to feel in their consciences, those damned flames, as a
preparative to drink more sweetly of the Well of life, and Rivers of endless
pleasures. So himself is most honored, by helping when all hope is past: The
heart of his Child more ravished with the first sight of those un-utterable
joys, being suddenly raised to the height of happiness, from the depth of
horror: The enemies to the narrow way dashed and confounded, by observing his
deliverance, whom, out of profane blindness, they deemed an Hypocrite: Godly
Christians graciously revived, when they see, That tho the Lord hide His face
from his Child for a moment, yet at last with everlasting kindness will He
have mercy on Him. And that He will never utterly, and finally forsake any of
His. Thus died those blessed Servants of God, Mistress Bretergh, Master Peacock,
etc. Mistress Bretergh in the heat of temptation, wished that she had never bin
borne, or that she had bin made any other creature, rather then a woman: But
when that Hellish storm was over-blowne by the return of the glorious beams
of the Sun of righteousness into Her Soul; She turned her tune, and triumphed
thus: Oh happy am I, that ever I was borne, to see this blessed Day! I confess
before the Lord his loving kindness, and his wonderful works before the sons
of men: For he has satisfied my Soul, and filled my hungry Soul with
goodness.

Master Peacocke in the height of His dreadful Desertion, told those about
Him, that he converst with Hell-^ounds; That the Lord had cursed him; That He
had no grace: That it was against the course of Gods proceeding, to save Him,
etc. But when that horrible tempest of spiritual terrors was happily
dispersed; and the light of Gods comfortable countenance begun to shine again
upon His most heavy and afflicted spirit; He dis-avowed all inconsiderate
speeches, as he called them, in his temptation, and did humbly and heartily
ask mercy of God for them all; And did thus triumph: What should I extol the
magnificence of God, which is unspeakeable, and more then any heart can
conceive? Nay rather let us with humble reverence acknowledge His great mercy.
What great cause have I to magnify the great goodness of God, that has
humbled, Nay rather exalted such a wretched miscreant, of so base condition to
an estate so glorious and stately! The Lord has honored me with his
goodness: I am sure, he has provided a glorious Kingdom for me: The joy
which I feel in my heart is uncredible.

4. Some of Gods worthiest Champions, and most zealous servants do not answer
the unreprooveable sanctity of their life, and unspotted current of their
former conversation, with those proportionable extraordinary comforts, and
glorious Passages upon their beds of death, which in ordinary congruity might
be expected, as a convenient conclusion to the rare and remarkable Christian
cariages of such blessed Saints. So bottomless and infinitely un-fathomable by
the utmost of all created understandings are the depths of Gods most holy
ways, and His inscrutable Counsels, quite contrary many times to the probable
conclusions of Man's best wisdom. But every one of His, since he certainly
passes through those pangs into pleasures and joys endless and unspeakeable,
must be content to glorify God, and to be serviceable to His secret ends, with
what kind of death He please: whether it be glorious and untempted: or
discomfortable, because of Bodily distempers, and consequently interpretable by
undiscerning spirits: or mingled of temptations, and Triumphs: or ordinary, and
without any great show, or remarkable speeches, after extraordinary
singularities of an holy life, which promised an end of special note, and
admiration.

Why may not some worthy heavenly-minded Christians sometimes by strong
mortifying meditations, and many conquering fore-conceits of death in their
life time, make it beforehand so familiar and easy unto them, an by
continual conversing above, and constant peace of conscience, taste so deeply
of spiritual joys, that that dreadful Passage out of this life, as it may
breed no great sense of alteration in themselves, so no extraordinary matter
of special observation to others.

Of the wicked, and those, who were ever strangers to the mystery of Christ and
truth of godliness:

Some die desperately. Tho thousands perish by Of one Reprobate that dies in
this despair and torment of conscience, there be millions that dye in
presumption of mercy, without sense of sin, or punishment: The reason whereof
is, because Satan, who knows He has time little enough in this life to draw
men to sin, and long enough after this life to torment them for it, does
therefore ordinarily reserve the tormenting of sinners to the Day of judgment,
and till they be in Hell; left if He should deal so roughly with all sinners
in this world, they might, being so pincht with terrors, seek after the
means of salvation, as did the Iaylo^r, and the ^ewes. Act. 16.30, and 2.37.
etc. Chibald. Trial of Faith, lib. 1. cap. 5. p. 70.
presumption, to One of these who despair; yet some there are, to whom upon
their beds of death all their sins are set in order before them, and
represented to the eye of their awaked consciences in such griesly forms and
so terribly, that at the very first and fearful sight, they are presently
struck stark dead in soul and spirit, utterly overwhelmed and quite
swallowed up with guilty and desperate horror. So that afterward, No counsel,
or comfort; no consideration of the immeasurablenesse of Gods mercy, of the
unvaluablenesse and omnipotency, that I may so speak, of Christ's blood shed, of
the variety and excellency of gracious promises, of the loss of their own
immortal souls, can possibly drive and divert from that infinitely We should
never be in such a forlorn condition, wherein there should be ground of
despair, considering our sins be the sins of Man, His mercy the mercy of
an infinite God. Doctor Sibbes, Bruised Reed, Preface to the Reader.
false conceit, and cursed Cry; My sins are greater, then can be pardoned.
Whereupon most miserable, and forlorn wretches, they very wickedly, and
wilfully throw themselves into Hell, as it were, upon earth, and are damned
above ground. Thus the Lord sometimes for the terror of others, glorifying his
own justice, and bringing exemplary confusion upon impenitent obstinacy in
sin, and wilful opposition to grace, does in greatest indignation by the
hand of divine vengeance, unclaspe unto them, the Book of their own
Conscience, and of His own holy Law. In one of which they find, now at length,
all their innumerable iniquities, transgressions and sins engraven with the
Point of a diamond, enraged with Gods implacable wrath, aggravated with the
utmost malice of Satan; And never to be razed out, or remitted, but by the
blood of the Son of God, in which they peremptorily profess themselves to have
no part. In the other, they see the fiercenes, and fullness of all the curses,
plagues and torments denounced there, and due unto all impenitent sinners,
ready to be poured upon their bodies and souls for ever; And no possibility
to prevent them, no ways to decline them, but by Gods infinite bounty through
Jesus Christ, in which they also utterly disclaim all right and interest. And
therefore they are now finally, and desperately resolved to look for no mercy:
But in their own judgment, and by their own confession* stand reprobates
from Gods covenant, and void of all hope of His inheritance, expecting with
unspeakeable terror and amazement of spirit, the consummation of their
misery, and fearful sentence of eternal damnation. They are commonly such,
Out of the cursed Nurcery of such sorts of sinners as these, God does now and
then single out some, and hang them up as it were in chains, as woeful
Spectacles of despai^e, for warning to others.
as have been gross Hypocrites like Judas, and lien in some secret abomination
against the knowledge of their hearts, all their life long; that have followed
still their own sensual ways, and course of the world against the light of
the Ministry, standing like an armed man in their consciences to the contrary;
who have been Scorners and Persecutours of the power of godliness, and the
good way; who have abjured the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and forsaken the Truth
for honor, wealth, or worldly happiness: To whom the Lord in their lifetime
vouchsafed many mercies, much prosperity, great means of salvation, long
forbearance, etc. And yet they stood out still they still hated to be
reformed, set as naught all His counsel, and would (...) of His ^^ proof.
Wherefore the Day of gracious visitation being once expired, a thousand
Worlds* will not purchase it again; Heaven and Earth cannot recall it. No
mercy, no comfort, no blessing can then be had, tho they seek it with tears
and yelling. They shall never more be heard, tho with much violence they throw
their serikings into the Air and cry with sighs and groans, as piercing as a
sword. Not, but that the Gates of Heaven, and arms of mercy may stand wide
open, until their last breath: But alas! They have already so hardened their
hearts, that they cannot repent. After thine hardness, Romans 2.5.
says Paul, and heart, that cannot repent. They now but howl upon their Beds,
they do not cry unto God with their heart; as the Prophet speaks, Hos. 7.14.
Their earnest and early crying in this last extremity, is only because* Their
fear is come upon them as desolution, and their destruction as a whirlewinde.
When they cast out their considerations for comfort. It is not the whole
Creation can possibly help them; for they must stand or fall to the Tribunal
of the everlasting God, mighty and terrible, the Creator of the ends of the
Earth. If they look up to God the Father; that Prove. 1.24.26. comes presently
into their heads with much horror, and quite kills their hearts: Because He
has called all our life long, and all that goodly time we refused; He will
laugh now at our calamity, and mock when our fear is come. Jesus Christ, as
they strongly conceive, and un-mooveably conclude against themselves, has now
to them for ever closed up His wounds as it were, and will not afford them one
drop of His blood; because they have so often, by coming unworthily, spilt it
in the Sacrament, persecuted Him in His members, and despised Him in the
Ministry. The blessed Spirit, because in the Day of visitation they repelled
all his inward warnings and holy motions, preferring Satan's impure suggestions,
before His sacred inspirations, does now in their own acknowledgement, by the
equity of a just proportion, in this Day of vexation, leave them to eat the
fruit of their former wilfulness, and reap the reward of their own ways.
Thus these forlorn wretches are disclaimed, forsaken, and abandoned of Heaven
and Earth, God and Man; of all the comforts in this life, and blessings of the
World to come. And so by final despairing of Gods mercy, the In what sense
despair is the greatest sin: for it is not simply so. Ever the more
excellent the virtue is* the more pestilent is the opposite vice. Hatred of God
in it self is a greater sin then desperation; because the Love of God is a
more excellent grace then Hope. See 2^. q. 2. art. 3. Though Aqu^n^^ His Sums

greatest of sins, they most unhappily, and cursedly follow Judas the worst
of men, into the darkest and most damned nooke in Hell.

2. Others die senselesly and blockishly. They demean themselves, upon their
dying Beds, as tho there were no immortality of the Soul, no Tribunal above,
no strict account to be given up there for all things done in the flesh, no
everlasting estate in the world to come; wherein every one must either lie in
unspeakeable pains, or live in un-utterable pleasures. In their life time,
they were never wont to tremble at Gods judgments, or rejoice in his promises,
or much trouble themselves with the ministry of the Word, or about the state of
their souls. All was one to them, what Minister they had, whether a Man taught
to the kingdom of Christ, or a general Teacher, or an ignorant Mangler of the
word, or a dissolute fellow, or a Dawber with untempered mortar, or a dumb
Dog. If they were neither Whores nor Thieves, but well accounted of amongst
their neighbors, thriued in the world, prospered in their outward state,
provided for posterity, slept in a whole skin, were not vexed on the Lords
day with any of these precise Trouble-townes: They were well enough, and had
all they looked for, either in this world, or in the world to come. Wherefore
at their death by reason of their former disacquaintance with spiritual
things, and God not opening their eyes, they are neither afflicted with any
fear of Hell; or affected with any hope of Heaven; they are both
un-apprehensive of their present danger, and fearelesse of the fiery lake, into
which they are ready to fall. In these regards, they are utterly untouched, die
most quietly, and without any trouble at all. And it is their ordinary Answer,
when they are questioned about their spiritual state, and How it stands with
them between God and their own Consciences; I thank God nothing troubles me.
Which, tho they think it makes much for their own credit, yet alas! It is
small comfort to judicious Bystanders, and such as wish well to their Souls;
But rather a fearful confirmation, that they are finally given over to the
spirit of slumber, and sealed up by divine Indeed sometimes, and most commonly
conscience in many is secure at the time of death. God in his justice plaguing
an affected security in this life, with an inflicted security at death. And the
Lord seems to say, as once to the Prophet; Go, make their consciences asleep
at their death, as they have made it asleep all their life, lest conscience
should see and speak, and they hear and be saved. -- Therefore they die, tho
not desperate as Saul and Ahitophel; yet sottishly without comfort and feeling
of Gods love; as Na^al. Dyke of Conscience, cap. 12.
justice, in the sottishness and security of their own senseless hearts, for
most deserved condemnation. Thus these men, as One speaks, live like stocks,
and die like blocks. And yet the ignorant people, says Greeneham, will still
commend such fearful deaths, saying, He departed as meekely, as a Lamb, He
went away as a bird in a shell; when they might as well say, (but for their
featherbed, and their pillow) he dyed like a beast, and perished like an Ox
in a ditch.

3. Others die formally; I mean they make very goodly shows and
representations of much confidence and comfort. Having formerly been formal
Professors, and so furnished with many forms of godly speeches* and outward
Christian behaviors; And the spirit of delusion, and spiritual
Selfe-cousenage, which in their life time detained them in constancy of
security, and selfe-conceitednesse about the spiritual safty of their souls,
Whom Satan sees (...) of Gods favor, whom H^e knows (...), and (...) to be
cast into H^ll fire; those does He ^alsely persuade, that they are out of all
danger, and never suffer them so much as to perceive their lamentable estate:
But whom ^ee sees God does favor, whom He knows to be Christ's brethren,
and fellow-heires of the Kingdom of heaven, those will He tempt very often to
seat, to doubt, yea sometimes even to despair of their salvation. Touchstone
for a Christian. page 81.
without any such doubts, troubles, fears, temptations, which are wont to
haunt those who are true of heart, (for ordinarily such is the peace of unsound
Professors) continuing their imaginary groundless persvasion and presumption
in the height and strength unto the end, for their very last breath may be
spent in saying Lord Lord open unto us, as we see in the foolish Virgins, and
those, Mat. 7. I say such men as these, thus woefully deluded and fearfully
deceiving others, may cast out upon their last beds many glorious speeches*
intimating much seeming confidence of a good estate to Godward, contempt of
the world, willingness to die, readiness to forgive all the world, hope to
be saved, desire to be dissolved, and go to Heaven, etc. They may cry aloud
with a great deal of formal confidence, Lord, Lord, Ex hoc l^co satis liquet,
multos, quibus in ore est, Domine miserere nostri, ad inferos descendere.

Mercy, Mercy in the name of Christ, Lord Jesus receive our spirits, etc. And
yet all these goodly hopes, and earnest eiaculations, growing only from a
form, and not from the power of godliness, are but, as I said somewhere before,
as so many catchings and scrablings of a Man over-head in water; He strugles
and strives for hold to save Himself, but he graspes nothing but water; it is
still water, which He catches, and therefore sinkes and drownes. They are all
but as a spiders web, Job. 8. 14.15. Upon which, One falling from the top of an
house, lays hold by the way, for stay and support. He shall lea^e upon his
house, O qua^ multi cum hac spe ad aeternos labores and bella descendunt^ How
many go to Hell with this hope?
but it shall not stand; H^e shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. O how
many descend faitl^ an ancient Father, with this hope to eternal travails and
torment? How many says an Doctor Featly.
other worthy Doctor, go to Hell with a vain hope of Heaven: whose chiefest
cause of damnation is their false persuasion and groundless presumption of
salvation? Audi dominum: Mors peccatoris pessima. Quae tibi videtur hona,
pessima est, si intus videa^. Vides for^s ^ace^em in let to, nunquid vides
intus ^aptum ad gebe^nam? August. in Ps. 33.
Of all the four kinds of death, which ordinarily befall such as are not
saved, this is the fairest in show; but yet of greatest imposture to those
about them, and of most pestilent consequence to harden especially all of the
same humor, that hear of it.

4. Some die Penitently: But I mean seemingly so, not savingly. Many having
served their appetites all their lives, and lived in pleasure; now when the Sun
of their sensual delights begins to set, and the dark midnight of misery and
horror, to seize upon them, would very gladly be saved. And I blame them not,
If they might first live the life of the wicked, and then die the death of the
righteous: If they might have the earthly Heaven of the worlds Favorites here,
and the Heaven of Christ's Martyrs in the world to come. Ostenditur nobis per
haec verba, quod illo in tempore inter angustias diversorum terrorum videntes

tardat, and nemo credit, nemo ob^^^dit: cum autem venerit super illos mors;

These Men are wont in this last extremity, to take on extremely; But it is
but like their Howling upon their Beds. Hos. 7.14. Because they are pinched
with some sense of present horror and expectation of dreadful things: They cry
out mightily for mercy; But it is no other, then their early seeking, Prove.
1.28. Because distress and anguish is come upon them: They enquire eagerly
after God, and would now be gladly acquainted with Him; But just like them,
Psalm. 78. And to seek Him then, is not to seek Him; Non quaerebant Eum. No:
they seek Him not, they dissemble with Him (says Asaph in the next verse).
For, when God to try them, reprived them never so little time, they fell to
their old byas; and when as He ceased killing, their seeking was at an end. So
are all forced seekings: like to a Bowstring brought to his full bent, but
remit you never so little, it starteth back again. Nay, it is not quaerebant,
no kindly seeking; but a base ignoble creeping to, without all ingenuity, when
we must either die, or do it. Winchesters Sermons. page 181.
When He slew them, then they sought Him: and they returned, and enquired
early after God. And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God
their Redeemer. Nevertheless, they did flatter Him with their mouth: And they
lied unto Him with their Tongs: For their heart was not right with Him. They
promise very fair, and protest gloriously, what mended men they will be, if
the Lord restore them: But all these goodly promises are but as a morning
cloud, and as the early dew. They are like those of a Thief or murderer at
the Bar, which being now cast, and seeing there is now no way but one: O
what a reformed man would He be, if He might be reprieved! Antiochus, as
the Apocryphal Book of the 2. Maccab. 9.
Maccabees reports, when the hand of God was upon Him horribly, vowed excellent
things: O what He would do; so and so extraordinarily for the people of God!
yea and that He Himself also would become a Jew; and go through all the
world, that was inhabited, and declare the power of God. But what was it,
think you, that made this raging Tyrant to relent, and thus seemingly repent?
A pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon Him, and sore torments of
the inner parts. So that no man could endure to carry him for His intolerable
stink; And He himself could not abide His own smell. Many may thus behave
themselves upon their Beds of death with very strong shows, and many
boisterous representations of true turning unto God, whereas in truth and
trial, they are as yet rotten at heart root.

And as yet no more comfort upon good ground belongs unto them, then to those
in the forecited Places: And if any spiritual Physician in such a case, do
press it hand over head, or such a Patient presume to apply it, it is utterly
misgrounded, mis-applied. Hear what Doctor Usher in His Answer to a Jesuits
Challenge, page 152.
One of the worthiest Divines in Christendom says: Now put case One comes
to His ghostly Father with such sorrow of mind, as the terrors of a guilty
conscience usually do produce, and with such a resolution to cast away His
sins, as a Man has in a storm to cast away his goods; not because He does
not love them, but because He fears to lose His life, if He part not with
them: does not he betray this man's soul, who putteeh into His head, that such
an extorted repentance as this, which has not one grain of love to season it
withal, will qualify Him sufficiently for the receiving of an absolution?
etc. And Dyke, of Repentance, cap. 16. (...). Mat. 13 52. Poenitentia nunquam

another excellently instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven: Repentance at
death is seldom sound. For it may seem rather to arise from fear of
judgment, and an horror of Hell, then for any grief for sin. And many
seeming to repent affectionately in dangerous sickness, when they have
recovered, have been rather worse then before. It is true, that true Repentance
is never too late, but late Repentance is seldom true: For here our sins
rather leave us, then we them, as Ambrose says, And as He adds, Woe be
unto them, whose sin and life end together. This received Principle among the
ancient Fathers, That late Repentance is rarely true, implies, that it is often
false and unsound, and so by consequent confirms the present Point. Too
manifold experience also makes it good: Amongst many for my part, I have taken
special notice of two: The one being laboured-with in prison, was seemingly
so extraordinarily humbled, that a reverend Man of God was moved thereby, to
be a means for his reprive, whereupon a Pardon was procured. And yet this so
extraordinary a Penitent, while death was in his eye, having the terror
removed, returned to His vomit; and some two years after, to the same Place
again, as notorious a Belial as He was before. Another, having upon His Bed
of sickness received in His own conceit the sentence of death against
Himself; and being pressed to humiliation, and broken-heartednesse; for He
had formerly been a stranger and enemy to purity, and the power of godliness,
answered thus: My heart is broken: and so broke out into an earnest confession
of particular sins: He named uncleanness, stubbornness, obstinacy,
vainglory, hypocrisy, dissimulation, uncharitableness, covetousness,
luke-warmenesse, etc. He compared himself to the Thief upon the Cross. And
if God, says He, restore me to health again, the world shall see, what an
altered man I will be. When he was pressed to syncerity and true-heartednesse
in what he said; He protested, that he repented with all his heart and
Soul, and mind, and Bowels, etc. And desired a Minister that stood by, to be
a witness of these things between the world and Him. And yet this Man upon
His recovery, became the very same, if not worse then He was before.

Now since upon this Perusal of the different deaths incident to the godly and
the wicked, it appears; that some men never soundly converted, may in respect
of all outward representations, die as confidently and comfortably in the
conceit of the most, as Gods dearest Children: and that Christ's best servant
sometimes may depart this life And thus many dear servants of God are
oftentimes grievously perplexed, troubled in spirit, gauled in mind, long
seeking and laboring for release; and finding none, condemning themselves,
that they are the very firebrands of Hell, and cannot be saved: Nay, many
times they do even die with speeches in their mouths, which much savor of
despair. Hieron in His Caveat and Comfort for Believers, page 41.
uncomfortably to the eye, and in the opinion of the greatest part; And we
heard before, that our last and everlasting Doom must pass upon us, according
to the syncerity, or sensuality, the zealous forwardnes, or formality of our
former courses; and not according to the seeming of our last carriage upon Bed
of death, and enforced behavior in that time of extremity: I say, these things
being so, I hold my conclusion still, and resolution; not much to alter my
censure and conceit of a man's spiritual state, for the manner of His death. I
except the Thieves upon the Cross: My meaning is, that there may be some, (I
know nor how few, but I am sure there is none, except He have in Him the
perfection of the madness of all the Bedlams that ever breathed, would run
that hazard) who formerly out of the way and unreformed, may now at last, being
very extraordinarily, and mightily humbled under Gods mighty hand, and cleaving
to the Lord Jesus with truly broken hearts indeed, follow by a miracle, as it
were, the Thief upon the Cross, to an everlasting Crown. And here now, I
require the care, conscience, heavenly wisdom, experimental skill, and all
His ministerial dexterity in the Physician of the Soul, to discern aright
between these, and seeming Penitents: and then to apply Himself
proportionably with all holy discretion and seasonablenesse, to their several
different estates.

But to fright and fire every One for ever, from that extremest Sed ne fortes

folly of hoping to follow that miraculously penitent Thief; and from going on
in sin, and deferring Repentance upon such a deceiving and desperate ground;
let us consider;

1. First, what an holy and learned Greenham, page 2. cap. 32. Edit. 3.
Man of God says to this Point: In great wisdom, that men at the last gasp
should not utterly despair, the Lord has left us but one example of
exceeding, and extraordinary mercy, by saving the Thief on the Cross. -- Yet
the perverseness of all our nature may be seen by this, in that this one
serves us to looseness of life, in hope of the like: whereas we might better
reason; That it is but one, and that extraordinary, and that besides this One,
there is not Legi, inquit Augustinus, and perl^gi Scripturam: and neminem
inveni in duobus millibus annorum sal^atum in sine, nisi L^tron: mincruce.
Nicolaus Laurentius adversus desperationem, page 371.
one more in all the Bible; and that for this One that sped, a thousand
thousands have missed: And what folly is it to put our selves in a way, where
so That, that may be said, is this, and it is nothing. True, some one or two
of a thousand, and ten thousand, that have. How then? Shall we not therefore
follow our instruction, and seek Him before? -- Some going a journey, have
sound a Purse by the way: It were mad counsel* to advise us to leave o^^ money
behind, upon hope of like hap in ours, etc. Winchesters Sermon. page 180.

Si mill homines perussent ex cibi ali^uius ^enenali perceptione, uno duntoxat
miraculose servito, (...) cibum illum gustares? Harmon Evang. cap. 15. page 18^.


many have miscarried? To put our selves into the hand of that Physician, that
has murdered so many; going clean against our sense and reason: whereas in
other we always lean to that which is most ordinary, and conclude not the
Spring of one Swallow? It is as if a Man should spur His Ass till He
speak, because Baalams Ass did once speak: so grossly has the Devil
bewitched us.

2. Secondly, the singularities about the good Thief: first, His heart was
broken with one short Sermon, as it were; but thou have, or might have heard
many, and art yet hard-hearted. Secondly, the other Thief saw also that
sovereign Soule-healing blood gush freshly and abundantly out of His blessed
side, and yet was not struck, or stird at all. Thirdly, His example is only
for true Penitents; but Thou upon this presumption despising in the mean time,
the riches of Gods goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, leading Thee
to repentance, hardenest thy heart, that thou can not repent. Fourthly, His
case was singular, and such, that the like is not to be found in the whole
Scripture. A King sometimes pardons a Malefactor at the Place of execution;
will thou therefore run desperately into some horrible villainy, deserving
death, hoping to be that One amongst many thousands? Fifthly, It was a We
digest not them that call on us for the seeking of God, but seek our selves (as
the Apostle speaks) Magistros secundum desideria, that may entertain us with
speculations, of what may be done by Miracle at the hour of death: that may
give us days, and elbow-roome enough to seek other things, and to shrink up
his seeking into a narrow time at our End; and tell us, time enough then,
Winchesters Sermons, page 179.
miracle, says an excellent Dyke upon Repentance, cap. 17.
Divine, with the glory whereof our Savior would honor the ignominy of the
Cross; we may almost as well expect a second crucifying of Christ, as such a
second Thief. Christ then triumphing on the Cross, did as Princes do in the
triumph of entering into their Kingdoms, they pardon gross offenses before
committed, such as they pardon not afterward. 6. Having an eye upon this
Thief, that thou may more fully and freely follow thy pleasures, Thou
make a covenant with death, and an agreement with Hell, and puts the evil
Day far from Thee: But the Lord has professed; That thy covenant with death
shall be dis-annulled, and thy agreement with Hell shall not stand; when the
overflowing scourge shall pass through, then shall thou be trodden down by it.

3. Thirdly, the ordinary impossibilities of following the blessed Thief in
His miraculous Repentance. First, thou art cried unto continually by Gods
Messengers to come in, now while it is called to Day; yet thou stand out
still, out of this Inebriatus es? Ventri indulsisti? Rapuisti? Siste iam
gradum, verte te in diversum, conficere Deo gratiam, quod non in medijs
peccatis te abstulit: ne quaere aliud privilegium, ut male opereris. Multi quum
iam alijs dimnum fraudulenter facerent, subito perierunt, and ad manifestum
iudicium abierunt. Time ne and in hoc patiare inexcusabilis. Sed multis,
inquis, dedit Deus hoc privelegium, ut in ultima senecta consiterentur. Quid
igitur? An tibi quoque concedet? Concedet fortasse, inquis. Quidais sortasse,
and interdum, etc. Cogita quod and d^ anima deliberas, proinde etiam de
contrario cogita, and dic, Quid autem si non det? etc. Tuni bellum egressus,
non dicis, non est opus ut testamentum condam fortassis redibo; Neque de
nuptijs deliberans dices, uxorem egentem accipiam multi enim and sic praeter
spem ditati sunt; Neque domum extruens, subijciam fundamenta putria, multae
enim and sic constitere domus: De anima autem agens, apprehendis magis putria,
dicens, fortassis, and sapius ^venit, and contingit aliquando, teque incertis
tradis. Chrysostom. Hom. 22. in 2. ad Cor. 10.
conceit only, or rather deceit, to take thy fill of pleasure in the mean
time, and to seek God sufficiently upon thy Bed of death, by repenting with
the Thief at last. But know for thy terror, and timely turning, that the
longer thou puts off and deferres, the more unfit thou shall be to repent. Thy
custom in sinning will exercise more Tyranny over Thee: The curse of God for
thy going on still in thy trespasses will be more heavy upon Thee. The
corruptions that lurk in thine own bosom, will be more strengthened against
thee. And this threefold cord is hardly broken: These three Giants will be
maistered with very much ado. The further thou walk in the ways of death,
the more unwilling, and more unable will thou be to return, and be reformed.
Thine understanding will be more darkened with Hellish mists, thy judgment
more perverted, thy will more stubborn, thy memory more stuffed with sensual
notions, thine affections will become more rebellious, thy thoughts more
earthly, thine heart more hardened, thy conscience more feared, thy self more
sold to sin, and every day that comes over thine head in this state of
darkness, much more the Child of the Devil, then thou wast before. To refuse
Christ upon this Point so freely and fairly offered, is to receive Gods curse
under Seal; and to make sure thy covenant with Hell, and League with death,
until thou be slain by the one, and swallowed up of the other, without all
mercy, or recovery. For in this time of delay, God grows more angry, Satan
more strong, thy self more unable to repent, sin more unconquerable, thy
conversion more hard, thy salvation more impossible. A ruinous house, the
longer thou let it run, the more labor and charge will it require in
repairing. If thou drive a nail with an hammer, the more blows thou give to
it, the more hard will it be to pluck it out again. It is just so in the
Case of continuing in ^inne: and every new sin is a new stroke with an hammer,
that drives the nail in further. Secondly, with what possibility art thou like
to pass through the great work of saving repentance? or with what heart can
thou address thy self unto it? when upon thy sick Bed, thou art set upon at
once, if thy conscience be waking, with the ugly sight of all thy sins
charging upon thee with insupportable horror, with the pangs of death, with
Tempore mortes s^euius maiorique dolo ^entat and consligit; s^^ens si tunc
defecerit penitus se frustratum. Gerson de temptationibus diver.
Satan's utmost malice, and His very Powder Plot, and with the terror of that
approaching strickt Tribunal. Which dreadful encounter is able to put to it,
the spiritual strength of many years gathering. Thirdly, Resolution to
defer Repentance, when grace is offered, does justly merit, to be deprived
for ever after of all opportunity, and ability to repent. Fourthly, it is just
with God, that that man, who does purposely put off repentance, and provision
for his soul, until his last sickness, should for that sin alone, be snatched
out of the world in great anger, even suddenly, so that there be scarce a
moment betwixt the height of His temporal happiness, and depth of his
spiritual misery. That His foolish hope may be frustrated, and His vain
purpose come to nothing, He may be cut off, as the Top of an care of corn,
and put out like a candle, when he least thinks of death, and dreams of
nothing less, then departure from His earthly Paradise. Job 14.14.

centum peccata, nec post misle crimina de misericordia divina desperet. Sic
tamen non desperet, ut sinc ulla mora Deum sibi repropitiari festinet, ne

custom is not wont to be shaken off in an instant. Is it like, that a
Blackamore should change his skin, and a Leopard his spots in three or four
days, which they have contracted in forty or threescore years? Therefore I
marvel that any should be so blindfolded, and baffeld by the Devil, as to
embolden Himself to drive off until the last, by that Place before
Confession; At what time soever a sinner does repent him of his sin, from the
bottom of his heart, I will put all his wicked out of my remembrance, says
the Lord: Especially, if He look upon the Text from whence it is taken; which
Mee-thinkes, being rightly understood, and the conditions well considered, is
most punctual, and precise, to fright any from that desperate folly: The words
run thus, Ezech. 18.21.22. But if the wicked will turn from all his sins
which he has committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is
lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. All his
transgressions, etc. Hence it appears, that if any man expect upon good
ground, any portion in this precious promise of mercy and grace, He must leave
all his sins, and keep all Gods Statutes. Now how performest thou the
condition of leaving all thy sins; when as in this last extremity, having
received the sentence of death against thy self, Thy sins leave Thee, and
not Thou thy sins, that I may speak in the Phrase of an ancient Viste de
dubio liberare, vis quod incertum est, evadere? Age p^^nitentiam dum sanus es.
Sienimagis veram poenitentiam dum sanuses, and invenerit te novissimus dies:

Father? And what space is left to come to comfort, by keeping all Gods
Statutes; when thou art presently to pass to that highest and dreadful
Tribunal, to give an exact and strickt account for the continual breach of all
Gods Laws, all thy life long? Sixthly, many seem to be passingly penitent,
and promise exceeding fair, in the evil day, and upon their sick Beds; who
being recovered, and restored to their former state, are the very same they
were before, if not worse. I never knew, nor heard of any, un-wrought upon,
under conscionable means, who after recovery performed the vows and promises
of a new life, which He made in his sickness, and times of extremity. For if
He will not be moved with the Ministry, God will never give that honor unto
a cross, to do the deed. Nay, Father Abraham; says the rich Glutton, but if
one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If
they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, the one
rose from the dead. Luke 16.30.31. It would amaze thee much, if one of thy
good fellow companions should now rise from the dead, and tell thee, that He
who was thy Brother in iniquity, is now in Hell, and if thou follow the same
sensual courses still, thou must shortly most certainly follow Him to the
Place of torment. And yet even this would not work at all, if thou be a
despiser of the Word. It may be, while the dead Man stood by Thee, Thou
would be extraordinarily moved, and promise much: but no sooner should He
be in His Grave; but thou would be as graceless, as thou wast before.
Seventhly, what wise man seeing a fellow, who never gave his name to religion
in his life time, now only troubled about sin, when he is sure, He This
time, is the time when all Hypocrites, Atheists, tagge and ragge come in, and
seek Him in a sort: And shall not we be confounded to see our selves in
their number? Winchesters Sermon. page 181.
must die, will not suspect it to be wholly slavish, and extorted for fear of
Hell? My sentence is, says Greenham, that a man lying now at the Point of
death, having the snares of death upon him; in that strait of fear and pain,
may have a sorrow for His life past, but because the weakness of flesh, and
the bitterness of death does most commonly procure it, we ought to suspect,
etc. Eighthly, painful distempers of body are wont to weaken much, and hinder
the activenes and freedom of the Souls operations; nay, sometimes to
distract, and utterly overthrow them. Many even of much knowledge, grace and
good life, by reason of the damp and deadness, which at that time the
extremity and anguish of their disease brings upon their spirits, are able to
do no great matter, if anything at all, either in meditation or expression.
How then do thou think to pass through the incomparably greatest work,
that ever the Soul of Man was acquainted with in this life, I mean the
new birth, at the What is our seeking the^? Is it not to lie still on our Beds,
and suffer a few words to be spoken in our ears? Have a little opiate
Divinity ministered to our Souls, and so sent away. Winchesters Sermons, page
181.

Is this it? Would we then seek Him, when we are not in case to seek any
thing else? Would we turn to Him then, when we are not able to turn our
selves in our Bed? Or, rise early to seek Him, when we are not able to rise at
all? Or enquire after Him, when our breath fails us, and we are not able to
speak three words together? -- No hour, but the hour of death. No time, but
when He takes time from us. Idem Ibid. page 180.


Point of death? It is a woeful thing to have much work to do, when the power
of working is almost done. When we are come to the very last cast, our
strength is gone* our spirits clean spent, our senses appalled, and the powers
of our Souls as numbe as our senses: when there is a general prostration of
all our powers, and the shadow of death upon our eyes: then something we would
say or do, which should do our Souls good. But alas! How should it then be?

3. When the spiritual Physician powers the baulme of mercy, and oil of
comfort into a wounded conscience:

Preachers are like unskilful chirurgions, who softly touch the wound on the

Surgeon, that heales up a dangerous Sore, and draws a skin over it, before
His corrosives have consumed the dead flesh, before He has opened it with his
Tents, ransackt it to the root, and rent out the Core, is so far from
pleasuring, that he procures a great deal of misery to His Patient. For the
rotten matter that remains behind, will in the mean time rankle and fester
underneath, and at length break out again, perhaps, both with more extremity
of anguish, and difficulty of cure. They are but Mountebankes, as they call
them, Smatterers in Physic and Surgery; upon the matter, but plain Cheaters
and Couseners, who are so ready and resolute for The true Ministers of Christ

Greenham having to deal with diverse humbled Consciences, He would mislike
them, that would not abide to tarry the Lords leisure, but they must needs be
helped at once, even by and by as soon as they heard Him speak, or else they
would then think far worse of Him then ever before, notwithstanding the good
opinion conceived of Him: For besides, He that believes makes not have; This

extemporary, and palliate Cures. Sudden recoveries from rooted and old
distempers, are rarely sound. If it be thus in bodily Cures; what a deal, do
you think, of extraordinary discretion, heavenly wisdom, precise and
punctual ponderation of circumstances, well-advised and seasonable leisure,
both speculative and experimental skill, heartiest ejaculations, wrastlings
with God by Prayer for a blessing, is very convenient, and needful for a true
and right method in healing a wounded conscience? Which does pass
immeasurably all other maladies, both in exquisiteness of pain, tenderness
of touch, deceitfulness of Depth, and in highest and greatest consequence,
either for the everlasting health, or endless horror of an immortal Soul.

Hence it was, that that Greenham in His Treatise for an afflicted Conscience*
page 136.
One of a thousand, and learned Doctor in this heavenly Mystery, did so far
differ from all Dawbers with untempered Mortar, and the ordinary
undoing-courses in this kind:

But now coming to the salving of this Sore, says He, I shall seem very
strange in my cure: and so much the more be wondered at, by how much in manner
of proceeding I differ from the most sort of men herein. I am not ignorant,
that many visiting afflicted consciences, cry still; Oh comfort them! O speak
joyful things unto them! Yea, there be some, and those of the most learned,
who in such Cases, are full of these and such like speeches. Why are you so
heavy, my Brother? Why are you so cast down, my Sister? Be of good cheer:
Take it not so grievously. What is there that you should fear? God is
merciful, Christ is a Savior. These be speeches of love indeed: but they
often do the poor souls as much good herein, as if they should power cold
water into their bosoms; when as without further searching of their Sores,
they may as well minister a Malady, as a Medicine. For as nutritive and
cordial medicines are not good for every sick Person, especially when the
Body needs rather a strong Purgation, then a matter restorative; and as in
carnative medicines may for a time allay the pain of the Patient, but after,
the grief becomes more grievous: So the comfortable applying of Gods
promises are not so profitable for every One that is humbled, especially when
their Souls are rather further to be cast down, then as yet to be raised up:
so those sugared consolations may for a while over-heale the conscience, and
abate some present grief; but so, as afterward the smart may be the sorer,
and the grief may grow the greater: Hereof ensues this effect, that comfort
seems to cure for a while, but for want of wisdom in the right discerning
of the cause, Men minister one Medicine for another; and so for want of skill,
the latter fit grindeth sorer then the former. Calvine also, that For mine own
part, says Hooker, I think Calvin incomparably the wisest man, that ever the
French Church did enjoy, since the hour it enjoyed Him. In His Preface, page
3. Tho thousands were debtors to Him, as touching Divine knowledge; yet he to
none, but only to God, the Author of that most blessed Fountain, the Book of
life, and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with the helps of other
learning, which were his guides. Ibid. We should be injurious unto virtue it
self, if we did derogate from them, whom their industry has made Great. Two
things of principal moment there are, which have deservedly procured Him
honor throughout the World: the one, His exceeding pains in composing the
Institutions of Christian Religion; the other, His no less industrious
travailes for exposition of holy Scripture. -- In which two things whosoever
they were, that after Him bestowed their labor, He gained the advantage of
prejudice against them, if they gaine-said; and of glory above them, if they
consented. Ibid. page 9. The more learned and holy any Divine is, the more
heartily He subscribes to Paulus Thurias, his true censure of His Institution:
Praeter Apostolicas, post Christi
tempora, chartas,
Huic peperereli^r^saeculae
nulla parem.
Besides the holy Writ,
No book is like to it.
Or,
No Age since Christ brought forth
A book of so great worth.
No marvel then, that a learned Bishop of London in Queen Elizabeth's time,
begun His Speech thus against a lewd fellow, which had railed against Calvin^:
Quod dixisti in vir^m Dei, Calvinum, tuo sanguine non potet redimere, etc.
great Pillar and glory of the Christian World for sincere and sound Orthodoxe
doctrine, concurres in judgment with this blessed Man of God, and so, I doubt
not, do all the faithful Ministers of Jesus Christ: Sit igitur hic primus
poenit^tiae gradus, dum homines sentiunt, quam graviter deliquerint: illic non
statim curandus est doler, quemadmodum imposto^es deliniunt conscientias, ita
ut sihi indulgeant, and se ^allant ina^i^us blanditijs. Medicus enim non statim
l^niet dolorem, sed videbit, quid magis expediat: forte magis augebit, quia
necessaria erit acrior purgatio. Sic etiam faciunt Prophetae Dei, quum vident
trepidas conscientias, non statim adhibe^t blandas conso^^^tones, sed potius
ostendunt non esse ludendum cum Deo, -- and solicitant sponte currentes, ut
sibi proponant terribile Dei iudicium, quo magis, ac magis humilientur. Calvin
in Joel, cap. 2.
Let this be the first degree of Repentance; when Men feel that they have
been grievous offenders; and then the grief is not to be immediately cured;
as Impostors deal flatteringly and nicely with Men's consciences, that they may
favor themselves as much as may be, and be notably deceived with
superficial dawbing. The Physician will not forthwith assuage the pain, but
will consider what may be more expedient: Perhaps he will increase it,
because a sharper Purge will be necessary. Even so do the Prophets of God,
when they see trembling Consciences, do not presently apply sweet
consolations; but rather tell them, that they must not dally with God; and
stir up those, who are so forward of their own accord, that they would
propose unto themselves the terrible judgment of God, that they may yet be
more and more humbled.

Master Rogers of Dedham, Doctrine of Faith, page 108.109.110.111.
Another excellent and skillful Workman in the great mystery of saving Souls,
tells us truly; That the promise of salvation is not straight belonging to one
terrified in conscience, but to one that is not only terrified for His
punishment, but is contrite-hearted for sin, which is the work of the
Gospel. -- Let not these be weary of the yoke of God and the Law, and make
over much haste out of this state, for so may they undo themselves: For some
withstanding their terror, have withstood their salvation, etc. Even as an
impatient Patient gets the Surgeon to pull out the Tent and Corrosive, or
p^ls it off himself as soon as it begins to smart a little, and so thinks it
is searched enough, and now lays (says He) on healing plasters: But
afterward breaks out again worse then ever; whereas if the Corrosive had been
let lie on, till it had eaten out the corruption indeed, then it might have
been whole long ago.

If Dawbers in this kind did rightly understand and acknowledge, or had ever
had any experimental feeling in their own Souls of Christ's Rule, and the
Holy Ghosts method, which is first, To convince of sin; to deject and humble
in the sight of the Lord with apprehension, and sense of a most abominable and
cursed state, before there follow a conviction of the righteousness of Christ
to raise up; See Ioh. 16.8. or of the necessity of the work of the spirit of
bondage, to fit and prepare for Christ and comfort; I say then, they would not
deal so ignorantly and overly in a matter of so dear and everlasting
importance. They would not so hastily hand over-head, without all warrant and
wisdom, without any further search, discovery or dejection, offer mercy,
pardon, and all the promises to a man formerly wicked; only for some faint and
enforced confession of sins, or because now being overtaken by the evil
day, He howles upon his bed, not for any true hatred of sin, but for present
smart, and expected horror, etc. But would labor to let the spirit of bondage
have it is full work, and lay Him open more at large in the true colors of his
skarlet sins; and not only cause a bare confession of them, but such a
conviction which may stop his mouth, that He has not a word to speak, but
trembles to see such a sink, Sodom and Hell of sin and abomination in
Himself, etc. O how often have I heard many a poor ignorant soul in the Day of
sorrow, being moved to humble Himself in the sight of the Lord, that He
might lift Him up; first, to get His heart broken with the abhorred burden of
all His sins, and then to bring it thus bleeding to the Throne of Grace, that
Christ might bind it up; I say, being thus entreated: To answer, Yes, yes,
with all my heart; I am sorry for my sins with all my heart; I trust in Jesus
Christ with all my heart; and thus whatsoever you can counsel or advise, He
does it with all His heart: Whereas alas! Poor heart, as yet, His
understanding is as dark, as darkness it self, in respect of any, I say not
only, saving knowledge, but almost of any knowledge at all; and his heart in
respect of any true remorse, as hard as a Rock of flint. Now those unskilful
Physicians of the Soul, who in this and the like cases, will needs without any
more ado, without any further illightning or labor, threape mercy and comfort
upon them, are like those foolish sheapherds, as In his Expos. upon Psalm. 32.
page 5.
Marbury calls them, who when they want skill to help their poor sheep out
of the ditch, are driven to play the miserable comforters, and to take some
other indirect course (as many use to do in such cases) to cut the sheep
throat in time, to make him Man's meat, lest it should be said, He died in a
Ditch. They are Desolators, not Consolators, as Austin somewhere calls them:
Not sound Comforters, but true Cutthroates.

Besides that which I have said before, of the precedence of the working of the
Law, and of the spirit of bondage, to make way for Christ; let me further tell
you upon this occasion, that it may appear, that much more is to be done
herein, then is ordinarily imagined, before comfort may upon good ground, and
seasonably be applied to the Conscience awaked, what an excellent Divine, both
for depth of learning, and height of holiness, delivered somewhere in this
Point to this purpose:

No man must think this strange, that God deals with men after this strange
manner: as it were to kill them, before He make them alive; to let them pass
through, or by, as it were, the gates of Hell, to Heaven; to suffer the spirit
of bondage to put them into a fear, into a shaking, and trembling, etc. For
He suffers those that are his, to be terrified with this fear:

1. First, in respect of His own glory; For the magnifying both of His
justice, and of His mercy:

1. He glorifies His justice, when lessening, or altogether, for the time,
abstracting all fight of mercy, He lets the Law, Sin, Conscience, and Satan
loose upon a Man, to have their course, and several comminations; and sets the
spirit of bondage on work, etc. Thus, as in the great work of As in the work
of Creation, so in the work of Redemption, God would have the praise of all
his attributes. He is much honored, when they are acknowledged to be in Him
in highest perfection; and their infiniteness and excellency admired and
magnified. In the former, there appears gloriously His infinite Wisdom,
Goodness, Power, Justice, Mercy, etc. and yet in the work of Redemption, which
was the greater, they seem ^o shine with more ^^eetnesse, amiable^^sse, and
excellency. (...) in it appeared all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
etc. And in conveying it to the Church, first, His Wisdom there appears
infinite wisdom, in finding out such a means for the redemption of Mankind,
as no ^^eated understanding could possible imagine, or (...) of. Secondly,
(...) immeasurably sweet and admirable, in not sparing His own Son, the
Son of His love; that He might spare us, who had so grievously transgressed
against Him. Thirdly, His Justice in it is highest excellency; in spa^ing us,
not to spare* His own only Son: laying, as it were, His head upon the
block, and chopping it off; renting and ^ea^ing that blessed Body, even as the
Veil of the Temple was rent, and making His Soul an Offering for sin, etc.
This was the perfection of Justice.
redemption, He would have the glory of His justice appear; so would He have
it also in the application of our redemption, that justice should not be
swallowed up of mercy: But even as the Woman, 2. King. 4. who had nothing to
pay, was threatened by Creditours to take away her two sons, and put them in
prison: so we having nothing to pay, the Law is let loose upon us, to threaten
imprisonment and damnation; to affright and terrify: and all this, for the
manifesting of His justice. Furthermore, the Book of God is full of terrible
threatenings against sinners: Now shall all these be to no purpose? The wicked
are insensible of them; to them therefore in that respect, they are in vain.
Some there must needs be, upon whom they must work; Shall the Lion roar,
says the Prophet, and no man be affraide? Since then, they who should, will
not; Some there be who must tremble. This the Prophet excellently sets
^orth, Isai. 66.2. where the Lord shows, whom He will regard. But to this
man will I look, even to Him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and
trembles at my Word. Neither is it without good cause, that God deals thus
with his own in this manner, tho it be sharp in the experience. First, we
must fear, tremble, and be humbled: and then we shall receive a spirit not
to fear again.

2. His mercy also is thereby mightily magnified. Which would never be so
sweet, nor relish so well, nor be so esteemed of us; if the awful terror of
justice had not formerly made us smart. A King sometimes does not only suffer
the Law to pass upon some grievous malefactor for high treason; but also
causes him to be brought to the place of execution, yea, and lay down his
head upon the block, ere He pardon: and then mercy is mercy indeed, and A
man, who otherwise would not cry, nor shed a tear for any thing; despises
death, and would not fear to meet an host of men; I say, such an One, now
having at the last instant a pardon brought from the King, it works
wonderfully upon him, and will cause softness of heart, and tears to come
many times, where nothing else could. He is so struck with admiration of so
great mercy, so sweet and seasonable in such an extremity, that Me stands
amazed, and knows not what to say; but many times falls a weeping, partly for
joy of His deliverance; and partly also out of indignation against Himself,
for His barbarous behavior toward so pitiful a Prince. This was to be seen
in some great men, at the beginning of King James His Reign, condemned for
treason, and pardoned at the Block.
melts the heart abundantly with amaz^m^nt and admiration of it. So God deals
with us many times: Lets the Law loose against us, puts us in fear, casts us
into Prison, and threatens condemnation in Hell for ever; so that when mercy
comes to the Soul^, being now lost in it self, and at the Pits brinke, it
appears to be a wonderful mercy, the riches of exceeding mercy, most
seasonable, most Exaudime Domine, quoniam suavi^ est misericordia tua:
tantundem valet, ac si dixisset, I am noli differ exauditionem, in ta^t a
tribulati^ne sun, ut suavis mihi sit misericordia tua. Ad hoc enim subvenire
differebas, ut mibi dulce esset, quod subveniebas. August. Concione 2. in Psalm.
68.
sweet, most ravishing. Why do so many find no savor in the Gospel? Is it
because there is no matter of sweetness or delight in it? No, it is because
they have not tasted of, not been soundly touched and terrified by the Law, and
the spirit of bondage; They have not smarted, nor as yet been afflicted with a
sense of the bitterness of sin, nor of just punishment due unto the same.
God therefore sends into our hearts the spirit of fear and bondage, to prepare
us to relish mercy: And then the spirit of adoption, not to fear again. And
thus by this order, the one is magnified, and highly esteemed, by the
foregoing sense of the other.

2. Secondly, for our good; and that two ways: first, in Justification:
secondly, and in Sanctification.

1. For the first; we are such strangers unto God, that we will never come
unto Him, till we see no other remedy; being at the Pits brinke, ready to
starve, hopeless, etc. We see it in the prodigal Son: He would never
think of any return unto his Father, till all other helps failed Him, money,
friends, acquaintance, all sorts of food; Nay, if He might have fed upon
husks with the Swine, He would not have thought of returning, any more to his
Father: This being denied him, the Text says, He came to Himself: showing
us, that when Men run on in sinful courses, they are mad men, out of
themselves; even as we see th^se in Bedlam are beaten, kept under, den^ed
comforts, till they come to themselves: And what faith He then? I will arise,
and go to my Father, and will say unto Him, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and against Thee, etc. So it is with us, until the Lord humble, and
bring us low in our own eyes, show us our misery and spiritual poverty, and
that in us there is no good thing; that we be stripped of all helpe^, in, and
without our selves; and see that we must perish, unless we beg His mercy; I
say, until then we will not seek his face and favor, nor have recourse to
Jesus Christ, the rock of our salvation. It is with us in this Case, Luke 8.43.
as it was with the Women, whom Christ healed of the bloody issue. How long was
it, ere she came to Christ? She had been sick twelve years; She had spent
all her living upon Physicians, neither could she be healed of any. Now this
extremity brought Her to Jesus Christ. This then is the means to bring to
Christ: To bring us upon our knees, to drive us out of our selves, hopeless,
as low as may be; To show us, where help is only to be found, and make us
run unto it. The hunted Beast flies unto his Den: The Israelites being stung
by fiery Serpents, made have to the Brazen Serpent, a Type of Christ, for
help: The Man-killer under the Law, chaced by the avenger of blood, ran^e a
pace to the City of refuge. Ioab being pursued for his life, fled to the
Tabernacle of the Lord, and laid fast hold upon the horne^ of the Altar: A
wounded man hies unto the Surgeon: Proportionably a poor Soul, broken and
bruised with the insupportable burden of all his abominations, bleeding at
heart-roote under sense of Divine wrath, by the cutting edge of the Sword of
the Spirit, managed aright by some Masters of assemblies, chaced furiously by
the Law, Sin, Conscience, and Satan, sometimes even to the brinke of
despair, etc. will be willing with a witness, to cast it self into the
sweet compassionate inviting arms, and embracements of Jesus Christ, broken
and bleeding upon the Cross for our sins, and so be made His, for ever.

2. For our sanctification also, it is good for us that the Comforters first
work be, to work fear in us. For we are naturally so frozen in our dregs,
that no fire in a manner will warm, or th^w us. We wallow in our own blood,
we stick fast in the mire of sin up to the chinne, that we cannot stir.
So that this fear is sent to pull us violently, as it were, from our
corruptions; to make us holy, and look unto our ways for the time to come.
Now to effect this, sharpest things are best; as are the Law, and threatenings
of condemnation, the opening of Hell, the racking of the conscience, and a
sense of wrath present, and to come. So hard-hearted are we by nature, being
as the Children of the bondwoman, to whom violence must be used. Even as we
see a Man riding a young and wild Horse to tame him; He will run him
against a wall, that he may make him afraid, ride him in deep and rough
places; or if this will not do, take him up to some high rock, and bringing
him to the brinke thereof, He threatens to throw him down headlong; makes
him shake and quake, whereby at last he is tamed. So deals the Lord with us:
He gives us a sight of sin, and of the punishment due thereunto, a sense of
wrath, sets the conscience on fire, as it were; fills the heart with
fears, ^orrours and dis-quietnesse; opens Hell thus unto the Soul, brings
us to the gates thereof, and threatens to throw us in: And all this to make a
man more holy, and Christus ^o^ine instat^m terret comminatioue exclusionis e
regn^ coelorum. Nam qui nondum conversi sunt, ad inferos, iam priui^^
detrudendi sunt, ad hoc ut inspecta poena peccati, discant ab co abhorrere, quo
tempore natura sese oblecta^^. Rolloc in Johan. cap. 3. page 133.
hate sin the more. The cure of the Stone in the heart, says Dike of
Repentance, cap. 2.
another, speaking to the same purpose, is like that of the Stone in the
Bladder: God must use a sharp incision, and come with his pulling and plucking
instruments, and rend the heart in pieces, ere that sin can be got out of
it. -- Even as in a lethargy it is needful the Patient should be cast into a
burning Fever, because the senses are benumbed, and this will wake them, and
dry up the be^otting humors; so in our dead security before our conversion,
God is feign to let the Law, Sin, Conscience and Satan loose upon us; and to
kindle the fire of Hell in our souls, that so we might be rouzed: Our sins
stick close unto us, as the Prisoners bolts, and we are shut up under them,
as in a strong Prison: And therefore unless, as once in Paul and Silas their
case, an earthquake, so here there come a mighty heart-quake, violently
breaking open the Prison doors, and shaking off our fetters, never shall we
get our liberty, etc.

Thus we see, what a mighty Quando peccati, quod divinae legis est violatio,
conse^^ntia stimulamur, atque convincimur, intelligimusque nos per peccatum in
execrationem, acerbissimum odium, gravissi^^amque Divini numinis offensiontem,
atque indignationem incurrisse, mercedemque atque stipendium, quod peccatum

morbisque, and morte corporis affic^amur; verum etiam, ut damnati^^e atque

work of the Law, and of the spirit of bondage there must be, to prepare for
Christ. And how requisite it is both for the glorifying of Gods justice and
mercy; and also for the furtherance of our justification, and sanctification.
For illustration of which Point, besides all that has been said before, I have
more willingly in this last Passage pressed at large the authority of so great a
Divine, (in which, I hope, I have not swarved from His sense) because He is
without exception both for holiness and learning: and so his sincere and
orthodoxe judgment more current and passable.

Ob. But hence, it may be, some troubled Soul may take up a complaint, and
say: Alas, if it be thus, what shall I think of my self? I do not remember,
that ever I tasted so deeply of such terrors, and legal troubles, as you
seem to require: I have not been so humbled and terrified, nor had such
experience of that state under the spirit of bondage, as you talk of, etc. And
therefore you have cast scruples into my conscience, about the truth and
soundness of my conversion.

Answ. I answer, in this work of the spirit of bondage; in this Case of legal
terrors, humiliations, and other preparative dispositions, we do not
prescribe precisely just such a measure and quantity: We do not determine
peremptorily upon such or such a degree, or height: We leave that to the
Wisdom of our great Master in Heaven, the only wise God, I grant, the Lord,
who is the most free Agent, takes liberty, and works as it pleases him; and
there is ods, and difference for time, measure, and such things: but for the
general always the same; by humbling first, then comforting, etc. Mast.
Rogers of Dedbam Doctr. of Faith, page 63.
who is a most free Agent. But sure we are, a man must have so much, and in
that measure, as to bring Him to Christ. It must make him weary of all his
sins, and of Satan's bondage wholly; willing to pluck out his right eye, and
cut off his right hand, I mean, to part with his best-beloved bosome-lusts; to
sell all, and not leave so much as an hoof behind. It must be so much, as to
make him see his danger, and so have to the City of Refuge, to be sensible of
his spiritual misery, that he may heartily thirst for mercy; to find
himself lost and cast away in Himself, that Christ may be All in All unto
Him: And after must follow an hatred of all false and evil ways for the time
to come; a thorow-change of former courses, company, conversation; and setting
Himself in the way and practice of ^obriety, honesty and holiness. If thou
have had experience of these affections, and effects in thine own soul,
whatsoever the measure of the work of the spirit of bondage has been in thee
less or more; Thou art safe enough, and may go on comfortably in the holy
Path, without any discouragement, either from such pretended scruples in thy
self, or any of Satan's cruel cavils, and oppositions to the contrary.

Upon this occasion, it will not be here unseasonable, to tell you, How that
Legal terror, which God appoints to be a preparative in his elect, for the
spirit of adoption, and a true change, differs from that which is found in This
Legal terror and spirit of fear, is but a common work of the Spirit. Such an
one, that unless more follow, it can afford us no comfort. (...) in N. T. est

Aliens, and not attended with any such saving consequents: That every one, who
has had trouble of conscience for sin, may clearly discern, whether it
has brought Him to Christ, or left Him unconverted.

1. That happy Soul, which is under the terrifying hand of God, preparing by
the work of the spirit of bondage, for the entertainment of Christ, and a
sound conversion upon that fearful apprehension of Gods wrath, and strict
visitation of his conscience for sin, casts about for ease and reconcilement,
only by the blood of the Lord Jesus, and those Soule-healing promises in the
Book of life, with a resolute contempt of all other means and offers, for
pacification: feeling now, and finding by experience, that no other way, no
earthly thing, not this whole world, were it all dissolved into the most
curious, and exquisite pleasures, that ever any carnal heart conceived, can
any way assuage the least pang of his grieved spirit. Glad therefore is He to
take counsel and advise, with any that is able, or likely to lead him by a
wise and discreet hand to a well-grounded comfort and refreshment: And
resolves greedily, whatever the prescription and direction be, to give way
unto it most willingly in his performance and practice. And the people asked
him, saying, What shall we do then? Then came also Publicans to be baptized,
and said unto Him, Master, what shall we do? And the Soldiers likewise
demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? Thus were John's hearers
affected, Luke 3.10, 12, 14. being afflicted with the piercing passages of
John's thundering Sermon; Men and brethren what shall we do? say the Penitent
Jews, pricked in their hearts, Acts. 2.37. The Iaylour, Acts 16.30. came
trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and said, Sirs, what must I
do to be saved? As if they had said: Prescribe and enjoin what you will; be
it never so harsh and distastefull to flesh and blood, never so cross and
contrary to carnal reason, profit, pleasure, preferment, acceptance with the
world, ease, liberty, life, etc. having warrant out of the Word, we are
resolved, and ready to do it. Only inform us first, how to partake, and be
assured of the person and passion of Jesus Christ; how to have the angry face
of our blessed God, to whom we have continued Rebels so long, turned into
calmnesse and favor unto us. But now a Castaway and Alien thus legally
terrified, and under wrath for sin, is never wont to come to this
earnestness of care, eagerness of resolution, steadfastness of endeavor,
willingness upon any terms to abandon utterly all His old ways, and to
embrace new, strict and holy courses. These things appear unto Him terrible
Puritanicall, and intolerable. He commonly in such cases, has recourse for
ease and remedy to worldly comforts, and the arm of flesh. He labors to
relieve his heavy heart, by a strong and serious casting his mind, and
nestling his conceit upon his riches, gold, greatness, great friends, credit
amongst Men, and such other transitory delights, and fading flowers of His
fools Paradise. For He is at a Point, and resolute with a sensual impenitent
obstinacy, not to pass forward through the Pangs of the New Birth by repentance
and sanctification, into the holy Trade of new-obedience: lest He should, (as
out of a foolish and phranticke baseness, He is apt to fear) be engaged and
enchained, as it were, to too much stricknesse, preciseness, holiness of
life, communion with Gods people, and opposition to good fellowship.

2. He, that is savingly-wounded with Legal terror, is wont in cold blood,
and being something come to Himself, to entertain the very same conceit (or
rather mingled with a great deal more reverence, affectionatenesse and love,
as far as the life of an immortal Soul does surpass in dearness and
excellency the cure of a frail and earthy body) of that Man of God, which by a
right managing the edge of his spiritual sword, has pierced his heart,
scorched his conscience, and bruised his spirit; I say, the same in proportion,
which a wise and thankful Patient would have of that faithful Surgeon, which
has seasonably and thoroughly launced some deep and dangerous Sore, which
otherwise would have been his death. Upon the search and discovery, He
clearly sees and acknowledges, that had not that holy incision been made into
his rotten and ulcerous heart, it had cost him the eternal life of his Soul.
But now the Alien put out of his sensual humor with horror of conscience, is
ordinarily transported with much ragefull coffeehouse, against the powerful
Ministry of Gods paineful Messengers, who put Him to such torture, by
troubling Him for sin, and frighting Him with Hell. And thereupon cries out
against them, at least with secret indignation and fretting, as the Devils did
against Christ: Why do you thus torment us before the time?

3. Aliens in such cases entertain no other thought, and cast about for no
other comfort at all, but only how they may recover their former quietness of
mind, carnal ease, and freedom from present terror. But he that is fitting,
by the spirit of bondage, for Faith, and the fellowship of the Saints, will
never by any means, whatsoever come of Him, relapse to his wouted sensual
security. Nay, of the two, He will rather lie still upon the Rack, waiting
for the Lord Jesus all the days of his life, then to return any more unto
foolishness, or hunt again after any contentment in the miserable pleasures
of good fellowship.

4. That Messenger, an Interpreter, Si adsit peccatori calamitate ali ^u^
presso, vel lethaliter aegrotanti minister Dei, annuncians ^i voluntatem Dei,
and exhortans adresipiscentiam and mutationem vitae in melius, cuiusmodi
nunsius and interpres fidus voluntatis Dei est rarissi^us, qui indicet non Deo,
sed homini aequitatem, sen rectitudinem illius nimirum Dei, hoc est,
iustissimam, and aequissima^ gubernatione^ Dei, qua ille erga omnes homines,
and inprimis afflictos utitur. Polan. in Ezech. cap. 20.
One among a thousand, who in such a case can seasonably and soundly declare
unto a savingly-wounded Soul His righteousness; assure Him, it was Christ
Jesus only business in coming from Heaven, to disburden all that labor, and
are heavy laden; and ease such trembling hearts, etc. I say, such a blessed Man
of God to such a broken heart, is for ever after most dear and welcome. His
sect are beautiful in his eye, every time He comes near Him. Comfort of so
high a nature, in extremity of such horrible consequence, does infinitely and
endlesly endeare the delivered Soul to such an heavenly Doctor. But Aliens
commonly make no great account of godly Ministers any longer, then they have
present need of them, and that trouble of mind makes them Melancholic, and
without mirth. They seem to reverence them, while from their general
discourses of mercy, and Gods free grace, of merciful invitations to Christ,
and certainty of acceptance (if they will come in) etc. They suck into their
false hearts before the time, and truth of humiliation, some superficial
glimmerings, and flashes of comfort and cooling. But if once the heat of their
guilty rage begin to assuage, and they find again some ease from their former
terrors, and wonted relish in earthly delights, they turn such holy men out
of their hearts, cast them out of their consciences, and hold no higher, or
further conceit of them, then of other, and ordinary men; if they forbear to
persecute them with thoughts of disdain and contempt.

5. The true Penitent, having smarted under the sense of divine wrath, and
frighted with the flames of horror for sin, does grow fearful for ever
after to offend, and with much gracious care dreads that consuming fire. But
the Alien, while he is upon the R^cke indeed, and has the heinousness of
his sins, and Hell freshly in His eye, will easily make many glorious
protestations and promises, what a rare and resolute Convert He will become
upon his recovery. But if once the storm be over-blowne, Gods hand
withdrawn, and his painful conscience cast again into a dead sleep by the
power, or rather poison of some sensual receipt, He performs just nothing:
But like a filthy swine, wallowes again in the mire and mud of earthlinesse
and carnality, and again with the beastly dog, returns unto, and resumes his
vomit.

6. He that has savingly passed through the Pangs of such spiritual
afflictions, is wont to be very kindlily affected, most compassionate, and
tenderhearted to others, afflicted with the same woeful terrors and troubles
of conscience. A woman, which has herself with extraordinary pain, tasted of
that exquisite torture of child birth, is wont to be more tenderly and
mercifully disposed toward another in the like torment; then she, that never
knew what that misery meant: And is more ready, willing, and skillfull to
relieve in such distresses. It is proportionably so in the present Case: But
the Alien being tainted in some measure with the Devils hateful disposition,
is by the heat of his slavish horror, rather enraged with malice, then
resolved into mercy: He is rather tickled with a secret content, then touched
with true commiseration, to see and hear of others plunged into the same
gulphe of misery, and plagued like Himself. He is much troubled with his
solenesse in suffering, and the singularity of any sorrowful Accident.
Companion-ship in crosses, does something allay the discomforts of carnal men:
So that sometimes they secretly, but very sinfully rejoice, (such is their
dogged, Ex (...), ass. ^us (...) and gaudio ^^^lus; Cum (...) has: (...).
Tropto ed (...) latibus lae^antur, ad ipsum Diabolum accedunt: And they are as
like (...) in this p^stilent property, as if He had spi^ them out of his ^
oath.
divelish disposition) even to see the hand of God upon their neighbors.
Neither can he in such extremeties minister any means of help, or true
comfort at all, either by prayer, counsel, or any experimental skill; because
the evil spirit of his vexed conscience, was not driven away by any
well-grounded application of Gods mercies, and Christ's blood, but as Saules
was, by Music, worldly mirth, carnal advise, Soule-slaying flatteries of
Man-pleasing Ministers, plunging desperately into variety of sensual
pleasures, etc.

7. He, which after the boisterous tempest of Legal terrors, has happily
arrived at the Port of Peace; I mean, that blessed peace which passes all
understanding, made with God himself in the blood of his Son, enters presently
thereupon into the good way, takes upon Him the yoke of Christ, and serves him
afterward in holiness and righteousness all the days of his life. And
ordinarily His deeper humiliation, is an occasion of his more humble, precise,
holy, and strickt walking, and of more watchfulness over his heart, and
tenderness of conscience, about lesser sins also; all occasions of scandal,
appearances of evil, even aberrations in his best actions, and holiest duties,
etc. But Aliens, when once they be taken off the Rack, and their torture
determine, either become just the same men they were before; or else reform
only some one, or other gross sin, which stucke^ most upon their consciences,
but remain unamended and unmortified in the rest: or else, which often comes
to pass, grow a great deal worse. For they are, as it were, angry with God,
that he should give them a taste of Hell fire before their time; and therefore
knowing their time but short, fall upon earthly delights more furiously,
engrosse and graspe the pleasures of the World with more greediness and
importunity.

These things thus premised; I come to tell you, that for the rectifying of the
forementioned Error, and prevention of the danger of dawbing and undoing for
ever in a matter of so weighty importance, I would advise the Spiritual
Physician, to labor with the utmost improovement of all his divine skill,
heavenly wisdom, best experience, heartiest prayers, most piercing
persuasions, pressed out of the word for that purpose, wisely to work, and
watchfully to observe the season, when he may, warrantably and upon good
ground, apply unto the woundedst soul of his spiritually-sicke Patient assured
comfort in the promises of life, and that sovereign blood, which was spilt for
broken hearts; and assure him in the Word of truth, that all those rich
compassions, which lie within the compass of that great Covenant of
everlasting mercy and love, sealed with the painful sufferings of the Son
of God, belong unto Him. Which is then, when his troubled heart is soundly
humbled under Gods mighty hand, and brought at length to, first, a truly
penitent sight, sense, and hatred of all sin: secondly, a sincere and
unsatiable thirst after Jesus Christ, and righteousness both imputed, and
inherent: thirdly, an unfeigned and un-reserved resolution of an universal
New-obedience for the time to come, etc. Here I had purposed to have been
large; but I am prevented by that which has been said already: and therefore
to avoid repetition, I must remit you to the consideration of those Legal and
Evangelicall preparations for the entertainment of Christ and true comfort,
which I handled before, which may give some good direction and satisfaction in
the Point.

Yet take notice, that in the mean time before such fitness be fully
effectuated, I would have the Man of God ply his Patient with his best
persuasions and Proofs, seasonably mingled with motives to humiliation, of the
pardonablenesse of his sins, possibility of pardon, damnablenesse of
despair, danger of ease by outward mirth, etc. And to hold out to the eye of
the troubled conscience, as a prize and Lure, as it were, the freeness of Gods
immeasurable mercy, the general Offer of Jesus Christ without any exception of
persons, times, or sins; the pretiousnesse and infallibility of the
promises, in as fair and lovely a fashion, in as orient and alluring forms,
as He can possibly. But it is One thing, to say; If these things be so, I can
assure you in the Word of life, of the promises of life, and already-reall
right and interest to all the riches of Gods free grace, and glorious purchase
of Christ's meritorious blood: Another thing, to say; If you will suffer your
understandings to be illightened, your consciences to be convinced, your
hearts to be wounded with sight, sense, and horror of sin; If you will
come-in, and take Jesus Christ, His Person, his Passion, his yoke; If you will
entertain these and these affections, longings, and resolutions, etc. Then
most certainly our merciful Lord will crown your truly humbled souls with
his dearest compassions, and freest love.

Lastly, be informed, that when all is done, I mean, when the Men of God have
their desire; That the Patient in their persuasion is soundly wrought upon, and
professes understandingly and feelingly, and as they verily think from His
heart; first, that He is heavy laden with the grievous burden of all His
sins; secondly, That He is come by his present spiritual terror and
trouble of mind, to that resolution, to do any thing; which we find the
Hearers of John and Peter, Luke 3. Act. 2. Thirdly, That He most highly
prizeth Jesus Christ far above the riches, pleasures, and glory of the whole
earth; thirsts, and longs for Him infinitely. Fourthly, That He is most
willing to sell all: To part with all sin, with His right eye, and right
hand, those lusts and delights which stuck closest to His bosom; Not to leave
so much as an hoof behind. Fifthly, That he is content with all his heart to
take Christ, as well for a Lord and Husband to serve, love, and obey Him; as
for a Savior to deliver Him from the miseries of sin. To take upon Him His
yoke: To enter into the narrow way, and walk in the holy Path: To associate
Himself to that sect, which is so spoken against everywhere, etc. I say, when
it is thus with the afflicted Party, and most happy is He, when it is thus
with Him; yet notwithstanding, because God alone is the Searcher of the heart,
and the heart of Man is deceitful above all things, we can assure mercy and
pardon, but only conditionally, (Tho by the mercy of God, we do it many and
many times with strong and undeceiving confidence). We must ever add either
expressedly, or impliedly, such forms of speech as these: If all this which
you profess be in truth; If you be thus resolved indeed; If these things be
so as you have said, etc. Why, then we assure you in the word of life and
truth, your Case is comfortable; you may sweetly repose your troubled, and
truly-humbled soul upon Jesus Christ, as your wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification and redemption; upon all the Promises of life, Gods free grace,
etc. as truly belonging unto you, and certainly yours for ever.

Hear two Master Builders upon the matter, confirming the present Point.

1. Doctor Usher in his Answer to a Jesuits challenge. Of the Priests power to
forgive sins, page 144.
To think that it lies in the power of any Priest truly to absolve a man from
his sins, without implying the condition of his believing and repenting, as he
ought to do, is both presumption and madness in the highest degree.

2. Buckler of the Faith. By Peter de Mou^^ against Armo^z the Jesuit. Of
A^ticular confession, page 390.
In the Pardon, whereby a Priest By pardoning here, understand not any
sovereignty of remitting sins: we leave that error to the Luciferian pride
of that Man of sin, who exalts himself above all that is called God. Whom
if we follow, we must say, that in this high Priest there is the fullness of
all graces; because He alone gives a full indulgence of all sins: that that
may agree unto Him, which we say of the chief Prince our Lord, that of his
fullness all we have received. Oportet dicere, in summo Pontifice esse plenis
^d^e^ omnium, gratiarum; quia ipse solus confert plenam indulgentiam omnium
peccatorum: ut competat sibi, quod de primo principe Domino dicimus; quia de
plenitudine ^i^s ^os omnes a^^epimus. De regimine Principum, Lib. 3. cap. 10.
inter Opuscula Thomae, number. 10. Nay, we must acknowledge, that the meanest in
the whole army of Priests, that followe^^ this King of pride, has such
fullness of power derived unto him, for the opening and shutting of heaven
before men: that forgiveness is denied to them, whom the Priest will not
forgive. Negatur remissio illis, quibus noluerint Sacerdotes remittere.
Bellarm. de Poenitent. lib. 3. cap. 2. I say then, by pardoning, we must not
understand any sovereignty of remitting sins: but a declaring and showing to
the true Repentant, that they are pardoned, ministerially only. To which
truth, it is so mighty, even some Popish writers subscribe. God, says Lombard,
the Father of the Romish School, has given power to Priests to bind and
unbinde, that is, to show, that men are bound or unbound. Deus Sacerdotibus
tribuit potestatem solvendi and ligandi, id est, osten dendi homines esse
ligato^ (...) solutos. Lib. 4. distinct. 18. litera F. whom a great number of
Schoolmen follow, In (...) Sent. Did. 18. Nay, our Polemicall Divines prove
it to be publicly taught from (...) time of Satan's loosing, until his

this purpose, these are their Authors: Radulphus Ardens; The power, says He,
of releasing sins belongs to God alone: but the ministry (which improperly
is called a power) He has granted to His substitutes, who after this manner
do bind and absolve, that i^ to say, do declare that men are bound, or
absolved. ^ot^stas peccata relaxandi solius Dei est. Ministerium vero, quod

pardons a sinner for an offense by Him committed against God, there are two
things to be considered: One, that there is no pardon, if the sinner does not
earnestly repent; The other, that he himself which pardons, has need of
pardon. Of these two Points, the first is the cause, that the Priests pardon is
conditional, because He knows not the heart; The other is a cause, that the
Priest should consider of himself, that he is rather a Delinquet, then a
Judge: and to teach him to fear, lest that after he has pardoned others, He
himself may not obtain pardon. It is a thing certain, that if a sinner
seriously converting* and believing in Jesus Christ, cannot obtain absolution
of his Pastor which is passionate, or badly informed of the truth; God will
pardon him. On the contrary, if a Pastor that is indulgent, an winketh at
vices, or that is deceived by appearance of repentance, absolveth an
hypocritical sinner, and receives him into the communion of the faithful,
that ^ypocriticall sinner remains bound before God, and shall be punished
notwithstanding. For God partaketh not with the errors of Pastors, neither
regards their passions; nor can be hindered from doing justice by their
ignorance.

3. Let me add Neque enim praeiudicamus Domino iudicatur^, quo minus si
poenitenti^m ple^am and iustam peccatoris invenerit, tunc ratum faciat, quod a
nobis fuerit hic statutum. Si vero nos aliquis poenitentiae simulatione
deluserit; Deus, qui non deridetur, and qui cor hominis intuetur, de his qua
nos minus perspe^imus indicet, and servorum sententiam Dominus ^^e^det. Ad
Antonianum. epist. 2. lib. 4.
Cyprian, who at the first rising of the Novatian heresy, wrote thus to
Antonianus: We do not prejudice the Lord that is to judge; But that he, if
He find the repentance of the sinner to be full, and just, he may then
ratify that, which shall be here ordained by us: But if any one do deceive
us with the semblance of repentance, God (who is not mocked, and who beholds
the heart of man) may judge of those things, which we did not well discern,
and the Lord may amend the sentence of his servants.

Neither let this Truth; to wit, that our assuring of mercy and pardon must be
conditional, upon such like terms as these; If thou do believe, and repent
as thou ought to do; If these things be in truth as you promise and
profess, etc. discourage, or trouble any that are true of heart: For it should
not prejudice, or hinder their application of the promises, taking Christ as
their own assurance of mercy and comfort: because they are conscious to
themselves of the syncerity of their own hearts. And therefore Doctor Usher,
in His Answer to a Jesuits Challenge, page 137.
Look how the Prophet Esaias was comforted, when the Angel said unto Him; Esaias.
6.7.
Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged; and the poor Woman in the
Gospel, when Jesus said unto Her, Luke 7.48.
Thy sins are forgiven: The like consolation does the distressed sinner
receive from the mouth of the Minister, when he has compared the truth of
Gods Word faithfully delivered by Him, with the work of Gods grace in His own
heart. According to that of Elibu: Job 33.23.24.
If there be an Angel, or a Messenger with him, an Interpreter, One of a
thousand, to declare unto man his righteousness; then will God have mercy upon
Him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have received a
reconciliation.

2. Too much. A little Aqua vita may happily revive and refresh the fainting
spirits of a swouning Man; but too much would kill. A spoone-full of
Cinnamon Water mingled with twelve spoone-fulls of Spring Water, and one
spoonefull of Rose Water, etc. may be sovereign against the sinking of the
heart; But pour at once a Pint into the Stomach, and it might unhappily choke
the natural heat, waste the Radical moisture, and burn up a Man's Bowels.
Mercy being wisely administered in the right season, and mingled with convenient
Counsels and Caveats, may, by Gods blessing, bind up a broken heart with a
leasurable and kindly Cure; It may mollify in the mean time with an healing
and heavenly heat, the smarting anguish of a wounded conscience; and at length
seasonably close it up with sound and lasting comfort: But poured out hand over
head by an unsteady, and in-discreet hand, It may by accident, dangerously dry
up penitent tears too soon, and stifle the work of the spirit of Bondage in
the beginning.

But here let none either out of ignorance or malice mistake, or be troubled
with this Too much: The same Phrase in the same sense is to be found in The
comfort which is ministered to the part^ in distress, must be allayed with
some mixture of the Law; that is to say: The Promise alone must not be
applied, but withal mention is to be made of the sins of the Party, and of
the grievous punishments due unto Him for the same. The reason is, because
there is much guile in the heart of Man; insomuch, as oftentimes it falls
out, that men not thoroughly humbled, being comforted, either too soon, or too
much, do afterward become the worst of all. In this respect, not unlike to the
iron, which being cast into the fire vehemently hot, and coold again, is much
more hard then it would have been, if the heat had been moderate. And hence it
is, that in the ministering of comfort, we must something keep them down, and
bring them on by little and little to repentance. The sweetness of comfort is
the greater, if it be allaied with some tartness of the Law. Cases of
Conscience, Lib. 1. Cap. 7. Sect. 5. Here remember by the way, that the
comforts ministered usually and ordinarily, must not go alone, but be mingled
and tempered with some terrors of the Law, etc. -- The ministering of comfort
in this distress would not be direct and present, but by certain steps and
degrees: Except only in the Point of death: for then a directer course must be
used. I^id. Cap. 11. Sect. 1.
Master Perkins, a great Master in the deep mystery of dealing with afflicted
consciences. For we must know, that Too much, is by no means to be meant of
any ways restraining, or confining the infiniteness of Gods mercy. It were
execrable blasphemy to dis-roabe Gods most glorious Attribute of it is
immensity: but in respect of not mingling some Coolers and Caveats to keep
from presumption: as shall appear in the ensuing Counsels, I shall commend
for that purpose.

Upon this ground, I reason thus:

A man may press, and apply Gods justice, and the terrors of the Law Too
much; therefore also mercy, and the comforts of the Gospel, too much. The
consequent is clear. For as the former may plunge into the Gulphe of despair;
so the other may cast upon the Rock of presumption: Nay, it is more then
un-answerably strong; Because we are far readier to apprehend, and apply
unto our selves mercy, then judgment. And thousands are endlesly overthrown
through presumption, for one by despair.

And the Antecedent who will deny? It is rather so preposterously applauded and
pressed; that most, if a Minister, even with his best discretion, reveal the
whole Counsel of God, and tell them; That none shall be refreshed by Christ,
but only those who labor and are heavy laden; Matthew. 11.28.
That they must humble themselves in the sight of the Lord, James 4.10. Prove.
28.13.
if they would have him to lift them up: That none shall have mercy, but such
as confess and forsake their sins: That the mere civil man, and lukewarm
formal Professor, Heb. 12.14. Revel. 3.19.
without holiness and zeal, can never be saved: That all the wicked shall be
turned into Hell, Psalm. 9.17.
etc. In a word, if He take the right course to bring men from darkness to
light, from Satan to the living God; by first wounding with the Law, before He
heal with the Gospel; I say, the most in this Case, are ready to cry out, and
complain, that he throws wildfire, Brimstone and Gunpowder into the
consciences of men.

Conceive therefore, I pray you;

That there is in God; first, His justice; and secondly, His mercy, both
infinite and equal. Only in regard of Man there is an inequality; For God may
be said, to be more merciful unto them that are saved, then just to them
that are damned: For of damnation the just cause is in Man; but of salvation,
it is wholly from grace. Proprietates Dei essentiales sunt realiter ip samet
Dei essentia, and nec ab essentia Dei, nec inter se reipsa differunt: Non ab
essentia, quia sic sunt in essentia, ut sint ipsa essentia: Non inter se, quia
quicquid in Deo est, unum est: a prima autem unitate omnis prorsus differentia,
omnisque numerus abesse debet. Polan. Syntag. Theol. Lib. 2. Cap. 7.
In Himself and originally, they are both equal, and so are all his
Attributes: But in respect of the Proprietates Dei (...) sunt aequales, (...)
inaequales. Alsted. Theol. Didactico Scholast. Sect. 1. Cap. 15.
exercise, and expression upon His creatures, and abroad in the world, there is
some difference. But for my purpose, and our Ministerial emploiment and
Commission, take notice;

That as the revealed effects of Gods mercy, are love, tender-heartednesse,
compassion; His own dear Sons precious hearts-blood, pardon of sins, peace
of conscience, unspeakeable and glorious joy thereupon, Evangelicall pleasures,
comfortable presence of the Spirit even in this life, and in the other World
pleasures infinitely more then the Stars of the firmament in number, even for
ever and ever: And all these upon all true Penitents.

So the revealed effects of His Justice are indignation and wrath, tribulation
and anguish; that Sword, which will devour flesh; those arrows, that drink
blood; that fiery anger, which will burn unto the lowest Hell, and set on fire
the foundations of the Mountains; That coming against, which is with fire and
charets like a whirlewinde, to render anger with fury, and rebuke with flames
of fire; that meeting which is, as of a Bear bereaved of her whelps, to rent
the cause of the heart, and devour like a Lion, etc. All plagues with the
extremity, temporal, spiritual, eternal, all the curses in this Book of
His, all the torments in Hell, to the utmost spark of those infernal flames;
And all these, upon all impenitent sinners. Now God will be glorified both
ways, and by them both:

Give us leave then, to give them both their due:

We are most willing, and ready, as our great Now we his Ministers, His
Almoners to distribute his comforts, even as many, as be in the Scripture,
dare not lavish them out, and promise them to such lazy indifferents as these:
But if we see any ready to faint for want, saying, Give me drink, or else I
die; then we reach the cup of salvation to him, and bid him drink of it:
neither dare we to give it to any other. Rogers of Dedham, Doctr. of Faith,
page 186.
Master in Heaven would have us, Isa. 40.1.2. and our blessed Savior by his
example does teach us; Luke 4.18. To convey by our Ministry into every
truly-broken heart, and bleeding Soul, the warmest blood that ever heated
Christ's tender heart; and to keep back from the true Penitent, not any one
grain of that immeasurable Mine, of all the rich mercies purchased with that
precious blood.

Be content therefore on the otherside, that we open the Armory of Gods
justice, and reveal his wrath from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of Men; That indignation and wrath, Tribulation and anguish,
shall be upon every soul of man that does evil, etc. As we are ever ready to
bind up the bruised spirit with the softest oil of Gods sweetest mercy: So
let us, I pray you, have leave, in the equity of a just and holy proportion, to
wound with the Hammer of the Law, the ha^ry Pate of every One that goes on in
His sin.

Let us deal faithfully even with* wicked men, lest we answer for the blood
of their souls, By telling them; That, as certainly as all the glorious
comforts, and blessed consequents of Gods infinite mercy shall crown the heart
and head of every true-hearted Nathanael for ever: so all the dreadful
effects of his angry Justice will at length seize upon the Souls, and confound
the consciences of all un-holy men with extremest severity, and terror.

Let it be thus then, and let our Ministerial dispensation be in this
manner: If thou be an impenitent Person; I would tell Thee, That the utmost
wrath of God, unquenchable and everlasting vengeance, all earthly and infernal
plagues, are thy certain Portion: But I would mollify and sweeten the
bitterness of this sentence, with assurance of mercy upon Repentance, to
prevent the assaults of despair.

On the other side, If the Ministry of the Word has wrought upon Thee
effectually; and now thy truly-humbled soul thirsts after Christ with a
sincere hatred and opposition against all sin; I would assure thy troubled
and trembling heart in the Word of life and truth, of all those most precious
blessings and sweetest comforts, which the Book of God does promise, and the
blood of Christ has bought: But withal I would commend unto thee some Coolers
and Counterpoisons against presumption, and falling to Pharisaisme.

For which purpose, and for prevention of danger, and spiritual undoing by
unskilful, and undiscreet dawbing in the Case proposed; I come now to tender
such Counsels and Caveats as these, or the like, which the faithful Physician
of the Soul according to occasions, circumstances, and present exigents, may
think fit to be mingled with administration of mercy, and wisely propounded
to the afflicted Party.

It may not prove unseasonable to speak thus, or in some such manner, to thy
spiritual Patient.

1. If these things be truly and soundly so: If thou find and feel indeed
such a mollified and melting spirit, such broken and bleeding affections in thy
bosom; Thou art certainly blessed. If that sorrowful soul of thine does
renounce from the very heart-roote, with special distaste and detestation all
manner of sin; insatiably thirst after righteousness; unfainedly resolve,
for the short remainder of a few and evil days, to bend it self toward
heaven in all New-obedience; I say, if this be syncerely, the holy disposition
and resolution of thine heavy heart, notwithstanding all thy present terror
and trouble of mind, Thou art truly and everlastingly happy. Only take notice
(lest my ministering of mercy be mistaken, or thy conceiving of comfort
mis-carry) that the heart of man is deceitful above all things. A bottomless
depth it is of Falsehoods, dissemblings, hypocrisies. An endless Maze of
windings, turnings, and hidden passages. No eye can search and see it is center
and secrets, but that All-seeing One alone, which is ten thousand times
brighter then the Sun; to which the darkest Nooke of Hell is as the Noonday.
And therefore not I, nor any man alive, can promise pardon, or apply the
promises, but conditionally, upon supposition: If these things be so, and so,
as thou have said. And the syncerity of thy heart, and truth of these hopeful
protestations, which we now hear from thee in this extremity; (and I must
tell thee by the way, such like may be enforced by the slavish sting of present
terror, not fairly and freely flow from a true touch of conscience for sin;
I say, this may be, tho I hope better things of Thee). The truth, as I said,
both of thy heart, and these affectionate promises, will appear, when the
storm is over, and this dismal tempest, which has over-cast and shaken thy
spirit with extraordinary fear, and astonishment, is overblowne. Thy course of
life to come, will prove a true Touchstone, to try, whether this be the
kindly travail of the New Birth; or only a temporary taking-on during the
fit, by reason of the uncouthnesse, and exquisiteness of this invisible
spiritual torture, without true turning to Jesus Christ. If when the
now-troubled powers of thy soul, which the wound of thy conscience has cast
into much distracted and uncomfortable confusion, shall recover their wonted
calmenes and quiet, thou turn unto thine old bias, humor, company and
conversation; it will then be more then manifest, that this Furnace of terror
and temptation, wherein thou now lies and languishes, was so far from working
thine heart to heavenlinesse and grace, that it has hammered it to more
hardness and ungraciousnesse: from purging and refining; that it has
occasioned more earthlinesse, epicurisme and raging affections in sensuality
and sinful pleasures. But if, when thou art up again, and raised by Gods
merciful hand out of the Depth of this spiritual distress, into which the
horrible sight, and heavy weight of thy sins have sunk thee; if then thou
express, and testify thy true-heartednesse in these present solemn
protestations made now, as it were, in thy hot blood; I mean, of thy hatred
against sin, by an earnest opposition, watchfulness, and striving against
all, especially that, which in thine unregenerate time stuck closest to thy
bosom: of thine hunger and thirst after a comfortable fruition of Gods face
and favor, by a conscionable and constant pursuit, and exercise of all good
means and opportunities, of all his blessed ordinances, appointed and
sanctified for groath in grace, and bringing us nearer unto Him: of thy future
New-obedience, and Christian walking, by plying industriously, and fruitfully
with thy best endeavor, and utmost ability, those three glorious works of
Christianity; Preservation of purity in thine own Soul and Body: righteous
dealing with all thou have to doe-with: Holy carriage toward God in all
religious duties. Tit. 2.11* 12.
In a word, by denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and living soberly,
righteously, and godlily in this present world, of which the grace of God
teaches every true Convert to make Conscience. I say, if upon thy recovery,
this be thy course; Thou art certainly New-created. Such blessed behavior as
this, will infallibly evidence, these present terrors to have been the Pangs
of thy New Birth, and thy happy translation from death to life, from the vanity
and folly of sin into the light and liberty of Gods Children.

As concerning sorrow, seeing the causes still remain, namely, corruption and
affliction; therefore this sorrow must continue to our lives end: Tho in a
different manner; now mingled with comfort; whereas the former before Faith
could have none. Whereas on the other side, the sorrow that quite dries up,
was never sound, as it is to be seen in many, who being once deeply
afflicted, and in great heaviness for their miserable state, afterward coming
to some comfort, are grown so secure and senseless, that having no true
grief, or remorse for their daily corruptions, content themselves, that they
were once cast down: whose lives, as they be foul, and full of blots; so
their ends be often fearful; either senseless or uncomfortable: so dangerous
is it to quench the spirit in any pat. Culverwell in his Treat^se of Faith,

153. We are to note, that repentance is a continual course of sorrow; and if
we have this in truth, then may we boldly seek for comfort out of Gods Word,
and from His Ministers, and look what comfort they give us on Earth, the same
shall be sealed also in Heaven. Wherefore as it is requisite continually to
till the ground, if we will have fruit; and daily to eat, if we will live:
so in spiritual things, we must be humbled with continual sorrow, that we
may be refreshed with daily comfort in Christ. Greenham, Sermon. 7. Of
Repentance. I the rather quote these Divines for this Point; to oppose the
wicked and ignorant folly of some ill-tong'd Anti-nomists, and other peevish
and proud Phantasticks.
dying Day. This is my meaning; (for every Christian has not tears at
command: the heart sometimes may bleed, when the eyes are dry). Thou must be
content to continue the current of thy godly sorrow upon that abominable Sink
and Sodom of all the lusts, vanities and villainies of thy dark and damned
time; and also upon those frailties, infirmities, imperfections, defects,
relapses, backslidings, which may accompany thy regenerate state; even until
that body of sin, which thou carries about Thee, be dissolved by the stroke
of death. As concerning thine old sins, and those that are past, it is not
enough that now the fresh horror of them, and those grissely affrighting
forms, wherein they have appeared to the eye of thy wounded conscience, have
wrought upon thy heart, by Gods blessing* some softness, heart-rising, remorse
and hatred: But thou must many and many a time hereafter, in the extraordinary
exercises of renewed repentance, press thy penitent spirit to bleed afresh
within thee, and ^. Sam. 7.6. Hauserunt aquas e pu^eo cordis sui, and abunde
lachrymati sunt coram* Domino, resipiscentes. Chald. Paraph.
draw water again out of the bottom of thy broken heart with those
Israelites, and pour it out before the Lord in abundance of bitter tears, for
thy never sufficiently sorrowed-for abominations and rebellions, against so
blessed and bountiful a God. Now the solemn times and occasions, when we are
called to this renewed Repentance, are such as these:

1. When we are to perform some special services unto God; because then out
of a godly jealousy we may fear, lest the face and favor of God, the love
and light of His countenance may not lie so open unto us, by reason of the
cloudy interposition of our former sins. 2. When we seek for any special
blessing at Gods merciful hands; because then out of a gracious fear we may
suspect, that our old sins may intrude; and labor to intercept and divert
from our longing Souls, the sweet and comfortable influences of the Throne of
grace. It may seem that David in the current of his prayer, saw His old sins
charge upon Him, and therefore cries out by the way; Remember not the sins of
my youth. 3. In the time of some great affliction, and remarkable Cross; when
upon a new search, and strict examination of our hearts and lives; we humbling
our selves more solemnly again in the sight of the Lord, and mourning afresh
over Him, whom we have pierced with our youthly pollutions, and provoke daily
with many woeful failings, are wont to seek Gods pleased face, and our former
peace; sanctification of it unto us in the mean time, and the remoovall of it
from us in due time, in the name of Jesus Christ. 4. After relapse into some
old secret lust, or fall into some new scandalous sin. David's remorse for
adultery and murder, brought his heart to bleed over his birth-sinne, Psalm.
51.5. Above all, upon all those mighty Days of humiliation by prayer and
fasting, public, private, or secret: wherein Gods people wrestle with God by
the omnipotency of prayer, Est quadam precum omnipotentia. Luth.
and work so many wonders from time to time. 6. Some there are also, who
setting apart some special times to confer with God in secret, lay together
before Him, the glorious Catalogue of the riches of His mercy, reaching from
everlasting to everlasting, all his favors, preservations, deliverances,
protections, etc. from their first being, to that time; and the abhorred
Catalogue of all their sins from Adam to that hour, Original, both imputed,
and inherent; actual both before and since their calling; and this they do
with hearty desire of such different affections, as they severally require. A
serious and sensible comparing of which two together, makes sin a great deal
more loathsome, and the mercies of God more illustrious; and so prooves
effectual many times, by the help of the Holy Ghost, to soften their hearts
extraordinarily, to make them weep heartily, and fills their Souls with much
joyful sorrow, and humble thankfulness. 7. Upon our Beds of death. Then
because we take our farewell of Repentance, we should take our fill of it;
because it is the last time we shall look upon our sins for that purpose,
we should dismiss them with utmost, and extremest loathing. At such times, and
upon such occasions as these, and the like, when thou art called to a more
solemn, strict and severe search, and review of thy old sins and former
life, Thou must renew this present repentance of thy New Birth, make thine
heart break again, and bleed afresh with the sight of thy heretofore much
doted-upon, but now most abhorred abominable courses. And so often also, as
thou looks back upon them, Thou must labor to abominate and abandon them
with more resolute aversion, and new degrees of detestation. Those may be, by
the mercies of God, they shall never be able to -- Quntum prin^us ego lum. Hoc
ergo apud beatum Paulum siduciae and consolationis accipite fratres, ut ad
Dominum iam conversos, non nimis cri^ciet praeteritorum co^scientia delictorum:
sed tantum bum^lie^ vos, sicut and ipsum. Ego sum inquit minimus Apostolorum:
qui non sum dignus vocari Apostolus, qui sum persecutus ecclesiam Dei. Ita and
nos humiliemur sub potenti man^ Dei, etc. Bern. Col. 225.
^^ng thee again with the same slavishnesse of guilty horror; yet thou m^st
still endeavor, in thy cold blood to strangle utterly thy former delight in
them, with more hearty additions of deadly hatred; and to be more and more
humbled for them until thy ending hour. It is a very high happiness, and
blessing above ordinary, to be able to look back upon thy choicest youthful
pleasures and pollutions, without either sensual delight, or slavish horror:
with sincere hatred, holy indignation, and hearty mourning.

Now for the time to come, and those sins, which hereafter the
rebelliousnesse of thy naughty nature, and violence of the Devils temptations
may force upon thee; if thy heart be now truly touched, and conscience savingly
illightned, Thou shall find much matter, necessity, and use of continuing thy
Repentance, so long as thy life lasts. In a leaking ship there must be
continual pumping; Et si preces quotidie, quotidie poenitentiam aga^: quod in
antiquis domibus facere solemus, cum fuerint putrefactae, putrida subtrahimus,
and supponimus nova, and a continua cura nunquam desinimus. Chrysostom. Ad pop.
Antioch. Hom. 80.
A ruinous house must be still in repairing: These bodies of death we bear
about us, are naturally liable to so many batteries, and breaches by the
assaults of original sin, and other implacable enemies to our souls, that
there is extreme need of perpetual watch and ward, repenting and repairing,
lest the Newman be too much oppressed, and too often surprised by the many, and
cunning encounters of the old Adam. When thou art in company, solitary, busied
about thy particular Calling, there may suddenly arise in thine heart, some
greedy wish, some gross conceit, some vain, unclean, ambitious, revengefull
thought; ejaculate presently a penitent ^igh, and ^ervent prayer for pardon of
it in the Passion of Christ. In thy family, perhaps amongst thy children and
servants, by reason of some crosse-accident, thou may break out into some
unadvised passionate speech; and disgrace thy self and Profession, by over
hasty intemperate heat, not without some danger of hurting and hardening those
about thee thereby: Get thee presently upon it into thy Closer, or some place
for that purpose; Throw thy self down with a truly-grieved, and humbled Soul
before the Trone of grace, and rise not until thou be reconciled unto thy
God. If at any time, which God forbid, Thou be over-taken with some more
public scandalous sin, or dangerously haunted with some enormous secret
lust; appoint for thy self a solemn Day of humiliation; and then cry unto the
Lord like a woman in travail; and give him no rest, until He return unto
Thee with the wonted favor and calmnesse of His pleased countenance. If
Christians would constantly take to heart, and ply this blessed business of
immediately rising by repentance, after every relapse and fall into sin, they
should find a further Paradise and pleasure in the ways of God, then they ever
yet tasted. This course continued with present feeling, and
after-watchfulnesse, would help excellently, by the blessing of God, and
exercise of Faith, the only Conduit of all spiritual comfort, to keep in
their bosoms that, which they much desire, and often bewail, the want of a
cheerful, bold, and heavenly spirit.

Neither let any here be troubled, because I press the exercise and use both
of renewed and continued Repentance all our life long; as tho thereupon the
Christians life might seem more uncomfortable: For we are to know, that
sorrow according to God, Evangelicall mourning, is If any doubt, how godly
sorrow and spiritual joy may consist together at the same time, in the same
Subject; let them take satisfaction even from Philosophy: De dolor and gaudio
dupliciter loqui possumus: uno modo secundum quod sunt passiones appetitus
scusitivi. Et sic nullo modo possunt esse simul: eo quod sunt om^ino
contrariae, Velex part obiecti, (put a cum sunt de eodem), vel saltem ex part
motus cordis: Nam gaudium est cui^ dilstatione cordis; tristitia vero cum
constrictione. Et hoc modo loquitur Philosophus. Eth. 9. ^^io modo possumus
loqui de gaudio, and tristitia, secundum quod consistunt, in simplici actu

9. Ad secundum.

As in profane joy, even in laughing the heart is sorrowful: So in godly
sorrow, even in weeping the heart is light, and cheerful. Though sin grieve
us, yet our grieving for sin pleases us. As when we see a good man wronged,
we grieve at his wrong, but rejoice in His goodness. Dyke of Repentance, cap. 4.


mingled with abundance of spiritual joy, which does infinitely surpass in
sweetness and worth, all worldly pleasures and delights of sense. Nay, whereas
all the Ioviall good-fellow-mirth of carnal men is but a flash of Hellish
folly; This is a very glimpse of heavenly glory. Let me tell you again, how
sweetly and truly that excellent Divine of Scotland speaks of it: Concedo
quidem illud in ipso m^^rore and dolor piorum plus gaudij inesse, and verae
laetitiae, quam in risuhuius mundi: Nam cum suspirijs inenarrabilibus
coniunctum est g^udium ineffabile. Rolloc in Joan. cap. 11. p. 610.
There is, says He, more lightness of heart, and true delight in the sorrow
of the Saints, then in the Worlds loudest laughter. For unspeakeable joy is
mingled with un-utterable groans. The ancient Fathers are of the same mind
with this Man of God: Godly sorrow, says Quid tristitia molestius? Sed quando
secundum Deum sit, mundi gaudio melior est. In 2. Cor. 7. Hom. 15. Sicut mundi
gaudium tristitiae consortio c^pulatur, ita etiam secundum Dominu^ lachryma
iugem pariunt certamque laetitiam. In Matthew. 2. Hom. 6. Iamque^ste talis, ea
quae videntur cuncta despiciens, in compunctione continua perseverat, largo
assidue flu^^s font lacbrymarum, multamque hinc capiens voluptatem. Ibid.
Chrysostom, is better then the joy of the World. Even as The joy of the World
is ever accompanied with sorrow; so tears according to God beget continual
and certain delight. Again, Such a man as this now (meaning Him whose heart
is inflamed with an heavenly heat) despising all things here below, does
presevere in continual compunction, pouring out abundance of tears every day,
and taking thence a great deal of pleasure. Let the Repentant, says Hinc
semper ^^leat, and de dolor gaudeat. Tom. 4. page 2. De vera and falsa
poenitentia, Cap. 13.
Austin, be always sorrowful for sin, and always rejoice for that sorrow.

3. Beware of two dangerous errors: 1. Either to conceive, that thou may not
admit of any comfort, or apply the promises comfortably; because Thou still
finds in thy self more matter of mourning, and further humiliation. 2. Or to
think; When Thou have on^^ laid hold upon Christ's Person and precious
sufferings, for the pardon of thy sins, and quieting of thy Soul, that then
Thou must mourn no more.

1. For the first, know, That were our heads Seaes, and our eyes Fountains of
tears, and poured out abundantly every moment of our life: Should our hearts
fall asunder into drops of blood in our breast, for anguish and indignation
against our selves for our transgressions; yet should we come infinitely short
of the sorrow and hearts-griefe, which our many and heinous lusts and
pollutions justly merit, and exact at our hands. Therefore we cannot expect
from our selves any such sufficiency of sorrow, or worthiness of weeping for
our sins, as by the perfection and power thereof to win Gods favor, and draw
his mercy upon us. Such a conceit were most absurd, senseless, and sinful,
and would rather discover and taste of natural pride, then true humility, as
they perhaps mistake: tend unhappily to the disgrace of Gods mercies, and
gracing our own merits. True it is; Had we a thousand eyes, it were too
little to weep them all out, for the very vanity of that one sinful sense: Had
we a thousand hearts, and they should all burst with penitent grief, and bleed
to death for the sins of our souls; it were more then immeasurably,
unconceiveably insufficient. For were all this so, Beware thou become not a
Papist, in thinking to merit merely by thy contritio^, etc. it is not thy
contrition, if it had been an hundred times more, could merit pardon of the
least of thy sins. If the Lord Jesus had not suffered infinite sorrow and
grief in Soul and Body for them; it is not all our grieving could satisfy
Gods justice for the smallest offense; no not tho we should weep out our
eyes, and mourn to death. Therefore, tho God has appointed all, to whom he
will show mercy, to be contrite-hearted; yet not to come to mercy thereby, as
by a meritorious means; but as by a convenient and meet disposition, to
prepare us to seek and receive mercy with thankfulness. Rogers of Dea^a^. Of
Faith, page 152. Nonin flatibus nostris, non in actions nostris, sedin Advocati
nostri (...) ^^^tione confidamus. Gregor. in Ezech. Hom. 7.
yet were it not this; but the hearte-blood of Jesus Christ, could make the
Fathers heart to yerne compassionately over us, or purchase pardon, and
acceptance at his hands. Tender therefore unto that poor troubled soul, who
being sorely crushed, and languishing under the burden of his sins, refuses
to be raised and refreshed, endlesly pleading, and disputing against himself,
out of a strong, fearful apprehension of his own vileness and
unworthiness, putting off all comfort by this mis-conceit, that no Seaes of
sorrow, no measure of mourning will serve the turn to come comfortably unto
Jesus Christ: I say, press upon such an One this true Principle in the high
and heavenly Art of rightly comforting afflicted consciences.

So soon as a Man is truly and heartily humbled for all his sins, and weary
of their weight, tho the degree of his sorrow be not answerable to his own
desire, yet He shall most certainly be welcome unto Jesus Christ.

It is not so much the Ad recipiendam gratiam remissionis, necessaria est ex
nostra part contritio fidei and poenitentiae verae: sed quod addit,
(Bellarminus sc.) Neminem scire an suae fides and poenitentia sit talis, and
tanta, quantae a Deo requiritur, falsissimum est. Non enim ex gradu, aut
mensura fidei, vel poenitentiae, depe^det iustificatio, sed exveritate.
Davenant. Expos. Epist. ad Colos. page ^1.
muchnesse and measure of our sorrow, as the truth and heartinesse, which fits
us for the promises and comforts of mercy. Tho I must say this also: He that
thinks, He has sorrowed Si dixisti, Sufficit, Per^sti. August.
enough for His sins, never sorrowed savingly.

2. For the second, which is more properly and specially pertinent to our
purpose; Take notice, That the blood of Christ being seasonably and savingly
applied to thine humbled Soul, for the pardon and purgation of sin, must by
no means damn and dry up thy wellspring of weeping, but only assuage and
heal thy wound of horror. That precious Balm has this heavenly property and
power, that it rather melts, softneth, and makes the heart a great deal more
weeping-ripe. If these be truly the pangs of the New Birth, wherewith thou art
now afflicted; Thou shall find, that thy now cleaving with assurance of
acceptance unto the Lord Jesus, will not so much lessen, hinder, or cease thy
sorrow; as rectify, season, and sweeten it. If thy right unto that
Soule-saving Passion be real; and thou cast thine eye with a believing,
hopeful heart upon Him, whom thou have therein pierced with thy sins (and
those sins alone are said properly to have pierced Christ, which at length
are pardoned by his blood). Thou can not possibly contain, but excess of
love unto thy crucified Lord, and sense of Gods mercy, shed into thy Soul
through his merits, will make thee weep again, and fa^ely force thine heart to
burst out abundantly into fresh, and filial tears. (See how freshly David's
heart bled with repentant sorrow, upon His assurance by Nathan of the pardon of
His sin: Psalm. 51). Thou can not choose, but mourn more heartily
Evangelically, and that which should passingly please Thee, and sweetly
perpetuate, the spring of thy godly sorrow, more pleasingly unto God.

Take therefore special notice and heed of these two depths of the Devil,
that I have now disclosed unto thee:

1. When thou art truly wrought upon by the Ministry of the Word, and now
fitted for comfort; Believe the Prophets; those Ones of a thousand, learned in
the right handling of afflicted consciences, and thou shall prosper. As soon
as thy Soul is soundly humbled for sin, open and enlarge it joyfully like
the thirsty ground, that the refreshing dew and Doctrine of the Gospel may
drop and distill upon it, as the small rain upon the parched grass. Otherwise;

1. Thou offers dishonor, and disparagement, as it were, to the dearness,
and tenderness of Gods mercy; who is ever infinitely more And therefore will
the Lord wait, that He may be gracious unto you, etc. Isa 30.18 Oh thou
afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! Behold, I will lay thy
s^oues with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with Saphires. Cap. 54.11.

He retains not his anger for ever, because He delights in mercy. Hos.
7.18.


ready, and forward to bind up a broken heart, then it to bleed before Him.
Consider for this purpose the Parable of the prodigal Son, Luke 15. He is
there said to go, but the Father ran.

2. Thou may, by the unsettlednesse of thy heavy heart unnecessarily, unsit
and dis-able thy self for the duties, and discharge of both thy Callings.

3. Thou shall gratify the Devil; who will labor mightily by his lying
suggestions, (if thou will not be counseled and comforted, when there is
cause) to detain thee in perpetual horror here, and in an eternal Hell
hereafter. Some find him (...) furiously and mali^iously busy to keep them
from comfort, when they are fitted; as from fitness for comfort.

4. Thou art extremely un-advised, nay, very cruel to thine own Soul. For
whereas it might now be filled with unspeakable and glorious joy, 1. Pet. 1.8.
Phil. 4.7.
with peace that passes all understanding, with Evangelicall pleasures, which
are such, 1. Cor. 2.9.
as neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
of Man, by taking Christ; To which thou have a strong and manifold Calling:
Isai. 55.1. Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the waters, etc. Matthew.
11.28. Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest. Ioh. 7.37. If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
Revel. 22.17. And let him that is a thirst, come.. And whosoever will, let him
take the water of life freely. Yea, a Commandment; 1. Ioh. 3.23. And this is
his commandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus
Christ: And yet for all this, Thou, as it were, wilfully stand'st out, wilt not
believe the Prophets, forsak'st thine own comfort, and lie still upon the
Rack of thy unreconcilement unto God.

2. On the other hand: when the angvish of thy guilted Conscience, is upon sure
ground something allayed, and suppled with the oil of comfort; and thy ^^unded
heart warrantably revived with the sweetness of the Promises, as with marrow
and fatness: Thou must not then, either shut up thine eyes from further search
into thy sins, or Resipiscentia illa non est vera ac solida, quae non
virtualiter continuatur, and actu renovatur subinde, a tempore conversionis ad
finem usque vitae. Amesius Medulla. Theol. Lib. 1. cap. 26.
dry them up from any more mourning. But comfort of remission must serve as a
precious Eye Salve, both to clear their sight, that they may see more, and with
more detestation; and to enlarge their Sluices, as it were, to pour out
repentant tears more plentifully. Thou must continue ripping up, and
ransacking that hellish Heap of thy former rebellions, and pollutions of
youth: still dive and dig into that Body of death thou bear about thee,
for the finding out, and furnishing thy self with as much matter of sound
humiliation as may be; that thou may still grow viler and viler in thine
own eyes, and be more and more humble until thy dying Day. But yet so, That
as thou hold out in the one hand the clear Cristall of Gods pure Law to
discover the vileness and variety of thy sins; all the spots and stains of
thy Soul; so thou hold out in the other hand, or rather with the hand of Faith
lay hold upon the Lord Jesus hanging, bleeding, and dying upon the Cross for
thy sake. The one is sovereign, to save from flavish stings of conscience,
bitterness of horror, and venom of despair: The other mingled with faith,
will serve as a quickening preservative to keep in thy bosom a^ humble, soft,
and lowly spirit; which does ever excellently fit, to live by Faith more
chearefully, to enjoy God more nearly, to apply Jesus Christ more feelingly,
and to long for his coming more earnestly. In a word, to climb up more
merrily those stairs of joy, which are pressed upon us by the holy Prophet,
Psalm. 32. Be glad. -- Rejoice -- and shout for joy, all ye that are upright
in heart.

4. Conceive that hypocrisy may lurk in very goodly outward forms, and
fairest promises and protestations of Selfe-seeming earnest humiliation. Look
upon Ahab, 1. King. 21.27. upon the Israelites, Psalm. 78.3^* 35. I mean not
only gross Hypocrisy, whereby men's false hearts teach them to deceive
others; but also that, which elsewhere I have styled Formal Hypocrisy,
whereby men's own hearts deceive even their own selves. For I make no question,
but the promises of amendment, which many make, when they are pressed, and
panting under some heavy cross, or grievous sickness, proceed from their
hearts; I mean, they speak as they think; and for the present, purpose
performance; who notwithstanding, upon their recovery, and restitution to
former health, and wonted worldly happiness, return with the dog unto the
vomit; and plunge again perfidiously into the cursed current of their
disclaimed pleasures. But by the way, and in a word, to illighten a perplexed
Point, and prevent a scruple, which may trouble true hearts indeed; who hold
truth of heart in their repentances, services and duties toward God, to be
their Peculiar, and a special Touchstone to try and testify the soundness
of their sanctification, the truth of their spiritual states, and a
distinctive Character from all sorts of unregenerate men; and all kinds of
Hypocrisy: I say, purposes and promises made from the heart in the sense, I
have said, with earnest eager protestation, while they are in angvish and
extremity, and yet after deliverance and ease, melt away, as a morning cloud,
and like the early deaw; proceed from hearts, rather affected only with sting
of present horror, natural desire of happiness, mis-conceite, that it is a
light thing to leave sin, and the like; then truly broken and burdened with
sight of their own vileness, sense of Gods displeasure, hatred of
wickedness, and former sensual ways; or enamoured with the sweetness of
Jesus Christ, amiablenesse of grace, and goodness of God, etc. Howsoever for
my purpose, certain it is, and too manifest by many woeful experiences; that
as it often falls out, and fares with men in their corporal visitations, and
outward crosses; to wit, That while the storm and tempest beats sore upon
them, they run unto God as their Rock, and enquire early after Him, as it is
said of the Israelites, Ps. 78.34. But when once, an hot gleame of former
health and prosperity shines upon them again, they hie as fast out of Gods
Blessing into the warm Sun, as they say, from sorrow for sin, to delight
of sense; from seeking God, to security in their old ways: I say, even so it
is sometimes also, with men in aflictions of Soul, and troubles of conscience:
while the agony and extremity is upon them, they take on, as though they would
become trve Converts; both promise, and purpose many excellent things for the
time to come, and a remarkable change: But if once the fit be cover, they
start aside, like a broken Bow; and fearfully fall away from what they have
vowed, with horrible ingratitude, and execrable villainy; having been
extraordinarily schooled and scorched, as it were, in the flames of horror,
and warned to take heed by the very vengeance of Hell. For the former, hear
the experience of reverend Divines: Many seeming, says One, to repent
affectionately in dangerous sickness, when they have recovered, have been
rather worse then before. I would have thought my self, says another, that
many monstrous Persons, whom I have visited, when Gods hand upon them, caused
them to cry out, and promise amendment, would have prooved rare examples to
others, of true conversion unto God: But to my great grief, and to teach ^ee
experience, what becomes of such untimely fruits, they have turned back
again, as an arrow from a stone wall, and as the dog to His own vomit, etc.

For the latter; I could here make it good also by too many experiences, were
it convenient; But I forbear for some reasons, to report them at this time.

I publish this Point, and speak thus; Not to trouble any true Converts about
the truth of their hearts in their troubles of Conscience: Damus, qui
hypocritica and temporaria fide credunt: eos falli, dum putant se ve^e credere,
et non vere credunt. Sunt enim illorum instar, qui somniant, se Reges esse, cum
sint pauperrimi: At negamus illos, qui vera fide credunt, ignorare, an vere
credant, and falti, quum affirmant, and sentiunt, se vere credere. Sunt eium
instar illorum, qui gemma^ m^nu tractant^s, qui^ s^nsu praediti sunt, sciunt,
and aiunt se illam habere. Quod si nemo posset certo n^sse, an vere credat,
necu^: cur ait Apostolus: explorate vosmetipsos, an sit is in fide? -- As ^
quis fidem adhibens alicuius verbis, certo novit se vere illi credere: quanto
magis id is n^vit, qui fide vera donatus d Spiritu Sanct^, credit Evangelio?
Zanch. de Natura Dei, lib. 5. cap. 2.
consciousnesse unto themselves of their New Birth already happily past; their
prizing, and cleaving to the Lord Jesus, unvalewably, unvincibly; their present
New-obedience, new courses, new company, new conversation, etc. makes it more
then evident, that they were savingly mollified and melted in the furnace of
their spiritual afflictions; fashioned and framed by the hand of the Holy
Ghost to be Gods Jewels: But to terrify those miserable men, who having
tasted that transcendent torture of a wounded conscience, dare upon any terms
look-backe again upon the world with delight and doting; and again commit
those sins, which have already stung their hearts with the very terrors of
Hell: Or rather at this time, to teach and tell the afflicted in conscience,
that when the rich treasures of Gods free mercy, and the unsearchable riches of
Christ are opened, and offered unto Him, He drink not so undiscreetly at
first of that immeasurable Sea, as presently to fall into a surfeit of security.
But to prevent mis-carriage in a matter of so unvalew-able moment, let him
rather mingle Motives to humiliation with his Medicine of mercy. Let Him look
well to the grounds, and good speeches, upon which the spiritual Physician is
encouraged to comfort Him, that they shrink not in the wetting, as they say.
Let him fear and attend his own deceitful heart withal narrow watch, and a
very jealous eye. Otherwise that false heart of his, may prove a Depth, to
drown His own dear Soul in the Pit of endless perdition. For in time of
extremity and terror, especially of conscience, it may seem pliable, and
promise fair; and yet when it comes to performance and practice; either
impudently and perfidiously wallowes again in open wickedness, or rests only
in a Form of godliness at the best. Let Him be steadfast in the Covenant, and
then He may be sure, that his heart was upright; and that He did not flatter
with His mouth, or lie unto God with his tongue.

5. Since Thou art now upon terms of turning unto God, taking Profession upon
Thee, and giving up thy Name unto Christ, the blessedest business that ever
Thou went about: Be well advised, consider seriously what thou undertakest,
and cast deliberately beforehand, what it is like to cost Thee. Thou must make
an account to become the Drunkards Song, and to have those that sit in the Gate
to speak against Thee; The vilest of Men to rail upon thee, and the wisest of
the World to laugh at Thee. Thou must be content to live a despised Man,
Matthew. ^0.22.
to be scoft-at, to be hated of all men; To crucify the flesh, with the
affections and lusts; To look upon the world, set out in the gaudiest manner
with all her baits and Bables of riches, honors, favors, greatness,
pleasures, etc. as upon an unsavory rotten We being taken out of the
co^uyti^es of Adam* and ingr^f^ted in Christ^ death, and Passion, can no l^ng^r
live the life of the World, but the life of Christ; and must now look upon the
World* (...) as the World loo^^d (...) upon us (...) shall follow his steps,
to^ it, as upon ^o many abominable, and crucified carcasses. Bishop of
Lincoln, In H. Ser^mon before the Higher House of Parliament, page 21.22.

He does not mean here (to wit, Gal^l. 6.26.) the Heavens or the Earth, says
Saint Chrysostom, nor the World in the ^; but the things of the World, Glory,
Port, Riches, Greatness. (...), all that make a shining and glitteri^g in the
World. These are all but so many carcasses, and a very abomination to a truly
regenerate Man. Idem. Ibid. page 16.17. If we begin to breathe the life of
righteousness, when the world fawnes upon us with Honors, Riches* greatness,
Favors, or frowns upon us with Hatred, Malice, Persecutions, Oppressions, and
the like; we must turn our head aside another way with a godly kind of pride
(as Picus Mirandula was wont to call it) and no more regard her, then a
carcass crucified. page 23.


Carrion: Thou and the World must be as two dead carcasses upon one Beer,
without any delightful mutual commerce, or enter-course; strangers and Et Ego

stark dead one unto another, in respect of thy any further trading with the
vanities thereof. For keeping a good conscience, standing on Gods side, and
Christ's sake, Thou must deny thy Self, Thy worldly wisdom, carnal reason,
corrupt affections; Thy acceptance with the World, favor of great Ones,
credit and applause with the most; Thy passions, profit, pleasures, possibility
of rising, and growing great; Thy nearest friends, dearest companions, ease,
liberty, life: and grow by little and little into Hesters most noble and
invincible resolu^ion, ever when doing Gods will, threatens any earthly
danger; And if I perish, I perish. But not to perish so, is everlastingly to
perish; and so to perish, is to be saved for ever. Thou must thus resolve upon
this Self-denial, when Thou first enters into Profession; or else thou will
never be able to hold out in thy spiritual Building, or conquer in the
Christian Warfare.

(See and consider the occasion, and how earnestly Christ enioynes it: Matthew.
16.24. etc. Luke 14.24. etc. and presses it with two Parables). But all will
come to naught; and thou cursedly conclude in open Apos^acy, gross Hypocrisy*
or Selfe-deceiving Formalitie. Consider the young Man in the Gospel: He came
hastily unto Jesus Christ, and would needs be His Disciple, and follower upon
the sudden. But alas! He did woefully mistake. Little did he know, neither
indeed would know, what belonged unto it: That the servant of such an heavenly
Master must be no earthworme; That every one of his Disciples must take up
their cross and follow him; For his sake, part with any thing, every thing;
be it riches, honors, credit, pleasures, etc. And therefore, when once Christ
for the trial of his heart had bid Him go, and sell that he had, etc. He had
soon done: He was quickly gone. Now had this young Man gone away without this
Lesson, He had gone away a Disciple, as well as any other, and perhaps as
jolly a Professor, as the forwardest of them all; and that both in his own
strong opinion, and charitable mis-conceite of the rest, who were true of
heart. As Judas did a long time, and the foolish Virgins all their life long.
Too many such Professors, as He would have prooved, are to be found, even in
this Noone-tide of the Gospel abroad in the World: who being at their first
entrance into Profession, not soundly humbled, nor laying a sure foundation;
not resolved upon an universal Self-denial; nor weighing with due forecast,
what it will cost them, do afterward behave themselves thereafter upon any
gainefull occasion greater trial, and temptation, or being put to it indeed:
They are wont from time to time to discover their rottenness, open the mouths
of the profane, and shame all. They are like unto Reeds, which in a calm
stand bolt upright, and seem stiff and strong; but let a tempest breake-in
upon them, and they bend any way: While their temporal state is untoucht,
their outward happiness unhazarded; they seem resolute, through, and
courageous; but let a storm of persecution be raised against them; Let them
be put into a great fright, that if they stand to it, they may be undone,
etc. And then they cowardlily hide their heads, pull in the horns, as they
say, and shamefully shrink in the wetting: unhappily holding it better to
sleep in a whole skin, then with a good conscience. Like the Eagle, they
soar aloft with many goodly religious shows and representations; but they
still keep their eye upon the Prey; and therefore when advantage is offered,
they will basely stoop from forwardness, honesty, generosity, humanity, any
thing, to seize upon a worldly commodity, office, honor, some earthly pelf,
and transitory Nothing. Some of these after Profession for some time, fall
quite away from it, and turn Epicures, or Worldlings, if not Scorners and
Persecutors: Others hold-on in a plodding course of formal Christianity all
their life long; and at last, depart this life like the foolish Virgins, and in
that formal manner I told you of before. Neither be thou dis-heartned with
this counsel of leaving all for Christ. For thou shall be no loser, but a
great gainer thereby. Besides, eternal life in the World to come; Thou shall
receive an hundredfold now in this time, as Christ Him self tells thee, Mark.
10.30. If thou part with worldly ioies, thou shall have quiet in the holy
Ghost, spiritual joy unspeakable and glorious, nearer familiarity with God,
deerer communion with Jesus Christ, etc. To which the pleasures of ten thousand
Worlds, were they all extant, were but extremest pain. If thou lose thine
Husband: He that made thee, Isai. 54.5.
will be in his stead unto Thee, Thy Maker is thine Husband, the Lord of Hosts
is his Name. If thou lose thy Father; The All-sufficient Jehovah, blessed for
ever, Psalm. 103.13.
will pity thee, as a Father pittieth his Children. If thou lose thy friends,
and the worlds favor, Thou shall have all and the only excellent upon earth,
Psalm. 16.3.
to love Thee dearly, and to pray heartily for Thee. In a word, If thou lose
all for Christ's sake, He will be unto Thee All in All: Colloss. 3.11.

6. When the spiritual Physician shall see the soil of his Patients heart
well softened with sorrow for sin, comfortably warmed with refreshing beams
of favor from the face of Christ, and so seasonably fitted, for to enter a
Christian course, and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance; let him
throw-in some timely seeds of Zeal, holy preciseness, undaunted courage, and
unshaken resolution about the affairs of Heaven, and in the cause of God; from
such quickening Scriptures, and excellent examples as these, Luke 13.24. Romans
12.11. 12. Ephesians. 5.15. Phil. 1.10.11. Matthew. 11.12. Revel. 3.16. Ruth 4.11.

That it may be happily preserved from the rank and flourishing, but rotten
and fruitless weed of formality and luke-warmenesse. Which pestilent Canker,
if it once take root in the heart, it will never suffer the Herb of grace, if
I may so speak, the heavenly unfading flowers of saving grace, to grow by it,
while the world stands. Nay, and will prove one of the strongest bolts to
bar them out; and the most boisterous cart-rope to pull-downe extraordinary
vengeance upon the head of the Party. For as a loathsome vomit is to the
stomach of him that casts it out; so are lukewarm Professors to the Lord
Jesus, Revel. 3.16. I marvel many times what such men mean, and what
worship, service and obedience they would have the mighty Lord of Heaven and
Earth to have. He offers to us in the Ministry, His own blessed Son to be
our dear, and everlasting Husband; His Person with all the rich and royal
endowments thereof, the glory and endless felicities above, His own thrice
glorious, and ever-blessed Self, to be enjoyed through all eternity, which is
the very soul of heavenly Bliss, and life of eternal life, etc. Do you
think it then reasonable or likely, that He will ever accept at our hands an
heartlesse, formal outwardnesse; a cold, rotten carcass of religion: That we
should serve our selves in the first Place, and Him in the second? That we
should spend the prime and flower of our loves, joys, services, upon some
abominable bosome-sinne; and then proportion-out to the everlasting God, mighty
and terrible Creator, and Commander of Heaven and Earth, only some outward
religious forms and conformities; and those also so far only, as they hurt
not our temporal happiness, but may consist with the entier enjoyment of some
inordinate lust, pleasure, profit or preferment? Prodigious folly, nay, fury to
their own souls! This very one most base, and unworthy conceit of so great a
God, and His due attributions, meriteth justly exclusion from the Kingdom of
Heaven, with the foolish Virgins, for ever. My Counsel therefore is; when the
spiritual Patient has passed the tempestuous Sea of a troubled conscience,
and is now upon terms of taking a new course, That by all means He take
heed, that He run not upon this Rock. It is better to be key-cold, then
lukewarm: and that the milk boil over, then be raw.

7. Tho it be an ordinary, yet it is a dangerous and utterly un-doing error
and deceit, To conceive, that all is ended, when the afflicted Party is
mended; and has received ease and enlargement from the terrible pressures of
his troubled conscience. To think, that after the tempest of present terror,
and rage of guiltiness be allayed and over-blowne, there needs no more to
be done. As tho the New Birth were not ever infallibly and inseparably
attended with new-obedience. As tho, when once the soul is soundly and
savingly struck through, humbled, and prepared for Christ, by the terrifying
power of the Law revealing the foulness of sin, and fierceness of divine
wrath, which set on by the spirit of bondage, is able, like a mighty See Forbes
upon cap. 14 of the Revel, v. 2.
thunder to break and tear in pieces the iron synewes of the most stubborn
and stony-heart, there followed not hearty shewers of repentant tears, never
to be dried up, until our ending hour, as I taught before, when all tears
shall be everlastingly wiped away with Gods merciful hand; And that the Sun
of righteousness did not presently break forth upon that happy Soul, to
dispell the Hellish clouds of sensuality, lust, lying in sin, etc. and to
illighten, inflame, and fill it with the serenity, and clear sky, as it were,
of sanctification, and purity, a kindly fervor of Zeal for Gods glory, good
causes, good men, and keeping a good conscience, and fruitful influence of
sobriety, righteousness and holiness for ever after. And therefore if upon
recovery out of trouble of conscience, there follow not a continued exercise of
Repentance both for sins past, present, and to come, as you heard before; an
universal change in every power and part, both of Soul and Body, tho not in
perfection of degrees, as the Schools speak, yet of Parts; an heart-rising
hatred and opposition against all sin; a shaking-off old companions, brethren
in iniquity, all Satan's good fellow Reuellers; a delight in the word, ways,
services, Sabbaths, and Saints of God; a conscionable and constant endeavor to
express the truth of protestations and promises made in time of terror, as I
told you before, etc. 2. Cor. 5.17.
In a Word, if there follow not a new life, if all things do not become new,
there is no New Birth in truth; all is naught, and to no purpose in the Point
of salvation.

They are then miserable Comforters; Physicions of no value; nay, of notorious
spiritual bloodshed, who having neither acquaintance with, nor much caring
for the manner, means, method, any heavenly wisdom, spiritual discretion,
or experimental skill, in managing aright such an important business; if any
ways they can assuage the rage, and still the cries of a vexed guilty
Conscience, they think they have done a worthy work; Tho after their dawbing,
there be nothing left behind in it, but a senseless skarre; Nay, and perhaps
more brawnednesse, and benummednesse brought upon it, because it was not
kindlily wrought-upon in the furnace of spiritual affliction; and rightly
cured.

I fear me, many poor souls are fearfully There are some will say, They
have felt terror of their estate; but they have out-growne it, it is past:
yea? What have you done with it? Have you broke Prison, or did God let you out?
If you have broke Prison, you must even in again, and that worse then before,
etc. All the counsel, I can give thee in such a case, is to call after these
terrors again, which thou have sought to drive away; and call aloud, ere they
be gone past call; and call quickly, ere thy heart be hardened quite, and
then it will cost double labor. And pray God to work them upon thy heart
again. Rogers of Dedham Doctrine of Faith, page 104.107. A man may have
quietness after trouble, and yet the House not won, to wit from the strong
Man: He may also have some kind of rejoicing; and yet the comforter not there
abiding. That thou may not therefore be deceived, consider the whole course
of thy life, since that time. -- For the holy Ghost will not govern as the
Devil did, they are of so contrary a nature. Touchstone for a Christian, cap.

deluded, who being recovered, out of terrors of Conscience, too suddenly,
unseasonably, or one way or other, unsoundly, conceive presently, they are
truly converted; tho afterward, they be the very same men, of the same company
and conditions, they were before; or at best, bless themselves in the seeming
happiness of an half By this half Herodian conversion, they may leave many
sins, and do many things, hear the best Ministers gladly, respect and
count^nance them, etc. And yet for all this, in respect of their own Personal

conversion.

For a more full discovery of this mischief, and prevention of those miseries,
which may ensue upon this last miscarriage; Let me acquaint you with four or
five Passages out of Pangs of Conscience, which still lead amiss; and leave a
man the Divel's still: And for all his fair warning by the smart of a wounded
spirit, drown Him in the works of darkness, and ways of death.

1. Some, when by the piercing power and application of the Law, their
consciences are pressed with the terrible and intolerable weight of their sins;
and the worm that never dies, which has been all this while dead-drunke with
sensual pleasures, is now awaked by the hand of divine justice, and begins to
sting; They presently with unspeakeable rage and horror, fall into the most
abhorred, and irrecoverable Dungeon of despair. The flames of eternal fire
seize upon them, even in this life; They are in Hell upon Earth, and damned, as
it were, above ground. Such they are commonly, who all their life long have
been contemners of the conscionable Ministry; Scorners of the good way;
Quenchers of the Spirit; Revolters from good beginnings, and Profession of
grace; Harbourers of some secret, vile, abominable lusts in their hearts
against the light of their conscience; close Agents for Popery and
Profaneness; plausible Tyrants against the power of godliness; and such
other like notorious Champions of the Devil, and infamous Rebels to the
highest Majesty. Whom, since they have bin such, and have so desperately, and
so long despised the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and
long-suffering, leading them to Repentance; God most justly leaves now in the
evil day, when once the hot transitory gleame of worldly pleasures is past,
and His judgments begin to grow upon their thoughts, like a tempestuous
storm; and death to stand before them unresistable, like an armed Man; and
sin to lie at the door, like a Bloodhound; and the guilty conscience to gnaw
upon the heart, like a Vulture, etc. I say, then He leaves them in His
righteous judgment to sink or swim, to eat the fruit of their own ways,
to the fullness of that unquenchable wrath; which by their innumerable sinful
provocations, impenitency, and unbelief, they have treasured up against this
Day and wrath. That raging worm, which never dies in the damned, and naturally
breeds in every graceless conscience, by their insatiable surfeit in sin, and
greedy drinking-in iniquity like water, grows so strong, and to such a
strange bigness; that taking advantage, especially in the time of terror, of
their weakness and confusion of spirit upon the Bed of death, at some dead
lift, and irrecoverable danger, it surprises them upon the sudden, with
unexpected Hellish armies of guiltiness and horror; and over-throwes them
quite, horse and man, never to rise again in this world, or the world to come.
Then would those woeful wretches, who would never be warned betime, give ten
thousand Worlds, if they had them, for one moment of that merciful time of
grace, which they have cursedly long abused, for the benefit of the Ministry,
which they have insolently scorned; for a drop of that precious blood, which by
their desperate villainies, and hatred to be reformed, they have trampled under
foot. But alas! no mercy, no blessing, no comfort will then be had; tho with
profane Esau, they seek it with tears, and throw their rufull, and piercing
cries into the air with hideous groans and yelling. And therefore, turning
their eye upon their torments, will roar out like those sinful Hypocrites,
Isai. 33.14. with un-utterable angvish of spirit: Who among us shall dwell with
the devouring ^^fi Assyrius veluti ignis fuit, qui suo ardore terram exureret,
tamen aliquid long atrocius exprimere voluit Propheta: interius videlicei

fire? Who amongstus shall dwell with everlasting burnings? In the Morning they
shall say, Would God it were Even: and at Even they shall say, Would God it
were Morning, for the fear of their hearts wherewith they shall fear; and for
the sight of their eyes which they shall see. In their lifetime they behaved
themselves like cruel Beasts, and bloody Goades in the sides of the Saints,
and against their syncerity; and how at last themselves are caught with a
witness, and lie upon their Beds of extremity and terror like wild Bulls,
and Beasts in a net, full of the fury of the Lord.

Deuteronomy. 28 67.
2. Others there are, who finding their sins discovered, and their consciences
wounded by the light and power of the Word; and now feeling sadness,
heavy-heartednesse, uncouth terrors, much perplexity and anxiety of spirit
coming upon them, address themselves presently, and have speedy recourse to
the Arm of flesh, outward mirth, carnal contentments, and such other
miserable comforters. They falsely suppose, and to their own utter, and
everlasting overthrow, that these spiritual pangs that are now upon them;
which if rightly managed, might prove an happy preparative, and Legal Petard,
as it were, to break the iron bars, and open the everlasting doors of their
Souls, that the King of glory might come in; be nothing but fits of
Melancholy, or sour and unseasonable effects and compressions of some
Puritanicall Ministry, and dangerous temptations to despair. And therefore
they Some men are pricked, and to put away their sorrow, they will go sleep,
they will go sport, they will get to merry company, and pass away the time;
and so, as they term it, they will purge, and drive away the rage of
melancholy: they never go to any Preacher, to ask of the Lord, or at the
mouth of his Spirit: they never respect prayer, nor seek any comfort in the
Word of God. But to put away sorrow on this sort, is to call it again, and to
feel it more freshly either in the hour of death, or in Hell. Greenham, in
Sermon of Repentance. The reprobates in their sorrow run away from God, even
as a Dog from him that whippeth Him. Judas in his terrors ran to the high
Priests, the enemies of Christ, and to the Halter. Cain to building of Cities.
Saul to Music, to a Witch, and at last to His Sword. Dike of Repentance, cap.
3. But alas! the frantic dealing of men in this case is too palpable, and to
be wondered at; when Gods Word strikes upon them; when they feel the
keene-nesse of it; when the threatenings have cut, so that they smart for it;
then they run to dicing, carding, drinking, dancing, etc. as it were of set
purpose to drive away the Spirit of God, that was coming toward them, to
heal their Soul. Whately, Redemption of time, page 62. It is the property of
ungodly men, to remoove the discomforts of their heart by worldly delectations;
As Saul called for Music, when he was troubled with an evil spirit. And to
this purpose, men that be afraid of despair, and love not to be humbled under
the mighty hand of God do, use their wives, their friends, then meat, and
their drink, with all the Pastime that can be devised, to rejoice themselves
withal, that they might put themselves out of their dumpes, as they call it.
Marbur, in His Sermon upon Psalm. 32.
hie out of them as fast as they can, by posting after worldly pleasures,
Pastimes, Plays, Music, Gaming, merry Company, Ioviall meetings of
good-fellowship, Tavernes, Alehouses, Visites, Entertainements, improovement
of their chief carnal contentment, etc. If not to Wisards, and even to light
a candle at the Div^^^ for lightsonmesse of heart. Thus I know not, whether
with more sin or folly, they endeavor to come unto themselves again, by the
mirth and madness of wine, earthly joy, carnal counsel, etc. Wherein they
are not unlike those bloody Israelites, who while they burnt up their children
in sacrifice to Molech, filled their ears with When they sacrificed their
sons to this Idol, they did bear upon Tabrels and Drums, that the cry of
the child might not be heard by the father. Godwins Moses and Aaron, Lib. 4.
Cap. 2.
noise of Instruments; lest by the rufull cries of their little Babes, they
should be moved to pity, and so stayed in the cruel service of that
blood-sucking Idol. Just so these Men of pleasure and perdition, do sinfully
seek to stop the guilty clamours of their vexed consciences with the comforts
of this life, and sensual joy, while their souls are sacrificing to Satan,
and making fit fuel for the fire of Hell; lest by listening to their cries and
controlements, they should be stirred up to take compassion of their own
poor immortal Souls, and stopped in the pursuit of their fugitive follies,
and delights of sense. But alas! in so doing, they are also like a Man in a
burning ^ever, who lets down cold drink eagerly and m^rrily, because in the
extremity of thirst, it cooles Him a little; But after a while, He shall find
the heat, the pain, and the danger all doubled upon Him. Earthly pleasures
may, for the presens, still the noise of in accusing conscience, and seem
somewhat to allay it is guilty ^^ge; but assuredly they will afterward kindle
such a fire in the Bowels of these miserable men, that will burn even to the
very bottom of Hell, and blow them up Body and Soul with irrecoverable ruin
for ever. He that goes about, to cure the wound of his conscience for sin
with sensual delight, is as if, to help the tooth-ake, He should knock out
his brains; or when he is stung with a Waspe, should rub with a Nettle the
smarting place* or finding no good by Physic, should run (...) Wisemen; as
if in extremity of thirst, he should drink rank poison to quench it; apply a
venomous plaster to his sore, and prop up his falling Roof with burning
firebrarnds: Remedies far worse, and more pestilentiall then the Malady; For
they either plunge them deeper into the Dungeon of Melancholy, and
heavy-heartednesse; or else draw a skin only over the spiritual wound,
whereby it festers and rankles underneath more dangerously: For thus stopping
the mouth of that never-dying worm, that insatiable Wolf in the mean time,
does make it, when there is no more supply of carnal pleasures, whereupon it
feeds for a while, to fall more furiously upon the conscience that bred it; and
to gnaw more ragingly, by reason of it is former restraint, and enforced
diversion.

I know full well, Satan is right-well pleased, and does much applaud this
pestilent course of theirs; and therefore He helps forward this accursed
business all he can, of abandoning and banishing all trouble of mind for
sin with worldly toys. For ordinarily out of his cruel cunning, thus He
proceeds in these Cases:

1. In the first Place, and above all, he labors might and maine, to detain
men in that height of hardheartednesse, that they may not be moved at all
with the Ministry, or suffer the Sword of the Spirit to pierce. And then, like
a strong man armed, He possesses their Bodies and Souls, which are his
Contra nos eo vehementius incitator, quo ex cord nostro quast^^ iure propria
habitatlonic expellitar. Greg. in cap. 33. Job. col. 8^^.
Palace, with much peace; and disposes them wholly in any hellish service at
his pleasure. Thus He prevails with a world of men amongst us. They hear
Sermon after Sermon, Judgment upon Judgment, and yet are no more stirred with
any penitent astonishment for sin, or saving work of the Word, then the very
Seats whereon they sit, the Pillars to which they lean, or dead Bodies upon
which they tread. They are ordinarily such as these: First, Ignorants, of two
sorts: first, Vnskild, both in the Rules of reason and religion; Such are our
extremely sottish, and grossly ignorant people, which swarm amongst us in
many places, to the great dishonor of the Gospel, by reason of the want of
Catechizing, and other discipline: secondly, Led by the light of natural
conscience to deal something honestly; but Idiots in the great mystery of
godliness; Such are our merely civil honest men. Secondly, Those that are
wise in their own conceits, Isai. 5.21. Being strongly persuaded of their
good estate to Godward, whereas, as yet, they have no part at al in the first
resurrection. Such as those, Matthew. 7.22. and 25.11. Thirdly all such as are
resolved not to take sin to heart. See, Isai. 28.15. These either, first,
Multum delectat omnes peccatores, and amatores buius seculi, quia misericors
and miserator dominus, quia longanimis and multum misericors. Sed siamas, tum
multa mitia time ibi, and ultimum quod ait, and verax. Si enim vibil aliud
diceret nisi misericors, and miserator Dominus, longanimis and multum
misericors, quast iam convertereste ad securitatem, and impunitatem and ad
licentiam peccatoru^, and faceres, quodvelles, utereris seculo, vel quantu^
tibi permitteretur, vel quantum tibi libido iussisset. Etsi quis te b^ne
monendo obiurgaret, atque terreret, ut cobiberes te ab immoderato luxu, eundo
post coxcupiscentias tuas and deserendo Deum tuum, inter medias voces
obiurgantis obsisteres, impudenti quidem front, veluti audit a divina
authoritate, and legeres de libro Dominico: Quid ni^ terres de Deo nostro? Ille

sed timean^ us ad iudicium Domini. Parcit dum tacet. Tacet, sed non semper

make God all of mercy: secondly, or preserve a secret reservation in their
hearts to repent hereafter: thirdly, or have so prodigiously hardened their
hearts, that they fear not the judgment to come: fourthly, or with execrable
villainy desire to extinguish the very notions of a Deity, by a kind of an
affected Atheism; and being drowned in sensuality, labor not to believe the
Word of God; that they may sin without all check or reluctation.

2. But if it fall out so by Gods blessing, that the Word once begin to get
within a Man, and to work terror and trouble of mind for sin; so that He
sees him grow sensible of His slavery, weary of His former ways, and like
enough to break the Prison, and be gone; then does He seriously observe and
attend, which way the Party enclines, and how he may be easiliest diverted,
that he may thereafter proportion His Plots and Attempts against Him, the more
prosperously.

First, if he find Him to have been an horrible sinner, of a sad and
Melancholic disposition, much afflicted with outward crosses, etc. He then
lays load upon His affrighted Soul, with all his cunning and cruelty; that if
it be possible, He may drive Him to despair. For this purpose He keen's the
sting of the guilty conscience it self, all he can; sharpens the empoysoned
Points of his own fierydarts; adds more grisselinesse to his many hateful
transgressions; more horror to the already flaming vengeance against sin, etc.
That if God so permit, He may be sure to strike desperately home, and sink
Him deep enough into that abhorred Dungeon.

Secondly, But if he perceive Him not to have been infamous and noted for any
notorious sins; By natural constitution, to be merrily disposed; impatient
of heavy-heartednesse, and formerly much addicted to good fellowship: If he
spy him, to strive and struggle for dis-intanglement out of these uncouth
terrors; and re-injoyment of his former worldly delights, and Ioviall
companions: I say, then He is most forward to follow and feed His Intuetur
inimicus generis humani uniu^cuiusque mores, cul vitio sint propinqui, and illa
opponit ante faciem, ad quae cognoscit facililius inclinars mentem: ut blandes
u^ latis moribus sape luxuriam proponat, etc. Greg. in cap. 18. Job. Col. 456.
humou^ (...) way also: that so He may stifle, and utterly extin^^^sh, the
work of the spirit of bondage in the very beginning. And to this end, he
blunts, with all the cun^^^^ he can, the sting of a Man's own Conscience, and
quite remooves his own: He procures and offers all occasions of o^^ward
contentment; He furnishes His Fellows in iniquity, and the Devils proctors
with pernicious eloquence, and store of entisements, to bring him back again
to their bent and beastly courses: He ministers his own delicious (...) of
carnal pleasure, to cast His conscience asleep (...)* In brief, He leaves no
Policy, plot, or practice un-assayed, un-attempted to make the power of the Law
unprofitable unto Him; and to drown all his sorrow for sin in sensual
drunkenness.

This then I make the second pestilent Passage out of pangs of conscience: to
wit, when a man, to decline them, is driven by the subtilty of Satan, and
perverseness of his own flesh, if not to Wisards and Wisemen, as they call
them, and other such Oracles of the Devil; yet at best to humane Helps, to
worldly wisdom, to outward mirth, Good-fellowship, pleasant company, His
heaps of gold, hoards of wealth, riches, Pastures, variety of choicest
Pastimes: nay, for ease to any thing, even to Drinking, dancing, dicing,
Masking, Mis-rule, revelling, roaring, etc. or any other such ribald, bedlam,
and raging fooleries.

3. Some there are, who pass out of trouble of mind for sin, and Legal
terrors, into a kind, as it were, of an artificial, enforced, unsound,
untimely, and counterfeit peace of conscience. I mean it thus, when a Man's
carnal heart, wounded by the terrifying power of the Word, with sight and
horror of his former wicked ways, but weary of the wound, impatient of
spiritual heaviness, wilfully set and resolved obstinately against the holy
severities of the School of Repentance, mortification, godly stricktnesse,
walking with God, etc. And withal meeting with some Dawber with untempered
mortar, who is very ready Ier. 614.
to heal his heart with sweet words, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no
peace; I say in this case, Others have overgrowne them, (He means Legal
terrors) by snatching hold of the promi^e of mercy and salvation, ere it
belonged to them; thinking themselves good Christians, because they had felt
some terrors. -- But the Promise of salvaiton is not straight belonging to
one, that is only terrified for his punishment, but is contrite-hearted for
sin, which is the work of the Gospel, Rogers of Dedham in His Doctrine of
Faith, page 108.
snatches hold of comfort, and applies the Promises of mercy and salvation,
before they belong unto Him: Before He be searched to the quick, sounded to
the bottom, and soundly humbled; Before the spirit of Bondage has, as it
were, it is perfect work, and He kindlily fitted for Jesus Christ. For this
purpose they are wont to wrest, abuse, and misapply many places in the Book of
God; The unskilful Physicions in application; and the deluded Patients in
apprehension of them: Even such as these: Come unto me all ye that labor,
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest: Matthew. 11.28. Yea, but they are
not weary of all their sins, but only troubled with the present terror; nor
willing to take upon them the Cross of Christ: Well enough content they are to
take Him as a Savior to preserve them from Hell, but not as a Psalm. 45.11.

Husband, to serve, obey and love Him. Whosoever shall call upon the Name of
the Lord, shall be saved: Romans 10.13. Yea, but they do not consider, that
many also shall cry, Lord, Lord, Matthew. 7.22. and 25.11. and yet be excluded
from eternal bliss; and therefore all that call savingly upon the Name of
Christ, must depart from iniquity: 2. Tim. 2.19. But they upon recovery, will
by no means depart from their darling delight. He that believes on the
Son, has everlasting life: Ioh. 3.36. Yea, but justifying Faith purifies the
heart, Acts 15.9. fills it with dear affections unto heavenly things, deads it
to the World, and divorces it quite from all former carnal pleasures, and
companion-ship. I will give to Him that is athirst, of the Fountain of the
Water of life, freely: Reu. 21.6. Yea, but they thirst only for salvation, not
for sanctification; for mercy, not for grace; for happiness, not for
holiness, etc. These men, as well as the second sort, will by no means through
the pangs of the New Birth into the holy Path. They wickedly misconceiue out of
the rotten Principles of their own worldly wisdom, prejudice against the
power of godliness, and pestilent persuasions of Pillow-sowers under their
elbowes, that in so doing, they shall be utterly undone, and never have good day
afterward: But, to speak in their own language, fall presently into the hands
of the Puritanes, into the strict tortures, and Hypocritical miseries of
preciseness, into fowrenesse, vnsociablenesse, dumps of Melancholy; and
indeed, into a state, not past a step short of distraction and madness. And
these therefore cast about to get out of trouble of mind, and sense of divine
terror with as great impatiency and precipitation, as the former; only more
plausibly, and with seemingly fairer, but truly false satisfaction to their
own Souls. For the former rush with furious indignation out of these
spiritual dejections of Conscience, as unmanly fears, not fit for worthy
spirits, and men of Ioviall resolution, into greater excess, and variety of
worldly delights, and sensual looseness; and so ordinarily become afterward
very notorious, and more desperate enemies to the Kingdom of Christ: Because
the power of the Word has once stung their carnal hearts with some
remorsefull terror, they ever after heartily hate the sound and searching
Ministry, and managers thereof, the Inflicters of their smart; for no other
reason in the world, but that they tell them the truth, and thereupon torment
them before their time; that so, if they be not wanting unto themselves, they
may escape the torments of eternity hereafter. And they set themselves against
godly Christians with incompatible estrangement, and implacable spite; only
because they are Professors of Self-denial, holy strictness, inconformity
to the world, repentance, mortification, etc. the entertainment and exercise
whereof they furiously more detest and fly from, then the death of their
Bodies, and damnation of their Souls. But these latter, pass more plausibly
out of trouble of conscience, and take a fairer course of the two, tho it
prove but an imaginary and counterfeite Cure. For they labor to close up
their spiritual wound, with comfort out of the Word; and promise peace to
their troubled hearts from the promises of life: But herein they fail, and
fearfully deceive themselves, in that they conceive, the first fits and
qualmes, as it were, of Legal terror, to be saving repentance; a general
speculative apprehension of Christ's Passion, to procure a special pardon for
all their sins; fruitless speculations of Faith to prevent and secure them
from the wrath that is come; a mere verbal profession to be forwardness
enough, except a Man would be too precise. Upon the first fright, and feeling
the smart of a confused remorse and horror for sin, without any further
penitent wading into Particulars, or thorow-search into their hearts, lives,
consciences, and Callings; without suffering the work of the spirit of
Bondage, to drive them to Christ, and a resolution to sell all, etc. They
presently, hand over-head, apply by the strong delusion of their own idle
groundless conceit, all the gracious promises and privileges of Gods Child
to their un-humbled Souls; and enforce their understandings by a violent
greedy error, to think they are justified by such an artificial heartles
Notion, which they falsely call Faith: and so resting in a counterfeite
persuasion, that they are true Converts, ordinarily turn And let not these be
weary of the yoke of God and the Law, and make overmuch haste out of this
state, for so may they undo themselves: For as some withstanding their
terror, have withstood their salvation; so some have by hastening out, made
waste of all; and being impatient of being in this case, and over-willing to
catch hold of the promise straight, have prooved but loose, unsound and
unsavory Christians in time, which if they had tarried the Lords leisure in it,
might have come to sound and true comfort, which would have continued all their
days. Rogers of Dedham in his Doctr. of Faith, page 110.
carnal Professors.

Who are a kind of people, who have no more spiritual life, then a dead Faith
can infuse into them: No more comfort in the communion of Saints, then an
outward correspondence in Profession, speculative Discourses of religion, and
meetings at the Means can yield: No more interest, or right to Heaven, then a
bold presumptuous confidence; built first upon their own wilful fancy, and
seconded with Satan's lying suggestion, can give them. Whose sorrow for sin at
the most, is commonly no more, then afflicting their Souls for a Day, and
bowing down their heads like a Bul-rush, without loosing the bands of
wickedness, or departing from iniquity. Whose conversion is nothing, but only
a speculative Passage from a confused apprehension of sin, to a general
application of Christ; without any sensible, or saving alteration in their
ways. Whose New-obedience consists only in a formal conformity to outward
exercises of Religion, without all true Zeal, life, heartinesse, holiness, or
indeed honest dealing with their Brethren. But these men are to know, that
Christ's blood never pardoned any man's Soul from sin, whose spirit the power
thereof did not purge from guile. It never saves any one from Hell, whom it
does not first in some good measure season with holiness and heavenly life. In
vain do they build comfort upon his Passion, who do not conscionably
conform to the practice of his Word. And let them further be informed for a
more clear discovery of their gross and damnable Selfe-deceit; that howsoever
a dead Faith, according to it is name and nature, enters (if it has any entitie
at all) into the understanding, without any remarke-able motion, sense and
alteration; yet that Faith, which truly justifies, pacifies, purifies,
mortifies, sanctifies, and saves, is evidently discernable, by, first, Many
stirring Preparatives; Sight and sense of a Man's miserable state by nature, of
his sinfulness and cursednesse; Humbling himself in the sight of the Lord,
fearful apprehensions wrought by the spirit of bondage; Illumination,
conviction, Legal terrors, etc. Secondly, Violent affections about the
infusing of it, which are wont to be raised in the humbled heart by the Holy
Ghost; extreme thirst, inflamed desires, vehement longings, un-utter-able
groanings of spirit, prizing and preferring the Person and Passion of Christ,
before the Possession of infinite Worlds; willingness to sell all, to part
with any thing for Him, tho never so dear, or so much doted upon heretofore;
with pleasure, riches, preferments, a right hand, a right eye, liberty, life,
etc. Nay, if in such a Case, if even Hell it self should stand between Jesus
Christ and a poor Soul, He would most willingly pass through the very flames
thereof to embrace His blessed crucified Lord, in the arms of a lively Faith.
Thirdly, inseparable consequents and companions: first, an hearty and
everlasting falling-out with all sin: secondly, sanctification thorowout, in
Body, Soul, Spirit, and Calling, and in every power, part and passage thereof,
tho not in perfection of degrees, as they say, yet in truth and effectually:
thirdly, A set and solmne course of New-obedience, spent principally in
Selfe-sobriety, righteousness toward our Brethren, and holiness toward God.

Many unfaithful men in the Ministry, both in their public teaching, and
private visitations of the sick, have much to answer-for in this Point: who
for want of skill in that highest Art of saving souls, of familiarity with
God, and secret workings of his Spirit, of experience in their own change, and
of the spirit of discerning, etc. many times concur with such miserable men
to mar all, in stife-ling the very first stirrings of Legal remorse, by
healing the wounds of their conscience with sweet words, before they be
searched, and sounded to the bottom; and by an unseasonable and undiscreet
heaping a great deal of comfort there, where as yet, a good groundwork of
true humiliation is not soundly laid. Many and lamentable are the spiritual
miseries in those Places, where such Dawbers with untempered mortar domineere;
who never passed through the Pangs of the New Birth themselves, were never
feelingly acquainted with the wonderful dealings of God in that great Miracle
of a Man's conversion; nor trained up experimentally in the School of
temptations, painful exercises of mortification, and counter-minings against
the Depths, Wiles, Devises, and stratagems of the Devil. The blessed Prophet
paints them out to the life, and denounces a dreadful woe against such
flattering and foolish Prophets, Ezech. 13. A Ship-Master skillful only in
Astronomy, and other speculative Passages of the Art of Navigation, is no body
in conducting Men safely over some dangerous Sea, to Him, that besides
sufficiencies of Art, is furnished also with experimental skill in those Parts,
by passing formerly that way Himself, and having discovered those dangers of
ruin, and hidden Rocks, which the other Man might easily run upon. Give me
a Man, in whom variety and profoundnesse of best learning does concur in the
highest degree of excellency, yet if his own heart be not soundly wrought
upon, and seasoned with saving grace, Himself experimentally seen into the
Mystery of Christ, and Secrets of sanctification, as He shall be hardly able
to wound other men's consciences, and pierce them to the quick; so He will be
found very unfit to manage aright the spiritual miseries of a troubled Soul;
and to transport it savingly through the tempestuous terrors and temptations
incident to the New Creation, into the Port of true peace, and Paradise of the
blessed Brotherhood. A right dreadful and tender Point it is, to deal with
distressed consciences; so many depths of Satan, and deceits of Man's heart
mingle themselves with business of so great consequence. Even a well-meaning
Man without much heedfulnesse, and good experience both in the Point, and the
Party, may err dangerously, and be much deceived herein. I have heard from a
Man of conscience and credit, besides many and many in the same kind, of a
fearful imposture to this purpose: A man, who for the world was well enough,
visited with some trouble of mind for his sins, sent for a Minister to
minister comfort. He, it seems, not sounding Him to the bottom, or searching
to the quick, heaped upon Him unseasonably, and too soon, mercies, and hopes
of spiritual safety. Amongst other things, He asked Him, whether formerly,
He had ever felt testimonies and refreshings of Gods favor, and love; Yea,
answered the Party; [and here take notice of a notorious depth of the Divell]
Once riding alone upon the way in such a Place, I grew upon the sudden, very
lightsome, and light-hearted, etc. [This was but a flash of Satan's Angelical
glory, cunningly to lighten and lead him the way to further confusion]. Why
then, replied the Minister, you may build upon it. God is constant in His
favors; and whom He loves once. He loves for ever. Hereupon the Patient was
presently healed of his wounded heart, and after fell unto his former courses,
and grew fully as profane, as He was before. Amongst the many important
Passages of our Ministerial employments, I fear me, this Cum nunquam
graevioribus tentationibus expositi sint hominesquam dum infirmitati, bus
exer^entur, aut aegrotant, morbis cum animi, tu^ corporis fracti; nunquam sane
conven^t Pastores ecclesiarum saluti suae gregis invigilare accuratius, quam in
huiusmodi morbis and infirmitatibus. Harmon. conf. pa. 1. Helvet. Conf. cap.
25. page 80.
weighty affair of visiting the sick, is passed-over also (more is the
pity!) with much ignorance, slightness and neglect. It is incredible to
consider, how fearfully many offend, and what a deal of hurt they do, by
observing one plodding general form, and that a poor one too, toward all
Patients promiscuously: without any judicious discretion in distingvishing the
variety of spiritual states, the different degrees of unregeneratenesse,
former courses of life, etc. Commonly their carriage in such Cases is the same
to the notorious sinner, the mere civil Man, gross Hypocrite, carnal
Gospeller, formal Professor, Back-slider; the weak and strong; the tempted
and untempted Christian. If they but hear from the sick Man a general
acknowledgement of his sins, formal cries for mercy and pardon, earnest
desires to die the death of the righteous, etc. which may be easily, and
ordinarily found in a Pharisie, or foolish Virgin, as you have heard before;
they will presently needs threape Him down, that He is as sure a saved Man, as
if He were in Heaven already. Herein resembling, says Upon Psalm 22. page 5.
Marbury, a foolish Shepherd, who wanting skill to help his poor sheep out
of the ditch, is driven to play the miserable comforter; and to take some other
indirect course (as many use to do in such case) to cut the sheep throat in
time, to make him Man's meat; left it should be said, He died in a ditch.
Many and many a time do such fellows as these, empty and discharge their
Commonplace Books of all the Places of mercy and comfort, collected
curiously, and industriously for that purpose, upon those Men; who were never
acquainted with the ways of God in their lifetime, nor with the truth of
humiliation, or truly with the great work of Repentance upon their Beds of
death.

Those formal Churchmen, who stood about Marshall Biron, that great Peer and
Pillar of France, at his death, did in this respect very ill offices of Ghostly
Fathers unto Him in his greatest need, and last extremity. For when He
behaved himself more like a Voisin said unto Him, that he had too much care
of his Body, which was no more his own. He turned to Him in choler with an
oath, saying; I will not have him (meaning the Executioner) touch me, so long
as I shall be living: if they put me into choler, I will strangle half the
company that is here, and will force the rest to kill me, I will leap down,
if you thrust me into despair. History of France, page 1049.

furious Devil, already amongst the damned spirits, in blasphemies
impatiencies, and most raging passions, then a meek and humble Saint of God,
ready to pass into everlasting Mansions of peace; they notwithstanding out of
their Popish divinity, gave him this absolution, assuring Him that His soul
was ready to see God, and to be Partaker of his glory in Heaven. When it had
been far fitter to have driven him to the sight of his sins, sense of that
dreadful hour, terror of that strict Tribunal, to which he was ready to
pass, and fearfulness of that infernal fiery Lake, from which no greatness
can privilege graceless Men. I fear me, there are many Trencher-Chaplaines
of the true Religion, also, who are ready to do proportionable service, to
ungodly great Ones, upon whom they depend, by promising them life. But many and
dreadful are the mistakings and miseries, which fall upon the Souls of Men,
both Patients and Bystanders, by these flattering, formal visitations, and
Funeral Panegyricks, which ordinarily follow after. Happy then, and hopeful
is that Man, who in the troubles of His Soul meets with that Siquidem multis

An hundred to one then, These Ones of a thousand are never to be found amongst
worldly-minded and ambitious Ministers, negligent Ministers, or those that are
ignorant: But amongst the most skillful, searching, and spiritual, of such as
are faithful. As appears by this ancient Passage in Austin.
One of a thousand, Job 33.23. with those Sons both of Consolation and
thunder; who are as able, ready, and willing, rightly to bind up a bruised
spirit with the Baulme of mercy, and promises of life, as to break in pieces a
stubborn heart with the terrors of the Law. Who, as they labor in the first
Place to fright and fire men out of their sinful courses, into penitent
dejections of Conscience, a needful preparative to a saving conversion; so
they have learned both speculatively and experimentally, to conduct them through
the Pangs of the New Birth, to sound comfort in Christ, mortification,
New-obedience, walking with God, etc.

4. Others there are, who pass out of trouble of Conscience for sin, into
some more tolerable courses for the time to come; but yet not thoroughly, and
savingly into the truth and Trade of Christianity. For when Satan once
perceives, that sorrow for sin lies so heavy upon a Man's heart; and the rage
of guiltiness does sting him still with such restless angvish, that in all
likelihood, it will at length draw and drive him to some alteration at least,
and work out at last some measure of amendment; then does he out of an
insatiable hellish thirst to hold him still in his clutches, bend and employ
all his power and policy, to make him satisfy himself; and rest finally, as
sufficiently fitted for salvation, in some partial, insufficient,
halfe-conversion; and to sit down contentedly with religious forms only, and
some outward reformation. The Devils first desire in working our destruction,
is to keep a Man notoriously naught, in the highest strain of impiety. A
Traitor in grain, as it were, and most desperate Rebel to the divine
Majesty, wallowing still in all variety of villainy and vanity. But if that will
not be, He is glad to detain him, in what degree of profaneness, he can
most conveniently and with greatest safty, tho the least and the lowest; in any
state of unregeneratenesse, tho furnished with the utmost perfections, ^f which
it is capable; so that He step not into the Kingdom of Christ. Rather then
He will utterly lose him, and part with Him quite, He will leave possession
of Him in part; and be willing, tho full sore against his will, to lose a great
deal of his former more furious service; and something of the fulness of his
conformity to the fashions of Hell, If He cannot do as he would, He will
do as he may, as they say. When He sees him grumbling and grow discontent,
and weary with the loathsomeness of the Dungeon, and weight of his fetters;
rather then He should escape, and break quite away; He will knock off some
of his irons, grant him the liberty of the Prison, the comfort of the walks;
nay and suffer Him sometimes to walk abroad, so that He be still watchfully
attended by his Keeper; and continue a Retainer to the kingdom of darkness.
He will be content, to give him the benefit of the fewest stripes in Hell,
and the least measure of damnation; tho that also be more then infinitely
terrible, and intolerable, rather then He should be undamned at all. And
therefore in such a Case, He will easily suffer Him to proceed to some kind
of Repentance; and reformation, of some one or more outward gross notorious
sins; remorse whereof, perhaps, did first raise the terror and trouble in
his mind; so that He will there rest, and remain unmortified and unamended in
the rest. Or, He cares not much, tho He be universally, outwardly reformed;
and unblameable, for the most part, in his visible carriage, and conversation;
Tho He restore ill gotten goods with Judas; say his prayers, give alms, fast
often, give tithes of all that He possesses, with the Pharisee; hold out a Lamp
of goodly profession to the eye of the world, with the foolish Virgins;
observe godly Ministers, reform many things after their Preaching, and hear
them gladly, with Herod; So that for all this plausible and unpernicious
outside the heart continue unchaste, impure, unholy, unheavenly still; and He
still hug in his bosom, some secret lusts and sensual corruptions, with
willing delight, and loathnesse to leave them. Or, if a man, besides outward
religious representations, and conformities, desires also to find and feel in
Himself some kind of inward work; He will not be much troubled with
addition of the spirit of Spiritualis benedictio duplex est; una imperfecta and
manca, aliera, perfecta and plena, omniaque spiritualia dona comple^iens. Ill^i
priori multi etiam reprobi donantur. Talis enim benedictio, est Fides
temporaria, aliqua vera Dei cognitio, gustus aliquis Spiritus Sancti, aliquod
initium honestae vitae; and id genus alia Dei dona, De quibus Apostolus
scripsit, ad Heb 6. Zanchius in 1. ad Ephesians. v. 3. Some Temporaries besides
profession, are moved at the Word, affected with some kinds of grief at such
Doctrines, as serve to moove grief, and joy in that, that mooves joy; yea,
also reform many things, cut away outward evils, take up many good duties
public, yea, and private, and yet fall short. -- Men may have great knowledge,
assent, Profession; yea, excellent gifts, and shows of every grace (and go a
great way, to the deceiving of themselves, and many others); and yet for want
of particular apprehension of Christ, they are not planted into Him, have no
sap of grace and sanctification. Master Rogers of Dedham in His Doctrine of
Faith, cap. 1. page 8.9.
illumination, temporary Faith, some Matthew. 13.20.
joy in the Word, Heb. 6.5.
taste of the powers of the World to come, etc. So that the spirit of special
sanctification be wanting still, and that some darling delight be maintained
in heart, life, or calling; which the Man by no means would have meddled with,
or mortified. Or that, which is a notable Depth of the Devil, of which take
special notice: Whereas a Man hears many times out of the Ministry of the
Word; that the abandoning of his bosome-sinne, is a good token of a true
conversion; and the embracing of it still, is too sure a sign, that he is
Satan's still: To the end He may blind Him in this important Point; He will
suffer Him to exchange the visible form, and outward exercise even of His
beloved sin. For the purpose; A man's Captain and commanding sin, is
covetousness; and it is outwardly exercised in usury, bribery, sacrilege,
etc. He is well enough content in this Case, to let Him be frighted by the
terror of the Ministry, from those grosser acts of cruelty, for which the
World cries shame on Him, (especially not restoring); so that He insensibly
fall unto, and sec^etly practice some other cunning invisible oppressions, or
any unlawful ways of getting. His sweet sin is voluptuousness; He hunts
after it in the horrible villainies of adultery, or fornication; But at some
Sermon or other, He is told and terrified; That by such sins He does not
only damn Himself, but also ever draw another to Hell with Him, etc.
Whereupon He may grow into a slavish distaste, and dis-continuance from them;
and Satan will not say much, so that there succeed in their rooms, some other
kinds of uncleanness; perhaps immoderate abuse the marriage, without any
check, or remorse; or some other secret, Selfe-abominations, not to be
conceived without horror, much less to be named. Nay, He will yet yield
further, and endure an utter cessation from the external acts, and visible
practice of a Man's predominant and reigning sin; so that he delightfully
feed upon it still in his heart with speculative greediness; and spend the
strength of his affections, and the most of His thoughts that way. He will
give Him leave to leave off His Usury, and to call-in his money, (but
ordinarily ever without restitution) so that he may hold his heart still
exercised with covetousness. He can well enough abide, abandoning the gross
acts of uncleanness; so that He lie frying in the flames of his own
scorching concupiscence; and consume his thoughts in the adulteries of the
heart, and contemplative filth. O the endless Maze, unfathomed Depths, and
deepest malice of that old red Dragon! He will yield unto any thing, take in
the very darkest Nooke of Hell, for some cunning Devise, rather then part with
a precious Soul out of his Hellish Paw. If a Man be so haunted with horror
of conscience, that he dare not for his life lie any longer in his
notoriousnesse, but will needs into some new course; He can put him into many
new fashions, and yet no New Birth, no New-man. He will suffer him to pass
into a more tolerable conversation, and yet come short of a true conversion.
He can afford him a moral Change, or a formal Change, or a mental Change; I
mean it only in respect of the spirit of illumination, and general graces;
or a temporary Change, (of which see My Directions for walking with God, page
310.) And yet continue him still within the confines of His cursed kingdom,
and in a damnable state. He does improove to the utmost, as occasion of
advantage is offered, both the grisseliest shape of a foul Fiend, and the most
alluring light of His Angelical glory; to do us a mischief any way, either
upon the right hand, or the left. How many thousands, Ah pity! even in this
clearest Noone-tide of the Gospel, does He keep in a presumptuous
confidence, that they are converted; and yet most certainly his own still,
and in a willing slavery to some one or other predominant Lust at the least?
Be advised then in the Name of Christ, whosoever thou art, when the hand of
God, great mercy, shall visit and vex thy conscience for sin, by the piercing
power of the Ministry: Be sure to follow the direction and guidance of that
blessed hand, without dawbing or diversion, out of the kingdom of darkness,
through the Pangs of the New Birth, into the holy Path, wholly and for ever.
Make sure work, whatsoever it cost Thee; Thousands lose their Souls, by
thinking less will serve the turn, then will. If One would buy a Jewel of
five hundred pounds, and will give but four hundred for it, he might as well
bid nothing. Nay, the doing something in Christianity, and not going
thorow-stitch, hardens a Man by accident. Where, were there nothing but
notoriousnesse, it might serve to humble us. Because Satan cannot keep us
quite from Religion, He deals with us, as we with our children; when they
cry for pieces of gold, we still them with Counters and Rattles. DIP. Many a
man loses a great deal of labor, and his soul too, for want of a little
more added; A small thing parts God and them: Many a time they lose heaven for
one lust; as Judas for his covetousness: God has set down, that he will not
abate a hairs breadth of his price, and they think they offer fair, and will
go no further; if this will do it, they will go on with their bargain, else
not* etc. -- Tho the Temporary offer fair, yet he will not come up to the
Lords price. O be not so unwise, lose not all this labor you have taken, in
hearing, reading, praying, professing; and it may be, have been called
Puritan, and been hated for your well-doing, and yet lose your soul for a
little more. Master Rogers of Dedham, Doctrine of Faith, cap. 1. page 13.14.
How near come some, that yet shall never have Christ and salvation? They lose
Heaven for some lust; If they could but yield up that One thing that was
wanting, it might have been a bargain Ibid. cap. 2. page 188.
Have never any thing more to do with the Devil; Give over the Trade of
sinning quite, never more to turn agains unto Folly upon any terms. And if
Satan set upon Thee with baits and allurements, to detain Thee in his
spiritual Bondage, but by one darling delight, to which thou have been most
addicted: Answer him in this Case with an un-shaken resolution, as Moses did
Pharaoh in a Point of temporal Bondage; Exodus 10.26.
There shall not so much as an hoof be left behind. Yield not an hairs
breadth upon any condition to that Hellish Pharaoh, especially in so great a
matter, as the endless salvation, or damnation of thy Soul. If he can keep
possession but by one reigning sin, in which thou lie with delight, against
the light of thy conscience, hating to be reformed; He desires no more. One
knot in a thread will stay the Needle's Passage, as well as five hundred, etc.
See to this purpose my Directions of walking with God, page 34. Beware then of
closing up the wound of thy terrified and troubled conscience with any
outside, half, or unsound conversion: which I make the fourth Passage, out of
trouble of mind for sin.

5. And why may not Satan sometimes, by Gods permission, be suffered to
inflict, and fasten his fiery darts of terrors and temptations upon a man's
conscience; continue them there some while with much angvish and horror, for
some secret holy end seen, and seeming good to divine wisdom; and at length
remoove and retire them, not upon succession of any sound comfort, or true
peace, from the promises of life, and pardon of sin; but only upon a mere
cessation of the Devils pleasure to torment, and terrify any longer? Not that
He can hurt the least, or most contemptible creature that ever God made, when
He please: but that it pleases God sometimes to give him the raines, and leave
to rage. Quieting the conscience in this Case, is no comfortable cure from
positive help: but a counterfeite palliation by ceasing to hurt. See Satan's
proportionable practices in matters of Witchcraft, in Giffards Dialogve
concerning Witches and Witchcrafts, page 11.

6. Nay, Let me here further, before I pass out of the Point, discover unto
you a mystery, but it is of iniquity and horrible Hypocrisy. I have known
some (would you think it?), who have As Divines affirm, that an Hypocrite may
have shows of every grace. See Master Rogers of Dedham, Doctr. of Faith* cap.
2. page 8. And do outwardly all things which true Christians do. See Perkins
in his Treatise; How far a Reprobate may go, and feign, whatsoever Gods
children do faithfully. Novimus hypocritas ea fingere comnia, quae fideles
vere efficient. Chamier. Tom. 3. lib. 13. cap. 20. sect. 5. So I doubt not, but
He may represent outwardly even the dejections, complaints, and sad behaviors
of One truly troubled in Conscience. And that so cunningly, that He may for a
while deceive judicious Ministers. Some Painters have had such a gift in the
lively expressing of the forms of Birds and other Beasts, that true Birds and
living Beasts have been deceived in taking them for their Mates. But the
Hypocrite puts down the Painter: for by his glozing, and glistering shows in
all outward works, he does so perfectly resemble the true Christian, that he
deceives, not as the Painter, silly Birds, but reasonable Men; yea, learned
and experienced Christians. Dike in his Discovery of the deceitfulness of Man's
heart, cap. 2 page 29. Nay, may he not therein out-goe them? As false gold in
glistering goes beyond true; and hired mourners in lamentation beyond the
deceased Parties own friends; and fawning flatterers in outward complements of
friendship, beyond true friends themselves: So may Hypocrites in outward works
seem to carry it away from the soundest Christians Ibid.
counterfeited even trouble of Conscience; and made show, with out all truth or
true touch, of sundry temptations, and spiritual distempers, incident only to
the Saints. And have for that purpose addressed themselves with much industry and
noise; and had recourse many times to some spiritual Physicians, with many
tears, an heavy countenance, and other rufull circumstances; expressing almost
exactly the scruples, doubts, distrusts, complaints of such as are truly
grieved in spirit, and true of heart. O the wonderful Depth, which lies hid
in the confluence of the Hypocrisies of man's false heart; and the Devises of
that old Revel. 12.9.
Serpent, which deceives the whole world! Such as these, take upon them, and
lay aside terrors of conscience, as Hypoc i^a, hoc est histrio, vocatur is,
qui in Theatro a^enam personam sumit. -- sic and in hac vita ad suos mores
orchestras atque theatrum exerc^nt (...), qui alia cord gerentes, alia
exirmsecus hominibus prae se^serunt. Basil. Sermon. 2. De ^e junio.
Players do their apparel and Parts.

7. The passages past do all mislead into Bypath: but there is One blessed
way, besides all these, tho it be a narrow One, which conducts directly out of
a natural state through the pangs of the new birth, with out diversion, or
dawbing; with out any longer detainement in any lust, sensual pleasure or
beloved vanity; in any kind of hypocrisy, or degree of unregeneration, into
the Paradise of grace fully and for ever. This neither plunges a man into the
Pit of Despair, nor misguides him by carnal counsel, and his own wicked
conceit, into the fools Paradise, and tastlesse fooleries of outward mirth;
nor pacifies unseasonably with untimely and counterfeit peace; nor leaves in
the deceiving forms of an unsound conversion, and unsaving flourishes of
general graces only, etc. But convaies and transports him happily, by an
universal, sincere, supernatural, thorow-change into the holy Path: And that
thus, and by such degrees as these:

1. The first is an Illumination of the mind, conviction of the conscience,
terryfying the heart with sight, sense and horror of sin in some true
measure. The first work of the Spirit John 16.8. is to convince of sin; which
presupposes illumination, and produces terror. The Spirit of bondage must be
first set on work, to show us our spiritual misery, to humble us to prepare
for Christ. And yet this work in it self, is common to the Alien, with the
child of the New Birth. And ordinarily here they part: The Alien and he that
hates to be reformed, out of an inveterate, unhappy prejudice against the
saving preciseness of the Saints; and ^othnesse to leave utterly his former
courses, company, conversation, being obstinated against passing on forward
into the way, which is called holy; (Regeneration, the new birth, Repentance,
mortification, sanctification, self-denial, New-obedience, walking with God,
turning Puritan, as they say, etc, are terms perhaps, of as great terror unto
him, as his present trouble of conscience) does now here divert, and afterward
wilfully and woefully perish in some pestilent or plausible By-path. In this
case he labors and lays about him for ease any way, (yea sometimes he will
have it from the Devil himself, if he can, by the help of a Wizzard, rather
then miss of it) so that he may attain and keep it, without any great
alteration of his former ways, or especially, without parting with his darling
pleasure. And therefore he assaies, either, to conquer his spiritual
affliction with worldly comforts, carnal counsel, choice contentments, etc.
Or else to allay the present storm of his guilty rage with some counterfeit
calm; or at best, to still the cry of his conscience, with putting forth his
hand to some outward works of Christianity, and some kind of conversion;
which may yet well enough consist with the secret enjoyment of his bosome-sin:
Or by some other such indirect course, and unsound cure. But now the Other,
whom the Lord does purpose to prepare for himself by this first work, and to
call effectually; does entertain at the same time by the help of God, a
strong, invincible resolution, not only never more to return unto foolishnes,
whatsoever comes of him; never upon any terms to fall back again into his
former For, peccare, and de Dei creatoris clementia praesumere, pelago
iustitiae eius exponi est. Gregor. in 1. Reg. c. 3. Nec putent satis sibi esse,
ut sua peccata displiceant, nisi etiam vigilantissima deinceps intention
vitentur: nec in eis vitandis vires suas existiment sufficere, nisi divinitus
adiuventur. August. Expos. Epist. ad Romans inchoat.
sinful pleasures, which have now fastened so many fiery Scorpions stings in
his conscience; but also, never to admit of any cure, recovery and comfort to
his afflicted soul, but only by Jesus Christ; never to have the bleeding
wounds of his bruised spirit bathed, bound up and healed, but in that
Fountain, opened to the house of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem,
for sin and for uncleanness: Nay rather then he will do the one or the
other, he will abide upon the Rack of his spiritual torture unto his ending
hour. Whereupon he directly addresseth and applies himself to the only
means, appointed and sanctified by God, for working a sure, kindly and lasting
cure in such a case, I mean, the Ministry of the Word. And, if he may have
his will* he would hit upon the most skillful, experienced, searching, and
sound-dealing Man, amongst all Gods faithful Messengers.

2. And so in a second place, without all reservation, or any purpose ever to
return or divert; he comes unto the Ministers of God, in the same mind, and
with the same meaning, that Peter's hearers did, Act. 2.37. having his heart
pricked and rent in pieces with legal terror, as theirs were: Men and
brethren what shall we do? if there be any Instruction, direction, or duty,
which upon good ground out of Gods blessed Book, you can enjoyne; we will
willingly follow it, embrace it, and rather die then not do it. Prescribe any
course, whereby we may have the boiling rage of our guilty consciences some
what assuaged, and we will bless God, that ever we saw your faces: Nay, that
ever he made you the happy instruments, to fasten these keen arrows of truth
and terror, in our amazed and afflicted spirits. Alas! we see now, etc. See
before p. 135. etc. And now here the Ministers of God have a strong and
seasonable calling to set out in the height, the excellency, amiablenes, and
soule-saving sufficiency of Jesus Christ, blessed for ever: To amplify and
magnify to the life, the heavenly beauty, unvaluablenesse, and sweeetnesse of
his person, passion, promises. No sin of so deep a die, be it scarlet or
crimson, but his precious blood can raze it out. No heart so dark or heavy,
but one beam shining from his pleased face, can fill it as full of spiritual
glory and joy, as the Sun is of light, or the Sea of waters. No man so
miserable, but if he will go out of himself, and the Devils slavery quite,
and come-in, when he is dearly invited, he will advance him without money,
and without price, from depth of horror to height of happiness, etc.

3. By this time, being thus told and truly informed in the mystery and mercy
of the Gospel, the poor wounded and weary soul begins to be deeply and
dearly enamored of Jesus Christ. To advance him highest in his thoughts; as
the only jewel and joy of his heart; without which he has been heretofore, a
dead man, and shall here after be a damned miscreant; to prefer and prize
him far above the pleasures, riches and glory of the whole earth; to set his
eye and longing so upon him, as to hold himself lost for ever without his
love; Nay, in the case he now stands, he is most willing for a sound and
saving cure, to pass through a piece of hell, if need were, to such a heavenly
physician; in whose blessed person alone, as he hea^es, all the riches of
mercy, goodness, compassion, and comfort is to be found; and in whom are hid
and heaped up the fulness of grace, and treasures of all perfection So that
now the current of his best affections, and all the powers of his humbled soul
are wholly bent and directed toward him, as the Sun-flower toward the Sun; the
iron to the lodestone; and the lodestone to the Pole Star. To whom the nearer
he draws, the more heartily it grieves him; that ever he pierced so sweet and
dear a Savior, with such a former impure loathsome life, and so many
abominable, and now most abhorred provocations.

4. Upon this discovery, survay and admiration of this pearl of great price,
this rich treasure, the now truly broken, and contrite heart, does cast about
by all means, how to compass it. O! what would he now give, for the sweet
fruition and ravishing possession of it? Hearts-blood, life, Nunc incipio
discipulus esse, cum nihil expetam visibilium, ut Iesum Christum assequar.
Ignes, cruz, ferarum concursus, sectiones, lanionae, ossium discerptiones,

lying in Hell for a season, were nothing in this case: The imperial crowns
and command of ten thousand worlds, were they all extant, would be in his
conceit, but as dust in the Balance, laid in the scale against Jesus Christ,
etc. But these things are not required at his hands. At last he happily hitt's
upon that, which God would have him: he even resolves to sell all that he has:
to part with all sin, tho it should be as dear, and as much doted upon, as
that compared to a right eye or right hand: be it that, which has kept him
longest in hell, most wasted the conscience, and stuck closest to his bosom; I
mean his Captain corruption, Master-lust, or Minion-delight; he will spare
none, he will quite out of Sodom, he will not leave so much as an hoof
behind. For he well now remembers, what he has often heard heretofore, tho
then he took no heed; That the Lord Jesus, and any When a man comes to this
pass, with indignation to be willing to part with his sins; to have no more
to do with the^, (as he must that will have part in Christ: he cannot have
Christ, and keep any one of his sins) that party shall have the Pearl.
Master Rogers of Dedham, Doctrine of Faith, cap. 2. page 173.

And surely well worthy is he to loose his part in Christ, and all his
benefits, that prefers any lust before him, and the favor of God; these set
too base a price on Christ, ever to have any part in him. Ibid cap. 8. page,

5. Fifthly, To the party thus legally afflicted, evangelically affected and
fitted savingly, now do all the promises of life in Gods blessed Book, offer
themselves, as so many Rocks of eternity in faithfulness and truth, for his
wearied soul, tossed with tempest, and full sorely bruised with storms of
terror, sweetly to rest upon, with everlasting safety: God the Father, his
bowels of tenderest compassion and bounty already stirring within him, runs,
that I may so say, as the Father in the Gospel, to fall upon it is neck, and
to kiss it with the kisses of his sweetest mercy: Jesus Christ opens himself,
as it were, upon the Cross, to receive it graciously into his bleeding wounds;
all which, he beholding with a spiritually illightned eye, admiring and
adoring, can not choose but subscribe and seal unto them, that they are true;
and so by the help of the Holy Ghost, casts himself with all the spiritual
strength he can, at least with infinite longings, most thirsty desires, and
resolution never to part, into his blessed bosom; saying secretly to himself;
Come life, come death, come Heaven, come Hell, come what come can, here will I
stick for ever. And if ever I perish, they shall pluck me out of the hands,
and rent me from between the arms of this mighty, glorious, and dearest
Redeemer of mine.

6. And having now taken Christ, as a Savior, to free him from the miseries of
sin, Qui peccata sua ex animo agnoscit, deque commissis vere dolet, is
medicum salutis non solum admittet, sed omnium cupidissime expeter: a pristinae
vilae delictis and a quibuscunque alys non modo abstinebit; sed summo studio
quasvis illorum occasiones etiam vitabit, imo abborrebit vehementer: and ut
antea turpitudini vi^^, ita iam puritati, innocentiae, and verae pictati
singulari diligentia invigilabit. Musc. in cap. 3. Matthew.
he is willing also to take him as a Lord, Husband, and King; to serve, love
and obey him. For every one that is truly Christ's, does as well thirst
heartily, and syncerely endeavor after mortification, conquest over
corruptions, sanctification, purity, new-obedience, ability to do, or suffer
any thing for Christ; as for pardon of sin and salvation from hell. And
therefore he willingly takes upon him his yoke; which tho so called, yet is
Omnia ergo illa, quae commemoravit aspera and gravia, frequentius and
abundantius sustinebat (Panlus scilicet); sed profecto aderat ei Spiritus
Sanctus, qui in exterioris hominis corruptione, interiorem renovaret de die in

happiness; and has in it a true, though not complete felicity, yielding
such abundance of joy to the conscience, as does easily countervaile all

of such as walk in this blessed way, do commonly lay hold upon them at such
time, as they sit down to take their case, and make them wi^h themselves at
their journeys end, in the presence of their Lord, whom they faithfully serve.
In whose presence is the fullness of joy, and at whole right hand are pleasures

where spoken against, as it was in Paul's time. Act. 28.22. yet in truth and
upon trial is most precious, profitable, and pleasant. See Prove. 3. Happy is
the man that finds wisdom; to wit, in the word, to walk in the ways of
God. -- She is more precious then rubies: and all the things thou can
desire, are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand;
and in her left hand, Flagellanda igitur hominum perversitas, qui non tantum

riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
are peace. He now for the short remainder of his abode in this vale of tears,
vows and gives up the flower and prime of all his abilities, loves, joys,
endeavors, performances in any kind, to the highest Majesty; and consecrates
all the powers and possibilities of body and soul, to do him the best and
utmost service he can any ways devise, unto his dying day. And still grieves
and walks more humbly, because he can do no better. For then he casts his
eyes upon God the Fathers free love, and Christ's dear passion; he thinks with
himself, and so he well may, that if he were able to do him, as much
service, as all the Saints do, both in this and the Church above, with
addition of all Angelical obedience; it were all infinitely less then
nothing, toward the discharge of his debt, and incomprehensible, everlasting
obligation.

Professors of the truth and power of religion; and that, as the most excellent
of the earth; the only true Noble Worthies of the World: worthy for ever, the
flower, fervency, and dearness of his most melting affections and intimate
love. And he labors also might and maine, to ingratiate himself into their
blessed communion, by all engagements and obligations of a comfortable,
fruitful, and constant fellowship in the Gospel. By an humble mutual
intercourse and communication of holy conference, heavenly counsel, spiritual
encouragements, consideration one of another, confirmation in grace, and in
assurance of meeting in heaven, etc. resolved to live and die with these
neglected happy Ones, in all fair and faithful correspondence, sweetest
offices of Christianity, and constant cleaving to the Lord Jesus, and his
glorious cause: Nay, assured to reign with them hereafter everlastingly in
fulness and height of all glory, joy, and bliss. For if once this divine
flame of brotherly love be kindled by the Holy Ghost in the hearts of true
hearted Christians, one toward another, it has this property and privilege
above all other loves, that it is never after put out or quenched; but burns
in their breasts with much affectionate fervor, with mutual warmth of dearest
sweetenes here upon earth; and shall blaze eternaly with Seraphicall heat in
the highest heavens hereafter. In the mean time, he makes conscience of
sympathizing, both with their felicities and miseries. His heart is enlarged
with lightsomenesse, or eclipsed with grief; as he hears of the prosperity
or oppression of Gods people. I the rather here mention this mark of the true
convert, because it is so much required; nay infinitely exacted at our hands,
in these heavy times of the Church. And therefore may be to every one of us an
evident Touchstone, to try whether our profession be vital or formal. If
those terrors, which I have heretofore many times threatened out of Gods Book
against all those pitiless and hard-hearted Caniballs, which take not the
present troubles of the Church to heart, upon purpose to break in pieces those
flinty Rocks, which dwell in some men's breasts, and to drive us all to
compassionatenesse, prayer, days of humiliation and parting from our evil
ways; I say, if they have been thought by any, to have been pressed too
precisely and peremptorily, hear, what I have since seen in Si doles proillo
(patiente scilicet tribulationem) in corpore Ecclesiae constitutus es, si non
doles praecisus es. Hom. 15. cx 30. and sort iam ideo non doles quia precisus

Austin; and what a peremptory censure he does pass upon those, who want a
fellow-feeling in such a case: If thou have this fellow-feeling, thou art of
that blessed body and brotherhood; if not, thou art not. And here, can I hardly
hold, but were it incident, I should desire to cry out with a voice lifted up
like a trumpet, against all those profane Esaus, swinish Gadarens, senseless
Earth-wormes; who all this while, that so many noble limbs of that great
blessed body of the Reformed Churches have lain in tears and blood, Hear how
grievously they complain of us beyond the Seaes:

Non tam dolenda, qua^ sauguineis lachrymis deploranda venit aperta illa
obduratio animorum, ac perfidia tam multorum fucalorum Christianorum, ac Iudae
sociorum, interipsos Evangelicos; quos quidem malailla, quamvis ipsis proxima,
and verticibus little impendentia nondum infestarunt. Eorum namque perpauci
(pro^ dol^r!) sunt, qui contritione Iosephi, ac^ratrum suorum exitio, serio
afficiantur: quin imo maximus est eorum numerus, qui brutorum pecoruminstar,

indulgent, non secus ac si cum morte foedus pepigissent, at que cum orco sibi
optime prospexissent. Histor. Jesuit Prae fat. The words sound to this sense:
It is a matter to be lamented, nay, to be deplored even with bloody tears,
To see so many false-hearted Protestants, and Iudas-like in these fearful and
forlome times, when the same horrible confusions hang over their heads, ready
to seize upon them, one of these years; like so many besotted Beasts, to ply
their filthy pleasures, profits, preferments, and their own particulars in one
kind or other, secure and careless; suffering the dear servants of Jesus
Christ, and their own Brethren, to sink, or swim in blood, and tears,
without any fellow-feeling at all, commiseration or succor!


did never take to heart to any purpose, or trouble themselves at all with
their grievous troubles; but have sottishly and securely lain at ease in Zion,
liable to that horrible curse denounced against Meroz: Curse ye Meroz (said
the Angel of the Lord), curse ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof: because
they came not to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Judge. 5.23. They have
not helped the people of God, so much as with any hearty fellow-feeling,
wrestling with God in prayer, set days to seek the return of Gods face and
favor, etc. Men they are of the World, which have their portion in this life:
who feel nothing but worldly losses, know nothing but earthly sorrows,
relish nothing but things of sense. If they be stung with a dear year, rot
of cattle, loss by surety-ship, shipwreck, robbery, fire, etc. they houle,
and take-on immoderately. But let Joseph be afflicted, Gods people in
disgrace, the Ministry hazarded, Christ spouse sit in the dust, the Daughter of
Zion weep bitterly, and have none to comfort her, etc. And these merciless
me^ are no whit moved; They have not a tear, a groan, or sigh to spend in
such a ruful case. Whereby they infallibly remonstrate unto their own
consciences, that they are no living members of Christ's mystical body; have no
part in the holy fellowship of the Saints, no spark of spiritual life, no
acquaintance at all with the ways of God: but continue cursedly careless,
what becomes of the Gospel, or Gods children; so that they may rise, grow
rich, and sleep in a whole skin.

8. By this time now, is he become the Vbi Deum in veritate coeperis quavere,

sic ab illis colitur Christus, quomodo eis quotidie praedicatur. Quoniam and

way, that mereantur here makes nothing for Popish Merit, but only intimates as
much, as possint, or valiant. See Pareus his excellent Castigation of

same purpose, In Psalm. 70. Conc. 2. And Sermon. 15. De verb. Apost. Which Places

exemption? Especially, since all the contumelies, and contemptes, all those
nicknames of Puritan, Precisian, Hypocrite, Humorist, Factionist, etc. with
which lewd tongues, are wont to load the Saints of God; are so many honorable
badges of their worthy deportment in the holy path, and resolute standing on
the Lords side. Some noble Romans having done some singular service to the
state; and after, troubled and handled violently in some private Cases, were
wont to bare their bodies, and to show in open court the scars and impressions
of those wounds, which they had received in their Countries cause; as
characters of special honor, and strongest motives to commiseration. So many
lying imputations, unworthy usages, and persecutions in any kind, for
profession of godliness, which the faithful Christian shall bring to the
Judgment seat of Christ; so many glorious and royal representations of
excellency of spirit and height of courage in Christian causes, shall they be
accounted in the sight and censure of almighty God, and the blessed Angels; and
make him more amiable and admirable in the face of heaven and earth.

Thus much of the Theorie, as it were, I come now to the Practicke part. To a
particular application of some special sovereign Antidotes; to the most
grievous ordinary maladies, incident to the souls of the Saints.

But first give me leave to premise some general well-heads, out of which do
spring abundance of comfort, and overflowing rivers of refreshing for all
intents, and effects in point of temptation and trouble of mind.

1. And first take a fruitful cluster, and heavenly heap of them together;
those twelve heads of extraordinary, immeasurable, comfortable matter for
spiritual medicines; which I have heretofore erected, as so many invincible
bulwarks against all assaults of despair, oppositions of Satan, exceptions of
distrust.

1. The infiniteness of Gods mercy sweetly intimated, Isa. 55.6.7.8. The
mercy of God is like Misericordia in Deo nihil aliud reipsa est, quam ipsius
essentia, quae una est, and qua una sapiens, iustus, misericors est. Zanch. de
natura Dei, lib. 4. cap. 4. ^. 2. Deus est misericors sua aeterna et simplici
essentia, non autem qualitate aliqua, non affectu, non passione. Polan. Syntag.
Theol. lib. 2. cap. 23.

between finite and infinite there is no proportion, and so no possibility of
resistance. And therefore be thy sins never so Oppose against the greatness
of thy sins, (...) Dei, and against the multitude of them (...) Dei. As Basil
speaks.
notorious, and numberless, yet in a truly broken heart, thirsting for, and
throwing it self upon Christ, unfainedly resolving upon new-obedience, and his
glorious service for the time to come, can no more withstand, or stand before
Gods mercies, then a little Cogita scintillam si in mare ^eciderit, non poterit
stare, aut apparere. Quantum scintilla ad mare se habet, tantu^ hominis malitia

Nam and pelagus, tamet si magnum sit, mensuram recipit; Dei vero clementia and
pietas mensuram non habet. Haec dicam: non quo nos desidiores, sed promptiores
reddam. Chrysostom. tom. 5. poenit. Hom. 3. colum. 846.
spark the boundless and mighty Ocean, thrown into the midst of it, nay
infinitely less. If Divina misericordia tanta est, ut si quis universa peccata
totius mundi commisisset, and doleret, quod tam bonum dominum tam superbe
offendisset, firmiterque proponeret amplius abstinere, Deus talem nunquam
damnaret, de Quinque partita conse. lib. 3. c. 44. Dei misericordia ma^or
omnium peccatorum miseria. August. citante Laurentio, adversus desperate. page
102.
all the sins, that all the Sons and daughters of Adam have committed,
since the Creation to this time, were all upon one soul; yet so affected, as I
have said, and put into such a new penitent, gracious temper, it should be most
certainly upon good ground, and everlastingly safe. I speak not thus to make
any secure; for any one sin Quamvis sentiamus in nobis peccatum latitans, and
Spiritui repugnans, tamen si non sit placens and reg nan^, non excludit
spiritualem hanc vivificationem. Remissio enim peccatorum universali^ tollit
reatum universorum peccatorum nostrorum, infusio eti am gratiae bui^ co^iuncta,
tollit dominium universorum. Davenant in expos. epist ad Colos. c. 2. verse. 13.
pleasing and reigning will ruin a soul for ever: But to assure of mercy
enough, how great or many so ever the sins have been; if the heart be now
truly humbled for them all, and wholly turned heavenward.

2. The unvaluablenesse of Christ's meritorious blood. Which is called the blood
of God; and therefore of inestimable price. Understand me aright: It was the
blood of God, not of the Godhead; but of him who was both God and man. For the
manhood of Christ was received into the union of the second person. And so it
may be called the blood of God, for so speaks S. Paul Act. 20.28. God
purchased his Church with his own blood; that is Christ, God incarnate. Our
Devines express it thus: It was the Son of God, and Lord of life, that died
for us upon the Cross, but it was the nature of man, not of God, wherein he
died; and it was the nature of God, and infinite excellency of the same, whence
the price, value and worth of his passion grew. This blessed blood then is of
infinite Infinit^ dupliciter dicitur, per aliud, vel per se; per aliud dicitur
humanitatis Christi meritum and satisfactio and (...) pro nobis persolutum esse
infinitae virtulis, qua virtute infinita factum etiam est, vt expiata sint
peccata mundi. Quomodo vero infinitae est virtutis? Non per and propter
humanitatem, sed per and propter infinitam Deitatem, cui humanitas Christi est
hypostatice unita. Polan. Synt. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 10. Obtulit Christus, ut
Pontifex; carnem quidem and sanguinem suum qua homo: sed victimae suae immensam
efficaciam asspirat per spiritum aeternum, qua Deus est. Par. in Epist. ad
Hebr. cap. 9. verse. 14.
efficacy, and therefore if thou be now turning to the Lord, assure thy self;
whatsoever thy sins have been, they have not out-gone the price, that has
been paid for them. This blood upon repentance did take off the transcendent
scarlet guilt from the souls, even of those that shed it. Act. 2. etc.

3. The riches of the Word in affording precedents of the Saints, and of the
Son of God himself; who have surpassed thee; and that, perhaps, very far
in any kind of misery thou can name.

Thou art perhaps consulting with the Prodigal to come-in, but there comes
terribly into thy mind the extraordinary heinousness of thy former sins;
and that hinders. 2. Kings 21.16.
Cast thine eye then upon Manasses, a man of prodigious impiety and matchless
villainy: 2. Chron. ^3.2. etc.
He shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end
to another. He did that, which was evil in the sight of the Lord, like unto
the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the children
of Israel. He caused his children to pass through the fir^^, in the valley of
the son of Hinnom: also He observed times, and used enchantments, and used
witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizzards. He wrought
much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger, etc. And yet this
great sinner humbling himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, Verse.
12.13.
was received to mercy.

Suppose, which yet were a horrible thing, that after conversion, by
extraordinary violence of temptation, strong in-snarement of some sudden
sensual offer and opportunity, treacherous insinuation of thy own false
heart, and furious re-assault of thy former bosome-sin, Thou should be
overtaken grossly with some grievous sin and scandalous fall; and then upon
illumination, remorse, and meditation of return, reason thus within thy self;
Alas! what shall I do now? I have undone all: I have woefully again defiled my
soul, so fairly washed in my Saviors blood, with that dis-avowed sin of my
unregenerate time; I have shamed my profession, disgraced religion for ever; I
have broke my vows, lost my peace, and my woonted blessed communion with my
God, etc. And therefore, what hope can I have, of any acceptance again at the
Throne of grace? I say in this case, to keep thee from sinking, cast thine eye
upon Aaron author horrendae Idololatriae non ahijcitur, nec absorbetur ab ^r a
divina. Moller. in Psalm. 77.
Aaron, David, Peter: who returning with sound and hearty repentance, were
mercifully entertained into as great favor, as they were before. But God
forbid, that any professor of religion should ever fall so fowly, especially
in this glorious midday of Evangelicall light!

Art thou langvishing under the heavy desolations* of a spiritual desertion,
and deprived of thy former comfortable feelings of Gods favorable countenance?
Look upon David Psalm. 77. I remembered God, and was troubled. I complained, and
my spirit was overwhelmed. I am so troubled, that I can not speak. My soul
refused to be comforted. Nay, upon Jesus Christ himself, Mat. 27.46. crying,
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?

Art thou haunted with some of Satan's most hateful and horrible injections,
grissely to the eye even of corrupted nature, Thoughts framed by himself
immediately, and put into thee; perhaps tending to Atheism, or to the
dishonor of God in the highest degree, or of his blessed word; to
self-destruction, or the like? Thoughts, which thou can not remember without
horror, and dare not reveal, or name for their strange and prodigious
monstrousness. If it be thus with thee: consider how this malicious Feind
dealt with the Son of God himself. He offered to his most holy, and
unspotted imagination, these propositions: First, Murder and make away thy
self, Matthew. 4.6. Secondly, Fall down and worship the Devil: Verse. 9. Then
which a fouler thought, I think, was never injected: that Jesus Christ blessed
for ever, in whom the God head dwelt bodily, should fall down and worship the
Devil, the vilest of Creatures. And yet this was suggested to our blessed
Savior. To which his purest heart infinitely uncapeable of sin, was as a
brass wall to an arrow, beating it back presently with infinite contempt. And
himself did utterly conquer and confound the tempter; and that for thee, and
thy sake too. And therefore All temptations are not sins in the tempted: for
then Christ should have sinned. This may comfort those, that being vexed with
fearful suggestions of Satan, as to think amiss of God himself, etc. do
thereby think amiss of themselves, as if they were therefore most vile
wretches. But they must remember, that this is no more their sin, if they
presently boat it back, then if a man like themselves, should wish them to
the like. Satan must answer for this himself. Dike of Christ's temptations,
page 219.
if thy humbled soul do abominate and abandon them from the heart-roote to
the pit of Hell, they shall never be laid to thy charge, but set on Satan's
score. Extremely then do those wrong themselves, and gratify the Devil to
the height; who suffer such injections, which they heartily hate, and stand
against, with all their strength, to hold their hearts still upon the rack of
extraordinary astonishment and distraction; whereby they are unnecessarily
discouraged and disabled for a cheerful discharge of both their callings.
Which is the thing Satan specially aims at, in vexing so many of Gods dearest
servants with this fieri'st dart.

It may be, that many years after thy new birth, when thou think the worst
is past, thou may be revisited and afflicted afresh with (perhaps) sorer
spiritual pangs, and more horror, then at the first. And what then? Hear how
David, a man after Gods own heart, cries out: Psalm. 32.
My bones waxed old; through my roaring all the day long; For day and night thy
hand was heavy upon me; My moisture is turned into the drought of summer.
Selah. And Job., a God-fearing man, and most upright: Job 13.24.25.26.
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and hold me for thine enemy? Will thou
break a leaf driven to and fro? And will thou pursue the dry stubble? For
thou writest bitter things against me, and make me to possess the
iniquities of my youth. Cap. 6.4.
The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison thereof drinks up my
spirit: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. Isai
38.13.14.
Hezekiah, that walked before God in truth, and with a perfect heart: I
reckoned till morning, that as a Oportet flagellis Domini efficaciam inesse,
qua humiliemur, atque deijctamurusque adipfo^ inferos, and consolatione
propemodum destituti omnia horroris plena concipiamus: que madmodum etiam
horrores iftos descriptos a Davide cernimus, dumossa sua dinumerata, lectum
sucum lachrymis made factum, animam suam turbatam, inferos aper^os esse dicit.
Sic enim pios in^erdum i^dicio Dei terreri ne^^sse est, ut bonitatis eius
desiderio magis afficiamur. Calv. in loc.
Lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night will thou make an
end of me. Like a Crane or a Swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
Dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for
me.

Do thou day after day pour out thy soul in prayer, before The Throne of
Grace, with all the earnestness, and instancy thy poor, dead heart (as thou
call it) can possibly; and do thou still rise up dull, heavy-hearted and
uncomfortable; without any sensible answer from God, or comfortable sense of
his favor and love shed into thy heart? Be it so; yet for all this, pray still
in obedience unto thy God, against all discouragements and oppositions
whatsoever. Press hard unto still, and ply Gods Mercy-Seate, if it be but with
sighs and groanings. Assuredly, at length, and in the fittest time, thou shall
be gloriously refreshed, and registered in the remembrance of God, for a
Christian of excellent Faith. See a pattern of rare and extraordinary patience
this way, Mat. 15.23. There, that Woman of Canaan having received many grievous
repulses, and cuting discouragements: the Solicited was silent; the Disciples
grumble; she was not of the Fold; she was a Dog; yet for all this, by her
constancy in crying after Christ, her petition at last was not only granted,
but her self also crowned with a singular, and admirable Eulogie, from the
Lords own mouth: O Woman! great is thy Faith: be it unto thee, even as thou will, What an honor and comfort was this, to be thus commended by Jesus
Christ? and that with an admiration, O Woman!

Has thy Faith lost it is feeling? Do thou for the present feel nothing,
but anger, wrath, and great indignation? Is Gods face and favor, wherein is
life, turned away from thee, and quite hid from thy sight? Nay, has he broken
thee a^under, taken thee by the neck, and shaken thee to pieces, and set thee
up for his mark? Yet for all this, let thy truly humbled soul be so far
from loosing, or leaving it is hold-fast, and sure repose upon the Person,
Passion, and Promises of Jesus Christ; that in such a Case, it cleave and cling
faster to that blessed Rock, and far more immoveablely. For therein
specially is the strength and glory of Faith improved, and made illustrious. It
is one of the most noble and heroical acts of Faith, to believe without
feeling. He, who believes most, and feels least, is he, who glorifieth God
most. It is nothing to swim in a warm Bath; but to endure the surges, and
tumbling billows of the Sea, that is the man. To believe, when God does fairly
and sensibly shine upon the soul, with the love and light of his countenance,
is no great matter: But to rest invincibly upon his mercy through Christ; when
he grinds thee to powder, that is the Faith. Thou have before thee for this
purpose a matchless precedent. Thus cries holy Job, vexed not only with an
unparalleld variety and extremity of outward afflictions, but also with the
venom of the Almighties arrows, drinking up his spirit. The he slay me, yet
will I trust in him: Cap. 13.15. So Abraham: Romans 4.18.

Have thou given thy name stoutely to Religion, and do thou stand on Gods
side with resolution? And art thou therefore villanously traduced with
slanderous, odious, nicknames of Puritan, Precisian, Hypocrite, Humorist,
Dissembler etc? Consider then for thy comfort, that graceless wretches, when
he was upon the earth, called thy blessed Lord and Savior, Devil; See Matthew.
10.25. Ioh. 7.20. which passes all, I am persuaded, that any drunken Belial
ever yet fastened upon thee. Contemn thou therefore for ever, and trample upon
with an humble and triumphant patience, all their contumelies and contempts.
Passe-by nobly without touch or trouble, without wound or passion, the utmost
malice of the most scurrill tongue; the basest gibe of the impurest Drunkard.

Does the World, carnal men, thine own friends, ormall Teachers suppose, and
censure thee to be a dissembler in thy Profession* and will needs concurrently
and confidently, yet falsely, fasten upon thee the imputation of hypocrisy? An
heavy charge! Yet for all this, Let thy truly-humble heart, conscious to it
self of it is own syncerity in holy services, like a strong pillar of brass,
beat back all their impoysoned arrows of malice and mistake this way,
without any dejection, or discouragement; Only take occasion hereby to search
more thoroughly, and walk more warily. Job may be a right noble pattern to
thee in this point also. He had against him, not only the Devil his enemy,
pushing at him with his poisoned weapons; but even his own friends scourging
him with their tongues; His own wife a thorn pricking him in the eye, yea,
his own God, running upon him like a Gya^^, and his terrors setting
themselves in array against him^ Powerful motives, to make him suspect himself
of former halting, and hollow-heartednesse in the ways of God: yet
notwithstanding, his good and honest heart, having been long before acquainted
with, and knit unto his God ^^ truth, makes him break out boldly, and
resolutely protest: Till I die, I will not remove my integrity from me. My
righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: Chap. 27.5.6. Behold, my
Witness is in Heaven, and my record is on high. Cap. 16.19.

Art thou a loving and tenderhearted mother unto thy children, and have thou
lost the dearest? The greatest outward cross, I confess, that ever the sons
and daughters of Adam tasted, and goes nearest to the heart: Yet thy sorrow is
not singular, but out-gone in this also. For the blessed Mother of Christ stood
by, and saw her own, only, dear, innocent son, the Lord of life, most
cruelly and villanously murdered upon the Cross before her eyes, Ioh. 19.25.

Have thou lost thy goods or children? Does thy wife that lies in thy bosom,
set her self against thee? Do thy nearest friends charge thee falsely? Art
thou pained extremely from top to toe? Do the Arrows of the Almighty stick
fast in thy soul? Thy affliction is grievous enough, if thou taste any of
these severally. But do they all in greatest extremity concur upon thee at
once? Have thou lost all thy children, and all thy goods? Does thy wife afflict
thy afflictions? etc. If this be not thy Case, and rufull condition, thou
come yet short of Job, a most just man, and one of Gods dearest Jewels.

4. The exceeding greatness and pretiousnesse of the promises. (...). 2. Pet.
1.4.
In every one of which, it is incredible to consider, what abundant matter of
unspeake-able and glorious joy lies w^rp^ up! Oh, how sweet are they to a
thirsty soul, in the ^^me of angvish and trouble! They are like a cloud of
rain, that comes in the time of a drought. They are very glimpses of Heaven,
shed into a heart, many times as dark as hell. They are even rocks of
eternity, upon which every bruised reed may sweetly repose, with impregnable
safety. A truly humbled spirit, relishing spiritual things, would not exchange
any one of them, for all the riches and sweetness of both the Indies. Tell me,
dear heart, thou that in thy unregenerate time, though now happily changed,
lay soaking in sins of cruelty and blood; whether that merciful promise,
Isai. 1.18. Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord: Though your
sins be as sk^rlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
like crimson, they shall be as wool; be not far dearer unto thee, then
thousands of gold and silver? Or thou, who formerly pollutedst thy self
villanously with such secret execrable lusts, which now thou can not remember
without horror, tell me, if it were utterable by the Tongue of man, with what
dearest sweetness and blessed peace, thy broken heart was bound up and
revived; when thou cast thine eye considerately and beleevingly upon that
precious place, Ezech. 36.25. I will sprinkle water upon you, and you shall be
clean: and from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse
you, etc.

There was beyond the Seas, as my Author reports, No^i ego admodum pu^^ mal^

adversus desperationem. Authore M* Nicolao Laurentio. page 63. and seq.
Christian Matrone of excellent parts and piety; who langvishing long under the
horrible pressure of most furious and fiery temptations, woefully at length
yielded to despair, and attempted the destruction of her self. After often
and curious seeking occasion for that bloody fact, at last having first put off
her apparel, threw her self headlong from an high Promontory into the Sea.
But having received no hurt by her fall; she was there, by a Miracle, and
extraordinary mercy, strangely preserved, for the space of two hours at the
least; though all the while she labored industriously to destroy her self.
Afterward drawn out with much ado, and recovered, she yet still did conflict
with that extremest, desperate horror almost a whole year. But by Gods good
providence, which sweetly and wisely orders all things, listening on a time,
though very unwillingly at first, to her husband reading amongst other places,
that, Isa. 57.15. Thus says the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
whose name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is
of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever, neither
will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the
souls which I have made: I say, listening to these words, the Holy Ghost
drawing her heart* she begun to reason thus within her self: God does here
promise to revive and comfort the heart of the contrite, and spirit of the
humble: and that he will not contend for ever, neither b^ always wroth:

But I have a very contrite heart, and a spirit humbled (...) to the dust* one
of the acknowledgement, and sense of my sins, and divine vengeance against
them:

Therefore peradventure, God will vouchsafe to revive and comfort my heart and
spirit; and not contend with (...) for ever, nor be wroth against me still,
etc.

Hereupon by little and little, there flowed by Gods blessing into her dark
and heavy heart, abundance of life, lightsomnesse, spiritual strength, and
assurance. In which she continued with constancy and comfort, many a year
after; crowned those happy days, and a blessed old age, with a glorious and
triumphant death, and went to Heaven in the year 1595. What heart now, but
Hers that felt it, can possibly conceive the depth of that extraordinary,
un-utterable refreshing; which sprung out of that promise, upon her forlorn
and fearful soul; or the excess of that love, which she bore ever after to
those blessed lines; to the mercy that made them, and to the blood that sealed
them?

An other terrified in conscience for sin, resolves to turn on Gods side;
but the cry of his good fellow companions, strength of corruption, and cunning
of Satan, carry him back to his former courses. A good number of years
after, he was so thoroughly wounded, that whatsoever came of him, he would
never return again unto folly. Then comes into his mind the first of the
Proverbes: whence he thus reasoned against himself: So many years ago God
called, and stretched out his hand in mercy, but I refused: and therefore now,
the I call upon him, he will not answer; though I seek him early, I shall not
find him. Whereupon was his heart filled with much grief, terror, and
slavish fear. But the Spirit of God leading him at length to that place, Luke
17.4. If thy brother trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven
times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shall forgive him;
He thence happily argued thus for himself: Must I a silly sinful man
forgive my brother, as often as he repents; and will not then the Father of
mercies, and the God of all comfort, entertain me, seeking again in truth,
his face and ^avour? God forbid. From* which he blessedly drew such a deal of
divine sweetness, and secret sense of Gods love; that his trembling heart at
first received some good satisfaction, and afterward was settled in a sure and
glorious peace.

An other godly man passing through his l^st sickness with such extraordinary
calm^nesse of conscience, and absolute freedom from temptation; that some of
his Christian friends observing, and admiring the singularity of his souls
quiet, at that time especially, questioned him above it: He answered; that he
had steadfastly fixed his heart upon that sweetest promise, Isa. 26.3. Thou will
keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusts
in thee: And his God had graciously made it fully good unto his soul.

And so must every Saint do, who would sound the sweetness of a promise to
the bottom; and make it the arm of God unto him for sound and thorow-comfort:
Even settle his heart fixedly upon it, and set his Faith on work, to brood
it, as it were, with it is spiritual heat, that quickenesse and life may
thence come into the soul indeed. For God is wont to make good his promises
unto his children, Tantum quisque habet, quantum credit, iuxta illud. Secundum
fidem tuam tibi fiat. Zanch. in 5. ad Ephesians. page 489.

Non enim (quod beneficiorum terrestrium mos est) in capescendo munere
coelesti, mensura ulla* vel modus est; Profluens largiter Spirit us nullis
finibus premitur, nec coercentibus claustris intra certa metarum spacia
refraenatur. Manat iugiter, exuperat afsluenter, nostrum tantum sitiat pectus,
and pateat. Quantum illuc fidei capacis afferimus; tantum gratiae inundantis
haurimus. Cyp. Epist. lib. 1. Epist. 2.


proportionably to their trust in them, and dependence upon his truth and
goodness for a seasonable performance of them.

Now all these promises in Gods blessed Book, (which adds infinitely to their
sweetness and certainty) are sealed with the blood of Jesus Christ:
Argumentu^per se est evidens. Doctrina insignis ad consolationem nostram. Si
enim promissiones Evangelij sunt Testamentum Christi: certe ultimam eius
voluntatem de nostra salute declarant, and immutabile^, quippe testatoris morte
obsignatam. Dubitare igitur de veritate promissionum and certitudine salutis
promissae nec possumus nec debemus. Par. in loc.
Heb. 9.16. and confirmed with the Oath of Almighty God, Heb. 6.17.18. -- God
willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise, the immutability of
his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: That by two immutable Per quas?
Videlicet quod dicit and promittit, deinde and iuramentum addit promissioni.
Quoniam enim apud homines hoc videtur certius esse, cui iuramentum interfuerit:
propterea etiam hoc addidit: vides quomodo dignitatem suam non attendit, sed ut
hominibus persvadeat, indignaque de se patitur dici? hoc est satisfacere
volens. Chrysostom. in loc. Inter homines ad (...) sufficit res una immutabilis,
jus-jurandum. Deus vero ad (...) adhib^^^ ^on unam sed duas res immutabiles:
non solum promissionem immutabilem, nec solum ius-iurandum inviolabile,
impossible siquidem Deum vel promittendo veliurando mentiri, sed utrumque
simul: in quo sane fuit (...) ingens. Par.
things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
consolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope set before us.
Oh what a mighty and precious invitation is this, to believe perfectly! The
special Aim of Gods oath, whereas his promise had been more then infinitely
sufficient, was to strengthen our consolation. And therefore every heart true
unto Christ, ought hence to hold fast, not a faint, wavering, inconstant; but a
strong, steadfast, and unconquerable comfort. Otherwise it sacrilegiously, as it
were, robs God of the glorious end, for which he swore.

5. The free love of God. Which, how rich and glorious, how bottomless and
boundless a treasure it is of all gracious sweetness, abundant comfort, and
endless bounty, appears in this, that Jesus Christ, blessed for ever, that
unvalew-able, incomparable Jewel, came out of it. For God so loved the World,
that he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believes in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life: Ioh. 3.16. And therefore every sincere
servant of Christ, when upon a serious and sad survay of his Christian ways,
finds himself to come so far short of that, which God requires, and himself
desires; That his prayers are very faint, his sorrow for sin very scant, his
love unto the brethren too cold, His spending the Sabbaths very unfruitful,
His spiritual growth, since he gave his name to Christ, very poor, His
profiting by the means he enjoyes, most unanswerable to the power and
excellency thereof, His New-obedience almost nothing, etc. (For so he is wont
to vilify himself). Whereupon he is much cast down; and out of this
apprehension of his manifold unworthiness, concludes against himself, that
he has little cause to be confident in the promises of life* or to presume
of any part and interest in Jesus Christ; and so begins to retire the trembling
hand of his already very-weake Faith, from any more laying-hold of comfort: I
say, in such a Case, being true-hearted, Ten^amus nos hoc nostra salutis
principium and fundamentum tutissimum, nimirum Dei dilectionem gratuitam: cuius
fiduci^ quinitantur, ^^ demum in omni tex^a^^one, salut is spem inconcussam,
and infallib^l^m retinere poterunt. Gualt. in loc.
he may safely, and upon sure ground, have recourse to this ever-springing
Fountain of immeasurable mercy; and raise up his drooping soul against all
contrary oppositions, with unspeake-able and glorious refreshing, from such
places as these: Hos. 14.4. I will love thee freely. Isai. 55. Ho, every one
that thirsts, come ye to the waters; and he that has no money: come y^e,
buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.
And Chap. 43.25. I, even I am he, that blotteth one thy transgressions for my
own sake; and will not remember thy sins. Revel. 21.6. I will give unto him
that is athirst, of the Fountain of the water of life freely, etc. God never
set the Promises on sale, or will ever sell his Son to any. He never said;
Just so much sorrow, so much sanctity, so much service, or no Christ: But He
ever gives Him freely. Every truly humbled heart, which will take him at the
hands of Gods free love, as an Husband to be saved by him, and to serve him in
truth, may have him for nothing. Yet I must add this: there was never any, who
received the Lord Jesus savingly, but he labored syncerely to sorrow as much
for sin, to be as holy, to do him as much service as he could possibly.
And when he reflected upon his best, he ever desired, it had been infinitely
better.

6. The sweet Name of the Lord. Which he proclaims, Exodus 34.6.7. wherein he
first expresses his essence in one word: The Lord, The Lord. Which doubled, is
effectual to stir up Moses attention. Secondly, three Attributes: first, His
power, in one word, Strong: Secondly, His justice, in two forms of speech: not
making the wicked innocent; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children, and upon childrens children, unto the third and fourth generation:
Thirdly, but his special goodness, and good affection toward repentant, and
believing sinners, in seven: 1 Merciful and 2 Gracious, 3 Long-suffering, and
abundant in 4 Goodness and 5 Truth, 6 Keeping mercy for thousands, 7 Forgiving
iniquity, transgression and sin. In which there are employed un-answerable
replies to all the scruples, doubts, exceptions, objections, which may arise in
a troubled soul.

1. Thou say perhaps, that thou art plunged into the depth of extremest
spiritual misery, both in respect of s^^fulnesse and cursednesse. The present
sense whereof is ready to sink thee into despair. Be it so: Then take my
counsel in this Case: Cast thine eye upon the first and fairest flower in this
heavenly-glorious Garland of divine goodness. And thou shall find a fame
greater depth of mercy; (...) misericors a (...) Quod redditur grace per (...)
in N.T. passim, quod significat misericor did co^moveri summa and vehementi
atque ex intimis visceribus profecta.
ready to swallow up thy depth of misery. The mercy of God and misery in this
kind, are relatives: No misery, no mercy; much misery, much mercy; transcendent
misery, transcendent mercy: the only difference is, the mercy of God is
infinite, thy misery finite. And therefore how much spiritual misery soever
thou bring in a broken heart to the Throne of grace, Gods bountiful hand
will weigh out to thee a proportionable measure of mercy; nay, a measure
without measure, super-abundant, running-over. For where misery in a truly
humbled soul abounds, there mercy does much more abound.

2. Or suppose, that at thy first turning unto God, tho truly humbled, yet thou
art tempted, not to take Christ; out of this cco^eit, because thou art but even
now come out of hell, and horrible courses, and as yet have no good thing in
thee at all: Or after some progress in Christianity, reflecting in time of
temptation upon thy whole carriage, since conversion; and finding it to have
been so fruitless, and full of failings: Thou concludest, thy self in thy
present feeling, to be extremely vile; of a very doubtful state for thy soul;
if not stark naught: That no Professor upon earth walks so unworthily; and if
Ministers knew thy heart, and weak performance of holy duties, they would not
be so forward to press comfort upon thee, etc. I say, in these two cases, and
the like, it is a great happiness and sweetest comfort, that the mighty Lord
of Heaven and Earth has proclaimed himself to be Gracious; (...) gratiosus,
a (...) benefic^^ gratuito confer: in gratiam recipere, excludit dignitatem,
aut meritu^. Pag^.
which imports thus much: to pour out abundance of extraordinary bounty, upon
a most undeserving party: To place dearest affection and desire of doing good
there, where there is no desert at all. As if a King to make his royal favors
more illustrious, should raise a worthless Wretch, a most contemptible Vassal,
to be his worthi^^^ Favorite, and highest in his love. And therefore bring
(...) to the Throne of Grace, but a true sense of thy misery a sincere thirst
for mercy, an humble acknowledgement of thine unworthiness; and God hereupon,
for his Christ's sake, will think thee worthy of the riches of his grace, the
righteousness of his Son; all the promises in his Book, all the comforts of
his Spirit, a Crown of immortality and bliss: For he is gracious; and an
universal glorious confluence of blessedness in all kinds, is promised to
poverty in spirit; and shall most certainly, to the utmost, be made good unto
it for ever.

3. But alas! I, says an other, have most wretchedly misspent the flower and
strength of mine age in vanity and pleasure; in lewdness and lust: The best of
my time has been woefully wasted in Satan's notorious service, and sensual
serving my self, etc. And therefore, tho I be now weary of my former ways,
and look back upon them with a trembling heart, and grieved spirit; yet I am
afraid, that God has given over looking after me; that His patience toward
me is expired, and my day of visitation out-stood; And that he will not
vouchsafe to cast his eye of compassion upon such a Blackamore, and Leopard, as
I am; so overgrowne with corruption, and grown old in sin; especially,
having so long neglected so great salvation, forsaken mine own mercy so long,
and so unthankefully despised the riches of his goodness and forbearance,
leading me to repentance. I confess, it is something rare, to see men gone-on
so long, and grown old in sin, to return, and give way to any saving work
of the Ministry; because too often in the mean time they so harden their
hearts, that they cannot repent; yet notwithstanding, be thou assured in the
Word of life and truth, if now at length thou be truly touched indeed, and will
comein, in earnest; the Father of mercies will receive thee freely to mercy,
and embrace thy bleeding soul in the arms of his everlasting love through
Christ. For it is a title of highest honor unto him, to be long-suffering. He
all this while waited, Isai. 30*18.
that he might be gracious unto thee; And now undoubtedly upon thy first
resolution to return in truth, he will meet thee with infinitely more
compassionate affectionatenesse, then the Father in the Gospel, Luke 15.
his Prodigal: who when he was a great way off, his Father saw him, and had
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck^, and kissed him, etc.

4. Yea, but says an other; Though I have been a Professor long, yet many
times my heart is full heavy, and more loath to believe, when I seriously and
sensibly call to mind, the heinousness of my unregenerate time; and see in my
self besides, since I was illightned, and should have behaved my self in
forwardness and fruitfullnesse for God, answerably to my former folly, and
furiousness in evil; so many defects and imperfections every day: and such
weak distracted discharging of commanded duties, both to God and man. Take
then counsel and comfort in this Case, by casting thine eye upon Gods
kindness: He is abundant in (...) Multae misericordiae, vel potius multus
benignitate, ut optime nostri verterunt. Zanch. Nunc igitur si estis porro
exercituri (...) benignitatem. Iun.

And now if ye will deal kindly, etc. In our last Translation, Genesis 24.49.
Ergo filios vero Barzillai Gilbaditae exerceto (...) Benignitatem: But show
kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Giliadite, 1. King 2.7.


kindness* which has these four precious properties: First, To be easily
entreated: Secondly, To be entreated for the greatest: Thirdly, to pass by
involuntary infirmities: Fourthly, to accept graciously weak services. Even ^
frail man, if of a more noble, generous, and kind disposition, will be easily
appeased for the unpurposed offenses, errors, and over-sights; and well
pleased with the good will, sincere endeavors, and utmost, especially, of
those who he knows to be true-hearted unto him; and desire heartily, if they
were able, to do all he desires, even to the height of exactness and
expectation. How much more then will our heavenly Father deal so with his
children, who is in himself essentially kind, and infinitely?

5. Yea, but say thou, many times when I reach (...) the hand of my faith, to
fetch some special promise into my soul for refreshing, and comfort; and
weighing them well, and comparing advisedly my own nothingnesse,
worthlesnesse, vileness, with the riches of mercy, grace and glory shining in
it; and marking the dis-proportion, I am overwhelmed with admiration and
astonishment; and to tell you true, say sometimes to my self: Is it possible,
that this should be so? That so glorious things should belong to such a wretch
and worm, as I am! But turning thine eye from a distrustful, and too much
dejected dwelling upon thine own desert, to what Christ has done for thee,
and to the Almightinesse and All-mercifullnesse of him that promises; consider
with all, that God is also abundant in truth. Every promise in his Book is as
sure as Himself, sealed with his Sons Blood, and confirmed with his own Oath.
He must sooner cease to be God, and deny himself; which is more, then
infinitely impossible, and prodigious blasphemy to imagine; then fail in the
least circumstance, or syllable of his immeasurable love, and promises of life,
to any one that heartily loves him, and is true of heart. And therefore when
thy thirsty soul makes toward the Well of life, by virtue of that promise;
Rev. 21.6. I will give to him that is athirst, of the fountain of the water of
life freely; And upon survey of the overflowing Rivers of pleasures and bliss,
which everlastingly spring thence, begins to retire from it, as too-good news
to be true; I say, then steel thy Faith, and comfort thy self gloriously, by
consideration of that abundant truth, with which he has crowned every word of
His, stronger then a Rock of brass, far surer then the Pillars of the Earth,
or Poles of Heaven; Nay, I speak an admirable thing, and of unutterable
consolation, which cannot be violated without Destruction of the Deity, most
blessed and glorious for evermore. And let this ever banish, and beat back all
scruples, doubts seares, which at any time offer themselves, and oppose thy
unspeakeable joy, and peace in believing.

6. Well, says an other, I easily acknowledge the incomprehensible goodness
in this Name of God; and hold them most blessed, who have their part and
portion therein. But for my part, I am afraid, I come too late. For I have
observed the course of the Ministry amongst us, and the dispensation of Gods
mercy in it. At first coming, our Town being full of Ignorance, profaneness,
and much superstitious follies, having never before enjoyed the Word with any
life or power; we all stood amazed a good whle, at the Majesty and Mystery of
this new heavenly Light. The first messages of the Ministry sounded in our
ears, as the voice of many waters, mighty, and great; but confused: not
working in us either joy or terror, but only an extraordinary wonder, and
secret acknowledgement of a strange force, and more then humane power. But
afterward, when our Watchman was better acquainted with our ways, and had
more fully discovered the state of our souls; the Word was unto us, as a voice
of a great thunder, more distinct and particular; breeding not only admiration,
but fear also; not filling our ears only with an uncouth sound, but our
hearts also with a terrible searching. For the Sermons of every Sabbath
came-home to our consciences, singling out our several reigning corruptions;
beating punctually upon our bosome-sinnes; manifesting clearly our spiritual
misery, and certain liablenesse to the extremest wrath of God, and endless
woe. Whereupon, we were all at our wits end what to do, grew weary of our
lives, wished with all our hearts, that such a Puritane-Preacher had never come
amongst us; told every man, almost we met, that we had a Fellow at our Town
would drive us all to despair, distraction, selfe-destruction, or some
mischief, or other. That we heard nothing from him but of damnation, and
hell, and such horrible things, etc. Now in this second work of the Word,
there was a good number, even some out of that cursed crew and knot of
Good-fellowship, wherein I have been ensnared so long, won unto Jesus Christ.
For being illightned, convinced and terrified in conscience for their former
sinful courses; the continued piercing of the Word, and work of the spirit of
bondage, keeping them upon the Rack, under the dreadful sense of divine
wrath, and their damnable state a good while: at last, they happily resolved
without any more delay, diversion, by-path, or plunging again into worldly
pleasures, to pass on directly, by the light and guidance of the Gospel, into
the holy path. And so undertook, and hitherto have holden out in Profession;
and a blessed conformity to the better side, But I, and the greater part a
great deal, more was the pity, hating heartily to be reformed; and abhorring
that precise way, so much spoken against every where; into which woe conceived,
such severe Ministerial counsel would have conducted us; I say, we wickedly
wrested out of our vexed consciences, those keen arrows of truth and terror,
with great indignation; we unhappily hardened our hearts and foreheads against
the power of the Word, which particularly pursued us every Sabbath: Nay, alas!
we persecuted the very means, which should sanctify us; and men, which would
have saved us. Here then is my Case and complaint; neglecting that blessed
season, when I was first terrified and troubled in mind; when the Angel from
Heaven, as it were, troubled the water; and when some, even of mine own
Companions in iniquity, were converted; I am afraid, I now come too late, that
the mercy of God to do me spiritual good, is already expired; and that the
Ministry, which I have so wretchedly opposed, is the very same to me, that it
was to the obstinate Jews, Isa. 6.9.10. Nay, but yet say not so; though it be
with thee as thou have said: For our gracious God keeps mercy for thousands.
Non dico tibi vsque septies, sed usque septuagies septies] Mat. 18.12. qua
phrasi numerus finitus pro infinito ponitur. Sic vocem mill modificant
Hebraei, Exodus 34.7. Servans misericordiam millibus] Beumler. Rhetor. lib. 1.
cap. 14.
Here you must know, that a finite number is put Synecdochecally for an
infinite, and an infinite indeed. And therefore if thou now be in earnest, and
willing to come-in, in truth; and those thine other brethren in Good
fellowship, and hundreds, thousands, millions more, or any whosoever to the
worlds end, God has mercy in store for you all; and being all weary of all
your sins, unfainedly thirsting for the Well of life; resolving for the time
to come, upon new courses, company, and conversation; you shall all be most
welcome to Jesus Christ. Even the last man upon earth, bringing a truly broken
heart to the Throne of grace, shall be crowned as richly, and with as large a
portion of Gods infinite mercy, and Christ's un-valew able merit, as Adam and
Eve, or whosoever laid first hold of that first promise: The seed of the woman
shall bruise the Serpents head.

7. Yea, but alas! I have been no ordinary sinner. My corruptions have carried
me beyond the villainies of the vilest you can name. Not only variety, but the
notoriousnesse also, and enormity of my wicked ways, have set an infamous
brand upon me, even in the sight of the world; beside those secret pollutions,
and sinful practices, which no eye, but that, which is ten thousand times
brighter then the Sun, ever beheld. Had I not been extremely outrageous,
stained with abominations of deepest die, and gone on thus with a high hand, I
might have had some hope; But now I know not what to say! Take notice then, to
the end that nothing at all may possibly hinder, or any way discourage any
poor soul, that syncerely seeks for mercy, and desires to turn truly on
Gods side, from assurance of gracious acceptance, and intertainement at his
Throne of Grace; That it is natural also to his Name, To forgive iniquity,
transgression and sin. That is, (...) pro tola corruptione naturae,

sins of all sorts, kinds and degrees whatsoever. There is none so hateful
and heinous; whether natural corruption, or ordinary outward transgression, or
highest presumption, but upon repentance, God is most able, ready, and willing
to remit it.

7. God the Fathers compassionate pangs of infinite affection and forwardness
to entertain into his arms of mercy, all true Penitents. As I live, says the
Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked
turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for
why will ye die, O house of Israel? Ezech. 33.11. Woe unto thee O Jerusalem,
will thou not be made clean? When shall it once be? Ier. 13.27. They say, if
a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall
he return to her again? Shall not that Land be greatly polluted? But thou
have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, says the
Lord: Ier. 3.1. Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
in my ways! I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted
themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever; He should
have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the
rock should I have satisfied thee: Psalm. 81. O that thou had hearkened to my
commandments, then had thy peace been as a River, and thy righteousness as
the waves of the Sea. Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of
thy howells like the gravel thereof: his name should not have been cut off,
nor destroyed from before me: Isa. 48.18.

8. His merciful almightinesse, in putting life and lightsomnesse into the
most dead and darkest heart. Seek him, says the Prophet, that makes the
seven Stars and Orion, and turns the sh^dow of death into the morning: Amos
5.8. Suppose thou s^ttest thy self to seek Gods face and favor: and art
presently set upon with this temptation: But alas! My soul is so black with
sin, and dark with sorrow, that it is to no purpose for me to proceed, etc.
But now in this case, consider, who He is that thou seek; it is He, that
made of nothing those beautiful, shining, glorious constellations, Orion and
the Pleiades (and nothing in the world is darker then nothing). He is He,
that turns the darkest midnight into the brightest morning, etc.

9. Christ's sweetest, dearest, most melting invitations of all truly troubled
souls for sin, unto the Well of life, and their own everlasting welfare.
Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest: Mat. 11.28. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee! How often would I have gathered thy
children together, even as a Hen gathers her Chickens under her wings, etc.
Mat. 23.37. And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it,
saying; Oh if thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
things which belong unto thy peace! Luke. 19.41.42. In the last day, the great
Day of the Feast, Jesus stood, and cried, saying; If any man thirst, let him
come to me, and drink.

10. Precedents in Gods Book of many heinous and horrible sinners received to
mercy upon their humiliation. As Eve, Magdalen, Paul, Zacheus, Sodomits. 1.
Cor. 6.9.11. Crucifiers of Christ. Acts. 2.

11. Experience perhaps of the Comforter, converted from a more wicked and
desperate course, then the Patient himself. And it does not a little refresh
the heart of him, who grievosly wounded in conscience, and thereupon sending
for a skillfull, and faithful Messenger of God; and, when he has opened his
Case fully unto him, to hear him say, when he has said all; My Case was far
worse then yours every way: Nay but besides those notorious sins, I have named
unto you, I have defiled my self with many secret execrable lusts. Be it so,
says the spiritual Physician; yet in the days of my vanity, I have been
guilty of more and more heinous crimes, then any, you have yet spoken of. Yea,
but even now, when I have most need of, should most prize, reverence, and lay
hold upon Gods blessed Word, Son and Promises; I am pestilently pestered with
many abhorred, villainous, and prodigious injections about them. Not a man
alive, replies the Man of God, has had his head troubled with more hideous
thoughts of such hellish nature, then I, etc.

12. That precious Parable, Luke 15. wherein all those Sicuti in adolescente
decoctore depinxit Lucas imaginem primum peccatoris luxu perditi, deinde
peccatoris resipiscentis: ita nunc in parente eius imaginem immensae clementiae
and misericordiae Dei exprimit. Brentius in loc.
loving passages of the Father unto his prodigal Son; to wit, His beholding
him, when he was yet a great way off; his compassion, running toward him,
falling upon his neck, kissing him, putting on him the best Robe, and the
Ring, killing the fatted Calfe, etc. do shadow that immeasurable,
incomprehensible love of God the Father to every one, that is willing to come
out of the Devils cursed service, into the good way. But come as far Non
comparatur Deus homini simpliciter: sed ut intelligamus centuplo maiorem esse
b^nitatem Dei erga nor, and misericordiam. Non igitur dubium est, simulatque
poenitentia tacti sumus, quin Deus in gratiam suam recipiat.

Non dubium est, quin sub hac imagine immensa Dei bonitas, and incomparabilis

nos deterreat. Calv.


short of expressing it to the life, as the infinite greatness of Almighty
God, surpasses the finite frailty of a weak man, and worm of the earth.

2. In a second place, Let us take a view of some of those most delicious, and
sweetest streams of dearest comfort, which spring abundantly out of that
fruitful Fountain of compassion and love, Psalm. 103.13. Like as a Father
pittieth his Children: so the Lord pittieth them that fear him. See also,
Deut^r. 8.5. Malac. 3.17.

Hence may we draw refreshing enough to our thirsty souls, in many passages
of heavy thoughts, and grievous complaints about our spiritual state.

1. In the distempers and damps of prayer, thus:

Suppose the dearest Son of the loving'st Father to lie grievously sick; and
out of the extremity of angvish, to cry out and complain unto him, that he is
so full of pain in every part, that he knows not which way to turn
himself, or what to do; and thereupon entreats him of all loves, to touch him
tenderly, to lay him softly, to mollify all he may his painful misery, and
give him ease. How ready, think you, would such a father be, with all
tenderness and care, to put to his helping hand, in such a ruefull case! But
yet if he should grow sicker, and weaker, so that he could not speak at all;
but only look his Father in the face with watery eyes; and moan himself
unto him with sighs and groans, and other dumb expressions of his increased
pain, and desire to speak: Would not this yet strike deeper into the Fathers
tender heart; pierce and melt it with more feeling pangs of compassion; and
make his bowels yerne within him* with an addition of extraordinary
dearness, and care to do him good? Even just so will thy heavenly Father be
affected, and deal with thee in hearing, helping, and showing mercy; when all
thy strength of prayer is gone, but only Eo se redactum dicit Ez^ ^^as, ^^t

groans and sighs. Nay, with incomparably more affectionatenesse For look
how far God is higher then Man in Majesty, and greatness, which is by an
infinite distance and disproportion; so far does he pass him in
tender-heartednesse and love. See Isai. 55. 8.9.

Or be it so, That thou art able to speak unto God, and in some measure to
utter thy mind; yet in thy conceit, it is so weakly, coldly, and confusedly,
that thou thinks; As well never a whit, as never the better, etc. Take notice
here; that Gods Child is able, First, sometimes to pour out his soul unto his
God with life and power: Secondly, sometimes to say something, but with much
coldness, deadness of heart, and distractednesse (as he The most righteous
persons, are their own greatest accusers. Greenh. p. 133. Edit 3.
complains), without his woonted feeling, and freedom of spirit: Thirdly, At
other times, he can say just nothing, but groan, and sigh, and only desire he
could pray. For this last, look upon the last passage. For the second; to wit,
when the Christian is troubled, that he can say something, and speak words
unto God; yet it is without that order, efficacy, fit phrase and comming-off so
comfortably, as he thinks is to be found in other Professors, etc. I say, in
this Case, consider, that as a Father is more delighted with the stammering and
stuttering, as it were; with the in-articulate, and imperfect talk of his own
little Child, when it first begins to speak; then with the exactest eloquence
of the most famous Orator upon earth: so Videas quantopere placeat Deo, vel
pauxillum sidei, and quantopere delectetur precibus ex quantulacunque fide
prosectis, etiamsi coniunctam habeant multiplicem imperfectionem. Videmus vulgo
parents magis delectari balbutienti infantia infantium, quam universa
eloquentia hominum eloquentissimorum. Nos omnes quod ad coelestia attinet,
insantes sumus, and ut in^antes sentimus, ut infantes loquimur. Pater autem
noster coelestis magis oblectatur ruditate, ac infantia nostra, qui sumus eius
^ilij, etc. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 4.
assuredly, our heavenly Father is infinitely better pleased with the broken,
interrupted passages, and periods of prayer in an upright heart, heartily
grieved, that he can do no better, nor offer up a more lively, hearty, and
orderly sacrifice; then with the excellently-composed, fine-phrased and most
methodicall petitions of the learned Pharisee. Nay, his soul extremely
loathes the one, and graciously accepts the other in Jesus Christ. As
concerning the complaint of coldness; be assured, that tho thy prayers
proceed out of thy mouth, faint and feeble, cold and uncomfortable; yet
springing from a sincere heart, purified by Faith, truly humbled under Gods
mighty hand for sin; seconded with groans and grief, with an holy anger,
and selfe-indignation, that they be not more fervent and piercing, and offered
in obedience unto God; are most certainly, as it were, by the way fortified,
and enlived with the pacifying perfections, and intercessory spirit of Jesus
Christ; sweetly perfumed with the precious Odours of his fresh-bleeding Merits,
and blessed Mediation; so that they strike the ears of the Almighty with far
greater strength, and irresistible importunity, then is ordinarily imagined:
And are as sweet smelling sacrifices in his nostrils; The very sight of whose
crucified Son at his right hand tendering the suite, can calm his most angry
countenance; and convert by a sacred meritorious atonement, his displeasures
and wrath, into compassions and peace. Now blessed be God, that the weak
prayers, and broken sighs of tempted and troubled spirits, have this happy
promise and prerogative: That before they press, as it were, into the presence
of God the Father, they are mingled in the mean time, with the sovereign and
satisfactory incense in the golden censer; whence evaporating out of the Angels
hand, (I mean the Angel of the Covenant, for so the truest Interpreters
understand the place) they ascend into the sight of our gracious Father,
incorporated and enwoven, as it were, into that precious and pleasing fume: And
that it pleases the blessed Spirit, in the needful time of spiritual
extremities, to draw the petitions of our sometimes speechless, heavy and
distracted hearts: Jesus Christ, the great Angel of the Covenant, to perfect,
perfume and present them: He that by an excellency, and title of highest
honor, is styled the Hearer of prayers, to receive them into his merciful
hand, and bosom of compassionate acceptance! Go on then poor soul; Thou
that sorely ^roopes under the sensible weight of thy manifold weaknesses, and
unworthiness this way; and thereupon sometimes sinfully draws back, with some
thoughts of giving-over quite; which is that, the Devil desires, and would
utterly undo thee forever; press forward in the name of Christ unto the
Throne of Grace, with a lighter heart, then thou art wont. Shall the Lord Jesus
call and cry for a Pardon for those, who put him to death; who were so far
from seeking unto him, that like so may Evening Wolves, they sought and sucked
his blood? and will he shut his ears, thinks thou, from thy complaints and
groans, who values one drop of his blood to quench thy spiritual thirst, at
an higher price, then the worth of many Worlds? Comfort thy self invincibly:
It cannot be.

2. In the faintness of Faith, and want of feeling.

Thou beholdest sometimes, a Father holding a little Child in his arms: now
whether, do thou think, is the Child safe by it is own, or by the Fathers
hold? It claspes about the Father with it is little weak hands, as well as it
can; but the strength of it is safety, is in the Fathers arm. Nay and the
Father holds the faster, when at any time he perceives the Child to have left
it is hold. Thou art Nos a Christo separari non possumus semel illi vere insiti.
Est autem coniunctio haec spiritualis. Spiritualem dico, qui^a spirituali modo
fit, per vincula nimirum spiritualia, non per nervos and ligamenta, per quae
fit coniunctio ista corporalis: sed per Spiritum and fidem. Christus prior
dimittit e coelo spiritum suum sanctum ad nos: Nos deinde vicissim fidem
nostram ipsius Spiritu excitatam, adeum sursum versus mittimus. Dico per
Spiritum simul and fidem: quia coniunctio haec oportet sit mutua, nosque
vicissim eum amplectamur. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 15.
tied, as it were, unto Christ by a double bond: first, of the Spirit, and
secondly, of Faith. Thou layest hold on Christ by Faith; and he holds thee by
his Spirit. Now thy Infant, Faith, or after some good standing in Christianity,
weakened and sorely wounded in thy present feeling, has lost it is hold-fast:
And therefore thou thinks, all is gone; and walks dejectedly, and
uncomfortably, as tho not any promise in Gods Book, or drop of Christ's Blood
were thine, etc. But assure thy self, being sound at the heart root, and
walking in the light, as God is in the light, thy heavenly Father in this Case
Iam cognito eo, quod Jesus Christus idem Deus sit, deinde sentimus nos teneri
eius manu, sentimus nos pariter apprehendi manu patris, ac Dei. Cumautem
sentimus nos prehendi manu patris, ac Dei, tum quidem videmur nobis firmi esse,
and extra omne periculum positi, etiam media morte. -- Nota fundamentum, in quo
f^ndata est vita aeterna; est autem manus illa Dei apprehendens nos; non^tam
manus nostra apprehendens Deum, quam Dei manus apprehendens nos. Idem. Ibid.
cap. 10.
holds thee so fast by his Spirit; that no Man or Devil, not all the powers of
darkness or gates of hell, can possibly pluck thee out of his hand. Nay, the
excellency of his power is most gloriously improoved, and made more illustrious
in thy greatest extremities, and extremest spiritual weakness. And he holds
it his highest honor, to hold thee the fastest, when thy hold is gone. Here
then and upon this ground, thou have a Calling; and ma^st comfortably, for he
is ever most loving and tender hearted, in times of temptation, to all that are
true of heart, exercise that most excellent act of faith; To believe without
feeling. To believe, when the face of God does shine upon thee with sensible
refreshing, and when thou enjoyest plentiful, and pregnant proofs of his
favor, is no great matter, no such maistery. But then to believe, when all
sense of Gods love is gone, and the light of his countenance hid from thee;
when all go quite cross and contrary in the apprehension of carnal reason;
then is the highest praise; this is the perfection of faith. The very dull,
senseless and soulelesse earth, upon which we tread, may teach us to rest and
depend upon God in such a Case. It is a mighty, and massy body, planted in the
midst of the thin air; and hangs upon just nothing in the world, but only
upon Gods Word; By that alone it is there established unmooveably, keeps his
place most steadily, never stirs an ynch from it. It has no props or pillars
to uphold it: no bars or beams to fasten it; nothing to stay and support it,
but the bare Word of God alone. He upholdeth all things by the Word of his
power, says the Apostle, Heb. 1.3. And yet not all the creatures in the world
can shake it, or make it tremble. Be it so then, that thy Faith has lost it is
hold-fast; that for the present, thou find no feeling; no encouragements of
joy, and peace in believing; no sensible pawnes, and pledges of Gods wonted
favor, etc. Yet for all this, cast thy self upon the sure Word of that mighty
God, who has established all the ends of the earth; and reared such a great
and goodly building, where there was no foundation: and questionless, thou
shall be more then infinitely, everlastingly safe, and settled like mount Zion,
which cannot be removed, but abides for ever.

3. In failings of new-obedience.

Thou puts thy son into imploiment, sets him about thy businesses; He
improves the utmost of his skill, strength and endeavor, to do thee the best
service he can, and please thee, if it were possible, to perfection: But yet
comes short of what thou desires, and fails in many particulars; and therefore
he weeps and takes-on; and is much troubled that he can give no better
contentment. Now tell me, thou, whose heart is warmed with the tenderness of
a Fathers affection, whether thou would not be most ready, and willing to
pardon and passe-by all defects and failings in this kind? Nay I know thou
would rejoice, and bless God, that he had given thee a Child so obedient,
willing and affectionate. Proportionably, thy heavenly Father sets thee on
work, To believe, repent, pray, read the Scriptures, hear the Word, confer,
meditate, love the Brethren, sanctify his Sabbaths, humble thy self in days
of fasting and prayer, pour out thy soul, day and night (as the times
require) in compassion, fellow-feeling, and strong cries for the Afflictions of
Joseph; the destruction of the Churches and those Brethren of thine, which
have so long lain in blood and tears; to be industrious and serious in all
works of justice, mercy, and truth, etc. And thou go about these blessed
businesses, with an upright heart, and in obedience unto God; but the several
performances comes far short of what his Word requires, and thy heart desires;
and thereupon thou mournes and grieves, and afflicts thy soul in secret,
because thou can not come-off with more power and life; nor bring that glory
unto God in thy Christian walking, which so many mercies, means, and such a
ministry may exact at thy hands. In this case now of these involuntary
failings, and humble disposition of thy heart, therefore be most assured, thy
All-sufficient Father will spare thee, Mal. 3.17.
as a man spares his own son, that serves him. Nay, and with so much more
kindness and love; Isai. 55.9.
as the heavens are higher then the earth, and God greater then man.

4. In case of a spiritual Desertion.

A Father solacing himself with his little Child, and delighting in it is
pretty, and pleasing behavior, is wont sometimes to step aside into a corner,
or behind a door, upon purpose to quicken yet more, it is love, and longing
after him, and try the impatiency and eagerness of it is affection. In the
mean time, he hears it cry, run about, and call upon him; and yet he
stirs not, but forbeares to appear; not for want of compassion and
kindness, which the more it takes-on, the more abounds; but, that it may
dearelier prize the Fathers presence; that they may meet more merrily, and
rejoice in the enjoyment of each other more heartily. Conceive then, and
consider to thine own exceeding comfort, that thy heavenly Father deals just
so with thee in a spiritual desertion. He sometimes hides his face from thee,
and withdrawes his quickening, and refreshing presence for a time, not for Deus
bonos non negligit cum negligit. Nec obliviscitur, sed quasi obliviscitur.
Ruff. in Psalm. Non deserit etiam si des^rat, in Psalm. 90. Abscondit se sponsus
cum quaeritur, ut non inventus ardentius quaeratur: and differtur quaerens
sponsa, ne inveniat: ut tarditate sua capacior reddita, multiplicius quandoque
inveniat, quod quaerebat. Greg. Mor. lib. in 5. cap. 4. Non est reversus
Sponsus ad vocem, and votum revocantis. Quare? ut desiderium crescat, ut
probetur affectus, ut exerceatur amoris negotium. Sane ergo dissimulatio est,
non indignatio. Bern. in Caut. Sermon 75. Non deserit, ut descratur. Simon. Cass.
in Evang. lib. 8. cap. 37. Deserit potius, ne descratur. Ideo videtur deserere,
quia non vult deseri. Hos. 14 4. Ier 31.3. Ioh. 17.26. Nam dilectio qua nos
persequitur Deus, proprie loquendo, non alia est quam qua filium suum ab initi^
dilexit, ut in eo nos quoque gratos sibi and ^mabiles redderet. Calv. in Loc.
Ioh. 15.9. Significat non vulgarem dilectionem suam erga ipsos, neque plan^
talem, qualis esse solet dilectio a creatura promanans, sed talem esse, qualis
est creatoris ipsius, and Dei ancor. -- Hoc est infinitus, and
incomprehensibilis, cuius longitudinem, latitudinem, profunditatem and
altitudinem, ^emo potest comprehendere, et qui superat omnem cognitionem.
Rolloc. in loc.
want of love, for he loves thee freely; He loves thee with an everlasting
love; he loves thee with the very same love, with which He loves Jesus Christ;
And that dear Son of his, loves thee with the same love, his Father loves him:
But to put more heat and life into thine affections toward him, and heavenly
things; To cause thee to relish communion with Jesus Christ, when thou enjoyest
it, more sweetly; to preserve it more carefully; to joy in it more
thankefully; and to shun more watchfully, whatsoever might rob thee of it: To
stir up all the powers of thy soul, and all the graces of God in thee; to
seek his face and favor again with more extraordinary, and universal
seriousness, and industry: For we find with pleasure, possess with singular
contentment, and keep with special care, what we have sought with pain. We
may see this in the Spouse: Cantic. 3.1, etc. under the pressure of a grievous
Desertion: Ponder every particular. By night on my bed I sought him, whom my
soul loves; I sought him, but I found him not. I will rise now, and go about
the City in the streets, and in the broad ways; I will seek him whom my
soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not. The Watchmen that go about
the city, found me: to whom I said; Saw ye him whom my soul loves? It was
but a little, that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loves: I
held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him to my mothers
house; and into the chamber of her that conceived me. I charge ye, O ye
daughters of Jerusalem, by the Roes, and by the Hindes of the field, that ye
stir not up, nor awake my Love, till he please. And lastly, that, when the
comfortable beams of Gods lightsome countenance shall break out again upon
thy soul, and thy Beloved is returned; thou may sing, that triumphant song
of Faith most joyfully; I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine. Desertions
then, and delays of this nature, are fruits of thy heavenly Fathers love; and
ought to be no discouragements unto thee at all, holding thy integrity. His
love thereby is intended toward thee, by the restraint of the influence, as it
were, and sense of it from thy soul, as a Brook grows big, by damming it up
for a while: And thy love is more enflamed toward him, when thou now feels by
the want of it, what an heaven upon earth it is, to have his face shine upon
thee, with it is quickening refreshing presence; and that a sensible embracement
of Jesus Christ in the arms of thy Faith, is the very life of the soul, as
the Soul is the life of the Body; the Crown of all sweet contentment in this
vale of tears, and a piece, as it were, of everlasting pleasures.

5. In times of trial.

Thou see sometimes a Father setting down his little One upon it is feet, to
try it is strength, and whether it be yet able to stand by it self or no; But
withal* he holds his arms on both sides, to uphold, it if he see it incline
either way, and to preserve it from hurt. Assure thy self, thy heavenly Father
takes care of thee with infinitely more tenderness, in all thy trials, either
by outward Afflictions, or inward temptations. The thou should fall, yet
shall thou not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth thee with his
hand: Psalm. 37.24* Never did Goldsmiths attend so curiously, and punctually
upon those precious mettalls he casts into the fire, to observe the very first
season, and be sure, that they tarry no longer in the furnace, then the dross
b^^ wasted; they thoroughly purified, and fitted for some excellent use; as our
gracious God lovingly waits, to take thee out of trouble and temptation; when
the rust (...) removed from thy spiritual armor; thy graces shi^^ out, and
thou heartily humbled, and happily fitted, to do him more glorious service for
the time to come; I mean, when he has attained the end, which he mercifully
intended in love, and for thy good.

6. In conceits of our unworthiness.

David commanded Ioab, and the other Captains, to entreat the young man
Absalom gently for his sake. 2. Sam. 18.5. A rebellious traitorous Son, up in
arms against his own Father, gracelesly, and unnaturally thirsting out of a
furious ambitious humor, to w^ing the Regal Scepter out of his hand, and to
set the Imperial Crown upon his own head: How dearly and tenderly then,
will the Father of mercies deal with a poor humbled soul, that sighs, and
seeks for his favor, infinitely more, then any earthly treasure, or the glory
of a thousand worlds?

7. I will suppose, thou have broke some special vow, (which were a grievous
thing) made before the Sacrament, upon some day of humiliation, or such other
occasion; and so forfeited thy self, as it were, and thy soul, into the hands
of Gods justice, to be disposed of to the dungeon of utter darkness, if thou
went served, as thy sin has deserved. And thereupon, thou art much
afflicted, and sore troubled in mind, to have suffered thy self to be so
sottishly ensnared again in such a dis-avowed sin, against so strong a
purpose. But here consider, whether thou, being a Father, would take the
forfeiture of a bond, and advantage of breaking day, especially full sore
against his will, from thy dearest Child, entreating thee to entreat him
kindly; Much, nay infinitely less, will thy heavenly Father deal hardly with
thee in such a Case, if thou complain at the Throne of Grace with a grieved
spirit; renew thy covenant, and tell him truly, that thou will, by the help of
the holy Ghost, guard thy heart with a narrower watch, and stronger resolution
for the time to come. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins: 1. John 1.9. And in such a Case, we have ever a blessed
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: Cap. 2.1.

8. A Father sometimes holds his Child over a Pond* River, or Well, to fright
him from it, lest at some time or other he fall into it. But the Child,
especially, if of riper conceit, and wiser thoughts, laughes, perhaps, in the
Fathers face, dreads no danger, dreams not of drowning. And what is the reason,
think ye? Only because he knows, he that holds him, is his Father: So thy
heavenly Father holds thee, as it were, over Hell in some strong temptation,
upon purpose to terrify thee from tampering so much with the Devils baits; so
that thou sees nothing about thee for the present, but darkness and
discomforts, and the very horrors of eternal death ready to take hold on thee:
yet for all this, upon the ground of this loving gracious resemblance thou
may be comforted; and cry confidently with Job, Tho he slay me, Job 13.15.
Psalm. 23.4.
yet will I trust in him; With David, Tho I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil. Isai. 50.10.
Who is among you, says the Prophet, that fears the Lord, that obeys the
voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him
trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.

9. A Son by the seducement of some dissolute and drunken Belials, is drawn
into lewd and licentious company; and so plunges presently over head and ears
into pestilent courses; Falls unhappily, to swaggering, drinking, gaming, the
mirth and madness of wine and pleasures; And at length to express to the
life, an exact conformity, to that complete character of the professors of
Good-fellowship, as they call it, and Epicurisme; both for pursuit of sensual
delights, and persecution of true professors; Wisd. 2.6, etc. 12, etc. Whereby
he wastes his Patrimony, cuts the heart of his Parents, wounds his conscience,
etc. His Father mournes and grieves, consults and casts about with all love and
longing for his recovery, and return: At length out of sense and conscience of
his base, and debosht behavior, vile company, dishonouring God, banishing good
motions, etc. He comes to himself, entreats his father upon his knees with
many tears, that he would be pleased to pardon what is past, receive him
into favor again; and he will faithfully endeavor to displease him no more,
but redeem the loss of the former, with the improovement of the time to come.
How willingly and welcomely, think you, would such a Father receive such a
son, into the bosom of his fatherly affection, and arms of dearest
embracement. And yet so, and infinitely more is our heavenly Father merciful,
and melting toward any of his relapsed children, returning unto his gracious
Throne, with true remorse and hearty grief, for so going astray. Which is an
incomparable comfort in case of backe-sliding; which yet God forbid.

10. A Father indeed, will lay heavier burdens upon his son, now grown into
years and strength, and puts him to sorer labor, and harder taskes; But while
he is very young, he is wont to forbear him with much tenderness and
compassion; because he knows, he is scarce able to carry himself out of the
mire: Even so, but with infinite more affectionatenesse and care,
watchfullnesse and love, does our heavenly Father bear in his arms, and
forbear, a Babe in Christ. See Isai. 40.11. This may be a very sweet and
precious cordial to weak consciences ar their first conversion: Who when they
cast their eye upon the heinousness and number of their sins, the fiery and
furious darts of the Devil, the frowns and angry foreheads of their carnal
friends, the worlds lowering and enmity, the rebelliousnesse and untowardnesse
of their own hearts, pressing upon them all at once; and so considering, that
refraining from evil, they make themselves a prey, are ready to sink, and
faint; and fear that they shall never hold out. For they may hence ground upon
it; being upright-hearted, and believing, that God, who knows their weakness
full well, will not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able; but
will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that they may be able to
bear it. So that over all these adversaries, and ungodly oppositions, they
shall most certainly be more then conquerours.

11. When thou art dejected in spirit* and walks more heavily, because thou
comes short of stronger Christians in all performances, services, duties and
fruitful walking* and thereupon suffers slavish doubts and distrusts, least
thy ground work be not well laid, to beat back, and bar out, all
spiritual joy, and expected contentment in thy Christian course; I say then,
and in such a Case, Suppose a Father should call unto him in haste, two of his
children; One of three years old, the other of thirteen: they both make all
the have they can, but the elder makes much more speed; and yet the little one
comes on wadling, as fast as it can; and if it had more strength, it would have
macht the other: Now would not the Father accept of the youngers utmost
endeavor according to it is strength, as well as of the elders faster gate,
being stronger? I am sure he would; and that with more tenderness too, and
taking it in his arms to encourage it. And so certainly will thy heavenly
Father deal with thee in the like Case, about thy spiritual state, being
true-hearted, and heartily grieving, praying, and endeavoring to do better.

12. Suppose a Child to fall sick in a family; The Father presently sets the
whole house on work for the recovery of it is welfare. Some run for the
Physitio^* others for friends and neighbors; Some tend it, others watch with
it; All contribute their several abilities, endeavors, and diligence to do
it good; And thus they continue in motion, affection, and extraordinary
imploiment about it; far more then about all the rest that are well, until
it recover. With the very same but incomparably more tender care, and
compassion* will thy heavenly Father visit thee in all thy spiritual maladies
and sicknesses of Soul. The whole blessed Trinity is stirred, as it were,
extraordinarily, and takes to heart thy troubles at such a time; Even as a
Shepeheard takes more pains, and exercises more pity and tenderness about
his sheep, when they are out of tune. See Isa. 40.11. Ezech. 34.16. upon which
places* hear the Paraphrase of a blessed Doct. P.
Divine, The Lord will not be unfaithful to thee, if thy heart be uprigh^
with him, tho thou be weak in thy carriage to him; for he keeps his
Covenant forever. And therefore in (...) 40. the Lord expresses it thus; you
shall know me; as sheep know their Shepherd, and I will make a covenant with
you, and thus, and thus I will deal with you: And how is that? Why the
covenant is not thus only; as long as you keep within the bounds, and keep
within the fo^ld; as long, as you go along the paths of righteousness, and
walk in them: but this is the Covenant that I will make; I will drive you
according to that you are able to bear: If any be great with young* I will
drive them softly* If they be lame, that they are not able to go (says he),
I will take them up in my arms, and carry them in my bosom. If you compare
this with Ezech. 34. You shall find there, He puts down all the slips we
are subject unto; (speaking of the time of the Gospel, when Christ should be
the Shepherd) he shows the Covenant that he will make with those that are
his; Says he, if any thing be lost, if a sheep loose it self, this is my
Covenant, I will find it: If it be driven away by any violence of temptation,
I will bring it back again: If there be a breach made into their hearts, by
(...) occasion through sin and lust, I will heal them, and bind them up.
This the Lord will do; this is the Covenant that he makes. But I was telling
you, the whole blessed Trinity takes on, (if I may so speak) after a special
manner, in all the spiritual troubles; especially, of all those, who are true
of heart. God the Fathers bowels of mercy yerne compassionately over thee,
when he sees thee spiritually sick. The distressed and disconsolate state of
thy soul, puts him into such melting and affectionate pangs, Isai 54.11.
as these: Oh thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted; behold, I
will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with Saphires,
etc. Comfort ye, and 40^.
comfort ye my people, says your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and
cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned;
etc. Jesus Christ, out of his own experience, knows full well, what it is to
be grievously tempted: what it is to have the most hideous thoughts, and
horrible injections thrown into the mind, that can be possibly imagined;
Nay, that the Devil himself can devise: See Mat. 4.6.9. What an hell it is,
to want the comfortable influence of the Fathers pleased face and favor. See
Mat. 27.46. And therefore he cannot choose but be afflicted in our
afflictions; and very sensibly and sweetly tenderhearted in all our spiritual
troubles. They pity us most in our sicknesses, who have felt the same
themselves. In that he himself suffered, and was tempted, he is able to
succor them that are tempted. Heb. 2.18. As for the blessed Spirit, it is his
proper work, as it were, To comfort them that mourn in Zion; To give unto
them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for
the spirit of heaviness. And yet besides all this thy heavenly Father, in the
distress of thy soul, sets also on work the Church of God about thee:
Faithful Ministers to pray for, and prepare seasonable and sound arguments,
reasons, counsels, and comforts out of Gods blessed Book; to support, quicken,
revive, and recover thee all they can: Private Christians, to commend thy Case
unto the Throne of grace, and mercy; and that extraordinarily with mightiness
of prayer upon their more solemn days of humiliation.

Vi^git matter se (...), quenum (...), in terram deicituram, ut ipse (...).
Simon. Cass. in Evang. ib. 14.
13. A Father sometimes threatens, and offers to throw his little-one out of his
arms: But upon purpose only to make him cling closer unto him. Our heavenly
Father may seem to cast off his Child, and leave him for a while in the hands
of Satan, for inward temptation; or to the rage of his bloody agents for
outward persecution; But it is only, to draw him nearer to himself, by more
serious seeking, and sure dependence in the time of trouble; and that with the
hand of his faith, he may lay surer hold upon his All Sufficiency.

Thus, and in the like manner, peruse all the compassionate passages of the
most tenderhearted parents, to their best beloved children, in all cases of
danger and distress: And so, and infinitely more tenderly will our heavenly
Father deal withal, that are upright-hearted, in all their troubles, trials,
and temptations. For the dearest love of the most affectionate Father or Mother
to their Child, is Si nos qui secundum nostram fil^os diligimus, satis tamen
profecto cos diligimus: multo magis ille diligit, qui diligit ultra naturam.
Sed etsi obliviscatur mulier infantem, inquit, uteri sui, ego tamen non
obliviscar tui, dicit Dominus Omnipotens. Chrysostom. in Mat. Hom. 23.
nothing to that, which he bears to those that fear him. Isa. 49.15. Psalm.
103.13. Deuteronomy. 8.5.

3. Thirdly, there is a precious Principle in the mystery of salvation; which,
as a comforting Cordiall-water, serves to quicken and revive in the sownings
and faintings of the Body, defection of the spirits, and sinking of the heart;
So it may be sovereign, to support and succor in afflictions and dejections
of Soul, and weaknesses of our spiritual state: It is thus delivered by
Divines.

Perkins in his Grain of Musterseed. Concl. 3.
A constant and earnest desire to be reconciled to God, to believe, and to
repent, if it be in a touched heart, is in acceptance with God, as
reconciliation, Faith, repentance it self.

Idem in his Exposition of the Creed, p. 127.
A weak faith shows it self by this grace of God, namely, an unfeigned
desire, not only of salvation, (for that the wicked and graceless man may
have); But of reconciliation with God in Christ. This is a sure sign of Faith
in every touched and humbled heart, and it is peculiar to the elect.

Idem upon the Sermon in the Mount, page 11.
Those are blessed, who are displeased with their own doubting and unbelief;
if they have a true earnest desire to be purged from this distrust, and to
believe in God through Christ.

Downam in his Christian Warfare, cap. 42.
Our desire of grace, faith and repentance, are the graces themselves, which
we desire; at least in Gods acceptance* who accepts of the will for the
deed, and of our affections for the actions.

Dyke of Repentance, cap. 15.
Hungring and thirsting desires are evidences of a repenting heart.

T.T. upon Psalm. 32. page 38.
True desire argues the presence of things desired, and yet argues not the
feeling of it.

(...) in his Exposition upon the Epistle to the Colossians, cap. 1. verse. 4.
It may not be dissembled, that there are in the world many definitions, or
descriptions of faith, such as do not comprehend in them that only thing,
which is the chief stay of thousands of the dear servants of God; and that
is, desires, which may not be denied to be of the nature of Faith. I express
my meaning thus: That when a Man, or woman is so far exercis^d in the
spiritual seeking of the Lord his God; That he would be willing to part with
the world* and all things thereof, if he had them in his own possession, so
that by the Spirit and Promises of God he might be assured, that the sins
of his former life, and such as presently do burden his Soul, were forgiven
him; and that he might believe that God were now become his God in Christ: I
would not doubt to pronounce, that this Person (thus prising remission of
sins at this rate, that he would sell all to buy this pearl) did
undoubtedly believe: Not only because it is a truth (though a Paradoxe) that
the Desire to believe is Faith. But also because our Savior Christ does not
doubt to affirm that they are blessed, Matthew. 5.6.
that hunger and thirst after righteousness, because they shall be satisfied.
And to him that is a thirst I will give to drink of the water of life freely.
Revel 21.6. Psalm. 10.17.
And David doubted not to say, The Lord hears the desire of the humble.

Rogers of Dedham in his Doctrine of Faith, cap. 2. page 128.
I think, whenever the humbled sinner sees an infinite excellency in Christ,
and the savor of God by him, that it is more worth then all the world; and so
sets his heart upon it, that he is resolved to seek it without ceasing, and
to part withal for the obtaining it, now I take it, is Faith begun.

What graces thou unfainedly desire; and constantly use the means to
attain; Thou have.

Crook, Sermon. 3.
There is no rock more sure then this truth of God; That the heart* that
complains of the want of grace, desires above all things the supply of that
want, uses all holy means for the procurement of that supply, cannot be
destitute of saving grace.

Greenham, page 144.
Such are we by imputation, as we be in affection. And he is now no sinner,
who for the love he bears to righteousness, would be no sinner. Such as we
be in desire, and purpose; such we be in reckoning, and account with God; who
gives that true desire, and holy purpose, to none but to his Children, whom
he justifies.

Dyke of Selfe-deceiving, cap. 19.
We must remember, that God accepts affecting for effecting; willing for
working; desires for deeds; purposes, for performances; pence, for pounds; and
unto such as do their endeavor, has promised His grace enabling them every
day to do more and more.

Perkins upon Galat. page 296.
If there be in thee a sorrow for thine unbelief; a will and desire to
believe; and a care to increase in Faith by the use of good means; there is a
measure of true Faith in thee; and by it thou may assure thy self, that thou
art the Child of God.

Broad* page 88.
It is a great grace of God to feel the want of Gods graces in thy self; and
to hunger and thirst after them.

Wilson Faith, p. 138.
If you desire healing of your nature; groan in desire to grace; perceive your
foulness unto a loathing of your self; fear not, sin has no dominion
over you.

Ibid. page 184.
Sense of Want of grace, complaint and mourning from that sense, desire settled
and earnest with such mourning to have the want supplied* use of good means,
with attending upon Him therein for this supply, is surely of grace.

What graces thou unfainedly desire, and constantly usest the means to
attain; Thou have.

Take it in short from me thus:

A true desire of grace argues a saving and comfortable estate.

The truth of which appears clearly, By Scriptures, Reasons, Both ancient and
modern Deuines.

Proofs. Mat. 5.6. Blessed are they, which do hunger and thirst after
righteousn^sse, for they shall be filled. Here to a desire of grace is annexed
a Promise of Blessedness, which comprehends all the glory and pleasures of
Christ's Kingdom here, and all heavenly joys and everlasting bliss hereafter.
Ioh. 7.37. If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. Psalm. 10.17.
The Lord hears the desire of the humble. Psalm. 145.19. He will fulfill the
desire of them that fear Him. Luke 1.53. The Lord fills the hungry with good
things. Reu. 22.17. Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let Him
take the water of life freely. Isa. 55.1. H^, every one that thirsts, come
ye to the waters, etc. And Cap. 44. verse. 3. I will pour water upon Him that
is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.

O Lord, I beseech thee, says Nehemiah, let now thine ear be attentive to
the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to
fear thy Name. Here, those who desire to fear the Lord, are styled His
servants; and proposed as men qualified, and in a fit disposition to have their
prayers heard, their petitions granted, their distresses relieved, their
affairs blessed with success. And no doubt, th^s Man of God would make
special choice of such Attributes and affections; which might prove
powerful, and pleasing Arguments, to draw from God compassion, favor, and
protection. And therefore a true-hearted desire to fear the Lord, is a sign
of His servant.

Abraham, as you know, Genesis 22. did not indeed, when it came to the Point,
sacrifice his Son: An Angel from Heaven stayed his hand. Only He had a will,
purpose, and resolution, if the Lord would so have it, even to shed the blood
of his only Child. Now this desire to please God, was graciously accepted at
his hands, as tho the thing had been done; and thereupon crowned with as many
blessings, as there are stars in Heaven, and sands upon the Seashore.

By my self have I sworn, says the Lord, because Thou have done this thing,
and have not spared thine only Son; (and yet He spilt not a drop of his
blood, save only in purpose and preparedness to do Gods will) Therefore will
I surely bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of the
Heaven, and as the sand which is upon the Seashore. verse. 16.17.

Rich men, Mark 12. cast into the Treasury large Doles, and royal offerings,
no doubt. For it is there said: Many that were rich, cast in much, verse. 41.
And yet the poor Widows two mites, receiving worth and weight from her holy
and hearty affection, in Christ's esteem, did out-valew, and over-weigh them
all. Verily, says Christ, I say unto you, that this poor widow has cast more
in, then all they which have cast into the Treasury.

Reasons. 1. One argument may be taken from the blessed nobleness of Gods
nature, and the incomparable sweetness of his divine disposition: Which by
infinite distance, without all degree of comparison, and measure of proportion,
does surpass, and transcend the ingenuousnesse of the noblest spirit upon
earth. Now, men of ingenuous breeding, and generous dispositions, are wont to
receive sweetest contentment, and rest best satisfied, in prevailing over, and
winning the hearts, good wills, and affections of those, who attend, or depend
upon them. Outward performances, gratifications, and visible effects, are often
beyond our strength and means; many times mingled, and quite mard, with
Hypocrisies, disguisements, famed accommodations, and flatteries; with
selfe-advantages, by-respects, and private ends: But inward reverence, and
love, kind and affectionate stirrings of the heart, are ever, and alone in our
power; and ever, by an uncontrole-able freedom, exempted from enforcement,
dissembling, and formality. No marvel then, tho the most royal, and
Heroical spirits, prize most, and be best pleased with possession of Men's
hearts; and being assured of them, can more easily pardon the want of those
outward Acts of sufficiency, and service (most minded by basest men) which they
see to be above the reach of their ability and power. Now if it be so, that
even ingenuous, and noble natures accept with special respect and esteem the
affectionatenesse, and hearty well-willing of their followers and Favorites;
tho they want dexterity, and means, to express i^ actually in visible
effects, and executions answerable to their affection: How much more are
spiritual longings, holy affections, thirsty desires, graciously accepted of
that God; in respect of whose compassions, the bowels of the most merciful man
upon earth are cruelty; In respect of whose immeasurably amiable, melting
sweetest disposition, the ingenuousnesse of the noblest spirit is doggednesse
and disdain. Especially since Men's good Turns, and Offices of love, turn many
times to our good and benefit, to our advancement, profit, preferment: But our
well-doing extends not unto God. Psalm. ^.2.
That infinite essential glory, with which the highest Lord, alone to be
blessed, adored, and honored by all for ever; was, is, and shall be
everlastingly crowned; can neither be empaired by the most desperate
rebellions; or enlarged by the most glorious good deeds. Can a man (says
Eliphaz to Job) be profitable unto God; Job 22.2^.
As He that is wise, may be profitable unto himself? Is it any pleasure to
the Almighty that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to Him* that thou make
thy ways perfect? And Cap. 35.6, 7 8. If thou sinnest, what do thou against
Him? Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what do thou unto Him? If thou
be righteous, what give thou to Him? Or what receives he of thine hand? Thy
wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righ^eousnesse may profit the
Son of Man. Were all the wicked men upon earth turned into humane beasts,
desperate Belials; nay, incarnate Devils; and the whole world full of those
out-ragious Giants of Babell; and, those also of the o^^ World; And all with
combined force and fury, should bend, and band themselves against Heaven; yet
they could not hurt God. The Lord is King, be the people never so impatient;
He sits between the Cherubins, be the earth never so unquiet. Or, Were all
the Sons of men Abraham's, or Angels; and as many in number, as the Quicunque
universum stellarum numerum comprehandisse and conscripsisse iactantur, sicut
Aratus vel Eudoxus, vel si qui alij sunt, eos Libri hutus contemnit authoritas.
Aug. de Civit. Dei lib. 16. cap. 23. Isai. 40.17.
Stars in Heaven; and as shining both with inward graces, and outward good
deeds, as they are in visible glory; yet could they make no addition unto that
incomprehensible Majesty above: They could not confer so much as one drop to
that boundless and bottomless Sea of goodness, or the least glimpse unto
that Almighty Sun of glory. All nations before Him are as nothing, and they
are counted to Him less then nothing, and vanity. Our sins hurt Him not: Our
holiness helps Him not: But what do I say? He gets nothing by us of all
that we do. All is for our selves. Our acknowledgement of Him makes Him no
stronger, wiser, juster, better, etc. then He is. But in glorifying him, we
glorify our selves, etc.

He was as glorious, powerful, wise, just, happy, and good before this World
was made, as now. D.V. Sin and righteousness, are the two Paths that we
walk in; Those are all that trouble us; the sins that we commit, and defects
of our righteousness. Says He, If thou sin, what is that to Him? It does
Him no hurt. Again, if thou fail in thy righteousness, or in thy
performances, it is all one, that way: For it reaches not to Him. Because he
is blessed for ever; He has all sufficiency in Himself, etc. Doctor Preston
in his Sermons of Gods All Sufficiency, Sermon. 4. Deus quaerit gloriam suam non
propterse, sed propter nos. Aquin. 22. q. 132.1.


It is only for our good, that God would have us good. No good, no gain
accrewes unto Him by our goodness. For what good can come by our imperfect
goodness, to that, which is already infinitely good? What glory can be added
by our dimnesse to Him, which is already incomprehensibly glorious? Every
infinite Thing is naturally, and necessarily incapable of addition: Possibility
of which supposed, implies contradiction, and destroys the nature of Infinity.
If it be so then, that good turns do good unto Men; and yet out of their
ingenuousnesse, they most esteem good wills, true heartedness, kind
affections: And can well find in their hearts, to passe-by failings, where
there is heart and good will, as they say; To pardon easily want of exactness
in performance, where there are unfeigned purposes. How much more will our
gracious God, who gains nothing by all the good works in the world, out of
the depth of His dearest compassions, kindly interpret, and accept in good
part, the holy longings, and hungry desires of a panting, and bleeding Soul?
How dearly will He love, the love of a true-hearted Nathanael? How willingly
will He take the will for the deed; the groanings of the Heart, before the
greatest Sacrifice?

But lest you mistake, take notice here of a twofold Glory:

Gloria Dei and Glorificatio Dei differunt. Gloria Dei. aeterna est, semper
eadem fuit ab aeterno, and ^emper ead^m manet in aeternum, cique nec accedere
quicquam, nec decedere potest, Deusque perpetuo gloriam suam habuisset, licet
nulla res suisset condita. Hae gloria Deo a nemine da^^, nec minui augeriue
potest, sed eadem in ipso fuit, and manet semper. Glorificatio vero sit in
tempore a Creaturis, and est extra Deum and sandamentum suum habet in
cognitione gloriae Dei. Polan. Syntag. Theolog. lib. 2. cap. 3.
1. Essential, infinite, everlasting. It is impossible that this should either
receive disparagement, and diminution; or addition and encreasement by any
created power. And this I meant in the precedent Passage.

2. The other I may call, Accidental, finite, temporary. This ebbs or slowes,
shines or is over-shadowed, as Goodness or Gracelesnesse prevails in the
world: As the kingdom of Christ, or powers of darkness get the upper hand amonst
the Sons of Men. In this regard indeed, Rebellious wretches dishonor God
upon Earth, I confess: And Godly men by their holy Duties, good works, and
gracious behavior, make his Name more illustrious in the world. But what is
this, to that essential, infinite, everlasting glory, which was as great and
full in all that former eternity, before the world was; When God, blessed for
ever, enjoyed only His glorious Self, Angels, Men, and this great Universe
lying all hid, as yet, in the dark, abhorred Dungeon of Nothing; as now it is,
or ere shall be?

2. A second reason may be taken from Gods proportionable proceeding in his
courses of justice and mercy. In his executions of Justice, and inflictions of
punishment; He interprets, and censures Assuredly, betwixt the unfeigned desire
of the heart to have, and the habitual having of the grace desired, there is
no great difference in Gods reckoning: No, no more then betwixt the evil
desire of a lusting heart, and the real accomplishment of the carnal act, the
former of which, by Christ's ungame-say-able testimony, makes guilty of the
latter: Mat. 5 28. By the Rule therefore of proportion; He that groaneth under
the burden of his sin, and hates the same. He that desires, and to his
desire adds endeavor not to sin, -- is with God reputed what, He would be in
his desire, and may in this regard cheer his heart, etc. Speght in his brief
Demonstration, etc. page 27. Virtues in Will and Act are the same in kind,
differing only in degree, as in vice, lusting after a woman in heart
unlawfully, is adultery in Him that lusts, tho it come not into Act: coveting
another man's goods inordinately, is theft, tho He be hindered from taking them,
Will in his Helps to Faith, page 82.83.
desires for the deeds, affections for Actions, Thoughts for the things done.
Whosoever, says Christ, looks on a woman to lust after her, has committed
adultery with her already in his heart. In Gods interpretation, in the search
and censure of divine justice, He that lusts after a Woman in his heart, is an
adulterer; and without true and timely repentance in the mean time, shall be
so taken, and proceeded against at that great and last Day. Whosoever hates
his Brother, says John, is a manslayer. An hateful thought of our Brother,
murders Him, and spils his blood, Mat. 5.28.
by the verdict of the blessed Spirit: And a malicious man, 1. Ioh. 3.15.
at the Bar of God, goes for a Man-slaier. If this then be Gods property,
and proceeding in justice, we may much more confidently expect: Nay, with
reverent humility challenge, way being made by the mediation of Christ, the
same proportionable measure in those His most sweet, and lovely inclinations,
and expressions of mercy. Shall a lewd desire after a woman fall under the Axe
of Gods justice, as if it were the gross Act^ of lust? And shall not a longing
desire after grace, be graciously embraced in the arms of mercy, as the grace
it self? Shall an angry thought invisible, immaterial, hurtful only to the
heart which harbors it, be charged with actual bloodshed? And shall not a
panting thirst of a broken, and bleeding Soul after Christ's saving and
sanctifying blood, be bathed and refresht in his precious blood? Yes
certainly, and much rather. For Gods tender mercies are over all his works:
Psalm. 145.9. And mercy with an holy exultation triumphs, and rejoices
against judgment: Iam. 2.13. His mercy is great unto the Heavens: Psalm. 57.10.
He does with much sweet contentment, and as it were, natural propension,
incline to the gracious effusions of mercy. He delights in mercy, says
Micah, Cap. 7.18. He is passingly plea^ed and exalted most gloriously, when
He is pardoning of sins, purging of Souls, pulling out of the Devils Paw,
pouring in of grace, shining into sad and uncomfortable hearts, saving from
Hell, etc. This makes Him so passionate in an holy sense, when He has no
Passage for his love. Deus. 5.29. Psalm. 81.13. Isa. 48.18. Mat. 23.37. Luke
19.41.42. But now on the other side, He is hardly drawn, not without much
reluctance, delays, forbearance, and, as it were, some kind of violence
offered, by excess of multiplied rebellious provocations, to exercise His
justice, and to punish for sin. See 2. Chron. 36.16. Hos. 6.4, etc. It
appears, Zeph. 2.2. by the emphasis of the (...) or (...) P^p^rit.
Original, that in this respect, in a right and sober sense, God is like a
woman with Child. When the cry of our sins comes first to Heaven, He does
not presently pour upon our heads fire and Brimstone, according to our desert:
But, as loath to enter into judgment with us, He then but begins to conceive,
as it were, wrath, which He bears, or rather forbeares full many and many a
month; still waiting, when upon our repentance, He might be gracious unto
us; until it come to that ripeness by the fulness and intolerable weight of
our sins, that He can possibly bear no longer. And then also, when He is
about to be delivered of his justly conceived, and long-forborne vengeance;
Mark how He goes about it: Ah! says He, etc. Isa. 1.24. (...) E^eu:
Humanitus dictum. Iun. Vt ostendat Deus se quodaminodo invitum cogi ad poenas

certum est pravitate nostra huc adigi, quia eius beneficentiae liberum cursum
non permittimus: praesert^m vero propensus est ad suos humaniter tractandos,
and dum videt indulgentiae suae non esse amplius locum, quasi tristis ad
puniendum accingitur. -- Mihi magis probatur hoc loco dolentis esse vocem: Quia
Deus soederis sui memor, libenter electo populo parceret, nisiomnem veniam
excluderet obstinatio. Calv. in loc. Vnde colligimus, quanta sit eius
^^sericordia and benignitas, quum sententiam serens ingemiscat, and singultis

This aspiration argues a compassionate Pang of grief, speaking after the
manner of men, to proceed against His own people, tho they had provoked Him
as enemies. How shall I give thee up, Ephr^im? How shall I deliver thee,
Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeb^im? Mine
heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together: Hos. 11.9. When
He came against Sodom and Gomorrah, the most prodigiously wicked people, that
ever the Earth bore; What a miracle of mercy was it, that He should be brought
so low, as to say; I will not destroy it for tennes sake: Genesis 18.32. So it is
then, that mercy flows naturally and easily from God, and he is most forward,
and free-hearted in granting Pardons, and receiving into grace and favor: But
justice is ever, as it were, violently with cart-ropes of iniquity, pulled from
Him. He is pressed with our sins, Optime sluet contextus, si dicamus, Ecce
ego constringor sub vobis, quemadmodum si essetis plaustrum plenum manipulis,
hoc est, estis mihi intolerabiles. Calvin. in loc.
as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaues; before we wring from Him the
vials of just wrath, and wrest out of His hands, the Arrows of deserved
indignation. That you err not in this Point, conceive, that both Gods mercy
and justice are originally and fundamentally, as God Himself, infinite, Both
of the same length, height, breadth, and depth; that is equally endless,
boundless, botomlesse, unsearchable. Yet, if we consider the exercise and
execution of them amongst the creatures, and abroad in the world; Mercy, that
sweetest Attribute, and most precious baulme to all bruised hearts, does far
surpass and outshine the other, tho incomparable excellencies of His divine
nature, and all the perfections, which accompany the greatness of God: As
appears, Exodus 20.5.6. Genesis 18.32. Joel. 2.43. Jonah. 4.2. Psalm. 36. and 103.
2. Chron. 21.13. His influences and beams of mercy are fairly and plentifully
shed into the bosom of every Creature, and shine gloriously over all the
earth, even from one end of Heaven to the other. The whole world is thick set,
and richly embroidered, as it were, with wonderful variety of impressions, and
Passages of his goodness and bounty. In this great Volume of Nature, round
about us, we may run and read, the deep Prints and large Characters of
kindness and love, which His merciful and munificent hand has left in all
Places, in every leaf, and Page, and line of it. If mercy then be so
graciously magnified over Qui lu^m rei est in mund^ ^ui Deus non ^dsit sua
providentia e^ misericordta, etc. Nemo est hominum vel etia^ dia^olorum, qui
dicere (...) non esse particip^^a ^isericordiae Dei. Z^nch. de Natura Dei lib.
4. cap. 4. q. 3.
all his works, we may more strongly build upon it; That if the hand of
Justice seize upon an hateful thought, as a murderer, and stained with blood;
and arraigne a lustful conceit, as guilty of adultery, and actual pollution;
His arms of mercy will most certainly embrace, and accept of a sincere desire
for the deed done; of hearty affections for the Actions; and of a grieved
spirit for the grace it groans for.

Object.
Yea, but may some say: If mercy be so fair a flower in the garland of Gods
incomprehensible greatness; if it so far excel his other Attributes in
amiablenesse amongst His creatures; How comes it to pass, That the number of
His Elect is so small; and the sway of the multitude sink down under the
burden of their iniquities, transgressions and sins into the Pit of endless
Perdition? How comes it to pass, that out of the great heap, and mass of all
mankind, there are made but so few vessels of mercy; and that so many
vessels of wrath are justly for their sins, filled brim-full with the vialls
of everlasting vengeance. See Matthew. 7.13.14. and 20.16.

Answ.
Some matter of Answer to this Point, would ye think it! may be taken even
from the Aquin. p. 1. q. 23. art. 7. Ad tertium.
Schoolmen.

If we consider, first, The unconceiveable eminency, and unvalewable worth of
the Crown of glory; Videre Deum per essentiam est supra naturam, non soli^m
hominis, sed etiam omnis ^ ^aturae. 12 a q. 5. art. 5 Hear also that in
co^parable Confounder of all Popery; who^ not all the Jesuits in Christendom
shall be ever able to confute, either in this World, or the World to come. Et
si omnes homines Deus damitar^t^uno excepto: tamen adhuc mayor esset
misericordia, quam iudicium. Nimirum, quia nullum sit iudicij divini es^ellum
nisi propter merita eorum, qui damnantur: at misericordia nulla invenit merita.
Chamier. tom 3. lib. 7. cap. 8.
which does so far, and disproportionably surpass and transcend the common
state, and condition of our nature. Secondly, The pretiousnesse of the effusion
of the blood of the dear and only Son of God, for the purchasing of that so
glorious a Crown. Thirdly, Deus non potuit producere creaturam non
defectibilem: quia ex nihilo creavit, quia non creatorem: At homines inquis
saltem, and spiritus im^^^abiles creasset. Sic hominem, hominem; Angelum,
Angelum non condidisset. Si enim aliter creati essent, velsi immobiles, and
immutabiles essent facti; vel trunco, aut lapidi similes essent facti, vel
creatori suo Deo: Illud fieri non debuit, Hoc fieri neque potuit neque debuit:
Si enim in homine vel Angelo immutabile bonum esset, aeternum illud esset; si
aeternum infinitum, si infinitum, non homo, Angelus, aut creatura esset, sed
Deus. Deus autem si solus, unus, bonus, infinitus non est, Deus non est; Cum de
alio, quam de Deo, and uno, infinitum intelligi non possit. Nec diminuitur
omnipotentia eius, sed astruitur. Qui enim ille esset omnipotens, qui sibi
aliquid simile, and aequale habere aut sacere posset? Qui autem infinitus, si
extra se, non solum aliquid, sed alia infinita innumera haberet? Immo quinam
ille infinitus, qui infinitum faciendo, nihil ulterius facere posset, cum in
infinito sintomnia? Et nunquid Omnipotens Deus in aliud Omnipotens, quod
potentia sibi aequale foret, omnipotentiam suam exercere possit? In Thesi mea
Oxon. confirmata. Peccatum provisum non est causa reprobationis.
The necessary, and inevitable defectibility of the Creature. Fourthly, The
most free, and wilful Apostasy of Adam, and in Him, of all his Posterity.
Fifthly, The abominable and villainous nature, and stain of sin, etc. Why
should we not rather wonder at the unsearcheablenesse of Gods mercy, for
advancing one Soul to that endless bliss in Heaven; then to repine at the
equity of His justice, if He should have Ad executionem decreti, quod ita
factum in aeterna praedestinatione, in utramque partem concurrunt me^ia, quae
ipsa non possunt, non subijci praedestinationi. Hic ergo vera, and iusta est
damnationis causa peccatum: nempe quia nemo, aut damnatus sit unquam, aut
damnetur, aut damnandus sit, nisi propter peccatum: ac proinde, re, actuque,
praecedente peccato: quod invasit omne genus humanum: ita ut, si liberet,
posset Deus absque ulla, iniustitiae nota, omnes homines nullo penitus excepto
in aeternum ignem praecipitare. Quo iure egisse manifestum in omnes Angelos
malos. Chamier. Tom. 3. lib. 8. cap. 1. Dicit ei Judas, non ille Iscariotes].
Miratur quodammodo, quod cum tanta sit gratia Domini, is non extendat eam ad
universum mundum, sed ad paucos duntaxat aliquos. Sic mirantur homines
quotidie, cum hoc admiratione sit dignum potius, quod Dominus vel unius
alicuius mis^reatur, cumomnes in eodem sint reatu. Ipsi Angeli admirantur
tantam Dei misericordiam, dum intu^ntur mysterium salutis humanae; and pij
omnes magis ad id obstupescunt, quod videant Deum ergase misericordem, quam
quod videant and sciant reiectos esse alios complures. Rolloc. in Johan. cap.
14. verse. 22.
suffered all the polluted and sinful sons of Adam, to pass from the
Mass of corruption, into which they freely fell, on their own accord and
cursed choice, through a rebellious life, into the endless miseries of their
deserved confusion? Would it not have been a greater marvel, to have seen
any one, clearly convinced, and found guilty of that most horrible villainy,
that ever was bred in Hell, or heard-of in the World; I mean, the Popish
Powder Treason, pardoned; then all those desperate Assasins to have justly
perished in their so abhorred and execrable rebellion? And it is utterly
un-imaginable either by Man or Angel, what a deal of mercy does flow out of
the Bowels of Gods dearest compassions, through the hearts-blood of his only
Son, to the washing and salvation, but of one Soul!

3. A third Reason may be taken from it is part, and interest in the Fountain
of salvation, and Rivers of living water. He that thirsts after grace, is
already enrighted to the Well of life, and fulness of heavenly bliss, by a
promise and protestation from Gods own mouth: Revel. 21.6. I will give to Him,
that is athirst, of the Fountain of the Water life, freely. In that Place,
after God himself had confirmed, and crowned the truth and certainty of the
gloriousness of the holy City, and the happiness of the Inhabitants thereof,
with a solemn asseveration of his own immutability and everlastingnesse; It
is done: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, He then notifies, and
describes the persons, to whom the promise, and possession of so great and
excellent glory, does appertain; and those also which shall be eternally
abandoned from the presence of God, and burned in the Lake of fire and
brimstone for ever.

Inhabitants of Heaven Elect, are,

1. Humble Souls thirsting after grace, Gods favor, and that blessed
Fountain opened to all broken hearts for sin, and for uncleanness.

I will give to him that is athirst, of the Well of the water of life freely.
verse. 6.

2. Christ's champions here upon earth against the powers of darkness, and
conquerers of their own corruptions,

He that overcommeth, shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he
shall be my son: verse. 7.

But the fearful, etc. are marked out for Hell: verse 8. For all that cursed
crew, and slaves of sin, are overcome of Satan and their own lusts, and so
carried away captives into everlasting misery and woe.

Cast not away thy confidence then, Poor heart! No, not in the lowest
langvishings of thy afflicted soul; If thou be able to say syncerely with
David, Psalm. 143. My Soul thirsts after Thee, as a thirsty Land. If thou
feel in thy affections an hearty hunger after rightousnesse, both infused, and
imputed; as well after power against, as pardon of sin; Be assured, the Well
of life stands already wide open unto thee, and in due time Thou shall drink
thy fill. Thy soul shall be fully satisfied with the excellencies of Jesus
Christ, Evangelicall joys, as with marrow, and fatness; and Thou shall be
abundantly refreshed out of the river of his pleasures.

4. That which Paul tells us in the Point of communicating to the necessities
of the Saints; to wit, If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted
according to that a Man has, and not according to that He has not: 2. Cor.
8.12. holds true also, in all other services, and divine duties: So that we
are accepted with the Lord, according as we are inwardly affected, although our
actions be not answerable to our desires. He that has a ready, and resolved
mind, to do what He may; would undoubtedly do a great deal more, if
ability were ministered. God, Philip. 2.13.
says Paul, works both to will, and to do. If both be His own works; the
desire, as well as the deed; He must needs love, and like both the one, and
the other, both in respect of acceptance and reward. David did but conceive a
purpose to build God an house; and He rewarded it with the building, and
establishing of his own House: 2. Sam. 7.16. He did but conceive a I said, or
thought* That is, I purposed, I resolved. Tailor in his Way to true Happiness.

Besides Scripture and reasons, I add ancient and modern authority; not for
any further confirmation, but only to show consent.

Again; The more we find our unworthiness; and the less we find the
promises to belong unto us; the more we must desire them: being assured, that
this desire does greatly please God; who desires, and wills, that His grace
should be earnestly desired.

When I have a good desire, says Loc. Com. par. 1.
Kemnicius, tho it does scarcely show it self in some little and slender sigh,
I must be assured, that the Spirit of God is present, and works His good
work.

Faith* says Catechis.
(...) sin, in the most holy men in this life, is imperfect and weak: yet
nevertheless, whosoever feels in his heart an earnest desire, and a striving
against his natural doubtings, both can, and must assure Himself, that He is
endued with true Faith.

If thou shall feel thy self, says Si senseris iam te credere in Christum,
etiam propter Christum, aut saltem si non poteris id statim assequi, (ut omnes
natura nobis ipsis sumus addicti) si senseris velle te credere in Christum
propter Christum, velle te omnia sacere Dei gratia, and ex animo, habes
profecto egregium imprimis argumentum perseverantiae in fide, and fidei quae
perpetua sit futura. In Johan. cap. 5.
Rolloc, to believe in Christ, and that for Christ; or at l^ast, if thou can
not forthwith attain that; -- If thou feel thy self willing to believe in
Christ, for Christ; and willing to do al things for Gods sake, and syncerely;
Thou have certainly a very excellent argument, both of perseverance in Faith,
and of that faith, which shall last for ever.

Our faith may be so small and weak, says In His Marks of Gods Children.
Tassin, as it does not yet bring forth fruits, that may be lively felt in us;
but if they which feel themselves in such estate, desire to have these
feelings [namely, of Gods favor and love]; if they ask them at Gods hands by
prayer; this desire and prayer are testimonies, that the spirit of God is in
them, and that they have Faith already: For is such a desire a fruit of the
flesh, or of the spirit? It is of the holy Spirit, who brings it forth only
in such, as He dwells in, etc.

Is it possible, says Lib. 5. Sect. 60.
Hooker, speaking of Valentinian the Emperor, out of Ambrose, that He which
had purposely the Spirit given Him to desire grace, should not receive the
grace, which that spirit did desire?

Ibid.
Where we cannot do what is enjoined us, God accepts our Will to do, in
stead of the Deed it self.

I am troubled with fear, that my sins are not pardoned, says Careless. They
are, answered Acts and Monum. in Bradsords letter to Careless. In the Story of
Careless, page 2105.
Bradford: For God has given thee a penitent, and believing Heart: that is, an
heart, which desires to repent, and believe. For such an One is taken of Him,
(He accepting the Will for the Deed) for a penitent and believing heart.

Before I come to the use of this comfortable Point, lest any coozen themselves
by any mis-conceites about it; As the notorious Sinner, the mere Civil Man,
and the formal Professor, may all do very easily; take notice of some Marks
of this saving Desire. It is:

1. Supernatural. For it follows an effectual conviction of sin, and
cooperation of the spirit of bondage, with the preaching and power of the Law,
for a through casting a Man down in the sight of the Lord, showing and
convincing Him to be a Sink of sin, abomination and curse; to be quite
undone, lost and damned in Himself. (Which preparative work, precedent to the
desire, I speak of, is it self above nature). Whereupon the Soul thus
illightened, convinced, and terrified, being happily lead unto, and looking
upon the glorious mystery of the Gospel, the excellency and offer of Jesus
Christ, the sweetness and freeness of the Promises, the heavenly splendor,
and riches of the Pearl of great price, etc. does conceive by the help of the
holy Ghost, this desire, and vehement longing. Which you may then know to be
saving, when it is joined with an hearty willingness, and unfeigned resolution
to sell all; to part with all sin; to bid adieu for ever to our
darling-delight, etc. It is not then an effect only of self-love; not an
ordinary wish of natural appetite, like Baalams, Numb. 23.10. Of those who
desire to be happy, but are unwilling to be holy; who would gladly be saved,
but are loath to be sanctified.

2. It ever springs from an humble, meek, and bruised spirit; very sensible,
both of the horror of sin, and happiness of pardon; both of it is own
emptiness, and of the fullness in Christ: Never to be found in the affections
of a Self-ignorant, Selfe-confident, unhumbled Pharisie.

3. It must be constant, importunately greedy after supply and satisfaction.
Not out of a Pang, or passion only; or begot by the tempest of some present In
a twinge of conscience, or in a fit, when He is told of Heaven, He could be
content to leap out of his skin to get Heaven, and to get out of Hell: But
after this is over, He cannot away with this confessing of his sins in
secret; with this rending of his Soul; with this earnest contending with God;
and with this crossing of his own nature, and fighting against the lusts of
His flesh, even with this laboring for the righteousness of God above all
things. Whately* Gods Husb. cap. 15.
extremity, like a flash of lightning, and then quite vanishing away, when the
storm of terror and temptation is over. For if a sincere thirst after Christ,
be once on foot, and takes root in an heart truly humbled, it never Long
aberit a siti satietas, long a satietate fastidium; quia sitientes
saturabimur, and satiati sitiemus. August. de Sper. cap. 29.
determines, or expires, in this life, or the life to come.

4. It is ever enlinckt, and enlived with a continued, and conscionable use,
and exercise of the means; and draws from them by little and little
spiritual strength, and vigor; much vital efficacy and increase: Not idle,
ignorant, un-exercised. It were very vain and absurd, to hear a Man talk of
His desire to live; and yet would neither eat nor drink, nor sleep, nor
exercise, nor take Physic, nor use those means which are ordinary and
necessary for the maintenance of life. It is as fruitless and foolish for any
one to pretend a desire of grace; after Christ; and to be saved; and yet will
not prize, and ply the faithful Ministry, the Word preached and read, prayer,
meditation, conference, vows, days of humiliation, the use of good company,
and good books, and all divine Ordinances, and blessed means appointed, and
sanctified by God, for the procuring and preserving a good spiritual state.

5. It is not a lazy, cold, heartlesse, indifferent desire; but earnest, eager,
vehement* extremely thirsting, as the parched earth for refreshing shewers; or
the hunted Heart for the Water-brookes. Never was Ahab more sick for a
Vineyard; Rachel more ready to die for children; Sisera, or Samson for thirst;
then a truly humbled Soul after Jesus Christ, after bathing in His blood, and
hiding it self in His blessed righteousness. This desire deads the heart to
all other desires after earthly things, gold, good-fellow-ship, pleasures,
fashions, even the delights of the bosome-sinne, etc. All other things are but
dross and dung vanity and vile, in respect of that object it has now Then
will He say, I have discerned mine own misery, my poverty and nakedness, and I
have found a Treasure, Christ Jesus and his righteousness^: It shall go hard
but I will get it. Yea, but there is a price put upon it. It must cost thee
dear; a great deal of sorrow, trouble, and other crosses. Tush, tell me not
of any price, speak not of that: wha^soever I have shall go for it. I will
do any thing for it. Why, will thou curb thine affections? Will thou give up
thy life? Wi^t thou be content to sell all that thou have? etc. I will do it
with all my heart. I am content to sell all that I have. Nothing is so dear
unto me, but I will part with it; my right hand, my right eye; Nay, if Hell it
self should stand between Me and Christ; yet would I pass through the same
unto Him. This is that violent affection, that God puts into the hearts of
those, who seek Him in truth, that they will have Christ, whatsoever it cost
them. D.V.
found out, and affects. As Aarons Rod, managed miraculously by the hand of
divine power, swallowed up all the other Rods of Pharaohs Sorcerers: So this
spiritual desire, planted in the heart by the holy Ghost, eats up, and
devoures, as it were, all other desires, and over-eager affections after
worldly contentments, as worthless, vain, transitory; as empty Clouds, Wells
without water, Comforters of no value. We that deal with afflicted
consciences, hear many times some expressions of this impatient violent desire
in troubled minds. I have borne nine children, said One, with as great pain, I
think, as other women: I would with all my heart, bear them all over again,
and pass again through the same intolerable pangs every day, as long as I
live, to be assured of my part in Jesus Christ. Complaining another time, that
she had no hold of Christ, it was said unto Her: But does not your heart
desire, and long after Him? Oh! says she, I have an Husband and Children, and
many other comforts; I would give them all, and all the good I shall ever see
in this World, or in the World to come, to have my poor thirsty Soul refresht
with that precious blood of His, etc.

6. It is growing, from appetite to It is not a poor, faint wishing and
woulding, -- But a mighty and effectual desire, that does bring forth an
endeavor. It makes a Man put forth Himself, to effect the thing desired. He
wishes to obey, as a resolute Soldier wishes victory, so as He will fight
for it, and draw his weapon, and meet his enemy in the face, and hazard limme
and life, and give and receive blows, and leave nothing undone, that his wit
serves him to think of, for the achievement of victory. Whately, Gods Husb.
cap. 15.
endeavor; from endeavor to action; from action to habit; from habit to
some comfortable perfection and tallnesse in Christ. If it be quite quenched
and extingvished, when the spiritual angvish and agony is over, or stand at a
stay, never transcending the nature of a naked wish, it is to be reputed
rootelesse, heartlesse, graceless. There are Christians that lie as yet, as it
were, struggling in the womb of the Church; who for a time at the least, live
spiritually, only by grievings and groans, by hearty desires, eager longings,
and affectionate stirrings of spirit, etc. There are also Babes in Christ;
young men in Christ, strong men in Christ, Psalm 92.12.13.14. Acts 21.16.
old Christians. A perpetual infancy argues a nullity of sound and saving
Christianity. The Child that never passes the stature and state of an Infant,
will prove a Monster: He that grows not by the sincere milk of the Word is
a true Changeling, not truly changed. He that rests with contentment, upon a
desire only of good things, never desired them savingly. But here, lest any
tender conscience be unnecessarily troubled, I must confess; It is not so
growing, as I have said, or not so sensibly at certain times; as while the
pangs of the New Birth are upon us, in times of desertion, temptation, etc. Tho
even then, it grows in an holy impatiency, restlesnesse, longing, etc. Which
is well-pleasing unto the Father of mercies in the mean time; and which He
accepts graciously, until He give more strength.

The Point thus cleared, is very sweet and sovereign; but so, that no carnal
Man must come near it, no stranger meddle with it; much less, Swine trample
upon it. It is a Jewel for the true-hearted Nathanaels wearing alone. Nay, the
Christian himself, in the time of his Souls health, height of feeling, and
flourishing of His Faith, must hold off His hand: Only, let Him keep it fresh
and orient in the Cabinet of His memory, as a very rich Pearl against the Day
of spiritual distress. As precious and cordial waters are to be given only
in swounings, faintings and defection of the spirits: so this delicious Manna
is to be ministered specially, and to be made use of, in the straits and
extremities of the Soul. At such times, and in such Cases as these: In, 1. The
strugglings of the New Birth. 2. Spiritual Desertions. 3. Strong temptations.
4. Extraordinary troubles upon our last Bed.


1. For the first. When thou art once come so far, as I intimated before: To
wit, that after a through conviction of sin, and sound humiliation under Gods
mighty hand, upon a timely and seasonable revelation of the glorious Mystery of
Christ, His excellencies, invitations, His truth, tender-heartednesse, etc.
(For the desire, I speak of, is an effect and affection wrought ever
immediately by the Gospel alone); I say, when in this Case thine heart is
filled with vehement longings after the Lord of life: If thou be able to say
with David; Psalm. 143.6.
My soul thirsts after thee, as a thirsty Land: If thou feel in thy self
an hearty hunger and thirst after the favor of God, that Fountain opened for
sin, and for uncleanness, and fellow-ship with Christ; Assuredly then the
Well of life is already opened unto thee, by the hand of thy faithful
Redeemer, and in due time thou shall drink thy fill. He that is Alpha and
Omega, the Beginning and the End; the eternal and unchangeable God has
promised it. And amid the sorrows of thy trembling heart, and longings of thy
thirsty soul, thou may even challenge it at His hands, with an humble, sober
and zealous confidence. As did that See the Preface written by G. Abbot, Doctor
of Divinity; before the Examinations, Arraignement, and conviction of George
Sprot, Notary in Ayemouth, page 23.
Scottish Penitent, a little before his Execution: He freely confessed his
fault, to the shame, as He said, of Himself, and to the shame of the Devil,
but to the glory of God. He acknowledged it to be so heinous and horrible,
that had he a thousand lives, and could he die ten thousand deaths, He could
not make satisfaction. Notwithstanding, said he, Lord, thou have left me this
comfort in thy Word, that thou have said; Come unto me all ye, that are weary
and laden, and I will refresh you. Lord, I am weary; Lord, I am heavily laden
with my sins, which are innumerable. I am ready to sink, Lord, even to Hell,
without thou in thy mercy put to thine hand, and deliver me. Lord, thou have
promised by thine own word, out of thine own mouth, that thou will refresh
the weary soul. And with that, He thrusts out one of his hands; and reaching,
as high as He could, with a louder voice, and a strained, cried; I challenge
thee, Lord, by that Word, and by that Promise which thou have made, that thou
perform, and make it good unto me, that call for ease and mercy at thine
hands, etc. Proportionably, when heavy-heartednesse for sin has so dried up
thy bones; and the angry countenance of God so parched thine heart, that thy
poor soul begins to gasp for grace, as the thirsty Land for drops of rain;
thou may, tho dust and ashes, with an holy humility thus speak unto thy
gracious God: O merciful Lord God, thou art Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
the end. Thou say; It is done, of things that are yet to come; so faithful
and true are thy decrees and promises. And thou have promised by thine own
word, out of thine own mouth; Revel. 21.6.
that unto Him that is athirst, thou will give of the Fountain of the water of
life, freely. O Lord, I thirst, I faint, I langvish, I long for one drop of
mercy. As the Heart pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul after
thee, O God, and after the yerning bowels of thy woonted compassions. Had I now
in possession the glory, the wealth, and the pleasures of the whole World; Nay,
had I ten thousand lives, joyfully would I lay them all down, and part with
them, to have this poor trembling soul of mine received into the bleeding
arms of my blessed Redeemer. O Lord, and thou only know it, my spirit
within me is melted into tears of blood, my heart is shivered into pieces: Out
of the very place of Dragons, and shadow of death, do I lift up my thoughts,
heavy and sad, before Thee: the remembrance of my former vanities, and
pollutions, is a very vomit to my soul; and it is full sorely wounded with
the grievous representation thereof. The very flames of Hell, Lord! the fury of
thy just wrath; the scorchings of mine own conscience, have so wasted, and
parched mine heart, that my thirst is insatiable. My bowels are hot within me;
my desire after Jesus Christ, pardon and grace, is greedy as the grave, the
coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame. And Lord, in
thy blessed Book thou calls and cries: Isai. 55.1.
Ho, every One that thirsts! come ye to the waters, etc. In that great day
of the Feast, Thou stood'st, and cryed'st with thine own mouth, John 7.37.
saying; If any man thirst, Let Him come unto me, and drink. And these are
thine own words; Matthew. 5.6.
Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, shall be filled. I challenge
thee Lord, in this my extremest thirst after thine own blessed Self, and
spiritual life in Thee, by that Word, and by that Promise, which thou have
made, that thou perform, and make it good unto me, that lies grovelling in the
dust, and trembling at thy feet. Oh! Open now that promised Well of life; For I
must drink, or else I die.

Hear then, and in a word, is thy comfort; In these hungrings and thirstings
of the soul, there is, as it were, the spawne of Faith, semen fidei, there is
aliquid fidei in them; as excellent Divines, both for learning and holiness,
do affirm: Howsoever, or in what phrase soever it be expressed, sure I am,
such desires so qualified, as before, shall be fulfilled, satisfied,
accomplished, possessed of the Well of life, and that is abundant, to put the
thirsting Party into a comfortable and saving-state, as I said at first. The
words of Scripture are punctual, and downright, for this which I say: Blessed
are they, which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be
filled: Mat. 5.6. If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. Ioh.
7.37. The Lord hears the desire of the humble. Psalm. 10.17. He will fulfill
the desire of them that fear Him. Psalm. 145.19. The Lord fills the hungry
with good things. Luke 1.53. Let Him that is athirst, come. And whosoever will,
let him take the water of life freely: Rev. 22.17. H^, every One that
thirsts, come ye to the waters, etc. Isa. 55.1. I will pour water upon him
that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; Cap. 44.3. These longings and
desires, this hunger and thirst, before a sensible apprehension, and enjoyment
of Christ, arise from a sense of the necessity and want of His blessed Person,
and precious bloodshed; which the afflicted Soul now prizeth before ten
thousand Worlds; and for whose sake, is most willing to sell all, and to
abandon wholly the Devils service for ever: Those, after a full entrance into
the holy Path, and joyful grasping of the Lord Jesus in the arms of our
Faith, arise partly from the former taste of unutterable sweetness we found in
Him; partly from the want of a more full, and further fruition of Him,
especially when He is departed, in respect of present feeling; as in times of
desertion, extraordinary temptation, etc. In the Passage that is past, I
understand the former; in those that follow, the latter.

2. Secondly, Concerning desertions I intend a larger, and more particular
discourse; and therefore I pass by them, here.

3. Thirdly, We may have recourse for comfort to this precious Point, in some
special temptations of doubtfullnesse, and fear about our spiritual state;
When spiritual life is run, as it were, into the root, in some particulars;
and actual abilities to exercise some graces, and discharge some duties, are
returned to nothing for the present, but groans, desires, and longings to do,
as God would have us.

For instance:

Thou art much afflicted, because thou feels the spirit of prayer not to
stir and work in Thee with that life and vigor, as it was wont; but
begins to langvish in the inward man, for lack of that vital heat and
feeling, in the mutual intercourse, and commerce between God and thine own
Soul; which heretofore has many times warmed thine heart with many sweet
refreshings, springing from a comfortable correspondence between thy holy
eiaculations, and his heavenly inspirations; between thine humble complaints
at the Throne of Grace, and his gracious answers: Nay, it may be, thou throws
down thy self before His Seat of mercy, in much bitterness of spirit; and
for the time, can say little, or nothing; the present dullness, and
indisposition of thine heart, stopping all passage to thy woonted prayers, and
damming up, as it were, the ordinary course of thy most blessed heart-ravishing
conference with thy God in secret. But tell me true, poor Soul; Tho at such
a time, and in such an uncomfortable Damqe, and spiritual deadness, thou
feels not thine heart enabled, and enlarged for the present, to pour out it
self with accustomed fervency and freedom; yet does not that heart of thine,
with an unutterable thirst and desire, long to offer up unto his Throne of
Grace, thy suites and Sacrifices of prayers, and praises, with that heartinesse
and feeling, with all those broken, and bleeding affections, which a grieved
sense of sin, that hangs so fast on, and an holy greediness after pardon,
grace and nearer communion with his heavenly Highness, are won^ to beget in
truly-humbled Souls? If so; Assure thy sel^^ this very desire is a prayer of
Tamet si sensus omnes nostri dolor occupati sint, et prae moestitia sint
praclusae fauces, Dominus tamen corda nostra pervidet, and pia suspiria

extraordinary strength, dearness and acceptance with thy God. I say; with
that, thy merciful Lord God, who is as far more compassionately, and
lovingly affected to his Child, then the kindest Father to his dearliest
beloved Son* as the infinite love of a tenderhearted God, does surpass the
faint affection of a frail, and mortal man. Suppose thy dearest Child were
in great extremity, and should at last grow so low and weak, that it were not
able to speak, but only groan, and sigh, and cast it is eye upon Thee; as One
from whom alone, it looked for help: Would not thine heart melt over thy Child
a great deal more in that misery, then ever before, when it was able to
express it is mind? I am sure it would. It is just so, in the present Point.
For, like as a Father pittieth his children: so the Lord pittieth them that
fear Him. Nay, and much Si nos qui secundum naturam diligimus filios, satis
tamen profecto eos diligimus: multo magis ille diligit, qui diligit ultra
naturam. Chrysostom. in Matthew. Hom. 23.
more, if we consider the muchnesse and quantity. For look how far God is
higher then man in Majesty and greatness; which is with an infinite distance,
and disproportion; so far does He pass him in tender-heartednesse and
mercy. See Isa. 55.8.9.

Thou may sometimes upon the awakening, illumination, and search of thy
conscience, after some drouzy repose, and deeper sleep upon the bed of
security; some fouler ens^arement, and longer abode in some known scandalo^s
sin; after the Canker of earthly cares, and teeth of worldly-mindednesse
have, ere thou be well-aware, with an insensible pleasing consumption, eaten
too far into the heart of thy Zeal, and other graces: In the apprehension of
some present terror, arising from a more serious, and sensible survay of the
now abhorred villainies, and abominations of thine unregenerate time; or from
the grieved remembrance of thy falls, and failings; of thy sins, and
unservice-ablenes since thy conversion (which I am persuaded, trouble the
Christian most, and go nearest to his heart), etc. I say, in such Cases, as
these, Thou may feel such a fearfulness and faintness to have surprised
the hand of thy Faith, that it cannot so presently and easily recover it is
former hold; nor claspe about the glorious justice, and meritorious blood of
Christ, with that fastness and firmness of assent, with that comfort and
confidence, as it was wont. So that for a time, Thou may lie under the
torture of an heavy heart, uncheerfullnesse in all thy ways, and some degree
of horror; because thou can get no better hold-fast. (But more is thy fault:
For never did dearest Father so lovingly entertain into His greedy arms, a
penitent Son, returning from going astray: then our merciful God, upon thy
renewed humiliation, is willing to shine upon thee again, with the refreshing
beams, and blessings of his woonted favor). Yet tell me true, dear Heart,
Tho for the present, that precious and happy prayer of Paul for the Romans,
Romans 15.13.
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, be not fulfilled
upon thy Soul; Tho thy former joyful feelings be turned into distrustful
fears: yet does not that heavy heart of thine desire far more to be
re-comforted with the presence, and pleased, face of thy Beloved; then crowned
with the glory and pleasures of many worlds? Would thou not much rather,
feel the hand of thy Faith fastened again with peace, and full persuasion upon
the Person, Passion and promises of the Lord Jesus; then graspe in thy bodily
hand, the richest Imperial Crown, that ever sat upon any Caesar's head? If
Satan's spiteful craft, taking a cruel advantage of thy present dejection of
spirit, do not hinder thy trembling heart from telling the truth; I know, thou
can not deny this. And then I must tell Thee; These hearty longings, and
longing desires in the mean time, until God give more strength, be right
dear to that tenderhearted Father of thine; which does infinitely more
esteem one groan or sigh from a broken spirit, then a thousand rams, or
ten thousand rivers of oil; and are most precious and piercing to that
compassionate heart, that poured out it is warmest and dearest blood to purchase
the salvation, and refresh the sadness of every truly-humbled Soul. Ground
upon it then, and be of good cheer: If thy troubled spirit filled with the
sense of the want of it is former, sweet, and joyful feelings, find in it
self a true and hearty longing after the supply of that want; a constant, and
conscionable pursuit of all holy means for the procurement of that supply; I
can assure Thee in the Word of life, and truth, in Gods season, Thou shall be
satisfied. Psalm. 145.19.
He will fulfill the desires of them that fear Him: He also will hear
their cry, and will save them. And this blessed promise, for the accomplishment
of thy desire, is as surely thine, as the breath in thy Body. He must sooner
cease to be God, and deny Himself* which is more then infinitely impossible,
and prodigious blasphemy to imagine; then fail in the least circumstance, or
syllable of all His love, and promises of life to any One, that heartily loves
Him. All the sacred Sayings in His holy Book, and all those promises of
salvation, are signed with the hand of Truth it self, and sealed with the
blood of His beloved Son; And so are far surer, then the Pillars of the
Earth, or Poles of Heaven: For Heaven and Earth must pass away, before any
title of His Word fall unto the ground. And therefore, as He will most
certainly pour upon the hairy Pate of every One, which hates to be reformed,
all the plagues and curses threatened there, even to the least spark of the
flames of Hell; and the last drop of the full vials of His infinite, endless,
unquenchable wrath: so will He abundantly make good to every upright Soul,
syncerely thirsting after Jesus Christ, in the best time, all the promised good
in His blessed Book, and that above all expectation, expression, conceit.

4. Fourthly, Thou may be diversely distressed upon thy Bed of death.

1. Casting thine eye back upon thy whole life, all thy sins from Adam to
that hour; and willing, as thou must now take thy farewell, so to take thy
fill of repentance; They appear to the eye of thy conscience far more in
number, and more ougly, then ever before. And no marvel; for being now
sequestered for ever from all worldly comforts, and company; distractions, and
diversions, and the clouds of natural fear, raised by the dreadful
circumstances of approaching dissolution; uniting, as it were, and collecting
the sight of thy Soul, which imploiments in the world, commerce amongst men,
and Sunshine of outward prosperity, did before too much disperse, dazzle, and
divert; they are represented far more to the life, and in their true colors.
Whereupon, comparing the poor weak nothingnesse, as thou now apprehends, of
thy godly sorrow, hatred, and opposition against them, with thy present
apprehension of their heinousness, hatefulness, and horrible number; Thou
begins to be dejected, and know not well what to think of thy Self. I say
then, for thy comfort, consult with thy sanctified heart; and thou shall find,
and feel an infinite hearty desire, that thy repentance for them, detestatio^
of them, and heart-rising against them, had been, and now were as through,
sound, and resolute, as ever was in any penitent Soul, that breathed the life
of grace upon earth.

2. Secondly, Revising now, thy whole Christian conversation; spending of
Sabbaths, pouring out prayers, reading Scriptures, hearing the Word, love of
the Brethren, days of humiliation, works of mercy, receiving the Sacrament,
godly conference, living by Faith in all estates, etc. Thou may see them in
this last, impartial, clear, retired examination of thy conscience, to have
been pestered with so many failings, imperfections, deadness of spirit,
distractions, distempers; that thou begins to fear and conceive; As well never
a whit, as never the better, as they say, etc. In this case also, reflect upon
the holy habitual disposition of thy heart; and thou shall feel it thirsting,
and longing unfainedly, that all the holy duties, and good deeds, that ever
passed through thy heart and hands, had been done in answerable exactness to
the rules of divine Truth; and if it had so pleased God, with absolute freedom
from all infirmities.

3. Thirdly, Thou may be troubled at that time; because, being perhaps, as
yet, but of little standing in Profession, thou have done God so little
service; and in that short time, have not stood on Gods side with that courage
and life, nor walked in his holy ways, with that watchfulness and Zeal, as
thou might. And it cuts thy heart the more; because thou spent so much of
thy time, in serving thy self and Satan; and expectest now, to enjoy immortal
joys and a Crown of endless bliss. But here is thy comfort. It is the
unfeigned desire, and resolution of thine heart; If the Lord would be pleased
to allow Thee a longer time in this life, and add many more years unto it;
Thou would double thy diligence, and improove all oportunities, to do thy
God every way far more glorious service, then heretofore all the days of
thine appointed time; Oh! then thou would do so, and so, etc.

Assure now thy self, in these three cases, and troubles upon thy last Bed;
this sincere desire of thine upright Soul, will be graciously accepted of our
merciful God, in the Name of Jesus Christ: As tho, first, Thy repentance had
been to the full: Secondly, Thy obedience to the height: Thirdly, Thy present
promises, vows and resolutions, for future forwardness and fruitfulness
performed to the utmost. For when all is done, Jesus Christ is All in All: He
alone is the only Sanctuary, and Tower of everlasting safty, for every truly
humbled Soul to fly unto, both in life and death: He is made unto us
wisdom, 1. Cor. 1.30.
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.

I come now, as I promised, to some special Cures, and particular application
of comfortable Antidotes, to diverse spiritual Maladies; of which, Christians
specially complain; to those terrors and temptations, which are wont most to
afflict sin-troubled, and truly-humbled Souls.

1. I will suppose, Thou art effectually and savingly wrought-upon, by the
Preaching and power of the Word; illightned, and convinced to acknowledge, and
feel thy self to be a most sinful and cursed wretch by nature; lost and
forlorn, damned and utterly undone in thy self, etc. And upon the opening of
the glorious Mystery of the Gospel, and offer therein of the Person, and
precious merits of Jesus Christ, for the present binding-up of thy broken
heart, and endless blessedness, Thou art ravished with extraordinary
admiration and affection, after that hidden Treasure and Pearl of great price;
holding thy self happy, that ever thou wast borne; and made for ever, if thou
can get possession of it; but a gone-man, if thou can not get it, and an
everlasting Castaway. Most willing therefore art Thou to sell all that thou
have; prizing it infinitely before the riches, glory, and pleasures of the
whole earth, etc. In which state, thou have a strong, direct, and special
Calling, to fill thine hungry Soul with Jesus Christ; to lay hold upon his
Person, Sufferings, promises, and all the rich purchases of his dearest blood,
as thine own for ever; 1. Cor. 1.30. 1. Pet. 1.8. Philip. 4.7.
To take Him, as thy wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
redemption; that so unspeakeable joy, and full of glory, peace which passes
all understanding, Evangelicall pleasures, which neither eye has seen, 1.
Cor. 2.9.
nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of Man, might abundantly
flow into thine heart, from the Fountain of all comfort. Though it be a Truth
clearer then the Sunne-beames, that a brokenhearted sinner ought to embrace
mercy so strongly enforced: yet there is no Truth, that the heart shuts it
self more against, then this, especially in sense of misery, etc. Doctor
Sibbes, in his Preface to the B.K.
But yet so it is; alleging, that thou art the unworthiest upon earth; the
vilest of Men; No heart so hard as thine; thy sins far above ordinary; of
an abominable and most abhorred streine; of a scarlet and crimson die: for thou
have done so and so; sinned many and many a time against that Divine, nay, and
even natural light; which stood in thy Conscience, like an armed Man;
persecuted the Saints; lived in Sodom, etc. And that which troubles thee most
of all, for all these sins, thy sorrow is very poor and scant, in no
proportion to thy former heinous provocations. I say, upon these, and the like
mistaken grounds, Thou very unadvisedly professes, but against thine own Soul,
That as yet, Thou can not, thou dares not, Thou will not, meddle with any
mercy, apply any promise, or be persuaded, that Jesus Christ belongs unto
Thee. What? Such a vile, unworthy, abominable wretch at thou! to expect such
glorious things; to come near so pure a God; to lay violent hands upon the
Lord of life, and look for everlasting bliss! Alas! Say what you will, say
thou, as yet I cannot, I dare not, I will not. Whereupon Thou wilfully, as it
were, lies still upon the Rack of much spiritual terror, and trouble of
mind; And which is a miserable addition and mischief, for which Thou may
thank thy self; art all the while far more liable, and lies much more open
to Satan's most horrible injections, and cruellest temptations to self
destruction, despair, plunging again into former pleasures of
Good-fellowship, and the like.

It grieves me to consider, how fearfully and falsely thou deceives thine own
heart, in a point of so great importance, to thy much spiritual hurt, and
further horror. Why, therefore art thou most welcome to Jesus Christ; because
thou art so sensible of thy Vt quisque abiectissimus erit, tantum abest quin
desperationis causa sit suae paupertas, ut inde potius debeat animum colligere
ad Christum quaerendum. Sed meminerimus non alios censeri pauperes, nisi qui
sibi ipsis tales sunt: hoc est, qui suae inopiae sensu oppressi iacent. Musc.
in Mat. cap. 11.
spiritual misery, and beggary; because thou art so vile, so abominable, so
unworthy and wretched in thine own conceit. Mat. 9.12.13.
Those that be whole, need not a Physician; but they that are sick. Christ
came not to call the (...), id est, eos, qui sibi iusti videntur, sive qui se

righteous, but sinners. And in this respect, He is said to Romans 4.5.
justify the ungodly; and to die for the 1. Pet. 3.18.
unjust; And to seek those that find themselves lost. For our encouragement
to a through work of bruising, and patience under Gods bruising of us, let us
all know, that none are fitter for comfort, then those that think themselves
furthest off. Men, for the most part, are not lost enough in their own
feeling, for a Savior. A holy despair in our selves, is the ground of true
hope. Doctor Sibbes Bruised R. page 43.
And therefore, that which thou makes thy greatest discouragement to come unto
Christ, should be, and in truth is, the greatest encouragement, to cast thy
self with confidence into the bosom of His love.

But before I come to speak more fully to the Point, Let me premise this
Principle:

When a Man is once syncerely humbled under Gods mighty hand, with sight of
sin, and sense of divine wrath; so that now all his former wicked ways,
pollutions, and provocations of Gods pure eye, lie so heavy upon His heart;
that He is truly weary, willing to be rid of them all, unfainedly thirsting
after the blood and holiness of Christ: And therefore as well content to take
upon him His sweet and easy yoke, for to please Him in New-obedience for the
time to come; as to partake of the merit of His Passion, for the present pardon
of His sins; I say, then He must conceive, that He has a sound,
seasonable, and comfortable Calling, to lay fast hold upon Jesus Christ; and to
be undoubtedly persuaded, that He has his part and portion in Him. And
besides, that Gods blessed Word determines it, He may the rather assent unto
the season, and the more boldly believe; Because He has now found, and feels
by his own experience, the practice of that double policy of the Devil, so
often discovered unto Him heretofore by Gods faithful Messengers, to wit; That
whereas He was a long time most industrious to ^eepe His heart resolutely
stubborn, and unstird against the might and piercing of the most powerful
Ministry; and when at any time He once perceived it to begin to work upon
Him, raised all possible oppotion against His yielding: So now, when He is
truly touched indeed, and resolute to abandon His Hellish slavery for ever; He
labors might and maine, with all restless cruelty and malice, to keep His
conscience continually upon the Rack. To this purpose, He objects and urges
to the utmost, the heinousness of his former sins, the fierceness of Gods
wrath, which He cunningly concealed before; the littleness of His sorrow; His
unworthiness to meddle with any promise, and the like. And what is the reason,
think you, that He, who was so dawbing before, is now so downeright; He,
that was so indulgent before, is now so desperately bloody, and for nothing but
despair, and damnation? It is easy to tell; For that foul Fiend knows full
well, if a poor Soul in the supposed case, and such a truly-humbled state,
shall but come now, when Christ calls Him, and set to His seal, that God is
true; which not to do, shall ever be an unmannerly madness, and wilful
cruelty to a man's own conscience, He is then quite gone out of His kingdom
of darkness; and an immortal Soul is pulld out of His Hellish Paw for ever.
This is the true reason, why He so rages, when He sees a weary Soul make
toward Jesus Christ for rest. I have often foretold you of Satan's method, and
malice, in managing His temptations in this kind; that being forewarned, ye
may be fore-armed. He plots first, and prevails with most amongst us, to keep
them from terror and trouble for sin. But if they be once happily wounded
that way, then His next plot, is to allay, and take away the smart by outward
mirth; or dawbe, and draw over a skin only with unsound and superficial
comfort. But if He find, that it bleeds still, and will not be stanched, but
only by the blood of Christ; and that no earthly pleasure can any whit assuage
the pain; then in a third Place does He cast about, and contend with all
cruelty, to keep the poor Soul in a perpetual sad slavish trembling* that
it may not dare to meddle with any comfort, or apply the promises; but
cherishing the bruise, against the counsel of the Prophets, bleed inwardly
still. And this Point He plies with more eagerness and fury, because the very
next step, to wit, but even reaching out of this spiritual Gulf and grief
for sin, toward the merciful hand of Christ, holden out to help Him up, is
the next and immediate Act, by which a man is quite, and for ever pulled out of
His power, and put into the Paradise of grace.

Or in a word, and shorter thus: Tho thou come freshly out of an Hell of
heinous sins; and hitherto, have neither thought, or spoke, or done any thing
but abominably: yet if now with true remorse thou groans under them all, as an
heavy burden, and syncerely longest for the Lord Jesus, and newness of life;
thou art bound presently, ipso facto, as they say, immediately after that Act,
and unfeigned resolution of thy Soul, to take Christ Himself, and all the
promises of life as thine own for ever. All delays, demurres, exceptions,
objections, pretexts, standing out, scruples, distrusts, and contradictions to
the contrary, are dishonorable to Gods mercy and free grace, disparagement to
the Promises, derogatory to the Truth and tender-heartednes of Jesus Christ; an
unnecessary detainement of the Soul in terror; and only a gratification of
that roaring Lion, whose trade is to tear souls in pieces, and torture them
all He can. For as soon as we are poor in spirit, we are presently blessed;
Mat. 5.3. As soon as we are weary of our sins, the Hand of Christ is ready to
take off the burden, Mat. 11.28. As soon as we thirst, in the sense I have
said, the Fountain of the water of life, is set wide open unto us; Rev. 21.6.
As soon as we have got contrite and humble spirits, we become royal Thrones,
for the High and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, to dwell in for ever; Isa.
57.15.

And now come and take abundantly mighty Arguments, and invincible motives,
which neither Man, nor Devil, nor natural distrust can ever, any ways
possibly disable; Not to lie any longer, being in the proposed and supposed
state, upon the rack of terror; but to lay hold upon the Rock of eternity. I
mean, to rest and establish thy trembling heart upon the Lord Jesus, with
everlasting peace and safty; and after walk watchfully and fruitfully in the
holy way, until thine ending hour.

1. And first, take notice, that Jesus Christ, God blessed for ever, keeps an
open house for all such hungry and thirsty souls. Let him that is athirst,
come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely; Rev. 22.17.

prizeth the Well of life before the whole world, and is ever accompanied with
an unfeigned resolution to sell all, for the Pearl of great price; I say, such
an One may come, and welcome, and that without bidding, and drink his fill of
the Rivers of all spiritual pleasures. If there were no more, but this, this
is more then enough to bring Thee to Jesus Christ. If a Proclamation should be
made that such, or such a great Man kept open house for all comers, there need
no more to bring-in all the poor, hungry people in the Country, without any
further waiting or inviting. But here above all degrees of comparison, the
hunger is more importunate and important; the Feast-maker more faithful and
sure of his word; the fare more delicious and ravishing: And why do thou
refuse? Thou have a warrant infinitely above all exception. The Lord of life
keeps open house for all that will come: And thou know in thine own
Conscience, and can not deny, but that He has already He that wills
then, even he that is athirst for the waters of life, let Him give all the
praise to God, who has endued him with that grace; and let him know, that were
it not for the grace of God, He should never have had any will to come to
those waters. Idem. Ibid.
honored Thee with that singular favor, as to plant in thy Soul a will this
way, with a witness, as they say; For what would thou not part with, to
have assurance of thy part in Jesus Christ? What would thou not give, if it
might be bought, to hear Him speak peace unto thy Soul, and say sweetly unto
it; I am thy salvation? And therefore if thou come not in presently, and take
the comfort of this precious Place and Promise; setting to thy seal that God
is true; Consider by the premises, whether thy terrors and temptations be
not justly upon thee, in the mean time.

2. If this will not serve, which God forbid; then in a second Place, Thou art
invited solemnly, by the Feast-Maker, as it were, Himself with his own mouth,
which is an infinite mercy, O quam stupenda pietas! Quam intra Dei dignatio!
Quem rogare debuimus, ut nos recipere dignaretur; ab ipso rogamur, ut ad cum
venire dignemur. Gers. De Verbis Domini, venite, etc.
honor and comfort: Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest: Mat. 11.28. Here is no exception of sins, times, or
Persons. And if thou should reply, Yea, but alas! I am the unworthiest man
in the world, to draw near unto so holy, a God; to press into so pure a
presence; to expect upon the sudden such glorious, spiritual, and heavenly
advancement; most impure, abominable, and beastly wretch, that I am! readier
far, and fitter to sink into the bottom of Hell, by the insupportable
weight of my manifold heinous sins: I say then, the Text tells thee plainly,
that thou mightily mistakes; For therefore only art thou fit, because thou
feels so sensibly thy unfitness, unworthiness, vileness, wretchedness: The
sorer and heavier thy burden is, the rather should thou come: In a word, it
appears, by thine own words, expressing such a penitent apprehension of thy
spiritual poverty; that thou art the only man, and such as thou alone, which
Christ here specially aimes-at, invites, and accepts.

3. Thirdly, He knowing our frame, our sluggish, dull and heavy disposition;
our spiritual laziness, natural neglect of our own salvation, and
loathnesse to believe; adds in an other Place, to ordinary invitation, a
stirring compassionate* and quickening (...) O, Heus vocandi, Ies. 55.1. Buxtorf.

exclamation: Ho, says He, Isa. 55.1. Every one that thirsts, come ye to
the waters, etc. And lest any think He shall come to His cost, or should
bring any thing in His hand, He calls upon Him that has no money; and thus
doubles His cry: Come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money, and without price. O most blessed and sweetest lines! So full of love
and longing, to draw us to the Well of life; that besides that holy pang of
compassion, and excitation, Ho; He cries thrice, Come, Come, Come! Yea, but
may thou say, Alas! I am so far from bringing any thing in my hand, that I
bring a world of wickedness upon my heart; and that above ordinary, both in
notoriousnesse, and number; and therefore I am afraid the heinousness of my
sins will hinder my acceptance; tho the invitation be most sweet and
precious: Be it so; yet the Spirit of God in the same Chapter does purposely
meet with, and remoove that very scruple: Let the wicked, says He, forsake His
way, and the unrighteous man His thoughts: (And this is thy Case; Thou art
unfainedly set against all sin both inward and outward), and let him return
unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon Him, and to our God, for He will
abundantly pardon: verse 7. He will not only have mercy upon thee, but He
will also abundantly pardon. He will (...) a (...) Quod est multiplicare.
multiply His pardons, according to thy provocations, and that with (...)

super-abundance: Romans 5.20.

4. If all this will not yet do; He descends out of the infinite riches of
his grace to a miracle of further mercy. For the mighty Lord of Heaven and
earth sends Ambassadors unto us, dust and ashes, worms and no men, to beseech
us to be reconciled unto Him. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as
though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's st^ad, be ye
reconciled unto God, 2. Cor. 5 20. What man can possibly ponder seriously upon
this Place; but must be transported with extraordinary admiration; nay,
adoration of the bottomless depth, and infinite height of Gods
incomprehensible, everlasting and free love: We most abhorred, vile wretches,
are the Offenders, Traitors, Rebels and enemies; and ought to seek and sue unto
Him first, upon the knees of our souls, trembling in the dust: and if it were
possible, with tears of blood; and yet He begins unto us, entreating us by His
own Son, and His servants the Ministers, to come in; accept His favor and
grace, enter into the wise and good way; which is See Prove. 3.14.15.16.17.
precious, profitable, honorable, and pleasant; that He may hereafter set upon
our heads everlasting Crowns of glory and bliss. An earthly Prince would
disdain, and hold it in foul scorn, to send unto His inferior for
reconcilement; especially, who had behaved Himself basely, and unworthily
toward Him, and justly provoked His royal indignation. Would not the King of
Spain, think you, so great a Monarch, hold it an inexpiable dishonor and
indignity, to send Ambassadors now, and sue unto the Hollanders, so far
below Him, for reconcilement and peace; promising and assuring them, of an
entire restitution, and exercise of all their These Spaniards being mere
strangers, having no natural regard in their government to the maintenance of
those Countries and people, in their ancient, and natural manner of their
peaceable living, as the most Noble and wise Emperor Char^es; yea, and as His
Son Philip Himself had, whilst He remained in those Countries, and used the
Counsels of the States, and Natives of the Countries, not violating the ancient
liberties of the Countries: but contrariwise, these Spaniards being exalted to
absolute government, by ambition, and for private lucre, have violently broken
the ancient Laws and Liberties of all the Countries, and in a tyrannous sort
have banished and destroyed, without order of Law, within the space of few
months, many of the most ancient and principal Persons of the natural
Nobility, that were most worthy of government. And howsoever in the beginning
of these cruel persecutions, the pretense whereof was for the maintenance of
the Romish Religion; yet they spared not to deprive very many Catholics, and
Ecclesiastical Persons of their Franchises and privileges: and of the
chiefest that were executed of the Nobility, none was in the whole Country
more affected to that Religion, then was the most noble and valiant Count of
Egmond, the very glory of that Country; who neither for His singular
Victories, in the service of the King of Spain, can be forgotten in the true
Histories; nor yet for the cruelty used for His destruction, to be but for
ever lamented in the hearts of the natural people of that Country. See a
Book entitled, A Declaration of the causes, mooving the Queen of England to
give aid to the defense of the people afflicted and oppressed in the
Low Countries, page 5.6.

tyranny, and severest kind of persecution under heaven, the Spanish
Inquisition; that He would resume His former Philip the second of Spain, after
many preceding vastations and pressures, did lastly by strong hand, and maine
force, attempt not only to make himself an absolute Monarch over the
Hollanders; but Turke-like to tread under His feet, all their National and
fundamental Laws, Privileges, and ancient Rites. To effect which, after He
had easily obtained from the Pope a dispensation of His former oaths (which
dispensation was the true cause of the wars and bloodshed since then) etc.
S.W.R. in his Preface.
Oath, the Popes dispensation, for which begun all the trouble, etc. Rather
then He would do it, He has paid already, a good while since, The King of
Spain has paid above an hundred Millions; and the lives of above four
hundred thousand Christians, for the loss of all those Countries; which for
beauty gave place to none; and for revenew, did equal His West Indies: for the
loss of a Nation, which most willingly obeyed Him; and who at this day after
forty years war, are in despite of all his forces, become free Estates, and
far more rich and powerful then they were, when He first begun to
impoverish and oppress them. Idem. Ibid.
above an hundred millions, and the lives of above four hundred thousand men;
And is still spending abundance of gold and blood. It is thus indeed with
worms of the earth, in whom there is no help, and whose breath is in their
nostrills; But it is otherwise with the King of Kings, who sits upon the
Circle of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as Grasshoppers, and the
Nations as the drop of a Bucket; who brings the Princes to Nothing, and
makes the Judges of the Earth as vanity. He is content to put up at our
hands, this indignity and affront, if I may so speak. He is glad to sue unto
us first, and send His Ambassadors day after day, beseeching us to be
reconciled unto Him. O incomprehensible Depth of unspeakeable mercy and
Encouragement to come in, and trust in his mercy, in case of spiritual misery,
able to trample under foot triumphantly, all Oppositions of the most raging
Hell, or distrustful heart!

5. Nay He commands us, And this is his Commandment, that we should believe
on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ; 1. Ioh. 3.23. This command alone of the
All-powerfull God, should infinitely outweigh, and prevail against all other
counter-maunds of Heaven, or Earth; flesh and blood, Satan, nature, reason,
sense; the whole Creation; all the World: It should swallow up all scruples,
doubts, fears, despaires. Coming to Jesus Christ with broken hearts,
according to this Commandment; It will bear us out against all oppositions,
accusations, weaknesses of faith in the evil times, in the hour of
temptation, upon our beds of death, at that last and greatest day. It will be a
plea at such times, utterly above all exception, against all allegations,
terrors, and temptations to the contrary, to say: I was humbled under the
burden of sin, and sense of my spiritual misery: God in mercy offered me
His Son Jesus Christ freely, in the Mystery of the Gospel, by the Ministry
of the Word: I thereupon thirsted infinitely for His Person, and precious
blood, that I might thereby obtain pardon and power against my sins: He
called upon me, and commanded me to drink my fill of the Water of life
freely: I accepted His gracious Offer, and according to His Commandment cast
my self upon the Lord Christ, against all the contradictions of carnal
reason, and Sophistry of Satan; and since that time, He has given me power
to serve Him in syncerity of heart. This is my ground and warrant, even the
Commandment of my blessed God; Thus to drink when I was thirsty: Against
which, the gates of Hell can never possibly prevail. In thy Case then, who
thirsts extremely, and upon free Offer, yet refusest to drink, consider how
unworthily thou dishonours God; and wrongs thine own Soul, by suffering the
Devils cavils, and the groundless exceptions of thine own distrustful heart,
to prevail with thee against the direct Command of Al-mighty God; Obey the
commandment, which commands thee to believe, against all unbelief, and above
all belief, and to hope above hope, that is, in infinite doubtings, to
believe; in all despaires to hope; and when all reasons, grounds, means, and
hopes are wanting, yet to believe only, because God commands thee so to do.
Tho nature, reason, sense, and thy own heart, and faithless fears, and all
creatures forbid thee so to do, saying, That thy strength and hope is perished
from the Lord: Lam. 3. Yet obey, and believe none of these, but Gods
Commandment, commanding thee to believe his promise against them all, and so
to honor Him as God, above them all in power, mercy, truth and faithfulness.
Throgmorton of Faith, page 194.
which thou ought to obey against all reason, sense, fears, doubts,
despaires, and Hellish suggestions. Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, did
readily, and willingly submit to Gods Commandment; even to kill His own only
dear Son with His own hand; naturally, matter of as great grief, as could
possibly pierce the heart of a mortal man: And will thou being
brokenhearted, stand off from believing, and refuse, when He commands Thee to
take His own only dear Son; especially since thou takes with Him, the
excellency and variety of all blessings both of Heaven and Earth; a Discharge
from every moment of the everlasting pains of Hell; Deeds sealed with His own
blood, of thy Right to the glorious Inheritance of the Saints in light. In a
word, even 1. Cor. 3 22.
all things, the most glorious Deity it self, blessed for ever, to be enjoyed
through Him, with unspeakeable and endless pleasure through all eternity?

insipient^us. Bern. de consid.
madness, cruelty to thine own Soul, or something at which Heaven and Earth,
Man and Angel, and all Creatures may stand amazed; That thou should so
wickedly, and wilfully, forsake thine own mercy, and neglect so great
salvation.

6. Lastly, lest He should let pass any means, or be any ways wanting on His
part to drive us to Christ, and settle our Souls upon Him with sure and
everlasting confidence, Dicitur, inquit, Deus etiam iurasse, hoc est,
iureiurando interminatus esse, non ingressuros esse in suam requiem. Quibusnam
vero? Non sane omnibus: sed solis illis contumacibus: Cogitate igitur, and
vobis iuratam hanc Dei interminationem incumbere, si non obediat is Deo, per
Evangelium vos hodie vocanti. Par. in Loc.
He also o threatens: And to whom swear He, that they should not enter into
His rest, but to them that believed not? Heb. 3.18. Wherein He expresses
extremest anger; unquenchable and implacable indignation: He swears in his
wrath, that no unbeleever shall ever enter into His rest. In the Threats of the
Moral Law, there is no such Oath, but a secret reservation of mercy, upon the
satisfaction of divine justice some other way. But herein the Lord is
peremptory, and a third way shall never be found, or afforded to the Sons of
Men. Neglect of such a gracious Offer, of so great salvation, must needs
provoke, and incense so great a God extraordinarily; For with prodigious
ingratitude and folly, it flings, as it were, Gods free grace in His face
again; and sins against His mercy. Suppose, a mighty Prince passing by all
the royal and noble blood in Christendom, many brave and honorable Ladies,
should send to a poor maid, bred in a base Cottage, borne both of beggarly
and wicked Parents; offer her marriage, and to make Her a Princess: and she
then should foolishly refuse, and reject so infinitely undeserved, and
unexpected advancement. As she might thereupon be justly branded for a
notorious Bedlam; so would not so great a Prince, think you, be mightily
enraged, at such a dunghill indignity, and peevish affront? The Prince of
peace, upon whos^ thigh is written King of King^, and Lord of Lords, The state
of Mankind is happy, in respect of the Angels which fell; for none of them
are, or shall over be restored to their former state.

-- As He, who falls from a steep and high Rock into a deep Pit or Gulf,
cannot possibly escape death; whereas one, whose fall is less, may have hope
of life: so it is with these wicked Angels, whose sin we may truly call that
unpardonable sin committed against ye holy Ghost. If it is objected, that the
Angels may repent, and so obtain salvation: We answer, First, that it is
impossible, by reason of the nature of their sin, being the sin against*
the Holy Ghost, that they should ever truly repent: and secondly, that if they
could after some sort ^epent, yet they are altogether incapable of salvation;
because God has not taken unto Himself the nature of Angels, as He has done
the nature of Man; and so joining it to Himself, who is life it self, made it
a living and holy nature. Morton, Of the threefold state of Man, cap. 1. Sect 3.


passing by more excellent and noble creatures, sends unto Thee; whose Father is
corruption, and the worm thy mother and thy sister; and who in respect of thy
spiritual state, lies polluted in thine own blood, etc. And offers to betroth
Hos. 2.19.
Thee unto Himself in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving
kindness, and in mercies: To Crown Thee with all the riches, both of His
kingdom of grace and glory, etc. Now, if thou should stand off, which God
forbid; as thereupon out of perfection of madness, thou forsakest thine own
salvation; so thou most justly enforcest that blessed Lord to swear in his
wrath, that thou shall never be saved.

Thus thou have heard, how; First, He keeps open house to all such hungry and
thirsty souls: Rev. 22.17. Secondly, He invites: Mat. 11.28. Thirdly, Invites
with an awakening and rouzing compellation: Isa. 55.1. Fourthly, Entreats: 2.
Cor. 5 20. Fifthly, Commands: 1. Ioh. 3.23. Sixthly, And threats: Heb. 3.18.
How cruel then i^ that Man to His own wounded conscience, who in his extreme
spiritual thirst, will not be drawn, by this sixfold merciful Cord, to
drink His fill of the Fountain of the water of life; to cast Himself with
confidence, and comfort, into the arms of the Lord Jesus? Which is more then
infinitely able to tie the most trembling heart, and that which hangs-off most,
by reason of pretended doubts, scruples and distrusts, to that blessed Savior
of His, with all full assurance and Isai. 6.^.
perfect peace. How is it possible, but that all, or some of these should bring
in every broken heart, to believe; and cause every one that is weary of his
sins, to rely upon the Lord of life for everlasting Welfare?

But that which I desire principally to press for my purpose, in the P^int at
this time, is this; Thy conscience is now awaked, terrifyed and troubled; and
therefore, as I suppose, tender and very sensible, at least, for a time of the
least sin. ^very sin lies now upon thy Soul as heavy, as a mountain of
lead; and therefore thou would not willingly add, unto thy already
insupportable burden, any more weight. All thy youthful lusts, and
abominations, stare in the face of thy conscience, with griesly and horrible
looks; and therefore, for the present, especially, thou art notably scared,
from a willing provocation of Gods anger, and wounding it afresh with any new
sin. Well, it being thus then; If it appear unto Thee, that by thy standing
off, in the Case, I have supposed thee, from taking Christ as thine own,
applying the promises, as most certainly belonging unto ^hee, and so putting
to thy seal, that God is true; Thou dishonours Him extraordinarily in many
respects: Me thinks then, thou should be mightily moved, without any
more ado, to cast thy self presently upon the Lord Jesus with comfort and
much assurance; Especially, since thy so yielding to the Law of faith, is for
thy infinite good: And assure thy Self, thou offendest, in the mean time,
many ways:

1. By a sour, and selfe-will'd unmanerlinesse toward Christ; in not coming,
when He calls theo; Mat. 11.28. It is pride, and high pride, says a worthy
Ward in His Life of Faith.
Divine, not to come when thou art called. It is rudeness, and not good
manners, not to do as thou art bidden to do; yea, so often and earnestly
charged to do. It would be a foul fault, and unmannerly disobedience for any
subject in this kingdom, tho never so ragged and tattered, or pretending never
so much His unfitness, and unfinenesse to press into so great a presence, not
to come unto the King, if He should please earnestly to call upon Him.
Disobedience to the Law of faith, and rejecting Gods gracious Offer of his
Son freely, is the greatest, and an inexpiable sin. He has sworn in his
wrath, that such a Refusant shall never enter into His rest.

2. By a saucy prescribing unto Him, upon what terms He shall take thee:
Isai. 55.1.
Ho, says He, every One that thirsts, come ye to the waters; and He that
has no money: Come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without
money, and without price. Nay, say Thou, I will either bring something in
mine hand, or I will none. Whereas it appears in the cited Place, that Christ
calls not only those that are thirsty; but also such as have no money.

3. By undervalewing the unvalewable worth of his precious blood. As tho thy
sins had exceeded the price, that has been paid for them. Whereas it is
called, Act, 20.28. Gods own blood. And therefore no want in it, to wash away
any sin, and for ever.

4. By offering disparagement to all the promises in Gods blessed Book; Every
one whereof does now sweetly, and upon good ground, invite thee, as it were, to
repose upon it, as upon a sure Word of God, with everlasting rest and safty.
But thou giving too much way to the Devils lies, and the dictates of thine own
distrustful heart, keeps off, and retires; as tho they were too weak, to
support thy now troubled, and trembling Soul, especially laden with so many,
and heinous sins. Whereby, consider how great indignity, thou offers to such
precious promises, and Places, as these: Isa. 1.18. Ezekiel. 36.25. Isa. 55.7.8.9.
And 57.15. Especially, being so strongly backed by Gods blessed Oath: God
willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise, the immutability of
His counsel, confirmed it by an Oath: That by two immutable things, in which
it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: Heb. 6.17.18. What a
mighty strength may that most glorious speech of our all-mercifull God, infuse
into our Faith; Ezekiel. 36.11. As I live, etc. As if He should have said: As
Vivo ego, dixit Dominus Ienova, etc.] Iurans per vitam suam, id est, Deitatis
suae aeternam essentiam, omnipotentiam, and divinam Maiestatem, ac naturam.

Understand the same proportionably of every promise: As sure as I have an

weary of all His sins; and Revel. 21.6.
thirsts unfainedly for mercy and grace, eternal rest, and refreshing in the
ever-springing Fountain of all spiritual, and heavenly pleasures. And so of
the rest.

In a word; what an unworthy thing is this; That all the precious promises in
the Book of God, confirmed with his own Beati sumus, quorum causa Deus jurat,
sed miseri and detestabiles; si ne iuranti quidem oredimus. Tertull.
Oath* and sealed with His Sons blood, should suffer dishonor and
disparagement, as it were, by thy distrust: As tho so many mighty Rocks of
mercy and truth, were not able to sustain a poor bruised Reed?

5. By disabling and dis-honouring:

1. Gods free love. See Hos. 14.4. Ier. 31.3. Ezech. 16. Deuteronomy. 7.7.8. Ioh.
3.16. Ephesians. 1.5*

If God would not give us Christ, without some matter and motives in us;
without something done by our selves first; it were something to stand out in
such a case: But he gives him most freely, without any respect, or expectation
at all of any precedent work, or worth on our part. Only there is required a
predisposition in the Party, to take Christ, legal dejection, sight, sense,
and burden of sin; we must be truly wounded, sensible of the Devils yoke,
feel our own misery; we must prize Him above, and See Luke 4.18.

man will not seriously seek after a Physician, before He feel Himself to
be sick; for ease, before He be pressed with the weight of His burden; for a
plaster, before He be wounded; for heavenly riches, before He be sensible
of His spiritual beggary; for enlargement and pardon, before He find
himself in prison; for mercy, before He smart with sense of His misery. Such
dispositions then as these serve only to drive us unto Christ, and to let us
see and feel a necessity of Him; But they are infinitely, with more then an
utter impossibility disabled, by any worthiness, to draw on Christ. He is a
Gift; Romans 5.16. Ioh. 3.16. And what is freer then Gift? Nothing is required at
our hands, for receiving Him; but emptie-handednesse, and sensiblenesse of our
own nothingnesse. Our Heavenly Father never did, or ever will fell His Son
unto any Iustitiarie; or any, that will needs be something in Himself: He
ever did, and ever will give Him to every poor Soul, thas is vile in His own
eyes, nothing in himself; labors, and is heavy laden, and willing to take Him
as a Savior, and a Lord. A full hand can hold nothing; Either it must be
empty, or we cannot receive Christ. First thirst, and then buy, without money,
and without price. Isa. 55.1.

Me thinks Sive meo volueris expol^ri ornatu, sive armis meis armari, (...)

Quid huic liberalitati aequale unquam inveniri potest? In cap. Matthew. 24.
Homil. 77.
Chrysostom does somewhere set out sweetly, the admirable, and adored
frankenesse of this divine bounty:

b If thou will be adorned with my comeliness, or be armed with my weapons, or
put on my garments, or be fed with my dainties, or finish my journey, or come
into that City, whose Builder and Maker I am, or build an House in my Country:
Thou may so do all these things; that I will not only not exact of thee any
price, or payment for any of these things; but I my self would be a Debtour
unto thee of a great Reward, so that thou would not disdain to use my
things, my strength, gifts, graces. What can be ever found equal to this
bounty?

If God then be so infinitely good, as to offer His Son so freely; And thou
so fitted to receive Him; by sensiblenesse of thy spiritual misery, thirsting
for his blood, resolving upon His service for the time to come, etc. How
unad-visedly cruel art thou to thine own conscience, and unmannerlily proud,
that wilt needs stand off still from taking the Lord Jesus; and suffer still
thy poor trembling Soul to lie unnecessarily upon the Rack of terror? Since
thou gets and gains nothing thereby; but, first, Gods dishonor: secondly,

Answ. Thou must first be alive, before thou can As for thy doings, thou
must have that power from God after thy Believing: Therefore Believe first, and
thou shall do after. Rogers Dedham, Doctrine of Faith, page 150. -- They may
not, for any thing they see in themselves, put these promises from them: But
rather in admiration of Gods wonderful goodness, mercy, and compassion upon
such unworthy wretches, to give glory unto God, in Believing and accepting this

we are resolved to live and die; draws from Him into our souls that heavenly
virtue and vigor, whereby we are afterward enabled to exercise all the
functions of spiritual life, and to die to the world, and all wordly pleasures
for ever. Herein is thy fault and failing, thou conceives not a right of Gods
free grace; but thinks thou shall not be welcome, except thou come with thy
Many despair of help, because of their own unworthiness; as tho there were
no hope of Gods mercy, except we bring in our gift, and pawn in our hands to
Him: But this were to discredit the Lords mercies, and to bring into credit our
merits; and rather to bind the Lord unto us, then us unto Him: But if our
sins be great, our redemption is greater; Tho our merits be beggarly, Gods
mercy is a rich mercy, etc. Greenham in his Grave Counsels, page 9.

and buy without money, and without price.

Object. 2. But will it not be presumption in me, having no good thing in me
at all, to bring with me; but coming now, as it were, fresh out of Hell, from
a most wicked, impure, abominable life, to take Christ as mine own; and all
those rich and precious promises sealed with his blood?

Answ. Enough has been already said, to meet with this objection. It is not
presumption, but good manners to come, when thou art called. How can He be
said to presume, who is both invited and entreated; commanded and threatened to
come in, etc. Of which see before. Thou must now in this extreme spiritual
thirst of thine, drink of the water of life, so freely offered, that thou
may receive some heavenly strength to be good, and Ioh. 1.12.
power to become the Son of God. Thou must throw thy sinful Soul upon Jesus
Christ, bleeding and breathing out his last upon the Cross; as the Body of the
Shunamites Child was applied to the Prophet stretching himself upon it; That
thou may thereby be quickened with desired fruitfulness, filled by little
and little with all the fullness of God; Ephesians. 3.19. Ioh. 1.16. and 11.25.
receiving grace for grace: I am the resurrection, and the life, says Christ:

sinning, can never stand together. Perkins, Grain of Muster-seed, Conclu. 6.
purposes to go on in the willing practice, or allowance of any one known
sin, to believe that Christ is His righteousness and sanctification. But
where all sin is a Burden, every promise as a world of gold, and the heart
sincere for a new way; there a Man may be bold. For thee to have pretended part
in Christ, wallowing yet in thy sins, had been horrible presumption indeed:
and for me to have applied the Promises, and preached peace unto thy
remorselesse conscience, before the Pangs of the New Birth had seized upon
thee, had been damnable dawbing: But in the Case I now suppose Thee to be; it
is both seasonable, and surely grounded; for me to assure thee of acceptance
and pardon: and for thee to receive Jesus Christ without any more ado, into
the arms of thy humbled Soul.

2. His sweet Name: Exodus 34.6.7. Wherein is prevented, whatsoever may any
ways be pretended for standing out in this Case: as appears fully before,
page 415. line 25.

3. His glorious Attributes.

1. His Truth. He that believes, has set to His Seal, that God is true:
Ioh. 3.33. He that labors, and is heavy laden with the burden of sin, comes to
Christ for case, when He is called; takes Him for his Savior, and His Lord;
and thereupon grounds a resolute, unshaken and everlasting confidence, that he
is His for ever; puts to his Seal, that Christ is true; that His precious
promise, Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest; Mat. 11.28. is inviolable. Whereby Christ Jesus, blessed for
ever, is Si tum pendeat ex nudo quast Dei verbo and promissione, sane quam
potest maxim Deum honorat; id quod ^ecisse Abrahamum legimus, qui contra spem
subspe credidit, Deum, quod promiserat, potuisse etiam sacere, ac
proindegloriam Deo tribuisse dicitur. -- Voluit hominem ex sensu
imperfectionis, ins^mitatis ac miseriae suae, perpetuo, per fidem Christi,
confugere ad gratuitas ili. ^^ promissiones in Christo Jesus, and ab illis
prorsus pendere; ea quippe re existimavit sese quam maxim glori^icari. --
I^llitiailla Christi aeterna nobis imputata, mayor est iustitia hominem and
Angelorum omnium: and vita, quae est ex ilia n^stitia, mayor est vita c^, quae
fuisset ex institia operum, si fing as Adamum perstitisse in illo statu
innocentiae, in quo tumprimum creatus est. Rolloc. in Johan. cap. 3.
mightily honored His truth glorified, and thine own soul with
extraordinary, blessedness everlastingly enlived. But He now that retires in
this Case, and holds off, makes Him, who is Truth it self, a liar: He that
believes not God, has made Him a Liar: 1. Ioh. 5.10.

Now what a fearful indignity is this against the Lord God of Truth? We see
too often how miserable mortal men, worms of the earth, take such an affront
at the hands one of another: For many times, for the Lie given them, they throw
themselves desperately upon the irrecoverable ruin of their lives, states,
souls and posterity, by chalenging the field, and killing each other. Which
Impios extremae blasphemiae reos facit, quia Deum mendacij arguunt. Certe Deo
nihil pretiosius est, quam sua veritas: quare nulla illi atrocior iniuria fieri
potest, quam dum hoc honor spoliatur. Ergo ut nos ad credendum incitet,
argumentum a contrario sumit. Nam si Deum facere mendacem horribilis est, and
execranda impietas, quia tunc quod illi maxim proprium est, eripitur: quis non
horreat fidem Evangelio derogare, in quo Deus unice verax and fidelis vult
haberi? -- Mirantur aliqui, cur tantopere Deus fidem commendet, cur tam severe
damnetur incredulitas. Atqui hic vertitur summa Dei gloria. Nam cum praecipuum
veritatis suae specimen in Evangelio edere voluerit, nihil illi faciunt
reliquum, quicunque oblatum illic Christum respuunt. Calv. in loc. Insigniter
Deum iniurijs and contumelijs afficiunt, qui de verbis eius dubitant, and
credere morantur. -- Magnus Dei cultus, fides: magna in Deum blasphemia,
incredulitas. Naogeor. Ibid.
dishonor to the mighty Lord of heaven and earth, is the greater, and is much
aggravated by the infinite infallibility of the promises. For besides His Word,
which were more then immeasurably sufficient, He has added a most solemn
Oath for our sakes, that we might have greater assurance, and stronger
consolation.

2. His Mercy, most directly and specially. And to say nothing of the freeness
of His mercy; which springs only out of the riches of his infinite bounty, and
the good pleasure of His will: of his readiness to forgive; otherwise the
death of Christ should be of none effect, His blood shed in vain; the
greatest work lost, that ever was done: of His delight in mercy: Mich. 7.18.
Mercy in man is a quality, in God it is His Deus est misericors sua aeterna and
simplici essentia, non autem qualitate aliqua, non affectu, non passione.
Polan. Syntag. Theol lib. 2. cap. 23. Quia Deus naturaliter diligit clementiam,
ideo tam facilis est ad ignoscendum peccatoribus. Calv. in Michaeam, cap. 7.
nature and essence. Now what we do naturally, we do willingly, readily,
unweariedly: As the eye is not weary of seeing, the ear with hearing, etc.
Misericordia Dei melli, iustitia vero aculeo comparatur. Bern.
A Be gives honey naturally, never stings, but provoked: When God is angry, it
is but, as it were, by accident, upon occasion; drawn unto it by the violent
importunity of our multiplied provocations; but He delights in mercy, etc. I
say, to say nothing of these; this one consideration may convince us of extreme
folly, in refusing mercy in such a Case, for all the heinousness, or number of
our sins: to wit, That no sins, either for number, or notoriousnesse, in a
truly broken heart, can make so much resistance to Gods infinite mercies, as
the least Cogita scintillam, si in mare ceciderit, non poterit stare, aut
apparere. Quantum scintilla ad mare se habet, tantum hominis malitia ad Dei
clementiam pictatemque; imo vero non tantum modo, sed and lone supra. Nam and
pelagus, tamet si magnum sit, mensuram recipit: Dei vero clementia and pictas
mensuram non habet. Haec dicam, non quo vos desidiores, sed promptiores reddam.
Chrysostom. Tom. 5. De Poenit.
spark of fire, to the whole Sea, and that is little enough. Nay, as
infinitely less, as an infinite thing exceedes a finite. Between which there
is no proportion.

3. His Power. For thou art very like thus, or in the like manner, to reason
within thy self, and cavil cruelly against thine own Soul: Alas! what talk
you of taking Christ, the promises of life, and heavenly lightsomnesse; my
poor heart is as dark as the very middle of Hell; much harder then a Rock of
Adamant; as cold and dead, as the senseless Center of the earth; as
uncomfortable and restless, almost, as desperation it self, etc. It is more
then infinitely impossible, that such a dark, hard, dead, comfortless Thing
should ever be enlightened, softened, quickened, and established with joy, etc.

But mark how herein, thou unadvisedly undervalewes, and unworthily sets
bounds to the Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem. Vide quam cito dicitur, and
quantum valet. Deus est, and Pater est: Deus potestate, Pater bonitate. Quam
felices samus, qui Dominum nostrum Patrem invenimus. Credamus ergo in cum, and
omnia nobis de ipsius ^^sericordia promittamus. Quia o^nipotens est, ideo in
Deum Patrem omnipotentem credimus. Nemo dicat, non potest mihi dimittere
pe^^ata. Quomodo non potest omnipotens? Sed dicis, ego multum peccavi, Et ego
dico, sed ille om^ipotens est. Et tu, Ego ta^a peccata com nisi, unde liberari
and mundari non pussum. Respo^^ieo, sed ille omnis ote^^ est. -- Ad hec nobis
est erus omnipotentia necessaria. August. De temp. Scrip. 119.
unlimited power of God. Whereas thou should imitate Abraham, the Father of
all them that believe, who staggered not at the Promise of God through
unbelief: but was strong in faith, giving glory to God: And being fully
persuaded, that what He had promised, He was able also to perform: Romans
4.20.21.

Be advised in this Case:

1. To compare these two things together: The making of the seven Stars, and
Orion, and turning the shadow of death into the morning; And the infusion of
heavenly light into thy dark and heavy heart: And do thou not think, that
the second is as easy as the first, to the same Omnipotent hand? Nay, it is
easier in our conceit (to the Divine Majesty nothing is difficult or un-easie);
For those glorious shining Constellations were created of nothing; and nothing
has no disposition to any Being at all, much less to any particular
existence; But a Soul sensible and weary of it is spiritual darkness, is in
the nearest, and most immediate passive disposition, if I may so speak, to
receive the whole Sun of righteousness. Reach but out thy hand in this Case
to Jesus Christ, offering Himself freely unto Thee, as a Savior and Lord; and
thou shall presently take possession of the Kingdom of Grace, and undoubted
Right to the everlasting Kingdom of Glory. The Prophet Amos 5.8. presses this
Argument of power for some such purpose. And it may serve excellently against
all pretenses and counter-pleaes for a supposed impossibility of being
illightened, and refreshed in the depth of spiritual darkness and distress.
It may be, Thou may say unto Me, You advise me indeed to seek Gods face
and favor, etc. But alas! Mine is not an ordinary heart, it is so full of
guilty sadness, and horror for sin, that I have little hope, etc. Yea, but
consider, He that I counsel Thee to seek, made the seven Stars and Orion,
and turns the shadow of death into the Morning: and will do fargreater
wonders for thy Soul, if thou will believe the Prophets, that thou may
prosper. If thou will trust in Him, He will quickly turn the tumultuous
roarings of thy conscience into perfect peace. Thou will keep Him in perfect
peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because He trusts in Thee: Isai. 26.

3. The Prophet therefore, to prevent all scruples and exceptions in this
kind, calls upon them thus: Seek him that makes the seven Stars, and
Orion, etc.

2. Secondly, lay these two together: To bring honey out of the Rock, and oil
out of the flinty Rock; Deuteronomy. 32.13. And to mollify thine heart, even to
thine own hearts desire; in which there is already some softness, else thou
could not sensibly and syncorely complain of it is hardness. And thou must
needs acknowledge, that they are both equally easy to the same Almighty arm.

3. Thirdly, thou may well consider, that it is a far greater work to make
Heaven and Earth; then to put spiritual life and lightsomnesse into thy truly
humbled, and thirsty Soul, to which so many precious Promises are made. And
He, with whom Thou have to do, and from whom thou expectest help, is He,
that made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that therein is: which keeps
truth for ever. Which opens the eyes of the blind, -- and raises them that
are bowed down: Psalm. 146.6. Which heal^th the broken in heart: and binds up
their wounds. -- Who takes pleasure in them that fear Him: in those, that
hope in His mercy: Psalm. 147.3.11.

4. In such an extremity of helpe-lesnesse, and hope-lesnesse; In this
trembling and terror of thy heart, thou should call to mind for thy
comfort; That He who establishes all the Ends of the Earth, Prove. 30 4. and
has hung that mighty and massy Body upon Nothing, Job 26.7 can most easily
stay, and stablish the most forlorn and forsaken Soul, even sinking into the
mouth of despair. He that said at first to the Earth, Stand still upon
Nothing and it never stirred out of it is place since the Creation, can easily
uphold, fortify, and refresh thine heart in the depth of the most grievous
spiritual misery. Even, when in the bitterness of thy spirit, thou cries; My
strength, and my hope is perished from the Lord: Lament. 3.18.

4. Even his Justice. Christ's blood is already paid, as a price, for the
pardon of the sins of thine humbled Soul; and thou will needs pay it over
again, or else thou will not enter upon the Purchase: As tho God did expect
and exact the discharge of the same debt twice; which to imagine, were a
monstrous intolerable indignity to the most just God. You know full well, what
conceit we should hold of that Man, who having a debt fully discharged by the
Surety, should press upon the Principal for the payment of the same again.
We should indeed think HIm to be a very cruel, hard-hearted, and merciless
Man: we should call Him a Turk, a Cut-throate, a Canniball; far fitter to
lodge in a Den of Tigers, then to live in the society of men. What a fearful
dishonor then is i^ to the merciful, and mighty Lord of Heaven and Earth; To
the righteous Judge of all the World, to conceive, that having received an
exact, Quemadmodum igitur si quis in car^eris cus^odiam (...) nammos ob

and full satisfaction for all our sins, by the hearts-blood of His own
dear Son, should ever require them again at our hands! Far be it then
from every One, who would not offer extraordinary disparagement, even to Gods
glorious Justice, to entertain any such thought: Especially, s^th we have His
Word, His Oath, and the Seal of His Sons blood for security. And assuredly,
we may build upon it, as upon a Rock of eternal truth; that when we come
unto Christ, weary of all our sins, thirsting syncerely for Him, and throwing
our selves upon Him, as Salvation it self; resolved to take upon us His sweet
and easy yoke for the time to come; He does presently, as He has promised,
take off the burden, and free us everlastingly, from the guilt and stain;
damnation and reign of all our sins.

But now, if thou will cast thy self upon Jesus Christ, role thy self upon the
Promises, being so humbled, spiritually thirsty, and resolved, as thou have
said, and I supposed at the first: For we, who are Gods Messengers, comfort
and assure of pardon in such Cases, only upon supposition, that the heart and
speeches; all the Promises and protestations of the Party and Patient, we deal
with, be sincere every way; I say, if thou thus cast thy self upon the Lord
Jesus, and the promises of life, having a well-grounded, strong and seasonable
calling thereunto, being, as appears before, invited, entreated, commanded,
etc. The Case will be blessedly altered. Thou shall then do, as God would have
Thee; and mightily honor the un-valew-able, and Concedimus satisfactionis
dignitatemori^i a Persona satisfaciente: ideo ^ue satisfactionem Christi
maximae, imo infinitae dignitatis esse. Idem. Ibid. pa. 245.
infinite dignity of His Sons Passion, and blood, the precious freeness of
all the Promises, His free love, sweet Name, Truth, Mercy, Power, Justice, etc.
Thou shall also cut off, and defeat the Devils present fiery darts, and
Projects of further cruelty; dis-intangle and unwinde thy self out of the
irksome Maze of restless terrors, and trouble of mind; crown thine own
soul in the mean time with peace that passes all understanding, Philip. 4.7.
1. Pet. 1.8.
with joy unspeakeable, and full of glory; with Evangelicall pleasures, such as
neither eye has seen, ear heard, or have entered into the heart of Man; 1.
Cor. 2.9.
and hereafter be most certainly received by that sweetest Redeemer of thine,
into those glorious Mansions above; where nothing, but light and blessed
immortality, no shadow for matter of tears, discontentments, griefs, and
uncomfortable passions to work upon; but all joy, tranquillity and peace, even
for ever and ever, does dwell.

2. Yea, but may an other say, I, in the Case proposed have cast my self
according to your counsel, upon Jesus Christ; and there, by the mercy of God,
am I resolved to stick, come what come will; and yet no comfort comes: What
do you think, should I think of my self, in this Case?

I think in such a Case, it may be convenient, and that such an One has
thereupon some cause and Calling, seriously and impartially, to search and try
His spiritual state. For which purpose ponder seriously upon such
considerations as these: some of which may discover unsoundnesse; Others His
unadvisednesse.

1. It may be, the Party is not yet come in truth, to that sound humiliation,
contrition, spiritual thirsting, resolution to sell all, etc. required by the
reverend Master Rogers of Dedham.
Author in that most profitable, and piercing Doctrine of Faith, quoted before:
but only has passed over them overly, not soundly; superficially, not
syncerely; and then no marvel, tho no true and real comfort come. Inform thy
self further in this Point, and that thou may more fully know my meaning in
it, and be guided aright in a marter of so great weight, Ibid. Cap. 2. Of the
Author and means of Faith. And Cap. 5. Of the difficulty of Faith, page 284,
etc.

2. Or it may be, howsoever He protest otherwise, and for all His partial
Legal terror, and trouble of mind, His deceitful heart may still secretly
harbor and hanker after some sweet sin, as Pride, Revenge, strange Fashions,
Worldliness, Lust, Plays, Gaming, Good-fellowship, as it is called, etc. From
which, it does not heartily yield, resolve, and endeavor to make an utter and
Sed videte qualis debet esse poenitentia, quia multi assid^e se du^nt esse
peccatores, and tamen adhuc illos delectat peccare. Professio est, non

Temp. Sermon. 7.
final cessation and divorce. And assuredly, that false heart, which regards,
and allows any wickedness in it self, howsoever it may be deluded with some
Anabaptisticall flashes; yet shall never be truly refreshed with joy in the
holy Ghost.

3. It may be, tho there was some probable and plausible shows, that the
Party was principally cast down, and affected with the heavy weight of sin,
and horror of Gods wrath for it; yet the true predominant cause of His
heaviness, harts-griefe, and bitterest complaint, was some secret earthly
coffeehouse, the restless biting of some worldly sting. And in such Cases,
remove this, and you remove His pain; Comfort Him about his Cross, and you
set Him where He was. And therefore, as in all this He continues a mere
stranger in affection to the sweetness, amiablenesse, and excellency of Jesus
Christ; so it is impossible, that He should be acquainted with any sound
spiritual comfort.

But I will suppose all to be sincere, and as it should be: Let me advise
Thee then to take notice of thine unadvisednesse.

1. Thou art, perhaps, so full of the want of feeling, such a stranger to so
much expected, and desired joy, and peace in believing; and by consequent, so
drowned in the unnecessary distractions, and distempers of a sad heart, that
thou utterly forgets to give thanks, and magnify Gods singular, and
incomprehensible mercy, for illightening, convincing, and terrifying thy
conscience; offering his Son; raising in thine heart an insatiable thirst
after Him; and giving Thee spiritual ability to rest thy weary Soul upon
Him. And who knows not, that unthankfulness keeps many good things from us;
and is an unhappy block in the way, to intercept, and hinder the comfortable
influence, and current of God, favors and mercies, from being showred down so
frankly and plentifully upon His people. And He is more likely to be the more
provoked in this Case; because thou suffers thine heart to be locked up, and
thy Tongue tied, by Satan's cunning and cruel malice, from praising the glory
of Gods free grace, for such a work of wonder: I mean, that mighty Change of
thine from nature to grace; in extolling of which, were all the hearts and
tongues, of all the Men and Angels in Heaven and Earth, set on work
industriously through all eternity, they would still come infinitely short, of
that which is due and deserved.

2. Or it may be, when some One of a thousand, upon thy complaint, that no
comfort comes, does seriously labor to settle thine heart in peace; pressing
upon Thee for that purpose, invincible and unanswer-able Arguments out of the
Word of Truth; to open it wide, that overflowing Rivers of Evangelicall joys,
which may spring to Him that is advised, and believes the Prophets, abundantly,
even from the weakest Faith, to refresh and comfort it: Telling thee, that as
thine humbled Soul, learning upon Christ, draws much heavenly virtue,
mortifying power, and sanctifying grace from him; so it may, and ought also to
draw abundance of spiritual lightsomnesse from that ever-springing Fountain
of life, etc. Yet notwithstanding all this, thou suffers some malicious
counter-blasts, and contrary suggestions of the Devil, to disperse and
frustrate all these well-grounded and glorious Messages. And therefore it is
just with God, that thou fare the worse at his hands, and fall short of thine
expectation; because thou gives more credit to the Father of Lies, then the
Lord of Truth. Since thou spills all the Cordials, that are tendered unto thee
in the Name of Christ by His faithful Physicions, thou art deservedly
destitute of comfort still. Many in such Cases, while Gods Messenger, who can
rightly declare His ways unto them, stands by, opening, and applying the rich
treasures of Gods free mercy, in the mystery of the Gospel, and with present
replies, repelling Satan's cavils, are reasonably well cheared, and revived; But
when He is gone, they very weakly, and unworthily give way again to that
foul lying Fiend, to cast a dis-comfortable mist over the tender eye of their
weak Faith, and to domineere as He did before.

Tell me true; If thou were in doubt and distress about thy temporal state,
Tenure of thy Lands, soundness of thy evidence; Would thou advise with, and
take counsel from a Fool, a Knave, and an enemy; or would Thou make choice
of an honest, wise, understanding Friend? I doubt not of thine Answer: And will thou then so far disparage divne truth, gratify Hell, and hurt thine own
heart, as in that waightiest Point of thy spiritual state; to consult and
resolve with the Devil, a Liar, a Murderer, and sworn enemy to Gods glory,
and thy Souls good; And neglect God Himself, blessed for ever, speaking unto
Thee out of His Word, by that Minister, which in such a Case durst not falsify,
or flatter Thee for a World of gold. Shall many thousands of worldly-wise men,
give credit very readily, and roundly, to Dawbers with untempered mortar, upon
a false and rotten foundation, to the most certain, and eternal ruin of
their Souls; And shall not an humble, and upright-hearted Man, believe the
Prophet upon good ground; that the bones, which the heavy burden of sin has
broken, may rejoice? God forbid.

3. Nay, but suppose the Party be truly humbled, very thankful, resolute
against all sin, labor to believe the Prophets, etc. And yet no comfort
come? I say then, there is an other Duty expected at thy hands, right precious
and pleasing unto God: And that is waiting. By which God would,

1. Set yet a sharper edge and eagerness more hungring and thirsting, greater
longing, and panting after the ravishing sweetness of His comfortable
presence; with which melting, earnest, crying dispositions, He is very much
delighted;

2. Cause us with peace and patience to submit unto, and depend upon His
merciful wisdom, in disposing and appointing times and seasons for our
deliverances and refreshings. For He well knows, that very Point and Period
of time: first, when His mercy shall be most magnifyed: secondly, His
childrens hearts most seasonably comforted, and kindlily enlarged, to pour out
themselves in praisefulnesse: thirdly, His, and our spiritual enemies most
gloriously confounded:

3. Quicken, and set on work with extraordinary fervency, the spirit of
prayer; fright us further from sin for the time to come; fit us for a more
fruitful improovement, of all Offers and opportunities to do our Souls good;
to make more of joy and peace in believing, when we enjoy it; And to declare to
others in like extremity, Gods dealing with us, for their support, etc.

We must learn then, to expect, and be content with Gods season: And hold up
our hearts in the mean time with such considerations, as these; first, we
perform a very acceptable service, and a Christian Duty, right pleasing unto,
and much prevailing with God, by waiting, See Isa. 40.31. and 64.4. And 49.23.
Lam, 3.25. Secondly, By our patient dependence upon God in this kind, we may
mightily increase, and multiply our comfort, when His time is come. For He is
wont to recompense abundantly, at last, His longer tarrying with excess of
joy, and overflowing expressions of His love. Thirdly, we must ever remember;
that all the while He exercises us with waiting, that season is not yet come,
which in His merciful wisdom, He holds the meetest to magnify the glory of
His mercy most, and wiseliest to advance our spiritual good. Fourthly, And
that which is best of all, If the true Convert, resting His weary Soul upon
the Lord Jesus, and Promises of life, should be taken away, before He attain
His desired comfort; He shall be certainly saved, and undoubtedly crowned
with everlasting blessedness. For, Blessed are all they that wait for Him:
Isa. 30.18. A Man is saved by Believing; and not by joy and peace in Believing:
Salvation is an inseparable companion of Faith: But joy and peace accompany it,
as a separable accident: As that which may be remooved from it; yea, there is
cause why it should be remooved. The light would never be so acceptable, were
it not for that usual intercourse of darkness, etc.

Take here notice upon this occasion; That as a truly humbled Soul receiving
Christ, in the sense I have said, has power given Him thereby to become the
Son of God; so He does draw also from that glorious object of Faith, so full
of all amiablenesse, excellency, and sweetness.

1. Sometimes, by the mercy of God, a very sensible, stirring, and ravishing
joy, unspeakeable, and full of glory: which, tho it be many times very short,
yet is unutterably sweet.

2. If not so, yet an habitual calmness of conscience, if I may so call it.
Which, tho we do not mark it so much, or magnify Gods mercy for it, as we
ought; yet it makes us differ as far by a comfortable freedom from many
slavish, guilty twitches, and an universal contentedness in all our courses,
and Passages through this vale of tears, from the worlds dearest Minion, and
most admired Favorite, as Quantu^ inter tranquillissimu^ interest portum, and
mare tempestuosum atque incommodum. Chrysostom.
the highest region of the Air, from the restless and raging Sea. Especially,
if that unhappily happy wretch, have a waking conscience.

3. Or at least, ever a secret heavenly vigor, whereby the Soul is savingly
supported in what state soever; though it be under the continued pressures of
most hideous temptations. The tyth of the terror whereof, would make many a
wordling make away Himself, because He wants this stay. And suppose they
should last unto the last gasp, even unto thine ending hour* Nay entrance
into Heaven; Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of
His servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? Let Him trust in
the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God: Isai. 50.10 Here it appears, that
one which truly fears God, may walk in darkness, and have no light of
comfort: And that such an One may be certainly saved, by staying upon ^is
God. By leaning upon Him, as One leanes upon a sta^fe. (...) niti, inniti,
incumbere, (...) Incumbebat hastae suae, nitebatur super hastam suam. 2 Samuel
1.6. B^xtor.
yet notwithstanding* thy spiritual state is not thereby prejudiced, but thy
salvation is still most sure; and thy first taste of those eternal joys
shall be the sweeter, by how much thy former temptations, and trials have been
the sorer. For we must ever hold fast this blessed Truth; Those that are
afflicted in conference, because they want assu^rance of salvation, have no
cause of despair, or of discouragement, as long as with an heavy laden soul,
hungring for mercy, they trust in Christ; and cast themselves wholly upon His
merits for salvation, according to the Gospel. For the condition of the
Gospel, required of sinners to salvation, is not a comfort, but a Duty; not an
assurance that they are saved, but a trust in Christ, that they shall be saved.
So that, as long as they rest on Christ's merits, seek to no other means, but
with such an heart, as has been said, to seek to Christ for salvation; as
soon as they have believed in Christ, they are justified sinners, tho they do
not presently feel by the witness of the Spirit, a full assurance that they
are saved. Chibald, in his Trial of Faith, lib. 2. cap. 4. page 185: Wherefore
comfort yourselves, O ye, that are tenderhearted, and troubled-minded
Christians, because you feel not the assurance of your salvation; in as much
as the condition of the Gospel is not; That He that believes in Christ, shall
be assured of salvation, but that He shall be saved: so that though thou
never have in thine own Soul a feeling of assured persuasion, that thou art
saved; yet as long, as with a heart mourning after Christ, and gasping for Him,
as the barren Land for water; thou casts thy self upon Him, and hangs on Him
still for salvation, with trust unto the merits of His death and obedience,
thou shall in the end and event, certainly be saved. Idem. Ibid. page 187.

There be that do truly believe in Christ, and that to salvation, if they
should then die, that yet are not come to be persuaded, that Christ is theirs,
etc. Rogers of Dedham in His Epistle to the Reader, page penult.


That we are justified, by casting our selves upon Christ, not by comfort; by
Faith, not by feeling; by trusting the sure Word of God, not by assurance.

But I desire to come yet nearer to thy Conscience, and to press comfort upon
thee with such strong, and unresistable Arguments, which all the subtilety of
the infernal powers, will never be able to dissolve.

Thou say, and I suppose so; That thou art weary of all thy sins, hungers
and thirsts after the righteousness of Christ; prizes Him before all the
world; have cast thy self upon His Truth, and tender-heartednesse for
everlasting safty; And yet Thou feels no special sensible joy in thine heart
thereupon. Be it so: yet upon this occasion, Take my counsel, and at my
request, address thy Self again, and have recourse afresh unto the Promises,
Settle thy Soul upon them seriously, with fixed meditation, and fervent
prayer: Set thy self purposely with earnestness and industry, to suck from
them, their heavenly sweetness. And then, how is it possible, that thine
Exultemus in Domino, gaudeamus cum fletu; Memores simus dignationis divinae and
captivitatis nostrae. August. de temp. Sermon. 3.
humble upright heart, should make resistance to those mighty torrents of
spiritual joys and refreshings; which by a natural, and necessary
consequence, spring abundantly from the ensuing comfortable Conclusions
grounded upon the sure Word of God, and thine own inward sense, and most
certain un-deniable experience?

Whosoever hungers and thirsts after righteousness, is blessed from Christ's
own mouth: Mat. 5.6. And this blessedness compriseth an absolute, and
universal confluence of all excellencies, perfections, pleasures, and
felicities in this World, and in the World to come; begun in some measure in
the Kingdom of Grace, and made complete in the Kingdom of Glory, through all
eternity.

But I, may thou say, out of evident feeling, and experience, find my self
to hunger and thirst after righteousness:

Therefore I am most certainly blessed, and inter-essed in all the rich
purchases of Christ's dearest blood and merit, which is the full price of the
Kingdom of Heaven, and all the glory thereof, etc.

Whosoever is See the Properties of a saving Thirst be^^^e. pa. 377. lin. 31,
etc.
athirst, has his Part in the Fountain of the water of life; Rev. 21.6. and
22.17. Ioh. 7.37. Isa. 55.1.

But I, may thou say, cannot deny, dare not belie my self, but that my poor
heart thirsts unfainedly, to be bathed in the heavenly streams of Gods free
favor, and Christ's sovereign blood:

Therefore undoubtedly, I have my part in the Well of life everlastingly.
Whence, what delicious streams of dearest In desiderio illo pij animi suspiria
inenar^abilia and gaudium ineffabile mirisi^e coadunantur, suspiria inquam, and
gaudium, quae ne ipse quidem, qui ea sentit, potest plene enarrare. Rolloc. in
Johan. cap. 8. page 556.
joy do sweetly flow?

Whosoever labors, and is heavy laden, may justly challenge at the hands of
Christ, rest and refreshing: Mat. 11.28.

But I feel all my sins, an intolerable burden upon my wounded Soul; and
most willingly take Him as a Savior, and a Lord:

Therefore I have my portion in His spiritual, and eternal rest.

The High and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose Name is Holy, and who
dwells in the High and holy Place; dwells also in every humble and contrite
spirit, as in a royal Throne; (He has as it were two Thrones; One in the
Empyrean Heaven, the other in a broken heart): Isa. 57.15.

But my heart lies grovelling in the dust, humbled under the mighty hand of God,
and trembling at his feet, etc.

Therefore it is the mansion of Iehova, blessed for ever.

Whosoever confesses and forsakes his sins, shall have mercy, Prove. 28.13.

But I confess, and abominate all sin; resolved never to turn again to
folly:

Therefore mercy is most certainly mine.

He in whose heart the holy Ghost has enkindled a kindly heat of affection
to the Brethren, has passed from death to life: 1. Ioh. 3.14.

But by the mercy of God, 1. Pet. 2.17.
my heart is wholly set upon the Brotherhood, which I heartily hated
heretofore:

Therefore I have passed from death to life.

These, and the like Conclusions, are in themselves as full of sound joy, and
true comfort; as the Sun of light or Sea of waters. Open but the eye of thine
humbled soul, and thou may see many glorious things in them. Crush them but
a little with the hand of Faith, and much delicious sweetness of spiritual
peace may distill upon thy Soul.

Lastly, such considerations as these, may contribute some matter of comfort,
and support, to Him of weakest apprehension, in this Case:

1. If He consult with His own Conscience, He shall happily find in His
present sincere resolution, an impossibility to turn back again to His
former sinful life, pleasures, goodfellow-ship, sensual courses, company:
He says, and thinks it, that He will rather die, then lie, swear, profane
the Sabbaths; put to usury, do wrong, keep any ill-gotten goods in his hands,
Haunt Alehouses, Play Houses, Gaming-houses; or willingly put His heart, or
hand to any kind of iniquity, as He was formerly wont. And does nature, think
you keep Him back; or grace, and Gods Spirit?

2. If He should now hear, and have his ears filled with oaths,
blasphemies, ribald talk, rotten speeches, filthy songs, railing at Gods
people, scoffing at religion, jesting out of Scriptures, etc. His heart would
rise; He would either reproove them, or be rid of them, as soon as He
could; whereas heretofore, He has been, perhaps, a delightful Hearer of
them, if not a notorious Actour Himself. And whence do you think does this
arise, but from the seed of God remaining in Him?

3. Thirdly, If when you hear Him complain; That howsoever He has cast
Himself upon Christ, as the Prophets have counseled Him; yet since thereupon
He feels no such comfort, and peace in Believing as other Christians do; He
begins to doubt, whether He has done well, or no: and to conceive, that He
has laid hold upon the Promises too soon: Nay, and it may be upon this
discontent, does thus further enlarge His complaint: Alas! my sins have
formerly been so great, my heart is at this present so hard, my sorrow so
scant, my failings so many, etc. that I know not what to say to my Self. Me
thinks, I can neither pray, confer, love the Brethren, sanctify the
Sabbath, rejoice in the Lord, etc. as I see other of Gods Children do. And
therefore, I am afraid, all is naught: What heart can I have to hold on? I
say, if to such a speech, thou should for trial give this reply: Well then,
if it be so; even give over all, strive no more against the stream; trouble
thy self no longer with reading, prayer, following sermons, forbearing good
fellowship, and thine old companions. And since no comfort comes by casting thy
self upon Christ, cast thy self again into the current of the times, course
of the world, and merry company; For there yet, is there some little poor
pleasure to be had, at least: Oh! No, No, No, would He say; That will I never
do, whatsoever comes of me: I will trust in my Christ, tho He should kill
me; for all these discouragements, I will by no means, cast away my
confidence. I have been so freshly stung with their guilt, that I will rather
be pulled in pieces with wild horses, then plunge again into carnal
pleasures; I will put my hand to all holy duties in obedience to God, tho I
perform them never so weakly; I will, by the mercy of God, keep my face
toward Heaven, and back to Sodom, so long as I breath; come what come will,
etc. And whence, do you think, springs this resolution; but from a secret
saving power, supporting Him in the most desperate temptations, and assaults of
distrust?

Now this first, secret saving power, by which an humble Soul leaning upon
Christ is supported, when it is at the lowest; secondly, The seed of God, and
thirdly, presence of grace; do every one of them argue a blessed state, in
which thou shall be certainly saved; and therefore thou may lift up thine
heart and head, with comfort unspeakeable and glorious.

3. Thirdly, Many there are, who much complain of the great disproportion
between the notorious wickedness of their former life, and their lamentable
weakness of an answerable be wailing it: Between the number of their sins,
and fewness of their tears; the heinousness of their rebellions, and little
measure of their humiliation. And thereupon, because they did not find, and
feel those terrors, and extraordinary troubles of mind in their turning unto
God; those violent passions, and pangs in their New Birth, which they have
seen, heard, or read of, or known in others, perhaps, far less sinners
then themselves; they are much troubled with distractions and doubts about the
truth, and soundness of their conversion. Many are still questioning of their
beginnings; and though they came to Faith and comfort by these steps, yet are
still fearing, that they have not begun in truth, or that they are not in the
right way, or took comfort, ere it belonged unto them. And this, because their
corruptions be so strong, and that they cannot do as they would. But
corruptions felt, hated, and striven against, are no Marks that we are not
the Lords; but the contrary. It is the subtilty of Satan, to keep them ever at
the beginning, that they may never get forward. True, it is good to be very
careful in laying the foundation of our house; But if we be ever pulling up,
after it is laid, we shall never finish the Building. Moster Rogers of
Dedham, Doctr. of Faith, cap. 2. page 177. For a true Christian to deny the
work of Gods grace in Himself -- does no good to Him; But interrupts His
prayers, hinders his humiliation, estrangeth Him from God, and turns godly
sorrow for His sin, into desperate: sorrow for the punishment of sin.
Master Whately. Gods Husbandry, cap. 12.
Whereby they receive a great deal of hurt and hindrance in their spiritual
state. For Satan gains very much by such a suggestion, and grounds many times
a manifold mischief upon it. For by keeping this temptation on foot; these
doubts and troubles in their minds, whether they be truly converted or no;
He labors, and too often prevails:

1. To hinder the Christian in His spiritual Building. With what heart can He
hold on, who doubts of the soundness, and sure-laying of the foundation? What
progress is He like to make in Christianity, who continually terrifies
Himself with fearful exceptions and oppositions, about the truth of His
conversion? A man in a long journey, would jogge on but very heavily, if He
doubted whether He were in the right way, or no.

2. To abate, lessen, and abridge His courage in standing on Gods side,
patience under the Cross, spiritual mirth in good company: To keep Him in
dullness of heart, deadness of affections, distractions at holy exercises, and
under the reign of almost, a continual sadness, and uncomfortable walking:
To make Him quite neglect, and never look toward those sweet commands of the
blessed Spirit: Rejoice evermore. Rejoice, and I say again, Rejoice. Be glad
in the Lord, rejoice, and shout for joy all ye, that are upright in heart.

3. To fasten a great deal of Take heed of false reasoning; As because our
fire does not blaze out, as others, therefore we have no fire at all; and by
false Conclusions to sin against the Commandment, in bearing false witness
against our selves. The Prodigal would not say, He was no son; but that he
was not worthy to be called a Son. We must neither trust to false evidence,
nor deny true; for so we should dishonor the Work of Gods Spirit in us, and
lose the help of that evidence, which would cherish our love to Christ, and
arm us against Satan's discouragements. Some are so faulty this way, as if they
had been hired by Satan, the Accuser of the Brethren, to plead for Him, in
accusing themselves. Doctor Sibbes, Bruised Reed, page 94.
dishonor upon God; when He can make the Christian dis-avow, as it were, and
nullify in conceit, so great a work of mercy and grace, stamped upon His Soul
by an Almighty hand: A work for wonder and power answerable, if not
transcendent, to the Creation of the World. To the production whereof, the
infinite mercies of the Father of all mercy; the warmest hearts-blood of His
only Son; the mightiest Moving of the blessed Spirit were required. Now
what an indignity, and disparagement is offered unto so glorious a Workman,
and blessed a work, to assent and subscribe unto the Devil, a known Liar,
that there is no such Thing?

4. To double, and aggravate upon the Christian, the grievous sin of
unbelief: Not to believe the Promises, as they lie in His Book, is an
unworthy, and wicked wrong unto the Truth of God: But for a Man to draw back,
and deny, when they are all made good upon His Soul, makes Him worse then
Thomas the Apostle: For when He had thrust His hand into Christ's side, He
believed. But in the present Case, a Man is ready to renounce, and disclaim;
Tho He have already graspt in the arms of His Faith, the crucified bleeding
Body of His blessed Redeemer. The sacred and saving virtue whereof, has
inspired into the whole Man a new, spiritual, sanctifying life, and a
sensible, un-deniable change from what it was:

5. To discontinue, or detain the heart locked up, as it were, in a perpetual
barrennes, from giving of thanks; which is one of the noblest, and most
acceptable Sacrifice, and service, that is offered unto God. Now what a
mischief is this; that an upright heart should be laced up, and His Tongue tied
by the Devils temptation, from magnifying heartily the glory of Gods free
grace, for such a work? I mean, the New Creation; at which Heaven and Earth,
Angels and Men, and all Creatures may stand everlastingly amazed. So sweet it
is and admirable, and makes an immortal Soul for ever.

But to keep my self to the Point. Those who complain, as I have said: That
because the pangs of their New Birth were not in that proportion they desire,
answerable to the heinousness of their former pestilent courses, and
abominablenesse of their beastly life before, many times suspect themselves,
and are much troubled about the truth of their conversion; may have their
doubts, and scruples increased, by taking notice of such propositions as these,
which Divines both ancient and modern, let fall sometimes in their
Penitential Discourses.

Ordinarily men are wounded in their Consciences at their conversion,
answerably to the wickedness of their former conversation.

Contrition in true Converts, is for the most part proportionable to the
heinousness of Their former courses.

Homil. of Repentance, page 1.
The more wicked that thy former life has been, the more fervent and earnest,
let thy Repentance, or returning be.

Sorrow must be proportionable to our sins. The greater our sin, the
fuller must be our sorrow.

Secundum conscientiae molem exhibenda est poenitentiae magnitudo. Ambr. ad
Virg. ^orr. cap. 8.
According to the weight of sin upon the conscience, ought penitent sorrow to
be weighty.

1. cap. 2.
He that has exceeded in sin, let Him exceed also in sorrow.

per consens^m conspicit sordidius inquinatam. Ide^ in 3. cap. Job.
Let the mind of every One drink up so much of the tears of penitent
compunction, as He remembers Himself to have withered from God by
wickedness.

Grievous sins require most grievous lamentations.

Greenh. Grave Couns p. 16
The measure of your mourning must be agreeable, and proportionable to the
sin.

And we may see these rules represented unto us in the practice of Manasses,
who being a most grievous sinner: 2. Chron. 33.6. Humbled Himself greatly
before the God of His Fathers: verse. 12. In the Woman, who is called a Sinner;
Luke 7.37. (...), as they say, by a kind of singularity; and therefore takes
on extraordinarily, verse. 38. So that she wipes Christ's feet with tears. In
the idolatrous Israelites upon their turning unto the Lord: 1. Sam. 7.4.6. who
drew water, and poured it out before the Lord. In the Hearers of Peter, who
having their consciences all bloody with the horrible guilt of crucifying the
Lord of life; Act: 2.33.36. were pricked in their hearts: verse. 37. with such
horror and raging angvish, as tho so many empoisoned daggers and Scorpions
stings stuck, and were fastened in them (...), pungendo penetro. Punctim caede.
Scap.
punctually. In Paul, who having been an heinous offender, a grievous
Persecuter, Act. 9. whereas the other Apostles, as One says, had been honest
and sober fishermen, tasted deeper of this cup then they. For He tells us,
Romans 7.11. That the Law slew Him. He was strangely amazed with a voice from
Heaven, struck down to the earth, and stark blind. He trembled, and was
astonished: For three days He did neither eat, nor drink. etc. Act. 9.

And there is good reason for it. For ordinarily the newly-illightened eye of a
fresh-bleeding Conscience, is very sharp, and clear; piercing and sightfull;
greedy to discover every stain, and spot of the Soul; To dive even to the
heart-roote, to the blackest bottom and ougliest nooke of a Man's former
Hellish courses; to look back, with a curious survay, through the pure
Perspective of Gods righteous Law, over his whole life to His very Birth-sinne,
and Adams rebellion. And in this sad, and heavy search, it is very inquisitive
after, and apprehensive of all circumstances, which may add to the
heinousness of sin, and horror to his heart. It is quick-sighted into all
aggravating considerations; and quickly learnes, and looks upon all those
ways, degrees, and circumstances, by which sins are made more notorious and
hateful. And what the spirit of bondage, in a fearful heart, may infer
hereupon, you may easily judge.

Now to the Case proposed; I say, first;

1. That between sin and sorrow, we cannot expect a precise adequation; not
an Arithmeticall, but a Geometrical proportion: Great sins should be
greatly lamented; yet no sin can be sufficiently sorrowed for; Tho it may
be savingly. When we say, the pangs of the New Birth must be answerable to
our former sinful provocations; we mean not, that we can mourn for sin
according to it is merit; that is impossible: But great sins require a great
deal of sorrow. We must not think, that we have sorrowed enough for any
sin, tho we can never sorrow sufficiently.

Before I proceed to a further, and fuller satisfaction in the Point, let me
tell you by the way, how discomfortable, and doubtful, the Popish doctrine is
here about; that the truth of our Tenet may appear the more precious, and
taste more sweet.

Their Attrition and Contrition, as I take it, differ, as our Legal and
Evangelicall repentance; 1. In respect of the object. Contrition, as they say,
is sorrow for sin, as an offense to God: Attrition is a grief for sin, as
liable to punishment. 2. In respect of the cause. Contrition arises from
sonne-like, Attrition from servile fear. [See Valent. Disp. 7. Q. 8. De
contrit. punct. 2.]

This Contrition is the cause of the remission of sins. [Bellar. lib. 2. de
poenit. cap. 12. Arb. At Catholici] and alij passim. Well then, thou art a
Papist, and troubled inconscience. Thou know well, that without contrition
no remission: But when come thou to that measure and degree, which may give
thee some contentment about the pardon of thy sins? Go unto them in this
Point for resolution and relief, and thou goes unto a Rack. Consult with
their Chapters, de quantitate contritionis, of the muchnesse of sorrow, and
they are able to confound thee with many desperate distractions.

1. Look back upon the elder Schoolmen: and you shall have Adrian Quaest. de
poenit: Quodlib 5. Artic. 3.] and others tell you of a Contrition intensive
summa; in the highest s^reine; and to which nothing can be added, as Multo
minus requirere putandus Deus est, ut doleamus de peccato, dolor simpliciter
summ^, quo nullus intensior esse possit, ut Hadrianus requirere videtur. Tom.
4. disp. 7. qu. 8. De contritione punct. 5.
Valent. reports it. This opinion Vega refutes [ de iustif. lib. 13. cap. 14.
ad princ.] And Bellarmine dislikes it [ De poenit. lib. 2. cap. 11. Art.
denique si summus]. Note by the way, how sweetly they agree: our concord is
Angelical, in respect of their confusions.

2. Go to Scotus [ In 4. Sent. Did. 14. Q 2], and his Followers. And you
shall find him to talk of a certain intension of contrition; which is [ soli
Deo cognita] only known unto God: but this Greg. de Valent. censures as very
false [ Tom. 4. Col. 17.24]. You see again, as there is no truth in their
Tenets; so no constancy, no concord; and by consequent, no comfort to a truly
troubled spirit.

3. Come at length to the latter Locusts, some Modern Jesuits, dawbers over
of their superstitious ruins, with many rotten distinctions: I mean Bellar.
Greg. de Valent. and their fellows: And they dare not stand either to the
unknown intension of Scotus, nor that of highest pitch, which Hadrian holds:
But come in with a sorrow for sin, appreciative summus. And what is that,
think you?

Hence Bellarmine [for Valent. speaks more warily in the quoted place, Art.
Neque vero]. Yet very weakly too (for in such Cases, the troubled mind is not
wont to rest upon generals only, but will (will we, nill we) bring us to
particular; howsoever Scotus, Navar and Madin^, advise the contrary).

Sorrow for sin, says Dolor est summus appreciative, quando voluntas plur^s
aestimat detestationem alicuius mali, quam cuiuscunque boni consecutionim, aut
alterius mali evitationem. De poenit. lib. 2. cap. 11. Art. Secunda propositio.
he, is then summus appreciative when the will does more esteem the
detestation of sin, then the attainement of any good, or escaping any ill.
And so by consequent, (for as I intimated, a troubled conscience in such a
Case, is very curious, and inqui^itive; and will not stay only upon confused,
and general notions of good and ill, but easily descend to Particulars, to
know it is state more perfectly, especialy in a Point of so great importance) A
man must find his heart first to prize the hatred of sin, before the
happiness of heavenly joys, or avoiding hellish pains; before he can come
to comfort of the remission of his sins. What a torture were it to a troubled
spirit, to fall into the hands of such true Pharisees, who lay heavy burdens
upon others, but will not touch them themselves with the least of their
fingers. But blessed be God! we truly teach, that it is not so If any
cavilling Romanist except, and say, that this doctrine may open a way to sloth;
let him hear his own man, E^ius: Doctrina haec been intellecia non sovet
ignaviam poenitentium, sed dubias conscientias magis consolatur and in spem
^rigit, dum tradit sceundum Scripturas omnibus peccatoribus synce^e conversis
ad Deum and peccatum ex animo detestant: bus -- patcre reditum in gratium cum
Deo. In 4. Sent. Did. 16.. 8. Art. Ad extren^um].
much the measure and muchnesse, as the truth, and heartinesse of o^ sorrow;
which fits for the promises of life, and pardon of sin. Yet I must say this
also; He that thinks, he has sorrowed sufficiently, never sorrowed truly.
And I like Vtilissimum tamen est, peccata singula amarissime, et longo tempore
it a destere, ut con tritio non solum appreciative, sed etiam intensive, and
extensive, utsic loquamur, summa dici possit.
Bellarmines last Proposition well in the fore-^^^ted place; If it be thus
understood: That we must desire, aim, and endeavor after the highest pitch
of godly sorrow, which can possibly be attained. But (...) is one thing to
say; either, just so much measure of sorrow, or no mercy; such a quantity of
contrition, or no remission: An other thing to say, we must long and labor to
bring our naughty hearts to this: Even to be willing rather to lie in Hell,
then to live in sin. Perfections of grace are aimed at in this life, not
attained.

4. I confess some of them sometimes, by reason of freedom in their Schools,
overruled like Caiphas, or over-mastered by the clearenesse and
invinciblenesse of the truth, etc. speak something more orthodoxally. As in

Hereupon I have many times marvailed, that understanding Papists looking into
the Point, are not plunged into desperate perplexities; considering the Quidam
adcontritionem requiri dicunt summum conatum hominis, ideoque dolorem debere
esse iuxta vires hominus quam maxim intensum. Alijcertum quendam gradum
intensionis, itemque certam quantitatem extensionis seu continuationis in

variety of opinions, and uncertainety of the degree of sorrow, required to
their Contritio^. But when I reflected upon another rotten dawbing trick of
theirs, I rather wonder at the depths of their Antichristian craft, in so
politikly, and plausibly patching together their Popish Paradoxes; that they
may still keep their damnably-deluded Disciples in contentment, and please them
still, at least, with some palliate cures. It is this I mean; They hold also,
(prodigious infatuation!) it is impossible, that the learned on the Popes side
(but that, that curse is justly upon them; 2. These. 2.10.11. Because they
received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved: God sends them
strong delusion, that they should believe a lie) should ever be so grosely
blinded: I say, they hold, that a man Attritio virtute clavium fit Contritio.

contritus; and that ex opere operato, as Valent. affirms. Which upon the
matter is thus much: That having but only Attrition, Legal repentance, that
fruitless sorrow, which may be found in a Matthew. 27.3.
Judas, a Latomus; and which a reprobate may carry with him to hell, is, by the
virtue of their sained Sacrament, by the Sacr^mentall act of Ab^olution, as
they call it, made truly, and savingly Contrite, and put into a state of
justification. Hear it in the words of that great and famous light of In his
answer to the Jesuits challenge, page 145. and 150.
Ireland; and for ever abhor all such Popish impostures: When the Priest with
his power of forgiving sins, interposeth himself in the business, they tell
us, that Attrition, by virtue of the Keys, is made Contrition: that is to say,
that a sorrow arising from a servile fear of punishment, and such a fruitless
repentance, as the reprobate may carry with them to hell; by Receptissimum est
aliorum omnium Theologorum axionia, quod Sacramentum suppleat ex opere operato
defectum Contritionis. Disput. 7. q. 8. De Contritione Punct. 3.
virtue of the Priests absolution, is made so fruitful, that it shall serve the
tur^^ for obtaining forgiveness of sins; as if it had been that 2. Cor. 7.10.
godly sorrow, which works repentance to salvation, not to be repented of.
By which spiritual cousenage, many poor souls are most miserably deluded,
while they persuade themselves, that upon the receipt of the Priests
acquittance, upon this carnal sorrow of theirs, all skores are cleared until
that day; and then beginning upon a new reckoning, they sin and confess,
confess and sin a fresh, and tread this round so long, till they put off all
thought of saving repentance; and so the blind following the blind, both at
last follow into the pit. Or thus a little after:

It has been always observed for a special difference, betwixt good and bad
men, that the one Oderunt pec^are bon^ virtutis a more. Ho^. Lib. 1. Epist. 16.
hated sin for the love of virtue, the other only for the fear of
punishment. The like difference do our Adversaries make betwixt Contrition,
and Fatemur enim perfectum odium peccati esse illud, quod ex amore Dei
iustitiaeque procedit; and ideo dolorem sive odium ex timore poenae conceptum
non Contritionem sed Attritionem nominamus. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Poenit. cap. 8.
Art. Respondeo, si admit teremus].
Attrition. Id. Ibid.
That the hatred of sin in the one, proceeds from the love of God; and of
righteousness in the other, from the fear of punishment. And yet teach for
all this, that Attrition (which they confess, would not otherwise suffice to
justify a man) being joined with the Priests absolution is sufficient for that
purpose: He that was att^ite, being by virtue of this Absolution, made
contrite, and justified; that is to say, he that was led only by a servile
fear, and consequently was to be ranked among disordered, and evil persons,
being by this means put in as good a Case, for the matter of the forgiveness
of his sins, as he that loves God syncerely. For they themselves do grant,
that Argumentum recte probat ^os, qui timorem servilem habent, inor dinatos and
malos esse, etc. Id. Ibid. Art. Respondeo, argumentum].
such as have this servile fear, from whence Attrition issues, are to be
accounted evil, and disordered men, etc.

But leaving these blind Pharisees in the endless Maze of their inextricable
errors, until it please the Lord to illighten them, and by a strong hand pull
them out, which I heartily desire, and will ever pray; I come to prosecute mine
own Point.

2. Secondly, If you ask me, when trouble for sin is saving: I would
answer, when it is true. If you further demand, when it is true: I would say;
when it drives Thee utterly out of thy Self, and to sell all, in the sense I
have said before; and brings thee with a sincere thirst, and settled resolution
to Jesus Christ, to live and die with Him, as a Savior and a Lord; and is
accompanied with an universal change in Body, Soul and Spirit.

3. Thirdly, take notice of such considerations, as these:

1. God being a most free Agent, does not I grant, the Lord, who is the most
free Agent, takes liberty, and works as it pleases Him; and there is odds
and difference for time, measure, and such things: But for the general,
always the same; By humbling first, then comforting, etc. Master Rogers of
Dedham, Of Faito cap. 2. page 67.
tie Himself constantly, and unvariably, to ordinary, expected, set, and the
same forms, measures, times, proportions of his ways, and workings upon his
Children. For He is wise without limit, and above measure; and therefore has
many secret and glorious ends, and aims, which, according to His good
pleasure, much diversifie the means serviceable and subordinate thereunto.
From whence may spring these three Conclusions:

1. He may, for the most part, create in the heart of the true Convert,
terrors and troubles of Conscience; amazements and mourning, answerable, in
some good measure, to the variety, vanity, and villainy of His former wicked
ways, and lewd life. As appears before in Manasses, the sinful Woman,
Idolatrous Israelites, Hearers of Peter, and many in these days, if it were
convenient to name them. For the most part, says a great Divine, the violence
of humiliation in the Calling of a sinner, is according to the continuance and
greatness of His actual transgressions: According to the same, is the rent in
the conscience and Soul. Therefore, if there be any, who has been a great
and grievous sinner; and has not with violence been pulled from his sin, He
may do well to suspect, and search Himself soundly.

2. He may sometimes suffer a notorious sinner ^^ pass something more easily,
and unterribly through the Pangs of the New Birth. But then such a One is wont
to walk more humbly before God, all His life after; for that He was not
humbled with more remarkeablenesse of penitent remorse, and spiritual angvish
in His conversion: And so extension and continuance of Godly grief, that He
was not more grieved, makes up as it were that desired intension, and extremity
of pangs, which might justly have pained Him, in His passing from death to
life. Every hearty, and sensible complaint, that the Pangs of the New Birth
were not more painful, and proportionable to the pollutions of His youth, is,
as it were, and in the sense I have said, a Pang of the New Birth. Or else upon
some occasion afterward in His Christian course, He may be revisited, and
vexed afresh, with more terror and trouble of conscience, then in His first
change; As in such Cases as these: first, If He should, which God forbid, by
some volent enticement, and snaring opportunity, be entangled again, and
re-infected with any former sensual pleasure of His unregenerate time; or by
neglect of His care, and watchfulness over His ways, be suddenly surprised
with some new scandalous sin. Secondly, upon the assault of some extraordinary
frighting temptation, or pressing of hideous thoughts upon his melancholic
imagination. Thirdly, when some heavy David, Psalm. 38. being put in mind by
His sickness of Gods wrath against sin, was full sorely afflicted in Soul:
So that He cries; There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger:
neither is there any rest in my bones, because of my sin. For mine iniquities
are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. -- I
am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. -- I am
seeble, and sore broken; I have roared by reason of the disquietnesse of my
heart. -- My sorrow is continually before me.
cross, or sickness, after many prosperous days, shall seize upon Him, which
may lie sore, and long. Fourthly, upon His Bed of death; especially, if He
fall upon it immediately after some relapse, backsliding, or new wound of
Conscience. There is a kind of natural power, besides Gods special hand, in
sickness, sorrow, darkness, melancholy, the night, extraordinary crosses, the
Bed of death, to represent the true number, and heinousness of sins with
greater horror, and more unto the life: Whereas prosperity, health, and days
of peace, do rather delude the eyes of the conscience; and like false and
flattering glasses, make those foul Fiends seem fairer then they are indeed.
And therefore the christian, especially, that I speak of, being outwardly
distressed, cast upon His Bed of death, or any ways extraordinarily visited by
Gods hand, seeing his sins upon the sudden marshalled, and marching against
Him; more in number, and more fiercely then heretofore, may for the while be
surprised and exercised with unexpected terror; until, by meditation upon
Gods former special mercy unto Him, in spiritual things; upon the marks and
effects of His Change; upon the uprightness of His heart toward God in the
days of health; upon those testimonies, and assurances, which His Christian
friends can give Him, of His being in a gracious state; with such like holy
helps; And so in cold blood, and above all, resolving to sack so, ever fast to
the Lord Jesus, tho He kill Him; He be raised again from such dejections of
spirit, to the ^oonte^ confidence, and comfort of His interest in Christ, and
salvation of His Soul.

Here by the way, let none think it strange, that even the dearest servants of
Christ may be But how may this re^^^si^ation, with as great, if not greater

is a Son and that God is His Father? In answer: The same Spirit produces
these contrary effects: By the (...), fear, and terror; By the Gospel,
peace, and prayer. [ ^acit du^s spiritus (...) and adoptionis, and his

re-visited with more horror of conscience afterward, then at their first
turning on Gods side. As appears in Job, Ezechiah, David, in Mi^^. Brettergh,
Mr. Peacock, etc. See before, page 84. l 21. and 31. Besides the proposed

end, as it may seem, why Job was set up as a mark, for the envenomed Arrows
of the Almighty to aim at, and whole armies of terrors to fight against. He
approoved Himself to be steel to the back, as they say, by that victorious
ejaculation. Cap. 13.15. Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. Whereby
God was mightily honored, Satan utterly confounded, that controversy, whether
Job feared God for naught, or no? gloriously ended on Gods side. Sixthly, That
they may grow into greater conformity with their blessed Savior in spiritual
sufferings. Seventhly, That tasting again sometimes the bitterness of divine
wrath for sin, they may be the more frighted, and flee further from it.
Eighthly, That thereby the incomprehensible love of Christ toward them, may
sink deeplier into their hearts; who for their sakes, and salvation, drunk
deep and large; and the very dregs of that Cup; the least drop whereof, is to
them so bitter and intolerable. Ninthly, That by sometimes, sense of the
contrary, their joy in the favor and light of Gods countenance may be more
joyful; Their spiritual peace more pleasant, the pleasure of grace more
precious, the comforts of godliness more comfortable, etc. Tenthly, For
admonition to others: To draw duller and drouzy Christians to more strictness,
watchfulness and Zeal; by observing the spiritual troubles and terrors of
those, who are far more holy and righteous then themselves. To intimate unto
Formal Professors, that all is certainly naught with them, who ordinarily
are mere strangers to all afflictions of Soul, and sorrow for sin.
Eleventhly, For terror to many, who going on securely in their sensual
courses, are wont to cry down all they can, the power of preaching, by crying
to their companions thus, or in the like manner: Well for all this, we hope,
Hell is not so hot, nor sin so heavy, nor the Devil so black, nor God so
unmercifull, as these precise Preachers would make them, etc. How may such as
these be affrighted, and terrified upon this occasion, with pondering upon
that terrible Place, 1. Pet. 4.17.18. If judgment begin at the house of God,
what shall the end be of them, that obey not the Gospel of God? And if the
righteous scarcely be save^; If Gods Children have their consciences scorched,
as it were, with the flames of Hell; where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear? But even in the bottom of that fiery Lake, and amidst the
unquenchable rage of those endless flames. Twelfthly, For the just hardening
of such as hate to be reformed, and are desperately resolved against the
saving preciseness of the Saints. It may be in this manner: A godly Man has
lived long, amongst Rebels, thorns and Scorpions, scorners, railers,
Persecutours; who, although He has shined all the while as a Light, in the midst
of a crooked and perverse generation; yet they were ever so far, from being
heated with love of heavenly things, by His holy life; or won unto good by
His gracious example: that like so many Bats and Owls, impatient of all
spiritual light, they did either fly from it, as far as they could in
affection, practice, if not in Habitation; Or fell upon it fiercely with their
envenomed Claws of spite and cruelty, to extingvish quite, if it were
possible, such blessed beams of saving Light; and to darken with Hellish mists
of ignorance, and ill life, the Place where they live. They wilfully blinded
themselves with a pestilent conceit; That His sincerity was nothing but
Hypocrisy; His holiness, only humor; His forwardness Phantasticallnesse;
His sanctification, singularity. And thereupon resolved, and boisterously
combind against Him, with all their policy, purses, and possibilities; like
those ungodly Ones, Wisd. 2. Let us lie in wait for the righteous: because He
is not for our turn, and He is clean contrary to our doings; He upbraideth
us with our offending the Law, and obiecteth to our infamy, the transgressings
of our education, etc. I say, now God may suffer such a Man upon His
Deaths-bed, to fall into some more extraordinary, and markable discomfort, and
distress of Conscience: Of which those graceless wretches taking greedy
notice, may thereby be desperately obstinated, and hardened in their lewd and
carnal courses. For seeing Gods hand upon Him in that fearful manner, and
wanting the spirit of discerning, they do conclude most peremptorily, that for
all His great shows, He was most certainly but a Counterfeite. And so
themselves become, upon that occasion, many times more, most implacable enemies
to grace, and all good men; They are stronglier locked up in the arms of the
Devil, faster nailed to formality, or good-fellowship; and which is the
perfection of their madness and misery, bless themselves in their hearts,
saying merrily to their Brethren in iniquity: You see now what these men are,
which make themselves so holy, and are so hot in religion: These are the
Fellows, which pretend to be so scrupulous and precise: and of that singular
streine of sanctity, that they think none shall be saved but themselves, etc.
You see in this Man the desperate ends of such hypocritical Puritans.

Thus the glory of Gods justice is justly magnified, by letting them grow
stark blind, who wilfully shut their eyes against the Light of grace; by
giving them over to a reprobate mind, who so maliciously hated to be
reformed; And so too often, they walk on for ever after, with confidence, and
hardness of heart, which cannot repent, in a perpetual prejudice against
purity, and the power of godliness; unto the Pit of Hell. Whereas by the mercy
of God, and inviolable constancy of His Covenant, that blessed Man, by these
terrors, and afflictions of Conscience, besides glorifying God in hardening
others, is, as it were, the more thoroughly fitted and refined, for that glory,
which is presently to be revealed.

3. Greatest humiliations do not ever argue, and import the greatest Sinners.

vel aliena. 2. Altera, ut exerceamur, probemur; and ne peccemus cauti reddamur,

Joan. cap. 9. Docet Christus ut maxim omnes homines peceatores sint: non tamen

Brentius Ibid.
are not always the cause of our afflictions, particularly and directly; But
some times, some other Motives. Abraham was put unto that heavy Task, of
taking away His own only dear sons life, principally for the trial of His
Faith: Job was visited with such a matchless variety, and extremity of
afflictions, upon purpose to end that controversy between God and Satan;
whether He feared God for naught, or no? Gods heavy hand was sometimes upon
David, specially, for the manifestation of His innocence: See Psalm. 17.3. Nay
our blessed Savior, infinitely free from sin, was notwithstanding tempted
and tried by Satan and the world; that His heavenly virtues, and divine
excellencies might appear, and be made more illustrious. And Himself tells
us, Ioh. 9.3. that the blind man was so borne; neither for His own sin, nor
for the sin of His Parents; But that the works of God should be made
manifest in Him.

For the particular I have in hand: To prevent some sin, into which He sees
His Child inclinable, and like to fall; by reason of some violent occasion,
natural propension, strong temptation, industrious malice of the Devil to
disgrace Him, and His Profession scandalously, etc. God in great mercy, may
give Him a taste, nay, a deep draught of the unexpressable terrors of a
troubled mind Now whether a Man, after He is in state of grace, may feel
this wound bleed afresh, is a question with some, through their weakness; Tho
if we consult with Scripture and experience, the question is out of question,
Lo, all these things (says Elihu truly) works God oftentimes with a Man,
that He may turn back His Soul from the Pit. Examples are frequent, etc.
Sclater in h^^ S.S.S.
again; that thereby, He may be taught betime, to take more heed, walk
more warily, and stand upon His guard with extraordinary watchfulnes, against
the very first assault, and least insinuation of sin. There is preventing
Physic for preservation of health, as well as that, when the disease is
dangerously upon us, for recovery. There was given unto Paul a Thorn in the
flesh, etc. 1. Cor. 2.12.
If we will take the interpretation of some learned Divines, A wound in the
spirit, the sting of Conscience, pressing Him down to the nethermost Hell in
His sense, that was erst taken up to the highest Heaven; upon purpose, lest He
should swell with spiritual pride, be puffed up, and exalted above measure,
with the abundance of revelations. If we well weigh the admirable story, of
that gracious and holy servant of Christ, Mistress Bret^ergh; we may probably
conceive, that a principal end, why those most grievous spiritual afflictions
of Soul, upon Her last Bed, were laid upon Her, was in Gods just judgment,
to blind yet more those bloody Papists about Her; and because they wilfully
shut their eyes against that glorious Light of true religion, which she so
blessedly, and fruitfully expressed in her godly life; to let them thereby sincke
yet deepelier into strong delusion; that they might stick still more stiffely
to Popish lies: According to that Prophecy of the Antichristians; a These.
2.10.11.12. Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might
be saved: For this cause, God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the
truth, etc. Which we see at this day verified, with a witness, in Popish
Doctors, even their greatest Scholars; as Bellarmine, and other Polemicall
Writers. And therefore, let us never marvel, that tho they be laden with
much learning; yet that they should lie ^gregiously* and defend with infinite
obstinacy, and clamor, the Doctrine of Devils, that accursed Hydra of
Heresies, in their voluminous Dunghils. Now Gods judgment in hardening them
hereby, as I have said, was the more just; because they were so far from
being wrought upon, and won by Her heavenly conversation; that they were
extraordinarily enraged against Her goodness and Profession of the Gospel. As
appears, in that, besides their continual railing, and roaring against Her,
as an eminent Light, like so many furious Bedlams; they barbarously wreckt
their malice and spite, upon the dumb, and innocent creatures, It is not
unknown in Lancashire, what Horses, and Cattle of her Husbands were killed
upon His grounds* in the night most barbarously, at two several times, by
Seminary Priests (no question) and Recusants, that lurked there abouts And what
a loss and hindrance it was unto Him, being all the stock He had on His
grounds, to any purpose. In the story of the holy life and Christian death of
Mistress Katherin Brette^gh, page 6.
by killing, at two several times, Her Husbands Horses and Cattle in the
night.

That her fiery Trial, through which she passed, as purest gold, into Abraham's
bosom, did thus harden them, is manifest by the Event. For, as the reverent
Penman of that story reports; Ibid. in Mast. Leyghs Postscript to Papists.
Those of the Romish faction bragged, as though an Oracle had come from Heaven,
to prove them Catholics, and us Heretics. Prodigious folly! Damnable
delusion!

It is so then, that God in His inflicting of afflictions, does not ever Et
sipeccatum in quibuscunque calamitatibus causae locum semper habeat, nempe
efficientis and originalis: tamen non semper peccati poena finis est is, quem
intuetur Deus. etc.
aim at sin, as at the principal end. And yet do not mistake: Tho He
punishes sometimes, and not for sin; yet never without sin; either
inherent, or imputed. There is ever matter enough in our sinful Souls, and
Bodies, and lives, to afflict us infinitely. The best of us brought with us
into this world, that corruption, Si Deus peccata respiciat, and iniquitatis
merita, nullam est adeo ingens supplicium, quo non merito affligamur omnes,
quotquot origin^m nostram ex. Adamo ducimus. Si enim Deus, iniquitatem
observauerit, quis sustinebit? Psalm. 130.3. Brent. In Johan. Cap. 9.
which might bring upon us all the plagues of this, and the other life: Every
man has in Himself, sufficient fuel for the fire of Gods wrath to work
upon still, if it pleased Him in justice to set it on flame. As in the present
Point of spiritual terrors, and troubles of mind; if God should out of His
just and causefull indignation, put the full sting but into the least sin; it
were able to put a man into the very mouth of Hell. (But I speak of Gods more
ordinary ways, and dealings with the Sons of men) And so I say, God may
sometimes, for some hidden, and holy ends, seen, and seeming good to His
heavenly wisdom, bring a less heinous sinner, through extraordinary horror,
out of his natural state, into the good way.

2. Aggravation of horror is occasioned; terrors and troubles may be
multiplied, and enlarged in our enlargement, from the state of darkness, and
Chains of the Devil, by,

1. Some precedents, and preparatives, which God sometimes in His unsearchable
wisdom does immediately premise; or suffer to fall out. As,

1. Some heavy cross, and grievous affliction; to make the power of the Law
more passable, and fall more heavily upon our stubborn, and stony hearts. This
we see in Manasses, who was, as it were, fired out of His bloody, and
abomiable courses, by the heaviness, and horror of His chains; And so was
humbled greatly before the God of His Fathers. 2. Chron. 33.11.
Gods extraordinary angry visitations, make men many times cry with troubled,
and grieved hearts; Come, Let us turn unto the Lord; He has wounded us. etc.

a. Strange terrors sometimes arising from external Accidents; yea, hidden
natural causes; uncouth visions, and apparitions, full of amazement and fear;
Bodily distempers; horrible injections, hideous thoughts, etc. Whereby they are
mightily affrighted before hand, and prepared to pass through the Pangs of the
New Birth more terribly.

3. Some heinous and crying sin, which He suffers some to fall into, and
immediately upon it awakes the Conscience. That Almighty Physician, who is able
to bring health out of poison; death out of life; Light out of darkness;
Heaven out of Hell; may by accident, as they say, prepare One to conversion, by
giving Him over to the height of some One, or more abhorred abominations, and
crimson sins: As we may see in Peter's Hearers, Act. 2. Paul, Manasses, the
sinful Woman, Publicans and Harlots; left to the killing of Christ, spilling
the blood of the Saints, those horrible outrages, extreme filth, extorsions,
pollutions. Physicians, by ripening diseases, make way to heal them; For sick
matter is never more easily removed, then when it exceeds in ripeness, and
quantity.

4. Lying long in ignorance, sensuality, and dissolute life; without
profitable, and powerful means. In this Case upon the first awaking, and
affrighting the Conscience for sin, it may be exposed to many terrible
perplexities, and longer continued terrors. For the light of Natural
Conscience, bred with them in their own bosoms, may in the mean time serve
to enrage, and torture; as we see in many guilty Heathens: but there is no
natural light, to lead us to Christ, and Evangelicall comforts. The
commandments have ground in nature; but the mystery of the Gospel is wholly
supernatural. We find it by manifold experience, what an hard, and heavy
Task it is, to undertake a poor ignorant Soul, troubled in mind. The Cure
is many times very difficult, dangerous, and long. The darkness of their
ignorance, being now distressed in Conscience, is very fit, and fearful
matter, for Satan to work in hideously; and to play his pestilent prankes of
most gross impostures, and much Hellish cruelty. His malicious maine Plot
against such, ordinarily is, and His utmost endeavor; to drive them to
Selfe-destruction, if it be possible, before they get understanding in the
ways of God; of we can get any competent light, and comfort into their
consciences.

2. Some concurrent circumstances: As,

1. The melancholic, and sad constitution of the Party. That humor does
naturally give extraordinary entertainment, and edge to terrors and sorrows.

2. The crabbednesse, and crookedness of His natural disposition, which must
be tamed, and taken down with more ado; with much violence, and renting. An
hard and knotty Block, must have an hard wedge. An angry word, or frown, will
work more with some dispositions; then many sore blows upon a cross, and
sturdy spirit. God is here wont sweetly, and wisely to apply Himself to the
several natures, conditions, and dispositions of His Children.

3. Height of Place, and Happiness to have for this life, that heart can wish.
Whereby it comes to pass, that men are so deeply drowned in sensuality
Epicurisme, and earthly mindedness; that for a through Change, they have need
many times to be taken down thoroughly with a deep sense of legal terrors.

4. Excellency of natural, or acquired Parts, and endowments; as wit,
learning, courage, wisdom, etc. wretchedly abused, and long mis-imploied,
upon wrong and wicked Objects. Much ado, many times, and a great measure of
humiliation, will hardly fright such vain over-valewers of themselves, and
Idolizers of their own sufficiencies, from their admired follies. And here
also Satan interposeth most furiously, and hinders this happy work all He can
possibly. For He well knows, That, if such noble, and worthy Parts should be
sanctified to the Owners, and turned the right way; His Kingdom would fare the
worse, and He should be a great looser. Suppose, a Christian Prince should
with his Army break into the Turks dominion: Would not the Turks fortify
those Castles best, out of which being won, the enemy might do Him most
harm? So whom the Devil sees to be the likeliest Instruments for the
overthrow of his kingdom, if once they become Temples of the Holy Ghost; those
He is lothest to loose, and labors mightily ^o keep in His slavery still.
And therefore He opposes with all His power, and policy; raising as many
tempests of terror, as He is able; that He might either drive them back in
their Passage to the holy Path, or swallow them up into the abhorred gulphe of
despair, by the way.

5. A more searching, and piercing Ministry; which is ordinarily wont to awake
the conscience with more terror; to irradiate, and fill it with more
universal, and clearer light, to quicken it with more apprehension; and so
proportionably, to affect and afflict it with a more feeling, and fearful
sense of Gods most just, and holy wrath against sin. Whereupon they become
excellent, and everlasting Christians.

6. Biting it in, as they say, and not opening the wound of Conscience betime
to some skillfull Soule-Physition, may be an unhappy means, much to enlarge,
both the continuance, and extremity of a Man's spiritual trouble. Shame,
bashfulnesse, pretense of want of opportunity, hope to get through by Himself,
etc. are ordinary keys to lock up his tongue at such a time. But sure I am,
Satan has a chief stroke, and principal part to persuade concealment. For
alas! He winnes by it woefully: All the while He plies with great advantage,
and much subtilty, his hideous temptations to Selfe-killing; despair of mercy,
returning again to folly, etc. And it is to be feared, which is a most
grievous thing; that sometimes, by this cruel silence, He conquers, and casts
some poor souls, upon the bloody, and most abhorred villainy of
Selfe-perishing. Let such an One then be ever sure most resolutely, to break
through the Devils accursed snare in this kind; and to power out His
Soule-secrets betime, into some faith full holy bosom. I have heard many,
after they have escaped tell what strange tricks, and variety of devises He
practiced, to discourage, divert, and dis-able them to discover their minds,
as they purposed; even when they were come, with much ado, into the presence
of the spiritual Physician.

3. The ends to which God prepares, and fits some by their sore travail, in
the New Birth, and longer langvishing under His visiting hand in this kind.
God may purpose sometimes in such cases:

1. To Gods Children are bruised Reeds before their conversion, and often times
after: Before Conversion, all, (except such as being bred up in the Church, God
has delighted to show himself gracious unto, from their Child hood) yet in
different degrees, as God sees meet; and as a difference is, in regard of
temper, parts, manner of life: so Gods intendment of employment for the time to
come: For usually he empties such of themselves, and makes them nothing,
before He will use them in any great services. Doctor Sibbes, Bruised Reed,
page 10.
employ them, as Christ's most resolute, and undanted Champions, in more worthy
services. In managing whereof, remembrance of their having been once, as it
were, in the mouth of Hell, and scorched with flames of terror, serves as a
continual spur, and incentive unto them, to do nobly, and to supply them,
from time to time, with mightiness of courage, height of resolution, and
eminency of Zeal, in those glorious ways. As we may see in those renowned
pillars of the Church, Austin, Luther, etc. The higher and greater the building
is, the deeper must the foundation be laid in the earth.

2. To make them afterward of excellent use, and special dexterity, out of
their former experience, to speak unto the hearts of their Brethren, ready to
sink into the same gulphe of horror, and danger of despair; out of which,
the good hand of Gods gracious providence, has by such, and such means, so
mercifulLy pulled, and preserved them. The same keys, which dip open the
locks, and loose the fetters, which Satan hung upon their heavy hearts; may
happily undo those also, which He has fastened upon the Souls of others.

3. To render them to the Church, as remarkable Precedents, and Mirrours of
mortification, Selfe-denial, heavenly mindedness, and holy walking with God;
for others to look upon, and imitate. Mindfulnesse of their former wrestling
with the wrath of God, despair, and the horrors of Hell; makes them for ever
after, more mindlesse of earthly things, weaned from the world, startling at
every appearance of evil, greedy of godliness, conversing in Heaven,
excellent Christians indeed. Master John Glover, after five years horrible
afflictions of Soul, was framed thereby, says Master Fox, to such
mortification of life, as the like lightly has not been seen; in such sort,
as He being like one placed in Heaven already, and dead in this World, led a
life altogether celestial, etc. See Acts and Monuments. page 1885.

3. In sound contrition, and saving Repentance, let us for the present take
notice,

Of, first, a sensible smart, and angvish of the heart. Secondly, a Quan vis
resipiscentia dolorem semper secum adferat de peccatu ^raeteritis and
praesentibus; non tam proprie tamen aut ^ssentialiter consistit in dolor,
atque in aversatione, and odio peccati, and in firmo proposito hom prosequendi.
Amos 5.14.15. Odio habete malum and amate bonum. Amesius Medull. Theol. lib. 1.
cap. 26. Sect. 32.
dislike, hatred, and aversion in the Will. Thirdly, a change of the mind,
illightened, and now enabled to give stronger reasons out of Gods Book, love
of Christ, etc. against any sin, then carnal reason, the Devil Himself, or
the drunken eloquence of His old Good. fellow companions can suggest to the
contrary. Fourthly, an universal opposition, and constant endeavor against
all manner of iniquity. Fifthly, an hearty sorrow, that we are not more
sorrowful.

Now, say I, If thou should not feel in thine heart that stirring grief,
and violent renting, for those many rebellions, and horrible filth of thy
naughty heart, and former wicked life, which thou heartily desires; their
hamousnesse exacts at thine hands, and many lesser sinners, then thy self have
endured: yet if thou find an unfeigned hatred, and N^n nocent peccata

grief, because thou art not more grieved; Thou art by no means to cast away
thy confidence, or be discomforted therefore, as tho Thou were not truly
converted: but only be advised, to take occasion thereupon, to walk more
humbly before thy God: with syncerity and constancy, to oppose all things which
may hinder; and pursue all means, that may further the more kindly melting of
thine heart, sensible sorrow, and hearty mourning over Him, whom thou have so
cruelly pierced with thy youthful lusts, and abominations.

4. Fourthly, lest any true-hearted Christian, lying in no sin against
Conscience, and laboring syncerely to please God in all things, should be
unnecessarily troubled and dejected with slavish fears and jealousies, lest
He be not truly turned unto God; because He feels not in Himself, that
boisterous, vehement conversion, that extremity of pangs, and horror in the
New Birth, which sometimes are to be found in some others: Let Him ponder upon
these resemblances:

1. Thou may have thy Bile, or Botch, opened with the Point of a Needle;
whereas another Man endures the slashing of a Surgeons Lancer; yet if the
corruption, and putrified matter be let out by this easier means, and thy
self thereby thoroughly cured, I hope thou have no great cause to complain. It
may be so in the present Point.

2. Two Sons are punished for their offense: The One, cries, and roares, and
takes on extraordinarily: The Other makes no great noise, but resolves silently
with Himself, and in syncerity, upon a new course, as well as the former: Is
not the change and reformation of them both equally welcome, and accepted of
the Father, who only aims at, and expects their amendment?

3. Two Malefactors equally guilty of high treason; both apprehend their
danger; acknowledge that they are utterly undone; hold themselves for dead Men,
etc. To the One a Pardon comes, not yet cast, condemned, or carried to the
Place of execution: To the other, ready to lay down His head upon the Block:
There is great difference in all likely hood of their terrors and dejections:
But they have equal parts in the Pardon, and both their lives are saved.

4. Two Men are arrived at their wished Port: The One was tossed with many
roaring tempests, and raging waves; The Other has a reasonable calm Passage:
Howsoever, they now stand both safe upon the shore, and have both escaped
destruction and drowning in that great merciless devouring Gulf.

Those who are so happy, as by the be ^esit of r^ligious Parents, a g^^ly
family, good ed^cation under powerful means, have never entered upon any
noto^^ousnesse, but by Gods blessing upon those means have suckt-in grace in
their younger years, as is said of Timothy; And such also, as after a profane
course have been turned unto God, somewhat more easily, then ordinary; And so
both complain of the want of that testimony of terrible Pangs in their
conversio^, which they hear others take of; yet I say, being now upright
hearted, and in the holy Path: they may take comfort by comparing themselves
with, and casting their eyes upon a world of unregenerate people about them;
from which by the mercies of God, they differ as far, as living Men from a
number of rotten dead Carions, and so may assure themselves of soundness.
5. Suppose a Man dead for some days, and then revived; He perceives His
Change with a Witness: An Other is not so, but Himself only alive, walks
amongst a multitude of dead men; He also may clearly enough see the
difference, and both acknowledge, and praise God for His life.

Yet for conclusion; let all those who have passed through the Pangs of the
New Birth, not so terribly, but more tolerably, especially, having been
formerly notorious; take counsel, and be advised, to ply more carefully, the
great and gracious work of humiliation still, to humble themselves in the
sight of the Lord, yet more and more unto their dying day. Altus est Deus,
humilit est Christianus. Si vuli ut altus: Deus (...) tur illi, ^le humilis
sit. Magna mys^eria fratres, Deus super omnia est: Erigis te, ^^ uanillum
ta^^gis: ilu^ilias te, and ipse ad te descendit. August in Psalm. 34.
The humblest Christians are ever highest in favor, and nearest in familiarity
with Almighty God. They are, as it were, His second royal Throne, wherein He
sweetly dwells and delights. See Isai. 57.15. and 66.1* 2. Psalm. 34.18. and
51.17. And they are also of the most sweet, amiable, and in-offensive carriage
amongst the people of God. Hear that excellent Daniel Dyke, In His Treatise of
Repentance, cap. 5.
Artist in the spiritual Anatomy of Man's deceitful heart: Humiliation is the
procurer of all other graces. 1. Pet. 5.5.
God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble. -- And it is the
preserver of grace procured. And therefore compared to a strong foundation,
upholding the building against the force of wind and weather. Only those
streams of grace hold out, that flow out of the troubled Fountain of a
bruised spirit. An humbled Professor quickly starts back, even as a broken
Egg, or Ches-nut leapes out of the fire. Grace is no where safe, but in a
sound and honest heart. Now, Non est cor integrum, nisi sit scissum.
only the humble heart is the honest heart. Only a rent and broken heart, is
a whole and sound heart. The dross cannot be purged out of the gold, but by
melting. Crooked things cannot be straightned, but by wringing. Now
humiliation is that which wrings, and melts us; and makes us of drossy, pure;
of crooked, straight and upright; and so, sound, durable, and persevering
Christians.

And let them consider and examine, whether neglect of this holy endeavor, I
now exhort them to, may not bring upon them much spiritual misery: Whether
they may not therefore, be the rather exposed; First, To many irksome
intrusions of very vexing doubts and fears; and something slavish questionings
of the truth, and soundness of their conversion all their life long. Secondly,
To much deadness of affection and listlesnesse; many dampes and distempers in
the performance of holy duties, use of the Ordinances, and religious exercises.
Thirdly, To greater variety of Crosses, and a heavier hand upon their outward
states; purposely to bring the eye of their Conscience to look back more
heavily, and with heartier remorse upon the loathsomeness and filth of their
youthful folly. Fourthly, To more easiness of re-entry and surprise, by the
assaults, and insinuation of old sins in their un-regenerate time, especially
that of the bosom; which is an horrible Thing. For the less sins are
sorrowed for, the sooner do they re-insnare us with their sensual delight,
and re-pollute with renewed Acts. Fifthly, To the entertainment at least, for
a time of uncomfortable and scandalous giddiness, and some Fantastical
Tenants of new and naughty opinions; which many times fearfully infect our
chiefest City; and some proud companions, and ignorant Lozels there, and
els-where, are ever ready to lay hold upon: whom you may ordinarily discern by
their Luciferian pride, and lewd Tongues, to the great hurt, and hinderance of
the power of godliness, holy obedience to the blessed Law of God, and humble
walking with Him; if any will be so miserable and mad, as to listen to such
petty and paltry trash, idle and cheating dreams, contrary to the doctrine
which they have learned, or should have learned; (for these fellows were never
well catechized); if Professors will be Children still, tossed to and fro,
and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of Men, and
cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: which God forbid.
For if it be possible, that any true heart be entangled, I hope He will
quickly in cold blood, dis-insnare Himself. As these Tare-sowers themselves
are ordinarily very superficial in Ministerial abilities; so, for the most
part, their disciples are only the foolish Virgins, and unsound Professors of
the Places, through which they pass. Sixthly, To danger of some future grievous
desertion, extraordinary temptations, or re-visitation with far greater
terrors then they tasted, at their first turning into the ways of God, etc.

4. In a fourth Place, I come to spiritual desertion, which puts the
Christian, for the present, into a most Tretatio desertionis est omnium
gravi^sima: and diet solet s^^pensio gratiae, agon conscientiae, auxietas
infernalis. Alst. Theolog. Call. Cap. 9. (...) cr^ciatuum insernali^m.
dark and dis-co^fortable condition. I mean, when the most wise God, for some
holy ends seeming good unto Himself, retires for a time; and withholds from
the heart of his Child, the light of His countenance, the beams of His
favor, and sense of His love: Whereupon tho the root of spiritual life, the
Habit of Faith, and fundamental power of salvation, and eternal safty,
remain still, and sure in His Soul; never to be shaken, or prevailed
against, no, not by the very gates of Hell, or concurrent forces, and fury of
all the powers of darkness; yet for the time, He finds and feels in
Himself, a fearful deprivation, and dis-continuance of the feeling, and
fruition of Gods pleased face; exercise of Faith; pardon of sin; inward
peace; joy in the holy Ghost; cheerfulness in well-doing, and godly duties;
confidence in prayer; assurance of being in a saving state, etc. So that He
may judge But how is it possible, that He should entertain any such conceit;
since He knows in His own conscience, that He has formerly made conscience of
all sin to avoid them; and labored to please God in all things; infalliable
Notes of a New Man? Answ. In height, and heat of temptation, He may think,
that all the good He did, was in pride and Hyprocrisie: So did M. P. and that
He forbore sin, only for slavish fear: So did G. W. And yet the darkness
of His horror and error dispersed, He comes again to Himself, and sees
clearly, that tho with much weakness, yet He did both the one and the other
in syncerity: as did both these blessed Saints of God afterward.
Himself, to have been formerly an Hypocrite; and for the present, can very
hardly, or not at all, difference and distinguish His woeful condition, from
that of a Castaway. This secret and wonderful work of spiritual desertion,
does God much exercise and practice upon His Children, in many Cases, for many
See an heap of them coucht together in Austin: Sed ne ti^eas, O sponsa, ne
desperes, ne existimes te contemni, si paulisper tibi subtrahit sponsus faciem

Causes.

1. Sometimes upon a re-ensnarement in some secret bosome-lust, which was their
Darling and delight, in the days of their rebellion: Relapse into which, Satan
labors industriously to procure, with much ado by all His Devises; For He
gains greatly thereby. For so the New-Convert, considering in cold blood what
He has done, may be cast upon such complaints as these: Alas! what have I
done now? This pestilent old pollution, which so woefully wasted my conscience
in time past, has fearfully re-infected my newly washed Soul: I have again,
Woe is me! fallen into the abhorred Sodom of this foul sin: I have grieved
that good spirit, which was lately come to dwell in me: All the former horrors
charge afresh upon my heart, from which I was happily freed, even by some
glimpses of heavenly joy: I have wretchedly let go my hold; lost my peace;
broke my vows, and blessed communion with my God, etc. Ah! wretch that I am,
what shall I now do? And thereupon may fall upon a temptation of returning to
His dis-avowed sensual Delights; out of this conceit, As well over boots, as
over shoes: Do what I can, I see I can never hold out, etc. Or He may plunge
into this slavish perplexity: I dare not go to God, I have used Him so
villanously after such immeasurable kindness; and provoked the eyes of his
glory, with such prodigious impurity, after I was purged: I dare not fall
again to good-fellowship and former courses, lest I draw some remarkable
vengeance upon me in the mean time, and be certainly damned, when I have
done: So that He can neither take pleasure, upon the right hand, or the left:
Or, which is most for my purpose, and that which the Devil specially desires,
God therefore may hide His face from Him, and leave Him to the darkness of His
own spirit; so that He may for a long time walk on heavily, stark lame, in
respect of those comfortable supporters of the Soul; affiance, hope,
spiritual joy, peace of Conscience, sense of Gods favor, boldness in His
ways, courage in good causes, delight in the company of the Saints, etc.

Such a dampe also, and desertion may come upon the Soul, especially after a
Fall into some new, open, scandalous sin; whereby not only their own
Consciences within are grievously wounded; but also for their sakes and sin,
the Profession of Gods truth abroad scandalized and disgraced; the common state
of goodness questioned and traduced, the heart and glory of Christianity hurt
and distained.

David was thus dealt with in Gods just judgment, after His monstrous and I
mean; He being Gods dear Child.
matchless fall. Gods good Spirit had richly crowned His royal heart with
abundance of sanctification and purity; and had graciously filled Him
aforetime, with the fruits and feeling thereof; and thereupon many heavenly
deawes, no doubt, of spiritual joys, had many times sweetly refreshed His
blessed Soul: But by the heinous scandalousnesse of His hateful fall, He so
grieved that good Spirit, and turned the face of God from Him, that He had
neither sense of the comforts of the one, nor of the favor of the other. The
spiritual life of his Soul, the eye of His judgment, light of conscience,
lightsomnesse in the holy Ghost, and the whole grace of sanctification, were so
wasted, dazeled, confounded, weakened, raked under the ashes, as it were, and
run into the root; that he speaks, as if He had utterly lost them, and so
stood in need of a new infusion, and creation thereof, Psalm. 51.10. But by
the way, conceive aright of David's spiritual condition at this time: Tho in
his own feeling, and present apprehension, He so complains, and cries out
for a New creation, as tho all were gone; yet even when He was at the lowest,
and worst, the Soul and substance, that I may so speak, of saving In

grace and salvation did abide still rooted, and resident in his heart. Which
once emplanted by Gods omnipotent merciful hand, in an humble Soul, and
taking root, it there sticks fast for ever, far more un-mooveable then a
thousand Mount Zyons. The Hear Theo* hilact upon ye same Theme, in Peter's

rendered ventus, then spiritus, as it is ordinarily translated] tamen radix

blossoms, buds and fruits may sometimes be foully cankerd, as it were, by our
own corruptions; shrewdly nipt by the frost of some earthly affections;
blasted by sharper tempests of Satan's temptations: But the foundation stands
sure, grounded, and founded upon the unchangeable Nature of God, and
immutability of His counsel; and therefore mauger the malice of all, both
mortal and immortal rage, there is still life in the root; which in due
season will spring out again, and grow up unto everlasting life.

To the present Instance: All purity, and cleanness of heart was not utterly
extinguished and abolisht in David: For,

1. Some little, at least, was left, which descried, and discovered those spots
and pollutions of filthiness and impurity, which had lately over-growne it.
For grace discovers corruption, not nature. A sensible complaint of hardness
of heart, and an earnest desire after softness, is a Sign, that the heart is
not wholly hard: A sincere crying out against impurity, and hearty endeavor
after purity, argues the presence of the purifying Spirit.

2. And how was this holy ejaculation, Create in me a clean heart, O God; and
renew a right spirit within me, created, Mansisse Semen Dei in Davide lapso,
res ipsa testatum facit: Id enim suscitatum Nathanis concione: Tu virille
mortis: mox eum in confessionem criminis, doloris, and resipiscentiae
prorumpere, and exclamare fecit: Peccavi: Malum feci: Miscrere mei Deus
secundum magnitudinem miserationum tuatum. Id semen precatur sibi non auferri:
Spiritum tuum sanctum ne auferas a me: Ergo spiritum sanctum non amiserat
penitus, quoad omnia dona: alioqui necita precari, nec resipiscere potuisset.

upon Psalm. 51.
but by the Spirit of grace and supplications? Which blessed sanctifying
Spirit, was all the while rooted, and resident in David's heart, by a saving
existence there; tho not so fully by an effectual operation, and exercise.
Divines, about this Point, consider; First, The infinite, free, and eternal
love and favor toward His Child; with which, whom He loves once, He loves
for ever. The gifts and calling of God; that is, as best Interpreters affirm,
the Gifts of effectual calling, effects of His free grace, are such as God
never repents of, or takes away. Secondly, His sanctifying Spirit, which He
gives unto Him. Thirdly, The habits of graces created in his heart by that
blessed Spirit, justification, regeneration, adoption. Fourthly, The feeling
exercises, and Acts of those graces, with many sweet and glorious refreshings
of spiritual joy springing thence. The three first, after we be once
Christ's, are ours for ever; Deus suorum peccatis vere iras^itur, and se eis
iratum intus terroribus, foris flagellis declarat. Tunc ergo fugit ex cord
gratiae sensus, evanescit laetitia. Interim Deus peccantes filios non penitus
abijcit, non odit, non abdicat electionis (...), sed castigationibus in viam
revocat, corrigil, reconciliationis sensum and laetitiam paulatim reddit
procantibus. Si enim nemo Pater terrenus hoc facit, ut filium graviter
delinquentem mox domo eliminet, exhaeredem faciat: quanto minus id Pater
coelestis facit filijs, quos anto iacia mundi fundamenta in Christo elegit,
adoptavit? Par. Ibid. Sect. Ad tertium.]
The last, may be suspended, and surcease for a time.

3. By way of interpretation, in the latter part of the verse, He calls the
Creating, to speak properly, is to make of nothing: But is used here
improperly, the Prophet speaks according to His own feeling, and present
judgment of Himself, as tho He had lost all, and had no goodness in
Himself. No doubt the Prophets heart was in part clean, tho not so much as
He desired. Estey. Ibid.
creation of the grace of Sanctification in his heart, a renovation, and
raising thereof to the same degree, wherein it was in former time.

4. He cries unto the Lord; Not to take His holy Spirit from Him: verse. 11.
And Et Spiritum fanctum tuum ne auferas a me] Est enim Spiritus sanctus in
confitente. Nam ad donum Spiritus sancti pertinet, qu^al. by displicet quod
fecisti. Immundo spiritui peccata placent, Sancto displicent. Quamv^^ ergo
adhuc venam depreceris, tamen ex alia part, qua tibi displicet malum, quod
commisisti Deo, coniungeris. Hoc enim and tibi displicet quod and illi, -- Nec
ait, Spiritum sanctum tuum da mibi: sed ne auseras a me. August. in Psalm. 50.
therefore that blessed spirit was not gone. It were very absurd and
incongruous, to desire the not taking away of that thing, which we have not.
He certainly has the holy Spirit, which heartily desires, He may not be
taken from Him.

David's desire then of a clean heart, did not argue, that it was utterly
unclean, and wholly turned into a lump of filth. ( Renati prorsus non

Answ. When the Article says, we may depart ^^em grace, the meaning of it is,
that the elect of God called according to purpose, may swerve from the
directions of gra^e in some particular things; and fall into grievous sins,
out of which they are to be raised by Repentance; and not, that they totally
fall from it. Doctor Field, Append. p. 1. Ad fin. page 131.132

Sanctity, and cleanness of heart is never clean extingvished in any One once
truly Sanctified; it was not in David, in Peter). But He was so earnest after
it: First, Because that little which was left, was scarce, or not at all
sensible in His spiritual distress: where the glory of the Sun has lately
been, the succession of a candles light is little worth. Secondly, And because
now He vehemently thirsts after a great deal more, then He presently had.
Learned and Rich men, think themselves not learned and rich, in respect of
what they desire. When the Sun begins to peep up, we gaze no longer at
stars. Gods comforting Spirit began a little to warm His heart again;
whereupon He grew so eager, and greedy of that heavenly heat, that He
thinks his heart Key-cold, except it ^lame to the height. That dampe and
darkness of Spirit, into which He was fallen, by reason of His grievous Fall,
had So frozen His affections with disconsolate deadnes, and heavines of heart,
that a little glimpse of spiritual life, and lightsomenesse, is presently
swallowed up, as it were, and devoured; and serves but only to Set an edge to
his desire, to whet his stomach, and stir up His appetite after a more full,
and further fruition of those comfortable graces, and woonted communion with
His God; a re-tast and return whereof, is so sweet and dear unto His Soul.

Take heed then, that you do not mistake: When I speak of a spiritual
desertion, I mean it not, either in respect of a total, or final
dereliction, and forsaking on Gods part; or a total, and final falling away
on the Saints side; to hold such an Apostasy, were a About the same time, one
Bertius, a Schole^ of the late Armimus, who was the first in our age, that
i^^ected ^ey^en with Heresy, was so impudent as to send a letter to the Arch
Bishop of Canterbury, with a Book entitled, De Apostasia Sanctorum. -- The
title whereof only were enough to make it worthy the fi^e. King James in his
declaration against Vorstius And a little after thus: What need we make any
question of the arrogance of these Heretics, or rather Atheistical Sectari^^
amongst you, when one of them at this present, remaining in your Town of
Leyden, has not only presumed to publish of late, a blasphemous Book, Of the
Apostasy of the Saints; but has besides been so impudent, as to send the
other day, a Copy thereof, as a goodly present to our Archbishop of Canterbury,
together with a Letter: wherein he is not ashamed (as also in his Book) to lie
so grossly, as to avow, that His Heresies contained in the said Book, are

fearful Apostasy: But only in respect of the exercise, and operation of
grace, of present sense, and feeling; as I said before, Spiritus Sanctus
de^ituit in Davide, cum admisit adulterium, and homicidium, sicut vita in
planta tempore hyemali. Et si suas vires non exeruit, nec tamen prorsus f^it
o^ios^s: impedijt enim quo minus David toto ani^i studio in haec incumberet
horrenda slagitia. Doctor Holland, Divinity Professor in Oxford, moderating in
this question, holden negatively. An^usti fides potest ad tempus ami^^i, aut
finaliter desincre? The Lords chosen may fall from their outward prerogatives,
and from the fruits: but that divine nature still abides in them: And it is
only with their grace, as it is with the ^inde in distempers of Melancholy and
Frenzy; with the Sun in Ecclipses; with the tree, when leaves and fruits
f^ils its with the natural life, when it mooveth not, ne yet breaths
sensibly; which in diseases of the Mother is often discerned. Their ^aith i^ a
never-failing Faith; their life an eternal life; their seed, a seed abiding

Life lies still in the root, and upon the first breaking out of the heavenly,
and healing beams upon the Soul, from the Sun of righteousness, returning in
mercy, puts forth again, and prospers. David being astonished, as they say, with
a mighty blow of temptation (As Petrus cum peccavit charitatem non amisit, quta
peccavit pot^us in veritatem quam in charitatem. -- Sic and David cum peccavit,
charitatem non peratdit, sed obstupuit quodammodo in eo charitas, ad vehementem
tentationis ictum: Et charitatis in eo nequaquam facta est abolitio, sed quasi
quaedam soporatio, quae mox ut ad vocem arguent^s Prophetae ^v gilavit,
continuo in illam ardentissimae charitatis confessionem ^rupit: Peccavi Domino.
De not. and dignit. Amoris divini. cap. 6.
Bernard resembles it), lay for a time, as it were, in a Swoune: But upon the
voice of the Prophet sounding in his ear, He awaked, and came to Himself. As
we see in heated water, the aire's blowing upon it, does recover, and reduce
it to it is former natural coldness, by the aid of that little remainder of
refrigerating power, which is originally rooted in that Element: So by the
awaking of the North wind, and coming of the South; I mean, the blessed
Spirits breathing afresh upon David's heart, Scorched dangerously with the fire
of lust, by stirring up and refreshing the retired, and radical power of
grace; that immortal Seed of God, never to be lost, did sweetly, and
graciously bring it again to it is former spiritual, comfortable temper, and
constitution.

2. Sometimes the Lord may for a time retire the light of His countenance, and
sense of His graces from His Child; that He may be driven thereby to take a
new, and more exact revise; a more serious, thorow-survay of His youthful
sins; of that dark and damned time, which He wholly spent upon the Devil;
and so put again, as it were, into the pangs of His New Birth, that Christ may
be more perfectly formed in Him: That He may again behold, with fear, and
trembling, the extreme loathsomeness, and aggravated guilt of His old
abominable lusts; and so renewing His sorrow, and repairing repentance, grow
into a further detestation of them; a more absolute divorce from His
insinuating Minion-delight; and be happily frighted afresh, and fired for ever
from the very garment spotted of the flesh, and all appearance of evil. That
upon this occasion, He may make a new inquisition, and deeper search into the
whole state of His conscience, several passages of His conversation, and every
corner of His heart; and so for the time to come, more carefully cut off all
occasions of sin; and with more resolution, and watchfulness, oppose, and
stand at staves end with every lust, passion, distraction in holy duties,
entisements to relapse, spiritual laziness, lukewarmenesse, worldliness,
etc. with greater severity to crucify our corruptions, and ever presently and
impartially, execute the law of the Spirit against the rebellions of His flesh.

This, it may seem, was one end of Jobs spiritual affliction in this kind. In
cap. 13.23. He is earnest, and importunate with God, to know, what be those
iniquities, transgressions, and sins, which had turned His face and favor from
Him; in that fearful manner, as tho He was a mere stranger, or rather, a
professed enemy unto His Majesty. And He presently apprehends the burden, and
bitterness of the iniquities of His youth: Thou writest, says He, bitter
things against me; and makes me possess the iniquities of my youth. At all
such times, when God thus hides His face from us, and leaves us to the
darkness of our own Spirits; the sins of our youth are wont to lie most
heavy upon our hearts, and exact at our hands a more special renewing,
increase, and perfecting of penitent sorrow: For Vna causa, cur de peccatis
suae pueritiae loquatur, est, quod in illa aetate vehementiores sint
cupiditates, propterea dicitur in Psalmo, Quinam diriget adolescens viam suam?
Si custodiat verbum tuun. Cur de iuvenibus potius quam de alijs sit mentio?
nempe quia natura human^, quae semper est vistosa and prava, tunc maxim
ebullit, etc. Calv. Conc. 52. in Job.
they are acted with the very strength of corruption, in the heat of
sensuality, and height of rebellion. Hence it was, that even David Himself
cries out, Psalm. 25.7.
Remember not the sins of my youth; and so does many more, many times with
much bitterness of Spirit.

It is so then, that God may deal ^hus in mercy, even with His dearest
Servants; Especially, if penitent grief, and trouble of conscience in their
conversation, were not in some good measure answerable to their former
abominable li^e, and sinful provocations; if they have been extraordinary
sinners, and but ordinary sorrowers for sin; if they were formerly furious in
the service of Satan, and now but something faint-hearted in standing on Gods
side; If heretofore they marched impetuously, like Iehu, in the pursuit of
earthly pleasures, and now creep but slowly forward in the ways of God; or if
they begin to look back again with some un-controled glances after disavowed
delights, and abandoned company, etc. I say, in such Cases, the Lord may
withdraw Himself in displeasure; leave them for a time to the terrors of their
own hearts; all their old sins may return to the eye of their consciences,
as unremitted, etc. That so their regeneration may be, as it were, regenerated;
their New Birth Newborn; their sins new sorrowed for; the hatefulness, and
horror of their youthful pollutions, more hated and abhorred. And in
conclusion (For all the work, and ways of God with His chosen, are ever in
love, and for their good), that the storm being dispersed, the comfortable
beams of divine favor may shine more amiably upon them, then ever before; and
by the effectual stirring again, and stronger influence of the Spirit,
Spiritual life, that was hid in the heart for a season, may sprout out fresh,
spring, and spread abroad more flourishingly, and fruitfully for ever
afterward.

3. Thirdly; For trial, quickening, and exercise of spiritual graces: that
they may put forth themselves with more power, improovement, and
illustriousnesse. The cold comfort of a desertion in this Case, being unto
them, as water cast upon the Smiths Forge, to make some of them especially, to
burn inwardly, as it were, in the mean time with more intention and heat;
and all afterward to break out, and flame more gloriously. There are many
gracious dispositions, and endowments in the Christians heart, which would
never see the He (meaning Christ) makes as tho He heard not (to wit, the Woman
of Canaan), that the precious graces locked up in the Cabinet of Her heart,
might be brought forth to light. Doctor Worship in his Sermon upon Mat. 15.22.
etc. page 18.
light, at least, with such eminency, were it not for this darkness. The
brightness of lamps langvish in the light, but they shine clear in the
dark: the splendor and beavty of the Stars would never appear, were there
no night. Iam. 5.11.
You have heard of the patience of Job, says James: And we read also of his
excellent Faith, when He said; Job 13.15.
Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him: But we had neither heard of, or
admired the one, or the other; had He not been afflicted both with outward
troubles, and inward terrors. It is the highest, and most Heroical Act of
Faith, and it is improov'd to the utmost, and prooved steel to the back, as
they say; Isa^ 50.1^.
Then to trust in the Name of the Lord, and to stay upon our God; when we
walk in darkness, and have no light. God is best pleased, and most honored,
when we rest upon Him, without any sensible comfort. I make no doubt, but that
admirable ejaculation of Job; Tho He slay me, etc. did hold scale in Gods
acceptance, with all those innocencies, integrities, and gracious conformities
to His holy Law; blessed fruits, I confess, of His invincible Faith
enumerated. Chap. 31. Nay, did incomparably ouer-weigh them; Abraham's believing
against hope, was far above, and of infinite more worth with God, then the
sacrifice of His Son, or all His other glorious services. It is no such great
matter, or maistery, to be confident, when we are encouraged, and hired, as
it were, with joy and peace in believing; but then to stick to Christ, and His
sure Word, when we have against us, sense and reason, flesh and blood, fears
and feeling; Heaven and Earth, and all Creatures; That is the Faith indeed;
there is it is excellency; there is the true, and orient sparkling, and
splendor of that heavenly Jewel. That prayer is truly fervent, fullest of
Spirit, and enforced with most unutterable groans, which is poured out for the
recovery of Gods pleased countenance, after it has been turned away from us
for a time. That love is most industrious and mighty, grows strong as death,
and into a most vehement ^lame; which is enkindled in the upright soul, when
Her dearest Love is departed, in respect of feeling and fruition. Oh! then she
prizeth, and praises His spiritual beauty and excellency, as one exceedingly
sick of love; and takes on extremely: As you may see, Cant. 5.10, etc. I
opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawn Himself, and was gone: My
soul failed when He spoke; I sought Him but I could not find Him; I called
Him* but He gave me no Answer: The Watchmen that went about the City found
me, they smote me, they wounded me; The Keepers of the walls took away my
veil from me: I charge you, O Daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my Beloved,
that ye tell Him, that I am sick of love. What is thy beloved, O thou fairest
among Women! What is thy Beloved more then another beloved, that thou do so
charge us! My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousands. His
head is as the most fine gold, etc. That thankfulness, which springs from a
sensible re-enjoyment of Jesus Christ, and return of the sense of the savor
of His good ointments into the soul; has far more heart and life, then the
free and full possession of all the visible glory, and outward comfort of the
whole world, could possibly put into it. That joy which makes our hearts leap
within us, upon the re-gaining of the woonted workings of grace, and our
heavenly feelings, is much more joyful, then either that, which followed the
first taste, or the after free enjoyment of them. Excellent and extraordinary
good things, tasted and lost, do beget a far greater sense of their
sweetness and comfort, upon their recovery, then if they had been either
never tasted, or never lost. That Sunshine is most fair and amiable, which
breaks out after some boisterous storm, or great Eclipse. Restitution to
sense of grace, after some despairefull sadness for Gods departure, may
produce a deeper impression of spiritual pleasure, in the recovered Patient,
then the first plantation of it. Thus does our gracious God, who when He
please, can bring light out of darkness; life out of death; something out of
nothing; Heaven out of Hell; even come nearer unto us, by departing from us. By
the dead wintertime of a spiritual desertion, He may bring, by His blessed
hand of mercy, and quickening influence, more strength, activenesse, lively
exercise, and excellency into our graces, and sweetest fruits thereof.

If Christians had not sometimes dead hearts, they would have proud hearts. Heart.
page 64.
4. Fourthly, The Christian, as he grows in knowledge, grace, spiritual
abilities, forwardnes, fruitfulnes, and further from His New Birth; except He
be very watchful over his heart, much practiced in the exercises of
humiliation, often exercised in the school of afflictions, terrified sometimes
with hideous injections, and walk humbly with his God; shall have by a sly,
and insensible insinuation, privy pride to grow upon Him; confidence in His
own strength; too much attribution to the means; a Self-conceit of an
independent standing upon his own Bottom, as it were, and by the power of his
present graces. And therefore our wise God does sometimes take a course to take
down his selfe-confidence, by withdrawing His countenance; and to humble His
spiritual presumption, with a spiritual desertion. I mean, by taking from
Him the sense of grace, and feeling of his favor; by cutting off, as it were,
for a time, those streams of comfort, which were wont to distill upon his
soul, by use, and ordinary influence of the means, Meditation, Prayer,
Conference, public Ministry, Sabbaths, Sacraments, Days of humiliation, and
such like; does mercifully force him to have recourse unto, at length, with
much longing and thirst* and to repose upon, with more reverence, and
acknowledgement, the everlasting Fountain and Founder of all graces, comforts;
compassions and life; even his own glorious, merciful, and Almighty self. See
this in the beginning of the third Chapter of the Canticles, at the latter end
of Cap. 2. The christian soul is sweetly crowned with a glorious overflowing
confluence of all spiriuall consolations; rapt extraordinarily with
un-utterable, and joyful ravishments of Spirit, upon the nearer embrace^ment
of her dearest Spouse, and more sensible grasping of refreshing graces. She
lies so peacefully in His arms of mercy, and under the Banner of His love;
that she sweetly sings unto Her self, My beloved is mine, and I am His. But
in the beginning of the third (For the days of Gods child after conversion,
are like the days of the year; Some, fair and shining; Some, tempestuous and
cloudy: Some, happy with heavenly Hony-dewes, as it were, of unspeakeable joy,
and unconceivable peace; others, more dismal and dis-astrous, if I may so
speak, for want of an amiable aspect from the Throne of graces). I say, a
little after, the case is fearfully altered with Her: For she lies struggling,
and distressed in the irksome, and comfortless desolations of a spiritual
desertion. Her Spouse is gone, the very heart, and life of all Her
lightsomnesse in this World, and the World to come. No sense now of the Savor
of His good ointments; no feeling of the assurance of His favor. Nothing left
of all that former heaven, but only a sad and woeful heart, which had been
happy. In this infull Case, She casts about for recovery of Her woonted
comfort: Assaies those means, which were accustomed to convey unto Her with
joy, fresh streams, and strength from time to time, out of the Wells of
Salvation.

1. First, she seeks her Spouse, and former refreshings of Spirit, by secret
prayer, meditation, experimental considerations, calling to Mind former
assurances of his love, reflecting upon the footsteps of a saving work,
unfeigned change, and sweet communion with Him aforetime; and other silent,
Selfe-inquisitions, and inward exercises of the heart: But she found Him not,
verse. 1.

2. Secondly, She enquires abroad, and has recourse unto godly christians;
especially such as have been most exercised, and best acquainted with trials,
temptations, and mysteries of the holy way; to see if She can get any comfort,
any new hold, and hope by their counsel, prayers, instructions, out of their
own experience: Iam. 5.16.
(For in such Cases, Gods Children may, and ought to confess their sins, and
Gods dealing with them, one unto another; and pray one for another). But she
finds none, verse. 2.

3. Thirdly, She addresses Her self, and resorts to faithful Ministers, Gods
public Agents in the Church, about the affairs of Heaven, and Salvation of
Souls; to receive from them some light, and direction to regaine Her Love: But
it will not yet be, verse. 3. No comfort comes by all, or any of these means:
No feeling of Gods favor, and former peace, for all this various and
sollicitous seeking, and pursuit. For God may sometimes, upon purpose,
restrain His quickening influence from the means; and recall, as it were, to
the Wellhead, those refreshing Rivers of comfort, which ordinarily flow through
His own holy Ordinances, as so many blessed Conduits of grace, into humble
hearts; That we may fetch them more immediately from the Fountain, the
boundless Sea of all heavenly treasures, and true peace; and so with more
humility, Sense of self-emptinesse, reverence, and praise-fulnesse, acknowledge
from whence we have them.

It was but a little that I passed from them, says the deserted Soul; But I
found Him, whom my soul loves, verse. 4. When no means would bring Him, but
that She had past through the use, and exercise of them all; and He would not
be found: He after, at length, comes upon his own compassionate accord, and
illighteneth Her dark, and disconsolate state, with the shining beams of His
glorious presence; and fills Her plentifully with joy and believing again.
That so, no use, variety, and excellency of means, but His own free mercy and
goodness, might be crowned with the glory of it:

Let every christian by the way, take notice of, and treasure up this point; it
may steed him in some spiritual extremity hereafter: God may sometimes
withdraw and delay His comfort, to draw His children through all the means:
which, when they have passed, without prevailing; He after, and immediately,
when He please, puts to His helping hand, that they may not attribute it to
the means, tho never so excellent; but to the mercies of God, the only
Wellspring, both of the first plantation, continuance, and everlastingnesse of
all spiritual graces, and true comforts in all those happy Ones, which shall
be saved.

Why does the Lord let us use all the means; and yet not find Him in them?

That we may know, He only comes when He will; nothing mooving Him, but
His own good pleasure,

5. Fifthly, The world sometimes, that mighty enemy to the Kingdom of Christ,
aided underhand by the covetous corruption of our false hearts, and the Devils
craft, (For ordinarily in all spiritual Assaults, and overthrowes, Satan is
the Bellows; the World, the Wildfire; our corruptions the Tinder, and the
precious Souls of men, those goodly Frames, which are fearfully set on fire,
and blown up) does wrestle so desperately, even with some of Christ's
Champions; that surprising their watch, cooling the fervor of their first
love, and stealing away, by little and little, their spiritual strength; it
supplants them at length, and throws them upon the earth. Whereon it labors,
might and maine, to keep them down, and doting; that so they may root in the
mud and mire thereof, with immoderation and carking; to the great disgrace of
divine pleasures; their high and excellent Calling; and so raising the spirit
of railing in unregenerate men, to cast unworthy aspersions upon the glory of
profession, for their sakes. Nay, too often by it is subtle insinuations, and
Sirens Songs, it lulls them so long upon Her lap, that they are cast into a
heavy slumber, even of carnal security. And that so deep and dangerously,
that tho the Lord Jesus, the Beloved of their Soul, cry aloud in their ears,
by the shrill and piercing sound of His spiritual Trumpetters; and by the more
immediate, and inward motions of His holy Spirit, entreat them fairly upon
all loves, for His own dear passions sake, and all those bloody sufferings,
to shake off that carnal drouzinesse, and to delight again in God; to ^et the
earth fall out of their minds, and again to mind heavenly things: Open to me
my Sister, Cant 5.2.
my Love, my Dove, my undefiled: For my head is filled with dew and my locks
with the drops of the night: yet for all this, full loath they are to leave
their Beds of ease; and therefore frame many shifts, excuses, and delays, to
pass by, and put off those compassionate calls of love, and merciful
importunities; I have put off my coat^ how shall I put it on? Verse. 3.
I have washed my feet, how shall I de^ile them? Whereupon their blessed Spouse
so unworthily repelled with such notorious unkindnesse and ingratitude,
scattering only in their hearts some sense, and glimmerings of his spiritual
sweetness and beauty; to breed the more shame and sorrow for so foul
neglect, departs from them for a time; withdrawes the life and lightsomnesse
of His gracious presence; hides, as it were, in an angry cloud, the comfortable
beams of His former favor; and so leaves them to the darkness of their own
spirits, and in the comfortless Dampe of a justly deserved desertion. That
thereby, they may be schooled to prize Jesus Christ before gold and silver;
and to prefer, as is most meet, one glimpse of His pleased face, before the
splendor of all earthly Imperial Crowns: To listen with more reverence,
cheerfulness, profit and holy greediness, to His heavenly voice, in the
ministry of the Word; and to make more dear account of godly comforts, when
they shall recover, and re-injoy them. For the purpose, We may find Cant. 5.
The christian Soul laid too soft, and lazily, upon the ^ed of case, and
earthly mindedness; and slipped into a slumber of security and self-love, verse.
2. Her wellbeloved knocks, and calls upon Her* Nay, be speaks, and entreats
upon all the terms of dearest love, and for his painful sufferings-sake, to
rise, and open unto Him. Ibid. But she most unworthily puts him off, with some
slight excuses, and delays of sloth: verse. 3. whereupon He drops into Her
heart, some taste of His sweetest ointments, to set Her affections on edge, and
eagerness after Him, verse. 4.5. And so departs, and leaves Her in Her sad and
solitary dumps, for driving away Her Dearest, by such intolerable unkindnesse,
and shameful neglect, verse 6. Which perplexity, and trouble of spirit for His
departure, begets in Her, a great deal of zeal, fervency, and patience to
follow after Him, verse. 7.8. An extraordinary admiration of His amiable
excellencies, and heavenly fairness, verse. 10, etc. And no doubt, a far
nearer embracement, and dearer esteem of Him, upon His return; and enjoyment
of a more full, blessed communion with Him, again. Cap. 6.3.

6. Sixthly, The graces of salvation, are the most precious, and worthfull
things, that ever issued out of the hands of God by creation. The dearest of
His infinite mercies, the hearts-blood of His Son, the noblest work of His
blessed Spirit, do all sweetly concur moovingly, meritoriously, efficiently
to the production of them. No mervaile then, tho it be right pleasing unto
God, that such rare, and inestimable Jewels, should be rightly prized, and
holden in highest esteem, by those that have them: That they should still
appear, and present themselves to those Souls, wherein they shine, in their
true excellency, orient fairness, and native beauty. Now privation of
excellent things has special power to raise our imaginations, to an higher
streine of estimation of them; and to cause us, at their return, to entertain
them, with much more longing, far dearer apprehensions, and embracement.
Absence, and intermission of the most desirable comforts, add a great deal of
life to the love of them, and weight of pretiousnesse to their valewation. The
goodness of whatsoever we enjoy, is better perceived by vicissitude of want,
then continual fruition. Sleep is more sweet, after the tediousness of some
wakefull, and wearysome nights: Liberty, and enjoyment of the free air, and
faces of men, after restraint and imprisonment: The glory and fairness of the
Sun, after a black day, or boisterous storm, etc. So Gods favorable aspect
is much more acceptable after an angry tempest, and hiding his face for a
season: And the graces of salvation far more amiable, and admirable to the
eye of His humbled Child, after the darkness of a spiritual desertion.
Wherefore our gracious God does many times, in great mercy and wisdom,
deprive His dearest servants, for a time of the presence of their Spouse, the
assurance of His love, and sense of those graces; that the absence thereof, may
represent the glory of such an incomparable happiness, and those heavenly
Pearls, more to the life; and discontinuance of their enjoyment, may inflame,
and affect their hearts with more holy greediness, and eager pursuit after
them; and stir up in them that height of esteem, and heat of love, which
may in some good measure, be answerable to their unvalewable excellency and
sweetness. Such dullness of heart, deadness of affections, and declination to
the World, may grow sometimes upon a good man; that He may find little more
contentment in communion with Jesus Christ, then in the prosperity of His
outward affairs; which is infinitely unworthy an Heir of Heaven. But now in
such a Case, Let God make Him but to repossesse the iniquities of His Youth,
and fight against Him with His terrors for a while; and the same Man with all
His heart, will prefer the reconciled face of God and peace of conscience,
before the Sovereignty, and sole command of all the Kingdoms upon Earth. While
we have a free, and un-interrupted recourse unto the Throne of Grace, we are
apt to under-valew, and to conceive of that mighty grace of prayer, but as of
an ordinary gift: But if once the Lord please, to leave us to that confusion,
and astonishment of Spirit, that our ejaculations do sadly rebound upon our
heavy, and un-heated hearts, without answer, or encouragement from Heaven; we
shall easily then acknowledge the Spirit, and power of prayer, to be one of
the fairest flowers in the Garland of all our graces; the very arm of God to
do Miracles for us many times, and ever to settle our troubled Souls in
sweetest peace and patience, amidst the greatest pressures and persecutions,
either of Hellish, or earthly enemies.

7. Seventhly, Jesus Christ Himself, blessed for ever, drunk full deep of
the extremity and variety of sorest sufferings, in many kinds; not only to
deliver His, from the vengeance of eternal fire; but also lovingly to learn
out of the sense of that sympathy, and self-feeling, to show Himself tender
hearted, kind, and compassionate unto them in all their extremities; and never
to suffer them to sink in any trouble or affliction; though never so full of
desperate representations, or apprehensions of impossibility to escape; or to
be tempted at any time above their power and patience. And many are the
means, and Methods, by which, He is wont to ease, and mitigate their many
painful miseries; especially, that extremest of Martyrdom. First, Sometimes
He rescues them by His own mighty, and immediate arm, out the mouth of Lions;
and pulls them, by strong hand, from between the teeth of bloody persecuting
Wolves, 2. Tim. 4.17. Secondly, Let no Christian then afflict his Soul with
any catking, or vexing forethought of fiery times. Assure thy self, if God
call thee to suffer in that kind; He will graciously give unto Thee a Martyrs
Faith, a Martyrs patience, and a Crown of Martyrdom.
Sometimes He takes away, or lessens the sting, and fury of the torment and
torturers. The fire had no force at all over the bodies of those blessed men,
Dan. 3.27. And no doubt in Queen Mary's days, of most abhorred memory, He
many times mollified, and sweetened the rage, and bitterness of those
merciless flames, for our Martyrs sakes. Thirdly, Sometimes he supports, and
supplies them with supernatural vigor, and extraordinary courage over the
smart, and rigor of the most terrible, and intolerable tortures. The heart of
that holy Proto-Martyr, Steven, was furnished, and filled with those heavenly
infusions of spiritual strength and joy; when the Heavens opening, Act 7 55.56.
He saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on His right hand; which were
gloriously transcending, and triumphant over the utmost of all corporal pain,
and Jewish cruelty. And so graciously dealt He with many other Martyrs in
succeeding ages, as we may read in Ecclesiastical Stories. Fourthly, He may
sometimes also, out of His merciful wisdom, put into their hearts such a
deal of Heaven beforehand, and ravishing comforts of the World to come; that
the excess thereof does swallow up, and devour, as it were, the bitterness
of all bodily inflictions, and sufferings of sense. Thus mercifully dealt He
with that worthy Martyr, Master Robert Glover, even when He was going toward
the Stake. He poured into His Soul upon the sudden, such overflowing Rivers
of spiritual joys; that, no doubt, they mightily abated, and quenched the
ragefull fury of those Popish flames; wherein He was sacrificed for the
Profession of the Gospel of Christ, and Gods everlasting truth. And assuredly,
that comfortable Sunshine of unexpresse-able joy, which, by the good hand of
God, was shed into Master Peacocks sorrowful heart, in the depth of His
darkness and desertion, a little before the resignation of His happy Soul
into the hands of God; did make the pangs of death, and that dreadful Passage,
a great deal less painful, and sensible; if not very lightsome and
pleasant. Now in both these men of God, a woeful spiritual dereliction, was a
fit introduction, and immediate preparative, to the effusion of such a sudden
torrent of strange exultations, and ravishments of spirit, upon their sad and
heavy hearts. Conceive the Point then thus: The Lord sometimes even in
tenderness, and love to His own dear Children, whom He designs for
extraordinary sufferings, may purposely possess them with such a Paradise of
divine pleasures, as a counter-comfort to the extremity of their pains; that,
besides their own private refreshing, and support, their courageous
insensibility, and victorious patience thereupon, may bring a great deal of
terror to their tormentors, glory to their Merciful Master, credit unto the
cause, and confusion to the enemies of grace. And that there may be an addition
of more heart, and life to such joyful elevations of spirit; and, that He may
make the excellency of that spiritual joy, proportionable to the exquisitnes
of their tortures and trouble, He may in His unsearchable wisdom make way
thereunto by a spiritual desertion. As He did in the forenamed glorious
Martyr, Master Glover. For want of the sense of the comforts of godliness for
a season, does make our Souls a thousand times more sensible of their
sweetness, upon their re-infusion.

8. Eighthly, Thus may the Lord sometimes deal with His best, and dearest
Children; even, by withdrawing the light of His countenance, leave them for a
while to these inward conflicts, and confusions of spirit; that thereby they
may be fitted, and informed with an holy experimental skill, to speak
feelingly, and fully to the hearts of their Christian Brethren, which may
afterward be tempted, and troubled, as they have been. For God is wont at all
times in His Church, so gracious is He, purposely to raise up, and single out
some special men; whom He instructs, and enables in the School of spiritual
experiments, and afflictions of Soul, with extraordinary dexterity, and Art,
to comfort and recover other Mourners in Zion, in their distresses of
consciences, stronger temptations, spiritual desertions, decaies of grace,
relapses, Eclipses of Gods face and favor, wants of former comfortable
feelings; in case of horrible thoughts, and hideous injections, darkness of
their own spirits, and such other Soule-vexations. And such a blessed
Physician, which is able to speak experimentally to a dejected sorrowful
heart, out of practice and sense in His own Soul, is far more worth, both
for a true search and discovery, and sound recovery and cure of a wounded
conscience, then an hundred mere speculative Divines. Such an One, is that One
of a thousand, spoken of by Job, which can wisely, and seasonably declare unto
His Soule-sicke Patient, the secret Tracks, and hidden Depths of Gods dealings
with afflicted spirits. Let us take instance, in those experimental abilities,
which David gained for such a purpose, by His passing through that most grievous
spiritual desertion: Psalm. 77. The Case of that Christian were most rufull,
both in His own fearful apprehension, and to the un-judicious (...) the
Beholders; who having spent a long time (...) Zealous profession of the Truth,
walking with God, and secret communion with Jesus Christ, should come to that
pass, and fall into those woeful straights of spiritual trouble: First, That
He should fear, not without extraordinary horror, lest the mercies of God
were departed from Him for ever; and that the Lord would never more be
entreated, or ever shine again with his favorable countenance upon His
confounded Soul. Secondly, that the very remembrance of God, which was wont
to crown his heart with a confluence of all desire-able contentments, should
even rent it asunder, and make it fall to pieces in His bosom, like drops of
water. Thirdly, That the pouring out of His Soul with pitiful groans, and
complaints in secret unto His God, which heretofore did set wide open unto Him,
heavenly floodgates of gracious refreshing, should now quite overwhelme His
spirit, with much distracted amazement and fear. Fourthly, That, that heart of
His, which had formerly full sweetly tasted those holy pleasures, which far
pass the comprehension of any carnal conceit, should now be so brim-full, and
damm'd up with excess of grief; that no vent, or passage should be left unto
His speech. Fifthly, And which, Me thinks, is the perfection of His misery in
this kind, that amidst all these heavy discomforts, His Soul should refuse to
be comforted. That tho the Ministers, and Men of God stand round about Him,
bring into His mind, and press upon Him the pregnant evidences, and
testimonies of His own godly life; the unchangeablenesse of Gods never-failing
mercies to His; the sweetness of His glorious Name; the sovereign power, and
mighty price of His Sons blood; the infallible, and inviolable pretiousnesse,
and truth of the promises of life, etc. Yet in the agony, and angvish of His
grieved spirit, He puts them all away from (...) none of His, nor as properly
belonging to His (...) state. He is readier out of His spiritual di^emper, to
spill, as water upon the ground, the golden vialls of the water of life, and
sovereign oils of Evangelicall joy, tendered unto Him by the Physician of His
Soul; then to receive them with woonted thirst and thankfulness, into the
bruised bosom of His bleeding Conscience. Tho they assure Him in the Word of
life and truth, having had (for that I suppose) true and sound experience of
His conversion, and former sanctified courses, from Isai. 44.22. That as the
heat, and strength of the Summers Sun, does disperse and dissolve to
nothing, a thick Mist, or foggy Cloud: so the inflamed zeal of Gods tender
love, through the bloodshed of His own only dear Son, has done away all
his offenses; His iniquity, transgression, and sin, as tho they had never
been. And Mich. 7.19. That, that God, which delights in mercy, Verse. 18. has
cast all his sins into the bottom of the Sea; never to rise again, either
in this World, or in the World to come. The Prophet alludes to the drowning of
the Egyptians in the Red Sea. And therefore they assure Him, that as that
mighty Host sunk down into the bottom, like a stone, Exodus 15.5. Or as Lead,
Verse. 10. So that neither the Sun of Heaven, nor Son of Man ever saw their
faces any more: So certainly, all his sins are so swallowed up for ever, in
the Soule-saving Sea of His Saviors blood, that they shall never more appear
before the face of God or Angel, Man or Devil, to His damnation or shame. Yet
for all this, lying in a spiritual Swoune, He finds His heart even key-cold,
and as it were, stark dead, in respect of relishing, or receiving all, or any
of these incomparable comforts. The Case thus proposed, may seem very
deplorable, and desperate: yet consider, what good David's experience might do
in such distress. What a deal of life and light were it able, to put into the
very darkest Dampe, and most heartlesse faintings of such a dying (...) have
such an One as David, even a Man after Go^^ own heart, remarkeably enriched,
and eminent with heavenly endowments; One of the highest in the Book of life,
and favor with God, to assure it, that Himself had already suffered as
grievous things in His Soul, if not greater; and passed through the very same
passions, and pressures of a troubled Spirit, if not with more variety, and
sorer pangs. That proportionably to his present perplexities, He cried out
with a most heavy heart: First, Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he
be favorable no more? Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Does his promise
fail for evermore? Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut
up His tender mercies? Verse. 7.8.9. Secondly, That when He remembered God, He
was troubled: Verse. 3. Thirdly, That when He prayed unto God, and complained,
His spirit was overwhelmed. Ibid. Fourthly, That He was so troubled, that He
could not speak: Verse. 4. Fifthly, That His Soul refused to be comforted.
Verse. 2. Which painful passages of His spiritual desertion, answer exactly
to the comfortless Case of the supposed Soule-grieved Patient. Nay, and
besides assurance of the very samenesse in apprehensions of fear, and thoughts
of horror; David also out of his own experience, and precedence, might
sweetly inform, and direct such a poor panting Soul in a comfortable way, to
come out of the Place of Dragons, and depths of sorrow; by teaching, and
telling Him the manner, and means of his rising, and recovery. Meditation of
Gods singular goodness, and extraordinary mercy to Himself, his Church and
Children aforetime, gave the first lift, as it were, to raise his drooping
Soul out of the dust. And no doubt, ever since the same consideration, by the
blessings of God, has brought again many a bruised spirit from the very Gates
of Hell, and brink of despair. In hac cogitatione non dubium est primum (...)
qui suo (...) critatem (...) mortem, (...) t^^tm con^^^^^at: and tamen receptus
est ille ia gratiam, and restitutu^. -- Postea reliqua etiam exempla
li^erationum conquirebat: u^ quod solus Noc cum sua familia servatur in
diluvio: quod p^pulus Israeliticus ingenti miraculo educitur ex-Aegypto, and
servat^^ in marirubro: quod Aaron author horrendae Idololatriae non a^ijcitur,
nec absorbetur ab ira livina: quod populus Israeliticus morae impatiens and
fremens in d^serto adversus Deum, et eius ministros, non totus consumitur in
deserto, sed tandem introducitur in terram promissam. Postremo suas quoque
liberationes* in quibus antehaec praesentiam and amorem Dei erga se
conspexerat, me^oria repetivit. Moller. In Psalm. 77. Recogitavi di^s antiquos]
Priorum tuorum, inquit, beneficiorum memoriam renotavi, cogitavique quan ta
sint a te maiores nostri beneficia consequnti, quomodo e servitute Aegyptiaca
liberati sint, quomodo mare rubrum transierint, and quomodo terram promissam
acceperint.
And in his happy per-usall of ancient times, and Gods compassions of old; it
is very probable, that ^is memory first met with Adam, a right wonderful, and
matchless Pattern of Gods rarest mercies, to a most forlorn Wretch. For He
was woefully guilty by His transgression, of casting both Himself, and all his
Sons and Daughters, from the Creation to the Worlds end, out of Paradise into
the Pit of Hell: and also of empoysoning with the cursed contagion of original
corruption, the Souls and Bodies of all that ever were, or shall be borne of
Woman, the Lord Jesus only excepted. And yet this Man, as best Divines
suppose, tho He had cast away Himself, and undone all Mankind, was received
to mercy. Let never poor Soul then, while the World lasts, upon true and
timely repentance, suffer the heinousness, and horror of His former sins,
whatsoever they have been, to hinder his hopeful access unto the Throne of
Grace, for present pardon of them all; or at any time afterward confound His
comforts, and confidence in Gods gracious Promises. Thus, no doubt, the weary
Soul of this Man of God waded further, into those bottomless Seas of mercies,
manifested, and made good from time to time upon His servants. His heavy heart
might sweetly refresh, and repose it self upon the contemplation of Gods
never-failing compassions, in not casting off Aaron everlastingly, for His fall
into most horrible Idolatry: In not suffering the murmuring, and rebellious
Jews to perish all, and utterly, in the Wilderness; considering their many
prodigious provocations and impatiencies, etc. But at length, as we may see in
the forecited Psalm, His Soul sets it triumphant Selah upon that great, and
miraculous deliverance at the Red Sea; one of the most glorious, and visible
Miracles of mercy, that ever shone from Heaven upon the Sons of Men; and also
a blessed Type of the salvation of all truly penitent and perplexed Souls from
the Hellish Phara^^ and all infernal powers, in the red Sea of our Savio^^
blood. How fairly now, and feelingly might the^e experimental instructions,
and this Passage of proof, trodden, and chalked out by this holy Man,
illighten, and conduct any, that walks in darkness, and has no comfort, out
of the like distracted horror of a spiritual desertion? Let Him in such a
Case, first cast back His eye upon Gods former manifold, merciful dealings
with Himself. If His God made His Soul of the darkest nooke of Hell, as it
were, by reason of it is sinfulness and cursednesse, as fair and beautiful,
as the brightest Sun-beame, by that sovereign blood, which gusht out of the
heart, and those precious graces, which shine upon it, from the face of His
Son, that never-setting Sun of righteousness; He will undoubtedly, in due
season, dispell all those Mists of spiritual misery, which over-shadow the
glory and comfort of it for a time. If He upheld Him by his merciful hand,
from sinking into Hell, when He was an horrible transgressour of all his Laws
with greediness and delight; He will most certainly, (Tho, perhaps, for a
small moment, He hide his face from Him) bind up His soul in the Bundle of
the living for ever; now especially when He preferres the love, and light of
His countenance before life; and would not willingly offend Him, in the least
sin, for all the World, etc. Let Him yet proceed further in David's
footsteps, and strengthen His fainting Soul with all that heavenly Manna of
richest mercy, which He has heard, read, or known to have been showred down
at any time, from the Throne of Grace, into the heavy, humble, and hungry
hearts of His afflicted hidden Ones. Let Him refresh His memory, with
consideration of David's deliverance, by this means, from deeper distress; Of
that most memorable, and triumphant resurrection, as it were, and recovery of
those three worthy Saints of God, Master Glover, Mistress Bret^ergh, Master
Peacocke, from greatest ^^tremitie in this kind, into most un-utterable
joyful exultations of spirit. And so, of others within the Register of His
observation, remembrance, and reading. But principally, and above all; Let Him
live, and die; Let Him rest, and recreate Himself for ever, with surest hold
fast, and sweetest thoughts, upon that heavenly, and healing Antitype of the
Red Sea, the precious Blood of the Lord Jesus. And let Him ground upon it, that
tho Satan with all His hellish Hosts, and utmost fury, pursue his fearful
Soul, like a Partridge in the mountains* even to the very brinke of despair,
and mouth of Hell; yet even then, when all rescue and deliverance is nearest,
to be utterly despaired of, (For it is the Crown of Gods glorious mercy to
save, when the Case seems desperate, and there is no hope of humane help, or
possibility of created power to comfort) I say, then that Soule-saving Sea of
His Saviors hearts-blood, will most certainly, and seasonably open it self
wide unto Him, as it did to those abovenamed blessed Saints; and swallow up
into victory, Hell, Death, the Grave, Damnation, the present woeful desertion,
with all other adversary power: and at length, make Him a fair and pleasant
passage, through the sweetened pangs of death, into the heavenly Canaan; which
flows with joys and pleasures, un-mixed and endless; more then either Tongue
can tell, or heart can think.

9. Ninthly, a spiritual desertion may seem a proportionable, fit, and most
proper punishment, and means to correct, and recover the Christian; which out
of infirmity and fear, deserts the Lord Jesus, and the Profession of His
blessed Truth and Gospel. If any be ashamed of Him; refuse to do, or suffer
any thing for His sake, who has given unto us His own hearts-blood; it is
most just, that in such a Case He withdraw Himself, in respect of all sense
and feeling of divine favor, and fruits of grace, or any comfortable
influence at all, upon the Consciences of such Coward^^ that so they being left
to the darkness of their own spirits; and by consequent, to the taste even
of Hellish horror for the time; they may be brought again to themselves, and
taught by such terrors to return; and become infinitely more willing to
embrace the Stake, if the times should be so cruel; and kiss the instruments
of death, then langvish any longer in the despairing extremities of such a
desertion; to acknowledge it incomparably better to pass through the temporary
bitterness of Popish fire, then to be abandoned to everlasting flames: Nay,
and that which is the greater Hell, to be robbed of, and rent from Him; in
whose glorious presence alone, is not only life, and all lightsomnesse even in
this life, but also fullness of joy, and pleasures for evermore, in the life to
come. This Point appears, and is prooved by Gods dealing with some of our
Martyrs in Qveene Mary's time:

In the Story of Tho. Whittell, first, recanting, and then repenting the same.
Thomas Whittell, a blessed Martyr of Jesus, was by the wicked suggestions of
some Popish God suffered me to faint, and fail through humane infirmity, by
the working of the Arch-enemy in His sworn Soldiers, the Bishops and Priests:
In whom so lively appears the very visage and shape of Satan, that a Man (if
it were not prejudice to Gods Word) might well affirm them to be Devils
incarnate, as I by experience do speak. Acts and Monuments, page 2019.
incarnate Devils, drawn to subscribe to their Hellish Doctrine: But
considering in cold blood, what He had done, was horribly vexed; and, as He
reports of Himself, felt Hell in his conscience, and Satan ready to devour
him. Which terrible desertion, and trouble of mind, made Him quickly return
with great constancy and fortitude, and turn a most invincible, and
un-mooveable Martyr. Hear some passages from His own Pen.

The night after I had subscribed, I was sore grieved, and for sorrow of
conscience could not sleep. For in the deliverance of my Body out of bonds,
which I might have had, I could find no joy, nor comfort; but still was in my
conscience tormented more and more, etc.

And, I said to [Harpesfield, sc.] That my Conscience had so accused me,
through the just judgment of God, and His Word; that I had felt Hell in my
Conscience, and Satan ready to devour Me: And therefore I pray you, Master
Harpsfield, (said I) let me have the Bill again, for I will not stand to it.

When the Lord had led Me to Hell in my Conscience, through the respect of His
fearful judgments against me, for my fearfulness, mistrust, and crafty
cloaking in such spiritual, and weighty matters; yet He brought me from
thence again, etc.

See also the Story of James Abbes, and The. Benbridge, Gentleman. Act. and
Monuments, page 1864.2246.

10. Tenthly, God is many times forced by their frowardness, luke-warmenesse,
worldly-mindednesse, cowardlinesse, Selfe-confidence, falling from their
first-love, and other such spiritual distempers; to visit, and exercise His
Children with variety, and sometimes, severity of crosses and corrections; as
losses in their outward state; afflictions of Body; disgraces upon their good
name; oppression by great Ones; discomforts in Wives, Neighbors, Friends,
Children, etc. upon purpose to put life, quickness, fruitfulness, and
forwardness into them; that thereby, they may be more gloriously servi^cable
to Himself; more profitable to others; and more provident to treasure up peace
unto their own Souls, against an evil Day. God humbles us* says a worth
Divine, by afflictions, and pricketh the swelling of our pride. He cutteth,
and loppeth us, to the end, we may bring forth the more fruit. He fills us
with bitterness in this life; to the end, we might long for the life to come.
For those, whom God afflicts grievously in this World, leave it with less
grief. He, who has formed us to fear Him, knows, that our prayers are
slack and cold in prosperity, as proceeding from a spirit, that is cooled by
success; and which are endited by custom. The cries, which our own will
produced, are feeble, in comparison of those, which grief expresses. Nothing
so ingenious to pray well, as sorrow; which in un instant forms the slowest
tongues to an holy eloquence; and furnishes us with sighs, which cannot be
expressed, etc. But now many times, this Physic, which pincheth only the
Body, and wastes us but in things of this World, does not so work, as He
would have it; and therefore He is constrained Nedicus est, adh^^ putrehabes
nescio quid, Clamas; Sed adbuc secat; and non tollit manum, nisi secuerit
quantum videtur. Etenim medicus crudelis est, qui exaudit hominem, and parcit
vulnera and putredini. Matres quomodo sricant in balneis ad salutem filios?
Nonne parvuli clamant inter manus earum? Illae ergo crudeles sunt, ut non
parcant, non exaudiant lachrymas? Nonne plenae sunt pretate? Et tamen clamant
pueri, and non eis parcitur. Sic and Deus noster plenus est charitate: sed

Psalm. 33.

in love, and for our good, to proceed to more sharp, and searching Medcines;
to apply more strong, and stirring Purges, which immediately vex the Soul: As
horrible, and hideous injections; A spiritual Desertion; and other
affrighting, and stinging temptations. He deals with them in this Case, as
Absalom with Ioab; when He would not come at Him by sending once, and again;
He causes his servants to set His field of barley on fire, and then there was
no need to bid him hie. When inferior miseries, and other means will not do
it; God sets, as it were, their Souls on fire with slames of horror, in one
kind or other; and then they look about them indeed, with much care, and
fear, searching and syncerity; They seek Him then with a Witness, earnestly,
and early. For afflictions of Soul are very sovereign, and have singular
efficacy, to stir, and quicken extraordinarily; to weane quite from the
world, and keep a Man close, and clinging unto God. How many, tho perhaps,
they think not so, would grow proud, worldly, Lukewarm, cold in the use of
the Ordinances, Selfe-confident, or something that they should not be; if they
were not sometimes exercised with iniections of terrible thoughts? By this
fiery dart* the Devil desires, and endeavors to destroy, and undo them
quite; But by the mercy of God, it is turned to their greater spiritual good.
It is in this Case, as it was with Him, who thrusting his enemy into the Body,
with ^ull purpose to have killed Him, lance^ the ulcer* which no Physician was
able to (...); and let out that corrupt m^tter, that would have cost Him his
life: By representation of such horror, out of Satan's cruellest malice, they
are happily kept more humble, watchful, earnest in prayer, eager after the
Means, weaned from the World, compassionate to others, etc. Hiding of Gods
face from Him, and leaving Him to the darkness of His own spirit, did put and
preserve Master John Glover in a most zealous, holy, and heavenly life for ever
after. Hear the Fox, In the Story of Master Robert Glover, and of John Glover
His Brother, page 1885.
story:

This gentleman being called by the light of the holy Spirit, to the knowledge
of the Gospel; and having received a wondrous sweet feeling of Christ's
heavenly Kingdom: His mind after that, falling a little to some cogitation of
his former affairs, belonging to His vocation, began by and by to misdoubt
himself, upon occasion of those words, Heb. 7.4 For it is impossible, etc. Upon
considerations of which words, He was so far deserted, as to be persuaded,
that He had sinned against the holy Ghost; even so much, that if He had been
in the deepest Pit of Hell, He could almost have despaired no more of His
salvation -- Being young, says Fox, I remember, I was once, or twice with
Him; whom partly by his talk^, I perceived; and partly by mine own eyes, saw
to be so worn^ and consumed, by the space of five years; that neither almost
any brooking of meat, quietness of sleep, pleasure of life; yea, and almost
no kind of senses was left in Him. -- Who in such intolerable griefs of
mind, although He neither had, nor could have any joy of His meat; yet was he
compelled to eat against His appetite, to the end, to defer the time of his
damnation, so long as He might; thinking with Himself no less, but that He
must needs be thrown into Hell, the breath being once out of the Body. Albeit
Christ, he thought, did pity his case, and was sorry for Him: yet he could
not (as He imagined) help, because of the verity of the word, which said: It
is impossible, etc. But what was the happy issue, and effect of these
extraordinary spiritual terrors, and terrible desertion? The same blessed Man
of God, who writes the Story, and was himself with the Party, tells us: Albeit
He suffered many years so sharp temptations, and strong buffetings of Satan:
yet the Lord, who graciously preserved Him all the while, not only at last did
rid Him out of all discomfort, but also framed Him thereby to such
mortification of life, as the like lightly has not been seen; In such sort as
He, being like one placed in Heaven already, and dead in this World; both in
word and meditation, led a life altogether celestial, abhor^ing in His mind
all profane doings. Thus a spiritual desertion, or some other affliction of
spirit, does that alone, many times; which variety, and a long continued
succession of ordinary outward crosses, one upon the Neck of an other, is not
able to effect. For troubles of Soul sooner take, and are of a quicker, and
stronger operation, then those which afflict the Body. The spirit of a man will
sustain his infirmity: But a wounded spirit, who can ^eare? Prove. 18.14. All
other afflictions are nothing to this; They are but flea-bitings to this fiery
Scorpion. The stoutnesse of a Man's spirit will stand under a world of outward
miseries, many times: But if the eye, which is the light of the Body, be in
darkness; how great is that darkness? If the spirit it self be crushed,
which should support the whole man, how great is the confusion? Hence it was,
that faithful David waded through a world of troubles; yet all that time, no
malice of Saul, no hatred of the Philistines, no rebellion of Absalom, no
treachery of Ahitophel, no grapling with a Lion, no fighting with a Bear, no
threatening of a vaunting Goliath, could so much discourage Him: But when at any
time, He suffered immediately in His soul, under the wrath of God, O! then
his very bones, the master-timber of His Body, are broken in pieces. He roares
all the day, and His moisture is turned into the drought of Summer. Then He
speaks thus unto God; When thou with rebukes do correct man for iniquity,
thou make his beauty to consume away like a Moath.

Thus having discovered the Cases, and Causes of spiritual Desertion; I come
now to the comforts and the Cure.

1. And let us first take notice of a double desertion: first, Passive; when
God withdrawes Himself from us: secondly, Active; when we withdraw our
selves from God. And they are both twofold: first, Temporary: and secondly,
Final.

1. Passive desertion temporary; As in David, Psalm. 77. Heman the Ezrahite,
Psalm. 88. Job. Both the Glovers. See their story, Acts and Monuments, 1885.
1891. Mistress Brettergh; Master Peacocke; And many more of Gods Children.

2. Final, In many, after a woeful, and wilful abuse of many mercies, means
of salvation, and general graces. As Saul, Judas, etc. Such as have out-stood
all opportunities and seasons of grace, and all those, Prove. 1.24.

1. Active desertion temporary; As in Solomon, etc.

2. Final; as in those, Heb. 10.

Now in the present Point, I understand only a Passive temporary Desertion.
And therefore in that Man, which is truly ingraffed into Christ by a justifying
Faith, and regenerated; who can never possibly, either forsake finally, or be
finally forsaken of God Of whom Hooker thus speaks. In his Sermon upon Habac.
1.4. Of the certainty and perpeta^y of the Faith in the Elect. In this we
know, we are not deceived, neither can we deceive you, wh^^ we teach, that
the Faith, whereby we are sanctified, cannot fail; it did not in the ^^^phet,
it shall not in you. Ibid page 6. They which are of God, do not sin, either
(...), or in any thing, any such sin, as does quite extingvish grace; (...)
Christ Jesus* because the seed of God abides in them, and do^^ thie^^ (...)
from ^^^eiving any irr^mediable wound. Their Faith, when it is at (...) weak,
(...) when it is at the weakest, so strong* that utterly it (...) ^^together,
no, not in them, who think it utterly (...). Page ^.
Blessed for ever and ever be that Mothers Child, whose Faith has made Him
the Child of God. The earth may shake; the Pillars of the World may tremble
under us; The countenance of the Heaven may be appaled: the Sun may loose his
light; the Stars their glory: But concerning the Man that trusts in God, if
the fire has proclaimed it self unable, as much as to singe an hair of His
head; If Lions, beasts, ravenous by nature, and keen with hunger, being set
to devour; have, as it were, religiously adored the very flesh of the
faithful Man; what is there in the World, that shall change His heart,
overthrow His faith, alter his affection toward God, or the affection of God
to Him? Nay and besides, since I only understand a temporary passive Desertion,
I must suppose it in Him also, who sees full well, and does acknowledge from
whence He is fallen; is very sensible of His spiritual loss; afflicted much
with the absence of the quickening, and comforting influence of grace; and
grieved at the heart-roote, that He cannot do His God service; and perform
holy duties with that life, power, and lightsomnesse, as He was wont: and
thereupon resolves to give no rest unto His discontented Soul from cries,
complaints, and groans; until Gods face and favor be turned toward Him
again; and bring with it former feelings and fruitfulness, now so highly
prized, and heartily prayed for. Tamdiu non relabimur retro, quamdiu ad priora
contendimus. August. Epist. 142.
Which blessed behavior does clearly difference Him from the Back-slider; a
truly miserable, and right woeful Creature indeed; who insensibly falls from
his forwardness, first love, intimate fellowship with the Saints, and all
lively use and exercise of the ordinances, and divine duties; and yet is never
troubled, to any purpose; neither does challenge or judge Himself for it at
all. For we are to know, that the presence of spiritual weaknesses, decaies,
and wants; and absence of due dispositions, accustomed feelings, and former
abilities of grace, only then argue a Backslider, and are evil signs of a
dangerously declining Soul; when they are willingly carried without remorse,
or taking much to heart; without any eager desire, or earnest endeavor after
more heat, and heavenly mindedness. A Christian may be without Gods gracious
presence, and comfortable exercise of grace in present feeling; and yet no
Forsaker of God, but rather left of Him for a time (His heavenly wisdom, for
some secret holy ends so disposing); while by grieving, striving, and strong
desires, He unfainedly thirsts after, and seriously pursues his former
acceptance and forwardness. Here then is comfort, God has hid his face from
thee for a season, and thou art left to the darkness, and discomforts of thine
own spirit; and thereupon art grievously dejected, thinks thy Self utterly
undone; yet take notice, that In a spiritual Desertion, properly so called,
thou do not willingly forsake God, but God forsakes Thee; Non deserit,
etiamsi deserere videatur. Non deserit etiamsi deserat. August.

Quosdam deserit, quosdam deserere videtur. Ambr. In Psalm. 118.

Deus bonos non negligit cum negligit. Nec obliviscitur sed quasi obliviscitur.
Rustin in Psalm.


or rather, as Divines truly speak, seems to forsake Thee; (For He deale^
with Thee in this Case, as a Father with His Child: who sometimes upon
purpose, still loving Him extremely, hides Himself from Him, as tho He were
quite gone; to make it discover, and manifest it is love unto Him by longing,
seeking, and crying after Him). And that for excellent ends, and ever for thy
endless comfort: first, To try, whether Thou will trust in Him, tho He slay
Thee, as Job did. Every Cock-boate can swim in a River; every Sculler sail in
a Calm: In ordinary gusts, any man of meaner skill, and lesser patience, can
steer aright, and hold up the head: But when the black tempest comes, a tenth
wave flows, One deep calls an other; when the tumultuous darkness of the
sky, the roaring of that restless Creature represents terrible things, and
Heaven and earth are blundered together, as it were* with horrible confusions;
when nature yields, spirits faint, hearts fail; then to stand upright and
unshaken; Psalm. 46.
then to say with David; I will not fear, tho the earth be removed: and tho
the mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea: Tho the waters thereof
roar, and be troubled; tho the Mountai^es shake with the swelling thereof.
Selah: I say, that^s the Man, which is found at the heart-roote indeed, and
steel to the back: and then is the invincible might, and incomparable valor
of Faith made known with a witness; who ever has Gods sure Word for the
Compass, and the Lord Jesus at the Helm. Then does this glorious grace shine,
and triumph above nature, sense, reason, worldly wisdom, the arm of flesh,
and the whole Creation. In such desperate extremities, and sorest trials, it
shows it self like the Ex ae private. and (...), d^mo. Quod nullis ictibus
cedat.
Adamant, that nothing will break; the Palma non cedit ponderi, sed quo magis
rami illius premuntur, eo assurgunt altius. Hinc apud veteres fuit victoriae
insigne, ut apparet ex Apocal. 7. v. 9. Alst.
Palm tree, that yields not to the waightiest burden; the Shoote-Anchor, that
holds, when other tacklings break; the oil, that ever over-swims the greatest
quantity of water we can pour upon it. And with this improovement of the
extraordinary power of faith, God is exceedingly well-pleased, and highly
honored. Secondly, To en-ure thee to patience, obedience, and submission to
His blessed Will in every thing, even extremest sufferings, if He so please.
Thirdly, To work in Thee, a deeper detestation of sin, and further divorce
from the world. Fourthly, To quicken, improove, and exercise some special
graces extraordinarily. Thou did hide thy face, Psalm. 30.7.8.
says David, and I was troubled. Then I cried unto Thee, O Lord, etc. Then was
the spirit of prayer put to it indeed; and so was the grace of patience,
waiting, and the like. Fifthly, To cause thee to prize more dearly, and to
keep more carefully, when it comes again, Gods glorious presence, and the
quickening influence of His grace and comfort. We never apprehend the worth,
and excellency of any thing so well, as by the want of it. The un-interrupted,
and secure enjoyment of the best things, and even those that please us best,
without vicissitude, and enter change, is wont to breed such cheapnes and
satiety, and so dulls the Souls appetite; that it is neither so affected with
their precious sweetness, nor thankfully ^^vished with the present possession
of them, as it ought. Health is then highly valewed, when sickness has made
us sensible of such a Jewel: we then relish our food extraordinarily, when
we have fasted longer then ordinary: Rest does then refresh us most, when our
bodies have been tired, and overtravelled. Sixthly, To make thee conformable in
some measure, to Christ's immeasurable spiritual sufferings. Seventhly, To
manifest, and make illustrious, His mightiness and mercy in thy deliverance,
and the power of Christ's resurrection. Psalm. 88.10.
Will thou show wonders to the Dead? says Heman. Shall the dead arise, and
praise thee? Selah. Those, whom the merciful hand of God has lifted up, out
of the depth of a spiritual desertion, will easily acknowledge it, as
omnipotent a work and wonder, as to pull out of the mouth of Hell, and raise a
dead man out of the grave. Eighthly, To represent unto thee, the difference of
thy condition in this life, and that which is to come. This is our time of
nurture, 2. Cor. 5.7. Habbak 2.4. Romans 1.17. Galat. 3.11. Heb. 10.38. Romans 8.36.
not of Inheritance. Here we walk by faith, not by sight. We live by faith,
not by feeling. In this vale of tears we are killed all the day long: But
heavenly glimpses of unspeakeable and glorious joy, and spiritual ravishments
of Soul, are Heus Don^ine Deus, ^^ra hora, and brevis mora. Sapit quidem
svavissime, sed guslatur rarissime. Bernard.
seldom and short: Their fulness, and constant fruition, is reserved for the
next life. Here we are trained, as it were, in a spiritual warfare against
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; we are exercised unto New-obedience, by
manifold crosses, troubles, and temptations: Satan is sometimes set upon us, to
afflict us with His own immediate Hellish suggestions; Sometimes our own
sins grievously affright us, with renewed representations of horror;
Sometimes our own God frowns upon us Himself, with His displeased and angry
countenance; and in love leaves us a while, to the terrors of a spiritual
desertion: He sometimes lays His visiting (...) upon our Bodies, and casts
us down (...) of sickness; Sometimes He sends heavy crosses upon our outward
States, and breaks the Staff of our prosperity; Continually, almost, He
suffers many malicious Currs to bark at us with slanders, lies, disgraceful
imputations; and all the enemies of grace, to pursue us bitterly with much
malice and disdain: Thus are we trained, and entertained in this world; Our
Crowning comes in the World to come. Ninthly, To cause thee to have recourse
with more reverence, thirst, and thankful acknowledgement to the Wellhead of
refreshings: if God once withdraw the light of His countenance, and comfortable
quickening of His Spirit; we shall find no comfort at all in any Creature, no
life in the Ordinances, no feeling of our spiritual life; and therefore we
must needs, to the ever-springing Fountain of All Sufficiency, etc. Which
blessed ends and effects, when the good hand of our God has wrought; He will
as certainly return, as ever the Sun did after the darkest Midnight; and
that with abundance of glory, and sweetness, proportionable to the former
dejection, and darkness of our spirits. The lowest ebb of a spiritual
desertion, brings the highest tide of spiritual exultation. As we may see
before in Mistress Brettergh and Master Peacocke. page 84.

2. What is the reason, thou art so sad, and sore afflicted, for the absence of
thy Beloved; and with want of the woonted gracious, and comfortable workings of
the Spirit? It is because Thou have formerly grasped the Lord Jesus sweetly,
and savingly, in the arms of thy Soul; been sensibly refreshed with the
savor of His good ointments; ravished extraordinarily with the beauty of His
Person, dearness of His blood, riches of His purchase, and glory of his
kingdom; And have heretofore holden Him, as the very life of thy Soul, and
chiefest and only treasure; ejaculating, with David, unfainedly from the
heart-roote, Psalm. 73.25.
Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is none upon Earth, that I desire,
besides Thee? (Earth is an Hell, and Heaven no Heaven, without Jesus Christ). I
say, the present grief, that thy well-beloved is now gone, argues evidently,
this former enjoyment of His gracious presence. And then build upon it, as upon
the surest Rock: Once Christ's, and His for ever. Romans 11.29.
The gifts and calling of God, are without repentance, Whom He loves once,
He loves unto the end: John 13.1. Malach. 3.6.
He is no changeling in his love; I am the Lord, faith He, I change not:
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed: Semelelectus, semper dilectus.
Once elected, ever beloved: Once Renatus non denascitur. Side Deo conceperis,
certus crit partus tuus, non erit aborsu^. August. Romans 8.38.39.
Newborn, and borne to eternity: If once the sanctifying Spirit has seizd
upon Thee for Jesus Christ, thou art made sure, and locked fast for ever, in the
arms of his love, with everlasting bars of mercy and might, from any mortal
hurt, and adversary power. Thou may then cast down the gauntlet of defiance
against the Devil, and the whole world; and take up with Paul, that victorious
challenge unto all created things: De quo sanctissimus ille vir, and alij in
Sacra Scriptura, certo considere potuit; ae ^o etiam alij sancti viri certo
confidere possunt and dehent: Ratio: quia ommum sanctorum sides codem
fundamento promissionum divinarum nititur, idemque spiritus omnes inhabitat,
licet diversa mensura. De gratia propria and remissione peccatorum, Job, David,
Paulus, certo considere potuerunt, ut est demonstratum: Decidem igitur and alij
sancti certo considere possunt, at debent. Par. adversus Bellande Iustisicat.

I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor
any other Creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of God, which
is in Christ Jesus our Lord: He may hide His face from Thee for a while; but
thou have His own sure, and inviolable Word from His own mouth. That He will
return, and with everlasting kindness have mercy on thee. He Ergo, inquam,

terrors, as tho, in thy present apprehension, thou were a lost Man: But He
never will; He cannot possibly forsake thee finally. I have Vt fides certius

the mean time, thy former feelings of the motions of the Spirit and grace, do
give clear evidence, and assurance, that spiritual life is still Accidit

resident in thy Soul; tho run, as it were, into the root, and tho it is
more lively operations, and effects be suspended for a time. Mulier foetum

The Woman, that has once felt the Child stir in Her womb, is most assured,
that she is with-Child; that an immortal Soul, and natural life, is infused
into it by the omnipotent hand of God, though at other times, she perceive no
motion at all: It is so in the present Point. And thy grieving also, groaning,
and panting after Christ, is an unanswerable argument, that thou art alive
spiritually. Lay the weight of the whole world upon a man, that is stark dead,
and He can neither stir, cry, or complain.

3. Consider that some graces are more substantial in themselves, more
profitable to us, and of greater necessity for salvation; as Faith,
repentance, love, New-obedience, active and passive; Self-denial, vileness
in our own eyes, humble walking with God, etc. Others are not so, or
absolutely, necessary, but accompany a saving state, as separable accidents; as
joy and peace in believing, sensible comfort in the holy Ghost, comfortable
feelings of Gods favor, rejoicing in hope, a lively freedom in prayer, Of
which, see my Directions for a more comfortable walking with God, page 319.

inhabitans, 1. Cor. 3.16. Fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam, Ioh 4.14.
Ames. Coron. Art. 5. Cap. 1.
etc. And from hence may thou take comfort in two respects: First, Desertion
deprives thee only of these comfortable accessar^es; but thou art still possessed
of the Principal, and substantialls of salvation: Of which, not the utmost
concurrence of all hellish, and earthly rage, can possibly rob thee; And
therefore thou art well enough in the mean time, and as safe, as safety it
self can make thee. 2. Secondly, Loss of these less principal graces (which
by accident, is a singular advantage and gain) drives thee nearer unto Jesus
Christ, at least, by many unutterable groans; every one whereof, is a strong
cry in the ears of God; and causes thee, better to prise, and plie; to
exercise, and improove more fruitfully, those other more necessary graces,
without which thou can not be saved. It is a wise, and honest passage in
Mistress Iuxons Monument; page 60. She continued faithful to the end, in the
most substantial graces. For howsoever she mourned for the want of that
degree of joy, which she had felt in former times; yet she continued in
repentance; in the practice of holiness, and righteousness; in a tender love
of God, and to his Word, and Children; in holy zeal, and fruitfulness, even
to the last period of her days. And indeed, her want of full joy was so
sanctified unto her, that it was a furtherance to a better grace; namely, to
repentance, and self-denial, and base esteem of her self. And I call
repentance* a better grace then joy, because, howsoever joy, is a most
excellent gift of the Spirit; yet unto us, repentance is more profitable. For I
make no question, but that a mourning Christian may be saved without ravishing
joy; and that Christ may wipe away his his tears in heaven: but no Christian
shall be saved without repentance, and self-denial. For instance: The
darkness of our Spirits in spiritual desertions, sets our Faith on work
extraordinarily. In such a Case, it has recourse with more love, and longing
to all the fountains of life. The Person and Passion of Christ; all the
Promises; Gods free grace; His sweet Name, and survaies them more seriously;
searches and sounds them to the bottom; that by some means, at least, it may
subsist, and hold up the head in such an evil time, and amongst so many
terrors, and boisterous tempests. It is now put to the improvement, of the
very utmost of all it is heavenly vigor and valor; and enforced to put forth
it is highest, and most heroical Act; even to cleave fast to the sure Word of
God, against all sense and feeling; against all terrors, tricks of Satan, and
temptations to the contrary. And by this extraordinary exercise and wrestling,
it is notably strengthened, and steeled for the time to come. For as sloth,
idleness, and want of exercise, does much emasculate, and make our bodies more
unactive, and unable; but hard-ship, agitation and employment, does much
quicken, and fortify them: So it is in the present Point. Without oppositions
and assault, Faith langvisheth, and lies hid; but when storms, and spiritual
troubles are toward, it stirs up it self; gathers it is strength, and forces
together: casts about for subsidiary assistance by prayer, Ministerial
counsel, meditation upon special promises for the purpose; experimental
recounting former deliverances, mercies, and favors upon our selves, and
others, etc. And so becomes far more excellent and victorious, for future
incounters. It furthers also Repentance: In respect of, first, Sight of sins.
For through the glass of spiritual Affliction we see more, and them more
monstrously vile. The clouds of inward trouble especially, unite, as it were,
and collect the sight of our souls; and so represent our sins more to the
life, and in their true colors: where as the glistering of prosperity, is wont
to disperse and dazzle it. Secondly, Of sense; we are then more apprehensive of
divine wrath, and weight of sin; when we are terrified, but with a taste of
those immeasurable Seaes of bitterness, and terror, which it infinitely
merits at the hands of God. Thirdly, Of hatred and opposition; we then grow
into a more hearty loathing of that sweet meat, which we are too apt to tumble
into our mouth, Job 20.1^.
and hide under our tongue; when we feel it accompanied with such sower
sauce, and turned into gall and gravel within us. We shall afterward be
far more watchful, and afraid to give entertainment, or warmth in our
bosoms to those Vipers, which have so bitten and stung us. It makes
Self-denial more resolute and through. For the dearest and most desirable
things of this life, compared with Christ, were never viler dung in our
esteem, then at such a time. We then find that most true; That tho all the
Stars shine never so bright, yet it is still night, because the Sun is
gone; But the alone presence of that Prince of light, creates a comfortable and
glorious day; though never a Star appear. So, let us enjoy the Lord Jesus;
and no matter, tho all the creatures in the World be turned into Bears, or
Devils about us; But if he withdraw himself; and the light of his countenance
set out of our sight; the confluence of all the comforts, the whole Creation
can afford, will do us no good at all. It quickneth notably our New-obedience.
In respect of, first, Holiness toward God, and reverent heavenly behavior
about the first Table. A general taste and trial whereof, we may take, by
comparing Mariners in a storm, and arrived in the Haven; Chrysostomus alicubi
docet; Satius esse long in carcere detineri obscurissimo, teterrimo; quam in
Theatris versari. Quispiam saepe ingreditur carcerem superbus, exit demisso
animo; ingreditur suribundus, exit mansuetus; ingreditur delicatus, exit
patiens miseriarum, etc. Versa vice, se res babet in Theatris: Ingrederis
modestus, exis lascivus; ingrederis mitis, exis in furorem proiectus and
tragoedias; ingrederis animo moderato and virili, exis dissolatus in delicias
and vanitates, etc. I am sure I retain Chrysostomes sense.
Prisons with Theaters; Burialls with Banquets; Beds of sickness, and
expectation of death, with strength of youth, and prosperous health; and, which
is punctual for my purpose, fits of temptation, with times of spiritual
welfare. For as in the one state, we may observe too much presumption, and
putting far from us the evil day, forgetfulness of God, security, and
sloth: so in the other, Trouble, danger and distress, much alter the Case. We
shall then see them, bitterly bewayling their former sins; trembling in the
dust, seeking early Gods face and favor; falling to prayer; vowing better
obedience; and promising, upon deliverance, much holiness, and a happy change.
What mighty groans of spirit proceed from the deserted, in such a Case, which
are the strongest prayers, tho in that agony they falsely complain, that they
cannot pray? How greedy are they of godly conference, counsel and comfort out
of the Word, days of humiliation, of the most searching Sermons, godliest
company, presence and prayers of the precisest Ministers? How fearful are
they, to hear any worldly talk upon the Lords day? How sensible of the least
sin, any dishonor of God, and all appearance of evil? In a word; how busy
are they about that One necessary thing? Secondly, Of compassionatenesse
toward others. Selfe-sufferings soften men's hearts toward their Brethren:
Personal miseries makes them pitiful, and painful to afford all possible
help in times of distress. Experience of our own weaknesses, wants, danger
to sink under the waves of Gods wrath, and dis-ability to subsist by our
selves, begets a sweet mildness, and gentle behavior toward our neighbors;
whose assistance, visitation and prayers we now see, we stand in need of in
extremities, and evil times. Prosperity is apt of it self, to produce
scornefulnesse, insolency, selfe-confidence, and contempt of others; But Gods
hand upon us, especially in afflictions of Soul, teaches us another lesson;
to wit, how frail, weak, and unworthie we are. Thirdly, Of selfe-knowledge.
In times of peace and calmness, looking through the false spectacles of
self-love and conceitednesse, we are ready to over-weene, and out-prize our
gifts; to mistake shadows, for substances; smallest Mites of virtues, for
richest talents; the infant beginnings of grace, for tallnesse in Christ: But
remove these deceiving glasses, and let the touchstone of some sorer trial
represent our selves unto our selves; and we shall more clearly see our
spiritual abilities, in their true nature and proportion. Then all unsound
semblances of selfe-conceited sufficiencies, and former flourishes of unhumble
assurance (which like gilded Papers, or Posts, showing gloriously in the
Sunshine, and seeming pure gold in outward appearance) will vanish quite away,
and come to nothing in the fire of spiritual afflictions. Then the weakness
of our, too much vaunted of, Christian valor, will be discovered unto us, and
acknowledged of us; when we are put to wrestle with the wrath of God, and left
to the horror of some hideous temptation.

4. Hear Master Hooker, a man of great learning, and very sound in this point:
(I vary some words, but keep the sense entire) Happier a great deal is that
man's Case, whose soul by inward desolation is humbled, then he, whose heart
is, through abundance of spiritual delight, lifted up, and exalted above
measure. Better is it sometimes to go down into the pit with him, who
beholding darkness, and bewailing the loss of inward joy and consolation,
cries from the bottom of the lowest hell; My God, My God, why have thou
forsaken me? Then continually to walk arm in arm with Angels; to sit, as it
were, in Abraham's bosom; and to have no thought or cogitation, but of peace,
and blessing himself in the singularity of assurance above other men; to say,
I desire no other bliss, but only duration of my present comfortable feelings,
and fruition of God: I want nothing, but even thrusting into heaven; and the
like. For in the height of spiritual ravishments, thou art in great Pares esse
possunt in charitate coram Deo: and ille qui spirituali consolatione
per^unditur, and ille, ^ui ea privatur. Imo si dili^enter pensetur, magis
pericli tari poterit, qui devotionis dulcedine fruitur, quam is cui haec
denegatur. Ratio. Quia si consolatione hui^smodi fungens de gratia tali

The joy which I feel in my conscience is incredible) did arise in Master

Mistress Bretterghs wonderful rejoicing followed immediately, upon her return
out of a roaring wilderness, as she called it. What large effusions of the
Spirit, and overflowing rivers of heavenly peace, were plentifully showred
down upon Robert Glovers troubled spirit, after the heaviest night, in all
likelihood, that ever he had in this world, by reason of a grievous Desertion?

among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of his servant, that
walks in darkness, and has no light? Let him trust in the Name of the
Lord, and stay upon his God. Whence we may draw a double comfort in time of
Desertion: first, Because in thy present apprehension, thou finds, and feels
thy self in darkness, and to have no light; thou art ready thereupon to
conceive, and conclude un-necessarily against thy own soul, that Gods favor,
Jesus Christ, grace, salvation, and all, are gone for ever. And this is the
most cutting sting, and sorest pang, which grievously afflicts, and rents the
heart in pieces with restless angvish in such Cases. Out of what depth of
horror, do you think, did these heavy groans, and almost, if not

in the sense I have said, are much deceived, and extremely wrong their own
souls in such extremities; not considering, that their walking in darkness,
and having no light, may most certainly consist with a saving estate, and a
Being in Gods favor, tho for the present not perceived. Which appears
plainly by the quoted place: Wherein, He that walks in darkness, and has
no light, is such an one as fears the Lord, and obeys the voice of his
servant. Now the fear of God, and obedience to the Ministry, are evident
marks of a gracious man. Hence it is, that when the servants of God are
something come again unto themselves, they see* and censure their own
unadvisednesse in that respect; disavow, and disclaim all terms tending that
way, which they let hastily fall from them, in heat of temptation. And I said,
faith David, this is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right
hand of the most High. Ibid.
Truly, said Master Peacocke, my heart and soul have been far led, and deeply
troubled with temptations, and stings of conscience; but I thank God, they are
eased in good measure. Wherefore I desire, that I be not branded with the note
of a forlorn reprobate. Such questions, Oppositions, and all tending thereto,
I renounce. Here then is a great deal of comfort, in the greatest darkness
of a spiritual desertion: for we may assure our selves, that God by his
blessed Spirit has a secret influence, and saving work upon the soul of his
Child; when there is no light, or feeling of his favor at all. The Sun, we
know, tho he leaves his light upon the face of the earth, yet notwithstanding,
descends by a real effectual influence into the bosom, and darkest bowels
thereof; and there exercises a most excellent work, in begetting metals,
Gold, Silver, and other precious things. It is proportionably so in the present
Point. A poor soul may lie grovelling in the dust, afflicted, tossed with
tempest, and in present apprehension, have no comfort; and yet blessedly
partake still of the sweet influence of Gods everlasting love, of a secret
saving work of grace, and almighty support of the sanctifying Spirit. Let us
look upon the Lord Jesus himself: See Doctor Andrews Sermon upon this Text:
Behold and see, if there be any sorrow like my sorrow. And that nothing might
be wanting to make his sorrows beyond measure sorrowful, his Father withdrew
from him that solace he was wont to find in God. Field of the Church, lib. 5.
cap. 18.

His Father, by divine dispensation, showing no comfort. Maxey of Christ's Agony.


His holy soul, though he was Lord of Heaven and Earth, upon the Cross, was
even as a scorched heath-ground, without so much, as any drop of deaw of
comfort, either from Heaven or Earth; and yet at the same time, he was
gloriously sustained by an omnipotent influence: And God was never nearer unto
Him, than then; neither He, ever so obedient unto God. And I make no doubt,
but that the judicious eye of the well-experienced Physician, may many times
easily observe it, in those troubled, tempted and deserted souls, which they
deal, and converse with, for recovery and cure. This secret and saving
influence (I speak of) might be evidently discerned in Master Peacocke, even
at the worst. Some reverend Ministers standing by his bed of sorrow, asked him,
if they should pray for him: Mark well his answer, Take not the Name of God in
vain (said he) by praying for a Reprobate. Which words well weighed, seem to
imply, and represent clearly to a spiritual discerning judgment, some good
measure, even of the highest degree of divine love; preferring the glory of
God, before the welfare of his own soul; rather willing to have the means
of his salvation neglected, then the Lord dishonored, One asking another time;
whether he loved such an One, meaning a godly man: Yes, says he. Why? For
his goodness. Another coming to him upon the Lords day, willed him to put his
hand to a note of certain debts: This is not a day for that, said he. And at
the same time, he would hardly suffer any to stay with him from the Sermon.
Being told of suffering plasters out of Gods Word, to rest upon his wounded
soul; He brake out thus: Oh! if I had. Oh! if it would please God. I had
rather then any thing in this, or other three thousand Worlds! By these we may

not night: so there is something in a Christian under a Cloud, whereby He may
be discerned to be a true Believer, and not an Hypocrite. There is no mere
darkness in the state of Grace, but some beam of light, whereby the Kingdom
of darkness wholly prevails not. Do^tor Si^bes Bruised Reed, page 101.
see, and other passages to the same purpose; that our blessed God had a secret
working, and saving influence upon his soul, even in the depth and hideous
darkness of his most grievous desertion. Here is love, first, unto God in a
high degree; secondly, dear affection unto his Children, and that for his
Image shining in them; thirdly, love unto his Sabbaths, and salvation of
others; fourthly, vehement desires after grace and Gods favor. All which, were
undeniable demonstrations of an undamned state, to every understanding eye.
Nay, unquestionable arguments of spiritual life, and designation to eternal
bliss. Whereupon, my resolution was then, and protestation, upon good ground:
That if all the powerful eloquence, which rested with in the reverent bosom
of mine own dear Mother, the famous University of Oxford, managed by the
S^raphicall tongue of the highest, and most glorious Angel in heaven, had been
industriously set on work for that purpose; except I had heard my blessed
Redeemer say, I will rend a member from my Body, and throw it away; The holy
Spirit say, I will pull my seal from that Soul, which I have savingly
sanctified; my gracious and merciful Father say, I will this once fail, and
forsake One of mine; I could never have been possibly persuaded, that, that
soul of his, so richly laden with heavenly treasure, and gifts of God, (...).
never to be repented of; so syncerely exercised in the ways of God, and
opposition to the corruption of the times, etc. should possibly perish! 2.
Secondly, suppose thou should walk in darkness and have no light, in the
sense of the Prophet, for the residue and remainder of thy few and evil days
in this vale of tears; nay, and dye so, before comfort comes; yet be not
discomforted. For fearing God, and being uprighthearted, thy Soul shall most
certainly be preserved in spiritual and eternal safety, by staying upon thy
God; tho thou be without any sense of joy, and peace in believing. This life,
tho never so long, is but a moment to the life to come: But the kindness is
everlasting, with which he will have mercy on thee. Thy sufferings are but
short, whatsoever they be; But thou have eternity of joys in the World above;
purchased and prepared for thee, by the hearts-blood of that blessed Savior of
thine, upon whom thy soul relies. It is the Devils policy, say Divines, to
procure for his slaves, all the favors, honors, and advancements; all the
prosperities and pleasures he can possibly; lest if he should not follow, and
fulfill their humors this way, they might think upon seeking after, and
serving a new Master: No^ caring to vex, or molest them in this World; because
he knows full well, he shall have time enough hereafter to torment them in
Hell. And wilt not thou contrarily, be content, if God so please, to pass
through this vale of tears, even with Hemans horror: Psalm. 88.15. Since Heaven
is so near at hand, and thou have a little before thee, an everlasting time,
to row in the bottomless, and boundless Ocean of all glory and bliss; in an
endless variety of new and fresh delights, infinitely excellent and sweet,
above the largest created conceit?

6. Let us suppose a Christian in these three states: (And it is no uncouth
thing to those who observe, or feel Gods secret, and unsearchable dealings
with his Children).

1. First, in a fair and comfortable calm, and Sunshine, after the
tempestuous troubles, and travail in the pangs of the New Birth: when the
light of Gods countenance; the first refreshing warmth of his sanctifying
Spirit; the fresh sweetness and vital stirrings of grace; the ravishing
consciousnesse of his happy conversion, do fill his soul, as with marrow and
fatness; and feed it with a kindly, and more lively disposition to all good
and godly duties. 2. Secondly, in a spiritual Desertion; when the sense of
Gods favor, love, and woonted presence; the comfortable use, and exercise of
the Ordinances, graces and spiritual affairs langvish; and leave him for a
time. 3. Thirdly, In the state of recovery, and restitution from such a
fearful Dampe, and deprivation of divine comfort, unto former joyful
feelings, and re-enjoyment of his Beloved; so that his revived soul may
sweetly sing, My Beloved is mine, and I am his. Now, I doubt not, But that the
middle of these three estates, being accompanied with hearty grief, and
groans for Christ's absence; restless pantings, and longings after a new
resurrection, as it were, of the sensible, and fruitful operations of grace;
renewed desires and endeavors, for regainement of accustomed surer hold, by
the hand of Faith; patient, and praierfull waiting for the return of Gods
pleased face, etc. is as pleasing and dear, if not Aridus and spiritualis

more, to our merciful Father, as either of the other two. Do you not think,
that the Fathers of our flesh are as lovingly affected, and meltingly moved,
to hear the obedient Child sigh and sob, cry out and complain, because they
look not kindly upon him; but for trial of his affection, have hid for a
time, the much desired beams of their fatherly favor, under some affected
angry frowns; as when things are carried more currently, and comfortably
betwixt them, without any great distaste, and coffeehouse, or occasion to

same love, with which he loves the Lord Jesus himself, surpass as far in
affectionate compassion toward us, in the like Case, as an Almighty God does a
mortal Man? He cannot choose; because the word is already gone out of his
mouth; Like as a Father pittieth his Child: so the Lord pittieth them that
fear him. Psa. 103.13. I am persuaded, Gods bowels of compassionate
tender-heartednesse and love, did yearne within him toward Job, with more
dearness and delight, at that cry, Job 13.15.
Tho he slay me, yet will I trust in him; then at any time else, even in the
Spring of his spiritual prosperity, or fullest tide of most heavenly feelings.
Here then is comfort, more then thy heart can hold, if thou will be counseled
by the Prophets, that thou may prosper. For when thou think, that all is
gone, that thou art a lost man, and utterly forsaken; even in the depth of thy
spiritual darkness, (thou being so spiritually disposed, as I have said, and
which thou can not deny) I say, even then, (and thou ought so to apprehend
and believe) the love of God is, as it were, doubled toward thee, much more
endeared, by reason of thy distress; and cannot hold, but breaks out many
times into extraordinary pangs, and expressions thereof: As we may see, Isa.
54.11. Oh! thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, etc. And

super-abundantly perform, in the best time. Behold, I will lay thy stones with

the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be
exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: For the LORD is a God of judgment.
Blessed are all they that wait for him, Isa. 30.18. Retiring the effects, and
exercise of our love, from him whom we love dearly, makes it return with
redoubled fervor into our own bosoms; and there grows into a more vehement
flame, which never rests, until it break out again with dearer pangs upon
the beloved Party. Even as when the Sun suffers an Eclipse, and it is beams

between it and our sight, so that they shine not upon us; then is the Or at
least, vertuall power of heating.
heat, and light thereof, multiplied, and much intended toward the Fountain;
which afterward is shed down upon us again more amiably and acceptably, when
the darkness is done. And let us further take notice, that Christ, our eldest
Brother, blessed for ever, deals with us in such Cases, as Joseph, a type of
him in many At first, Joseph was strange, and rough unto his Brethren, to make
them remember their fault: But in the mean time he gave them food without
money, and afterward comforted them, Genesis 42. So at the first does Christ, by
touch of Conscience, without feeling of assurance of mercy, at an instant
humble us: But in the mean time, be in love gives us secret grace freely,
that we despair not, till we get the feeling of sol^d comfor^. 2. Cor. 1.3

respects, dealt with his brethren: he frowned upon them, handled them
roughly, and frighted them extremely; only, to humble them thoroughly; but in
the mean time, and midst of his menacing carriage, his heart was so full of
natural affection, that he was enforced, by the excess thereof, to turn
aside and weep, and so return to them again. And he turned himself about
from them and wept, and returned to them again, Genesis 42.24. So the Son of
God, as well as God the Father through him, tho sometimes in a little wrath he
hide his face from us; yet as he will certainly, after a small moment, gather
us with great mercies; so in the mean time, He is afflicted, and most
tenderly affected toward us in all our afflictions. See Isa. 63.9.

7. Seventhly, Think it not strange, that thou art fallen into this kind of
spiritual affliction, as tho some strange thing, or that which does, or may
not befall the dearest servants of God, had happened unto thee. For herein thou
becomes conformable to as holy Men, as ever the world had; Job, David, Heman,

Luther, etc. Nay, to the Son of God himself; From whose example and
precedence, let the Christian, even in the darkest horror of a spiritual
desertion, when he is afraid, lest God has forsaken him, fetch abundance of
comfort, and support out of such considerations as these:

1. Christ himself was in the same Case: Besides a numberless variety of most
barbarous cruelties, inflicted upon his blessed body, by the merciless, and
implacable malice, of the Jews; and, by consequent, sympathy upon his glorious
soul; He suffered also Nos non tantum poenas corporeas eramus commeriti:

in soul immediately, intolerable, and (save by himself) unconquerable
torments and pain. He grapled with the fiercest wrath of his Father for our
sins; and sweat blood, under the sense of his angry countenance: Nay, this
Cross upon his soul, infinitely more weighty, then that which he carried
upon his shoulders toward Calvarie, did not only cause streams of great
bloody drops to fall down to the ground; but also pressed from him, that heavy
groan, Mat. 26.38. My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: and that
last rufull bitter cry: My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me, cap. 27.46.
If Christ Jesus himself then, blessed for ever, the (...), Col. 1.13.
Son of the Fathers love, the Prince of glory; Nay, the glory of heaven and
earth, the brightness of everlasting light, etc. In whom he professes
himself to be well-pleased, and for whose sake only he loves all the sons
of Men, which shall be saved; was thus plunged into a matchless Depth of
unknown sorrows, and most grievous desertion; Let no Christian cry out in the
like spiritual desolation (but ever immeasurably short of his) and in his
fear of being forsaken, that his Case is singular, desperate, irrecoverable:
For the only, dear, innocent Son of God, was far worse in this respect,
and in greater extremity, then he is, can, or ever shall be.

2. Secondly, Amongst other ends, for which the Lord Jesus drunk so deep, and
the very dregs of that bitterest Cup of his dearest Fathers heaviest
indignation, this was one: That by a particular, and personal passing through
that infinite Sea, those extremest dreadful horrors of divine wrath for Iram

fear, and feeling of that bitter and bloody Agony, which melted, as it were,
his blessed soul into that mournful Cry: My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me! (The comfortable influence of the Deity, being for the time in
Christ was not forsaken any of these four ways: First, The essence of the
Godhead was never severed, or excluded from Christ the Man, but it dwelt in
him at all times fully, Coloss. 2.9. Secondly, the personal union of the two
Natures was never dissolved: and so the person of the Son never forsook the
humanity of Christ. Thirdly, the power of the Godhead also was always present
with him, enabling him to bear the full vial of Gods wrath. Fourthly, The
gracious assistance of Gods Spirit was never wanting, inabling Christ without
the least impatiency, distrust, etc. to bear, whatsoever was inflicted upon
him for our sins: But he was forsaken, First, Positively; In that God the
Father poured upon him the infinite Sea of his wrath, which he now felt.
Secondly, Privatively: In that he was berest, and forsaken of all comfortable
presence; the Godhead for a season, shadowing it self under the Cloud of Gods
wrath, that the Manhood of Christ might feel the intolerable burden thereof:
And thus Christ being destitute of consolation, complains that he was
forsaken. But Christ being thus forsaken, he sustained the wrath of God,
strived with it, and subdued it; that is, He delivered both himself and us from
it, and so perfectly finished the work of our Redemption. The bright Morning
Star, page 51, etc.
some sort restrained, and retired from the humane nature; that it might be
capable, and sensible of that anger and angvish, which would have holden both
Men and Angels, and all created Natures under everlasting calamity and woe). I
say, that by his own sense, and experience of such painful passages, he
might learn, and know with a more fellow-feeling, and pitiful heart, to
commiserate his poor afflicted Ones in their spiritual desertions; and with a
softer, and more compassionate hand, to bind up their bleeding souls, with his
sweetest Balm of tender-heartednesse and love; when in such horrible 1. Deus

depths, they shall thirst, and long, and gasp for drops of mercy, and his
Fathers pleased face. For in that he himself has suffered, being tempted;
he is able to succor them, that are tempted, Heb. 2.18. A woman, which has
her self with extraordinary torture, tasted the exquisite pains of
Childe-birth, is wont to be a great deal more tenderly, and mercifully
affected to an other in like case; then she, that never tried, what it is to be
terrified with the suddenness, un-avoidablenes, and terrible pangs of a woman's
travail; and is more skillful, ready, and forward to relieve in such
distress. And so also all others, who have been most afflicted, either with
outward troubles, or inward terrors, or both; are ever most fit, and feeling,
to speak unto the heart; to put to their helping hand; and make much of
comfortless and miserable men, troubled, and tempted, as they have been. And
such was the Case of our blessed Savior in his sufferings for our sakes. He
was exercised all his life long with variety, and extremity of cruelties,
indignities, and all manner of vexations, beyond measure, grievous, bitter, and
intolerable. He drunk full deep of the Worlds disgrace; the Devils malice;
the rage of great Ones; the contempt, and contumelies of the vilest; the
scornful insultations of his enemies; sorest sufferings, from all things in
Heaven, Earth, and Hell: Of those pinching passions, hunger, thirst,
weariness; of bodily tortures, hideous temptations, agonies of Spirit; Could
he endure the scorching flames of the wrath of his Father, the curse of our
sins, those tortures of Body, those horrors of Soul; and does he now
shrink at his thirst? No, no, etc. The now Bishop of Exe^er in his
Passion-Sermon, page 12

measured out unto him, ere he touched this Potion: this Cup was full; and he
knew that it must be wring'd* not a drop left. Idem. Ibid. page 51.
horrors of soul, for our sins, to the very last drop; which went as far
beyond his other outward extremities, as the Soul goes beyond the body; Gods
utmost anger, the malice of men: Whereby he is now blessedly fitted, and
enabled excellently to succor them that are tempted. Consciousnesse of his
own Case in the days of his flesh, is a keen incentive to his holy, and
heavenly soul, more sensibly and soon, to take pity upon, and ease the
several necessities, troubles, sorrows, and soule-afflictions of all his
Children.

3. Thirdly, As this ever-blessed Redeemer of ours, was in himself more then
infinitely free, and more then far enough from all sin; so by consequent,
from any inherent cause of the least cross; or any shadow in the World, of his
dearest Fathers displeased countenance. For originally, He was of a most pure,
harmless, and holy nature; all his life long, kind, sweet, and gracious to
every Creature; offending none, doing good unto all; In his death, incomparably
patient, brought as an innocent Lamb to that bloody slaughter; not opening his
mouth, for all those base, and barbarous provocations of the cruel, and
merciless Miscreants about him; swimming in blood, burning in zeal, wrestling
in prayer, even for the salvation of his enemies. So that his guiltless, and
unspotted soul had no need at all of any passion, or expiation. All his
sorrows and sufferings, were voluntarily under-gone, only for our sakes, and
sins. Had not the precious hearts-blood of the only, dear, natural,
eternal Son of God, been poured out as water upon the ground; where at the
whole Creation was astonished; the Earth trembled and shook, her Rocks clave
asunder, her Graves opened; the Heavens withdrew their light, as not daring to
behold this sad and fearful spectacle; never had the soul of any son or
daughter of Adam been saved. It was not the glory and treasures of the whole
Earth, not any streaming sacrifices of purest Gold, not the life of Men and
Angels; no not the power, and prostration of all the Creatures in Heaven and
Earth, or of ten thousand Worlds besides, could have prevailed, satisfied, and
served the turn in this Case. Either the Heir of all things must die, or we
had all been damned. Is the heart then of any Mourner in Zion heavy, and ready
to break for sorrow; because he has lost the light of Gods face, feeling of
his love, and consolations of grace? So that the darkness of his Spirit
thereupon, frights him with re-possession of his pardoned sins, temptations
to despair, and fears, lest he be forsaken: O then let him hie, and have
speedy recourse unto this heavenly Cordial: when our Lord, and our Love felt
the curse of our sins, and his Fathers hottest wrath coming upon him in the
Garden; without any outward violence at all, only out of the pain of his own
thoughts; bled through the flesh and skin, not some faint deaw, but even solid
drops of blood; and afterward in the bitterness of his soul, cried out upon
the cross, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? And none of all this
for himself; For no stain at all did cleave to his sacred soul; But all
this, (the least of That, what the infinite sins of almost infinite men,
committed against an infinite Majesty, deserved in infinite continuance; all
this in the short time of his Passion did he sustain. Ibid p. 43.
which, we can no more express, then we could undergo) for thy sake and
salvation, alone, who loves our Lord Jesus Christ, in syncerity. And therefore
ground upon it as upon the surest Rock, even in the height of thy
heavie-heartednesse, and depth of a spiritual desertion; that those depths of
sorrow, whereof our conceits can find no bottom; through which he waded in
his bloody sweat, cry upon the Cross, and painful sufferings in soul, did
most certainly Non est ergo indignum redemptori nostro quod tentari voluit, qui
venerat occidi: Iustum quippe erat ut sic tentationes nostras suis
tentationibus vinceret, sicut mortem nostram venerat sua morte superare. Greg.
Hom. 16. in Evangel.
free thee everlastingly from the guilt, venom, and endless vengeance of all
terrors of conscience, Agonies of Spirit, temptations to despair, and
damnations of Hell. The righteous Judge of all the World will never expect, or
exact at the hands of any of his Creatures double payment, a double punishment.
Our dearest Savior has satisfied to the utmost, with his own blood, the
rigor and extremity of his Fathers Justice in thy behalf; and therefore it is
utterly impossible, that thou should ever finally perish. Inward
Afflictions, and troubles of mind, may for a time press thee so sore, that
thou may be ready to sink; for 1 chastisement, 2 trial, 3 prevention of
sin, 4 perfecting the pangs of the New Birth, 5 example to others, etc. But
in despite of the united rage, and policy of all infernal Powers; Thou shall
in due time be raised again, by that victorious, and triumphant hand; which
bruised the Serpents Metaphorica est descriptio victoriae Christi de Satana. In

out of an horrible pit, be set upon a Rock, far above the reach of all
hellish hurt, or sting of horror. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee,
for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee, says
the Lord thy Redeemer, Isa. 54.8.

5. There is another terrible fiery dart, dipped full deep in the very rankest
poison of the infernal pit; which, though it be not much talked of abroad,
nor taken notice of by the World; yet is secretly suggested, and managed with
extremest malice and cruelty, in the silent bosoms of Gods blessed Ones.
Quanto districtius non exhibet membra sua, arma iniquitatis peccato, tanto
strictius buiusmodi spiritu quatitur and pulsatur. Bern. Lib. de conse. De
multip. variet. cogitat.
The most holy hearts are many times most haunted with this foulest fiend.
Strangers to the ways of God, be not much troubled in this kind, nor
ordinarily vexed with such horrors. Satan, as I said before, makes as much of
his in this World, as he can possibly; knowing, that he has time enough,
even eternity, to torment them in the World to come: And therefore he is not
wont, to weld this terrifying weapon against them, save only at some dead
lift, or upon some special advantage; as under some extraordinary misery, or
in excess of melancholy; to drive them thereby to distraction,
selfe-destruction, or despair. Or, it may be, God may suffer him to afflict
thus hideously, some grievous sinner, which he is about to bring in; to
prepare him thereby (though the Devil himself means not so) for the pangs
of the New Birth, deeper humiliations, and more vehement desires to get under
the wings of Christ from that hellish Kyte. Or, he may sometimes mingle these
horrible stings, with the terrors of spiritual travel; upon purpose to Huius
nequissimi hostis est illa vel prima caelliditas, and ars doli plena, ^atigare

Epist. 142.
hinder conversion, by a diversion into By-ways, or frighting back again to
folly and former courses. But sure I am, the ordinary object, and special aim
of Satan's malice in this Point, are only those, who have happily escaped out of
his clutches already; and are fully, and for ever freed from his damming fury,
and all-deadly hurt. And I know not, whether there be any of these, which does
not less, or more, at one time, or other, suffer under this horror. And yet
every one of them thinks himself singular in this suffering; and that it is
not usual for Gods Children, to have such prodigiously foul and fearful
thoughts put into their heads; which they dare not mention for their abhorred
monstrousness, neither remember without trembling. Now by this dreadful
engine of the Devil, which I thus talk of, before I tell you what it is; (and
no marvel, for what heart would not willingly retire, or can choose but
tremble, entreating upon such a Theme!) I mean, hideous iniections, Cogitat
homo plerumque terribilia de fide, horribilia de divinitate, and per
phantasmata corporearum imaginum transrotatus, illa sentit, quae vel in
confessione evomere peccator on^ratus exhorret. Bernar. loco supra citato.
horrible thoughts, blasphemous Suggestions, monstrous conceits of the most
holy pure and ever-glorious God, His Word, divine Truths, the Lord Jesus,
blessed for ever; or some way, or other, about spiritual and heavenly things;
framed immediately by Satan himself, and with furious violence thrown into
our minds, infinitely against our wills; at the grieselinesse whereof, not only
Religion, but also reason; Nay, even corrupted nature, and common sense, stand
astonished; shrug and shrink back at the horror, and abhor them extremely.
Some of Gods dearest Children, and those that love him best, (Would you think
it? yet it is too true) are sometimes so pestred with their irksome
intrusions; that whatsoever they speak, do, hear, read, or think upon, is
wrested, perverted, and hellishly empoisoned with this temptation of blasphemy.
And they are ordinarily pressed upon them with most importunity and
impetuousnesse, when they are best busied, and exercised in the holiest duties;
as in prayer, hearing, or reading the Word, singing of Psalms, days of
humiliation, etc.

In the first place: For a comfortable support in such a Case, peruse, ponder
well upon, and apply such considerations and counsels as these:

1. In this terrible temptation also, thou becomes but conformable to thy Lord
and Master, which bought thee with his dearest blood, and to many of his
blessed Saints. Was there ever suggestion in conceit, or word, or any
possibility of being like unto this in execrablenesse and horror: Revel.
15.3. Coloss. 2.9.
That the King of Saints, in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily, should fall down and worship the Prince of Hell, and vilest of
Creatures? And yet this most horrible blasphemy, was injected into the most
holy imagination of Jesus Christ; with which it was infinitely more impossible
to be any ways tainted, or stained, then the fairest Sunne-beame with the
foulest Dirt. But he endured it, and conquered: And that for our sakes only,
and safety, even for such excellent ends as these; first, That when we are
^et upon by Satan in the same kind, and so hideously assaulted, that upon the
first sense, we are ready to sink under the sudden fright; and to think,
that none in the world are so but we; yet in cold blood, we may comfortably
recover our selves, and presently conceive, that our Case is not singular, and
incompatible with a saving state; for even the Son of God himself surpassed
us in the same suffering. Secondly, That he might take the venom, sting, and
guilt from this hateful, and horrible temptation, for all His, to the Worlds
end. Thirdly, That having himself tasted the Devils malice herein, he might
out of His own feeling and experience, more tenderly take to heart our
troubles, and terrors that way; more mightily fortify, and free our spirits,
against the invasion, and surprise of all such prodigious injections, and
flashes of Hell.

2. It is the concurrent judgment of Blasphemous thoughts not consented to by
us, are not our sins, but the Devils. Men must not fear those kind of
thoughts over much -- Because, though indeed they be their crosses, yet are
they not their personal sins, for which they shall incur the wrath and
displeasure of God. Perkins Cases of Conscience, Lib. 1. Cap. 10. Sect. 2. We
are to know and consider, that they are not our own thoughts, but Satan's
suggestions; and therefore they shall not be laid to our charge, as being our
sins; but shall be set upon Satan's score, unto whom of right they do
appertain, together with the punishment due unto them. -- If we withstand and
abhor them as wicked, and Diabolical, showing no kind of liking of them,
they shall never be imputed to us, as our sins, but unto Satan, who is the
Author of them. Downam. Christ. Wars. Lib. 3. Cap. 11. This may comfort those,
that being vexed with fearful suggestions of Satan, as to think amiss of
God himself, etc. do therefore think amiss of themselves, as if they were
therefore most vile wretches. But they must remember, that this is no more
their sin, if they presently beat it back, then if a man like them, should
wish them to the like. Satan must answer for this himself. Daniel Dyke in his
Michael and the Dragon, at his Doct. All temptations are not sins in the
tempted. The true believer detests so the Devils motions, upon the sudden
injection sometimes, that he is without taint of sin by them; yet it is an
affliction with victory, as it was with our Savior tempted by the Devil, to
whom God sent Angels for his comfort; yet our corruption considered, it is a
rare thing. Wilson in his helps to faith, page 150. In illis cogitationibus,

learned, and holy Divines, that these monstrously blasphemous thoughts, and
satanicall suggestions, resisted, and not consented unto, are not our sins,
but our crosses. Or suppose, there should be any tainture on our parts; yet,
condemning them in our judgments, and abhorring them with our hearts; we may
be most assured, that the blood of Jesus Christ is infinitely more mighty and
sovereign, to take away the venom, and vileness of them; then the Devil
malicious, and subtil^ to inject. I will imagine, that some bloody Popish
Powder-Traytor, had pressed upon thee at that time, and suggested thus: We are
plotting, and purpose to blow up the Parliament with Gunpowder: To destroy at
one blow the King, Queen, Prince, Nobility, etc. And afterward, to cut the
throats of all the Protestants in the Kingdom; to root the Gospel out of it
for ever, etc. And then to lay the fault upon the In the Powder treason it was
the Papists plot and purpose, after the stroke, to lay the fault (if Gods mercy
had not prevented their malice) upon the Puritanes, (as now they have gotten a
trick for their advantage, to Nicke-name even good Protestants), and
accordingly they had drawn a Proclamation to that effect, ready for the
Press. Wherein they charged the Puritanes (meaning hereby, all honest men,
that are not like them) with that odious and execrable fact; and with this
draught they were found, and taken in the manner, beyond retracting, or
shadowing. Digit. D. page 27. I heard a Professor in the University avou^b

nature: For thus, men learned both in the mystery of Christ, and depths of

which, both Prince and People came, as it were, anew into the World; delivered

White Hall, page 16.

The Plot, whereof Livie speaks, of dispatching the whole Senate of Rome in an
hour: the devise at Carthage, to cut off one whole faction, by one enterprise:
the conspiring of Brutus and Cassius, to kill Caesar in the Senate; the project
of destroying in one Conclave, the greatest part of the Cardinals: the Sicilian
Even-song, and the Parisian Mattins: nay, the wish of Nero, that Rome had but
one Head, which he might cut off at one blow, came far short of this
invention, which spared neither age, sex, nor degree. Well then, if thou
should have approved, and consented unto the suggestion of this most
execrable, and unheard of villainy; for which, Hell has not a fit Name, nor the
World a sufficient punishment; thou had made thy self the most prodigious
Beast that ever breathed, an abhorred Monster of Mankind; and justly merited
to have passed presently, from most exquisite tortures here, to endelesse
torments in another World. But now, if all the while the motion was making, thy
heart had risen against it, with indignation and loathing; thou protested'st to
the Party, thy abominating any thought that way, from the heart root, to the
pit of hell; and immediately running to the King, should have discovered,
and disclaimed it, as a most detestable and hellish plot; I say then, what Man
could have justly blamed thee, or wherein could thy conscience any way accuse
thee? It is so in the present Point. As that other incarnat Devil in his
kind, so the Devil himself throws into thine imagination, most hideous
thoughts, and horrible blasphemies, even against the dreadful Majesty of
Heaven, the thrice blessed and ever-glorious Trinity, the holy Humanity of the
Lord Jesus, etc. To which, if thou should understandingly assent, and
approve indeed; thou might expect most worthily, to become ten times fouler,
then the ougliest Fiend in Hell. But since thou know in thine own
conscience, that thy heart trembles with horror and amazedness, when they are
offered; nay, violently thrust into thy mind; That thou resists, and rejects,
them, with all the power and prayer thou can possibly; can not choose, but
out of a pang of infinite detestation, and heart-rising, turn thus, or in the
like manner upon the Tempter: These very words were forced, by fury of
temptation, from One tempted in this kind.
Most malicious enemy to the glory of my God, and good of my Soul; thou
troubles thy self and me in vain. I do infinitely acknowledge my blessed
Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, to be one incomprehensibly glorious, wise,
gracious God: Heaven to be wholly filled, embroidered, impaled with nothing but
holiness and happiness: All the Creatures to be good, as they issued out of the
hands of God; and Remembrancers to us of his power, wisdom, and goodness:
Gods blessed Book to be all most holy, most true, a rich treasury of heavenly
wisdom, and sweetest knowledge, etc. And thy cursed self to be the only
Author, and Brocher of all sin, hurt, and uncom^linesse* And to thee, and
thine, alone they belong. Mingle not thou thy malice with my lowliest, most
dear, and reverend thoughts of my Father, my Savior, my Comforter, etc. And
thou art also wont presently to press in private, into Gods glorious
presence, and prostrate thy self before his righteous Throne; there to
discover this hellish malice; to complain how villanously the Devil deals
with thee; to protest thine innocence, and infinite hatred of those horrible
blasphemies; to cry heartily for pardon, patience, and power against them. And
therefore it being thus with thee, thou may, upon good ground, be more then
infinitely assured, that they are not imputed unto thee at all; but wholly set
upon Satan's score. Hence it is, and from this ground, that I have many times
told some, thus tempted: That when they have passed a day, pressed upon
violently, and pestred, with the furious intrusion of such un-utterably foul,
and fearful injections; they have, in all likelihood spent that day, with
far less sin in their thoughts; and more freedom from guilt, and
provocation of divine anger, then if they had been free: Because they being so
earnestly, and vehemently deprecated; withstood with such aversion and
loathing; protested against unfainedly, and that upon such terms, that they
would rather be torn in pieces with wild Horses; die ten thousand deaths;
do, or suffer any thing; then yield the least assent, or approbation
thereunto: they are then, I say, not their Nonnun quam alicuius mentem plurimum

sins, but crosses. Nay, and further for their comfort, If they should be
haunted by them, until their ending hour (which God forbid, and beat back
such accursed, and hateful spite from every humble soul); yet cleaving close
unto the Lord Jesus, hating all sin, and having respect to all Gods
commandments; they are not able at all, neither can any whit hinder, hurt, or
any way prejudice their spiritual state, and everlasting salvation.

everlastingly; By reason of the horror, and angvish, that shall come upon
their souls; the affliction, the worme-wood, and the gall: for horrible is the
end of the unrighteous generation: they are immediately thrown down from the
top of their imaginary felicity, and untroubled bed of seeming peace, to the
depth of extremest misery, and bottom of the burning Lake. But it is not so

Father. But here take notice, that in this dispensation of fatherly corrections
amongst his Children, He ever out of his unsearchable merciful wisdom,
singles out, and makes choice of those, which are most punctual, and simply
the fittest for their spiritual good. And therefore both for the kind, and
particular; let us ever humbly, and thankfully submit, and wholly refer our
selves, to the sweet and wise disposing of our most loving, and dearest Father:
Who ever knows best, what is best for us in such Cases; both in regard of his
service, and our sufferings; his glory and our gain; what we are able to
bear; How he has furnished us beforehand with spiritual strength, to go
through temptations and troubles; what spiritual Physic is most quick, and
operative, and apted to the prevention, cure, and recovery of our
soule-sickenesses, distempers, and declinations; How wisely to proportion, and
mercifully moderate, in respect of measure, time, and working; and when His
hand is heavy upon us in one kind, tenderly to take care, that we be not
oppressed with other extremities also: As appears by that sweet observation of

story of the two Glovers: God in his holy providence, seeing his old and
trusty servant so many years, with so extreme, and many torments, broken and
dried up; would in no wise heap too many sorrows upon one poor silly wretch;
neither would commit him to the flames of fire; who had been already baked, and
scorched with the sharp fires of inward affliction; and had sustained so many
burning darts, and conflicts of Satan so many years. God therefore of his
divine providence, thinking it too much, that one man should be so much

Robert his brother, being both stronger of body, and also better furnished with
helps of learning to answer the Adversaries, should sustain the conflict. It
may be, our only wise God, purposes to exercise us extraordinarily with
spiritual conflicts, and troubles of conscience; and therefore does mercifully
give us more prosperity, and comfort in our outward state: Or perhaps, to
afflict us with variety of worldly crosses; and therefore does sweetly, and
compassionately, give us more peace and comfort at home in our own hearts: Or
it may be, He means to make us ominent Objects of disgrace, reproach, and
slander in the World; and even from those, who sit in the gate, for our
forwardness and excellency of zeal; and therefore out of a gracious
tender-heartednesse, gives us both more calmness in conscience, and
contentment in outward things: Or, perhaps, He may lay all these upon us;
suffer us to be tried with ill tongues, with troubles without, and terrors
within; why then undoubtedly, his grace shall be sufficient for us. So wise,
and so merciful is our blessed God. Only, first, let us take heed (tho in our
own apprehensions and misdeeming, we may pretend, and except never so
plausibly) that we never prescribe unto him; How, in what kind, or measure he
should afflict us. Secondly, That we never ward, or put off any blow from his
own heavenly hand, Men, or Creatures, with the wound of Conscience; never
decline any ill, by ill means. Thirdly, That we learn, and labor to profit
by, and make the right use of all his corrections. Fourthly, And ever magnify
the glory of his mercy, and wisdom, in sparing us any way; his tenderhearted
taking notice, where we are weakest, and not so able to bear his severer
visitations; but specially, that he ever, pitches upon that affliction, which
does our souls most good; and serves most punctually to procure, protect, and
promote the soundness, safety, and flourishing of our spiritual state. Well
then, for my purpose, and thy support: since our most holy God deals thus with
all, that are not damned; to wit, sorts out unto them, those several crosses
and corrections; which, out of his unsearchable wisdom, and spiritual
necessity of their souls, he sees most fit to keep them humble, obedient,
and in awe; Take thou up, and in good part, this cross of thine, while it
pleases God to exercise thee with it, as thy portion. Others, tho free from
this, yet have their proportion and proper Potion; and that, perhaps, in a
bitterer Cup, and from a more smarting Rod. It may be, it goes well with thee,
in And yet I know some horribly afflicted in this kind, and yet in some
respects, as outwardly miserable, as can be imagined: but then know, that the
merciful power of God is mightily improoved for extraordinary support.
other respects; in which, were thou yet crossed, the physic would not take,
nor work so kindlily. Our all-wise heavenly Physician knows, this dreadful
dart will only do it. Who knows whether, if thou were not haunted with these
foul Furies, I mean, furious injections of the Devils own Forge, thou
might grow worldly, lukewarm; too passionate, proud, secure; or something
which God would not have thee, and would be infinitely for thy hurt. Be Thou
therefore patient under them, humbled by them, make a holy and profitable use
of them; comfort thy self in them, by these considerations commended unto thee
for that purpose; and learn, how to behave thy self about them, by the
following counsels.

4. As at their first approach, and offer, thou ought to stir up, and
steel thy heart; to improve the strength and stoutnesse of all the powers of
thy soul, to make a mighty and forcible resistance; lifting up at the same
instant thy heart, in a bitter complaint, against the cruelty and malice of the
adversary; a strong cry for the rebuking of him, and restraint of his hellish
spite, with extreme detestation of all such divellish filth; so take heed,
that thou never revolve in thy mind, or muse upon those his blasphemous
temptations. But say with Luther, a Kite, or Cormorant may fly over my house,
but sure, shall never rooust, or nestle there. Or, as another; a ravenous and
hateful Bird may begin to build in mine Arbor, I cannot hinder it; but I will
never fail to pull it down, as often as she begins. The Devil will
inject, whether thou Onerosas cogitationes in anima iusti ill as accipe, quibus

wilt or no: But resolve to suffer them by no means, to have any rest, or
residence in thine imagination. If thou be a Minister (and the holiest men are
Satan's special mark, that he would gladliest hit with his fiery darts),
take advise, which has proved sovereign and helpefull, to beat back, and
banish these temptations of blasphemy. The mind of every man of God,
instructed to the Kingdom of heaven, is, as I suppose, still digging into the
rich Mines of divine truth; diving into the great mystery of Christ: ever
discoursing in it self for, or doing something for the advancement of the
work of the Lord, their Ministerial affairs, and welfare of Souls.
Temporizers indeed, seldom and selfe-Preachers, are not much troubled this
way, neither take these things so to heart. They seek more to advance
themselves, then save souls; their chief study is, if they be not downeright

I say, if they were thus affected, they would be such as they ought, and as I
now suppose; to wit, have many webs, as it were, of their holy work in their
heads all at once; many in Misteriall Taskes in agitation, and on foot still:
Some part of the day, they would, perhaps, search, and pierce into the pith,
and marrow of some Scripture-text; at another time, wraflle with the
difficulties, and knotty distinctions of some Popish, or Neo-pelagian

perplexed, and intricate Case of Conscience, etc. Well then, for my purpose,

thoughts, presently Tentatio illa gravis and turpis blasphemiae seu quaecunque

divert, and resort to the hardest of all those irons, thou have in the fire,
if I may so speak; and that which has need of most hammering; I mean, to
the most difficult and weighty Points, of all those several spiritual
businesses, thou had last in thy brain; and single out that particular,
which did most puzzle, and put thy understanding to it. Where-abouts, when the
strength, heat, and intension of thy whole soul is spent, and improoved: not
only other impertinent wanderings, and vagaries, but these idle and irksome
injections also, will more easily vanish, and be gone. Let others also
proportionably upon such occasions, besides other helps; have recourse to the
most troublesome and over-mastering part of their honest imploiments; to the
chiefest, and needefullest affair of their lawful Callings.

5. In temptations of this nature, never set thy self to Ratio efficax est

ampli^us: De tanto ignis instam mescit vehementius, and augetur citius, etc. --

dispute with the Devil; he is an old Sophister of above five thousand years
standing, in the School of hideous temptations, and hellish policies, and thou
art but a Novice. He has many Methods, Devices, and Depths, which thy shallow
forecast cannot possibly fathom. Direct opposition by reasons, and replies,
stirs up the out-ragious Blasphemour to grow more furious: And hereby we
give him greater advantage; more matter of molestation and mischief; and may
so plunge our selves further into an intricate maze of horror, and confused
distractions. Our blessed Captain, Christ Jesus, may be a pattern for us in
this Point. When he was tempted, to fall down and worship Satan; he
reasons not the Case, but repells him with vehement extraordinary detestation
and disdain: Avoid Satan. It will therefore be our best wisdom, at such a
time, to turn from him; and as Hezekiah spread his blasphemous letter, so to
lay open his fury before the Lord: crying mightily unto him, and entreating
him, even for his own honors sake, to vindicate the purity of his great
Majesty, and excellency of his unspotted glory, from this hellish filth, and
horrible villainy of his damned vilest Creature; That he would cast it, as dung,
upon the Tempters face: and in the Passion and Blood of Christ, free fully, and
for ever, our poor souls trembling under the hideousness of his malice and
cruelty, from the guilt, stain, terror, and assault of all such abhorred, and
p^^odigeous blasphemy. In that other terrible temptation also, to
Selfe-murther, many much wrong themselves this way. In managing this fiery
dart, the Adversary deals by way of argument too, and presses reasons, such as
they are, upon the temted; sometimes extremely absurd, especially, if the party
be something more simple and ignorant; sometimes, exceedingly subtle, if he
be of better understanding and capacity. As thus: It is soon done, and the
pain quickly past: Thou art like thus to languish, and lie in misery all thy
life long: The longer thou live, the larger will be the score of thy sins,
and so thy torments in hell more horrible hereafter: If it be once done, it
will appear to have bin Gods decree; and I hope thou will not oppose the
accomplishment of that: Here, if thou answer: Yea, but in the mean time it is
better to spend the remainder of my few and evil days, upon earth, then in
Hell; he will reply: But so thou shall increase thy sins here, and by
consequent thy hellish pains hereafter; to which if thou rejoyne: But the
heinousness of selfe-murder, and horriblenesse of despair may appear more
vile and execrable in the eyes of God, then all the other sins I may commit
to the last period of my natural course: He may then hideously roar: But so
thou may both go on to increase thy sins, and make away thy self at last;
and where art thou then? etc. I know him to have thus thrown his fiery darts
into trembling hearts, one after another, with extreme subtilnesse and cruelty.
And therefore in these Cases, do not admit of any dispute, or conference with
him; But upon the very first assault (for who would hear him talk, that will
tell never a true word, and is thy sworn bloody enemy?) be ever sure
presently to lay hold upon the Word of God, that weapon of proof; which serves
like a sword, not only for defense, as all the other pieces of armor, but also
for offense. Beat back with undaunted resolution and confidence this Divelish
da^t; and stop for ever the mouth of the Tempter with the contrary charge of
the most holy, and all-powerfull God: Thou shall not kill.
Do what thou can, thou will be damned, when all is done, etc. Now in this
Case, if thou debate the matter with the Devil, and begin to confer; thou art
like enough to be more and more confounded, and entangled with inextricable
astonishments, and danger to be utterly undone, and suddenly blown up by the
mine of his soule-murdering sophistry. But if according to the precedence, and
practice of thy Lord and Master, who has begun unto thee in this bitter Cup,
is afflicted in all thy afflictions; and ever stands by thee as a victorious
commander, and conqueror in all such assaults; first, abominate, and beat
back, this base and bloody motion, with infinite indignation and loathing;
Avaunt Satan: And then immediately lay hold on the sword of the Spirit, and
keep him at the point of it; and then assuredly, all the Devils in Hell
cannot hurt thee. Tell him, that against his vile and villainous suggestion, and
all the subtilties, and sophistry with which he seconds it; this is thy only
answer, even the precise, holy and everlasting countermand of his, and thy
Creator, the mighty Lord of heaven and earth: Thou shall not kill. Now if it
be a crimson, and crying sin; the most deadly opposite, and desperate
cut-throate of charity, to kill an other; and fastneth such a deep, and
inexpiable stain upon the face of a whole Kingdom; that it cannot be razed
out, Numb. 35.33.
but by the blood of him that shed it; How execrable, and heinous then is this;
and what depth of Hell, and height of horror, does that abhorred Miscreant
deserve, and may expect; who makes away himself? For the Rule of charity,
whereby we love one another, is proportioned by that charity, whereby a man
loves himself. If the Devil be able to dissolve, and disanull the most
absolute, perfect, and just Law of the most High; who, tho all other things
besides, are something in possibility, which as yet they are not in act; yet
himself, is actually, and everlastingly, whatsoever he may be; and cannot
hereafter be that, which now he is not; and so by consequent, is with out all
variableness, or shadow of turning: I say, if the Prince of darkness can
reverse this Law of the Father of Lights; Thou shall not murder; thou may
well say, thou will then think of an other answer. But, till that be, which
is more, then infinitely impossible ever to come to pass; thou will rather lie
in the miseries of Hell upon earth (which indeed were incomparably better),
then breaking Gods blessed Law, go down into the grave in a bloody coffin,
made by thy own hands, only at the Devils bidding. Can this madness ever be
matched; for a man, besides Selfe-severing the soul from his body before the
time, by a more heinous and un-naturall villainy, then murdering of his own
father, (for every man is naturally next unto himself); and sending it
suddenly, all goare-blood, by becoming his own Butcher and hangman, unto the
dreadful Tribunal, of the all-powerfull God; the most certain, and severe
Revenger of all bloodshed: to bring also abundance of unnecessary shame, grief
and hopeless mourning upon Friends, Kindred, Husband, Children, Parents; a
reproachful stain and brand, upon House, Name, Burial, Posterity, etc. And
that merely at the instance, and upon the most absurd, ridiculous, and
senseless suggestion of the Arch-murtherer, thy mortal, and immortal enemy;
against sense, reason, nature, religion, Scripture, Gods direct command to the
contrary, even Heathen Philosophy, Heaven and Earth!

6. Avoid idleness, solitariness, and too much secrecy; three maine
advantages for the adversary, which he watchfully apprehending, and plying
industriously, works a world of mischief upon afflicted souls, in their
spiritual miseries. Idleness lays a man open to all hellish snares and
temptations; makes the heart, like unmanured ground, fit for nothing, but the
wildest, and rankest weeds of lust, luxury, lewd company, the universal
inordinatenes of Original corruption, to domineere, rage, and do what it
will: Like standing Pooles, naturally prepared, and pregnant to breed, and feed
the vermin, and venom of vilest thoughts, and un-naturall filth: Like
Thorow-faires, for Satan's most hideous, Non est aliqua cogitatio tam turpis,
tam abominabilis, mala, and execranda, quam non inveniat otiositas. Nam cor
vacantis otio est ad inst^r Molendini, quod cum non habet ad molendum bonum

and horrible injections, to wander and walk up and down in, without
restraint, or remedy. Solitariness, besides it is native property and power,
to make sad, increase melancholy, and aggravate fears, does in this Case, more
then any, bring an heavy Woe; Eccles. 4.10.
Woe to him, that is alone: For if the weak Christian fall, he has not
another to help him up. He may there be surprised, yield, and foiled, before he
get into such company, which might happily have prevented it, or supported him
in the temptation. Too much secrecy and concealment, may cause the wound of a
terrified conscience, to bleed inward, rankle, fester, and grow desperate;
whereas seasonable discovery* might have cured, and comforted it: Horror
arising from the apprehension, of such uncouth and monstrous thoughts, kept
close, and damned up in the man's own breast, may swell so high, that the poor
soul may be in great danger to be woefully drowned, and overwhelmed by it;
which had it had vent be time; eased, and emptied it self into some holy and
faithful bosom; might, by divine and discreet counsel, by little and little
dried up quite. I have known him, who did bite in, and keep close in his
bosom, this temptation of blasphemy the space of about twenty years. All
which while, the Devil did tyrannize extremely, and keep him almost in
continual terror. He thought there was never man had such vile, and
prodigious thoughts, as he: And if the World knew what they were, he should
be abhorred as a monster of men, and the loathsommest creature upon earth*
most worthy to be utterly exterminated, and rooted out of the society, and
confines of Mankind. And hereupon many and many a time, when he apprehended
any opportunity, or had any means offered to make himself a way, he was
tempted there unto; principally upon this ground, that it was pity, such an
horrible Blasphemer (for so he supposed) should any longer breathe. But at
last, hearing the nature, manner, and remedy, of these hideous injections
discovered by the Ministry; afterward privately informing himself further,
and more fully from Gods Messenger, was happily, taken of the rack for the
time to come, and most wonderfully refreshed. And therefore take heed of
keeping the Devils counsel. The tempted in this kind may do well, to be
still conversant in religious duties, honest works of their lawful Callings,
company of skillfull experienced Soul* physicians, or one or other comfortable
imploiment.

7. Settle in thy heart, a peremptory, impregnable resolution, never to
entertain any conceit of that great Majes^y and glory above; of the most holy
and everblessed Trinity* or any thing there-about; but such only as is
revealed* and represented unto thee in Gods Book. Whatsoever is objected by
carnal reason to the contrary; or injected by the Devil, any ways to deprave
the divinenesse of that glorious Truth, ought to be rejected as cursed, false,
and execrable. And therefore, when that hellish Nimrod shall at any time hunt,
and chase thine affrighted soul, with these blasphemous Hell Hounds; be sure
ever to take Sanctuary in the Oracles of God, and keep thee close and safe
under this Covert. Whatsoever is not comprehended within the Confines of that
sacred Pale; warranted by holy Writ, the sovereign Touchstone of all heavenly
Truth; let it be abhorred, and retorted as dung upon the face of the Tempter.
That sense and apprehension of the Deity, and divine things, which is not sucked
from the breasts of the two Testaments, is in this regard to be reputed rank
poison; repelled, and abominated with infinite indignation and disdain. And
for further help herein, when thou find thy self thus followed with the
violent, and incessant incursions of this furious folly; call often, and
seriously to mind, that accursed brand, which the Book of God has set upon
the Adversary, Ioh. 8.44.
that he is the Father of lies; and let that still continue a more resolute
rejection and contempt, of whatsoever comes from him. Suppose a raging Bedlam
should follow thee up and down, all the day long, and tell thee, that thy
father, or special friend, were a Stone, a Bird, a Tree, a Toade, or
whatsoever is viler, or more absurd: would thou hereupon entertain, and
harbor in thy mind, any mis impression, or monstrous persuasion of the party?
I trow not: (only his senseless clamor, and restless raving would be very
^^kesome, troublesome, and un-welcome) especially since thou art furnished with
a clear demonstrative light out of natural Philosophy, that he is a
reasonable Creature; and thy self sees in him, the face and favor, the shape
and proportion of a Man. Proportionably, Satan, that bloody Bedlam of Hell, out
of that madness, at which Heaven and Earth may stand amazed, solicites thee to
admit such, and such horrible and hideous conceits of thy dearest Lord, his
Son, and sacred Word. (Ah cursed Fiend, that ever thou should discover
such prodigious malice against thy glorious Maker!) Now God infinitely forbid,
that this should cause the least alteration, or any diminution at all, of thy
lowliest, most reverent, adoring, and divinest thoughts of so great a God. For
have but recourse to the holy Records of all sound, supernatural, and saving
knowledge; I mean, the Word of life, with which thou ought to consult; and
to which only thou art confind in this Case; and thou shall find him to be,

perceive a shadow of his divine countenance; in his provision for all that
live, his manifold goodness: And lastly, in creating, and making existent the
World universal, by the absolute Art of his own Word, his power, and
Almightiness^; which Power, Light, Virtue, Wisdom, and Goodness* being al^
but Attributes of one simple Essence, and one God, we in all admire, and in
part discern per speculum creaturarum, that is in the disposition, order, and
variety of Celestial and Terrestrial bodies: Terrestrial in their strange,
and manifold diversities; Celestial in their beauty and magnitude; which in
their continual, and contrary motions, are neither repugnant, intermixed, or
confounded. By these potent effects, we approach to the knowledge of the
Omnipotent cause, and by these motions, their Almighty mover. Whenever
therefore that most implacable, and everlasting enemy to Gods glory, and the
good of his Children, shall go about to pervert, and cross by his blasphemous
injections, these sober and sacred conceptions of the thrice glorious, and
ever-blessed Deity; planted in thy mind, by his own Word, and this visible
World; bid him, by the example of thy Lord and Master, avoid and avaunt;
trample upon his hellish spite; appeal unto Gods righteous Throne, with
protestation of thine innocence; damning them unto the Pit of Hell in thy
Judgment; and hating them, not without horror, from the very heart-roote; and
so truly resisting them, crying mightily unto God for pardon, wherein soever
thou shall fail about them; and for power against them; and then possess thy
humble soul in patience and peace.

them; do not by any means continue to afflict and torture thy spirit about

Let them now pass away, and be packing; abandon them with an holy
detestation, contempt, and slighting, without any such dismayednesse and
terror; as most unworthy of any longer taking to heart, or notice of: much
less of that carking and trouble, as to terrify, in-dispose, and dis-able
thee for a cheerful discharge of either of thy Callings, particular, or
general; Divines hold even godly sorrow unseasonable, when it unfitteth the
body or mind to good duties; or to a good, and cheerful manner of doing
them; how much more would they not have these hellish distractions and
intrusions to dishearten thee in this kind? But least of all, of that
pestilent prevailing, as to fill thine heart with extraordinary astonishment,
horror and doubting; whether such monstrous injections be incident to
sanctified souls, a saving state, and habitation of the Holy Ghost; and so to
put thee into a habit of heavy walking, and secret sadness, by reason of
continual questioning the soundness of thy conversion; the constancy of Gods
love unto thee; former assurance of an immortal Crown; and whether it be
possible, that Jesus Christ should dwell in a soul hanted with such horrible
thoughts. Procurement of which miseries and molestations, is the Adversaries
only aim. For so immesurably malicious is He, that if he cannot plunge thee
into the pit of hell* and everlasting flames in the World to come; Est autem

yet will be labor might and maine, to keep thee upon the Rack; and in as much
terror, as he can possibly, all thy life long, in this vale of tears. Suffer
then this advise to sink seriously into thy heart: Being illightned, rightly
informed, and directed about them, let them no longer astonish thy spirit;
detain thee in horror; hurt thy heart, or hinder thee in any duty to God or
man; or in an humble, comfortable, and confident walking with thy God, as thou
art wont; or of thy former sweet communion with Jesus Christ. And the rather
because; First, It is the Tempters earnest end, only out of pure spite, to put
this imposture, and unnecessary vexing perplexities upon thee. Secondly, The
more thou art troubled with them, and takes them to heart (for that is it he
would have), the more violently and villanously, will he press them upon thee,
and terrify. Thirdly, They are not thine, but his fearful sins; He alone
must answer for them, at that great and last Day, and thou go free. It is his
malicious madness, of such a prodigious nature, and notoriousnesse, as is
beyond conceit, and above all admiration: only fit for a Devil: That He may
trouble thee temporally, He mightily aggravates his own eternal torment!

In a second place, let me tender unto thee an Antidote; which has been found
sovereign, and succesfull this way.

The sum of it is this: Let the tempted Christian labor to work, and
extract, by the blessings of God, some spiritual good, out of the horrible
hell of these most hateful, abominable, blasphemous suggestions. And if Satan
once see, that thou s^cks honey out of his poison; comfort out of his cruelty;
medicine out of his malice: he will have no heart, or hope to go on; no
courage or contentment to continue the temptation.

Take it in the sense, if not in the same words, without any variation, or
enlargement, as it was applied and prosper'd:

Spiteful and malicious Fiend; cursed enemy to heaven and earth; by the
mercies of God (hough thy purpose be most pestilent) yet thou shall not hurt,
or have any advantage against me hereby: Thy base and dunghill injections
tending to the dishonor of my God, and my Christ, etc. shall make me:

1. More hate thine infinitely hateful, and revengefull malice, against that
thrice-glorious, and ever-blessed Majesty above.

2. With more feeling and dearness, to adore, and love the glory and
sweetness of my God, and my Redeemer. For the more excessive and endless, I
feel thy spite against Him* the more, I know, is his incomprehensible
excellency and worth.

3. To pray oftener, and more fervently, that my God would rebuke thee, and cast
this extreme malice of thine, as dung, upon thine own face.

4. To be still more humbled under the hand of my mighty Lord; because I
cannot be more humbled, and with more resolution and abhorrence, abominate,
and abandon such prodigiously-senselesse, and hellish blasphemies of His (for I
am sure they are none of mine) into the bottomless bottom of that darkest
Dungeon: In the blackest horror whereof, they were most maliciously, and
monstrously hatched.

5. To take up a strong argument, and answer, against an other of thy cursed
injections, tending to Atheism, and the not Being of those endless joies
above. Because I most plainly and palpably, feel thee, an invisible spirit,
casting into my imagination such horrid, absurd, and ridiculously impious
thoughts; which cannot possibly spring ordinarily, or naturally from any power,
or possibility of mine own soul: I know If your Atheist will not believe his
own eyes, beholding the strange judgments of God in others; but will rather
give his own senses the lie, then acknowledge the truth of the Godhead: let
him but by some injurious deed, or contumelious word, provoke some Witch of
Endor; that has the temporary power over some Spirit, upon condition, that he
shall have eternal power over her; and it is like enough (he being void of
all faith, and sense of God, and so out of his protection) that he shall feel
to his cost, and conf^sse to his shame, that there is a power over, and besides
the ordinary course of nature. Gent. Indeed these Atheists that deny God do
also deny, that there is either Devil or Angel; and I think will confosse
them all, as soon, as any one. Morton of the nature of God, cap 1 page 34. I
quote this only, to infer, that when Satan does thus clea^^ly ^^s^over
himselfely accident and consequent, he banishes all thoughts of Atheism: or
offers at least, to any understanding Man, an evident argument against it.
thereby, and assure my self, that there is also an infinite, most wise, and
glorious Spirit, which created both me and thee: And will in due time chain
Thee up for ever, in the Pit of Hell; and bring me at length, by the blessed
merit of his only dearest Sons bloodshed, into the bosom of his own glory,
and everlasting bliss.

6. To confirm mine own heart, with stronger Cum cogitatio huiusmodi mala,
horrenda, grossa, t^^pis and nefaria importune occurrerit; non terreatur, nec
triftetur persona devota propterea nimium; neque credat se propter talem a Deo
derelictum -- sed maiorem siduciam se pertinendi ad Deum, inde accipiat. Gers.
de mod. se habendi contr. mal. immis. Quidam putant se esse desertos a Deo,
quia non dat eis quietem a tentationibus: quum potius tentatio signum divini
amoris sit. Multiplicatio tentationum signum est, quod aliquis de manibus
Daemonum evaserit. Dum aliquit est in carcere, unicum habet custodem, vel duos:
si vero evaserit, omnes eum insequuntur. Sic dum aliquis captus est a Diabolo,
non tantum eum daemones per sequuntur, quantum, quum ovaserit. Gregor. Quis
pertinens ad Christum non varijs tentationibus agitatur, and quotidie agit cum
illo Diabolus and Angeli eius, ut pervertatur qualibet cupiditate, qualibet
suggestione; aut promissione lucri, vel terrore damni vel promissione vitae,
vel terrore morti^, aut alicuius Potentis inimicitijs, aut alicuius Potentis
amicitijs? Omnibus modis instat Diabolus, quemadmodum deijciat. August. in
Psalm. 62. Hostis noster adhuc in hac vita nos positos, quanto magis nos sibi
rebellare conspicit, tanto amplius expugnare contendit. Eos enim pulsare
negligit, quos quieto iure possiderese sentit. Contra nos vero eo vehementius
incitatur, quo ex cord nostro qu^si exiure propriae habitationis expellitur.
Hoc enim Dominus sub quadam dispensatione sig^guravit, qui Diabolum non nifi
post Baptisma se tentare permisit: ut signum nobis quoddam futurae conversionis
innueret, quod mombra eius post quam ad Deum proficerent, tunc acriores
tentationu^ insidias toleranent. Post prima^ igitur vicem moeroris atque
laetitiae, quam unusquisque per studium conversionis agnoscit, haec secunda
suboritur: quia ne securitatis negligentia dissolvatur, impulsu tentationis
efficitur. Et quidem quisque in ipso conversionis init^o magna plerunque
excipitur dulcedine consolationis, sed durum laborem post modum experitur
probationis Gregor. in cap. 33. Job. Ex qua re nobis factus est adversarius
Diabolus, nisi ex hac, quia videt hiberos, quos tenebat ante captivos: quia
videt sanos, quos suis iaculis prostraverat valneratos; qui videt vestiri denno
immortalitate, quos nudaverat propinando iniquitatem, quia Muscipula eius
comminuta and nos eruti sumus? August. De symb. ad Catechum. lib. 2. cap. 1.
assurance, (which is no mean benefit) that I undoubtedly belong unto God, and
am in a gracious state. For thou well know, and so does mine own Soul;
that thou never troubledst me (to any purpose) with these ougly blasphemous
thoughts, while I yet lay stark dead in sins and trespasses; and drowned
full deep in vanity and lust; in carnal looseness, and sensual courses.
Then thou being the strong Man, possessedst me wholly, and all was quiet;
because all was thine: But being now happily rescued out of thy clutches, by a
mightier then Thou; and having blessedly broke the Prison by the help of the
holy Ghost; Thou follows me with this fiery malice, and the most prodigious
yellings of that infernal pit. And I am persuaded, it is a pestilent piece of
thy deepest cunning; very rarely to vex civil worldlings; those that lie in
any gross sin; or any, which thou keep fast, and secure in thy snares,
with such affrighting and greisely temptations. For thou craftily fears, lest
striking that horror into the heart of a natural man, which is wont to arise
from such hellish fogs, and blasphemous filth; thou should thereby give him
occasion, to renounce, detest, and drive him out of thine accursed slavery, and
cause him to cast about for a new Master.

7. To take notice of some special corruption, lust, passion, or spiritual
distemper in one kind or other; over which I have not holden that hand,
hatred, wakefull eye, as it were meet. For I am persuaded, my God out of his
merciful goodness, aims at, and intends some such good unto my soul, by
enlarging thy chain; and suffering thee at this time to afflict me in this
uncouth manner, with this hell-empoison'd dart, something extraordinarily. I
have not been so sensible of thy other temptations, far more ensnaring in
sin, tho not so terrifying; and therefore my gracious Lord may suffer thee at
this time, thus to thrust out thy horns, as they say, in this most horrible,
and outrageous encounter; that I may be thoroughly advertised, what an
Adversary I have; and so, more mind, and mark him, for fear of much secret
and sudden mischief, by my security and neglect; and more quickened to an
universal watchfulness against all his Methods, Devises, and Depths; as well
his subtle, and sly insinuations in the glory of an Angel; as his impetuous,
and furious assaults in the shape of a foul Fiend. Some trouble, cross,
heavy accident, disgrace, coffeehouse; some great and weighty affair on
foot, unseasonable entertainements, sad news from abroad, or something has
too often stolen my heart from that full and fruitful attention to holy
duties, which was due, and that even upon the Lords day: And I can now
remember, and my conscience tells me, upon this occasion, that I have not
watched over the many idle, impertinent wanderings, and vagaries of my
imagination, as I ought; but given so far way unto them, that they have
justly brought upon me an uncomfortable deadness of affection, barrenness
and indisposition, in the use of the ordinances; and conversing with God by
Meditation, Prayer, hearing of the Word, singing of Psalms, examination of the
Conscience, and other religious Exercises; and I know not, into what further
spiritual misery they may lead me; and therefore in great mercy the most
wise God goes now graciously about, to correct, and mortify the vanity,
worldliness, distractions, and mis-imploiment of my thoughts; even by the
terrors of these thy most horrible, and hellish injections. And by the help
of God, I will follow the meaning, and conduct of his holy Hand for a right use
of them, and attaining that happy end, which he does so mercifully intend.

8. To gather skill, experience, and dexterity, for the raising, and reviving
of others hereafter, hanging down the head, heavie-hearted, and maliciously
haunted in the same kind. By discovering unto them thy bootelesse malice, the
sovereign medicines I have met with in the Ministry of the Word; and the good
I gained to my soul hereby; By the help of that Almighty hand, which can
turn the darkest midnight into the brightest morning, and produce a
Medicinable Potion out of the rankest poison.

Me thinks this heaven, which by divine blessing, I extract out of thy hell;
this healing virtue, which I draw from thy vilest venom; this spiritual good,
which I gather from thy divelish spite, should make thee weary of this way, and
pull in thy horns. I trust in my God, it will shortly cause thee to cast away
this weapon, and quit the field quite. For thou ever infinitely hate, and
hinders all thou can, the glory of God, all exercise and increase of grace,
and the welfare of my poor soul; which by accident, and his sanctifying
power, who ever turns all things to the best, to them that love Him, are all
happily advanced, furthered, and enlarged by this raging, and pestilent rancour
of thine.

And who would not think, Quod ad Sanctorum gloriam proficit, malignis
spiritibus crescit in damnationis augmentum. -- De omni quidem malitia sua
Daemones in aterna poena ^unientur. In congressione quidem occulti certaminis,
quando electi vincunt mala, quae repellunt, suis hostibus tribuunt: Quia isti
tanquam aurum in furnace probantur, illi vero pro reproba suggestione
puniuntur. Greg. in 1. Reg. cap. 9.
were not the incredible depth of thy malice and madness, equally unfathomable
by the wit of Man; But that thou should the rather surcease; because these
Satanicall suggestions, to me, that resists, are but crosses and corrections;
but in thee, most outrageous and execrable blasphemies; which will mightily
hereafter add to the heaviness and horror of thine everlasting chains of
darkness and damnation, at the judgment of the great Day.

FINIS.
