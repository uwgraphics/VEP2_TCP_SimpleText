Certain versis / writtene by Thomas Brook Ge^tleman / in the time of his
impryso^ment / the day before his death / who suffered at Norwich / the. 30.
of August. 1570.
I Languishe / as I lie /
And death does make me thrall /
To cares which death shall sone cut of /
And set me quyt / of all.
yett feeble flesh would faint /
To feale so sharp a fight /
Save Faith in Christ / does comfort me /
And sleithe such fancy quyght.
For fyndyng forth how frail /
Each wordly state does stand /
I hold him blyst / that fearyng God /
Is redd of such a band.
For he that longest lives /
And Nestors years does gain /
Has so much more account to make /
And fyndyth Life but vain.
What cawse is then to quayle /
I am called before /
To taste the Joys which Christis blood /
Has bowght and laid in store.
No no / no greter Joy /
Can any heart posses /
Then throwgh the death to gain a life /
With him in blyssednes.
Who send the Queen long life /
Much Joy and contries peace /
Her Cowncell health / her fryndes good luck /
To all there Joys increase.
Thus puttyng up my greaues /
I grownde my life on God /
And thank him with most humble heart /
And mekelye kiss his rod.
Finis /
quod Thomas Brook.

Seane / and allowyd / according to the Queen's Maiestyes Iniunction.
God save the Queen
Imprynted at Norwich in the Paryshe of Saynct Andrewe / by Anthony de
