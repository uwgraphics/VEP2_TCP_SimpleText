To goodman Chapels supplication.
HArry who ball hark, mast Camel has yzeene
Thy vengeance zory bill, and thompes the as I wene,
And is by Christ full zad, that thou come out zo late,
Thou might have had a place vor Pekehorn at his gate
But vortune frended not, chote it very well,
The more hard hap thou had, ich do the plainly tell.
Vor zure charde him swear, by gogs digne dainty bones,
Thou shoods be new ishod, to trample these old stones,
And westwardes shodst have zit, for blearyng of thyn eyes.
Vor zommer now a teowes, will hurt the zore with flies,
But he no nyggon is, a will vorde the a flappe,
Thou shall have a voxtayle man, to put upon thy cappe,
And gods benison to, tho Churcharde tie him short,
Churchard wears a bell ats tail to make his friends sport,
And Camel choppes holy water, for Churcharde and for the,
Vor he will to you both, a holy chaplayn be.
And if a vittin not, er twaie days be ago,
He will you sprinkle both, as varre as I do know.
It Is a vengeance beast, and bygge to bear you all,
And if you zit not vast, bum faie, map to vall.
Thomas Camel.
