The book of Medycynes. How thou shall make aqua vite.
NOw in the beginning first I will make perfyte to you ye composycyon of aqua
vi^e / yt which is called in English the water of life. First fill a pot of
old reed wine clear and strong / and do therein powder of Canell / gylof^r /
gynger / pelatur / nutmegge / galyngale / spyknarde / ma^^s / quybyles /
graynes of Paris / long pepur / black syromo^ten / common / fenell sede /
smalage / persly / sage / mynt / rewe / calamynt and horshoue of yche of them
like much / and be ware that they dyffre not the weight of a dram under nor
above at the most / ye weight of a drame is two pens halfpeny / tha^ put all ye
above said powders in the wine / and after put them in a styllatory and
dystyll it with soft fire / and look that thy styllatory be well clemed so
that no fumosyte go out / and look that thy fire be of good cole / also receive
thy water out of a Le^becke in a vyoll of glass. This water is called the water
of life / and it may be lykened to bame and put in the stead of bame natural /
for it has all ye natures of kind of bame and al^ ye virtues thereof / and
therefore philosophers do name it the second bame This water is clear and
lyghter than the water of roses / for it will flete above all lytours / for if
oil be put above this water anon it secheth the ground. This water keeps
flesh and fysshe both raw and sothen in his own kind and state. Also as
long as a man is withouten wemme or rottynge if he be washed therein it
helps greatly against achys in the bones pockes / and such other. And no
manner of thing that is put therein may not rot. This water of life draws out
the sweetness and savor of all manner of spyces and of all rotes that been
therein netted or laid. Also it gyues sweetness to al manner of matters that it
is myngled with. And it is good for all manner of cold sickness / and namely
for the palsy / for quakynge of a man's lymmes / and for searching of a man's
senewes / and it is good against the cold gout / also it makes an old man
to seem yo^ge / also it stre^gtheth al manner of spirits within a man's body
when that he has dronken ^ quantyte thereof fasting / also it opens a
man's lust by the which he may the better here. It cleanses a man's sight.
And on wounds it freteth away the deed flesh. Also it destroys the Canker.

For to make Claret and Payment.
