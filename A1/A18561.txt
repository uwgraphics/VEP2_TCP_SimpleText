The double sorrow of Troylus to tell
King Pryamus sone of Troy
In loving / how his auentures fell
From woo to well / and after out of Joy
My purpos is / or that I part froye
Thesipho ne thou help me for to endyte
These woeful verses / that wepyn as I write
To the clepe I goddess of turment /
Thou cruel fury / sorowyng ever in pain
Help me that am the sorrowful instrument
That help lovers / as I can to plain
For well sit / the sooth for to said
A woeful wight / to have a drery fere
And to a sorrowful tale / a sorry chere
For I that god of louys seruauntis serve
Ne dar not love / for mine vnlyklynesse
Pray for speed / al should I therefore sterue
So fer am I / from his help in derknesse
But natheles / yif this may do gladness
To any lover / and his lady avail
Have he the thank / and mine be the travail
But ye loners that bathen in gladness
If any drope of pity in you be
Remember you in passyd heaviness
That ye han felt / and in the aduersite
Of other folk / and thynk how that ye
Have felt how love durst you dysplease
Or ye have won hem with to great ease
And pray for hem that been in the caas
Of Troylus as ye may after here
That love him bring / in heuene to solace
And eke for me prays / to god so dear
That I have might / to show in som^e manner
Such pain and woo / as louys seruau^tis endure
As in Troylus vnsely adventure
And byddyth eke for hem that been dyspayred
In love / that never will recovered be
And eke for them that falsely ben apeyred
Through wykked tunges / be yt he or she
Thus prays god / for his benygnyte
So grant him soon / out of this world to pace
That is dyspeyred out of louys grace
And byddyth eke for hem / that been at ease
That god grant hem ay / good^ perseueraunce
And send hem might / their ladies for to please
That is to love by worship and plesaunce
For so hope I my self best auaunce
To pray for hem that loves seruauntis be
And write their woo / and live in charity
And for to have on them compassioun
As though they were their own brethern dear
Now herkenyth with good entencioun
For now I will go straight to my matere
Iy which ye may the double sorrow here
Of Troylus in loving of Criseyde
And how she forsook him or he deyde
^T is well wist / how ye Grekis strong
In arms with a thousand ships went
To troy ward / and the cit^e long
Assyegid well t^n year or they stent
And in diverse wise / and oon intent
The rauysshyng to wreke / of Heleyne
By Paris don they wrought all their pain
Now fyl it so that in the town there was
Dwelling a lord of great auctoryte
A great deuynour / that clepyd was Calcas
That in science so expert was he
Knew well that Troy should destroyed be
By answer of his god / that hight thus
Dan Phoebus or Appollo Delphycus
So when calcas knew by calculyng
And eke by answer of this Apollo
That grekis should such a people bring
Through which that Troy must be fordo
He cast anon out of the town to go
For well he wys^e by sort that Troy should
Dystroyed be who so would or nolde
For which he thought to depart softly
Took purpos thus in full unknown wise
And to the grekis went full pryuely
He stale anon and they in curteys wise
Him dyden both worship and seruyse
In trust that he had connyng hem to read
In every peryle / which that stood in dread
Noise up roos when it was first espied
In all the town / and openly was spoken
That calcas traitor fled / was and alyed
To hem of greece / and cast was to be wroken
On him that falsely has his faith so broken
And said he and all his kynne attones
Were worthy to be brent both fell and bones
Now had Calcas left in this myschaunce
Vnwyst of this false and wykked deed
A daughter which that was in great penance
And of her life she was full sore in dread
And wist never what best was to read
And as a wydewe was she al alone
And ^yst to whom / she durst make her moan
Criseide was this ladies name a right
As to my dome in all Troyes city
Most fairest lady for passing every wight
So Aungelyk shone her natyf beauty
That thing none mortal femyd she
And there with was she so perfyte a creature
As she had be made in scornyng of nature
This lady that alday / herd at ere
Her fader shame / falshed and treason
Full nygh out of her wit / for sorrow and fere
In wydewes habyte large of samy te broun
Before Hector on knees she fyl adoun
His mercy lad / her self excusing
With pytous voys / and tenderly weeping
Now was this Hector pytous of nature
And saw that she was sorrowful bygon
And that she was so fair a cr^ature
O^ his goodness / he gladyd her anon
And said / late your faders treason gone
Forth with myschaunce and ye your self ^n Joy
(...) with us while your good list in troy
And al ye honor that men may do you have
As ^erforth as though your fader dwe^id here
Ye shul have / and your body shul men save
As fer as I may ought inquire and here
And she him thanked with full humble chere
And ofter would / and it ^^d ben his will
Took her leave went home / and held her still
And in her house abode with such meyne
As to her honor need was to hold
And while that she was dwelling in ye (...)
Kept her estate / and both of young and old
Full well be^uyd and men of her told
But whether she child had or non
I read it not / Therefore I let it gone
The things fyl as they don of wer^e
Betwyx hem of Troy and Grekis often
For som^e day bought they of Troy derre
And eft the Grekis found nothing soft
The folk of Troy / and thus fortune aloft
And vndyr eft began hem to repent both
After their course when they were wroth
But how this town com to destruction
Ne fallyth not to purpos me to tell
For it were here a long dygressioun
Fro my matyer / and you full long to dewlle
But the Trojan gestis as they tell
In Omere in Dares / or in Dyte
Who so that can may read hem as they write
And though ye greekis them of Troie shet^en
Had and their atre besiegyd al about
Yet for all their usage would they not letten
To worship and honor they goddis full devout
With most reverence in honor out of doubt
They worshypped a reliquyk callid Palladion
On whom was all their trust above echon
And so byfel when comen was the time
Of Apryll when clothyd is the m^de
With new grene of lusty veer the pryme
And sweet smellyng flowers white and read
In sundry wise showed as I read
The folk of Troy their obseruaunces old
Palladion feste went for to hold
Unto the temple in alther best wise
Generally their went many a wight
To berkene of Palladion service
And namely many a lusty knight
And many a lady fressh and maiden bright
Full well arrayed both mest and lest
Both for the season and the hye fest
Among thise other folk was Criseyda
In wydewes habyte black / but natheles
Right as our first lettir is now an A
In beawte first / so stood the makeles
Her goodly lookyng / gladdyd all the pres
Nas never seen thing to be preysed derre
Nor under clowd black so bright a sterre
As was Criseyde / as folk said echone
That her beheld in her black weed
And yet she stood full low and still alone
Behynd other folk in little bread
And nigh the door under shames dread
Simple of atyre / and debonayre of chyere
With full assuryd lookyng and manyere
This Troylus as he was wont to guide
His young knights lad hem up and down
In thyl^t large temple / on every side
Beholding ay the ladies of the town
Now here now there / for no deuocioun
Had he to none to reuen him his rest
But began to praise and last when him lest
And in hye walk full fast he began to wayten
If knight or sauyer / of his ^^mpanye
Began for to sigh / or let his ^yen ^^yten
On any womman that be could espy
He would smyle and hold it a folly
And said he^ thus god wot she slepith full s^ft
For love of you / when ye torn fut often
I have herd trl pardieu^ of yowre living
Ye lovers and eke your lewd obseruaunces
And which a labor / folk have in wynnyng
Of love and in the keeping which dout^lias
And when your pray is lost woe and p^naunces
O very foolis / blind and nyce be (...)
There is not one can ware by other be
And with y^ word he would cast up the browe
A staunce is this not well y spoken
At which the god of love began loken row
Right for despyte / and shoope to be wroken
He kyd anon / his low was not broken
For suddenly be hit him at the full
And yet as proud a pecok can he pull
O blind world / O blind entencioun
How often fallyth all theffes contrary
Of sur quydrye and foul presumpcioun
For caught is proud and caught is debonayre
This Troylus is clombyn on the stayre
And little wenyth that he shall descenden
But alday faylith thing / that foolis wenden
As proud bayard begynnyth for to skyp
Out of the way / so prykyth him his corn
Till he a lassh have of the long-whyp
Than thynkyth he though I praunce al byforn
First in the trays / full fat and new y shorn
Yet am I but an horse / and horses law
I must endure / and with my feeris draw
So fierd it by this fyers and proud kynyght
Though he a worthy king sons were
And wend nothing had had such might
Agenst his will that should his heart stere
Yet with a look his heart way a fuyre
That be that now was most in pride above
Wax suddenly most subgect unto love
For thy ensample take of this man
Ye wise proud and worthy folks all
To scorn love / which that so soon can
The fredom of yowre hertis to him thralle
For ever it was and ever be shall
That love is he / that all thing may bind
For noman may fordo the law of kind
That this is sooth is prouyd and does yet
For this trow I ye known all and som^e
Men reden not that folk have gretter wit
Than they yt han ben most with love y nome
And strengest folk be therwyth overcome
The worthyest and grettest of degree
This was and is / and yet men shul it fee
And trewly it fallyth well to be so
For alther wysest han therwyth ben pleasid
And they that han ben althermost in woo
With love have been conforted most and easid
And often it has the cruel heart apeasid
And worthy folk made worthyer of name
And causith most to dread vice and shame
Now since it may not goodely be wythstonde
And is a thing so virtuous in kind
Refusith not in love to bound
Since as him self list he may you bind
The yerd is better that bowen will and wind
Than that that brestith / and therefore I you read
To follow love / that you so well can led
But forth to tell / in especyal
As of this king sone of which I told
And let other things collateral
Of him thynk I my tale forth to hold
Both of his Joy and of his cares cold
And all his werkis towchnyg this matere
For there as I began I will thereto refere
Within the temple he went him forth pleyeng
This Troilus of every wight about
On this lady and now on that lokyng
Whether so she were of town or of without
And upon caas byfel that through a Yowte
His eye perad and so deep it went
Al on Criseide it smet and there it stent
And suddenly he wax therwyth astonyed
And began her bet behold in thryfty wise
O mercy god thought he / where have you woned
That art so fair and goodly to deuyse
Therwyth his heart began to sprede and rise
And soft sighed / lest men might him here
And caught again his first pleyeng chere
She was not with the least / of her stature
But all her lymmes / so well answeryng
Weren to wommanhode / that creature
Nas never less mannyssh in semyng
And eke the pure wise of her meuyng
Showed well that men might in her guess
Honor estate / and wommanly noblesse
Tho Troilns right wonderly well withal
Began for to like her meuyng and her chyere
Which sumdel deynous was for she leete fall
Her look a lyte aside in such manece
Askaunce what may I not stond here
And after that her lookyng began she light
Him never thought have seen so good a sight
And of her look in him there began quyken
So great desire / and such affectioun
That his heart bottum it began styken
Of her figure with deep oppressioun
And though he eerst had powered up and down
He was tho glad / his horns in to shrynke
Uneath wist he how to look or wynke
Lo he that leete him self so connyng
And scorned them that louys peynes dryen
Was full unware / that love has his dwelling
Within the subtyl streams / of her eyes
That suddenly him thought he should dyen
Right with her look the spyrit in his heart
Blissed he love / that can thus folk convert
She thus in black / lykyng to Troylus
Over al thing / he stood to behold
Ne his desire / ne wherefore he stood thus
He never chyere made / ne word told
But from after / his manner to behold
On other thing sometime his look he cast
And eft on her while the seruyse last
And after this not fully al awapyd
Out of the temple / al easily be went
Repentyng him that he had ever Iapyd
Of louie folk / lest fully the descent
Of scorn fyl on him self / but what he meant
Lest it were wist in any manner side
His woo he began dyssimulen / and to hyde
When he was fro the temple thus departed
He straight anon / unto his palace turnyth
Right with her look thurh shot and thurh dar tid
So feyneth he in lust / there he soiournyth
And al his chere and speech / also he bournyth
And ay of louys seruauntis / every while
Him self to wicke at hem he began to smple
And said lord so ye live all in lose
Ye lovers for the connyngest of you
That seruyth most ententysly and lest
Him t^^ thereof as often harm as prow
Your huyre is quyt again / ye god wot how
Not well for well / but scorn for good see nyce
In feyth your ordir is / r^^^d in goodely wise
In no certain ben al your obseruaun^^s
But it a sely feyre peyntes be
Ne nothing askyth so great attendaunces
As does your lay / and that known al ye
But that is not the worst so mo^e I the
But told I you the worst point I leave
All said I soth / ye would at me grieve
But take this that ye lovers often eschyewe
Or ellis don of good entrncioun
Full often your lady / will it mys conscriewe
And deem it harm / in her oppynyoun
And yet if she for other encheason
Be wroth th^ne shall you have a groyne (...)
Lord well is him / that may be of you (...)
But for all this / when that he saw his time
He held his peace noke other boot him gained
For love bygan his fethyrs for to lyme
That well uneath unto his folk he feyned
That other besy nedis / him dystrayned
For woe was him that what to do he nyst
But bad his folk go where that hem list
And when that he in chamber was alone
He down upon his beddis feet him set
And first he began do sigh / and eft to groan
And thought ay so on her / wythouten let
That as he sat and woke / his spirit met
That he her saw temple and all the guyse
Right of her look / and began it new advise
Thus began he make a myrrour of his mind
In which he saw al hool her figure
And that he well could / in his heart find
It was to him a right good adventure
To love such one / and if he did his cure
To seruen her yet might he fall in grace
Or ellis for one of her seruauntis pace
Imagynyng that travail ne grame
Ne might not for so goodely one be lorn
As she ne him for no desire ne shame
Al wers it wist / but in price up born
Of al lovers well more than byforn
Thus argued he in his beginning
Full unadvised of his woo coming
Thus took he purpos / louys craft to syewe
And thought he would work pryuely
First to hyde his desire in mewe
From every wight y born vttirly
But he might ought recovered be thereby
Remembryng him that love to wide y blow
Yeldith vetter fruit though sweet seed be sow
And over al this much more he thought
What for to speak / and what to hold ynne
And to art her to love he fought
And a song / anon right to begin
And began loud on his sorrow for to win
For with good hope / he began fully assent
Cryseyde for to love / and not to repent
And of his song not only the sentence
As writes mine auctour / called ^ollius
But pleynly save our tongues difference
I dare well say in all that Twylus
Seyde in his song ^o every word right thus
As I shall seyn / and who so list it ^err
Is next this verse ye may it fynden nere
If no love is / O god what ferle I so
And if love is what thing and which is he
If love be good from whens comyth my we
If it be wycke / a wondyr thynkyth me
When every ^^ment and aduersice
That comyth of him may to me sau^ry thynk
For ay thryse I the more that I it dryust
And if that at mine own lust I beenne
From whens comyth my wayllyng and my pleynt
If harm anger me / whereto pleyne I then
I note not why vnwery that I feynt
O quyst death / O s^bete harm so queynt
How may of the in me be such quantyte
But if I consent / that it so be
And if that I consent wrongfully
Conpleyne ywys / thus possid to and fro
Al styerles / within a boat am I
Amydde the sea betwyn wyndes two
That in contrary stondyn euermo
Alas what is this wondyr maladye
For hete of cold / for cold of hete I dye
And to the god of love thus said he
With pytous voys / O lord now yowre is
My spirit which that ought yowris be
You thank I lord / yt have me brought to this
But whether goddess or womman ywis
She be I note which that ye do me serve
But as her man I will ay live and sterue
Ye stonden in her eyes / myghtyly
As in a place / unto your virtue dygne
Therefore lord if my service or I
May like you / so be to me benygne
For mine estate Royal / I here resign
In to her hand / and with full humble chere
Bycome her man as to my lady dear
In him ne deyned to spare blood Royal
The fire of love wherfrom god me bless
Ne him forbear in no degree for all
his excellent or virtuous prowess
But held him as his thral / in love dystresse
And brent him so in sundry wise al new
That sixty time a day / he lost his hew
So much day from day / his own thought
For lust to her / began quyken and encreace
That every other charge he set at naught
For thy sul often / his hot fire to ceace
To see her goodly chere he began to preace
For thereby to be eased well he wend
And ay the nere he was / the more he brend
But when he had a space / from his care
Thus to him self / full often he began to pleyne
He said a fool / now art thou in the snare
That whylom Iapydest / at loves pain
Now art you bent / now gnaw thyn own cheyne
Thou were ay wont / each lover to reprehende
Of thing the which thou can the not defend
What will now every lover / say of the
If this be wist / but ever in thyn absence
Laugh in scorn / and sey lo where goth he
That is the man / of so great sapyence
That held us lovers / lest in reverence
Now thanked be god / he may go in the dau^ce
Of hem that love list / fyebly to auaunce
But o thou woeful Troylus god would
Sith thou must love / through thy destyne
That thou byset were / on such one that should
Know al thy woo / al lakked her pity
But also cold / in love towardis the
Thy lady is / as frost in winter moon
And thou for done as frost in winter soon
God would I were aryued in the port
Of death the which / my sorrow will me led
A lord to me it were a great comfort
Than were I quyte of langusshyng in dread
For by mine hyd sorrow y blown in bread
I shall y iaped be / a thousand time
More than a fool of whose folly men ryme
But now help god / and ye sweet for whom
I pleyne / y caught ye never wight so fast
O mercy dear heart / and help me from
The death / for I while my life may last
More than my self will love you to my last
And with some friendly look / gladith me sweet
Though never nothing more ye me byheete
These wordis / and full many another to
He spack and callid ever in his compleynt
Her name for to tellyn her / he is woo
Till nygh that he in salt teris dreynt
Al was for naught / she herd not his pleynt
And when that he bethought / on that folly
A thousand fold / his woo began multiplye
By waylyng in his chamber / thus alone
A friend of his / that callid was Pandare
Come oones in / and herd him groan
And saw his friend / in such dystres and care
Alas quod he / who causith all this fare
O mercy god / what unhap may this mean
Hane now thus soon / greekis made you lene
Or have thou som^e remors / of conscience
And art now fallen / in som^e deuocioun
And waylest for thy sin and for thyn offense
And have for fere / caught contricioun
God save hem that bysieged have this town
That so can leye / our Io^te on press
And bring our lusty folk / to holiness
These wordis said he / for the nones all
That with such thing he might him a^gry make^
And with his anger / do his sorrow fall
As for the time / and his courage awaken
And well wist he / as fer as tunges spaken
There nas a man of gretter hardynesse
Than he / ne no more desired worthynesse
What caas quod Twilus tho / or what adventure
Has guyded the / to see me languysshyg
That am refuse / of every creature
But for the love of god / at my prayeng
Go hens away / for certis my deyeng
Will the disease / and I mote nedis deye
Therefore go hens / there is no more to seye
But if thou wene / I be thus sike for dread
It is not so / and therefore scorn me naught
There is another thing I take of heed
Well more tha^ ought the grekis han yet wrought
Which cause is of my death / sorrow and thought
But though I now tell it the ne lest

This were a wounder thing / quod Troylus

Ye ^^ylus harken now / quod Pandare
Though I be nyce / it happith often so
That oon that excess does / full euylfare
By good counsayl / can keep his friend therfro
I have my self seen a blind man go
There as he fyl / that cowde look wide
A fool may eke / a wise man often guide
A wheston / is no keruyng instrument
But yet it makyth / sharp keruyng coolis
And there thou woost / that I have myswent
Eschiew thou that / for such thing to scoole is
Thus often wise men / ben ware by foolis
If thou do so / thy wit is well bewarid
By his contrary / is every thing declarid
For how might ever / swetnesse be know
To him that never / tastid bytternesse
Ne noman may / be inly glad I trow
That never was in sorrow / or som^e dystresse
Eke white by black / by shame eke worthynesse
Each set by other / more for othyr semyth
As men may see / and so the wise it demyth
Sith thus of two contraryes / is oo lore
A that have so often / in love assayed

And eeke the not ought / be evil apayed
Though I desire / with the for to bear

As to thy brother Paris / and a pryncesse
Which that y clepyd was Oenont
Wrote in a compleynt / of her heaviness

Nay never yet ywys / quod Troylus
Now quod Pandare / harken it was thus

Quod she that cowd / in every wyghtis (...)
Remedy and read / by herbis he knew fine
Yet to him self / his connyng was full lure
For love had him / bound in a snare
Al for the daughter of the king Am^^^
That all his craft / no cowd^ his sorrows beat
Right so fare I / unhappily for me
A love one best / and that me smertyth fore
And yet perauenture can I reden the
And not my self / repreue me no more
A have no cause I wot well for to fore
As does an hawke / that lysteth for to ^bey
But to thyn help / somewhat can I sey
And of o thing / right siker may thou be
That certain for to dyen in the pryne
That shall I never more / dyscou^ren the
Ne by my trowth / I ^^epe not restreyne
The from thy love / though that it there Heleynt
That to thy brothyrs wife / if I it wist
Be what she be / and love her as the list
Therefore as frendfully / in me assure
And tell me plat now / what is thencheson
And fynal cause / of woo that ye endure
For douthyth nothing / my en^encion
Nys nor to you / of reprehension
To speak as now / for no wight may byreue
A man to love / till that him list to leave
And wit well / that both two ben vices
Mystrust al / o^ ellis al to leave
But well I wot / the mean of it no vice is
For to trust som^e wight / it is a preue
Of trowth and for thy / would I feign remeue
Thy wrong conceyt / and do the somewhat tryst
Thy woo to tell / and tell me if the list
The wise seyth / woo him that is alone
For if he fall / he has no help to rise
And since thou have a fellow / tell thy moan
For this is not certain the next wise
To wynnen love / as rechen us the wise
To walewe and weep / as Nyobe the queen
Whose teens yet in marbyl stone be seen
Late be thy weeping / and thy drerynesse
And let us l^ssen woo / with our speech
So may thy woeful time / seem less
Delight not in woo / thy woo to seche
As don these fools / that their sorrows each
With sorrow / when they have mysauenture
And list not to seche hem / othyr cure
Men seyn / to wretchis is consolacioun
To have anothyr fel^w in his pain
That ought well be / our oppynyoun
For both thou and I / for love we pleyne
So full of sorrow am I soth to seyne
That certainly nomoore hard grace
May sit on me / for why there is no space
If god will thou art not aghast of me
Lest I would of thy lady the begyle
Thou wost thy self whom that I love parde
As I best can / goon since long while
And since thou woost / I do it for no wyle
And seyst I am he / thou trustist most
Tell me somewhat / since al my wit thou woost
Yet Troylus for all this / no word said
But long he lay stylle / as he deed were
And after this / with sighyng he abreyde
And to pandarus voice / he leyd his eve
And up his eyes cast he / that in fere
Was Pandarus / lest that in frenesye
He should fall / or ellis soon dye
And cried awake full wonderly and sharp
What slombryst thou / an in a lytargy
Or art thou like / an Ass unto the harp
That herith sown / when men the strings plye
But in his mind of that no melodye
May synken in / to gladden for that he
So dull is of his bestialyte
And with that Pandare / of his wordis stent
And Troylus yet him / nothing answered
For thy to tellen / was not his intent
Never to noman / for whom he so ferd
For it is said / men make often a yerd
With which the maker / is him self y betyn
In sundry manner as these wise tretyn
And namely / in his counsayl tellyng
That touchyth love / that ought to be secre
For of him self / it will enough out spryng
But if that it / the bet governed be
Eke sometime it is craft to seem fle
For thing which in effect / men huntyn fast
Al this began Troylus / in his heart cast
But nevertheless / when he had herd him cry
Awake he began / and sighed wonder sore
And said friend / though that I stylle lie
I am not deef / now peace and cry no more
I have herd thy wordis / and thy lore
But suffer me / my myschyef to bewaylen
For thy prouerbis / may me not auaylen
None other cure can thou for me
Eke I will not be curid / I will deye
What know I of the queen Nyobe
Eat be thyn old ensamples I the preye
No quod pandare therefore I seye
Such is delight of foolis to bywepe
Her woe but seek boot they ne keep
Now know I that reason in the faylyth
But tell me / if I wist what she were
For whom that the all this mysauenture aylyth
Durst thou that I told it in her eere
Thy woo since thou dare not thy self for fere
And her besought / on the to have som^e rowth
Why nay quod he / by god and by my trowth
What not as busily quod pandarus
As though mine own life lay in this need
No certis brother quod this Troylus
And why / for that thou should never speed
Woost thou not well / ye that is out of dread
Quod troylus for all that ever ye conne
She nyl to no such wretch as I be won
Quod pandarus alas what may this be
That thou dyspayrid art thus causeles
What lyuyth not thy lady benedicite
How woost thou so / that thou art graceles
Such evil is not always booteles
Why put not impossible thus thy cure
Sith thing to come is / often has adventure
What should he therefore fall in dyspeyre
Or be recreaunt / for his own teene
Or sle him self / al be his lady feyre
Nay nay but ever in oon be fressh and grene
To serve and love / his dear hertis queen
And thynk it is a gwerdon for to serve
A thousand fold more than he can deserve
And of that word took heed Troylus
And thought anon / what folly he was in
And how that soth him said Pandarus
That for to sle him self / might he not win
But both do vnmanhod / and a sin
And of his does / his lady not to wide
For of his woo god woot she knew but lyte
And with that thought / he began full sor^ (...)
And said alas / what is me best to do
To whom pandare / answered if the like
The best is / that thou tell me al thy woo
And have my troth / but thou find it so
A be shy boot / or that it be full long
And ellis ^o p^as / do me draw and ^^ng
Yeso s^yst thou / quod Troylus tho al^^
But god wot / it is not the rather so
Full hard wot it / to helpen in this ca^
For well find I / that fortune is my foo
Ne all the men that ryden conne or goo
May of her cruel w^^le the harm withstonde
For as she lyse, she pleyth with for and (...)
I grant well if at thou endurist woo
As sharp as does Tiaue in best
Whoo stomach fowlio tyr^n euermo
That hight vulturre / as books (...)
But I may not endure / that thou dwell
In so an unskillful oppynyon
That of thy woo is no cumaon
But oones nyltow / for thy coward lert
And for thyn ite / and foolissh wylfulnesse
For wantrust tell of thy woundis smert
Ne to thyn own help / do business
As much as speak a reason / more on less
But lyggese as he that list of nothing ret^^^
What womman could love such a wretch
What may she deem / othyr of thy death
If thou thus dye / and she note why it is
But that for dread is yolden up thy breath
For Greekis han bysegyd us ywys
Lord such a thank shall thou have of this
Thus will she say / and all the town atones
The wretch is ded / the devil have his bones
Thou may alone here weep kne^^ and cry
But love a womman that she wot it^ naught
And she shall quyte it / thou shall it not espy
Unknow vnkyst / and lost that is unsought
What many a man has love / full dear y bought
Twenty winter / that his lady ne wist
That never yet his lady mouth he kyst
Quod pandarus thou blamest fortune
For thou art wroth / now at erst I see
Wost thou not well that fortune is comune
To every manner wight / in som^e degree
And yet thou have this comfort ^o parde
So as her Joys must ouergon
So must her sorrows passen euerychon
For if her whele stynt any thing to torn
Than scaceth she anon fortune to be
Now since her whele by no way may so^ourne
What woost thou / of her mutabilite
Right as thy self lyse / she will do by the
Or if she be not seen at thyn helpyng
Perauenture thou have cause for to sing
And therefore woost thou what I the beseech
Late be thy woo / and turnyng to the ground
For who so list have helpyng of his leche
To him byhouyth first / vnkouer his wound
To cerberus in hell / ay be I bound
Were it for my sustre / al thy sorrow
By my will she should be thyn to morrow
Look up I say / and tell me what she is
Anon that I may goo about thy need
Know I her not for my love tell me this
Than would I hope rather for to speed
Tho began the veins of troylus to bleed
For he was hit and wax all read for shame
A ha quod Pandare / here begynnyth the game
And with that word he began him to shake
And said thyef thou shall her name tell
But tho began sely Troylus to quake
As thought ye men should have led him to hell
And said alas / of all my woo the well
That (...) she my sweet callid Cr^seyde
And with that word / for few nygh he deyde
And when pandar^ herd him her name (...)
Lord he was glad / and said friend so (...)
Now fare a right / for Io^^^ name in (...)
Love has be set the well be of good (...)
For of good name / wysedom and (...)
She has enough / and eke of gentylnesse
If she be fair / thou woost thy self I guess
Never saw I none more boun^^uous
Of her estate ne gladder of speech
A frendlyer / ne more gracious
For to do well ne basse had need to s^che
What to for to done / and al this bet to each
In honor to as f^r as she may stretche
A kings heart seems by hyre a wretch
And also thynk / and therwyth glad the
That sith thy lady virtuous is al
So folowyth it / that there is some pity
Among all these other in general
And for thy see that in especial
Require not that is against her name
For virtue stretchyth not him self to shame
Now beat thy breast / and seye to god of love
Thy grace lord / for now I me repent
If I myspack before now my self I love
Thus seye with all thyn heart in good intent
Quod Troylus / a lord I me consent
And pray to the / my Iapis to foryeue
And I shall neuermore while I live
Thou say well quod pandare / now I hope
That thou the goddis wrath have apeased
And sith thou have wept many a drope
And said such thing wherewith thy god is pleasid
Now would never god / but thou were casid
And thynk well she of whom rist al thy woo
Here a fore / thy confort may be also
For thilk ground / that berith the weedis wycke
Beryth este the holsom herbis full often
Next the foul nettyl rowgh and thycke
The rose wexith sweet / smoth and soft
And next the valey / is the hyl alofte
And next the derk night / is the glad morrow
And also Joy is next thend of sorrow
Now book that attempre be thy brydel
And for the best / ay suffer to the tyd
Or ellis all our labor / is al ydel
He hastyth well / that wisely can abide
Be dylygent and true / and always hyde
Be lusty fre / persevere in thy seruyse
And al is well / if thou werk in thy wise
The time thou may blis / that ever you were born
And the goddis thank / that in so good a place
Have the bistowed in love / I durst have sworn
That you should never have had / so fayce a grace
And why for thou were ever wont to chase
At love in scorn / and for dyspyte hem call
Delyuere the world / lord of this foolis all
When Toylus had herd / Pandare assentyd
To be his help in loving of Criseyde
Way of his woo / as who says vnturmentid
But hott^^ wax his love / and than he seyde
With sobre chere / as though his heart had pleyde
Now blysful venus / help or that I sterus
Of the Pandare / I may som^e thank deserve
But dear friend how shall my woo be less
Till this be don / and good eke trl me this
How wylt thou sey / of me and my dyscresse
Lest she be wroth / thye dread I most ywis
Or will not here / or trowen how it is
All this dread I / and eke for the manner
Of the her Eme / she will no such thing here
Quod Pandarus / thou have full great care
Lest that the chorle / fall over of the moon
Why lord I hate of the / thy nyce fare
What entre^et^ of that / thou have to done
For goddis love / I bide the a boon
So let me alone / and it shall be thy feste
What friend quod be now / do right as the least
But herk / Pandare / o word for I nold
That thou in me / wendyst so great folly
That to my lady / I desire should
That touchyth harm / or any vylonye
For dredeles / me were lever dye
Than she of me / ought ellis vndirstoode
But that / that might sown in to good
Tho lowgh this pandare / and anon answerd^
And I thy borow / fie no wight does but so
I tought not / though she stood and herd
How that thou seyst / but fare well I will go
Adieu be glad / god speed us with two
Give me this labor / and this besinesse
And of my speed / be thyn all the swetnesse
Tho Troilus began down / on his knees fall
And Pandare in his arms / hent fast
And said now fie on the grekis all
Yet parde god shall help us at the last
And dredeles if that my life may last
And god to forn / yet som^e of hem shall smert
And yet me athynketh this auaunt me astert
Now pandarus / I can no more seye
But thou wise / you wost / thou may / thou art al
My life my death / hool in thyn hand I leye
Help now quod he / yis by my trowth I shall
God yield the friend / and this in special
Quod Troylus / that thou me recomanude
To her that may me / to death comaunde
This Pandarus / tho desirous to serve
His full friend / tho said in this manner
Farwell and thynk I will / thy thank deserve
Have here my trowth / and that thou shall well here
And went his wey / thynkyng on this matere
And how he might best / byseche her of grace
And find a time herto / and a place
For every wight / that has an house to found
Ne rennyth not / the work for to begin
With rakil hand / but he will bide a stound
And send his hertis line / out from wythynne
Altherfirst his purpos for to win
Al this Pandare / in his heart thought
And cast his werk full wisely or he wrought
But Troylus tho / lay no longer down
But up anon upon his steed bay
And in the feld he pleyeth the lyoun
Woe was the greek / that met with him that day
And in the town / his manerr he holdyth ay
So goodely he was / and gate him so in grace
That each him loved / that lokid in his face
For he become / the frendlyest knight
The gentyllest / and eke the most fre
The thryftyest and one the best wight
That in his time / was or might be
Ded were his Iapis / and his cruelte
His hye port / and his manner strange
And each of tho / began for a virtue change
Now let us stynt of Troylus a stounde
That farith like a man / that hurt is sore
And is somdele of akynge of his wound
Y lyssed well / but helid no del more
And as an esy pacyent / the lore
Abydyth of him that goth about his cure
And thus be dryuyth forth his adventure
Here ends the first book
And begins the prologe of the secunde book
OWte of thise black wawes / for to sail
O wind the wedir / begins to clear
For in this see / ye bote has such travail
Of my connyng / that uneath I it stere
This see clepe I / the tempestous matere
Of dyspeyre / that Troylus was ynne
For now of hope the kalendis begin
O lady mine / that callid art Cleo
Thou be my speed fro this forth / and my muse
To Ryme well this book / till I have do
Me needs here / none other art to use
For why to every lover I me excuse
That of no sentement / I this endyte
But out of latin / in to my tunge I write
Wherefore I will have / neither thank ne blame
Of al this werk / but prey you mekely
Dysblameth me / if any word be lame
For as mine auctour says / so sey I
Eke though I speak / of love vnfelyngly
No wonder is / for it of thing now new is
A blind man can not well Judge in hewis
I know eke that in form of speech / is change
Wythyn a thousand year / of wordis tho
That hadden pry^^ / ben now nyce and strange
Us thinks hem / and yet they spack hem so
And sped as well in love / as men now do
Eke for to win love / in sundry ages
An sundry ^ondes / sundry ben vsages
And for thy if it hap / in any wise
That there be any lover / in this place
That herkenyth as the story can deuyse
How Troylus come / to his lady grace
And thynkith s^ nold I / love purchase
Or wondryth on his speech / or doing
I not but unto me / it is no wondryng
For every wight / which that to rome went
Holt not oo path / ne always oo manner
Eke in som^e bond / were all the game y shent
If they ferd in love / as men don here
As thus in open doing / and in chere
In vysityng in form / or said our sawes
For why men seyn / each contre has his laws
Eke scarsly be there in this place three
That have in love said like / and don al
For to thy purpos this may like the
And the right naught / yet al is said and shall
Eke some men grave / in the stone wall
As it betyd but since I have bygonne
Mine auctor shall I follow if that I conne
Here ends the prologe
And here begins the second book
IN may that modir is of monethis glade
That fressh flowris / blew whet and trede
Ben quykened ageyn / yt wi^ert deed made
And full of baume / is fletyng every mede
When phoebus does / his bright beams spaede
Right in the white boole / it is betyd
As I shall sing / on Mayes day the thryd
That pandarus / for all his wise speech
Felt eke his part / of loves (...) been
That cowde he never / so well of loving preche
It made his hew / sul often a day green
Shoope him that day / there fyl him a trene
In love for which / to be ded / he went
And made or it was day full many a went
The swalow Proigne / with a sorrowful lay
When morrow come / made her waymentyng
Why she forshape was / and all the lay
Pandare a bed halt in a slomb^yng
Till she so nyh him / made her chy^^ryng
How Ter^us began forth / her sus^^r take
That with the noise of her he began awake
And began to call / and dress him to rise
Remembryng him / his ^^^nd was to done
From Troylus / and eke his grede empryse
And case and knew / in good plice was the moon
To do viage / and took his wey full soon
Unto his neas paleys / there beside
Now Ianus god of enter / thou him guide
When he was come / unto his neas place
Where is my lady to her folk quod he
And they him told / and he forth in began pace
And fond two othyr ladies / sit and she
Within a paued parlour / and they three
Herd hem a maiden / redyng the gest
Of the siege of thebes while hem lest
Quod Pandarus / madame god you see
With your book / and all the company
Ey uncle now / welcome ywis quod she
And us she Ros / and by the hond in hy
She took him fast / and said thus night thry
To good mote it turn / of you I met
And with that word / she down on be^che him set
Ye nece ye shul fare / well the bet
If god will / al this year quod Pandarus
But I am sorry / that I have you let
To harken on your book / ye praysen thus
For goddys love what says it / tell it us
Is it of love / or som^e good thing ye me lere
Uncle quod she your maystres is not here
With that they gonne laugh / and tho she said
This romance is of Thebes / that we read
And we han herd / hou that king layus deyde
Through Edippus his sone and all that deed
And here we stynt / at these lettres read
How the bishop as the book can tell
Amphiorax fyl through the ground to hell
Quod pandarus al this know I my selue
And all the fleges of thebes / and the care
For hereof ben therr / books made twelve
But let be this / and tell me how ye fare
Do way your wympyl / and show your face bare
Do way your book / rise up and let us dance
And let us do to may / som^e obseruaunce
Ey god forbede quod she / be ye mad
Is that a wydewes life / so god you save
By god ye maken me / right sore adrad
Ye be so wyeld / it seems as ye rave
It sit me well bet / to be in a cave
To bid and read / on holy saints lives
Late maidens go dance / and young wives
As ever thryue I / quod thy^ pandarus
Yet couthe I (...) a thing / to do your ^^rt (...)
Now uncle dear quod she / tell it ve
For goddis love / is than the syege awey
I am of the Grrel^is / so ferd that I dey
Nay nay quod (...) / as ever more I thryue
It is a thing well bet / than such five
Ye holy god quod she / what thyng^ to that
What bet than such ^yue / nay ywys
For all this world / ne can I read what
It shall be som^e ^ape / I trow it is
And but your self us crl / what it is
My wit to arrde it / is al to seen
Ao help me god I no^^ what ye mean
And I your borow / ne never shall quod ^e
This thing be told to you / so most I thryue
And why so uncle mine / why so quod she
By god quod he / that will I trl as ^lyue
For prowder wo^man / is there none on live
And ye it wist / in all the ^owne of Troy
I lie not / so ever have I Joy
Tho began she wonder / more than byforn
A thousand fold / and down her eyes cast
For never since the time / she was born
To know a thing / desired she so fast
And with a sigh / she said him at the last
Now uncle mine / I will you not dysple ase
Ne axe thing / that may do you disease
So aftir this / with many wordis glade
And friendly talis / and with merry chere
Of this and that / they gonne pley and wade
In many vncowth glad and deep matere
As frendis don / when they ben met in feere
Till she began ask him / how that Hector ferde
That was the wall of Troy / and greekis yerde
Full well I thank it god / quod Pandarus
Save in his arm / he has a little wound
And eke his fressh brothyr Troylus
The wise worthy / Hector the secunde
In whom that every virtue / list habounde
As al trowth / and al gentylnesse
Wysdom honor / fredom and worthynesse
In good feyth Eme quod she / that lykith me
They faren well / god save hem both two
For trewly / I hold it great deynte
A kings sone / in arms well to do
And be of good conditions thereto
For great power / and moral virtue here
Is seldom seen / in oo person y feere
In good feyth / that is sooth quod Pandarus
But by my troth / the king has sons twey
That is to say / Hector and Troylus
That certainly though that I should deye
They ben us void / of vices dar I sey
As any men / that lyuen under the son
Their might is wide known / and what they ko^ne
Of Hector nedyth nothing for to tell
In all this world / there nys a bettir knight
Than he that is of worthynesse well
And he well more virtue has / than might
This knowith many a wise / and worthy knight
The same price of Troylus I sey
God help me so / I know not such twey
By god quod she / of Hector that is sooth
Of Troylus the same thing trow I
For dredeles / men tellith that he does
In arms day by day / and that so worthyly
And berith him here at hom so gentylly
To every wight that oueral price has he
Of hem that were me leuest praised be
Ye sey right soth ywis / quod Pandarus
For yesterdaye / who has with him ben
Might have woundred / upon Troylus
For never yet so thyk a swarm of leen
As than the Grekis / from him began fleen
And through the feld in every wyghtis eve
There nas no cry / but Troylus is there
Now here now there / he hunted hem so fast
There nas but Grekis blood / and Troylus
Now him he hurt / and now him down he cast
Ay where he went it was arayeed thus
He was their death / and sheld and life for us
That as that day / there durst none wythstonde
While he held / his blody swerd in hond
Thereto he is the frendelyest man
Of great estate / that ever I saw in my fine
And where him list / best felawshyp can
To such as him thynkyth / able for to thryue
And with that word / tho Pandarus as blyue
Took of them leave / and said he would gone hen
Nay blame have I mine uncle quod she then
Whot eyleth you to be thus weary soon
And namely of wymmen will ye so
Nay sittyth down by god I have to done
With you to speak / of wysdom or ye go
And every wight / that was about hem tho
That herd that / began for awey to stand
While they two had / all that hem le^t on hand
When that her tale / brought was to an end
Of her estate and her governance
Quod Pandarus / now is time I wend
But now I sey arise / and let us dance
And cast your wydewes habyte / to myschau^ce
What list you thus / your self to dyffygure
Sith you is betid / so glad an adventure
A well bythought / for love of god quod she
Shall I not wit / what ye mean of this
No this thing askyth / leyser quod he
And eke me would / much grieve ywys
If I it told / and ye took it amys
Yet were it bet / my tung for to stylle
Than sey a thing / that were again your ^ille
For nece by the goddess Minerue
And Iubiter / that makyth the thunder to ryng
And by the blysful Venus / that I serve
Ye be the womman / in this world living
Without peramours / to my wytyng
That I best love / and bothest am to grieve
And that ye wyten well / your self I leeue
Ywis mine uncle / quod she grantmercy
Your frendshyp have I founden ever yet
I am to noman / holden trewly
So much as you / and have so lytyl quyt
And with grace of god / with my full wit
As in my gylt / I shall you never offend
And if I have or this / I will amend
B^th not aghast / ne quakyth not whereto
Ne chaungyth not for fere / so your hew
For hardily the worst of this is do
And though my tale be now / as to you new
Yet trust always / ye should find me true
And were it thing / me thought vnsittyng
To you would I / no such talis bring
Now my good Eame / for goddis love I prey
Quod she come of / and tell me what it is
For both I am aghast / what ye will sey
And eke me longyth / to wit ywis
For whether it be well / or be amys
Sey and late me not / in this fere dwell
So will I do now herkyn I shall tell
Now nece mine / the kings de^e sone
The good wise worthy / fressh and fre
Which always for to do well / is his wone
The noble Troylus / so loves the
That but ye help / it will his baane be
Lo here is al / what should I more seye
Do what ye list / make him live on deye
And if ye let him deye / I will steruen
Have here my trowth / nyl I not lain
Al should I with this ^^^yf / my throat ^eruen
With that trene / brost out of his eyes
And said / if that ye do us both dyen
What mean ye though we both apayre
Thus gylilis / than love ye fysstred fair
Alas be which (...) / my lord so dear
That crew man / that noble knight
That naught des^^eth / but yowre friendly chere
I see him deye / there he goes upright
And baseyth him / with al his full might
For to be slain / if his fortune assent
Alas that god such a beauty you sent
If it be so / ye so cruel be
That of his death / ye list not to retche
That is so true / and worthy as we see
No More than of a Iaper / or of a wretch
If ye be such / yowre beawte may not s^retch
To make amends / of so cruel a deed
Auysement is good / before the need
Woe worth / the fair Gemme vertules
Woe worth that herke / that does no bote
Woe worth that beauty / that is rowthles
Woe worth that wight / that each tret vndirfoote
And ye that be / of beauty crop and root
If that wythal in you be no rowth
Than is it harm / ye lyuen by me troth
And also thynk well that this is no gawde
For me were lever / you and I and he
Were banged / than I should be his bawd
As hye as any man / might on us see
I am thyn Eame / the shame were to me
As well as thyn / if that I should assent
Through my counsayl / that he thyn honor shent
Now understand / for I not requere
To bynd you to him / by no byhest
But only that ye make him better chere
Than ye have don or this / and make him more fest
So that his life be saved / at the lest
This is al and som^e / and plainly our intent
God help me so / I never other meant
Lo this request / is not but skyl ywys
Ne doubt of treason parde is there none
I set the worst / that ye dredden this
Men would woundre / to see him come and gone
There against / answer I thus anon
That every wight / but he be fool of kind
Will deem it love / and frendshyp in his mind
What who will deem / though he see a man
To temple go / that he the image etyth
Thynk eke how well / and wisely that he can
Govern him self / that he nothing foryetith
That where he comyth / the price and thank he getith
And eke thereto / he shall come here so seld
What fors were it / if all the town beheld
Such love of frendis / regneth in all this town
And wry you in that mantel / euerine
And god so wysly / be my saluacioune
As I have said you / best is to do so
But good nece always to stynt his woe
So let your danger / sugrid be alyte
That of his death / ye be not to wit
Criseyde which that herd him / in this wist
Thought I shall fool / what ye mean ywis
Now Eame quod she / what will ye deuyse
What is your read / I should do of this
That is well said quod he / certain best is
That ye him love again for his loving
As love for love / is skillful gwerdonny^g
Thynk eke how ^eld / wostith every hour
In each of you / a party of beauty
And therefore or that age / you devour
So love / for old there will no wight of the
Late this prouer^ / a lore unto you be
To late I ware / quod beauty when it is past
And aage dauntyth / danger at the last
The kings fool / is wont to cry loud
When that him thynkith / a wo^man beri^h her hye
So long more ye live / and al proud
Till crowee feet / ben wax vndyr your eye
And send you than / a myrrour in to p^ye
In which that ye may / see your face a morrow
I bid than wysshe you / nomo^e sorrow
With this he stynt / and cast down the head
And she began / to breast to weep anon
And said alas / for woe why ner I deed
For of this world / the feyth is al gone
Alas what should / a stranger to me don
When he that for my best / friend I wend
Will make me love / and should me defend
Alas I would have trustid dou^eles
That if I that / through my dysauenture
Had louyd him othyr Achylles
Hector or any man's creature
Ye nold have had / no mercy ne mesure
On me but alwey / had me in repreue
This false world alas / how may it leave
What is this al / the Joy and the feast
Is this your read / is this your blysful caas
Is this the vemy mede / of your byhest
Is al this peynted process / come to this alas
Right for this fine / O lady mine Pallas
Thou in this drdeful cas / for me purueys
For so astonyed am I / that I deye
With that she began sorowfully to syke
And may it be not bet / quod Pandaus
By god I shall no more / come here this wyke
And god toforn / that am mystrusted thus
I see well that ye set little of us
Or of our death / Alas I woeful wretch
Might he yet live / of me is not to retche
O cruel god / o dyspytous mart
O furyes three of hell on you I cry
So let me never / out of this house depart
If that I meant harm or vylonye
But since I see / my lord mote nedis dye
And I with him / here I me shryue and seye
That wyckedly / ye do us both deye
But since it lykyth you / that I be ded
By Neptunus / that god is on the sea
Fro this forth / shall I never ete bread
Till I mine own / heart blood may see
For certain I will dye as soon as he
And up he stert / and on his wey he raught
Till she ageyn him / by the lap caught
Criseyde with that / full ny starf for fere
So as she was / the ferdfullest wight
That might be / and herd eke with her ere
And saw the sorrowful ernest / of the knight
And in his prayer / eke saw none unright
And for the harm / that might eke fall more
She began to rewe / and dred her wonder sore
And thought thus vnhappis fallen thyk
Alday for love / in such manner caas
As men ben cruel / in hem self and wyk
And if this man sle him self alas
In my presence / if will be no solas
What men will it deem / I can not sey
It nedyth me / full wisely to pley
And with a sorrowful syke / she said thry
A lord what me is tyd / a sorry chance
For mine estate lies in Iuparty
And eke mine Eames life / lyth in balaunce
But natheles / with goddis governance
I shall so do / mine honor shall I keep
And eke his life / and stynt for to weep
Of harms two / the less is for to chese
Yet had I lever / make him good chere
In honor than mine own / eames life to leese
Ye sey ye nothing / ellis requere
Nowis quod he / mine own nece dear
Now well quod she / and I will do my pain
I shall mine heart / against my lust constrayne
But that I nyl not / holdyn him in hand
Ne love a man / ne can I not ne may
Against his will / but ellis will I fond
Mine honor save / please him from day to day
Thereto nold I not oones / have said nay
But that I dread / as in his fantasy
But cease the cause / cesith the malady
But here I make a protestacion
That in this process / or ye further go
That certainly / for no salvation
Of you though that ye sterue both two
And all the world on a day / be my fooo
Ne shall I never of him / have other rowth
I grant well quod Pandare / by my trowth
But may I trust well to you / quod he
That of this thing / that ye have hight me here
Ye will holden trewly / unto me
Ye doubt it not quod she my uncle dear
Ne that I shall have cause in this matrre
Quod he to pleyne / or ofter you to preche
Why no parde what nedyth more speech
Tho fyllen they / in other talis glade
Till at the last / o good Eame quod she tho
For his love / which us both made
Tell me how first / ye wysten of his woo
Wot none of it but ye / he said no
Can he well speak of love / quod she I you prey
Tell me for I the bet / shall me pouruey
Tho pandarus / a little began to smyle
And said by my troth / I shall you tell
This othyr day / not go full long while
Within the gardyn paleys / by a well
Began he and I / half a day to dwell
Right for to speak / of an ordinance
How we the Grekis might dysauaunce
Soon after that we began to lepe
And cast with our ^^rtis / to and fro
Till at the last he said he would sleep
And on the gras / adoun he leyd him tho
And I after / began rome to and fro
Till that I herd / as I walkid alone
How he bygan / full woefully to groan
Tho began I stalk him / softly behynd
And sikyrly / the footh for to said
As I can clepe again to my mind
Right thus to love / began him for to pleyne
He said lord have rowth / upon my pain
Al have I be rebel / in mine intent
Now mea culpa / lord I me repent
O god / that thy dysposicion
Ledyst the fine / by Just puruyaunce
Of every wight / my low confess on
A corpt in gre / and send me such penance
As lykith the / but from desperaunce
Late not my ghoost / depart away from the
Thou be my sheld / for thy benygnyte
For c^rti^ lord so sore has she me woundyd
That stood in black / with lookyng of her eyes
That to mine her^o bottum / it is foundyd
Through which I wot / that I must nedis d^yen
This to the worst / I dar not bewrepe^
And well the hotter / ben the gl^dis read
That men hem wryen with ass^^n pale and deed
With that he smote his ^ed / down anon
And began to moe^^ / I not what trewly
And I with that / began still away to gone
And let the^^f / as nothing wist had I
And come ageyn anon / and stood him by
And said awake / ye slepen alto long
It seems not that love doeith you (...)
That slepyn so that noman may you wa^^
Who saw ever on this so dull a man
Ye friend quod he / do ye your ^eedis ale
For love and let me / lyuen as I can
But though that ^e for woe / wae pale and wan
Yet made he tho / as fresshe a contenaunce
As though he should have l^d the dance
This passid forth / till now this other day
It fell that I come romyng al alone
In to his chamber / and found how that he lay
Upon his bed but man so sore groan
Ne herd I never / ne what was his moan
Ne wist I not for as I was coming
Al suddenly he left his compleynyng
Of which I took somewhat suspection
And nere I come / and fond he wept sore
And god so wys / be my salvation
Never yet of thing / had I rowth more
For another with engyne / ne with lore
Vnne this might I from the death him keep
That yet feel I for him / mine heart weep
And god wot / never since that I was born
Was I so besy / no man to preche
Ne never was to wight / so deep y sworn
Or he me told / who might be his leche
But now to rehersen al his speech
Or al his woeful wordis / for to sown
Ne bid me not but ye will see me swowne
But for to save his life and ellis naught
And to none harm of you / thus am I driven
As for the love of god / that us has wrought
Such chere him does / as he and I may louen
Now have I plat to you / mine heart shryuen
And since ye wot / that mine intent is cleene
Take heed thereof / for I none evil meene
And right good thryst I pray to god have ye
That have such one caught wythouten net
And be ye wise / as ye be fair to see
Well in the ryng / than is the Ruby set
There were never two / so well y met
When ye be his al hool / as he is yowre
Al mighty god grant us / to see that hour
Nay thereof spack I not / a ha quod she
As h^lp me god / ye shenden every de^e
A mercy dear rece / anon quod he
What so I spack / I meant but well
By Mars the god / that helmed is with steel
Now be not wroth / my blood my nece dear
Now well quod she / foryeuen be it here
With this he took his leave / and home he went
A lord so he was glad / and well bygon
Criseyde aroos / no longer she ne stent
But streyt into her closet / she went anon
And set her down as still as any ston
And every word / began up and down to wynd
As he had said / as it come to her mind
And was som^edel astonyed / in her thought
Right for the new cas / but when that she
Was full auysed / than fond she right naught
Of perile / which she ought aferd to be
For men may love / of pessibylyte
A womman so his heart may to breast
And she not love ageyn / but if she lest
But as she sat alone / and thought thus
Ascry aros at scarmyssh / al without
And men cried in the srete / see Troylus
Has now put to flight / the greekis route
With that began her meyne / for to showte
A go we see / cast up the gatis wide
For through this street / he must to paleys ride
For other wey / is fro the yate none
Of dardanus / there opyn is the cheyne
With that come he / and al his folk anon
An esy paas rydyng / in rowtis tweyne
Right as his happy day / was sooth to seyne
For which men seyn / may not dystourbed be
That shall betyde must be of necessite
This Troylus sat / on his bay steed
Al armed save his heed / full rychely
And woundyd was his horse / and began to bleed
In which he rode / a paas full softly
But such a knyghtly sight truly
As was on him / was not wythouten fail
To look on Mars / that is god of battle
So like a man of arms / and a knight
He was to see / fulfilled of hye prowess
For both he has a body / and a might
To do a thing / as well as hardynesse
And to seee him / in his gere him dress
So fressh so young / so worthy semyd he
It was an heaven / upon him to see
His helm to hewn / was in twenty places
That by a tassel / hyng his back behynd
His sheld / to dasshed with swerdis and maces
In which men might / many an arowe find
That thrylled had / horn nerf and rynde
And ay the people cried / here comyth our Joy
Next his brother holder up of Troy
For which he wax / all reed for shame
When he the people / cry upon him herden
That to byhold / it was a noble game
How sobyrly he cast down his eyes
Criseyde began all his chere espyen
And leete it so soft / in her heart synk
That to her self she said / who yaf me drynk
For of her own thought / she wax all read
Remembryng her right thus / lo this is he
Which that mine uncle swerith / he mote be deed
But I on him have mercy and pity
And with that thought / ashamed wax she
Began in her heed to pulle / and that as fast
While he and all the people forth by paste
And began to cast / and roll up and down
Within her thought / his excellent prowess
And his hye estate / and al his renoun
His wit his shap / and eke his gentylnesse
But most her favor / was for his dystresse
Was al for her / and thought it was a rowth
To sle such one / if that he meant trowth
Now might som^e enuyous Iangle thus
This was a sodeyn love / how might (...) be
That she so hastyly / louyd Troylus
Right for the first sight / ye parde
Now who so seyth / mote be never the
For every thing / agynnyng both (...) need
Or al be wrought wythouten any dread
For I sey not that she / so suddenly
Yaf him her love / But that six did enclyne
To like him fyrs^ / and I have told you why
And after that / his manhod and hye pyne
Made love / in her heart for to mine
For which by process / and by good seruy^^
He gate her love / and not in sodaynt wy^e
And also blysful venue / well (...)
Sat in her seventh house / of ^^uene tho
Dysposed well / and with aspect^^ (...)
To helpen sely Troylus of his woo
And sooth to said / she nas not al his foo
To Troylus in his natyuyte
God wot that well the sonner / sped he
Now let us s^ynt / of Troylus a throw
That rydyth forth / and let us turn fast
Unto Criseyde / that hyng her lred full low
There as she sat alone / and began to cast
Where that she would apoynt her / at the last
If it so were / her Eame nold ceace
For Troylus upon his / mo^e for to preace
And lord so she began / in her thought argue
In this matere / of which I have you told
And what to do best were / and what to eschew
That plyted she full often / in many a fold
Now was her heart warm / now was it cold
And what she thought / som^what shall I write
As that mine auctor / lyftyth to endyte
She thought well / that Troylus person
She knew by sight / and eke his gentylnesse
And thus she said / al were it not to done
To grant him love / yet for his worthynesse
It were honor / with pley and with gladness
In honest / with such a lord to dele
For mine estate and his hele
Eke well wot I / a kings sone is he
And since he has to see me / such delight
If I would utterly / his sight flee
Perauenture he might / have me in dyspyte
Where through I might stand / in wors plyte
Now were I wise me haate to purchase
Wythouten need / there I may stand in grace
In every thing / I wot there lies mesure
For though a man forbede drunkenness
He not forbedyth / that every creature
Be drynkles / for alwey as I guess
Eke since I wot / for me is his dystresse
I ne aught not / for that thing him despise
Sith it so is / he meanyth in goodely wise
And eke I know / of long time agon
His ^hewys good / and that he is not nyce
Ne a vantour certain / men seyn he is none
To wise he is to do such a vice
And eke I nyl not / so him cheryce
That he may make auaunt / by Just cause
He shall me never bind / in such a clause
Now set a caas / the hardest is ywys
Men might deem / that he louyth me
What dishonor / were unto me this
May I let him of that / why nay parde
I know also and alday here and see
Men louen wymmen / al beside her leave
And when him list no more let him leave
I thynk how / he able is to have
Of al this noble town / the thryftyest
To be his love / so she her honor save
For in and out / he is the worthyest
Save only Hector / which that is the best
And yet his life now / lies al in my cure
Lo such is love / and eke mine adventure
Ne me to love / a wonder is it naught
For well wot I my self / so god me speed
Al would I that noman wist / of this thought
I am one the fairest / wythouten dread
And godelyest / who so takith heed
And so men seyn / in all the town of Troy
What wonder is / though he of me have Joy
I am mine own womman / well at ease
I thank it god / as for mine estate
Right young and stond untied / in lusty lease
Wythouth Ialowsy / or such debate
Shall no husbond / sey to me chekmate
For outher they ben full of Ialousye
Or maysterful / or louen nouelrye
What shall I do to what fine live I thus
Shall I not love in cas if that me lest
What parde I am / now no religyous
And though that I mine heart / set in rest
Upon this knight / that is the worthyest
And keep allbey / mine honor and my name
By all right / it may do me no shame
But right as when / the son shyneth bright
In march that chaungyth / often time his face
And that a clowd put with wynd to flight
Which ouersprad the son / as for a space
A clowdy thought / began through her heart pace
That ouersprad / her bright thoughtis all
So that for fere / almost she began to fall
That thought was this / alas since I am fre
Should I now love / and put in Ieopartye
My sikernesse / and thrallen lyberte
Alas how durst I thynk that folly
May I not well / in other folk espy
Their dredeful Joy / their constreynt and their pain
There loouyth none / yt she ne has wey to pleyne
For love is yet / the most stormy life
Right of him self / that ever was bygonne
For ever som^e mystrust / or nyce strif
There is in love / som^e clowd over the son
Whereto we wretchyd wymmen / nothing conne
When us is woe / but fit weep and thynk
Our wretch is this / our own woo to drynk
Also these wicked tunges / ben so pressed
To speak us harm / eke men ben so untrue
That right anon / as ceasid is their lest
Deceasith their love / and forth to love a new
But harm y do is do / who so it rewe
For though these men / for love hem self rende
Full sharp beginning / brekyth often at end
How often times / has it known ben
The treason that to wymmen / has be done
To what fine is such love / I can not seen
Or where becomyth it when it is gone
There is no wight I trow / that wot sone
Where it bycomyth / no wight there at spornyth
That erst was nothing / in to naught tornyth
How busy if I love / must I be
To please them / that Iangle of love and dremyn
And coy hem / that they sey no harm of me
For though there be no cause / yet hem semyn
Al be for harm / that folk her frendis wenyn
Or who may stop / every wykked tunge
Or sown of bellis / while they ben runge
And aftyr that thought began to clear
She said that he / nothing vndyrtakyth
Nothing acheuyth / be him looth or dear
And with another thought her heart quakyth
Than slepyth hoope / and after dread awakyth
Now hot now cold / but thus betwyx twey
She ryst her up / and went her for to pley
Adoun the steyre / anon right down she went
In to the gardyn / with her neecis three
And up and down they made many a went
Flexible and she Tarbe and Antigone
To pleyen that Joy it was to see
And othyr of her wymmen / a great route
Her folowyd in the gardyn / al about
This yerde was large and rayled all the aleyes
And shadowed well / with blosmy bows grene
Y benched new / and sanded all the weyes
An which she walkith / arm in arm between
Till at the last / Antigone the shene
Began on a Troyan song / syngen clear
That it an heuene was / for to here
She said O love to whom I have and shall
Ben humble subgect / true in mine intent
As I best can / to you lord give I al
For evermore mine hertis lust / the rent
For never yet / thy grace no wight sent
So blisful cause / as me my life to lead
In all Joy and seurte / out of dread
The blysful god has me / so well be set
In love ywis / that all that berith life
Ymagyne ne cowde / how to be bet
For lord without / Ielowsy or stryf
I love one which is most ententyf
To seruen well / vnwery and unfeigned
That ever was / and leest with harm dysteyned
As he that is / the well of worthynesse
Of trowth ground / myrrour of goodelyhed
Of wit Appollo / stone of secretnesse
Of virtue root / of lust fynder and h^ed
Through which is al my sorrow from me deed
Ywis I love him best / so does he me
Now good thryft have he / wherso ever he be
Whom should I thank / but you god of love
Of al this blis / in which I bathe now in All thankid be the lord / for that I love
This is the right life / that I am in
To eschew al manner / vice and syn
This does me / so to virtue entende
That day by day / I in my will amend
And who that seyth / that for to love is vice
Or thraldom / though he feel in it dystresse
He outhyr is envious / or right nyce
Or is vnmyghty / for his shrewdness
To love for such manner folk / as I guess
Defamyn love / as nothing of it know
They speak / but bent they never his bow
What is the son the wors of kind right
Though that a man / for feebleness of his eyes
May not endure on it / to look for bright
Or love the wors / though wretchys on it cryen
No well is he worth / that may no sorrow dryen
And for thy who that has / an heed of verre
Fro cast of stones / beware him in the werre
But I with al mine heart / and my might
As I have said / will love unto my lost
My dear heart and al mine own knight
In which mine heart / graven is so fast
And his in mine / that it shall ever last
Al dred I first / love him to begin
Now wot I well / there is no pa^l ynne
And of her song / right at that word she s^ynt
And therwyth al / now nece quod C^seyde
Who made this song / with so good entr^t
Antigone answered anon and said
Madame ywis the goodehest maid
Of great esiatr / in all the town of Troy
And led her life / in most honor and Joy
Forsooth so it semyth / up her song
Quod tho Enseyde / and began therwyth to (...)
And said lord / to there such (...) among
These lovers / as they fayde endyte
Yewis quod fressh Antigone the whyse
For all the folk / that have or ben aly^^
Ne coud not well the blys of love desery^^
But wene ye that every wretch wot
The parsytr bliss of love / nay ywys
They wene al love / if one behote
Do wey do wey they wot nothing of this
Men must ask at seyntis / if it is
Ought f^yre in heuene / for they conne tells
And ask fyendis if it be foul in hell
Cnseyde unto that purpos / naught answered
But said ywis / it will be night as fast
But enery word / which that she of herd
She began to prynt it / in her heart fast
And ay began love / it lessyd more to agost
Than it did erst / and synkyn in her heart
That she wax som^what / able to convert
The days honor / and the heuenes eye
The nyghtis foo / al this clepe I the son
Began westren fast / and dounward for to wry
As he that had his days course y run
And white things / wexed dymme and done
For lak of light / and sterris to appear
That she and al her folk / home went in feere
So when it lyketh her / to go to rest
And voyded were tho / that voyden ought
She said that to sleep / well her lest
Her wymmen soon / in to her bed byr brought
When all was hushed / tho lay she still and thought
Of all these things / the manner and the guyse
To reherce it nedyth not / for ye ben wise
A nyghtyngale / upon a Cedre grene
Vndyr the chamber wall / there as she lay
Full loud song / ageyn the moon sheene
Parauenture in her bryddis / wise alay
Of love that made / her heart fressh and gay
That herkeneth she / so long in good intent
That at the last / the ded sleep^ her hent
And as she sleep / anon right her met
How that an Egle / fetherid white as bone
Vndyr her breast / his long clees set
And out her heart rent / and that anon
And did his heart / in to her breast gone
Of which she naught agros / ne nothing smert
And forth he fly / with heart left for heart
Now let her sleep / and we our talis hold
Of Troylus that is to paleys riden
For the searmyssh / of which I told
And in his chamber sit / and has abyden
Till two or three / of his messagers yeden
For Pandarus / and sought him so fast
Till they him fond / and brought him at the last
This Pandarus / came lepyng in attones
And said thus / who has been well I beat
To day with swerdis / with slings and stones
But Troylus that has caught him an hete
And began to Iape / and said lord ye sweet
But rise and let us soupe / and go to rest
And he answered / go we where the least
With all the have goodely / that they might
They sped hem from the souper and to bed
And every wight / out at the door him dyght
And where him lest / upon his wey him spedde
But Troylus / that thought his heart bledde
For woo / till he herd som^e tydyng
He said friend / shall I now weep or sing
Quod Pandarus / be still and let me sleep
And do on thyn hoode / thy nedis sped be
And cheese if thou wylt / sing dance or leepe
At short wordis / thou shall trust in me
And my nece will do well by the
And love the best by god and by my trowth
But lack of poursute / make it in thy slowth
For thus ferforth have I / thy work bygonne
From day to day / to this day by the morrow
Her love and frendshyp / have I to the won
And thereto has the leyde / her feyth to borowe
Algate one foot / is lissed of thy sorrow
What shall I longer / sermon of it hold
As ye have herd before / he al him told
But right as flowers / through the cold of night
Yclosed stoupen on her stalkis low
Redressen ageyn / the son bright
And spreden out their colors / kyndly by row
Right so began he tho / his eyes up throw
This Troylus and said / O Venus dear
Thy might thy grace / I heryed be it here
And to Pandare / held up both his handis
And said lord al thyn be it that I have
For I am hoole / al brostyn be my bondis
A thousand Troyes / who so that me yaue
Each after other / god so me wysse and save
Ne might me so gladdyn / lo my heart
It spredyth so for Joy / it would out stert
But lord how shall I do / how shall I lyuen
When shall I next / my dear heart see
How shall this long time / away be driven
Till thou be ageyn / at her from me
Thou may answer / abide abide but he
That hangyth by the neck / sooth to seyne
In great disease / abydyth for the pain
Al Esily now / for love and charity
Quod Pandarus for all thing has time
So long abide till that the night departed be
For siker as thou lie here byme
And god to forn I will be there at pryme
And for thy werk som^what shall I seye
Or on som^e other wight this charge leye
For god woot that I have ever yet
Be ready to serve / in to this night
Have I not feyned / but enforced my might
Do now as I shall sey / and fare a right
For I have do thy lust / with al my might
And if thou nylt / wit thy self thy care
On me is not a long / thyn evil fare
I wot well that thou wyser art than I
A thousand fold / but and I were as thou
God help me so I would utterly
Right of mine own hand / write to her now
A letter in which / I would tell her how
I ferd amys / and her beseech of rowth
Now help thy self / and let for no sloth
And I my self shall therwyth to her gone
And when thou wost that I am there
Worth upon a courser and that anon
Ye hardyly / right in thy best gere
And right forth by yt place as naught ne were
And thou shall synd us / if I may fittyng
At som^e wyndowe / in to the street lokynge
And if the list / thou may us fal^we
And upon me make thy contrnounce
But by thy life beware / and fast eschyewe
To taryen ought / god sh^ld us from myschalice
Ride forth thy wey / and hold thy gouernalice
And we shuln speak of the somewhat I trow
When thou art gone / to make thyn eren glowe
Touching thy letter / thou art wise ynow
I wot well thou nylt / it clerkly endytr
As make it with these / argumentie ^ow
Ne seriuanly / ne ^aftyly it write
Blot^^ it eke / with thy treris alyte
And though thou write / a goodely word and soft
Though it be good / rehearse it not to often
For though the lest harper / upon live
Would on the best sowned / Ioly harp
That ever was / with as his fyngres five
Touch ay one stryng / or ay one warbyl harp
With his nails / poynted never so sharp
It should make every wight to dulle
To here his glee / and of his strokes fulle
Ne Iompre not / no dyscordaunt in feere
As vsen these terms of physik
In loves terms / hold on thy matere
The form alwey / and do that it be like
For if a peyntour / would peynt a pyke
With asses feet / and heed as an ape
It cordyth not / so ner it but a Iape
This consayl lyked well Twylus
But as a dredeful man he said this
Alas my dear brother pandarus
I am ashamed / for to written ywys
Lest of mine Innocence / I said amys
Or that she nold / for despyte it receive
Than were I ded / there might nothing it weyue
To that Pandare answered / if the lest
Do as I sey / and let me therwyth gone
For by that lord / that formed Est and West
I hope of it / to bring answer anon
Right of her hond / and if thou wylt none
Late be / and sorry mote he be his live
Against thy lust / that helpyth the to thryue
Quod Troylus depardieux yche assent
Sith that the list I will arise and write
And blysful god pray I / with good intent
The vyage and the letter / I shall endyte
So speed / and thou minerua the white
Give thou me wit / my lettir to deuyse
And sat him down / and wrote in this wise
First he began her / his right lady call
His hertis life / his lust / his sorrows leche
His blys and eke these other terms all
That in such ^^as / ye lovers all seeche
And in full humble wise as in his speech
He began him recomaund unto her grace
To tell al how / it askyth much space
And after this / full lowly he her preyde
To be not wroth / though he of his folly
So hardy was her to write or seyde
But love it made / or ellis must he dye
And pytously began mercy for to cry
And after he said / and lied loud
Him self was little worth / and less good cowde
And prayed her have exeusid his vnkonnyng
That little was / and eke him self also
Was well ny deed / in his writing
And after that / than began he tell his woo
But that was endlees / wythouten hoo
And said he would / in trowth alwey him hold
And rad it over / and began the letter fold
And with his salt treris / began he bathe
The Ruby in his signet / and it he set
Upon the wexe / delyuerly and rathe
Therwyth a thousand times / or he let
He kyst the lettyr / and after that it shet
And said lettre / a blysful destyne
The shapyn is / my lady shall the sea
This Pandare took the letter right by time
On morrow and to his necis palace he him stert
And fast he swore / that it was passed pryme
And began to Iape / and said ywys mine heart
So fressh it is / al though it sore smert
I may not sleep / never a mayes morrow
I have a Ioly woo / and a lusty sorrow
Cryseyde when she / her uncle herd
With dredeful heart / and desirous to here
The cause of his coming / thus answered
Now by your feyth mine uncle quod she dear
What manner wynd / guydyth you now here
Tell us your Ioly woo / and your penance
How ferforth ben ye / put in louys dance
By god quod he / I hoppe always behind
And she to laugh / her thought her heart breast
Quod Pandarus / look alwey that ye find
Game in my hood / but herkenyth if ye lest
There is right now come to town a gest
A greek aspye / and tellyth new things
Wherefore I come / to tell you tidings
In to the gardyn gowe / and ye shul here
Al pryuyly of this / a long sermon
With that they went / arm in arm yfere
In to the gardyn / from the chamber down
And when he was so fer / that the sown
Of that he spak / noman here might
He said her thus / and out the lettir plyght
Lo he that is / as holy youres free
Him recomaundyth / lowly to yowre grace
And sent you this letter / here by me
Auyse you on it / when ye have space
And of som^e goodely answer / you purchase
Or so help me god / pleynly for to seyne
He may not long live / in this pain
Full dredefully tho / began the stand stylle
And took it not / but all here humble chere
Began for to change / and said script ne bylle
For love of god / that touchyth such matere
Ne bring me none / and also uncle dear
To mine estate have more reward I prey
Than to his lust / what should I more sey
And lokyth now if this be reasonable
And lettyth not / for favor ne for slowth
To sey a sooth / now were it couenable
To mine estate by god / and by yowre trowth
To take it / to have of him rowth
In harmyng of my self / or repreue
Bear it ageyn / for him that ye on leeue
This Pandarus / began on her for to stare
And said now / this is the most wondyr
That ever I saw / late be this nyce fare
To death mote I smite be / with thondyr
If for the city / which that stondyth yondyr
And I a lettyr to you / bring or take
To harm of you / what lust ye this to make
But thus ye fare well ny / all and som^e
He that most desirith / you to serve
Of him ye retche leest / where he become
Or whether that he live / or ellis sterue
But for all that / I may deserve
Refuse it not quod he / and bent her fast
And in her bosum / down the lettre thraft
And said her / cast it fast away anon
That folk may / see and gawre on us ^wey
Quod she I can abide / till they be gone
And began to smyle / and said Game I prey
Such answer an you lyse / such your self po^uey
For trewly / I nyl no lettir write
No than will I / so that ye endyte
I herwyth she laugh / and said go we dyne
And began at him self / Iape fast
And said ne^^ I / have so great a pyne
For love that every othyr day I fast
And began his Iaprs / best forth to cast
And make her so to laugh / of bye folly
That she for laughtir / wend for to dye
And when she was comen / in to the halle
Now Eame quod she / we will go dyne an one
And began som^e of her wymmen / to call
And straight unto her chambyr / began she gone
But of her business / this was one
Among other things / out of dread
Full pryuely / this letter began she read
Auysed word by word in every line
And fond no lack / she thought he cowde good
And up it put and went her in to dyne
But Pandarus / that in study stood
Or he was ware / she took him by the hoode
And said ye were caught / or that ye wyste
I vouchesauf quod he / do what ye list
Tho wysshen they / and set hem down to ete
And aftyr anon / full slyly Pandarus
Began draw him to the wyndow / next the street
And said niece / who has arrayed thus
That yondy^ house / that stont / aforyenst us
Which house quod she / and come for to behold
And knew it well / and whose it was him told
And fyllen forth / in speech of things small
And satyn in the wyndow / both twey
When Pandarus fawe time / unto his tale
And saw well / her folk were a wey
Now niece mine tell on / quod he I sey
How lykyth you this letter / that ye wot
Can he there on / for by my trowth I note
Therwyth al rose hewed / tho wax she
And began to homme / ye so I trow
And write to him well for goddis sake quod he
My self to medes / will the lettre sow
And held his handis up / and fell on know
Now good nece be it never so lyte
Give me the labor / it to sow and plyte
Ye for I can so write quod she tho
And eke I note / what I shul to him sey
Nay niece quod Pandare / sey not so
Yet at the lest / thank him I you prey
Of his good will / o do him not to dey
Now for the love of me / my niece dear
Refuse not at this time / my prayere
God grant quod she / al thing be well
God help me so this is the first lettyr
That ever I wrote / ye or any dele
And in to a closet / for to auyse her bettyr
She went anon / and began her heart vnfettyr
Out of dysdeygnous prison let a lyte
She set her down / and began a lettyr write
Of which to tell / in short is mine intent
Theffect as fer / as I can understand
She thankid him of al / that he well meant
Towardis her / but holden him in hand
She would not / ne make her self bond
In love but as his suster / him to please
She would ay feign / do his heart ease
She shyt it / and to Pandare began gone
There as he sat / and lookid in to the street
And down she set her / by him on a ston
Of Jasper upon a qwysshon / of gold I beat
And said as wysly / help me god the great
I never did a thing / with more pain
Than write this / to which ye me constreyne
And took it him / he thanked here and seyde
God wot of thing / full often both bygonne
Comyth end good / and niece mine Criseyde
That ye to him / of hard now be won
Ought he be glad / by god and by yond son
For why men seyn / impressions light
Full lightly ben al / ready to the flight
But ye have pleyde / the tyrant nigh to long
And hard was it / yowre heart for to grave
Now stynt that ye / not longer on it honge
Al would the form / of daungyer it save
But hastyth you / to do him Joy to have
For trustyth well / to long y do hardness
Causith dyspyte full often / for dystresse
And right as they declarid this (...)ere
Lo Troylus right / at the stretis end
Come rydyng / with his people in feere
Al softly / and thyderward began bend
There as they sat / as was his wey to wend
To paleys ward / and Pandare him aspyed
And said niece / lo who (...) here now ride
O flee not in / he sees us as I suppose
Lest he may thynk / that we him eschew
Nay nay quod she / and wax as read as rose
With that he began / her humbly salew
With dredeful chere / and often his hew was new
And up his head / debonayrly he cast
And bekened on Pandare / and forth he past
God wot if he sat / on his horse a right
Or goodely was beseyn / that ylk day
God wot whether he was like a ma^ly knight
What should I dretche / or tell of his array
Criseyde which that / all these thing say
To tell in short / her lyked all in fere
His person his array ^ his look his chere
His goodely manner / and his gentylesse
So well that never / since she was born
Ne had she such rowth / of his dystresse
And though she had be hard / there toforn
To good hope / she has now caught a thorn
She shall not pull it out / this next wyke
God send her mo such / thorns on to pyke
Pandare which that stood her fast by
Felt the yren hot / and bygan to smite

But thereon was / to heue and to done
Considered al thing / it may not so be
And why for speech / and eke it were to soon
To grant him yet / so great a lyberte
For plainly her intent / as said she
Was for to love him / vnwyst if she might
And gwerdon him with nothing / but with sight
But pandare thought / it should not be so
If that I may this nyce oppynyon
Shall not be hold / fully yeris ^wo
What should I make of this / a long sermon
She must assent / on that conclusion
As for the time / and when that it was eve
And al was well / he roos and took his leave
And on his way homward / full fast him sped
And right for Joy / he felt his heart dance
And Troylus he fond / alone a bed
That lay as don / these lovers in a trance
Betwyx hope / and derst desperaunce
But Pandare right / al his in coming

Of Troylus while he began it read
So as the wordis / yaue him hoope and dread
But finally / he took all for the best
That she him wrote / for som^what he byheld
On which he thought / he might his heart rest
Al covered she the word / vndyr sheld
Thus to the more worthyer / part he held
That what for hope / and Pandarus byhest
His great woo foryeede / at the lest
But as we may alday / our seluen see
The more wood and cool / the more fire
Right so encreas of hope / what so it be
Therwyth full often / encreasith his desire
Or as an Oak / comes of a little spyre
So through this letter / which that she him sent
Encreace began desire / with which he brent
Wherefore I sey alwey / that day and night
This Troylus / began to desire more
Than he did erst / through hope and did his might
To preacen on / as by Pandarus lore
And wrote unto her / of his sorrows sore
Fro day to day / he let it not refreyde
That by pandare somewhat he wrote or seyde
And did also his other obseruaunces
That to a lover / longyth in this caas
And after that his dyce / turned on chances
So he was outher glad / or said alas
And held after his gifts / ay his pas
As after such answer as he had
So were his daye^ (...) other glad
But to pandare alwey / was his recours
And pytously began / unto him pleyne
And him besought / of read or som^e socours
And Pandarus saw his woodely pain
Wax well ny deed / for rowth sooth to seyne
And besily with al his heart he cast
Som^e of his woo to slay / and that as fast
And said lord / and friend / and brother dear
God wot that thy desease / does me woo
But wylt thou stynt / al this woeful chere
And by my troth / or it be days two
And god to forn / yet shall I shape it so
That thou shall come / in to a certain place
There as thou may thy self / prey her of grace
And certainly I note / if thou it wost
But tho that been expert / in love I sey
It is one of the things / that furtherith most
A man to have a leyser / for to prey
And siker place his woo for to bewrey
For in good heart / there must rowth impresse
To her that sees / the gyltles in dystresse
Perauenture thynkest thou / though it be so
That kind would done / for to begin
To have a manner rowth / upon my woo
Seyth dau^gyer nay thou shall me never win
In that manner for no manner gynne
Though that she bend yet / she stant on Root
What in effect is this / unto my boot
Than there against / when that the sturdy oak
On which men hacke / often for the nones
Received has / the happy falling stroke
The great sweyght / does it fall at ones
As don these rokkes / to the mylstones
For swyfter course / comyth thing of weight
When it descendyth / than don things ^^ght
But Reed that bowyth down / with every blast
Full lightly with the wynd / it will arise
But so nyl not an oak / when it is cast
It nedyth me not / the long to deuyse
Men should rejoice / of great empryse
Acheuyth well / and stondyth out of doubt
Al have men ben / the longer there about
But Troylus now tell me if the lest
A thing the which / I shall ask the
Which is the brother / that thou love best
As in thy very hertis pryuyte
Ywys my dear brother / Deyphebe
Now quod Pandare / or houris twyes twelve
He shall the ease / vnwyst of him selue
Now let me alone / and work as I may
Quod he / and to deyphebus went he tho
Which had his lord / and great friend ben ay
Save Troylus noman he loved so
To tell in short / without wordis mo
Quod Pandarus / I pray you that ye be
Friend to a cause / which that touchyeth me
Yis parde quod Deyphebus / well thou wost
In all that ever I may / and god to fore
Al near it but for oo man / that I love most
My brother Troylus / but sey me wherefore
It is for since the day / that I was bore
I nas nor neuermore / to be I thynk
Against a thing / that might the forthynk
Pandarus began him thank / and thus he seyde
Lo sire I have a lady in this town
That is my niece / and called is Criseyde
Which som^e men would do oppression
And wrongfully have her possession
Wherefore yowre lordshyp / I you beseech
To be our friend without more speech
Deiphebus answered / is it this
That thou to me spack of / so straungely
Criseyde my friend / he said she is
Than nedyth quod Deiphebus / hardily
No More of this for trusts well that I
Will be her champioun / with spear and swerd
I rought not / though all her foes it herd
But tell me / for thou wost this matere
I might her best avail / now late see
Quod Pandarus / if ye my lord so dear
Would as now do / this honor unto me
To prayen her this / to morrow that she
Come unto you / her playntes to deuyse
Her adversaries / would thereof agryse
Lord if that more / I durst you prey as now
And charge you to have so great travail
To have som^e of yowre brethern / here with you
Than might her cause / the better avail
Than wot I well / she might never fail
For to be holp / what at your instaunce
What with her othyr friends / sustenaunce
Deiphebus which that was / come of kind
To al honor / and bounte to consent
Answered it shall be don / and I can find
Yet gretter help to this / in mine intent
That wylt thou sey / if for Heleyne I sent
To speak of this / I trow it be best
For she may leede Paris / as her lest
For Hector which that is my lord my brother
It nedyth not to pray him friend to be
For I have herd him / both one time and other
Speak of Criseyde such honor that he
May sey no bet / such hap to him has she
So nedyth not his help / now for to crave
He shall be such / right as we will him have
Speak thou thy self also to Troylus
On my behalue / and pray him with us dyne
Sir al this shall be do / quod Pandarus
And took his leave / and never began to fine
But to his neecis house / as straight as a line
He come and fond her / from the mete arise
And set him down / and spack right in this wise
He said / O very god so have I run
Lo niece mine / see ye not how I sweet
I note whether the more / ye me thank conne
Be ye not ware / how falls Poliphete
Is now about / eftsoons to plete
To bring on you / aduocatis new
I no quod she / and chaungyd all her hew
What is he more about / me to dretche
And do me wrong / what shall I do alas
Yet of him self / nothing would I retche
Ner it for Anthenor and Eneas
That been his friends / in such manner cas
But for the love of god / mine uncle dear
No fors of it / let him have al yfere
Without that I have ynowgh for us
Nay quod Pandare / it shall nothing be so
For I have be right now / with Deiphebus
At Hector / and mine other lordis moo
And shortly made each of them / his foo
That by my thryft / he shall it never win
For aught he can / when so that he begin
And as they cast / what was best to done
Deiphebus / of his own curtesye
Came her to prey / in his own propyr person
To hold him / on the morrow company
At dinner which she would / him not deny
But goodely began / to his prayer obey
He thankyth her / and went upon his weye
When this was done this pandare up anon
To tell in short / forth he began to wend
To Troylus as still as any stone
Of al this thing he told him word and end
And how he Deiphebus began to blende
And said now is time / if that thou conne
Bear the well to morrow / and al is won
Now speak now prey / now pytously complain
Leave not for nyce shame / or dread or slowth
Sometime a man mote / tell his own pain
Believe it and she will have / on the rowth
Thou shall be sauyd / by thy feyth in trowth
But well wot I thou art in a dread
And what it is / lo I can it read
Thou thynkest now / how shall I do al this
For by my chere / must folk espy
That for love is / that I fare amys
Yet had I lever ywys / for sorrow dye
Now thynk not so / thou do great folly
For I right now / have found a manner
Of sleyght / for to couere al thy chyere
Thou shall goo over night / and that as blyue
Unto Deiphebus house / the to pley
Thy malady the bet / awey to drive
For why thou semyst syke / the sooth to sey
Soon after that / down in thy bed the ley
And sey thou may / no longer up endure
And be right there / and bide thy aueuture
Sey that the fever / is wont the to take
The same time / and last till a morrow
And let see now / how well thou kanst it make
For parde sike is he that is in sorrow
Go now fare well / and venus here to borowe
I hope and thou / thy pourpos hold ferme
In grace she shall / the fully conferme
Quod Troylus ywys / thou nedeles
Counseylest me / sikerly to feyne
For I am sike / in ernest douteles
So well ny that / I sterue for the pain
Quod Pandarus / thou shall the bettyr pleyne
And have the less need / to countrefete
For him men deem hot / that men see sweet
Lo hold the at thy Trist clos / and I
Shall well the dear / unto thy low drive
Therwyth he took his leave / al softly
And Troylus to paleys went blyue
So glad he nas / never in all his live
And to Pandarus read / began al assent
And to Deiphebus house / at night he went
What nedyth you / to tellen of the chere
That Deiphebus began his brothyr make
Or his access / or his sikely manner
How men him began / with clothys lade
When he was leyde / and how men did him glade
But all for naught / he held forth his guyse
As ye have herd / Pandare him deuyse
But certain is / or Troylus him leyde
Deiphebus preyd him / over night
To be a friend and helpyng to Criseyde
God wot that he / it granted anon right
To be her full friend / with al his might
But such a need it was / to pray him then
As for to bydde / a wood man to run
The morrow come / and nyghen began the time
Of mele tide / that the fair queen heleyne
Shoope her to be / an hour after the pryme
With deiphebus / to whom she would not feyne
But as his suster / homely soth to seyne
She come to dinner / in her plain intent
But god and Pa^dare / wist none what this meant
Come eke Criseyde al innocent of this
Antygone her suster and Targe also
But fle we now prolixite best is
For love of god and let us fast goo
Right to theffect / without talis moo
Why al this folk / assembled in that place
And let us of their salowynges pace
Great honor did hem Deiphebus certain
And fed hem well / with all yt might hem like
But evermore alas / was his refreyne
My good brother / Troylus the sike
Lies yet / and therwyth al he began to sike
And after that / he peyned him to glade
Hem as he might / and good chere hem made
Compleyned eke Heleyne / of his sikenesse
So feythfully / that pity was to here
And every wight than / was for that access
A leche anon / and seyde in this manner
Men curen folk / this charm I will you (...)
But there sat one / al list her not to (...)
That thought / yet best cowd I be his lec^^
After compleynt / than began they him to preyse
As folk don yet / when som^e han bygonne
To preyse a man / and up with him to reyse
A thousand fold / yet hyer than the son
He is that can / that few lordis conne
And Pandarus of that / they would afferme
He not forgate / his praysyng to conferme
Herd al this / Cryseyde well ynowgh
And every word / began to notyfye
For which with sobre chere / her heart lowgh
For who is that / nold him gloryfye
To moan such a knight / to live or dye
But al pass I / lose ye to long dwell
For all is / for a fine that I you tell
To time come / from dinner for to rise
And as them ought / they risen eueryc^on
And began a while / of this and that deuyse
But Pandarus / brake all that speech anon
And saydto Deiphebus / will we gone
If yowre will be / as I you preyde
To speak here of the needis / of Criseyde
Heleyne which that / by the hand her held
Took first the tale / and said gowe blyue
And goodly on Criseyde she beheld
And said Iouis late him never thryue
That does you harm / and bring him self of live
And give me sorrow / but he shall it rewe
If that I may / and all folks be true
Tell thou thy neecis caas / quod Deiphebus
To Pandarus / for thou can best it tell
My lordis and my ladies it stant thus
What should I longer / do you dwell
He rong him out a process like a belle
Upon her foo / that hight poliphete
So heinous that men / might on it spete
Answered of this each of them / worse tha^ other
And poliphete / thus began they waryen
An hanged lo such one / were he my brother
And so it shall / for it may not varien
What should I longer / in this process taryen
Plainly al at ones / they her behyght
To be her friend / in all that ever they might
Spack than heleyne / and herd Pandarus
Wot ought my lord my brother this matere
I mean Hector / or wot it Troylus
He said ye / but will ye now me here
Me thinks this / since Troylus is here
It were good / if that ye would assent
She told him her self / al this or she went
For he will have the more / her grief at heart
By cause loo / that she a lady is
And by yowre leave / I will but in stert
And do you wit / and that anon ywys
If that he sleep / or will ought here of this
And in he leepe / and said him in his eere
God have thy soul brought I have thy bear
To smylen began / of this Troylus
And Pandarus / without restonyng
Out went anon / to Heleyne and Deiphebus
And said hem so / there be no taryeng
Ne more I will well / that ye bryng^
Criseyde anon / my lady that is here
As he may endure / he will you here
But well ye wot / the chamber is but lyte
And few folk may lightly / make it warm
Now lokith ye / for I will have no wit
To bring in pr^^s / that might do him h^rme
^r him disease / for my bettyr arm
Where it be ^^t / she abide till eft son is
Now look ye that know / what to dene is
I say for me best is / as I can know
That no wight now wend in but ye ^wey
But it were for I can in a throw
Reherce her cause / unlike that she can sey
And after this / she may him oones prey
To be her good lord / in short and take her leave
This may not much / of his ease him true
And for that she is strange / he will forbere
His ease which he dare not for you
Eke other things / which touchyth not to her
He wol you tell / I wot it well ynow
That secret is / and for the towns prow
And she that nothing knew / of this intent
Without more / to Troylus in went
Heleyne in all her goodely soft wise
Began him sa^^w / and wommanly pley
And said ywys / ye mote algate arise
Now fair brother / be al hole I you prey
And began her arm / upon his shulder ley
And him with al her heart / she began dysport
As she best cowde / of sorrow him to comfort
Soon after quod she / we you byseke
My dear brother Deiphebus / and I
For love of god / and so does Pandare eke
To be good lord / and friend right hertyly
Unto Criseyde which that certeynly
Receyuyth wrong / as wot well here Pandare
That can her cas / well bet than I declare
This Pandarus / began now his tunge affyle
And al her caas rehersid / and that anon
When it was said / soon after in a while
Quod Troylus / as soon as I may gone
I will right fayn / with al my might anon
Have god my trowth / her cause to sustene
Good thryft have ye / quod Heleyne the queen
Quod Pandadas / and yet yowre will be
That she may take her leave / or that she go
Now ellis god forbede it tho quod she
If that she vouchesauf / for to do so
And with that word / quod Troylus ye two
Deiphebe / and ye my suster dear
To you have I to speak / of a matere
To be aduysed / by yowre advise the bettir
And had as hap was / at his beddis head
The copy of a tretice / and a lettyr
That Hector had him sent / to askyn read
If such a man / were worthy to be deed
Note I not who / but in a grysely wise
He prayed hem both anon / on hit auyse
Deiphebus / began this lettyr unfold
In ernest great / so did heleyne the qwene
And romyng outward / fast began it behold
Dounward a stayre / and in to an herber grene
This ylke thing / they redden hem between
And largely / the montenaunce of an honre
They gonne on it / for to read and power
Now let hem read / and turn we anon
To Pandarus / that began full fast pry
That as well in and out / began he gone
Unto the chamber a loft / and that on hy
And said god save al this company
Come now my need / my lady awene Heleyne
Abydyth you / and eke my lordis ^weyne
Rise take with you / your near Antigone
Or whom ye list / or nofors hardyly
The less preace the bet / come forth with me
And look that ye thank humbely
Hem al three / and when ye may goodely
Yowre time see / takyth of hem yowre leave
Lest we to long / his rest him byreue
Al innocent / of Pandarus intent
O uod tho C^seydes / go we uncle dear
And arm in arm / inward with him she went
Auysyng well her wordis / and her chere
And Pandarus / in erne fullest manner
Said al folk / for goddis love I prey
Styntyth right here / and softely ye pley
Auyse ye what folk / ben here wythynne
And in what ply^r one is / god him amend
And ynward thus / full softly begin
Niece I conjure / and hyely defend
On his half / which that us soul has send
And in the virtue / of the corownes tweyne
Sle not this man / that has for you this pain
Fie on the devil / thynk which one be is
And in what plyte he lies / come of anon
Thynk al such tarried tide / lost is
That will ye both sey / when ye ben one
And sikerly there yet / dyuyneth none
Upon you two / come of now if ye conne
While folk is blent / lo all the time is won
In tyteryng in pursuyte / and delays
Folk will dyuyne / at waggyng of a stre
That though ye would / have after merye days
Than dare ye not for why / for he and he
Spack such a word / thus lookid she and she
Thus time y lost / I dare not with you dele
Come of therefore / and bring him to his hele
But now to you / ye lovers that been here
Was not trroylus / in a cankerdort
That lay and might / the whyspryng of her here
And thought o lord / now rennyth my sort
Fully to dye / or have no comfort
And was the first time he should her preye
Of love / o mighty god what shall I seye
Here ends the secunde book
And here begins the prologe of the third book
O Blisful light of which the beams clear
Adourneth / all the hye heuenes fair
O sonnys life / O Iouys daughter d^re
Pbe saunce o love / o goodely debonayre
In gentyl hertis / ready to repair
O very cause of hele / and of gladness
Y heryed be thy might / and thy goodness
In heuene and hell / earth and see
Is first thy might / if that I well dyscerne
As man bryd best / fyssh herb and grene tree

In Iouis first / to thylk effectis glade
Through which that things / lyuen al and be
Commendyd / and amoureux hem made
O mortal thing / and as thou list ay see
Yaue hem in love / ease or aduersite
And in a thousand fourmes / down hem sent
To love in earth / and whom ye list is blent
The fyers Mars / to apesyn of his Ire
And as ye list me make hertis dygne
Algatis hem / that ye will set a fire
That dreden shame / and vices yet resign
Ye to hem curteys / fressh be and benygne
And hem promotith / aftyr a wight entendyth
The Joy that he has / your might him fendyth
Ye holdyn regne and house / in unity
The sothfast cause / and frendshyp be also
Ye know all thylk / covered qualyte
Of things which that folks wondren on so
That they can not constrewe / how it may geo
She louyth him / or why loves he not here
Or why this fissh / and not that comyth to the were
The folk a law / han set in universe
And this know I / by them that lovers be
That who so striuyth with you / has the wers
Now lady bright / for thy benygnyte
At reverence of hem / that seruen the
Whose clerk I am / teache me deuyse
Som^e Joy of that / is felt in thy seruyse
Ye in my naked / hertis sentement
In elde / and do me show of thy witness
Caliope / thy days ben now present
For now is need / see thon not my dystresse
How I must tell anon / right the gladness
Of Troylus to venus heryeng
To which gladness who need has god him bring
Here ends the prologe
And here begins the third book
LAy al this mean while Troylus
Recordyng his lesson / in this manner
Mafey thought he / thus will I sey and thus
Thus will I pleyne / unto my lady dear
That word is good / and that shall be my matere
This will I not for geten / in no wise
God lyeue he work / as he began deuyse
And lord so his heart / began tho to whappe
Heryng her come / and sore for to syke
And Pandarus / that lad her by the lap
Come nere and began / in at the curteyn pyke
And said god do bote / on al sike
See who is here / you common to vysite
Lo here is she / that is yowre death to wit
Therwyth it seemed / that he wept almost
A ha god / quod Troylus so sorowfully
Where me be woo / o might god thou wost
Who is al there / I see not trewly

Ye sweet heart / Alas I may not rise
To knele and do you honor / in som^e wise
And dressid him upward / and she right tho
Bygan her handis soft / upon him leye
O for the love of god / do ye not so
To me quod she / what is this to seye
Sir come (...) I to you / for causes tweye
First you to thank / of yowre good lorshyp eke
Contynuaunce thereof / I you byseke
Troylus that herd thus / his lady pray
Of lordshyp him was another / quyck ne deed
Ne might one word / for shame to her seye
And though men should have smite of his head
But lord so he was / suddenly read
And his lesson / that he wend had conne
To pray her / was through his heart y run
Criseyde al this espied well ynowgh
For she was wise / and louyd him never the less
Al though he were not malapert / and made it towgh
Or was to bold / to sing a fool a mass
But when his shame / bygan somewhat to pass
His wordis as I may / my rymes hold
I will you tellen / as techen books old
In chaungyd voice / right for his lady dread
Which voice eke quoke / and thereto his manner
Goodely abashed and now his hyewes read
Now pale unto Criseyde his lady dear
With look down cest / and humble lowly chere
Lo altherfyrst word / that him astert
Was twyes mercy mercy sweet heart
And stynt a while / and when he might out bring
The next word was / god wot for I have
As ferforth as I have had conning
Be yowres all / so god my soul save
And shall till that / I woeful wight be grave
And though I ne dare / ne can to you complain
Y wys I suffer not / the less pain
Thus much as now / o wommanly wife
I may out bring / and if it you dysplease
That shall I wreke / upon mine own life
Right soon I trow / and do yowre heart and ease
If with my death / yowre heart may apease
For since ye have me herd / somewhat seye
Now retche I never / how soon that I deye
Therwyth his manly sorrow / to byhold
It might has made an heart / of stone to rewe
And Pandare wept / as he to water would
And said woe begone / ben hertis true
And prokid ever his niece / new and new
For love of god / make of this thing an end
Or slay us both at ones / or we hens wend
Ey what quod she / by god and by my trowth
I wot not what ye would that I sey
I what quod he / that ye have of him rowth
For goddis love / and do him not to dey
Now than quod she thus I would him prey
To tell me the fine of his intent
Yet wist I never / well what he meant
What that I mean / o sweet heart dear
Quod Troylus / o goodely fressh fre
With the streams / of your eyes clear
Ye would friendly / sometime on me see
And that ye suffer / that I never be he
Without branch of vice / in any wise
You for to serve / like as ye will deuyse
As to my lady right / and chyef resort
And al my wit / and al my dylygence
And I to have right as you list comfort
Vndyr your yerd egal / to mine offense
As death / ye if I do any offense
And that ye list me / somoche honor
Me to coumaunde / ought in any hour
And I to be yowre / very humble true
Secret / and in my pains pacyent
And evermore desire / fresshly new
To serve and be / y like dylygent
And with good heart / al holy yowre talent
Receive in gree / how sore tht me smert
Lo thus mean I / mine own sweet heart
Quod Pandarus lo here / an hard request
And resonably / a lady for to werne
Now niece mine / by natal Iouis fest
Were I a god / ye should sterue as yerne
That heren well this man / nothing yerne
But yowre honor / and see him almost sterue
And be so loath / to suffer him you to serve
With that she began her eyes / on him cast
Full esily / and full debonayrly
Auysyng her / and hyed her not to fast
With never a word / but said him sobyrby
Mine honor sauf / I will well trewly
And in such form / as ye conne deuyse
Receyuen him fully / to my seruyse
Besechyng him / for goddis love that he
Would in honor trowth / and gentylnesse
As I wel^ mean / eke mean he well to me
And mine honor / with al business
Ay keep if I may / and do him gladness
From hensforth / ywys I will not feyne
Now beth al hole / no longer that ye pleyne
But natheles / this warn I you quod she
A kings sone / though ye be ywys
Ye shul no more / have souemynte
Of me in love / right but as in that cas is
Ne I nyl forbere / if ye don amys
To wrath you / and while ye me serve
Cherissh you right after you deserve
And shortly dear heart and al my knight
Beth glad and draw you / to lustynesse
And I shall trewly / with al my might
Yowre bitter torn / al in to swetnesse
If I be she / that may do you gladness
For every woo / ye shul recouere a bliss
And him in armies took / and began him kiss
Fyl Pandare on knees / and up his eyes
To heuene he threw / and held his handis hye
Immortal god quod he / that may not dyen
Cupido I mean / of this may gloryfye
And Venus thou may / make melodye
Wythouten hand / me semyth that in town
For this miracle / I here each belle sown
But ho no more as now / of this matere
For why this folk / will come up anon
That have the letter red / o I hem here
But I adiourne the / Criseyde anon
And the Troylus / that when thou may gone
That at mine house / ye be at my warnyng
For I full well / shall shape your coming
And easith there your hertis / right ynowgh
And let see which of you / shall here the belle
To speak of love / a little therwyth he lowgh
For there have ye / a lyser for to tell
Quod Troylus / how long shall it dwell
Or this be do quod he / when thou may rise
This thing shall be / right as I deuyse
With that Heleyne / and eke Deiphebus
Than comen upward / at the stayre end
And lord so to groan / tho began Troylus
His brothyr and his sustir / for to blende
Quod Pandarus time is that we wend
Take niece mine / yowre leeue at al three
And let hem speak / and come forth with me
She took her leave / at hem full honestly
As she well cowd / and her reverence
Unto the full / they dyden hardyly
And wonder well spack / in her absence
Of her in praysyng / of her excellence
Her governance her wit / and her manner
Commendyng it / that Joy it was to here
Now let her wend / to her own place
And torn we / to Troylus ageyn
That began full lightly / of the letter pace
That Deiphe^us / had in the gardyn seyn
And of Heleyne and him he would feyn
Delivered be and said that him lest
To sleep and after talis to have rest
Heleyne him kyst and took / her leave blyue
Deiph^bus eke / and home went every wight
And pandarus / as fast as he may drive
To Troylus come / tho as blyue right
And on a paylet / all that glad night
By Troylus he lay / with blysful chere
To talk and well was hem / they were in fere
When every wight was voyded / but they two
And all the doors / were fast y shet
To tell in short / wythouten wordis mo
This Pandarus / without any let
Up ros and upon his beddis side / him set
And began to speak / in a sobre wise
To Troylus / as I shall you now deuyse
Mine alther best lord / and brother dear
God would and thou / that it sat me so sore
When I the saw / so languysshyng to year
For love of which / the woo wax evermore
That I with all my might / and my lore
Have ever since / do my business
To bring the to Joy / out of dystresse
And have it brought / to such plyte as you wost
So that through me / thou stondyst now in wey
To fare well / I sey it for no lost
And wost thou why / for shame it is to sey
For the have I begone / a game to pley
Which that I never do shall / eft for other
Al though he were / a thousand fold my brother
That is to seye / for the am I becomen
Betwyx game and ernest / such a mean
As maken wymmen / unto men comen
Thou wost thy self / what that I would mean
For the have I / my niece of vices cleene
So fully made thy gentylesse to tryst
That al shall be / right as thy self list
But god that al wot / take I to witness
That I never this / for couetyse wrought
But only to abredge / thy dystresse
For which well nygh / you deydest as me thought
But good brother / do now as the ought
For goodis love / and keep here out of blame
So as thou art wise / keep her out of shame
For well thou woste the name is yet of her
Among the people / as who sey halowyd is
For never was yet wight / I dare well swear
That ever wist / she did amys
But woe is me / that I that cause all this
May thynk / that she is my niece dear
And I her Eame / and traitor both I fere
And were it wist / that I through mine engyne
Had in my nece / put this fantasye
To do thy lust / and holy to be thine
Why all the people / would upon it cry
And sey that I / the worst treachery
Did in this cas / that ever was bygonne
And she fordone / and thou right naught y won
Wherefore er I will further go a paas
The I pray eft / though thou should dey
That pryuyte / go with us in this caas
That is to sey / thou never us bewrey
And be not wroth / though I the often prey
To hold secre / such an high matere
For skillful is / thou wost well my prayere
Thynk what woo / there has betyd or this
For making of auauntis / as men read
And what myschaunce / yet in this world is
Fro day to day / right for that wykked deed
For which these wise clerkis / that been deed
Have write or this / as yet men teache us young
The first virtue is / to keep the tongue
And ner it that / I would as now abredge
Dyffusion of speech / I cowde almost
A thousand old stories the aledge
Of wymmen through falls / and foolis bost
Prouerbis can thy self / ynow and wost
Ageyn that vice / for to be a lable
Though men soth sey / as often as they gabbe
For tongue alas / so often here byforn
Has made full many a lady / bright of few
Sey welawey the day / that she was born
And many a maiden / sorrow for to new
And for the more part / al is untrue
That men of yelp / and it were brought to preue
By reason none auauntour / is to leave
A vauntour and a liar / al is one
As thus I suppose / a womman louyth me
And says certain / that other will she none
And I am sworn / to hold it secre
And after I go / and tell it two or three
Y wys I am a vauntour / at the lest
And a liar / in brekyng of my behest
Such manner folk / what shall I clepe hem what
And look that I be right naught to blame
That hem auau^t of wymmen / and sey she is that
That never yet / in ernest nor in game
Knew her no more / than the deuyls dame
No wonder is / so god me send hele
Though wymmen dread / with us men to ^ele
I sey not this / for no mystrust of you
Ne for no wise man / but for foolis nyce
And for the harm / that in the world is now
As well for folly used / as for malice
For well I wot / that wise folk that vice
No womman dredyth / if she be well auysed
For wise folk ben / by foolis harms chastysed
But now to purpos / lyef brother dear
Have al this thing / that I have said in mind
And keep the clos / and be now of good chere
For at thy day / thou shall me true find
I shall thy process / set in such a kind
And god tofore / that it shall the suffyse
For it shall be right / as thou will it deuyse
For well I wot / thou meanest well parde
Therefore I dare this fully vndyrtake
Thou wost eke / what thy lady grauntid the
And day is set / the charters up to make
Have now good night / I may no longer wake
And bid for me / since thou art now in bliss
That god the send death / or soon lisse
Who might tell / half the Joy or feast
Which that the soul / of Troylus tho felt
Heryng theffect / of Pandarus behest
His old woo / that made his heart swelt
Began tho for Joy / to wasten and to melt
And all the thoughtis / of his sighs sore
Attones fled / he felt of them no more
But right as these holtis / and these hayes
That have been in winter / deed and dryen
Reuesten hem in grene / when that may is
When every lusty / lysti^h for to pleyen
Right in that self wise / soth for to seyen
Wax suddenly his heart / full of Joy
That gladder was there never man in Troy
And began his look / on Pandarus up cast
Full soberly / and friendly unto see
And said friend in Apryl the last
Well thou wost / if it remember the
Well nygh the death / for woo thou fond me
And how thou dydest / all thy business
To know of me / the cause of my dystresse
Thou wost how long / I forbear to seye
To the that art the man / that I best tryst
And perille none was it / to the bewreye
That wist I well / but tell me if the list
Sith I so both was / that thy felt it wist
How durst I mo tell / of this matere
That qwake now / and noman may us here
But natheles by that god / I the sweet
That as him lyse / may al this world govern
And if I lie / A chylles with a spete
My heart cleue / al were my life a terne
As I am mortal / if I late or yerne
Would it bewrey / it show or conne
For all the good / that god made vndyr the son
But rather would I dey / and determyne
As thinks me now / stokked in prison
In wretchydnesse in fylth / and vermyne
Captyf to cruel king A gamenon
And this in all the templis / of the town
Upon the goddis al / will I the swear
To morrow day / if it likyth the to bear
And that thou have / somoche y do for me
That I ne may / it neuermore deserve
This know I well / al might I now for the
A thousand times / in a morrow sterue
I can no more / but that I will the serve
Right as thy slave / whyder so thou wend
For evermore unto my lives end
But here with al mine heart / I the beseech
That never in me / thou deem such folly
As I shall sey / me thought by thy speech
That this that thou have / me for company
Do / I should deem it a bawdry
I am not wood / al if I lewd be
It is not bawdry / that wot I well parde
But he that goth / for gold or for rings
On such message / call hem what the lest
But this that thou do / for gentylnesse
Compassion felawshyp and trust
Depart it so / for wide where is wist
How that there is / dyuersite required
Betwyx things / like as I have lerid
And that thou know / I thynk not ne ween
That this seruyse / a shame be or a Iape
I have my fair sustyr / Polixene
Cassandre Heleyne / or any of the frape
Be she never so fair / ne so well y shape
Tell me which thou wylt / of euerichon
To have for thyn / and let me than alone
But since thou have do me this seruyse
My life to save / and for no hope of mede
So for the love of god / this great empryse
Perform it ou^ / for now is most need
For hye or low / without any dread
I will alwey / thy hestis al keep
Have now good night / and late us both sleep
Thus held hem each of other / well apayed
That all the world ne might it amend
And on the morrow / when they were arrayed
Each to his own need / began entende
But Troylus thought / as the fire he brende
For sharp desire / of hope and of plesaunce
He not forgate / his wise governance
But in him self with manhod began restreyne
Each recheles deed / and each brydeld chere
That al tho that lyuen / soth to seyne
Ne should have wist / by word ne manner
What that he meant / as touching this matere
From every wight / as fer as the cloud
He was so wise / and dyssimylen he cowde
And al this while / which I you deuyse
This was his life with his full might
By day he was / in Martis high seruyse
That is to say / in arms as a knight
And for the most part / the long night
He lay and thought / how that he mygt serve
His lady ^est / her thank for to deserve
For why she fond him / so dyseret in all
So secret / and of such obeysaunce
That well she felt / he was to her a wall
Of styele a sheld / from every dysplesaunce
That to be / in his good governance
So wise he was / she was no more aferd
I mean as fer / as ought to be required
And Pandarus / to qwykene alwey the fire
Was ever like / pressed and dylygent
To ease his friend / was set all his desire
He shof ay on / he to and fro was sent
He lettris bear / when Troylus was absent
That never wight wist / as in his frendis need
Ne bare him bet / to do his friend to speed
But now perauenture / som^e men wait would
That every word or look / sond or chere
Of Troylus / that I rehearse should
In all this while / unto his lady dear
I trow it were / a long thing to here
Or of any wight / that stant in such dysioynt
His wordis all / or every look to point
Forsooth I have not herd / it done or this
In story none / ne noman here I wene
And though I would / I cowd not ywys
For there was som^e epystyl / sent between
That would as seyth my auctour / well contene
An hundryd verse / of which him list not write
How should I than / a line of it endyte
But to the great effect / that I sey thus
That stondyng in concord and quyete
These ylke two / Criseyde and Troylus
As I have said / in this time sweet
Save only that / often time they might not mete
Ne leysir had / her spechis to fulfylle
It befell right / as I shall you tell
That pandarus / which yt always did his might
Right for the fine that I speak of here
As for to bring to his house som^e night
His fair niece / and Troylus y feere
There as at leyser / al this hye matere
Touching their love / were at the full up bound
Had as him thought / a iyme thereto y found
For he with great delyberacion
Had every thing / that thereto might avail
Forn cast / and put in execucion
And nothyr left for cost / ne for travail
That none of hem should in nothing fail
And for to be not espied there
He thought well / an impossible were
And dredles / it clear was in the wynd
Of every pie / and every let game
Thus al is well / and al this world is blind
In this matere both wyld and tame
This timber is ready for to put in frame
Us lackyth not / but that we wyten would
A certain hour / in which she common should
And Troylus that at his puruyaunce
Knew at the full / and waited on it ay
Had here upon eke made / his ordinance
And fond his cause / and eke all the array
That if that he were myssed / night or day
The while he was about this seruyse
That he was go / to do his sacryfyce
And must at such a temple / all ne wake
And worship Appolo / there would he be
And first to see / the holy lau^er quake
Or that Appollo / spack out of the tree
To tell him when / the Grekis should fle
And for thy let him noman / god forbede
But pray Appollo / that he would him speed
Now is there lytyl more / for to done
But Pondare up / and shortly to seyne
Right upon the chaungyng / of the moon
When lightles is the world / a night or tweyne
And that the welkyn / sho^pe him for to reyne
He straight a morrow / unto his niece went
Ye have well herd / the fine of his intent
When he was there / he began anon to pleye
As he was wont / and at him self to Iape
And finally he swore / and began her seye
Both this and that / she should him not escape
Ne make him longer / aftyr her to gape
But certainly / she must by her leave
Come soupe with him / at his house at eve
At which she lough / and began her self excusen
And said it reyneth / lo how should I gone
Lat be quoth he my fre^d / ne seond not thus and musen
This mote be done / ye shul be there anon
So at the last / krof they fyl at on
And ellis soft he swore her in her err
He would never come / there as she were
And she ageyn / began him for to rowne
And asked him / if Troylus were there
He swore her nay / for he was out of town
And said niece / I pose that he were there
Ye durst never have / the more fere
For rather than men / should him espy
Me were lever / a thousand fold to dye
Not list mine Auctour / fully to declaryn
What that she thought / when he said so
That Troylus was / out of town y faryn
As if he said / soth thereof or no
But that she grauntyd / with him for to go
Without nayeng / since he her besought
And as his niece / obeyed as her ought
But natheles than / began she him beseech
Al though with him to go / was no fere
For to be ware / of gostly peoples speech
That dremen things / which that never were
And well auyse him / whom he brought there
And said Eame / since I must you tryst
Look al be well / for I do as you list
He swore her tho / by stokkes and by stones
And by the goddis / that in heuene dwell
Or ellis were him lever / fell and bones
With Pluto king / as deep be in hell
As Cantalus / what should I longer dwell
When al was well / he roos and took his leave
And she to sonper come / when it was eve
With a certain / of her own men
And with her fair niece Antigone
And other of her wymmen / nine or ten
But who was glad / who as trow ye
But Troylus that stood / and might it see
Through a little wyndow / in a stewe
There he shet was / since mydnyght in a mewe
Vnwyst of every wight / but of Pandare
But now to purpos / when that she was come
With all Joy / and al frendis fare
Her Eame anon / in arms has her nome
And after to the sowper / al and som^e
When time was to sowper they be fette
God wot there was no deynte / for to set
And after sowper / began they to rise
At ease well / with hertis fressh and glade
And well was him / that cowd best deuyse
To lyken her / or to lawghen her made
He song she pleyde / he told a tale of wade
But at the last / as every thing has end
She took her leave / and nedis would home wend
But o fortune / executiyce of wyerdis
O influence / of the se heuenes hye
Sooth is that vndyr god / ye ben our hyerdis
Though to us / ben the causes w^ye
This mean I now / for she began homward hye
But execut^d was al / beside her leave
The goddis will / for which she must bleue
The bent moon / with her horns pale
Saturn and Juno in Cancro Joined were
That such a rain / from heuene began aua^^
That every man and womman that was there
Had of the smoky rain / a very fere
And Pandare lough tho / and said then
Now it were time / a lady go hen
But now good nece / if I might ever please
You any thing / than pray I you quod he
To do mine heart / as now so great an ease
As for to dwell here / this night with me
For niece this is yowre own house parde
Now be myry I sey / it is now no game
To wend now home / it were to me a shame
Criseyde which that cowde / qs much good
As half a world took heed of his prayer
And saw it rayned / and al was on a floode
She thought as good chepe may I dwell here
And grant it gladly / with a friendly chere
And have a thank / than grutche and than abide
For home to gone / it will not well betyde
I will quod she mine uncle lyef and dear
Sith that you list / it skyl is to be so
I am right glad / with you to dwellen here
I said but a game / that I would go
Ywys grant mercy / niece quod he tho
Were it a game / or sooth for to tell
I am now glad / sith that ye list dwell
Thus al is well / but tho bygan a right
The new Joy / and all the fest ageyn
But Pandarus / if goodely had he might
He would have hyed her / to bed full fayn
And said lord / this is a huge rayn
This were a wedyr / for to slepen ynne
And that I read us / soue to bygynne
And niece woote ye / where I shall you ley
For that we shul not / lygge fer a sonder
And for ye shul neither / dare I seye
Here noise of reyne / ne of thonder
By god right in my little closet yonder
And I will in that little house alone
By wardeyn / of your wymmen euerychone
And in this myddyl chamber that ye see
Shuln al your wymmen / sleepen fair and soft
And al within / shall yowre self be
And if ye lygge well to night / come more often
And carith not for the wedir / though it be aloft
The wine was brought / and when so that you lest
Than is it time / for to go to rest
There was no more / but thereafter soon
They void drank / and trauers draw anon
Began every wight / that had naught to done
More in the place / out of the chamber gone
And always in this mean while it rone
And blew therwyth / so wondyrly loud
That well nigh / noman other here cowde
Tho Pandarus / right as him ought
With wymmen syche / as were her nyh about
Full glad unto her beddis side her brought
And took their leave / and began full low loute
And said at this closet door / without
Right ouerthwert / your wymmen lyggen all
That whom ye list of hem / ye may soon call
So when she was in the closet leyde
And al her wymmen forth by ordinance
A bed were they / as I have you seyde
This was no more / to skippe ne to trance
But bodyn go to bed / with myschaunce
If any man was stiryng / any where
And let them sleep / that a bed were
But Pandarus / that well cowde each a dele
The old dance / and every point therein
When that he saw / that al thing was well
He thought he would / upon his werk begin
And began the styewe door / alsoft vnpynne
And still as stone / without longer let
By Troylus adoun / he by him set
And shortly to the point now for to gone
Of al this thing / he told him word and end
And said make the ready / right anon
For thou shall in to heuene blys wend
Now saint venus / thou me grace send
Quod Troylus / for never yet no need
Had I or now / ne halfuendel the dreede
Quod Pandarus / ne dread the never a dele
For it shall be right / as thou wylt desire
So thryue I this night / I shall make it well
Or cast all the growel / in the fire
That blysful venus / this night me enspyre
Quod Troylus as wys / as I the serve
And ever bet and bet / shall till I sterue
And if I had o Venus full of mirth
Aspectis bad of Mars or of Saturn
Or through combust / or let were in my birth
Thy fadyr pray / al thylk harm dystorne
Of grace / and that I glad ageyn may torn
For love of him / thou louedyst in the shawe
I mean Adeon / that with the bore was slawe
O Jove eke / for the love of the fair Europe
The which in form of a boole / awey the fet
Now help and Mars with thy bloody Cope
For love of Cipac / thou me not ne let
O Phoebus thynk / when Diane her self shet
Vndyr the bark / and ran awey for dread
Yet for her love / now help at this need
Mercury for the love / of her eeke
For which Pallas / was with Aglaurus wroth
Now help / Diane and eke I the beseke
That this vyage / be not to the loath
O fatal sustren / which or any cloth
Me shapen was / my destyne me sponne
So help to this werk that is here bygonne
Quod Pandarus / thou wretchyd mouses heart
Art thou aghast / so that the will the byte
Why do on this furryd cloak / upon thy shert
And follow me for I will have the wit
But bide and late me go / a fore a lyte
And with that word / he began undo the trappe
And Troylus he brought in by the lap
The stern wind / so loud gand to rowte
That no wight others noise / might here
And they that lay / at the door without
Full sikyrly they slept / al in feere
And Pandarus with a full sobre chere
Goth to the door anon / without let
There as they lay / and softly it shet
And as he come ageynward / full pryuely
His niece a wooke / and asked who is there
My dear niece quod he / it am I
Ne wondryth not / ne have of it no fere
And nere he come / and said her in her (...)
No word for the love of god I you beseech
Late no wight arise / and here of our speech
What which wey ben ye come been diate
Quod she and how / ^^us vnwys^ of hem ass
Here at this little trap door / quod ^e
Quod tho Creseyde / late me som^e wight call
O god forbede that it should befalle
Quod Pandarus / that ye such folly wrought
They might deem / that they never er thought
It is not good a sleepyng hound to wake
Ne give a wight / a cause to dyuyne
Yowre wymmen sleep / all I vndyrtake
So that for them / the heus men might mine
And sleep wol / that till the son shine
And when my tale brought is to an end
Unwise right as I come / so will I wend
Now niece mine / ye shul well vndyrstond
Quod he so as ye wymmen / do men all
That for to hold a man / long in hond
And him her lyef / and dear heart call
And make him an ^^e / above a call
I mean as love another / in the mean while
Se does her self a shame / and him a guyle
Now whereby that I tell you / al this
Ye wot your self as well as any wight
How that yowre love / al fully grauntyd is
To Troylus the worthyest knight
One of this world / and thereto trowth ye plight
That but it were on him a long / ye nold
Him never falsen / while ye live should
Now stant it thus / since I fro you went
This Troylus platly / for to seyn
Is through a gutter by a preuy went
In to my chamber come / in all this reyne
Vnwyst of any manner wight certain
Sauf of my self / as wysly have I Joy
And by the feyth / I owe Priam of Troy
And he is come / in such pain and dystresse
I trow he be / al fully wood by this
He suddenly mote fall / in to woodenesse
But god help / and why the cause is this
He seyth him told is / of a friend of his
How that ye should love / one horast
For sorrow of which / this night will be his last
Criseyde / which that al this wonder herd
Began therwyth / about her heart cold
And with a sygh / she suddenly answered
Alas I wend / who so talis told
My dear heart / would me not hold
So lightly falls / alas conceytis wrong
What harm they do / for now I live to long
Horast alas / and falsen Troylus
I know him not / god me help so quod she
Alas what wicked spyryte / told him thus
Now certis Eame / to morrow and I him see
I shall of that as fully excusen me
As ever did womman if that him like
And with that word / she began for to syke
O god quod she / so worldly selynesse
Which clerkis call / falls felycite
Y medlyd is / with many a bytternesse
Full anguysshous / that is god wot quod she
Condition / of vein prosperity
For either Joys / come not ay in feere
Or ellis no wight / has hem alwey here
O brutyl well / of worldly Joy unstable
With what wight / so that thou be or pleye
Either he wot that / thou art Joy mutable
Or wot it not / it mote be one of tweye
Now if he wot it not / how may he seye
That he has very Joy / and selynesse
That is of ignorance / ay in derknesse
Now if be wot / that Joy is transiterye
As every Joy / of worldly thing mote fle
Now eueryc^e / that has in memory
The dread of lesyng / makyth him that he
May in no porfit / sikernesse be
And if to leese his Joy / be set amyte
Than semyth that Joy / is wo^th but lyte
Wherefore I will dyffyne / in this manner
That trewly for ought / I can espy
There is no very well / in this world here
But o thou wicked / serpent Ialowsye
Thou mysbeleued / enuyous folly
Why have thou made Troylus / me vntryst
That never yet agylted him / that I wist
Quod pandarus / thus fallen is this cas
Why uncle mine quod she / ho told him this
Why does mine dear heart / thus alas
Ye wot ye neyce mine / quod he what is
I hope al shall be well / that is amys
For ye may qwenche al this / if ye lest
And does right so / I hold it for the best
So shall I do to morrow / ywys quod she
And god toforn / so that it shall suffice
To morrow alas / that were fair quod he
Nay nay it may not stand in this wise
For niece mine / thus written clerkis wise
That peril is / with dretchyng in y draw
Nay such abodis / ben not worth an hawe
Niece al thing has time / I dare a vow
For when a chamber a fire is / or an halle
Well more myster is / it suddenly rescowe
Than to dyspute / and ask among hem all
How this candel / in the straw did fall
A benedicite / for all that long fare
The harm is do / and fare well feld fare
And niece mine / ne take it not a gryef
If that ye suffer him / al night in this woo
God help me so / ye had him never lyef
That dare I sey / now there is but we two
But well I wot / ye will not do so
Ye be to wise / to do so great folly
To put his life / al night in Ieopardye
Had ye him never lyef / by god I ween
I had never thing so lyef / by god quod she
Now by my trowth quod he / that shall be seen
For since ye make this ensample / of me
If I al night / would him in sorrow see
For all the tresour / in the town of Troy
I bid god / never more have I Joy
Now lokyth than / if that ye be his love
To put al night his life in Ieopardye
For thing of naught / now by that lord above
Not only this delay / comyth of folly
But of malice / if I shall not lie ^
What platly / and ye see him in dystresse
Neither ye wisely don / ne gentylnesse
Quod tho Criseyde / will ye do o thing
And ye therwyth / shul s^ynt his dyscase
Have here and bare him / this blew ryng
For there is nothing / may him bettyr please
Save I my self / ne more his heart ease
And sey my dear heart / that his sorrow
Is causeles / and that he shall see to morrow
A ryng quod he / ye hasilwoode is shaken
Ye niece mine that ryng / must have a stone
That might ded men / alive maken
And such a ryng trow I / that ye have none
Discrecion out of your heed is gone
That feel I now quod he / and that is rowth
O time y lost well may thou curs slowth
Wot ye not well / that noble and hye courage
Ne sorowyth not / ne styntyth not for lyte
But if a fool / were in a Ialous rage
I nold set at his sorrow a myte
But feffe him / with a few wordis white
Another day when I might him find
But this thing stant al / in another kind
He is so gentyl / and so tender of heart
That with his death / he will his sorrow wreke
For trustyth well / how sore that him smert
He will to you / no Ialous word speak
And for thy niece / or that his heart break
So speak yowre self / to him of this matere
For with oo word / ye may his heart stere
Now have I told / what peril he is ynne
And his coming vnwyst of every wight
And parde harm may there be / none ne sin
I will my self be with you al this night
Ye / know well eke / he is your own knight
And that by right / ye must upon him tryst
And I al pressed to fetch / him when ye list
This accydent / so pytous was to here
And eke so like a soth / at pryme face
And Troylus her knight / to her so dear
His pryuy coming / and the siker place
That though she did him / as than a grace
Considred al things / as they stood
No wonder is since / she did al for good
Criseyde answered / as wysly god at rest
My soul bring / as me is for him woe
And Eame ywys feign would I do the best
If that I had grace / to do so
But whethyr that ye dwell / of for him go
I am till god / me bettyr mind send
At Dulcarnon / at my wits end
Quod Pandarus / ye niece will ye here
Dulcarnon is callid flemyng of wretchis
It semyth hard for wretchis will not here
For very slowth / and other wylful tetchis
This said he by hem / yt be not worth two fetchis
But ye be wise / and have this matere in hand
Nys another hard / ne skillful to withstonde
Than Eame quod she / does hereof as ye list
But or he come / I will first arise
And for the love of god / since al my tryst
Is on you two / and ye both wise
So wyrkyth now / in so dyscrete a wise
That I honor may have / and he plesaunce
For I am here now / in your governance
This is well said quod he / my nece dear
Good thryft came on that / wise gentyl heart
But liggyth still / and takith him right here
It nedyth not / no further for him stert
And each of you / ease other sorrows smert
For soon hope I / we shul all be merry
For love of god / and venus I the hery
This Troylus full soon / on knees him set
Full sobyrly right by her beddis head
And in his best wise / his lady grette
But lord so she was / suddenly read
Ne though men should / smite of her head
She might not o word / a right out bring
So suddenly for his soo^e coming
But Pandarus / that so well cowd feel
In every thing to pleye / anon bygan
And said niece / see how this lord can knele
Now for your trowth / see this gentylman
And with that word he for a qwysshon ran
And said now knelyth / while that you list
That god yowre hertis / bring soon at rest
Can I not seyn / for she had him not rise
If sorrow it put / out of remembrance
Or ellie that she took it / ^n this wise
Of dyew^e / as for hy^ obeysaunce
But well I read / she did him this plesaunce
That she him kyst ^ al though he sighed sore
And bud him (...) a d^un / wythout^n more
Quod Pandarus now will ye well bygynne
Now does him (...) / good niece (...)
Upon yowre beddis s^de / al wythynne
That each of you the ^et ^ay other here
And with that word he drew him to the fire
And took a light / and feyned his contenaunce
As for to look ^vpon an old romaunce
Criseyde that was / Troylus lady right
And clear stood / on a ground of sikernesse
Al though she her servant / and her knight
He should of right / none vntrowth in her guess
Yet natheles / considered his dystresse
And that love to / in cause of such folly
Thus to him sp^ck she / of his Ialousye
Lo heart mine / as would the excellence
Of love / against the which ^oman may
Ne ought eke goodely / make resistance
And eke by cause / I felt well and say
Yowre great trowth / and service every day
And yt yowre heart al mine was / sooth to seyne
This drove me / to rewe upon your pain
And your goodness have I found alwey yet
Of which my dear heart / and my knight
I thank it you / as fer as I have wit
Al can I not / as much as it were right
And I hensforth my connyng / and my might
Have and ay shall / how sore that me smert
Be to you true / and hole with al mine heart
And dredeles that shall be found at preue
But heart mine / what al this is to said
Shall well be told / so that ye you not grieve
Though I to you right / on yowre self co^pleyne
For therwyth mean I / finally the pain
That holt your heart / and mine in heaviness
Fully to slene / and every wrong redress
My good heart not I / for why ne how
That Ialowsye alas / that wyckid wyuere
So causeles is cropen / in to you
The harm of which / I would feign delyuere
Alas that ye al hool / or of him a shyuere
Should have his refute / in so dygne a place
That Jove out soon / out of your heart him race
But o thou Jove / auctour of nature
Is this an hononr / unto thy deyte
That folk unguilty / suffer here Iniure
And he that gylty is / vnquyt goth he
O were it leeful / for to pleyne / on the
That undeserved / suffrist Ialowsye
Of that I would / upon the pleyne and cry
Eke al my woo is this / that men now vsen
To seye right thus / that Ialowsye is love
And would a busshel of venym all excusen
For that one greyn of love / is in shoue
But that wot the hye god / that sit above
If it be syker love / hate or grame
And after that / it ought to bear his name
But certain is / som^e manner Ialowsye
Is excusable / more than som^e ywys
As when cause / and som^e such fantasye
With pity so well / repressid is
That it uneath does / or says amys
But goodely drynkyth up / all his dystresse
And that excuse I / for the gentylnesse
And som^e so full / of furye and dyspyte
That it surmountyth / his repressioun
But heart mine / ye be not in this plyte
That thank I god / for which your passioun
I will not call it but an Illusioun
Of habundaunce of love / and besy cure
That does your heart / this disease endure
Of which I am right sorry / but not wroth
But for my desire / and your hertis rest
Whether so you list / by ordal or by oath
By sort or be what wise / so that you lest
For love of god / late preue it for the best
And if that I be gylty do me deye
Alas what might I more / done or seye
With that a few / bright teeris new
Out of her eyes fyl / and thus she seyde
Now god thou wost / in thought ne deed untrue
To Troylus was never yet Criseyde
With that her hond / down in the bed she leyde
And with the shete it wryed / and sighed sore
And held her pees / not a word spack she more
But now help god / to qwenche al this sorrow
So hope I that he shall / for he best may
For I have seen / a full mysty morrow
Follow full often / a myry somer day
And after winter follows grene may
Men seen alday / and read eke in stories
That after sharp showers / ben vyctoryes
This Troylus / when he her wordis herd
Have ye no care / him list not to sleep
For it thought him / no strokes of a yerd
To here or see / Criseyde his lady weep
But well he felt / about his heart crepe
For every teere / which that Criseyde as^ert
The cramp of does / streyneth him by the heart
And in his mind / he began the time acurse
That he came there / or that he was bore
For now is wycke / tornyd in to worse
And all the labor / he has do before
He thought it lost / he wend he nas but lore
O Pandarus alas thought he / thy wyle
Seruyth of naught / so welawey the while
And there wythal / he hyng a down the heed
And fyl on knees / and sorowfully he sight
What might he say / he felt he nas but deed
For wroth was she / yt should his sorrows light
But natheles when he speak might
Than said he thus / god wot that of this grame
When al is wist / than am I not to blame
Therwyth the sorrow / of his heart shette
That from his eyes / fyl there not a teere
And every spyryte / his vygour in knette
So they astonyed / and oppressed were
The feelyng of his sorrow / and of his chere
Or of ought ellis / fled was out of town
A down he fyl all suddenly / in a swowne
This was no little / sorrow for to see
For all was huysht / but Pandare up at the last
O niece peace / or we be bost quod he
Be not aghast / but alwey at the last
For this or that / he him in to the bed cast
And said thyef / is this a man's heart
And of he rent / al to his bare shert
And said niece / but ye help us now
Ywys your own / Troylus is born
Alas so would I / and I wist how
Full feign quod she / alas that I was born
Ye ne^^ will ye pull out the thorn
That scikyth in his heart / quod Pandare
Sey al foryeue / and stynt all this care
Ye that to me quod she / lever were
Than all the good / the senne about goth
And therwythal she swore him in his cere
Y wys my dear heart / I am not wroth
Have here my trowth and many another oath
Now speak to me / for it am I Creseyde
But al for naught / yet might he not abreyde
Tho Troylus / began sorowfully to syke
Lest she were / wroth him thought his heart deyde
And said alas / upon my sorrows syke
Have mercy on me / sweet heart mine Criseyde
And if that in the wordis / that I feyde
Be any wrong I will no more crespace
Does as you list / I put me in your grace
Criseyde answered of gylt myseryoord
That is for to sey / I foryeue al this
And evermore on this night record
And beth well ware / ye do no more amys
Nay dear heart mine / quod he ywys
And now quod she / that I have do you smert
Foryeue it me / mine own sweet heart
Tho Troylus with bus / of that supprysed
Put all in goddis hond / as he that meant
Nothing but well / and suddenly auysed
He her in arms / fast to him hent
And Pandarus / with full good intent
Laid him to sleep / and said if ye be wise
Swowne not now / lest mo folk arise
What might or may / the sely lark sey
When that the sperhawke / has it in his foot
I can no more / but of this ylke twey
To whom this tale / sugre he or swoote
Though that I tarry a year / som^tyme I mote
After mine auctour / tell of their gladness
As well as I have / told their heaviness
Criseyde with that / felt her thus y take
As written clerkis / in their books old
Right as an aspen leef / she began to quake
When she her felt / in his arms fold
And Troylus al hool / of his cares cold
Began thankyn tho / the bright goddis seuene
That sundry peynes / bryngen folk to heuene
This Troylus in arms began her streyne
And said o sweet / as ever mote I gone
Now be ye caught / there nys but we tweyne
Now yeldyth you / for other boot is none
To that Criseyde / answered thus anon
Ne had I er now / my sweet heart dear
Be yolden ywys / I were not now here
O sooth is said / that helyd for to be
As of a fever / or another great sikenesse
Men must drynk alday / as men may see
Full bitter drynk / and for to have gladness
Men duren of pain / and great dystresse
I mean it here / as of this adventure
That through a pain / has found now his cure
And now swetnesse / semyth more sweet
That bytternesse assayed / was byforn
For out of woo / in bliss now they fleet
None such they felt / since that they were born
Now is this bet / than both two be lorn
For love of god / take every womman heed
To work thus / when it comyth to need
Criseyde al quyte / from every dread and teene
As she that just cause had him to tryst
Made him such feeste / that Joy it was to seen
When she his trowth / and clean intent wist
And as about a tree / with many a twyst
By^^ent and wrythe / the soote woodebynde
Began each of hem / in arms other wind
And as the new / abashed nyghtyngale
That styntyth first / or she begin to sing
When she heryth / any hyerdis tale
Or in the hedgis / any wight styryng
And after sikernesse / her voys does out ryng
Right so Criseyde / when that her dread stent
Opend her heart / and told al her intent
And right as he / that saw his death y shapen
And dye must / in aught that he began guess
And suddenly rescous / does him escapen
And from his death / is brought in sykernesse
For all this world / right in such gladness
Is Troylus / and has his lady sweet
With wors hay / god let us never meet
Her arms small / her straight back and soft
Her sides long flesshly smoth and white
He began to stroke / and bad good thryft full often
Her snowysh throat / her brestis round and lyte
Thus in this heuene / he began him delight
And therwythal / a thousand time her kyst
That for what to do / for Joy uneath he wist
Than said he thus / o love o charity
Thy mother eeke / Citherea the sweet
After thy self / next heryed be she
Venus mean I / the well wylly planete
And next Ymeneus / I the great
For never man was / to you goddis hold
As I that ye have / brought from cares cold
Benygne love / thou holy bond of things
Who so will grace / and list not the honor
Lo his desire will fle / without wings
For thou noldyst of bounte / hem socoure
That seruen best / and alwey most labor
But if thy grace / passed our desertis
Al were lost / that I dare sey certis
And for thou me / that cowd best deserve
Of hem that nombred be unto thy grace
Have helped there / I lykly was to sterue
And me bystowed / in so high a place
That ilke boundis / may no blis pace
I can no more / but lawde and reverence
Be to thy bounte / and thyn excellence
And there wythal / Criseyde anon he kyst
Of which certain / she felt no disease
And thus said he / now would god I wist
Mine heart sweet / how I might you please
What man quod he / was ever thus at ease
As I on whom / the fairest and the best
That ever I say / deyneth her heart to rest
Here may men see / that mercy passyth right
Thexperience of this / is felt in me
That am unworthy / to you my lady bright
But heart mine / of yowre benygnyte
So thynkyth though I unworthy be
Yet mote need / amend in som^e wise
Right through the virtue / of yowre hye seruyse
And for the love of god my lady dear
Since god has wrought me / for you ever to serve
As thus he will / that ye be my stere
To do me live / if that ye list or sterue
So techyth me how that I may deserve
Yowre thank / so that I through mine Ignorance
Ne do nothing / that do you dysplesaunce
For certis fressh wommanly wife
The day is since / that trowth and dylygence
Ye s^^l in me fynden al my life
I nyl certain / break yowre defense
And if I do / present or in absence
For love of god / (...) slay me with the deed
If that it like / unto yowre wommanshede
Y wys quod she / mine own hertis lust
My ground of ca^e / and al mine heart dear
G^^mercy / for on that to al my trust
But let us fulle away / from this matrre
For this suffysitt^^ / which that is said here
And a^ ^o word / without repentance
Well come my knight / my (...) / my suffysaunce
Of their delight or Joyce / one the lest
Were in possible / in my wit to sey
But Iugyth ye / that han ben at the feast
Of such gladness if / (...) lys^ pley
I can no more / but (...) thy^ ylke twey
That night betwyxt / dread and sikernesse
They felt in love / the gre^^ worthynesse
O blysful night / of whom so long I sought
How blyth unto hem both / thou were
Why ne had I such one / with my foul y bought
Ye for the lest Joy / that was there
Awey thou foul danger / and thou fere
And let hem / in this heaven blys dwell
That is so hye that noman can tell
These ylk two / that been in arms laft
So both to hem / a sundre to gd it were
That each of hem from other / wend byraft
Or ellis lo thus / was their most fere
Lest al this thing / but nyce dreams were
For which full often / each of them seyde o sweet
Clyppe I you thus / or ellis do I meet
And lord so he began / goodely on her see
That never his look / blent from her face
And said o dear heart / how may it be
That it be sooth / that ye be in this place
Ye heart mine / god thank I of his grace
Quod tho Cryseyde / and there withal him kyst
That where his spyryte was / for Joy he nyst
This Troylus full often / her eyes two
Began for to kiss / and said o eyes clear
It were ye / that wrought me this woo
Ye humble nettis / of my lady dear
Though there be mercy / written in yowre chere
God wot that (...) / full hard is sooth to find
How cowde ye / without bond me bind
Therwyth he began her fast in arms take
And well a thousand time / began he syke
Not such sorrowful syghes / as men make
For sorrow or ellis / when that folk be sike
But easy syghes / such as ben to like
That showed his affection within
Of such syghes / cowde he not blyn
Soon aftyr this / they spack of sundry things
As fyl to purpos / of their adventure
And pleyeng / entrechaungeden rings
Of which I can tell no scripture
But well I wot / a broche of gold and asure
In which a Ruby set / was like an heart
Cnseyde him yaf / and stak it on his shert
Lord trow ye / that a covetous wretch
That blames love / and has of it dyspyte
That of the pene / that he can moore and ^etche
Was ever yet give to him such delight
As is in love / in som^e manner plyte
Nay douteles / for as so god me save
So parfyte Joy / may no nygard have
They will sey yis / but lord so they lie
The besy wretchys / full of woo and dread
They clepe love a woodenes a or furye
But it fall hem / as I shall now read
They shut forgo / both the white and the read
And live in woo / there god give hem myschau^ce
And every lover / in his trowth auaunce
As would god / these wretches that despise
Service of love / had eris also long
As had Mida / full of couetyse
And thereto dronken had / as hot and strong
As Crassus did / for his affectis wrong
To teache hem that couetyse is vice
And love is virtue / though men hold it nyce
These ylke two / of which that I you seye
When that their hertis / fully assurid were
Tho began they to speak / and to pleye
And eke rehersen / how and when and where
They knew first / and every woo and fere
That passid was / but all that heaviness
Y thankyd god / was turned in to gladness
And evermore / when they fyl to speak
Of any woo / of such a time agone
With kyssyng / all that tale should break
And fallyn in a new Joy anon
And did all their might / since they were one
For to recover Elis / and be at ease
And peysed woo / with Joy countrepease
Reason will not / that I now speak of sleep
For it accordyth not / to my matere
God wot they took of that / full little keep
But lest this night / that was to him so dear
Ne should in vain / escape in no manner
It was byset / in Joy and business
Of all that sowneth / in to gentylnesse
But how al though / I can not tell al
As can mine auctour / of his excellence
Yet have I said / and god tofore I shall
In every thing / the great of his sentence
And if that I at loves reverence
Have any thing / echyd for the best
Do therwythal / right as you self lest
For my wordis / here and in every part
I speak hem all / under correction
Of you that felyng have / in louys art
And I put hem hole / in your dyscrecion
To increase / and make dymynucion
Of my langage / and I you byseche
But now to purpos / of my rather speech
When that the cok / the comune astrologer
Began on his breast to beat / and after crow
And Lucifer / the days messanger
Began for to rise / and out her stream throw
And Estward was to him / yt cowde it know
Fortuna mayor / that anon Criseyde
With heart sore / to Troylus thus she said
Mine hertis life / my trust and my plesaunce
That I was born / alas that me is woo
This day we mote / make dysseueraunce
For time is to rise / and hens go
Or ellis I am lost / for euermo
O night alas why nyl thou / over us houe
As long as when / Almena lay by Jove
O blake night / as men in books reed
That shapyn art by god / this world to hyde
At certain times / with thy black wede
That vndyr that / men might in rest abide
Well ought bestis pleyne / and folk the chyde
That there as day / with labor would us breast
That thou us fleest / and late us have no rest
Thou do alas / to shortly thyn office
Thou rakel night / there god maker of kind
For thou so dounward / hastyst of malice
Thy course / and to our Emyspery bind
That neuermore / vndyr our ground the wind
For through the rakel hyeng out of Troy
Have I forgo / thus hastyly my Joy
This Troylus that with the wordis felt
As thought him tho / for pytous dystresse
The blody teeris / from his heart melt
As he that never / yet such heaviness
Assayed had / out of so great gladness
Began her wythal / Criseyde his lady dear
In arms streyne / and said in this manner
O cruel day / accuser / of the Joy
That love and night / have stole and fast wryen
Accursid be the coming / in to Troy
For every loore / with one of thy bright eyes
Enuyous day / what list the to espyen
What have you lost / what sekest thou in this place
There god thy sight / so qwenche for his grace
Alas what have these lovers / the agylt
Dyspytous day / thine be the pyt of hell
Fin many a lover / have thou slain and wylt
Thy powryng in / will nowher let hem dwell
What proferest thou thy light / here for to selle
Go sell it hem / that small sealis grave
We will the not / us nedyth no day to have
And eke the son Titan / would he chyde
And said fool / well may men the despise
Thou have al night / the dawnyng by thy side
And soeffryst her so soon / from the rise
For to depart^n lovers / in this wise
What hold thy bed / thou and eke thy morrow
I pray to god / so give you both sorrow
Therwyth full sore he sighed / and thus seyde
My lady right / and of my well and woe
The very root / o goodely mine Cryseyde
And shall I rise / alas and shall I so
Now feel I that / mine heart mote a two
For how should I / my life an hour save
Sith that with you / is al my life I have
What shall I do / for certis I note how
Ne when alas / I may the time y see
That in this place I may be eft with you
And of my life / god wot / how that shall be
So that desire / right now so strayneth me
That I am ded anon / but I return
How should I long alas / fro you soiourne
But natheles / mine own lady bright
If it were so / that I wist vttyrly
That I your servant / and yowre knight
Were in your heart / shet as fermely
As ye in mine / the which thing trewly
Me lever were / than these worldis tweyne
Yet should I bet endure / al my pain
To that Criseyde / answered thus anon
And with a sygh / she said heart dear
The game ywys / so ferforth now is gone
That erst shall Phoebus / fall from his spear
And every Egle be the hawkis feere
And every rock / out of his place stert
Or Troylus go out / of Criseydes heart
With that she began / her face for to wrye
With the sheet / and wax for shame al read
And Pandarus / began vndyr for to prye
And said nee^e / if that I shall be deed
Have here my swerd / and smite of mine heed
With that his arm / al suddenly he thryst
Vndyr her neck / and at the last her kyst
I pass all that / which needyth not to seye
What god foryaf his death / and she also
Foryaf / and with her uncle began to pleye
For other cause was there none than so
But of this thing / right to theffecte to go
When time was / hom to her house she went
And Pandarus / has holy his intent
Now torn we again / to Troylus
That restles / full long abed lay
And pryuely sent after Pandarus
To him to come / in all the have he may
He come anon not ones said he nay
And Troylus / full sobyrly him grette
And down on his beddis side him set
This Troylus / with all the affection
Of friendly love / that heart may deuyse
To Pandarus / on knees fyl a down
And or that he would / of that place arise
He began him thank / in the best wise
A thousand times / and began the day to bless
That he was born / to bring him from dystresse
And said o friend / of frendis altherbest
That ever was the sooth for to tell
Thou have in heuene / brought my soul at rest
Fro Cochita / the fyry flood of hell
And though I might / a thousand times selle
Upon a day / my life in thy seruyse
It might not amounte / ne in that suffyse
The son which that all the world may see
Was never yet my life / dare I sey
So inly fair / so goodely as is she
Whose I am and shall / till that I deye
And that I thus am here / I dare well seye
That thankyd be the hye worthynesse
Of love and eke / thy kind business
Thus have thou me / not a little give
For which oblyged be / to the for ay
My life for why / for through thy help I live
Or ellis ded had I be / gone many a day
And with that word / down in his bed he lay
And Pandarus / full sobyrly him herd
Till al was seyde / and than he thus answered
My dear friend / if I have do for the
In any caas / god wot it is me lyef
And am as glad / as man of it may
God help me so / but take it not agryef
For love of god / beware of this meschyef
That there as now / brought art to thy bliss
That thou thy self / ne cause it not to mysse
For of fortunes sharp aduersyte
The worst kind of infortune is this
A man to have be in prosperyte
And it remember / when it passid is
Thou art wise ynow / for why do not amys
Be not to rakel / though thou sit warm
For if thou do / certain it will the harm
Thou art at ease / hold the now therein
For all so sure / as ready is ever fire
As great a craft is / to keep well as wyn
Bridle thy speech / and thy desire
For worldly Joy / holt not but by a wyre
That preuyth well / it breast alwey so often
For thy need is / to worche wyle it is soft
Quod Troylus I hope / and god (...)

Ne I nyl do / as for to greuen here
It nedyth not this matter / often to stere

Tho began he tell him / of his glad night
And wh^rof his heart / dred and how
And said fr^nd / as I am true knight
And by the feyth / I owe to god and you
I had it never / half so hotr as now
And ay the more / that desire me bytith
To love her lest / the more me desytith
I not my self wysly / what it is

The beauty of his right lady (...)
And Pandarus / to thynk and make him (...)
This cale was alwey / span new to begin
Till that the night / departed hem a twynne
Soon aftyr this / for that fortune it would
Y comen was / the blysful time sweet
That Troylus was warned / that he should
There he was erst / Criseyde his lady meet
For which he felt / in Joy his heart fleet
And feythfully / began all the goddis h^rye
And late see now / if that he can be merye
And holden was the form / and all the wise
Of her coming / and eke of his also
As it was erst which nedyth not to deuyse
But plainly / to theffect for to go
In Joy and seurte / Pandarus hem two
A bed brought / when hem both best
And thus they be / in quyete and in rest
Not nedyth to you / si^h they ben met
To ask of me if they blyth were
For if it erst was well / tho was it bet
A thousand fold / this nedyth not to enquere
Agon was every care / and every fere
And both ywys they had / and so they wend
As much Joy / as heart may comprehend
This is no little thing / of for to sey
This passyth every / wight / for to deuyse
For each of hem / began others lust obey
Felicyte which that these clerkis wise
Commendyn so / ne may not here suffyse
This Joy may not / written be with ynk
It passyth all that / any heart may thynk
But cruel day / so welaway the stounde
Began for to approach / as they be signs knew
For which hem thought / feelen dethis wound
So woo was hem / that chaungen began their hew
And they bygan / to despise al new
Calling it traitor enuyous and wors
And byttyrly the day light they curs
Quod Troylus alas / now am I ware
That Pierers / and the swyft styedis three
Which that drawn forth / the sons chare
Han gone som^e bypath / in dyspyte of me
That makyth it so soon / day to be
And for the son / hastyth him thus to rise
Ne shall I never do efte him sacryfyse
But needis day / depart must hem soon
And when their speech done was / and their chere
They twynne anon / as they be wont to done
And setten time / of metyng eft in feere
And many a night they wrouht in this manner
And thus fortune / a time lad hem in Joy
Criseyde and eke / the kings sone of Troy
In suffysaunce / in blys / and in syngynges
Thus Troylus began al his life to lead
He spendyth Iustyth / and makyth festynges
He yeuyth freely often / and chaungyth weed
And holt about him / ay without dread
A world of folk / as came him well of kind
The fresshest and the best / that he cowde find
That such a voys of him / was and a steuene
Through out the world / of honor and largess
That it up rong / to the yate of heuene
And as in love / he was in such gladness
That in his heart / he demyth as I guess
That there nys lover / in this world at ease
So well as he / and thus began love him please
The goodely head and bounte / which that kind
In any other lady / had y set
Can not the mountenaunce / of a knot unbind
About his heart / of al Criseydes net
He was so narow / masked and y knet
That it to undo / on any manner side
That will not be / for aught that may betyde
And by the hond / full often he would take
This pandarus / and in to the gardyn leede
And such a fest / and such a process make
Him of Criseyde / and of her wommanheede
And of her beauty / eke wythouten dread
It was an heuene / his wordis for to here
And than he would sing / in this manner
Love that of earth and see / has in governance
Love that his hestis / has in heuenes hye
Love that with / an holsum alyaunce
Holt peoples Joined as he lest hem gye
Love that endueth / law of company
And cowples does / in virtue for to dwell
Bynd this accord / that I have told and tell
That / that the world / with feyth that is stable
Dyuersith so his stoundis / concordyng
That Elementis / that been so dyscordable
Holt in a bond perpetuelly during
That Phoebus must / his rosy day forth bring
And the moon have lordship over the nyghtis
Al this does Love al / heryed be his myghtis
That that the sea / gredy is to flowyn
Constreyneth / to a certain end so
As floodes that so fresshly / they ne growyn
To drenche the earth / and al for euermo
And if that love ought let / his brydel go
And that now lyuyth / a sundre should keep
And lost were al / that love now holt to hepe
So would god that auctours of kind
That with his bond of love / of his virtue list
So serchen hertis al / and fast bynd
That from his bond / no wight out ye wey wist
And hertis cold hem would I / that he twyst
To make hem love / and that hem list ay rewe
On hertis sore / and keep hem that been true
In all needis / for the towns werre
He was and ay first / in his arms dyght
And certeynly / but if that books err
Save Hector most dred / of any wight
And this encres / of hardynes and might
Come him of love / his lady for to win
That alterid his spyrit so wythynne
And most of virtue / and love was his speech
And in dyspyte / had all wretchydnesse
And douteles no need / was him beseech
To honor hem / that haddyn worthynesse
And ^asen hem / that were in dystresse
And glad was / if any wight well ferd
That lover was / when he it wist and herd
Forsooth to seyn / ^e loste^ held every wight
But if he were / in loves hye seruyse
I mean folks / that ought be by right
And over al this / so well cowde he deuyse
Of sentement / and in so vncowth wise
Al his a^^y / that every lover thought
That al was well / what so he said or wrought
And al though he come / of blood ^oyal
Him lyse not of pride / at no wight to chase
Benygne he was / to each in general
For whyc^^ he ga^e him help / in every place
^^us would love / y heryed be his grace
That pride and Ire / envy and auaryer
He began to flee / and many another vy^^
Thou lady bright / doughtyr to Dione
Thy blind and wynged soon / dan Cupide
Yowre sust^yn eke / that ^y E^oone
In hyst Pernaso / lysten for to abide
That ye thus far / have deyned me to guide
I can no more but since that ye will wend
Y heryed be ye for ay / wythouten end
In time of tryews / on l^wkynge would be ride
Or ellis hunt Bore - Bear or Lyoun
The small bes^is / let he go beside
And when that he come / rydyng to the town
Full often his lady / from the wyndow down
As fressh as faw^^n / comyth out of mewe
Full ready was him / goodely to salewe
Now have I you said / fully in my song
Theffect and Joy / of Troylus seruyse
Al be that there was / som^e disease among
As mine auctour / lystyth to deuyse
My thryd book / now end I in this wise
And Troylus in lust / and in quyete
Is with Criseyde / his own lady sweet
Here Ends the third Book And follows the Fourth Book
Here ends the third book of Troylus
And here begins the prolog of the fourth book
But al to little well awey the while
Lastyth such joy blyssed he fortune
That seems trewest when she does begyle
And can to fools so her song entune
That she does hent and blent as traitor comune
And when a wight is from her whele I throw
Than laughyth she and makes him a mow
From Troylus began she her bright face
Awey to wrye and took of him none head
But cast him clean al out of her grace
And on her whele she set up Dyomede
For which right now mine heart gynneth blede
And now my pen alas with which I write
Qnaketh for dread of that I must endyte
For how Creseyde Troylus forsook
Or at the lest how that she was unkind
Mote be hens forth matter of my book
As written folk through which it is in mind
Alas that ever she should cause find
To speak her harm / and if they on her lie
Ywys hem self shall have the vylonye
O ye Herynes nyghtes daughters three
That endeles complain ever in pain
Megera Allecto and eke Thesyphone
Thou cruel mars eke fader to Quyryne
This ylk fourth book help me to fine
So that the loos and love and life y fere
Of Troylus be fully showed here
Here ends the prologe
And begins the fourth book
lYggyng in host as I have told (...) this
The greeks strong about Troy town
Befell yt when phoebus began shine ywis
Upon the breast of hercules lyoun
That Hector with full many a bold baroun
Cast on a day with greeks for to fight
As he was wont to grieve hem if he might
Note I how long or short it was between
This purpoos and that day they fight meant
But on a day well bright and sheene
With spear in hond and bygge bows bent
Hector and many a worthy knight out went
And in the berde anon withouten let
Her foomen in the feld hem fast met
The long day with speres sharp y ground
With arrwes / darts / swerdes / maces fell
They fight and bring horse and man to ground
And with their axes out the brains quelle
But in the last shoure forth for to tell
The folk of Troy hem self so mysledde^
That with ye wors ho^ward at nyt they fledd^^
At which day was taken Anthen(...)
Maugre Pollymydas or Mon^sryo
Xandype / Sarpedon / Palestyn^^e
Polyte or eke the Troyan Ry^^^o
And other less folk as Phebuseo
So that for harm that day the folk of Troy
Dirdden to leefe a great part of their joy
But netheles a trewes was there take
At greeks request and tho they began treat
Of prisoners a change for to make
This thing anon was couth in every street
And for the surplus youen sommes great
Both in the syege and Town and every where
And with the first it came to Calcas ere
When Calcas knew the treatys should hold
In concystory among greeks sone
He began in thryng forth with lords old
And set him there as he was wont to done
And with their chaungyng he had hem a bone
For love of god to do that reverence
To stynt noise and give him audyence
Than said he thus loo lords mine I was
Trojan as it is know out of dread
And if ye remember I am Calcas
That alther first yaf comfort to your need
And told well how ye should speed
For dredeles through you shall in a sconde
This Troy be brent and drawn down to ground
And in what form / and in what manner wise
This town to shende / and al your lust to ach^ue
Ye have or this me herd well deuyse
This known ye my lords as I leave
And for the greeks were me so leave
I come my self in my proper person
To teache in this what ye were best to done
Having upon my tresour ne my rent
Right no respect to respect of your case
Thus al my good I left and to you went
Wenyng in this my lords you to plese
But all this loss does me no dysese
I vouchesauf as wisely have I joy
For you to lose all that I have in Troy
Sauf of a daughter that I left alas
Slepyng at home when out of Troy I stert
O stern and cruel fader that I was
How might I have in that so hard an heart
Alas I ne had brought her in my shert
For sorrow of which I wol not leave to morrow
But if ye lords rewe upon my sorrow
For by that cause I saw no time or now
Her to delyuere hold I have my pees
But now or never if it like you
I may her have right sone douteles
O help and grace among all this pres
Rewe on me old Caytyf here in dystres
Sith I for you have all this heaviness
Ye have now caught and fethered in prysoun
Trojans ynow / and if your will be
My child with one may have redempcyo^^
Now for the love of god and of your bounte
One of so feel alas so give him me
What need were this prayer for to werne
Sith ye shall have both town and folk as yerne
On peril of my life I shall not lie
Appollo has me told it feythfully
I have it found eke by astronomye
By sort by angury eke trewely
And dare well say the time is fast by
That fire and flame on all the town shall sprede
And thus shall Troy tornen in to a asshen deed
For certain phoebus and neptunus both
That maden the wallys of the town
Ben with folk of Troy now so wroth
They will eft bring it to confusyon
Right for despyte of king Laomedon
By cause he nold pay hem her huyre
The town shall yet be set on a fuyre
Tellyng his tale alwey this old gray
Humble in speech / and in his lokyng eke
The salt teres from his eyes twey
Full fast run down by either cheke
So long he began of socour hem byseke
That for to hele him of his syghes sore
They yafe him Anthenore withouten more
But who was glad ynow but Calcas tho
And of al thing full sone is leyde
On hem that should for the treatyce gone
To bring hem king Thoas and Creseyde
And hem for Anthenor full often preyde
And when Pryamus his sauf guard sent
The Ambassatours full streyghte to Troy went
The cause told of their coming / the old
Pryamus king full sone in general
Do here upon his parliament to hold
Of which the effect rehercen you I shall
The Ambassatours ben ansuerd for fynal
The change of prisoners and all this deed
Hem lyketh well and so they forth proceed
This Troylus was present in the place
When asked was for Anthenore Creseyde
For which full soon changed he his face
As he that with the wordys full nyhe deyde
But netheles he no word to it seyde
With man's heart he began his sorrow dry
Lest men should his affectyoun aspye
And full of anguysshe and of besy dread
Abode what other lords would sey
And if they wol grant as god forbede
Theschau^ge of her than thout he things twey
First for to save her honor and what wey
He might best theschaunge of her wythstonde
Full fast he cast / how all this thing myt stand
Love him made al pressed to make her bide
Or rather dye than she should go
But reason him said on that other side
Without assent of her ne do not so
Lest thou her wrath / and she than be thy foo
And say that through thy medlyng is y blow
Your bother love there it was erst unknow
For which he began desyberyn to the best
That though the lords would that she went
He would let hem grant what he^ fest
And tell his lady first what they meant
And when that she had said him her intent
Thereafter would he werk / also blyue
Though all the world again it would strive
Hector which that right well the greeks herd
For Anthenore how they would have Creseyde
Began it wythstonde and so breuely ansuerd
Syrs she nys no prisoner he seyde
I not on you who this charge leyde
But on my party may eftsone hem tell
We use not here no wymmen for to selle
The noise of the people up stert than al at ones
As breme as blase of straw set a fire
For infortune it would for the nones
They should their confusyon desire
Hector quod they what ghost may you enspyre
This woman thus to sheld / and do us lose
Daune Anthenore a wrong wey now ye chese
That is so wise and so bold a baroun
And we have need of folk as men may see
He is eke one of the gretest of this town
Save Hector / let tho fantasyes be
Of king Pryamus quod they thus seye we
That al our voys is to forgo Creseyde
And to delyuere Anthenore they preyde
O Iuuenal lord full soth is thy sentence
That little wyten folk what is to yerne
That they ne find in her desire offense
For clowd of error let hem to dyscerne
What lest is / loo here ensample as yerne
This folk desire now delyueraunce
Of Anthenore that brought hem to myschaunce
For he was after traitor to the town
Of Troy alas they quyte him out to rathe
O nyce world lo thy dyscrecyoun
Creseyde which that never did hem skathe
Shall now no longer in her bliss bathe
But Anthenore shall come home to town
And she shall out / thus al they said and sown
For which delyuerd was by parliament
For Anthenore to yeuen out Creseyde
And it pronounced by the presydent
And though that Hector nay full often preyde
That finally what wight that it wythseyde
It was for naught it must be and should
For substance of the parliament it would
Departed out of parliament echone
This Troylus without words moo
In to his chamber sped him fast alone
But if it were a man of his or two
The which he had out fast to goo
By cause he would sleep as he seyde
And hastily upon his bed him leyde
And as in winter leaves ben y raft
Each after other till the tree be bare
Seo that there nys but branch and bark y laft
Right to Troylus byraft of each welfare
I bound within with bondys of care
Dysposed wood out of his wit to breyde
So sore him sat the chaungyng of Creseyde
He ryst him up / and every door he shet
And wyndo we eke / and tho this sorrowful man
Upon his beds side down him set
Full like a deed image pale and wan
And in his breast the hepyd woe bygan
Out breast and he wrought in this wise
In his wodenesse as I shall you deuyse
Right as the wyld bole begins (...)
Now here now there dartyd to the heart

To (...) a wight lo that is to him dear
To p^^ue in that thy gyreful vyolence
Thus (...) I lost there helps no defense
O very god / O love / O god alas
That know best mine heart and al my thought
What shall my sorrowful life do in this caas
If I forgo that I so dear have bought
Sith ye Creseyde and me fully have brought
In to your grace and both our hertes sealed
How may ye suffer in less it be repellyd
What shall I do while I may dure
Ay live in turment / and in cruel pain
Thus infortune or this dys^uenture
(...) as I was borne I will complain
Ne never will I seen shine or reyne
But ever will I as Edyppe is derknesse
Led my sorrowful life and live in dystresse
O (...) ghost that erryst to and fro
Why nylt thou flee out of the wofullest
Body that ever might on ground go
O (...) ^^^kyng in this woeful nest
(...) of mine heart or it breast
And follow alwey and Creseyde thy lady dear
Thy right place is now no longer here
This pandarus full deed and pale of hew
F^l pytously ansuerd and said this
As wysly were it falls as it is true
That I have herd and wot how it is
O mercy god who would have trowed this
Who would houe wend that in so little a throw
Fortune our joy would have overthrow
For in this world there nys no creature
As to my dome that ever saw ruin
Strenger than this thorugh caas or adventure
But who may al eschew or al deuyne
Such is this / for thy I thus dyffyne
That trust no wight to find in fortune
Ay propyrte / her yeftes ben comune
But tell me this why art thou now so mad
To sorrow thus why lie thou now in this wise
Sith thy desire al holy thou have had
So that by right it ought ynow suffyse
But I that never felt in my seruyse
Or frendely chere or lokyng of an eye
Late me thus weep and wayle till I dye
And over all this as thou wost well thy self
This town is full of ladies al about
And do my dome fayrer than such twelf
As ever she was shall I find in some route
Ye one or two without any doubt
For thy be glad mine own brother
If she be lost we shall find another
What god forbede alwey that such plesaunce
In one thing were and in none other wight
If one can sing / another can well dance
If this be goodly / she that is glad and light
And this is fair and that can good aryght
Each for his virtue holden is full dear
Both heroune and Faucon for the Ryuere
And eke as write Zanzys that was full wise
The new out chasyth often the old
And upon new caas lies new advise
Thynk eke thy life to save thou art hold
Such fire by process shall be key cold
For sith it nys but casuel plesaunce
Sum caas shall put out of remembrance
For why sure is / as day comes after night
Ye new love labor or other woo
Or else seeing of another wight
Done al affectyons sone ouergo
And for thy part / thou shall have one of tho
To abredge with thy bitter peynes smert
Absence of her shall drive it out of heart
These words said he for the nones all
To help his friend lest he for sorrow deyde
For douteles to do his woe to fall
He rought not what vnthryft he seyde
But Troylus that ny for sorrow deyde
Took little head of all that ever he meant
One ere it herd / and at that other it out went
But at the last he ansuerd and said friend
This leche craft / or heled thus to be
Were well syttyng if that I were a f^end
To tray a wight that true is un to me
I pray god let this counseyl never y the
But do me rather now steruen here
Or I thus do as thou would me lere
She that I serve ywys so what thou sey
To whom mine heart enhabyt is by right
Shall have me holy hers till that I deye
For Pandare sith I her truth behight
I will not be untrue for no wight
But as her man I will ay live and sterue
And never other creature serve
And there thou say thou shall as fair find
As she late be make no comparyson
To creature y fourmed like her by kind
O lyef pandare in conclusyon
I will not be of thyn oppynyoun
Touching al this / for why / I the byseche
Holt thy pees thou sleest me with thy speech
Thou byddest me I should love another
Al fresshely new and late Creseyde goo
It lies not in my power lyef brother
And if I might yet wol I not do so
But thou can pleye Raket to and fro
Ne^le in dok out now this now that pandare
Now foul fall her / for thy woe that care
Thou farest eke by me thou pandarus
As he that when a wight is woe bygone
He comyth to him a pas / and said right thus
Think not on smert and thou shall feel none
Then must I first transmue unto a stone
And reave me my passyone all
Or thou so lyghtely do my woe to fall
My death may well out of my breast depart
Thy life so long may this sorrow mine
But fro my soul shall Creseydes darte
Out neuermore but down with Proserpyne
When I am deed I wol goo wone in pyne
And there I will eternally complain
My woo / and than twynned be we tweyne
Thou have here made an argument forfyne
How that it should a less pain be
Creseyde to for go / for she was mine
And live in case and in felycyte
Why gabbest thou that saydest thus to me
That him is wors that is from well I throw
Than he that never had of well y know
But tell me now / sith ye thynk so light
To chaungen so in love to and fro
Why ne had thou do lesyly thy might
To change her that does the al thy woe
Why nyl thou let her from thyn heart goo
Why nyl thou love another lady sweet
That might set thyn heart in quyete
If thou have had in love ay yet myschauuce
And can it not out of thyn heart drive
I that lived in lust and in plesaunce
With her as much as creature on live
How should I that forgete / and that so blyue
Loo where have thou be hyd so long in mewe
That can so well love / not a griewe
Nay nay god wot nout worth is al thy read
For which / for what that ever may byfalle
Without wordys moo I will be deed
O death that ender art of sorrows all
Come now sith I so often after the call
For happy is that death soothly to seyne
That often I cleped comes and ends pain
Well wot I while my life was in quyete
Or thou me slow / I would have yeuen huyre
But now thy coming is to me so sweet
That in this world I no thing so desire
O death sith with this world I am a fuyre
Thou other do me anon in teres drenche
Or with thy cold stroke mine heart qu^nche
Sith that thou sleest so many in sundry wise
Against their will vnprayed day and night
Do^ now at my request this seruyse
Deliver now the world so do thou right
Of me that am the sorowfullest wight
That ever was for time that I sterue
Sith in this world of right nout may I serve
Thus Troylus in terys began dystylle
As lycoure out of a lembyk full fast
And Pandarus began hold his tongue stylle
And to the ground his eyes down he cast
But netheless thus thought he at the last
What parde rather than my felawe dey
Yet shall I somewhat more unto him sey
And said friend sith thou have such dystresse
And sith the list mine arguments to blame
Why nylt thy self help to redress
And with thy manhood letten al this game
To rauysshe her ne can thou not for shame
And owther let her out of Town fare
Or hold her stylle / and leave thy nyce fare
Art thou in Troy and have none hardyment
To take a woman which that loves the
And would her self be of thine assent
Now is not this a nyce vanyte
Rise up anon and let thy weeping be
And sith thou art a man / for in this hour
I will be deed or she shall be stylle our
To this ansuerd him Troylus full soft
And said parde lyeue brother dear
Al this have I my self thought full often
And more thing than thou deuysest here
But why it is laft thou shall well here
And when thou have me give audyence
Thereafter may thou tell thy sentence
First you wost since this town has all this werre
For rauysshyng of a woman by night
It should not be suffered me to err
And it stant now / ne do not so great unright
I should also have blame of every wight
My faders grant if I so wythstood
Sith she is changed for the tounes good
I have eke thought / sith it were her assent
To ask her of my fader / at his grace
Than thynk I thus it were her accusement
Sith well I wot I may her not purchase
For sith my fader in so hye a place
As parliament has her eschaunge ens^aled
He nyl for me his lettres be repeled
Yet dread I most her heart to perturbe
With vyolence if I do such a game
For if I would it openly dysturbe
It must be dysclaunder unto her name
And me were lever dye than her defame
As nold god but if I should have
Her honor as lyef as my life to save
Thus am I lost for ought that I can see
For certain is / sith I am her knight
I must her honor lever save than me
In every caas as lover ought of right
Thus am I with desire I reason twyght
Desire her to dystourbe / ay me redyth
And reason nyl not / so my heart dredyth
This weeping quod he couthe never seace
He said alas how shall I wretch fare
For well feel I alwey my love encreace
And hope is less and less / always Pandare
Encrecen eke the causes of my care
So well awey why nel mine heart breast
For as in love is there but little rest
Pandare ansuerd / Friend thou may for me
Do as the list / but had I it so hot
And thine estate / she should go with me
Though all this town cried on this thing by note
I nolde not set at all the noise a grote
For when me^ have well cried tha^ will they roune
Eke wonder lasts / but nine days in town
Dyuyne not in reason / ay so deep
Ne curyously / but help thy self anon
Bet is that other / than thy self weep
And namely sith ye two ben al one
Rise up for by my head / she shall not gone
And rather be in blame a little stounde
Than sterue here / as gnat without wound
It is no shame unto you ne vice
Her to withold that you louyth most
Parauenture she might hold you for nyce
To let her go (...) to the greeks host
Thynk eke fo(...) as well thy seluen wost
Helpyth an (...) to his empryse
And fleyth fro (...) for their cowardyse
And though thy lady (...) a little her grieve
Thou shall thy self thy pres (...) make
But as for me certain I can not leave
That she will now as yet for evil take
Why should than for fere thyn heart quake
Thynk how yt parye which yt is thy brother
A love has won why not thou another
And Troylus one thing I dare the s(...)re
That if Creseyde which that is thy lyef
Now louyth the as well / as thou do here
God help me so / she nyl not take a gryef
Though thou do bote / anon in thy^ meschyef
And if she will alweye from the pass
Than is she falls / so love her well the less
For thy take heart / and thynk right as a knight
Through love is broke / al day every law
Kyth now somewhat thy courage / and thy might
Have mercy on thy self for any awe
Let not wretchyd woo / thy heart gnawe
Be manly set the world at six and seuene
And if thou dye a martyr goo to heuene
I will my self be with the all this deed
Though I and al my kynne upon a stounde
Should in the street as dogs lyggen deed
Through gyrt with many a wide and blody wo^de
In every caas I will a friend be found
And if the list here sterue as a wretch
Adyeu the devil speed him that retche
This Troylus began with tho wordys quyken
And seyde friend / gramercy I assent
But certeynly thou may not so me pryken
Ne pain none / may not me so turment
That for no caas / it is not mine intent
At short words / though I dye shold^
To rauysshe her / but if her self would
Right so mean I quod Pandarus all this day
But tell me than / have thou her well assayed
That sorowest thus / and he ansuerd nay
Whereof art thou quod Pandarus so dismaide
That noste not / if she will be well apayde
To rauysshe her sith thou have not be there
But if that Jove told it in thyn ere
For thy rise up / as though ne were anon
And wasshe thy face / and to the king thou we^de
Or he may wonder / whyder thou art gone
Thou must with wysedom him and other blend
Or upon caas he may after the send
Or thou be ware and shortly brorer dear
Be glad / and let me w^^ke in this matere
For I shall shape it so that sykerly
Thou shall this night sometime in some manner
Come speak with thy lady pryuely
And by her words and eke by her chere
Thou shall well sone perceive and here
Al her intent / and of this cas the best
And fare now well for in this point I rest
The swyft fame which that falls things
Egally reports like things true
Was through out Troys fled with pressed wings
From man to men and made this tale al new
How Calcas daughter with her bright hew
At parliament without words more
Y granted was in change of Anthenore
The which tale anon as Creseyde
Had herd as she that of her fader rought
As in this cas right naught / ne when he deide
Full besyly to Iupyter bysought
Give him myschaunce that this treatice wrout
But shortly (...) this tale soth were
She durst of no wight asken for fere
As she that her heart and al her mind
On Troylus y set was so wonder fast
That all this world ne myt her love unbind
Ne Troylus out of her heart cast
She will be his while her life may last
And thus she brennyth both in love and dread
So that she nyste what was to read
But as men see in Town al about
That wymmen use friends to vyfyte
So to Creseyde of wymen come a rowte
For pytous joy / and wend her delight
And with their tales dear ynow amyte
These wymmen which that in the cite dwell
They set hem down and seyde as I shall tell
Quod first that one I am glad trewely
By cause of you ye shall yowre fader see
Another said ywys so am not I
For all to little has she with us be
Quod tho the third / I hope ywys that she
Shall bring us pees on every side
That when she goth / almyty god her guide
The wordys and the womannysshe things
She herd right as she thens were
For god wot her heart on other thing is
Al though the body sat among hem there
Her audyence is alwey else where
For Troylus full fast her soul sought
Withouten word alwey on him she thought
These wymmen that th^s wenden her to please
About naught began al these tales spend
Such vanyte ne can her do none ease
As she that all this mean while brende
Of other passyoun than they wend
So that she felt al most her heart dye
For woo and weary of that company
For which no longer might she restreyne
The terys so they began up to well
That youen signs of the bitter pain
In which her spyryte was and must duelle
Remembryng her from heuene in to hell
She fallen was sith she forgoth the sight
Of Troylus / and sorowfully she sight
And thylk foolys that saten here about
Wend that she so wept and syghed sore
By cause that she should out of that route
Depart and pleye never with hem more
And they that had known her of yore
Saw her so weep / and thought it kyndenesse
And each of hem wept for her dystresse
And besyly they began her comfort
Of thing god wot on which she little thout
And with her tales wenden her dyspot
And to be glad they often her besought
But such an ease they her therewith wrought
Right as a man is esed for to feel
For ache of head to clawe him on the hele
But after al this nyce vanyte
They token her leave / and home they wenten all
Creseyde full of sorrowful pity
In to the chamber up out of the halle
And on her bygan for deed began to fall
In purpoos thens never for to rise
And thus she wrought as I shall you ^^^yse
Her yelowe here that sonnysshe was of bew
She rent / and eke her fyngers long and small
She wrong full often / and bad god on her rewe
And with her death to do bote on her bale
Her hew whylome so bright / tho was pale
Bare witness of her woe / and her cons^^^ynt
And thus she spak sobbyng in her compleynt
Alas quod she out of this Regyoun
I woeful wretch and Infortuned wight
And borne in cursyd constellacyoun
Mot^ goo / and thus depart fro my knight
Woe worth alas that ylke days light
On which I saw first with eyes tweyne
That causyth me and him all this pain
Therwyth the terys from her eyes two
Down fyl as shower in apryl does swythe
Her white breast she beat / and for the woe
After the death she cried a thousand sithe
Sith he that wont her woe was to lythe
She mote forgoo / for such dysauenture
She held her self a forbost creature
She said how shall he do and I also
How shall I live if I from him twynne
O dear heart eke that I love so
Who shall that sorrow slay that ye ben ynne
O Calcas fader thyn be al this sin
O mother mine that cleped art Argyue
Woo worth that day thou bare my elyue
To what fine should I live / and sorrow thus
How should a fysshe without water dure
What is Creseyde worth from Troylus
How should a plant or lives creature
Live without his kyndely noreture
For which full often a byword here I seye
That roteles mote grene sone deye
I shall do thus sith none other swerd ne dart
Dare I none handle for the cruelte
That ylk day I mote from you depart
If sorrow of that will not my bane be
Than shall no mete ne drink come in me
Till my soul out of my breast vnshethe
And thus my self wol I do to death
And Troylus my clothes euerychone
Shall blak be in tokenyng heart sweet
That I am as out of this world agone
I wont was you to set in quyete
And of mine order ay till death me mete
The obseruaunce ever in your absence
Shall sorrow be compleynt and abstynence
Mine heart and eke the woeful ghost theryn
Byqueth I with your spyryte to complain
Eternally for they shall never twyn
For though in earth I twynned be we tweyne
Yet in the fold of pity out of pain
That hight Elyzos / shall we ben in fere
As Orpheus is with Erudyce his fere
Thus heart mine / for Anthenore alas
I soon shall be changed as I wene
But how shall ye do now in this cas
How shall your sorrowful heart it sustene
But heart mine foryete this sorrow and tene
And me also / for sothly for to sey
So ye fare well / I recke not to dey
How ever might y read be or song
The pleynt that she made in her dystresse
I not but as for me my little tongue
If I descryue would her heaviness
It should make her sorrow seem less
Than that was and chyldely deface
Her hye compleynt / and therefore I let it pace
Pandare which that sent was for Troylus
Unto Creseyde as ye have herd deuyse
That for the best it was acorded thus
And he full glad to do him that seruyse
Unto Creseyde in a full secre wise
There as she lay in turment and in rage
Come her to tell al holy his message
And fond that she her self began to trete
Full pytously / for with her salt teres
Her breast / her face y bathed was full wete
The mighty tressys of her sonnysshe herys
Vnbroyded hyng al about her eres
Which yafe him very sign of matyere
Of death which that her heart began desire
When she him saw she began for sorrow anon
Her woeful face bytweye her arms hyde
For which this pandarus is so woe bygone
That in the hows he might uneath abide
As he that pity felt on every side
For if Troylus had erst compleyned sore
Than began she pleyne a thousand times more
And in her asper playnt thus she said
Pandare first of joys mo than two
Was cause causyng unto me Creseyde
That now transmuted ben in cruel woe
Whether shall I say welcome to you or no
That altherfyrst me brought in to seruyse
Of love alas that ends in such wise
Endyth than love in woe / ye or men lies
And al worldly bliss / as thinks me
Thend of bliss / ay sorrow it occupyeth
And who so troweth that it not so be
Let him upon my woeful wretch see
That my self hate / and my birth curs
Felyng alwey fro wyk I goo to wurs
Who so me sees / sees sorrows al at ones
Pryue woo / pain / turment and dystresse
Out of my woeful body harm there ynouh is
As anguysshe / langour / cruel bytternesse
Annoy smert / dread fury and eke sykenesse
I trow ywys from heuene teres reyne
For pity of mine asper cruel pain
And thou my suster / full of dyscomfort
Quod pandarus what thynkest thou to do
Why ne have thou to thy self some resport
Why wylt thou thus / alas thy self for do
Leave all this / and take now head to
That I shall say and herkene in good intent
This which by me thy Troylus the sent
Turnyd tho Creseyde a woo making
So great that death it was to see
Alas she said / what words may ye bring
What will my dear heart sey to me
Which that I dread neuermore to see
Will he have pleynt or terys or I wend
I have ynowh if he thereafter send
She was right such to see in her visage
As is that wight that men on bear bind
Her face lyche of paradise the image
Was al y changed in to another kind
The pleye the laughter men were wont to find
On her / and eke her joys euerychone
Ben fled / and thus lies Creseyde alone
About her eyes two / a propyr ryng
Bytrent in sothfast token of her pain
That to byhold it was a dedely thing
For which pandare might not restreyne
The terys from his eyes for to reyne
But netheles as he best might he seyde
From Troylus these words unto Creseyde
Loo nece I trow ye have herd al how
The king with other lords for the best
Has made a change for Anthenor and you
That cause is of this sorrow and unrest
But how this cas does / Troylus moleste
That may none erthely man's tongue seye
As he that shortly shapyth him to deye
For which we have so sorowed both he and I
That in to little / both it has us slawe
But through my counseyl this day finally
He somewhat is fro weeping now withdraw
And semyth me that he desires fawe
With you to be al night for to deuyse
Remedy of this if there be any wise
This is short and pleyn theffect of my message
As ferforth as my wit can comprehend
For that ye be of turment in such a rage
Ye may to no long prolog as now entende
And herupon ye must ansuer him send
And for the love of god my nece dear
So leave this woo or Troylus come here
Great is my woo quod she / and syghed sore
As she that felyth dethes sharp distress
But yet to me his sorrow is much more
That love him let than he him self I guess
Alas for me has he such heaviness
Can he for me so pitously complain
Ywys his sorrow doublyth al my pain
Grievous for me god wot / is for to twynne
Quod she / but god wot harder is to me
To see that sorrow which that he is Inn
For well I wot it wol my bane be
And dye I will in certain quod she
But bid him com / or death that thus me threteth
Drive out yt ghost / which in mine heart beteth
These words said she on her arms two
Fulgruf / and began to weep pytously
Quod pandarus alas why do ye so
Sith well ye wot / the time is fast by
That he shall come arise up hastily
That he bywopen thus you now find
But ye wol have him wode out of his mind
For wist he ye ferd in this manner
He would him self slay / if I wend
To have this fare / he should not come here
For all the good that Priamus may dyspende
For to what fine he would anon pretend
That know I well / and therefore yet I sey
So let this sorrow / or platly he will dey
And shapyth you his sorrow to abredge
And not to encrece lyef nece sweet
Be rather to him of flat than edge
And with some wysedom ye his sorrow beat
What helps it to weep full a sterte
Or though ye both in salt terye dreynt
Bet is a time of cure than of compleynt
I mean as when I hyder him bring
Sith ye ben wise and of one assent
So shapyth how to dystourbe your going
Or come ageyn sone / after ye be went
Wymmen ben wise in short auysement
And late see now your wit how shall avail
And that I may help shall not fail
Go quod Creseyde and uncle trewely
I shall do al my might me to restreyne
From weeping in his sight / and besyly
Him for to glade I shall do my pain
And in my heart seek every vein
If to his sore there may be found salve
It shall not lak certain in my behalue
Goth Pandarus / and Troylus he sought
Till in a Temple he fond him al alone
As he that of his life no more rought
But to the pytous gods enerychone
Full tenderly he prayed and made his moan
To do him soon / out of this world pace
For well he thought there was none other grace
And shortly all the sothe to sey
He was so fall in despeyr that day
That utterly he shope for to dey
For right thus was his argument always
He said I am but lorn so well away
For all that comes / comes by necessyte
Thus to be lorn it is my destyne
For certeynly this wot I well he seyde
That forsyght of dyuyne purueaunce
Has seen me alwey to forgoo Creseyde
Sith god sees every thing out of doutau^ce
And hem dysposyth after his ordinance
In her merytes sothly for to be
As they shall come by predestyne
But netheles alas whom shall I leave
For there ben clerks many one
That descryue through arguments preue
And some seyn that nedely there is none
But that fre choice is you to euerychone
O well awey so sly are clerks old
That I note whoos oppynyon I may hold
For some seyn that god sees al byforn
And god may not be desceyued parde
Than mote it fall / though men had it sworn
That purueaunce has seen aforn to be
Wherefore I say that from eterne if he
Has wist before or thought eke al our deeds
We have no free choys as these clerkys redys
For another thought ne other de de also
Might never be / but such as pur^eaunce
Which may not be deceived neuermo
Has felt before without ignorance
For if there might be a varyounce
To worchen out from gods purueyeng
There were no prescyence of thing coming
But it were rather an oppynyon
Vnstydfast / and not certain seeing
And certes that were an abusyon
That god should have no parfyte clear wytyng
More than we men that have douteous wenyng
But such an error upon god to guess
Were falls and foul and curfyd wykkednesse
And this is eke an oppynyon of some
That have their top full hye / and smoth y shore
They say right thus that thing is not to come
For that prescyence has seyn it before
That it shall come / but they that therefore
That it shall come / therefore the purueaunce
Wot^ it before without ignorance
And in this manner this necessyte
Receives in his part contrary ageyn
For nedefully behooves it not be
That thylk things fall in certain
That been purueyed / but nedely as they seyn
Behooves it that things which that fall
That they in certain ben purueyed all
I mean as though I labored me in this
To inquire which thing / of which thing cause be
As whether that the prescyence of god is
The certain cause of the necessyte
Of things that to come be parde
Or if necessyte of thing coming
Be cause certain of the purueyeng
But now enforce I me not in showing
How the order of causes stant / but well wot I
That it byhouyth that the byfallyng
Of things wist before certeynly
Ben necessary / al seem it not there by
That preseyence put falling necessayre
Of thing to come / fall they foul or fair
For if there sit a man yond on a see
Than by necessyte behooves it
That certes thyn oppynyon sooth be
That wenyst and coniectyst that he sit
And ferthermore ayeneward yet
Loo right so it is of the part contrary
As thus so harken / for I will not ta^^
I sey if the oppynyon of the
Be soth for that he sit / than say I thus
That he mote sit by necessyte
And thus necessyte in either is
For in him need of syttyng is
And in the need of soth / and thus forsothe
There mo^e necessyte be in you both
But thou may seye the man sit not therefore
That thyn oppynyon of his sytting sooth is
But rather for the man sit there before
Therefore is thyn oppynyon soth ywys
And I sey though the cause of soth of this
Comyth of his syttyng yet necessyte
Is entrechaungyd both in him and the
Thus in the same wise out of doutaunce
I may well make / as it seems me
My resonynge of gods purueaunce
As of tho things / that to comen be
By which reason men may well see
That thylk things that in earth fall
That by necessyte they comen all
For though that thyngis shall come ywys
Therefore they ben purueyed certeynly
Not that it comes for it purueyed is
Yet netheles behooves it nedefully
That thing to come / be purueyed trewely
Or else things that purueyed be
That they betyde by necessyte
And this suffyseth right enough certain
For to destroy our free choice every dele
But now is this abusyon to seyn
That falling of the things temporele
Is cause of gods prescyence eternele
Now trewely that is a falls sentence
That thing to come shall cause his prescyence
What might I wene / and I had such a thought
But that god purueyeth thing that is to come
For that it is to come / and else naught
So might I wene that things al and some
That whylome ben byfalle and overcome
By cause of thylk sovereign purueaunce
That forwote al without ignorance
And over all this yet sey I more thereto
That right as when I wot there is a thing
Iwys that thing mote nedefully be so
Eke right so when I wot a thing coming
So mote it come / and thus by byfallyng
Of things that been wist before the tide
They may not ben eschewyd on no side
Than said he thus almighty Jove in Throne
That wost of all this thing the sothfastnes
Rewe on my sorrow / and do me deye sone
Or bring Creseyde and me from dystresse
And while he was in all this heaviness
Dysputyng with him self in this matere
Come Pandare and said as ye shall here
O mighty god quod Pandarus in throne
Ey who saw ever a wise man fare so
Why Troilus what thynkest thou to done
Have thou such lust to be thine own foo
What parde / yet nys not Creseyde goo
Why list the so thy self for to dread
That in thine head thyn eyes semen deed
Have thou not lived many year byforn
Without her / and ferd full well at ease
Art thou for her / and for none other born
Has kind wrought the only for to please
Here let see / and thynk on thy disease
That on the dyse right as there fallen chau^ces
Right so in love there come and goo plesaunces
And yet this is my wonder most of al
Why you thus sorowest / sith yt thou wost not yet
Towchyng her going how it shall fall
Ne if she can her seluen dystourben it
Thou have not yet assayed al her wit
A man may al by time his neck bid
When it shall of / and sorowen at need
For thy take heed of that I shall the sey
I have with her y spoke / and long y be
So as acordyd was betwyxt us twey
And evermore me thinks thus that she
Has somewhat in her hertes pryuete
Wherwyth she can if I shall right read
Dystourbe all this / of which thou art in dread
For which my counseyl is when it is night
Thou to her goo / and make of this an end
And blysful Juno through his great might
Shall as I hope her grace to the send
Mine heart seyth certain / she shall not wend
And for thy put thine heart a while in rest
And hold this purpoos / for it is the best
This Troylus ansuerd and syghed sore
Thou seyst right well / and I will do right so
And what him list / he said unto him more
And when that it was time for to goo
Full pryuely him self withouten moo
Unto her come / as he was wont to done
And how they wrout I shall you tell soon
Soth is when they began first mete
So again the pain / their hertes for to twyste
That neither of hem other might great
But hem in arms took and after kyst
The less woeful of both hem nyst
What for to done / ne myt one word out bring
As I said erst / for woe / and for sobbyng
The woeful teres that they let fall
As bitter were out of teres kind
For pain as is lignum aloes or galle
So bitter terys wept not as I find
The woeful Myrra through bark and rynd
That in this world there nys so hard an heart
That ne would have rewid on their peynes smert
But when their woeful weary ghostys tweyne
Returned ben there / as they ought to dwell
And that somewhat to weyken began their pain
By length of pleynt / and ebben began the well
Of their hertes / and the heart vnswelle
With broken voys al hoors for woe creseyde
To Troylus these ylke words seyde
O Jove I dye / and mercy I byseche
Help Troylus / and there with all her face
Upon his breast she laid / and bost speech
Her woeful spyryte from his prop^e place
Right with the word / awey in point to pace
And thus she lies with hew pale and grene
That whylome fresshe and fairest was to seen
This Troylus that on her began byhold
Clepyng her name / as she lay for deed
Without ansuer / and felt her lymes cold
Her eyes thrown upward in her head
This sorrowful man can none other read
But of ^e her cold mouth he ^yst
Where he was woo / god and him self it wist
He rise him up / ^ long s^reyght her leyde
For sign of life for ought he can or may
Couthe he none find / for nothing on Creseyde
For which his song full often was well away
But when he saw that specheles she lay
With sorrowful voys and heart of bliss al (...)
He said how she was fro this world y fa^e
So after that he had her long compleyned
His hands he wrong / and said that was to seye
And with his ^^res her breast bereyned
He began the terys wypen of full dreye
And pytously began for the soul preye
And said O lord / that set art in thy Throne
Rewe on me / for I shall follow her soon
She cold was without sentement
For ought he wot breath ne felt be none
And this was to him preygnaunt argument
That she was forth out of this world y gone
And when he saw there was none other wone
He began her lymes dress in such manner
As men done them that shollen be leyde on bear
And after this with stern and cruel heart
His swerd out of his sheeth he twyght
Him self to slay / how sore that him smert
So that his soul / her soul follow might
There as the dome of Mynos would it dyght
Sith love and cruel fortune it ne would
That in this world he longer live should
Than said he thus fulfilled of hye desdayne
O cruel Jove and thou fortune adverse
This al and some that ye falsely han slain
Creseyde / and sith ye may do no wers
Fie on your might and works so diverse
Thus cowardly shall ye me never win
There shall no death / me from my lady twynne
For I this world / sith ye have her slain thus
Wol let and follow her spyryte low or hye
Shall never Lover say that Troylus
Dare not for fere with his lady dye
For certain I will bear her company
But sith ye will not suffer us live here
Yet suffer that our sowles ben y fere
And thou cyt^e which that I live in woo
And thou priamus / and brethren al in fere
And thou mother fare well / for I goo
And Antropos make ready thou my bear
And thou Creseyde / O sweet heart dear
Receive now my spyryte would he sey
With swerd at heart full ready for to dey
But as god would of swough she abreyde
And began to sygh / and to Troylus she cryde
And he ansuerd / lady mine Creseyde
Live ye yet / and let his swerd down glyde
Ye heart mine that thanked be Cupyde
Quod she / and there with all she sore sight
And he bygan to glade her as he might
Took her in arms two / and kyst her often
And her to glade he did al his intent
In which her ghost that flykeryd ay aloft
In to her woeful heart again it went
But at the last right as her eyes glent
A side anon she began the swerd aspye
As it lay bare / and began for to cry
And asked him why he it out had draw
And Troylus the cause anon her told
And hou him self therewith he would have slaw
For which Creseyde upon him began behold
And began him in her arms fast hold
O mercy god / she said / ^o such a deed
Alas how nyhe we were both deed
Than if I ne had spoke as grace was
Ye would hane slain anon your self quod she
Ye douteles / and she ansuerd alas
For by that ylke lord that made me
I nold a furlong wey alive have be
After your death to have be crowned queen
Of all the land the son on shyneth shene
But with the self swerd which that here is
My self would have slain quod she tho
But hoo for we have right ynowe of this
And let us rise / and straight to bed goo
And there let us speak of our woo
For by the mortar which I see here brenne
Know I full well that day is not fer hen
When they were a bed in arms fold
Naught was it like the nyghtes there beforne
For pytously each other began byhold
As they that had al bliss y borne
Bywailyng ay the day that they were borne
Till at the last this woeful wight Creseyde
To Troylus these ylke words seyde
Lo heart mine well wot ye this quod she
That if a wight alweye his woe complain
And seeks not how helped for to be
It nys but folly and increase of pain
And sith that here assembled be we tweyne
To find boot of woe that we ben Inn
It were al time soon to begin
I am but a woman as full well ye wot
And as I am aduysed suddenly
So will I tell it you while it is hot
Me thinks thus that neither ye nor I
Ought half this woo to make skylfully
For there is art enough for to redress
That yet is mys and slay this heaviness
So this the woe that we ben Inn
For ought I wot / for no thing else is
But for by cause that we shall twynne
Considered al there is no more ywys
But what is than a remedy unto this
But that we shape us sone for to mete
This is al and some / my dear heart sweet
Now that shall I well bryngen about
To come sone again after I am go
Not withstandyng the greeks great route
Doutyth not / it must needs be so
By very resons more than one or two
By all right / and in wordys few
I shall you well an hepe of weyes show
For which I will not make long sermon
For time y lost may not recovered be
But I will go to my conclusyon
And to the best in that that I can see
But for the love of god foryeue it me
If I speak ought against your hertes rest
For trewely I speak it for the best
Making alwey a protestacyon
That now t^ese words which that I shall sey
Nys but to show you my mocyoun
To find unto your help the ^est wey
And takyth it none otherwise I you prey
For in effect / what so ye me comaunde
That will I do / for that is no demand
Now herkenyth well that ye have understand
My going granted is by parliament
So ferforth that it may not be wythstond
For all this world as by Judgment
And sith there helps none aduysement
To letten it / let it passen out of mind
And let us shape a better wey to find
Soth is this the twynnyng of us tweyne
Will us dysese and gretely annoye
But him behouyth sometime have pain
That seruyth love / if that he will have joy
And sith I shall no further out of Troy
Than I may ride again in half a morrow
It ought the less causen us to sorrow
Sith as I shall not ben hyd in mewe
That day by day mine own heart dear
Sith well ye wot it is now a true
Ye shall full well al mine estate here
And or that trewes is done I shall be here
And than have ye both Anthenore won
And me also / be glad if that ye conne
And thynk right thus Creseyde is now agone
But when she shall come hastily again
And when alas / by god right here anon
Or days ten / this dare I saufly seyne
And than at e^st shall we be so feyn
So as we shall to gyder ever duelle
That all the world ne might our bliss tell
I see that often / there as we be now
Is for the best our counseyl for to hyde
Ye speak not with me nor I with you
In fourtenyght ne see you go ne ride
May ye not ten days than abide
For mine honor in such an adventure
Iwys ye mow else little endure
Ye know well eke how al my kyn is here
But if that only it my fader be
And eke mine other things al in fere
And namely my dear heart ye
Whom that I nolde leave for to see
For all this world as wide as it has space
Or else see I never Jove in the face
Why trow ye my fader in this wise
Coueyteth so to see me / but for dread
Lest in this town the folk me despise
By cause of him for his unhappy deed
What wot my fader what life I led
For and he wist in Troy how well that I fare
Us nedyth for my wendyng no thing to care
Ye see eke that every day more and more
Men trete of pees / and it supposed is
That men the queen Heleyne shollen restore
And greeks us restore that is amys
So and there nere comfort / none but this
That men purpose pees on every side
Ye may the better at ease of heart abide
For if that it be pees / ^oo mine heart dear
The nature of the pees must needs drive
That men must entrecomune in fere
And to and fro eke goo and ride as blyue
Al day as thyck / as ben from the hyue
And every wight have lyberte to bleue
Where as him list the bet without leave
And though so be that pees may be none
Yet hyder though never ne peace were
I must come / for whyder should I gone
Or how myschaunce should I dwell there
Among tho men of arms in fere
For which as wysly god my soul read
I can not seen whereof ye should dread
Have here another wey if it so be
That all this thing ne may not you suffyse
My fader as ye known well parde
Is old / and eld is full of couetyse
And I right now have found all the gyse
Without net / wherewith I shall him hent
And herkeneth how if ye will assent
Loo Troylus men seyn that hard it is
The wether from the wolf hole to save
This is to say / that men full often ywys
Mote spend part the remenaunt to save
For ay with gold / men may the heart grave
Of him that set is upon couetyse
And how I mean I shall you now deuyse
The meoble which I have in this town
Unto my fader / shall I take and sey
That right for trust and sauacyon
It sent is from a friend of his or twey
The which friends feruentely him prey
To send after more / and that in hye
While that this Town stant thus in Ieopardye
And that shall be an huge quantite
This shall I sey but less than folk espyede
This may be sent by no wight but by me
I shall it show if peace be tide
What frendys that I have on either side
Toward the court to do the wrath pace
Of Pryamus and done him stond in grace
So that for one thing / or for other my (...)
I shall him so enchaun^en with my sawes
That right in heuene his soul shall he mete
For all Appollo and his clerks laws
Or calculyng avails not three hawes
Desire of gold shall so his heart blend
That as me list I shall well make an end
And if he would ought by his sort preue
If that I lie in certain I shall find
Dystourben him and plucken him by the sleue
Marryng his sort and beryng him on hand
He has not well the gods understand
For gods speken in Amphybylogyes
And for one sooth they make twenty lies
Eke dread fond first gods I suppose
Thus shall I sey / and that his coward heart
Made him amys the gods text to gloss
When he for fere out of Delphos began s^ert
And but I makehym sone to convert
And do my read within a day or twey
I will to you oblyge me to dey^
And trewely y written as I find
That all this thing was said of good intent
And that her heart true was and kind
Coward him and spak right as she meant
And that she starf for woo ny when she went
And was in purpoos ever to ben true
Thus written they that of her hertes knew
This Troylus with heart and eres sprad
Herd all this thing devised to and fro
And verily him seemed that he had
The self wit / but yet to let her goo
His heart mysforyaue him euermo
But finally he began his heart wrest
To trust her and took it for the best
For which the great fury of his penance
Was queynt with hope / and therewith hem bitwene
Bygan for joy the amorous dance
And as the birds when the son is shene
Delyten in her song in the leaves grene
Right so the words that they spak in fere
Dely^^d hem and made their hertes clear
But netheles the wendyng of Cres^id^
For all this world may not out of his mind
For which full often full pytously he p^yd^
That of her heest he might her true find
And seyde (...) if ye ben unkind
And but ye come all that day set in Troy
Ne shall I never have h^le honor ne joy
For also soth a^ son rys^ a ^^^orow^
And god so wysly thou me woeful w^^tche
To r^s^ me bring out of this cruel sorrow
I will my self if that y^ dretche
But of my does though little be to retche
Yet or that ye causen me so to smert
Dwell here rather mine own dear h^rt
For trewely mine own lady dear
The sleygh^es that I have herd you (...)
Full shaply be to fallen al in fere
For soth is said what thinks the bear
Yet al another thinks his leder^
Your fader is wise / and said is out of deed
Men may the wise at ^enne / but not at read
It is full hard / to halten vnaspyed
Before a Crepul / for he can the craft
Your fader is in sloyghtes / as argus is eyed
For all be that his meoble be him becaft
His old sleygh^rs yet ben with him laft
Ye shall not blind him for your woman^^de
Ne feyne a right / and that is al my dread
I note if pees shall euermo ^etyde
But pees o^ no / for ernest ne for game
I wot sith (...) on the grekys side
Has ones ben and (...) so foul his name
He dare no more come here again for shame
For which that ^ey for ought I can espy^
To trust upon nys but a fantasye
Ye shall eke see your fader shall you gloss
To be a wife / and as he can well preche
He shall some greek so preyse so hye a lose
That rauysshen he shall you with his speech
Or do you do by force / as he shall teache
And Troylus of whom he nyl have routhe
So causeles shall sterue in his truth
And over all this your fader shall despise
^s all and sey this Cytte nys but born
And that the syege never shall arise
For why the greeks hane it al y sworn
Till we ben slain / and down our wallys torn
And thus he shall you with his words fere
That ay dread I / ye shall believe there
Ye shall eke see so many a lusty ^nyght
Among the greeks full of worthynesse
And each of them with heart wit and might
To plese you will do al their ^esynesse
That ye shall dulle of the r^denesse
Of us Cely Tro^aue^ but if that ro^^he
Rem^orde you of virtue and of your truth
And thus to me so grievous is to think
That fro my breast it will my soul rende
Ne dredeles in me there can not synke
A good oppynyon if that ye wend
For why your faders sleygh^es will us she^de
And if ye gone as I have told you yore
So thynk I nam but deed withouten more
For which with humble true and pytous heart
A thousand times mercy I you prey
So rewyth upon mine aspye peynes smert
And does somewhat as I shall you sey
And let us stele awey between us twey
And thynk that folly is when a man may chese
For accydent his substance ay to leese
I mean thus that sith ye mow no day
Well stele awey / and be together so
What were it to put in assay
In caas ye should unto yowr fader go
If that ye might come again or no
Thus thinks me it were a great folly
To put that sykernes in to ieopardye
And wulgarly to speak of substance
Of tresoure may we both with us led
Enough to live in honor and plesaunce
Till in to time that we shall be deed
And thus we may eschew all this dread
For every other wey ye can record
Mine heart ywys may therewith not acorde
And hardely / ne caryth no pouert
For I have kyn and friends else where
That though we come in our bare shert
Us should neither last gold ne gere
But ben honored while we dwellen there
And go we anon / for after mine intent
This is the best if that ye will assent
Creseyde him with a syke right in this wise
Ansuerd ywys / my dear heart true
We may well aweye as ye deuyse
Or find such unthrifty weyes new
But afterward full soon it would us rewe
As help me god at my last need
Al causeles ye suffer all this dread
For thylk day that I for cherysshyng
Or dread of fader or of other wight
Or for estate delight or for weddyng
Be falls to you my Troylus my knight
Saturnus daughter Juno through her might
As wood as Adamaunt / do me dwell
Eternally with styx in the pyt of hell
And this on every god celestyal
I swear it you / and eke on each goddess
On every nymphe / and deyte infernal
On Satyry and Fauny / more and less
That half gods ben of wilderness
And Antropos my threde of life to breast
If I be falls now trow me if ye lest
And thou Synoys that as an arewe clore
Through Troy rennest dounward to the sea
Bear witness of this word that said is here
That ylke day that I untrue be
To Troylus mine own heart fre
That thou return backward to thy well
And I with body and soul synke to hell
But that ye speak awey thus for to goo
And leave al yowre friends / god forbede
For any woman that ye holden so
And namely sith Troy has now such need
Of help / and eke of one thing takes head
If this were wist / my life lay in balaunce
And your honor / god shyeld us from myscha^ce
And if so be that pees herafter take
As al day happyth / after angyr game
What lord the sorrow and woo ye would make
That ye ne durst come again for shame
And er that ye ieopart / so your name
Be not to hasty in this old fare
For hasty man wantyth never care
What trow ye eke / that people here about
Would of it say / it is full light to read
They wol sey / and swear it out of doubt
That love ne drove you to do that deed
But lust voluptuous and coward dread
Thus were al lost / ywys mine heart dear
Your honor which that now shyneth so clear
And also thinks on mine honest
That flowryth yet / how foul should I it shende
And with what fylth it spottyd should be
If in this form with you I should wend
Ne though I lived unto the worldys end
My name should I never ageynward win
Thus were I lost / and that were rowthe and sin
And for to slay with reason all this hete
Men seyn the suff^aunt ouercomyth parde
Also who wol have lyef / lyef more let
Thus makes v^rtu of necessyre
By pacyen^e / and thynk that lord ^o he
By fortune / ay that will not retche
And she ne daunt^th but a wretch
And truseyth this that certrs heart sweet
Or Phoebus suf^er Lucyna the sheene
The lion pass out of this Arye^e
I will be here without any wene
I wene as help me Juno heuenes queen
The ^enthe day / but if that death ma^ayle
I will you seen without any fail
And now so this be true / quod Troylus
I shall well suffer unto the tenthe day
Sith that I see / need it mote be thus
But for the love of god if it be may
So let us stele pryuely away
For ever in one / as for to live in rest
Mine heart seyth / that it would be the best
O mercy god what life is this quod she
Alas ye s^e me thus with very tene
I see well now that ye mystrusten me
For by your words it is well y seen
Now for the love of Sathya the shene
Mystrust me not thus causeles for routhe
Since to be true I have plyght you my troth
And thinks well that sometime it is wit
To spend a time right for to win
Ne parde lorn am I not from you yet
Though we be a day or two a twynne
Drive out the fantasyes you withynne
And trus^yth me / and leuyth eke your sorrow
Or here my truth I will not live to morrow
For if ye wist how sore it does me smert
Ye would cease of this for god thou wost
The pour spyryte weyyth in my heart
To see you weep that I love most
And that I mote goo to the greeks host
Ye nere that I wist a remedy
To come again / right here would I dye
But certes I nam not so nyce a wight
That I ne can well ymagyne a weye
To come again that day that I have hight
For who may hold a thing that wol aweye
My fader naught for all this queynt pleye
And by my thryft my wendyng out of Troy
Another day shall ^orne us al to joy
For thy with all mine heart I you byseke
If that ye list do ought for my prayere
And for that love / which I love you eke
That or I depart from you here
That of so good comfort and chyere
I may you see that I may bring at rest
Mine heart which that is in peynt to breast
And over all this I pray you quod she tho
Mine own hertes / sothfast suffysaunce
Sith I am thine al hole withouten mo
The while that I am absent that no plesaunce
Of other do me from your remembrance
For why I am ever aghast / for why men read
Love is thyn / and ay full of besy dread
For in this world there lives lady none
If that ye were untrue as god defend
That so betrayed were / or woo bygone
And I that al truth in you entende
And dout^les if that I other wend
I nere but deed / and or ye can so find
For gods love so leth not to me unkind
To this answered Troylus and seyde
Now god to whom there is no cause y wry
Me glad as wys I never to Creseyde
Sith thylk day I saw her first with eye
Was falls / ne never shall / till that I dye
At short words well ye may me leave
I can no more / it shall be found at p^^ue
Gromercy good heart mine quod she
And blysful Venus let me never sterue
Or I may stand in plesaunce of ^gree
To quyte him well that so well can deseru^
And while that god my wit will me co^serue
I shall so done so true I have you found
That ay honor to me ward shall rebounde
For truseyth well that your estate royal
No vain delyt^ / nor only worthynesse
Of you in werre / ne tourney marcyal
Nor pomp^ array / nobley or eke Richesse
Ne made me to rewe upon your dystresse
But moral virtue groundyd upon truth
That was the cause I had first on you routhe
Eke gentyl heart / and manhood that ye had
And that ye had as me thinks in despyte
Every thing / that sowned^ in to bad
As rudeuesse and peoplyss^e appetyte
And that your reason brydled your delight
This made me above every creature
That I was your / and shall while I may dure
And this may length of years not for do
Ne remuable fortune deface
But Iupyter / that of his might may do
Ye sorrowful to be glad / so give us grace
Or nyghtes ten to meten in this place
So that it may / mine heart and your suffyse
And fare ye well / time is that ye rise
But after that they love pleyned had
And I liyst / and streyt in arms fold
The day began rise / and Troylus him clad
And rewfully his lady began byhold
As he that felt / dethes tr^es cold
And to her grace / he began him recomaunde
Whether he was woo / thus hold I no demand
For man's head ymagyne ne can
Ne nen tendement consydere / ne tongue tell
The cruel peynes / of this woeful man
That passyn every torment down in hell
For when he saw / she might not dwell
Which that his soul / out of his heart rent
Without more / he out of the chamber went
Here endyth the Fourth book
And begins the Fyfthe
aProchen began ye fatal day of destyne
That Iouis has in his dysposycyon
And to you angry parcas sustre^ three
Committed to do anon execucyon
For which Creseyde must out of the town
And Troylus shall dwell / forth in pyne
Till lachesys his threde no longer twyne
The gold tressyd Phoebus hye on loft
Shyned had with his beams clear
The snowes molt / and Zephyrus as often
Y^ brought again the lusty leaves grene
Sith that the sone of Heccuba the queen
Bygan to love her first / for whom his sorrow
Was al / that she depart should a morrow
Full ready was at pryme Dyomede
Creseyde unto the greeks host to lead
For sorrow / of which she felt her heart blede
As she that nyst / what was best to read
And trewely as men in books read
Men wist never woman have more care
Ne was so loath / out of a town to fare
This Troylus without read or lore
As a man that has his joys eke forlore
Was waytyng on his lady evermore
As she / that the sothfast crop and more
Of al his lust / or joys here before
But Troylus / now fare well al thy ioys
For shall thou never / see her eft in Troys
Sothe is while that he bode in this manner
He began his woo full manly for to hyde
That well uneath / it seen was in his chere
But at the yate / there she should out ride
With certain folk he houyd her to bide
So woo bygo / al would he not complain
That on his horse uneath he sat for pain
For Ire he quoke / so began his heart gnawe
When Dyomede / on horse him began dress
And said to him self this ylk saw
Alas quod he / thus foul and wretchydnesse
Why suffer I it / why nyl I it redress
Were it not bet at ones for to dye
Than evermore in langoure / thus for to dry
Why nyl I make at ones rich and pour
To have enough to do / or that she go
Why nyl I bring al Troy in Roure
Why nyl I slay this Dyomede also
Why nyl I rather with a man or two
Stele her awey / why will I thus endure
Why nyl I help / to mine own cure
But why he nold do so fell a deed
That shall I sey / and why he list to spare
He had in heart alwey a manner dread
Lest that Creseyde in rumor of this fare
Should have been slain / lo thus was al his care
And else certain / as I said ore
He had it done without words more
Creseide when she ready was to ride
Full sorowfully she sight / and said alas
But forth she mote / for ought that may betide
There nys none other remedy in this caas
And forth she rode full sorowfully a paas
What wonder is / though her sore smert
When she forgoth / her own dear heart
This Troilus in wise of curtesye
With hawke on hond / and with an huge rowte
Of knights rode / and did her company
Passing all the valeye far without
And ferther would have ride / out of doubt
Full feign / and woo was him to goo so soon
But right with that was Anthenore y gone
But turn he must / and eke it was to done
Out of the greeks host and every wight
Was of it glad / and said he was welcome
And Troylus nere al his heart light
He peyned him with all his full might
Him to withold of weeping at the leest
And Anthenore / he kyst and made feast
And here with all / his lady^s leave to take
He cast his eye upon her pytously
And nere he rode / his cause for to make
To take her by the hond / al sobyrly
And lord she began weep t^ndyrly
And he full soft / slyly began her seye
Now hold your day / and do me not to deye
With that his courseur / turned he ab^u^^
With (...) pale / and unto Dyomede
No word he spak / ne none of al his reut^
Of which the sone of Tydeus took beede
As he that couthe more than hie C^^de
In such a craft / and by the mine her ^^nt
And Troylus to Troy homeward went
This Dyomede that led ^yr by the brydel
When that he saw the folk of Troy awey:
Thought al my labor / shall not be m^ydel
If that I may / for somewhat shall I sey
For at the les^ yet / it may short over wey
I have herd seyde eke / times twyre twelve
He is a fool that will fory^ce him selue
But netheles thus / thought he well enough
That certeynly / I am about naught
If that I speak of love / or make it tough
For douteles if she have in her thought
Him that I guess / he may not be y brought
So soon awey / but I shall find a mean
That she not yet shall wy^^ what I mean
This Dyomede as he that couthe his good
When time was / began fall forth in speech
Of this and that / and asked why she stood
In such dysese / and began her byseche
That if he encrece might or each
With any thing / her ease that she would
Comounde it him / and he do it would
For trewely he swore her as a knight
That there nas thing with which he myt her please
That he nyl do his heart and al his might
To do it / for to do her heart an ease
And prayed her she would her apease
And said ywys we greeks conne have joy
To honor you as wese / as folk of Troy
He said eke thus / ^ wot ye think it strange
No wonder to / for it is to you new
T^^queyntau^ce of these Trojans for to change
For folk of greece / that ye never knew
But would never god / but that as true
A greek ye might among us all find
As any Trojan is and eke as kind
And by cause I swore you right now
To be your friend / and helply to my might
And for the more acquaintance eke of you
Have I had than another strange wight
So fro this forth I pray you day and night
Comaundyth me how sore that I smert
To do all that may like unto your heart
And that ye me would as for your brother treat
And takyth not my frendshyp in despyte
And thou your sorrows ben for things great
Note I not why / but out of more respyte
Mine heart has to amend it great delight
And if I may your harms not redress
I am right sorry for your heaviness
For though ye Troia^s be with us greeks wroth
Have many a day / and ben yet parde
O god of love sith we seruen both
And for the love of god my lady free
Whom so ye hate / ne be not wroth with me
For trewely there can no wight you serve
That half so loath your wrath would deserve
And nere it that we ben so nigh the tent
Of Calcas which that see us both may
I would of this now tr^^e al mine eutent
But this ensealed shall be till another day
Give me your hand / I am and shall be ay
God help me so while that my life may dure
Your own above any creature
Thus said I never or now to women born
For god mine heart as wysly glad so
I loved never woman here byforn
As peramour ne never shall no moo
And for the love of god be not my foo
Al can I not to you my lady dear
Complain a right / for I am yet to lere
And wondryth not mine own lady bright
Though yt I speak of love to you thus blyue
For I have herd or this of many a wight
That louyd thing / he never saw his live
For I am not of power for to strive
Against god of love but him obey
I will alwey / and of mercy you preye
There ben so worthy knights in this place
And ye so fair that eueryche of hem all
Will peynen hem to stond in your grace
But might me so fair a grace fall
That ye me for your servant would call
So lowely ne so trewely would serve
Nyl none of hem as I shall till I sterue
Crrseyde unto that purpoos little ansuerd
As she that was with sorrow oppressyd so
That in effect she naught his tales herd
But here and there / now here a word or two
Her thought her sorrowful heart breast a two
For when she began her fader fer aspye
Well nyghe down of her hor^ she began to sye
But netheles she thanked Dyomede
Of al his travail and his good chere
And that him list his freudshyp her to lyde
And she accepting it in good manner
She would do feign / that is him lyef and dear
And trustyn him she would and well she might
As seyde she / and from her horse she light
Her fader has her in his arms nome
And twenty time he kyst his daughter sweet
And seyde dear daughter mine welcome
She said she was feyn with him to mete
And stood forth mylde and mansuete
And thus I leave her with her fader dwell
And forth I will of Troylus you tell
To Troy is come this woeful Troylus
In sorrow above al sorrows smert
With felon look and face defpytous
And suddenly down from his horse he stert
And through his palace with a swollen heart
To chamber went / of nothing took he head
For none durst to him speak a word for dread
And there his sorrows that he spared had
He yaue an issue large / and death he cried
And in his throws frentyk sore and mad
He cursyd Juno Appollo and eke Cupyde
He cursyd Ceres Bachus / and Cypryde
His birth / him self and eke nature
And save his lady / every creature
To bed he goth / walwyth there and (...)
In furye / as does he Ixyoun in (...)
And in this wise / heavy till day sorou^^^^
But tho bygan his heart / a little vnswelle
Through t^rys / which began up to well
And pytously he cried upon C^^sey^^
And to him self right thus he spok and said

Where is her white b^^st / where is it (...)
Where ben her arms / and her eyes (...)
That ^^ster night this time with me were

And graspe about I may but in this place

O lady mine that I love and no moo

Now I am goo / who yeueth you andy^nce
Who speaks for me now in mine absence

For well I wo^e as evil as I ye (...)
How shall I thue ten days full endure
When I the first night have all this trne
How shall ye do sorrowful creature
For tendyrnes how shall ye eke sustene
Such woo for me / how pytous pale and grene
Shall be your fresshe womanly face
For longyng or ye torn in to this place
And when he fylle in any s^^mbrynges
A none begin he should to groan
And dreme of right dredeful things
That night / as mete that he were alone
In place horrible making ay his moan
Or metyn that he was among all
His enemies / and in her hondes f^lle
And therewith al his body should stert
And with the styrt al suddenly awake
And such a crampe feel about his heart
That of the fere his body should auake
And there with all / he should a noise make
And seem as though he should fulle deep
From hye aloft / and than he would weep
And rewe on him self so pytously
That wonder was to here his fantasye
Another time he should myghtely
Comfort him self / and sey it was folly
So causeles such dredys for to dry
And after begin his aspre sorrows new
That every man might on his sorrow row
Who couthe tell a right or full deseryue
His weo his pleynt / his langour and his pyne
Not all the men that have or ben alive
Thou reder may full (...) thy self dyuyna
That such a woo my wit can not defyne
On ydel should I write it with ynke
When that my wit is weary it to think
On heuene the sterres were y seen
Al though full pale woxen was the mon^
And whyten began the orysount shene
Al Estward as it is wont to done
And Phoebus with his rosy cart soon
Began after that to dress him up to fare
When Troylus has sent after pandare
This Pandare that of al day byforn
Ne might have come Troylus to see
And though on his head / he had it sworn
For with king Priamus al day was he
So that it lay not in his lyberte
Nowhere to goo / but on the morrow he went
To Troylus when that he for him sent
For in his heart he couthe well dyuyne
That Troylus al night for sorrow woke
And that he would tell him of his pyne
This knew he right well without book
For which to his chamber the right wey he took
And Troylus tho soothly he grette
And on the bed full soon he began him set
My Pandare quod Troylus the sorrow
Which that I dry / and may not long endure
I trow I shall not live till to morrow
For which I would alweys in adventure
To the deuyse of my sepulture
The form and of my meoble thou dyspone
Right as the seems lest is for to done
But of the fnrye and flawmes funeral
In which my body brenne shall to gleede
And of the feast and plays palestral
At my vygyles I pray take good head
That that he well and offer mars my stead
My swerd / mine helm / and lyef brother dear
My shield to pallas give that shyneth clear
The poudre in which mine heart brent shall torn
That pray I the thou take / and it conserve
In a vessel that men clepyn an vrne
Of gold to my lady that I serve
For love of whom thus pytously I sterue
So give it her and do me this plesaunce
To pray her to keep it for a remembrance
For well I feel by my maladye
And by my dremes / now and yore ago
Al certeynly that I mote needs dye
The Owl eke which that hight Escaphylo
Has after me shryght / al these nyghtes two
And god Mercurye now of me woeful wretch
The soul guide / and when ye list it fetch
Pandare answered and said O Troylus
My dear friend as I have told the yore
That it is folly for to sorrow thus
And causeles / for which I can no more
But who so will not trowen read ne lore
I can not see in him no remedy
But let him worche with his fantasye
But Troylus I pray the tell me now
If thou wot or this any wight
Has louyd peramour as well as thou
Ye god wot / and from many a worthy knight
Has his lady ben a fourtenyght
And he not yet made haluendele the fare
What need is the to maken all this care
Sith day by day thou may thy self see
That from his love / or else from his wife
A man mote twynne of necessyte
Ye though he love her / as his own life
And though between you were never no strif
For well thou wost my lyef brother dear
That alwey frendys may not ben y fere
How done these folk that seen her loves wedded
By frendys might / as it betyd full often
And seen hem in her spouses bed y beddyd
God wot they take it wisely fair and soft
Without words or blowyng out aloft
And for they conne a time of sorrow endure
As time hem hurt / time will hem recure
So shall thou endure and lote slide
The time / and found to be glad and light
Ten days is not so long to abide
And sith she to come has behyght
She nyl her heest break for no wight
For dread not but she will find a wey
To come again my life that dare I ley
Thy sweuenes eke / and al such fantasye
Drive out and let hem goo to mysehauuce
For though they proceed of thy Melancolye
That does the feel in sleep all this penance
Straw for all thy sweuenes sygnyfyannce
God help me so / I count hem not at a been
There wot noman a right what dremes mean
For preestys of the temple tellen this
That dremes ben the reuelacyons
Of gods / and as well they tell ywys
That they ben infernal illusyons
And leches seyn that of complexyons
Proceden they of fasting or glotenye
Who wot in soth what they sygnefye
Eke other soyn that through Impressyons
As if a wight has fast a thing in mind
That thereof come such vysyons
And other seyn as they in books find
That after times of the year by kind
Men dreme and that theffect goth by the moon
But leave no dreme sith it is not to done
Well worth of dremes al these old wives
And trewely angury of these fowls
For fere / whereof men wene to lose their lives
As rauenes qualme / and shrikyng of these oules
To trowen on it / falls and foul is
Alas alas that so noble a creature
As is a man should dread such ordure
For which with all mine heart I the byseche
Unto thy self / all this thou foryeue
And rise now up without more speech
And let us cast / how forth may best bedryue
This time and eke / how fresshely we may live
When that she comyth that shall be right soon
God help me so / this thynk me best to done
Rise let us speak / of lusty life in Troy
That we hane lad / and forth this time drive
And eke of time coming / as of joy
That bring shall our bliss / now so blyue
And langour of these / twyes days five
We shuln therewith / so foryete our oppress
That well uneath / it shall do us duresse
This town is full of lordys al about
And trewes lasts / all this mean while
Goo we pley us / in some lusty route
To Sardepedon / not hens but a mile
And thus thou shall / the time well begyle
And drive it forth / unto thy blysful morrow
That thou her see / that is cause of thy sorrow
Now rise / my dear brother Troylus
For certain none honor / is to the
To weep / and in thy bed to rowken thus
For trewely of one thing / trust thou me
If thou thus lygge / a day two or three
The folk will say / that thou for cowardyse
Thou feynest the seek and dare not arise
This Troylus ansuerd / O brother dear
This known folk / that han suffered pain
That though he weep and make sorrowful chere
That felyth harm / and smert in every beyne
No wonder is though that I ever pleyne
Or alwey were I am no thing to blame
Sith I have lost / the cause of al my game
But s^th of fyn force I must arise
I shall arise as soon as ever I may
And god to whom mine heart I sacrifise
So send us hastily now the tenthe day
For was there never foul so feign of may
As I shall be when / she comyth in Troy
That cause is of my tormente / and my Joy
But whyder is thy read quod Troylus
That we pley us may best in this town
My counseyl is by god / quod pandarus
To ride and pleye us with Sarpedon
So long of this they speken up and down
Till Troylus at the last began assent
To rise / and forth to Sarpedon they went
This Sarpedon / as he that honorable
Was ever his life / and full of hye largess
With all that might served be at table
That deynte was / al cost it great richesse
He fed hem day by day / that such noblesse
As sayden both the more and eke the least
Was never seen or wist at any feste
Nor in this world there nys none ins^^^ment
Delight of song / or touch of cord
As fer / as any wight has ever went
That tongue tell / or heart may record
That at the fest / it nas herd acorde
Of ladies eke so fair a company
On daunces as tho / was none seen with eye
But what avails this to Troylus
That for his sorrow no thing of it rought
For ever in one / his heart pyteuous
Full besyly Creseyde his lady sought
On her was ever / all that his heart thought
Now this now that / so fast ymagynyng
That glad ywys can him no festenyng
These ladies that at the ^^st been
Sith that he saw his lady was aweye
It was his sorrow / upon hem to seen
Or for to here / Instruments pleye
For she that of his heart bare the keye
Was absent / loo this was his fantasye
That no wight should make melodye
For there nas hour / in the day nor night
When he was there / that no man myt him here
That he no said / O blysful lady bright
How have ye fare / sith that ye were here
Welcome ywys mine own lady dear
But well awey / all this nas but a mase
Fortune his houe / entendyd bet to glase
The letters eke / that she of old time
Had him sent / he would anon read
And often betwyxt / none and pryme
Refyguryng her sha^ / and her womanhede
Within his heart / and every word and deed
That passed was / and thus he droof to an end
The fourth day with Pandare his friend
And said / lyeue brother Pandarus
Entendyst thou / that we shall here believe
Til Sarpedon forth will conueye us
Yet were it fayrer that we took our love
For gods love / let us soon at eve
Our leave take / and home let us torn
For trewely I nyl not thus soiourne
Pandare ansuerd / be we comen hyder
To fetch fuyre and torn home again
God help me so / I can not tell whyder
We might gone / if I shall sothly seyne
There any wight / is of us more feyn
Than Sarpedon / and if ye hens hye
Thus suddenly / I hold it vylonye
Sith that we said / we would bleue
With him a wyke / and now thus suddenly
The fourth day take of him our leu^
He would wonder / on it trewely
Let us forth hold / our purpoos fermely
And sith that ye behyghte him for to abide
Hold forward now / and after ^^te us ryd^
This pandarus with all pain and woo
Made him to dwell / and at the wekes end
Of Sarpedon they took her l^ue tho
And on their wey they sped hem to wend
Quod Troylus / now lord me gr^^^ send
That I may find / at mine home coming
Creseyde y come / and therewith he began sing
Ye ^^syl wood quod this Pandare
And to him self full softely he seyde
God wot^ referyde / may thy (...) fare
Or Cal^^^ send to Troylus Creseyde
But netheles he (...) thus and (...)
And swore ywys / his h^rt him thus (...)
She would come as soon as she might
When they unto the paleys were y common
Of Troylus / they down of hor^ alyght
And to the chamber the wey have they (...)
And in to time / that it began to night
They speak al of Creseyde the bright
And after this / when ^^m both life
They sped hem from sowper unto rest
On morrow as sone / as day bygan to clear
This Troylus began of his sleep to abreyde
And to Pandare his own brother dear
For love of god / full pytously he seyde
As goo we see the paleys of Creseyde
For sith we yet may have no more feste
So let us see her pal^ys at the least
And there with all his meyne for to blende
A cause he fond in Town for to goo
And to Creseyde house they began to wend
But lord this cely Troylus was woo
He thought his sorrowful heart barst a two
For when he saw her doors sperid all
Well nyghe for sorrow a down he began to fall
Therwyth when he was ware / and ga^ behold
How shet was every wyndowe of the pla^^
As frost him thought his heart began to cold
For which him thought with dedely pale (...)
Without word forth by he began to pace
And as god would / he began so fast to ride
That no wight of his countenance espyde
Than said he thus / O palace desolate
Of honor of gladness whylome best y dyght
O palace empty and dysconsolate
O thou la^terne / of which quenchyd is the lyt
O palace whylome day / that now art night
Well ought thou to fall down / and I to dye
Sith she is went that was wont us to guye
O palace whylome crown of hows all
Enlumyned with son of al bliss
O ryng from which the Ruby is y fall
O cause of woo / that cause have be of lysse
Yet sith I may not bet / fayn would I hysse
Thy cold do^^ / if I durst for this rowte
And fare well shryne / of which ye corpse is out
Therewith he cast on Pandarus his eye
With chaungyd face / and pytous to byhold
And when he might his time right espy
Ay as he rood to Pandarus he told
His new sorrow and eke his joys old
So pytously / and with so deed an hew
That enery wight / might on his sorrow rewe
From thensforth / he rydeth up and down
And every thing come him to remembrance
As he rode by the places in the town
In which he had / had his plesaunce
Loo yonder saw I last my lady dance
And in that temple with her eyes clear
Me caught first / my right lady dear
And yonder have I herd / full lustely
My dear heart laugh and yonder pleye
Saw I her ones / eke full blysfully
And to me ones yonder began she seye
Now good sweet / love me well I preye
And yond so goodly / began she me hehold
That to the death / mine heart is to her hold
And^ at the corner in the yonder hows
Herd I mine al there leuest lady dear
So womanly with boyce melodyous
Syngen so well / so goodly and so clear
That in my soul me thinks I here
That blysful sown / and in that yonder place
My lady first me took unto her grace
Than thought he thus / O blysful lord Cupyde
When I the process have in memory
How thou me have werreyd on every side
Men might a book make of it like a storye
What need is the to seek of me vyctorye
Sith I am thyn and holy at thy will
What joy have thou thine own folk to spylle
Well have thou lord broke on me thine Ire
Thou myghtful god / and dredeful for to grieve
Now mercy lord / thou woost well I desire
This grace most of al lusts leave
And live and dye I will in that byleus
For which I ne axe in guerdon but a boon
That thou me send Creseyde again soon
Dystreyne her heart as fast to return
As thou do mine / to long her to see
Than wot I well / that she nyl not soiourne
Now blysful lord / so cruel thou ne be
Unto the blood of Troy I pray to the
As Jove was / unto the blood of Thebane
For which the folk of Thebes / caut their bane
And after this / he to the yates went
There as Creseyde / rode out a full good paas
And up and down there made he many a went
And to him self full often he said alas
From hens rode / my blys and my solas
And would blysful god now for his joy
I might her seen again come to Troy
And to the yonder hylle / he began her gyde
Alas / and there I took of her my leave
And yond I saw her / unto her fader ride
For sorrow of which / mine heart will to cleue
And hyder home I come / when it was eve
And here I dwell out cast / from al joy
And shall till I may see her efte in Troy
And of him self / ymagyned he full often
To be defeted / pale and wexe less
Than he was wont / and that men sayden soft
What may it be / who can the sothe guess
Why Troylus has all this heaviness
And all this nas but his melancolye
That he had of him self such fantasye
Another time ymagyne he would
That every wight / that went by the weye
Had of him rowthe / and they seyn should
I am right sorry / Troylus will deye
And thus he droofe forth yet a day or tweye
As ye have herd / such life he began led
As he that stood between hope and dread
For which him lyked in his songs show
Thencheson of his woo / as he best might
And made a song of words but a few
Somewhat his woeful heart for to light
And when he was from every man's sight
With soft voys / he of his lady dear
That absent was / began syngen as ye shall here
O sterre of which I have y lost the light
With heart sore / ought I to bewail
That ever derke in turment / night by night
Toward my death / with wynd^ I (...) and sail
For which the tenthe night / if that I fail
The Aydemant of thy beams / bright and our
My ship and me Carybdye will devour
This song when he had songen soon
He syl again in to his syghes old
And every night as he was wont to (...)
He stood the bright moan to behold
And al his sorrow he to the moon ^old
And said ywys when thou art horne^ (...)
I shall be glad / if all the world be true
I saw thyn horns eke / old by the morrow
When (...) rode my right lady (...)
That cause to of my turment and my sorrow
For which bright ^neyna the clear
For love of god ^^nne fast about thy (...)
For when thy horns new gynne spryng
Than shall she come / that may my bliss (...)
The day is more / and longer every night
Than they be wont to be / him thought tho
And that the son went his course unright
By longer ^^ey / than he is wont to do
And said ywys me dredyth euermo
The sons sone Phyron to be a live
And that his cart amys he does drive
Upon the wallys / fast he would walk
And on the greeks fast he would see
And to him self right thus he would talk
Loo yonder is mine own lady free
Or else yonder / there the tents be
And thens comyth this air / that is so swote
Foe in my soul I feel it does me bote
And hardyly this / wind more and more
Thus stounde mele encreaced in my face
Is of my lady dear / syghes sore
I preue it thus / for in none other space
Of all this Town / save only in this place
Feel I no wind / that sownyth so like pain
It seyth alas / why twynned be we tweyne
This long time he dryuyth forth right thus
Till fully passed was the nynthe night
And ay beside him / was this Pandarus
That besyly did his full might
Him to comfort / and make his heart light
Yeuyng him hope alwey the tenthe morrow
That she shall come / and stynt all this sorrow
Upon that other side was this Creseyde
With wymmen few among the greeks strong
For which full often / alas alas she seyde
That I was born / well may mine heart long
After my death / for now live I to long
Alas / and I may it not amend
For now is wers / than ever yet I wend
My fader nyl for no thing do me grace
To goo ageyn / for naught I can him queme
And if so be that I my term pace
My Troylus shall now in his heart deem
That I am falls / and so it may well seem
Thus shall I have vnthank on every side
That I was born / so well awey the tide
And if I me put in ieopordye
To stele awey to night / and it byfalle
That I be caught I shall be hold aspye
Or else / loo this dread I most of all
If in the hands of sum wretch I fall
I am but lost al be mine heart true
Now mighty god thou on my sorrow rewe
Full pale was woxe her bright face
Her lymes leene / as she that all the day
S^ood when she durst / and lokyd on the place
There she was borne / and there she dwelled ay
And all the night weeping / alas she lay
And thus dyspeyred out of al cure
She lad her life / this woeful creature
Full often a day / she syghed for dystresse
And in her self / she went ay portrayeng
Of Troylus the great worthynesse
And al his goodly wordys recordyng
Sith first yt day / their love bygan to spryng
And thus she sent her woeful heart a fire
Through remembrance of that she began desire
In all this world / there nys so cruel heart
That her had herd compleyue in that sorrow
That nold have wept for peynes smert
So tendyrly she wept both eve and morrow
Her nedyd no terys for to borowe
And this was yet the worst of al her pain
There was no wit / to whom she myt co^pleyne
For rewfully she looked upon Troy
Byheld the toures hye and eke the halles
Alas quod she the plesaunce and the joy
The which al new turned in to galle is
Have I had often within yonder wallys
O Troylus what do thou now she seyde
Lord whether thou yet think upon Creseyde
Alas I ne had trowed / upon your lore
And wend with you / as me red or this
Than had ynow not syghed / half so sore
Who might han seyde / that I had done amys
To stele awey / with such one as he is
But al to late / comyth the lectuarye
When men the corpse unto the grave carye
To late is now / to speak of that matere
Prudence alas / one of thyn eyes three
Me lakked alwey or that I come here
Of time passed I will remember me
And present time / well couthe I see
But future time / or I was in the snare
Couthe I not see / that causith al my care
But netheles betide / what betyde
I shall to morrow at night / by est or west
Out of this hostel / on some manner side
And goo with Troylus where so him lest
This p^rppos will I hold / and this is best
No fors of wykke tongues / Iangel^rye
For ever on love / have wretches envy
For who so will of every word take heed
Or rewle him self / by every wyghtes wit
Ne shall he never thryue out of dread
For that sum men blamen ever yet
Loo other men / yet comendyn it
And as for me / al such varyaunce
Felycyte clepe I my suffysaunce
For which without any words mo
To Troylus will I / as for conclusyon
But god it wot / or fully nyghtes two
She was full fer from that entencyoun
For both Troylus and Troy town
Shall knotteles through her heart slide
For she will another purpoos abide
This Dyomede / of whom I tell you? began
Goth now within him self / ay arguyng
With all sleyghte / and all that ever he can
How he may best / with shortest taryeng
In to his net / Creseydes heart breng
To this intent / he couthe ^euer fine
To fysshen her / he leyd out hook and line
But netheles well in his heart he thought
That she was not without a love in Troy
For he never sith / he her thens brought
Ne couthe her see laugh / ne make joy
He nyst how best / her heart to acoye
But for to assay / he seyde not ne greuyth
For he yt naught ne assayeth / nout ne cheuyth
Yet said he him self upon a night
Now am I not a fool / that wot well how
Her woo for love is of another wight
And herupon to goo assaye now
I may well wit / it will not be my prow
For wise folk in books it express
Men should not wowe a wight in heaviness
But who so might win such a flower
From him / for whom she mornyth nyt and day
He might sey / he were a conqueror
And right anon / as he that told was ay
Thought in his heart / hap how I hap may
Al should I dye / I will her heart seche
I shall no more lose / but my speech
This Dyomede / as books us declare
Was in his need pressed and corageous
With stern voys / and mighty lymes square
Hardy right strong / and chyualrous
Of dedys like his fader Tydeus
And some men seyn he was of tongue large
And heyr he was of Calydoyne and Arge
Creseyde med yoc^e / was of stature
Thereto of shap / of face / and eke of chere
There might be no fayrer creature
And of time this was her manner
To goo y tressyd with her here is clear
Down by her Coler / at her bak behind
Which with a threde of gold / she would bind
And save her brows joined in fere
There was no lak in ought I can espyen
But for to speak of her eyes clear
Trewely they written all that her syen
That paradyse stood formed in her eyes
And with her rich beauty evermore
Stroofe love in her ay / which was more
She sobre was simple / and wise with all
The best nortured eke that might be
And goodly of her speech in general
Charytable estatly / lusty / and free
Ne neuermore lakkyd her pytee
Tender herted / slydyng of courage
But trewely I can not tell her age
And Troylus well woxen was in heyght
And complete fourmed by proporcyon
So well that kind not amend might
Young / fresshe / strong / and hardy as lyoun
True as styele in each condycyoun
One of the best entedchyd creature
That is or shall while the world may dure
And certeynly in storye / as it is found
That Troylus was never unto no wight
As in his time / in no degree secound
In daryng do that longyth to a knight
Al might a Gyaunt / passen him of might
His force ay with the first / and with the best
Stood peregal / to do what him lest
But for to tell forth of Dyomede
It fyl after / that on the tenthe day
Sith that Creseyde / out of the cite yeede
This Dyomede as fresshe / as branch in may
Come to the tent / there as Calcas lay
And feyned him with Calcas have to done
But what he meant / I shall you tell soon
Creseyde at short wordys for to tell
Welcomed him / and did him by her set
And he was ethe ynowe / to make duelle
And after this without long let
Spyces and wyn men forth hem fet
And forth they speak of this and that y fere
As frendys do / of which some ye shall here
He began first fall of the werre in speech
Betwyxt hem and the folk of Troy Town
And of thassyege / he began her byseche
To tell him / what was her oppynyoun
Fro that demand / he so descendyth down
To asken her / if that she strange thought
The greeks gyse / and werkys that they wrought
And why her fader / taryeth here so long
To wedden her unto sum worthy knight
Creseyde that was in her peynes strong
For love of Troylus her own dear knight
As ferforth as she connyng had or might
Ansuerd him tho / but al of his intent
It seemed not / she wist what he meant
But netheles this ylke Dyomede
Began in him self assure / and thus he seyde
If I a right / have take of you head
Me thinks thus / O lady mine Creseyde
Sith that I first hand on your brydel leyde
When ye out come of Troy by the morrow
Ne couthe I never see you but in sorrow
Can I not seyn what may the cause be
But it for love of sum Trojan it were
The which right sore would a thynk me
That for any wight that dwells there
Sholden spylle a quarter of a tere
Or pytously / your self so begyle
For dredeles it is not worth the while
The folk of Troy / as who seyth al and some
In prysoune be / as your self see
For thens shall none a live come
For all the gold between son and see
Trustyth right well / and understand me
There shall not one to mercy / goo alive
Al were he lord of worlds twyes five
Such wreche on hem for fetchyng of Heleyne
There shall be take or that we hens wend
That Maunes which gods ben of pain
Should ben aghast / how greeks should hem shende
And men shuln dread unto the worlds end
From hens forth to rauysshe any queen
So cruel shall our wreche on hem be seen
And but if Calcas led us with Ambages
That is to sey with double words slye
S^che as men clepe a word with two vysages
Ye shall well know / that I naught ne lie
And all this thing right sone with your eye
And that anon ye will not trow how soon
Now takes heed / for it is to done
What wene ye your wise fader would
Have you yew / for Anthenore anon
If he ne wist that the cytee should
Destroyed be / why nay so mote I gone
He knows full well there shall escape none
That Trojan is / and for the great fere
He durst not / that ye duellyd longer there
What would ye more love some lady dere^
Let Troy and Trojans from your heart pace
Drive out your bitter hope / and make good chere
And clepe again the beauty of your face
That ye with salt teres so deface
For Troy is brought in such ieopardy
That it to save is nowher remedy
And thinks well / ye shall in greeks find
A more parfyte love / or it be night
Than any Trojan is / and more kind
And bet to serve you / will do his might
And if ye vouch^ souf my lady bright
A will be he / to serve you my selue
Ye lever than be king of greeks twelve
And with that word / he began to wexe read
And in his speech a little wight be quo^e
And cas^ a side a little with his head
And s^ynt a while / and afterward be wo^e
And sobyrlyche on her threw his look
And said I am / al be it to you no joy
As gentyl a man / as any wight in (...)
For if my f^der Tydens he seyde
Lived had / I had be long or this
Of Calcydony and Arge / a ^yng Creseyde
And so I hope I shall be yet ywys
But he was sleyn / alas the more harm is
Vn^appely at Theles / al to rathe
Polemytes / and many a man to scathe
But heart mine sith I am your man
And y^ the first / of whom I sec^e grace
And serve you / as hertely as I can
And ever shall while I to live have space
So or that I depart out of this place
That ye me grant that I may to morrow
At better leyser / tell you my sorrow
What should I tell his words / that he seyde
He spak enough for one day at the meest
It preueth well he spak^ so that Creseyde
Granted him a morrow / at his request
To have a speech with her at the lest
So that he nold speak of such matere
And thus she said to him as ye may here
As she that had her heart on Troylus
So that there may none it arace
And strangely she spak / and said thus
O Dyomede I love that ylke place
That I was born in / and Jove for his grace
Delyuere it soon / of all that do it care
God for thy might / so lene it well to fare
That greeks would in Troy their wrath wreke
If that they might I know it well ywys
But it shall not fallen / as ye speak
And god to forn / and further over this
I wot my fader loyse and ready is
And that he has me bought / as ye me told
So dear I am the more to him hold
These greeks ben of high condycyoun
I wot it well / but certain men shuln find
As worthy folk within Troy Town
As conning / as parfyte / and as kind
As between Orcades and y^de
And that ye couthe well your lady serve
I trow it well / her thank for to deserve
But as to speak of love ywys she seyde
I had a lord / to whom I wedded was
The which mine heart had / till that he deyde
And other love / as help me now pallas
There in mine heart nys ne never was
And that ye be of noble and hye kynrede
I have it herd well tell out of dread
And that does me / to have so great a wonder
That ye will scorn any woman so
Eke god wot love and I ben fer a sonder
I am dysposed / bet so mote I goo
Unto my death to plain and make woo
What shall I do after can I not seye
But trewely as yet me list not to pleye
Mine heart is now in trybulacyon
And ye in arms lesy day by day
Here after when ye wonnen hane the town
Parauenter than so it hap may
That when I see / that never yet I say
Than will I werk / that I never wrought
This word to you enough suffysen ought
Tomorowe wol I speak with you fayn
So that ye touch not of this matrre
And when you list ye may come here again
And or ye goo / thus much I sey you here
As help me pallas with her here is clear
If that I should on any greek have routhe
It should be your self by my truth
I seye not therefore that I will you love
Ne I say not nay / but in conclusyon
I mean well by god / that sytte aloue
And therwyth al she cast her eyes down
And began to syghe / and said O Troy Town
Yet bid I god in quyete and in rest
I may the sea / or do mine heart breast
But in effect as shortly for to say
This Dyomede al fresshe new again
Began precen in / fast her mercy pray
And after this the soth for to seyne
Her glove he took / of which he was full feyn
And finally when it was woxen eve
And al was well / he roose / and took his leave
The bright Veuus folowyd / and ay tought
The weye there broad Phoebus a down light
And Cythera the chare horse over raught
To whyrle out of the lyoun / if she might
And Signifer his candel showed bright
When Creseyde unto her rest went
In with her faders fair bright tent
Retournyng in her soul up and down
The words of this sodeyne Dyomede
His great estate and peril of the Town
And that she was alone / and had need
Of frendys / and thus bygan to bread
The cause why the sooth for to tell
That she took purpoos fully for to duelle
The morrow came / and goostely for to speak
This Dyomede is come to Creseyde
And shortly lest that ye my tale break
So well he for him self spak and seyde
That al his syghes sore a down he leyde
And finally the soothe for to seyne
He left of the great / of al his pain
And after this / the story tells us
That she him yafe the fair bay stead
The which she ones had of Troylus
And eke a broche that was little need
That Troylus was / she yaf this Dyomede
In deed the bet / from sorrow him to releue
She made him were / a pensel of her sleue
I find eke in the storye else where
When through the body / hurt was Dyomede
Of Troylus tho wept she many a tere
When that she saw his wide wounds blede
And that she took to keep him good head
And for to hele him of his sorrows smert
Men seyn I note / she yaf him her heart
But trewely the storye tellyth us
There made never woman more woo
Than she when she falshed Troylus
She said alas / for now is clean a go
My name of truth in love for euermo
For I have falshed one the gentyllest
That ever was and eke the worthyest
Alas of me unto the worlds end
Shall neither of me be write nor s^nge
No good word / for this book will me shend^
Y rollyd shall it be on many a tongue
Thorugh outr the world / my ^elle shall be (...)
And wymmen will me hate most of all
Alas that such a caas should me byfalle
They will sey in as much / as in me is
I have him do dyshonoure well aweye
Al be I not the first that did a^nye
What helpyth that to do my blame aweys
But sith I see (...) nys no bett^^ weys
And that to late it is now for to ^^we
To Dyomede alga^^ I wylbe true
But Troylus sith I no better may
And sith that thus departen ye and I
I pray god / give you right good day
As for the gentyllest knight tr^wely
That ever I saw to serve feythfully
And (...) can ay his lady honor keep
And with that word / she br^se anon^ to wept
And ^^rtes you hatyn shall I never
And frendys love / that shall ye love of me
And my good word / al might I lyuen ever
And trewely I would right sorry be
To see you in any aduersy^^
And gylteles I wo^e well I you l^ue
But al shall pass / and thus I take my leave
But trewely how long it was between
That she forsook him for this Dyomede
There is none other auctor tells I wene
Take every man now to his books head
He shall no term find out of dread
For though that he began to love her soon
Or he her wan / yet was there more to done
Ne me lys^ not / this cely woman chyde
Forther than the story will deuyse
Her name alas is publysshed so wide
That for her gylt / it ought ynowe suffyse
And if I might excuse her in any wise
For she so sorry was for her untruth
Ywys I would excuse her yet for routhe
This Troylus as I before have told
Thus dryueth forth / as well as he might
But often was his heart hoote and ^ld
And namely that ylke nynthe night
Which on the morrow / she had him behyght
To come again / god wot full little rest
Had he that night / nothing to sleep him lest
The laurer crowned Phoebus with his heete
Come in his course / ay upward as he went
To warmen of the eest the wawes wete
And Cyrces daughter sa^ge with good intent
When Troylus his Pandare after sent
And on the wallys of the Town they pleyde
To look if they can ought see of Creseyde
Till it was none they stood for to see
Who that there come / and every manner wight
That come from fer / they said it was she
And that wey couthe known hem a right
Now was his heart heavy / now was it light
And thus beiaped they stand to stare
About naught Troylus and Pandare
To Pandarus this Troylus tho seyde
For ought I wot / before none sykerly
In to this town not comes here Creseyde
She has enough a do there hardyly
To win from her fader / so trow I
Her old fader would yet make her dyne
Or that she goo / god give his heart pyne
Pandare answered / It may well be certain
And for thy let us dyne I the byseche
And after none / than may thou come ageyn
And home they gone without more speech
And come again / and long may they seche
Or that they find / that they after gape
Fortune hem both / thinks for to iape
Quod Troylus I see well ynowe that she
Is ^aryed with her old fader so
That or she come / it wol nyhe even be
Come forth I will unto the yate goo
These portyers ben uncunning euermo
And I will do hem hold open the gate
As naught ne were / al though she come late
The day goth fast / and after that come eve
And yet come not to Troylus Creseyde
He lokyth forth by hedge / by tree / by grieve
And fer his heed on the wall he leyde
And at the last he turned him and seyde
By god I wot her menyng now pandare
Al most ywys / al new was my care
Now douteles this lady can her good
I wot she comyth rydyng pryuely
I commend her wysedom by mine hood
She will not make people nycely
Gawryn on her when she comyth / but softely
By night in to Town she thinks ride
And dear brother / thynk not long to abide
We have not else to done ywys
And Pandarns now shall thou trow me
Have here my truth / I see yond where she is
Heue up thine eyes / man may thou not see
Pandare ansuerd / nay so mote I the
Al wrong by god / what feist you man where art
That I see yond nys but a fare carte
Alas thou seyst full soth quod Troylus
But hardyly it is not al for naught
That in mine heart that I rejoice thus
It is against some good / I have a thought
Note I not how / but sith that I was wrout
Ne felt I such a comfort sothe to seye
She comes to night / my life dare I leye
Pandare answered / it may be well enough
And held with him of all that ever he seyde
But in his heart he thought / and fast lough
And to him self full sobyrly he seyde
From hasylwoode / there Ioly Robyn pleyde
Shall come all that thou do abide here
Ye fare well all the snow of fern year
The wardeyn of the gates began to call
The folk / which without the gates were
And bad hem drive in their bestes all
Or all that night they must abide there
And fer within night with many a tere
This Troylus began homeward for to ride
For well he saw / it helpyd not abide
But netheles he gladdyd him in this
He thought amys he had compted his day
And said I understand have al amys
For thylk night / I last Creseyde say
She said I shall be here / if that I may
Or that the moon / O dear heart sweet
The syoun pass out of this Aryete
For which she may yet hold her heste
And on the morrow unto the yate he went
And up and down / by west / and eke by Eeste
Vpoon the wallys made he many a went
But al for naught / his hope alwey him blent
For which at night in sorrow and syghes sore
He went him home without any more
His hope al clean out of his heart fled
He ne has whereon / no longer now to honge
But for the pain him thought his heart bled
So were his throws sharp and wonder strong
For when he saw she abode so long
He nyst what he ymagyne thereof might
Sith that the has broke / that she him behyght
The third / the fourth / the fyfthe / and the syxth day
After the days ten / of which I told
Between h^pe and dread his heart lay
(...) somewhat trustyng on her heestes old
But when he saw / she nold her term hold
He can now see none other remedy
But for to shape him soon for to dye
There with the wykked spyryte / god us bless
Which that men clepe wood Ielousye
Began in him crepe in all this heaviness
For which by cause he would soon dye
He ne ete ne drank for his melancolye
And eke from every company he fled
This was the life / that all this time he led
He so defeted was that no manner man
Him know might / uneath where he went
So was he lene / and thereto pale and wan
And feeble that he walked by potent
And with his Ire thus him self he shent
And who so asked him / whereof he smerte
He seyde his harm was al about his heart
Priamus full often / and eke his mother dear
His brethren and his sustren began him freyne
Why he so sorrowful was / in all his chere
And what thing was the cause of his pain
But al for naught he nold his cause pleyne
But seyde / he felt a grievous maladye
About his heart / and fayn would he dye
So on a day / he leyd him down to sleep
And so byfelle that in his sleep he thought
That he walked in a forest to weep
For love of her that his pain wrought
And up and down / as he the forest sought
Him thought he saw a bore with Tuskes great
That sleep a geyne the bright sons hete
And by this bore / fast in arms fold
Lay kyssyng ay / his lady bright Treseyde
For sorrow of which / when he began byhold
Loud he cried on Pandarus and seyde
For sorrow of which / almost there he deyde
O Pandarus now know I crop and rote
I am but deed / there nys none other boot
My lady bright Creseyde has me bytrayed
In whom I trustyd most of any wight
She esses where has now her heart apayed
The blisful gods through their great might
Have in my dream showed me full right
Thus in my dream Creseyde have I behold
And all this thing to pandarus he told
O my Creseyde / alas what subtylyte
What new lust / what beauty / what seyence
Has thus withdraw your heart / and love from me
This is the cause of your long absence
Has from me raft / alas your aduertence
O trust / O feyth / O deep assurance
Who has me raft Creseyde al my plesaunce
Alas why let I you from hens go
For which well nyghe out of my wit I breide
Who shall now trow on any oaths moo
God wot I wend lady bright Creseyde
That every word was gospel / that ye seyde
But who may bet begyle / if him list
Than he on whom men wene best to tryst
What shall I do / my Pandarus alas
I feel now so sharp / and a new pain
Sith that there lies no remedy in this caas
That bet it were I with mine hondes tweyne
My self slay / than thus alwey to pleyne
For through the death my woe should have an end
There every day with life my self I shende
Pandare ansuerd / and said alas the while
That I was borne / have I not said or this
That dremes may many a man begyle
And why for folk expownen hem amys
How durst thou sey / that falls thy lady is
For any dremes right for thine own dread
Lace be thy thought / thou can no dremes read
Parauenter there thou dremest of this boore
It may so be / that it may sygnefye
Her ^ader eke / which old is and hoore
Again the son lies in point to dye
And she for sorrow gynneth weep and cry
And there he lies kyssyd him on the ground
Thus sholdest thou thy dreams ryt expound
How might I than done quod Troylus
To know of this / were it never so lyte
Now seyst thou wisely quod tho pandarus
My read is this / sith thou can well endyte
That hastily a letter thou to her write
Thoragh which thou shall bryngen it about
To know a soothe there thou art in doubt
And see now why / for I dare well seyn
That if so is / she untrue be
I can not trow she will write ageyn
And if she write thou shall soon see
As whether she has / any lyberte
To come again / or else in some clause
If she be let / she will assygne a cause
Thou have not write to her / sith she went
Ne she to the / and this I durst leye
There may such cause be in her intent
That hardyly thou wylt thy self seye
That her abode / the best is for you tweye
Now write her than / and thou shall see soon
A soothe of al / there is no more to done
Acordyd ben they to this conclusyon
And that anon these ylke lords two
And hastily sit Troylus a down
And rollyth in his heart to and fro
How he may best descryuen her his woo
And to Creseyde his own lady dear
He wrote right thus / and said as ye shall here
Right fresshe flower / whose I have been and shall
Withouten part of else where seruyse
With heart / body / life / lust / thought and al

That tongue can tell or heart may deuyse

But whether ye done me live or deye
Yet pray I god / so give you right good day
And faryth well / right fair fresshe may
As ye thal life or death may me comaunde
And to your truth I me recomaunde
With health such / that but if ye give me
The same health / I shall never health have
In you lies / when you list / it so shall be
The day on which me clothen shall my grave
In you my life / your might is it to save
Me from dysese / of al peynes smerte
And f^re now well mine own sweet heart
This letter forth was sent unto Creseyde
Of which her answer in effect was this
Full pytously she wrote again and seyde
That as soon / as ever she might ywys
She would come / and mende that was amys
And finally wrote / and said him than
She would come / but she wist never when
But in her letter / she made such feestes
That wonder was / and swore she louyd him best
Of which he fond / but bottumles byhestes
But Troylus thou may now Est or west
Pype in an yuy leef / if that the lest
Thus goth ye world / god sheld us from myscha^ce
And every wight / that meneth truth auan^ce
Encreasen began the woo from day to night
Of Troylus / for taryeng of Creseyde
And lassen began his hope and eke his might
For which al down vdon his bed him leyde
He ne ete ne drank / ne sleep / ne no word seyde
Ymagynyng ay that she was unkind
For which well nyhe he wax out of mind
This dreme / of which I told have here byforn
May never come out of his remembrance
He thought as well / he had his lady born
And that Iouys, of his purueaunce
Him showed had in slope the sygnyfyaunce
Of her untruth and dysauenture
And that this was showed him in figure
For which he for Syble his suster sent
That called was Cassandra eke al about
And al his dreme / he told her or he went
And her bysought / assoylen him the doubt
Of this strong bore with tuskys stout
And finally within a little stounde
Cassandra right thus his dreme expound
She began first smyle / and said brother dear
If thou a sothe of this desyrest to know
Thou must a few of old stories here
To purpoos how that fortune overthrow
Has lords hye / which within a throw
This bore shall you know well / and of what kind
He common is / as men in books find
Dyane which that wroth was and in ire
For greeks nold do her sacryfyce
Ne encens on her altar set a fire
She for that greeks / began her despise
Wroke her in a wonder cruel wise
For with a bore / as great as Ox in stalle
She made him et^ up her corn and vpnes all
To slay this bore was all the country raised
Among which there come this bore to see
A maid one of this world best y preysed
And Meleager lord of that country
He louyd so / this fresshe maid free
That with his manhood / or he would stent
This bore he slow / and her the heed he sent
Of which as old ^okes tellen us
There roos a ^ontek ^a great envy
And of this lord des^endyd Tydeus
By line / or esses / old books lie
But how this Meleager began for to dye
Thorugh his mother will I you not ^^lle
For all to long it were for to duelle
She told eke / how Tydeus she sent
Unto the strong ^yte of Thebes
To claim kingdom of the cite and went
For his fellow ^an Possymytrs
Of which his own brother Ethyocles
Full wrongfully of (...) held the strength
This ^old she by process and by length
She told eke / how he monyde^ as^erte

And how Canapus the proud

Weep if thou wylt or leave / for out of doubt
This Dyomede is in / and thou art out
Thou seyst not soth thou falls sorceres
With all thy falls ghost of Prophecye
Thou wenest to be a great dyuyneres
Now see thou not this fool of fantasye
Peyneth her / on ladies for to lie
Awey quod he there Iouys give the sorrow
Thou shall be falls paraunter yet to morrow
As well myghtest thou lie upon Alceste
That was of creatures / but men lie
That ever was the kyndethe and best
For when her husbond was in ieopardye
To dye him self / but if she would dye
She chaas for him to dye / and goo to hell
And starf anon as us the books tell
Cassandre goth / and he with cruel heart
For that his woo / for anger of her speech
And from his bed al suddenly he stert
As though al hole him had made a leche
And day by day / he began enquere and seche
A sooth of this with all his besy cure
And thus he dryneth forth his adventure
Fortune which has the permutacyon
Of things had / as it is here committed
By purueaunce and dysposycyoun
Of him Jove / as Reygnes shul be flytted
From folk in folk / or when they shall be smitted
Began pull awey the feathers bright of Troy
From day to day / till they be bare of joy
Among all this the fyn of the parody
Of Hector began approach wonder blyue
The faate would / his soul should vnbody
And shapen had a mean out to drive
Against which faat / him helpyth not to strive
But on a day to fight began be wend
At which alas he caught his last end
For which me thinks yt every manner wit
That hauntyth arms / ought to bewail
The death of him that was so noble a knight
For as he drowe a king by the auentayle
Unware of this Achylles through the mayle
And through the body began him for to ryue
And thus yt worthy knyt was brout from live
For whom as old books tellen us
Was made such woe that tongue may it not tell
And namelyche the sorrow of Troylus
That next him was of worthynes well
And in this woo began Troylus to duelle
That for that sorrow / and love of his unrest
Full often a day he had his heart breast
But netheles though he began him dyspeyre
He dred ay his lady was untrue
Yet ay on her his heart began repair
And as lovers done / he sought ay new
To get again Treseyde bright of hew
And in his heart he went ay excusing
That Calcas caused al her taryeng
And oftyme he was in purpoos great
Him self like a pilgrim to desguyse
To seen her / but he couthe not counterfete
To be unknow of folk that were wise
Ne find excuse a right / that might suffyse
If he among the greeks known were
For which he wept full often many a tere
To her he wrote yet efte al new
Full pytously he let not for sloth
Bysechyng her / that sith he was true
That she would come again / and hold her troth
For which Creseyde upon a day for routhe
I take it so / touching all this matere
Wrote him again / and said / as ye may here
Cupydes sone / ensample of goodlyheed
O swerd of knyghthode / sours of gentylnesse
How might a wight in turment and in dread
And helthles send you / as yet gladness
I herteles / I syghe in great dystresse
Sith ye with me nor I with you may dele
You may I send neither heart ne hele
Your lettres full the papyr al be pleynted
Conceived has mine hertes pity
I have eke seyn with teres al be peynted
Your letter / and how ye ^ quyren me
To come again / which yet may not be
But why lest that this letter found were
No mencyoun make I now for fere
Grievous to me / god wot your vnreste
Your have / and if at the gods ordinance
It seems not / ye take it for the best
For other things nys in your remembraun^^
As thinks me / but only your p^saunce
But he not wroth / and that I you byseche
For that I tarry / it is for wykked speech
For I have herd well more than I wend
Towchyng v^ two how things have y sto^de
Which I shall with dyssymylyng amend
And be ye not wroth I have eke understand
How ye ne do / but hold me in hand
But now no fore / I can not in you guess
But al truth ever / and al gentylnesse
Come I will / but yet in such disioynt
I stond as now / but what hour or what day
That this shall b^ ^an I not apoynt
But in effect / I pray you as I may
Of your good word / and of your friendship ay
For trewely / whyse my life may dure
As for a friend / ye may in me assurr
Yet I pray you / on evil ye ne take
That it is short / which I to you write
I dare not there I am well lettres make
^le never yet couthe I wel^ endyte
Eke great effect / men write in place lyte
Thene^ut is al / and not the lettres space
And farith now well god have you in his grace
Troylus this letter thought al strange
When he it saw / and sorowfully he sight
Him thought it a kalendys of change
But finally he full ne trowen might
That she ne would hold him that she hight
For withful evil will / list him to leave
That louith well in such caas / thou him grieve
But netheles men seyn that at the last
For any thing / men shuln the sooth see
And such a caas betyd / and that as fast
That Troylus well understood that she
Nas not so kind / as her ought to be
And finally he wot now out of doubt
That al is lost / that he has been about
Stood on a day / in his melancolye
This Troylus / and in suspectyoun
Of her / for whom he wend for to dye
And so byfel that through Troy Town
As was the gyse / bore was up and doime
A manner cote armure / as seyth the story
Before Deyphebus in sign of vyctory
The which Cote / as seyth Lollyus
Deyphebe had rent from Dyomede
The same day / and when this Troylus
It saw he began to take of it head
Auysyng on the length / and of the bread
And all the werk / and as he began byhold
Full suddenly his heart began to cold
As he that on the coler fond within
A broche that he Creseyde yafe at morrow
That she from Troy must needs twynne
In remembrance of him / and of his sow^^^
And she him leyde her feyth again to borowe
To keep it / but now full well he wist
His lady was no l^nger for to tryst
He goth him home / and than full soon he send
For Pandarus / and all this new chance
And of his broche / he told him word and end
Compleynyng of her hertes varyaunce
His long love / his truth and his penance
And after death without words more
Full fast he cried his rest him to restore
Than ^pak he thus / O lady bright Creseyde
Where is your feyth / where is your byhest
Where is your love where is your troth he seide
O Dyomede / have ye now all this fest
Alas I would have trowed at the lest
That sith ye nold true to me stand
That thus ye nold have hold me in hand
Who shall now trow any oaths moo
Alas I would never have wend or this
That ye Creseyde couthe have changed so
Not but I had a gylt / or done amys
So cruel wend I not your heart ywys
To slay me thus / alas your name of truth
Is now fordone / and that is al my reuthe
Was there none other froche ye list to let
To fese with your new leave quod he
But thylk broche / that I with teres weete
You yofe / as for a remembrance of me
None other cause alas ne hadden ye
But for despyte / and eke for that ye meant
Al utterly to show your intent
Thorugh which I see clean out of your mind
Ye have me cast / and I ne can ne may
For all this world within mine heart find
To vnloue you a quarter of a day
In cursyd time I borne was well away
That ye that do me all this woo endure
Yet love I best of any creature
Now god quod he / yet send me that grace
That I may mete with this Dyomede
And trewely if I have might and space
Yet shall I make / I hope his sides blede
O god quod he that ought taken head
To further truth / and wrongs to punyce
Why nyl thou do a vengeance of this vice
O Pandare that in dremes for to tryst
Me blamed have / and often me up breyde
Now may thou see thy self / if that thou list
How true is now thy nece bright Creseyde
In sundry fourmes / god it wot he seyde
The gods show / both joy and tene
In sleep / and be my dreme it is seen
And certeynly without more speech
Form hens forth / as ferforth as I may
Mine own death in arms will I seche
I retche not how soon be the day
But trewely Creseyde sweet may
Whom I have ay with all my might y served
That ye thus do / I have it not deserud
This Pandarus that al these things herd
And wist well / he said a sooth of this
He not a word to him again answered
For sorry of his friends / sorrow he is
And shamed for his nece had done amys
And stood astonyed of these causes twey
As stille as stone / a word couthe he not not sey
But at the last / thus he spak and seyde
My brother dear I may do the no more
What should I sey / I hate ywys Creseyde
And god wot I will haate her evermore
And that thou me bysoughtest done of yore
Having unto mine honor / nor to my rest
Right no reward / I deed all that ye left
If I did ought / that might liken the
It is me ^^ef and of this treson now
God wot that it / a sorrow is unto me
And dredeles for heates (...) of you

And if I had taken for to write
The a^nes of thise ylke worthy man
Than would I of his bataylles endyte
But for that I to write first began
Of his love I have said as I can
His worthy deeds who so list hem here
Read dares he can tell hem al in fere
Bysechyng every lady bright of hew
And every gentylwoman what she be
That al le that Creseyde was untrue
That for that gylt ye be not wroth with me
Ye may her gylt in other books see
And gladlyer I would write / if you lest
Penolopes truth / and good Alcest
Ne I seye not this / as only for this men
But most for wymmen that betrayed be
Thorugh falls folk / god give hem sorrow amen
That with their great words and subtylyte
Bytrayeth you / and this now meueth me
To speak / and in effect al you I prey
Beeth ware of men / and harken what I sey
God little book / goo little Tregedye
That god thy maker / yet or that I dye
So send me might / to make sum comedye
But little book / make thou none envy
But subget be thou unto al Poesye
And kiss ye steps / where as thou see space
Of Vyrgyle / Ouyde / Homere / Lucan / and stace
And for there is so great dyuersyte
In English / and in writing of our tongue
So pray to god / that none myswryte the
Ne the mysmetre for defaute of tongue
And red where so thou be / or else song
That thou be understand / god I byseche
But yet to purpoos of my rather speech
The wrath / as I bygan you for to seye
Of Troylus how the greeks bought dear
For thousandys of his hands did he deye
As he that was without any pere
Save Hector in his time as I can here
But well awey / sauf only gods will
Dyspytously him slow the fyers Achylle
And when that he was slain in this manner
His light ghost / full blysfully is went
Unto the holownes of the eight spear
In his place letyng each element
And there he saw with full aduysement
How he was sloyne / alas al to rathe
The folk of Troy to much harm and skathe
And down from thens first he began advise
This little spot of earth / that with the sea
Enbracyd is / and fully began despise
This wretchyd world / and held it vanyte
To respect of that plain felycyte
That is in heuene above / and at the last
There he was slain / his lokyng down he case
And in him self he l^ugh right at the woo
On hem that wepen for his death so fast
And dampnen al our works that folowen so
The blind lust / which that may not last
And should al our hertes to heuene cast
Now forth he went shortly for to tell
There as Mercurye sortyd him to dwell
Such fine has loo / this Troylus for love
Such fine his love / such fine his noblesse
Such fine has his estate ryal above
Such fine has falls worlds trotylnesse
Such fine has al his great worthynesse
And thus bygan / his loving of Creseyde
As I have told / and in this wise he deyde
O young fresshe folks / he or she
In which that love up growyth with your age
Repayreth home from worldly vanyte
And of your heart up casts the vysage
To thylk lord / that after his image
You made / and thinks al is but a fair
This world that passyth sone / as ^^^ures fair
And louyth him which that right for love
Upon a cross our souls for to beye
First starf and roose / and sith in heuene above
For he will falls no wight dare I seye
That will his heart al holy on him leye
And soothe / he best is to love / and most meke
What needs feyned love here for to seek
Loo here of Paynems cursyd old rytes
Loo here what al their gods may avail
Loo here these worlds wretchyd appetytes
Loo here the fine and guerdon for travail
Of Jove Appollo / of mars / such rascayle
Loo here the form of old clerks speech
In poetrye / if ye their books seche
O moral Gower this book I dyrect
To the and to the Phylosophycal Strode
To vouchesauf there need is to correct
And of your benyngnytees / and zelys good
And to that sothfast / Crist that starf on roode
With all mine heart of mercy I prey
And to the lord right thus I speak and seye
Thou one and two / and three eterne a lyu^
That regnest ay in three two and one
Incircumscript / and al may circumscryue
Us from vysyble and Inuysyble foon
Defend and to thy mercy euerychone
So make us Ihesu for thy mercy dygne
For love of maiden / and mother thyn benyngne
Here ends Troylus / as touching Creseyde
