The Sege of the castle of Edinburgh

Imprentit at Edinburgh be Robert Lekpreuik. Anno. M..D^XXIII.

BVschme^t of Beru^^ make ow for the g^^
To ting our dru^mis and rank zont me^ of weir
Addres our armor bound ow for debait
With sound of trumpet mok our steids to steir
Sen ear freikes that weil dar fecht but fell.
As for exampill we have seen ow ellis,
Lyk as the last tym that our Camp come heir
Lend us ane bou^roui^g of our auld blak bellis.
Zour camp conueyit but cu^mer throw the land
In good array and rewlit by their rank.
Reddie to pas as plesit us command,
Throw all our bounds to the west sey bank.
Thocht sum me^ say e serve bot lytill thank
Suppose occatioun cum first of them sellis.
As they have broum ye bargane sa they drank
And rewis ye time yt ever they saw our bellis.
I nill repeit na poleceis put down,
Sen plesit God that we aggrie to giddir.
Except they crak their credence to the Crossed.
^^^n fair well they the find ressaue the sidder
(...) ^^ue her G. that will out ^^use considder
And as I dout not will our drive their dangeris
As scho befoir time send her forces bidder
To keip yis country cline ^ra forrane strageris.
To call to mind her money fauld good dedis,
First scho reformit the false Idolatry,
I am in dout in any realm quha redis.
Of sa lang time with sic tranquillity,
^ie faithful justice with ciuillitie.
^ie frendschip keipit to her f^is sa lang,
^^^land (...) say for our utility.
That ^^uer a ^e bettir prince in England rang.
That bennd done scho did conferme a pace,
And maid tha^ freindis yt la^g time had been fois
with stanchei^g bludesched was not eith to ceice
That men may pas not sperand quhair he gois
Syne at the sege of Leith scho sparit an^ pois
And dang the frenchmen quhilk we docht not do
Quhill hame they past in spyt of all their nois
With lose of men and left munitioun to.
Quhat tongue hes langage to declair at lenth
Their greit artalerie nor their men of weir.
France was not able to withstand their strenth
For powder, and bullet, bowls, and veher geir
What chargis was her schip^s at, may I speir,
Surmonting fifty hunder thousand frankis,
And it for all the graith her grace send heie
Ingraitfull people gave her lytill than^^^
Our Regent slave syne as I saw ^^^ir
Strife and contentiou^ raise in to the land.
Treasoun, inuy, did virtue sa deuoir,
Quhu all was done as murthour did command.
Was na^ sa stout durst tak the steir on hand
Sa has the cause been qua^ were not for shame.
Quhil we sic ^reu^ schip surth of Ingland sand
They ^^nd ane a^my heir with Leuenox hame.
Conuoyt with Drurle duchtelie in deid.
And as I holp mair haist was never done.
To Glasgw past with money trapit steid
Their skairt the sege releuit the castle sone.
Down to Dunbartane on the morn at none,
He raid bot few not fering them agane him.
Zit of that partell I praise the Lord above,
He chapit weill fra villanis wald have slane him.
That panefull progres I think all to tell,
Sen they ar bowit and bruderit in our band.
Bot at this present time exem our sell,
Quha^ confort h^s their Queen send to this land.
Is not the cannones euin at our command,
Strecht to distroy the tratoures wald ouir gang us
Commonis may cry lang n^ot that frendschip stand,
And blis her ^anis sic blythnes broucht amang us.
At Leith they landit harmeles in the Heuin,
With powder and ^ullet gunnis and other geir.
Dr^st all than plat^u^mes in to day is s^uin,
Not talking na thing that belangu to weir.
Sum wordmen had we or the camp come heir,
Iacques Gelitam gangand like ane besy be.

Quha mycht do mair but ordinance nor we.
The walis was heith we culd not weil persew them
Bot quhen we gat them boun full deir they bocht it
Be side the woll at syndrie times we slew them,
That ever they saw us sum of them sorthocht it
Ane poysonit woll to drink quhat docht it.
Infekit watter sowllit tha ne cheik and chin,
Persauing that sorrow mair they socht it.
Bot keppit standfulis at the salatis their in.
The castle segit and all beset about,
W^t^ fow^e^is wide inuerouit be slycht.
Montanis and myndis leit never man luik out,
For ordinance they dang at day and nycht.
B^ weirlyk volyis thocht the wallis was wycht,
Zit do wbell battrie brak them all in inschis.
Of Daueis toure in all the town menis sycht,
They riggein stanes come tumland ouir the trinschis
The vehement schot eid in at ather side,
By threttie Cannonis plasit at partis seuin.
Quhill they their in mycht not their heidis hyde,
For Pot Began pellettis falland from the heuin.
The Bu^bard stanis derectite fell sa euin.
That in to dykis by dint it deidly dang them,
Quhill all the houslis in the place was reuin.
The bullatis brak sa in to bladis amang them.
Continewand this ane dosand of dayis or mair,
Quhill time apointit never man durst steir.
The larum rang the Regent self was their,
My Lord Ambassat to stuid verry neir.
The manly General like the god of weir,
Not vsit to sleip quhen sic thingis ar a do,
Our Cronall als quha is ane freik hot feir,
With all his Capitanes reddie to go to.
Schir Harle Leis was present at that charg^,
My Lord Burlayis sone to stuid beside.
Cottoan and Dyar saw the sowt at large.
And Schir Gorge Carry no the knauis he cryde,
Zit Hame and Crafurde to the laue was gyde.
With certane Soiouris of the garysoun.
Four Capitanis followit at their bak to bide,
Sempill and Hectour Ramsay and Robesoun.
Bot Hume was first that ouir the walis wan,
As I heir say I was not their my sell.
The General say is he play it the vaileant man,
With prayssis mo nor I intend to tell.
Thocht Crafurdis ledder was to schort ane ell,
Zit ouir the walis he wan I wat not how.
Dunbartan to quhen sic like fortoun fell,
Their was the men that wan it I tell ow.
The Generallis band come bauldlie at their bak,
Schir Frances Russall with ane gudlie grace.
Zarlie and Erintoun nather of them was slak,
Two other Careis, Knowis, and Capitane Kace.
Than was persewand at ane other place.
Breikwell, and Lammy, Mechell, and Capitan Game,
Bauld Capitane Reid, that euir held to his face.
Pickman, and Wood, did vaileantly the same.
Spreill, Spadyn, Traill, Hutsoun, and all the laue,
Bartoun, and Stirlie, Capitan Duberie flane.
Thoise at the bak wall was the brasche they gave,
For lake of lederis their they wrocht in vane.
The men within maid sic defense agane.
They schot good Manfeild in athort the throit.
Quhill force did faill and than I saw them sane,
Woe cry ^occa^i with the waithman noit.
Halyhurtoun Strauchan with their standarts sluid
Sc^^burne ^ Schattoun hes followit on them last.
^ueris and Barrat both were men of good,
Gress^ one and Hanis was laith for to be last,
Crippis and Canttell to the partell past.
Auld Capita^ Leirmonnt with aue luik to hang them
Good M. Setoun maid their grumis aghast,
He gart the Cannones ga sa thik amang them.
Out gais the Hergbut in the Cannon glydis,
Brak al in bladdis they docht not weil abide them.
Trotlar and filtie fell and lost the hydis.
The laue sa fle^ they wist not quhen to hyde them,
Dismontit cannones slew the men beside them.
The Suddar^^s swarfit and said they wald not sar
The house was good had they had grace to gyde them
Quh^n all was done we had not been the nar.
Let na man lipin in to warldlie strenth,
Bot G^bite ground they may na thing induir.
Tratouris and treasone salbe tryit at lenth.
Quhen men wald fanest all their vices smuir
Sa Grauge beleuit the madin Castelliuir.
^aue and sic forstis to defend his touris.
Bot men with madenis quhen they play the huir,
Will anis the entry and than the house is ouris.
The Madene Castle it ^^rs ca^^^ (...)
With honor ay that nobill style it buir.
With wemenis will e do them lytill wr^^^.
To iaip them sa I think it na iniuir.
Na man our Madene Castle playtt the hu ir,
Bot ^uik appoit^n e^t quhen t^air was na parel
Smaikis had the wit I say the house was fuis
Had they been gracious with ane godly quarrel
They micht not bide is for the greit munitioun,
Bot drew in factiones quhan the larum rang.
Sum thocht it ^nde to cum and se^k remission^
And sum said best the Secreter to hang.
To his ilusiones we beleuit ouir lang.
Ane cruikit Ethnik and ane crewall Tod,
Inuentand wiche craft ay deuysand wrang.
Lat nan give credance to ane drytant God.
The^ Grang grew fleyit a wald na mait defend at
For want of watter with ane poysonn well,
His men was slane and mekle powder spend it
And wantit force to fill the wa^is that fell
Their s^bill sma^krie I (...) ^ll to ten,
With luik like Lyounes and sa lytill done.
Fie dru^in dastartis e have schannt our sell

The sudda^t^s luiffes was sa ouirlaid with lyme
S^n ge^^ gold and gat the thing he seikis,
S^i stand beside and gat not worth two leikis.
As I heie say I was not their to se.
Su^gat their handful of thie half mark sieikis
Will have na mair within ane eir nor we.
Whay schot na keyis to brek the coff^ris than,
Ane day of blythnes for the men of weir.
Sum stuid beside ane wondderous sorry man
Ane dutiful day for them that lo^^ their geir.
First saw it cave and syne they durst not fire:
Their was compleit the prophecy of Knox.
Down sea that Crage Kirkcaldy sall esteie,
With schams and scla^uder like ane hundi^ fox.
With gild of pepile sa they brocht them down.
As birdis but plumis spulieit of the nest.
Part ceyde quhair is he sat us se the loun.
Go to and st^en him sa^ him tak na rue.
Muhe^ they yt bu^e him saw them selfis oppressed,
They cryit for succor for to saif their lyuis
The Generallis lageing their they thorht it bes^:
They led him in they war sa red for wynes.
The Regent then ga^t make and (...)
To leave the spuil^e under pane of deid.
He (...) for thing bot the Kingis munitio^^,
As for the leave their was bot lytill leid.
To tak the house their was na mai^ remes^,
With all the suultis mycht follow he was ^an^.
Aganis ane Haiknay I sall wed my heid,
^range ^eis not Capitan of that Craig agan^.
With this the General was reterit a bak,
Went down to Leith quhair he had been befoln
Speik as e pleis it was ane baileant ak,
And Djurie deulie did his full deuoir.
God gat and tha^kis the Queen should have ye glo^s
We thank her Maie^tte as the matter standis.
God save her grace hes scho nor gart restoir,
Z^us captive rebellis in the Regentis handis.
By expectatioun of the commoun speiking,
Was it not thocht that Ingland su^d begylt us
And sum allegit it was the Regents seiking,
To sell the King and sa they wald outrsyle us.
Creip in our strouthis and suddanelie exyle us
O Rural pepill rusticall and rude.
We are the men that all the world dois style us,
Remembering ill and give na thankis forgude.
Ingratious pepill ignorant and vane,
^^^y do e noit our nychthoris ay with ill.
Were they not blyith for to get hame agane,
Thocht sum beleuit they wald have (...) st^ll.
To do you yield ^t they have schaunt (...) will
Buith spent their lives and largelle of their g^^
^lace my Joy is e had bot lytill skill,
That trowit that England wald have tareit heir
Quhat danger was to bring sa greit muntioun.
In for ane landis with ^i^ ane force indeid.
The only cause was to auoyid suspitioun,
That men fuld say they come not heir for greid.
Thocht sum their be of cankreit Cain seid,
Sawaris of discord dois na other thing.
Speik as they pleis schame fall their lippts ye leid
They mean na thing bot tomantent the King.
Haif they not three times in this threttene eir,
Ay quhon we socht tha^^ send their forces hedder
Baitht Schippis and Gu^nis and martial me^ of weir
To win our kyndnes give we culd considdir.
And now the last time quhen we fend to bid her
Hes scho not helpit to hols out our Tod,
Lang moit their countries leave in pace togidder
And grow in freinschip to the feir of God.
The Lenuey to the Regent.
O richteous Regent of ane Royal race,
Tratours may trimbill to behald thy fate.
Fering thy fury for their foull offenses,
Give gloir to God that hes the geuin f^e grace.
Riches with reasoun for to reuill that place.
Thou be and plantit in the sait of Princis,
Give thou wald prosper in thy just pretentis.

Sen God hes wrocth it I am weill (...),
To make of the that only instrument.
To cause this country for to know the king,

And maid sic greance with sa lytill blude.

For wisdom, manheid, and for Godlynes,
Quhair for hes God now laid this charge (...)
Bot lat, us ken that it is only he.

Remember Ahab for his febilnes.
Quha gart King Benhadah in his schera^^^,
Quhilk was his wrak be war e do not so.
Quhair for put God the yowar in our hand?

Ge^e e obey not brekand that Command,

Bot sone be rutit fra this Realm I seir,
Spair never Agag for na brybe of g^ir.
Quhat come of Saull which his fac^ Ocia their
Ta reid the Bebill it will sone declair.
To f^^k exampillis of that (...) tour,
My Lord of Murray was degradit save,
For not fulfilling of the Lordis desire.
First God promouit him in the place above,
Bot fra he saw that Justice was not done.
He left the wickit cast the wand in fire,
Be war sic materis move not God to ire.
Give e be myndit on this mold remain,
And plesit God I wald not change agane.
Lannoy to the Ambassade.
My Lord Ambassade I have lang foret,
Quhairfor indeid I have not done my det.
And he sa cairfull for our country men,
For wit and wisdom worthy to be tret.
In both the landis their is bot few to get,
That wrocht sa Godly in this muse e ken.
My dull indyte can not direct my pen,
And thocht I culd it wald coutene ane busk.
Ta put in paper all the panis he tuk.
He is not borne of better qualytie,
Of quiet speiche with greit moralytie.
Swering nor hairdrie may he nan abide
Detest and pride and prodigality.
As equal Judge but persealytie,
For feid or favor unto ather side.
Above all vsees subject leist to pride,
Ferme in his faith and full of Godlynes,
With marciall heart inclynit to my^enes,
W^ll a^cht the counttis heir a^^e good (...)
That sir Ambassade into Scotland send.
To speik vprichtlie and the treuth declair,
For na expensis did he spair to spend.
Quhill piece was brocht unto ane final end*
Quhar as he fand us at the plukup fair.
With walkryfe labor and expensis sair,
God knawis in Scotland quhat he had ad^,
With both the sydis or he culd bring us to.
In winter weddiris both in wind and rane,
Sum time with seiknes sa ourset with pane.
He raid throw montanes many mose and mire
In frost and snaw quhen all the folkis at fane,
With double bonatris for to hap their brane.
Then was he worstand our ane wondie swyre,
Sum times at nythe syne not to se ane fire.
Ar we addettit to (...) trew^ ^e strangear,
That for our proffeit put him self in danger.
As Caleb fend was for to se the land,
The gydis that come gart Moses understand
The land was feirfull and the pepill strange,
Because he knew it was the Lordis command.
He wald not stay bot stoutly tulk on hand,
Richt vnabasitlie all that gait to gang.
Ourthrow their castellis and their gyantis dang,
Brocht that to misery maid ane myut to wrig us
He was ye Caleb sen he come a na^g us.
I da^ be bald to say this hundredth eir,
He was not slangear borne mair welcum heir.
^or plesit the Preichours halt sa weill as he,
On pure nor rich he never sparit his geir.
And give ane Suddart had been schot in we^^
He someit not to ga him self and se.
^uha with this country euld sa weill agrie.
To play the wise man quhen he was with Lordis
Syne help the putrauis as the cause recordis.
^ou reason wald that e return a bak,
We thank ow hartlie of the Godly ak.
Ze wrocht amang us for to saif our blude,
I ow beseik their sempill wersis tak.
With als good will as any man can make
Because e know my cunning to not good.
Ze man excuse my rural rymis rude,
God saif our King and send him lytill a do,
The Queen of Ingland and her Counsel t^.
FINIS. Quod Sempill.
