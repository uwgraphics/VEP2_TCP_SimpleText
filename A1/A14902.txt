TO THE TRVELY NOBLE VIRTUOUS AND HONORABLE, MY VERY, good Lord, Henry Lord
Winsor, Baron of Bradenham.
MY Lord, in the Coledge at Winchester, where I live, I have heard learned men
say, that some Philosophers have mistaken the soul of man for an Harmony: Let
the president of their error be a privilege for mine. I see not, if souls do
not partly consist of Music, how it should come to pass, that so noble a
spirit as yours, so perfectly tuned to so perpetual a Tenor of excellencies as
it is, should descend to the notice of a quality lying single in so low a
personage as my self. But in Music the Base part is no disgrace to the best
ears attendauncie. I confess my consience is untouched with any other arts,
and I hope, my confession is unsuspected, many of us Musicians think it as
much praise to be some what more then Musicians, as it is for gold to be some
what more than gold, and, if lack Cade were alive, yet some of us might live:
unless we should think, as the Artisans in the Universities in Poland, and
Germany think, that the Latin tongue comes by reflection. I hope your Lordship
will pardon this presumption of mine, the rather, because I know before
Nobility I am to deal sincearely; and this small faculty of mine, because it
is alone in me, and without the asistance of other more confident sciences, is
the more to be favored, and the rather to be received into your honors
protection, so shall I observe you with as humble and as true an heart, as he,
whose knowledge is as large as the worlds creation, and as earnestly pray for
you, to the worlds Creator.

Your honors in all humble service Thomas Weelkes.

I Do not doubt (most worthy Sir) but that, as well in a genarall opinion, as
in your own judicious and approved censure, it may be held for a part of
little wit and less manners, (upon so weak a ground, neither my self, nor my
poor deseruings being known unto you,) to present unto you these slender

grauer wisdom, I humbly beseech both your virtuous patience, and pardon

SESTO. MADRIGALS OF 6. parts, apt for the Viols and voices. Made and newly
published BY Thomas Weelkes of the Coledge at Winchester, Organist.

AT LONDON Printed by Thomas Este, the assign of Thomas Morley. 1600.

To the right noble minded, and most virtuous gentleman, Master George Brook
Esquier.
I Do not doubt (most worthy Sir) but that, as well in a genarall opinion, as
in your own judicious and approved censure, it may be held for a part of
little wit and less manners, (upon so weak a ground, neither my self, nor my
poor deseruings being known unto you,) to present unto you these slender
labors, as the fruits of my affected studies. But under the favor of your
grauer wisdom, I humbly beseech both your virtuous patience, and pardon
herein: for a general worlds report both of honor and your delight in this
kind, has so thoroughly possessed my well pleased ears, as has (forgetfully
of my poor self) enboldned my spirits, to make your only self, the true
judge, and patron of these my undeserving papers. Humbly craving herein, your
gracious acceptance, and in their little worth to nourish them, as beegotten
for, and to your only honorable self. Wherein, my hereafter times shall ever
bind me to acknowledge it in all due and reverent thankfulness, and in my
best wits, deserve it as I may. Ever resting, as best shall become me.
