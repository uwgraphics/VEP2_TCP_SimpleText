My son steven gardener with weeping tears
Has cut away the tops of mine ears
But the rest of my body abides hole still
Withalle my ceremonies even at my will
I trust mine ears shall grow again
When all the gospellers ar ones slain.
Which steven my son both sterct and stoue
Does now right ernestly go about
If he can bring this matter to pass
Be schal be Cardnal as fissher was
TO THE MOST VICTORIOVS AND TRIVMPHANT Prince, King Henry the eight, King of
England, France, and Irelande, Supreme Governor in earth, of these his realms
next under God, Vuillyam Wraghton, Vuisseth prosperity of both body and soul.
IT is not unknown unto your Princely Majesty that of late iasked you leave to
hu^t a certain romish fox / with in the bounds of your dominiones / which
had been hyd more the^ seven years / among the Bishopes of England / after
that your hyghenes had commanded them to drive him clearly out of all places
where as ye / have any pour ot or dominacion. And now am i crediblely informed
/ that ye have seen the course that i had at this forsayde fox yowre fo / with
many of your nobles and learned men / which i suppose will not denis but that
i have found out the fox / with my hou^des / in the self places where as i
rekened before my huntyng to find him / that is in the church a monge the
bisshoppes and prestes whom ye commanded straytly to drive him away / But as
soun as my hounds had found out the fox and held him at a bay / that he kould
nether go back nor furthe / ready to be taken if any man / would have laid
hands upon him / a certain sworn advocate of this best / a doctor of the
popis doctrine / drove mi hounds from the best / and rescued him and saved
his life bearyng me in hand that the beast was no fox / but on of your read
dear / even as i prophesied before that the foxy generation would call their
father the fox when soever that he should cum in any ieperdy of taking. This
foresaid proctour of the best calls him / not alon your read dear / but also
good order / good polytike laws / where with good has en closed all your
subjects under your autorite alone / the pale of the English church / with
diverse such other goodly names. How beit at length / he gra^tethe him self /
that the best which i hunt is the romish fox in deed / but that it was
nether your mind nether any wise mannis mind / to drive out the hole fox /
but that it was thought sufficient if his ears were only cut of hard by the
roots all the rest of his body and especially his gorgious and fair tale /
remanyng untouched / And where as i dispraysed the best with diverse other /
he as it becummeth an advocate / prayseth him hyghly / sayng that thoghe in one
thing he has don amiss / that is where as he preferred him self above the lion
which is king of all bestes / yet that in all other things he is good good
good and commendable / and that if he were driven away with all his ordinances
/ that all semelynes / all relygious and devout behauore and all godlynes should
bedryuen a wey also / what is this ellis but to make agod of the fox? This
forsayde patron of the fox was one of them whom i accused in my former course
/ for a couerer and a manteyner of the romish fox and his whelps / But now
(by what means it is cum to pass i can not tell) he is cummed from a defendent
and a person accusede to be an accuser / an examiner and a judge / over the
matter which is in controversy between him and me. I lay unto his charge that
he is the ma^tener of the fox / which i prove both with scripture and
natural reason / and he being accused him self / examineth my witnesses / and
refuses them all together at his pleasure / and callethe me heretic and
iudgely pronuncieth that i am an heretic / but with out any witness or reason at
all. I beseech your learned hyghenes to consydre whether this matter be in
differently handlede or no / that on man openly accused of a great offense /
shallbe both defendent examiner judge and accuser all ate one time. Is it any
meruel if the thief escape ha^gynge which is suffered to be his own examiner
and judge (If that lucifer the great deuel might have such liberti / to do
what he list to accuse whon he would / and then to be both his own witness and
judge / woe should cum to all goodmen and he should never be condemned his self
which were great pytie. Where fore i beseech your hyghnes / as this matter that
is between us / is no small matter / to appoynte sum indifferent learned men /
sum of the Clergy / and other sum of the laite / to examine freely with out
ieperdy of their lives / this matter which is between use / and not to suffer
my adversary both to be my accuser and examiner / and his judge and mine both
together all at one time. This ones brought to pass and license once granted
again to hunt the rauenyng fox / which i dowt not but that ye will grant me for
the love that ye have to the liberty of your loving subjects / i trust that
we shall not need here af ter to hunt the fox any more / his ayders and
manteyners and he shall be so manifestly and openly known / who and where they
be. This that i go about shall not ouly minish the murder of the cruel fox /
and purches spiritual liberti unto many agood man / but also shall turn to the
great honor and good name of all the hole realm / which in many cuntrees is
sore sflandered for to be au upholder of the best that we pretended to banniss
he away / They that sit ot home and have not been in far cuntrees / cannot tell
what report goethe abroad in other lands of our nation / But they which ar
and have been in strange lands / ar comppelled sumtymes to hear it that they
would not hear uery gladly / of our cuntre for holdyng of such doctrine and
ordinances as all the world knowethe to be of the bishop of romes making cand
contrary to the holy word of God. Who grante you health of both body and soul
/ uictori over your enemies and grace to do in this our matter of religion as
shall be most to the / glory of God and the profit of the comun welthe /

Amen.
THE RESCVER OF THE ROMISH FOX AND his whelps, against the hunter and his
hounds.
THe examination of a proud praesumptuous hunter / who under a crafty praetence
of huntyng the romish fox / breakethe the pale of the enclosed park / and with
his rasheand knauishe hounds entendethe to destroy the dear of the same.

The Hunter All Good and indifferent men which have seen my hunting can bear
me record that the intent and purpose of it was to find out the romish fox /
and to prove that he was still abiding in England / and that ye master
gardinere with your companiones did manteyn and hold him still in the realm /
contrari to the kyngis commandament / which appointed you to drive him clerly
out of all places of his dominion. And you also yowr self in this your
examination grant that it is the bishop of romis doctrine that i write against
but that it is not there for tobe cast away / becawse he has tawght and
ordened it. There fore i hunt the fox in deed and not praetende to hunt him as
ye say. But how chances this / that you / whom with your other felows i have
in my huntyng accused of idolatri / of heresi and mantenance of the fox / the
kyngis enemi / that in the stead of an answerer / ye ar now becumed my examiner
/ and judge / and your own judge also? It is far against all reason that ye
which have long been my open enemi / and ar my adversary in this cause shall
be now allowed to be an examiner and a judge of me and mi accusation / whether i
accuse you sufficiently orno / seeing that hatrede blyndeth all examiners and
judges. It is as far wide from all right that ye shall be allowed to be an
examiner and a judge upon the accusation made against your self / seeing that as
Plato sayethe / no man canbe an equal and indifferent judge of him self / for
eueryman is blind in that thing which he louethe / Therefore it were more
semyng that ye should leave of your examination / and answer to your accusation
/ Ye resemble miche in manners your holy father pope july the secund / which
after that he was deed and deposed from his popedom / (as it is written of him
(commanded saint peter so imperiously to let him in at heaven gates / as he had
wont to co^mande his servants when he was alive / euerdremyng of his old state
as thoge he hadbene a lordely pope still / so ye master gerdiner / the comune
examiner of all them that are accused for breakyng the traditiones ordened by
your popish fathers / whether the transgression be don in your diocese or your
brother bonors (which would be better but for you) when it is at the last ones
cu^mede to your course to he accused of heresi and idolatri your oun self / ye
dream still that ye ar an examiner / as ye had wont to be / as Julius dre med
still thatt he was pope / If this be not so it is lykely that of a set purpose
ye will not seem to be accused of heresi and idolatri and of the mantenance of
the fox / lest any other beside me should arise here after and accuse you of
the forsayde crimes as i do / and then the accusationes of ij should be allowed
/ or at the least should betaken for a common report / and then it shuldbe hard
for you / with all the hally watter that ye made these seven years / to purge
pour self from the fame of a popish heretic / as ye can not even at this
hour with all the learning and law that ye have clear your self from the
thing it self which makethe a popish heretic / Therefore for fear ye should
be accused here after of papistri heresi and Idolatri and that my accusation
should nether be taken for a witness nor an increase of the common fame that ye be
a popish heretik / ye make your self an examinet / dissemblyng that ye ar
accused / of the crimes above rehearsed / Where as ye call me a proud
presumptuous hunter / he that knew both you and me and ower lyuynges and saw
your mule / your iely styropis your gentle men going before you in their
ueluet cotes / your daly apparel and mine your castyng of your nose in the
wind ly ke as a storke does in her nest / would say (or ellis i am deceived)
that i had good occasion to say / hypocrite or disguised player pull first
surthe the beam of thy own ey and then take own the mote of mine. Wherefore am
i proud? my hounds have no ueluet colars / my nets are not of silk / I can
not gess whi that i should be called proud except it be for huntyng of the
proud fox your father which makethe emperoures and kings kys his fet / and
you which have so many proud ueluet cotes going be fore you every day. What
mean ye by your sayng that i break the pale of the enclosed park? What mean
ye by the pale / and what is this park? So far as i can spy / ye mean by the
park / the Church of england / and by the pale / the unprofitable and
letworde ceremonies which were ones thurst in to the church by the Bishop of
rome Telme for what intent have you and your fathers made this pale of youres /
for the church of england / to hold in / or to hold out sumthyng that should
not cu^ in? If ye have made your traditional / and ceremonial / pale to keep
the dear within it that they may not go furthe to get them selves sum good meat
abroad / when as ye either gyne them non but contagious meat / or lok up their
good meat from them (as ye did of late when ye took the word of God from /
them and commanded them in pain of death to eat your stolen bread that is to
keep your traditiones) ye do the thing your self which ye lay falsely un to
my charge / that is ye kill sum of the kyngis dear with poy so ned meat and
other sum with hungre. If your pompons pale be made to hold out / ye have
welobteyned your purpose / for wiche your ceremonies and mannis inuentiones /
which ye grant that the pope has made / ye hold out the word of god which
should only be the meat of all the dear of this park / and the true preachers
of the same / for hally water must be coniured / and cast about / then it must
be expounded what it me anethe / legendes / sequences secrets colates ante mes
litanies and dirges for the deed must either be said or song / the cross must be
crepto an kissed ashes and hally bread must be taken / palms and candelles
must be borne / these ceremonies must have their time to be don and expounded in
which time / the word of god might be red and expounded / but if either of
both must be left undon the word of god must be left of / for the ceremonies
ar rekened to be goddis service as the word of god is not rekened / How many
preachynges ar on Christen mes day nay it is to dear a day or to hye a feste to
preach on it / and the holy ceremonies may not be left of for the prechyng. I
heard ones an indifferently well learned divine say on a Christen messday / a
short sermon wolddo well to day / as a long sermon were not alowable / for
hyndering of the ceremonies which ye call god dis service / If a preacher cum
from oxford or cambridge / freely to preach the word of god to the people / and
require to be heard / the priest uses to gyne this ansiuere to the preacher /
if he smell any thing of the new learning / we must this day read the six
articles other wise called gardiners gospel / and so the preacher goethe away /
Therefore your traditional pale holds out in deed. If that ye say that your
pale hold the out here tikes / the contrari is true / for loykyn of an werp
that arche heretic / the spoylers / and the dauidianes with all other such
sects with all their folowers keep all the ceremonies that are kept in England
and mo to / and allow them as decent rites / and yet for all that this pale of
your ceremonies cannot hold out / damnable and detestable heresies and
heretices out of those parkes where of they are the pales / This pale of youris
after my judgment is not the pale of our english church / or at least should
not be / but it is the pale of the poe pis pyn fold / where in / ye and your
fellows set all them against their wills / which have against your minds /
tastede of the corn of goddis unmingled word / your pale may be called the
pale of the popis gardin / where of bishop steue^ ye ar gardener / and there
in ye compel all men to work and to eat of your popish wedes in pain of
death / The pale of all the read dear of christis hyrde / is the word of god /
which will hold all that argood / with in their bounds / if they will not kep
them with in there bounds the chief keeper wereth not a wodknyfe in vayn / To
break this pale were plain felony / but to break your popish pale and to set
it all in a fire in my mind were a deed of charity no less the^ the deed of
Ezechias / which brake the brazen serpent / for he that should break / your pale
/ should deliver many a pore prisoner pituously pyned with in your popish
pynfold. And where ye say that i intend to destroy the dear of the park that
is the kings subjects / it is not true for i intend only to hunt out the fox
and to find out his fautors and manteyners / If ye feel your self in ieperdy
of your life by my huntyng / then ar you either the fox or on of his manteyners
/ for their ar no other in ieperdy by my huntyng.


The rescuer Sith it has pleased allmyghty God / author of unite to raduce
this realm to perfect accord and agreement in the truth / and by good
polytike laws / has under the ouly autorite of the kyngis maiesti enclosed /
and as is were imparted / the derebeloued subjects for their sauegarde / with
in the forche and streynghe of the same / how much is it to be lamented / to se
arrogance in the eyes of the said subjects / as with breach and uiolacion of
the said laws / to make a tumult and a clamor / under pretense of hunting the
fox that is all ready driven out / thereby to move and troble the hearts of the
good people / and to corrupt such other as be easy for their simplicite to be
seduced.


The hunter To thank allmyghty god for all his benefittes which he has sent
us / and to knowledge that they came from him / when we have the benesittes / it
is i grant well don / and thankefully / but if thersites the fowlest of xv
thowsande and mo / should thank God for his beateous and well favored face /
should he not trifle? Even so do ye to thank God for it that ye have not / that
is for accord and agreement in the truth / when as the third part of the
realm dissentethe from the other ij parts in the cause of religion / There are
x thowsande and mo honest men in england which in their consciences dissent
from you / and hate with all their hearts your falls doctrine / which ye so
ernestly with word and writing do defend / There are bisshoppes in inglond
and many honorable men of the te^peralti which dissent from you and all the^
that uphold the popish doctrine that ye defend / There is not a citi nor a
great town in all england where in are not many that dissent from you in
doctrine and would openly speak against you if they durst / your servants of
late would have the pope head os te church / the bishop of ca^torberies
servants will have the king supreme head in his oun realm / is not here /
good agreement? The most part / of all the learned men both of oxforde and
cambrydge which have been brougth up in the bosum of the holy scriptur / would
be delyuerde gladly of the unberable burden of servile ceremonies / where with
they are both hyndered, from their study and the laymen ar hyndered from
hearing of the word of god / The more then most part of unlearned
mattenmu^blynge sacrifieers which can do nothing ellis but / play in
ceremonies and / cast hallywater with all them have takem any degree in the
canon law / save a uery few (truly i know non) would have the popis cere moties
to continue still and yet ye say that their is so good agreement in the truth /
The cok and the fox ar enemies on against an other / the fox lo uethe not the
cok / be like because he with his crowyng / bewrayethe the fox when he would on
the night cum to worry hens / Then when all the cokkes ar deed / or ellis put
to silence / the fox rekeneth that he has good peace that he may worry hens
and chikkinges and do what so ever he list / noman speaking on word against
him Go ye ij footed foxes after that ye have killed iij well crowyng cokkes at
a cast for crowyng only a gaynst yowr doctrine / and have pulled all the
feathers of ij cokkes of kind / and have put them to silence / and have brought
the matter so to pass that nether cok nor he^ nor chikking for fear of their ly
ues dare speak one word against your deuelish doctrine / and that no man may
examine your doctrine whether it be argeyng with the word of god or no / ye
reken that the yr is good agreament and peace of opiniones / in the realm /
There is i grante great accord and agreement among you traditionerres / and
that non of you dissenteth from an other / in popistri / but how can ye agree to
gether in the truth which persecute the truth and forbid it to be red /
lest by redyng of it men might spy out your noughty lyvyng and deuelish
doctrine? The scripture is as it were the light of the day the preachres ar as
cokkes and wate cheme^ / thieves and murderers hate both / therefore have ye
forbydde^ the scripture / to be red openly in the chir che / and put preachres
to silence or kill them that be wray your ungodliness / What agreement is this in
the truth? Where ye say that god has inclo sed thekyngis derebeloued
subjects only under the autorite of his majesty / by good polytike laws /
what mea^e ye by these laws? mean ye god dis polytike laws or man^is polytike
laws? By these polytike laws ye cannot understande the law of moses / nether
the law of the gospel / for ye mean of such laws as ye accuse me here after
to be a transgressor and a breaker of / in the huntyng of the fox / in these
words / with uiolatione of the said laws / to make a tumult under the pre
tence of huntyng the fox / but in my huntyng of the fox i wrote only against
those ceremonies and traditiones which ye cannot deni but the bishop of rome
has made / therefore ye mean by your politic laws of whose transgression ye
accuse me / nether the laws of the new testament nor the old / but the
ceremonies and traditiones / which the bishop of rome has ordened. If that
i had written in my huntyng against the laws of moses / or the gospel / ye
might have found out sum excuse for your self / but now seeing that i wrote only
against the popis ceremonies / i gather of you this / that ye say that god
has enclosed and as it were inparked / the kyngis dear beloved subject es /
under the authorite of the kyngis maiesti alone / by the ceremonies and
traditio^es which ye grant that the pope has ordened / for other polytike
laws can ye not mean of in this place / I believe that all the subjects of
all kings and emperourers ar enclosed under their autoxite alon / by the
everlasting word of good / and not by any corruptible polytike law of man /
for as man is corruptible so is all that he makethe / then if the kyngis
subjects be enclosed under his autorite by ma^nis polytike laws / when these
laws is broken (as he that maked a law may break the same again) the kings
subjects ar no longer under his auto rite / whereby ye give me^ occasion to
gather of you that yemea^e that the king is supreme guerner of all his
suciectes and all his / ar under his autorite alon / by the popis cere^onies
and traditiones / Is not this a suer ground that ye byld the kings supremeci
upon? Has not the king autorite e^oghe of the scripture for to ma^teyn
hyssupremeci with all but that he must be fayn to fet sum of the popis
ceremonies to help the scripture which were not able to do it alo^e? What a
crasty for is this to say that ceremonies enclose the kings subjects under
his autorite alone / for that intent that the kyngis hyghnes seeing that his
supre^icie were fortified with ceremonies / should be the redier to fortifi the^
again / Mark also a^ other subtlety of the fox / where as in my former
hu^tyng i made such arguments against the popis ceremo^ies and traditi ones
as he could not solute / now because he seeing that he cannot defend the pope
under the name of ceremonies and traditio^es / now calls him good polytike
laws where with the kyngis subjects ar enclosed under his autorite alo^ / and
after this marvelous tra^sformatio^ / he makethe the popis ceremonies the
kyngis polytike laws / Marck also how that he would makethe pope the kyngis
friend whi lsi he makeththe popis ceremo^ies ma^teyners of the kyngis supremeci
/ for when as the pop and his doctrine ar al on / if the popis ceremonies
ma^teyn the kyngis supremeci / the pope does the same / Is not the kyngis
hyghnes myche bound to master gardener for purchessyng him such a friend? Now
sir tell me / if ye ca^ / which of these polytike laws that i have written
against have enclosed the kyngis subjects under his autorite? If that there be
no polytike laws which i have written against that incloseth the kyngis
subjects under his autorite alon (as iam suere ye can show non that i wrote
against) then must ye be taken as ye have been many a day / for an impudent and
an vnshamefaced liar Because ye say that i break good polytike laws / and
therwithe make a tumult and a clamor / let me know i pray you which good
polytike laws i have broken and i shall knoledge my offense and take the
ponishement worthy for such an offense / I wrote against a sort of popish
ceremonies / and ungodly tradiciones / but that i remember i never in all my
book wrote against one polytike law / A polytike law is an ordinance devised
by wise men for the profit of a city or a cuntre / or a common wealth / Such
ordinances did not i ones touch in my book / let them be judges which have red
the book / And that this manis lying may be more manyfeste i will shorthy per
use and go through all the traditiones which i have either made mention of or
spoken against in my book / What polytike law is it to command all the people of
a realm / to knele before a piece of molten or casten silver to crepe to it /
and to kiss it / and to sing Crucem tuam adoramus Domine, lord we worship thy
cross? What polyci is it to go so ernestly about to drive the deuel out of
acorn or ij of salt which noman eatethe / and to conjure the deuel out of the
hally water fat where noman saylethe and to suffer him to be still / in the
great heaps of salt where with mennis meat / is seasoned / and to let him tarry
still un coniured in the great ryuers / and broad se / and in the alefattes? It
were a more polytike law to send these coniuiurers to the salt pannes and to the
broad se where into we are suer that the deuel ran ones with the swyne of the
gergesenes / then to make such a besynes a bout a little water and salt / which
must both be cast way al to gether and never cummeth in any mannis belly. What
polycye is it to desire of god to give a new virtue uuto salt to hele burning
agues / and to water to hele cold dropsies and other cold diseases? What
polytike law is it to orden that chirches shall be consecrated for the
sacraments and for goddis word and then a non after to make a place of them
to read polytike laws in and all deuelysh doctrine that antichriste ca^
devise? What polici is it to rrcey ue the sacrament of Christis body and blood
which was ordened to be reuyued in the remnmbra^ce of Christ's passion / to
take it for sik horse / and in the remembrance of dedeme^? What polytike
ordinance is it to sing dirge either to bring damned sowles out of hell or ellis
to raise me^ from death tolyfe again? This is a praty polyci to deserve
remission of sins by the mixtur of both the parts of the Sacrament to
gether / What polytike law is this that the psalms which were ordened for the
maker and creator shall be song in the honor of the creatures? What polytike
laws ar these that ama^ may not as well prays god in lent in he brew as in latin
/ and that all the year through messes matines diriges euensongas shall be song
in a tongue that noman understands saving they that are learned? What polytike
laues ar these that the lay menshal have but the half of Christis supper / and
that the prestes shall have the hole Sacrament / and that the water of the font
shall be halloweyd / as thoge the element took away original sin / and to hold
styngkyng water half a year and more / and to put in the coldest day of all
winter a young tender infant in it / over both head and ears / where by many
childer ar lost and many cache such / diseases as they can not claw of as long
as they live again) Is it not a praty polytike law that thoghe a priest have
the french pox or the cankre that he must spit in the childs mouth / What
polytike law is it to ordeyn that a man may eat so mich fish at one mele as
would serve for ij and to call that fasting and to forbid to eat an ounce of
flesh and to suffer men to eat iiij pounds of the dayntiest fisshes that can
be found / and to suffer the most norisshyng fruits an strongest wynes that
can be gotten to be received? What good polytike law is it to command men to
believe that no priest nether any other man / can make an un advised uow after
xxj. years of their age? What polytike law is it to lok up marriages from
prestes all their life time / and from all laymen also for the hole half
year? save six wekes / and to set the stews open all the hole year no day
that i her tell of except? If any man thynk that this is not true red it that
is written of this matter in your common man^ual in these words / Traditio uxorum,
and nuptiarum solennitas certis temporibus fieri prohibentur, uidelicet ah
Aduentu Domini usque ad octauas Epiphaniae. six wekes and six days ar between
/ Et a Septuagesima usque ad octauas paschae, x. wekes / Et a Dominica ante
Ascensionem Domini usque ad Octauas Pentecostes, iiij wekes. Now put to these
the frydayes embryng days and Apostellis euens / and ye shall find that the
hole half year is lokked up from marriage save vj. wekes. What polytike laws is
it to command the priest tosyng saint Mary's merits bring us un to the heavenly
kingdom / and to desire god that Petronilla and diverse other saints should do
the same? What polytik laws ar these to orden that myndeles pypes shall play
that Christen men should sing / and say / with their hearts? to make altares for
sacrifices when all sacrifices ar all ready sufficiently offered up that are
necessari for our salvation / and god requirethe of use no other sacrifices but
the sacrice of our own bodies and of our prayers? What polytike laws is the
popis canon law which makes Antichriste under head of the hole Catholic
church which is Christis spouse / above all emperouers and kings and all
other lauful polytike gouerners? Now have i rehearsed all the matters of religion
/ which i either wrote against in my huntyng or reersed to be of the popis
making / which of all the ceremonies and traditiones that i have rekened here
has enclosed the kyngis subjects under his autorite / alon? Which of all
these that i have written against ar either good civil or polytike laws? Not one
/ where fore your lordship lies ones again where re yesay that i make a tumult
with the uiolation of good and polytike laws. If they be polytike laws /
what do they in the church? for their is no place for them but for the word
of god alone / ne there were the chirch bare if all your polytike laws were in
the popis bellies from whence they ca^e / for where Christis church is richely
replenisshed with Goddis word / there can no man justly complain that the
church is naked and bare as ye canonistes mean it should be if your fathers
traditiones were casten all out of the church with your father / And if ye
would say that your polytike laws manteyn and fortifi goddis word beside that
i have proved agreat sort of them clearly contrari unto goddis word / and the
rest hynderance unto the preaching of it / i say that the word of god / which
came in to the world / all polytike brains as yours ar / laboryng all that they
cold / to hold it out / both with laws and diverse kinds of dethes nedethe
no polytike laws to manteyn it / for as all things that live ar norisshede
with the same where of they be made / as the wise man sayethe / so the laws
which ar of god and cum from him / ar only norished / and man teyned by
allmyghty god / and receive no norishement / nether substance of any manis
ordinance / Then do princes manteyn gods word as Micheas heth in them when
they se that it is diligently and syncerely preached / which thing when they
do / it has no need / master gardener / of your fathers traditiones and
yowris / to manteyn it and to further it. Where as ye say that i make a tumult
and a clamore and seduce the people / this sklander suffer i common with the
prophets with Christ and his apostelles and all other good men which ever
at any time assayd to destroy / and drive away / old and long roted idolatri
/ or any other deuelishe doctrine. Even so do ye now unto me as the masters of
a certain maid which had in her an euel sperit / did unto Paul / This made
which had this spirit in her / brought no small advantage unto her masters by
prophecyinge / and when Paul came by with his companiones / she followed them
and cried and said these men ar the servants of the highest god / which show you
the way of health / an thus did she many days / but Paul not abydyng that /
turned him and said unto the spiret i command the by the name of Jesus Christ
to go out of her / and in the self hour he went out / but her masters seeing
that the hope of their advantage was gone / took Paul and Silas an brought them
to the court or lawhouse to the ruelers / and they delivered them up to the
officers sayng these men troble our citi / and yet ar they jews and teach
ordinances that we which ar romans ought not to receive and keep / and then
was the appostelles bet and scorged / The bishop of romis canon law with his
deuelyshe ceremonies entered into the church of England and brought no small
advantage unto the pope the master of this doctrine and to his childer / of the
same law and traditiones / all ye that have in England the bishop of romis
mark in yowr crowns receyne miche profit and advantage / and thoghe i know
that your father the pope in his ceremonies and canon law aloweth with his
voice Christis doctrine / yet seeing that i know that he does that for that
intent that / he may tarry still in the church and be undryuen out to flatter
preachers with all / and to purches credence unte his (...) ^octrine / i thynck
that for all his namyng (...) Jesus and flatteryng of the Apostelles / that his
hole heap of Traditiones is to be castenn out / And as the romans appeched
paul and his companiones of a tumult and of trublynge their city / because
they saw that their vantage was lost when the spirit was cast out / so ye
fautors of the romish doctrine feryng that your pom^^s state should be
minisshed if the popis traditio^es / should be driven out with the pope / ye
accuse me of a tumult and a clamore / because i would have the bishop of romis
doctrine which is a falls sprete of propheci / e^tred in to the church / cast
clerly all together out of the church / And whether i have been accused by you
and youres / to the rulers and have been ponisshed openly or no / my
tormentoures which ar yet a live / can testi fi / and if i were at this hour
with in your reche / i should not escape so lightly as paul and silas did / If
ye say unto me as Ahab said unto Ely the prophet / art thou he that troblethe
all England? i answe you as Eli answered Ahab / I troble not England butthow
and thy fathers house / betause ye have left the commandementes of god and thou
go after baal / This is no new thing then that false prophets and
maeteyners of idolatri / do call them that labor to drive idolatri away /
troblers and seducers of the common welthe / Now is it time to cum unto that
point where yesay that the fox is driven out all ready / If he be driven out
all ready ye grant that he was once amnoge you / Then if ye durst answer me
directly to my question i would ax you whether the fox which ye have driven out
all ready was the bishop of romis body or his dodoctrine / if ye say that he
was the bishop of romis doctrine / ye make a lie against your self for ye say
that his doctrine is good and worthy to beholden and that only so miche of his
doctrine is to be rejected as was worthily to ma^teyn his autorite to be reject
/ and all his doctrine was not to manteyn his autorite / then was not all his
docrine after yowr mind worthy to be reject / and that which ye reken good
that hold ye still / Then i will reason with you thus / the popis doctrine and
the pope ar all one / but ye hold all the popis doctrine still saving the
supremeci / and ij or iij trifles mo er go ye hold still the hole pope saving
his supremaci and ij or iij trifles that ye have taken from him. If that a duke
commanded his hunt to kyl a certain fox in a wod which had killed many of his
fyghtyng cokkes / and other pullen / if the hunt should only cut of the foxes
ears / and clip of his nails and so let him go / were this fox killed / had
this hunt kept his masters com^ande meant? no. And whi? for his masters mind
was that he should fill no mo cokkes. Then who will say that ye have killed or
driven away the romish fox / which have only pared of his supremite / and
hold all the rest of the fox still / and call them heretics which only
barked at such ordinances as ye grant your self ar of the foxes making? ye
grant your self that the popis doctrine contrari to the scripture is the pope /
and such have i proved in my former book that ye hold still / then is it not
true that ye say that the fox is driven away all ready / The fox / say ye / is
all ready driven out / and so sayethe the fox him self. But x. thousand enemies
of the fox / sayethe that he is not driven out and i which was thrice bitten
in England with the fox sense that time / that ye said he was driven out /
say / that he is not driven out / whether shall more credence master gardener
begyuen unto me and to x. thousand mo or to your father the fox and to you in
whose hows of late a young fox or ij was found as ye camot your self de ni?
The properti of a fox is to be wylye and crafty / and when he is in ieperdi of
death / to fayn him self deed all ready / that so he may escape / as it cha^ced
o^ce in the north cuntre / A certain four foted fox / lept in at a wyndow in to
a hows in the cuntre whose walls was deper with in then with out / and when he
was ones in / he worried all the wives hennis and cokkes of the house / the
good wife in the morning betyme spying her hens and chikkinges all worried /
looked a bout her and spyed the fox and all to knokked him on the pate with a
knoke / till he gaped and lay down as deed / the wife trayled him out to the
myddyng / for deed where to came all the neybores and childern of the street to
wonder at the fox / but after that the old folck was gone / none standing about
him but childern / the fox took him to his fete and ran away to the wod / and
killed hens afteras he did before. So the ij foted fox your father for a
pretense can say that he is driven out of England all ready / for fear that men
should go more cruestly a bout to drive hyme out in deed / when as he lurketh
still in your house and such other canonistes houses / where as he gitteth
commonly a litter or ij of young fox whelps every year / Therefore where as ye
say that he is all ready dryue^ out / ye do that / but to save him / as a
covetous and theuishe old wife said to a warryner for the saving of her cat
This cat was a conny worryer and did myche harm in the warren / the warriner
catched the cat at last / and hanged her up with polecattes and other murderers
of conyes / as the cat was in ha^gyng her mastres which had eaten many a good
rabbet of the cattes catchyng / and fayn would have eaten mo / said to the
warriner / sir this cat i warrant you is well enoghe hanged / i pray you give
me her that i may make me a stomingere of her skin / the cat lept still and the
wife ever said she is deed inoghe / when the cat stirred no mor the wife
knowing that a cat was a best that (...) not shortlly dye / axed the cat ones
again / and bare the warriner in hand that she was thoroughly deed / Was it not
like but that this wife hoped that she should have hyrcat alive again if the
warriner had do^ no more to the cat after that she had axed her? even so ye say
that the fox is al ready driven away / that noman should go any more about to
drive him out in deed / for ye know that if the romish fox be no more killed
in England then he is killed yet / that he may well arise up again and do as he
had wont to do in England in times paste / Seeing ye say that he is driven out
all ready at what time was he driven out / or he was not driven out at all / as
far as i can gather in yowr book ye mean that then was he driven out or ellis
never / when he was first no more suffered to be called supreme head of the
church in England / But after that time i will prove you / that he was in
England / there fore is he not driven out at all / There was certain young foxes
found in England certain in in your house / and certain in other bisshoppes
howses / whom / we call papists / of which sum ran away / and sum was taken
and would not deny their father till they dyede / In that hole where as young
foxes ar found whelped and brought up must there nedis a fox be or lately have
been / but in your hows and in other of your fellows howses sense the popis
supremeci was taken from him / was found certain young foxes whelped and brought
up / it follows therefore that sense the time that the popes supremecie was
taken from him that the pope was in England and gat childer in your fellows
howses / If ye answer that the foxes whelps were gotten in England before that
time / how happens that ye have such a ^ely nose to smell out an heretic if
he be a great way from you / and yet cannot smell out a papist which is in
company with you more then seueu years? ye stop be like the one side of your
nose / because ye will smell non / or because the savor of a papist is so
natural and pleasant unto you that it greuethe you not / and therefore complayn
not to any man of that smell / as men only use to complayn of such smelles as
pleas them not / How happens it that if these whelps were gotten so long a go
that they were all found in those bisshoppes howses which ar* manteyners of
ceremonies and mannis traditiones and not in the bisshoppes howses which set
no store by your fathers ceremonies and ar called fouorers of the new learning?
It is easy to know the cawse for as birds of on kind and color flok and fly
always together / so the papists will ever be to gether / that on may ever
help another / not only with number as sterlynges do when they are aferde of the
hauk / but also to consult and take counsel together how their sect might be
best promoted manteyned and set forward / I dowt not but their ar sum noble men
in England which will reason thus with you one day / in this bisshopis hows
which is a manteyner of mannis traditiones / was found one nest of papists
and in that bisshopis house which is a manteyner of man^is rraditiones was
found an other nest of papists and so with the third bisthop and sic de sin
gulis, and so with all the test of them that are man teyners of ceremonies /
ergo all the bisshopes how ses of England which ar manteyners with gardener of
mannis traditiones ar nestes of papists and their swarms of ceremonies / ar
the fox holes and couers where in the young foxes bread and the old hyde them in
tyla better time cum If that ye answer master gardener / that ye bewrayed your
seruanres as soun as ye knew that they were papists / i reken that for that
cause ye bewrayed them that a beuer biteth of his stones as sum write / or ellis
for the same cause that on tom story steelgate bewrayed his sons at the
sessioues in neuwcastel / Tom story was a strong thief and had iiij tall
fellows to his sons which was as well learned in theuery as he was / tome
heard tell that he was complained / of and therefore hasted out of the town /
but as he was going forth he met suddenly with the sherif and therefore he
fearyng that he should be taken him self said unto the sherif master sherif / if
ye would fayn take thieves lay hands on sum of my son^es for by my sawl they are
falls thieves and i cannot do with all / the hang man's will not be rueled by me
/ Eue^ so ye which teach your servants all the tym that they are with you so
diligently ceremonies and mannis traditiones which ar the uery seeds of
popistris and make then with your example hate all them that hate papistrye /
when ye ar complaynid of and accused of papistri your selves then for the
sauegard of your selves offer up your servants / and when ye ar blamed for
holdyng such in your howses and that ye have not taght them better / ye say ye
cannot do with all / But i meruel though men wink and ouerse your doings if god
ponish you not on day for bryngyng up your servants so ungodly and popishely /
as he ponisshed ely the priest for the slak lokyng to the amendment of his
sonis manners / I reken uerely that if that excellent young man germane gardener
had been brought up in the bishop of cantorberries house as he was in youris /
that he should never have been a papist / and comne to that death that he came to
/ There fore let all men take heed how they put their chylder to scool to you /
lest they learn of you the lesson in your house that germane did / and make
the same end that he made / you say that the for is all ready driven out and i
say that he is in England still / let us nuw se how well ye can prove that he
is driven out all ready / his deuelysh doctrine remanyng still and by you and
youres so manfully manteyned.


The rescner But thus strangely the deuel sets furthe his malice / and
hunteth sumtyme roryng like alyon to devour the good / sometime sleyghtly like
the fox / whom he pretends to chase away / And seeing it has pleased the
kyngis maiesti / this hunter may be examined / and for want of the presence of
theman / to consydre the chief points and matters of the book / i trust so in
differently to handle the examination / as what so ever name the man has he
may appear to you / of such sort as his book well examined / does plainly
declare / the man calls him self wraghton / and pretending in the beginning
of his book to write such matter as he would have cum to the kyngis majesty's
knowledge / he can not be content to attributto that style to his maiesti where
with the hole realm has trewly agreede his hygnes should be honored / to be
supreme head of the church of England and irelande / This can have no pretense
of ignorance and simplicite / but it is a plain declaration of pride and
arroganci. In his preface to the kyngis maiesti / he confessethe his ignorance
of huntyng whereby he beleuethe to have the more learning which of what sort
it is shall after apere.


The hunter Where as ye call me proud and arrogant / because i call not the
king our master the supreme head of the church of England and irlande which i
owght to have don because the hole realm has given it unto him / ye declare
your self more to be a blood sekyng and aflatteryng canoniste the^ a learned
divine / for a learned divine would have reproved my fact if it had been
unlawful / by and by with a text or ij of the scripture and / not have cited
the multitude for autorite / as old wives do for lak of scripture / when they
would ma^teyn any old superstition which has been long used of many / If the
king be therefore lawfully head of the church of England and ire land /
because the hole realm has agreed there to / the^ when all the hole realm
consented that the pope should be called the head of the church of England he
was lawfully called the head of the church of england / If it be a good
argument to say the hole realm do the it ergo it must nedis be true. A little
before ye have bylded the kyngis supremeci upon the popis traditiones / and
here ye bylde it upon a multitud of me^ / have ye no better fundacio^ for it /
the^ so^itrow it will ones break out that ye hold in so closly / But to the pur
pose again / when as supreme gouernoure in earth under god / betokens as
myche as supreme head does / and is as honorable a term for the maiesti of a
king as the other is / what need ye make so myche besynes a bout a word when
as i have given the king in the title that i gave him so myche honor as is
lawful to give unto any erthly man by the word of god / Where as i named him
supreme governor under god / i excluded both emperor and pope and all other
that might seem to have any hy autorite / or might derogate any thing from the
kyngis supremite. And be cause supreme governor seemed unto me a more honorable
title and more becomly for a king then to be called head of the church as
antichrist callethe him self / and certain wanton persons where as i have been
therefore call the kyngis hyghenes pope of England becaws ye give him the title
that the pope hade / i changed that term in to a better / and have taken the
occasion of mokkyng of our prince a way / But lest ye or any other / should
thynk that i should deny that the king is supreme head of the church of England
and irelonde / i hold as well as ye do that he is supreme head of the church
of England and ireland / if ye under stand by this word church an outward
gatheryng to gether of men and wymen / in a polytike order / But if ye take
this word church in the signification that it is taken in the xvj. of Matthew
/ and to the Ephesianes the first and fifth / and to the Colossianes the first
chapter / i deny that the king or any erthly man / may be called head of the
church save only Christ for the church that is spoken of in the xvj. of
Matthew of that nature that the gates of hell can not preuale against it then
he that must be the head of that church / must be such on as the gates of
hell cannot preuale / for the body and the head must be of one nature / but we are suere of no mo such but of Christ alone / therefore / ar we only suer that
Christ is the head of that church / The king our master has such autorite
given him of god as all other kings have and have had and nether more nor less
but nether the Emperor nor king herod in Christ's time was ghostly or
mystical head of the chirch but only polytike hedes of the church therefore /
our master is only politic head of the church of England and not mystical
and ghostly head of it / An euel prince and a uitious liver has as much
autorite given him of god as a good and a uertuous / and all a like / but every
uitious king is a membre of the deuel / and no membre of the deuel can be head
of Christ's mystical body which is the church / then can no prince be a
mystical or sprituall head of the church which is Chrystis mystical body /
But lest we should reason without a suer ground / hear what the scripture
sayethe of the head of the church / Paul unto the Ephesianes in the first
chapter writetht thus of Christ god has subdued all things under his fete
and has given him to be an head above all things / to his church which is
his body / So far Paul / then is the church Christis body / was king herod
the virgin Mary's mystical head / and spiritual head of the Apostelles and
of the rest of Christis church? or was the Emperor the spiritual head of
Christ's church in those days? if ye say nay / no more is any man in earth now
head of Christis mystical body which is the church Paul also to the
Ephesianes in the v. chapter sayethe / the husband is head over his wife as
Christ is head of the church but a good husband will have no mo hedes of his
wife / but himself alone / so no more will Christ have any mo hedes of his
mystical body and his spouse the church but him self nether is it nedeful to
have any spiritual / under head of this his mystical body for lak of his
presence for he has promised us that he will be with us unto the end of the
world / And as concerning spiritual matters Christ gave unto peter as myche
autorite as he gave unto any king or Emperor that either is or was or shall be
/ when he gave him the keys of the kingdom of heaven but he made not peter
nether any other of the Apostelles nether Chief head of the church / nether
under head of it / therefore ar nether Emperoures nor kings popes nor bisshopes
nether under nor over spiritual hedes of the church which is Christ's
mystical body / To conclud i hold that the king our master is the suprem
polytike head under god both of all the spiritualti / and also of the
temperalty of England and irelande and that there is nether spiritual nor
politic head in earth above him / nether bishop king nor emperor / If this
be not enoghe that i give unto the kyngis hyghnes tell me what more is to be
given by the scripture and i shall be glad to give him it.


The rescuer The man pretends to hunt the romish fox / and assigns ij
places specially one under the aultare / and another under the chalice where by
he declarethe where at he shoteth Albeit he would gladly dissemble it / yet he
cannot utterly hyde it he is angry with the aultare / and with the chalice /
and fares as miners do that intend to throw down there neyborres hows
prete^dyng to find an othar / ye may sown se wherefore he seeks that fyndeth
fault in the altar and chalice but let us hear the man speak / and examine
his resones whether there be any reason in the^. Thus he begins his huntyng ye
lordly bisshoppes etc.


The hunter Where ye say that i hunt the fox under the chalice / and thereby
mean that i hunt against the Sacrament / your lordship lyethe as ye had wont to
do / for i say not that the fox is under the chalice / but i say that i trust
that if the king find the fox under the chalice / that he will no more suffer
him to have sauctuarj there / then Solomon suffered ioab to have any sanctuarij
of the aultare / When i say thoghe steven gardener had brought up of his costs
/ all the lords children of England / yet i trust for all that / if he can be
proved a papist / that the king will ponish him as he has deserved / does it
now follow that i have said that ye have brought up all the lordis childer in
England? at your costs? i reken nay / So it follows not that i hunt the fox
under the chalice because i desire the king to let him have no refuge there.
Howbe it if the fox schuld crepe either in to / or under the chalice as he crept
in to the canon of the mess / from whence the king fet him out / and i should
hunt him out of the chalice or from in under the chalice it follows not that i
were angry with the chalice or intended any hurt to the Sacrament therefore /
ye do not say the truth where ye say that i hunt the fox under the chalice and
your meaning is as false where ye privily mean that intend to write against
the Sacrament / I sought the fox among you bisshoppes and prestes / and was he
not of late found in your secretari whereas he has been so long secretly
hyd? ye dissemble that i sought him among you / and yet the title of my book
testifies that i meant that he was among you / i sought the fox also in the
church and a bout the altar where as i thought that he was / and there i am
suere he is and has taken sanctuari and will their so long abide till Solomon
take him by uiolence away from the altar and ponish him acordyng to his
deservings.


The rescuer He askethe whether the kyngis maiesti bannisshed the popes name
his purseand his doctrine.


The hunter This bishop is no more ashamed to lie then a best is ashamede to
go barefot / for i said these words only that follow / hoo ye lordly bisshoppes
and ye clean fingred gentlemen of the clergy / is not the fox of rome otherwise
called papa among you? What was the pope that the king commanded you to drive
out of England? When as these were my words / ar ye not ashamede to say that i
ax the kyngis maiesti whether he has bannysshed the popis purse / name / and
doctrine? Ar ye lordelly bisshoppes and the cleene fingerede gentle men of the
clergy the kyngis maiesti? it apperethe plainly that ye mean so / or ellis ye
would not judge that to besayde unto the kyngis maiesti / what soever is said
unto you and to the rest of the clergy / let men that have leisure here of
gather more of your meaning. Moreover i axed not whether the kyngis maiesti
bannisshed / nether whether ye proud prelates bannisshed the popis name / purse
and doctrine / (for i knew well that the popis doctrine was still vnbannisshed
among you) but i axed of you foxes whelps / what was the pope that the king
commanded you to bannysh away / and where as i say / command to bannyshe / ye
make bannyshe alone / as to command to bannishe / and to ba^nishe followed by
and by from the master to the servant / If that your bannishe had been all one
with the kyngis command to ba^nishe / and the on had followed co^se que^tly of /
the other / we had had no need at this time to babble so much of that bestis
bamissheme^t.


The rescuer And by this distribution the man making him self an swear to each
membre and part deuyseth him self matter there upon to triumph / But if an
other should answer him / he would say that the kyngis maiesti bannisshed not the
bishop of rome / either for his name alone / for his purse alone or for his
doctrine alone / but for all to gether.


The hunter Here ye answer nothing to the purpos for the questione was not
whether the king had bannisshed the pope for his name purse or doctrine / but
it was whether the pope which the king commanded you to drive out of England
/ was the popis name or his doctrine or his purse / and ye make no answer to
that questione / but to the great dishonor of the king and of the hole realm
answer / that the king has bannisshed the pope for his purse / Is not this a
sweet hearing to hear on of the kyngis counsel to say that the king has
bannisshed the pope for his purse? And then ye say that he has bannisshed the
pope not for his purse alone but for his purse name and doctrine all together.


The rescuer And not for all to gether so as all to gether were naught but for
all to gether so far as he misusethe the^. And as touching his name so far as
it should signifi a superiorite / above all princes and challenge a dominion in
this realm / so far is the name of pope bannisshed / But else the god man pope
of trumpyngton may in England live quietly / for the name was never abhorred
but as it brought a wrong persuasione of the bishop of rome / by that name /
where as else the bishop of rome / men call him still with out danger / And as
concerning his purse as it was worthily expelled / so was it not because any
money might be taken of the spiritualti by their just superioures / but because
it might not be justly taken of him that was nether superior / nether yet did
any thing for it.


The hunter Se as the fox runnethe out and in as it were in a sophistri mase /
sum time bakward and sum time forward / that my hounds should not find him /
How beit i gather this of his sayng that the popis purse and his doctrine abide
still in England only so myche of them taken away as the pope has abused and
that the rest of the popis doctrine and his purse which gardener and his
fellows can occupy well / may lawfully tarry still in England /


The rescuer And as concerning such doctrine as was under him taught it was
never under stand of any good man that all that which was taught either by the
bishop of rome / or under his autorite / was his own doctrine / and to be cast
away / but only that which was worthily to manteyn his auctorite to be reject
with him.


The hunter The fox thoghe he be uery wyly in keeping of his own consel / yet
has he once uttered his meaning / and holdethe that only those doctrines of
the bishop of rome ought to be put away where with he manteyneth his
supremecie / for he sayethe only / which word excepteth all other / and
thereby hemeaneth that all other doctrines teach they never so myche idolatri /
superflition and deuelishnes / ought to continu in England still. Is not this
to cut of the foxes ears and to let him worrishe pe'still at his liberti? yis
i thynk so.


The rescuer And it which was good to be retained and kept / not because it
was his / but because it is good / Shall not we confess Christ the son of god
because the deuel said the same?


The hunter To answer shorthy to all this superfluous bablyng of this bishop
in my huntyng i did not say that all these doctrines that were taught under the
bishop of rome were naught / but this was my argument. The popis doctrine / is
the pope / and ye hold still the popis doctrine ergo ye hold still the pope. If
that the pope or any of his taught the word of god / that was not his doctrine
/ but the doctrine of god / which is eiher contained in the new Testament or
in the old / and against such doctrine have i not spoken / nether would i
such to be castaway / thoghi he and his had taught it / but such doctrine would
i only to be driven a way with the pope as the pope has ordened only and not
Christ / and is either plain manifest contrary to the written word of god or
ellis uayn / idle superfluous and hynderance to the prechyng of goddis undouted
word / Now babble on as long as ye lest.


The rescuer Finally the bishop of rome was expelled nether fox his name only
his purs only / ne his doctrine only but for all to gether / so far as each of
them exceded from the treuthe which is only minded / all noughty doctrine is
expelled with the bishop of rome / and not because it was his but because it
was naught / It were pity that euel men should have such a stroke in things of
the world / and much less of god / that what good thing one meddled with /
should be called by and by naught / King richard the third / au usurper in
this realm / brak the trust committed unto him / by his brother / concerning
the preservation of his childer / And yet caused an act of the parliament after
to be made in his time / that feoffes of trust should do acordyng to their trust
/ The author we justly hate / and yet we make myche of the law which is good
and reasonable / Wherefore the fundacion of this mannis resonyng to reprove or
reject any ordinance because our enemy either made it or used it / is uery
slender and folishe. God can be the auctor but of goodness / Amongst men that
is naught is naught who soever has used it / and that / that is good is good
who soever has abused it. And therefore there cannot be a more fond manner of
prouyng then to say this is naught / and whi so? for such a man meddled with it
/ such aman used it such a man commanded it / to be observed.


The hunter Because ye cannot conconfut my arguments / which i have made
against the pope and his traditiones / that ye might seem to your friends to
say sumthyng ye fayn an argument your self as thoghe it were mine and reason
stoutly with histories and examples against it but all in vayn / and to no
purpose / your argument which ye have made in my name is this / the pope has
made the ceremonies of the church / ergo they are to be cast a way with hyme /
which argument thoghe it be not mine yet for as miche / as it is fathered on
me / a little added to it / i will make it mine and prove that if follows well
enoghe. Never the less that all men may se how unshamfaced a liar ye be i will
rehearse the argument that i made to prove that the pope was still in england /
The popis doctrine is the pope / but ye hold still the popes' doctrine whils ye
hold still the ceremonies that he made / ergo ye hold still the pope / and
when as i cum to the trial of the popis ceremonies i do not as ye falsely lyk
one of the vnsham faced hoar of babylones sons / report of me / only say the
traditiones ar to be^ cast away because the pope made them / but i prove both
by testimonies of scripture and by natural reason that they are nonght have i
brought no other argument against / coniuryng of hally water and salt / crepyng
to the cross / against the forbiddyng of prestis marriages / against / the robri
of Christis cope against the stews / against the service / in latin / against
the prestes receynyng of the Gacrament to win there by to other men remission of
sins / but that the pope made them? I report me unto all them that have red
my book whether i have brought scriptur and reason or no / i have brought such
resones as me think ye can not yet wype away with all the sophistri logike
and law that ye have / and as for the other ceremonies that i resoned not
against / i did not say that they were therefore naught because the pope made
them as ye lie / but i would they which were uery trifles in compary son of
those traditiones that i wrote against / should be esteemed by the other which
seemed miche more gorgio^s the^ they were / not co^futyng them becawse both my
book should have been to long and also they neded no confutation when their
ibetters as they appeared / were proved to be naught / Now what will the story of
king Richard help you? seeing your fundacion is false. But i pray you what an
argument is this / king richard being an euel man / made a good polytike law /
ergo the pope thoghe he be an euel man may make a good doctrine that god never
made / which is godly and necessari for Christis church / Aristotel and Plato
were infideles and made good polytike laws for the common welthe ergo they culd
also make good and godly and necessari doctrines for Christis church / Your
argument follows not where ye argue an euel man may make good politic laws
for the body / ergo he may also make good and holsum doctrine for the soul /
This manner of resonyng from the less to the more affirmatively / is allowed in
no logike nor learning that ever i have seen / But lest ye should make your
excuse and say / that your argument is from like to kyke / and as it were thus
made / king richard an euel man made a good polytike law ergo the pope may
make a good polytike law / i will prove that ye take not these ceremonies and
traditiones for polytik laws / which are profitable for the governance of a
coman welthe but for laws for the soul / Ecclesiastical laws / and for
both promotors of goddis honor and for goddis service also / ye and more over
i can prove that ye take these ceremonies for the commandementes of god and make
the breakers of them the breakers of goddis commandementes / which if i do /
then procedethe your argument thus an euel man may make / good polytike laws /
ergo he can also make good laws for mannis saul and so holsum doctrines for
the church of Christ that if they were taken away all semelynes / and
godlynes should be taken away with them as ye say here after expressedly of
taking away of the popis cererionies / In yowr Catechism lately set out in the
kyngis name writing upon the fourth commandment ye say thus of the popis
ceremonies against the which i have written / partly in my huntyng of the
fox.) Likewise do they all break this comma^dment / which do not observe but
despise such laudable ceremonies of the church as set forth goddis honor /
and appertayn unto good order to be used in the church / And there fore
concerning such ceremonies of the church as have been instituted by our fore
fathers / and be allowed by the princes or kings of the dominiones as hallowyng
of the font / of the chalice / of the corporace of the altar / and other like
exorcismes and benedictiones / sprynklyng of holy water / gyuyng of holy bread
/ bearyng of ca^delles / and palms crepyng to the cross / and other like
laudable customs rites and ceremonies / are not to be despised / but to be
observed.) Then can ye not say that ye mean by the popis traditiones polytske
laws / for god gave no commandment of polytyke laws in the ten co^mandmentes
/ but left that in the liberti of Princes to make as many or as few as they
thynk necessari for their subjects / but ye weue these ceremonies under the
commandment of god / and to your great shame ye make the^ comma^dmentes of god
/ for if the transgression of ceremonies be the breakyng of goddis commandment
/ then must the keeping of them be the keeping of goddis co^ma^dment / and they
must also be goddis co^mandmentes. If that a man cum not to the church to
krepe to the cross / to bear candelles to hear mes in atong that he under
stands not / say not ye unto him whi wilt thou not cum to goddis service? Is
goddis service a polytike law? the^ it is plain that althoghe ve once said so /
ye mean not by the popes traditiones polytike laws. Now let vsse whether this
argument follows or no. The pope only being / a man and that an euel / man
brought in to Christrs church and commanded to be kept / these ceremonies and
traditiones which are not found in any place of goddis word ergo they ought
to be cast out of the church again / That the pop is ama^ye will grant me /
but that he is only a man your cano^ law will deny / for it says that the pope
may do that ama^ may not do that is to serperate whom god had copled to gether
/ that the pope is an euel man and a falls Prophet i dout whether ye will grant
me this / both with heart and mouth or no i must therefore prove it as well as i
can / He is the kyngis enemy and an usurper of autorite unto him self that god
gave him never / ergo he is an euel man / but i will if i ca^ bring a reason or
two sumthyng stronger to prove that he is Antichrist and a false Prophet and
there for that he is an euel man / He is Antichriste which teaches falls and
contrary doctrine unto Christis doctrine / and takes it upon him which
belongethe only unto Christ / the pope does so for he teaches that Peter was
head of the hole catholic church over all kings and Emperoures and above all
the rest of the Apostelles and that he is above all Emperoures and kings and
that they are bound to obey him and not he them / and that he being but a
bishop has both the swords / of the word / and of temporal correction /
with many such other false doctrines which because they are well known i need
not greatly to rehearse / That he is a false Prophet i prove it thus by the
autorite of the Prophet Ezechiel which paynteth your father and you so plainly
as though he had seen you both together / In the thyrtent chatpter he sayethe
thus / Son of man Propheci against the Prophets of Israel / which prophecy /
and say unto them that prophesi out of their oun heart hear the word of the
lord / Thus says the lord god / Woe be unto the foolish Prophets which go
after their own spret when as they have seen nothing / Thy Prophets (o Israel)
ar made like foxes in the wilderness ye have not gone up to the burstynges /
nether have ye made an hedge for the house of Israel to stand in battale in the
day of the lord. They have seen uanite / and a falls propheci sayng / the lord
has said / when as the lord has nor sent them / and they trust that their
word shall ones be allowed / Have ye not seen a vayn vision / and spoken a lying
prophesi? And ye have said / the lord has said when as i have not said it /
There fore sayethe the lord god / for as myche as ye have spoken uanite / and
have seen a lie / therefore says the lord be hold here am i against you /
and my hand shall be against the Prophets which se vanites and prophecy lies
/ they shall not be in the secret priuite of my people / and they shall not be
written in the nombre of the house of Israel / nether shall they cum unto the
land of Israel. And ye shall know that i am the lord / Now because they have
deceived my people sayng peace when there is no peace / and he byldeth a wall /
and they plaster it over with an unprofitable cruste / Say unto them that make
an unprofitable plasteryng of it that it shall fall / and there shall be a
shower flowyng in / and ye shall fall with the stones of the hale / and the
wind of the tempest shall brust you / And behold when the wall fallethe /
shall it not be said unto you / where is the cover that ye laid over / I shall
pull down the wall which ye have covered with an unprofitable crust / and i
will dashe it down to the ground / and the fundacion of it shall be openly
known and uncovered / and it shall fall / and ye shall be killed in the mids
of it / and ye shall be taught to know that i am the lord / And in the end of
the chapter he sayethe thus / Because ye have made sad the ryghtuous mannis heart
with a lie / when as i did not make him sorry / and streyngthen the hands of
the wikked that he return not from his euel way / that he may be kept quik.
There fore ye shall se no more vanite / and ye shall gess no more / but i will
deliver my people out of your hand. Thus far Ezechiel / of whose words i gather
that they are falls Prophets which speak unto the people those words and
doctrines which they have not received of god and yet make the people believe
that their doctrine and words be of god and wound good mennis consciences
where no sin is committed / and confort euel men when as yet the wrath of god
is over them / but these properties agree both to your father of rome and you /
ergo ye ar both falls Prophets / ye and your father say that a priest may not
mary by the law of god / that noman may be a preacher of goddis word except
hebe first benet / collat / subbeco^ ano decon or a sacrificyng priest / that
it is dedly syn to eat flesh in lent and on the days that ye have for bidden
to eat flesh on / except a man by apardon or a license for money / with you
also is sin / and yet can ye not prove that god has forbidden that ye forbid
/ ye have nether scripture nor word of god for you but these lies have ye
spoken out of your own hearts and wound and strike the consciences of good men
with dedely fear for leuyng of such things as god our law maker never
commanded / ye say it is good to take Christis cup from the laymen / to conjure
hally water / to bear wilowes / and wex candelles / to crepe to the cross / to
hallow chirches vestme^tes and chalices / to hear Mess Matines and euensong in
a strange tongue that the hearers understand not / to hallow the font and the
pascal and little candelles / and fire / to desire saints merits to bring us
to heaven / that one man may deserve remission of sins by the receyuyng of the
sacrament for an other / these doctrines do ye teach and say / that all these ar
good works / and god is pleased with these works when they are don and
offended when they are left of and undone / and thus do ye both comfor teuel men
with your trifles / and wonde good men with dedly fear where none should be /
and ye speak these words and doctrines out of your oun hertes / and ye can not
prove that god bad you teach these doctrines that ye teach / there for both
the pope and you which be the pergetter of the popes wall ar falls Prophets /
Be that is a true Prophet is sent of god / he is sent of god that speakethe the
word of god / and has the word of god to show for him / then seeing that
your father the wall maker of the popish church / and you the pergetter of the
same / have not the word of god to show for your doctrines / and yet say they are good and necessary for the church / ar both false Prophets then shall it
not be a good argument to say / this is the doctrine taught of a false Prophet
which he never received of god / ergo it must be cast away? Because now in
this time we have myche to do with mannis traditiones / and cererimonies /
which god nether commanded / nor ordened / and ye say that they are to be
holde^ in the church / and i contend that they are to be dryue^ out of the
church let us se whether i can bring better resones for the bannishement of
mannis doctrines or ye for the mantenance of them / Every doctrine that the
heavenly father has not ordened / must be pulled up by the roots and cast a
way / but the ceremonies and traditiones that ye defend / did the henenly
father never orden / there fore the ceremonies and traditiones that ye defend
/ must be pulled up by the roots and cast away. If he did orden them tell us
what book and chapter they are written in / I have once proved that they are of
the popis making prove you now and ye can / that they are of goddis making / and
till that time that ye have proved that / they must be pulled up by the roots
and cast away. Every strange doctrine is to be shoned of Christen men and to be
cast out of the church / but every doctrine is strange which is not contained
in the holy scripture / ergo all doctrines that are not contained in the
scripture ar to be shoned of Christen men / and to be cast out of the church /
But none of these traditiones ar contained in the holy scripture / there fore
they are to be shoned of all Christen men and to be casten out of the church /
acordyng unto the learning / of saint Paul which sayethe / hebrews the xiii.
let us not be carried about with diverse and strange doctrines. All those
precepts ar to be bannisshed out of the church / where to we are forbidden to
give head / but unto the precepts of men which refuse the truth ar we
forbidden to give head / therefore / all precepts of men which refuse the
truth ar to be bannisshede out of the church / But the pope and his papists
ar falls pro phetes and refuse the truth / ergo all their precepts ceremonies
and doctrines ar to be bannisshed out of the church. But the ceremonies and
traditiones that ye defend ar the popis commandmentes / therefore even because
they are his / being a falls Prophet and not goddis commandementes / ar to be
cast out of the church acordyng to the learning of saint Poul unto titus in
the first chapter which says / rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in
the faith not gyvyng head unto jewish fables and commandeme^tes of men which
refuse the truth. If that we be forbidden in the scripture to keep the
commandemente both of our fathers by nature / and also by governance if they
command any thing concerning religion that god has not commanded / much more
ar we forbidden to keep the commandmentes of them that belong nothing unto us /
if they command it concerning religion that god has not commanded / But we are forbidden to keep our fathers commandementes concerning religion if they
command us any thing that god has not commanded / Ezechiel the xx. chapter in
these words. In the commandementes of your fathers walk ye not and keep ye not
their judgments / walk in my precepts ande keep my judgments / ergo myche
more ar we forbidden to keep the commandementes of them that belong nothing to
us when they command us to keep that god has not commanded / But the pope
has nothing to do with us / there for we are forbidden to kep his
commandementes / when he commandethe us that god has not commanded be fore /
but the ceremonies that ye defend ar the commandementes of the pope / therefore
we are forbidden of all mighty god to kep them. All the doctrines of those men
which for their false doctrine ar justly exomunicated ar tobe driven away
with the men excomunicatede / But the pope for his false doctrine is first
justly excommunicated of Paul / afterward of the germans and last of our
most noble Prince king Henry the eight / ergo his doctrine which is his / must
be driven a way with him and not holde^ still as ye say / If ye say that Paul
has not excommunicated him hear what Paul says in the first chapter of the
epistel to the Galathianes / if any man preach un to you any other thing the^
ye received / the same / be acursed / but the pope preaches other doctrine
then the Galathianes learned of Poul / for they learned nothing of Poul but
that he had learned of god / be fore / for the pope teaches his owen doctrine
and ceremonies which nether Paul nor he receydied of god / there for the pope is
acursed and yet shall we hold still his learning? All the doctrines ar perilus
for man's soul and ar to be Casten away / which when they are taught / make
the techers there of to worship god in vayn / but all doctrines which ar the
co^mandementes of men if they be taught make the teachers there of to worship
god in vayn / ergo all the doctrines which ar the co^mandementes of me^ ar
parillous for mannis soul and ar to be casten away / but all the doctrines of
the pope that i write against / and ye defend / ar the doctrines and
commandmentes of men and only of men and that euel me^ / ergo they are perilous
for mannis soul and ar to be casten away / Now let in different men judge
whether ye have mo resones of autorite and weight / taken out of the scripture
to prove that an euel mannis doctrine should be holden in the church of Christ
/ or i have to prove that all ma^nis doctrine thoghe they were as holy as Poule
was or were angels of heaven if they have not receyned it of god ought to be
driven out of Christis church. And because ye harp miche on that string that
thoghe a man be euel and a falls Prophet that he may bring furthe not with
sta^dyng good fruytes and make wholesome doctrines / we will examine that sayng a
little farther yet with the learning of Christ which sayethe these words
concerning the matter that is in strife between you and me. Beware says
Christ of false prophets which cum unto you in shepis clothyng but with in
ar rauenyng wolves / By their fruytes shall ye know them / So me^ gather a
grape of thorns / or of thistelles figs? Every good tree makethe good fruit
/ but a rotten tree brings furthe euel fruit. A good tree cannot make euel
fruits / nether can a rotten tree bring furthe good fruits. whether is the
pope a rotten tree or no^ if he be a rotten tree / and yet ye say that he may
bring forth good fruits and make holsu^ doctrines / either must ye be a
falslyer / or ellis Christ's word is not treue Christ sayethe also Matthew. the
xij Either make the tree good and his fruit good / or make the tree and his fruit
euel / for the tree is known by the fruit / ye generation of vepers how can ye
speak good things when as ye be euel / for of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speakethe. A good man brings furthe good' things out of the goood
tresure of his heart / and an euel man bringethe forth euel things out of the
euel tresure of his heart. Thus far has Christ spoken / Now i desire you that are reders to be judges in this matter / whether Christ which sayethe that an
euel man and a falls Prophet cannot bring furthe good fruits and doctrines is
more worth to be believed with the naked truth / or master gardener which
says that the pope which is a falls Prophet and an euel man may bring furthe
good fruetes and make wholesome doctrines and necessari ceremonies and profitable
traditiones for the church of Christ / with his hystories and bys often
repeted good good / and with his natural resones.


The rescuer As myche agreyng to the faciones amongst the florentines / whil
they were in their common welthe. When on demanded what he said to such a
matter being then in consultation / he looked about / and esspying out on of his
enemies said / what so ever such a man would say poyntyng to his enemy / he was
of the contrari opinion. The kyngis maiesti like a noble prince has proceeded
in this matter not upon faction / nor upon displeasure / or enemite / but only
truth and therefore has rejected the bishop of rome / so far as he swarueth
from the truth And so far as the truth will bear / his maiesti agrees with
all the world / intendyng by the expulsion of the bishop of rome not to
confound the truth / but to purge it from such corruption as by the bishop
of romis mantena^ce did insect it.


The hunter Your meaning is that the pope is to be so far rejected and
bannisshed away as he swarueth from the truth and no farther / The bishop of
rome is an heretic for stubbornly holdyng of doctrines contrari to the
scripture / and he his a traitor for making of him self head of the church of
England / a boue the king. Other heretics convicted of heresi arburnt with
all their books thoghe they conteyn and have with in them all the truths and
doctrines that are in the hole bible / and all men that read them ar taken for
heretics / and their books ar ernestly forbidden / other traytoures convicted
once of treason / ar destroyed and put to death with all their good qualites
be they never so many (...) excellent. But the pope both an archeheretik of
the sect of papists / and a fountayn of treson / and an head traitor which
not only with words deniethe the kyngis supremeci / but alfo bears dedely
hatered against the kyngis maiesti / and would depose him if his pour were like
unto his will / by your procurement / has gotten a special pardon that thoghe
he be a traitor and heretic / he may abide still in England and that his
books which conteyn both his treson and his heresi may be red of all them
that can read them / and understand the^ with out all suspicion of heresi and
treson / only so myche of his traytourous doctrine and heretical treson
bannisshed away as ye his childer judge to swerve from the truth / which ar
so blinded with the darnel of his canon law that ye ca^ / not se it / How can
ye be judges in matters of truth of Christen religion which have not been
exercised and brought up in the truth / but in decrees / decretalles /
extrauagantes / counselles / cleme^tines and such other popish learning where
of ye have gotten such a taste in the palates of your mouths that what soever
scripture cummethe in your mouths it has a taste by your wrestyng of it / of
the popis decrees and decretalles even as he that has touched coloquintida or
aloe / makes all thing that he touch the have the taste of them. So myche of
the popis doctrine must be driven away as ye thynk contrari to the truth / the
fox must be so long han ged till ye say he is hanged enoghe / and them must he
be lette^ down again / but half hanged / because he is a clerk and can say his
nekverse / To speak in good ernest i thynk that every man may se that is not
wilfully blind that the pope thought he be a stranger and justly co^uicted of
ij great offenses yet has more fauore showed unto him then any heretic or
traitor being an Englisman had showed unto him in England these vij. years.
Therefore he has you favorers in England.


The rescuer So as this hunter chasethe far at large / when with the only
bishop of romis name / he would hunt out all / and destroy with the bad the
good also. And so he might have kept all his ye hold still / with out ye can
other wise disprove them / then because the bishop of rome used them or willed
them to be used / for they remain not be cause he wylled or used them / but
because they be good. The man pleases him self much that he proves by diverse
examples that like as Aristotellis doctrine is called Aristotel and Terences
comedies Terence / so the popes doctrine should be called the pope. But harken
again if Terence spak that Plato had spoken / when terence were bannisshed
might we not use the speech still of Plato / because it came ones out of
terences pen?


The hunter I ax of you again whether this terence was bannisshed for euel
speaking or for euel doing? If he were ba^nisshed fo: euel speaking and
learned the same of Plato / when terence were bannisshed it should not be lawful
to use still the speech of Plato / But if terence were bannisshed for euel
doing alone / and not for euel sayng when terence were bannisshed men might
follow Platoes speech where it is good thoghe it had ones cummed out of terences
pen / and he had used it / But what is this to the purpose? Can ye prove that
the doctrine that came through the popis pen was not his own / but the doctrine
of the father of heaven? If ye can prove that the pope can justly say with
Christ / the word which ye hear is not mine but my fathers which has
sent me / i will also allow the popis doctrine as ye do / not because it is his
but because it came from god / but for as miche as nether ye no: he can prove that
his doctrine came from god i will take you both for falls Prophets as i have
don hither to / Harken to me ones as i have don to you your sayng is that
Platoes learning that terence had used / were not to be cast away when terence
were bannisshed thoghe it had cum med through terences pen well so beit. Wilyam
tyndale wrote many books where in ar many true and godly sentences / and
saynges / which he had taken out of the holy scripture / and the hole new
testament which is the undoubted word of god came out of his pen in to our
english to^g willyam tyndale was bannisshed out of England and burnt as an
heretic in brabant / whether is it welland wisely don or no / that his books
which conteyn so miche godly learning and the hole new testament which came
through his pen / ar for bidden to be red and so bannisshed for an heresi or ij
that ye say ar in in his books / and for half a dosen fautes that are in his
translation? If it be euel don whi do ye not amend your doing and whi suffer ye
not his books to be red whi blot ye not out the fautes of his translation /
and condemn no more Christis learning because it came through W. Tyndalles pen?
If it be well don that W. Tyndalles books and the new Testament of his
translation ar forbidden to be red and ar bannisshed away with him because
they have sum fautes or an heresi or ij in them and ar cummed out of his pen /
then all the hole doctrine that ever the pope taught / with all his traditions
and books which ar so full of heresies and superstitiones / and have so little
scripture in them / ought to be miche more bannisshed away with the pope and
ought to be forbidden to be red then tindalles books and the Testament of his
translation ought now to be bannisshed and forbidden. Is there any holyer
doctrine in the popis law and in his ceremonies and traditiones then is in the
new Testameut of tyndalles translation? ar there not as many hereses in the
popis books as in tyndalles? What reason is it then that tyndallis books and
the new Testament of his translation shall be bannisshed away with tyndal /
and be forbidden to be red / and that the popis doctrine and ceremonies with
his books shall not be bannisshed with the pope but shall be kept still and
red in the church as a new gospel in the mother to^g that all the hole church
may under stand his doctrine / and learn it when as Christis doctrine must be
said and song in such a tongue as not one among an C. vnderstandethe because as
it apperethe that few should learn it? Whether has tyndal now or the pope more
favor showed unto him in England? tyndall which is bannisshed both bodily and
with all his books and doctrine, both good and bad or the pope / whose doctrine
and books ar red and allowed / after that he is commanded of the hiest pour
under god to be bannisshed out of England for his heresi and treson? If the
pope have not more favor / then Christ has in England / Why may the popis
gospel be red of all me^ in English / and Christis gospel is forbidden to be
red in e^glish / and only a few of gentle and rich me^ may read it?


The rescuer Christ said / Doctrina non est mea sed eius qui misit me patris,
And miche more what so ever is good spoken / or used by any man is of god.


The hunter The common heretic catcher is now becumned an open heretik him self
/ and a minissher of Christis glory / and a preferrer of me^ before god / for
thus saiethe he / What so ever is good / spoken or used by any man is myche
more of god the^ Christis doctrine is. He says that the popis ceremonies and
traditiones which i write against ar good / the^ ar they / by his sayng /
miche more of god the^ Christis gospel is. And therefore belike / he forbad that
certain men shall read Christis gospel / and suffers all that will to read
the popis traditiones / which he has of late years set out at large
interlaced here and there wit a piece and a pache of Christis learning to
purches more autorite unto the^ / if that he had thought that Christis learning
had been as miche of god as he thought the popis traditiones decretalles
decrees and clementines he would as well have fuffered all me^ that would have
red Christis gospel / as well to read it as he has permitted all me^ wyme^
and childer that list to read the popis ceremonies tradiciones decrees dectetal
les and clementines / Now is it cu^medout at leughthe for what cause was there
such diligent inqueri made every quarter for the transgressio^ of the popis
ceremonies / and such pains of death ordened therefore / and so small inquery
and little ponishme^t ordened for the breakyng of the co^mandeme^tes of Christ.
Now had Christ need of the testimoni of Ioha^ baptist / natha^nel / andre /
and peter to bear him witness that he is the son of god / which if the popis
proctour believed to be true / he would say that Christis good doctrine were as
well and as myche of god as the good doctrine of any man / If that this saying
of gardener be un examined and vncumpelled to be recanted as an abominable
heresi that Christis doctrine is not so myche of god / as any good thing used
or spoken by any man is of god / then i say that he has gotten as they say in
cambrydge agrace ab omnibus / and a licens to be a papist and an heretik and
that no mannis accusation against him shall be heard.


The rescuer And him ought we to make author of all good nes were it balaames
ass that uttered it / If Christ be preachede says saint Paul be it per
contentionem or iudicium / let it have place modo Christus predicetur / Look
upon the trewthe and goodness of the thing setting a part the person that
speakethe / precheth / utters executethe or commandethe the same Ne there was
here to fore any man so mad / as expellyng a tyrant / would cast away with him
both that which was good and that which was euel also.


The hunter As we ought to make god author of all goodness so we ought to be sure
to asscribe and lay no thing un to him but it that we know for a truth is
goodness / or good / prove once that the popis ceremonies and traditiones ar
good and then shall i say that they came from god / but where is your profecye
have from the beginning of your book x. times said the ceremonies and
ordinances that i have written against / ar good good and good but other proof
have ye brought none / think ye that it which is a falslye of it self / shall
by often repetyng of it wax true? Is it possible to make of an euel thing a good
thing by calling if many times good? Is the often and manyfold rehersyng of any
thing a sufficient proof of the same? other proof bring ye non / allearned
divine should have brought places of scripture to have proved that the
traditiones which ye so often call good had been good / as i have brought
arguments and textes of the scripture to prove that they are naught and
contrary to the scripture / But here i must pardon you / for in deed the
matters that ye defend ar so folishe triflyng and so co^trari to the scripture
that it is no meruel if ye can bring no place of scripture / for them to
defend them with / And where as ye say that there has been noman so mad / as
expellynge a tyran / would cast away with him both that which was good and the
bad also / whether ye mean of good profitable / or good pleasant / or by
creation / ye swerve far from the truth / for allmyghty god the well of all
wisdom / commanded the childer of Israel when they should drive out the he then
kings with their folk of the land of promis / to drive and put away with the^
/ all their laws ceremonies and traditiones even the^ that were laufull / were
they never so profitable or pleasant for the common wealth / It is tobe thought
that in so many citees and kingdoms that there was sum good politic laws /
and sum profitable and pleasant for a common welthe / But for all that were they
never so good so politic and profitable / god gave the this commandment unto
the childer of Israel concerning them / sayng Leuitice the xviij. chapter After
the custom of the land of egypt where in y^ have dwelt shall ye not do / and
after the manner of the land of chanaan where in to i shall bring you shall ye not
do / nether shall ye walk in their laufulles / ye shall do my judgments and
keep my precepts and walk in them. And in the xx. chapter. Walk not (sayethe
allmyghty god) in the laufulles of the nationes which i shall drive out before
you. Moses goddis true servant sayethe also deuteronom ij the xij. chapter when
thou art entered in / after their destruction / require not their ceremonies /
sayng as this folk has worshippet their gods / so will i worship also. Thou
shall not do likewise unto thy lord god / That which i command the / do thou
only unto the lord / put nothing to it nether take any thing from it / If the
pope your father and you had dwelt in the city of Hierico or hay or any other
such like which moses Iosuc or David destroyed / and had there / all your
holy traditiones / laudable ceremonies / good and polytike laws / promoters /
and setters furthe of goddis honor / with your decrees decretalles /
councelles and clementines / should Moses Iosue and David have been mad men to
have destroyed all your good and polytike laws and all your laudable
ceremonies? Make me an answer unto this question? If they should have been mad /
then men ar mad for doing of goddis commandment. If they should not have been
mad if they had destroyed all your fathers ceremonies and traditiones / which
were not expressed in Moses law / and had commanded the people to keep and use
only such ceremonies and precepts as were contained in the written word of
god / a prince which would drive out of his realm at this hour / the pope
which is agreuous tyran / and an enemi unto goddis word / if he drove out
with him all his ceremonies laws and traditiones / saving only them that are
expressed in the word of god / he should be no more mad / the^ Moses Iosue and
David was / which in their time did such like / The xv. chapt. of the first
book of the kings is plain against you / where as god co^mandethe Saul to
kill man woman nuris and child / ox sheep camel and as / if that all thing be
good that god has created / the oxen sheep the camelles the asses and young
childer was good and yet god commanded the^ not only to be expelled with the
tyran agag / but also to be destroyed and killed with hyme / the^ me^ may se
how wisely ye have spoken when ye said that noman was so mad as eypellyng a
tyra^ would drive a way with him both it that was good and also the bad / The
deed of king Saul in the foresaid chapter / Was miche agreeable to your deed / in
puttyng down the pope and his popistri / As god commanded Saul to destroy agag
and with him to destroy all his / both man woman and child / ox / as camel and
sheep / and yet he like a polytike fellow / killed not agag but kept him quike
and saved the best of the sheep and other cattal / and the best clothes and all
thing that was fayer and goodly to look to / so when ye were commanded of the
king our master to drive away the pope with all his popistri / ye put down / a
very small sort of small abusis / but the pope himself with the great abuses ye
hold still and say that they set furthe goddis honor / as Saul said that he
kept the best of the sheep and cattale to make sacrifices of to allmygcy god /
But as allmyghty god perceiving that Saul for couettousnes saved contrari unto
his commandment agag and the best of the sheep and other bestis / thoghe he
cloked his fact with the cloak of goddis service / deposed Saul and for ever
kest him out of his favor / so should our most noble Prince king Henry / follow
god and do very well to depose you and make you a bishop quondam for breakyng
of his comma^dment / in holdyng still the pope and the greatest abominaciones
that ever he ordened.


The rescuer Wherefore seeing in all his / ye hold still / he bringethe no
other disprofe but only from the personage that has used the^ / i pas them
over as of no force / and cum to his cokkyng upon the clergy / when he sayethe
/ What say ye gentle men of the clergy / concerning the laws of the church
/ I say here your mastership plays both the parts / and as he said at
gamyng / ye would win the game if ye played alone / And yet have ye spent a
great meny words in vayn / ye put no difference between deeds laws and
ordinances / and because it were in deed a great folly / for any man by
proclamation to cause an other mannis deeds to be called his / as ye put your
example right lewedly in sardanapalus / so by you it shall be like folly, to
call and make an other mannis laws and ordinances his by proclamation / Vhere
in how miche your folly is / ye euydently declare / that either do not / or will
not speak the difference / but abuse the simplicite of the reder / as though
deeds and laws were all one / Where as in the one / it were madness by
proclamation to make an other mannis deeds his and the other of all wise men
used and observed / for in laws and ordinances the Romans sendyng to the
Greeks for them / made them by approbation there is / And there is no common welthe
/ but it has taken in sum point example of an other / concerning the laws
which be worthily theyrs / where they have received the^ / And amongst the
Athenienses / laws made of solon / were not solones laws / but the laws of
the city / as the text of the law says / which sufficethe to reprove and
confound this gentle mannis resonynge / where in he would seem to excel / But
the man concludethe that he would have no law but the gospel in the church /
which is so far out of reason / that i will not reason with him in it. And he
semethe him self to be ashamed of it / and / therefore takethe upon him to prove
sum part of such ceremonies as we observe in the church to be repugnant to
the scripture.


The hunter As a fox dar not adventure to run in the plain way / for fear of
the howndes / lest they should catch him / but rumneth in to holes and ledethe
them out of the plain way in to busshes brambles and thyk thorns / so do ye
the romish foxis protector / for ye leap away from my arguments and answer
nothing to them / but ye call me craftily away out of my arguments to babble
with you whether deeds ordinances and laws be all one or no / wherefore ye
lordely reprove me / But i ax of you whether a man saying that the ordenyng of
hally water to take venial sins away / was pope Alexanders deed / speakethe
good and true English or no / Is not an act and a deed all one? And call ye
not the laws and ordinances made in the parliament house the acts of the
parliament? Why may not i then call the popis laws his acts and deeds / Sothe
he nothing that makethe a law? If he do sumthyng it that he does / is a deed /
then if he orden a law his law ordened is his deed / then will not this shift
serve you / to trifle about a word / and let the argument alone vnsoluted / If
this word deed do offend you so sore i will use a term more pleasant unto you
/ and make my argument thus / The popis ordinances and the pope ar all one then
to whom soever ye give and attribute the popis ordinances him as myche as lie
the in you ye make pope / but ye give and attribute unto the king the popis
ordinances ergo as myche as lie the in you ye make the king pope / Now what
advantage have ye gotten by refusyng the word deeds? As concerning your
examples fet out of the civil law they do not solute my argument / for my
argument was thus / As if the king of Denmark should make a proclamation that
all the ceremonies of Moses law should be no more called Moses ceremonies but
his ceremonies / yet for all that Moses ceremonies should abide and continue
still Moses ceremonies / for all his proclamation / so the ceremonies that the
pope has ones made / continue and abide still the popis ceremonies for all
that they are commanded by proclamation no more to be called the popis
ceremonies but the kings ceremonies / ye say that the Romans send to the
Greeks for their laws and by approbation* made them theyrs / i pray you
remanded not the Greeks laws still theyrs / for all that the Romans used the
same laws? Was not the Romans and Greeks partners in laws together when they
used to gether the self same laws? then it folowethe for all your examples and
by your examples that the popis ceremonies ar yet still his and ar occupeed in
England and that (by your sayng) the kyngis hyghnes and the pope ar partners
to gyther concerning ceremonies / for the after partnership dispossesseth not
the fierst hole awner of his former possession / but he only gyuethe part of
his right unto him that is made afterward partner with him. Have ye any other
thing to conclude with your examples? If ye have / make your argument and i
shall shape a solution for it as well as i can / I trow ye will not be so mad as
to argu thus on cite may receyne civil laws of an other ergo the church may
receive laws of the pope / Which is a false Prophet and a fervent Pharise /
when as Christ sayethe in the gospel be ware of false Prophets / beware of
the Leuin of the Pharisees / Where as ye say that i speak so far out of reason
(where i say that i would have no other law in the church but the law of the
gospel alone) that ye will not reason with me / ye play as your brother fox did
which when he came through a wynyarde and saw that the grapes we re hyer then he
could reche to / said he would eat no grapes / so when as my sayng is strongely
defended with goddis word that ye can make no reason against it / ye wilnot
reason / with me / scilicet / becausye can not. This conclusion do ye hold that
the law of the gospel in not sufficient for Christ's church to order and ruel
it / except the popis traditiones be annexed there to / and that he speakethe
far out of reason that would have only the law of the gospel in the church /
Against this deuelish doctrine of yours i will make these resones / The law of
the gospel is miche more perfect / then the law of Moses / But the law of Moses
was sufficient by it self for all them that was under it / and neded no mannis
ordinance to be added unto it / to order the jews that were under the old
Testament / then is the law of the gospel miche more sufficient by it self for
all them that are under it / and miche less nedethe any mannis ordinances to be
added unto it to order them that are under the new Testament / Paul calls the
law of Moses a child leder unto Christ / a shadow of good things for to cum /
and says that the law bringethe nothing to perfection / If this law neded
nothing to be added to it or mingled with it the law of the gospel which Paul
prefers before the old law ij Corinth. in the third chapter has now no
need of the bishop of romis traditiones to be added to it or mingled with it /
Is not the lau of the gospel perfect? Is not that the most perfect law that the
most perfect lawmaker makethe? made not Christ the perfitest law maker the law
of the gospel? To that law which is perfect in all points nothing nedethe to
be added unto it / The^ the law of the gospel nedethe not the popis law to be
added unto it and so is the law of the gospel sufficient for Christ's church
and Christ's chirch needs no other law but it that Christ ordened his self
for his church. Further more when as the end of a perfect law of the church
which alone is sufficiend by it self to order the church / is to command all
thing that is necessari to salvation to forbid all thing that is hyndera^ce to
salvation / to teach / to reprove / to correct / to instruct / to make aman
perfect / and ready to every good work and to be salvation unto all the^ that
beleve / and the law of the gospel ca^do all these things / what shall we need
to have any other law in the church saying that this law conteneth all thing
in it that is necessari for the church of Christ / and has all the points
/ that be long unto a perfect law which ne death no other law to be added unto
it? Almighty god told his son Christ all laws that was necessari for Christis
church / and Christ taught his Apostelles all that he heard of his father /
and all that the Appostelles learned of Christ necessari for Christis church
/ they and the Eua^gelistes have written it in the new testament which is the
law of the gospel / But the Eua^gelistes and Apostelles have made no mention of
the popis ceremonies laws and traditiones / therefore they are not necessari for
Christis church / but the law of the gospel is necessari alone / Paul speaks
of this law of the church these words / I am not ashamed of the gospel for it
is the pour of god to salvation to all that believe. Do i yet still speak far
out of reason when i would that only the law of the gospel should be in the
church? Christis religion came in to the world bithe word of god and not by
ma^nis traditiones and Christis religione has from the beginning be^ up
holde^ with the word of god and not with mannis traditiones / and the
Christian religion is not grounded upon mannis ordinances / the^ the religion of
Christ should continue and prosper well enoghe as it has don from the
beginning to this day if all the popis ceremonies and traditiones were in the
depest pit of hell from whence they came / The ceremonies and traditiones of men
have ever been hinderance to the true religion / which things caused Christ
to say to your brother pharisees manteners of mannis doctrine as ye be / Whi
break ye the commandment of god for your tradition? They worship me in vayn
techyng the doctrines which are the precepts of man / then how far speak you
out of reason to say that the popis traditiones ar necessare for Christis
church / and to mean that Christ had need of the popis traditiones and laws
to ruel his church with all and to promote his honor / and to purches autorite
unto his Sacraments / Where as ye reason that i seem to allow all those
ceremonies that i write not against / and only disalow them that i write
against / i reason with you again / if i seem to allow althe ceremonies which i
write not against / then if follows that ye seem to allow all the popistri ad
superstitiones that your conpapist eccius has taught / with all other
Papists / for ye have not written against them / ye seem to allow that i lay
unto your charge / that ye say mes for to hele the french pox for mad dogs
and meselled swyne / that the hallowyng of the font is all full of blasphemy /
that no priest nether any man above xxj. may make an unlawful vow that ye hold
still the stews that the deuel may have a place in England to be worshipped in
/ that it is agreater offense for a priest to mary / them to defyle all the
wives in his parish every one after other / that ye intend to be aduouterers
and horemongers / that ye reken it the deuellis service to read Christ's word
in English when the prestes read Omelias Gregorij pape in latin / that ye would
forbid Christ to preach / if he were in England this day / as he was in ie
wry / if he would preach in English those sermones of his that the Evangelists
wrote in Greek / All these do i lay to your charge in my huntyng of the fox but
ye nether answer to them / nor examine them nor confute them / as ye go about
to examine answer to and confute other matters that i lay to your charge /
wherefore by your manner of arguyng which ye ground upon this text / Qui tacet
consentire uidetur, ye allow and aproue all these articles which i have above
rehearsed.


The rescuer And first he beginnethe with the crepyng to the cross which
ceremony he can in no wise digest / therein he laborethe stoutly from the
beginning of Gramner / to the end of Logik.


The hunter When as the crepyng to the cross is open idolatri / and dedly sin /
it is to hard meat for my maw to digest / if that ye with your companiones
which have dronken of the hot wine of fornication of the hoar of Babylon /
will needs eat it and with that wine can digest it / ye schal digest it alone
for me / And whether my arguments which i fetch not alone out of Grammar and
Logik but also out of the holy scripture ar stronger then ye can confute be
made to no purpos orno / let other me^ judge / which knowethe the scripture /
and we shall try the matter here after.


The rescuer For by his resonyng to declare this word worship (which he does
right worshipfully) it were idolatri / for the servant to make curtesi to his
master / where in he should bow his kne / or the good man to kiss his wife / but
to knele and to kiss his superiors hand / were by him foul and filthy
abominatione / for that were both to gether.


The hunter If that the master and the wife / had hands and could not feel /
fete and could not go / mouths and could not speak / ears and could not
hear / noses and could not smell eyes and could not se / and were as braynles
and soulles as your cross is / and so were idols / and therefore forbidden to
be worshipped of allmyghty god / then if the servant made curtesi to (...)
idol / or the husband kissed such a wife / they should worship their master
and wife vnalwfully and so commit idolatri / But when as a master is a living
creature of god and servants ar commanded to honor their masters and to obey
them / and god will be known to be in ruelers / and that all masters and
ruelers have their mastership and autorite of him / the outward kissing and
knelyng of servants which ar but tokens of their hearts and inward obedience
to their superiors / is not forbidden of almighty god but allowed / for the
inward obedience is greater then the outward Curtesi / and if he allow the
greater he aloweth the less / And god commanded men to love their wives / then
when as kissyng is the sign or token of love / where the thing is allowed / the
token of the same is not forbidden / Therefore it is no idolatri for the servant
to make courtesy to his master / nether is it idolatri for the man to kis his
wife / for nether of those ij factes or forbidden / but seeing that we ow no love
nor obediance unto images / and the outward worship is in expressed words
forbidden to be given unto images in the second commandment / in these words
thou shall not humble or bow they self unto them / nor serve them / it is open
idolatri / to make curtesi to images and to kiss them / Where for it follows
not / we may give outward reverence and worship unto masters and to kings ergo
we may give outward worship unto images / for if this be your argument / ye
mean that a blind and lyfeles piece of silver or gold made after the lyknes of
a mortal man / by a mortal man / is as good honorable and as worthy to be
honored as a master and a king which is the highest and most honorable (...)
of goddis making in all this wide wo^^^ / and that images ar as well / to be
loved as men love their w^^^s / and that god is as well to be honored (...)
^^ages as in kings / and workethe and ruelethe as well by them as by kings.
Which meaning whether it be agreinge unto the scripture or no / let them
which have autorite in England to examine such matters / judge and give
sentence.


The rescuer What an argument would* this man fet out of a word in Greek or
Latin being general / to make thereby a special conclusion to his purpose
Scripture uses the word adoro / as the word worship is used in English to
signifi godly honor / and Joseph fuffered him self to be worshipped of his
brethern / with reverent behauour / and there is on word adoro in both.


The hunter Either ye write uery darkly for the nons / or ellis your scribe has
left out sum thing for your reason hangethe very euel together / Howbeit i reken
that this is your meaning. The angel forbad Johan to worship him and Joseph
suffered his brethet to worship him / and in ^^the the places is adoro /
therefore adore signif^^^ Both inward worship dew unto god and also outward
worship / But what ye mean more / i cannot tell except this be your meaning /
on kind of worshippynge that is out ^^rde reverence / may be given unto me^ /
ergo ^^ay also begyuen unto images / If ye mean thus your meaning is plain
falls / for allmyghty god by who me all kings reygne and all ruelers have their
pour / willing that it should be known / that all that have any governance ruel
for au^orite over other / have the same of him alon and not of them selves /
will be honored in his ministers which ar the governors and ruelers of his
people / with outward reverence and bodily honor / reseruyng ever unto him self
the worship which standethe in puttyng trust of salvation / and love above all
other / and yet / he will that the subjects shall not only worship their
superioures with out ward worship / but that they shall love them with their
hearts / and obey the^ faithfully also / Then when as Iosephis brether fell
down and worshipped him for as miche as they knew he was a prince ordened of
god / they offended not god thereby only signifiyng the inward obedience and
subjection of their minds / and Joseph being goddis minister offended nothing
in taking that outward worship unto him / which was a token of the inward
submission of his brethers minds toward him / But shall a Christen man / to
whom by Christ / all the creatures of the world the birds of the air / the
fisshes of the water / and the beasts of the earth ar in subjection / and
subdued / by outward gesture or reverent behauoure / testifi and witness that he
is in subjection and subdued unto a mannis handeworke / to a piece of molten
silver or gold? Shall the lord of all the noble creatures of god which ar in
earth / bow and knele to a vile piece of silver or gold made after the lyknes
of a man / being but the creature of aman? Fie for shame that a man know eth
not his own dignite. Shall aman by outward reverence testifi that god is in
that image or workethe by that image which hekisseth and worshippethe? Shall
Christen men that profes the scripture testifi by knelyng before images that
god will either be worshipped in images / or by images / with out scripture and
contrari unto the scripture? Set then aside this reason we may give outward
reverence unto gouernoures ergo we may do so to images / And if ye mean that
Joan in the Apocalypse would have given godly inward honor unto the angel / i
will dissent from you till that i se you bring better resones then ye have
brought yet. Thynk ye that Johan that holy man to whom god had showed so miche
of his secrets / was so mad as to go about to give unto an angel the godly
inward worship dew unto god alone? I judge no / and i thynk that Johan by his
outward worshippyng which he would have given unto the angel would have showed
that he took the angel for his better / and superior / and that the angel
knowing his intent / and that god had not subdued man under angels would not
that Johan should restifi any subjection unto him by any such reverent
behauoure / and therefore said Deum adora, worship god / that is / testifi by
thy falling down and outward behauour that thou art under god and that he is
thy better and superior / as for me i am not thy superior but thy fellow
servant / And as touching the nature of this word adoro / grammarianes which
can judge best of the natures of words / hold contrary unto you / that adoro
is only taken for outward worship and outward gesture / for thus writes the
abbreuiato* of Valla.

Adorare est gestu corporis honorem / etiam sine ore et uoce impendere. And
Valla his self says thus Adorare sine ore hoc est sine uoce fit / non sine
plicatione genuum et gestu corporis / Elephas et Phoenix et alia quedam
irrationabilia solemn adorare dicuntur. Saint Ierom upon the third chapter of
Daniel writes these words / Et notanda proprietas Deos coli / imaginem adorari
dicunt / Quod utrunque seruis Dei non conuenit / The scripture after the
translation of Ierom most commonly uses adoro to give outward worship and colo
to give godly inward worship / as aman may se both in many other places / and
especially in the xx. of Exodus and in the v. chapter of the Deuteronomy / then
is not this word Adoro so general both to godly inward worship and to outward
worship as ye unlearnedly without autorite have pronunced. But put the case
that odoro betokens both the kinds of worshippyng / he that puts a
negation before adoro in such a mode as men forbid / forbiddethe nothe both
the kinds of worshippyng? He that says thou shall not worship an image when
worship is both taken for reverent behauour / and for godly inward worship /
forbiddethe he not to worship an image with reverent behauour? But god puts
a negation before Adoro / wherefore even by your sayng it is forbidden to give
any reverent behauour unto an image / If that i did reason then from a general
term to a particular my argument negatiuely after good Logik should be as good
as ye made any these seven years / for where the generalis denied or forbidden
all the specialles contained under the general ar also denied and forbidden /
then if adoro as ye say be general both to kis and to show a reverent
behauour / and to give godly inward worship / when images ar forbidden adorari
/ to be worshipped / then is both the outward worschip which stands in
knelyng kissyng and in such other outward gesture / and the inward worship of
the heart / is also forbidden to be given unto imagines / How beit i made no
such argument before this time for i resoned thus a sufficienti diuisione /
There are no mo kinds of worshippyng but ij. inward and outward / but nether
of them is to be given unto images ergo no worship is to be given unto images
the probation of this argument i fet out of the xx. chapter of Exodus where
allmyghty god sayethe touching images / non adorabis ea neque coals, thou shall
nether bow to them nor serve them. This is the sum of my argument thoghe i
rehearse not the same words / which whether it be yet soluted or no let
learned men judge.


The rescuer I may not worship the cross in the church with godly honor for it
is against goddis commandment but i may use before it reverent behauour of
which expressedly spak saint Ierom when he said / Adhererem trunco crucis nec
prius dimitterem quam ueniam obtinuissem.


The hunter Ye play with allmyghty god which forbids you to bow and knele
to images / as a certain crafty boy did play with his Scolmaster in a grammar
scoole / which commanded this boy and all other that learned grammar to speak
Latin one to an other at all times / and no English / This boy as often as he
was disposed to clatter English / he took unto him and a. b. c. boy and said
unto him / Robin i will speak to the / and with this Preface he spak English
all the longday by this boy to his fellows / and so mokked the spy / an brak
his masters commandment / But the master came ones in at the last and spied his
craft / and took him and ponisshed him for a speaker of English to his fellows
for all that he said that he spak unto the a b. c. boy. So ye perceyuyng that
sum would chek you if that ye held always that a man might worship the cross it
self / most commonly ye say that a man may use reverent behouour before the
cross but not to the cross / and that ye worship not the cross it self / but
Christ / which is signified by the cross / when as ye worship the cross it
self and not Christ / and sum time hold in plain words that a man may worship
the cross it self / with reverent behauour / so that the heart be away / as i
shall here after god willing / sufficiently prove it. Ye say that ye may not
worship the cross in the chirch with godly honor for that is against goddis
commandment / If that ye will make any answer to apore man / tell me what is
this godly honor that is forbidden / to be given unto images / and where and in
what words it is forbidden? Ye mean by godly honor / as far as i can gather
by your book / the inward worshippyng of god alon / which stands in trust of
salvation and in love above all creatures / for ye say here after in your book
that true worship is only in sprete / and that kyssyng and knelyng is not godly
honor. where of it follows that your judgment is that a man may worship an
image with outward woship that is with kyssyng of it with knelyng and crepyng
to it / Where as ye hold that outward reverent behauour as knelyng and kissyng
is no part of goddis worship ye speak against Christ which sayethe Matthe
iiij. chapter / thou shall humble thy self or bow thy self down unto thy lord
god / and only serve him / whereas humlyng or falling down is outward worship /
and / serving is to put confidence of salvation / and the inner worship of god
/ here ye may se that god requirethe also that the outward worship / and will
not suffer it to be given to other the^ to him self and to such as he will be
known to ruel in. When the deuel said unto Christ / Luc the iiij. i will
give the al these if thou will fall down and worship before me / what if that he
had stand by / and said to the deuel give me all that / thou promised Christ /
and i will do that thou requirest of him / if he promisede and ye fell down and
worshipped be fore the deuel / whether had ye given any worship dew unto god /
to the deuel or no? If that ye say that ye had given no worship dew to god /
unto the deuel / then is it nosin in your books to knele before the deuel and
to kis him so that your heart be away / and that a man may worship the deuel
with his body so that he worship him not with his mind / If that ye say that
in falling down and worshippyng before the deuel ye gave to the deuel worship
that was dew unto god / the^ is worshippyng before the deuel worshippyng of the
deuel / and falling down and such other outward worship is dew unto god and on
kind of goddis worship / the^ is not alonly the godly honor which is in the
heart / but also the outward gesture as bowyng and knelyng worship dew unto god
which nether ca^ be do^ to the deuel nor to any image with out dedly sin / and
yet ye say that we maynot worship the cross with godly honor / but that we may
use reverent behauour before it / that is to kis it / to how to it and to crepe
to it / which is no other thing the^ to give at the least unto it outward
worship which is co^trari to the second commandment of god / If that ye would
fly to this shift and say i worship and use renere^t behauoure before the cross
but i worship not it i will prove you by the scripture that to worship before
god is to worship god to worship before a man is to worship a man and and to
worship before an image is to worship the image / before which it is down /
Genesis iiij. Pharao made Iosephe cum up to his charet / an the crier to cry
that all men should bow their knees before Joseph / and know that he was made
rueler over all Egypt. Mark here that to bow knees is to worship / and to
worship before Joseph is to worship Joseph / and that the cause why that Pharao
would have Joseph worshipped / was that he would let all his people know that his
pour and autorite was in Joseph / Leuitici the x. chapter. Nadab and abiu
offered before the lord / In the first of the kings / xxv. chapter Abigael
lyghted of her as and fell on her face before David / and worshipped on the
ground and fell down to his fete / ij of the kings in the xiiij. chapter. The
woman fell upon the ground before David and worshipped him / Psalm. lxxxv. All
the people which thou have made / shall cum / and worship before / the / lord.
Esaie. lxvi. All slesh shall cum to worship be fore mi face (sayethe the lord)

chapter. I will leave me 7000. whose knees have not been bowed before baal / By
these places it is plain that to worship before god / man or image / is to
worship god man or the image that the worship is don before / But ye knele bow
and crepe before the cross it self ergo ye worship the cross it self / to kis
with religions behauour is to give outward worship but ye with religious
behauour kis the cross it self ergo ye worship the cross it self / But what need
i any other witness to prove that ye worship the cross then your oun words
which ye sing on good firday which ar these crucem tuam Domine adoramus, lord
we worship thy cross / Never the les ye would have as long as ye could make the
kyngis highness and all his subyectes believe that ye would worship before the
Cross only and not the cross it self / But when as ye ar bet with arguments ye
leave of your dissemblyng and fall ernestly to defend that the cross may be
worshipped with reverent behauour that is with kissyng it knelyng and crepyng
to it / for ye say that in knelyng and kissyng alone understanding of the cross
/ is no idolatri / And that no unlearned man in England should allege any
scripture against you / or should percyue that the worshippyng of the cross with
crepyng and bowyng to it / is contrari to the scripture ye have theuishly /
roberously / wikkedly and deutlyshly stolle^ that piece of the secunde
commandment away which forbiddethe to bow or give any outword worship unto
images. For thus write you in your new Catechism which ye call like a masker
as ye be the kyngis book / Thou shall not have any graven image nor any lyknes
of any thing that is in heaven above / or in earth benethe / or in the water
under the earth to the intent to do any godly honor and worship unto them /
This is your translation / and in this book where in ye examine me / ye take
away from godly honor bowyngdown / falling down / knelyng an kessyng / and
such other outward gestures / and say that these are not forbidden to be given
unto images / but only the inward godly honor / is forbidden / And that ye
might the more easily bring the lay people unto your opinion ye steal away as i
have said a piece of the second commandment / for where as ye say only / thou
shall give no godly honor and worship unto images / meaning thereby the inward
trust and godly love and obedience / and that outward bowyng knelyng and
kissyng are not forbidden to begyuen unto images / The truth of the hebrew is
openly against you / for thus has the Hebrew text both in the Deuteronomi and
in Exodo Lo chisstachaue Lahem velo thaauede^ the lxx. interpretoures made this
text thus in Greek (...) Saint Ierom translated the hebrew thus in to Latin /
Non adorabis ea neque coals That is thou shall not give outward reverence to
images / nether inward godly worship unto the^ / Leo jude follows saint
Jerome / and pagnine translatethe the Hebrew text thus / Non incuruabis te eis
et non colestas / That is thou shall not bow thy self unto them / and thou
shall not worship them / And the Greek / word for word is thus / thou shall not
kis them nether serve them / wherforr seeing that ye have stolen out of the
Hebrew text lo thisstachaue / (...) out of the Greek text / Non adorabis out of
saint Ieromis translation / Non incuruabis te / out of pagnines translation /
and thou shall not bow thy self unto them / out of the English bible it
follows that ye ar a shamfup thiefea^d have committed shamful sacrilege or
church robry and ar so myche more worthy hangyng the^ any church robber that
was hanged in England these C. years / as the thing that ye have stolen is
more precious then that the other church robbers have taken out of the church
/ in time past I gather therefore by the autorites above rehearsed / and by these
last translationes that to worship before an image is to worship an image /
that to bow to an image and to kis it is to give outward worship unto it / and
that it is co^trari to the second co^mandme^t to give either inward or outward
worship to an image / then when as the cross is nothing but an image / ad ye
crepe to it kis it and bow to it / ye give it outward worship / and to give
either owtward or inward worship to an image is idolatri / it follow the that in
crepyng to the cross and bowyng to it ye commit plain idolatri openly forbidden
in the second commandment / Hold ye still now no popish doctrine co^trari to the
word of god? Now let us cum unto the sayng of saint Ierom which ye bring
agaydst / me / It would have becumed a learned Bishop to have brought in a matter
of religion the holy scripture / and not a patche of a mannis doctrine / ye say
that saint Ierom sayethe that he would cleuero and not let go the post of the
cross til that he purdressed forgiveness / Where sayethe Jerome this? It is like
that ye never red this in saint Ierom / but either in the canon law or ellis in
sum of your brother papistys works / for ij causes i reken that these words ar
either non of saint Ieromes or ellis that ye have mangled them / first because
ye mangle the scripture ye will not be aferde to mangle a Doctor / and because ye
show no place where as Ierom writes these words / the second is becaws i know
that Ierom in an other place is of a clean contrari judgment / And because ye
leave the wepens of the word of god / and feght against me with the wepens of
Doctors / i will answer with the sayng of a doctor. Saint Ierom writing upon
the third chapter of Daniel sayethe these words following concerning the worship
of images / Sieve statuam ut Simmachus sieve imaginem auream, ut caeteri
transtulerunt, uoluerimus legere, cultores Dei eam adorare non debent, Ergo
iudices and principes seculi, qui imperatorum statuas adorant and imagines, hoc
se facere intelligant, quod tres pueri facere nolentes placuerunt Deo. Et
notanda proprietas deos coli, imaginem adorari dicunt, quod utrunque seruis Dei
non conuenit. Whether we will read a standing image / as symmachus / or a golden
image as the other have translated / the true worshippers of god ought not to /
humble their selves unto it / Therefore let the judges and Princes of the world
/ understand which give outward worship to the standing images and liknesses
of Emperoures / that they do the same that the iij. childer would not do / and
therein pleased god / And the properti is to be marked / they say that god is
worshipped with inward worship and images with outward gesture. Thus far
speaks Ierom / whose words whether they make for the outward bowyng knelyng
and crepyng to images ar no / let them judge which either have learning in the
scripture or any good natural wit.


The rescuer Thus they delude the simplicite of the people with the ambiguite of
the words / and as uery enemies of the cross of Christ they labor to extinct
all ways and means which might set out the glory of the cross / miche
agreeable to the turks procedynges who forbids open shows or preching of
Christis Religion / these men speak mich of prechyng / but note well this / they
would we should se nothing in remembrance of Christ and therefore can they not
abide images / They would we should smell nothing in memori of Christ / and
therefore speak they against anoyntyng and hallywather. They would we should taste
nothing in memory of Christ / and therefore they cannot away with salt and holy
bread / A supper they speak of which they would handle like a dryngkyng. Finally
they would have all in talkyng they speak so myche of prechynge / so as all the
gates of our senses and ways to mannis under standing should be shit up saving
the ear alone / as by talkyng the deuel were so far onward of his purpos to
extinct Christ / which with the subversion of the orders of the world / seems
to be the mark where at this sect shoteth.


The hunter I delude not the simplicite of the people with ambiguite of words /
as ye falsely belie me / for i allege the second commandment of god against
the crepyng to the cross and the kyssyng of it / where as both the outward
worship and the inward is forbidden / Be that says eat of no dog nether of
the land nor the water / use the no ambiguite of words / which should have used
ambiguite / as it appears if he had said alone / eat no dog. Therefore whether
worship be taken generally or by excellency for godly worship i wse no
ambiguite for i declare openly that both the kinds of worship is forbidden to
be given unto images / both it that stands in inward faith and love / and
it that consists in outward gesture as knelyng and kyssyng and such like /
Now be cause ye cannot reason against me nether with scripture nor natural
reason / ye begin ta rail against me and say that i am therefore an enemi of
Christis cross because i will not suffer the cross nether to be worshipped with
outward worship nor inward. If that i be therefore an enemy to Christ / then is
almighty god an enemy to Christis cross for he does the same that i do / and it
that i do i learned it of god / Se now as ye fall in to the vice that ye accuse
me of / sum time vsyng the cross for a piece of silver and other whiles for the
Passion of Christ / where unto if he be not an enemy / that makes hallowed
salt equal in pour / gyuyng unto it Salvation of both body and soul / let
learned men judge / Is there any better mean in the hole world to set out the
glory of the cross then the word of god? And this mean do we so exercise and
defend that ye moke us and call us talkers / Then / like unto a son of the
shameless hoar of Babylo ye lie where ye say that i would extinct all the means
that should set out the glory of the cross / Where as ye compare me unto the
Turc which forbiddethe open shows and preaching of Christ / i meruel with
what face ye call me Turkish in that behaff when as ye your self forbad the
players of london (as it was toldme) to play any mo plays of Christ / but of
robin hode and little Johan / and of the Parliament of birds and such other
trifles. Now sir bishop which of us ij is more like the Turk? The Turks law
is partly drawn out of Moses law / partly out of Christis gospel / partly out
of mahumettis fantases and your law that ye bisshoppes of England now use in
the church is partly taken out of Moses law / partly out the gospel and
partly out of the popes decrees and traditiones / for with Moses ye use outward
sacrifices to take sin away / hallow temples and vestimentes and purifi wymen /
with Christ ye baptize and read the gospel / with the pope ye crepe to the
cross forbid prestes to mari and occupi infinite swarms of ceremonies / And we
receive no manis doctrine but the word of god alone. Therefore your doings ar
more lyte the Turks procedynges then ouris ar where as ye accuse use with the
Turk for forbiddyng of preaching / ye declare your spret to be inconstant and
contrari to it self and therefore to be of the deuel for ye accuse us a little
here after for preaching to miche. Ye blame use fasly where ye say that we would
have you se nothing in the remembrance of Christ / for we would that all the
people that can read should look and se in the iiij. Evangelists Christis dedis
and sermones and thereby call Christ to their remembra^ces / we would that the
hole church of Christ / no man nor woman except should both se and receive
the sacrament of Christ most precious blood / And ye lot up the word of god
for all the hole year from the common people and command all images to be covered
as long as lent lasts / and suffere no lay man to receive with the prestes
the sacrament of Christis blood in the remembrane of the blood of Christ which
was shed for us / therefore ye ar the blotters out of Christ's memori and not
we. We would have Christ's mean / that he ordened to hold his remembrance with
in the church hole / that is the hole Sacraments and the hole word of god /
to dwell richely in Christis hole church / and ye mangle and geld the
Sacraments / and like made men / as it does apere vndestandyng Paulis word
richely / among rich men / will suffer non but gentle men and rich men read the
scripture which might an hunderd thousand times better and with les ieperdy put
us in remembrance of Christ then your forbidden and horish images do / And so
ye do acordyng to the proverb stele agous and for her stik down a fether /
when ye take Christis word away and one dele of his Sacraments and instead
there of / set up blind blokes and dum ceremonies. Will we not let you smell
nothing in memori of Christ / because we speak against anoyntyng of deed
carcases / and witched water? Who ordened that such stynkyng oil as youres is
should be a remembrance of Christ by smellyng of it? and that salted water
which has no smell at all / the first day / and with in six days that it is
salted yet stynketh shall by the smellyng of it put us in remembrance of
Christ? Will we not let you taste nothing in memory of Christ because we speak
against the coniuryng of salt / What should we do with your salt when as it is
al un sauery and / has no taste of the word of god? Christ says that salt
when it is unsavory is good for nothing but to be cast out of doors to be
treden with mennis fete. We use to give the Sacrament to all that will receive
it / every month and in sum places every sunday in the remembrance of our
savior Christ and ye give a bit of common bread in the remembrance of the
Sacrament / who holds Christis memori better? What ie wish and dull
Pharisees ar these that either will not / or can not be cantent with the holy
word of Christ and his Sacraments to bring Christ to their memories that
they may thynk on him except they smell sum thing to remembr* him and taste sum
thing also to remember him thereby / I never red of more fleshy Pharisees in my
life then these be. These be the most forgitful fellows that i have heard of. To
that where ye say that we speak of a supper and would handle it like a drynkyng
/ i answer that we do not only drink but also eat at Christis supper / and so
handle it / as Christ taught us in his word / with out any players garments
or popish knakkes and folishe iuglyng toys which after the ordinance of the
pope ye put to it / ye handle it not lyk Christis supper but like a doggis
dinner / and both do it and say it a mis / In sayng that we would have all thing
in talkyng and would shit up all your senses saving hearing / ye do nothing
ellis but mok Christ / which ordened no other means to in gendre faith in us
and to call us to remembrance of him / saving only his word and his Sacraments
/ Because ye thynk that Chyristis word and Sacrament are not sufficient for the
purposes above rehearsed / and reken your selves wyser then Christ / ye have
for a great part put a way Christ's ordinances and set other as ye thynk
better in theyrstede / to put us in remembrance of Christ / and to stir us up
unto godlynes / It is like that if ye had been living in Christis time with your
fellow Pharisees and had heard Christ sayng unto his Disciples go in to all the
world and preach the gospel to every creature / ye would have laid what
means this man so ernestly to give commandment of preaching and teaching /
belyke this man will have all things don with talkyng / and not with such
laudable and semely ceremonies as Moses and our for fathers have devised /
Where ye say the Mark that we shote at / is to extinct Christ and the orders
of the world / i answer* that we go not about to extinct Christ but to set him
up whom ye with your wordly orders have long holden down as mich as lay in
you. Christ is not bilded upon your polytike orders of the world as ye suppose
/ nether at the falling of them should he fall which is bylded upon a stronger
fundacion / for we have put down viij. of your orders of the world / iiij.
orders of freres / ij. of monks and ij of chanones / and yet is not there with
Christ extinct but rather brought more to light / There remain yet ij orders
of the world in England un put down / that is the order of po^pose and Popish
Bisshoppes / and Grieve freres / which if they were put dou^ as well as the
other ar put down before / i reke^ that there should be no kingdom in the world
where in Christ should more reygne then in England.


The rescuer But to the purpos of the words worship in English and Adoro in
Latin may be the phrase in scripture / admit both the significationes of godly
service and reverent behauour / shall i say that where godly honor is forbidden
reverent behauour is also forbidden / and by altering the signification iuggle
and mok with the people / of which sort be manny of their arguments made /
afterward as i shall sho in their places. Scripture sumtyme, by the outer
gesture express in speech the godly honor as in kissyng and knelyng / And not
because kissyng and knelyng is the godly honor / but because it was the
expressyng of the inward affection / with which when kissyng and knelyng is
joined directly to the thing kissed or kneled unto it / is in deed idolatri /
But if kissyng and knelyng be seperat from that opinion / then is it not
idolatri / for as true worship is only in sprete and proceeds from the heart /
so does idolatri proceed from the heart also. So that in only kissyng or knelyng
can not be idolatri / as this gentle man would go about to persuade by such
Logical collation as he would seem clerkly to make upon the significatioo of
the word.


The hunter Althyng is to be understand acordyng unto the matter that is in
hands / ye wot that i entreated this question / whither the cross might be
worshipped with knelyng crepyng and kissyng of it or no then answer i that to
what soever image or lyknes the godly honor is forbidden to be given / reverent
behauour is forbidden to be given unto the same / for allmyghty god in hes
words forbids both godly honor and reverent behauour to begyuen to images.
Non incuruabis te eis neque coals eas, Thou shall nether bow thy self unto them
nether give godly worship unto them / your question is therefore like your self
unlearned and full either of ignorance inscripture or of will full malice against
the truth. As concerning iugglyng with the signification of words / which
ye lay falsely unto my charge / he that knows your manners and mine both /
would thynk that you ar the right iugler and not i / ye iugled ouce at poulis
cross in an open audience / deorsum in to retrorsum, and in your institution of
a Christen man ye iugled quite away from the second commandment non incuruabis
te, and out of the properties that belong to a Bishop ye iugled away unius
uxoris maritum esse, on palm sunday ye iuggle wylow bows in to date trees /
who is nou the iuggler? If that kyssyng and knelyng be no godly honor but only
the expressyng of the inward affection / when as goddis honor is goddis
service / then it follows that knelyng and kyssyng for as miche as they are not
goddis honor they are not goddis service / then they that knele to the cross on
good friday and kiss it serve not god / there with / why call you then this
crepyng and knelyng goddis service? Whi compel ye theu all men to the crepyng
to the cross as to goddis service when as here in this book ye grant that it
is non of goddis service? Where as ye say that when kyssyng and knelyng is
directly joined with the inward affection to the thing kissed or kneled unto /
it is idolatri but if knelyng and kissyng be separated from that opinion it is
no idolatri / I ax you if that ye should kys the kyngis hand and kneled to him
with your inward affection joined direct unto the kyngis hyghenes / should ye
commit idolatri in deed? If ye did the same unto Christ should ye also commit
idolatri in deed? If that ye answer that ye mean of kissyng of images and
knelyng to them / then have ye declared plainly at length that it is no
idolatri to kis an image it self and to knele to it self / if the inward
affection be away from the kissyng and knelyng / but i have proved before that
knelyng and kyssyng of images is worshippyng of images / therefore ye hold that
it is no idolatri to worship images with outward reverence / so that the heart
be separat from the worshippyng. A little before like a crasty for ye said these
words i may use reverent behauour before the image of the cross / as thoghe ye
would not that certain wise men should know that you held that the cross it self
should be worshipped / and now ye say that when kissyng and kneling is separate
from the opinion / scilicet of the cross / then is it no idolatri / that is to
wit to kiss the cross it self and to bow to it / your mind is known for all
your dissemblyng and your crafty maskyng / All thoghe i have fufficiently
before confuted this your opinion that aman may worship images with outward
worship which ye call reverent behauour / with the autorite of the second
commandment of god which forbids both the worship of the heart and of the
body to begyuen unto images yet i will bring an example out the holy scripture
to streyngthen and make more clear my former confutation. Nebuchadnezar as it
is written in the third chapter of Daniel / made agolden image lx. cubits hie /
and six cubits broad / and commanded all men that were with in his dominion in
pain of does to worship this image with outward worship infallyng down
before it / and making such gestures as worshippers of images use to make / But
Sadrach / Mesach / and Abednego would not worship it / the king said unto them.
Is it true that ye do no godly service unto my god / nether will worship the
golden image which i have set up? If that ye will yet fall down and worship the
image which i have made (ye shall have pardon) but if ye will not worship it /
the same hour shall ye be casten in to aburnyng furnace of fire / to whom
they answered / o king we would that thou should know / that we do no godly honor
to thy gods / nether / will we worship with outward worship the image that
thou haste set up. And then the king caused them all iij. to be casten in to
the burning furnace / but god delivered the^ wonderously out of the fire safe
and sound / Now do i ax you whether these iij. men might have given reverent
hebauour as bowyng kissyng and knelyng to this image / with out dedly sin / and
might have directed they: hearts unto god / that the king knew not of / and so
have escaped the burning furnace / or no? If ye answer that they might have
given reverent behauour unto the kyngis image with out dedly sin and might have
directed the inward worship of their hearts unto the living god / that the king
knew not of / and so with out ieperdy might have escaped the furnace / then was
these iij. euel men / and did break goddis commandment / which says thou shall
not tempt thy lord god / that is thou shall not put thy self in ieperdy where
no need requirethe / and thou shall require no miraculous help of god where as
their ar natural means enough. But if ye answer that all thoghe they had
directed their hearts unto god that never the less they could not with out
dedly sin have kissed that image and kneled bowed and given out ward worship
unto it / and that they were allowed of god because they would in no wise worship
that golden image / then ye do noughtely and displease god in doing it to an
image that good men and allowed of god had lever be burned in a furnace of fire
then to do to an image / They would not worship a mannis image with outward
reverence / and ye both do outward reverence unto images and in pain of death
compel other men as Nebuchadnezar did / to worship a mannis image. If the iij.
iewe^ that chused rather to be burnt then to worship a mannis image / were of
god / then ye that both worship your selves / and compel other / in pain of
burning to worship a mannis image / with outward reverence / ar of the deuel /
If ye excuse and say that it is not alone a mannis image but both goddis image
and mannis / i say that the image of god in the second commandment is as
myche forbidden to be made and worshipped with any kind of worship as mannis
is / for these ar the words of the second commandment / thou shall make the no
graven image nether any lyknes of of any thing in heaven above nether in earth
be nethe nether of any thing that is in the waters under the earth thou shall
nether humble thy self unto them nether shall thou do any godly service unto
them god is in heaven therefore his image is as well forbidden to be made (if it
were possible to make an image of him) and to be worshipped with outward
reverence as amannis images which is in earth is forbidden to be made and
worshipped. Have ye not now seduced the hole realm teaching all men there in
that they may worship the cross with outward reverent behauour as with knelyng
and kissyng when as it is proved open idolatri? Where ye say as true worship is
only in sprete / and proceeds from the heart so does idolatri proceed from the
heart also / it follows that all your sensyng / knelyng crowchyng / crossyng /
syngyng of messes dirges mattens and euensonges which are don in and by the body
ar no true goddis service but falls service. And against your comparison i set
this comparison that follows here / As the chief confessyng of Chyiste is in
the heart and with good warkes and not withstandyng if a man will not confess
Christ, to be the son of god with his mouth when the confession of the mouth
is required / but deni Christ with his mouth / or confesses an other to be
Christ then Jesus / Christ shall deni him before his father in heaven / so
althoghe the worshippyng of an image with the heart be the wors idolatri / yet
for all that / the outward worshippyng of an image with the body with outward
gesture must nedis be idolatri / for what soever is contrari to the second
commandment must nedis be idolatri / but to bow and knele unto an image is
contrari to the second commandment / therefore it is idolatri where soever ye
fayn your heart to be / Answer me if it pleas you to this question / Denied
peter Christ with his heart / or with his mouth alon? If he denied him with his
mouth alone and yet that denying was dedly sin / then if a man should worship an
image with his body alone and not with his heart he should committ dedly sin for
as Christ will have both the confession of the heart and also of the mouth / so
does he forbid both to worship an image with your heart and also with your
body. Where ye say that in only kissyng and knelyng cannot be idolatri i grant
it is true as long as they are applied to nothing / but when kissyng and knelyng
ar applied to images whereto god forbad the^ to be applied / in only kissyng of
images and knelyng to the^ / may idololatri be committed. But teach us now
great master doctor how can a man break goddis commandment / and yet love god
with his heart and have his heart with god? When as Christ says he that loves
me will keep my word / Then how can a man break this commandment / bow not thy
self unto images and yet love god with his heart whose commandment he breake^h
with his body? Let therefore learned men judge how wisely you have made your
distinction inseparatyng the breakyng of godpis commandment from the hatred of
god / Is a ma^nis heart their where he hates? Nay A manys heart can not be with
him whom he hates / But a worshipper of images with bowyng and knelyng
hatethe god wihls he breaks his co^mandme^t / therefore / the heart of him that
boweth and kneleth unto images can not be with god.


The rescuer And yet to streyngthen his argument he brings in the deuellis
sayng as he does in other places to set forth his madness / but what should i
resone with this man of cre pyng to the cross / that goes about to prove right
wisly / that we may have no images at all which if he cold do / it should serve
well for his purpos to prove that we ought not to worship the cross / if he
could prove that antecede^t, his consequent were insoluble.


The hunter They that in England had lever eat accornes then good wheat bread
and will not change their old mumpsimus with the new sumpsimus thynk that ye ar
the greatest clerk in England / but every man that is not blind may se that ye
ar shamfully unlearned in divinity / and not able to answer any thing
apparently well to an argument / and therefore trifle like a wanton boy and /
answer never a word to my argument / And because all men may se your hye
learning i will reherce my argument / that they may compare it with your answer.
If it be not lawful to make an image and to have an image it is not lawful to
worship an image had and made. But the scripture forbids to make and have
images / then myche more it forbids to worship them / This was my argument /
and thus did i prove by sufficient autorite of the holy scripture that it was
not lawful to make and to have images. It is written xx. chapter of Exodus /
Thou shall make the no graven image nether any lyknes of any thing that is in
heaven a boue nether in earth benethe nether of them that are in the waters
under the earth / thou shall nether bow thy self unto them nor do any service
or godly honor unto them. The same words ar written in the fifth chapter of the
Deuteronomi And Leuitici the xxvj. it is written make you no idols nether any
graven image / nether set up any standing image for you / nether shall ye set
any figured stone in your land that ye may worship it / Allmyghty god says
also Deuteronomij the iiij. chapter these words by his seruante Moses. Ye came
and stood under the hill / but the hill burned in afyre to the mids of heaven /
where was darkness clouds and mist / and the lord spak unto you out from the
mids of the fire / and ye heard in deed the voice of the words but saw no
image saving the voice alone / Therefore even as ye love your own soul so
diligently take ye head (for ye have seen no image at all on that day that god
spak with you in the hill / out of the mids of the fire) lest by chance ye
should do amiss in making you a graven image what soever lyknes it bears of
aman or a woman / or the lyknes of any best that is on the earth / or the
lyknes of any fethered fowel in the air or the form of any thing that crepeth
upon the earth or the lyknes of any fish that is in the waters under the earth
/ And lest thou should lift up thy eyes in to heaven and se the son and the
moune and the sterres with the hole company of heaven and fall down / and show
reverent behauour or do any godly service unto them / which the lord thy god
has given unto all people that are under the hole heaven. And in the xxvii.
Acursed be the man who so ever he be that makes either a graven or a casten
image / the abomination of the lord / the werk of the artificer / and sets
it in a pryuy place. The wise man in the xiij. chapter of his book curses also
both the image and the image maker. Thus did i reason with you with these places
of holy scripture / Which places if ye would have ansuered to i should have
obtained it that i desired that is / that these places at the least proved
substancially that it is not lawful to make any image and to give any worship
at al to it / nether knelyng nor bowyng nether any inward worship of the heart
/ for even so ernestly as the images ar forbidden to be made so er nestly ar
they forbidden to be worshipped with outward gesture and with inward honor /
If that ye had answered that images had been forbidden to be made either to be
worshipped with outward worship or with inward / i would have concluded that
when the image of the cross is an image that ye do wrong to make it / and to
give any worship at all unto it / either inward or outward / But ye knowing
aforeha^d of this conclusion / and wantyng wepens to avoid it / answer nothing
to my argument / but say that if i could prove my antecedent that we might have
no images that then it followed that we might not worship the cross / as ye would
have said / so long shall it be lawful to worship the cross as ye cannot prove
that ye should have no image / but that shall be ever unproven / therefore for
ever shall it be lawful to worship the cross. Then seeing that i perceive that ye
will not leave the worshyppyng of images so long as ye have them / to drive away
the worshyppyng of images i am compelled to labor to prove that we that are
Christian me^ should have no images at all in the place of worshyppyng / and
prayer / namely their where as images have been worshipped may be worshipped /
and in such places where as the worshippyng of images with outward gesture is
ernestly defended / ye say that if i could prove my antecedent that my
conseque^t were insoluble / Is there any more sufficient probation the^ the holy
word of god is? I have brought vj. places out of the word of god where in all
me^ ar forbidden to make images / then have i sufficiently proved that it is
not lawful to make images. If ye require the sum of altogether in an argument
thus do i make my argument / What soever allmyghty god forbids is unlawful /
but almighty god forbids to make images / therefore it is unlawful to make
images / ca^ ye have any playner forbiddyng the^ this is / non facies tibi
sculptile, how shall make the no graue^ image? Is not my antecede^t yet proved?
Now let us se what places of scripture ye can bring to prove that Christen men
may have images. In your institution writing upon the second commandment ye
say these words / Thou shall not have any graven image to the intent to do any
godly honor unto it. By these words we are not forbidden to make or to have
similitudes or images / but only we be forbidden to make or to have them to the
intent to do godly honor unto them / as it appareth in the xxvj. chapter of
Leuiticus. These ar your words All that are learned men may se how shamfully ye
play the thief here and how unlearnedly ye handle the scriptures for these
words of the xxvj. chapter of Leuiticus / non facietis ut adoretis, ar no
other wise to be expounded then these words of the iiij. chapter of the
Deuteronomi / non uidist is imaginem ne forte decepti faciatis, ne adoretis and
colatis. Therefore where allmyghty god says thou shall make the no image that
thou may worship it / is as miche to say as thou shall make the no image lest
at any time / thou may chance to worship it / Exposition of scripture by it
self has hither to always been allowed of wise and learned men / and is and
will be allowed / then if ye be learned and wise ye will allow this my exposition
/ But i pray you where learned ye this new Logik of a negative antecedent to
bring in an affirmative consequent? for thus ye gather i may not make an image
to worship it ergo i may make an image / scilicet to be a laymannis book /
There is a father which has a child which has wounded him self often times
with a sharp poynted knyfe / he forbids his sone to wear any more a sharp
poynted knyfe / lest he should hurt him self there with / the child with the
next money that he gitteth byeth him self a sharp poynted knyfe / and wears
it / the father blames the child for breakyng of his commandment the child
alledgyng that he wears his knyfe to defend him self from dogs / says
that he breaks not his fathers commandment / and that he wears the knyfe
not to hurt him self with all / but to defend him from dogs there with.
Whether breaks this child his fathers commandment or no? Whether should this
argument of the child follow well or no? I am forbidden to wear a sharp poynted
knyfe lest i should hurt my self with all / ergo i may wear a sharp poynted
knyfe to defend my self with all. There is an other father which has many
sons / and he says unto his sons i co^mande you all in the name of god
that none of yowly with any of my servants lest ye catch the pox of them /
Judas lyethe with dromo which has the french pox as all the other servants
have / when the father blamed Judas for ly inge with dromo / were this excuse
of the childs to be allowed or no? father ye forbad me to ly with any of your
servants to the intent that i should catch the french pox / but ye forbad me
not to ly with the servants to learn of them / all be it dromo have the
pokkes and many have taken the pox of him / i am not such a fool as to take
the^ of him i can keep my self well enoghe / Moreover Dromo is well learned and
can teach me many good lessones and your steward both counseled me and
commanded me to ly with him that i might / as i lay with him / learn to speak
latin / Would not a wise father say thou foolish boy / why haste thou broken my
commandment? Art thou wiser then i am? how can thou lie with him that has
the french pokkes runnyng upon him and not be infected there with? How can
thou avoid the pox and ly with him / the which thing all other that lay with
him hither to could not avoid? What promis or privilege have thou mor then
other / granted the of god / that thou may ly with him with out ieperdy when
all other take the pox of him? When thou haste no promis nor privilege of god /
and have put thy self in ieperdy of taking the pox with out any need / thou
haste both broken goddis commandment in temptyng of god and also mine which for
bad the to ly with any of my servants / As for the stewardes counsel and
commandment it is not to be kept when my commandment is contrari. As touching
the learning that thou say thou may learn of him / what madness is it to
learn it of an unlearned pokky driuel with in auoidable ieperdi of the
french pox / that thou may with out ieperdy learn of they elder brother /
whom i have appointed to be thy Scoolmaster who is an hunderd sold better
learned then dromo is / Thynk ye then that this use of images in the church
which has been the occasion of mich abominable idolatri as the images lately
burned and broken in England do testifi / will be allowed of god the father in
the day of judgment? i thynk no. Was not images in the church a certain
season before they were worshipped? And fell not the people by having of them
to the worshippyng of them? then can they not be h^d with out ieperdy as the
images lately broken in England bear witness / If they were no peril of idolatri
in having of images what neded Johan to have said in his first Epistel beware
of images / The wise man sayethe that images ar made to the iniuri of god to be
stumblyng blokkes or mous trappes for mennis souls / and to snare the fete of
the simple in / and that / Initiuns scortandi excogitatio simulacrorumest, and
corundem inuentio uitae corruptela, Neque erant ab initio nec in aeternum
manebunt. The fyndyng out of images is the beginning of fornication / and the
invention of the same is the destruction of life / Nether have they been from
the beginning nether shall they continue for ever. Then the chirch can not have
images with out ieperdy. And that we need no images in Christ's church it is
casy to prove for the scripture teaches the church all thing that is
necessari for it / What thing can a blind bloke or stone do with ieperdy but
a preacher of goddis word can do the same? Can an image teach any example of
faith of hope charity / humilite / liberalite patience or of any other virtue
but a Christen preacher both can do the same and does the same manyfoldes
myche better and with out any peril of spiritual fornication / How can an image
teach faith with her example which has non at all / and when as true
faith cummeth of hearing of goddis word how can the dum image teach faith
which cannot speak one word of god? How shall the image teach' charity that
loves no man? How shall the image teach humilite that boweth to no man / or
liberalite that gives nothing? or patience which suffers nothing? Then if
ye would let the scripture go abroad in to every mannis hand / and make your
prestes as dilligent in preaching as they are bysy in un profitable plays and
shows of ceremonies / or if ye would admit none to be prestes but such that
were as able to teach / as blind images ar / we should need no images at all in
the church / no more then / there was in the primative church. Then when as
images cannot be in the church without ieperdi of idolatri as ye bear witness
your self which will so long give outward worship unto images which is idolatri
/ as ye have images in the church / and we need them not / and may want them
well / and to put one self in ieperdy where no need is / is to tempt god / and
that is sin / it follows that it is not lawful to have images in the church /
namely where their worship is defended and where men have used and use still to
abuse them / and give to them outward worship as ye do. These few reasones have
i brought be cause i would not be long / i could have brought out examples out of
histories and allowed writers and out of the civil laws of Emperoures to have
proved that images have been forbidden to be in the church / but i differ them
until an other time / If i se not the abuses of images taken away intendyng to
bring them with all the reasones that i can make. Bring ye now as many resones
for the having and outward worship of images as i have brought against them or
ellis chyde out your part / or procure that my book may be forbidden to be red
that ye ned to take no such importable pain upon you or ellis grant that ye
have been deceived and defended unlawful doctrine.


The rescuer And so is not his last concludyng argument / which he calls him
self not easy to assoyle / which is this we might not worship the angel Peter
and Poul being the better / ergo not the cross being of less estimation then
Peter or Paul / I to assoyl the matter easily say the man uses sophistri in
the word worship / for if he take worship to signifi reverent behauour then i
say that the antecedent is false / and if he will it signifi godly honor it is
trewly said / but nothing to the purpose /.


The hunter If that to say that a^ man use the sophistri in a word not able to
prove it / were a sufficient solution of an argument indede it were an easy
thing to solute an argument / but it is not so easy to solute my argument as ye
think ye know that i disputed with you before of outward worship / of the
cross / and that ye would have it given to the cross and that i held that it
should not be given to the cross your distinction is therefore vayn and interlaced
with a lie / And as for my antecedent i prove it thus / No true servant of god
forbids any thing that is lawful / but Peter Paul and the angel forbad men
to fall down before them and to do such outward worship unto them as ye do to
the cross / and they were true servants of god / therefore it was not lauful for
men to fall down before them and to do such outward worship unto them as ye do
unto the cross / Moreover / either must ye say that Cornelius and Johan were
damnable idolaters / or ellis that they gave only outward worship unto the^
whom they took not for god but for / their superioures set in hyer dignite
autorite then they were / for to fall down before a man or angel and to give to
the man or the angel godly honor is plain idolatri / which honor if Cornelius
or Johan have given unto Peter and to the angel / it can not be denied but they
were idolaters.


The rescuer For nether Paul nether the cross can be worshipped with godly
honor.


The hunter If that a calf made of gold may be worshipped with godly honor /
and an other man may be worshipped with godly honor / the cross and Paul may be
worshipped with godly honor but the golden calf that aaron made was worshipped
with godly honor exodi the xxxij when as the people said unto it Behold o
Israel here ar thy gods which have brought the out of Egypt. That images
have been worshipped with godly honor / also it is plain by the first chapter
of the Epistel to the Romans. Where as it is written / When they believed that
they were wise / they were made / fools and have changed the glory of the in
corruptible god / by the lyknes of an image of a corruptible man. In the xij.
chapter of the acts the people which spak thus of Herodis voice / It is the
voice of god and not of man / gave unto him godly worship / and because he gave
not the glory unto god he was eaten to death with worms. Then may the image
of the cross and Paul be worshipped with godly honor / furthermore what should
allmyghty god need to forbid men to give godly honor unto men and images if men
and images cold not be worshipped (as ye say) with godly honor? Let the^ that
have autorite to inquere of heresies look whether this ma^nis sayng is heresi
or no / If it be holde^ stiffly it must nedis be heresi for it is co^trari to
the open text of the scripture.


The rescuer In speaking against holly water / which he entendeth to impugn /
the mannis malice putrefieth for lak of salt / which he cannot abide to be
sanctified by the invocation of the name of god.


The hunter? In my former book / i have sufficiently confuted the deuellish
coniuryng of hally water / and uncovered the crafty iugglyng of the papists /
which on while / said that they held it still in the church in the remembrance
of Christ's blood / and an other while / to drive deuelles away / to put venial
sins away / and to heal all syknesses. The cause why that this proctor of the
pope manteyneth this hally water so er nestly is / because his holy father
alexander ordened it and commanded all popish prestes as gardener is to make
it not to be a remembrance of Christ's blood and of our baptim but to purge
men from sin as his words that ordened it do testifi in the book of the popis
decrees / Aquam sale conspersam* populis benedicimus etc. We bliss water
sprinkled with salt for the people / that they sprinkled with it / may be
hallowed and clenged. The which thing we command all sacrificers or prestes
likewise to do / for if the ashes of a calfe sprynkled with blood hallowed and
clenged the people / myche more water sprynkled with salt and sanctified with
godly prayers / holloweth and clengeth the people. These words speaks pope
Alexander with many mo all e like vain and superstitious / which every man
that has any know ledg die in the scripture can easily confute / Now because i
cannot abide this popish ordinance that your father made after your judgment
i putrefi for lak of salt. If that ye would drink the water as ye do wine / and
eat the salt at your table / i could be well content that when ye say grace that
ye sanctified them with the invocation of goddis name with other meats and
drinks which ye eat and drink / But when ye conjure water and salt and abuse
goddis creatures to other purposes then god ordened them / i nether will nor
can abide your shamful abusion.


The rescuer With out learning he calls it coniuryng / and with out with
despiceth the good words.


The hunter Iuglers and coniurers be cause their names ar heinous and hated and
their occupations ar unlawful / will be called pretty conueyers and exorcistes /
So master gardener be cause ye ar a coniurer and your occupation is shameful
and forbidden in the scripture / lest ye should be known / of the hole realm
to be a coniurer / ye will be called an exorcist / and ye will have your work
called an exorcisme / and all that in Greek that English people should not know
what ye be / Therefore he that calls you a coniurer and your work coniuryng /
must be unlearned / ye writing upon the first commandment disalow coniuryng /
and he that made your book in Latin / turned coniuryng in to Exorcismum, was he
unlearned therefore? Ye ar so wonderfully learned that ye will teach the
scolares of cambridge to pronunce Greek / and ye will teach me to speak
Grekish English. But if your lordship would put of your miter / and be as well
content to be taught that that ye can not as year arroga^tly besy to teach it
that ye have not learned / ye might learn / that if (...) in Greek / be a
coniurer in English as ye cannot deny but it is / (...) is to conture / and
(...) is conjuring / Read the xix. chapter of the acts in Greek and there shall
ye find that this lesson that i have taught you is true. Then when as ye are not ashamed to occupi co^iuryng of the deuel out of water and salt / and say in
Greek the word of your occupation Exorcizo, ^e that is i conjure the or charge
the / whiar ye ashamed to be called a co^iurer? If the name be euel the deed is
wors / Then if ye will be no more called a coniurer / have of your coniuryng
and i shall lay away the name of a coniurer / or ellis the deed and the name
must go together. As for your good words that ye say that i unwisely despise /
i have proved before to be words all full of deuelishnes and idolatri where
fore i meruel that ye can for shame call the^ good / and can nether answer to
my reason nor yet prove them good with any scripture.


The rescuer If this man had been by Christ / when he anointed the blind
mannis eyes with clay / he would have asked him / whihe made clay an other god
beside him self / And when the woman was heled of her diseas / by touching of
his garment / why he made his garment an other god / and when Christ answered
to diverse their faith made the^ hole / he made every ma^nis faith a special
savior after this noble clerkis doctrine / which is so blinded with malice /
to desproue all that he redeth that he fyndeth not in scripture. Many and many
times that instrumental or occasionatiue concurrent or ministerial cause has
attribute unto it in speech the hole effect / with out prejudice or blasphemi
of many gods or many sauioures as this best pretendynge to be learned / would
seem to be able to persuade. I shall only use this one place of scripture.
Does saint Paul (answer to this and ye will) go a bout to make many sauioures
when he writes to Timothe / Do this and then thou shall sane thy self and
other / all that is good to man is wrought by god in Christ for Christ and by
Christ / where he in all creatures may do such ministerial service / as it
shall please god / and that all may serve man to the health of both hody and
soul / Good men by the grace purchased by Christ dare boldly pray god / and
have don from the beginning with prayer and calling for the help of god and
expulsion of the deuel in all thing / the deuel cannot abide hally water.


The hunter Because ye ar a coniurer and can rays the deuel at your pleasure and
compel him with your Exorcismes (lo now i speak gardners Grekish English) both
to tell you what thing shall be don and what thing would have been don / ye can
by the help of the deuel that ye Exorcis (plain men of the cuntre call it
conjure) tell what i would have don if i had been by Christ. But if ye were no
coniurer / and no better aquaynted with the deuel then i am / how could ye
tell / what i would have said so long ago unto Christ? Does it follow that if
i had been by Christ when he healed the blind mannis eyes with clay / and
healed many both in body and soul with / faith that i would have axed him why
he made mo gods beside him self / because i say that ye make a god of salted
water whils ye trust to obteyn by it salvation of both body and soul? As who
say likewise as Christ used clay as a mean to heal the syknes of the body /
and faith as a mean to heal both body and soul / so may ye use salted water
/ to be a mean to obteyn / the health of both body and soul / By what
autorite make ye salted water to be means of the salvation of body and soul?
What good man has found out this short way to heaven / that salted water shall
heal both body and soul? If that ye say / likewise as Christ used the clay
which had no such natural properti given it / to heal the blyndmannis eyes
w^^he / so may we now use salted water / to heal all diseases their with both
hot and cold / althoghe we know that god has given no such natural
properti unto it / and that which it wants of nature we will obteyn by
prayer / To this i say first that Christ which could have healed the blind
man with out any outward mean / used clay as a mean that the miracle might be
more evident and better remembered / and in the healyng of this blind man he
showed ij. miracles at one time / first in healyng the blind man which fact
was a boue nature / and in healyng him by clay being a mean that had no
natural pour to heal such a diseas with all / for a miracle is a strange and a
rare work above nature / Christ had good cause to work such miracles and
wonders / for the jews would not have received his doctrine and believed that he
had been of god / if he had not wroght such wonders / Therefore Christ to
purches credence unto his doctrine which was thought unto the jews a new
learning and not of god / was driven to work miracles / But what need have ye
now to work miracles? does not all men and wymen in England believe that
Christ is of god and that his doctrine is true? ye work a great miracle if
that ye heal all diseases with salt / and yet a greater miracle when ye can
make the soul receive salted water and save it thereby / for it is not only
above nature that ye go about but also contrari to nature. Then when ye need
now no miracles / and never the less go about to work miracles whils by oue
little receyt ye take in hand to heal all the diseases of both body and soul /
your prayers ar folishe and wikked where in ye desire god to helped you to work
your miracles / and therefore labor in vain / and bring never to pass that ye
go about / your prayers ar wikked for they are to the disshonor of Christ for
they require that salted water should do as much as Christ can do / Also when
as of like things is one judgment / and like prayers unto youres / ar wikked
it folowethe that youres ar also wikked / By the same autorite that ye have
brought water and salt in to the church and desire god that they may drive
deuelles away / take away venial sins / and be salvation of both body and
soul / to all them that receive them / may ye bring in to the church a calf
and a sow and / say allmyghty god / we beseech the grant us that this calf and
this sow may chase away deuelles and take away venial sins / and may be
salvation of both body and soul / to al them that eat of them / By the same
autorite may ye bring in to the church every sunday a dishe full of milk and
make this prayer o all mygty and everlasting god we hymbly beseech the / grant
us that thou will wit safe so to hallow and sanctifi* this milk thy creature /
that who soever suppeth of it by the invocation of thy name may have pour to
draw out of what soever tether he list / so miche milk as he will desire / for
as far as it is contrari unto the nature of a sow and a calfe to chase deuelles
away to purge venial sins / and to be salvation to a mannis soul / and as far
as it is contrari to the nature of a tether to give milk / so miche is it
contrari to the nature of salt to heal hot burning agues and to the nature
water to hele dropses and palses and to them both mixed together to be health of
both body and soul / your prayer is therefore wikked / then is it no meruel that
ye never, obteyn that ye ax. How can those prayers be other then wikked / where
in the name of god is called upon in vayn? Christ did not hele the soul of the
blind man with clay / but only he delivered him from his blyndenes with it /
therefore it follows not because / he used clay against blyndenes that ye may
use salted water to heal both the body and the soul / Where as it is said that
many were saved by the faith of Jesus Christ that is no other thing to say then
that many were saved by Christ whom they took hold upon / by faith / then is
not faith an other savior beside god / but it ledeth us unto god / And when as
god is our savior and he draws us unto him by the mean of faith / when i
say that faith justifies i mean that god justifies us by faith / Therefore
when as faith is a mean ordened of god when i say faith saves i exclude not
god / admitting his instrument / nether make i any other savior but him that
works by his appointed instrument. But when as salted water is no instrument
of our god where with he works our salvation / and yet ye give salvation unto
it / it follows that after your judgment it is either a god it self or sum
instrument of sum other god which works salvation by it. And where ye ax
whether Paul makes many sauioures where as he says that Timothe redyng
exortyng and techyng of the word of god shall save him self / i answer that
Paul makes no mo sauioures but god alone / for he attributes salvation unto
the instruments whereby god works salvation. When as David killed golias
with a slinge / he that says that Dauidis sling killed golias / says not /
their was (...) sleers of golias / be side David / for the slyng was the proper
wepen that David killed golias with / and so is Timothe goddis instrument /
whereby he wrought the salvation of Timothe / and of them that believed his
prechyng / But if a man say that a lance killed golias the same man makes an
other killer of golias beside David / for the lance was none of the wepens that
David killed golias with / So he that gives salvation instrumentally to any
instruments which god has only appointed and used to work salvation by /
makethe no mo sauioures but god alone / but he that gyuethe salvation unto
other instruments then ar peculiare and proper unto god which nether god
appointed / nether at any time has used / nether will allow for his instruments
makes an other savior beside god / Now have i made you an answer to your
question that / saint Paul makes not many sauioures / Now what will ye gather
of this answer? Will ye gather that salted water may as well be an instrument of
salvation / as Timothe was? If this be your gatheryng i gathere thus of you
again that ye hold / that the pope has as myche autorite to ordeyn salted
water to be an instrument of salvation / as allmyghty god had / to make Tymothe
an instrument of salvation by the redyng and prechyng of his word / which if
ye do it is more tree that ye ar a Papiste / then the deuel hates your falsely
called holy water / which at his motion was by pope Alexander brough in to the
church to the mokkage and great injury of Christ's blood / Mark reder whither
these defenders of ceremonies as i have said often do any thing against abuses but
dissemble / til they may find a better time / v. year ago master gardener
durst not for his ears / have defended holy water any other wise but as a
putter of us in remembrance of Christ's blood and of our baptim / nether durst
he say that images might be worshipped with outward reverence / but should be
only laymens books / but now when he has spied his time / holds openly
that hally water may be used in the church for the same ends and purposes
that his father pope has ordened it for / and brought it in to the Church /
that is to drive deuelles away / to heal all syknesses / and to be salvation of
both body and soul / and that images may be worshipped with bowyng of the
body with kissyng and crepyng to. What will this bold defendyng of Popish
superstition bring shortly / if it be unlooked to? suerly even it that is in an
old proverb / the Pope home again unto our own doors / and that with out a
viser where as yet he is partly covered.


The rescuer From gestyng against holy water ye descend to scolde with the hole

The hunter I have argued ernestly against your coniured and abused water / and
not gested against any holy water / nether have i scolded with the hole realm /
but i have resoned against a sort of falls Prophets and bewrayed a nest of
falls thieves / which have stolen a better thing the^ a golden dyalice from the

between the shulders ye may as well command the deuel to fet him to you out of

salt for no need / and all elyke / Ar their not officers enough in England to

speak ye like a man of war when ye would have me ponished with a valiant

The rescuer By whose auctorite / acording to goddis treweth the lay men ar

The hunter All the autorite that Princes have / they have / it of god / but
god gyuethe them no autorite to break his commandment. but god commanded that
a^l men should drynk of his holy cup / then the blissed cup is not taken away
from the laite by the autorite of the Prince / but by the violent tyranni of
the clergy which because they would seime more holy then the laymen / have taken
it from them. And in sayng that the laite has been so ordered from the
beginning / ye suarue far from the truth / for from Christ's time to saint
Cyprianes time / the cup was not taken from the laymen / the laymen had also in
saint Ieromes time and in saint austenes time / the hole Sacrament under both
the forms / and was never generally forbidden till the general consel ar
constance forbad it to be given in both the forms unto lay men / which was in
the year of our lord. 1415. But that your impudent lie may the better be seen
/ i will bring in witness against you / Cyprianus ad Cornelium papam in the ij.
Epistel / How teach we them or exhort them to shed their blood in the
confession of Christis name / if we deny them that shall go a war fare /
Christis blood / oder how make we them mere for the cup of mariyrdom / if we
suffer them not by the right of communion to drynk in the church of the cup of
the lord? Also Cyprian in the fifth sermon of them that had fallen / tells
how that a decon poured the Sacrament in the form of wine in to a young madens
mouth / which would not have taken it. Austen as it is alleged / libro
sente^tiarum, de consecratione, distinct. ij. can dum frangitur, When the host
is broken when the blood is poured in to the mouths of the faithful / what
other thing is there by betokened / the^ the offering up of Christis body in the

chapter of sophonias / the prestes which serve the Sacrament / and divide the
lordis blood to his people / do wikkidly against the law of Christ thyngkyng
that the words of the prayer / make the Sacrament and not the life / and that
the solemn prayer is only necessari and not the merits of the priest /
Ambrose said to the Emperor as it is written in the ix. book of the threparted
stori. With what rashness dare thou receive with thy mouth the cup of the
precions blood / when as there is so mich unjustly shed blood in the furi of
the words? Certain popes also did not allow this kind of theft as gelasius
which says / We have perceived that sum take but a portion of the body and
absteyn from the chalice of the holy blood which doutles (can not tell what
superstition they are taught to be bound in) shall either receive the hole
Sacrament or be holden a way from the hole for the division of one Sacrament
can not be made with out great sacrilege. Julius also says de consecratione
did. ij. cano. cum omne. They have not received that witness spoken in the
gospel / where they / for the fulfillyng of the communion give the Sacrament
dipped (in to wine) to the people where as Ch^^ste gave his body and blood to
his Apostelles / the desyueryng of the bread is recorded by it self and of the
gyuyng of the cup by it self alone Moreover that this halfyng and partyng of
the Sacrament was not in the primative church / and that this doctrine of
youres was but stablisshed of late the words of the Consel of constance which are these do testifi Allthoghe Christ after supper ordened this worshipful
Sacrament / and gave it under both the forms / of bread and wine / to his
discip^es / yet that notwithstanding / the autorite of the holy canones / and
the laudable and approved custom of the church / has ordened that the lay
me^ should require it only under the one form / And all thoghe in the primative
church / this Sacrament were received of the faithful in both the forms yet
the custom reasonablely brought in / which is to be taken as a law / has
ordened that it shall be ^ecey / ued of the lay people under the one form alone
/ So far the words of the Consel. Then ar you a shamful liar / which say that
the lay people have had but the on form of the Sacrament from the beginning /
But now let us examine your reason / Which your Popish brother Latomus the
lawyer and ye fet out of the forsayde Counsel / your reason is this Christis
body is a living body / and a living body is not with out blood / but under the
form of bread is Christ's body ergo there is also his blood / then the lay men
recyuyng the Sacrament under the form of bread receyuethe both the body and
b^^de / therefore the prestes taking the cup from the laymen are not church
robbers as ye say / If that it were lauful to reason after Philosophi in a
mystery of our faith then might a turk reason against us thus / and prove that
the blood that ye have in the chalice is non of Christis blood / all the blood
that is in a living body is warm / but it that ye have in the chalice is cold
/ therefore it is in no living body / but all Christ's blood is in a living
body / therefore it is none of his blood / that ye have in the chalice / ye may
se now what inconvenience might cum if a man might reason after Philosophi of
the Sacrament as ye do / Therefore let your Philosophi ly a side til ye have
need of it / and resone after the word of god / where upon this Sacrament is
bilded and not upon Philosophi ye say that in the kind of bread only / is hole
Christis body and blood / the^ have the lay men nothing taken from them / to
which sayng i answer thus / Whatsoever of the Sacrament the prestas have that
the lay me^ have not / the prestes have stolen from the^ / but the prestes
have the blissed and hallowed cup of Christ's blood / that the lay men have not
/ ergo the prestes have stolle^ it from the lay men / Every sacrament has his
element and with out it it can not be a Sacrament / but ye have that / and the
lay people have it not / ergo also that have ye stolle^ from them / If ye
understand not these arguments i will declare the^ with ij. similitudes. A
certain father sent to his son studying at oxforde ij. purses one white with a
croun in it and v. shillynges of white money / the other read with as myche in
it / he sends with these ij. a letter wherein be bids his son remember him
when he looks on the white purse and pray for him because that is his gift /
and when he looks on the read purse that he should remembri his mother who sent
him that / the carier lykyng the read purse well puts all the money that was
in it / into the white purse / and delyuereth all the money to the scolare in
the white purse / but he keeps unto him self the read purse / the scolare
after his letters ar red / requires also a read purse / the carier answers
him frowerdly and says haste thou not all the money that thou should have? what
makes matter whether thou have thy money in one purse or ij. so thou have it all
/ and so the child can not git his read purs / which is worth xiiij. d. whether
is this carier a thyefe or no / whether has he don any injury to the childs
mother or no? If that he be a thief and have don injury to the childs mother /
for taken a way the remembrance whereby she should have been remembered an prayed
for / then ar ye thieves and falls cariers / in puttyng hole Christ in to the
form of bread and taking quite a way from the lay people / the form of wine /
which ought as well to call to their remembrance by seeing and drynkyng of it
the sheddyng of Christ's blood for their souls / as by breakyng eating and
seeing of the form of bread they are bound to remember that Christ's body was
broken and offered for the redemption of their bodies / as ambrose writes
acordyng to the vayn of scripture / upon the xj. chapter of the first Epistel
of Paul to the Corinthianes after this wise / Because we are delivered by the
death of the lord / we remembryng this thing / betoken it with earyng his
flesh and drynkyng his blood which were offered up for us. The flesh of our
savior was offered for the health of our body / and his blood was shed for the
soul / as it was a fore hand figured of Moses / for so says he the flesh is
offered for your body / but the blood for your soul / there fore ye may not eat
the blood. Thus far ambrose. Nether is the supper of the lord ordened as ye
seem to understand it only / to purches for gynenes of sins / but it is
ordened to be a remembrance of Christ's death / and a thankyng of allmyghty god
for the benefittes which we have received / of him / then all they that have
received like benefit ought to be like thankful and mind full / then lay men
ought as well as the priest to se taste and drink the form of wine / as the
priest / that by the seeing tastyng and drynkyng there of they may call as well to
remembrance the sheddyng of our sauioures Christis blood / for their souls /
as the priest does / The^ is your glos al in vayn where ye say that / when as
hole Christ is under the form of bread / that the lay man receyuyng it /
receives the fruit of the hole Sacrament. What if ye commanded your steward to
give every one of your servants to his diner bread and flesh to eat / and wine
to drynk to quence his thurst with / and he knede all the bread with wine and,
gave them no other wine then it that is dronken up in the flour / and they when
they had eaten up their flesh and bread / were fayn for lak of wine to drynk
water / and compleyned unto you / would ye allow your steward in this his doing
or no? Does the wine dronken up in the bread and so taken as well quench ama^nis
thurst as it does when it is taken alone / if ye say nay then / so does not the
form of bread received alone so well put us in remembrance of Christis
blodsheddyng and death as when the form of bread is taken firstand the form of
wine is immediately taken after it / after the ordinance of Cyriste / More over
how can he have like sruyt / that keeps but half the commandme^t / with him
that keeps the hole commandme^t? He that receives only under on form /
keeps but half of the commandment / which is accipite and commedite and leueth
our the other half of the commandment / bibite ex hoc omnes hoc facite etc.
Drynk ye all of this, and do this as often as ye shall drynk do it in the
remembrance of me / it follows again that your sayng is false whereas ye say
that under the form of bread alone the lay man receives the fruit of both the
kinds.


The rescuer If ye understand not the mysteri of Christis supper as we do /
then it is no great sclander for true men to be called thieves of an heretic al
thoghe the example were not to be vnponisshed.


The hunter A man may understand the mysteri of Christis super other wise then
ye do / and yet be no heretic / specially when ye make merchandice of it / and
appli it to heal swine / and sheep / and abuse it to bring either deed men to
life again / or ellis to redeem damned souls out of hell. I called you no
thieves till that i showed your theft / and convict you of it / so should ye not
have called me heretik till that ye had showed my heresi and convicted me of it.


The rescuer We deny that the supper has any half at all / then is not all
your resonyng worth an half penny.


The hunter Every diuisible thing / and hole thing has parts where of it is
made but the supper is a diuisible and an hole thing therefore it has parts /
the supper has in it bread and wine outwardly and mystically the body and
blood of Christ / bred is not wine nether bread is Christis body nether is
wine Christis blood / nether is Christis blood Christ's body and these ar
contained in Christ's supper theyrfore it has parts. The one part of an hole
thing is on half and the other part is the other half the supper has such
parts / then it has halues.


The rescuer Ye make your self wrong Principles and there upon in gendre matter
/ To talk on whether the prestis receyuyng may profit other is out of the matter
/ which matter ye reason as thoghe ye would deny communionem sanctorum and the
mutual help in prayer and oblation of on membre for an other.


The hunter Every unlearned oldwyfe can say so as ye have now said that i have
made my self wrong principles but a learned man should have proved it and not
have said it as lone / let the wise reder compare these your words with my
arguments which i made to prove that the prestis receyuyng could not help
other / and let him judge whether they do clerkly assoyl my arguments or no.


The rescuer And when ye make argument that no mannis receyning can profit him
self to remission of syn / for as ye say / either he receives in sin to his
damnation / or out of sin / and then needs he no remission of sin whose sins
be forgyuen all ready / And here the man uses Sophistri in the word sins /
only to delude and blind the simple reder with which he desires to be of the
unlearned sort that his talk may be wondered at more then reproved.


The hunter Whether the rehersyng of a parre of an argument / and the sayng
that their is Sophistri in it be a sufficient assoylyng of an argument ar no i
report me unto all them that can still in Logik or have any natural wit.


The rescuer When he speaks of lent which has been as origin testifies in
the Greek church ever from the beginning the man speaks not plainly whether
hemiflykethe the prohibition to eat flesh / or the licens granted for money
contrary to the prohibition / he shows no other fault here in but because the
bishop of rome does the like. And if the man would ad to this that because the
bishop of rome in his church would not suffer men to fast on the sunday that
therefore we to disagre with him should eat fish upon the sunday and fast also /
he spak even as wisely as he does now / But he has made this for a degree of
folly to a grater that folowethe.


The hunter As for lent and many other ordinances i did not go about to confute
them / but only the chief and most gorgious ceremonies and traditiones that
your father ordened / which i thought if i could confute / the triflyng
ceremonies should easily give place as unmanly and weak soudiers do when there
capitaynes ar all taken or slain / And ye speaking of lent which the
Grecianes used / use Sophistical speech there in for the Grecianes used lent
diversely. As Eusebius a Grecian by the autorite of Ireneus / in the fist book
of his Ecclesiastical histori testifies sayng / There is strife not only about
ester / but also about the manner of fasting / for sum reke^ that one day only
is to be fasted / sum ij. days and other sum mo / sum forty days. Sum
countyng both the hours of the day and the night so make days. Which
diversities of obseruyng the fast / began not now first nether in our days but
before use. Socrates also a Greciane writes in the xj. book of the threparted
story that sum fasted iij. wekes before ester / sum vj. sum seven wekes / and
that never the les they called their fast quadrage simam the xl. days fast /
that is lent / and that sum absteyned from / all thing saving dry bred / and
sum / eat birds and fish / sum / eat of nothing that had life / and sum
fasted to one time of day and sum to an other / And the cause / of this
diversity he shows in these words / And because no old redyng / is found
concerning this last / i reken that the Apostelles have left it to the judgment
of every man / that every man should work that which is god not of fear or
compulsion. Now master gardener when as among the Grecianes as these ancient
historiographers do testifi which were Grecianes such diversity of lentes has
been / do not ye use Sophistri to say that lent has been used sense the
beginning in the Greek church when as sum of the Grecianes eat wildfouele in
their le^tes an other / only fish? If that lent must be holden in England
because it has been holden sense the beginning in the Greek church / then /
must the marriage of prestes / the supper under both the kinds / be also
holden in England for these ij. have been holden from the beginning in the
Greek church.


The rescuer Where for the hatred of the Bishop of rome / he would we should do
away the use of the Latin tongue in the church / and always he calls the
Latin tongue the popis mother tongue / denying that the Romans spak Latin still /
which whether they did or no / in the learned tongue / sum have been that have
probablely douted. But what so ever the Romans have don / they do not so now /
so little cause has he to call the Latin tongue the popis mother tongue when in sum
popis it has happened and in a great meany of cardinals also that nether
father nor mother / ne they them selves have known any whit of it.


The hunter Read ipray the good reder in my former book the arguments which i
made against the syngyng of the psalms in the Latin tongue where it is not
understand / and compare them with this hye clerkis answer / and thou shall
espi that he cannot assoyl my arguments and that the fox seeks holes /
Whether the old popes of whom we have these traditiones and ceremonies spak
Latin or no / whether the old Romans spak Latin or no / i report me unto all
them that are learned and have red Ciceroes orationes / or Aulus Gelius which
writes that aster the mind of Cornelius nep^s / Cicero was xxiij. year old
when he pleated the first cause in open judgment / and defended sextum roscium
accused of murder. He said his orationes in Latin before all the hole
multitude / if that the common sort understood him not / he spak in vayn that
they should hear him Erasmus is not of your mind which says. Cnm per
uniuersum terrarum orbem Roman loquantur quicunque Romanum agnoscunt
Pontificem, etc. And so is Virgil also against you which sayethe / Georgicorum
iij. cui nomen asilo, Romannm est, Aestron graij uertere uocantes. If that the
Latin tongue were a distinct tongue from the Roman tongue then was not the title
which Pilate wrote / written in Latin as it was written in Hebrew and Greek but
in Romish for Joan says that it was written Hebraisti Ellenisti Romaisti /
and then have all the translatores both Erasmus Ierom / and all other deceived
us which have all translated romaisti Latin / I wot wherefore ye talk of this
matter / suerly that ye may seem to say sumthyng and to escape so from my
arguments / How beit all wise men can easily perceive that such shifts as ye
make now / ar shameful and do not assoyl an argument.


The rescuer The man speaks wisely of the Greeks falling from the pope that
never was with him / and they sing in such Greek as the mother can no skill of
unless she chances to be learned / no more then the Bishop of Romis mother can
skill of Latin.


The hunter This Bishop which would be counted a true and a learned man lies
here as he does often unlearnedly / for beside Histori writers / the counsel had
at florence in the year of our lord 1439 under Ioanne paleologo Emperor of
Constantinople and eugenio Bishop of Rome declares plainly that the Greeks
were under the Bishop of Rome / for thus it is written in the letters of the
concordance of the Romans and Greeks / Diffinimus sanctam Apostolicam sedem
and Romanum Pontificem in uniuersum orbem tenere primatum and ipsum romanum
Pontificem successoremesse beati Petti principis Apostolorum and uerum esse
Christi uicarium, totiusque Ecclesiae caput. We determine that the holy
Apostolik sete and the Bishop of Rome to hold the primace over all the world
and that the said Bishop of Rome to be the successor of blessed Peter the
prince of the Apostelles and the true vicare of Christ and the head of the
hole church. To these words Joan nes Paleologus the Emperor and bissario^
Bishop of nece with a wonders great nombre of other Grecianes subscribed and
set their hands to / Where ye speak so boldly of the Greeks that they
understand no more their service then the romish wy men understand the Latin
tongue that is by your falls judgment nothing at all ye speak as arrogantly as ye
were in your judgment sete / as boldly as ye were on horse bak at after nown
when ye ar a knight of the garter / and as lying^y as ye had been at Rome and
therefore might lie by autorite. Because ye have been a little in italy and spoken
with the pope / ye take in hand to tell what is done in grecia / but that like
your self lyingly for i came once from venis with ij. Greeks born in peloponeso
which were merchant men and had not learned the learned Greek tongue which
understood the Psalter so well that i could not cite no verse in Greek but they
could expound the same in Italiane / And they understood me speatyng Greek to
them and i lyk wis understood them when they spak treatablely / I set this
experience against your gessyng.


The rescuer After this presumptuous ignorance there follows as shameful a lie
when he says in Germany such as have left the Bishop of Rome have also left
syngyng in Latin in their chirches. The contrari where of i have heard with in
these iij. years in the church of hala where / Brentius teaches and is chief
preacher / where a servant of mine in my hearing played at the organes at
magnificat / when the boys in the quere song magnificat in Latin / as loud as
they could cry / each one vtteryng his own breast / to the loudest with out
regard how he agreed with his fellows / I dowt not but god understood them /
God understands popingiayes / can they then pray with fruit? But of the
nombre that song / i dare say a great meany understood not what they song. And
we could much less mark their words / other then began the verse and ended it
/ so that this noble Clerk should do well to use all his resones of saint Poule
to them there and ask them / what edification the church can have in the noise
of the organes / which if the player have no other shift / may fortun be
furnisshed with the descant of o lux in the stead of te Deum / Unto whom they
would answer that at the beginning they were of wraghtonis opinion / but sense
they have considered that the learned part of the church sings in a learned
tongue to praise god in all thing / And upon the same reason they use also all
semely wyses of instruments with laudate Deum in sono tubae, unto omnis
Spiritus laudet Dominu^, Which solution at their hands i thynk wraghton / if
his name be wraghton / would easily take / and i thynk he would be ashamed of his
lie it is so manifest and so apparent / But even as truth must persuade with
truth so lies be mete to persuade there with lics.


The hunter Ye may se good reders what compasses this fox fetches to make my
hounds weary. All this long narration is brought for no other purpose / but to
seem to have answered to my arguments / when as yet indede he has answered to
never one. I said in my former book the germannes which of late left the pope
/ left also the popis roman or Latin tongue / and now sing al service in their
oun duche tongue / And it that i wrote / i wrote it of experience for in the
chirches appointed for preaching at cure / surek / Basule / Strasburg and bon
where as i have been i am suer that all service was song in the mother tongue and
none in Latin / What makes the example of on church against so many / How
follows this argument in hala they sing in Latin ergo they sing no duche in
germani? But for all this mannis sayng they sing there also in duche as i
learned of them that have been their / If the learned sang to them selves in
Latin / in England and the lay men had their songs in English. I had no cause
to write against any abuse in that behalf nether would i have written one word
of that matter / if the laite of England might have had their songs in a tongue
that they understand / as the Clergi has it in a^tong that they understand /
It is like that the Bishop chanced upon sum College of Scolares or upon sum
Popisshe church when he heard this syngyng in Latin In germany for the
avoiding of insurrection in many places it is the manner to drive no man to
Religion / therefore if their be a great sort in a citi that will not part from
their Popistri the ruelers lets them have a church as i have seen it in
cure and in bon and as i am informed it is at worms and Sphire / I saw this
that i shall tell you don at bon with in these v. months / In the college
where as the freres was where the word of god was preached al Psalms were
song in the duche tongue / and none in Latin / But in the great mynstre the
Popish prestes which will not leave yet their mumpsimus sing all in Latin / how
be it the Bishop has ordened that every sunday there is a godly sermon made
by one of his prechers in that church / and after the sermon / all that can
sing both men and childer sing Psalms in their mother tongue in duche and not in
Latin / But a none after that song sing the priests and queristers an other
song all in Latin / secundum ordinationem Papae, What if this Bishop came to
bon and chanced upon this sort of Papists / should he worthily blame the
gospellerres for the Papists papistrie / Might he honestly say to the^ in
England that would have all the service in English / what will ye run be for
the gospellers of Germani? i hard of late in Germany service song in the Latin
tongue. What if Brentius and oseander hold with you (that i believe not) that the
sound of the organes is goddis honor and service / and that a man may be
edified by sayng or hearing that he understands not / what have i to do with
Brentius which am not sworn to Brentius nether to any man / or to any ma^nis
doctrine / saving only to the doctrine of Christ. It is great honest for you
to hold and theache such doctrine as when as it is written against ye can not
defend it but ar fayn to send to the gospellers of Germany to fet help to
assoyl the arguments made against it. But to that particle where ye say that
god understands the childer syngyng in the Latin tongue which they understand
not / and mean their by / that the prayers of them that pray not with heart as
popiniayes speak / and wot not what they say / ar pleasant and acceptable
unto god / i answer that Christ alledgyng the sayng of Esai the Prophet /
mislyketh such prayers in these words / This people draws nere me and
worshippeth me with their lips but their hearts ar far from me / Paul also
in the xiiij. chapter of the first Epistel to the Corinthianes in these words
testifies that the prayer that is spoken in a strange tongue which he that
prays understands not / is of no effect and naught worth / If that i pray
in a tongue / my breath prays / but my mind has no profit Erasmus Expounds
these words thus in his Paraphrasis / If that i pray in a tongue that the people
understands not / for an example in the afrike tongue among the Greeks / ye
rather if that i should speak a langage which nether i nor other that are by me
understand / (as certane do which use to sound / the song that they have
learned in a strange tongue which they understand not the^ selves (my brethe and
wind brings forth the words that pray / but my soul or mind has no fruit
there of. It is shame for a bishop to have no other reason to defend his
harteles prayer the^ the old dotyng wives have / when they either cannot or will
not learn their Pater noster in English / for thus sayethe the old wife / ich
hop that god understands my prayer in Latin as weleas in English / And all
is good that is don for a good intent. Where as ve answer in the gospellers
name more like a piper then a preacher that therefore now god is praised and
honored with the sound and pipyng of the organes because it is written in the old
Testament / Laudate Dominum in sono tubae omnis Spiritus laudet Dominum. Where
is your memory master Bishop / have ye forgotten that ye said concerning the
worshippyng of the cross that all true honor of god is only in sprete and
proceeds from the heart? The organes have no heart nort sprete therefore their
can cum no true honor or worship from them to god / therefore the sound of the
organes is no true worship or honor of / god / Ha^^ ye not red that the
outward Sacrifices of Moses law / and that manner of worshippyng of god with
organes / shalmes offering up of calves and gotes is abrogated and that the
sabot day of the jews with all their outward fasshiones of Sacrificing is
taken away? Read the iiij. chapter of Johan and their shall ye find that god is
a sprete and will have spiritual worship / read Paul to the Hebrews and there
shall ye learn that / these shaddoes of pypyng and lutyng ar taken away and
that god requires the things selves and not the shaddoes / prays god with all
the poures of your heart / and let them be bent ernestly to the keeping of
goddis commandment thank him with all the hole heart and then have ye done that
the instruments did signifi / Read also the v. chapter of amos the Prophet
which speaks thus of the abrogation of this kind of worshippyng / Take away
from me the noise of your songs / and i will not hear the songs of your harp
/ Playng on the organes is either a moral Precept or a ceremonial / if it be a
moral Precept it perteyneth unto al me^ at this hour / and all men ar bound to
play on the organes or to praise god with their sound in pain of damnation / If
it be but a ceremonial Precept we are no more bound to keep it then to offer up
lambs / and calves / for he that said praise god in organes and musical
instruments said as well bring unto god the childer of Rams / Take a calf out
of the hyrde for sin / and a ram to be a burnt Sacrifice / both with out spot
and offer them up before the lord. Then will i nether admit your witles and
unlearned solution / nether of your hands nor theyrs if they were so made to
make any such solution.


The rescner It appears that the man is a frayed to be called heretic before
he were answered / and he would have sum delay to know whether he would stik in
it / who shall answer him that thinks noman has wit but him self / noman
learned but him self / as this proud arroga^t / presumptuous fool does in this
little book / Se what herbs grow in gardiners gardin / Pride makes him forgit
what he says in the beginning the mids / and the endyng. When he has
condemned our ignorance / then he would go to scool with us and abide our
answer / He may assoyle it thus / in this part of his book his sprete speaks
mekely / in the other part of his book where he is so vehement the flesh
bresteth furthe / after which solution it should appear / the man has a great deal of flesh and little sprete in goddis service / And in redyng of the bible
the man is all flesh / and still very angri with the Latin tongue / where in i
remit him to his brethern Brentius and oscander that named holy man / which ij.
because in deeds they disagre from this mannis opinion i thynk they can easily
satisfice him with words / where in i trust he will be content / And of them
who has pleynty / borow so myche of the sprete as where with to tempre his
gross carnalite / to dissent there in both from us and them.


The hunter I desire the good reder to read over the arguments which i have
made in my former book concerning the having of the service and bible in the
English tongue and judge whether this bablyng of this Bishop about my flesh and
my sprete / does sufficiently assoyle my arguments or no. Thanks be unto the
king of heaven which has endued our king of England with such light of true
knowledge that he has contrary to the minds of all Pharisees begone to set out
the service in english / Allmyghty god increase his knowledge every day more
and more and give him grace to do there after and grant him victori over all his
enemies both bodily and ghostly.


The rescuer The rest of this famous work is specially against me where in he
calls me the chief setterfurth of the articles concluded in this realm /
against the marriage of priests / Where in he speaks like him self when the
man says further that Martin bucer asked me what scripture i had to prove
that prestes might not mary and this reports he also like him self / And
because he would seem to be pryuy unto the disputation between Martin bucer and
me sum what he touches that was in our disputation spoken of / but fasshoneth
it like him self at the least / that i might know the man lies even thoroughly /
Thus he reports my reason made to bucer / The same autorite has the king over
all prestes of his realm and his other subjects that a father has over his
childer / but a father may forbid the prestes of his realm to mary then if
they mary when he forbids them to mary / they break the commandment of god
who says childer obey your father and mother / i trust no man would thynk i
should have fasshoned the argument in this wise / for it has no sequence in it
/ And the father that has but childer in the mayor / i have given him a Realm
and his childer prestes in the minor. And then in the conclusion / i have
forgoten the king that i spak of / and speak only of the father / Whose matter is
much what in like perplexite rehearsed as an honest simple man's example was of
Johan that married alice and robert that married an / in process of the matter
called an Johannis wife / and joined to Robert which the audience heard merely
and called it plain adulteri / And after this sort wraghton has wra^glyngly
rehearsed my argument / Then by your oun own confession it was your argument.
And the^ he gathered these co^clusiones / first that a king may forbid all
marriage / second that ones marriage of prestes was law^^^ be for the thing for
bad it / Thyrdly that the Prince makes sin that before was no syn with god /
To which conclusiones i will answer when i have trewly rehearsed my
communication with bucer.


The hunter Ye accuse me with out and cause for the vnhandsum rehearsal of your
argument for i wrote your argument in these words as my written copy can yet be
a witness / The same autorite has the king over all the Priests and other
subiectys of his Realm that a father has over his childer / But a father may
forbid his childer to mary / ergo the king may forbid the prestes and other
subjects of his Realm to mary / Where as it was other ways prynted the
composer and corrector was to blame and not i which was not present at that
time.


The reseuer With whom upon the desire he had to confer with me i told him i
was glad to speak. Who when he came to me after the manner of Germany made along
oration unto me conteynyng only the zeal he had to the truth for trying out
where of / he said he was desirous to talk with me / I told him i was glad to
hear him speak so indifferently. But for as myche / al^ (...) / Where by to
press one an other (...) clearly taken away by dissension / I told him that
scripture was out of autorite / to any one part / because both parts would
apply to their party / their own interpretation and there in stand obstinatly.


The hunter Mark here the crafty subtilite of this wyly fox. Be does as a fox
of the wod should do if he should bid a great lion battal and say to him /
Brother lion thou and i must fight / but be fore we go together thou must pull
out of thy month all thy long teth / and cut of thy tail and thy long claws /
for where as we have been often before this time at strife yet could we never
debate the matter and bring it unto a peaceable conclusion by the trial of
^eth tale and claws / but ever went away the matter being vndehated / I counsel
therefore that we tri this matter by the cares / Eue^ so this fox gardener
perceyuyng himself so far under Bucer in learning as a fox is under a lion in
streynghe / before he would dispute with Bucer he would make him by craft set a
side his wepens the word of god which the fox gardener can not abide that he
might set upon him ones disharnessed and vnwepened / As for our party the
Scripture is / not out of autorite / which ^^ll / that all doctrines shall be
tried there (...)* But as for your party / the Scripture is (...) autorite in
deed / for ye lean more to traditiones of men / to the custom / and to
General councelles then to the Scripture / where we allege bibite ex hoc
omnes for the hole supper / and qui se non continent contrahant matrimonium, ye
will not hear the Scripture but as an aspis stop your ears lest ye should
hear the Scripture.


The rescuer The spretis diffamed by the Anabaptists / miracles their be none
wroght / each part be sinners / and the Doctores of the church when they made
against them / they called them men / and esteemed them not / and therefore i
said for want of autorite to prove / i would use Sacrates manner of disputyng
with him / and preshym / which he should him self grant / he said he was content
/ Then i asked him where in / and he said he cared not / but he thought / that
the marriage of prestes was very cruelly handled / to forbid it sub poena
mortis. I told he was a sore aduersari in this because the matter touched him
self how be it the kyngis maiesti might forbid it / of the pain i would reason
with him afterward / and dowted not but the extremite of pain was in respect
of the multitude mercifully to keep them by fear / from danger / rather the^
cruel as he calls it. Why quod Bucer how can the king forbid it / i told him
then / ere i entered the matter with him / de iure diuino: i would ask him this
question what he meant by this precept / Honora patrem and matrem, whether the
son brekyng his fathers commandment in such athyng as the father might command
/ brak the commandment of god or no. Bucer answered yis. I asked him then /
whether pater was understand only of father in nature / or sather in government
/ Also he said of the father in government / also then quod i by you / The
Prince has the same autorite to command over his subjects that the father
has toward his childer / He granted that also / Then upon it that he had
granted i fasshoned my argument / Then is it your argument / The Prince has
the same pour of commandment and order of his subjects that the father has
over his childer / But by saint Poule the father may order sum of his childer
not to mary / ergo the Prince may order sum of his subjects not to mary /
Bucere by and by denied the minor / We turned to the place of saint Poul / we
red the text which is plain that the father may so do / at the which text Bucer
so stumbled and stayed / miche contrari to my expectation / as thoghe he had
never red it before. And because alisius the scot was by and hither to spak
nothing / Bucer took the book to alisius and bad him speak his mind / where
unto alisius went to the first part of the chapter / out of owr purpose /
which the said alisius understood so folishly that there upon rose a new
communication / in which were interlaced / many matters which Bucer and i
afterward entreated by writing / where in this argument of the father was not
yet answered / and therein on my part the marriage of prestes to be forbidden
de iure diuino, so defended (how so ever it likes master wraghton to have me
acompted unlearned and so peruersly to set forth the argument) that nether he
ne Bucer can yet assoyle. And i se no cause to yield to Bucere there in.


The hunter Because this long narration of your clerkly behauyng of your self
with Martin Bucere perteynethe very little to the answer that ye should make me /
and is nothing against me / i will reason nothing of it / But where as ye say
that nether Bucer nor i have assoyled your argument / let them judge which
have red my former book / But lest i should dissemble your argument / and
pretend as i red it not as ye have done to sha^fully often in this book of youres
/ I will answer to your argument and if god will / assoyle it also. Therefore
let us rehearse your argument where with ye would have proved that preftes by the
law of god may not mary. The Prince has the same pour of commandment and
order of his subjects that the father has over his childern / But by saint
Paul the father may order sum of his childer not to mary / ergo the Prince may
order sum of his subjects not tomary / As for your mayor that a Prince has
the same pour of commandment / and order of his subjects that the father has
over his childrens / I grant it is true if it be plainly and simply thus
understand / The Prince in all such matters as he long unto him / has the
same pour of commandment and order of his subjects that a father has over
his childer that is as the father in his house has autorite to command his
childer in all things that are godly and for the profit of his childer / So
has the Prince autorite in his Ream in all such matters as be long to a Prince
to be orderers of / over his subjects to co^mande the^ to their profit to the
glory of god and to the welthe of his Realm / But if ye make no exception your
mayor is not always true / for if the Prince has the same pour of commandment
over all his subjects that / a father has to command his childer / When the
father and childer ar with in the Princes dominion the childer ar the Princes
subjects / Then when as the father (as ye say) has autorite to command
certain of his childer either to mary or not mary at his pleasure / if he
commanded Thomas and Johan to mary / and the Prince commanded the same not to
mary / by your mayor it were both sin for Thomas and Johan to mary / and sin to
not mary / for if they married they brake the Princes commandment / and so
sinned / if they married not they brake their fathers commandment / therefore
tell us whether ye mean by the word same like or the self same / and tell
whether ye make an exception or none / As for your minor / that by saint Paul a
father may order sum of his childer not to mary / if ye understand it so that
he may forbid certain of his childer that they shall never mary as long as they
live / I deny your minor / and put you unto the proof of it / ye say that it is
plain by saint Paul / and the 7. chapter is quoted in the mergen / howbeit when
as i red over the hole chapter i could find never one word that gave any such
autorite of commandment / but very myche to the contrari part / as here after
i shall declare / Ye should therefore have showed us the place and have made an
argument there of / Why have ye not showed us the text / that makes so mich for
your purpose? Belyke ye would as gladly have showed it as ye did show us miche
glorious and superfluous bostyng but that ye were afraid that / if it were
seen / men of learning and judgment should deem it to make nothing for your
purpos / But for all the hydyng of it / i trust i shall find it out that ye mean
of / A learned man of Germany writes that ye alleged this text of Poul for
your purpose. Be that stands stead fast in his heart / having no necessite /
but pour of his own will / and has determined that / in his heart to keep his
virgin does well / and so he that marieth his virgin does well but he that
marieth her not does better. If this be not the place that ye mean of / show an
other and we shall answer to it as well as we can / If this be the place form
an argument of the text for your purpose and it shall be answered / And in the
mean season i shall prove by evident and clear places of scripture that a father
has no autorite to command his childer to live all their life time with out
marriage / I shall also prove by ij. learned Doctores which turned Paul out of
Greek in to Latin / which knew the phrase of Poul as well as ye do / and
understood the text as well also that this text makes nothing for your purpos
Ierom expoundyng the same text says these words / Ille firmus statuit cuius
puellae consensus Patris firmauit uoluntatem, He purposes steadfast whose
madens consent has confirmed the fathers will / Then by saint Jerome the
consent of the made is required with out which the father can orden nothing.
Erasmus in his paraphrasi upon the same place writes thus / If any man
perceyuyng that he has liberti to be stow in marriage his virgin or not to
bestow her / and is not compelled by need to either of both / and has
determined and purposed in his mind to keep his virgin at home which desires
no marriage / does right / for as it is ieperdous to hold her from marriage that
is desyrons of marriage / so it is ungodly to discorage madens minds from the
desire and vow of chastity. Ambrose writing upon the same place says. Hoc
dicit ut qui uirginem habet cui animus ad nuptias non est, seruet illam nec
illi ingerat fomitem nuptiarum quam uidet nubendi uoluntatem non habere, This
does he say that he that has a virgin not minded to mary should keep her and
not in tyse her to marriage whom he perceyuedh is not willing to mary / ye have
heard the Doctors now let us se what resones we can fet out of the Scripture /
What so ever autorite of order or commandment Paul gives unto fathers that
same has he received of the lord / But he sayethe in the vij. chapter of the
former Epistel to the Corinthianes / that he has no commandment at all of the
lord concerning virgins / De Virginibus praeceptum Domini non habeo. Therefore
have fathers no autorite given them of Paul to command their childer not to
mary / for noman can receive of Paul it that he has not / but he has no
precept or commandment of virginite / Then can none have that autorite of him /
then is it not plain by Paul that a father may command sum of his childer not
to mary. When Paul which has as myche autorite as any other Apostel / and
has received of god as miche autorite for fathers to their childer as any
other Apostel / yi^ received no autorite of god to give fathers where by they
might command they children to be virgins / ye may be sure that / there is no
other Apostel that grants fathers autorite to command their children to be
virgins and to live with out marriage. If that the Prince have the same
autorite over his subjects concerning marriage that a father has over his
childer / I will reason with you thus / Where ye say the father has autorite to
command certain of his childern that they shall never mary / i ax you whether by
these certain ye mean Richard / Robert / and Rolland / only or all that he list
to forbid to mary what soever they be and of what soever name. If that ye grant
that the father has autorite to command whom soever of his childer he lift to
absteyn from marriage / and he Prince has the same autorite over his subjects
that a father has over his childer / then may the Prince forbid all the laymen
to mary as he has forbidden the Prestes / Also it follows that when the
prince may so order all his subjects by the law of god as a father may order
all his childer by the law of god / and a father by the law of god may order
all his childer to mary / ergo the^ may a Prince order all his subjects by the
law of god to mary / but all the prestes of this Realm ar the Princes
subjects ergo he may order them all by then law of god to mary. Where is now
master bishop your braggyng de iure diuino that a priest may not may? Does it
not now foow by your oun sayng that a priest might mary lby the law of god if
the Prince would so order prestes and bid them mary? Ye must either bring forth
sum other reason or scripture or ellis prestes may mary iure diuino by the law
of god / If ye say that therefore the marriage of prestes is forbidden iure
diuino by the law of god be cause the Prince forbid / death prestes to mary then
if the king of france forbad men to eat oystens on the friday and flesh on the
sunday / it were forbidden iure diuino to eat oysters on the frayday and flesh
on the sunday and so might it be lawful to day and to morrow is dedly syn / That
it is no sin for a priest to mary and that the forbiddyng of the marriage of
prestes is no law of god i will prove it more at large that all the nobles and
comones of England may se how shamfully ye mokked them / bearyng them in hand
that it was sin / and forbidden by goddis law that a priest should mary / first
that it is no sin by the law of god i prove it thus / All sin and all thing
that is unlawful is forbidden by the law of god / Paul says Roman. iij. by
the law is sin known / and Romans vij. I knew not sin but through the law / that
is throw the law of god / But the marriage of prestes is not fotbydden by the
law of god / for Aron and Zacharias testifi that it was not forbidden in the
old Testament / Paul unto Timothe and Titus witnesses in these word a Bishop
must be the husband of one wife that marriage of prestes is not forbidden in the
new Testament / and allthyng that is either bidden or forbidden is forbidden
either in the new Testament or in the old / but ye se it is forbidden in nether
/ of both / therefore it is no sin by the law of god for a priest to mary. If
that the law of forbiddyng of prestes marriages were the law of god / as ye say
/ then it should be general to al cuntres and the transgression of that law
should every where be elyke syn / but in Grecia / and in Denmark / and in hic
Germany it is no syn for a priest to mary / both be cause they make no vows /
and because the Princes forbid not there prestes to marye. The^ is not the
forbiddyng of prestes marriages the law of god / but co^trari to the law of god
as i shall prove it thus / It is contrary to the law of god to forbid in pain
of death that god commanded in pain of damnation / but they that forbid many
that cannot leave chaste with out marriage / to mary forbid that god commanded
for he said by his servant Paul if they live not chaste let them mary / If ye
will that i shall say if they can not line chaste let them mary / then ar their
sum that can not line chaste / If that all the prestes should be bound to mary
that keep not them selves chaste / few prestes should live syngle / Then is it
against goddis law to forbid al prestes to mary namely them that keep not them
selves chaste and have not the gift of chastity. If that ye say all that will /
may have the gift of chastity / for the a^yng acordyng to that which is said
what so ever ye ax the father in my name he will give you it / i answer first /
that this text is to be understand that what soever as man asks of god which
is necessari unto salvation that he will grant him the same / But when as those
things ar asked that are not necessari for salvation the askers thoghe they be
good men git not at all times of god their askyng / as Paul when he asked
thrice of god that he would take from him the prik of the flesh obtened not his
askyng not withstandyng that Christ said what soever ye ask the father in my
name / that shall he give you and whi? because that it that he axed was not
necessari unto him for his salvation. Then when as the gift of chastity to live
honestly with out a companion / is not necessari unto salvation / for many men
have been saved with out that gift / god by the foresaid promis is not bound to
grant every one it that ax it of him. And that every man is not ordened to
receive that gift / Christ our savior bears wit nes / in the xix. chapter
of Matthew in these words speaking of them that might live honestly with out a
wife / All men are not able to receive that word / but they to whom it is
given / And Paul in the seuent chaprer of the.i. to the Corinthianes / says
i would all me^ were as i am / but every man has his proper gift of god / one
so and an other so / that is one man has the gift of god to live chaste with
out the use of marriage and an other has it not. That all prestes which are
commanded in pain of death to live with out wives / have not the gift of
chastity / nether can have it not only an.c. prestes in England will swear it
/ but also the example of following of galba / does sufficiently testifi. They
were ones in Rome about to make alaw that who se ever should be taken in
aduoutery / that his priuttes should be cut away from him with an hot burning
iron / sed Galba negabat, said Borace / Galba would none of that / because he
either intended to be anduonterer or ellis thought that he cold nos choose but be
an ad^o^ter. Then wh^^ as their ar sum that the pope compels to to vow
chastity which have not that gift / forbids that Christ commands and
therefore is Antichriste / and ye Bisshoppes defendyng his doctrine ar limbs of
Antechriste / and as long as that Popish doctrine of the pope abides in
England so long is not the pope driven out of England.


The rescuer And now to master wragheonis conclusiones / Because i made this
argument / Then is it your argument / Shalhe say that i admit Princes may
destroy marriage / as thought that which upon consyderation may be good in sum /
shall be absolutely allowed in all / They that commanded virginite most / would
not have all virgins ne saint Paul that wissheth all to be as he him self /
intended not thereby the destruction of marriage / althoghe him self were not
married / But such frantike conclusiones this unlearned arrogancy gathers.


The hunter Whether my conclusiones follow of your minor or no / i report me
unto all then that have learned Logik or have any natural wit. I will form my
argument ones again that they that have not my other book / may se the
argument here / ye say. The same autorite has a Prince of order and
commandment of his subjects that a father has over his childer / But a
father by saint Paul may order certain of his childer not to mary / ergo the
Prince may order certain of his subjects not to mary. Tell me i pray you
whether god has appointed any childer by name / or any nombre of childer that a
father may forbid to mary / or is it in the fathers liberty to forbid whom
soever he will to mary and so many as he will? What if he will forbid all his
childer to mary / may he not forbid all? show what place of Scripture
restrayneth him that he may not as well forbid all as one? The father has the
same pour of order and commandment over all his childer / that he has over
one / but ye grant that he may command or order on of his childer not to mary
/ ergo / he may order or command them all not to mary / And the Prince has
the same autorite over his subjects / that a father has over his childer /
but a father may forbid all his childer to mary / ergo a Prince / by your minor
or may forbid all his subjects to mary / for he has as myche autorite of
commandment over all his subjects / as over a certain / or ellis all were not
so much bound to obey him as / the certain of whom he had the autorite of
commandment over. The^ it follows thus. He that may forbid all the subjects
of his Realm to mary / may destroy marriage in his Realm / But by your argument
the Prince may forbid all the subjects of his Realm to mary / therefore by
your minor a Prince may destroy marriage in his Realm. Where ye say that they
that commanded virginite most / would not have all virgins / i reken that is
the trewest word that ye spak in all this book / for your father the pope
which was the gretest commander of virginite / of all other / Has allowed
stews in Rome / and suffers beside wymen hores / the filthiness of the other
kind also / And ye my lord prior of the grene freris in the bank / the
greatest commander of virginite in the hole Realm of England / therefore apoynte
with in your dominion and lordship an hole street fore open bandry / and keep a
comonstewes / that their should not be to many virgins but if there be any young
madens or young men / that are disposed to depose and give over their virginite /
they may their offer it up to priap^s. And so is it true that they that
commanded virginite most would not have all virgins. Where as ye say that
saint Paul thoghe he were not married / and yet wisshed that all were as he was
not with standing would not destroy marriage / i say the contrari / for i say if
Paul were a virgin and wisshed all men to be as he was / that is a virgin /
then wisshed he that there should be no father nor mother / for fathers and
mothers ar no virgins / and that no married foll should be but all virgins.
Then would he with that wish that marriage were destroyed. But that would not
saint Poul therefore ye understand not saint Paul as ye should do / for Poule
had a wife and wisshed that all the Corinthianes which anaunced them selves of
virginite and widowhede could live chaste with out a woman as he did / which
lest his wife in an other place / then where he preached / and that all men
were with out care as he was / which thing commonly follows marriage. But where
as ye knok me on the pate / and lay unlearned arroganci to my charge / let us
now try it whether you or i am more worthy to be accused of unlearned
arrogance / Ye say that Paul wss not married / and i hold that he was married /
how shall this matter be best discussed? I know no better means then to call to
witness sum that were either alive in poules time or ellis were very nere his
time / I call for witnesses ignacius and Clement that Paul had a wife / Now
hear the witnesses speak / Eusebius in the third book of the Ecclesiastical
story in the third chapter reports Clementes words thus. Clement whose words
/ we have here marked / writynge against them which despise marriage / sayethe
these words. Do they also disalow the Apostelles / for Peter and Philip had
wives and gave their daughters to be married unto men / but also Paul the
Apostel / is not ashamed to make mention in a certain Epistel / of his make or
companion and to great her / whom he says he led not about with him that he
might be more ready / and combreles to preach the gospel. Erasmus in his
annotationes upon the iiij. chapter of the Epistel to the Philippianes
reports the witness of ignatius in this wise. The holy martyr ignatius in an
Epistel / to the Philadelphianes does plainly grant / that not only Peter / but
also Paul and other of the Apostelles had wives / and that he had them in
noless reputation therefore / because / the Patriarchs / and Prophets was
married / not for their lustis sake but for childers sake / Chrysostom grants
that there were sum which rekened that Paul in this place did speak unto his
wife / but he dissenteth / showing no cause of his dissension / But to whom is
it more right that we should stik to Clement and ignatius / of the which the one
was saint Peter's companion / and the other was saint marks the Evangelists
disciple / or shall we believe better Chrysostom / which was so long a space
after the Apostelles time? thus far Erasmus / Let indifferent men judge now
whether i that bring autorite for me / or ye that pronounce boldly by gess with
out all reason and autorite / ar more worthy to be accused of arrogant ignorance.


The rescuer The Second conclusion is as wise / that i grant by this argument
that prestes might have married / if the Prince had not forbidden it. If i prove
that prestes may not mary / because of their vow do i therefore grant that the
vow falyng they might mary? If i took upon me to prove that one owes me money
/ for my labor / because he promised me / does this infer this conclusione that
if he had not promised me / he had ought me nothing for my labor?


The hunter There is away from a village to the marcat town over a bryge /
over the which all men with out any toule had wont ever to go to the market /
the lord of the village upon a market day set one of his servants on the
bridge to stop every man to go over that bridge that would not / for his passage
pay vj. d. in the year / the servant lets non pass but them that promis to
pay vj. d. The pore men be cause they must needs go to market / to sell their
corn to git them alyuyng there with / promis all to pay that he requires / At
the day appointed for the receyuyng of this money / he by his servant commands
them to pay the vj. d. and requires the money also by thyer promis / whether is
this gentle man only the cause of payng this money / or he is both cause of
promisyng and of payng of it also? If this gentle man had not required of them
nether to promis this monye nor to pay it / the pore men might have gone as
well toolfre / to the mercate as they had wont to do before their lords new
request and commandment. Even so is it between the Prince and the prestes. For
by whose autorite / do ye require of every one that cummeth to you for orders
of subdecon decon and presihode / the vow of chastity? By the autorite of god
or by the autorite of the Prince / ye can show no autorite that ye have of god
to require of all that shall take those orders / the vow of chastity. If that ye
do it by the autorite of the king then it is the lyngis commandment that ye
shall require of every one that shall be subdecone decone and Priest to vow
chastity. Then when it is the kyngis commandment that this vow shallbe required
/ which would not have been offered / if it had not been required / and the king
commands all them / of whom he commanded you Bisshoppes that the vow should
be required of / to keep their vow that is to live single with out wives all
their lives / the vow of chastity concerning prestes is as well The kyngis
commandment as the forbiddyng of marriage is. Then where as i reason / if therefore
the marriage of prestes be unlawful because the king forbid the^ it / th if
the king would not forbid it it should not be unlawful / and ye say that it is
unlawful also because they have vowed chastity / i say that if follows never
the les of your sayng that if the Prince would not command Bisshoppes to require
of subdecones decones and prestes / the vow of chastity / and commanded not the
prestes to live with out wives that it were not contrari to the law of god for
a priest to mary / Answer me / when Bisshoppes require no vows / and prestes
make no vows and the king forbids no priest to mary / why may not a priest
then / mary? How is it then de iure diuino? A man that will take heed may epsy
that your sprete is an unconstant sprete / for in sum places when ye ar axed in
England / whi that prestes may not mary / ye answer that they may not mary be
cause they are forbidden by the law of god / in Germany ye answer that they may
not mary because the Prince forbids them to mary / and in your Catechisine ye
show this cause that prestes may not mary / Matrimoni is left at liberty to all
men saving prestes and other / which of their fre liberti / by vow advisedly
made / have chosen the state of continenci. Seem ye not here to say that only
the vow hyndereth prestes and such other to mary? In this place ye make no
mention that they are forbidden by goddis law / nether make ye any mention that
the forbidding of the Prince hyndereth them to mary. Bear do ye play as a fox
does when he is chaced out of on hole which rumneth in to an other / and when
that serves not flies in to the third. If that ye can bring no other cause
that prestes should not mary but because they have made a wilful or a fre vow / I
will prove that the vow is nether fre nor willful but constrained by compulsion
/ if not in all the votaries and prestes that are this day in England / at least
in a great nombre namely in all them that would not have vowed if the vow had
not been required of them / which if i bring to pass there shall no voluntari
vow hinder prestes and such like to mary. Now to the purpose Nothing is fre
that is constreyned by a commandment to on way / but the vow of chastity is
constreyned whils it is commanded by the Prince to be required of all
subdecones decones and prestes / and that they shall live with out wives / ergo
the vows of subdecones decones and prestes are not fre / If that ye answer that
subdecones decones and prestes may chus whether they will be votaries or no
before they be decones subdecones or prestes / i say / it that / a a man
anoydeth before he is subdecon / auoydeth not being onis made subdecon / then
when there is no subdecon but he is a votari / and must either not be subdecon
or ellis be auorary / how can a subdecon avoid the vow? and so with decones
and prestes / If that ye say then when men know that the vow is indivisible
copled with prestehode / all me^ may chus whether they will be prestes or no /
and so is the vow fre / i answer that where so ever the gospel of Christ is /
there must nedis be prechers there of / and ministers of the Sacraments whom
ye call prestes / It that must be / can not be avoided / but there must be
prestes in England / then ar there sum that can not avoid but be prestes upon
whom soever the lote falls / Christ commands in every Christen Realm that
his gospel shall be preched / and his Sa cramentes shall be ministered / and when
as the ministeri is commanded to be / it is therbi commanded that there shall be
ministers of the same / then Christ commandyng that his word shall be prea
ched / commands that their shall be certain ministers of it / and of all the
same that Christ commands to be his ministers the Prince commands you to
require the vow of chastity / and ye will not suffer them that Christ sends
to be his ministers / to be admitted to their office / except they make unto
you the vow of chastity / then it is false that ye said that all men might choose
whether they would be votaries or no / and that all men might choose whether they
would be prestes or no / for when as there must be prestes / and the vow of
chastity must be required of the same / of them then that must be prestes / the
vow can not be avoded / what fre election and liberti is this? Apore scolare of
cambrydge is brought up of a child till he be xxiiij. year old in learning and
canno still of any occupation saving only of learning / he is a fellow of a
college whose statutes require that at the depar tyng of one priest an other
shall succeed in his room / that a certain nombre of prestes may be ever in
the college / on ^lder is beneficed / and this scolar is eldest and must either
be priest and so becum a votari / or ellis he must lose his living in the
college / If he could choose he would not forswear marriage and be a votari /
but for fear of Iesyng his living he takes the vow that is offered him / and
so is auotari / is not this man compelled to be a votari by lady ponerty? The
men of monstrel after long besegement pretending to give up the ceti / let in
at their gates so many of our men as they thought they might ouercum / and when
they were in / let dou^ / the port culles and killed an c. of our me^ / The
capitane being there with sore grieved / incoragyng his men sets mor freshly
on the citi then he did before / and he perceyuyng that he is able to win the
citi by force / axeth them if they will give over the citi to him and in that
condition will let him have an c. men to order at his pleasure to sle them or
to do with them what he list / that all the rest of the citi mayescape or that
they will stand to their adventure / to be filled every mothers son / They
perceyuyng that they can hold the citi no longer grant the captain his
request and give up the citi unto him. He is fully purposed be fore the c. men

of them swear unto him that they shall be his true bond men. An c. men ar either
chosen out by lotes / or offer them selves up for the safegarde of the citi /
to the capitane / he makes them all swear to be his true bond men as long as
they live / They do swear / May all these if they will avoid the oath of
bondage? is their one among al these that ca^ choose but he must be a bondsman?
Non at all / so ca^ no more the prestes of England avoid the vow of chastity /
for as fully as this capitane is purposed to require of all them that shall
offer them selves or shall be offered up unto him / the oath and promis of
bondage / so fully ar ye minded to require the vow of chastity of all them that
god sends to you to make prestes of / and all them that arsent of the^ selves
or of their friends to you to be ordered. Therefore the vow of chastity that all
the subdecones decones and prestes make in England / is servile full of bondage
/ constreyned and compulsed / in all them that would not have vowed chastity if
no vow had been required. Take now the sum of all our similitudes in this
argument. That which is all ways copled / and inseparablely joined unto a
thing / cannot be avoided of him that shall take that thing / as he that will
take aloe and lay it on his tongue he can not avoid the bitterness of the same /
but the vow of chastity is always copled / and inseparably joined to the
orders of subdecon decon and prestode ergo noman that will take the order of
subdecon decon or prestehod can a woyde the vow of chastity / But nothing is
fre that cannot be avoided / and the vow of chastity that the prestes decones
and subdecones take cannot be avoided / ergo the vou of chastity that
subdecones decones and prestes make is not fre / Answer to the parts of my
argume^te as i have answered to the prates of youres / But if ye cannot answer
/ give over your hold or ellis / in the stead of an answer chide scold and
brawl as ye use como^ly to do when ye have no argument nor resonto help your
self: with all.


The rescuer The Third conclusione is the self same with the second / in other
terms that by me marriage of prestes was no sin before god til the kyngis
maiesti / made it sin before god. Bucer was of an other mind that if the
prince might comma^de / it was before a sin a fore god to do the contrari / for
he said Princes might only co^man de that god had ordened / to be commanded /
where in he swarued from that he had first granted me / where upon i resoned /
i have his writing to show / where in shall apere i had more Scripture to show
for the purpos / i spak of then such as i communed with could well resolve when
they were touched with them.


The hunter ^o fresh men to the helm / for this Bishop can make me no answer
/ What is this to the purpose to tell us here of Martine buceris mind / A
learned man in Scripture would have told us his mind / and not have said Bucer
was of that mind / It will make wise men lawghe at your arrogance and bostyng
ignorance to bear you so gloriously to crak of the plenty of Scripture that ye
had at the counsel and to se how bare ye be in writing / having in a manner no
mo places of Scripture to dispute with in every matter / the^ these ij. textes
honor thy father and mother / and every soul obey the hye powers. With which
textes ye play as a certain Sophister did with cuiuslibet contradictionis
altera pars est uera, and as an unlearned paynter did which could paynte
nothing ellis but a cypressire / which when any man ca^ to him to have any
thing painted / said ever out of season / will ye have any thing of the cypress
tree.


The rescuer I will reason no more with this hunter that wants all reason.


The hunter I heard no reason of you hither to / therefore ye leave of / before
ye begin / and because ye nether will nor can reason with the hunter / ye will
chyde with him / scolde / belie him / befool him / and al to defyle him with
the dirte and skla^derous mire of your lies / following in this point certain
unclean birds / which when they can not make their party good with the hauk
all to beray the hawk with their stynkyng and burning dong.


The rescuer He rangeth in a licencious liberti / and bresteth in to this
church of England / under color to hunt the fox / and ranchseth and halloweth
at every dear.


The hunter I never knew a right der having such a long tale as ye have and so
gorgious / nether Peter nor Poule nether any good Bishop had at any time such
a po^pose tale as ye have / therefore i take you for no right dear / but for a
proud ij. footed fox / and so i hallow at no dear but at the fox and his
generation / There are many / in England that are no foxes but right read dear
which would gladly hunt the fox with me if they durst.


The rescuer With a purpose to dryne all godlynes / all semelynes / all
religions and devout behauour out of the park.


The hunter I intend to drive only out of the park the fox of Rome with his
ceremonies and traditiones which ye grant he has made / All that have red my
book can bear me witness that i have not written one word against god / or any
law or ordinance that god made / where upon it follows by your sayng that
their is no godlynes / no semelynes nether any religious or devout behauour in
goddis law / for if all godlynes semelynes and religious behauour be driven
away when the pope with his ceremonies and ordinances is driven away / i pray
you what godliness or semelynes remaneth for Christ and his word which abides
after that the pope and his word is driven away? Is not this to make a god of
the pope? Yis suerly / All godlynes and semely behauour is only in god / but ye
say that in dryuyng away the pope and his ordinances i drive away all godliness
and semelynes / therefore by yowr sayng the pope and his ordinances ar god / If
ye be not a papist and an Heretic there is none in the realm of England /
which praise so greatly the pope and his traditiones / and contrari to the
Scripture make a god of him.


The rescuer He begins with the kings maiesti in alteracion of his style /
and then at lerge callethe the hole realm thieves.


The hunter I trust that i have offended nothing against the kyngis style for i
have given as myche unto him in my book as may be given unto an erthly man /
And thoghe i have not written the same words that ye have written i have written
the same sentence / if your meaning agree with the word of god / Where ye say
that i call all the hole realm thieves / all that are true men and have red my
book can testifi the contrari / for i call you only thieves which have stolen
away Christis blissed chalice from the lay people / and not them which have the
theft committed against the^.


The rescuer His chase is against the cross and all images / he cannot abide
lent and fridayes / he lyketh no laws and ceremonies in the church allthoghe
they be good. For prestes wives he makes a busy suite. He can not away with
divine service / in the Latin tongue which he utterly abhors.


The hunter If ye would not have given outward worship unto the cross / and to
images / i had never written so ernestly against them / But when i se you so
ernestly bent to defend the outward worship of them / and the outward
worship could not be taken away except the images were taken away also to the
which the worship was don / i thought that it should be best / to speak
against both to gether that the one might be taken away with the other. What
offense is it to speak against the superstition of lent? All good laws and
ceremonies do i allow / it had been your de^^y to have proved ones that ye have
said so often / that the ceremonies which i have written against / ar good / ye
will belyke pres me with your autorite because ye ar a doctor / and would that we
should be as well satisficed with your bonum est as the scolares of Pythagoras
were content with ipse dixit. If ye like a doctor will confirm your sayng with
reason and scripture it shall be allowed / but ye will bring no other reason nether
autorite then ulysses mace / and your oun saying for all your velvet cotes and
gylded sporres / we regard your sayng no more then the voice of a dottrel for
all that ye be a doctor / thoug ye cri good, good good til ye be weary. Call ye
argument brought out of the scripture / to prove that prestes may mary suite
for prestes* wives? Well i am content let it be so / i make suite that prestes
may have wives / and ye have made suite that prestes may thrice with out peril
of life ly with hores / whose suite is more honest? I ca^ well away with divine
service / but much of it that ye call divine service is superstition idolatri
and the deuelles service. And the Latin tongue i love as well as you / but i would
have it spoken to the^ and before the^ that understand it / and not to the lay
people that understand it not and there for get no profit by the hearing of it.


The rescuer He has be like a meruelons plat form in his head to build that
he would rid Christis Religion of all these ornaments / Calls he this the
huntyng of the fox and Romish fox? Rather goes the fox a hunting. The best is
the man hunteth by day / and declares for so miche what he is / only hydyng
who he is for wragh ton me seems should not be his name.


The hunter The ornaments of Christ's chirch ar the word of god which ye will
not suffer lay men to read in the church / the Sacraments which ye both pare
and forbid / faith whose commenders ye note for heretics / hope and charity /
preaching of the word of god which ye moke / and call it talkyng / the ryghe
reconcylyng of them that are at discord / and the excommunication of stubborn
sinners / ar the ornaments of the chirch which i would have restored again to
the church by you and your fellows that have stolen them out of Christ's
Church and in the stead of them have set in the church a plain boys play of
vain ceremonies and have filled the church / with candelles / tapers / images
/ salt / water / ashes / bows / and agreat sort mo of such other trifles /
ar these the ornaments of Christ's church? Nay they are the lakens that the
pope has given the people to play with all / that they should not cry for the
word of god / Now this is the fourth time that ye have been besy about to seek
an other name that should be mine then wraghton / and because i set no other name
to my book ye call me a masker / The six articles / and your Catechismi which
is called the kyngis book is of your making as every man can tell / that has
heard you preach or has red your other writings / and yet ye set not your
name to them and so under the viser of the kings acts and the kyngis book ye
cover and set out / nay by force violently thurst in to al mennis hands ye and
in to the church of Christ even up to the pulpit your Popish coniurynges /
folishe dremes / rotten ceremonies / and idle ordinances / who is now a masker
if ye be none? Also to this your book ye have set no name at all / and yet ye
will be no masker / I have set my surname unto my work / where by my ancettores
have been named in time past / what if sum have called me by an other name (as
ye give me many new names in your book) may not i use the name that i know my
ancettores have used before me / therefore? Your ancettoures have not ever been
called gardiners sense the beginning. What if your great grande father when he
was a young man and could lustely follow the ^y^he / were called Robin Raker /
and when he wexed aged and began to be unlusty / were made the keeper of sum
goodmannis gardin / and from thence forth were called Robin gardener / might
not ye call your self knowing this / steue^ Raker? Then why ar ye so offended
that i name my self as i know my ancettores have been named in time past? I am
as well known in England by my name. W. Wraghton to be a true man as ye ar
known by your name steue^ winton in Germani to be a popish heretic.


The rescuer But what so ever the kynred name of the man is he may have pleynty
of other names / for whether aman call him fool / proud arrogant / glorious
disdaynful / spitful / hayt full / unlearned / untaught / busy / partly liar /
wrangler / seditious / malicious / or many other of that sort / he can not
speak amiss.


The hunter As the maned ox banasius perceyuyng that his horns ar so crooked in
ward that he can nether hurt the hunters hu^des with the^ / nor yet defend
him self with the^ / as soun as he begins to run away / casts the space of
iij. pases from him / so hot dung upon the hundes that follow him that
wheresoever it lyghteth it brin geth of the hear / so this fox and foxis
defender / now at the end of his book / ready to run away be cause he cannot
defend him self with his natural wit / which is nether strong i noghe to
ouercum goddis truth nether to defend open idolatri / as he runs way and
dare not try the matter with autorite argument or reason / all to defyleth me
with the dung of hye niknames / and says that i may have names cnow / as wors
lightly no man can devise / Of whom may i have all these names? of him that
has them / or of him that has them not? If these names may be had all of this
Bishop / what a treasure has he out of which he can bring out such pleynty
of noughtines / what an heart has he that sends out such fruytes? what a well
is this that sends out such water as this is? I intend not to scold with you
nether to strive with you in doggis eloquence / where in i give you place and
tak you for my better. Therefore i will not go about to give you so many names
again / but i will as my deuty is / give you the tenth name again be cause ye
ar a priest / which is busy / ye will teach cambrige men to pronunce Greek /
brewers to make bear / taylers to make garments / cooks to dress mete / in
bruges ye dissuade men from the Doctrine / of the Germans / sum time ye play
the knight of the garter / sumtym the examiner and sumtyme the judge and
accuser both to gether / sumtyme the purue your / sumtyme the preacher and
other while the Sacrificier in summa allthyng saving the good divine which is
most required in a Bishop. Now when as ye intermedle with these matters which
long not unto your vocation / and therefore ar more busy then i / i give you
that name again for tithe / till ye have turned your co^ditiones / as for your
other namesi trust i am as well quite of them be this time as of busy.


The rescuer No man can speak here in farther / then the man in his book will
make / god and a vow / i would have spoken of heretic / But he may not so be
called till the book be ansured / therefore he has made a special request / as
i have before noted / But now master hunter your hounds have ron at riot / and
leuyng the fox yerned / only at the dear / which in the kyngis maiestes clos
ground / with your maskery is felony all thoghe ye speak so plainly as it may
be acompted day. This is your fault so manifest / and apparent as it excedeth
your pour to close or hyde it. God give you grace to make a more fruit full suit
to his goodness / and to the kingis majesty / for your reco^ciliation to both
their favors the^ your indiscreet suit in this huntyng has deserved.


The hunter I desired you goodma^ gardener (or ellis i lie) that ye should not
be so rash as ye had wont to be / to call me heretic with out a cause as ye
did ones in your hall right proudly because i wear a cloak and a hat of the
new facion / But i could not git / my request for ye have called me now twyse
Heretic and neiher have ye answered to my arguments nether showed me what
Heresies i held nether have ye confuted any false Soctrine or Heresi that i
hold therefore ye do wrong thus lyingly and falsely to sklander me. Thynk you
because that ye have taken it in a custo^ to call men Heretics god will take it
for no sin? Is sin no sin because it is of^ used? Well ye ar a man in autorite
and may do what ye list / and no man can have any right where ye bear ruel. I
must seek therefore for right of an hyer pour / But now have ye said that ye
can say to defend the fox and that he is not in England / how be it ye have
profited nothing at all for ye have nether proved by reason nor scripture that
the popis Soctrine which ye have taken in hand to defend / is good or agreyng
with the word of god. Nether have ye confuted my resones which i brought in my
former book against the popis learning which is now holden in England /
Therefore there is nothing to let me but that i may conclude in this book as i
did in my former. Who soever holds still the pepis doctrine co^trari to the
word of god / holds still the po pe which is Antichhriste / But ye hold
still in England the popis doctrine contrarito the word of god / therefore ye
hold still in England the pope which is Antichriste. And this salf doctrine do
ye defend / the^ ar ye a defender of Antichriste. Every defender of Antichriste
/ is Christis enemy and the kings / But ye ar a defender of Antichriste /
therefore ye ar Christ's enemy and the kyngis. If that Christis enemy and the
kyngis / might still occupi in England that occupation which makes him
Christis enemi and the kyngis / with out forbiddyng or correction after that
his fault is openly known / The officers of England and gouernoures under the
king / were not Christis fre^des and the kyngis / But i trust they are Christis
friends and the kyngis the^^fore / i trust that they will at least forbid you /
your deuelish occupation.


God save the king.
Twelve new erronius articles of Steuengardinars creed taght in his book called
the examination of the hunter.
1 The ceremonies and traditions which the busshop of rome has ordined / and
ar now allowed in England ar the pale of the church of England.

2 The popis ceremonies and traditions / ar good and polytique laws / Wherbi
god has Enclosed the kings subjects under his magesti alone.

3 As king Richard an euel man made a good politic law for the body and
common wealth of England / so can the pope an euel man make good laws and holsum
doctrine for man's sowl and Christ's church.

4 What so ever is good spoken and used by man is miche mor of god / then
Christ's doctrine is his fathers doctrine.

5 He that says that the law of the gospel ought only to be holden in
Christ's church and is sufficient alon for it / spekith so far out of reason
that he is not worthy to be reasoned with all.

6 They that hold that the cross of silver or gold oght not to be worshipped
with kissing of it and bowing and kneling to it / ar ennimies of Christ's true
crose and tak away the means that might set out the glory of Christis crose.

7 Nether Paul nor the crose can be worshipped with godly honor.

8 As Christ used clai for an instrument to heal the blindmans eyis withal and
has saved diverse by faith and made it an instrument of salvation / and as god
has ordined Timothe to be an instrument of salvation both to himself and for
other / so may the pope orden halli water to be an instrument of salvation both
of body and soul to al them that are sprinkled with it.

9 No man can commit idolatry with his bodi alon and in only kissing of an
image or idol / and in only kneling to it can no idolatry be committed.

10 For as much as god understands the^ that sing in Latin / though they
vnsterstand not themselves there praer is acceptable be for god.

11 As a father may forbid certane of his childer to mari so may a king in his
kingdom forbid certane of his subjects to mary / that is to say all the
prestes of his realm.

12 He that would take a way the popis ceremonies out of the church / should
drive away all godliness / and semlines / al religius and denowt behavior out
of the church.
