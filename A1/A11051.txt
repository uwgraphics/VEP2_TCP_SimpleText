THE MIRROVR OF VERTVE in Worldly Greatness. OR THE LIFE OF SIR Thomas More
Knight, sometime Lo. Chancellor of England.

AT PARIS. M. DC. XX VI.



TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LADY ELIZABETH COUNTESS OF BAMBVRY, etc.
RIGHT Honorable,
It was my good hap not long since, in a Friends House, to light upon a
brief History of the Life, Arraignement, and Death of that Mirror of all true
Honor, and Virtue Sir Thomas More, who by his Wisdom, Learning, and Santity,
has eternized his Name, Country, and Profession, throughout the Christian
World, with immortal Glory, and Renown.

Finding, by perusal thereof, the same replenished with incomparable
Treasures, of no less Worthy, and most Christian Factes, then of Wise, and
Religious Sentences, Apophthegmes, and Sayings; I deemed it not only an error
to permit so great a light to ly buried, as it were, within the vvalls of one
private Family: but also judged it worthy the Press, eue^ of a golden
Character (if it were to be had) to the end, the whole World might receive
comfort and profit by reading the same.

Having made this Resolution, a Difficulty presented it self to my Thoughts,
under whose Shaddovv, or Patronage I might best shelter the Work: unto vvch
strife, Your LADYSHIP, occurring to my cogitations, put an end, with he BEAMS
of your ^VORTH, and HONOR; so dazeling my ^yes, as I could discern ^one other
more (...), or Worthy to embrace, etc ^rotect so Glorious and Memorable
Examples.

Of whose GOODNESS I am so confide^t, ^at without further de^te, ^iudge, this
Enter^ange of Friendship ^ay vvorthily be made ^etvveene the SAINT and YOU.
YOU (Madame) shall Patronize his HONOR here on Earth; and HE, shall become a
Patron, and Intercessour for YOU in Heaven.

By him, that am your Ladyships professed Servant. T. P.

THE PREFACE of the Author.
FORASMVCH, as Sir Thomas More Knight, so^tymes Lord Chancellor of England, a
Man of singular Ver^ue, and of an unspotted Conscience; and (as witnesses
Erasmus) more pure, and white then snow: of so Angelical a Wit (says he)
that England never had the like before, nor ever shall again: A Man (I say)
universally well studied, not only in the Laws of our own Realm (a Study
able to occupy the whole life of a man) but also in all other Sciences both
Humane and Divine; was in his own days (and much more deservedly in these)
esteemed worth^ of perpetual Memory: I William Roper his most unworthy
Sonne-in^ law (by Marriage of his eldest Daughter) knowing no man living ^ this
day, able to speak more of (...) Life and Conversation, then my self who was
continually resident in (...) House for the space of sixteeneye^res and more;
have at the request ^ diverse worthy friends, put down writing, such things,
touching (...) same, as I can at this present well (...) to remembrance (having
through (...) negligence, forgotten many other v^ry notable passages thereof) to
the (...) that all should not utterly perish (...) posterity. The which I have
here performed, to my ability, in a plain an^ humble style; leaving the same
as a (...) subject to a more skillfull, and exqu^site Pen, when Time, and
Occasion shall offer themselves, to dilate thereof

THE LIFE OF Sir Thomas More.
SIR Thomas More was borne in London of worshipful Parents. His Father was a
Student of Lincolnes Inn, and brought him up in the Latintongue, at S.
Antonyes School in London, who was very shortly after, by his Fathers
procurement, received into the hou^ of that Worthy, and Learn^ Prelate,
Cardinal Mor^on; where though he was but young in years, he would in the
time of Christmas, suddenly step in amongst the Players, and there ex
tempore, without any study of the Matter, or least stay, or stammering in his
speech, make a part of his own present wit, amongst them: which was more
delightful, and pleasing to the Nobles, and Gentlemen that used to be at
Supper with the Cardinal, then all the premeditated parts of the Players.

This Cardinal took more delight in his wit, and towardnes, then he did of
any other temporal Matter whatsoever; and would often say of him, unto diverse
of his familiar friends, who used dinner and supp^r with him: This Child here,
wayting-at the table, whosoever shall live to see it, will prove a m^ruailous
Man.

And for his better furtherance in learning, he placed him at Oxford; where
when he was well instructed in the Greek and Latin tongues, he was then, for
the Common Laws of the kingdom, put to an Inn of Chancery, called New Inn;
where in small time he profited so well, that he was from thence admitted into
Lincolnes Inn, with very small ^llowance; continuing there his study, until
he was made Barrister.

After this, to his high Commendations, he read for a good space, a public
Lecture of S. Augustine de Ciuitate Dei in the Church of S. Laurence in the Old
^ewry in London, whereunto resorted one Doctor Corsin, an excellent Scholar,
and agreat Divine, and all the chief learned in, and about the City of London.

Then was he made Reader of Furuiualls Inn, where he remained for the space of
above three years; and then he gave himself wholly to devotion and prayer in
the Charter House at London, living there Religiously four years without vow;
during which time he often resorted to the house of one M. Col^ (a Gentleman in
Essex) who used many times to inuit him thither.

This M. Colt had three daughters, whose honest and virtuous ^ducations were
the chief Motives, that induced him to place his affection there: and albeit
his mind was most inclyned toward the second Sister, for that he thought her
the fairest, and best favored: yet when h^ considered, it would be both a
great grief, and some shame also to the eldest, to see her younger Sister
preferred in Marriage before her, he out of a kind of pity, then framed his
affection toward the eldest, and shortly after married her. After this he
continued his study of the Law at Lincolnes Inn until he was called to the
bench, and had there read twice, which is as often, as ordinarily any Judge of
the Law reads. He dwelt all this while at ^cklers-bury in London, where he
had, by his wife three daughters, and one Son, all brought up in virtue and
learning, from their very infancy: for he would always exhort them, to take
Virtue and Learning for their meat, and Play for their sauce.

Before he had ever been Reader in Court, he was in the later time of King
Henry the seventh made a Burgess of the Parliament: In which, was by the King
demanded three fifteens for the Marriage of his eldest daughter unto the King
of Scots. At the debating whereof he alleged such arguments and reasons
against the said demand, that the Kings expectation was utterly overthrown

Whereupon one M. Til^r a Gentleman of the Kings privy Chamber, being their
present, with all speed carried word to the King from the ParlamentHouse, That
a beardlesse boy, had disapoynted his Graces purpose. Upon which report the
King conceived great displeasure against M. More, and would not rest satisfied,
until upon a pretended causeless quarrel, his Father was committed to the
Tower, and there kept prisoner until he had paid an hundred pounds, for a fine.

Shortly hereupon it happened, that M. More coming about a suite to D. Fox,
Bishop of Winchester, one of the Kings privy Council; the Bishop called him a
side, and pretending great favor toward him, promised him, That if he would
be ruled by him he would not fail to restore him again into the Kings favor;
meaning forsooth, as he afterward coniectured, to make him confess a fault
against the King, whereby his Highness might with the better color take
occasion of displeasure against him. As he came from the Bishop, by chance he
met with one M. Whitford his familiar friend, then the Bishops Chaplain, but
afterward a Monk of Syon; and amongst other talk M. More told him what the
Bishop had said unto him, desyring his opinion and advise therein. Whereupon M.
Whitford prayed him, for the passion of God, in no wise to follow the Bishops
counsel: For my Lord my master (quoth he) to serve the Kings turn, will not
stick to ^gree to the death of his own Father. So M. More returned no more to
the Bishop: and had not ^he King soon after dyed, he ^as purposed to have left
the ^alme, and gone to some other ^arts beyond the Seas, knowing ^at being in
the Kings displea^ure, he could not live in En^and, without great danger.

After this he was made one of the Under sheriffs of London, by which (...),
and his learning (...), he has been often ^eard to say, that he gained, with
^ut grief of conscience, not so (...) as four hundred pounds (...) the year:
For that there was (...) matter of importance depen^ing at that time in
controversy (...) any of the Kings Courts, con^erning the laws of the Realm,
wherein he was not with one party in counsel.

For his wisdom and learning he was held in such honor and esteem, that
before he came to the service of King Henry the Eight, at the suite and
instance of our English Merchants, he was, with the Kings consent, twice sent
Ambassador, about certain business in co^trouersy betwixt them and the
Mercha^ts of the Stilliard. Whose wise and discreet dealinges therein, to his
high Commendatio^s, coming unto the Kings ea^e, he called immediatlye unto him
Cardinal Wols^y, then lord Chancellor, and willed him by all means to
procure, and work^ M. More into his service.

Whereupon the Cardinal accordin^ to the Kings pleasure, earnestly labored
with him, and amongst many other his persuasio^s, he alleged unto him, how
dear his service must needs be to the King, who could not out of Honor seem
to recompense him with less, then he should otherwise yearly loose thereby.
Yet was he loath to change his estate, and made such means to the King, by the
Cardinal, to the contrary, that his Majesty at that time, rested well
satisfied.

Shortly after, there happened a great ship of the Popes, to ar^ue at
Southampton, which was claymed by the King as a forfayture. But the Popes
Ambassador, by suite made unto the King, obtained, that he ^he might for his
Master hau^ Council learned in the Laws of this Realm, and the matter in
his own presence (being himself an excellent Ciuilian) to be openly hard and
discussed in some public place. At which ^tyme there was none, for our Laws,
found more fit to be of Council with the (...), then M. More, who could
report unto him in Latin, all the reasons and arguments on both sides
alleged.

Whereupon Counselors on both parties, in the presence of the Lord
Chancellor, and other the Judges of the Star Chamber ^ad audience accordingly
where M. More declared unto the Ambassador the whole effect of all ^eyr
opinions, and besides, in ^efence of his Clyent argued so earnedly himself,
that thereby ^ot only the Forfaiture afore^aid was again restored unto ^is
Holiness, but also he himself amongst all the Audience, ^or his upright and
commenda^le demeanor, was so greatly ^enowned, that the King from ^enceforth
by no means, or in^eaty would be moved to for^eare his service any longer.

Now, at his first entry into ^he Kings service, his Majesty ^ade him Ma^er of
Requests, ^auing the^ no better place voy^e, and within one month after he was
knighted, and made of (...) privy Council. And so from ^me to time did the
King still. ^duance him, to places of Ho^our; and he continued still in his
favor, and trusty service for more then twenty years. In which time the King
used often, especially upon (...) days (after he had done his own D^otions)
to send for him into his own Trauerse, and there in matters of Astronomy
Geometry, Divinity, and such like Faculties (yea and often times of his
temporal astayres to sit, and confer with him. Many times also in the night
the King would have him up into his leads, there to consider with him the
diverse scituations, courses, motions, and apparitions of the Stars, and
Planets. And for that he was ever of a merry and pleasant disposition, it
pleased the King and Queen very often to send for him, at time of dinne^ and
supper, as also many other ^ymes, to come and recreate with (...).

But when he perceived the King to take so much delight in ^is company, and
discourse, that (...) could not scarce once in a month get leave to go home to
(...) wife and children, nor that (...) could not be absent from court two
days together, without sending for again, he disliking this restraint of his
liberty, did thereupon begin, somewhat to dissemble his merry nature, retyring
himself by little and little from his accustomed mirth, so that he was from
thenceforth, sent for orderly by the King, at such times as was convenient.

In this mean time dyed one M. W^sto Treasurer of the Exchequer, whose office
after his decease, the King of his own free gift, and offer, bestowed upon Sir
Thom^s More. And in the fourteenth year of his Maiestyes raygne, there was a
Parliament holden at Westmynster, whereof Sir Tho. More was chosen Speaker: who
being very unwilling to take that office upon him, made an oration (not now
extant) to the Kings Majesty, for his discharge thereof. Whereunto wh^ the King
would not consent, he spoke unto his Majesty in this form, as follows.

Since I perceive (most undoubted Soueraygne) that it stands not with your
high Pleasure to reform this my Election, and cause it to be changed, but ^aue
by the mouth of the most ^euerend Father in God, your ^ighnesse Chancellor,
there^nto given your Royal assent, and of your gracious benignity ^etermined,
far above that I am ^le to bear, to strengthen me, and repute me fit for this
office, ^s chosen thereu^to by your Co^^ons; I am therefore now, and ^wayes
shall be ready obediently (...) conform my self to the ac^omplishment of your
high Co^^aundement, in most humble ^ise. Yet with your Graces fa^our, before I
further enter ^erinto, I make humble inter^ssion unto your Highness, for ^o
lowly Petitions: The one ^iuatly concerning my self, the ^her concerning your
whole ^sembly of Commons in Parliament. For my self (Gracious Soueraygne) that
if it sha^ happen me to mistake, in an^ thing, on the behalf of you^ Co^mo^s
in your highness (...) or for want of good vttera^ce (...) rehearsal of things,
to preuert o^ impair their prudent instructions; It may then like you^ most
Royal Majesty, with you^ abundant grace, in the Eye o^ your accustomed Pity,
to (...) my simplicity, giving me leau^ to repair again unto the Common
House, there to conferre^ new with them, and take the^ more substantial
advice, wh^ thing, and in what wise, I she on their behalf utter and speak^
before your M^esty, to the in^tent their prudent aduises an^ (...) be not by my
simplicit^ ^d folly hindered or impaired. which thing, if it should hap^n unto
me (as it is not vnlike^ if your Gracious Benignity ^lieued not my oversight
ther^, it could not but during my (...) be a perpetual grudge and ^uines unto
my heart. And this my first petition unto your (...) Majesty.

My other suite (most Excel^t Prince) is, that for as much there be of your
Commons (...) assen^led in Parliament, (...) your high commandment, ^ynber,
which after the ac^ manner, are appoyn^d by the common House, to ^t and advise
of the common ^yres apart, amongst them: And albeit (most Liege ^d) that
according to your most prudent advice, by yo^ Honorable Writs, every when
declared, there has been a d^ diligence used in sending up (...) your Highness
Court of Parl^ment, the most discreet person^ out of every quarter, esteem^
most fit thereto, whereby the^ is gathered, no doubt, a ver^ substantial
Assembly of righ wise and politic Persons: Y^ (most virtuous Prince) since
amongst so many, every man (...) not alike witted, or so well spoken, as other;
and it often happens, that much folly is uttered, in a painted speech; As l^
kewise, many that are boyst^ rous and rude in language, do y^ give right good
substa^tiall Counsel; And moreover in matters (...) great Importance, the
myn^ happens to be so busied, that often times a man studieth rather what to
say, then how to speak, by reason whereof the wisest man, and best speaker in
a whole Country, fortuneth sometimes (his mind being fervent in the matter) to
speak in such wise, as he would afterward wish, to have been otherwise
spoken, and yet no worse will had he, when he spoke it, then he has, when he
would so gladly change it: Therefore (most gracious Sovereign) considering
that in your High Court of Parliament nothing is treated of, but matter of
weight and importance, and which does chiefly, and merely concern this your
most ^ourishing Realm, and your own Royal Estate, it would please your
Royal Majesty, out of your abou^dant Clemency and favor, to give to all your
Commons here assembled, your most gracious license, and pardon, freely, without
fear of your high displeasure, every man to discharge his Conscience, and
boldly, in every thing incident amongst us, to declare his advice. And
whatsoever any man shall happen to say, that it may like your Royal Majesty,
of your inestimable Goodness, to take all in good part, interpreting every man's
words (how unwisely soever they be spoken) to proceed of good zeal toward
the profit of your Realm, and dignity of your Royal Person; the prosperous
Estate and preservation whereof (most dread Sovereign) is the thing which ^l we
your most humble, and loving ^ubiects, according to the bou^^n duty of our
natural Alle^iance, most highly desire, and ^ray for.

At this Parliament Cardinal ^olsey found himself much grie^d with the
Burgesses thereof, ^or that nothing was either ^oken, or done in the Parla^ent
house, but was immediat^y blown abroad in every Ale^ouse and Tavern. It
fortuned ^lso at this Parliament, that a very great Subsidy was demaun^d, which
the Cardinal fea^ing would ^t (...) the Lower (...), did (...) (...) ^or the
furtherance thereof, to (...) there personally present. Against whose coming,
after long debate there made, whether it were better to receive him, but with a
few of his Lords, or with his whole train: Maister^ (quoth Sir Thomas More)
for a^ much, as my Lord Cardinal (ye wot well) lately laid to our charge, the
lightness of our tongues, for things uttered out of this house, therefore in my
mind it shall not be amiss to receive him with all Pomp, with his Maces, his
Pillars, his Pollaxes, his Crosses, his Hat, and the great Seal too, to the
intent, that if he find the like fault with us hereafter, we may be the bolde^
from our selves to lay the blam^ upon himself, and those followers which his
Grace brings hither with him. Whereunto the whole House agreed and received
him accordingly.

After he was come and recea^ed in manner aforesaid, the whole house of
Parlame^t sitting ^till in silence, and answearing nothing to what he
demanded, ^ut rather contrary to his expectation, seemed not any way to
^nclyne to his Request, he said unto them: Masters, you have ^re many wise and
learned men amongst you, and since I am sent (...) from the Kings own Person,
for the preservation of your selves, and all the Realm, me thinks you should
give me ^ome reasonable answer. Whe^at every man continuing si^nt; then began
he to speak to ^ne M. Warney, who making him no answer neither, he se^erally
asked the same Question of diverse others that were accounted the wisest men of
the house: To whom when none of them all would answer so much as a word, it
being before agreed among them, to answer only by their speaker: Masters
(quoth the Cardinal) unless it be the custom of your house, as of likelihood
it is, by the mouth of your speaker, whom you have chosen for trusty and wise
(as indeed he is) in such cases to utter your minds, without doubt here is a
marvelous obstinate silence, and thereupon he required answer of M. Speaker.
Who first reverently upon his knees excusing the silence of the House, abashed
at the presence of so Noble a Personage, able to amaze the wisest and best
learned in a kingdom; and after by many probable arguments proving that for
them to make answer, was neither expedient nor agreeable with the ancient
Liberty of the House; in conclusion for himself showed, that although they had
with all their voices chosen and trusted him to speak, yet except every one of
the^ could put into his own head all their several wits, he alone in so
weighty a matter, was far unmeet to make his Grace answer.

Whereupon the Cardinal displeased with Sir Thomas More (who had not in this
Parliament satisfied his desire) suddenly arose and departed. And after the
Parliament was ended, at his House in the Gallery at Whit^ Hall in Westminister,
he uttered unto him his griefs, saying: I would to God M. More, you had been
at Rome when I first made you Speaker of the ParlamentHowse. Your Grace not
offended, I would I had been there my Lord (quoth Sir Thomas.) And to wynd
these quarrels out of the Cardinals head he began to commend that Gallery, and
said: I like this Gallery of yours my Lord, much better the^ your Gallery at
Hampton Court; wherewith he so wisely brake off the Cardinals displeasant
talk, that the Cardinal at that ^yme, as it seemed, knew not what more for
the present to ^ay unto him.

But yet for a Revenge of his displeasure, the Cardinal counseled the king to
send Sir Tho^is More Ambassador over in^ Spain, commending unto (...) his
wisdom, learning, and ^tnes for the voyage; and fur^er told the King that the
diffi^ulty of the cause considered; ^ere is none (quoth the Cardi^all) so
meet, or able to per^rme your Maiestyes service ^rin, as he. Which when the
^ing had broken to Sir Thomas More, and that he had satisfied ^is Majesty how
unfit a voyage (...) was for him, the nature of the ^ountrey, and disposition
of his ^omplexion considered, that he should never be able, nor likely ^o do
his Grace acceptable serui^e there, knowing right well, that if his Majesty
sent him thi^her, he should send him to his Grave; yet showing himself
^uerthelesse ready, according (...) his duty, although it were wi^ the loss of
his life, to fulfill (...) Graces pleasure in that behalf^ the King well
allowing of h^ answer said unto him. It is n^ our meaning M. More, to (...)
you the least hurt, but rather the best good; we will therefore f^ this purpose
devise upon some other, and employ your serui^ otherwise.

And indeed such entire aff^ ction did the King at that tym^ bear unto him,
that he mad^ him Chancellor of the Duch^ of Lancast^r, upon the death (...)
Sir Richard Wingfield, who ha^ that Office before. And the kin^ took so much
pleasure in hi^ company, that oftentimes (...) Majesty would on the sudden go
up to his house at Chelsey, to be merry with him; whither on a time coming to
dynner, he walked in Sir Thomas Mores garden by the space of an hour, and held
his arm about Sir Thomas Mores neck.

As soon as his Majesty was gone, M. William Roper, a Gentleman of Grayes
Inn, who had married Sir Thomas Mores eldest daughter said unto him: Father,
how happy a man are you, whom the King has thus familiarly entertained (for
he never was seen to do the like unto any man, except Cardinal Wols^y, with
whom the King did often walk arm in arm:) I thank our Lord God, Son
Roper (quoth he) I find his Grace my very good Lord indeed. And I think he
does as singularly favor me, as any subject within this Realm; Howbeit, Son
Roper, I may tell thee, (...) have no great cause to be proud thereof. But if
my Head could wyn his Majesty a Castle in France (for then there was war with
France) it should not fail to go.

Amongst many other his virtues he was of such M^kenes, that if he happened to
enter into argument, or dispute with any learned man resorting to him from
Oxford, Cambridge, or other place (as there did diverse, some for desire of his
acquaintance, some for the famous report of his wisdom and learning, and some
about suites for ^he Universities) although very few were comparable unto him
as well witnesses Erasmus:) and ^f (...) discourse, he so pressed ^he^ that
they cold not well hold (...) it longer disputation against ^im; then least he
should discou^age the^ (as one that sought not ^is own Glory) he would seem
^onquered, and by some wise de^se, courteously break off into ^me other
matter, and give over. Of whom for his wisdom and earning the king had such
an o^ion, that at such times as he ^ttended his person, in his pro^resse either
to Oxford, or Cam^ridge, where he was received with very eloquent Orations, ^is
Majesty would always as^gne Sir Thomas More, as one ^rompt, and ready therein,
to make Answer thereunto, ex tempore.

His custom also was, that whensoever he came to any University, either here
or beyond the Seas, not only to be present at Disputations and Readinges, but
also to dispute very learnedly himself, to his high Commendations, and
general applause of all the assembly.

During the time of his Chau^cellorship for the Duchy of Lancaster, he was sent
twice Ambassador, joined in commission with Cardinal Wolsey, once unto the
Emperor Charles into Flanders, the other time unto the French King at Paris.

About this time, it happened that the Water-bayly of London who had sometimes been
Sir Thomas Mores servant, hearing certain Merchants to speak so^ what
lauishly against his old (...), was so displeased thereat, that he came with all
speed to (...) (...) More, and told him what he h^ heard, and of whom. Sy^
(quoth he) if I were in such (...) and authority with my Pr^ce, as you are,
such men as these should not surely be (...), so uncharitably and falsely to
misreport and s^under me. Wherefore I with you to call the^ before you and punish
them. Sir Thomas (...) smyling upon him said: Why, M. Water-bayly, would you
have me punish them, by whom I receive more benefit then by all you, that are
my ^riends? Let them a Gods Name ^peake as lewdly of me as they list, and
shoot never so many darts at me. So long as they do not hit me, what am I the
wor^? But if they should once hit me, then would it not indeed a little trouble
me: Howbeit I trust by Gods help, there shall none of them all be able to
touch me. Therefore I have more cause, (...) assure thee M. Water-baily to
pity, th^n to be angry with them. Such sruitefull communication would he often
times have with his familiar Friends.

So on a time walking a long the Thames side at Chels^y, with his Son in law
M. Roper, and discoursing of many things, amongst other speeches he said thus
unto him: Now I would to our Lord God, Son Roper, that three things were well
established in Christendom, upon co^^itio^ that I were here presently ^ut into
a sack, and cast into the (...) of the Thames. What great things be those Sir
(quoth M. Ro^er) that move you so to wish? ^ouldest thou know Son Ro^er,
quoth he? May it so please ^ou Sir, with a very good will, ^yd M. Roper. In
^ayth Son (...), they be these: First, that where the most part of Chri^tian
Princes are now at mortal ^arres, I would they were all ^tan universal peace.
The second (...), that where the Church is at ^his present, sore afflicted with
Errors and Heresies, that it were ^etled in a perfect uniformity ^f Religion.
The third is, that where the Kings matter of his ^arriage is now come into
question, I wish it were, to the glory of God, and (...) of all parties,
brought to a good conclusion. By which three things (as M. Rop^ supposed) he
^ged, that there would be a great disturbance, through the mo^ pa^ of (...)
(...).

Thus di^ Sy^ The. More through the whole course of his li^, by his ac^ons make
it appe^e, that all hi^ (...) and pay^, without thought of earth^ (...) ^ther
to himself or any of his, were only for the seru^ of God, his King and the
Common Wealth, wholly bestowed and ^mployed. And he was oftentimes, in his
latter days heard to say, That he never asked of the King for himself, the
value of one Penny. His daily custom was, if he were at home, besides his
pri^ate prayers with his wife, chil^ren, and family, often to retire ^lone, and
exercise himself in ^riuate, and godly devotions: as iso every night before
he went ^o bed, he used to go to his chap^ell with his whole Family a^oresaid,
and there upon his knees ^euoutly to say, certain Le^yes, Psalms and Collects
with them.

And because he was always ^yrous of private Exercise, and that he might the
better withdraw himself from wordly co^^any, he built himself a lodging a
good distance from his Man^ion house, called the New Buildin^, wherein he
placed a Chapel, Library, and a Gallery to walk, spending many days in the
week in P^ayer, and Study together. And always on the ^day, he did usually
(...) there from Morning until Night, be^owing hi^ time only in me^ation,
reading, and such ^ly (...).

And the more to stir up and (...) his wife, and children, to the ^yre of
heavenly things, he would oftentimes use these speeches unto the^: It is no
ma^stery for you, my Children to go to heaven; for every body gives you good
counsel, and likewise many show you good Examples. You see Virtue rewarded,
and Vice punished; so that you are carried up to heaven, even by the chynne:
But if you live to the time, that no ^an will give you good coun^ell, nor show
you good exam^le; when you shall see Virtue ^unished, and Vice rewarded; if
^hen you will stand fast and stick ^irmely unto God; upon pain ^f my life,
though you be but ^alfe good, yet God will allow ^ou for wholly good.

If his wife, children, or any ^f his How should, had been ^cke, or troubled
at any time with any infirmity, he would ^y unto the^: We may not look ^t our
pleasure to go to Heaven (...) feather beds; it is not the way: ^or our Blessed
Lord himself went thither with great pain, and by many Tribulations; and ^ard
was the pathway wherein he so walked: Nor may the Servant, look to be in
better case, then his Master.

And as he would in this man ner always persuade them t^ take their pains and
sickness patiently, so would he in like for^ teach them to withstand the d^uell,
and his temptations valiant^ ly saying: Whosoever shall mar^ well the devil
and his temptations, shall find him therein much like unto an Ape. For as an
Ap^ not well looked unto, will b^ busy, and bold to do shrewd turns, and being
espied will suddenly leap back, and aduen ture no further so the devil fi^
ding a man idle, sloathfull, an^ without resistance, ready to r^ ceiue his
temptations, waxeths^ hardy, that he will not stick t^ continue still with
him, until (...) has wrought him througly (...) his purpose. But on the
contrary side, if he see a man with diligence persevere to prevent, and
withstand his temptations, he waxes so weary, that in the end ^e utterly
forsakes him. For as ^he devil by disposition is a spirit of so high a Pride,
that he cannot abide to be mocked; so is he ^f nature so Envious, that he
^eareth to assault a virtuous man, least he should thereby not ^nly catch a
fou^e fall himself, ^ut also minister unto the man, ^ore matter of merit.

Thus he ever delighted, not ^nly to busy himself in virtuous ^xercises, but
also to exhort his ^ife, children, and how should to ^brace, and follow the
same. (...) who me for his notable ver^es, God showed, as it seemed, a
miraculous and manifest token of his love, and favor toward him, at such
time, as his daughter Roper lay dangerously sick of the sweating sickness (as
many others did that year) and continued in such extremity of that disease,
that by no skill of Physic, or other art in such case^ commonly used,
(although she had diverse both expert and learned Physicians continually
attendant about her) she could be kept from sleeping, so that the Physicians
themselves utterly despayred of her recovery, and quite gave her over. Her
Father Sir The, More, as one that m^ intierely loved and tendered he^ being in
great grief and hea^, and seeing all human^ helps to fa^le, determined t^ have
recourse to God by prayer for remedy. Whereupon going up after his accustomed
manner, into his aforesaid New Building, he there in his Chapel, upon his
knees with tears, most devoutly besought Almighty God, that it would please
his divine Goodness, unto whom nothing was impossible, if it were his blessed
will, to vouchsafe graciously to hear his humble petition. And suddenly it
came into his mind, that a Glister might be the only way to help her; of which
when he had told the Physicians, they all instantly agreed, that if there were
any hope of remedy, that was the most likelist; and meruayled much, that
themselves had not before remembered the same. Then was it instantly ministered
unto her sleeping, and after a while she awaked, and contrary to all their
expectations immediately began to recover, and in short time was wholly restored
unto her former health. Whom, if it had pleased God to have taken away, at
that time, her Father said, that he would never after have meddled with worldly
business.

Now whilst Sir Tho^as More was Chau^cellour of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Sea
of Rome chanced to be void, by the death of Pope Leo the X. which was the
cause of much trouble; for that Cardinal Wol^y a man of a very high and
ambitious spirit, aspiring unto that sea and dignity, was therein crossed and
prevented by the Emperor Charles (...) fifth, who had commended (...)
Cardinal Adrian (some^me his Schoole-maister) unto (...) Conclaue of
Cardinals in ^ome, at the time of election, and (...) highly praised him for
his ^orth and Virtue, that he was ^ereupon chosen Pope. Who ^mming from Spayn^
(where (...) was then resident) to Rome, ^tred into the City toward (...)
Palace barefooted with such ^umility, that all the people ^ad him in very
great Reue^ence.

Upon this and other like occa^ons, Card. Wolsey enraged with ^nger, studied
all the ways he ^ould devise to be revenged of ^e Emperor, which as it was
^he beginning of a most lamen^ble Tragedy, so some part thereof, not impertinent
to my pr^sent purpose, I have thought (...) here to insert.

The Cardinal, not ignorant o^ King Henry's inconstant and mutable
disposition, used all meaned^ to auert his Majesty, from hi^ wife Queen
Katherine, the Emperors Aunt, well knowing he would easily inclyne to tha^
motion upon any slight occasion. And so meaning to mak^ the Kings flexible
Nature, the instrument to bring about hi^ ungodly purpose, he devised to allure
his Majesty (who was al^ ready, contrary to the Cardina^ mind, and knowledge,
fallen i^ love with the Lady Anne Bullen to affect the French Kings Sister
Which thing, because of the wars, and hatred that was the^ ^etweene the French
King, and ^e Emperor (whom the Car^inall now mortally hated) he ery^
earnestly indeauoured to ^rocure. And for the better fur^ering this his
purpose, he re^uested one Langland, Bishop of ^incolne, and Ghostly Father to
(...). Hen^y, to put a scruple into ^he K. head; that it was not law^ for him
to mary his Brothers ^ife; which thing the King (not ^ry to hear of) related
first to (...) Thomas More, and required his ^ounsell therein, and with all
^ewed himsome places of Scriture which seemed somewhat (...) serve his purpose.
Sir Thoma^ ^ore: perusing the said places, ^ereupon (as one that had ne^r
professed Divinity) excused ^mselfe unto his Majesty, and said, he was far
unfit to meddle with such affairs.

The King not satisfied with this answer, pressed and urged him the more;
which he perceauing said unto his Majesty: that for as much as such a business
required good advise and deliberation, he besought his Highness to give him
sufficient respit to consider advisedly of the same. Wherewith the King well
contented, replied, That Tonstall and Clark, Bishops of Durham and Bath, with
others learned of his privy Counsel should also be dealers therein.

So Sir Thomas More departed, and conferred those places of Scripture with the
Expositions of diverse of the ancient Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, and
at his coming to Court and talking with the King of the aforesaid matter, he
said: To be plain with your Grace, neither my Lord of Durham, nor my Lord of
Bath, though I hold them to be both learned. ver^uous, and holy Prelates, nor
my self, with any other of your Counsel (being all your Maie^ties own
servants, and so great^y bound unto you for your ma^ifold benefits daily
bestowed upon us) be in my judgment fit Counselors for your Grace he^ein. But
if your Majesty desire ^o understand the Truth, such Counselors may be found,
as neither for respect of world^ commodity, nor for fear of ^our Princely
authority, will any way be drawn to deceiu^ ^ou. And then he named unto the
King S. Hierome, S. Augustine and diverse others ancient Fathers and Doctors of
the Church, both Greek an Latin; and further showed his Majesty, what
authority he had gathered forth of them: of which although the King (as not
fitting to his purpose) did not very well like, yet were they by Sir Thomas
More^ so wisely alleged, and so tempred with discretion, that the King at that
time, took it in good part, and had oftentimes conference with him again,
about the same matter.

After this there were certain questions propounded to the Kings Counsel
whether in this case the King needed to have any scruple at all; and if he had,
what was the best way to fre^ him of it? The greater part of the Counsel were
of opinion, that there was good cause of scruple, and that for his Majesty's
discharge therein, it was fit suite should be made unto the Sea of Rome, where
the King thought that by his liberality, he might with ease obtain his purpose.

The^ was there procured from Rome a commission for the try all of this
Marriage, wherein Cardinal Campegius, and Cardinal Wolsey were joined
commissioners, who for the determination thereof, sat at the Blacke-Fryers in
London, where a Libell was put in for the anulling of the said M^triomony,
affirming the Marriage between the King and Q^eene to be unlawful. Then
again, for proof thereof to be lawful, there was produced (...) dispensation,
in which (after diverse disputations thereupo^ holden) there appeared an
imperfection; which notwithstanding by an other instrument, or Breu^ found out
upon search, in the Treasury of Spain, and sent oue^ to the commissioners in
Engla^d^ was supplied; and so should judgment have been given by the Pop^
accordingly, had not the King upon intelligence thereof before the same
Judgment, appealed to a General Counsel. After whose Appellation, the
Cardinals sat^ no more upon that business.

It happened, before the sa^ matter of Marriage brought in Question, that M.
Roper being one day in discourse with Sy^ Tho. More, did with a kind of ^oy,
congratulate with his said Father, for the happy Estate of the Realm that had
so Catho^ique a Prince, as no Heretic durst show his face, so virtuous and
learned a Clergy, so grave and sound a Nobility, and so lo^ing and obedient
Subjects, all ^n one faith agreeing together. Troth, it is so indeed, Son
Ro^er (quoth he:) and then commended all degrees and estates of the same, far
beyond M. Roper. And yet Son Roper (quoth he) I pray God, that some of us (as
high as we seem to sit upon the Mountains, treading Hereti^ques under our
feet like Ants) ^ue not to see the day, when we gladly would wish to be in
league and composition with those whom you call Heretics, and to let them
have their Church^ quietly to themselves, upon co^^ dition, that they would be
content to let us have ours, quie^ to our selves.

Then M. Roper produce^ many reasons to the contrary and saw no cause why any
should say so. Well, well. Son Rop^ (quoth he) I pray God some (...) us live
not till that day, and (...) no more. To whom M. (...) replied, By my troth
Sir, th^s (...) desperately spoken, seeming (...) be half angry with Sir (...)
More: who perceiving the (...) said merrily unto him: Well, (...) Son Rop^r,
It shall not be then since you will not have it so^ Thus was he of so excellent
(...) temper, that those who lived, and were continually co^uersant with him in
his house, for the space (...) twenty years and vpwardes, ^ould never perceive
him to be ^nce moved, or to make the ^ast show of anger.

But to return again where ^eft. After the supplying of the ^spensation, sent
unto the com^ioners into England, as is before rehearsed, the King ta^ng the
business to himself, as ^t then mynding to proceed ^y further in the matter,
assi^ed the Bishop of Durham and (...) Thomas More to go Embassa^urs to Cambray
(a place nei^er Imperial, nor French) to ^eat a Peace between the Em^rour,
the French King, and him^fe; in the concluding whereof ^r Tho. More so worthily
man^ged the business, that he procured thereby much more benefit for the
Kingdom, then was at that time by the King and his Counsel thought possible
could be compassed. For whose good service in that Embassy, the King (when he
after made him Lord Chancellor) caused the Duke of Norfolk, to declare
openly to the people, how much all ^ngland was bounden unto him, as you shall
see hee^after more (...) large.

Now upon the coming home of the Bishop of Durham, and Sy^ Thomas More from
Cambray aforsayd, the King began to rene^ again his old suite, and wa^ very
earnest in persuading Sy^ Thomas More to agree unto the matter of his marriage,
vsin^ all the ways, and means (...) could devise to draw him to his part, and
as it was thought did the rather for that end soon after create him Lord
Chauncel^our of England. And the King said further unto him, that al^hough at
his going to Cambray, he was in utter despair to ob^ne dispensation thereof;
yet ^ow he had conceived some go^d hope to compass the same; ^eaging, that
albe^t his Mar^iage, as being against the posi^ue Law of the Church, and the
^itten Law of God, was hol^en by the dispensation; yet is ^here another thing
found out ^flate (quoth the King) whereby ^his Marriage appears so dire^tly
against the law of Nature, that it can in no wise, by the Church be
dispensable, as Do^or Stokesley (whom he had then preferred to the Bishopric
of London) can well instruct you, with whom, upon this point, I would have you
to confer.

So they conferred togeather^ But for all this Conference, Sir Thomas More
could not be induced to change his opinion therein: Yet notwithstanding did the
Bishop in his Report o^ him to the King, affirm falsely that he found Sir
Thomas More, in the Kings cause, very forward, as being desirous to find some
good matter, wherewith he might serve the Kings contentment, in that case.

Now, this Bishop Stokesley having a little before, been by Cardinal Wolsey
openly rebuked in the Sarre-chamber, and awarded (...) the Flecte, he not well
broo^ing this contumelious usage; and knowing that forasmuch (...) the
Cardinal, for his backe^ardnes in pursuing the Kings ^uorse, was falling out
of his ^ghnes favor; and that he had ^ow espied a fit opportunity to ^euenge
his quarrel against the ^ardinall, and to incense the ^ing further against him;
at ^ast prevailed so far, that the Cardinal was soon after dis^laced from his
office of high Chancellorship, and the same was conferred upon Sir Thomas ^ore,
hoping thereby so to win ^im to his side, that he would ^ield his consent for
the matter ^f divorce.

Then was Sir Thomas More between the Dukes of (...) and N^rfolke, brought
through (...) Hall, to his place (...) the Chancery, and the Duke (...)
Norfolk^ in the audience of (...) the people there assembled, (...) wed, that
he was from the (...) himself straitley charged (...) special commi^ion, to
(...) the^e openly in the presence (...) them all, how much all (...) was
beholding to Sir (...) (...), for his good service: an^ how worthily he
de^erued the highest room in the Kingdom and further how dear his Majesty
loved and trusted him; wher^in (quoth the Duke) he hat^ great cause to rejoice,
and prays^ Almighty God.

Whereunto Sir Thomas More (amongst diverse other wise and ^arned speches) made
answer and replied, that allthough he ^ad good cause to take comfort (...) his
Highness singular favor ^wards him, to whom therefor he acknowledged himself
^ost deeply bounden; yet ne^erthelesse he must for his own ^art needs
confess, that in all ^ose things, by the Duks Grace ^here alleged, he had
done nothing, but what was his duty. and furthermore said, That he ^as very
unfit for that dignity, ^herein (considering how wise and worthy a Prelate, had
lately before taken so great a fall) he said he had no great cause to re^oyce.
And as they had before in ^he Kings behalf, charged him (...) minister Justice
uprightly and ^ndiffere^tly to the people, without corruption or affection:
(...) did he likewise charge them again, that if they saw him, at any time to
digress, in the least thing, touching any part of hi^ duty, in that honorable
Office, even as they would discharg their own duty and fidelity (...) God and
the King, they would not fail to decla^e the same to his Majesty; who
otherwise, might have just cause to lay the fault wholly upon them, and to their
charge.

Now, when he was Lord Chancellor, on a time being at leisure (as seldom he
was) a Son in law of his, who had married one of his daughters, spoke merrily
unto him saying: When Cardinal Wolsey was Lord Chancellor, not only ^iuers
of his privy Chamber, but ^uch also as were but his very ^oor-keepers got much
proffit: and now since I have married one ^f your daughters, and give my ^ayly
attendance upon you^, I ^hinke I might of reason look ^or (...) (...) (...)
^oyle all (...), (...) (...) you be so (...) (...) (...) to hear every (...)
(...) p^re as rich; and be^ (...) (...) no doors shut (...) (...), which is to
me no (...) (...) and discoura^e^t; whereas otherwise some ^or friendship,
some for kyn^red, but most for profit, would (...) glad to have my furtherance
(...) bring them to your presence. And now as the case stands, if (...) should
take any thing of them, know I should do them much wrong, for that they may do
(...) much for themselves, as I (...) able to do for the^. Which thin^ though
it be in you very com^ mendable, yet to me your Son^ I find it nothing
profitable.

You say well, Son (quo^ Sir Thomas More) I do not m^ like that you are so
scrupulo^ of conscience, for there be many other ways, wherein I man both do
you good, and pleasur^ your friend also; for sometym^ may I by my word stand
yo^ friend instead, and sometim^ I may by my letters help hi^ or if he have a
cause dependi^ before me, at your request I m^ hear him before another; o^ his
cause be not altogether (...) the best, yet may I move the pa^ ties to fall to
some reasonab^ end, or compound by arbitrament: Howbeit this one thing Son, I
assure thee, on my Faith, that if the parties will at my hands call for
justice, then if ^it were my Father that stood on the one side, and the Devil
on the other side, his cause being good, the Devil surely should have right.

So offered he to his Son as much favor as he thought he could in reason
require. And that he would for no respect digress never so little from justice,
did plainly appear by another of his Sonns in law, one M. Giles H^ron, who
had a sorry suite depending before him in the Cha^cery, yet presuming much upon
his Fathers favor, would in no ways be persuaded by him to come to an
indifferent compositio^ with his adversary; whereupon in trial of the matter,
Sir Thomas M^re pronounced sentence against him.

He used every afternoon to sit in his open Hall, to the end, that whosoever
had any suit unto him, they might the more boulder come to his presence, and
there to open their Complayints before him. Also his manner was, to read every
Bill himself, before he would grant any Sub poena, and having read it, he
would either set his hand unto it, or else cancel it.

Whenever he passed through Westminster Hall, to his place in Chancery, by the
Court of Kings Be^^h, if his Father (one of the Judges thereof) had bin there
set before he came, he would go into the same Court, and there most reverently
upon his knees before the whole Assembly, ask his Father blessing. As
likewise, if his Father and he chanced to meet at the Lecture in Lincolnes In^e
(as oftentimes they did) yet, notwithstanding his high place and Office, would
he offer in Argument, the pre-eminence unto his Father; nor would himself
accept thereof, until his Father had refused it.

And for further declaration of his natural affection, and love toward his
Father, when he lay sick upon his death bed, he did not only (according to his
duty) oftentimes come and visit him, with all manner of comfort, but also at
his departure out of the world, he took him about the Neck, kissed, and
embraced him, commending his soul into merciful hands of Almighty God, and so
departed.

Whilst he was Lord Chancellor, he granted but few Injunctions; yet were
they by some of the Judges of the Law misliked, which M. Roper understanding,
declared the same unto Sir Thomas More, who answered, that they should have
little cause to find fault with him therefore. Whereupon he caused one M. Crook,
chief of the six Clerks to make a Docket containing the whole number and
causes of all such Injunctions, as either in his time had already passed, or at
the present depended in any of the Kings Courts at Westminster before ^im;
which done, he one day in^ all the Judges to dinner with him in the Counsel
Cha^^er at Westminster, and after ^ynner, when he had broken with them, what
co^playnts he had heard of his Injunctions, and moreover had showed them the
^umber and causes of every one ^n order, truly and plainly, they were all
enforced to confess, that themselves in like cases could have done no
otherwise. Then made he this offer unto them, That if the Judges of eue^y Court
(unto whom the reformation of the rigor of the Law, by reason of their Office
most especially appertayned) would upon reasonable considerations in their own
discretions (as he thought they were bound to do in conscience) mitigate, and
reform the rigor of the law themselves, there should from thenceforth be no
more Injunctions granted out by him. Whereunto when they refused to
condescend, then said he unto them: For as much as your selves (my Lords) force
me to that necessity, of granting out Injunctions, for relief of the peoples
injuries, you cannot hereafter any more justly blame me.

After that, he spoke privately to M. Roper saying: I perciue why they liked not
so to do, for they see that they may by the verdict of the Jury, cast all
quarrels upon those whom they account their chief defense, and therefore am I
compelled, to abide the adventure of all such Reports.

Now in the time of his Chancellourshippe, allthough he had but little leisure,
to busy himself in the study of holy Scriptures and Controversies in Religion,
with other such like Exercises, being in a manner continually employed about
the affairs of the King and Kingdom; yet did he take many watchful pains in
setting forth diverse profitable works, in the defense of Christian Religion,
against Heresies, that then were blown abroad. In so much that the Bishops, to
whose Pastoral care that Reformation chiefly belo^ged, seeing themselves, by
his travel (wherein by their own confession, they were not any way able to
compare with him) in great part discharged of the^r duties in that behalse; and
considering, that for all the Princes favor, and his great Office he was no
rich man, nor had in yearly revenues adua^ced himself as his worthynes
deserved, therefore at a Convocation, holden amongst themselves, and others of
the Clergy, they agreed to recompense him with a sum of five thousand pounds,
for his pains taken in their behalf.

To the payment whereof every Bishop, Abbot, and others of the Clergy, according
to the rates of their abilityes, became liberal Contributaries; hoping that
this their liberality would give him good content. Whereupon Bishop Tonstall of
Durha^, Bishop Clarke of Bath, and D. Voysey Bi^hop of Exceter repaired unto
(...) Tho. More, declaring how ^hankefully, to their discharge ^n Gods cause,
they reckoned ^hemselues unto him; and albeit ^hey could, not according to his
deserts, so worthily requite his ^ours, and therefore must refer ^he same to
Gods gracious good^esse: yet for a small gratuity, in ^espect of his Estate so
unequal ^o his Worth, in the Name of their whole Convocation, they presented
unto him the forsaid ^umme, desiring him to accept of it in good part. But Sir
Tho^as More refusing this their ten^er, said unto them: That, as it was no
small comfort unto him that so wise and learned men accepted of his weak
labors, for which he never intended to receive any other reward, but at the
hands of God, to whom alone all the thanks thereof were chiefly to be
ascribed: So gave he most humble thanks unto all their Honors, for their so
friendly and honorable consideration, and earnestly entreated them to return
every man his money again.

Wherefore when after much pressing him to accept thereof, and cold not prevail,
they besought him, that they might bestow it upon his Wife, and Children Not so
my Lords (quoth he,) had rather see it cast into the Thames, then either I, or
any (...) mine should have the value (...) one penny thereof. For, my Lords,
though your offer indeed be very fair and friendly, yet set I so much by my
pleasure, and so little by my profit, that I would not, in good faith, for so
much, and much more, to have lost so many a good nights sleep, as I spent upon
the same. And yet I would wish, for all that, upon condition that Heresies were
suppressed, that all my Books were burned, and my labor lost. Thus departed
they from him, and were driven to return every man his own money again.

This Lord Chancellor, although he was well known, both to God and the world
to be a man of most eminent Virtue, though not so considered of every man; yet
for the avoiding of singularity would he appear to the ey of the world no
otherwise then other men, as well in his apparel, as behavior. And albeit he
appeared outwardly Honorable, like to one of his Dignity and Calling, yet
inwardly did he esteem all such things for mere vanity: for next to hi^ naked
body he wore almost continually a shirt of hair; the (...) a young
Gentlewoman, named M. rs More, by chance on day (...) pying as he sat in his
doublet and hose at dynner in the so^mer time, and seemed to smile thereat, his
daughter Roper perceiving the same (being not ignorant of this his austerity)
gave him private notice thereof, and he did presently amend the fault, seeming
withal sorry, that she had feene it. He also wore another plain course shirt
without ruff or collar, upon his shirt of hair; And many times he likewise
punished his body with whips, made of knotted cords; the which thing was only
known to his daughter Roper, who for her secresy, above all the r^st he
especially trusted, for that as need required she did always wash and mend his
shirt of hair, which he would not discover unto any other whatsoever.

Now, in this mean space, whilst he was Lord Cha^cellour of England, the King
did one day greatly move him, and desire him, well to weigh and consider of his
great matter, concerning his divorce. Sir Thomas More falling upon his knees,
most humbly besought his Majesty to stand still his gracious Sovereign, as
ever since his entry into his Royal Service, he had found him; and said, that
there was nothing in the world more grievous to his heart, then that he was not
able with the loss of one of his lymbes, to find any thing for that matter,
whereby he might with safe conscience serve his Majesty's turn. And that he had
always borne in mind the most Godly words, that his Highness spoke unto him,
at his first coming into his Royal service (the most virtuous Lesson, that
ever Prince taught a Subject) to wit, that he should first look unto God, and
after God, unto his King: as in good faith (said he) I have ^ost sincerely
done, or else might your Grace account me a most ^nworthy servant.

To this the King replied; that if he could not therein with ^is conscience
serve him, he was well content to accept of his ^eruice otherwise, and use the
^duice of some others of his pri^y Counsel, whose conscien^es would agree well
enough ^herewith, nor would he neuer^helesse disco^tinue his gracious ^auour
toward him, nor trou^le his conscience any further with that matter, for the
time ^orward.

But Sir Thomas More per^eiued by little and little, that ^he King fully
determined to ^roceede in his Marriage with Queen Anne, when he, with the
Bishopps and Nobles of the Higher House of Parliament, were for the furtherance
of that matter, commanded by the King to go unto the Commons of the lower
House, and show unto them, what the Universities as well of other parts beyond
the seas, as of Oxford, and Cambridge had done in that behalf, testifiyng the
same with their seals and subscriptions. All which things (at the Kings
request, not showing of what mind he was therein himself) he opened to the
Lower House of Parliament.

Nevertheless doubting greatly, lest further inconveniences might follow, into
with (contrary to his conscience) by reason of his Office, he was likely to be
fall, he made humble suite to the Duke of Norforke (his singular dear friend)
to be a means unto the King, that he might, with his Graces favor, be
discharged from his Office of Chancellourship, in which for certain
infirmityes of his body, he pretended himself not able any longer to serve.

This good Duke of Norfolk coming on a time to Chelsey to dyne with Sir
Thomas More, found him in the Church, singing in the Quier, with a Sur^ on his
back: to whom (after Mass was done) as they went toward his house,
together arm in arm, the Duke said: Gods body, Gods body, my Lord
Chancellor, what turned ^arish Clarke? You dishonor the King and his Office
very much. Nay (quoth Sir Thomas More smyling upon the Duke) your Grace may not
think, that the King your Master and mine will be offended with me for serving
God his Master, or thereby account his Service any way dishonored.

Now, when the Duke (at the special entreaty and importunate suite of Sir
Thomas More) had obtained of the King, that he should be discharged of his
Chancellorship, at a conuenien^ time appointed by the King, he repaired unto
the Court, to yield up the great Seal, which his Majesty received of him with
praise, and thanks for hi^ good service done to his person and the Realm in
that Office. And he further said unto him in a gracious manner, that if in any
suite he should hereafter have unto him, that either concerned his Honor (for
that word it pleased the King to use unto him,) or appertayned to his profit,
he should ever find his Highness, a very good, and gracious Lord.

After he had thus resigned the Office, and Dignity of the Chancellorship, and
placed all his Gentlemen and Yomen with Bishops and Noble men, and his eight
Watermen with the Lord Audley (who succeeded him in his Office) to whom also he
gave his great Barge; he then called al his children unto him, and asked their
aduises how he might now in the decay of his ability, which by the surrender of
his Office was so impaired, that he could not, as he was wont, maintain them
to live al together, according to his desire; whereat when he saw them all
silent, and unwilling in that case to show their opinions unto him: Why then
will I (quoth he show unto you my poor mind.

I have been brought up, (said he) at Oxford, at an June of Ch^ncery, at
Lincolnes Inn, and also in the Kings Courts, and so forth, from the lowest
degree to the highest; and yet I have in yearly Revenues, left me at this
present, little above a hundred pounds by the year. So that now, we must
hereafter if we will live together, be content to become Contributours to each
other; but by my counsel it shall not be best for us, to fall to the lowest
fare first. We will not therefore descend to Oxford fare, nor the fare of New
^nne; but we will begin with Lincolnes Inn diet, where many right Worshipful
of good years do live full well; which if we find not our selves the first
year able to maintain, then will we the next year go one step down to
New-Inne fare, wherewith, many an honest man is well contented. Then, if that
exceed our abilityes, will we the next year after descend to Oxford fare,
where many grave, learned, and ancient Doctors be continually resident; which
if our powers be not able to maintain neither, then may we yet with bags and
wallets go a begging together, hoping that for pity some good people will
give us their Charity, at their door, to sing Salve Regina, and so still may
we keep company together, and be as merry as Beggars.

And whereas you have heard before, that he was by the King, taken from a very
good living, and advanced to his Majesty's service, wherein he spent with
paynfull cares and travels, as well beyond the Seas, as within the Kingdom, in
a manner the whole substance of his life: yet with all the gain that he got
thereby (being never wastfull spender) he was scarce able, after the
Resignation of his office of Chancellorship, for the maintaynance of himself,
and such (...) necessarily belonged unto ^im, sufficiently to find meat^
^rinke, apparel, and other such ^ecessaryes; all the land which (...) ever
purchased (which he ^id also, before he was Lord Chancellor) not amounting
(...) above the value of Twenty ^arkes a year. And after his ^ebts paid, he
had not (his Chain only excepted) in gold and silver, left him the worth of
(...) hundred pounds.

In the time of his Chancel^rship, upon the Sundays and ^oly days, when
Mass, or Eue^^nge were ended, one of his Gentlemen did usually go to his ^dyes
Pew in the Church, and (...) unto her: Madame, my Lord ^gone. The next Sunday
after the surrender of his Office, and departure of his Gentlemen, he went unto
his Ladies pew himself, and with his Cap in hand, he made her low Courtesy,
saying unto her; Madame My Lord is gone.

In the time, before his troubles, he would talk with hi^ Wife and Children of
the joys of heaven, and the pains of hel^ and of the lives of the Holy
Martyrs, of their grievous Martyrdomes, of their marvelous Patience, and of
their sufferings and deaths, and that they died mos^ willingly rather the^
they would offend God: also what a happy and blessed thing it was for the lou^
of God to suffer loss of goods imprisonment, loss of life, an^ lands.
Moreover he would f^r there say unto them, That upon his Faith, if he could but
perceive, that his wife and Children would encourage him to dye in a good
cause, it would be such a comfort unto him, that for very joy thereof he would
run merrily to his death. By this discourse, and other such like, he gave
them feeling what troubles might afterward chance to happen unto him, whereby
he had so far encouraged them before the time, that afterward when they
happened unto him indeed, they seemed a great deal the less.

Now after the Resignation of his Office, there came unto him to Chels^y, M.
Thomas Cromwell (then in the Kings his favor) with a message from his Majesty,
about which when they had fully co^ferred together privately; M. Cromwell
(quoth Sir Thomas More) you are now newly entered into the ^eruice of a mos^
Royals, Wise, and liberal Prince and if you follow my poor advise, you shall
in your Counsell^ giving, ever tell him what h^ ought to do, but never what h^
is able to do. So shall you show your self a true and faithful servant, and a
right worthy Cou^ sellour: for if a Lion knew hi^ own strength, it were hard
for any man to rule him.

Within a short time afte^ his, there was a Commission granted forth, and
directed (...) M. Cranmer (then Archbishop (...) Canterbury) to determyne the
matter of the Marriage between the King, and Queen Katharine, at S. Albans.
Where at last, it was fully determined, and concluded, according to the Kings
desire: and then began he to compain, that since he could have no Justice at
the Popes hands, he would therefore from thenceforth separate himself from the
Sea of Rome, and thereupon he presently married the Lady Anne Bullen.

Which, when Sir Tho. More understood, he said to M. Roper; God grant, God
grant. Son Roper, that these matters within a while, be not confirmed by
Oath.

About this time, Queen Anne was to pass through London from the Tower to
Westminster, to her Coronation, and some few days before, Sir Thomas More
received a letter fr^ the Bishops of Durham, Bath, and Winchester requesting
him, both to keep them company from the Tower to Westminster to the said
Coronation, and withal to accept of Twenty Pounds, which by the Bearer
thereof they had sent unto him to buy him a gown; which he thankfully
received, but yet went not, staying still at home until the Coronation was
past. At his next meeting with the said Bishops, he spoke merrily unto them,
saying; My Lords, by the letter which you sent lately unto me, you required of
me two things, one whereof since I was well contented to grant, therefore I
thought I might be the boulder to deny you the other: and also, because I took
you ^r no Beggars, and my self I ^ow to be no rich man, I ^ought I might the
rather ac^pt of your liberality with the ^ore honesty. But indeed your ^her
Request put me in mind (...) a certain Emperor (I have ^ow forgotten his
name) that ^ade a law, that whosoever co^^itted a certain offense (which do
not now neither remem^er,) should suffer death, by be^g devoured of wild
beasts, ex^ept it were a Virgin that of^ended against the same, such ^euerence
did he bear unto Vir^inity. Now, it so fell out, that ^he first who committed
the of^ence, was indeed a Virgin, ^her of the Emperor hearing, (...) (...)

ruption, by doing wrong, or taking bribes; it would without doubt in this so
troublesome a time, of the Kings displeasure against him, have been deeply
laid to his charge, thereby to have found any the least hole in his coat. But
he always kept himself so clear, even of suspicion of any such thing, that
no man was once able therewith to blemish him; although the same was shrewdly
many times attempted, specia^y in the case of one Parne^, against whom Sir
Thomas More whilst he was Lord Chancellor, in the suite of one Vaugham (
Parnels aduerary) had passed a sentence or decree, by way of Justice.

Whereupon Parnell made a most grievous complaynt unto the King, that Sir
Thomas More (...), for passing of the forsaid (...), taken from the said Vau^
unable for the Gowte to travel abroad himself) by the hands of his wife, a
fair great gilded cup for a bribe. Upon this a^ulation Sir Thomas More was by
the Kings appointment, called before the whole body of the Counsel, where this
matter (...) heynously laid to his charge. He forthwith confessed, that for
as much as that cup was long after the passing of a foresaid decree, brought
unto him for a new years gift, he at the Gentlewoma^s importune pressing it
upon him, of courtesy refused not to-receiue it.

Then the Earl of Wiltshire, Sir Thomas Bullen, Father to Queen Anne, a very
great enemy to Sir Thomas M^re, and chief complayner of this business against
him to the King, with much rejoicing said unto the Lords there present: Lo,
did I not tell you, my Lords, that you should find this matter true?

Whereupon when Sir Thomas More had stood silent a while, smyling upon the Lord
of W^shire, he at length earnestly desired their Lordships, that as they had
courteously heard him tell the one part of his Tale, so they would be pleased
to vouchsafe him the indifferent hearing of the other.

Then he further declared unto their Honors, That albert indeed, he had with
much entreaty received the cup, yet immediately thereupon he caused his Butler
to fill it with wine, and of that cup he drank unto her, and she pledged him.
Then as freely as her husband had given it unto him, even so, freely gave he
the same back again to her, to give unto her husband for his New-yeares gift,
which at his request (though much against her will) she received again; as
herself and diverse others there present, were deposed before them. So was this
great Mountain, was turned presently into Molehill.

So likewise at another time, upon a New years day, there come unto Sir Thomas
More one (...) Croker a rich widow, for whom with no small pains, he had
passed a Decree in the Chauncery, against the Lord Arundell, to present him
with a pair of gloves, and forty pou^ds in Angels within them for a New
years gift. Of whom he thankefully receiving the Gloves, but refusing the
money said unto her: Mistress, sin^ (...) were against good manners to refuse
a Gentlewomans Newyeares gift, I am content to take your Gloves, but for your
Money I utterly refuse it; and much against her mind, he restored her the Gold
back again.

Another time also one (...) Gresham having a cause ^ding before him in the
Ch^ncery, sent him for a New (...) gift a fair Gilded cup: The ^shon whereof
he very well ^king, caused one of his own cups (though not to his mind of so
good a fashon, yet much better in value) to be brought forth of his Chamber,
which he willed the Messenger in recompense to redeliuer unto his Mistress,
for with other condition he would in no wise receive it.

Now when the King plainly saw, that he could not by any means wyn Sir Thomas
More to his side, he went about by terror, and threats to enforce him
thereunto; the beginning whereof, was occasioned, in this manner. There was a
certayn^. Nun dwelling in Canterbury, commonly called The holy Maid (...)
(...), who for the exterior show of her Virtue, and Holin^e, grew into great
esteem amongst the common People first, and then amongst others and for that
cause many Religious persons, many Doctors of Divinity, and diverse others of
very great account of the Layty used to resort unto her. This holy woman
affirmed, to have had a Revelation from heaven, to give the King warning of his
wicked life, and of the abuse of the Sword and Authority committed unto him by
God; and understanding, the Bishop of Rochester, Doctor Fisher, to be a man of
notable virtuous life and great learning, she repaired to Rochester, and there
disclosed to him her said Revelation, desiring his advice and counsel therein;
which the Bishop well perceiving might stand with the laws of God, and holy
Chu^h, ^uised her (as she before inten^ed, and had warning to do to (...) unto
the King herself, and ^are unto him, all the cir^stances thereof. Whereupon
(...) w^nt, and told unto his Man her said Revelation, and so (...) home to
Cant^rbury.

Within a short time after, this (...) (...) ^oly Nun, made a ^orney to the
Monastery of Sion (...) upon the Thames, a little (...) (...), and by means of
(...) M. R^old, a Father of the ^ame house, (...) the Religious ^erof. At which
time it hap^ Sir Thomas More to be at (...) visiting some of his aquain^ance
there, and talking with the ^nne about some of her Re^lations, especially that
which did concern the Kings Supremacy and Marriage: which he said) he might
freely and safely do, without any danger of the law, by reason the same was
then neither established by Statute, nor confirmed by Oath, as he himself had
long before prognosticated, nevertheless in all the discourse, and passages of
speech which he had with the said Nun (as it after ward appeared) he had
carried himself so discreetly, that he rather deserved co^mendatio^s, the^
blame.

At the Parliament following, there was a bill put up for the attaynting of the
forsaid Nun of Cant^ury, and of some other Monastical persons, of High
Treason: as also Bishop Fish^ of (...), S^r Thomas More and diverse others, of
(...) of Treason. With which the King veri^y thought Sir Thomas More would be
so terrified, that it would enforce him to relent, and co^descend to his
purpose; wherein as it seemed, his Grace was much mistaken.

To this Bill, Sir Thomas More was s^ter to be received person^ly to make
answer for him^ in his own defense. But the King not liking that, assign^d
the Bishop of Canterbury, (...) Lord Cha^cellour, the Duke of No: folk, and M.
Cromwell at a day, and place appointed, to (...) Sir Thomas More before them.
At which time M. Roper thinking his Father had now fit opportunity, advised him
to labor th^se Lords for the help of his discha^ge, forth of the Parliament
Bill, who answered M. Roper, that he would

At his coming before the Lords, according to their appointment, they
interta^ned him very ^iendly, and willed him to (...) down with them, which in
no wise he would (...) began the Lord Chancellor to declare unto him, how many
ways the ^ing had shewe^ his love and favor toward him; how gladly he would
have had him continue in his Office; and how willing he would have been to have
heaped more Benefits upon him; how he could ask no worldly Honor, or Profit
at the Kings hands, that was likely to be ^enyed him; hoping by this
declaration of the Kin^ favors toward him, to (...) ^im to favor his Highness
bu^ of the marriage. And lastly he requested his consent unto no more, but what
the Parliament, the Bishops, and (...) had already admitted, and (...).

To this Sir T^omas M^re (...) ma^e answer, s^ying; There is no man liu^ng, my
Lords that would with better will, do the thing that might be a^table to the
Kings Highness then my self, who nee^es must confess his manifold goo^nesse,
and bountiful benefits, m^st (...) bestowed upon me: Howbeit I verily thought,
that I should never have heard more of this matter, considering, that from time
to time, even from the first beginning here of I have declare^ my mind plainly
and truly to his (...) which his ^ighnes eue^ (...) to me, like a most graciou^
(...), very well to a^ept, ^uer mynding as he said) to (...) me further
therewith. ^nce (...) time I could neu^r (...) further matter, that was (...)
to move me to any other (...); which if I could, there is not a man in all the
word that would have b^ne more glad th^of, then my self.

Many things more, of like sort, were here uttered on both sides: and in the
end when they saw they could not by any manner of persuasion, remove him from
his former determination; then they began to touch him more ne^rely, telling
him, that ^he Kings Majesty had given them in commandemet, (...) they (...) by
no gentle mean^s wyn (...), to charge him in his Name with great ^gratitude,
and that ^here was never found servant ^o his Sovereign so vngrate^, nor
subie^t to his Prince so (...) as he: for that by his (...) and sinister (...)
he had most unnaturally urged, and procu^ed his (...) to set forth ^a Book, Of
the Asertion of the (...) (...), and mayn^nance of the Popes Authori^ and
thereby caused him, to (...) great dishonor throughout (...), to put a sword
into the Pop^s hands, to fight against himself.

Now when they had thus laid (...) these, and all other such like terrors and
(...) which they cold imagine ag^ynst him; My Lords quoth he these be but
Bugbeares, only to (...) Children, and not me B^t to answer that, wherewith
you do (...) accuse me, I (...) (...) that the Kings (...), out of his Honor,
will ^euer lay any (...) (...) to my ch^rge; for th^e is no man in the world,
that can in that (...), s^y (...) in my excuse, th^n his (...) himself who
knows right well, that (...) uer was his procurer, or Counselor thereunto,
but after it was fi^ished by his H^hnes appointment, and consent of the makers
thereof, I only was made use of, as a setter out, or a placer of some principal
matters therein contained; wherein, when I found the Popes Authority so highly
advanced, and with so strong Arguments mightily defended, I said unto his
Grace: I must put your Highness in remembrance of one thing, and that is this,
The Pope as your Highness well knows is a Prince as you are, and in leag^e
with all other Christian P^nces, it may hereafter so fall o^t, that your
Highness and he may vary upon some points of league, whereupon may grow br^ch of
amity yea and wars betwixt you; I think it therefore best that, that place be
amended, and his Authority more advisedly touched. Nay quoth the King) that
shall it not, for we are so much bound to the S^a of Rom^, that we cannot do to
much honor thereunto The^ did I further put his Mai^sty in remembrance of the
Statute of (...), whereby a great p^t of the Popes Provisions, were pared away.
To that his Majesty answered, that whatsoever impediment were to the contrary,
yet should his Authority be set forth to the v^ermost: for (q^oth he, we
received from that Sea, this our Crown Imperial; of which thing until his
Grace told me with his own mouth I never heard before. So that I trust when his
Majesty sha^be once truly informed of this, and call to remem^rance my pla^ne
an^ honest d^ling therein, (...) (...) will never speak of it (...), but
^ather quite (...) me thereof himself. Thus ^ded the Assembly for that time,
and the Lords soin what displeasantly departed.

Then took Sy^ Thom^s More h^s boat hom wards to his house (...) (...),
together with M. Ro^, and bv the way was very ^easant. Which M. R^per see^,
was very glad thereof, ho^ that he had gotten himself (...) (...) (...): of the

(...) very (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...) (...), (...) (...): I trust

(qu^th he, I (...) our Lord God Are you then put out of the Parl^ent bill Sir
(quoth M. Roper?) By my troth son R^per (quoth he, I never rem^mbred it.
Never remembered it, Sir, (quoth M. R^per) a matter that touch^th your self so
near, and all us for your sake. Truly Sir, I am very sorry to hear it, for I
v^ly hoped, when I saw you so merry, that all had been well. Well, well Son
Roper (quoth he) will thou know why I was so merry indeed? That would I gladly
Sir, said M. Roper. In good Faith, Son Roper, I reioyce^ that I had given the
Devil a (...) fall, and that with these Lords, I had gone so far, as
without great shame I could not go back again. At wh^h wo^des M Rop^r waxed
sad, and then they went both in.

Now, upon the report made by the Lord Chancellor, and the other Lords, to the
King of their former discourse, and proce^dings with Sir Thomas More, the King
was so highly offended with him, that he plainly told them, he was fully
purposed that the aforesaid ParlamentB^ll should proceed forth against him. To
whom the Lord Cha^cellour, and the rest of the Lords said, they perceived the
upper House so precisely bent to hear him spoke for himself and to make
answer in his own defense that if he were not put out of the bill, it would
without fail be rejected of all. But for all this, the King would needs have
his own will therein, or else (quoth he) at the passing thereof, I will my
self be personally present. Then did (...) Lord Chancellor, and the rest
(seeing him so vehemently ben^ therein) upon their knees, beseech his Grace in
most humble wise, to for bear the same considering, that if he should (...)
his own presence receive (...) overthrow, it would not only encourage his
Subjects ever (...): to contemn him; but (...) throughout all Christendom
redound to his great dishonor Adding thereunto, that they doubted not in time,
to find some other matter against him which might serve his Majesty purpose
far better; for in the former business, especially tha^ of the Nun, he is
accounted (quoth they) so innocent and clear, that he is judged of most m^n,
rather worthy of praise, then reprehension. Whereupon at length, through their
earnest persuasions the King was contented to yield himself to their counsel.

On the Morrow after, M. Cromwell meeting with M. Ro^ in the Parliament house,
willed him to tell his Father, that he was put out of the Parliament Bill; which
news M. Roper sent home immediately to his wife, willing her to make the same
known to her Father. Whereof when he heard: In good faith Megge (quoth he)
Quod differtur, non aufertur. After this it happened that the Duke of Norfolk
and Sir Tho. More met together, and falling into familiar talk, the Duke said
unto him: By the Mass M. More, it is perilous striving with Princes, and
therefore I would wish you somewhat to inclyne to the Kings pleasure: For by
Gods body, M. More, Indignatio Pri^cipis Mors est. Is that all my Lord (quoth
he?) Then in good Faith, there is no more difference between your Grace and
me, but that I may dye to day, and you to morrow.

In this Parliament was a statute made for the Oath of Supremacy, and lawfulnes
of the Kings Marriage; and within a while after all the Priests of London, and
Westminster, and with them Sir Thomas More only, and no lay man besides, were
cited to appear at Lambeth, before the Bishop of Canterbury, the Lord
Chancellor, and Secretary Cromwell, Commissioners, appointed there to tender
the Oath unto them.

Upon this strange citation Sir Tho. More, as his accustomed manner ever was,
always before he entered into any business of importance (as when he was first
chosen of the Kings privy Counsel, when he was sent Ambassador, appointed
Speaker of the Parlament-House, created Lord Chancellor, or when he took any
weighty matter upon him) prepared himself to Confession, heard Mass, and was
housled, in the Morning, the self same day that he was to appear^ before the
Lords at Lambeth.

And as he used often at other times of his departure from hi^ wife and
Children (whom he tenterly loved) to have them bring him to his boat, and
there to kiss them all, and bid them farewell; at this time he would not suffer
any of them to follow him further then his gate, where with a heavy heart (as by
his countenance appeared) he took his leave of them, and with M. Rop^r and
four servants entered into his boat, toward Lambeth: wherein sitting still
sadly for a while, at last he rounded M. Roper in the ear, and said: Son
Roper, I thank our Lord God, the field is wo^ne. What he meant by that, they
did not well understand, yet loath to seem ignorant, M. Roper said; Sir, I am
very glad thereof. And as they after co^iectured, it was for that the love he
had to God, wrought in him so effectually, that it utterly conquered all his
^arnall affections.

At his coming to Lambet^, he behaved himself so discreetly before the
Commissioners, at the ministration of the forsaid Oath, (as may be seen at
large in certain Letters of his sent to M.rs Roper, extant in a printed volume
of his works) as they had little, or nothing to lay unto his charge; yet durst
they not, as it seemed, dismiss him, but committed him to the cu^tody of the
Abbot of Westminster for 4. or 5. days; during with time the King consulted
with his Counsel, what order were best to be taken with him. and albeit in the
beginning, it was resolved that he should upon his oath be discharged; yet did
Queen Anne, through her importunate clamours, so far prevail with the King
against him, that contrary to the Commissioners expectation, he was committed
to the Tower.

Now, as he was conducted thitherward by water, wearing (as he commonly did) a
chain of gold about his N^cke, M. ^chard Cr^mwell, who had the charge of
conueying him to prison, advised him to send home his Chain to his wife, or to
some of his Children. Nay (quoth he) that will I not, for if I were taken in
the field by mine enemy, I would he should fare somewhat the better for me. At
his landing at the Tower gate, M. Lieutenant was ready there to receive him,
where the Gentleman Porter demanded of him his upper garment Why here it is
(quoth he) and presently took o^f his Cap, and delivered it unto him, saying;
I am very sorry M. Porter, that it is no better for you. Nay (quoth the Porter)
I must have your Gown Sir. OI cry you mercy, good M. Porter, for now indeed I
remember, that my Cappe is not my upper garment, but only the thatch of my
poor old Tenement.

So then was he by M. Lieutenant conveyed to his Lodging, where he called unto
him one John Wood his own servant, appointed there to attend him, who could
neither write nor read, and swore him before the Lieutenant, that if he should
hear or see at any time, his Master write, or speak any manner of thing
against the King, Council, or State of the land, he should reveal it to the
Lieutena^t, that the Lieutena^t might make the same known to the Counsel.

After he had remained in the Tower about a month, his daughter Roper (having
greatly desired to see her Father) made earnest suite, and got leave to visit
him: at whose coming after the saying of the seven Psalms and Letanyes,
which he was ever accustomed to say with her) before they fell into discourse
of any other matter, among other speeches he said unto her: I believe Megge,
that they who have put me here, think they have done me a great displeasure:
But I assure thee on my faith (mine own good daughter) if it had not ben for
my wife and you my Children, whom I account the chief part of my charge, I
would not have failed long ere now, to have enclosed my self in a straiter
room then this. But since I am come hither, without mine own desert, I trust
that God of his goodness will disburden me of my care, and with his gracious
help supply my want amongst you. And I find no cause (I thank God Megge) to
reckon my self in worse case here, then in mine own house. For me thinks in
this case, God makes me even a wanton, setting me upon his knee, and dandling
me.

Thus by his patient suffering, and cheerful demeanor in all his tribulations
and disasters, it plainly appeared, that nothing seemed painful unto him, but
rather a profitable Exercise, for the good of his soul. Then when he had
questioned a while with his daughter about his wife Children, and household
state in his absence, he asked her how Queen Anne did? Never better Father
(quoth she.) Never better Megge (quoth he:) Alas, alas, it pittieth me to
remember into what misery (poor Soul) she will shortly come.

After this, M. Lieutenant coming one to day his chamber to visit him, and
recou^ting the many courtesies, and benefits that he had heertofore received at
his hands, and therefore how much the more bound he was to ent^ertayne him
friendly, and make him good chere, which, the case standing as it did, he could
not (as he would) do, without the Kings high displeasure, and therefore hoped he
would accept of his good will and of such poor cheer as he had. Ma^ster
Lieu^nant (quoth Sir Thomas More) now verily I believe, all you have said to be
true, for which I do most heartily thank you. And assure your self, M
Lieutenant, when you see me mislike my cheer, then thrust me out of your
doors, as a very unthankful Guest.

Now whereas the Oath above mentioned made to confi^me the K. Supremacy and
marriage, was comprised in very few wo^des, the Lord Chaunc^llour and Secretary
Cromw^ (...) of (...) own heads, add more wo^s unto it, to make it appea^e of
more force, and to (...) better in the Kings ear: which Oath so amplified,
they had caused to be ministered to Sy^ T^mas More, and to al others throghout
the Kingdom. The which Sir Thomas More perceiving said one day to his daughter
Roper: I may tell thee M^gge, they that committed me hither for refusing the
Oath, not agreeable to the Statute, are not by their own law able to justify my
imprisoment. And surely Daughter, it is great pi^y, that any Christian Prince
should, by so flexible a Counsel ready to follow his affe^tions, and by so
weak a Clergy wanting grace to stand constantly to their Religion, with
^attery be so gros^ely abused. But at length the Lord Chancellor, and M.
Secretary espying their own oversight in that behalf, were glad afterward to
sind a means that another Sta^ should be made for the con^mation of the said
Oath so amplifyed, with their additions.

And whereas Sir Thomas More had made a conueyance for the disposing of his
lands, reserving only unto himself, an estate for term of life, and after
his descease some part thereof to his wife and children, and other some to his
Son Ropers wife, for a ioynture, in consideration she was an (...) in (...)
of more then a hundred (...) by the year: And like^se other some to M. (...)
and (...) (...) in recompense of then (...) money, with diuer^ (...) (...) over
and besides: All which co^ueyances and as^urances, being made and finished
long before any matter (whereof he was attaynted) could be made an offense: yet
by Statute were they now all clearly auovded, and all the lan^s that he had in
such sort assured upon his wife and children by the said (...) (contrary to
order of the laws) taken from them, and forfayt^d into the Kings hands,
except only that po^tion which he had (...) (...) (...). (...) and his wife, by
reason that after the (...) conueya^ce, which was (...) to ^selfe for the term
of his life, he had, upon further consideration, w^thin two ^ayes af^r, by
another conu yance given the same immediately to M. (...) and his w^e, in
present posse^on. So as the Sta^ had only avoided the first c^nueyance, for
fa^ting no more unto the King the^ had been passed ther^n and the second
conneyance passed to M. (...) and his wife (being dated two da^es after)
falling without the compass of the law, was ad^dged good, and valide.

Sir Thomas More being now prisoner in the Tower, and one day looking f^th at
his window, saw a Father of Syon (named M. R^ynolds) and three monks of the
Ch^rter house, going out of the Tower to ex^cution, for that they had refused
the Oath of Suprema^: wherupo, he langui^hing it were with desire to bear them
comp^ny say^ unto his da^ghter (...) then pre^nt: Loo^e (...), (...) thou not
see that these blessed Fathers be now going as cherefully to their deaths, as
B^degromes to their marriages? By which thou m^yst see (mine own d^re
daughter) what a great differen^e there is between such as have spent all their
days in a religious, h^rd, and penitential life, and such as have, in this
world, like wretches (as thy poor Father here has done) consume all their
time in pleasure and ease For which God, o^t of his gracious Goo^nes w^l (...)
(...) them to remay^e (...) in this vale of misery and (...), but will speed^y
(...) them hece into the (...) of his ever lasting D^ty W^ras any si^ly Father,
(...), who (...) a most wicke^ (...) has (...) the whole course of his
^serable life most (...) God t^king him not worthy to (...) so ^oone thereunto,
l^ueth here him (...) the world, to be furth^r tried, plunge^, and and
turmoyled in misery.

Within a why^e after, M. Secretary came to him from the King, and pretending
much friendship toward him said, that the Kings Highness was his good and
gracious Lord, not mynding any matter thence forward, wherein he should have
cause of scruple to trouble his cons^ience. As soon as (...). (...) was
departed to express what comfo^t the (...) of his speeches, he took a coal
(for pen and ink t^en he had none) and wrote the^e lines following.

(...), (...), look (...) (...) (...),

Nor (...) (...) pleasantly, begin to (...),

As (...) thou would my ruins all (...);

During my life thou shall not me (...).

Tru^t I shall, God, to enter in a while Thy (...) of Heavens, sure and
uniform.

Eu^r after a calm, look I for a sterme.

Now Sir Thomas More, had continued almost six weeks in the Tower, before the
Lady his wife could obtain license to visit him. Who at her first coming to
him (like a good simple worldly woman) bluntly saluted him in this manner: What
a good-care M. More, I merua^le that you, who have been always hitherto taken
for so wise a man, will now so play the fool to ly here in this close filthy
prison, and be content to be thus shut up amongst mice and rats, when you might
be abroad at your liberty, with the favor and good will both of the King and
his Counsel, if you would bu^ do as all the Bishops, and best lea^ned of the
Realm have done? And since you have at Chelsey a right fair house, your
Library, your Books, your Garden, your Orchard, and all other necessaryes
ha^dsome about you where also you might, in the company of me your wife,
Children and household be merry; (...) muse what a Gods Name you mean thus
fo^dly to tarry here?

After he had a while quietly heard her, with a cheerful countenance he said
unto her. I pray thee good (...) Alice tell me one thing. What is that, quoth
she? Is not this house as near Heaven as mine own? whereto after her
accustomed homely fashion not liking such spea^hes she answered: Tille-valle,
^valle. How say you (...). (...), is it not so (quoth he?) (...) Deus, bone
(...), man, will your old Tricks never be left (quoth she again?) Well then
M.rs Alice, said he, if it be so, it is very well; for I see no great cause,
why I should joy much either in my gay house, or in any thing belonging
thereunto, when as if I should but live seven years under ground, and then
rise again and come thither, I should not fail to find some dwelling therein,
that would bid me get out of doors, and tell me it were (...) (...) mine. What
cause then have I to love such a house, as would so soon^ forget his old
Master? So as her persuasions moved him nothing at all.

Not long after this there came unto him, the Lord Chancellor, the Dukes of
Norfolk, and Su^folke, with Master Secretary, and diverse of the privy
Counsel, at two sever all times, wh^ used all possible policy to procure him
either precisely to co^^fesse the Supremacy, or directly to deny it. Whereunto
((...) appears by the book of hi^ Examinations) they could ne uer bring him,
or justly tax him for the contrary.

Shortly hereupon, one M (...) (created after wards Lord Rich) that then was
newly mad^ the Kings So^citour, Sir Richard Southwell, and one M. Pa^mer
servant to the Secretary; were sent unto Sir Thomas More under color of
fetching hi^ Books away from him. An^ whilst Sir Richard Southwell, an^ M.
Palmer were busy in p^king them up, M. Rich pretending frie^dly discourse with
him, amongst other things (of set purpose as it seemed) said thus unto him: For
as much as it is well known M. More, that you are a man both wise, and well
learned, as well in the laws of the Realm, as otherwise, I pray you therefore,
let me in courtesy, and good will be so bold to put you this case. Admit there
were Sir (quoth he) an Act of Parliament, that all the Kingdom should take me
for King, would not you then M. More, take me for King? Yes marry, (quoth Sir
Thomas More) that would I Then I put case further (quoth M. Rich: Admit there
were an Act of Parliament, that all the Realm should take me for Pope, would
not you the^ M. More take me for Pope? For answer (quoth Sir Thomas More) to
your first case, the Parliament may well (M. Rich) meddle with the state of
temporal Princes; but to make answer to your later case: Suppose the Parliament
would make a law, that God should not be God: would you M. Rich, then say, that
God were not God? No Sir (quoth he) that would I not. No more (quoth Sir Thomas
More) as M. Rich after reported of him, could the Parliament make the King
supreme head of the Church. And so M. Rich, with the rest departed.

Now upon the only report of this speech Sir Thomas More was indicted of
Treason, upon the Statute, whereby it was made Treason to deny the King to be
supreme head of the Church: into which Indictment, were put these heinous
words, (...), Traitrously, and (...). Whereupon presently after he was brought
from the Tower (...) answer the Indictment at the Kings Bench bar; and being
there arraigned before the Judges, he openly told the^; That he could be
content to have abidden the rigor of the law by this their indictment, but
then he should thereby be driven to confess falsely of himself the matter
indeed, which was the deny all of the Kings Supremacy, and which he protested
was most untrue. Wherefore he pleaded there to not guilty, and so reserved unto
himself advantage to be taken of the body of the matter, after verdict, to
avoid that Indictment. And moreover he added; That if these only odious terms
Maliciously, Traitorously, and Diabolically were left out of the Indictment, he
saw nothing therein, wherewith justly to charge him.

Then for proof alleged unto the Jury, that Sir Thomas More was guilty of
this Treason, M. Rich was called forth, to give evidence upon his Oath, as he
did against him. To whom, having thus sworn, Sir Thomas More spoke in this
wise: If this Oath of yours be true M. Rich, then I pray God, that I may never
see him in the face in his Kingdom; which I would not say, were it otherwise,
to gain the whole world. Then recounted he to the Court, the whole discourse,
of all their Conferrence, and putting of Cases in the Tower, according to the
Truth. And turning to M. Rich he said: In good faith M. Rich, I am more sorry
for your Perjury then for mine own peril. And besides, you shall understand,
that neither I, nor any man else to my knowledge, ever took you to be a man of
such credit, as to communicate unto you any matter of importance; and (you well
know) I have been acquainted with you no small while, and have known you, and
your Conversation from your very youth; for we dwelled long together in one
Parish, where, as your self can tell best, (I am sorry you compel me so to
say) you were esteemed very light of your tongue, a great Dicer, and of no
commendable Fame, or Name: Can it therefore seem likely to your Lordships,
that I would in so weighty a matter, so unadvisedly ouershoote my self, as to
trust M. Rich (a man reputed always by me, and others for one of little truth,
as your Lordships have (...), so far, above my Sovereign the King, or above
any of his noble Counselors, that I would utter unto him the secrets of my
Conscience, touching the Kings Supremacy? The special point and only mark so
long aimed at in all my actions? The thing which I never did, or ever would
offer to the Kings Majesty himself; or to any of his Honorable Counsel, as
it is not unknown unto your Honors, who sundry times have been sent unto me,
into the Tower from his Highness own person, for no other purpose. Can this in
your Judgments, my Lords, seem to stand with truth, in any likely hood? And
yet if I had so said indeed (my Lords) as M. Rich has falsely sworn, since it
was spoken, as he says, in familiar talk, affirming nothing, and only in
putting of cases, without other displeasant circumstances, it cannot justly be
taken to be spoken Maliciously, and where there is no Malice, there can be no
Offense.

And besides this (my Lords,) I can never think, (...) (...) many worthy
Bishops, so (...) honorable Personages; and (...) many other worshipful;
(...) (...) and well learned men, as were assembled at the making of that Law
in the Parliament, ever meant to have any man punished by death, in whom there
could be found no Malice: for if Malice be taken for Sin generally, then is
there no man that can excuse himself thereof: Si (...), quod peccatum non
habemus etc. And as for the term Maliciously, it is not in this Statute to be
taken for Material; as in like case you know the term Forcible, is meant in
Forcible Entry; by which Statute if a man enter patiently, and put not his
Adversary our forcibly, it is no offense: but if he put him out forcibly, by
that Statute it is an Offense, and so shall be punished by this Term forcible.

Moreover (my Lords) the manifold goodness of the Kings Highness himself, who
has been so many ways my singular good Lord, etc gracious soueraygne, who has
always so deerly affected me, and even at my first coming unto his Royal
service, adua^ced me to the dignity of his Honorable privy (...), vouchsasing
to admit me afterward to (...) of great (...) and Honor, and lastly to (...)
me to that weighty room of his Maiestyes high Chancellor, (the like whereof
he never did to any temporal man his subject before) next to his own Royal
person the highest Office in this noble kingdom, so far above my merit or
desert, and this for the space of above twenty years together, showing his
continual favor toward me, until at mine own poor suite (giving me his
gracious license to bestow the little residue of my life, in the service of God,
for the good of my soul) it pleased his Highness of his especial goodness, to
discharge and disburden me thereof: now all this his highness favor (Isay) thus
bou^tifully extended, and so long continued toward m^ considered, as it
ought, in my mind is sufficient to convince this slanderous surmise of M.
Rich, so wrongfully sworn against me.

When Sir Thomas More had thus spoken, M. Rich seeing himself so disproued, and
his credit so foully disgraced, caused Sir Richard Southwell, and M. Palmer (who
were also present at the time of their Conference in his Chamber) to be sworn,
what words had passed betwixt the^. Whereupon M. Palmer upon his deposition
said; That he was so busy, in putting up Sir Thomas Mores Books into a sack,
that he took no heed of their speeches. Sir Richard Southwell likewise upon
his deposition said; That because he was only appointed to look unto the
conueya^ce of his Books, he gave no great ear unto what they said.

After this, many other reasons and arguments were alleged by Sir Thomas
More, in defense of his own Innocence, and to the discredit of M. Rich, in the
forsaid point; Notwithstanding all which, the Jury found him guilty, and
immediately upon their verdict, the Lord Chancellor (for that business there
chief commissioner) beginning to proceed to Judgment against him, Sir Tho.
More said unto him.

My Lord, when I my self was toward the Law, the manner in such cases was,
to ask the Prisoner before sentence of Co^demnatio^, why Judgment should not
be given against him? Whereupon the Lord Cha^cellour staying the sentence
(wherein he had partly begun to proceed) demanded of him, What he was able to
say for himself, to the contrary? Then Sir Tho. More, in this sort, most
humbly made answer.

For as much as, my Lords, (quoth he) this Judgment is grounded upon an Act of
Parliament directly repugnant to the laws of God and his holy Church the
supreme government of which, or any part thereof, no ^emporall Prince may
presume by a^y temporal law, to take upon him, as rightfully belongin^ to the
Sea of R^me; a spirttuall preheminenc^ conferred, and granted, by the mouth of
ou^ savior himself, being personally present upon the Earth, only unto S.
Peter the Apostle, and his lawful Successors, Bishops of the same Sea, by
special prerogative; It is not therefore (...) enough for one Christian
Catholic man to charge, and convince another Christian Catholic man, and say,
that this Realm of England (being but a member, and a small part only of the
Church of Christ) has power and authority to make a particular law,
disagreable to the general law of Christ's Universal Catholic Church; no
more then the City of London, being but one poor member in respect of the
whole Kingdom, might make a law agay^st an Act of Parliament, to b^nd the whole
Realm. And further he showed, that it was contrary both to the ancient Laws,
and Statutes of our own Realm not the^ repealled, as they might well see in
Magna Carta; Quod (...) libera sit, and habeat omnia iura integ^ra, and
libertates suas (...); and contrary likewise to that sacred Oath, which the
Kings Highness himself, and en^ry other Christian Prince of this realm with
great Solemnity, has ever taken at their Coronation. Alleging moreover, that
no more might this Realm of England refuse obedience to the Sea of R^me, then
the child might refuse Obedience to his natural Father: for as S. Paul says
of the (...), I have regenerated you my Children in Christ; so might holy S.
Gregory Pope of Rome, of whom (by S. Augustine his messenger) we Englishmen
first received the Christian faith, truly say, You are my Children, be^caus^ I
have given you everlasting salvation (a far, and better, and more noble
Inheritance, then any carnal Father can leave to his Children) and by
regeneration made you my Children in Christ.

To this speech of Sir Thomas More the Lord Chancellor answered; That seeing
all the Bishops, Universities, and best learned of the Realm, had to this Act
of Parliament agreed, it was very greatly to be admired, that he alone, against
them all, would so stiffly stick, and argue so vehemently against it.

To this Sir Thomas More a gain replied, saying: If the number of Bishops and
Universities be so material, as your Lordship seems to take it; then I see
little cause, my Lord, why that thing should make any change at all in my
Conscience. For I nothing doubt (though not in this Realm yet in Ch^istendome
round about, the number of learned men and Bishops to be far greater, who
will defend and maintain the contrary; and therefore am I not bounden to
conform my conscience to the Council of one Kingdom, against the general
Counsel of Christendom.

Now, when Sir Thomas More for the avoiding of the Indictment had taken as many
exceptions as he thought fit, the Lord Chancellor loath to have the burden of
that Judgment wholly to depend upon ^fe there openly asked the advice of the
Lord Fitz-Iames (then Lord chief Justice of the Kings B^nch and joined in
commission with him) whether this In^ were (...) or no. Who, like a (...) man,
answered: My Lords (quoth he) by S. (...) (that was ever his oath, I must
needs confess, that if the Act of Parliament be not unlawful, then is not the
Indictment in my conscience insufficient. Whereupon the Lord Chancellor said
to the rest of the Commissioners; Lo my Lords, you all hear what my Lord
chief Justice says, and so immediately he gave Judgment. Which being done the
commissoners, yet further offered him courteously, all favorable audience, if
he would speak: who answered; I have no more to say my Lords, but that like as
the Blessed Apostle S. Paul (as we read in the Acts of the Apostles was
present, and consente^ to the death of S. Stephen, and kept their clothes that
stoned him to death, and are now both ho^y Saints in heaven; so I verily
trust, and shall right heartily pray, that though your Lordships have now here
in earth been Judges to my Condemnation, yet may we hereafter meet all
together in everlasting glory.

After his condemnation he departed from the Bar toward the Tower again,
led by Sir William Kingston a tall strong and comely knight) Constable of the
Tower, and his very dear fri^d, who when he had brought him a part of the way
toward the Tower, with a heavy heart, the tears running down his cheeks,
bad him farewell. The which Sir Thomas More seeing, comforted him with as good
words as he could, saying: Good M Kingston, trouble not your self, but be of
good cheer, for I will pray for you, and my good Lady your wife that we may
meet together in Heaven, where we shall be merry for ever and ever. And a
little after Sir William Kingstone meeting with M. Roper said: In good faith M.
Roper, I was ashamed of my self that at my departure from your Father, I found
my self so feeble, and he so strong, that he was feign to comfort me, who
should rather have comforted him.

As Sir The More came near unto the Tower, his Daughter Roper desirous to see
her Father once more before his death, and to receive his last blessing, gave
attendance about the Towerwharfe, where he was to pass, and so soon as she
saw him, hastening unto him, without respect or care of herself, pressed in
among the throng of the Guard, that with halbards went round about him, and
there openly in the sight of all asking him blessing on her knees embraced him,
took him about the neck, and kissed him. Who with a merry countenance,
nothing at all dejected, gave her his Fatherly blessing, with many Godly words
of comfort, and the^ departed.

So remained he in the Tower more then eight days after his condemnation, from
whence, the day before he suffered, he sent his shirt of hair (not willing to
have it seen) to his said Daughter Roper, and a Letter written with a cole
(printed in the aforesaid book of his works) expressing plainly the fervent
desire he had to suffer on the Morrow, in these words following: I comber you,
good Margaret very much, but I would be sorry if it should be any long, then to
Morrow; for to Morrow is S. Thomas of Canterbury his Eve, and the Octaue of S.
Peter, and therefore to Morrow long I to go to God; it were a day very meet,
and convenient for me. I never liked you manner better toward me then when
you last embraced me, and when daughterly love, and dear charity, have no
leisure to look toward worldly courtesy.

Upon the next Morrow, according as he wished, early in the morning there came
unto him Sir Thomas Pope, his singular good friend, with a message from the
King and Counsel, that he must before nine of the clock, the same morning,
suffer death, and that he should forth with prepare himself thereto. M. Pope
(quoth he) for your good tidings, I most heartily thank you. I have always ben
much bound to the Kings highness, for the many benefits, and honors that he
has still from time to time most bountifully heaped upon me; especially that
it has pleased his Majesty, to put me here in this place, where I have had
convenient time and leisure to remember my last End; and now most of all am I
bound unto his Grace, that I shall be so shortly rid out of the miseries of
this wretched life, and therefore will I not fail to pray earnestly for his
Grace, both here and in the other world also.

The Kings pleasure is further (quoth Sir Thomas Pope) that at your execution
you shall not use many words. M. Pope (quoth he) you do well to give me warning
of the Kings pleasure, for otherwise I might have offended his Majesty against
my will. I had indeed purposed at that time, to have spoken somewhat, but of no
matter of offec^ to his Grace; nevertheless whatsoever I intended, I am ready to
conform my self obediently to his commandment. And beseech you, good M.
Pope, be a means unto his Majesty that my daughter Margaret may be at my
Burial. The King is contented already (quoth Sir Thomas Pope) that your wife,
children, and other of your Friends have liberty to be present thereat. O how
much am I bound unto his grace quoth Sir Thomas More) that vouchsafes to have
so gracious a consideration of my poor Burial. Whereupon Sir Tho. Pope taking
his leave cold not forbear weeping: which Sir Tho. More perc^yuing, comforted
him in this wise. Q net your self good M. Pope, and be not discomforted, for I
trust we shall one day ^e each other in heaven, where we shall be sure to live,
and love together in joyful bliss eternally.

Upon Sir Thomas Popes departure, he changed himself into his best apparel, as
one that had bin invited to some solemn feast, which M. Lieutenant seeing,
advised him to put it off, saying, that he that was to have it, was but a
Iauell. What M. Lieutenat (quoth ^he) shall I account him a Iauell that shall
do me this day so singular a benefit? Nay I assure you were it cloth of Gold, I
would account it very well bestowed upon him, as S. Cyprian did, who gave to
his Executioner, thirty pieces of Gold. Yet through the Lieutenants persuasions
he altered his Apparel, and after the Example of the foresaid holy Martyr, he
gave that little money he had left, to his Executioner, which was one Angel of
Gold.

Then was he by M. Lieuetena^t brought out of the Tower, and from thence led
toward the place of Execution, upon the Towerhil, where going up the Scaffold
which was weak, and ready to fall, he said smilingly to M. Lieutena^t: I pray
you, good M. Lieutena^t see me safe up, and for my coming down let me shift
for my self. Then desired he all the people about him to pray for him, and to
bear witness, that he should now there suffer death in and for the faith of
the Holy Catholic Church. Which done he kneeled down, and after his prayers
said he turned to the Executioner, and with a chereful countenance spoke thus
merrily unto him: Pluck up thy spirits man, and be not afraid to do thine
Office: my neck is somewhat short, therefore take heed thou strikest not awry,
for saving of thine honesty: but if thou do, upon my word I will not
hereafter cast it in thy teeth. So, at one stroke of the Executioner, passed
Sir Thomas More out of this world, to God, upon the same day, which himself
had m^ desired. 6. Iulij. 15^5.

Soon after his death, intelligence thereof came unto the Emperor Charles the
fifth, whereupon he sent for Sir Thomas Elio^, then Ambassador there, and said
unto him: My Lord Ambassador, we understand, that the King your M^ister has
put his faithful servant, and grave Cou^^ (...) ^eath, (...) Thom^ (...)
Whereunto Sir Thomas E^ answered, that he had heard nothing thereof. Well
(quoth the Emperor) it is too true, and (...) will I say, that if I had been
Master of such a Servant (of whose counsels, and performance in State
matters my self have had th^se many years no small experience) I would rather
have lost the best City of my dominions, the^ such a worthy Counselor. Which
^peach of the Emperor was afterward related by Sir Thomas Eliot unto M.
William Roper, and his wife, being with him at supper; in the presence of one
M. Clement; ^. H^ywood, and their wives.

FINIS.
