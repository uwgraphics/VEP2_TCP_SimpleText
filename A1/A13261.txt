TO THE RIGHT NOBLE, and Honorable: Robert Earl of Salisburie, vicount
Cranborne, Baron of Essingdon, principal Secretary to his Majesty, Master
of the court of Wards and Liueries, Chancellor of the University of
Cambridge, knight of the Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Highness
most Honorable privy Council
RIght Honorable and my most honored Lord, albeit I have no special place
allotted me in the building of the holy Temple of our Savior, yet [I hope] I
may be permitted to behold, with joy of my soul, the rising of those
beautiful walls, and now and then [out of a zealous desire to have the work go
forvvard] set my hand thereunto, though I rank my self but amongst the
meanest of the laborers, those 3. score and ten thousand that bear burdens.
I presume I may: and have therefore brought this little Stone, or piece of
mortar, or whatsoever it prove, to further that holy building. The rather,
because it is so maliciously withstood by the crooked generation of Iannes and
Iambres, who [albeit they shall not prevail, as the Apostle assures them [for
truth must have that priuiledge] bend [notwithstanding] all their power
against it, and do their uttermost to lay the same [though it be Gods own
house] level with the ground. who can be silent that has tongue or pen in
such a cause? It is our masters own quarrel. Canes latrant pro Dominis suis
tu non me vis [saith a learned Father] latrare pro christo? Yet what I have
written is but a letter, and that, a Loue-letter; but it is [most Noble Lord] A
christian Loue-letter, persuading al (though perticularly directed to one) of
the Romish religion, with mild and charitable phrase, to a true faith in the
blood of Christ Ihesus. This letter I make bold [but in most humble manner] to
present unto your Ho. Which in respect of the Author [after the Philosophers
rule] I will neither praise nor dispraise Laudare se vani, vituperare stulti:
yet thus much it concerns me to make known, and (without imputation of
arrogance) I may report, that when I had writ this treatise (dreading the
insufficiency or partiallity of mine own judgment) I appealed unto two most
reverend and learned Divines, for their censure; who when they had perused
it, sent me away, my pains commended, the book not discommended, nor my self
any way discouraged; Otherwise, it should never have selt the press, at
least, never have presumed upon so Honorable patronage: Notwithstanding, I
confess it is unworthy your regard. But I hope your Hon: will deal no worse
with me then Christ did with the poor Widdovv in the Gospel: she brought
her farthing, I bring as much: Ioffer all I have, she offered no more: and, that
which makes a Mite a Million, with a free heart I cast it into the tresurie.
As a pledge therefore of my love to the church of Christ, my loyalty to my King
and country, and lastly of my most humble and my most dutiful affection unto
your Ho: (though I am vnknovvn unto you, as for any extraordinary means I have,
I am ever likely to be] I most humbly beseech your Lo: that the same may find
your How and gracious acceptance.

Devoted in all duty and service unto your Hon: John Svvynnerton.

A CHRISTIAN Loue-Letter: Sent to a Gentlewoman, mis-stiled a CATHOLIC, to
labor her conversion to the true Catholic faith of CHRIST JESUS.
ALthough Mistress KATHARINE, from the hour I first understood how pitifully
you were miscarried in matter of Religion, how erroneouslie misled in your
manner of doing service to the Almighty; I ever held (and not ignorant of the
divine prohibition of rash judgment) the state of your better part to be
dangerous: yet having (more then cursorilie) perused that worthy piece of work
(as you take it) the little book you sent me, I conceived a stronger ground
for my opinion, and might discern methoght, more cleerlie, even a lamentablenes
in your condition; to have your soul (after such sort) to be fed, or rather
feasted and not fed, or rather filled, and not feasted: but to speak most
properly, neither fed, nor feasted, nor filled, but flatly poisoned with such
Italian drugs, with such superstitious and Antichristian confections, as in the
said book, and diverse other your irreligious Pamphlets of like subject are
compounded; while that bread of life, which only should feed, it is not
hungered after, that incorruptible Manna, wherewith only it ought to be
feasted, is not gathered, that eternal food, which only has power to fill
it, is not set by: I mean while the true wholesome receipt [indeed] is rejected,
the pure and heaven and earth-out lasting word of God, neither read nor
regarded. I have felt my heart out of the general love of a christian, and my
more particular affection toward you, almost melt into sorrow and
compassion, to think how youly slabbering in these corrupted puddles of man's
erroneous inventions, yet never the more cleansed, when you might with as much
ease, and much better welcome, enter that liuesome Bath of Gods own founding,
his sacred scriptures, whose waters are of admirable operation, and [by the
hand of his blessed spirite] would be sure to wash, not only your feet [as
Job speaketh] but your hands and your head also [as Peter prayed, Job. 29, 6
] yea even your soul likewise, John 13, 9 Psalm. 19, 7
as David affirms, and make you all over as white as snow in Salmon. You may
not allege, that the book of God is lost or cast into a corner [as it was in
the days of Iosias] or that his sacred writings, 2 chr. 34, 14 Iere. 36, 23
are cut in pieces, and thrown into the fire, as they were by the hands of
Iehoiachim.

You cannot plead any famine of the word of God [which of all other
inflictions, the Lord for his mercy sake evermore auert from our nation] that
should enforce you to feed so eagerly upon such gross, and unwholesome
garbadge, for a greater plenty, and freer passage thereof, the King of heaven
have the glory, as we have the gain, never any kingdom of the earth [I
thinke] inioyed. The truth is, neither you, nor the greatest clark that ever
breathd superstition upon you, can bring a substantial reason to excuse your
vnacquaintance with the scriptures, considering you may read them, and hear
them truly read, and expounded [if you please] and that it is our saviors
own precept, Search the scriptures, John 5, 39 Mar. 12, 29
and a conclusion of his own framing, Err not knowing the Scriptures.

If an ordinary friend should counsel you to do a thing within your power,
that would be neither chargable nor trouble some unto you, and withal annex
unto his advise a forcible reason, importing some singular benefit, that should
redound in doing it, would you not with all readiness undertake it, and most
willingly embrace his counsel? I know you would: and therefore cannot choose
but wonder, when that extraordinary friend of yours Christ Jesus, who held
you [I charitablie include you amongst the chosen] as precious as his own
heart blood, and whom you should reesteeme more dear then your own soul,
shall offer you his own book to read, command you to read it, and withal
assertaine you, that you go astraie, and wander out of the right way that
leads to felicity, because you want that direction, which the same would
affoorde you: To see you notwithstanding shut your eyes, and ears, and all
your senses to be delighted and even ravished with such harsh sounding, and
vnmelodious harmony; such absurd, and heretical doctrine, as this book which
I received from you, and other of the like stamp [to frequent amongst you]
are stuffed with; Wherein I grant, some part of Gods word [to countenance
forth all the rest] is here and there inter-wouen, but that either not it
self through corrupt translation, or at least not like it self, it is so
violently wrested, and by misapplication so pitifully disfigured. When I had
read your book, entitled; A quartern of reasons of catholic Religion, with
as many brief reasons of refusal, collected and composed by T. Hill, Doctor
of Divinity, and had weighed the subject, the style, and the method, I
adjudged the answering of it to be a matter of no great difficulty, and
[methought] no task of impossibility for my self: though [as you know] no
professed Divine, no noted student, and indeed not worthy the name of a
Scholar; Howsoever, yet I undertook it, till in my return from you out of
Glostershire, at the Stationers in Worster I light upon a book bearing this
title, A quartern of reasons composed by D. Hill vnquartered and proved a
quartern of follies, by Francis Dillingham Batcheler of Divinity.

Hereupon seeing the Doctor so substantiallie dealt with by M. Dillingham, a
degree behind him one way, though many degrees before him another way, and
to have received from him a more sufficient answer the^ my poverty could have
affoorded, I willing lie surceased, and so let fall my former resolution: yet
being under sail, seeing the wind fair, and feeling my self to brook
prettily well the Ocean I was entered into, I thought to make a voyage of it
[though a contrary waie] before I returned; I mean, having taken pen in hand,
to have answered [in my unlearned fashion, and therefore the more suteable] the
foresaid Treatise, and perceiving my self so happily prevented, I determined
notwithstanding to write something unto you, that should concern you, and
whereby [if God were so pleased] that more then Egyptian darkness wherewith
yoursoule is so benighted, might in a timely hour be expelled.

For two chief reasons have I made religion the argument of this my letter;
the first, for that [there is nothing under the glory of God] that so highly
imports you, as the good estate of your soul, which depen death upon the
religion you profess in the days of this your pilgrimage upon earth. The
other reason is, because the difference of your religion and mine [our
contrary opinion therein] has bin the principal impediment that interrupted
our loves proceeding, and brake the marriage betwixt us, which the world so
long expected, and we [but for that] mutually desired. For as I, upon sure
ground was ever resolved one way, so you [though without ground] were as
resolut another way; and still would intimate your desire of my reconcilement
to your Catholic Religion (as you call it.] Indeed for a Gentlewoman that is
a catholic, to ponder aforehand that irreligion, though it cannot lawfully
break that indissoluble band, yet ought to be held of sufficient force to
restrain [at first] the making thereof, is a prudent consideration.

For her to weigh with her self that this word coniugium, or wedlock,
imports a uniting of two minds and that if she match with one contrarily
affected in religion, the only true tempred stuff that soldreth hearts
together, they, can never rightly accord, because they cannot agree in love,
that disagree in faith. This is like wise an ingenious and religious caution.

And then if she in true zeal and upon the forsaid considerations, convert
that heretic [whom she loueth] to the profession of the catholic faith,
before she dain him the title of her husband, Questionless she does a work
that pleases God, profits his church, and ministers matter of rejoicing to
the Angels of heaven. But stands the cause thus betwixt us two, I dare swear
[for I had rather think you any thing then a dissembler] you think it does:
you think your elfe a catholic, and mean heretic; you think the custom of
our young gentlewomen of your old religion, in turning their husbands hearts,
to the embracing of their opinions, a laudable custom; and ought by you
likewise as strictly to be observed: But alas that such blindness [were it
otherwise, pleasing to our great God, whose wisdom best knows what is good
for his Church] should get such possession of your understanding, and
Ignorance, so ouercloude your judgment, as to make you deem your self to be
otherwise then you are, and others to be even as the vncharitablest of your
constructions can make them. Alas I say, under the foresaid reservation,
that it should be so, howbeit I marvel not, that it is so, since it has bin
proper to the heriticks of old, preiudicatlie, to arrogate unto themselves that
acceptable appellation of catholics, and to entitle the catholics indeed, by
this odious attribute of heretics. But now (methinks) you begin to distaste my
phrase, because it begins to deal roundly with you, in retorting (though
covertly) the heretic thus upon you: be patient a while, and because no man
that judges himself sound is easily won to accept the Physicians help,
how full of virtue soever the Medicine be, which is tendered him: give me leave
I pray you, first to make you know your self to be imperfected, and then I
doubt not, but the receipt, which the small measure of my skill shall compound,
for the expelling of your infirmity, will not only be pleasing unto your
taste, but powerful [through his working that gives power to every good work]
for your recovery. It has bin held a profitable method, in the description of
any vice to anotamize that virtue which is properly the opposite; for the hard
favored gentlewoman is never so disaduantaged, as when she goes hand in hand
with her beutiful neighbor; each thing [indeed] being best deciphered by his
contrary. I will therefore [the question being which of us is the catholicks]
first discover mine own faith, which you hold to be no better then heresy, and
the very contrary unto yours; that thereby the beutie of your profession, if
mine be so deformed, may the more be admired, or rather [as I hope] and [if
judicial eyes impartially discern berwixt us assure my selfe] that the
impuritie, and blemishes thereof, by such opposition of mine, so substantially
warrantable may the sooner be revealed, and by yourselfe whom it so neerelie
concerns the better discerned: and the rather do I begin with disclosing the
substance of mine own profession, because we are bound to sind the true faith
of christ in our selves, before we examine the want thereof in others, and ought
readily to give a reckoning of the same, if either authority [that is
sufficient] inioyne, or causes [that are substantial] as in this case shall
induce us thereunto.

MY religion [vnderstand me I pray you] Is the true worship of the everliving
God, 2. Sect.
I know it is the true worship of God because it is that manner and form of
worship, which is agreeable to his blessed will; I know it is agreeable to his
will, because it is framed acording to the prescription of his holy word: And I
know it to be framed according to his word, because I learn the same out of
his own book, which contains nothing but his word; delivered first by his
own voice to our fore fathers, after indighted by his own all-sufficient
wisdom, penned down by his own chosen servants the prophets and Apostles,
sealed and confirmed with the precious blood of his own dear son, and from
age to age, through persecution, through captivity, thorough the most
powerful occurrents that ever Satan devised, for impugning the same, by his
own wonderful providence so mercifully preserved, to be food for the souls,
and direction for the lives of his elect here on earth, while the world
endures, which book we therefore entitle the sacred scriptures, and commonly
the Bible: so that my Religion is, a worshipping of god after his own will,
revealed by his own word comprised in his own book: and therefore as I first
said, a true worship of the everliving God. And, is it not [iudge you] the
wisest course we can take for the understanding the will of our God, without
which we are no better then the beasts that perish, and which necessarily we
must attain unto before we can do it, as we must do it; before we receive
that which you call the wages of well-doing. To read diligently this book, to
search reverently these scriptures, and to have continual recourse unto this
word, which may be called the trusty Ambassador that faithfully delivers the
revealed councels of God, the holy mouth that truly utters the oracles of
his blessed sanctuary, which is the word of life, the word of truth, as true
as himself, his own word, and therefore the best reuealer of his will, and
most absolute describer of that platform, after which he delights to be
worshipped.

I will not by way of inference as I go along, roue at any marks of your
profession, til I have in some perfecter sort measured out mine own, else could
I [me thinks] with an arrow drawn out of this quyuer, pierce even the quickest
vain of those unwarranted Decretals, and human Traditions of yours. But let
your thoughts a while be bestowed in consideration of what I say touching mine
own religion, which erst I desined to be, The true worshipe of the everliving
God. Wherein least you should mistake, in thinking I deal Pharasaically, or
attribute perfection of impossibility unto my self, who being but flesh, am
therefore full of sin, and thereby disabled for that righteous carriage, and
the perfourmance of those holy offices, which properly belong to the service of
him, who is all righteousness, and true holiness it self: conceive I pray you,
how I understand my self, and desire to be understood therein. I confess that
all men are sinners, and my self as sinful as any man, I might say more
sinful, for I must judge my self severely, and of others charitably: besides,
I know mine own wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. The Angels of
heaven, that excel in strength may keep (o happy, happy are they that while)
the commandments of the Lord, but the inhabitants of the earth, that are
composed of weakness, do nothing but break them; In a word, I am one of
Adams crooked brats, My works are impure, and all my righteousness as a
polluted cloute. So that to do true worship to that Everliving God (as I
professed) of my self, I am not able, for a sinful lump of flesh, I find
it impossible. Who am I (said Moses in a timorous distrust of his own
ability,) Exodus 3, xi
that I should go unto Pharo. The^ what am I, may I better expostulate from the
certain knowledge of my disabilitie, to worship the Euarlasting God? What am
I, that am a thousand times inserior to that Moses, to worship him truly, who
is ten thousand, nay innumerable and vnimaginarie millions of degrees superior
to that Pharo. But the same God, who [in respect of his own desert, being the
perfection of all things, and all perfection before things had being]
requires such exact service from me, knows whereof I am made, for I am, a
work of his own hands, and remembers that, I am but dust the substance of
my forefathers, unskillful how [for I am no better then a beast in my own
knowledge, and unapt if I were skillfull, so to serve him, My heart by nature
being continually so misdisposed. And out of the great storehouse therefore of
his invaluable compassion, has he sent me a full supply to all my desects,
and plainly directed me how to adresse my self for the manner of service,
which must purchase his acceptance: for as he gave encouragement to Moses, and
taught him with his own word what to say unto, and how to carry himself
before Pharo. It has pleased him in like sort to imbolden me in my greatest
sear, and by the perfect rule of the same powerful word, to instruct me after
what sort to appear before him, and how to demean my self in the presence
of his Majesty, his sacred word [I say still] the spirit of truth expounding
the same unto me, is my instruction.

Hence I learn [which is the lesson that all christians should be perfect in]
the knowledge of Jesus christ, and him crucified, to know him to be perfect God
and perfect Man, my maker, my savior, my mediator. My maker as he is God, my
Savior and mediator, as he is God and man: this is all I desire to know, and
may be well enough, for that learned Apostle of his, notwithstanding his
miraculous conversion, abundant inspiration, and heavenly vision, [by his own
testimony, knew no more, as he needed not, the docctrine thereof being
[indeede] the very sum, and scope of the whole scriptures. This knowledge
whosoever has, though he know nothing else, knows all things: as who so
wants the same, though he know all things else, may be said to know
nothing.

This is that crystal sountain from whence the pure Waters of life do flow,
and they that drink soundly thereof shall never thirst. This is that fixed
Helice which if we truly observe, points out our land of promise, and
directs us the right way thither; Nay, this is the way it self that leads
us unto truth; and the truth it self that leads unto life; and the life it
self that we so long after, even eternal selicitie, I am the way, John 14, 6.
the truth and the life: Now, from this knowledge of my savior, I learn to
renounce my self and rely upon him, to cast off mine own beggarly rags
patched together with abomination, and by the hand of faith to put on his
princely robe, the glorious robe of his righteousness. In this attire I appear
before my god, and become acceptable in his presence, for this garment he freely
gives me, and as freely teaches me how to wear it: I mean this
righteousness of Christ, which is the true consormitie with the law of GOD,
and an absolute fulfilling thereof: God, out of his mere grace and mercy
impureth unto me, and withal woo^keth in me faith, whereby I apply the same
unto my self, so that in this sense, I may presume to say the righteousness of
Christ is mine, and that therein I serve my God truly, as he that labored so
much even to anotamize the work of justification, has for an eternal Maxim
set down, that Christ is made unto us righteousness, wisdom, 1 cor. 1, 30
sanctification, and redemption, and else where, That in him we are complete.
Col. 2, 10
The frail wit of man has devised a law, whereby an act dove by one is
remitted from him that did it, to him that gave consent and commission for the
doing of it. But the unsearchable wisdom of our God, from the deep reach of
his mercy, and compassion, without so much as our knowledge (for he knew us
from everlasting, and before the foundation of the world, contrived this
means for our deliuery]hath more then admirably conveyed unto us the memorable
act of Christ's humiliation and satisfaction, and by his imputation, and our
aprehension (which is likewise his guifte) freelye made it ours. The work it
self which is Justice, not altered by the exchange of the subject, but only
inattribute. It being I egall in Christ, in us Evangelical: If then the
righteousness of Christ thus be made ours, if his obedience and satisfaction
be thus freely bestowed upon us: What should hinder us (it may be meruailed)
from affording due entertainment to so unspeakable a benefit, and that we make
not true use of so great advantage. Is not this the delectablest food that ever
any hungry stomach longed after? Is it not the softest couch that the wearied
soul can find to repose upon? Questionless it is, and therefore whosoever
resolves to fare well, should frame himself to this diet, and he that loves
to lie soft, must become his own Harbinger, and make sure in time to take up
this lodging: For this is the food of eternal life, this is the bed of
everlasting rest. Peter not himself, but being then, (and not only then) out of
his proper Element [for he knew not what he said] brake with christ about
building of tabernacles on the mount Thabar. But he that upon this foundation
which is christ himself shall advisedly erect the fortress of his hope, and
Tabernacle of his felicity, may be truly said to be his own man, though
scarcely as the apprehension of men goes now a days, and that he is in the
right, For he knows what he does, and that his building, though all those
wordely, fleshly, and devilish adversaries, combino in oppugnation, can never
be subverted. In more propper sense therefore then Peter spoke it, I may
boldly say, Here is good being, good for the King, good for the Beggar, good
for all, here is good being indeed, and here am I constantly resolved, let
never so many millions of misbeleeuers rest upon what other rotten dependence
they list, to set down my rest for ever.

This stay I know to be sure and never shrincking: this supportation I am sure
is strong and never shakes. This, this is our souls most firm, and
neuerfailing anchorage: yea this righteousness of our sweet, and loving
savior, is not only a sure strong and never failing foundation, but it is the
only sure strong and never failing foundation, whereupon we must resolve to
build all our happiness for ever, if ever we resolve to for to rely upon ought
besides, that the earth, or the heavens themselves can afford, in the great and
weighty cause of our justification, is to trust unto that which shall never
stedde us, and most undoubtedly to become most unhappy. Now, this
righteousness of our merciful redeemer, so aduantageable to all those that
constantly depend thereuppon, I consider in his perfect obeying to the law of
God, which we had transgressed, and could never of our selves have fulfilled,
and his painful undergoing the punishment proper to such our transgressions,
even the wrath of his father, which was incensed, and by no satisfaction of
man, or Angel could ever have bin appeased. O sweet, vneffable and
incomprehensible mercy of our God, who out of his own bosom has distilled a
balm to cure all our wounds, though never so mortal, and albeit so
deservedly received in the traitorous breach of his sacred ordinances, and
not spared even his own heart blood, to wash away our uncleanness, and to
purge us that were his enemies, from all our corruption. The means that
conueieth unto us this mercy of God the father in this merit of God the
son, is [as I formertouched] a lively justifying faith, begotten in our
hearts by God the Holi-ghost, who must needs be thefficient cause of the said
Faith, as the true knowledge and trust in Christ is the formal, the gospel
the isntrumental, and the final gods glory. By which faith, it being The
ground of things which are hoped for, Hebr. 11, 1
and the evidence of things which are not seen, or a steadfast supernatural
knowledge and firm apprehension of Gods kindness in Christ Jesus toward us.
Many celestial indowmentes and good works are kindled in the mind and heart,
and flame forth of the life and conversation of every true believer; as
repentance, hope, love, invocation, obedience, justification, adoption,
patience, consolation, mortification, peace of conscience, joy in the
holighost, and regeneration with the fruits thereof: All of them together with
diverse other such like heavenly infused qualities, though not distinguishable
in time but in nature, though essentially being Gods gifts, and immediately
proceeding from his grace, yet properly either begotten, wrought or
apprehended by the said Faith, it being in us a cause, and they the necessary
effects, the root, and they the inseparable branches: So that when I affirm
my religion to be, The true service of God and that service to be performed
truly by us, in the righteousness of Christ, I do not herein exclude our
works as impertinent or unnecessary thereunto, or deny but that good works
are Gods services, and that therein it pleases him to be glorified: But
because our works when they are at the best are of themselves imperfect, and
when they find the happiest passage, not for themselves, but in and for
Christ's righteousness are accepted, I judge it a more proper speech to say, that
in the righteousness of Christ which is absolutely perfect, which is freely
bestowed upon us, and really made ours by faith, and from which as from the
fountain of all Gods graces, all our own good works are properly said to
spring, that therein we serve God truly [it being of it self as it well
deserves merritorious, and making our poor endeavors, which of themselves
deserve nothing, most graciously to be regarded.

Indeed it is all in all unto us, reconciling us to the favor of our God, and
inablinge us to do that which is acceptable both before God and man: for where
this righteousness is faithfully received; This righteousness, through which
only we enjoy all the blessings of the earth, by which only (as I said) our
best deeds must purchase acceptance, and for which only we confidently hope,
at the last day to be saved: where I say this righteousness is truly
apprehended by faith, by virtue of the same the heart, and all the powers of
the whole man, are instantly pressed (so much as in him lies) for all godly
designs, and eagerly bent (so far as by grace he is enabled) to the execution
of any religious office, that may tend to the service of his Lord and savior,
and to the manifestation of his obedience, love, and thankfulness to his
majesty, for such his unspeakable mercy toward him: for look how proper
light is to the sun or heat to fire, so proper, and so inseparable are good
works unto that faith which is so surely founded upon the mercy of God, in
this righteousness of Christ Jesus: No I am so far from renouncing or
disclaiming from good works, that I will acompany any true, or styled
catholic, protestant or papist in the world, in commendation, estimation, and
approbation of them, till they come to be so intollerably prized, as to be set
in the room of christ's righteousness, to fulfill the eternal law of God,
which was Christ's office, to be held meritorious of salvation, which is the due
of christ's obedience; and consequently to be made proportionable with Gods
justice, which is only proper to christ's righteousness; In this degree of
magnifieng them I hold it security to leave them, acknoledging my poverty one
way, [acording to that rate] not able to reach them: and knowing my riches
another way (after such a reckoning not to stand in need of them, for We are
poor in our selves but rich in Christ, I confess that to glorify God by
doing good works, is a principal end both of our election, creation,
redemption, and sanctification: I confess that works are necessary, for great
and weighty respects, as besides the honnouring of God, which is the chief
end of all, and to be preferred before any respect whatsoever, to manifest our
faith, to credit our vocation, to express our thankfulness, to benefit our
neighbor, and to acertaine us, that we are in the right way, that leads to
everlasting happiness; yea so far fourth necessary, that without them, I
mean without the works of the second, or at least of the first Table, we
shall never attain unto salvation: Howbeit, I dare not thence conclude, that
those works are the cause of our salvation, but the effects of the cause,
which is faith in the righteousness of christ.

I confess that all our good works shall be rewarded even to a cup of cold
Water, yet will not thereby enferre, that such reward is extended for the merit
either of the person that does the work, or of the work how well done soever,
but from the mere bounty of our god, who deals with us (in all things)
better then (of our selves) we deserve; and for manifestation of his truth, who
has gaged his word to that effect, and will ever be as good as his promise. In
a word I approve good works, I honor the doers of them, and admire that
grace which by faith enableth men to do them: but still understand them to be
the fruits and consequents of faith, and in us to receive their life and being
from the same; for I cannot think that repentance or charity themselves,
though both of them steed us so much in this world, and the one of them stay
with us in the world to come, are sent by the blessed spirit, into the hearts
or minds of the faithful, till faith formerly planted there by the same
spirit, be ready to receive them. For I know they are divine virtues, and no
sins: Howbeit had they being before faith, I durst not think them so, To,
14, 23
because I am commanded to hold the necessity of this consequent whatsoever is
not of faith is sin, to be invincible. A legal contrition [indeede] and
human effection may go before, but when that contrition becomes true
repentance, and that affection is refined into perfect charity: Questionless,
it is faith, it being the receiver of the spirit and purifier of the heart, by
which under God is wrought that happy and heavenly metamorphosis.

But to wade no deeper in this bottomless Ocean, where the pilate himself if
he take not good heed, may quickly sinck over head and ears, 3. Sect.
so infinite are the mysteries of our redemption, and so many degrees more then
infinite the mercies of God in our redemer: And because I stand in fear, least
for the difficulty, you conceit not, or for the strangenes thereof affect not
this description, which I have already made of my Religion; I will after a
plainer sort for your understanding, and in a fashion more suitable for our
liking, draw forth in a word or two that pattern which in the profession of my
faith and action of my life, till the days of my pilgramage, in this veil of
affliction be determined, I am resolved by the aid of the blessed spirit
precisely to follow; and whence as touching the discharge of my duty both
toward God, and man, I fetch my direction. I formerly employed, that this
pattern was the written word, and so I do still for the word of God is a
Lantern unto our feet, and a light unto our paths, Psa, 119
a Lantern to keep our feet from falling, in the race that we are to run
for so great a Wager, and a light to make our paths though they be narrow,
and otherwise impossible to be hit, yet plain and passable unto us: but an
Epitomy only of this word I will now propose unto you, which consists of the
creed, the commandments, and the lords prayer; the creed indicted by the holy
ghost, and (from probability) penned by the apostles, howsoever yet composed of
their doctrine, and therefore not unworthily called their creed The
commandments indicted [and penned to for ought we know by god himselfe] and
delivered to his chosen servant Moses on the Mount Synay: and the Lords prayer
indicted, by christ our savior, and afterward penned down, by those heavenly
inspired actuaries of his, the holy Evangelists; the creed comprizing the
substance of the gospel, which is a joyful message of salvation, bestowed upon
us under a condition of faithful believing: The commandments comprehe^ding
the sum of the law, which is an assurance of eternal life unto us, but under a
condition of a harder nature, namely the exact performance of our duty
toward God, and our neighbor, expressed in these commandments; And the
Lords prayer containing an absolute Method of invocation, or a perfect rule
how to offer the sacryfice of praise and prayer unto our God, wherewith he
confesses himself to be honored, and wherein our service unto his majesty
[especially from our inward man] is most effectually performed the creed, which
is our law of believing. The commandments which are our laws of living, and
the Lords prayer which is our law of praising and praying, and long since for
the dignity of it entitled even the Law likewise of living, and believing:
Now, the creed, the commandments, and the Lords prayer, being thus in effect,
a compendious breuiarie of the whole Bible, which contains the sacred word
of the everliving God, whereby his blessed will, for our manner of serving him
is manifestly revealed unto us; and the definition of my religion being a true
service of the everliving God, according to his will revealed in his word, I
am warranted (not any way impugning the same) to affirm, that my religion is,
to believe according to the creed, to live according to the commandments, and
to invoke the name of God according to the Lords prayer. Howbeit, I
understand not here this word (according) in sense of absolute corospondence,
with the creed, the commandments and the Lords prayer; But under this
humble and necessary reservation, namely that I believe according to the
creed, as steadfastly, and assuredly, that I live according to the
commandments, as uprightly and conformably, and that I invoke the name of
God, according to the Lords prayer as zealously and effectually, as the
measure of faith, grace, and the spirit do enable me: For these are al Gods
gifts, and he freely bestows them upon his needy followers, in proportion
that is best pleasing to his unchangeable will, and most agreeable to his
unsearchable wisdom: For I dare not think better of my self in the ability
of believing, living and praying, then my betters have formerly done of
themselves: [O that I were so graciously qualified, whereby I might justly be
occasioned to think so wel] my betters, I mean the best of Gods servants,
some of them having cried unto the Lord for help to their unbelief, and to
have their faith increased: Some having agnized that the godlyest seven times a
day, show what house they are come of, whose loins they proceed from, that
Adam the ringleader of man-sinners, was their ancestor: and some auerring that
we of our selves know not, what to pray as we ought, and therefore [to help
us out] that the spirit it self makes request for us with sighs that cannot
be expressed. Wherefore [as in effect I said before] I believe as the measure
of faith does enlighten me acording to the creed: I live as the measure of
grace does enable me, according to the commandments: and I pray as the
measure of the spirit does inform me, according to the Lords prayer. Thus I
believe, thus I live, thus I pray, this is my religion, and [as I take it] The
true service of the everliving God, according to his will revealed in his word.
Now, having [as I promised] after that little glimpse of understanding, by the
mercy of my God, reserved in me, given you a view of my profession, which
through the subtilitie of Satan, playing upon your simplicity, you are
smoothly borne in hand, is so erroneous, absurd, and Heretical; I would gladly
know wherein such heresy, absurdity or error can be found: but it was my
promise, and is still my purpose [if God, that disposes of all things
howsoever man purposes be pleased therwith] to make you see the vnseemelines
of your own misshapen opinions, and to feel the daungerousnesse of your own
souls disease, by understanding the error, absurdity, and heresy of your
own religion. Which I know not how better or in plainer sort to perform, then
by laying before your view the doctrine of your Roman church, in opposition to
the doctrine of our church of England, touching these principal heads of a
christians profession, which I have already, [though briefly, and but in part]
run over, that so comparing the one with the other, and trying them both by
the touchstone, that discovers truth from falsehood, you may more iudicially
descerne the current from the counterfeit, and more powerfully be induced
(having once found so inestimable a Jewel) to long after the full fruition
thereof, which [although you sell all you have to gain it] will not prove
dear unto you, for it will make you rich unto eternal salvation.

AND first against my religion, 4. Sect.
which I defined, and proved to be The true service of the everliving God,
according to his will revealed in his word, I must be so bold with yours, as to
call it, a forged service of God according to the will of man, revealed in
traditians, decretals, and counsels: I may term it, a forged service of God,
because it is according to the will of man only, and not of God; and I dare
say, it is according to the will of man only, because it is only revealed in
these Traditions, merely human, unwarrantable Decretals, and Counsels not
lawfully called: and are you not in a hard case already, even upon this
entrance into consideratior. of your religion? Do you not think it a
miserable condition, whereunto with their plausible persuasions, they whom you
deem your ghostly fathers, [but by the Holighost himself, are described by
creeping into houses and leading captive silly Women, such as your self] have
done their best to tie you? Is it not [and be your own iudge] a dangerous case,
and a condition most disaduantagable so to be traduced, to fasten your souls
dependence upon a course of serving God, which neither by God himself, nor
Christ Jesus his son, nor by his faithful servants the prophets, or
Apostles, was ever commanded; no nor by the general consent of the fathers of
the primitive church for 5. C. years at least after Christ's incarnation, ever
prescribed, or practiced. For your adoration and invocation of Sa. your prayers
for the souls of your friends departed, your superstitious pilgrimages, your
communion under one kind only, your calling up on God for you know not what, in
a tongue you understand not, your sacrifice of the mass, your meriting by your
works, and diverse other such like gross and absurd opinions, whereupon your
religion is composed, as they can find no substantial warrant, in the sacred
canonical scriptures, which are Gods pure truth, and contain all things
necessary for our salvation. So had they not their birth immediately upon the
Apostles death, but some of them sprang up two hundred, some three hundred,
some five hundred years after, some sooner, some later, and were not al til
within this very age, even the memory of men now living, by your selus
consented unto, nor absolutely by your own usurped authority concluded upon.
Hence may you easily gather [your religion being neither sufficiently waranted
by authority of Gods word, nor generally approved by the ancient fathers of the
church] how woorthily or unworthily you style the same with such confidence,
the old and catholic religion: I cannot go on with particular examination of
every part of your profession, your patience, and my leisure, being I fear
proportionable will not permit me, but do beg your atte^tion to the
consideration of one principal point of doctrine, generally taught by your
greatest clarks, and as generally believed even to the simplest amongst you,
whose stomachs indeed are the best digesters of such misdiet because at the
hands of ignorance, error ever finds her securest entertainment, I
formerlye, in discourse of our Religion affirmed, that our whole dependence for
our salvation was upon the free mercy of God through christ Jesus: And the
righteousness of christ without any work or merit of our own applied truly
by faith, was before God our only justification: contrary to this doctrine, you
are taught and do believe that you shall be saved by your works, or at least
that your works must concur, and stand up with faith in the act of your
justification before God. Now to make you see and acknowledge the absurdity and
prejudice of this opinion: first you shall hear what the Apostle himself
inspired with the holy spirit, and the fathers of the church having the same
divine scholmaister, though instructed in far different measure, have thought
and delivered touching the same; and then some principal inconveniences that
necessarily follow that doctrine, pregnant and aparant enough [I hope] utterly
to deter you from ever lending a listening ear again thereunto. Titus. 3, 5
Paul that writ more touching the manner of our justification then all the
rest of the Apostles, to make his Scholar Titus, and others by him to abandon
all hope of being saved by their works, tells him plainly, We are saved not
by works of righteousness which we have done, but acording to his mercy he
saved us: Here he excludes works, though they be works of righteousness,
though they be our best works, and ascribes all the matter of our salvation
merely to the mercy of God through Jesus christ; I am sure, there is no work
that you or the holiest of your church whatsoever can do, that is a better
work more meritorious, a work of purer righteousness then the works of
Paul were. No, they hold in no comparison with his, for his works (as yours
do not) sprang from a lively faith, which made them so good as they were,
notwithstanding, you see he utterly renounceth them all how good soever, and
dare you in any sort rest upon yours in this important matter of justification?
The said Apostle laboring to win the Romans to the same faith, reads them
this lecture to the same effect. To. 6, 23
The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our savior: Here you are plainly told what are the causes of
going to hell, and coming to heaven. The desert of man the cause of damnation,
but the mercy of God the cause of salvation; our sin does incur the one, for
the reward of sin is death: but our best deserts merit not the other, for,
eternal life is merely the gift of God through Jesus Christ: had Paul that
learned Apostle, in this point approved the doctrine of your church thus
[questionlesse] or to this effect, he would have concluded, the reward of sin
is death, and the reward of good works is eternal life: but you see he quite
overthrows that opinion, leaving us of our selves to deserve the one, but
ascribing the other to Gods free guifte in Christ beyond our desert.

But if neither of these places have power to remove you from your former
opinion, give me leave to produce one saying more out of the same author,
which I assure my self [so you ponder it rightly] will pierce even the
quickest vain of your heart, if the same [as I hope in my savior it is not]
be not utterly benumbed, the sufferings [saith he] of this life are not worthy
of the glory to come. I conceive that the works whereby you hope to merit at
Gods hands are the works of doing, and works of suffering, the former more
easy, and less deserving, the latter less easy, and therefore (as you are
taught] the more meritorious: but Paul that knew what it was both to do and
suffer, better then those by whom you are persuaded to place such hie affiance
in your works, preaches unto you here another kind of doctrine, namely that
even the sufferings of this life, your afflictions, your deeds of best desert,
are not worthy of the glory to come. And you may be assured that no man that
ever fought under the banner of Christ Jesus suffered more for his sake, or
deserved heaven better for his sufferings then he that teaches you this
lesson. For he testifies of himself that the sufferings of Christ did abound
in him. That in labors, he was more abundant then other in ripes above
measure, Co. 11, 23
in prison more plenteously, on death often, that of the Jews five times he
received forty stripes save one, that he was thrice beaten with rods, once
stoned, thrice suffered shripwracke, that he was night and day in the deep
Sea; In iournying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils
of his own nation, in perils among the gentiles, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the Sea, in perils amongst false
breathren, In weariness and painfulness, in watching often, In hunger and
thirst, in fasting often; In cold and in nakedness, and beside the things
that were outward he was combred daiely, and had the ear of all the Churches.
Phi 1, 13
And that his bands in Christ were famous throughout all the judgment hall,
and in all other places.

These are Paul's own words of himself, and his sufferings. Now if ever
there were such merit in our works, sure here it was: if ever the desert of
sinful man could justly have challenged such a reward as everlasting life,
doubtless, Paul for these his sufferinges would have put in with the foremost:
Howbeit you see when he speaks of the glory to come, and the proper cause of
our attayning unto eternal salvation, he then disclaimeth from al his works,
from these his sufferings and all; and cherefully runs to another refuge even
the righteousness of his savior christ Jesus, wherein there is true merit
indeed, and wherewith he knovveth the justice of God is worthily satisfied,
and our eternal peace only procured; thus you see what this holy Apostle of
christ Jesus thought touching this point of man's meriting; And I pray you mark
how firmly the learned Fathers of the church cleave unto the same doctrine: My
first place out of Paul was that we are saved not by etc. And Saint Ierom,
one whom your church highly reuerenceth, writes in this manner; Hier: lib: 1,
ad, Pelag
Then are we just, when we confess our selves to be sinners: And our justice
consists not of our own merit but of Gods mercy: Here this holy father in
the matter of justification, rejects with S. Paul all our own merit, and
refers the same wholly to Gods mercy. My second place out of the Apostle
was, that the Wages of sin is death, but the gift of GOD is eternal life
through etc. Origene one of the most ancient Fathers of the church in
exposition of these very words, of Paul says thus, Origin in ep, ad, To: ca,
4, lib, 4
The apostle says that the wages of sin is death, but he added not and said
likewise the wages of justice is eternal life, but he says eternal life is
the gracious gift of God, to teach us that wages which is like to debt, and
reward is a recompense of pun shment and death, and to assign eternal life to
grace only. Thus you hear this reverent father expounds Paul, that our
wickedness justly meriteth condemnation, but that the ballaunce wants weight
the other way, and that our best deeds merit not salvation, which is assigned
to grace only; and if only to grace, then are all our works absolutely
excluded in that business.

My last place out of paul was, The sufferings etc. Answerable to this, says
Saint Barnard on this manner. Now concerning eternal life, we know the
sufferings of this life are not worthy of the glory to come, Barn. in Anunt
Mariae. Sermon. 1
no not if one man should suffer all, here this devout and religious father
remoueth all doubt touching the former doctrine by a forcible supposition on
this manner. Admit that the afflictions and persecutions of Paul, of Peter, of
James, and all the Apostles, that the pain and torments of the Primitive
Church, and of those five and twenty Bishops which successively were martyred
for the name of Jesus. And that all the tortures and sufferings of all the
Saints of God in allages from the death of Abell, to the last drop of blood
that ever shall be shed upon the earth for the testimony of the Lords truth were
laid upon one man to bear, and that it were possible for him only to under
go the pains, torments, and tortures, that they all endured, yet were the
glory of eternal life to rich a guerdon for those his sufferinges, he could
not merit heaven thereby, for the infinite justice of God, must have a greater
satisfaction. This was the holy fathers censure hereupon, No not [saith he] if
one man should suffer all.

Now let me reason with you by an invincible and familiar argument, if the
sufferings of Paul, or of any of these holy martyrs, whose continual
persecutions and torments, were instead of many deaths unto them. Nay, if all
their pains, tortures and deaths, joined together, would not make up a desert
answearable to the meed of everlasting glory: It must needs follow that your
deeds and sufferings, which carry no nearer a proportion with the other, then
your span does with the spatiousnes of the whole earth, can merit no such
matter, and shall never for any desert they are of, come home so rewarded No,
no you must not look for such an inrichment after such a reckoning, but rather
say with the same Saint Barnard, Sermon, 1 anunt. Mar
whom your selves confess to be one of the sweetest queresters in the Lords
quier, What are all our merits to so great glory?

The gardens of all the Fathers of the Church, are thick set with these
flowers, they all of them teach [if true vnderstood] the self same doctrine.
Thus you hear then what the Scriptures and Fathers have deliuere touching our
justification, how they refer the same wholly to the mercy and grace of God in
the righteousness of Christ Jesus, and shake off our own merits, as having no
hand in that work nor worthiness in that degree to be trusted unto.

But fearing least you are made believe that the Scriptures as we read them are
false, and the Fathers as we use to allege them but wrested, [as what will not
falsehood affirm, to discountenance the truth, or error be ashamed to say for
her own shelter] I will yet attempt another mean, which I assure my self
will cool, and am in good hope utterly extinguishe that your conceit of
merritting, and it shall be by making known unto you the wonderful
inconvenience you incur, and the dangerous praemunire that your soul runs
into by holding your works in such estimation.

There are two principal virtues, whereby our grations God vouchsafes to
manifest himself to the know ledge of his servants upon the earth, and wherein
it pleases his divine omnipotency to be delighted, and they are his mercy and
his Justice. There are likewise 2. principal offices, which our merciful
Savior daigned to undertake for our sakes, whereby the favor of God, which
our old notorious pranke had estranged, is regaind unto us, and thorough the
blessed means whereof, we are not only become gracious with him in this world,
but have assurance of his sight, and the happy fruition of eternal felicity
in the world to come, and those are his redeemershippe, and mediatorshippe:
and I pray you what will you think of your Religion, if the same, nay if one
branch thereof among twenty, as rotten as it self, if this only point of
attributing merit to your works, in the act of your justification, does
impair and manifestly obscure the dignity of these excellent proprieties of
God his mercy, and his Justice, and withal disparage, and apparently detract
from the Worthynesse of Christ his merit in that his redeemershippe, and
mediatourshippe; if your religion [I say] be guilty of such heinous treason
against the divine Majesty, will you not then judge it your securest course to
abandon her dangerous fellowship, and embrace [insteed therof] for your
comfort true christianity, of whom you shall be sure to learn nothing but
true faith, and true obedience to your heavenly Sovereign: In discovery hereof
it is behoouefull for you to conceive, that as the essence of God is infinite
and perfect, so these proprieties of God his mercy and Justice [because they
are essential in him] must likewise of necessity, be perfect and infinite:
which being granted, does not every opinion that shall intimate defect or
insufficiency therein, impair [as I said,] and manifestly obscure the dignity
thereof? you cannot deny but it does, neither shall you ever be able
substantially to clear your doctrine of merits, from this high and perilous
imputation. For look how much you attribute to your own merits in the
purchase of salvation: So much you detract away from Gods mercy in Christ,
which is the proper, and only price, whereby the same is purchased: God which
is rich in mercy [saith Paule] through his great love wherewith he loved us,
Esphe. 2, 4.
even when we were dead in sin, has quickened us together in Christ, for by
grace are ye saved, and has raised us up together, and made us sit together in
heavenly things, through Christ Jesus. And in another place formerly alleged,
God has not saved us for the deeds of righteousness which we have wrought,
but of his mercy has he saved us. Here the mercy of God appears like it
self, Paul gives it his due, and makes it the only doer of the matter of
salvation: you on the contrary, believe that you shall be saved by your works
only, or at least by your works and this grace coupled together: here the mercy
of god is showed forth unlike it self, you rob it of his due, making it either
nothing at all, as when you will be justified merely by your own deeds without
it, or at least but a partner with you, when your deeds must draw in the same
yoke with it, as coaiutors or fellow workers in that business.

Assure you self therefore, that the perfect and infinite mercy of our good
and gracious God, does not agree with the imaginary merit of flesh and blood,
but is [and that not a little] indignified, by this gross and presumptuous
doctrine; for do but seriously ponder with your self, whether that mercy can
be infinite, that has need of a supplement, and how it can be perfect, when it
must be eeked out with deeds of imperfection: yet is it perfect, and infinite,
and shall ever remain so, let never so many millions of your merit founders
deserve thereof as ill as they can, by such their confidency in their own
deseruinges. The same indignity you profer to the justice of God, which being
likewise [as his mercy is] perfect and infinite: you hope nevertheless will be
satisfied with corrupted intigrety, and appeased with your poluted
righteousness: but you are as wide from the truth as the East is from the
West, for there is no justice that can stand against the justice of God, but
that which carries proportion answearable thereunto. It requires an entire and
full payment; And it is not the low-prized dross of Egypt, our stained and
impure actions, but the refined gold of Saba, the unspotted, and pure
righteousness of christ Jesus, that in the great day of our account will pass
for current. No no you should be so far from arrogating unto your self, any
ability to the answering of that so infinite, and awful justice of God
almighty, as rather firmly, and constantly to rest assured, that the
vprightnes of all the men on earth, though the same indeed [respectiuely] be
pleasing, and acceptable unto God, nor the integrity of all the Angels of
heaven, yet I know they excel in strength, and are now confirmed from ever
falling: nor the holiness of all the Saints, both in heaven, and in earth,
[albeit I confess they make up that church, which christ himself calls
fair, and without spot, and honoreth beside with the title of his sister, his
love his spouse, his dove, and his undefiled. That the vprightnes [I say]
integrity, and holiness of all these Angels and saints, nay the power of all
their desert joined together, cannot calm the tempest of Gods justice from
showring down indignation upon all the sons of Adam for their original and
actual transgression, nor so much as qualify the said justice toward your
self in particular, nor make a condign satisfaction for your sins only, no
not for the least sin though you extenuate and mince it to the least of your
venial sins, that ever you committed; for any sin is a breach of the whole
law, and who knows not the transgression of the law is that proper act of
rebellion, whereby this infinite justice is so worthily incensed, as without an
infinite satisfaction never to be apeased: yet are you bold of your self to
rush in upon that displeased majesty, and having no lawful warrant to present
the same with an hollow bird of your own worthiness: but you have often heard
that it is ill dallieng with saints, and let me by the way advise you to beware
how you jest any more with such edg-tooles as Gods justice: Howbeit your
doctrine of merits for all these wrongs, both to the mercy and Justice of
God, does not yet find lymits to bound his outrage in, but breaks out
further to ouerflow even the obedience, and sufferinges of our merciful savior
christ Jesus, and as much as lies in the hands of heresy to annihilate his
blessed righteousness the very truth only and all-sufficient act of our
redemption.

This righteousness of christ, (which none but the rabble of Antichrist will
deny) you must understand is perfect: And it is necessary it should be so, for
it encountereth the perfect justice of god, and is laid in the balance to
waygh against the same for a wonderful value, a value of no less worth then
the welfar, and whole estate of every christian soul, that ever was, or ever
shall be imprisoned in the corrupt tabernacle of flesh and blood. Now, you not
contented to set down your whole rest upon the sufficiency of this
righteousness, either pull the same quite out of the balance, and put in
steed thereof your own, or at least lay yours upon his to make up the weight,
as though the other were sufficient: wherein what derogation you proffer to the
merit of christ's obedience, it is most manifest, the same being of it self so
absolute, and what madness you show therein may be wondered at, when al your
merits unto christ's, are [for substance] not a drop to the maine Ocean, and
[for waight] not so much as a feather, to the whole earth. The spirit of truth
that holy charmer himself will quickly resolve you herein, if [Adderlike] you
stop not your ears against him, as [methinks] you should not, howsoever you be
enjoined by man, because he always charmeth most wisely: Esaias, 63, 3
In one place Christ alone has trodden down the winepresse neither was there
any at all that helped him. God forbid that I should rejoice in any thing but in
the cross, Gala. 6, 14,
death and passion, of our Lord Jesus christ. The blood of Jesus christ the son
of God cleanses us from all sin. 1 Ioh, 1, 7
Now if christ aloue has trodden down that press that would have pressed us to
death: If we must rejoice in nothing, but only in the death of christ Jesus: If
the precious blood of that sweet savior of ours, does only cleanse us from all
our sins, what should we think of our selves, and of our works? What have we
to do, that of our selves are but worms of the earth in comparison? What have
our works to do, that of themselves are but mere unworthiness in the sight of
the almighty? What [I say] have we or our works to do in this high, and worthy
office of our salvation? It is already mercifully undertaken, by him that could
perform it for us: It is already happily performed by him that did undertake
it for us, and being so undertaken, and performed to our hands, what remains
now for us, but faithfully to believe in him that has done these wonders for
the children of men, and next of all holily to live in him, because he
commands us to be holy as he is holy; and were it but to express our
thankefulnes for such his unspeakable mercies toward us. Yet so to believe
and live in him, as that we never believe we can do any thing while we live
that shall worthy us to partake with him in the memorable act of our
salvation, or can have power [though issuing from the greatest perfection of
humain ability to merit the reward of eternal glory. For if we cold, then this
our blessed redeemer did put on the heavy garment of our humanity in vain, did
keep the commandments in vain, did sweat water, and blood in vain, did
want the privilege even of little sparrowes for his repose in vain, and
submitted himself to all his sufferinges from the Manger, which was his
cradle, to the cross, which was the conclusion of his misery, and all this he
underwent for our love in vain, if we be able to merit of our selus, if we have
holiness to make our own peace, for so he has done nothing for us, but what
we can do of our selves, which were a horrible and blasphemous conclusion: and
yet you see reasonably drawn from this your sacriligious and so derogatory
doctrine of merits.

And yet derogatory further, for it leaves not our Savior here, but
secondeth this injury of his redeemership with changing the nature of his
mediatorship: For what is a mediator amongst men, or christ as he is mediator
betwixt God and man, but a traveler, or one that interposeth himself between
several parties to make peace, between the offended, and the offender: The
party here offended is God, by reason of sin committed, the party offender
is man, that has committed this sin against him. God is perfectly just, and
will not be put off with shifts, but stands upon satisfaction. Man is a stark
bankerout, clean blown out, and has nothing wherewith to satisfy. O blessed
God that art so righteous in all thy works, and thrice blessed be thy holy
name, even for being so just that thou will be satisfied; but O cursed man that
was so wicked in his ways, as to forsake his gracious God, that had made him
so rich, and [when he might have chosen] to plunge himself in such extreme
poverty: Methinkes I see him soeing figge-leaues to cover his shame, and
shuddering himself behind trees, from the presence of the Almighty: methinks
I hear him answearing the Lord friuilously, and prating out excuses to no
purpose; for God that it is truth it self, and sees all things cannot be
deluded.

And yet methinks, lifting up my self, I see another arm of mercy extended
forth to save, as well as that arm of Justice to destroy: I see the Lord is
merciful, and gracious, long suffering, and of great goodness, that he will not
always be chiding, nor continue his anger for ever, that he deals not with his
servants after their sins, nor rewards them according to their wickedness.
In a word, which is my souls rauishing comfort, methinks I see his mercy
without impeachment to his Justice, to shine above al his works, for with this
arm of compassion he takes this sinner up, and even him himself thorough his
wisdom, and power deuiseth a means to satisfy himself, and restore again
the poor offender to his favor.

And now my sweet Savior, I must return again unto thee, for the needle of
my soul truly touched [I hope] with thy grace, will never stand still, till it
come directly against thy merit, the fixed point of my salvation.

When man by sin had thus separated himself from his maker, and the jaws of
eternal damnation [but a deserved guerdon] gaped wide to have swallowed him
up, at this dead lift Christ Jesus, (by whom all things formerly were made,)
comes to help out, and draw together again, his father and this offender,
that stood in such opposition; he undertakes to pay the debt, sets a
certain day, and keeps it, and requires nothing of this man, for whom thus
friendly he becam paimaister but before till the day came, to believe in him
that he would pay it: and after, when the day was past, to believe in him that
he had paid it, and before and after to love him for his labor, and observe
that course for his life [as near as he could] which he prescribed him. But
what is all this [saith the cauiller] to Christ's mediatorship: I might
answer, that it is but a profitable digression at most, but I will answer
it is no digression at all: For I assure you it is so pertinent, so necessarily
belonging thereunto, that if you know not this you know nothing, if you
perfectly conceive not this, you shall never thoroughly understand the other:
and now I beseech you learn to knit them together.

When christ the second person in the Trinity the very son of God, and yet
perfect God himself, had for the sufficient and more proper discharge of this
debt for man, which man by no means could have discharged for himself, assumed
our humanity, and thoroughly satisfied the wrath of God as aforesaid: In due
time he forsook the earth, and returned unto the blessed bosom of his father
from whence he came, and because he knew that man for all this kindness
showed him, would not be fully reclaimed, nor thoroughly purged during his
abode upon earth of that pernicious humor of disobedience that possessed him,
but still be prone to offend, and from time to time provoking his Lord and
maker to indignation against him: He there in heaven seated upon that
glorious throne of Majesty and power, the right hand of his Father,
continually entreats, presents satisfaction, and undertakes for him, I
mean his Servant that faithfully believe in him, and truly depend upon his
righteousness for their salvation, and therein I pray you conceive that his
mediatorshippe (as with God the party offended) does principally now consist; I
say in entreating, presenting satisfaction, and undertaking for us; For he
entreats his father to take pity of us, albeit we deserve it not, to love us
although we have not loved him, and to embrace us for his children
notwithstanding our disobedience toward him, and because being God as well as
man, in this his office of mediatorshippe, it concerns him to see the Justice
of God fully satisfied, before his mercy be thus thoroughly extended: In his
petition he compriseth effectual considerations to stir up compassion
toward us, namely in regard of his obedience and sufferinges in our steed,
for his righteousness sake, which he continually presents unto his father, as
a satisfaction for our sins, and prays that the same may be accepted for
us, and we for the merit thereof become acceptable and gracious in his sight
for ever: And lastly he undertakes that at length, we shall leave our sins, and
cease to offend his divine Majesty any more, that we shall truly honor him,
and become fit instruments to sound forth his praise and glory.

Now I beseech you mark how this doctrine of Christ's mediatorship, and your
doctrine of merits can stand together. Christ as a mediator intreteth his father
in our behalf, but if we do merit what need this entreaty, for God is just,
and of himself will reward the well deserving of every man to the full: Christ as
he is a mediator, presents satisfaction unto his father for our sins, but
if we do merit, that satisfaction might be spared, for God is just, and will not
be paid duble: christ as he is our mediator, undertakes for our innocence
herafter, but if we do merit, then belike we are innocent already, for none can
merit at gods hands that is absolute righteousness, but he that is absolutely
righteous, and so that part of christ's mediatorship would cease, for God is
just, and will have no security, for that hereafter which he has received
already: but what doctrine call you this? and yet such is your doctrine of
merits, and so derogating as you see from the holy mediatorship of christ
Jesus: If therefore you look for benifit by that mediatorship [as most
miserable is their condition that do not] you must lay by your own merit, which
is so thin a clothing, that the least drop of Gods indignation will drench
clean through it; and cloth your self with christ's merit, which will keep
you warm indeed, and be sure to hold out in all weather: for as christ came
from heaven into the world, not to call the righteous (they that think
themselves so) but the sinners [they that acknowledge themselves so] to
repentance. In like sort he returned not into heaven out of the world to
medyate for such pharasaicall iusticiaries, as rest upon their own integrity,
but for the humble dejected publicans, that with repentance acknowledge their
own unworthiness.

Furthermore I do not see, how it can be well maintained, but that it is in
some sort repugnant even to the office of the holy ghost likewise: for if the
same be to sanctify us to nevvnesse of life, and to give grows to our faith
from time to time, which taken at the best [as I am taught] stands in need
of increase: how can any works we do, which are the fruits of that faith, be
truly said to merit, considering it is a ground, that the effect must be
answerable to the cause, and the cause here which is our faith, being
desectiue, the effect which is our works cannot be perfect as necessarily
they must be, if they be meritorious: now tell me I pray you, whether any
heresy can be compact of grosser absurdities then this, be more prejudicial
then this, or the author of greater indignity even to the blessed Trinity, then
proceeds from this your heresy of merits: and yet which may be wondered at,
it finds professors and patrons more then a good many, and those sconfesse
not unlearned, but profoundly read in all knowledge that humane helps can
puff up their understanding with: but there is a knowledge that only one
scholmaister reueileth; a divine knowledge, a divine scholmaister, happy and
truly learned is that scholar, which is trained up in such knowledge, and
that is instructed (how unlearned soever he seem otherwise) by such a
scholemaister.

I am not altogether ignorant of the cunning distinctions, which your greatest
clerks devise for maintenance of this your merit, and how they will have their
merit of work, and merit of the person, the merit of congruity, and the merit
of condignity, and I know they will tell you, that there are diverse places of
scripture to uphold the same. But first let me tell you what a bold offer, a
good fellow of our church once made to the contrary, he that can show me [saith
he] in any scripture that works do merit, or be any means to our
justification, for the first scripture, without any further judgment I will
loose both mine ears; for the second, my tongue, for the third my neck; but
the issue was, they accepted of his ears, his tongue, and his neck, without
performing the condition, for no such place in all the whole scripture could be
found; and yet was he pitifully martyred amongst them, poor soul, nay rich
soul rather, for who can be richer then he, by whom even the house of God is
enriched, and it is the saying of a learned father, that the blood of the
martyr is the seed of the Church: I confess there are many sayings in the
book of god, that at the first sight, and being not thoroughly waighed, do
seem to import such a matter, as where it is said that every man shall receive
according to his labor: your reward is great in heanen; he will render to
every man according to his works. From these and such places, your doctors
would draw invincible arguments that good works, because God has promised to
reward them, do therefore merit that reward so promised, but there is no
necessity of that consequent; our good works indeed shall receive reward, but
not because they merit the same: for the finest has his stain, and the best
work that man can do is blemished: but in regard that God of his own free
grace and mercy, without respect to any worthynesse in the work at all, has
promised to reward them, who being ever faithful, will ever be as good as his
promise, and show himself in all things to deal with his servants that
truly depend upon his mercy, far better then after their best deseruings. And
that our works deserve not this reward, christ that is the paymaister
himself, by his prophets, his Apostles, Doni, 9.38
by himself tells us plainly, We do not [saith the prophet] present or
supplications before thee, Romans 3, 27
for our own righteousness but for thy great tender mercies: your rejoicing
[saith the apostle] is excluded by the law of faith. Luke 37 10.
When ye have don all (says christ) say, we are unprofitable servants. The
reverent fathers and and learned Doctors of the church are copyous, and do
flow in their obsernations, upon these and such like places of holy write, to
drown the barren plot of man's merits, and bring in greater estimation, the
Aeden soil of christ's righteousness where all true merits grow, and whence the
riches even of heaven it self are to be gathered: but because I have already
partly cited them upon the same subject, and my letter begins with prolixity to
try the patience even of a friendly reader: I will only present you with a
little nosegaie of four or five flowers out of their several Gardens, which
[although for have they be not curiously tied together] will nevertheless I
doubt not yield your soul, a sweet and delectable sent, if you neglect them
not, and with a conceit of their unworthiness cast them not behind you.

This is the only perfection of men if they know themselves to be imperfect.
Hier, aduer, Pelag. Augustine in manualy ca, 22


All my hope is in the death of my Lord: His death is my merit, my refuge,
salvation life, and resurrection; my merit is the compassion of my Lord.

Let us hope for forgiveness of our sins as of faith in christ, and not of
debt as due for any merit. Ambrose lib. 2. ad Poeniten, c 8


Every man shall be rewarded according to his works, but not for his works.
Gregory in Ps^. 1, 4, 2 Barnardde liber. arbitr,


To speak properly of those works which we call our merits, they are but the
seede-plats of hope, the tokens of our predestination, the presagers of our
future happiness, the way to the kingdom, not the cause of reigning there: To
conclude whom God has justified, not those whom he found just, he has
glorified.

I will make up this posie with one flower more out of the Garden of the said
S. Bernard which I know you will hold dear for her sake whose name is written
upon it, whom you esteem to be [and while you say no other wise of her I will
say with you] the most blessed Virgin that ever bare life. Bar. Scr. 1 Anunt. ma
Let them [saith S. Bernard] seek for merit that list, It is best for us to
study to find grace, then he shows this reason, for Mary stands not upon
her merit but seeks grace.

Now, if the Virgin Mary whom you make no less then a Goddess, whom you call
the Queen of heaven, the Queen of the world, and mother of grace and virtue;
whom you account a general advocate for all Gods servants upon the earth,
whom you invoke every day, whose honor you celebrate at eight solemn feasts
every year, and to whom you give power to command Christ her son, and to
command him by the authority of a Mother. For all which [and did you heap as
many more glittering titles together, as there are Stars in the firmament] I
am persuaded she will never give you thanks, for she loves her son, her
Lord, her God, too well, to take unto her self any thing that is due unto him,
or to smile upon those that shall rob him of his honor, and give it to any
other, though it be to her self: If she [I say] as Saint Bernard affirms,
pretends not her own merit, but rests upon the grace and mercy of God her
Savior: What do you think it best for you to do? You acknowledge your self
I know inferior to her, in works, in grace, and every way; yet be not
contrary to her in works, or grace, or any way: forsake not the grace of GOD,
which is all in all, to fly ynto your own merit, which is nothing, for then
you are contrary to her; but forsake the merit of your own works, that has
no solidity in it, and fly unto the grace of God in Christ, that is powerful
to save your soul, and so you are not contrary to her, for then she becomes
your happy president, she is therein under the blessed spirit, your gracious
School mistres.

You little thought [I dare answer for you] that any opinion she had held [at
least in such a material point of saluation] had been contrary, or so much as
repugnant to the doctrine, which is established in the church of Rome: For as
you have bone taught, that she was without sin, because she bare the savior of
the world, so are you borne in hand, that the said doctrine is without error,
because it is established by those that cannot err. But eronious are they that
whisper these things in your ears, and simple are you that lend such listening
thereunto, for God has taught both them and you another lesson, Galat 3, 22
namely that the scripture has concluded all [not excluding the virgin Mary]
under sin: And that every man (not excepting the Pope) is a liar. Romans 3, 4
But to touch these points otherwise then by the way, you might think were by
the purpose. The matter in hand is merit of works, and I hope I have
sufficiently indeared the contrary doctrine unto you. Howbeit, that potent
objection of yours [as you take it] that because God has promised such a
reward unto us, if we do good works, therefore our good works deserve that
reward: I will avoid another way by discovering the untruth thereof by a plain,
and familiar example.

Suppose I pray you, that an earthly king should say to one of his ordinary
servants, do such a thing, and I will give thee such an Earldom for thy
labor: and that this servant when he has performed that which was commanded
him (although the same belonged to his place] and that he stood bound to do
it before, should [notwithstanding] expect this great reward from the King,
as being due unto him for the little pain he had taken, and as though the very
doing of that small matter had deserved it. What would you think of such a
servant? would you think him well in his wits? or at least well worthy of such
advancement, I know you would not, but rather judge him an unthankful body,
and hold it pity that such preferment should be bestowed upon one, that
would so abuse his masters bounty. Say you so? Why then [although I am no
prophet as Nathan was] I may take you as Nathan took David in your own
answer, and say unto you, Thou art the party. God has commanded you to do
good works, and yet no other then belong unto your calling, and such as by the
band of your election, creation, redemption, and adoption, [I hope and judge
the best of you] you are bound unto, and for the doing thereof, he promises
you the reward of eternal glory. Now admit you do these good works, as God
commands you, and when you have done them, think that for the merit
thereof, you may expect your reward proposed, are you not with the aforesaid
servant very unthankful? Do you not utterly mistake the matter, and
attribute that unto your own merit, which is due unto Gods mercy?
Questionless you do, then how much more are you to be blamed, that having not
done those works that the Lord commands you, but being [at the best] an
unprofitable servant, shall [notwithstanding] in lieu [as I may say] of your
own unworthiness, and for the merit of that which you left undone, look for
the reward of eternal felicity.

I will accompany this example, [for the conclusion of the point, and because I
would come home, even to the shallowest capacity] with three natural reasons of
impossibility, that you, or the godliest that lives upon the earth, should
merit salvation, as you and all that live after the doctrine of the church of
Rome have bin, and are continually misinstructed. The first reason is, the huge
and wonderful debt that you already owe unto God, at whose hands you think to
merit, and of whom you must confess comes all salvation. Indeed, were you a
clear ground with him, did you owe him nothing, but had condignly requited him
for all the pleasures he has done you, and satisfied him for all the trepasses
you have done unto him: Then happily there might be some color for such an
ability in you, then were the grossenes of the opinion not all so palbable. But
being so deeply indebted unto him, I cannot particularize wherein, but would
have you conceive it thus, for all that you are, for all that you have
received, that you have not deserved, and for all that you have not received,
that you have deserved: All this being upon your score already, amounting [were
it truly told] to ten thousand Talents at least, every minute increasing, and
no means in you to clear the same: how can you think to merit ought of him, to
whom you stand thus engaged? Is not all and more by much then you are able to
do by the considerations aforesaid, due unto him? How then is it possible,
that the uttermost thing you can do, [when the uttermost is not so much as
you are bound to do] should be merritorious with him, and so merritorious, as
to purchase of him everlasting salvation: you may assure your self, were there
no other reason, but this only of the debt you owe him, and cannot pay him,
that it is impossible.

The second reason is that your works, admit that they sprang from true faith,
which must give them virtue, and worthy them the title of good works, are not
properly your own, but Gods, and therefore it is impossible you should deserve
your salvation by them: for can you think to merit such a matter at the hands
of God, for giving him that which of right belongs unto him, and for
presenting him but with the fruit of his own vineyard; you have no foundation
whereon to ground any such an opinion: but Methinkes you take it very
strangely, that the good works you do, should not be your own, and that
without proof thereof, you will not so easily be persuaded thereunto. The holy
apostle, and learned father, S Paul and S. Austin, shall justify the same
unto you; Phi, 2, 13
The one tells you that it is God, [not your selfe] which works in you, not
the will only, but both the will and the deed: and in another place says unto
you, as though he were angry with you for arrogating any goodness unto your
self, To: 4: 7 Augustine Tract. 3 in Ioh.
What have thou that thou have not received? The other [I meane] S. Austin
assures you that god crowns not you but his own gifts or graces which hehath
given you, rewards not your good works, but his own good works in you.
Seeing then your works whereby you hope to merit are not properly your own
but belonging unto God, to whom you offer the same, you must needs confess
that by this reason likewise, it is impossible you should deserve ought at the
hand of God, much less merit according to the doctrine of your church your
own salvation.

My last reason of impossibility is, the disproportion betwixt the work you
do, and the reward you hope to acquire for doing the same; for if you will
receive one thing in lieu of another, if your deseruings must gain you the
blessings of eternal life, It is necessary that those merits of yours which
you bring unto God, be insome sort of equal value, or near in worth to the
benifits which you are to receive from him; But do you know what comparison
there is betwixt gold, and dross, the difference betwixt light and darkness,
or what proportion there can be, betwixt perfection and imperfection; such a
comparison, such difference, such and no nearer a proportion there is betwixt
the greatest desert of the holiest saint upon the earth, and the least reward,
[if there be a difference of rewardes] bestowed upon the saints in heaven; For
the joys of heaven are [as I know you will confesse] absolutely perfect,
insinite, and incomprehensible: and you must understand that the works of the
regenerate, such as we call, and do best deserve the title of good works,
although as they issued from the pure sountaine of gods grace they be
perfectly clear, and untainted, yet passing along through the furred pipes of
the corrupted wiland understanding of man, they loose some part of their
native purity, and proceed from him defiled and poluted. I may therefore
conclude it impossible, that the one being so imperfect, should merit the other
of such infinite perfection.

Further sayings I might allege to the same effect, and make those that I
have alleged [if need were] by familiar instance more perspicuously to
appear unto you. But that which I have already said to the point, is either
sufficient, or all that I can devise to say, would be to no purpose: I have
proved unto you that this doctrine of merits taught in your church is against
the doctrine established in christ's church; And by no less pregnant reasons
then because the apostle flatly condemns it, because the fathers utterly
disclaim from it, because those excellent, and infinite proprieties of God,
his mercy and justice, are therein obscured, the holy and blessed offices of
christ his redeemership, and mediatorship thereby infringed, that catholic
doctrine of the holy ghost increasing our faith, and renewing us to newness of
life, through the same (in some sort) impugned, and finally because it is
repugnant even to common sense, and reason, and stands not with any
possibility.

I will stir no further into the errors, nor rip up any more absurdities of
your religion: But for the present, with my earnest and most instant desire
importune you, without preiudicate opinion, without foreconceipting (after
probabilities) my insufficiency, to speak substancially to matters of this
nature: that you would subdue your self to a serious and indifferent
consideration of that which I have said, against this one only opinion of your
religion. Show your self a skillful artist heerin, and like the exquisite
Geometrician, that by the foot of Hercules, was able to deliniate the true
shape of his whole body, so by this one point only of man's merit, I pray
learn iudiciously to observe what the whole substance is like to be of that
which you call your catholic religion. For if this one member [as you see the
Apostle, and fathers have given Iudgement] be rotten, what soundness can you
assure your self to find in the other parts that make up the body of your
profession: if the doctrine of this point be so prejudicial to the mercy and
instice of God your maker, so detractory from the redeemership, and
mediatorship of Christ your savior, so repugnant to the office of the holy
ghost your sanctifier, and finally so impossible: What infecting errors, nay
what soule-bane heresies, can the doctrine of all the other points of your
religion be free from.

There is an answerable proportion betwixt this and the rest: Or if it fail,
it is in this degree, because many of the other points have not that color of
maintenance out of the scriptures, as this point of merits is vpheld by: For
I confess, there were sundry places which upon the first show, and not well
examined, did seem a supportation for this opinion: but there are diverse
other points of your religion, which have not so much as any literal show of
countenance by the word of God: but are enforced to fly from the same, to
crouch under the protection of Traditions, and Decretals, and beg their defense
from the warrant of such human authority: so that in this regard the doctrine
of most of the other points of your religion seems to be less justifiable,
howsoever, yet full as unsound, and as little deserving to be trusted unto, as
this of the merit of your works in the act of your justification: but I
promised [if I had not, I am compelled] to insist upon no other particular, and
I hope it were needless, for I doubt not but that which I have said touching
this one point only, has made you in some sort to distaste the rest, and
wrought in you at least, a sensible feeling of your souls insirmity.

NOw it remains that after that poor skill I have I prescribe you some whole
some course, 5. Sect.
whereby this your dangerous maladye may be cured. For he may be a cunning, but
cannot be a kind Physician, that having discoursed unto his patient, [though
but in part] the nature of her disease, and laid open unto her [insome
measure] the dangerous estate she is in, shall then presently leave her to her
self, and regardlesse of her recovery, afford her no further comfort: To
avoid therefore that imputation, which I would be loath by you, or any else,
in this or any other experiment should deservedly be laid upon me: and to
observe the method I prescribed unto my self in the beginning, I will first
impart unto you what the medicine is, that necessarily you must take. Secondly,
some part of those infinite and unspeakable benefits, which you shall receive
in taking it. Thirdly, the means whereby you must take it. And lastly, what
little charge it will stand you in, and how cheap the taking of it, will be
unto you: But because my allowance of time is spent, and your patience I fear
to sore pressed, I will huddle up this which is behind, and rather omit
something that I could say, then be taxed for containing my self within no
compass,

In a word then, this medicine is a true and sincere faith in the
righteousness of Christ Jesus. This faith [if you remember) I have formerly
defined, and plainly laid down unto you all the causes, and some of the effects
thereof. It shall suffice in this place only to tell you that it is, A
special and perfect assurance that we are partakers of the merit of Christ's
righteousness, and that by the same righteousness only satisfaction is made
unto God for all our offenses, and our salvation purchased. This is that
wholesome receipt, which I would minister unto you, and this you may be bold to
take, for it will be sure to cure your soul, I gage mine own upon it, not
only of that pestilent Gangrena, the merit of works, but of all other
imperfections, that now do, or shall hereafter threaten the ruin thereof.
This only might be a sufficient motive, to stir up your desire, to the taking
of it.

But to make you more eager, understand more particularly the benefits that you
shall reap by the same, It will make you that which you so long to be, A saved
soul in heaven, So Saint Paul assures you. Ephe, 1, 1 Luke 6.20
It will procure you that which you so feign would have, Forgiveness of all
your sins, So Saint Luke assures you. It will procure you that whereunto all the bravery and felicity of the earth, is trash and beggary. Praise, honor,
and glory at the joyful appearing of Christ Jesus. 1 Peter. 1 Chap, 7
And so Saint Peter himself, whom I know you will believe, assures you:
Through this, you shall have free access to the grace of God, which will make
you eternally happy. Through this you shall rejoice in all your tribulations,
which otherwise would make you unhappy, and through this like those doubty
soldiers of Christ that have led you the way, you shall show your self a
valiant champion, and overcome the world: This will be a Supersedeas unto you,
not only against the eternal death, [as is already proued] but against the
temporal death likewise, for the believer, (although he seem to be dead) is
alive, as the unbeliever, [although he seem to be alive is dead: God gives
[saith one] such grace and privilege to faith, that death, which of his own
nature is the privation of life, does thereby become the entrance into life.
This is that happy star which will lead you directly to that house where the
king of glory has his habitation: Nay what will you say if the virgin Mary,
was not more happy for bearing the blessed body of our Savior, then you shall
be by possessing this faith, whereby, [as by the instrumental cause] you must
be saved: you think this a hard saying, as the capernaits thought that of
christ's, yet Saint Augustine infers no less, for these are his words, Mary
was more blessed in receiving the faith of Christ, then she was in conceiving
the flesh of Christ.

The last benefit of faith that I will propose unto you, [omitting many which I
know, and acknowledging infinite which I know not] is, that thereby your works
will become good works, at least accepted for good, and from the least to the
greatest, receive their reward. Whereas, without the said faith, there is no
virtue in them, they taste no more in gods mouth, then the white of an Egg does
in man's, they please him not, for without faith it is impossible to please him:
and indeed they are no better then sins, for (as I have said) whatsoever is
not of faith, is sin. I know you think your works are good already, and better
by many degrees then mine, and me therefore an unfit schoolma. to read a lectur
there of unto you. I refer that unto him, who has the balance in his hand, and
humbly throw down mine, such as they are at the footstool of his mercy,
confessing that many of the^ are such as I have cause to be ashamed of, and the
best of them not so good as I long they were, and hope they will be: but to
make you look with a single and no such indulgent eye upon your own,
Understand that every good work must necessarily have these two ends, Faith,
and the glory of God: faith is the end from whence it must proceed, The glory
of God is the end whereunto it must be directed Now if the work want either of
these ends, it is not a good work, yours, want them both, for they cannot
proceed from faith, which attributes salvation wholly to the merit of christ's
righteousness, while you think that they in any degree, are meritorious of
themselves, neither can they be directed to gods glory, when the principal
matter, whereat you aim in doing them, is your own advantage. Now you must
conceive further, that these two ends of good works faith and Gods glory are
inseparable. So that do your works from faith, and you cannot choose but do
them to Gods glory, and you shall be sure (though you do them not in hope of
reward) to receive reward for doing them.

The means whereby you must attain unto this faith, is earnest prayer,
according to christ's prescription, and attentive hearing of the word of God.
Touching the first, let me tell you that God many times seems to defer the
giving of his blessings, even those blessings, which from al eternity he has
determined to give, until they be sought for, and begged at his hands by
prayer. I will instance this only in our father Isaac, to whom when God, to
expel his sorrovv, for his dear deceased mother, had given the comfort of a
fair and loving wife, yet he gave not issue, [ Rebecka was a good while
barren] until such time as he betook himself to prayer for the same, and then
the Lord was entreated of him, and his wife conceived: I doubt not but God had
ever purposed, that at that very moment, she should conceive, yet to teach
us how acceptable our prayers are unto him, and how it pleases him by the
means thereof to convey our necessaries unto us, the text says, The Lord was
entreated of him, and Rebecka his wife conceived, Gen, 25.23
as though if Isaac had not prayed she should not have conceived, if you
please to make use hereof, you may thus think that God for ought you know
has determined that your soul shall not become fruitful, nor conceive and
bring fourth this faith, until you beg the same of him by earnest prayer, and
that then, because he is still the same God he will be entreated, and your soul
shall be conceived both of this faith and all other needeful graces that
acompany the same to your eternal comfort.

The other means to get faith is the hearing of Gods word, for faith comes by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The Samaritans upon the report of a
woman partly believed in christ, and thought that it might be he whom they
expected; but when they had heard him themselves then they thoroughly believed,
and knew that he was that savior which was promised. You have been told much
of christ who is the foundation of faith by those that have conferred most
with you about spiritual affairs, and something in this my letter you have
heard of him. But did you hear him your self speak, I mean, did you read
the scriptures which are his own words, and hard them read and expounded, by
those which are his faithful ministers; O then you would [I hope] not almost,
but altogether become a christian; then would you not partly but wholly believe
in him that dyed for you; then would your faith be no longer wavering, but
thoroughly confirmed.

For how could you choose but be strengthened in your belief of him, when you
should be acquainted withal the things he did, and endured for your sake? how
could you choose but be ravished in affection, and with the true church be sick
of love, when you should hear him call you (notwithstanding all your unkind
dealing toward him) his Sister, his love, his spouse, his dove, Solo, song ch,
4, 9. ver 9.1.9, ch, 6, 8. ch, 6.8
and his undefiled. It makes my heart bleed to think how you and many
thousands, [such seely seduced innocents] are deprived of these, and infinite
other such like heavenly and inexpressible consolations. And all for the want
of this word of God, which you suffer to belocked up from you, and wherewith
[though it must import you] you are least acquainted, christ's caveat shall be
the conclusion of this point, He that has ears to hear let him hear.

Lastly understand how cheap this faith will be unto you. In a word, it will
neither cost you travel nor money, It will cost you no travel, for you need
but hear the voice of christ, when he cries unto you, and open the door of
your heart unto him when he knocks thereupon by his word, and you shall
receive it, Revel. 3.20
behold [saith christ] I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my
voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him and will sup with him, and
he with me: It will cost you no money, for you need but do as the King of
heavens proclamtion directs you, and it shall be given you freely: Esai, 55.2
Ho every one [saith the prophet [ that thirsts come ye to the waters, (which
are the sacred scriptures, containing Gods reueiled counsel) and ye that have
no Silver come buy and eat, come I say and buy wine and milk without silver,
and without money; And these are nothing but faith, and the holy graces that
acompany the same, which are as necessary, for the nourishment of the soul as
Wine and Milk and such like meat is, for the refection of the body.

THus, having [as I have bin compelled] poasted through these later parts; 6.
Sect.
namely what the medicine is that you must take, faith: the benifits you shall
receive thereby felicity in this world, and in the world to come: After what
sort you must get the same, By prayer and hearing Gods word: And lastly, how
little this inestimable Jewel will cost you, Neither traueil nor money: and
being circulerly now returned to the word of god, these waters of comfort which
at first be sprinkled the front of my letter, let me entreat you, and by no
less important regardes, then for the love you bear to your own soul, which
must needs be dear unto you, and for the love and zeal you carrye to the
glory of God, which should be dearer unto you; that your ever ently unclasp
his holy book, diligently peruse the same, and day and night even
continually, make the contents thereof, [with holy Dauid] your sweet and
profitable Meditation: if you will not read it at my request, yet let me
request you to observe that wonderful description whereby the Apostle, even to
inflame you with the love thereof commends the same unto you, The word of God
[saith he] is lively and mighty in operation, Hebr, 4, 12
and sharper then any two edged sword, and enters through even unto the
dividing asunder of the spirit and the iontes, and the marow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. To this commendation of
the apostle, I will adioyne the commandment that God himself gives you
touching the same, Deuteronomy. xi, 18 19 20
in these very words, Therefore ye shall lay up these my words in your heart,
and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be
as a frontlet beeweene your eyes, and you shall teach them your children,
speaking of them when thou sit in thine house, and when thou walk by the
way, and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up, and thou shall write
them upon the posts of thine house, and upon thy gates.

This is the commandment of Gods own mouth unto you; But alas, how do you
perform the same? How can you lay his words up in your heart? How can you
make such a Jewel of them, when you neither read them, nor hear them read
unto you? Surely that is the cause of all, for as an ancient father said of
the Heretics valentiniani, Ireneus cont, valentianos,
that their ignorance in the Scriptures, had brought them to that pass. So
questionless may I conclude, that your neglect of the word which would be a
Lantern unto your feet and a light unto your paths, is the reason that you
are thus missed in blindness, and so seduced with error and superstition.

And this your ghostly adversary is well acquainted with, for he knows that
unless you read or hear the word of God, you can never as the blessed mother
of christ did, treasure up the same in your heart to your eternal enrich meant:
he knows you can hardly believe a right with those honest women of Boeriae
unless as they did, you first receive the word with readiness, whereby true
relief is begotten: yea he knows by his long experience, that where the word
is not preached, the people for the most part perish, and therefore where it is
neither preached, nor read, nor regarded, his kingdom must needs flourish,
which makes him so to bestir himself by his unhallowed ministers amongst you;
so to discountnance the word unto you and so with their false suggestions to
discourage you from the reading of it, in calling it with their blasphemous
mouths, imperfect, doubtful, insufficient, but a dead letter, and even like a
nose of wax, subject to any impression: and in telling you that by the reading
thereof diverse have become Heretics, howsoever, yet that it is impossible by
such as your self to be conceived: But believe them not, no more then you
would believe their master the father of lies, even falsehood it self if you
saw it unmasked: For you may be assured that the word of God is perfect, pure,
and undefiled, and that albeit some places in the scripturs be obscure, yet
[generally] they give understanding to the simple, and are [as Iraeneus saith]
Plain without doubtfulnesse, Iraeneus lib. 1. cap, 31 Gregorius ^^epist, id
Leand^u^.
and may be heard indifferently of all men. Therein is milk and proper
nutriment, even for the tendrest babe that ever lay in the lap of the church,
It is a water [saith Gregory] wherein the little lamb [such as your selfe] may
wade, and the mighty Elephant [meaning the learned ones] may swim, which Saint
Augustine likewise affirmed, saying that almighty God in the scriptures
speaks as a familiar friend without dissimulation, Augustine Epist 3. ad
Volusianu^
not to the learned only, but both to the learned and unlearned. And with these
holy fathers of the church, the rest generally accord herein, inuiting by
their strongest persuasions, all sorts of people, the ignorant with the wise,
the learned and unlearned, together to repair hither for their instruction,
and from hence, as touching the discharge of their christian Office, both
toward God and manto fetch their absolute direction. This may give you
occasion to wonder what your Priests mean so perimptorily to interdict you
the use of the holy scriptures, when the learned Fathers, [whom notwithstanding
they will impudently challenge to be wholly theirs,] were never heard in that
tune, but ever taught the contrary: the reason hereof is easily gathered, they
know that the word of God being absolutely truth, must needs, were you
acquainted with it, discover their falshoode unto you. They know that the
nature of it being to give light, it would quickly expel that Caemerian
darkness, wherewith your sense is so inveloped, and by means whereof they lead
you blindfolded into their den of I dolatrie, and abomination at their
pleasure, they know that then you would soon perceive their Iuggling, and
that thereby you would plainly discern them in their propper colors: Let them
pretend therefore what they will, but this chiefly is the cause, Tertullian
in libro, de Trinit. chrisostom in opere imperfectio, Ho, 14
for as Tertullian says. The sacred scriptures do convince and discover the
guiles of Haeretickes, which Chrysostom likewise observed when he said,
Heretic priests shut fast the gates of the truth, meaning they conceal the
word of God from the people: Because they know that if the truth appear,
they must of necessity forsake their church, I advise therefore to forsake
their Counsel herein, and will propose unto you, for an excellent pattern of
imitation, those godly Sisters in christ which accompanied that Religious Paul
at Bethlem, Hierom in Epitaph, Paulae
who by the testimony of Hierome, accounted it unlawful to to be ignorant in
the Psalms, and spent not one day without learning something out of the
Scriptures. And that virtuous Gorgonia; whom her brother the good Nazianze in
his Funeral oration over her, commends for being expert both in the old and
new testament, let these holy virgins, and blessed handmaids of Christ be your
president, go hand in hand with them, as will best become you, and most redound
to your advantage, unto this sacred Fountain of Gods word, this holy well
indeed, instead of your extraordinary unsanctified Sai. Winifreds: For hereof
you may drink your sill, and have your thirst quenched, heerewith you may wash
your self, and have your leprosy cleansed, herin your soul [for that is the
proper virtue of it] may find an heavenly solace, and be converted. Forsake I
say their doctrine, herein, Nay forsake and abandon both the^ and their
doctrine, them as no ministers of christ, their doctrine as mere Antichristian:
Forth Ministers of christ deliver with Paul no other doctrine save that which
they have received of christ: but they teach you the quite contrary, as in
forbidding you to read the scriptures, when christ commands you to read
them. Search the scriptures says christ, Io. 5, 3, 9
search them not say they. They tell you that the reading of them would drive you
into error: Mar. xii. 29
But christ tells you, that your error grows because you read them not. Is
not here a plain opposition betwixt christ and them, his doctrine and theirs?
What reckoning then should you make of them: The Apostle teleth you, that if a
very Angel should come from heaven, and preach unto you such doctrine as this,
so different from that which he and the other apostles have preached, you
should be so far from believing him, as rather to hold him accursed.

Surely these fellows are such, as our careful and loving shephearde gives us
that friendly caveat to take heed of. ^^^, 7.15, 16
Beware [saith he] of false prophets, which come to you in sheep clothing,
[vnder the color of holiness and innocence, but this is the outward man only,
For inwardly they are ravening Wolves. And the means whereby you may distinguish
them from the true Ministers of christ is this: Ye shall know them by their
fruits. And here I might take occasion, to give you a further taste of the
fruits of your religion, namely of the doctrine, and conversation which your
Popes, cardinals, Priests, Jesuits, and others generally of your church, from
their instruction and tolleration, have taught and practiced, whereby after the
rule of our savior in knowing the tree by the fruit, you might the more
plainly perceine your church, which you are so confidently persuaded, is the
true church of christ, to be no other then the very Synagogue of Satan. But it
is too spacious a field for me to pace through, it were the task rather of a
man's life, a subject for a mighty volume. To omit therefore their doctrine and
life in general, I will lay before you one only instaunce hereof, which by
the argument of our Savior, being fruit so rotten and ilsauery, must of
necessity, [you may be assured] spring from a root as bitter and corrupted.

Observations upon the late discovered Treasons.
AND I will not look back to former times, 7. Sect.
nor travel foreign countries for the accident, It is that hotrible and
inhuman conspiracy, bred and fostered in the bosom of your religion, and of
late by the providence and sweet mercy of our god, so blessedly discovered and
defeated. A conspiracy against the sayrest, against the Lord, and against his
anointed. And may I not say against all the souls of Israel, that bare true
faith, and true allegiance to God and their sovereign? For all them, should
have felt the force of that terrible blow, that was threatened, and in some
degree or other pertaked of the Tragedy, A Tregedy whereunto althe tragedies of
the world, begin with that of Abell, and come along all ages, to the last that
drank of that cup in our own memory would have given place, and for horror,
monstrosisme, and true essential diuelishnesse, could not have bin compared.
Which would have made all the bloody villains, that ever breathed, better, or
at least less thought upon, because the cogitations of all the me^ in these
parts of the earth would only have bin cast thereupon, as they are partly already
but with the same of the intention: No, the like Tragedy was never acted, nor
[I thinke] by the most absolute incarnate Devil ever before plotted, A plot
[as Lauid] speaks, to have rooted us out so many thousads, yea millions
within this kingdom, that we should have been no more a people, and that the
very name of a Protestant [vnlesse in byword] should have been no more in
remembrance, as [indeede] had they [acording as they proiected] made that
hauock of them altogether, his sacred Majesty, our gracious Queen, the
hopeful Prince, and all those holy and worthy ones, their attendants, it had
not been altogether improbable.

But this while you will say I prove not [as I vndertooke] that this
conspiracy, which most of you, (with your tongues at least) will confess, was
wicked, and unjustifiable, to be the fruits of your religion, or any instance
of your life and doctrine: for the clearing whereof can I deal more plainly,
then out of your own mouth as it were to judge you, or produce better proofs
then the positions and conclusions of your own clerks, and greatest divines
approving and maintaining, that in some cases it is lawful for subjects, to
rise up in arm, against their King, and that the deposing of an Heretic
prince such as they take our King to be is a commendable work and meritorious.

Understand therefore that Allen, Baines, Saunders, Parsons, creswell,
Reynoles, Tollet, Tellarmine, with others on whose shoulders as upon so many
arch-pillers your church of Rome has for this many years been supported have
taught and published the said doctrine, as appears in their several writings,
whereof some few are collected in this book entitled, An exact, discovery of
romish doctrine in case of conspirasie and rebellion by pregnant observations,
which heerewith I have sent you, or purpose to give you a better view of their
horrible doctrine not herein only but touching other matters likewise which
may instly occasion you to abandon them, and detest their courses for ever: and
that this conspiracy may be taken as an instance of their life likewise, who
can make doubt, when they themselves should have been the performers thereof,
when the plotters, actors, abetrers, and all that should have washed their
hands in that bloody bas^n, were Papists, devoted to your church, and such as
you call Catholics. It is therefore [questionlesse] an instance of their life
and doctrine the proper fruits of their Religion: yea, yea, it is a babe of
their own begetting every ynch of it: And though they search each corner of
their wit to shift it off and father it upon others, yet shall it always be
reputed theirs, They shall ever be enforced to keep it, and be are it upon
their backs as a notorious badge of their fornication, and a durable monument
of their shame, whiles the world indureth: yet is it worthy observation, to
note what poor devises they have, and what iniserable shifts they are driven
unto, I mean your Priests and Ihesuites and such as you most depend upon, and
are chiefly directed by, to daube up the matter [if they could] at least to
preserve their estimation awhile amongst you, and (though it lie a dying) to
linger it out as long as is possible. But to omit the rest, I will only
mention that which seems their final refuge, and serves them for the best
shelter to bear of the force off this imputation. They maintain, that
although the conspirators were all of them professed to the Church of Rome, yet
that it was not the doctrine of that church, but ambition, coffeehouse, and
desperate estate, that drew them thereunto; for their doctrine gave warrant for
no such courses, and that without question the Popes holiness could never be
touched therewith. To the former point I have already answered, and proved
unto you by the Testimony of their most famous and profoundest divines, that it
is the doctrine of their church, and therefore by all likelihood they received
their protection thence, and it was that, which gave them their chief
encouragment. Now whether the Pope [whom you call the head of your church] were
privy to the damnable purpose of these all-bloody miscreants, this worse then
Catilniary crew of conspirators, whom it cannot be denied were members thereof,
I know not; howbeit, the regard of simpathy betwixt the head and the members,
together with consideration that the greatest part of the prize in all
likelihood would have fallen to his share, may seem a substantial ground for
a suspicion: But this I dare say, that if he were not acquainted with the
plot, nor would have aplauded it, if he had been; but bears a mind opposite
to such deseignes, he is an honester man then some of his predecessors have
been. Witness the letter which N. the Cardinal of Como sent unto Parry, for
the murdering of our dear deceased Sovereign of famous memory, Queen
Elizabeth to this effect.

Sir the Popes holiness has perused your letter, and cannot but commend your
good disposition, and resolution, which (as you say) tends to the public
benefit; wherein his holiness exhorts you to persist, and to effect that
which you promise. And because you may be the better assisted by that good
spirit which has induced you to this, his blessedness grants you full
pardon and forgiveness of all your sins as you desired; assuring you, that
besides the merit which you receive in heaven, his holiness will become a
further debtor to acknowledge your deseruings in the best sort he may. And the
rather for that you use so great modesty in pretending nothing. Put therefore
in execution your honorable and holy thoughts, and look to your safety. And
so I present my self heartily unto you, and wish you all good and happy
success: From Rome the thirty of January 1584.

Yours to dispose N. Cardinal of Como.


If this letter will not fatisie you, that your Popes have approved such bloody
courses, take notice I pray you how Pope Gregory the ninth made a decree,
Decretum Greg. 9 cause. 23
that any man might renounce, and imbrewe his hands in the blood of his
kinsinan, his son, his father, or whomsoever without destinction, in case he
were an Heretic, [as al were adjudged that professed not papistry.] And how
Pope Sextus quintus, took upon him the Office of an orator, and in a public
and premeditated speech before all his cardinals, extolled to the skies, that
Wicked Monk, which so murdered Henry the third, King of France, commending
the murder for a notable, rare, and merueilous piece of work, condemning the
murdered, as an unfortunate king dying in his sin, and bestowing no worse a
title then Religious man, upon the villain that was the murderer. And lastly,
Bulla (...).
how Pope Pius quintus practiced the death of our said Queen Elizabeth, and
sent his Bull for that purpose, importing as follows: It is our will and we
comm^und; that the subjects of England take themselves to arms against
Elizabeth their Queen.

In these few mirrors, the eye that is not utterly blind may plainly discern,
whether your Popes be compact of nothing but fanctety, and integrity, as they
are continually described unto you, and how their hearts cleaning fast to the
former grounds, rest affected in such a case of murdering princes, and
incitinge their subjects to rebellion: This seems then a weak sh^l^er but
shame must have a cover, though it be but of fig leaves.

I could [methinkes] out of the bowels of christian charity, from my heart
deplore, that they who profess the true service of God, and in some sort call
upon the name of Jesus, should so far degenerate from the nature of a
christian, as to plot, and prosequte to the period, such a monstrous and
devilish deseign, as the heart of the most irreligious, and hardest-frozen
Atheist would have trembled at, and the worst of those barbarous Seythian
bloud-suckers, could not but have abhorred. Which the idolatrous Turk, and all
wicked Ethnicks will for ever [I think] as an argument against the precious
blood of our fauiour, cast into the teeth of Christendom, because it puts
down call the world for a point of immanity, irreligion, and complete vilany.
Inquire [said Moses] of the antiant days, which are before thee, since the day
that God created man upon the earth, and from one end of heaven to the other,
if ever there were the like thing done. And is not this speech, [though from a
different ground] proper to this conspiracy, if the last word be left out?
Indeed, it was not absolutely done, for the bow brake at the up hot, It was
done to these your catholics, that wished and went about the doing of it. We
give them like thanks, and GOD [without Repentance] will give them the like
reward, as if it had been done. But it was not done to our King, to our
Queen, to our Prince, and those thousands, which by the power of that
infernal blast, should no doubt have accompanied them to the presence of the
eternal Majesty: It was not done unto them, blessed be our merciful God, that
undid it, and out of his all-louing kindness to his church, so graciously put
his own right hand, which brings mighty [things to pass, betwixt the
purpose and the execution. Surely, they thought themselves of gods privy
counsel: In the letter to the lord Moun togle.
God and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of the time: But had they
bin so much as of his court, they would better have known his pleasure, for
there they would have herd the Lord, giving them this precept, Thou shall not
kill. There David would have asked them this question: Who can lay hand on the
Lord annotnted, and be guiltless: There Paul would have set them down this
position, Whosoever resist, purchase to themselves damnation. The Tyrauntes
boasted that they could do mischief, In the said Letter to the Lord Mo.
I say they shall receive a terrible blow, but we felt that the goodness of God
still endured. The Lord, (according to the prayer of David) would not deliver
the souls of so many of his Turtle Doves unto the multitude of their enemies,
and therefore he shot at them with a swift aroow, and hewed the snares of these
ungodly ones in pecces: yet in something they said truth, the conclusion of
that confident menace fell out right: And yet they shall not see who hurt them.
In the said Letter
They do not [indeed] God that shielded them from that terrible blow, be ever
praised.

They do not see who hurt them, but they see that which those vipers little
thought they should have seen; they see some of those that would have hurt
them, and [I hope] will see the rest, howsoever I know they are seen, and
will be remembered according to his blessed will, that best knows how to
reward them. They do not see who hurt them, but they see who preserved them
from hurt.

His Majesty does see, and acknowledge, that it was the same God that stood
so near his holy father King David in all his dangers, That saved his life so
often from destruction, and crowned him with such mercy and loving kindness:
that it was the same God that stuck as close to his dear Sister Queen
Elizabeth in all her troubles, and from her cradle, till he had set the crown
upon her head, and during all the time of her most famous and victorious reign,
preserved her as the Apple of his eye, and never left her, until he had
changed her corruptible crown of gold, to an incorruptible crown of glory,
for her greater aduancemenr: and finally, that it was the same God, which had
covered him likewise from time to time, under his gracious wings, and made him
taste [ere that day] the sweetness of his mercy, as sencibly as David, or
Elizabeth, or any other of those dear anointed ones, had done before him: yea
that prevented him with his liberal blessings, and protected him, not only
from the hour of his birth, [since the world inioyed him,] but which is more
wonderful, whiles the happy womb of his Mother enclosed him: Many a time
have they vexed me from my youth, up, may our king say with Israel, but they
have not prevailed against me. And I will say with those of Israel, that pray
for the peace of Jerusalem, and wish well to Syon, I hope they never shall: for
I doubt not, but God has ever sworn by his holiness, as he did to king
David, and queen Elizabeth, that he will never fail king James.

With the like eye of thankfulness, does the queen, the Prince, the peers, and
all the rest look upon their delivery: acknowledging God only to be their
deliverer: yea the grave Nesiors themselves, whose wise dome may be termed a
brazen wail to our kingdom, do see that a deeper reach, and far greater
providence then theirs, even the wisdom of the almighty was the principal
worker herein: and therefore, [for all their pains, and prudence in the
discouery] lay the matter wholly from themselves, and still make this their
conclusion: Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praise.
And all, from the greatest to the meanest, that should instantly, or by
degrees, have tasted of the stratagem, do see [likewise] not who hurt them:
but who preserved them: and accord in this joyful acclamation. It was thy hand
O Lord that did it: I wonder what construction the favorers of your profession
make of the accident. I know how they carry it outwardly, but what their inward
man thinks of it, in approbation or detestatation of the plot, and touching
the discovery, there is the point. One of the principals seemed only sorry that
the matter took not effect, and slood to it (like himself) that it was not
God it was the Dyuell that prevented it: But the desperate, and (...)
miscreant, that inchristian and uncircumcised Philistine, with all of that
opinion, were utterly deceived, for the dyuell [without question] would have
sung Gaudeamus with the meriest. that day would in all likelihood] have been
the Dyuels holiday: and therefore, in des^ight of him, but chiefly to render
unto our gracious God from whom our salvation comes, the sacrifice of praise
and thanksgiving, the very same daic shall for ever be our holiday.

But to leave them that draw such evil use from this, as generally they do
from all other occurrents, in the prejudice of their misconstruction: It is the
desire of my heart, and would be a joy unto my soul, that you [for your part)
would make a profitable use thereof, that with the true servants of God, you
would draw good out of this evil, meditate thereupon, and seriously ponder
each circumstance belonging thereunto, which would [I make no question] prove a
happy means to remove you out of the base and erroneous school, that reads
whole lectures of ignorance unto you, and wherein ouerlong you have been
trained up, and learned, nothing but absurdities, unto that best learned, and
most Godly university, which will in rich your heart with diuiue wisdom; and
wherein to your great comfort and unspeakable benifit you shall be tutord, and
consorted with true christians.

And to this end, I mean for your learning this one lesson, of making the right
use of the co^spiracy, which may so much avail you, disdain me not (how
unworthy soever I seem) the place of your scholemaister. Thus then (I pray
you) learn to read after me. Surely, it was the mighty hand of God, that
defeated the purpose of those blood-thirsty papists, those more then barbarous
conspirators: It was his tender mercy that set his hand, to that happy and ever
memorable piece of work; they were his beloved servants unto whom such mercy
was extended, that is his true church, whereof those his servants are members,
and therefore by necessary consequence, the church of Rome, that is plainly
opposite to this church of God, that is in deadly enmity with these servants
of God, that inwardly repineth at this mercy of God and that is so manifestly
oppugned by this hand of God, is the false church, no church of christ but the
very idolatious and abominable Sinagogue of Antichrist. This is but a short
esson: howbeit if you con the same perfectly l y heart, and truly conceive it,
you shall feel your soul [I doubt not] so sixed upon the deep consideration
of this saving hand, so wrapped up with the sweet admiration of this exceeding
mercy, so inflamed with the burning desire to be ra^cked amongst these happy
servants, so ravished with the zealus love of this church, that you will rest
assured and most resolutely conclude, that we whom the Lord in such gracious
sort preserves under the shadow of his wings, who are so dear and tender unto
him, and whom he thus hedgeth about, and hemmeth in on every side, are his
peculiar people, his chosen generation, members of his true church, and that
your church of Rome [which indeed as the prophet speaks of Hierusalem] was
[in the primitive time] A righteous city and full of equity, is become
unfaithful as a whore, though righteousness did dewell in it, yet, that now
it is inhabited with murderers, and that her silver is turned to dross, and
her wine is mixed with water. Thus [I say] if you make true use of this
conspiracy [questionlesse] you will conclude, and concluding so, for sake
Bahilon and enter into Zion, and for the good estate of your soul, most
willingly embrace this counsel of your Lord, and savior. Come away from her my
people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her
plagues.

Now give me leave in a word to knit up this point of treason, for which the
Ihesuites, the secular priests and their followers (mistiled catholics) are
become so egregious, with the christian and untainted resolution of the
professors of our religion touching such deseignes. I, that prize my self as
the least of Gods graces, and challenge no prerogative of saithfulnesse to my
King and country, above the loyalty of an ordinary protestant, do [without any
of those mental irreligious referuations] solemnly protest, that were I
secured by an Angel from he men, to possess as much wealth, and attain unto
as much wisdom as Solomon did, to sway as many kingdoms as Asuerus did, to
live as fair an age as Methuselah did, and in fine, to take my leave of the
world, with an easy, and quiet dissolution: yet would I not, in liea of all
this earthly blessedness, once lift up my hand, or so much as incline my heart
toward the deposing of my lawful sovereign the Lords anointed, no not
although my king were a tyrant, as we all know, and his very enemies
acknowledge he is gracious and mild, and [after the Apostles precept] has put
on even the howels of compassion; but concerning this last treason, that
treason of treasons, the unparalleled archtreason of the world, my protestation
shall extend it self fvrther: Namely, that were I assared [besides the
fruition of all the former cited felicity] that my God neither in this world by
the worm of conscience, nor in the world to come by eternal confusion, would
lay the same to my charge but absolutely remit it for ever, yet, that I should
abhor from my soul such a bloody and inhumaine action, and never be won to
give my consent thereunto, for my love to god and his church, my king, and
country, would [I know] religiously, and forcibly restrain ^ne; here you may
think I go very far, but I assure you no fur^her then I am directed by holy
warrant; and this, I affirm to be the true resolution of a protestant and
present unto you as the proper fruit of our religion.

Whereupon if you please to fix the eye of your soul, which is your
understanding, and weigh the same in the true and single balance of impartial
Judgment, you will presently [I doubt not] distaste the fruits of your religion,
and happily discover the same, not to be as it seems, but rather like the
aples of Sodom, which are said to be fair and beautiful in show, but when
they are touched, turn to ashes, and reueile themselves to be of no substance:
But I ouerlong detain you, and confess it is more then hie time I had
concluded: I leave therefore this, and all the other points formerly touched,
to your mature and indifferent consideration, and theirs [whomsoeuer] that
shall likewise daigne the perusal thereof, and will now make bold, (though an
unbidden guest, and but an intruder) to come to your wedding.

It should seem [without impeachment of the gent. worth] that the dear expense
of your time, that precious and invaluable Jewel, was an eloquent and
powerful advocate in his behalf, that at last has so happily made conquest of
your affection: wherein I must approve your wisdom, for there is no earthly
Jewel to be compared therewith. Jewels being lost, may by possibility be
recovered again, but time being spent can never be recalled again. I condemn
my self in iustisieng of you. Indeed therein (I confess) I have been a
prodigal, for I have played so long at this dangerous game of delay, that I
deserve methinkes to be notorious for ill husbandry. The idle time-spender
being [as it is truly saide] the greatest unthrift: you have conside ratiuely
avoided this scandal, whereunto I only say this; that as you have bin wise to
enter into that happy and honorable calling of marriage, and for ought I
know, advised in making your choice; so it is and shall be my prayer, how
weak soever you account the power thereof, that you may be hlessed in your
course, that your husband that lies in your bosom, the issue which is likely
to spring from those imbracements, and all other blessings belonging to
marriage, may derive unto you such contentment meant and happiness, as your
uttermost desires can aim at, or any Gentlewoman of the world ever inioyed. If
you have deserved well of me, this [for the present] is my best requital, if
otherwise, it is my uttermost revenge.

But if the world (which is wedded to idle inquisition) and sick of her old
disease, (sinister misconstruction) would understand the reason that brake the
marriage betwixt us two, and gave you occasion otherwise to dispose of
yourselfe, as you have done: let them know, that [on my part] nothing but our
different religion was the impediment, I appeal unto yourselfe whether I
speak truly: For you cannot but remember that in all opportunity, I was still
harping upon that string, and ever did my best (though all in vain) to have
set the same in perfect tune. I told you, that if you would alter your gross
and foolish opinions, or but give me hope that in future time, I should have
better hearing, and might happily win you thereunto, I would be most willing,
and think my self most happy to knit that gordean knot, without longer
deferring; although our friends should utterly withstand it, and even enforce
us to get our maintenance: I, with my pen, and you with your needle, yea albeit
we were sure to have gone a begging, which we then had not, neither I hope ever
that have reason to stand in fear of: These words I spoke oftener then once
unto you, I spoke them from my heart, I protested that I spoke them so, and I
protest again that I protested truly: This [methinks] may discharge me from
all imputations touching that matter, and upon this targe of proof will I
safely take all the malevolent darts, that shall be thrown against my
reputation; I say, if I was not so forward, and willing as the world expected,
and your worth required, our different manner of doing God service gave the
occasion: And you are not the only Jewel of worth, for I will ever acknowledge
your worth, your morral ver. tues, your gifts of nature, all your praiseworthy
parts, as al are praiseworthy, that, that only, which (obscureth ali the
rest,) excepted: I say you are not the only Jewel of worth, that this
religious, and lawful impediment has debarred me the wearing of: But my god
whose blessed will I refer my self unto, and upon whose holy pronidence, I pray
I may ever depend, will [I know] sufficiently provide for those that faithfuly
trust in his goodness, and in his insinite and unspeakable distribution of
blessings. [I am in good hope] not forget my poor and sinful self though his
most unworthy servant.

And so I beseech his divine Majesty Our almighty creator, for the merit of
his dear son Our merciful redeemer by the illumination of his blessed
spirit, Our holy sanclisier to renew you in the spirit of your mind: to give
you grace to lay lowne the old man which is corrupt, and to put on that new
man, which [after God] is shapen in righteousness, and holiness of truth: To
sill you with knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding, to free you from these strong delusions, and to give you, a
true, lively, and justifying faith in the righteousness of Christ Jesus our
Savior, whereby you have cause to say and sing with holy David, My soul is
escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler, the snare is broken, and
I am delivered. That when your house of clay, whose foundation is but dust,
shall be consumed. You may be translated into the great city holy Jerusalem,
be fed by the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, be led into the
fountains of living water, have all your tears wiped from your eyes: And in a
word be crowned amongst the true servants of the everliving God with eternal
joy and felicity in heaven: where I hope, notwithstanding our separation upon
carth, we shall one day by the mercy of our god, live and reign together.

FINIS.
