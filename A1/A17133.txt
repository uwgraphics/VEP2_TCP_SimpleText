A (...) sum of the Regiment of (...) since the flood, geathered out of the
commendable travail of (...)

(...) hundredth years after the floode, Noah deuvded the earth amongst his. 3.
sons: to Shem he gave Asia: to Ham he gave Africa,, and to Iapheth he gave
Europa, whereof England is a parcel, which was inhab^ted. 200. years after
the flood, by Samothes one of Iapheths sons: after whose name the people were
called Samothei, and the Land^ Samothea. 341. years. Their Religion was good,
for they learned it of Noah. After that time came in Albion, to whom cursed Ham
was great Gra^dfather, who subdued the Samothes, and called ye land Albion,
which was so called. 595. years. The Religion in that time was idolatrous.
1116. yeresbefore the birth of Christ, came in Bru^e, and conquered the land,
which after that time was called Britain. 1946. years. Their Religion was
Paganism, woorshipping of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, in steed of the living
God. The first foundation of Christian faith was laid here in Britain, in the
year of our Lord God 63. by Joseph of Aramathia. This was the first province
that generally received the Gospel in anno. 180. in the time of king Lucius, a
Britain. It remained in this land above. 300. years, until the Saxons
conquered the land, and compelled the Britains with the Gospel to flee into
Wales, and placed Paganism here again, for 143. years. In the time of the
Saxons came Austine the Monk from Rome, in anno 596. to preach the Gospel,
which was corrupted with supersticious ceremonies of that Romish See. He
landed at the I Will of Thanet in Kent, where he converted and baptized King
Ethelbert, being king there, with a great number of Saxons. Since which time,
the people of this land have bin baptized, confessing the name of the Father,
the Son, and the holy Ghost, but utterly degenerating from that true sincerity
of the Christian faith, which they outwardlye professed, until such time as
King Henry the eight (by the will of God) abolished out of this Realm the
usurped power of that Antichrist of Rome, reduced the Scriptures to the
knowledge of the vulgar tongue, and redressed the state of the Church and
religion. This land was called Britayne until such time as King Egbert a Saxon,
about the year of our Lord God 830. commanded the land to be called England,
and the people Englishmen. It has bin invaded since Christ's time, by five
sundry nations: first by the Romans, who came in with Julius Caesar 54 years
before the birth of Christ: Secondly, by the Piets, who came in anno 87.
Thirdly by ye Saxons, who came in anno 449. Fourthly by the Danes, who came in
anno 791 And fyftly, by the Normas, who came in with William the Conqueror, in
anno 1067. Since which time, there has reigned in England 21. Kings, and 1
Queen, to the year of our Lord God 1558. In the which year our most
gracious Queen Elizabeth began her prosperous raygne, which God grant to be
long amongst us, to Gods glory, her Majesty's endless comfort, and the profit
of this our common wealth, Amen.

Take this as a remembrance, and for no other cause: Esteem not the gift,
but the good will of D^se.
