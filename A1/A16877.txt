AT LONDON, Printed by H. L. for Thomas Man, 1612.

TO THE NOble and hopeful young Lord, Ferdinando, Lord Hastings, son and heir
apparent of the right Honorable, the Earl of Huntingdon.
TO promise, is the easiest matter of all other, right Noble Lord: but in
things of moment all the difficulty is in performance. How I have engaged my
self to your most honorable Parents, by public acknowledgement of the bond
of my duty, for their many favors, and by protestation of my desire ever to
witness my thankfulness, in seeking the advancement of them and their Noble
house, it is well known to all. Can I then be blamed, if I study to perform
that unto their worthy progeny, which I cannot to their Honors otherwise? That
as your Lordshippe, with all the Noble offspring of their most renowned family
do excel in birth, so you may in all singular learning, wherein true Nobility
does chiefly consist, and whereby you may be admired and honored of all. When
Nobility has all parts of rare wisdom to govern it, then is it as the
goodliest ship, having wind at will, under the rule of a skillful master, so
as it shall ever sail safely, in the midst of most perilous rocks and
boisterous storms. To this end this has been my first desire toward your
Lordship, that the entry to all good learning may be most easy unto you, and
full of all sweet delight. Though all my school labors be yours in this
respect, that they have been of later years, more specially intended for your
Lordship above others, and proceeded in principally by the favor of my
Honorable Lord; yet heerin I have thought it most fit to signify this duty.
Because, howsoever it be the least of all my endeavors for your Lordship, yet
it is for your entrance into your Latin studies, and the first of those
Grammatical translations, whereof I have conceived an undoubted hope of a
perpetual benefit to come to all Schools and good learning by them: by
setting all the younger sort in the high way, and guiding them by the hand, to
go through all their first usual Authors with certainty and double fruit, and
that almost in one half of the time, which is ordinarily spent in them; as I
trust experience shall prove to all, and this little book shall give
sufficient trial. So that your Lordship may have passed all the difficulty of
learning, before you have felt what any pains of learning do mean: and that,
that part which has been wont to be the discouragement of the little ones, may
be made unto them the pleasantest of all; to their exceeding joy, with the
comfort of all both parents and instructours. Also for the little book it
self, which I have thus made choice of, to show the first trial in, according
as it was gathered of purpose, for the first enterers into Latin, although it
be small in quantity, yet the worth of it truly known, and it rightly used,
shall be found above the weight in the finest gold; for that there are contained
in it, so many wise sentences of most learned men, as shall at the very first
give your Lordship a true taste of all kind of that wisdom, which shall so
much adorn you, and also furnish you with words to express the same. Which,
after that you are once perfect in the first grounds of Grammar (as you may
soon be, by the plain direction which I have labored to prepare for you, in
my questions called the Posing of the Accidence and Grammar) by the help of
this translation, and your often reading the sentences out of it, you shall have
both matter and phrase to flow into your remembrance, without either toyling
of your mind, or ouercharging of your memory at all. For the manner of the use
hereof, and the rest of this kind, that your Lordship may reap the benefit of
them, and of all my trauells for you, I refer your director unto that which I
have written in my Grammar-Schoole. These first fruits of my most dutiful
affections, being accepted according to my entirest desire toward your
lasting honor, I have just cause to hope that by that time that your Lordship
shall be meet to proceed to higher studies, the Lord who has thus begun,
will make all the way to the top of all excellent knowledge, as sure, ready,
and full of all pleasant allurement unto you, as ever Noble personage did know
before. Until which time, I shall not fail thorough his gracious assistance,
to prosecute the work by a continued inquiry of all the learned and best
experienced, of this present, and all ages past; nor yet to have undoubted
assurance, of whatsoever I shall commend unto your Lordship. If this dedication
shall seem strange unto any, by reason of your Lordships tender years, this
will be my just defense: that as God gave this special experiment of
translating Grammatically, and of the benefits thereof together with you, so
far forth as I know* so my hope is that it shall grow up with you, and come to
maturity by that time that your Lordship shall be able to judge of it, by your
own experience. In the mean while I shall not be wanting to strive with God by
prayer, that he may so bless you with your hopeful Brother, and all other
allied to your Noble house, and to fit you for the best studies, that you may
add to the renown of all your famous progenitors, and propagate an
everlasting augmentation of all virtue and honor to all that ever succeed you,
and be lights to all other of true nobility.

Your Lordships, in all study, and dutiful affection, JOHN BRINSLEY.

understanding) may very much increase, and go forward of themselves.
