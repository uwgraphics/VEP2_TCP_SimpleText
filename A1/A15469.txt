Wat Williams Will.
Well-wishing Williams Will and Testament,
Which to the Ballad-singer he has sent,
To be dispersed to all good people kind,
That would do well, and bear an honest mind.
To the tune of, Then let us to Virginia go.


I Wish for no man's riches,
yet would I were more wealthy;
And those that are both sick and lame
I would they were more healthy:
I wish to be contented
with that which God does send me,
And take his blessings in good part,
of all that he does lend me.
I wish all cruel Landlords
would not be stony hearted,
That to their Tenants which are poor
some Rent be back imparted,
Then sure their Heirs would prosper,
and not so soon consume it,
As some with Dice, and Drabs, and Drink,
and Indian-weede perfume it.
I wish all Christian people
in peace to live together,
And not for trifles go to law,
or wagging of a feather:
The Lawyers they make rich,
unto their own undoing,
As too too many in this Land
do wring their hands with wooing.
I wish all Shopkeepers
would use true weight and measure,
And not with slight and rotten Wares
get such a deal of Treasure;
With yea, and nay, and truly,
and verily, dear Brother,
I cannot sell under that price
if 'twere unto my Mother.
I wish Artificers
and handy-crafty Tradesmen,
Would make no slight and rotten Wares,
in which they so deceive men;
Their Stuff are naught and rotten,
and will not hold the wearing,
I wish that Quack-saluers
and Mountebanks so busy,
That kills so many with their Drugges,
and live in corners privy,
They had some better skill,
and not so many murder,
Those private faults they do commit
the earth does quickly smother.
I wish that Farmers rich
that hordeth Corn in corners,
And those that buys the Bread of life,
and hides it in their Garners,
It might from them be took,
who makes such scarce of plenty,
Ere it does rot, as some has done,
and given to Poor that is empty.
Would Bakers all were honest;
and Colliers sell true measure,
Nor shrink their Sackes to wrong the poor,
'twould do them mickle pleasure;
Would Souters use good Leather,
and Taylers leave their stealing,
The needy sort should better live,
if all used honest dealing.
I Wish all Tapsters eke,
their liquor not to spill it,
Nor yet to bumbast up their Iugges
and Pots, with froth to fill it;
You need not call for drink,
if you have money plenty,
He Will fill your brains and belly full,
but soon your pockets empty.
I wish all Ostlers eke
to leave their double dealing,
Nor use to grease their Horses teeth,
nor yet their Oats be stealing;
They Will cheat you to your face,
strewing Oats on the pecks bottom,
The second part,
To the same tune.


WOuld drunkards leave such drinking,
and Gallants leave their roaring:
Would desperate Dick forbear to stab,
and Leachers leave their whoring:
If there were no Pick-pockets,
nor Thieves in corners lurking,
The Hangman might go hang himself,
or starve, for want of working.
I doubt some money-mongers
that uses great extortion,
Which makes Dice of poor men's bones,
they shall have Dives portion:
I wish that Iaylers eke
of Country and of City,
Would not use Prisoners poor like dogs,
but take of them some pity.
I wish all men were honest,
and all did love true dealing,
Nor run in debt good minds to cheat,
nor any bent to stealing;
Would there no cheating were,
no cogging, nor no lying:
Would there were no deceit at all
in selling or in buying.
Would some receive no bribes,
nor double Fees be taking,
Some Clyents on the surer side
would not have hearts so aching,
And Termers might keep home,
being ruled by honest Neighbors,
As many which were wise have done,
and saved their Coin and labors.
I wish no strifes nor jarring
t'wixt married couples happen,
And then each thing will prosper well,
their children well will batten:
All things will well increase,
by Gods Almighty power,
In discord do not spend your days.
nor on each other lower.
Likewise I wish all Parents
their Children well to nourish,
And in Gods word to train them up,
which like to Vines will flourish:
And Children have a care
to please your Parents truly,
Then long you shall enjoy the land,
and have all things most duly.
I wish true amity
amongst Neighbors may be common;
And that no honest minded man
be matched with a bad woman:
Nor that an honest wife
do with a mad man marry,
Being so yoak't, there is naught but strife,
and all things seem to vary.
I wish all wicked Traitors,
and such like bloody fellows,
That do their King and Country hate,
were hanged on the Gallows.
I wish that peace and plenty
may in our Kingdom flourish,
And that the Gospels heavenly light
we may embrace and nourish.
And all wished happiness
unto my King I render,
That long amongst us he may reign,
in glory and in splendour:
Our gracious Queen God bless,
and Royal Progeny,
Long let them live, and after death
place them in Heaven most hie.
I wish the Clergy well,
the Nobles, and the Gentry,
The Laymen, and the Commons all,
poor men I Will not exempt ye;
Lord send us charity,
let us our lives be mending,
And give thee thanks for all thy gifts
thou still to us art sending.
Thus now my Testament
I fully have concluded,
And wish you well to use these lines
which here you have perused:
This is my Legacy
which unto all is given:
The Lord preserve you every one,
And send your souls to heaven.
FINIS.
Wat Woe;;^^ms
