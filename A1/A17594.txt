To the kings highness.
O Exellent prince of my life chief patron
Medicyn to sick me^ in their great distress
To all nedy: both shield and protection
Refuge to wretches their dommage to redress
Men that are half deed / restoring to quickenesse
Since your grace of god was chose^ to be so good
O exellent prince forgive my offencesse
In thonour of god that bought you with his blood
Black is my wede / of co^playnte and mourni^g
As a man cast from all felycite
Like one of a funeral / bedewed with weeping
Clad in the mantell of froward aduersyte
Trymblyng and quakinge / of my life no surete
But if I drink of your most merciful flode
Than shall I never offend / by your soueraynte
But save that which god bought with his p^ciouse blood
O myrrour of light / suffer not to perisshe
Thy poor subject: but to his prayer enclyne
Which herafter thy laws shall cherisshe
And keep them as most holly and divine
Since your grace has been treacle and chef medicyn
To other offenders which in myschef stood
Pardon me Salomo^ / I will obey thy doctrine
And save ye which god bout with his p^cious blod
And for my part / of one heart abidyng
Void of change / and all mutabilyte
I do present this book / with hand shaking
Of hole affection / knelyng on my kne
Desyring the lord / which is persons three
By whose magnifycence we receive all fode
That by your grace I may have lybertye
And save ye which god bout with his p^ci* blood
For all my purpose combyned in to one
Of which this book shall make mencioun
Is to void ill wede / and to take the good corn
As reason has taught me by discretioune
Puttyng no trust in the whele of fortune
But in this dialogue comprehend that persons good
By grace and virtue may here contune
And save ye which god bought with his p^cious blood
Go forth little book for fere trembling
Pray the prince to have on the pytie
Void of all picture / or of any conning
To compyle any curyouse ditie
Causynge thy prince to take on the mercy
Pray god grant his grace that died on the rode
To preserve his hye noblenes and magnanimite
And to be partaker of Christ's precious blood.
Thus ends the supplication
/ and here follows the Dialogue between the Playntyf and defendant.
The Playntyfe AS I sat musyng / calling to reme^bran^ce
And considered in mine own fantasy
The unsure trust of worldly varyaunce
Of men and women / the change and the folly
Thought in my mind to compyle some ditye
Like one troubled in heart with heaviness
No socour fyndinge / me for to redress.
Blamyng fortune / why she stood not certain
But with her double whele brought me^ in doubt
Causynge me for to suffer much pain
Reportynge how she had cast me out
From her favor / as she turned about
Taki^g a wrong turn / where I thought me sure
By her double means / and my hard adventure
Saying lady: thou set by me no price
For by thy froward and furiouse vyolence
Thou have turned thy whele / and visage of malice
Bringynge me clean from all credence
Having nothing to make resystence
Thus by the fortune / and thy mutabilyte
Sole adiect^ / and cast in to pouerte
What have I offended thou art so co^trarious
Which has caused me in mischefe to fall
Thus to be tourmented in thy syege perilouse
My sweet sugre is tempered with gall
Wherefore to the / I reply my hurtes all
But this as I wrote / I herd a voice cry
Peace I say / thou begynnest for to lie

Deffenda^t SOthly I parceyue well thy condition
Thou do as unthrifts / almost every cho^e
Will them excuse / without exception
And blame fortune / as their chef fone
Saying / it is in her power alone
The to rule / as a lady of desteny
Which is a sect of plain Idolatry
Nature has taught the / y^ wrong is to excuse
Under a curtayne / your falshed to hyde
Little good corn among your chaf to use
On your fautes you list not to abide
The gaul touched / all that you set a side
Sowynge roses fresshe / the nettles you let pass
Under fortune to cover your trespass
And if you may tell your own tale
How that all came by fortunes whele
Lockinge your falsnesse fast in a male
Showing of your vices but a small percele
Is brickle glass / she weth brighter than stele
Though upon fortune you would set your p^tence
He is a fool that gives to you credence

Playntyffe THus was I pensyf / the water from my eye
For fere spronge forth / and made pale my vi sage
Sore a basshed I being solytary
Should here a voice / and se no image
It parted atwayne / both color and courage
But by the voice / I thought by nature
That it should be some mortal creature.
I sat full still and marked what it said
Ferefull of chere / sad in countenance
Thinkinge to answer / sone at abrayde
And to that saying gave dilygent attendaunce
Thus than I said with good remembrance
If thou wylt argue / against fortunes strength
It will besene upon the at the length
Fortune has lift many men alofte
To hye astate and worldely dignyte
Another sort she has gryped full vnsofte
And cast them down in to great aduersyte
By other proved / now verifyed in me
Which is cast down into strong prison
There to abide of the law correction

Deffendant GOod reason that / for laws first was found
Insondry wise and busy occupacyon
Virtue to cherisshe / vices to confound
Men chosen / of power and good entencyon
Which of offenders should se done executyon
So that the virtuous should be reserved
And have promosyons / such as they deserved.
Dedalus was the first that prisons wrought
Full of ingyns / called Laborinthus
All offenders thither to be brought
A crooked place / to get forth dangerous
For such as to good laws were contrarious
And Tarquinus / as I written find
Found first shaccles men for to bind
These were ordained virtue to prefer
And to maintain true labor and business
Besides that / to punisshe such as should err
Which have no joy but upon Idleness
And for other in their labors retchelesse
Purposynge to punisshe Sardanapall
Which of mischeues / may be reconed principal

Playntyffe OF Sardanapall I never had acqueyntesse
I ever loved to a void his company
Knowing him to be vicyouse Idleness
Which is destruction / to all manner of degree
Therefore thou offendest to atwyte me
With him whom I never yet loved
Nor yet them / which him in household cherisshed
And where thou say that priso^s ordained be
Offenders to chastyce / to maintain the right
For the welfare of every comynaltye
To prefer virtue to his clear light
That to denaye it were not in my might
But one thing would I demand of the
Whether such rob not a hole comynaltye
That has sheep in pastures going
Which ground before this has be put to tyllage
Having thousa^des / his poor neybour lackinge
He and his shepherdes alone in a vyllage
Thus gets his goods / by extortion and pyllage
If a man part of his goods withdraw
Shall he make answer therefore by gods law

Deffendant NAy not so I say / it is all otherwise
I may not suffer you to go there among
Lest that you would perilouse things deuyse
Under a color / to occupy you with wrong
What should I longer draw the matter a long
Of gods laws thou art not executor
Nor of thy souerayns / no good reformator.
God gave a law / and with this a precept
That no man should his neighbors good desire
Thou have not the office them to corecte
But with god thou ronnest in great Ire.
But what thou meanest / now sone I can conspire
Thou thynkest to make a cloak for the rain.
It will not be / for it is all in vain.
Of such conspiracy began first robbers
Thieves by hye ways / extorcion with violence
Murder / slaughter / and covert brybers
Discension / grudgyng / and disobedience
Now of thy tale to touch thy pretense
It is not fortune that causes their ill chance
But them / selves for lack of good governance.

Playntyffe Not fortune? yes / and that shall well be seen
For by her ever / men do possess treasures
Fallen has to ruyn both king and queen
And raised again by her only socours
Exalted she has / many great co^querours
And to such as she would natse
Has cast them down in great aduersyte
Look who she enbraseth and holds i^ her chain
Worldely people / and their goods transitory
And rich merchants under her demean
To knighthod she gives conquest and victory
She gives to other worldely prosperyte
Look who her favor has recured
In this life / of wealth they be assured.
These bishops which be of low birth borne
And spiritual prelates in Rome town
She has them exalted other beforne
But now a little she has brought them down
Thus wha^ she list her self to frown
She spares niether manhod nor kynred
For of all persons she will be dred

Deffenda^t Such be wretches / and to god unkind
That puts them under her subjection
From gods precepts making the^ self blind
Submittynge the^ to fortune / above good reason
And as touching ye prelates y^ ar brought down
Fortune pulled them not from that place
It is the scorge of god / for y^ they lacked grace.
The fall of one / should be a clear light
To teach the other what they should eschew
It is god that punissheth with his might
And tries out the false from the true
Who that is here punisshed for his offense dew
Happy may be / if he say with good intent
Welcome from god / the scourge of chastysement
O what unkind people should them betake
And put their wylles unto fortunes cure
Of god above the power to forsake
And with fortune all thing will assure
Thinking always by her to endure
Like as she were of desteny a goddess
That could bring man to wealth or wretchedness

Playntyffe THy words strong I may not well debar
Thy name I desire before that I do spek
I think thou have ben some man of war
Thy wind causes my heart to break
Out from my eyes the water does out leke
Thinkige I have begone / against one to reply
Which by his strength will have the mastry
For like as ron^de drops of the south rain
Which that discende / and fall from a lofte
On stones hard / at the eye as it is said
Peerseth the hardness / with their falling often
Albert in toucheng / the water is but soft
The persyng causes by force no puisaunce
But by falling / the long contynuaunce
So semblaby of right I dare reherce
Thy words marked with full and good intent
A hole in to my heart does perce
For I fere lest that I might be shent
And by my excusing run in a contempt
More worthy for that to be punissheable
Than by the fault I should have been culpable

Deffendant IN wars trewly there have I ben often
But my nature is always to make pease
Without me most things do prove naught
How so ever it be / by hardness or ease
Look who that loves me not to please
Here he can not long be in tune
Although he think to mary with fortune
I have me so used / that through my noblenes
Clerks in lerninge / which clearly can concern
Daughter of god / lady / and princes
Reason they call me / good folk to govern
Atwene good and evil / justly to decerne
I have departed plainly to conclude
The life of man / from the life of beestes rude.
With me I conserve / both virtue and mesure
Consyderinge things / what shall be fall
Taking no enterprice: but with me descrecion sure
And upon prudence / found my works all
Than to counsel / Attemperaunce I do call
Warely prouydinge / in my self within
The end of things / before that I begin.

Playntyffe. HElas / helas / to write in words few
Longer to live / I have no fantasye
For where should I my face out show
Sith against reason / I have held champerty
Now dare I appear in to no company
For to my body / death I have provided
Leui^g reason and virtue / which should me have gided
Now this matter troubles my memory
Better to dye than to live in shame
For my offenses thus stand I in ieoperdy
Fro my mortal body / gone is my name
Youth and fraylnesse was much to blame
Wherefore better it were from this life disceuer
Than with slaunderouse fame / for to live ever.
Some tongues there be venemouse of nature
When they perceive a man from state meued
With their wylles do their busy cure
By ill report / to make men more grieved
There is no poison so well expert and preued
Therefore now heart / why brekest thou not aso^der
Of this world to rydde the from this wonder.

Deffendant Not so / for I can break a castle down
And bylde it after more fresshe to ye sight
Exyle a man from diverse region
And him revoke when I list by right
Thus may I do by my power and might
So that thou wylt obey to me reason
I shall the teache / this trouble to ouercom
A thief may rob a man of his richesse
And by some mean make restitution
Another may by might oppress
The poor man from his possession
Yet after to him make satisfaction
Be it with life or else with death.
Cor contritum et humiliatum deus non dispiciet.
Thus I now beginning / derked with ignorance
My wit is dull this thing to discern
Quenched a^ the torches of parceueraunce
Clean extincte the light of my lantern
Lacking learning my style to govern
Dread and uncunning makes a battle
With dullness of wit / to hinder my travail
Supporte have I none my dulnes to guide
Pouerte has written my name in his book
Dispere stands also by my side
Which paleth my chere / and astonyeth my look
Thus I hot / dry / and weary / fyndeth no bo^e
How I should to reason my promise fulfill
Standing waueringe between good and ill

Deffendant Despair / I say nay / that is contrary
It is Idleness here in this present life
Which has drawn many from their lybrary
And will not suffer them to be contemplatyfe
For her condition is to hold strife
With every virtuous occupacion
Which men should void / by wysedom and reason
Remember thy business / look thou take heed
Proceed with thy work thou have take in hand
Grace shall cross thy sail with good speed
And keep thy ship from neglyge^ces sand
Good counsel shall bring thy ship to land
And hope shall bring unto the socour
Trustyng some man shall acquyte thy labor
I mean as thus / the ship of thy traueyle
Which has passed the great dangerouse seven
Cast not anchor / till thou have good riuale
Let no tempest / thunder / nor leuyn
Nor no wyndes of the cloudy heuyn
Cause idleness to lay thy pyllow / eue^ nor morrow
Void her / and let her go with sorrow

Playntyffe THis writing my letter / I wrapped all in dread
In my right hand / my pen begineth to quake
And for fere / my heart is like to blede
Yet must I forth / and this undertake
For to Reason promise did I make
The teres distillynge fro mine eyes brinke
At this beginning I tempre with my ink
But hope and trust puts away despair
In to my mind / of new I began redress
To make the wether bright and fair
Reasons promise / with his bou^tuous largeness
Brought in to my heart so much gladness
That without any manner of delay
As is this tenor / this first I began say.
CReatures all / in your first prouydence
Be right well ware / any thing to attame
Which unto god should be offense
For if ye do the end of it is shame
And in this world appalled is your name
But you repent / god of his justice
your vicious lyueng unawarely will chastyce
Except you follow virtue with dilygence
Forsaking vice / the mother of Idleness
your end you may se / by other experience
Which is naught / but misery and wretchedness
Forsake wrong / and follow rightwisenesse
Or else of one thing be you sure
God will not suffer you long to endure
Unto false prophets give no credence
Following man's lerninge / and their tradicion
But to gods precepts with all reverence
Put thy mind and hole entencyon
Forsake not god for all their punission
For they be wolves wrapped in a lammes skin
Honey without / and poison within
The wyly wolves that casts to devour
The sely lammes / which can no defense
Nor no help / them for to socoure
So feeble they are to make resystence
Which denies truth / by false appearance
What wonder is it / the fraud not conceived
Though such lammes unawarely be deceived
La^mes they are i she wyng / shadowed with meekness
Cruel as tigers / who does the^ offense
Of great holiness pretendynge a likeness
But woe (alas) what harm does appearance
What damage does countrefayt innocence
Under a mantell of false simplicite
Very hipocrites full of cruelty
Remember Rome / call now unto thy mind
The days ar passed of thy felicyte
Thy great co^questes are left behind
To light is come all thy iniquite
Thy decrees sent forth in to every country
Such as agreed not with Christ's scripture
Ar clean extyncke / no longer may endure
From Theest to ye Weest thy lybertes did attayn
Above all power most excellent and royal
But now truth brought out / so evident and plain
Has hyndred fore thy seat imperial
In peoples hertes to remain perpetual
Your hye prydes are now defaced
Your bulls and pardons / almost out raced.
Kings and princes were to the tryputary
Of all wealth / so great was your flode
Until from god / so fare you did vary
That all creatures / knowing ill from good
Perceived you bare two faces in one hood
Than by good reason sone they provided
From your burdens / for to be divided
O Rome / Rome / look all thy old abusion
Of thy Ceremonies / and false disgysynge
Lay them aside / and now inconclusion
Cry god mercy / thy trespass repentyng
Trust he will not at length refuse thy askyng
The to receive to work in his vine
And to have asmoche / as he that came at prime.
Unto the king with faithful obeysaunce
Toward his grace / show thy humilyte
Against him nor his / hold no varyaunce
But fight for him / in every country
Desire to se him in joy and felycite
Keep his precepts / as thy lord and sovereign
Ever as pleasure / thinking them no pain.
Thy obeysaunce plainly / at a word
By god thou art commanded to owe in souerente
Unto thy king / thy governor and thy lord
In pain of dedly sin / so he commands the
Both to him / and to such as he a gre
Of his people to take the governance
Them to follow with their good ordinance
Consider thou / it is a hertely reioysinge
To serve a prince / that well does aduertyse
Of his servants the faithful just meaning
And will consider to gwerdon their service
Which at a need will them not despyce
But from all danger that should the^ noye or grieve
Be ever ready to help them and releue.
As in this land / I dare affirm a thing
Henry the eight / full mighty of puisaunce
Of England and France / our most noble king
Defensor of the faith / hauig Irela^de in gouerna^ce
To al his subjects / greatest joy and pleasa^ce
By whose noble polycie / and also discecyon
Conserved is this most noble regyon
Duringe his time / long by his prudence
Pease and quiet / he sustayneth by right
That not withstanding his noble prouydence
In this world lives not a better knight
Eyed as Argus / with reason and foresyth
And in good lerninge / I dare of him tell
Of his predecessors / the most he does excel
This with his prudence / and his manhede
Truth he sustayneth / favor setting a side
To Christ's scripture / a mayntenour with deed
That in this land / false prophets dare not bide
A very supporter / vpholder / and also guide
Of Christ's church defense / and noble champion
To chastyce all tho / that be Christ's fone
Obseruinge always / the testament of Jesu
Studyenge ever to have the true intellygence
Gyuenge his subjects the light of virtue
I pocrisy excluding under false appearance
Thus of the truth he has experience
Knowing him self / in many sundry wise
Where they trespace / their error to chastyce
Reuolue how our sovereign / a mirror of lit
Tra^scendeth all other / by virtuous exellence
Eschewinge all visyons / sekinge the right
By his noble descrecyon / and natural prouydence
Temperinge his nature / by mercy and clemence
Keeping dangers from his subjects in all thing
As appertains to a most noble king
Things long passed / he keeps in remembrance
Conseruing all things / with honor in presence
For things to come / makes good ordinance
Following the traces of virtuous contynence
Against rayned miracles making resistance
By the great virtue / and magnanimyte
Which is apropred to his royal majesty
Also his manhood / shows him like a king
From other princes by manner of appearance
Of goodly stature as ever was reigning
Spoken long and far of men / from his presence
I know not whether with dew reverence
The regio^ should be happyer / yt has such a governor
Or else by god chosyn / his grace to ye honor
About him he has for our great avail
Daily and hourly in his presence
Prudent and valiant to be of his counsel
Such of this world as has most experience
Between good and evil knowing ye difference
Tha giuyng Res publica / to us his subjects
With reverent fere and love / obeyng his precepts.
What heart so indurate / should not love such one
Which so nobly conserueth his royal dygnite
Although he were made of the Adamant stone
Yet would it give / for he with prosperyte
Is not gladder / nor for no aduersyte
Changes no countinance / his courage to renew
Both to god and man / yeldyng that is dew.
Thus a man that perfyte is and stable
As scripture with good reason does preue
Nothing there is so fair nor agreeable
Than finally this viciouse life to leave
On very god rightfully to be leave
Him to love and worship above all thing
And next to him / thy most redouted king
Old examples of men that has fall
If they with grace brought them to mind
Might be a myrrour to creatures all
How they in virtue shall remedies find
To eschew vices / of such as were made blind
Fro sodayn falling them selves to preserve
Long to contune / and thank of god deserve
But such as list not corrected to be
By example of other for vicyouse governance
Other of him shall the correction se
Because they should mende their misgouernance
Say not that it is by fortunes variaunce
Colourynge such gyltes / which they do use
Their demerytes by color so to excuse
Who follows virtue longest shall perceuer
Be it in riches or else in poverty
Light of troth / his clerenes keeping ever
Against the assautes of long prosperity
Make youth and virtue together to agree
For when a man from virtue does declyne
Hard it is / if he make a good fine
Virtue conserueth all men in their glory
And here confirms their habitations
Where vices puts their price out of memory
For their trespases / and also transgressyons
Than are they taken and cast in prisons
Sone after / for their great punicyon
Brought to their end / by just executyon
Lokinge about them / there shall they se
Their friends / and other for dolor sobbing
With their hands wringyng thy sore aduersyte
Some wondering / some be dewed with weeping
Of strangers a noyce / and a hidyouse cryenge
Thus is their end / with shamfull rumure
Where virtue lacks / nothing may endure
Look / who in this world does most desire
By wrong title / his state to magnify
By an etyke of couetouse / hotter than fire
Other men's goods / as his own to occupy
As I have red / and seen with mine eye
Though it has lasted for a small time
The end of it has turned to ruin
Mark in your mind / who ever has used
To oppress truth: by power and tyranny
And rightwysenesse / by will has refused
Supporting him self / by extortion and robbery
Auoydyng reason / folowinge sensualyte
Coniecter ever / if their fine and prefe
Were not always / to dye. at a mischefe
To this I know / no man can make descorde
For well it is proved / all such will come to nout
Thousa^des of examples I could bring to record
And mo I know / if they were out sought
It shall not need / for all men in their thought
Knows ill gotten / worse euerspent
yet for their extortion / they shall be shent
Besides that / such as loves idelnesse
Owinge to god / neither love nor dread
Couetouse people / that men does oppress
And such as will do nothing / but for mede
As desemblers cladde in double wede
Who sercheth well / naught is the end
yet god suffers long / to have them to amend
From ill counsel / fast look thou flee
For that has brought many to mischaunce
Shedynge honey first / stingyng after as the be
Though ye honey be sweet / ye stinge is greua^ce
So shall be the end / who follows the chance
That he shall curse the time / and also repent
That ever with their honey / he took any talent
Such may be called / the deuyls taberers
With froward soundes / the ears to fulfill
Or of Cures the perilous buttelers
Which gall with their honney / down distyll
Whose drinks be both amorous and ill
And all clerks well deuyse conne
Worse than the drink of Cerenes tonne
Therefore put life never in a venture
But for matters just / and also true
Preue them by reason that they stand sure
Know well the grownde / of matter old or new
The best than take / and the worst eschew
After thy degree / make thy cost and spending
That in a mean / thou make a good ending
When Dedalus taught his son for to fly
He bad him first of hye discretyon
From Phoebus hete / to keep his wings fre
And from Neptunus cold congelacion
Meaning hereby / for short conclusyon
That who that list with joy his state assure
In a good mean men should lengest endure
With great plenty / men be not best assured
After their lust always to live in ease
And though ye men great treasure has recured
With their riches they feel many a disease
Great personages has not alwai things the^ to please
Therefore as stories diverse does express
Heartily is joy / at wene poverty and richese
In the earth here / the greatest felicite
For the hertes ease / and richest possessyon
Is with suffysaunce content for to be
Of worldly trouble to eschew the occasyon
Meuyng no quarelles / yt should cause discension
Nor desire nothing / hard to recure
For here is little in this world sure.
Moral Seneck / records by writynge
Richest of things / is a mean from pouerte
Ever of one chere / void of all grudgynge
Both in joy / and also aduersyte
Through this world to have their lyberte
And these Greek words which I written find
Always remember and bear them in thy mind
Diogynes was content in his little tun
His conquest was more sovereign of degree
Than Alexander / for all his renown
For he conquered his sensualyte
Making him subject to reason of dewtie
And clerk of his kechen he made attemperaunce
Which of his body had the hole governance
Examples we have enough us to suffyce
In books found. xx. thousand and mo
To exemplyfy folk that been wise
How this world is a through fare full of woe
Tossed and tumbled with vanytes to and fro
Death is annexed to us by succession
For Adams offense to us conueyde down
O wordely folk aduertyce with good intent
What vengeance / and what punissyon
God shall take in his judgment
For our trespaces / and also transgressyon
Which breketh his precepts against all reason
Forgetting how with his preciouse blood
Us to save / he dyed on the rode.
Here for our sakes / and our redemption
Through hand and foot nailed to a tree
Soffred pain / and cruel passion
Nothing asking of high nor low degree
Recompensed ayenwarde for to be
But that we should set / all hole our ententes
To fulfill all his commandments.

Thus ends the Dialogue of the Playntyf and the defendaunte.
