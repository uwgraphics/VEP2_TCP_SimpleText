HERE BEGINS THE CALENDAR OF Shepardes Newly Augmented and Corrected.




Here begins the Prologue.
This book (gentle reader) was first corruptly printed in France and after
that at the cost and charges of Richard Pynson, newly translated and
reprinted, although not so faithfully as the origynal copy required. Wherefore
it is once again ouerseene and perused, that the same may be at length
correspondent to the actours mind and very profitable for the reader, because
this book does teache mani things that we be bound to learn and know one
pain of everlasting death. As the laws of God shows how we may know to
keep his commandments and to know the remedies to withstand deadely sin,
there be many men and women thinks them self wise, and knows and learneth
many things, but that they be bound to learn and know, that they know not.
As first the x. commandments of God, and the v. commandments of the
Church, that every creature that purpose to be saved should learn and know and
have them as perfytely as their Pater noster, you people, how will you confess
you, and if ye break any of the x. commandments, and you know not them.
Truly there is but few that knows them, there fore ye that do not know them
to your deligence to learn them, for ye be bound to learn them, as well as to
learn your Pater noster. For how can you keep our Lords commandments and
ye know them not. And ye be bound to break not one of them on pain of
dampnation, for and if thou break one thou brekest all. Offend the law in
one point, and offend in all. For and thou break one thou do not Gods
byddyng, for he byddeth thee break none. And all that ye do in this world here,
but if it be of God, or in God, or for God all is in vain, you should not
occupy your self in vain matters, but in redinge of good books, for vanity
engenders vain thoughts, and destroys deuo^ion to man. What need it you to
study on a thing that is naught: study on your sin, and what grace by God
in you is wrought. Also in this book is many mo matters, look in the Table here
folowinge.

Addycions.
The art, scyencye, and practycke of the great calendar of Shepardes, by
example right fertyle, and profitable unto all manner of people, and easy to be
understand by man's wit, with diverse addicions newly adiusted there to, as
hereafter follows.

A great question asked between the Shepardes touching the sterres, and an
answer made to the same.


THe Shepardes in a morning before thee day being in the fyeldes, beheld the
fyrmament that was fyxed full of sterres, one among the other said to his
fellow. I demand of thee how many sterres be on the twelve parties of the
zodyake, that is under one sign only. The other Shepharde answered and said.
Let be found a piece of land in a plain country, as upon the plain of
Salysbury, and that the said piece of land be xl. mile long and xxiiii. mile
broad. After that let take great long nails with great broad heads, as the
nails been that be made for carte wheles, as many as shall suf^fyse for the
said piece of land. And let the said nails be strycken unto the heads in
the said piece at land, four fyngers broad one from the other, till that the
piece of land be covered over from one side to the other. I say that there be
as many sterres contained onder one sign only, as there should b^ nails
stycke in the forsayde piece of land, and there is as many under ech^ of the
other, and to the equypolent by the other places of the firmament. The first
Sheparde demanded how will thou proof it. The second aunswe^red and said that
no man is bounden ne holden to prove things vnpossible^ and that it ought to
suffice for Shepardes and touching this matter to beleu^ simply without to
enquire over much, of that their predicessours Shepardes have said before.



Thus ends the Astrol^^gy of Shepardes, with the knowledge that they have o^
the sterres, planettes, and mouynges of the skies.

And here after follows the saying of the Shepa^^de to the plowman.

How plowman should do.
PErs go thou to plowe, and take with the thy wife
Delue and draw, sow barley whete and rye,
Of one make x. this is perfyte life.
As says Aristotle, in his philosophy
Thou need not study to know Astrology
For if the whether be not to thy pleasaunce
Thank ever God, of his divine ordinance.
Thus ends the Ploweman.
The auctoure.

In the end of this book
Who so list for to look
Therein shall he se
A ballade that says this.
He that many books redes
Cunninge shall he be
Wisdom is sone cought
In many leaves it is sought
And some does it find
But sloth that no book bought
For reason takes no tought
His thryfte coms behind
And many one does say

That clerks ne tell may
What shall befall
They that this do report
Be of the pyuyshe sort
That little good can at all
They know that drink does slake the thurst
And when their eyes is full of dust
Yet may they sit and sheale peason
For and clerks show them books of cunning
They bid them lay them up a sonnynge
Unto other season.

And if we speak of Astronomy
They will say it is a great lie
For they can no other reason
But all that knows good and better
As gentlemen that loves sweet and swetter
Wisdom with them is not geason.
The prologue of the auctoure that put this book in wrytinge.


AS here before time there was a Sheparde keeping sheep in the fields, which
was no clerk, ne had no understanding of the letterall sense, nor of no
manner of scripture nor wrytinge, but of his natural wit and understanding
said. How be it that living and dyinge be all at the pleasure of almighty
God, yet man may live by the course of nature lxxii. years or more: this was
his reason. And he says as much time as a man has to grow in beauty,
length, bredthe, and strength. So much time has he to wax old, and feeble to
his end: But the term to grow in beauty, heyght, and strength, is xxxvi.
year and the term to wax old, feeble and weke, and turn to ye erthward,
which is in all to gether lxxii. year, that he ought to live by course of
nature. And they that dye before this time, often it is by vyolence and outrage
done to their complexion and nature. But they that live above this term is by
good regyment and ensygnements, after the which a man has governed him self.
To his purpose of living and dyeng, the said Shepard says that the thing that
we desire most in this world is to live long, and the thing that we most
fear is to dye soon, thus he trauayled his understanding, and made great
diligence to know and to do things possible and requisyce for to live long,
hole, and ioyously, which this present composte and calendar of Shepardes
showing and techynge, Wherefore we will show you of the bodies celestial, and
of their nature and mouynges, and this present book is named the compost, for
it comprehends sully all the compost, and more for the days hours and
momentes, and the new moons, and the eclyps of the son and the moon, and
the signs that the moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that
be no clerks to bring them to great understanding. He said also that the
desire to live long was in his soul, the which always lasts, wherefore he
would that his desire were accomplyshed after his death as a fore. He said sith
the soul dies not, and in her is the desire to live long it should be an
infallible peine, not to live after death as before, for he that lives not
after his corporal death shall not have that, that he has desired: yt is to
wit to live long, and should abide in eternal peine if his desire were not
accomplyshed. So concluded the said Sheparde necessary things for him and
other to know and do that which apperteyned to live after death as before. And
truth it is that he the which lives but the life of this world only, though
he lived an hundred year, he lived not properly long, but he ^huld live
long, that the end of this present life should begin the life eternal, that
is to say the life everlasting in heaven. So a man ought te per^ourme his
life in this world corporally, that they may live spiritually with out end.
For as he said one shall live everlasting without dyenge, and when he has
the perdurable life and shall be perfyte. And also by this point and none
otherwise shall be accomplished the desire of long living ^n this world. The
forsayde Sheparde also knowledged, that the life of ^his world was sone past
and gone: wherefore this Sheparde thought that xxii. years here in this vale of
wretched mysery is but a little and a small term (...) life, to the
everlasting, the which never shall have ending. And therefor he says, he
that offreth him self, here to live virtuously in this world. After this life
he shall receive the sweet life that is sure and lasts ever without end. For
though a man lyned here a C. years and more, it is but a little term to the
life to come. Therefore says this Sheparde. I will live soberly with these small
temporal goods that Jesus has lent me, and ever to exyle the desire of
worledly riches and worldley worship. For they that labors for it, and
have love to their goods, and vain worshyppes, Often it departs man fro the
heavenly treasure. It sh^tteth man's heart that God may not enter and byldeth man
a place of no rest in the low land of darkness.

Here after follows an other Prologue of the master Shepharde, that shows
and proves the auctours prologue true that is before rehearsed, and so the
Shepardes dispute one with another, but this that follows the master Sheparde
says to the other of the deuysion of this calendar. Capitulo ii.
Here begins the master Sheparde.


IT is to be understand, that there be in the year four quarters that is
called Uere, Hyems, Estas, and autumnus. Thief be the iiii. seasons in the
year. as Prymetyme is the spring of the year, as Feu^ryere, March, and
april. These three months.

Then comes Summer, as May, June, and July: and those three months, every
herb, grain and tree is in his kind, and in his most strength and fayrnesse
even at the highest.

Theu comes Automne, as August, Septembre, and October, that all these
fruytes waxes ripe, and be gathered and howsed.

Then comes Nouembre, December, and Ianyuere, and these three months be in
this winter, The time of little profit. We Shephardes say that the age of a
man is.lxxii. yere^ and that we lyken but to one hole year, for ever more we
take vi. year for every month, as Ianyuere, or Feuerycre, and so forth, for
as the year chau^geth by the xii. months, into xii. sundry manners so does a
man channge him self twelve times in his life, by twelve ages, and every age
lasts vi. year, if so be that he live to lxxii. for three times six makes
eightene, and six times six makes xxxvi. And then is man at the best and
also at the highest, and twelve times six makes.lxxii. and that is the age of
a man.

Thus must ye reken for every monethe six year, or else it may be
understand, by the four quarters and seasons of the year. So is divided man
in to four parties, as to youth, strength, wisdom, and age: He to be xviii.
year young xviii. year strong xviii. year in wisdom, and the fourth xviii.
year to go to the full of the age of lxxii.

And now to show how man changes.xii. times even as the xii. months do.
TAke the first vi. year for Ianyuere, the which is of no virtue nor strength
in that s^ason nothing on the earth grows. So man after he is borne till he
be six year of age is without wit strength or cunnyng, and may do nothing
that profyteth.

Then comes Feueryere, and then the days begenneth to wax in length, and
the son more hotter, then the fyeldes begins to wax green: So the other
six years till he come to twelve, the child begins to grow bigger and
serve and learn such as is taught him.

Then comes March, in the which the labourer sows the earth and planteth
trees, and edifyeth houses, the child in these vi. years, waxes big to lern
doctriue and science, and to be fair and honest, for then he is.xviii. years
of age.

After that comes April that the earth and the threes is covered in grene and
flowers, and in every party goods increases habundauntly, then comes the
child to gather the sweet flowers of hardynes, but then beware yt the cold
wyndes and storms of vices beat not down the flowers of good manners, that he
should bring man to honor, for then he is xxiiii. years old

Then comes May, that is both fair and pleasant, for then birds syngeth
in woods end forestes night and day, the son shyneth hot, and as then is
man most joyful and pleasant, and of deliver strength, and seeks plays,
sportes, and lusty pastyme, for then is he full xxx. year.

Then comes June, and then is the Son highest in his meridiornall, he may
ascend no hyer in his stacion, his glemeringe golden beams ripeth the corn,
and when man is xxxvi. year, he may ascend no more, for then has nature given
him beauty and strength at the full, and rypeth the seeds of parfyte
understanding.

Then comes July, that our fruytes been set a sonninge, and our corn a
hardenynge, but then the son begynnethe a little for to dyscende downewarde^
so man then goth fro youth toward age, and begins for to aquaynt him with
sadness, for then he is xlii. year.

After that then comes August: then we gather in our corn, and also the
fruytes of the earth. And then does man his diligence to gather for to find
him self withal, in the time that he may another get nor wyn, and the^ after
that vi. years is he.xlviii. year old.

Then comes Septembre: that wynes be made, and the fruits of trees be
gathered. And then therewithal he does freshly begin to garnyshe his house,
and make prouysion of needful things, for to live in winter which draws
very nere, and then is man in his most joyful and courageous estate prosperous
in wisdom, purposynge to gather and keep as much as should be sufficient for
him in his old age, when he may gather no more, and these vi. years makes
him liiii. years.

And then comes Octobre: that all is into the forsayde house gathered but
corn, and also other manner fruytes. And also the laborers sows new seeds
in the earth, for the year to come. And then he that sows naught, shall naught
gather. And then in there other vi. years a man shall take him self unto God
for to do penance and good works, and then the benefytes the year after his
death, he may gather and have spiritual profit, and then is man full in the
term of lx. years.

Then comes Nouembre: that the days be very short, and the son in manner
gives little heat, and the trees leseth their leaves. The fields that were
grene look hoar and gray. Then al manner of herbs be hid in the ground and then
appears no flowers. And then winter is come that the man has vn^derstandinge
of age, and has lost his kyndely heat and strength: His teeche begin to
rotte and also to chattre: and then has ho no more hope of long life, but
desires to come to the life everlasting, and these.vi. for this mouth makes
him.lxvi. years.

Then comes Decembre: full of cold with frost and snow, with great wyndes
and stormy wethere, that a man may not labor nor naught do: the son is the^
at the lowest that it may desce^de, the^ the trees and the earth is hi^ in
snow, the^ it is good to hold them ny the fyre^ and to spend the goods that
they gathered in summer. For then begins ma^s hear to wax white and gray,
and his body crooked and feeble, and then he leseth his perfyte understanding and
that vi. years makes him full lxxii. years, and if he live any more it is by
his good gydynge and dyetynge in his youth. How be if, it is possible that a
man may live till he be an hundred year of age. But there is but few that
comes thereto.

Wherefore I Sheparde said moreover, that of living or dyinge the heavenly
bodies may s^ere a man both to good and evil without doubt of assuce^ie. But
yet may man withstand it by his one freewyll, to do what he will him self
good or bad evermore. Above the which inclinacyon is the might and will of
God, that longs the life of man by his goodness, or to take it short by his
justice.

Wherefore we will show you of the bodies celestyall, and of their nature and
mouynges, and this present book is named the composte, for it comprehends
fully all the compost and more for the days, hours, and momentes and the new
moons, and the clippes of the sun and the moon, and of the signs that the
moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that be no clerks, to
bring them to great understanding.

And this kale^der is divided in v. parts.

The first of our signs of the compost and the calendar.

The second is the tree of vices with the peynes of hell.

The third is the way of health of man: the tree of virtues.

The fourth is physycke and governance of health.

The fyfte is Astrologye and physnomy, for to understand many disceauynges,
and which they be. By lykelyhod, the which by nature are inclyned and can do
them as ye shall read or ye come to the end.

For to have the Shepardes understanding of their calendar, ye should
understand that the year is the measure of the time that the Son passes the
xii. signs, retournynge to his first point, and is divided in the xii.
Months.

As Ianyuere, Feueryere, March, and so forth to December.

So the son in these xii. months passes by xii. signs one time.

The days of his entering into the signs in the calendar, and the days, also
when he parts the year, as the xii. months into lii. wekes.CCC.lxv. days,
and when by sext is, it is three score and vi. one day and xxiiii. hours,
every hour lx. mynnets. After these deuysyons, ye must understand for every
year three things.

The first speaks of golden nombre.

The second of the letter domynicall.

And the chyrde is the letter tabuler, in the which lies all the chief
knoweledge of this calendar, For the which letter and number to understand all that they would, whether it be past or to come, ye shall put three fygures
after the calendar, of the which: the first shall show the valor and
declaracyon of the two other, and it is to be understand that in four years,
there is one by ^exte, the which has one day more then other, and also has
two letters Dominicals sygned in one of the forsayde fygures, and changes the
late day of saint Mathewe, the which is vygyl, and is put with the day upon on
letter by him self.

Also the letters Feryals of this Calendar, is to be understand as they (...)
the other kalenders, before the which are the nombres, and the other three
o^^ter the letters ferials. First for because the letters dyscendeth low, is
the golden nombre above the day of the new moon. And the which to be the
hour and momentes of the said month, which when they are in service b^^fore
noone of the day above there. And when they are black service for afte^^noone
of the same day in the places of the nombre, betokenethe that nomb^^ where it
is. The natural day is to be understand fro midnyghte to my night xiiii.
hours, and shall serve the said nombres for the letters Fer^^als.xix. year
complete from the year that this kale^der was made.M.CCC^ xcvii. unto the
year.M.cccc. and xvi. In the which year shall begin (...) to serve this
golden nombre, and the other nombres after the letters Feryal^ all in the manner
as they be before for the other xix. years.

And all the remenaunt of the compost, and of the calendar is perpetua^^ For
the golden nombre, so shall they be.xxxviii. year, of the which years. M
CCCC.xcvii. is the first. The feasts of the calendar are in their days of
the which the solenuel are in read and storyed in the unity, nigh the which
unity in the end of the bodies above every day is one letter of the A.b. for
understand in what signs is the moon that day. And yet t^^ said letters
and the rybryshe, for the which shall be one figure before t^^ calendar, which
shall be show how they should understand it. This ye^^ of this present
calendar, which began to have course the first day of Ian^^uere.M.CCC.xcvii.
In the which raygneth for the golden nombre xv^^ The letter domycall A. The
letter tabuler f. and b. In the first lives a^^ their fygures nerest the golden
nombre xvi. the year of this calendar.

An ingenious practice or Compost of Shepardes.
Newly and subtelly Shepardes have found a short practike, for to know the
golden number, the letter dominicall, and the Tabuler letters as ensues, the
which for subtilitie is difficile to be understood, if first it be not showed
by such as understand it well, but as to this it behooves not to tarry and
travail for cause of the figures that ensigneth and shows how to find and
know the said practike.

Finis canos agur eius bona fructus
Dicens anni et bellica griffo dant amara
El cambet gaudit dat alit fiet color
Genitrix danos boabel flores cadat gelica
Edens busti.
Four secrets of the Compost of Shepardes.

How every month prayseth it self of some good property.
January.

I Make me to be called Ianyuere
In my time is great storms of coldenes
For unto me no month of the year
May compare if I advance me doubtless
For in my time was, as clerks do express
Circumcysed the Lord omnipotent
And adoured by kings of the Orient.
February.
I am February the most hardy
In my season the pure mother virginal
Offered her son in the temple truly
Making to God a present special
Of Jesus Christ the king of kings all
Between the arms of the bishop Simon
To whom pray we to have his remission.
March.
March am I called in noblesse florishinge
Whiih among months, am of great noblesse
For in my time all the fruits do budde and spring
To the service of man in great largess
And leuf is in, the time of holiness
That every man ought to have repentance
Of his sins done, by long continuance.
Apryll.
Among all months, I am lusty April
Fresh and wholesome, unto each creature
And in my time the dulcet drops distill
Called cristall as poets put in scripture
Causing all stones the longer to endure
In my time was the resurrection
Of God and man by diui^e election.
May.
Of all the months in the year I am king
Flourishing in beauty excellently
For in my time, in virtue is all thing
Fields and meades sprede most beauteou^^y
And birds singe with right sweet armony
Rejoicing lovers with hot love all endewed
With fragrant flowers, all about renewed.
June.

Who of my season takes right good head
Ought not at all, my name to adnull
For in my time, for all the commons wede
From sheep is shorn, all the flesh and wull
And had in marchaundyse, by great ships full
Over the sea, wherefore we ought to pray
Unto our Lord, and thank him night and day.
July.
If that my time were praised all a right
Among all months I am one of the chief
For I enripe through my great force and might
Fruits of the earth, to man and beasts relief
Feedyng horses, kyne, muttons, and strong biefe
With other properties that I could tell
But I must pass I may no longer dwell.
August.
I am named the hot month of August
For redolent heat of Phoebus brightness
In my time each man ought for to have lust
To labor in harvest, with great busynes
To repe and sheffe, eschewing ydlenes
And rise early with perfyte dyligence
Thanking our Lord of his great providence.
September.
Who can my name perfitely remember
With the commodities of my season
Ought of right to call me September
Plenteous of goods by all manner reason
As wheat, rye, o^es, beans, ^ytches, and peason
Of which fruit every man ought to have in store
To live directly, and thank our Lord therefore.
October.
Among the other October I hight
Friend unto vinteners naturally
And in my time Bacchus is ready dight
All manner wine to press and clarify
Of which is sacred as we see daily
The blessed body of Christ in flesh and blood
Which is our hope, refection and fode.

I November will not abide behind
To show my kindly worthynesse and ure
For in my time the blastes of the wind
Abateth leaves and stedeth their verdure
Wherefore every prudent creature
Ought for to live right as they would dye
For all thing takes end naturally.
December every man does me call
In whose time the mother inuiolate
Delivered was in an old ox stall
Of Jesus Christ Gods own son incarnate
Wherefore I think me the most fortunate
Of all the other, to whom pray we then
That we may come unto his bliss. Amen.
The first Primetime that thus does begin
From myd February unto myd May
And from myd May, Summer is entered in
To myd August, and then is harvest day
And from that time, Winter enters always
On saint Clementes day, who so takes head
And myd February it fails in deed.
Thus ends the praise of the twelve months, with the beginniuges and ends
of the four quarters. And after follows the figure for to know in what sign
the Moon is every day.
(...) and the declaration is of the letters of the sign of the ka(...)

By this figure here above, a man may know in what s^gne the Moon is every
day, and the declaration is of the (...) letters that been in the calendar at
the ends of the lines, and be named the letters of the signs, wherefore mark
well first the letter of the calendar on the day that we would have, then look
out the said letter in the figure here above in the line discendinge under the
golden number that runs.

Then look at the headde of the lines, where as is written the names of the
signs, and it that beholds directly ouertwharte the figure to the said
letters is it that the Moon is in that day. And like as one golden number for
a year, so the said line under the golden number serves alone for the same
year as in the year of his calendar we have.xvi. for the golden number, the
line under.xvi. serves all the said year, and when we have.xvii. the line
under.xvii. shall serve to the year that.xvii. is for the golden number, and
so forth of the other.

VT celum signis presurgens est duodenis
Sichominis corpus assimulatur eis
Nam caput et facies. Aries sibi gaudit habere
Gutturus et coll^ius tibi. Taure detur
Brachia cum manibus. Geminis sunt apta decentur
Naturam Canc^i pectoris aula gerit
At Leo vult stomacum renis sibi vendicat idem
Sed in testinis Uirgo preesse petit
Ambas Libra nates, ambes sibi vendicat hancas
Scorpio vult anum vultque pudanda sibi
Inde Sagittarius is coxis vult dommari
Amborum genum vim Capricornus habet
Regnat in aquario crurtum vis apta decentur
Piscibus et demum congrua planta pedum.
Saturnus niger. Jupiter ^iridis. Mars rebeus est. Sol croteus. Uenus albus.
Marcurius et Luna varti sunt dum quisquis regnat nascitur, puer sic coloratus.

The declaration of the latin here above.
THat is to say, that the.xii. signs has domination over the body of man
divided by the parts, as the signs deuideth the firmament, and every sign
beholds and governs the parts of the body, so as it is said above, and
afterward shall be showed by fygures, and is declared more plainly and
faithfully. Such like of planets is said of their colors, but of their
natures and properties of the parts of the bodies the which governs and
beholds, more at full shall ye hear at length.

Also of the.xii. months natures, March, April, and May, are very hot and
moist, that signifies blud and air. June, July, and August, is summer and
signifies hot and dry choler, manhood, and fear. September, October, and
November, is harvest, and betokens cold and dry, and age, melancoly and
earth. December, January, and February, is winter, and betokens cold and
moist, childehode, fleume, and water.


CAlled I am Iauyuere the cold
In Christmas season good fire I love
Young Jesus, that sometime Judas sold
In me was circumcised for man's behoue
Three kings sought the son of God above
They kneeled down and hyd him homage with love
To God their Lord that is man's own brother.
Hereafter follows a calendar with the fygures of every saint that is hallowed
in the year, in the which is the figures, the hours, the momentes, and the
new Moons. Capitulo.iii.

NO marvel that man's mind is mutable
And will you know wherefore and why
For he is made of things varyable
As of hot, cold, moist, and dry
The wit is light, it passes lightly
And sith we be made of four chaungeable
How should man be steadfast and stable.
An eclypse shall be marvelous to behold
Through which many shall be the wurse
For many shall find neither silver ne gold^
It shall be so dark within their purse.

Here after follows the second part of the compost and calendar, which
shows of the trees of vices, and of the pains of hell. Cap. vii.


IN the name of the father, the son, and the holy Ghost. Amen. We purpose to
show the trees of vices, for sinners to take example by, for to understand
their sins. The which is divided in.yii. pryncipall parts after the.vii.
deadly sins, and each deadly sin is lykened to a tree, and every tree
having.vii. small branches, and all these.vii trees comes out of one tree by
it self that is evil, and comes of one beginning, and that is the devil,
and it bydeth an end, that is everlasting damnation, which is ordained for all
them that seek not remedy betymes by penance and repentance of their life in
time.

And after these trees of vices follows the pains of hell, to show the lay
people what punyshmente is ordained for every deadely sin, and that the
people may the better show their sins in confession, and make clean their
conscience, and that they may be the house of God, so that virtues may grow
and fructify to the profit of their souls. The first great branch of the
tree of vices is Pride, and he has.xvii branches growing out of him. As of
vain glory of him self. Uayne glory of the world. Praising him self in
evil. Bostinge of sin. Inobedyence. Disdain. To tempte God. Excess.
Dispraysinge. False goodness. Hardynesse. Presumption. Rebellion. Obstinacion.
Sin wittingly. Communynge of the Sacrament. Shame to do good. Out of every
of the which branches spryngeth three branches, and out of every of the said
three branches grows three small branches, to the number of seven score and
thyrtene, and in so many manners and ways ye may sin in the sin of Pride,
the which is the root and beginning of all the seven deadly sins. And
therefore it shall be showed first of Pride, and after the other six sins
as they follow in order.

The first branch of pride. Uaine glory of himself.
Seeking joy and not the glory of God.
When any weneth yt his goods comes of himself Or that such goods be due for
their merits If they believe to have, or know more the^ they do
Hipocrisy.
Dissembling by words to be better then they be Seming by works to be good and
be not, Desir^^g praise for his good deeds by other
Dispraysinge them self for to have praising.
To dispraise his deeds yt other should praise them To repent his doings because
they be dispraised Dispraising him self that other may praise him

The second branch of pride. Uaine glory of the world
For riches.
When they wene to be better for their goods, Or weneth to be worse without
them To be ashamed yt they lack riches in their need
For pompes.
Delighting him to have a great household Rejoicing them in the fair shape of
their bodies Or in new fashion, or multitude of his clothes
For honors.
When they desire to be honored with others good Willing to be honored and
dread Or to the end it may be said that they be mighty

The third branch of pride. Glad of evil doing.
Declaring their sins.
For to be praised of cursed and unhappy people Or for to show that they be
prompt to evil doing Delighting in recordation of his evil deeds
Being glad that they be evil.
For that they love the friendship of the world Or for they dout not the
righteousness of God Or else they love not God with their heart
To have no shame of evil doing.
For they know not which is virtue ne vice Nor to amend themselves be not
willing For to be seen gladly when he does evil.

The fourth branch of pride. Bosting of sin.
Praising thy self.
Openly before all folks or few Or secretly before one, or by himself. Seking
occasion for to be praised only
In showing the^ self better then they be.
Covering their evils, that they be not seen Telling their good deeds yt they
may be known Hiding their sins that they apere not great
W^ening that they be wise and be not.
To be great in judgment with him self only Dispraising the understanding
of other Presuming their own virtue the grace of God.

The.v. branch of pride. Inobedience.
Openly again-saying.
Dispraysinge his master or the^ that be above him Dispraysing the merits
that come of obedience Desyring to be such that he may gaynesay other
Doing unduly all that they ought to do.
When neglige^tly thy do that, that thy ought to do Or when they do it
otherwise then apperteyneth Or for to let damage, and to have profit
For to require grace importunate.
When they have custom in sin and fall often therein Enuiously and frowardly
asking grace for it Insaciatly perseuering without amending.

The.vi. branch of pride. Disdain.
Dispraysing other.
For their ignorance and fault of understanding For their poverty and
scarsenes of riches For their sickness and de^^ute of members
Preferringe themselves before other.
Showing him self conning in some works In praising their deeds disprayse
them of other In considering of less then he exalt himself
Dispraysing other less then himself.
That will compare themself for riches or science Or they which be almost as
great as he Or which in things abouesaid are above him.

The.vii. branch of pride. To tempt God.
Desiring to sinful living.
For they consider but sensible things For they will not believe things that
they see not To judge things to come or they happen.
To expose them self in peril.
To believe them self that god should deliver them Or to disprayse and die in
such dangerous peril or believe in destenies that otherwise it may not be
Not helping them selves fro peril.
For they will use no reason for to help themself For they will use their own
folly without counsel For they be to slothful, not willing to labor.

The viii. branch of pride. Excess.
To go before thy betters unworthily.
Usurping the might that they ought not to have Exceeding the power to them
committed or given Treating them evil that be under their puissance
To abstain the^ over much.
For they ben less worthy in such authority For they are to cruel to them

Explicit.
Here ends the branches of all the.vii. deadly sins, as they be before
rehearsed, with all the small branches. Also showing how that three comes of
the great branches each by him self. And out of them three grows.ix. and so
every branch has small sprayes springyng out of them. So there is no man ne
woman lyuinge, but he synneth venially as it is written. Sepcie^ in die cadet
iustus. Lo if the righteous man do sin.vii. times a day by venial sins,
then we wretched sinners how often do we sin in a day. God wot full often. But
yet for venial sin is many remedies. Also for deadly sin is few remedies,
and but four specially, as Confession, Contricion, Satisfaction, and penance.
But the first is, thou must be sorry for thy sins. Secondly to make a meke
confession. Thirdly, do satisfaction. And fourthly perform thy penance
adjoined by the confessor, for penance is debt that we must pay to God for
our sin committed, and therefore never look to have forgeuenes of thy sins
without repentance. Also sin is perilous before our Lord Jesus Christ for.iii.
manner of reasons. The first he gives no warning when he smites thee. The
second, for as he finds thee, so will he judge thee. The third when thou
art dead remedy is past and gone.

Here follows the pains of hell comminatories of sins, to punish the
sinners, as Lazarus recompted after that he was risen, as he had seen in the
parties infernals, as it appears by these fygures ensuing one after an other.
Capitulo.viii.


OUr Savior and redemer Jesus Christ, a little before his blessed Passion,
being in Bethanye, entered into the house of a man named Simon, for to take his
corporal refection. And as he was sytting at the table with his Apostles and
Disciples, there being Lazarus brother to Mary Magdalene and Martha, the which
our Lord had raised from death to life. The which thing Simon douted, and
prayed our Lord for to command Lazarus to show before the assistentes what
he had seen in the other world. And our lord gave him leave to speak. And then
the said Lazarus recounted how that he had seen in the parties infernalles of
hell many great and intolerable pains, where as sinful men and women were
payned. First of Pride, and consequently of all the.vii. deadly sins, each
pain by him self.

First said Lazarus I have seen in hell wheles right hie, set on an hill, the
which was to look on in manner of mylles, incessantly turning about by great
impituosity, roaring and whirling as it were thunder. And the wheles were fyxed
full of hooks and crampions of Iron and steel, and on them were hanged and
turned the proud men and women for their Pride, with their prince, captain
and master Lucifer.



Pride among all other sins is a king, a captain, and master. And as a
king has a great company of people, in the same manner has pride a great
company of vices And as a king keeps that which is his, in likewise does pride
keep the proud folk that be in his jurisdiction. Great sign of reprobacion
it is for to persevere long in pride Pride then is a sin that displeases God
above all other sins, as much as humility pleases him among virtues. And
there is no sin that makes a man more semblable to the devil then pride
does. For the proud man will not be as the other men, but he must be as the
Pharisien with the devil. And for that the proud man will enhaunce him self
above other men, the devil does with him as the crow having a hard nutte in
his byl, the which he may not crack, she bears it up a hye in the air, and
then lets it fall upon a stone whereon it breaks, and then she discendeth
and eats it. In likewise the devil reyseth the proud man and woman for to
let them fall in the hard pains of hell. As much difference is between pride
and humility, as the chafe and the corn, for the chafe is light and
mounteth hye, and the wind caryeth it about and so it is lost, and the corn
which is heavy abides low on the ground, and is gathered up and put in
garners of the fermour, and is kept for the common profit, and the chafe is
brent, lost, and de^oured of beasts. And in this wise are the proud people
raised and enhaunsed through the entisement of the fiende of hell, and then fall
down by the moist rain of death, which makes them heavy, and causes them to
tomble by the strength of their superbious blastes into the forneyse
everlasting, and there to be brent and devoured with the horrible beasts of
hell.



Secondly said Lazarus I have seen in hell a fiudde frosen as yse, wherein the
envious men and women were plunged unto the nauill, and then suddenly came over
them a right cold and a great wind, that grieved and payned them right sore,
and when they would euite and eschew the wonderful blastes of the wind, they
plunged into the water with great shoutes and cries lamentable to hear.

These be the Envious people.


Envy is doloure and sorrow of the heart, of the felicity and prosperytie of
other, the which sin is soueraignely cursed, for that it is contrary to
Charity, that is soueraygne head of all virtues, whereby it is great sign of
reprobacyon, for by it the fiendes know them that shall be dampened, as
Charity is sign of salvation, and whereby God knows who shall be saved.
Enuyous people ben fellows unto the devil. For if so be that an Enuyous man
do win, then is he very glad, and if he leese he is full angry with them.
Enuyous folk ben so infette and corrupt that good odoures to them stynketh,
and sweet things unto them seems sower, in likewise is the good name and
prosperity of other But stinking things and sower to them be sweet, the which
ben vices, reproaches, adversities, and evil fortunes that they know or hear
said of other. The Envious folk seek their wealth in the adversity of other,
as when of the harm of other they seek the good in rejoicing them, but with
this they be not yet satisfied, but of a new they be tormented, for they have
not such joy without displeasance and affliction at their heart, whereby they be
tormented. For he that seeks his wealth in the adversity of an other, is like
to him that seeks the fire in the bottom of a water, or that looks for woll
on an vrchins back, the which things be but all follyes and abusions. Envy is
but the goods and felicities of this world, for the cursed sin of envy may
not ascend into heaven. It is a sin difficile to heal, for it takes toote
and is fyxed in the heart secretly, wherefore it is hard and impossible for to
be done away by medicine, wherefore with great pains is any made hole that is
infected with it. The envious men's toungs be likened unto a three edged sword
that hurts and cutteth three manner of ways. The first he hurts and
wounds his own soul. The second him that he tells his tale unto. And
thirdly he sleyeth him by whom he felleth his cursed tale.

Thus ends Envy, and follows the history of Wrath.
Wrath.


Thirdly said Lazarus I have seen in hell a great cave tenebrous and obscute,
full of tables like Bochers stalles, or a great bochery, where as Irefull men
and women were through pierced with trenchynge knyues and sharp glayues, and
with long spears perced their bodies, wherewith the most horrible and
fearful bochers of hell hewed and detrenched them with their glayues and
knyues impiteously without ceasing.



SO as peace makes the conscience of a man to be the dwellinge place of God,
so cursed wrath makes it the habitation of the devil. Wrath efisketh and
leseth the eye of reason, for in a wrathful man reason is banished, there is
nothing that keeps so much the image of God in man, as sweetness, peace, and
love, for almighty God will be there as peace and concord is, but wrath chaseth
the^ fro man, so that our lord may have no abiding. The wrathful man is like to
a Demoniacle, the which has the devil within him, causing him to torment and
strive with himself, foming at the mouth, and gnasshing with his teeth, for
the intolerable pain the which the enemy does to him. In likewise the
wrathful man is tormented by wrath, and does oftentimes worse then the
Demoniacle, for without patience they beat the one with the other, saying
injuries, reproaches, vyllanies, and give them selves to the devil body and
soul, and say and do many unlawful and domageable things. By wrath sometime
the devil gets an hole generation or all a coun^rey. When wrath is set,
then comes noise, and then vengaunce that destroys and leeseth all, the
which happens sometime through one wrathful man, as an yreful dog the which
mo^ed and put strife among other. The fysher troubles the water that the fysh
may not see his net, to the end that they may go therein and be taken. In
likewise the devil troubles the man by wra^h, to the end that he know not
the harm that he commised by his wrathful heart and courage.

Fourthly said Lazarus, I have scene in hell an horrible hall dark and
tenebrous, wherein was a great multitude of serpents bygge and small, where as
slothful men and women were tormented with bytings and stingings of venomous
worms, the which perced them through in diverse parts of their bodies, wounding
them to the heart with inextinguible pain.



Of slothful people.
Sloth is tristesse of spiritual goods, that should be ordained to God,
wherfeore they love to serve God as they ought to do, with heart and mouth, and
by good operacyons, who that will love God ought to know him redemptour and
Savior of all goodness that we have had and received every day, knowledging
our selfs sinners. Great folly it is when by sloth in the time of this breniate
life, we gather not goods for the life eternal. But in these days many one
be slothful to do well, and diligent to do evil, so that if they were
diligent to do well, as they be to do evil, they were right happy. Also sloth
is the beginner of sin, and a great enemy to God, for he lets men and
women to serve God, and to know their maker and redeemer, and sender of all
goodness that they have here, they be great fools that be so slothful here
in this little time of this short life, that will gather no goods to bring
the soul to everlasting life. But now a days people be slothful in doing
of good, and full dilygent to evil, and if they were as diligent to do good as
evil, they were full of grace. Now he that will think as after his death is
not wise, for then he shall have but the good d^edes that he has done in his
life before, then shall he sorrow and plain of the time that he has lost by
sloth, and shall sorrow that he did no good deeds when he had time and space
here in this world.

Here ends the.v. pain of hell. And follows the.vi. pain of hell.
Couetise.


Fyfthly said Lazarus, I have seen in the infernal parties a great number of
wide cauderons and kettels full of boylynge lead and Oil with other hot
metalles molten, in the which were plunged and dypped the Couetyse men and
women, for to fulfill and replenish them of their insaciate couetise.

The covetous men and women.
COuetyse is a great sin and a wicked in the sight of God. For the covetous
man imagines more to get a penny, then the love of God. And had lever lose God
then one half penny. For often times for a little thing he lyethe and
forswereth him self and sins deadly. The faith, hope and the charity that
would be in God the covetous man puts in his richesse. First faith, for he
believes to ^aue such things, the which be necessary for him, sooner for his
goods then (...) the gift of God, as if that God might not help him, or as
if God had ^o solicitude of his servants.

Also the covetous man has hope to have the more joy and consolations by his
riches, then God may give him. And also the covetous man sets al his heart on
his goods and not on God, and thus the covetous man and woman has their
charity in their rich chestes, cofers, and bags. The couetousman has his
heart on his goods more the^ one God. There as is the heart, there is the love,
and love is charytie, and so covetous men has their hertes on their goods.
The covetous man synneth gatherynge his good, and in using it evil, and in
loving it over much, and sometimes better then he does God, the covetous man
is taken in the net of the devil, by the which he leseth everlasting life,
for small temporal goods, as the bird does go into a pytfall for a worm and
leseth his life, and as the mouse is taken in a fall or trappe, and leseth his
life for a little bacon. The covetous men and women bin like curres or dogs,
the which that keeps carren, and when their bellyes be full they lie down by
it, and keeps away the birds that they may not eat, but dies for hunger for
fault of that the curres has to much. In likewise the covetous men
withholdeth the goods that pore men may get none, and lets them dye for
hunger, and holds them in their subjection, and the devil holds the rich
men in his subjection that does the pore men wrong.

Thus ends the pain for the covetous men.
And here follows the vi. pain of hell.
Lazarus.


The vi. pain said Lazarus Gluttony.
that I have seen in a vale a flodde soul and flynkynge at thee brymme, in the
which was a table with towels right dyshonestly, where as Gluttons been fed
with Todes and other venomous beasts, and had to drink of the water of the
same said fludde.



THe throat is the gate of the body of man, so when enemies will take the
castle, if they may win the gate, they will lightly have all the Castle. So
when the devil may win the throat of a man by Glottony, easily he will have
the remenant and enter into the ^ody accompayned of sins. For the Glottons
consents unto all vices. and for this cause it were of necessity to have a
good guard at the gate, that ^he devil enter not. For when one holds the
horse by a bridle, he may led ^ym where he will, so does the devil the
glottonous man where him list. The servant that is over easily norished
rebelleth often against his master. The bellye over filled with drink and
meat, is rebel to the soul, so that it ^oyl do no good operatyons. By
glottony many bin dead which might have ^^ued longer, and so they have bin
homicide of the^ self, for excess of to much (...) and drynkinge corrupts
the bodies and engendrethe sycknesses, the which often a brydgeth and shorteth
the lives. And they that noryshethe well the flesh prepares meat for worms,
and so the gloto^ is coke of worms A man of worship would be ashamed for to be
coke of a great Lord. More ashamed should he be, to be a coke for worms. They
that live after the desire of flesh, lives after the rule of the swyne in
eatinge without measure like an unreasonable beast. This is the hog as it
were an abbot over glotonous people, of whom they hold their order and regule,
whereby they bin constrained to keep them in their cloister, that is in the
tavern and ale houses. And likewise as the hog their Abbot lyethe in a
rotten dungehill or in the myry puddle, so do they always lie in the stynkyng
infection of Glottony, til they be dronken and without wit.

The vii. pain said Lazarus, I have seen a feelde full of deep wells
replenyshed with fire and s^lphre, wherout issued smoke thycke and co^tagious
wherein all lecherous persons were tourmented incessauntly with deuyls.



OF all the vii. deadly sins. Lecherye pleases most unto the devil. For it
fyleth and corrupts both the body and the soul together, and by Lechery the
devil wynneth two sowles at once. And many lecherous persons will auaunte
them self, and say that they may not have their full desire and lust of
that sin. Lecherous men and women be more disfourmed and ugly then the
devil, in the superhabundaunce of that sin. He is a foolyshe marchaunte that
makes a bargeyne, of the which he knows well that he shall lose thereby, and
repent him of his bargayne making. In like manner of wise, each Lecherous man
has great pain, and spends his goods and his understanding to fulfill and
accomplish his lusts and delytes, and after repents him of his expense, and
yet the worste is, he is in danger of his foul till he be repentaunt, and do
sufficient penance. The Lecherous men and women lyuinge been tourmented with
three infernal peynes, as heat, slynke, and remors of their conscience. For
they be hot by concupiscence. They be stynkynge for their immundicitie. For
such sin is all stynkynge and maculeth the body and soul, which all other
sines fyleth but the soul.

Also they be not without remors of conscience for the offense that they have
done to God. Lecherye is the pytte of the devil, wherein he makes sinners to
fall. To the which many helps the devil to cast them self in it, when
wyllinglye they go to the brymme knowinge that the devil will cast them in.
Good it is not to harken women, better it is not to beholden them, and much
better it is not to touch them. To this sin^e belongs foul words, bylayne
songs, dyshoneste touchynges, the which abhors not bawdes, hatlottes,
hores, and such as frequenteth and perseuereth in the same.

Thus ends the vii. deadly sins, fygured each by him self like as Lazarus
had seen in the parts Infernalles.
Here after follows the third part of the Calendar and composte of
Shephardes. Salutarye science, and gardyn of virtues. Capitulo ix.


VUho that will have on a piece of earth great habundaunce (...) fruit,
first they ought to take away all things that bin no^ some, and after
labor it well, and then sow good seeds. I^ likewise a man should labor
and cleanse his conscience of (...) his sins, labor by holy meditacions and
sow virtues an^ good operations, for to gether fruit of everlasting life.

Then sithe that here before has been spoken of vices rudely and lyght^^ now
it behooves hereafter to speak of virtues in the third part of this
pr^^sente book, the which shall be as a little garden pleasant, full of trees
an^ flowers. In the which the conte^platyue person may sport and play, and by
goo^ ensignementes gather sundry virtues, and edifye him self in good exercise
wherewith his soul shall be enorned and ordained before his spouse Jesus Christ
when he shall come to vysyte and dwell with him. In the beginning of th^^
which party shall be the Orayson domynicall of our Lord, with the declar^^tyon
the better to understand it, and the said party shall conteyne vi. pa^^ties.
The first party shall be the declaration of the said prayer. The second of the
salutacion Angelyke that Gabriell made to Mary when she conceaue^ her child
Jesus. The iii. shall be of the xii. articles of our faith. The iiii. shall be of
the x. commandments of the law. The fyfth shall be of the Field of virtues:
For the first ye ought to know that by the oraison of our lord, that is the
Pater noster, when we say it we demand of God suffysaunce of all things
necessaay for to salute and help of our souls and of our bodies, not only for
us, but for all other. And for all this cause we ought to have the said
orayson in great co^te^placion, and say it with great devotio^ unto God. And
unto young people it should betaught and said to them, for though they
understand it not, yet it profyteth the^ to have the kyngedome of heaven. And
they say it in perfyte love and charity, In the Pater noster, we ask vii.
peticions. By each peticion we may understand vii. other things. As the vii,
Sacraments of holy Church. The vii. gifts of the holy ghost. The vii.
armures of justice spiritual. The vii. virtues princypall that we should
exercise. The seven works of mercy bodily. The vii. works of mercy ghostly.
The vii. deadlye sins that we should dread. The declaration is this, Our
father that art in heaven thy name be made holy. In his peticion, we ask of
god our father to be his sons, for otherwise we can not be called his sons,
nor be our father, and that his name may be made by us more holyer then any
other thing, wherefore we receive the sacrament of baptism, without that, man
may not be made the son of God, and to receive the virtue of meknesse against
pride, and the^ to clothe the naked, and help the nedy both bodily and
ghostly. The ii. is, thy kingdom come to us is this peticion. In so much thy
name of God may not be perfitely hallowed of us in this world we ask his
realm. In the which perfitely we shall halowe it, for to that kingdom we be
very heirs. This peticion is the sacrament of priesthod, by the which we are
taught to good works, and the gift of the holy ghost is the gift of
understanding, for to understand and desire the kingdom of heaven, and we arm
us with the helm of largenes against coueteous. The iii. peticion is thy will
be done in the earth as it is in heaven. For it is the faithful will of God
that his will should be fulfilled that is his commandment, by this peticion
we make obeysau^ce to God in our hertes, when we desire to do his will. By this
is understand the sacrament of Marriage, by the which we avoid fornication,
and the gift af counsel of the holy ghost for to order our obeisance
veritably. And so we arm us with the armoure of salvation against envy. The
fourth peticion is, our daily bread give us this day. Here we ask of God to
be sustained with material bread for our bodies, and spiritual bread for our
souls, that is the bread of life, the body of Jesus Christ, the which we
receive by faith, in mind of his passion. The ghyft of the holy ghost is
strength to be faithful in our belief, take we the sword of patience
against the sin of ire, and vysyte the sick men bodily, and use virtue of
temperaunce against wrath. the fyfte pety^ion is, forgive us our sins as we
forgive all men, for trust well, he that will not forgive for the love of
Godde, God will never forgive him his sins. And these.iii. peticions folowinge
we ask of God to be delivered from al evil, as of the sin that we have done
deadely, and by these we ask of God to be assoyled and to give us pardon by
his mercy, by the which we understand the sacrament of penance and
forgyuenisse of sin the holy ghostes gift is science for to understand the
works of mercy and to escapt sin. And so clothe us with lightness against
couetyse, and comfort pore prisoners and give good council to them that ask
and need it, and take the virtue of faith against couetyse. The vi. peticion is
suffer us not to be overcome in temptacion by the second evil that is not
done, but it may happen and we fall by the way of temptacion. Here we ask of
God to be steadfast in the faith, and that we may gladly do good works in the
virtue of hope and strength to do good deeds, and withstand temptacion to the
which profyteth to us the sacrament of confirmation which gives to us the
knowledge of God by the virtue of verity. The gift of the holy ghost, and so
take we the spear of soberness against glotony, and comfort pilgrims by
virtue of hope. The vii. peticion is to deliver us from all evil. Amen. The
third evil, is evil of pain that sinners may have if they serve not God,
and by this peticion we ask that we may be delivered from all peynes, and
saved in Paradyce, unto this say we all. Amen. By these we ask, so it be done
as we desire. By the which we receive the sacrament of the later anoyntynge,
that gives us the sure way of salvation, the gift of the holy ghost is dread
of judgments of God, and gyrde us with the gyrdle of chastity against
lechery, and burye we them that be dead bodily, and pray for our enemies
ghostly, get we in us the virtue of charity, and eschew the sin of lechery.

Thus ends the Salutary science and garden of virtues.
And hereafter follows an other declaration of the Pater noster. Capitulo.x.


OUr Father right merueylous in his creation sweet and louinge rich of al
goods that been in heaven, myrrour of trinity, crown of iocunditie, and
tresure of felicity. Holy be thy name and sweet as honey in our mouth, thou
art the melodyous harp that causes devotion to sownde in our ears, and to
have it continually by the desire of our hearts. Thy realm come to us. In the
which we shall be ever in joy and rest, without trouble, and sure never to lose
it^ Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. As to love all that thou
loueste, and to hate all that thou heatest, and that we keep evermore thy
commandments. Our daily bread give us to day, that is to say bread of
doctrine, bread of penance, and bread for our bodily sustentacion. And
forgive us al our sins, that we have done, against thee, against our
neighbors, and against our self. Semblably as we forgive other that have
offended to us, by words, on our bodies, or our goods, And suffer not that we
be overcome in temptacio^, that is to say, as by the devil, the world, and
the flesh. But deliver us from all evil works ready done, and also them for
to come, Amen.

Here follows the story of the Pater noster.
OUR Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Let thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, as well in earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespaces, as we forgive our trespacers. And
lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil. For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.


IN the storye here before, shows to simple people how this holy prayer the
Pater noster: should be said to God the father, and to god the son, and ye god
to holy ghost. And to none other. The which prayer conteyneth and takes all
that be rightfully asked of God, and our lord Jesus Christ made it there to the
intent that we should (...), and devotion, and he made it on a time when he
taught his apostles, specially to make orayson. And then the disciples said
Lord and master learn us to pray, and then our lord opened his holy mouth
and said to his apostles when ye will make any prayers, after this manner as
here follows, shall you begin saying thus.

Our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name. Thy kyngedome come. Thy
will be done in yearthe as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
us, and let us not be let into temptacion. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

Here after follows the salutacyon that the Angel Gabriell made to the
glorious virgin Mary, with the greeting of the holy woman S. Elisabeth.

Hayle Mary full grace, our lord is with thee.

Blessed be thou of all women, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus.



Secondely in the book of Jesus, the salutacyon in such.
Hayle Mary full of grace our lord is with thee. Blessed be thou among all
woman, and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus Christ. Amen.

The salutacion of the Aungel Gabriell.


IN this salutacion is three mysteries. The first is the salutacio^ that the
Angel Gabriel made. The second is the louinge commendacio^ that S. Elisabeth
made, mother to S. John Baptyst. The iii. is the supplication yt our mother
holy Church makes And they be ye most fairest words that we can say to our
Lady: that is the Aue Maria, wherein we salve her, praise her, pray her, and
speak to her. And therefore it is only said to her, and not to saint Kathrine,
nor to saint Margarete nor to none other saint. And if thou demand how thou
may then pray to other saints I say to the thou must pray as our mother
holy Church prays in saying to S. Peter Holy S. Peter pray for us. S.
Thomas pray for us. That they may pray to God to give us grace, and that he
forgive us our sins. And that he give us grace to do his will and penance,
and keep his commandments, and so we shall pray to the saints in heaven
after the necessity that we have.

S. Peter, S. Andrewe, S. James the great, saint John, S. Thomas, S. James the
less, S. Philyp, S. Bartylmewe, S. Mathewe, S. Simon, S. Jude, and S. Mathias.

Thyrdly in the book of Jesus is salutary science, and is the Credo which we
ought to believe on pain of dampnation. Capitulo x.


I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus
Christ his only son our Lord which was conceived of the Holy ghost, and
suffered passion under Ponce Pilate, crucified, buried, went into hell, the iii.
day rose from death. Ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the
father.



And after shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy
ghost, the Holy Catholyke church, the communion of saints, and remission of
sins. The rysynge of the flesh. The everlasting life, Amen.

Saint Peter put the first article and said. I believe in God the Father
almighty creator of heaven and of earth. Saint Andrewe put to the ii. and
said. I beliue in Jesus Christ his only son our lord. Saint James the
great put to the iii saying, I believe that he was conceived of the holy
ghost, borne of the virgin Mary. Saint John put to the iiii. saying. I believe
that he suffered passion under Ponce Pylate, was crusifyed, dead, and buried.
Saint Thomas put to the v. saying. I believe that he descended into hell, and
the third day arose from death to life. Saint James the less put to the vi.
saying. I believe that he ascended into heaven and sytteth on the right hand
of God the father omnipotent. Saint Phylip put to the vii. saying I believe
that after he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. Saint Bartylemewe
put to the.viii. saying. I believe in the holy ghost. Saint Mathewe put too
the ix. saying I believe in the holy Church Catholyke. Saint Simon put to the
x. saying, I believe the communion of saints and remission of sins. Saint
Jude put to the.xi. saying. I believe the resurrec^ion of the flesh. Saint
Mathias put to the xii. saying. I believe the life eternal. Amen.

Here follows the Creed as it ought to be said.
I Believe in God the father almighty creator of heaven and of earth, And in
Jesus Christ his only son our Lord. That was conceived of the holy ghost,
borne of the virgin Mary. Suffered passion under Ponce Pylate, crucyfyed, dead
and buried. Descended into hell, and the third day arose from death. Ascended
into heaven, and sytteth on the right hand of God the father omnipotent. And
after shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the holy ghost.
The holy church Catholic. The communion of saints, remission of sins.
Resurrection of the flesh and the life eternal. Amen.

This Creed was made and composed by the xii. Apostels of our lord, of ye which
every Apostle has put to his article, as is here above showed in the said
Creed, as much as one of one part as of the other, and our faith catholic is
contained in the said xii. articles, yt is the beginning of our health, without
the which none may be sa^ed, ne do nothing that is agreeable unto God, and
faith ought to be at the ^arte by knowledge of God. In the mouth by confession
and praysinges to him (...) work by exerceysinge of his commandments and
good works, and the which shows them that so does to have true faith and
life, that is to say to ^aue them. And how well that faith in heart be good,
that in the mouth also, ^euerthelesse the best is that which lies in good
works that one does, and is ^he same faith that lies in the heart and mouth,
for there is but one faith, and ^ne God. And this same Creed ought to be had
and known of every man and woman having age competent and understanding of
reason, and ought for ^o say it both in the morning and in the euenyng every
day devoutly, for it is of ^^ght great devotion. Therefore a good Christen man
as soon as he ryseth from his bed, and is arayde and clothed, kneleth beside
his bed or other where, and first blesses him with the sign of the cross,
and then says. Credo in deum, Or I believe in God the father almighty, as is
above said. Then after the Pater noster to God. And to our Lady the Aue Maria:
and afterward reco^maunde him to his good Angel in making prayer to him
saying My good Angel I require thee to keep me and govern me. In likewise
when he goes to rest at night. And so at the least twyse in the day, at the
morrow and in the evening.

Fourthly in the book of Jesus is the x. commandments of the law, that God
gave to Moses on the mount of Sinay, for to preche and teach to the people.
Capitulo. xii.


One God only thou shalt love and worship perfytely.

God in vain thou shalt not swear nor by yt he made truly

The sondayes thou shall keep. in seruinge God deuoutlye.

Father and mother thou shall honor end shall live longely.

Mans^eer thou shall not be, in deed, ne wyllyngely.

Lecherous thou shall not be, of thy body ne consentyngely.

No man's goods thou shall not stele nor witholde falsely.

False witness thou shalt not ^ere, in any wise lyingely.

The work of the flesh desire not, but in marriage only.

The goods of other covet not, to have them unjustly.



FOurhly the said commaundeme^ts ought to be observed and accom^plyshed upon
pain of everlasting dampnacion of body and sowl of the^ yt have the usage of
reason, for without the knowledge o^ them conuenablye we may not eschew and
^ie the sins, nor have knowledge of the^, nor confess us verytably of our
sins, whe^^fore the ignorance of the^ common by desire affection, or other
malice, excuset^ not the^ that know the^ not, but accuses and condempneth
them, and therefore ou^ lord commands the^ to be had in meditacion in their
houses and without, in sl^^pynge and in waking, and in all works And thus we
beholden and bound to kep^ the^, so that he which never hard speak of the^,
and thinks not to do evil, if h^ trespass in one only willingely, and dies
sone after, he should be dampened perdu^rably. By this it appears that
ignorance of the commandments been peri^^lous, wherefore each man and woman
study for to know the^, and learn the^ such as thou must give a reckoning
for, as your children, servants, and other.

The v. Commandments of the Church.
i
ii
x^


FIfthly in the book of Jesus bin the v. commandments of Holy Church,
which ought to be kept all them that has usage of reason, after as they be
of power.

And it is said after that they be of power, for that if the man or woman that
may not confess them, or receive at easter, or keep the holy day commanded.

Or the fast of obligation when they have will to do them, and bin lawfully
let, sin not. But every man and woman keep them that Avarice, sloth, or
desire to se manipleasures, as daunces, plays, or iuggelers, or despraysynge
of our mother Holy Church, be not cause that they trespass the commandment, to
the end that they run not in dampnacion, from the which keep us the mercy
of God. Amen. Here is to be noted that the transgression of the commandments
of holy Church oblygeth deadly sin, and by contynuance eternal dampnacyon.
as does the oblygacyon of the commandments of the law, of whom is spoken
before. For they that hereth the priests redinge the commandments ^n the
Church on the Sondayes in the parochial seruis time, and accomplysheth the
said commandments, hereth God and does his will, but all that misprayseth
the priest and does not their commandments after the ordinance of the
Church, misprayseth God and sins mortally.

Thus ends the v. commandments of our mother holy Church.
Here after follows of the man in the Ship, that shows the unstableness
of the world. Capitulo.xiii.
Qui finem attendit felix and qui been viuit. Ergo quisquis ades precor hic,
sta, perlege pensa. Mortem premetuens, veniam, pete, cortere plara: De reliquis
cautus benefacte crimine serua. Viue mori presto munda sub mente quietis.
Semita non virtus deus optimus anchora portus. Felix qui potuit tam tutum
tangere portum. Sed miser est quicunque sub peste gehenne.


GOd guide me right, that I once might
Come to the port of peace
Mine exchange make, and return take
That mine enemies me to cease
One me followed, would me have shalowed
In the goulfe dangerous.
With wordely gloss, he does me toss.
Among the waves perilous
On rases holow, some do me follow
Enemies me to take
A great number, do smite me under
I doubt I shall not escape.
The fiend with woe, the world also
My flesh does me trouble
In wake and sleep, to me they crepe
Thus increases my sorrow double.
They bid me not spare, but bye their ware
As all worldly vanity.
They say hope among, for to live long
Thus do they combre me.
The world does smyle, me to begyle
And so does the other two,
Now must I seek, some me to keep
To save me fro my fo.
I have found one, even God alone
I need none other aid
That by his right, put them to flight
And made them all afraid.
He spoke to me, full curteisly
And proffered me full fair
If I do well, with him to dwell
In heaven to be his heir.
Uersus.

NOs sumus in hoc mundo, sicut nauis super mare,
Semper est in periculo, semper timet accubare
Preuiliganti, nos oportet remigare:
Ne vibamus de poculo dire mortis, et amare:
Esto homo res fragilis curis oppressa labor
Mortis iudicii baratri perplexa timore
Si virtus sola tutam dat ducere vitam:
Uirtus sola potest eternam condere famam
Felicem merita faciunt non copia ream
Grandia no ditant: dicat been grandibus vti.
Discite nunc mortales, quam sint mortalia vana:
Precessere patres matres magnique parents.
Nos sequimur paribus ad mortem passibus imus:
Unde superbimus in terram, terra redimus.
Super non fueram, nec ero post tempore pauco
Milia nunc putrium quorum iam multa voluptas
Perdita fama silet, anima anxia forsitan ardet.
THe mortal man living in this world, is well compared to a ship on the sea,
or on a perilous river, bearing rich merchandise, which if it come to the port
where the merchant desires, he shall be happy and rich. The ship as soon as it
is entered into the sea, unto the end of her viage, night and day is in peril
to be drowned or taken with enemies, for in the sea be perilles without number.
Such is the body of man living in the world, the merchandise that he bears is
his soul, his virtues and good works, the port or haven is death, and
Paradise for the good, to the which who that goes thither is soueraignely
rich, the sea is the world full of linnes. For who that assayeth for to pass
it, is in peril to leese body and soul, and all his goods, and to be drowned
in the sea of hell, from the which God keep us. Amen.

Here follows the field of virtues. Cap. xiiii.
IN walkinge farthermore in the field of virtues, and in the way of Health,
for to come to the tower of Sapience, necessarily behooves to love God, for
without the love of God none may be saved, and who that will love him ought
first to know him, for of his knoweledge one comes to his love: that is
Charity the Sovereign of all virtues. They knowledge God and love him that
keep his commandments, and they misknow him that do not so, to whom in the
great necessity of their disceassing: and at the day of judgment shall misknow
them and say to them. I know ye not nor wot not what ye be, go ye cursed out
of my company. Knowledge wethen God and love him, and if we will do thus, know
we first our self, and by the knowledge of our self, we shall come to the
knowledge and love of God, and the more that we know our self, the better we
shall know God, and if we be ignorant of our self, we shall have no knowledge
of God. To this purpose we must note one thing and know.vii. The thing that we
must note is this. Who that knows himself knows God, and shall not be
dampened, and who that knows him not, knows not God, and shall not be saved:
understand of them that has wit and discretion with lawful age, of the which
knowledge none is excused after he has sinned deadly, for to say that he was
ignorant. By this appears the ignorance of him self, and of God right
perilous. Deadly sin is beginning of all evil, and contrarily knowledge of
God and of him self is sovereign science and virtue, beginning of all
goodness. The seven things that we ought to have, ben the.xii. articles of the
faith, that we ought to believe steadfastly. Also the petitions contained in the
Pater noster, by the which we demand all things necessary for our health, and
that we ought to hope in him, also the commandments of the law, and of the
holy Church, which ensygneth us what we should do, and what we should not do,
and all things belonginge to the same. Also if we be in the grace of our Lord
or not. And how be if that we may not know it certainly, nevertheless we
may have some conjectures, which be good to know, and knoweledge of God.
Also knoweledge of him self, by the which things we may come to the true
love and charity of God, to accomplish his commandments and merit in the
realm of heaven, wherein we shall live perdurably. Of the three first is
enough said, that is to know, the.xii. artycles of the faith, in the which
lies our faith and belief, and the things that we ought to demand of God,
be conteyued in the Pater noster, wherein our hope lies. Also the ten
commandments of the law, and of holy Church, where as Charity is showed
in such as keep them, by probacyon of the love of Godde, and do his
commandments and good works. Now will we speak of the other.iiii. And
first of the vocation in the which we be, which is the fourth thing that
each man ought to know. Each man ought to know his vocation, and the things
belonging to the same be just and honest for his health and rest of his
conscience. A good Shepeherde ought to know the art of sheep keeping, and to
govern sheep, and lead them into pastures, and to heal them when they be
sick, and shere them in season, to the intent that through his defaute no
damage come to his master. In likewise he that labors the corn, to know
what ground were good for every manner of grain, and ought to till the earth,
and when time is to sow, weed, repe, and threshe, so that his master may
have no damage by him. Semblably a Surgyon ought to know how to comfort and
heal such folks, that he has charge of, without bydinge of his art or
Surgery. Consequently a marchaunte ought to know the vtteraunce of his
marchaundyse to other, with no more fraud then he would him self should
have. Also an Advocate or a Proctour ought to know the ryghtes and customs of
places, that by their fault Justice be not perverted. A Judge also ought to
know (both the parties heard) who has right and who has wrong, and judge
egally after true Justice. Also a Priest or a relygious man ought to know
their orders and keep them, and above all thing ought to know that law of
God, and teach them unto the ignorant. And thus of all other vocations. For
all them that know not their vocation be not worthy to be, and live in peril
of their sowles for their ignorance The fyfth that all men ought to know, is
it he have discretion and understanding, to know if he be in the grace of God
or not. And how be it right difficile, for God only knows it,
nevertheless we may have conjectures that shows it, and sufficient for
Shepherdes and lay people to know, if they be in the love of the Lord, and if
they have conjecture to be in it, therefore there ought none to repute
themselves just, but ought t^ humble them selves, and ask him mercy that
makes sinners become just and none other. Principally we ought to know this
science when we will receive the body of Jesus Christ. For who that receives
his grace and goodness receaueth his salvation, and who that receaueth him
otherwise, receaueth everlasting dampnation, of the which thing every man
is judge in him self of his own conscience, and none other. The conjectures
whereby we may know if that we be in the grace of God or not. The first
conjecture is when we do travel for to cleanse our conscience of our souls by
penance as much as if we labored to get some great good, that we be not
culpable of any deadly sin done, or in will to do, nor in any sentence, then
it is good coniecturinge to be in the grace of God. The second conjecture that
shows in likewise to be in the grace of God, is when we be more prompt and
ready to good, obseruinge and keeping the commandments of Godde, and do all
good works that we should have accustomed. The third conjecture is when we
hear gladly the word of God, as sermons and good counsaylers for our
salvation. The fourth, when we be sorry and contrite at our heart to have
commysed and done any sin. The fifth is when with good purpose and will of
our selves we persevere to keep us from sin in time to come. These conjectures
be they whereby Shepherds and lay people know if they be in his grace or not, as
much as in them is possible to know. The.vi. thing that every man ought to
know is God, for all men ought to know God, for to accomplish his will and
commandment, by the which he would be loved with all thy heart, with all thy
soul, and with all the force that we have, which we may not do, if we know
him not, then who that would love Godde, ought to know him, and the more that
they know him, the more they love him, wherefore hereafter shall be said how
Shepherds and simple people does know him. Shepherdes and simple people for to
have knowledge of God of their possibility consyderinge three things. The
first is, that they consider the right great riches of God, his puissaunce,
his soueraygne dignity, his soueraygne noblesse, his soueraygne joy and
bliss. The second is for they consider the right noble, right great and
marvelous operations and works of our Lord God. And the third consideration
is, for they consider the innumerable benefits that they have receued of God,
and that continually every day they receive of him, and by these considerations
they come to his cognysance and knowledge. First to know God, Shepherdes and
lay people consydereth his great riches, plenteous habundaunce of the goodness
that he has, for all the treasures and richesse of heaven and of the earth be
his, and all goodness he has made, of the which he is fountain, creator,
and master, and distributeth them largely unto every creature, and he has no
need of any other. Wherefore it behooves to say that he is right rich.
Secondly he is right puissaunt, for by his great puissaunce he has made
heaven, earth, and the sea, with all things containing unto them, and might
undo them if that it were his will, unto the which puissaunce all other be
subject, and trembles before him for his great excellency. And who that would
consider every work of God should find enough to marvel on. By the first of
these considerations God is known to be right rich, by gifts that he gives
to his friends, and by the second he is known right puissaunt for to venge
him on his enemies. Thirdly he is soueraignely worthy, for all the things of
heaven and of earth owes him honor and reverence, as to their Creator and
him that made them, as we se children honor father and mother of whom they be
descended by a generation, and all things be descended of God by a creation,
to whom ought to be given great reverence, and he is so worthy. Fourthly he is
soueraignely noble, for who that is soueraignely rich, puissaunt, and worthy,
him behooves to be soueraignely noble, but none other but God has riches,
puissaunce, and dignity, as he has, wherefore of such nobles ought to be
said that he is right noble. Fifthly he has sovereign joy, for he that is
rich, puissaunte, worthy and right noble, is not without sovereign joy, and
this joy is full of all goodness, and ought to be our felicity, to the which
we hope to come. That is to know and see God in his sovereign joy and
gladness, for to have with him eternal joy that ever shall dure. And this is the
first consideration of God that Shepherdes and other simple people ought to
have. Secondly for to know God considering his great noblesse and marvelous
works the bounty and the beauty of the things that he has made, for it is
commonly said. One may know the workman by his work. Knowledge we then the
work of God, and knowledge we that his beauty and bounty shines in the
operations that he has made, which if they be fair and good, the workman that
has made them must needs be fair and good without comparison more then any
thing that he has made. Be it considered of the heavens and the things
therein set, what noble and marvelous work, how may one consider their
excellence and bounty. Be it considered also as we may of the earth the right
noble and marvelous works of God, the gold, the silver, and all manner of
metalles, and precious stones in it, the fruits that it bears, the trees,
the beasts that it susteyneth, and of the bounty that it norisheth. Be it in
likewise considered of the Sea, the rivers, and the fish nourished in them.
The wether, the elements, the air, the winds, and the Birds that flies in
them, and all the usage and service of man. And consider the workman that of
his puissaunce has all made, and by his sapience has right well ordered his
works, and governs them by his great bounty, and by this manner we may know
God, as Shepeherdes and simple folks in consideringe his works. Thirdely for
to know God, consider the great benefits that we receive daily of him, which
may not be numbered for their great multitude, nor spoken of for their
nobleness and dignity. Al be it in their hearts be vi. principally noted. For
the which an other Shepeherde geniuge praising to God, said in this manner.
Lord God I know that thou haste endued me with thy infinite benefits by thy
great bounty. First the benefit of my creation, by the which thou made me a
reasonable man unto thy Image and similytude, geuynge me body and soul, and
raiment for to clothe me. Lord thou haste given me my wits of nature,
understanding for to govern my life, my health^ my beauty, my strength, and
my science for to get my living honestly, I yield to thee graces and great
thanks. Secondely Lord I know the goodness of my redemption, how by thy
misericordious pity, thou bought me dearly by the affection of thy most
precious blood, peynes, and torments, that for me thou have suffered, and
finally endured death, thou have given me thy body, thy soul, and thy life,
for to keep me from dampnation, wherefore humbly I yield to thee graces and
great thanks. Thirdely Lord I know the goodness of my vocation, how of thy
great grace thou have called me again, for to enheryte thy eternal
benediction, and also thou haste given unto me faith and knowledge of thine
own self, as baptism, and all the other sacraments, that none entendement
may comprise their noblesse, and dignity, and that so many times has pardoned
me of my sins. Lord I know that this is to me a singular gift that thou
have not given to them which have no knowledge of thee, whereof I am more
beholding and humbly bound, I yield thee graces and thanks. Fourthly Lord I
knowledge that thou have given me this world and the things that be therein made
for my service and use, the office, the benefit, and the dignity in the which
I am, for sir I bear your similitude and Image which is reputed right worthy
and noble whereof humbly I yield to thee graces and thanks. Fyfthly Lord thou
have given me the Sky and his fair ornaments, the Sun, the Moon, and the
Sterres, that the day and night serves me, geuinge brightness and light
without to be recompensed of me, whereof I yield to thee graces and thanks.
Syxtly Lord I knowledge that thou have made Paradyse ready for to give me,
where I shall live with thee in joys without end, if I do thy will, and keep
thy commandments, and also I knowledge thy other infynite goodness each day
to me done by thy bounty, the which ensigneth me to know my God, my Savior,
and Redemer, wherefore I humbly give thanks to thee. By these considerations
Shepherds and simple people contempleth the bounty of God, and the benefytes
that they receive of him. And know we him, and be we not in great knowledge of
his benefytes in yeldinge thanks and praysynges to him, and recompense of your
gooddes in geuinge to poor folks for his sake, for Ingratitude is a villayne
sin that much displeases God. The.vii. and the last thing that each man
ought to know, that is to know him self, for it is the best mean for to
come unto the knoweledge of God, and for to make his salvation, so to know him
self first. Diverse folk know many things that know not them self, to whom
should profit more to know them self, then all things in the world. They that
know the things of the world loves them, seeks them, and keeps them, and
k^owe not, ne love not, ne praise not, ne keeps not God in likewise, for they
know him not. What profits man to win all the world, and leeseth himself for
to be damned? Better it were for him to leese all the world, if it were his,
if he knew him self to be saved. Shepeherdes say that the needful beginning
of his salvation is to know himself, and contrariwise ignorance of him self
is the beginning of dampnation, and of all evil that may befall unto him.

A question of a master Shepherde to a simple Shepherde to wete how he knew
him self and he said. Shepherde tell me how thou know thy self what art
thou, answer to me? And he said, I know my self, for I am a Christian man
a Shepherde. What is to be a Shepherde. And he answered unto that, thou ask
what man is. I say that man is a substance composed of body and soul. The
body is mortal and made of earth as beasts be, but the soul is made of
spiritual matter as Angels be immortal. My body is come of abominable
sin, and as a sack full of durte and fylth, and meat for worms, my
beginning was vile, my life is pain, labor, fear, and in subjection to
death, and my end shall be woeful, but my soul is created of god nobly and
worthily to his own Image and semblaunce after the Angels, the most fairest
and perfyte of all creatures, by baptism and by faith is made his daughter,
his spouse, his heir of his realm, that is Paradyse, and for her nobleness
and dignity ought to be a Lady, and my body as servant ought to obey her, for
reason has ordained and will that it be so: and who that does otherwise, and
prefers his body before his soul, ^eseth the usage of reason: and makes
him self semblable unto beastes^ discendinge from noble dignity into
miserable servitude of sensuality, by the which it is governed, so that I
know my self man. As to the second, he demands what thing it is to be a
Christian man? I answer in mine understanding, that to be a Christian man,
is to be baptized or Christened, and follow Jesus Christ, of whom we be said
Christians, for to be baptized and not to follow him, or to follow him and not
to be baptized, saves not man, and therefore when we receive baptism, we
renounce the devil and all his pompes, and we make promise for to follow Jesus
Christ, when we say (we will be baptized.) And who that keeps this promise
has the very name of a Christian man. And who that keeps it not, is a sinner
and a liar to God, and servant to the devil, and is no more Christen then a
dead man, or a payntynge on a wall, we say that is a man. Here demands the
master Shep^herde in how many things the Christian man ought to follow
Jesus Christ, for to accomplish the promise of Baptism. The simple Shepherd
answers: I say in.vi. things. The first is cleanesse of conscience, for
there is no thing more pleasant to God then a clean conscience, and it will
be made clean in two manners, one is by baptism when we receive it, and the
other by patience, that is contricion of heart, confession of mouth,
satisfaction of work, and then when we be clean we be pleasant to Jesus
Christ, which with the water of his mercy cleanses the sinners that does
penance, and makes them fair. The second thing in which we ought to
follow Jesus Christ, is humility, at the example of him. Lord of all the
world, which humbled him to take our humanity, and became mortal that was
immortal, live in poverty with us, ^eate oppropried pains, and finally
suffer to be crucified. Thus the Christian man ensuinge him ought to meek him
self. The third thing is to hold and love truth, and specially three
truths. The first truth is to know our self, for we be mortal and
sinful, and who that dies in sin shall be damned, and this truth witholdeth
sin, and exhorts the sinner to do penance and amend. The second truth
is of temporal goods, for they be transitory and must be left and this truth
disprayseth them to desire the heavenly goods that be eternal. The third
truth is of God, which is the joy that all Christian men ought to desire, and
this truth draws the Christian man to love and induseth him to do good works
for to merit the joys of Paradyse. The fourth thing wherein every man ought
to follow Jesus Christ, is pacyence in adversity, and in the spirit of life
by penance, confirminge of our selfs in the state of Jesus Christ, of whom
the life was all in pain and poverty which he endured for us. The fyfth is in
compassion of the poor, to the example of Jesus Christ, that by his mercy
healed the poor of all corporal infirmities, and the sinners of all ghostly
sickness, and we by compassion ought to give of our goods to poor folk, and
comfort them bodily and ghostly. The syxth thing wherein the Christian man
ought to follow Jesus Christ, is doloure, devotion, charity, in contemplacion
of the mysteries of his nativity, of his death and passion, of his
resurrection, of his ascension, and of his aduaunsing to the judgment, that
often times ought to be at our heart by holy medytacions. And as to the last,
what thing a Shepherd is. I say that it is the knowledge of my vocation, as
each has his, as before is said, and also to know the transgressions of all
these foresaid things, how many times in each we have transgressed, for
many times we have offended God, and who that takes head shall ^inde omissions
and offenses without number, the which known, we ought to doubt and eschew,
and do penance. And thus it is as I know man is Christen and Shepherde.

The ballade of a wise man. Capitulo.xv.

I know that God has turned me
And made me to his own likeness
I know that he has given to me truly
Soul and body, wit and knowledge ywysse
I know that by ryghtwise true balaunce
After my deeds judged shall I be
I know much, but I wot not the variaunce
To understand whereof comes my folly.

I know full well that I shall dye
And yet my life amend not I
I know in what poverty
Borne a child this earth above
I know that God has lent to me
Abundance of goods to my behoue
I know that riches can me not save
And with me I shall bear none away
I know the more good that I ha^^
The lother I shall be to dye
I know all this faithfully
And yet my life amend not I
I know that I have passed
Great part of my days with joy and pleasan^e
I know that I have gathered
Sins, and also do little penance
I know that by ignorance
To excuse me there is no art
I know that one shall be
When my soul shall depart
That I shall wish that I had mended me
I know there is no remedy
And therefore my ly^e amend will I.
Here follows the ballade of the woman Shepherde, the which ballade is very
necessary and profitable to look upon. Capitulo.xvi.

IN considering my pore humanity
Above the earth borne with great weping
I consider my fragilitie
My har^e is over pressed with sinning
I consider death will come verily
To take my life, but the hour wot not I
I consider the devil does watch me
The world and the flesh on me watreth straightly
I consider that mine enemies they be three
That would deliver me from death to death
I consider the many tribulations
Of this world, whereof the life is not clean

I consider an hundred thousand passions
That we pore creatures daily fall in
I consider the longer I live the worse I am
Wherefore my conscience cries out on me
I consider for sin some be damned as the book says
Which shall ever be delivered from death to death
I consider that worms shall eat me
My sorrowful body, this is credible
I consider that sinners shall be
At the judgment of God most dreadable:
O Jesus Christ above all thing most delectable
Have mercy on me at the dreadful day
That shall be so marvelous and doughtable
Which my poor soul greatly does fray
In you that I put my trust and faith
To save me that I go not from death to death
The song of death to all Christen people. Cap. xvii.

Take in worth, for surely in substance
The sight of it may to you be profitable
There is no way also more doughtable
Therefore learn, know your self and see
Look how I am and thus shall you be
And take heed of thy self, in adventure read I
For Adams apple we must all dye
Alas worldly people behold my manner
Sometime I lived with beauteous visage
Mine eyes be gone I have two holes here
I am meat for worms in this passage
Take heed of wealth while ye have the usage
For as I am thou shall come to dust
Holed as a thimble, what shall thee advance
Naught but good deeds, thou may me trust
All with my likeness ye must all dance
The time that I was in this world living
I was honored with low and hye
But I kept not my conscience clean from sinning
Therefore now I do it dear abye
Lo what avails couetise, pride and envy
They be the brandes that does brenne in hell
Trust not to your friends when ye be dead read I
Nor your executours, for few does well
But do for thy self or ever thou dye
And remember while thou art living
That God blessed all thing without nay
Except sin, as records writing
The devil can not claim thee but by sin I say
Amend therefore betyme, and go the right way
I would that I might have but one hour or two
To do penance in, or half a day
But while I lived I did none do
But now my dettes I do truly pay
Thou man I do give better counsel to thee
If that thou will do after it
Then ever any that was showed te me
Thou art half warned, think on thy pit
And chose of two ways which thou will flit
To joy or pain one of the two
In wealth or woe for ever to sit
Now at thine own choice thou may go
For God has given thee free will
Now chose thee whether thou will do good or ill.
Here after follows the.x. commandments of the devil.

WHo so will do my commandments
And keep them well and sure
Shall have in hell great torments
That evermore shall endure.
Thou shall not fear God nor think of his goodness
To dampne thy soul blaspheme God and his saints
Evermore thine own will be fast doing
Deceive men and women, and ever be swearing
Be dronken hardely upon the holy day
And cause other to sin if thou may
Father nor mother look thou love nor dread
Nor help them never, though they have need
Hate thy neighbor, and hurt him by envy
Murder and shed man's blood hardely
Forgive no man but be all vengeable
Be lecherous in deed and in touching delectable
Break thy wedlock and spare not
And to deceive other by falsehode care not
The goods of other thou shall hold fal^ly
And yield it no more though they speak curtesly
Company often with women, and tempte them to sin
Desire thy neighbors wife, and his goods to be thine
Do thus hardely and care not therefore
And thou shall dwell with me in hell evermore
Thou shall lie in frost and fire, with sickness and hunger
And in a thousand pieces thou shall be torn a sunder
yet thou shall dye ever and never be dead
Thy meat shall be todes, and thy drink boiling lead
Take no thought for the blud that God for thee shed
And to my kingdom thou shall be straight led.

Here follows the reward of them that keeps these commandments aforesaid.

IN hell is great mourning
Great trouble of crying
Or thunder and noyses roaring
With great plenty of wild fire
Beating with great strokes like gunnes
With great frost and water running
And after that a bitter wind comes
Which goes through the souls with ire
There is both thirst and hunger
Fiendes with hooks pulls their flesh
They fight and curse, and each other redemes
With the sight of the devils dreadable
There is shame and confusion
Rumor of conscience for evil living
They curse them selves with great crying
In stink and smoke evermore lying
With other great pains innumerable.
Man look that thou beware.
I do smite all at unware.
It is written in the Apocalips that Saint John saw an horse of a pale
color, on the which horse satte death, and a Hell folowinge the horse. The
horse sygnifieth the sinner that has a pale color, for the infirmity of
sin, and bears death, for sin is death to the soul, and hell follows
for to englut and swalowe him if he die impenitent. Capitulo.xix.
Above this horse black and hideous
Death I am that fircely does sit
There is no fairenes but sight tedious
All gay colors I do hitte
My horse runs by dales and hills
And many he smyteth dead and killes

In my trap I take some by every way
By towns and castles I take my rent
I will not respite one an hour of a day
Before me they must needs be present
I ^lea all with my mortal knife
And of duty I take the life
Hell knows well my killing
I sleep never but wake and warke
It follows me ever running
With my darte I slay weak and stark
A great number it has of me
Paradyse has not the fourth part
Scant the tenth part wrong has he
I cause many to sigh at the heart
Beware for I give no warning
Come at once when I do knock or call
For if thy book be not sure of reconing
Thou shall to hell body soul and all.

Of all women.
O ye women, of each manner degree
To your husbands, be never disobedient
Desire not above them the soueraignetie
For then ye do as Lucifer did incontinent
That would be above the hie God omnipotent
Shamefastnes, dread, clennesse and chastity
Of very right all these in womanhed should be.
The generality.
Go home ye persons and couch not in court
Go teach Christ's servants and keep thy own labor
Thou nigarde sow out thy horde
In household, and be none extorcioner
Monk pray, preach friar, merchant go nere and far
Dread God, keep his law, and honor your king
And your reward shall ye have at your ending.

How Shepardes by calculation and speculation know the.xii. signs in their
course reygning and domining on the.xii. parts of man's body, and which be good
for letting of blud, and which be indifferent or evil for the same.
Capitulo.xxii.


SOme Shipardes say that a man is a little world by him self, for the
lykenesses and similytudes that he has of the great world, which is the
aggregation of the nine skies, four elements^ and all things in them
contained. First a man has such a likeness in the first mobile, that is the
sovereign sky, and principal parts of the great world. For like as in his
first mobyle the zodiake is divided in.xii. parts by the.xii. signs, so man is
divided in.xii. parts and holds of the signs, every part of his sign as
this figure shows. The signs be these. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Uirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces. Of the
which, three be of the nature of the fire, that is Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.
And three of the nature of the air. Gemini, Libra, and Aquari^s. And three of
the nature of water, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. And three of the nature of
earth. Taurus, Uirgo^ and Capricornus. The first that is Aries, governs the
head and the face of man. Taurus the neck and the throat boll. Gemini the
shoulders, the arms, and hands. Cancer the breast, sides mylte, and lights.
Leo the stomach, the heart, and the back. Uirgo the belly, and the entrayles.
Libra the nauill, the graynes and the parts under the branches. Scorpio the
privy parties, the genytailes, the bladder, and the foundement. Sagittarius
the thighs only. Capricoruus the knees only also. Aquarius the legs, and
from the knees to the heels and ancles. And Pisces has the feet in his
dominion.

A man ought not to make incision, ne touch with iron the member governed of

blud that might happen, ne in likewise also when the Sun is in it, for the
danger and peril that might ensue.

Aquarius is hot and moist, nature of air, and governs the legs, and is
neither good ne evil for bleeding.

Pisces is indifferent for bleeding.

Pisces is cold and moist, nature of water, and governs the feet, and is
neither good ne bad for bleeding.

Aries, Libra. and Sagittarius be right good.

Cancer, Uirgo, Scorpio, Aquarius and Pisces be indifferent.

Taurus, Gemini, Leo, and Capricornus be evil for bleeding.

A picture of the Phisnomy of man's body, and shows in what parts the.vii.
planets has domination in man. Cap. xxxiiii.
We may know by this figure the bones and joints of all the parties of the body
as well within as without, of the head neck, shoulders, arms, hands, sides,
breast, back, haunches, thighs, knees, legs, and of the feet. The which
bones shall be named and numbered hereafter, and it is called the figure Anothomy.



By this figure one may understand the parties of man's body, over the which the
planets has might and domination. to keep them from touching any Iron, ne to
make incision of bludde in the veins that proceed in the time while that the
planet of the said party is conjoined with any other planet maneuolent
without having regard of some good planette, that might encombre and let his
evil course.

The names of the bones in a man's body, and the number of them, which is mall
two hundred eight and forty. Capitulo. xiiii.
FIrst on the sommet of the head is a bone that covers the brain, the which
Shepards call the capital bone. In the skull be two bones which be called
paryetailes, that holds the brain close and steadfast. Mo^e lower in the
brain is a done called the crown of the head, and on the one side and on the
other be two holes, within the which is the palys or ro^e bone. In the part
behind the head be four like bones, to the which the chyne of the neck
holds. The bones of the nose be two. The bones of the chaftes above be xi.
And of the nether iaw be two. Above the opposyte of the brain there is one
behind named collateral. The bones of the teeth be.xxx. Eight before, four
above and four underneath sharp and trenching for to cut the morsels, and
there are four sharp, two above and two underneath, and be called co^ynes, for
they resemble co^ies teeth. After that be.xvi. that be as they were hammers or
grinding teeth, for they chaw and grind the meat the which is eaten, and there
is on every side four above and four underneath, and then the four teeth of
sapyence on each side of the chaftes one above and one underneath. In the chyne
from the head downward be.xxx. bones called knots or joints. In the breast
before be seven bones, and on every side.xii. ribs. By the neck between the
head and the shoulders be two bones named the sheres. After be the two
shoulder blades. From the shoulders to the elbow in each arm is a bone called
the adiutor. From the elbow to the hand on each arm be two bones that be
called cannes. In each hand be.viii. bones, above the palm be four bones
which be called the comb of the hand. The bones in the fingers in each hand
be.xv. in every finger three. At the end of the ridge be the ho^^le bones,
whereto be fastened the two bones of the thighs. In each knee is a bone called
the knee plate. From the knee to the foot in each leg be two bones, called
cannes or marow bones. In each foot is a bone called the ankle or pin^^ of the
foot, behind that ankle is the heel bone in each foot, the which is the lowest
part of a man, and above each foot is a bone called the hollow bone. In the
plant of each foot be.iiii. bones. Then be the combs of the feet, in each of
which be.v. bones. The bones in the toes in each foot be the number of.xiiii.
Two bones be tofore the belly for to hold it steadfast with the two branches.
Two bones be in the head behind the ears called Oculares. We reckon not the
tender bones of the end of the shoulders, nor of the sides, nor diverse little
grystles and spelders of bones, for they be comprehended in the number
abouesayde.

Thus ends the Notomy, and follows the Flubotomy.
Hereafter follows the names of the veins, and where they rest, and how they
ought to be letten bludde.


WE man understand by this figure the number of the veins and the places of a
man's ^ody where they ^en, and how they ought to be letten blud, and no where
else so that it be a nutural day for blud letting, that the Moon be not new, ne
at the full, ne in quarter, and that it be in any sign before named good for
bleeding, but if that such sign were it that domineth the member of the which
blud should be letten, for then it ought not for to be touched, ne also that it
be the sign of the sun.

The names of the places where the veins be, are showed by the letters set in
the margent at the beginning of the matter after the form of the picture.
A The vein in the mids of the forehed would be letten blud for the ache and
pain of the head, and for fevers lytargy, and for the megryme. B Above the two
ears behind is two veins, the which be letten bludde for to give clear
understanding, and the virtue of light hearing, and for thick breath, and for
doubt of meselry. C In the temples been two veins called the Artires, for that
they pant, the which ben letten bludde for to diminyshe and take away the
great replection and habundaunce of bludde that is in the brain, that might
noye the head and the eyes, and it is good against the gout, megryme, and
diverse other accidents that may come to the head. D Under the tongue been two
veins that been letten bludde for a syckenesse named the Sequamy, and against
the swellinge and apostumes of the throat, and against the Equinauncy, by the
which a man might dye suddenly for defaute of such bleeding. E In the neck been
two veins called Orygynalles, for that they have the course and habundaunce of
all the blud that governs the body of man, and principally the head, but they
ought not to be letten blud without the counsel of the surgyon, and this
bleedynge avails much to the syckenesse of Lepry, when it comes principally
of bludde. F The vein of the heart taken in the arm, profits to take away
humors or ill blud that might hurt the chamber of the heart or the
appurtenance, and it is good for them that spitteth bind, and that be short
winded, by the which a man may die suddenly by defaute of such bleeding. G The
vein of the liver taken in the arm, takes and deminys^eth the great heat of
the body of man, and holds the body in health, and this bleedinge is
profitable against the yelowe axes and apostume of the liver, and against the
plurisy, whereby a man may die by defaute of such bleeding. H Between the master
finger and the leche to let blud, helps the dolours that comes in the
stomach and sides, as botches and apostumes and diverse other accidents that
may come in those places by great habundance of blud and humors. I In the
sides between the womb and the branch be two veynes^ of the which that of the
right side is letten blud for dropsy, and that of the left side for every
sickness that comes about the milte, and they should blede after that persons
be fat or lean, take good heed at four fyngers nigh the incysyon, and also
they not to make such bleeding without counsel of the surgion. K In every
foot ben three veins, of the which three veins, one is under the ancle of
the foot named Sophane, the which is letten bludde for to deminish and put out
diverse humors, as botches and apostumes that comes about the graynes, and
it profyteth much to women for to cause their menstruositie to dyscende, and to
fyxe the emoroydes, that comes in the secret places, and such other like. L
Between the wrest of the foot and the great too is a vain, the which is
letten bludde for diverse syckenesses and inconuenyences, as the pestylence,
that takes a person suddenly by the great superhaboundance of humors, and
this bleeding must be made within a natural day, that is to wit, within xxiiii.
hours after that the sickness is taken of the pacient, and before the Fever
come on him, and this bleding ought to be done after the corpolence of the
pacient. M In the angles of the eyes be two veins, the which be let bludde for
the redness of the eyes, or water that runs continually, and for diverse
other sicknesses that may happen and come by over great habundance of humors
and bludde. N In the vein of the end of the nose is made a bleding, the which
is good for a red pimpeled face, as be red drops, pustules, small skabbes,
and other infections of the heart that may come therein by the great replection
and habundance of bludde and humors, and it avails against popeled noses and
other semblable sickness. O In the mouth in the gummes be four veins, that is
to wit, two above and two beneath, the which be let b^udde for the chafinge and
canker in the mouth, and for tooth ache. P Between the lyppe and the chynne is
a vein that is letten blud to give amendment to them that have an evil
breast. Q In each arm be four veins, of the which the vein of the head is
the highest, the second next is from the heart, the third is of the liver, and
the fourth is from the mylte, otherwise called the low liver vein. R The vein
of the head taken in the arm, ought to bleed for to take away the great
replection and habundance of blud that may anoy the head, the eien or the
brain, and avails greatly for transmutable heates, and swellings of the
throat, and to them that has swollen faces and red, and to diverse other
sicknesses that may fall by to great habundance of blud. S The vein of the
mylte, otherwise called the low vein, should bleed against all fever
tercians, and quarteynes, and it ought to be made a large and less deep
wound then in any other vein, for fear of wind that it may gather, and for
more inconvenience, for fear of a synewe that is under it, that is called the
Lezarde. T In each hand be three veins whereof that above the tomb ought to
blede to take away the great heat of the visage, and for the thick blud and
humors that be in the head, this vein euacueth more then that of the arm. U
Between the little finger and the leche finger is lettinge of bludde that
avails greatly against all fever tercians and quartaines, and against flumes,
and diverse other lettings that comes to the pappes and to the mylte. x In
each thighe is a vein, of the which the bleeding avails against the dolours
and swellings of the genitours, and for to avoid and drive out of a man's body
humors that be in the graynes. y The vein that is under the ancle of the foot
without, named Sciat, of the which the bleeding is much worth against the
pains of the haunches, and for to make depart and issue diverse humors, which
would assemble in the said place^ and avails greatly to women for to
restrain their menstruosity when they have to great habundance.
Thus ends the Anotomy and Flubothomy of the humayne bodies, and how one
should understand them.
HEre before we have said of the regard of planets upon the parties of man,
and the division and number of the bones of man's body, and now follows to
know when any man is hole or sick, or disposed in any wise to sickness.
Wherefore three things ben, by the which Shepardes know when a man is hole or
sick, or disposed to sickness. If he be hole to maintain and keep him, if he
be sick, to search remedy to heal him. If he be disposed to sickness to keep
him that he fall not therein. And for to know each of the said three things,
the Shepards put diverse signs. Health properly temperance, accord, and
equality of the iiii. equalities of man, which be hot, cold, dry, and moist.
The which when they be well tempered and equal, that one surmoun^e not the
other, then the body of man is hole. But when they be unequal and mistempred,
that one domineth over another, then a man is sick or disposed to sickness, and
they be the qualities that the bodies boldeth of the elements, that they be
made and composed of, that is to wit of the fire heat, of the water cold, of
the air moist, and of the earth dry. The which qualities, when one is
disordered from the other, then the body is sick. And if that one destroy the
other of all, then the body dies, and the soul departs.

Signs by the which Shepards know a man hole and well disposed in his body.
Capitulo.xxv.
THe first sign whereby Shepardes know a man to be hole and well disposed in
his body, is when he eats and drinks well after the conuenaunce of the
hunger and thirste that he has without making excess. Also when he digesteth
lightly, and when that that he has eaten and dronken empesheth and greueth not
his stomach. Also when he feleth good savor and appetite in that he eats and
drinks. Also when he is hungry and thirsty at the hours that he ought to
eat and drink. Also when he reioyseth him with merry folk. Also when they
play gladly any play of recreation with fellows of merry courage. Also when he
plays gladly in fields and woddes to take the sweet air, and sport in
meadows by water sides. Also when he eats gladly and with good appetite, of
butter, cheese, flawnes, sheep mylte, without leauyng any thing in his dyshe
to send to the alms house. And when he sleeps well without rauynge,
dreamyng of his marchandyse. Also when he feleth him light, and that he walks
well. Also when he sweateth soon, and that neseth little or nothing. Also when
he is neither to fat ne to lean. Also when he has good color in his face,
and that his wits ben all well disposed for to do their operacion, as his
eyes for to see, his ears to hear, his nose to smell^ etc. And thus we leave
of the conuenance of age, the disposition of the body, and also of the time.
(...) other signs I say nothing, but these be the most common, and that
ought to suffice for shepardes to know the signs of health.

Signs opposyte to the precedentes, by the which Shepardes know when they or
other ben sick.
FIrst when he may not well eat ne drink, or that they have none appetite to
eat at dinner and supper, or when he fyndeth no savor in that he eats or
drinks, or that he is hungry and may not eat, when his dygestion is not
good, or that it be to long. Also when h^ goes not to chamber moderately as
he ought to do. Also when he is heavy and sad in joyous companyes, then
syckenesse constreyneth a man to be thoughtfull. Semblably when he may not
sleep or take his rest aright and at due hour. Also when his members ben
heavy, as his head, his legs, and his arms. And also when he may not walk
easily and lightly, and that he shows not often, and his color is pale or
yelowe, or when his wits, as his eyes, his ears, and the other do not kindly
their operations. In likewise when he may not labor and travel. Also when he
forgets lightly that which of necessity ought to be kept in memory, and
when he spitteth often, or when his nosethrilles abounds in superfluous
humors. And when he is negligent in his works, and when his flesh is blown
or swollen in the vysage, in his legs, or his sect, or when his eyes be
holowe in his head. These ben the signs that sygnifyeth a man being in
sickness, and who that has most of the foresaid signs, most is sick.

Other manner of signs almost semblable to them above said, and shows the
replexion of evil humors for to be purged of them. Cap. xxvi.
REplection of euill^ humors and dysposition of syckenesse, after the opinion
of Shepardes, the which replection is to know how to pourge the said
humors that they engendre no sickness, and been broken by the signs that
follows. First when a man has over great redness in the face, in the
hands, or in the nails, having also the veins full of bludde, or blede to
much at the nose, or to often, or to have pain in the forheade. Also when the
ears sounds, and when the eyes waters or be full of gum, and have the
understanding troubled, and when the pou^^ beats to fast and when the belly
i^ long resolute and laxe, and when one has the sight troubled, and eating
also without appetyte. And all the other signs before said bin, by the which
one may know the body evil dysposed and have in it corrupt humors,
superflous and evil.

Thus fynysheth of the signs, by the which Shepardes know when they been ole
and well dysposed, and other signs opposyts, by the which they know when
they bin syck or evil disposed.

A division and regyme of time, of the which Shepardes uses after that the
season and time requires. Cap xxvii.
FOr to remedy the syckenesses and infirmities that a man has, and to keep him
from the^ that he doubts to come. Shepardes say that the time naturally
channgeth four times in a yer, and so they deuyde the year in four quarters,
that is ver, summer, harvest, and winter. And in each of these quarters they
govern them as the seasons requires to their minds, and the better it is for
them. And as the ^eason changes, so change they their manner of living and
doing, and say that chaungynge of time without taking good head, often
engenders infyrmities^ for that in one time behooves not to use some meats
that been good ^n an other time, as that use in winter is not all good in
summer, and so of the other seasons And for to know the changynge of time
after these said parties they consider the course of the son die the xii.
signs, and say that every of the said.iiii^ quarters and seasons dureth three
months, and that the son passes by three signs. that is to wit, in
primetyme by Pisces, Aries, and Taurus, and these be the months, February,
March, and April, that the earth and trees reioyseth and charge with grene
leaves and ^oures, that is a pleasure to behold. In summer by Gemini, Ca^cer
and Leo, and the months been May, June and July, that the fruits of the Earth
^^oweth and rypeth. In Harvest by Uirgo, Libra, and Scorpio, and the ^onethes
been August, September and October, that the Earth and trees dyschargeth
fruits and leaves, and that time each felleth and gathers the ^^ites. In
winter by Sagittarius, Capricornus, and Aquarius, and the mo^ethes been
November, December and January, that the earth and trees ben as dead and
vnclo^hed of leaves, fruits, and of all grenesse. After the which ^^ure^
seasons Shepardes deuiseth the time that man may live in four ages, as youth,
strength, age, and decrypte, and ben likened to the four seasons of the year.
That is to wit, youth to pryme time, that is hot and moist and as the herbs and
trees of the earth grows, so does man in youth unto xxv. year grow^ of body,
in strength, beauty, and vigoure. Force is lykened unto summer ho^ and dry,
and the body of man is in his force and vigoure, and entrypeth vnto^ xlv. year.
Age is compared to the time of harvest, cold and dry that man le^ueth of
growinge and febleth, and thinks how together and spare for fear o^ defaute
and need when he comes to stopwing age, and dureth to.lvi. yere^ Decrepyte is
likened to the season of winter, cold and humyde by habundanc^ of cold
humors and defaute of natural heat, in the which time man spen^deth that
which he had gathered and kept in the time passed, and if he hau^ spared
nothing, he abides poor and naked as the earth and Trees and du^reth
unto.lxii. year or more. Primetyme is hot and moist, nature of ayre^ and
complexion of the sanguyne. Summer is hot and dry, nature of fire, and
complexion of coieryke. Harvest is cold and dry, nature of earth, and
com^plexion of the melancoly. Winter is cold and moist, nature of water,
com^plexion of the flumatyke: when complexion is well proportioned it feels
i^ self better disposed in the time semblable to it then it does in other
tymes^ But for that every man is not well complexioned, they ought to do as
Sh^^pardes does, that is to take regyment to keep them self after the seasons,
an^ governs them by their ensygnements and teachings, the which they vse^
every quarter of the year for to live the longer, wyselyer, and merely.

The regyment for primetyme, March, April, and May.
IN primetyme Shepardes keep them selves metely well clothed, no^ over cold ne
over hot, as with lynseywolsy, doublettes of fustian, an^ gowns of a meetely
length furred with lamb most commonly. I^ this time is good letting of blud to
avoid the evil humors that were ga^thered in the body the Winter time. If
syckeuesse happen in prymetyme it i^ not of his nature, but proceeds of the
humors gathered in the winter pas^sed. Prymetyme is a temperate time to take
medicines for them that b^ corporate and full of thycke humors, to purge them.
In this time the^ ought for to eat light meats that refreshes, as chekyns,
kyddes with ve^^gyous, borage, beetes, yolks of eggs, eggs in moneshyne,
roches, perches^ pykerelles, and all scaled fysh. Drink temperate wine, bear
or ale, so that they be not to strong, ne ouerswete. For in this time all
sweet things ought not to be used, and a man ought to sleep long in the
morning and not on the daye^ The Shepardes have a general regle or costume for
all seasons, that auai^leth much against all infirmities and sickenesses, that
is, not to less his ap^petite for eating, and never for to eat without hunger.
Also they say that al^ manner of flesh and fyshe is better roasted then sodden,
and if they ben soden t^ broyle them on a gredyron, or on the coals, and they
been the more holsommer.

The regement for the time of summer. June, July, and August.
THe Shepardes in so^mer bin clothed with light gowns, and syngle, their
shyrtes and shetes that they lie in bin lynnen, for of al clothes it is the
coldest, thy have dowblettes of sylke, of sey, or of canuas manerly made, and
they eat light meats, as chekyns with vergyous, young hearts, rabette,
lectuse, purcelayne, melons, gourdes, cocumbres, peers, plommes, and such
fyshe as are named before. And also they eat of meats that refreshes. Also
they eat little and often, they break their fast or dyne in the morninge or
ever the son arise, and go to supper or it discende, and they eat often of
the above said meats and sourer for to give them an appetyte. They eat but
little salt meats, and refrain them from scratching, they drink often fresh
water sodden with sugercandy, and other refreshinge waters, and they do it
always when they been thyrsly, save only at dinner and supper time, and then
they drink feeble grene ^yne, or single bear, or small ale. Also they keep
them from over great travel, or over forsing them solfe, for in this time is
nothing more grievous then chafynge. In this season they eschew the company of
women, and they bathe them often in cold water to assuage the heat of their
bodies enforced by labors. Always they have with them sugerca^dy or other
sugar, and dredge, whereof they take little and often, and each day in the
morninge they force them by coughinge and spittinge, to void fleumes, and
void them above and below the best that they may, and wash their hands
with fresh water, their mouth and vysage.

The regement for harvest, September, October, and November.
IN harvest Shepardes been clothed after the manner of Prymetyme save their
clothes been a little warmer. In this time they do dylygence to purge and cleanse
them, and lettinge them blud to tempre the humors of their bodies. For it is
the most contagyous time of the year, in the which perilous infirmities
happens and commethe, and therefore thee eat good and wholesome meats, as
Caponnes, Hens, young Pygeon that begin to fly, and drinks good wynes,
and other good drynkes without making excess. In this time they keep them
from eating of fruits for it is a dangerous season for agnes, and they say
that he had never ague that never eat fruit. In this time they drink no
water, and they put no part of them in cold water, but their hands, and
their face. They keep their heads fro cold in the night and morning, and
sleep not in the none time, and keep them from over great traueyle, and endure
not to much hunger ne thyrft, but eat when it is time, and not when their mawes
be full.

The regyment for winter time, December, January, and February.
THe Shepardes in winter been clothed in thycke gowns of rough clothe hye
shorn, well furred with fox. For it is the wariness furryng that is and
cattes, conyes, lambs, and diverse other thycke furs that be good and
wholesome. In the time of winter Shepardes do eat befe, porke and brawne, of
hearts, hindes, and all manner of venyson, pertryches, fesauntes, hares, fowls
of the river, and other meats that they love best. For that is the season of
the year that nature suffers most great plentye of vyttayle for the
natural heat that is drawn within the body. An this time also they drink
often strong wynes, after their complexion. bastard wine, or Osey. Two or three
times in the weke they use good spyces in their meats. For this is the most
wholesome time of all the year, in the which comes no syckenesse but by great
excess and outrages done to nature, or by evil government. Shepardes say
also that prymetyme is hot and moist of the nature of air complexion of the
sanguine, and that in the same time nature reioyseth, and the pores opens,
and the blud spredeth through the veins more then another time. Summer is
hot and dry of the nature of fire, and complexion of coleryke, in the which
time one ought to keep him from all things that moves to heat, al excess
and hot meats. Harvest is cold and dry of the nature of earth, and
complexion of melancoly, in the which time one ought to keep him from doing
excess more then in other times, for danger of sykenesses, to the which that
time is dysposen. But winter is cold and moist of the nature of water, and
complexion of flumatyke, then a man ought to keep him warm and myanely, for to
live in health.

Here it ought to be noted that a man is made and fourmed of the four
elements, of the which one has domination always above the other: and that
man on whom the fire domineth is said coleryke, that is to say hot and dry
He on whom the air has domination is said sanguyne, that is to say hot, and
moist. He on whom the water has domination is said cold and moist, that is
to say flumatike. And he on whom the earth reygneth is said melancolyke, that
is to say, cold and dry. Of the which complexions shall be spoken in the
beginning of the Physonomy more largely.

the day, and thou shall be hole.

For wind in the stomach.
Take commin, and beat it to powder, and mingle it with red wine, and drink
it last at night three days, and he shall be hole.

For the dropsy.
Take thycke wede, clyth^rs, ale and otemele, and make potage therwyth, and use
it ix. days, and every day fresh, and he shall be hole.

A good drink for the pestylence.
For the pestylence, take and wash cleene a lyllyrote, and boil it in white
wine, till the one half he wasted, and then give it the s^e^e to drink, and
he shall break out full of bladders as he, were brent or scalded with hot
water, and then they will dry, and the person wax hole.

Here after follows the iiii. elements, and the four complexions of man, and
how and in what time they raygne in man, Cap. xxix.
Air, Fire, Earth and water. The xxiiii. hours of the day and the night
rules Sanguine, Colerike, Melancolike, and Flumatike. Six hours after
mydnight bludde has the maistry, and in the vi. hours aforenoone collar
reigns, and vi. hours afternoon reigns melancoly, and vi. hours before
midnyght reigns the flumatike.

Thus ends the iiii, elements, and the four complexions of man,
Here follows the governance of health. Ca. xxx.

VUho will be hole and keep himself fro sickness
And rysest the stroke of pestylence
Let him be glad, and void all heaviness
Flee wicked airs, eschew the presence
Of infecte places, causynge the vyolence
Drynkinge good wynes, of holso^ meatestake
Smell sweet things, and for thy defense
Walk in clean air, and eschew the mystys black.
With void stomacke^ outward the not dress
Rysynge up early, with fire have sustence
Delight in gardbas, for the great sweetness
To be well cladde, do thy deligence
Keep well thy self from inconvenience
In stews ne bathes, no seiourne thou make
Opening of the pores, this does great offense
Walk in clean air, and eschew the mystes black.
Eat no raw flesh for no gredynes,
And from fruit keep thine abstynence
Pullettes and chyckyns for their tenderness
Eat thou with sauce, spare for none expense
Uergious, vinegar, and the influence
Of wholesome spicies, I dare undertake
The morrow flepe, called golden in sentence
Great helps against the mystes black.
For health of body, cover fro cold they head
Eat no raw meats, take good head her to.
Drink wholesome wine, feed thee on light bread
With an appetyte rise from thy meat also
With women aged, fleshely have not to do
Upon thy sleep drink not of the cup
Glad toward bed, at morrow both two
And use never late for to suppe.
And if it so be, that leches to thee fail,
Then take good head, to use things thre^
Temporate dyete, temporate travail
Not malicyous, for none adversity
Meke in trouble glad in poverty
Rich with little, content with suffysaunce.

Curteyse of language, of fedynge mesurable
On sundry meat, not gredy at the table
In fedynge gentle, prudent in dalyaunce
Close of tongue, of word not deceyuable
To say the best, set always they pleasaunce.
Have in hate months that been double
Suffer at thy table no detraction
Have despyte of fok that make trouble
Of false rauenoures, and adulation
Within thy place suffer no deuysion
With thy householde, it shall cause increase
Of al welfare, prosperity and ^oyson
With thy neighbors, live in rest and peace
Be clenly cladde, after thy estaty
Pass not thy bonds, keep thy promise blyue
With three folk be not at debate

Against thy fellow, no querell to contryue
With thy subject to strive it were shame
Wherefore I council, pursure all thy life

After meat beware, make not to long sleep
Head, foot and stomach, preserve aye from cold
Be not to pensyfe, of thought take no keep
After thy rent, govern thy houshoulde
Suffer in time, in thy right behold
Swear none other, no man to begyle
In youth be lusty, and sad when thou art old.
No wordely joy lasts but a while.
Dyne not at morrow, before thine appetyte
Clear air and walkinge makes good dygestion
Between meles drink not for no farwarde delight
But thyrst or travail, give the occasion
Over salt meat does great oppression
Th feeble stomakes, when they can not refrain
Fro thing contrary, to their complexion.
Of gredy hands, the stomach has great pain.
Thus in two things stands all thy wealth
Of soul and body, who lift them sue
Moderate fode, gives to man his health
And all surfettes, then he does eschew
And charity to soul is dew
This receyte bought is of no Potycary
Of Master Anthony, ne of master Hew
To all indifferent, riches dyetary.

Thus ends the Physycke and regement of health of Shepardes And follows
their Astrology. Capitulo.xxxi.

WHo that will as Shepardes that keeps sheep in the fyeldes without knowing
any letter, save only by some fygures that they make in little tables of wodde
have knowledge of the mouynges and proprfeties of the heavens. And diverse other
things contained in this present composte and calendar of Shepardes, the
which is extracte and composed out of their kalenders and put in letter, so
that each may compryse and know as they, the things above said. First one
ought to know what the figure is, the disposition of the world, the nombre and
order of the elements, and the mouinges of the skies aperteyneth to be known
of every man of free condition and noble engine. For it is a fair thing,
delectable profitable and honest, and therewith it is necessary to have diverse
other knowleges, in especial for the Astrology of Shepardes, which shows
how the world is round as a ball. And after wise men say there is nothing so
round as it. For it is rounder then any thing artyfycyall. And more over in
this world we se nothing ne never shall that is so ius^e and egally round as
it self is, and is composed of the heaven and the four elements in v.
principal parties. After that a person ought to know that the earth is in the
mids of the world, for it is the heuyest element. Upon the earth is the
water or the sea, but it covers not all the earth, to the end that men and
beasts may live therein, and the party that is uncovered is called the face of
the earth, for it is as the face of man always uncovered, and the part that
is covered with water is as the body of man that is clothed and hid, On the
water is the air that encloseth the earth and the water, and is divided in
three regions, one is low where as en habiteth beasts and birds, an other
mean where as bin the clouds, the which make the impressions, as
lightninghes, thonders, and other, and is always cold, the third is the
hyeste, where as is neither wind ne rain, nor tempest, nor other impression,
and there be some mountains that atteyneth unto it, as is olimpus that recheth
the highest region of the air, and the element of fire mounteth unto the sky,
and the elements susteyneth the skies as the pyllers or beams susteyneth a
house Of such mountains is one in Affryke named Athlas. After that is the
element of fire that is neither ^^ambe ne coals, but is pure and invisible. for
the great bryghtenes, for of so much as the water is more clear and light then
the earth, and the air, more clear and light then the water, of so much the
fire is more clear, light and fayrer then the air, and the skies in equypo^ent
bin clerer, lyghter and fayrer then the fire, the which tourneth with the
mo^inges of the heavens and the next region of the air also, in the which is
engendered c^n^c^^s that bin called sterres for that they bin shyninge and
moves as the sterres. After the saying of some shephardes the fire is
inuysible for his subtilitie and not for his clerenes, for of as much as a
thing is more cler of ^o much it is the more vysible, for we se the skies well,
but not the fire, for it is over much more subtyl then the air that is
invisible, for the same cause, the earth and the water bin thycke, and therefore
they bin vysyble. The skies been neither properley heavy ne light, hard ne
soft, clear ne dark, hot ne cold sweet ne sour, color ne sown, ne such
other qualities, save that they bin hot in virtue, for they may cause heat
here de^ethe by their lights, mouynges and influeuces, and been improprely
hard, for they may not be denyded ne broken. And also they been improprely
colors of light in some parties, and been thycke, as bin the parties of the
sterres. In the which there may no star ne other party be adusted and put
to, nor none may be demynyshed ne taken away, and they may neither increase ne
ware less, or be of other figure then round, ne they may not change, enpayre
ne wax old, ne be corrumped, ne altered, but in light only, as in time of
the eclyps of the son and moon, ne they may not rest and stand still, ne
turn any otherwise, later ne sooner, in party ne in all, ne behave them
otherwise, then after their common course^ but by miracle divine, and therefore
the sterres and skies been of another nature then the elements and the things
of them composed, the which been transmutable and corruptable. The elements
and all things of them composed bin enclosed within the first sky, as the
yolke of an egg is enclosed within the white, and the first sky is enclosed
of the second, and the second in the third, and the third in the fourth,
and so of the other. The first sky next the elements is the sky of the moon
next is the sky of Mercury. And next it the sky of Uenus, then is the sky
of the son, then it of Mars, then that of Jupiter, and after it of Saturn.
And thus bin the skies of the planettes after their order. The eight sky is of
sterres fyxed, and bin called so for that they move more regulerly and after
one guyse then the planettes do. Then above that is the first mobyle, in the
which notinge apperethe that Shepardes may se. Some Shepardes say that above
this ix. skies is one inmoble, for it tourneth not, and above that is one of
Crystal, over the which is the sky imperyal, in the which is the throne of
Godde, of the which sky Shepardes ought not to speak, but only of the first
mobyle, and that it conteyneth all together called the world. Of one thing they
marueale much, that is how God has distributed the sterres, that he has put
none in the nynth sky, and has put so many in the right sky, that they may
not be nombred, and in each of the other vii. but one only, in calling the
son and the moon sterres, as appears in the figure hereafter.

Here after the great master sheparde shows more plainly of the iiii.
elements, and of the symylitude of the earth, and how that every planet is one
above another, and tells which of them bin masculine, as these five, Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Sol and Mercury. And of two femynyne, as Uenus and Luna: and
which of them is northly and southly: and which been Oriental or occydentall.
Capitulo xxxii.
Of the mouynges of the skies and planettes.


SOme mouinges bin of the skies and planets that excedeth the understanding of
Shepardes, as the mouynge of the firmament in the which bin the sterres
ageynste they first mobyle in an hundred year one degree, and the mouynge of
the planets in their episcycles, of the which how well ye Shepardes be not
ignorant of al, yet they make no mencyon here, so, it suffices them only of
two whereof the one is from. Orient into Occident above the earth, and from
occident in the Orient under it, that is called the dyurnall mouynge, that is
to say, that it makes from day to day, xxiiii. hours by the which mouynge
the ix. sky that is the first mobyle, draws after and makes the other
skies to turn that been under it. The other mouynge is of the.vii. planettes,
and is from Occident to Orient above the earth, and from Orient into the
Occident under it, and is contrary to the first, and been the two mouynges that
Shepardes knowlegeth, and how well that they been opposites, yet move they
contynually and bin possible as it is showed by example. If a ship on the sea
came from Orient into Occident, and that he of his own mouyng went in the
ship softly toward Orient, this man should move a double mouyng whereof one
snuld be of the ship, and of himself together, and the other should be of his
own mouynge that he makes softely toward Orient. Semblably ye planettes been
transported with their sky from Oryent into Occidente by the dyurnall mouynge
of the first mobyle, but later and otherwise then the fyxed sterres, by that,
that each planete has his propre mouinge contrary to the mouynge of the
sterrer, for the moon makes a course less in a monthe about the earth then
a sterre fyxed, and the son a course less in a year, and the other planettes
in certain time each after the quantity of his mouyng. Thus it appears that
the planettes move two mouynges: some Shepardes say, pose by imagnation that all
the skies seassed to move of the daily mouinge, the moon would make a course
in going from the Occide^t into the Orient in as much time as lasts
now.xxvii. days, and viii. hours, and Mercury^ Uenus, and Sol would make in
manner course in the space of a year, and Mars in two year or there about, and
Saturn in xxx year or there about. For now they make their ^ourse or
reuolucions, and accomplish their propre mouynges in the time he^e named. The
propre mouynges of Planettes is not straight from Occydence to Orient, but it
is as sydewe, and Shepardes se them sensyble for when they se the moon before a
sterre one night, the second or the third night it is behind not straight
toward Orient, but shallbe drawed one time toward Septemtrion, and another
time toward Mydday, and this is because of the latitude of the zodyake, in the
which be the xii. signs under whom the Planettes raygneth.

Of the Equinoctial and zodyake that be in the.ix. skies that contains the
firmament under it Capitulo.xxxiii.
IN the concaue of the first mobyle Shepardes imaigneth to be the two cyrcles,
and they bin their royally, the on^ is as small as a threde, and it is called
Equinoctial, and the other is large in manner of a gyrdle, or as a garlande of
flowers, which they call the zodyake, and these two cyrcles deuideth the one
and the other egally, but not straight. For the zodyake crosses crokedly, and
the places where it crosses bin said Equinoctialles. For to understand the
Equinoctial^ we se sensybly all the sky turn from Orient into Occident, and
it is called the daily mouynge or diurnal, the^ ought one to imagine a straight
like that passes through the myddle of the earth, coming from the one end of
the sky to the other, about the which line is made this mouynge, and the two
ends been two points in the sky that moves not, and been called the poles of
the world, of the which one is over us, by the sterre of the north, that
always apereth to us, and is the pole Artike or Septemtrional, and the other
is under the earth, always hyd called the pole Antartike, or pole Austral, in
the mids of the which pole in the first mobile is the circle Equinoctial
egally before in the party, as in the other of the said poles, and after this
cyrcle is made and measured the daily moving of xxiiii. hours that is a
natural day and it is called Eqinoctial, for that when the son is in it, the
day and the night been equal through all the world. The large zodyake as said
is in the first mobyle, also it is as a girdle manerly fygured and set with
Images of signs entrayled subtylly and well composed, and set with fyxed
sterres as shyning carbuncle or precious gemmes full of great virtue, set by
maistrysse right nobly adourned, in the which zodyake be four principal
points, that deuideth them equally in four parties. One is hye called the
solstyce of so^mer. which when the son is entered in Cancer, it is the longest
day of Summer. Another is low called the solstice of winter, which is when the
son is entered in Capricorn, then it is the shortest day of winter, and mean
call it equinoctial of harvest that the son enters in Libra in the month of
September. And the other is called Equinoctial of prymetime that the son
enters in Aries in the month of March. The which four parties divided each
in three equal parties makes twelve parties, that been called signs, named
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Uirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. Aryes begins in the Equinoctial, and
crosses the zodyake, and when the son is, there it begins to declyne,
that is to say, aprochyng Septemtrion, and toward us it extends to the
orient Then is Taurus second, Gemini the third, and so of other as the
figure, hereafter shows. Also every sign is divided in.xxx. degrees, and be
in the zodyake.ccc.lx. degrees, and every degree divided by.lx. mynutes every
mynute in.lx. secondes, every second in.lx. thyrdes, and this division
suffiseth for Shepardes.

Here follows the story of the twelve signs. Ca. xxxiii.


SHepardes knowelegeth a subtle variation in the sky: and is for three
sterres fy^^d be not under the same degrees of the Zodyake that they were
created bi^ouse of the mouinge of the Firmament, the which ben against the
first mobyle in an hundred year of one degree, for the which mutation the son
may have other regard to a ste^re, and other signification then it had in
the time passed, and also when the books were made, for that the sterre has
hanged his degree or Sign under which it was.

And this often times causes them that make Prognosticatyons and judgments
coming to fail.

All thee cyrcles of the sky been narrow and small, except the zodyake, which
is large, and conteyneth in length three hundred and three score degrees, and
of largenes twelve, the which largeness is divided by the mids, six degrees
on the one sign and six on the other, and this deuysion is made by a line
named eclyptyke and is the way of the son, for the son never departs
under that line, and thus it is always in the myddle of the zodyake, but the
other planets been always on the one side, or of the other of the said line
save when they been the ^^ade or in the tail of the Dragon, as the moon that
passes twyse in a month, and it happen when it renews it is Eclyps of the
son, and if it happen the full moon, and that it be right under the nadyr of
the son it is general Eclyps, and if it be but a party it is not seen: when
it is Eclyps of the son it is not general through all the clymates but only
in some, ^u when it is eclyps of the Moon it is general over all.

Of two great circles, that is to say one Meridien, and the other Oryson, that
intersequeth the one the other, and crosses dyrectly.
MEridien is a great circle imagined on the sky, which passes by the poles of
the world, and by the point of the sky right over our heads, the which is
called Zenych, and when the son is commen over fro Orient unto that circle it
is midday, and therefore it is called Meridien, and the half of that circle is
over the earth and the other under it that passes by the point of midnight
directly opposite to Zenych, and when the son touches the part of the circle
it is midnight, and if a man go toward Orient or Occident he has new Meridien,
and therefore it is sooner midday to them that be toward Orient then to other,
if a man stand still his Meridien is one still, or if he go toward mydday or
septemtrion, but if he stir he has other Zenych, and these two cyrcles
crosses directly: oryzon is a great circle that deuideth the party of the
sky that we see from that we se not. And Shepardes say that if that a man were
in a plain country he should se justly half of the sky, the which they call
their emyspery, that is to say half spear and orizon is joining nyghe to the
earth, of the which orizon the enter is the myddle, and is the place in the
which we been, thus each is always in the mids of his oryson, and zenich is
the pole, and as a man transporteth him fro one place to another, he is in the
other places against the sky and has other zenych and other ozyron, all
oryson is right other oblyke. They have right ozyron that habydeth under the
Equinoctial, and have their zenych in the eqinoctial, ^or their ozyron
intersequeth and deuydeth the equinoctial even by the two poles of the world,
in such wise that none of the poles of the world is raised above their ozyron,
ne deprived ynder it, but they that habiteth other where then under equinoctial
have their ozyron oblyke, for their ozyrn follows and deuydeth the
equinoctial sydeway, and not right, and there appears to the^ of all times
one of the poles of the world raised above their ozyron, and the other ben
ever hyd, so that they se them not, more or less after diverse habitations, and
after that they be of fernesse fro the Equinoctial, and the more that the one
pole is raised the more is the ozyron oblyke, and the other pole depryued and
is to wete that there is as much distance fro the ozyron to the pole, as is ^^o
the zenych to the Equinoctial, and that zenych is the fourth part of meridien
or the mids of the bow dyurnall, of the which the two ends be on the
ozyron. And also that of the pole unto the equinoctial is the fourth party of
all the roundnesse of the skies, and also of the meridien circle sith it
passes by the poles and crosses the equinoctial directly. Example of the
ozyron of Paris after the opinion of Shepardes, over the which Ozyron they say
that the pole is raised xli^. degrees, wherefore they say also that fro the
zenich of Paris unto the equinoctial be.xlix. degrees, and that fro the Ozyron
unto the Zenych is the fourth party of the Meridien oyrcle be.lxxxx. degrees,
and fro the pole to the zenych be.xli. degrees, and fro the pole unto the
solstyce of Summer be.lxii. degrees, and fro the solstyce unto the equinoctial
ben.xxxiii. degrees, there be fro the pole unto the equinoctial.lxxxx.
degrees, and is the fourth part of the roundnes of the sky, from the
equinoctial unto the solstyce of Winter be.xxxiii. degrees, and fro the
solstice unto the ozyron.xviii. Thus shall the equinoctial be raised over the
ozyron.xli. degrees, and the solstyce of summer.lxiiii. degrees, in the which
solstyce is the son at the hour of noone the longest day of summer, and then
it enters into Cancer and is most nerest to our habytable parties that may be.
And when the son is in the solstyce of Winter, the shortest day of the year
at the hour of noone it enters into Capricornus: and the said solstyce is not
raised over the ozyron of Paris but viii. degrees. The which eleuations and
rysings a man may find plainly so that he know one only, and in every region
in likewise after the situation.

Of the two other great cyrcles of the sky, and four small.
TWo great circles ben on the Sky named colors, that deuideth the skies in
four egall parties, and crosses their self directly, the one pas^seth by the
poles of the world, and by the two solstices, and the other (...) the poles
also, and by the two equinoctials. The first small cyrcle is called the cyrcle
Artyke because of the pole zodyake about the pole Artyke, and his lyk^ is to
his opposite, named the cyrcle Antartyke. The other two be named Tro^pykes, the
one of summer, and the other of winter. The Tropyke of somme^ is cause of the
solstyce of summer, beginning of Cancer, and the tropike of win^ter of the
solstice of winter beginning of Capricorn, and ben egally distant on^ circle
fro the other. Here ought to be noted that the distaunces of the pole ar^tyke
to the cyrcle artyke, and the distaunce of the tropike of summer to the
E^quinoctiall, and that of the equinoctial to the tropike of winter, and from
the cyrcle antartyke to the pole antartyke are just egal each of.xxiii. degrees
and a^ half or there about, then the distaunce fro the equinoctial to the
tropike o^ summer, and fro the cyrcle artyke to the pole make together.xlvii.
degrees. The which take away of the quarter between the pole and the
equinoctial, where as ben.lxxxx. degrees, save that there abides.xliii. that been the distaunce be^twene the tropyke of winter and the cyrcle antartyke, and
these cyrcles been said little, for they be not so great as the other,
nevertheless they be divided each by.ccc.lx. degrees as the greatest.

Of the rising and resconsyng of the signs in the ozyron. Capitulo.xxxv.
Ozyron and emyspery differred, for ozyron is the cyrcle that deuydeth the
party of the sky that we se from that under the earth that we se not. Also
Ozyron is a cyrcle that moves not, but as we move fro one place to another,
but emyspery turns continually, for one party ry^eth and mounteth over
Ozyron, and the other part resconseth and enters under it, thus Ozyron ryseth
ne resconseth, but ye comes above rysethe, and that which goes under
resconseth, Merydien also ryseth not ne resconseth. Equi noctiall is the
diurnell circle that ryseth and resconseth regulerly, as much in one hour as
in another, and all in xxiiii. hours zodyake the large cyrcle, and oblyke
whereon the signs been, ryseth and resconseth al on a day natural, but not
regulerly, for it ryseth more in one hour then in an other, for that is ever
over our ozyron is oblyke, and deuydeth the zodyake in two parts, whereof one
is ever over our ozyron, and the other underneath. Thus half of the signs
ryseth over our ozyron every day artificial be it short or long, and the
other half by night, wherefore it behooves that in the days that be shorter
then the nyghtes the signs rises sooner, and in long days more at leyser,
and thus the zodyake ryseth not regulerly in these parties as the Equinoctial,
but there is double variacio^, for half of the zodyake that is from the
beginning of Aries unto the end of Uirgo al together takes as much time in
rysynge as half of the Equinoctial that is by it, and they begin to rise in a
moment, and end in a momente also. But this half of the zodyake rysethe
sooner in the beginning, and this half of the Equinoctial more at leyser, and
this is called their obliquement. Also the other half of the zodyake that is
from the beginning of Libra unto the end of Pisces, and half of the
Equinoctial that is by it, begins and leueth to rise together but the
Equinoctial in that party in the beginning ryseth sooner, and the zodyake more
at leyser, and this is called rysyng directely. And whether that ryseth sooner
the Equinoctial or the zodyake, yet always they end together. Example of the
two mouynges aforesaid, as if two men went from London to Uvyndsore and
departed both together and that at the beginning the one go fast and the
other softely, he that goth ^as^ should be sooner in the midway the^ the other
but if he that went fast to the midway go softely, and the other fast, they
shall be both at once in Wyndsore. Also the half of the zodyake from the
beginning of Cancer, unto the end of Sagittary in rysinge ^ereth more then
^alfe the Equinoctial, so that this half ryseth all right, and the other half
of the zodyake ryseth oblykely.

Of the deuysyons of the earth, and of the regyons. Capitulo.xxxvi.


FIrst or we speak of the sterres and knowledge that Shepardes have we will say
of the deuysion of the earth, and of his parties after thy^ opinion. Wherefore
it is to be note^ that the earth is round, and therefore as a man goes from
one counttrey t^ another, he has other ozyron then h^ had, and there appears
other part^ of the sky, and if a man went from Septemtrion straight toward
Mid^day, the pole Artike to him shall be less^ raised, that is to say, more nigh
ap^proching to the earth, and if he wen^ contrariwise it should be more reised
that is to say, apperyng higher, an^ therefore if he went toward mydday under a
meridien whele that the pol^ Artyke were less raised over his ozyron by the
xxx. part of one of the vi. part of the arc Meridien, he should pass the xxx.
part of the vi. parties of half the circute of the earth, and to him the pole
should be less raised by one degre^ or to the contrary till it were more raised
of one degree, then he should pass^ one degree of the circuit of the Earth,
of the which all the degrees toge^ther ben.ccc.lx. And one degree of the earth
conteyneth.xiii. leges, and a half or there about, and every lege is two mile:
And as the spear of the sky is de^uided by the four less circles five
parties called Zones, so the earth is deu^^ded into five regions, whereof the
first is between the pole artyke and the ci^^cle artyke. The second between is
the circle artyke and the tropike of somme^^ The third is between the tropike
of summer and the tropike of winter. The fourth is between the tropike of
winter and the cyrcle Antartike. The fyft b^^twene the circle antartyke and the
pole Antartyke. Of the which parties (...) the earth some Shepards say that the
first and the fyfth bin inhabitable, (...) their over great coldness, for they
ben to far from the son. The third th^^ is in the middle is to nere under
the way of the soune, and is inhabitable (...) the great heat. The other two
parties, the second and the fourth be not (...) nere no to far fro the son,
but be moderate in heat and cold, and therefore they ben habitable if there
be none other lettyng, and pose that it be true, (...) it is not possible to
pass over thwart the region under the way of the some called zone, turned to
go fro the second to the fourth. For some shepards wo^^ have passed that would
have showed of it, wherefore they say that there is (...) region habyted, but
the second wherein we and all other ben.

Of the variation that is for diverse habitations and regions of the earth. Cap.
xxxvii.
SHepeherdes say that if it were possible that the earth were inhabyted all
about, and pose the case that it were so, first they that inhabit under the
Equinoctial have always the days and the nights equal, and have the.ii.
poles of the world at the two corners of their orizon, and may see all the
sterres when they see the two poles, and the sun passes twyse in a year over
them, that is when it passes by the Equinoctials. Thus the sun is to them
the one half of the year toward the pole Artike, and the other half toward
the other pole, and therefore they have two winters in a year without great
cold, one is when we have winter, and the other when we have summer. Semblably
they have two summers, one is in March when we have prime time, and the other
in September when we have harvest, and by this they have four solstices, two
hie when the sun passes by their zenich, and two low when it declineth one
way or other, and thus they have four vmbres or shadows in a year, for when
the sun is in the equinocces twice in a year, in the morninge their shadows
be in the Occidente, and at night in the Orient, and then at noone they have
no shadows, but when the sun is in the signs septentrionals their shadows
be toward the parties of the signs meridionals, and so againeward. Secondly
they that inhabit between the Equinoctial and the Tropike of summer, have in
likewise two summers and two winters, and four shadows in a year, and they
have no difference of the first, save that they have longer days in summer,
and shorter in winter, for as the Equinoctial lengeth, in likewise does the
days in summer, and in that part of the earth is the first climate and almost
half of the second, and is named Araby wherein is Ethiopia. Thirdly they that
inhabit under the Tropike of summer have the sun over their heads, and at
the day of the solstice of summer at noone, they have their shadows smaller
then we have, and there is a part of Ethiopic. Fourthly they that be between
the Tropike of summer and the circle Artike have longer days in summer then
the abouesayde, in as much as they be farther from the Equinoctial, and
shorter in winter, and they have the sun over their heads, ne toward
septentrion, and that part of the earth we inhabit. Fifthly they that inhabit
under the circle Artike have the ecliptike of the zodiake to their orizon, and
when the sun is in the solstice of summer, it resconseth not, and thus they
have no night, but natural days of.xxiiii. hours. Semblably when the sun is
in the solstice of winter it is natural day when they have contynuall night,
and that the sun ryseth not to them. Sixthly they that be between the circle
Artike and the pole Artike, have in summer diverse natural days, that be to
them one day artificial without any night. And also in winter be many natural
days, which are to them always night, and the more that it approaches the
pole, the more is the artificial day of summer long, and dureth in some place
a weke, in other a month, in other two, in other three, in other more, and
proporcionally the night is greater, for some of the signs be ever on their
Oryzon, and some always under, and as long as the Sun is in the signs
above it is day, and while it is in the signs underneath it is night. Seventhly
they that inhabit right under the pole have the sun half of the year on
their Orizon, and have continual day, and the other half of the year
continual night, and the Equinoctial is in their orizon that deuideth the
signs, six above and six beneath, wherefore when the sun is in the signs
that be hye, and toward them they have continual day: and when it is in the
signs toward midday, they have continual night, and thus in a year they have
but one day and one night. And as it is said of that part of the earth toward
the pole Artyke, a man may understand of the other half, and of the
habitations toward the pole Antartike.

The division of the earth, and only of the part inhabited
SHepherdes and other as they divide the earth inhabitable in.vii. parts that
they call climates. The first Diamerous. The second climate Diaciens. The.iii.
Dalixandry. The.iiii. Diarhodes. The v. climate Dia^omes. The.vi. Daboristines.
The.vii. Diatipheos. Of the which each has his longitude determined, and the
latitude also, and the nerer they be to the Equinoctial the longer they be,
and larger, and proceed in longitude from Orient to Occident, and in latytude
from midday to septentrion. The first climate after some Shepherds conteyneth
in length half of the circuit of the earth, that is two hundred thousand
and.iiii. hundred mile, and it has an hundred thousand and two hundred mile
of length. The second, and so of the other, for the lessing of the earth
coming toward Septentrion. To understand what a clymate is after the saying
of Shepardes. A clymate is a space of earth equally large, whereof the length is
from Orient to Occident, and the breadth is coming fro midday, and fro the
earth in habitable toward the Equinoctial drawing to septentrion, as much as
an ^^rolege or clock changes not. For in earth habitable the clockes
change.vii. times in the breadth of the climates. It is of necessity to say
that they be.vii. and where the variation of horologes is, there is the
dyuersitie of clymates, how be it that such variation properly ought to be
taken in the mids of the clymates, and not in the beginning or end, for the
proximitie and couenaunce the one of the other. Also one climate has always a
day artificial of so^mer shorter or longer then another climate, and this day
shows the difference in the mids of every climate better then in the
beginning or end, the which thing we may sensibly know at eye, and thereby
judge the difference of the clymates. And it is to be noted that under the
Equinoctial the days and the nyghtes in all times are equal, each of twelve
hours, but coming toward Septentrion the days of summer longs, and the
winter days shorteth, and the more that one aprocheth septentrio^ the more
waxes the days in such wise, that at the fine of the last clymate the days
in summer be longer by three hours and an half, then they be at the beginning
of the first, and the pole is more raised by.xxxviii. degrees. At the beginning
of the first clymate, the longest day of summer has xii. hours and xlv.
minutes, and in the pole is raised on the oziron xii. degrees and xlv. mynutes,
and the mids of the clymate the longest day has.xiii. hours, and the pole
raised.xvi. degrees, and the latytude dureth unto the longest day of summer,
that is.xiii. hours and.xv. minutes, and the pole raised.xx. degrees and an
half, the which largenes is.ccc.xl. mile of earth. The second clymate
begins at the end of the first, and the mids is there as the day
has.xiii. hours and an half, and the pole is raised over the ozyron.xxiiii.
degrees and.xv. mynutes. And the latytude dureth unto there as the longest day
has.xiii. hours and.xlv. mynutes, and the pole is raised.xxvii. degrees and
an half, and this largenes conteyneth of earth, cccc. mile just. The third
clymate begins at the end of the second, and the mids is there as the
day has.xiii. hours, and the pole is raised xxx. degrees and.xlv, minutes,
and the latytude extends unto there as the lo^gest day has.xiiii. hours
and.xv. mynutes, and the pole is raised.xxiii. degrees, and.xl. mynutes. The
fourth clymate at the end of the third, and the mids is there as the longest
day has.xiiii. hours and an half, and the pole is raised.xxvi. degrees
and.xx. mynutes, the latytude dureth unto there as the longest day has.xiii.
hours and xlv. mynutes, and the pole is raised.xxx. degrees, and the largenes
conteyneth of earth.ccc mile. The fyfth clymate begins at the end of the
fourth, and the mids is there as the longest day has, xv. hours, and the
pole is raised.xli. degrees and.xx. mynutes, and the latytude dureth unto there
as the longest day has xv. hours and xv. mynutes, and the pole is raised
xliii. degrees and an half, and the largenes conteyneth of earth cclii. mile.
The vi. clymate begins at the end of the fyfth, and the mids is there as
the longest day has xv. hours and an half and the pole is raised over the
ozyron xlv. degrees and xxiii. mynutes, of the which the largenes dureth unto
there as the longest day has xv. hours and xlv. mynutes, the which largenes
conteyneth of earth cc.xii. mile. The vii. clymate begins at the end of the
syxt, and the mids is there as the longest day has xvi. hours, and the
pole is raised xlviii. degrees and xl. mynutes, the latytude extends unto
there as the longest day has xvi hours and xv. minutes, and the pole is
raised fifty degres and an half, and the largenes of the earth conteyneth
clxxxvi. mile.

A marvelous consyderation of the great understanding of Shepeherdes.
IF case were after the length of the climates one might go about the earth fro
Orient to Occident to his first place, some Shepards say that this compass may
almost be made. Saying that if a man went this compass in.xii. natural days
going regulerly toward Occident and began now at midday, he should pass every
day natural the.xii. part of the circuit of the earth, and be.xxx. degrees
whereof behooves that the son make a course about the earth, and.xxx. degrees
ferther or he be returned on the morrow at the merydien of the said man, and
so the said man should have his day and night of.xxvi. hours, and should be
farther by the.xii. part of a natural day then if he rested him, wherefore it
follows of necessity, that in xii. natural days the said man should only
have but xi. days and.xi. nights and somewhat less, and that the sun should
light him but.xi. times, and resconse.xi times, for.xi. days and.xi. nights,
every day and night of.xxvi. hours makes.xii. natural days, each day
of.xxiiii. hours. By semblable consideration behooves that an other man that
should make this course going toward Orient have his day and night shorter then
a natural day by.ii. hours, then his day and night should be but of.xii.
hours. Then if be made this course in like space, that is to say in.xii. days
and somewhat more. Thus if John made the course toward Occident, and Peter
toward Orient, and that Robert abode them at the place fro whence they
departed the one as soon as the other, and that they meet at Robert both
together. Peter would say that he had two days and two nights more then John,
and Robert that had rested a day less then Peter, and a day more then John,
how well that they have made this course in.xii. natural days, or an
hundred, or in ten year, all is one. This is a pleasant consideration among
shepardes, how John and Peter arriueth one self day, put case it were on
sunday. John would say it is saturday, Peter would say it is monday, and Robert
would say it is sunday.

Of the Pomell of the skies a sterre named the sterre of the North, near to
pole Artike called Septentrionall. Cap. xxxviii.
AFter the abouesaid things here will we speak of some sterres in particular.
And first of them that Shepards call the pomel of the skies, or sterre of the
north, wherefore we ought to know that we see sensibly the sky turn from
Orient to Occident by the diurnal moving that is of the first mobile, which is
made on two points opposites that be the poles of the sky, of the which one we
see, and it is the pole Artike, and the other we see not, that is the pole
Antartike or of midday, which is always hyd under the earth. By the pole Artike
that we see is the sterre most approached that shepards call the pomell of the
sky, the which they say is the highest and most steadfast from us, and by the
which they have the knowledge that they have of the other sterres and parts of
the sky. The sterres that be by the said pomel go never under the earth, of
the which be the sterres that make the chariot, and diverse other, but they that
be far from it, go sometime under the earth, as the sun, the moon, and other
planets. Under this pomel directly is the angle of the earth, in the place
where against the sun is at the hour of midnight.

Of Andromeda a sterre fyxed.
Aries is a sign hot and dry, that governs the head of man and the face, and
the regions, Babylon, Percy, and Araby. And sygnifieth small trees, and under
him at the.xvi. degree ryseth a sterre fyxed named Andromeda, that Shepardes
figureth a maid in her hair upon the brinke of the sea, set to be devoured of
the monsters of the sea, but Perseus son of Jupiter fought with his sword
against the said monster and slew it, and then the said Andromeda was
delivered. They that be borne under her constellation be in danger of prison,
or to dye in prison, but if a good planet take regard, then escape not death
and prison. Aries is the exaltacion of the sun at the.xix. degree, and Aries
is the house of Mars with Scorpio where he is most.

Of Perseus a sterre fyxed lord of the spear.
Taurus has the trees, plants, and ympes, and governs of man the neck and
the throat bol, the regions, Ethiopy, Egypt, and the country about, and under
the.xxii. degree rises a sterre fyxed of the first magnitude, that shepardes
call Perseus son of Jupiter, that smote of the head of Meduse, who made all
them to dye that beheld ber, and by no manner they might eschew it. Shepardes
say that when Mars is conjoined with this sterre, they that be borne under the
constellation shall ha^^e their heads smitten of, if God shape not remedy, and
sometime they call this sterre lord of the sword, and figure him a man naked
with a sword in one hand, and in the other the head of Meduse and looks not
on it. And Taurus is the exaltacion of the Moon in the.iii. degree.

Of Ozyron a sterre fyxed and his fellows.
Gemini signifies large, good courage, wit, beauty, clergy, and governs of
man the shoulders, arms, and hands, and the regions, Iugen, Armony, Cartage,
and has the small trees. And under the.xviii. degree ryseth a sterre fixed,
named Oziron and with it.xxxvi. other sterres, and is figured, a man armed in
mayle, and a sword g^rde about him^ and signifies great captains. They that
be borne under the constellation be in danger to be slain by treason, if good
fortune be not with them. Gemini and Uirgo be the houses of Mercury, but Uirgo
is it in which he ioyeth most, and Gemini in the third degree is the exaltacion
of the dragons head.

Of Alhabor a sterre fyxed.
Cancer domineth the long and equal trees, and of the body of man the breast,
the heart, the stomach, the side the lyghtes, and the longes, the regions,
Armony the little, and the region of Orient. And there ryseth under it in the
eight degree a sterre fyxed that Shepardes call Alhabor, that is to say the
great dog, and they say that they which be borne under the constellacion,
and that be in the ascending or the mids of the sky it signifies good
fortune, and if the Moon be with it, and the party of fortune, he that in it
shall be borne, shall not be very rich, and Cancer is the house of the Moon, and
is the exaltacion of Jupiter in the.xv. degree.

Of a sterre fyxed named the Lions heart.
Leo has the great trees, that is to say he signoureth over them, and
signifies on hasty man full of anger and of anguish, and of the body of man it
beholds the heart properly, the back and the sides, and of regions Artitry
unto the end of the earth habitable, and under the xxxiii. degree ryseth a
sterre fyxed, named the Lions heart, and they that be borne under the
constellation as Shepardes say, shall be mounted in his signouryes, or in
great offices, and afterward shall be deprived or put down, and be in danger
of their lines, but if some good planet behold the said sterre they may be
saved. Leo is the house of the sun, and Aries is the exaltacion of the sun
as it is said.

Of the sterre fyxed named Nebuluse, and of an other named the golden Cup.
Uirgo governs all that is sown on earth, and sygnifieth a man of good
courage, philosophy, largess, and of all manner of scyences, and keeps of man
the belly and the entrayles, and the regions Asgeramita, Assen, that is a
regio^ by Jerusalem, Eufrates, and the isle of S^ayne. Under the longitude or
xv. degree rises a ster fixed named Ne^^luse or tail of the Lion, and is in
the septentrional latitude of the said sign of virgo, under the which sign
ryseth an other fyxed sterre which Shepards call the golden Cup, and is in
the xiii. degree of the said sign toward the party me^idionall. The which
sterre is of the nature of Uenus and of Mercury, and sygnifyeth that they which
be borne under the said constellation to know of things worthy and sacred.

Of the Porke espyke a sterre fyxed.
Under the sign of Libra that domyneth the great trees, and sygnifyeth
Justice, and of a man it governs the reins, and the nether part of the
belly, and regions, the country of Romany, and of Greece. Under the xviii.
degree ryseth a sterre fyxed that Shepherdes call Porke espyke. They that been
borne under the constellation ben well shapen, and ben honest, and do things
that folk marueyle on, and reioyseth, and sygnifyeth richesse by honesty, and
precious marchaundyse, and been commonly loved of Lords and Ladies, and Libra
is one of the houses of Uenus, and Taurus the other, in the which she reioyseth
most, and is the exaltacion of Saturn, for the wether begins to wax cold
in this month of Septembre, and Saturn is the planette and Lord of cold,
that exalts when he enters into the sign of Libra.

Of the Crown septentrionall a sterre fyxed.
The Scorpion domineth the trees that been of longitude and largeness, and
signifies falsenesse, and of the body of man governs the privy places, and
the regions of Heberget, and the field of Araby, in the second degree ryseth
a sterre that Shepardes call the Crown septentrionall, the which when it is in
the ascendynge in the mids of the sky, gives honor and exaltacion to them
that been borne under the constellation, and specially when it is well beholden
of Sol, the Scorp^on is one of the houses of Mars, in the which he reioyseth
most, and Aries is the other, and is the sign wherein Mars begins to fall
from his exaltation.

Of the Scorpions heart a sterre fyxed.
The Sagittary sygnifyeth a man full of engyne and wise, and governs the
thyghes of man, and regions, Ethiopye, Maharobem, and Aenych. Under his first
degree ryseth a sterre fyxed of the first magnitude, the which shepardes call
the Scorpyons heart, which when it is well beholden of Jupiter or Uenus, it
reyseth them that be borne under his constellation to great honor and riches,
but when it is evil beholden of Saturn o^ of Mars, it puts them that be
borne under it to pouertie^ The Scorpion is the house of Jupiter, in the which
he rejoices most, and Pisces is his other house, and so is the said Sagittary
the exaltation of the Dragons tail.

Of the flyeng Egle a sterre fyxed.
Capricornus sygnifyeth a man of good life, wise, yrefull, and of great
thought, and governs the knees of man, and the regyons, Ethyopye, Araby,
Gehamen, and to the two seas, and under his.xxviii. degree ryseth a sterre that
Shepherdes call the flyenge Egle, that signifies the sovereign Emperors or
kings. They that be borne under his constellation when they be well beholden
of the sun and of Jupiter, mounteth in great seignoryes, and ben loved of
kings and princes. Capricornus and Aquarius ben the houses of Saturn, but he
reioyseth in Aquary most, and the said Capricornus is the exaltation of Mars.

Of the fysh meridionall a sterre fyxed.
Under Aquarius that keeps the legs of man to the ancles of the feet, and
the regions of Hazenoth, Alempha, and part of the land of Alphege, and a part
of Egypt. In the xxi. degree rises a sterre that shepards call the fish
meridionall. They that be borne under his constellation be happy in fyshing in
the sea of Midday, and under the.ix. degree of the said sign ryseth the
Dolphin that sygnifieth lordship on the sea, pondes, and ryuers, and as it is
said Aquarius is the house of Saturn in which he rejoices.

Of Pegasus that signifies the horse of honor a sterre fyxed.
Pisces governs of man the feet, and signifies a man subtyle, wise, and of
diverse colors, and has regyons, Tabrasen, Iurgen, and all the habitable part
that is Septentrion, and part of Romany, and under the.^v. degree of the said
sign, rises a sterre that Shepards call Pegasus, that is the horse of honor,
and the figure in form of a fair horse. They that be borne under his
constellation shall be honored among great Capitayns and Lords. When Uenus is
with it, they be loved of great Ladies, if the said sterre be in the mids of
the sky in the discending, and Pisces is one of the houses of Jupiter, and
Sagittarius the other, in the which he reioyseth most, and the said Pisces in
the.xxvii. degree is the exaltation of Uenus.

Of the division of the.xii. houses, as well in the earth as in the heavens.
Cap. xxxix.


THe heavens and the earth may be divided in four parts by two circles, which
crosses directly over the two poles, and crosses four times the Equinoctial
line. Each of the four parts divided into three equally, is in all.xii. equal
parts, as well in the sky as in the earth, which shepherds call houses, and be
twelve. Of the which six be always above the earth, and six under it, and
these houses moves not, but be always each in their place, and the signs and
planets passes by them always once in.xxiiii. hours. Three of these houses be
from Orient to midnight going under the earth, the first the second and the
third, whereof the first under the earth, beginnineth at Orient named the house
of life. The second house of substance and riches. The third that finisheth
at midnight is the house of fraternity. The fourth that begins at midnight
coming in Occident is named the house of partrimony. The fifth following is the
house of sons. The sixth finisheth in Occident, under the earth is the house
of sickness. The seventh begins in Occident on the earth, and stretches
toward midday, and is the house of marriage. The eight is the house of death.
The ninth finishinge at midday is called the house of faith, of re^gion, and
pilgrimage. The tenth beginning at midday coming toward Orient is the house of
honor and of regalitie. The eleventh after, that is the house of true
friends. And the twelfth that fynisheth in orient on the earth is named the
house of charity, but this matter is diffycile, for Shepardes knowledging the
nature and property of every of the said twelve houses, and departs them
lightly and suffyseth of that is said with the figure present.

Thus ends of the twelve houses.

QUaliter p^er crescit in ventre matris sue. Primo mense crescit cerebrum
Secundo crescu^t vene. Tertio and quarto habe^it omnia me^bra sua, sed erit

Of the twelve signs, which be good or bad to take iourneys by land or by
water. Cap. xxxix.

ARies is good, Tautus is not so
Gemini and Cancer, will make thee glad
But beware hardely of Leo and Uirgo
Libra for friendship, full hard is Scorpio
Sagittary good, Capricorn peryllous
Aquary by water good, clerks proves so
For best is Pisces, and most plenteous.
How the planets reign in every hour. Ca. xl.


HE that will wete how Shepardes know which planete raygneth every hour of
the day and the night And which planet is good, and which is bad, ought to know
the planette of the day and seek therefore. The first temporal hour of the
son rysynge that day is for the said planet. The second hour is for the
planet ensuynhe, and the third for the other as they been here fygured by
order, and it behooves to go from Sol to Uenus, Mercury and Luna them come
again to Saturn unto xii. that is the hour before the son going down, and
incontinent after the son is down begins the first hour of the night that
is for the.xiii. planet, and the second hour of the night for the xiiii. and
so unto xii. hours for the night, that is the next hour before the son
rysynge and come directly falling upon the xxiiii. planet, that is next before
that of the day following. And thus the day has xii. hours, and the night
xii. also the which be temporal hours, different to the hours of the clockes,
the which be artificials. Shepardes said that Saturn and Mars be evil
planettes. Jupiter and Uenus good, Sol and Luna half good and half evil. The
parey toward a good planet is good and the party toward the evil planet is
naught. Mercury conjoined with a good planette is good, and with an evil
planet he is naught and they understand this as to ^he inflicences good or
evil that bin of the said planetes there following.

The hours of the planets ben different to them of clockes, for the hours of
clockes ben egall at all times each of.lx. minutes, but they of the planets
when the days and the nights be egall that the son is in one of the
equinocces they be egal, but as soon as the days lengtheneth or shortneth, so
does the natural hours, by this it is convenient always for the day to
have.^ii temporal hours, and the night also, and when the days be long, and
the hours long, and when the days ben short and the hours short, in
likewise is the night, and nevertheless an hour of the day, and an hour of
the night together have vi. score minutes, as many as two hours artyficialles,
for that the one leueth the other takes. And take we our planets, fro the
son rising, not before unto the son going down, and all the remenaunt is
night.

Example of that which is abouesayd.


IN Dece^ber the days have but.viii. hours artyficiall ^es of clockes, and
they been xii. te^porals, let the viii. hours artificialles be divided in xii.
egall parts, and it shall be xii. times, xl. minutes, and every party shall be a
temporal hour yt shall be of.xl. minutes and no mo. Thus in Decembre the
te^porall hours of the day have but.xl minutes, but the hours of the night
have four score. For in that time the nights have xvi. hours artificialles,
the which divided in twelve parts ben four score minutes for every temporal
hour. Thus the hours of the nyghtes in Decembre have four score minutes and
xl. for an hour of ye day. there ben six score minutes in two temporal
hours, as many as in two hours artyficialles that be eche^ of xl. minutes. In

MY son thou shall understand
That to avoid all Idleness
This matter often thou take in hand
To read of Shepardes business
And specially of the planets seven
Of Mars, and Saturn that is full hye.
Also of Sol, the myddle heaven
And under him Uenus, Luna and Mercury
For to know their natures all
In soth it is a great cunning
And show what may befall
When every planet is raygning
By their worcking often we been moved
To love lust, and plays of Iolitie
And by sour of them as clerks have proved
They stir us to theft, murder and vilitie
Some be good, some be bad verily
Some be not comfortable to man ne beast.

Some hot, some cold, some moist, some dry,
If three be good, four be worse at the least.
Saturn is highest and coldest, being full bad
And Mars with his bluddy sword, ever ready to kyl,
Jupiter very good, and Uenus makes lovers glad,
Sol and Luna, is half good and half ill,
Mercury is good, and evil verily
And hereafter shall thou know
Which of the seven most worthy be
And who reigns hye, and who a low
Of every planets property
Which is the best among them all
That causes wealth, sorrow, or sin
Tarry and hear sone thou shall
Speak soft, for now I begin.
Of Saturn.
Saturnus significat hominem nigrum and croceu^ ambulando mergentem in terra
qui ponderosus est incessu, adiungens pedes and macer recuruus, habens paruos
occulos siccam cutam: barbam raram labia spissa: calidus ingeniosus, seductor
interfector hominemque corpore pilosum iunctis supercilijs.


Here begins of Saturn the highest of the.vii. Planets.
Saturn is the highest planette of all the seven, he is mighty of him self,
he gives all the great coldes and waters, yet he is dry and cold of nature,
and he comes into Cancer, and his chief signs ben Aquarye and Capricorn,
and he compasses all the other Planettes. For Saturn is next under the first
mobile, that is, under the Crystal sky, the which mobile moves
marvelously, for some Shepardes say that he causes by his mouinge all other
planettes to move, and moves the mobile above.

Saturn is so hye that Shepardes can not well measure it. For so hye reason
has ^ow^r and no farther, and therefore it is more then.xxx. year or he may
run his course. When he does raygne thete is much these used, and little
charity, much lyinge, and much lawynge one against another, and great
prysonment, and much debate and great swearinge. And much plenty of corn, and
also much plenty of hogs, and great travail on the earth, and old folk
shall be very sickely, and many diseases shall reign among the people, and
specially in the chief hours of Saturn, and therefore this planet is likened
to age, as hard, hungry, suspicious, and covetous, that seldom is content
with any thing. For Saturn is enemy to all things that grows and bears
life of nature, for the cold and stormy bitterness of his time.

Of his proprieties.
HE that is borne under Saturn shall be false, enuyous, and full of debate,
and full of law, and he shall be cunning in coryinge of lether, and a great
eater of bread and flesh, and he shall have a stinkynge breath, and he shall be
heavy, thoughtfull, and malycious, a robber, a fyghter, and full of couetyse,
and yet he shall keep council well, and be wise in councelyng, and he shall
love to sin wilfully, he shall be a great speaker of tales, Iustes, and
Chronycles, he shall have little eyes, black hair, great lips, broad
shouldred, and shall look downward. He shall not love sermons, ne to go to the
Church, and beware of his hands, and behold the ratell, and above his ears
the planet does reign. And the children of the said Saturn shall be great
iangelers and chyders, black and lene in the face, thin bearded, evil
langnaged, they shall be full of law and vengeance, and will never forgive till
they be revenged of their quarrel, and like as the planet Saturn is cold, and
causer of great frostes and snowes, ensemblably, and he that is borne under him
shall be cold in charity, and not misericordious and merciful, but vengeable,
and will never be entreated. And also they shall be great cursers, and bear
malice long in their minds, and not forget it, and they look to be obeyed and
to have great reverence, and commonly will praise them selfs, and talk to
them self, and laugh at their own conceyte, and all evils shall grow in them,
and above all colors he shall love black color best. The planet of Saturn
governs of man the ratell and above the ears as is aforesaid, and this
planet is cause of hasty death, for because that he is cold and dry of
nature, and therefore he is lykened to melancoly. And the said Saturn reigns
in Aquary, Capricorn, and Cancer, but specially in Aquary and Capricorn.

Of Jupiter.
Jupiter significat hominem habentem album ruborem in facie, habentem o^culos

corporis, hominemque habentem magnos occulos, pupillam latam barbam crispam.


NExt after the planet of cold Saturn is the noble planet of Jupiter, the
which Jupiter is very pure and clear of nature, and not very hot, but he is all
virtuous. And there is fyxed in Jupiter two noble signs of love, the one is
Pisces, and the other is Sagittary, signs of none evil, nor unhappiness, this

THe planette of Mars is called the God battle and of all war, and he is the
third planette, for he reygnes next under the gentle planette of Jupiter.
This planette Mars is the worst of all other, for he is hot and dry, and
stirs a man to be very wylfull and hastye at once, and to unhappiness, one
of his signs is Aries, and the other is Scorpio, and most he is in those two
signs. He causes all wars and battles, this planet stirs men to bear
wepons as murders, daggers, swerdes, bylles, or bows, or some other wepon of
death, and would ever here of fighting. Therefore let every man beware of the
days of Mars, and in his chief hours that no man fight, for without doubt
if God help him not he shall be marmed or slain. Also the hours of Mars is
perilous meeting with thieves for dread of sleying of true men. And Mars
mounteth into the crabbe, and goes about the.xii. signs in two year, and
thus he runs his course.

capillos parum rubeos: occulos aliquantulum croceos, and mixtam habet natural
cum planeta qui cum eo fuenit dum modo digniorem habeat locum eius insequitur
naturam.


THe Sun is a planet of great renown, and king of all the planets, the sun
norisheth every age, and yet is he hot and dry of nature, and the planet
Saturn is to him full contrary, for he is ever cold, and the noble planet of
the sun is hot and gives all light, for when it is above the earth it is
day, and when the earth da^th shadow the sun it is night, much be we people

capillorum, habentem paruam maxillam, pulchros occulos, and pulchram facie^,

NExt after the Sun, reigns the gentle planet Uenus, and it is a planet
feminine, and she is Lady over all lovers, this planet is moist and cold of
nature, and her two signs is Taurus and Libra, and in them she has all her
joy and pleasance, she causes joy, and specially among young folk, for
greatly she reigns on them, and on all men that be ielous, and on women also,
for ielousy is but a love inordinate, as when a man or woman loves more
fervently then they should, for such would never be from the sight of their
lovers, for if they be, anon they suspect them, and fear to be begyled. There
is no man that loves a woman by carnal affection, but it is by the influence
of Uenus, and but few men can escape out of her danger. This planet Uenus
runs in.xii. months over the.xii. signs.

frontem eleuatum, longam faciem, and nasum longum, barbam in maxillis, oculos

NExt under Uenus is the fair planet Mercury, and it is masculine next above
the Moon, and there is no planet lower then Mercury, sauinge only the Moon.
This Mercury is very full and dry of nature, and his principal signs be
these. Gemini is the first that reigns in the arms and in the hands of man
or of woman, and the other sign is Uirgo that governs the nauyll and the
stomach of man. This planet is lord of spech, in likewise as the Sun is

and in plenitudine quod distru^ndu^ quia decrescit.


IT is to be understand and known that the lowest planet of the seven is
named Luna, the which we call the Moon, the which planet is called feminine or
female, and is called among the shepardes the Lady of the night, for the
chief light and cleerenesse that is by night is by the presence of the Moon,
for the Moon is much more nerer approached unto us then any sterre is, and
therefore she gives us much more light then the sterres do, and also the Moon
is Lady of moystu^e^, and rules the sea by ebb and studde. The Moon does
take her light of the son.xxii. times in a year. And also the Moon is cold
and moist of nature, and her color is much fayrer then sylue^, and her chief
house is Cancer, and there is none of the other planets that is so slow and
goes so little circuit as does the Moon, and she descends into Scorpio and
she goth about the.xii. signs in.xxvii. days, and then changes, and is
called new.

Of her proprieties.
SUch men and women as be borne under the Moon shall be wholly and serviceable,
and very gentle. And if it be a maid child she shall be very shamefasle and
womanly, and they shall be well fa^oured both man and woman, their faces shall be

Thus ends the.vii. planets with their proprieties.
Of the Phyzonomy of Shepardes.


PHyzonomy of the which ben spoken before, is a science that shepardes have to
know the natural inclination of man and woman, good or evil, by diverse signs
on them in beholding them only. The which inclination we ought to follow if it
be good, but if it be evil by virtue and strength of understanding we ought
to eschew and avoid it, as to the effect, and to with stand the said evil
inclinations, Shepardes use this science none otherwise. The prudent virtuous
and wise man, may be of all other, as touching their manners, otherwise then
their signs demonstreth and shows in their reign. Thus the things
demonstred as to vice is not in a wise man though the sign be so, as an
alestake or a sign is sometime hanged before a house, in the which often times
is none ale. For how be it that a man by his wisdom and understanding follow
not the evil influences of the celestial bodies that be upon him, and yet he
corrupts not the signs and demonstracions of the said influences, but those
signs naturally have signory and domination on them, in the which they be, for
to have naturally that which they signify, though that a man have them or not,
wherefore Shepardes say that the most part of men and women follow their natural
inclinations to vice or virtue, for that the most part of them be not wise and
prudent as they ought to be, and they use no virtue of their own minds, but
ensues their sensuality, and by this the celestial influence of the which is
showed by signs exteriors, and of such signs is the said science of
Phyzonomy. For the which it behooves first to know that the time is divided
in four parts, as it has been said before, that is to wit, Primetime, Summer,
Harvest, and Winter, that he compared to the four elements. Prime time to the
air, Summer to the fire, Harvest to the earth, and Winter to the water. Of the
which four elements, every man and woman is formed and made, and without the
which none may live. The fire is hot and dry. The air is hot and moist. The
water is moist and cold. The earth is cold and dry. Also they say that the
person on whom the fire domineth is colerike of complexion, that is to say hot
and dry. He on whom the air domineth is sanguine of complexion, that is to say
hot and moist. He on whom the water domineth is flumatike of complexion, that
is to say moist and cold. He on whom the earth domineth is melancolike of
complexion, that is to say cold and dry. The which complexions they knowledge
and discern the one fro the other by signs that be said hereafter.

Of the four complexions. Cap. xli.


THe Colerike has nature of fire hot and dry, naturally is lene and sclender,
couetouse, yrefull, hasty, brainlesse, folish, malicious, deceitful, and subtle
where he applies his wit. He has wine of the Lion, that is to say, when he
is dronken he chydeth, feighteth, and commonly he loves to be cladde in
black, russet and gray.

The Sanguine has nature of air, hot and moist, he is large, plenteous,
attempred, amiable, habundant in nature, merry, singing, laughing, lyking,
ruddy, and gracious. He has his wine of the ape, the more he drinks the
merier he is, and draws to women, and naturally loves hye colored cloth.

The Flumatike has nature of water cold and moist, he is heavy, slow,
sleepy, ingenious, commonly he spitteth when he is moved, and has his wine of
the sheep, for when he is dronken he accounts him self wysest, and he loves
most green color.

The Melancoly has nature of earth, cold and dry, he is heavy, covetous, a
backbyter, malicious, and slow. His wine is of the hog, for when he is dronken
he desires sleep, and to lie down, and he loves cloth of black color.

The judgments of man's body. Cap. xlii.
TO come to out purpose of speaking of visyble signs, we will begin to speak
at the signs of the head. First we advertise that one ought to beware of all
persons that has defaute of members naturally, as of sote, hand^ eye, or other
member, and though he be but a creple, and specially of a man that has no
berde, for such be enclyned to diverse byces and euyls, and one ought to eschew
his company as his mortal enemy. Also Shepards say that much and plain hair
sign ^^teth a person piteous and debonayre. They that have red hair, been
commonly yreful and lack wit, and ben of little truth. Black hair, good
visage, and good color sygnifyeth very love of Justice, Hard hair signifies
that the person loves peace and concord, and is of good and subtle wit. A man
that has black hair and a red berde signifi^th to be lecherous, disloyall^ a

hair signifies wit with malice. Great plenty of hair in a woman sygnifieth
boistousnes and couetise. A person with great eyes is slothful, unshame full,
inobedient, and weneth to know more then he does, but when the eyes be mean,
not to bygge nor to small, and that they be not to black nor to green, such a
man is of great understanding, curteyse, faithful and trusty. A person that is

person is worthy to be loved, for he is full of truth, and of good condycions.
The eyes that been ardaunt and sparkelynge, sygnifyeth strong heart, force, and
puissaunce. The eyes that ^en whytysh and fleshely, sygnifyeth a person
enclyned to vice, lechery, and full of fraud. Shepardes say that when a
person beholds often as abashe^d, shamefaste, and fearful, and that in
beholdinge it seems that he sighet^h, and he has small drops appearing in
his eyes, then it is for certain that such persons loves and desires the
wealth of them that they behold. But when any looks in castinge his eyes
aside as by wantonness, such persons ^en disceytfull and purchases to grieve
him, and such persons will dyshonoure women, and they ought to be taken heed
of, for such looks ben false, lecherous, and deceauable. They that have small
grayeshe eyes and sharp, signifies a person melancholious, hardy, an evil
speaker and cruel. And if a little vein appear between the eyes and the
nose of a wenche^ they say that it signifies virginity, and in a man
subtilitie of understanding, and if it appear great and black it signifies
corruption, heat and melancholy in woman, and in man rude^^sse and defaute of

have no hair on the brows, sygnifyeth myselry and evil dysposition of body.

A man that speaks hastily is of value. A great voice in a woman is an evil

fingers signifies subtilitie, and a person that has desire to know diverse
things. Small hands and short thycke fyngers betokens folly, and lyghtnes
of courage. Thick and large hands and bygge, signifies force, hastinesse^
hardiness, and wit. Clear and shyning nails of good color sygnifyeth wit
and increase of honor. Nails full of white spots and tyueled, signifies a
person auarycious^ lecherous, proud, and of great heart, full of wit and
malice. The foot thick and full of flesh signifies a person outragyous,
vygoryous, and of little wit. Small ^eete and light, signifies hardenes of
understanding, and little truth. Feet flat and short, signifies an
anguyss house person, of small wisdom and vncurteyse. A person that goes a
great pace is great of ^arte and dispytefull. A person that makes small
steps and thycke, is suspicionous, full of envy, and evil will. A person that
has a small flat foot and casts as child, signifies hardines and wit,
but the said person has diverse thoughts. A person that has soft ^^eshe, to
cold ne to hot, signifies a well disposed person, of good understanding,
and subtle wit, full of truth, and encreasinge of honor. A person that
laugheth gladly and has green eyes, is debonayre, of good wit, true, wise,
and lecherous. A person that laugheth fayntly is slothful, melancholious,
suspectionous, malycious, and subtyle.

Shepardes say, for that there been diverse signs in a man and woman, and that
they be sometime contrary one to the other, one ought to judge most commonly
after the signs in the visage. And first of the eyes for they be most true
and prouable. And they say that God ne formed creature for to inhabit the
world, wyser then man, for there is no condition ne manner in a beast, but that
it is found comprehended in man. Naturally a man is hardy as the Lion, true
and worthy as the Ox, large and liberal as the Cock, auaricious as the Dog,
hard and aspre as the Heart, debonayre and true as the Turtle, malycious as the
Leoparde, preuy and tame as the Dove, dolerous and guilefull as the Fox,
simple and debonayre as the lamb, shrewde as the ape, light as the horse, soft
and piteable as the Bear, dear and precious as the Oliphant, good and wholesome
as the Unicorne, vile and slothful as the Ass, fair and proud as the
Pecocke, glotonous as the Wolf, enuyous as the Bytch, debel and inobedient as
the Nightingale, humble as the Pygeon, fell and folish as the Oystrich
profitable as the Pysmare, dyssolute and vagabunde as the Got, spytefull as
the Fesaunt. Soft and meke as the Chekin. Mouable and varying as the Fish.
Lecherous as the Bore. Strong and puissant as the Camel Traitor as the Mule.
Advised as the Mouse. Reasonable as an angel. And therefore he is talled the
little world, for he participeth of all, or he is called all creatures, for as
it is said he participeth and has condition of all creatures.

Shepardes practyse their quadrant of the night as ye see by the figure
hereafter. Capitulo.xliii.


BY this fyguce hereafter, one may know the hours by night as follows. Let
be known the sterre that we ^al the Pomell of the sky, right under is the
summer at the hour of midnight, and the place on the earth against the sterre
that we call the angle of the earth. When we will see it at eye we behold our
Pomell, as I behold under this cord, and the nether end of my cord is the
angle of the earth, and the son is right under it. The long lines that
trauerseth the ster of the figure that is the Pomell of the skies, serves
for.ii. hours, and the small lines for one hour. But yet serve lines as the
changing of the sterre that signifies midnyght, and consequently the other
hours, for the long hours serves to a month, and the small to.xv. days. Let
the cord be stretched that it be seen over the Pomell, note some sterre under
the cord that may be always known, and that shall be it that always shall show us
the hours of ye night After imagine a circle about the pomell, and distance of
the sterre marked, in which circle be imagyned the lines or semblable
distaunces as they be in the figure. As many distances as the marked ster
shall be before the cord, so many hours shall there be before midnight, and as
many as shall be behind the cord, so many hours be after midnight. It must be
known that the sterre marked changed the place in.xv. days by the distynctyon
of an hour, in a month of twain. Wherefore it behooves to take midnight
in.xv. days farther by the distaunce of an hour, and in a month of two, and
in two months of four, and in three months of.vi. so that in.vi. months
the sterre marked that was right under the Pomell shall be right over, and in
other.vi. months it will come to the point where as it was first marked, and
this said marked ster one ought not to change, but ought to chose it among many
for the most knowledgeable and for the most to be found among the other.

By this present figure Shepardes know by night in the fields all seasons what
time and hour it is, be it before midnight or after.


The.xxiiii. letters without the figure been for the.xxiiii. hours of a
natural day, and the.xii. within been for the.xii. months. The sterre in the
mids is the Pomell of the skies, with the which it behooves to know one that
is next it, which shall be a marked sterre, and it by the which one may know
the hours in the manner as before is said in taking mydnight in.xv. days
furthermore by the distaunce of an hour.



FOr to know by night the place against mydday as that of mydnighte, the hye
Oryent, and the hye occident, the low Orient and the low occident, and the
place in the sky, over against which every sign ryseth. Shepardes uses this
practyse. They hang a cord that is made steadfast above and beneth, then
another with a plombe, that discendeth till it be time for to stay it that
they may be a little distaunce one from another, so that one may see the
flerre of the pomell right under the two cords at once, then they stay the
cord with the plombe above, or benethe. Now who that will see myddaye dyrectly
be it night or day, go on the other side of the cords, and thou shalt see
the place against middaye. Then come on the first side, and thou shall se the
place against midnight though it be day. For the highest point of the Zodyake
in the longest day of Summer, let the son be seen under the two cords at
the hour of myddaye, and that he be so near that he toche the cords, and
mark in the cord toward the son the heyghte that he has s^ene it, then by
night, mark some sterres that one may always know one, in the same place is
the passage of the solstice of Summer. And when the days ben at the shortest,
the sterre that we see at mydnight in the said point of mydday ben directly
they that been next to the solstyce of summer, the which has the sign next
toward orient is Cancer, and the sign next toward occident is Gemini. And it
is said from the heyght of the solstyce of summer, one may practyse the low
solstyce of winter, the which we see on the myddaye when the day is at the
shortest over the place against midnight, and his next sign toward orient is
Capricorn, and that toward occident is Sagitarius. One may mark the hye
orient or the low, but it behooves that it be when the days ben at the longest
or shortest, and the distaunce between the two orients divided in.vi. egall
parties, by each ryseth two signs, by the nerest party of the hye orient
ryseth Gemini and Cancer, by the second Taurus and Leo, by the third Aries and
Uirgo, by the fourth Pisces and Libra, by the.v. Aquarius and Scorpius, by
the.vi. more nere the occident Capricornus and Sagittarius, and diverse other
things that may be practiced on the sky.

Of diverse impressions that Shepards se in the night in the air.
Capitulo.xliiii.
SHhepardes that lies by night in the fields sees many and diverse impressions
in the air and on the earth, which they that lies in their beds se not.
Sometime they have seen in the air a manner of Comet in form and fashion of a
Dragon castinge fire by the throat. Another time hey have seen fire leaping in
manner of Gootes, that leapeth without long during. And other times a white
impression, the which appears always by right and at all hours, the which
they call the hye way to saynct James in Galice.

The fleing Dragon, Gootes of fire leaping, the hye way to saint James in
Galyce.


OTher impressions there be, as flambes of fire that mounteth. Other as flaming
of fire that goes sydeway. Other as still Fire that bydeth long. Other there
is that makes great flames and bydeth not long. Other also as candels,
^ometyme great and sometime little, and this they se in the air and on the
earth. Another Comet they se falling as an ardaunt spear.

Brenning candell. Spear ardaunt, fire mounting, brenning sparkles,
fyrebrandes, wild fire.


Moreover Shepardes see cometes in other manners, that is to wete in manner of a
pillar flaming, and dureth long. Another in manner of a flying sterre that
passes lightly. But the third is covered sterre that dureth longest of all.
They se other five sterres erratykes that goes not as the other, and ben they
which they call planets, but they have form of the planetes, and ben Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Uenus, and Mercury, and they see sterres of the which one is
called the bearded sterre, and the other heared sterre, and the other a tayled
sterre.

Sterres erratykes. Comettayled. Flying sterre. Pyller ardaunt. Sterre tayled,
Sterre heared, Sterre bearded.

How the year goth about by xii. months, and how a man waxes in xii. ages of
his life. Capitulo.xlv.
WE should believe that it is faithfully true, that the xii. months and seasons
changes xii. times the man, even as the xii. months changes them in the year
xii. times, as every one after the other by (...) course of nature, and so man^
life changes every vi. year and so ^^ter that forth unto xii. ages, and every
age lasts vi. year, and so xii. times v^^ makes lxxii. And so long every
man may preserve and keep his body wi^^^out sickness, if that they keep them
self well in their youth by good dy^tan^ good governance, for ye know well
that many men slays them self, and dies long or they should do, as by
surfites, over salt meats, over cold meats or to hot in operation, contrary
to their complexion, or by taking great heat, and after great cold, or by
evil airs, or by taking of thought, or by great weete going in the rain, or
going weete shodde, or over much vsinge the company of women, or by fighting
in his youth and lesynge some of his blud or by great anger, or by falls, or
burde^s, or by to great study over reching his mind. These with many such
other men may alter their complexion and short their lives, and all for lack
of good gouerninge in their youth. And they that live till.lxxii. is by their
good living and diet. And then they may live in decrypite till.lxxx. or an
hundred year. But f^we passes that. All is Gods ordinance, to length and
short their days at his pleasure.

Of an assaute against a Snayle,
The woman speaks with an hardy courage.

GO out of this place thou right ugly beast
Which of the vynes, the burgenings does eat
And buddes of trees both more and least
In dewy mornings, against the weate
Out of this place, or I shall the sore beat
With my distaffe, between thy horns twain
That it shall sown into the Realm of Spain.
The men of arms with their fearse countenance
Horrible Snayle lightly thy horns down lay
And from this place, out fast look that thou ryn
Or with our sharp wepons. we shall the fray
And take the castle that thou lie in
We shall the flay, out of thy foul skyn
And in a dyshe, with onyons and peper
We shall the dress, and with strong vyneger.
There was never yet any Lumbarde
That did thee eat, in such manar of wise
And break we shall, thy house strong and hard
Wherefore get the hens, by our advise
Out of this place of so rich edyfice
We thee require, if it be thy will
And let us have this tower that we come till
The Snayle speaks.
I am a beast of right great marueyle
Upon my back, my house raised I bear
I am neither flesh, ne bone to avail
As well as a great ox, two horns I were
If that these armed men, approach me nere
I shall them sone vanquishe every chone
But they dare not, for fear of me alone.
Here folowethe the meditacions of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
Shepardes and simple people ought to have in hearing the divine service.
Capitulo.xlviii.
IT behooves for to think before the beginning of Matins on the words that
Jesus said in the gardeyn, the night before that he took his blessed passion.
Father if it be possible transporte fro me this chalyce. How be it my will be
not done, but thine, and that in so saying, he suffered so great pain, that
he sweet drops of bludde in such abundaunce that it ran down to the ground.

And at Matis time it behooves to think how as the traitor Judas approached
him to our Lord, and in kyssing him said. Aue rabi. I salute the master. And
that the meke and benign Jesus withdrewe not his visage from the traytoure,
and how he suffered him self to be taken and bounden as a thief and cast to
the earth, defiled, spitten on, and left of his disciples and servants.

At Lauds it behooves to think and Consider, Jesus being in the house of
Anna, and after in the house of Cayphas dispyteously beaten, blasphemed,
stretched, and bespitten in his most precious vysage, his eyes bounden, and
after trodden under foot inhumaynely.

At pryme it behooves to think how as Jesus was led from the house of Cayphas
to Pylate, and the beatinges that he had. And how Pylate examined him of that
they had wrongefully accused him of, and how he was cruelly beaten at a pillar
before a great multitude of people, and crowned with thorns.

At Tyerce it behooves to think how Jesus was presented before the people
with a crown of thornes^ clothed with a mantel of purple, and the cursed people
cried Crucifige Crucifige eum. And how Pylate condemned him to the most
bytterful death, and how he bare the heavy cross upon his sacred shulders.

At noone it behooves too think how Jesus was led to the mount of Caluari
shedinge his precious bludde, and how he fell diverse times under his cross. And
how he was nalled with great blunt nails, and the dolor that he suffered when
it was let fall into the morteis. And think also of the douloures of his
sorowefull mother.

At hie Noone it behooves to think in what doloure he was when he said My God
mi God, wherefore have thou left me. And when he said, I thirst, they gave to
him vinegar and gall meddled and how he abode the death, after sighs made, he
gave up the ghost to God his father. And how his mother had great sorrow also,

At Euensonge it behooves to think how Jesus had his side opened with a
spear, and how he henge dead on the Cross full of wounds fro the top of
his head to the soles of his feet, and he taken down, and how his mother
laid him on her lap weping.

At complyne, think how Jesus was wounded and laid in sepulture, and kept of
the Jews to the end that he should not rise.

Clerks and lay people ought to think on these or they go to Matyns.

The saying of a ded man. Capitulo.xlix.

Man look and see

O Mortal creatures, sailing in the waves of mysery
Auale the sail of your conscience vnpure
Flee from the perilles of this unsteadfast whery
Drive to the hanen of charity most sure
And cast the anchor of true confession
Fastened with the great cable of contricion clean
Wind up the merchandise of whole satisfaction
Which of true customers, shall be over seen
And brought to the warehouse, of perfection
As periyte merchants, of God by election.

Prince of Astronomy Ptholomeus.


TO kn^w under what planet a man or a woman is borne, it is nedeful to wit that
there is vii. planets on the sky, that is to say, Sol, Uenus, Mars, Mercurius,
Jupiter, Luna, and Saturnus. Of the.vii. planets, is named the vii. days of
the weke, for every day has his name of the planet reigning in the beginning
of it. The ancient Philosophers says that Sol domineth the Sunday, the cause
is (they say) for the son among other planets is most worthy, wherefore it
takes the worthyes^ day that is Sunday, Luna domineth the first hour of
Monday. Mars the first hour of Twesday. Mercurius of Wednesday. Jupiter for
Thursday^ Uenus for Friday, and Saturnus for Saturday. The day natural has
xxiii^ hours, and every hour reigns a planet.

It is to be noted that when a man will begin to reken at Sunday, he mus^ reken
thus, Sol, Uenus, Mercurius, Luna, Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars.

And when the nombre is failed, he must begin at the hour that he wol^ know
what planet reigns. The Monday he ought to begin at Luna, the Tewesday at
Mars, the Wednesday at Mercury, the Thursday at Jupiter, the Friday at Uenus,
the Saturday at Saturnus. And ever when the nom^bres of the planets is failed,
he must begin by order as it is aforesaid.

Also it is to be noted that the Greeks begins their day in the morning^
The Jews at nonne. And the Christen men at midnight, and there we ough^ to
begin to reken. For at one of the clock one Sunday in the morning reig^neth
Sol, at two reigns Uenus, at three reygneth Mercurius, at four rei^^neth
Luna, at five Saturnus, at six Jupiter, at seven Mars, and at eight b^^gyn
again at Sol, at nynthe Uenus, at ten Mercury, and consequently of the other
by order in order in every hour.

When a child is borne, it is to be known at what hour, and if it be in the
beginning of the hour, in the mids, at the end. If it be in the beginnin^
he shall hold of the same planet and of the other before. If it be in the
mids it shall hold of that only. If it be borne in the end it shall hold
of the sam^ and of that that comes next after, but nevertheless the planet
that it is bor^ under ne shall not dominieth other, and that of the day shall be
above it, which i^ the cause that a child holds of diverse planets, and has
diverse condition^^

He that is borne under Sol shall be prudent and wise, a great speaker, and tha^
which he prayseth he holds virtuous in him self. Who that is borne (...)
Uenus is loved of every man, good to godwarde and reguler. Who that (...) borne
under Mercury is well bearded, subtle, mylde, veritable, and is not most
prudent. Who that is borne under Luna has an hye forehead, ruddy, mer^ vysage,
shamefaste, and religious. Who that is borne under Saturn is ha^^dy, curteyse
of living, and is not auaricious. Who that is borne under Iu^piter is hardy,
fair vysage and ruddy, chaste, and vagabonde.

Who that is borne under Mars is a great speaker, a liar, a thief, a deceyuer
bygge, and of red color.

They that will know of this more evidently, let them turn to the proper^ties
of the seven planets before rehearsed.

A prologue of the author upon the twelve signs. Cap. liii.


I Consyderyng the course of the celestial bodies, and the puissaunce of the
hya God Omnipotente, the which has made the son to shine upon the good and
evil, that governs all things conteyneth in the firmament and on the
earth, have taken on me for to endite this little treatise for to instruct and
endoctrine the people not lettred. First to know God their maker, secondly to
govern their bodies and eschew infirmities. And thirdly to know the course of
the firmamente and of the celestial bodies contained in it, with the
dysposycyon of ye vii. planetets. But who yt will know his properties, ought
first to know ye monthe that he was borne in, and ye sign that the son was
in the same day I will not say that such things shall be, but that the signs
have such properties and is the will of God. After poets and Astronomers Aries
is the first sign that shows the fortunes of men and women, as say^h
Ptholomeus.

The first sign of Aries.


I find that he which is borne in the sign of Aries, fro mydde March to
mydde Apryll shall be of good wit, and shall neither be rich ne poore^ he
shall have damage by his neighbors, he shall have power over dead folks
goods, he shall be sone angry and sone appeased, he shall have diverse fortunes
and discordes, he will desire doctrine, and haunt eloquent people, and shall be
expert in many degrees, he shall be a liar and unsteadfast of courage, and will
take the vengeance on his enemies, and he shall be better disposed in youth in
all things the^ in age, unto.xxxiii. year he shall be a fornicatour, and shall be
wedded at xxv. year, and if he be not he shall not be chaste, he shall be a
mediator for some of his friends, and will gladly be busy in the needs of
other, he shall be awayted too be domaged, he shall have a sign in the shulder
in his head, and in his body, yet he shall be rich by the death of other, his
first son shall not live long, he shall be in danger of four footed beasts,
he shall have great syckenesse at xxiii. year, and of the escape he shall live.
lxxxv. year after nature.

The woman that is borne in this time shall be prefull, and suffer great wro^ges
from day to day, she will gladly make leasinges, and shall lose her husband and
recover a better, she shall be sick at.v. year of age, and at xxv. she shall be
in great danger of death, and if she escape she shall be in doubt till.xliii.
year, and shall suffer great pain of the head. The days of Sol and of Mars
to them shall be right good, and the days of Jupiter shall be contrary to them,
and as well the man as the women shall be semblable to the sheep, that every year
leseth his flesh of woll, and within short space recouereth it again.

Of the sign of Taurus.


HE that is borne in the sign of Taurus, fro mydde Apryll to mydde May, shall be
strong hardye, and full of strife, delycyous, and shall possess goods given
to him by other men, that he would have done shall be incontinent, and will
enforce to himself to fynyshe it. In his youth be will despise every person,

Thus ends the natiuities of men and women after the xii. signs.
Here after follows the x. Christen nations. Capitulo liiii.


I Pretend in this little treatise to speak of diverse Christi nations, the
which bin divided in x. of the which I will declare as I have found written in
the latin tongue, and will redyge it to our English maternal as Shepardes
speakethe in the fyeldes, after the capacity of mine understanding. And if in
so doing I have erred, I require all other Shepardes for to excuse any youth
and to amend where as I have made defaute. And where as I have failed, I
submytte me unto amendment: for ageynste amends no man may be.

The first nation is of Latynes.
IN the nation of Latynes, for the superioures is the Emperor, and many
kings. That is to wit, the most Christen and redoubted king of England and
of France, with many noble dukes, earls, vycountes, barons and knights, and
is the nacyon most resplendishinge of all other in honor, force and
chyualry. In the nation of Spain bin the Kings of Castyle, of Aragon, of
Portyngale, of Navarre, and other Lords. In the nation of Italye is the king
of Eycyle, and the king of Naples, and many other lords, as of Uenyce,
Florence, and Geane. In Almayne beside the Emperor is diverse kings, as of
Scotland, Hungry, Boheme, Polaheye, Asye, Fryse, Suisse, Hornegy, Almacye and
Croacy, and many other Lordeshippes that been under the obedience of the
Catolycke Church.

The second nation is of Greeks.
HOrace complaynethe speaking often his nation of Greece, for the vexation that it
has had in tyme^ past. The Greeks have the Patriarch of Constantinople,
Archebishops and ^ottes to the spiritualty, and to the temporaltie Emperors,
Dukes, and Earls. They be now but of small nombre, for Agar^e^s and Turks
have taken the greatest^ part of Greece, the which part obeys not the
catolycke Church for their troure. They been condemned by the Church for
that they say. Spiritus Sanctus non procedit a filio.

The third nation is of Armenyens.
VUe read yt the nation of Armenyens in nyghe Antyoche, they use al one
language in the deuyne service and in holy scripture, as who should sing
English in the Church, and both the me^ and women understand all. They have
their pryma^e, which they call Catholycke, to who they obey as to the king in
great devotion and reverence. They fast the Lenten and eat no fyshe, and
they drink no wine and eat f^eshe ^n the Saturday.

The fourth nation of Georgiens.
THis nation is called Georgie^s of S. George of whom they bear the Image in
battle, and he is their Patron. They been in the parties Orential, and been
strong and delycyous, half Percyens and half Assuriens, and they speak foul
and folysh language, and make their sacraments as the Greeks, The priest have
their crowns round reased on their heads, and the clerks have them square.
When they go to the holy Sepulcre they pay no trybute to the Sarazyns they
enter into Jerusalem their standerdes displayed, for the Sarazins fears them,
the women use armures as the men, When they write to the Sowdan incontinent
that which they demand is granted them.

The fyfth nacyon is of Assuriens.
I Find also by wrytinge, that the nation of Suriens has taken ye name of a
cyty named Sur, ye which is the most emine^t, and most vpholde^ among al
other cities and towns of the country of Surrey. These people for their
vulgar and common speech speaks the language Sarazynoys. Their holy
scriptures, deuinities, and officies of the seruis is in Greek. They have
bishops, and keep the co^stitucio^s of the Greeks and obey them in all things.
They sacrifyce with raised bread, and have opynious of the Greeks as the
Latynes. There be some Christen men in the holy land that ensuethe them, and
been called Samarytans, which were converted in the time of the Apostles, but
they be not perfyte Christen men.

The syxte nation is of Mororabyens
SOmetime were wont to be a nation of people in the contre of Affryke and
Spain called Mororabiens, but now they bin but few. They be called
Mororabiens, for that in may things they held the use in Christen men being in
Araby, they use the language of Latin in the divine officies and sacred
things, and obei to the church and to the Prelates of the Latins. They
confess them in the language Azymonien or in latin. They bin different to the
latins, for that in their dyuyne offices they have the hours to long. And
for the day is divided in xxiiii. hours of night and day, so many offyres,
hours, Psalms, and all other Orizons have they along, the which they say not
after the custom of the Latins, for that that the Latynes say in the
beginning, they say in the end, or in the mids, Some deuydeth the holy
sacraments in vii. parts and other in.x. This is a right devout nation, they
conioyne no persons by marriage, but if they be borne in their own country and
land, the strangers be not received in marriage. And when a man lesethe his
wife by death, he will never be wedded again, but live in chastitye. The cause
of so great diversity among Christen men, was for that in time past the
Christen were let and not constrained to celebrate council general. For this
cause there arose diverse heretykes in many diverse parties. For there was none
that might remedy it.

The seventh nation is of Prester John's land in Inde.


THen is the land of Jude wheerof Prester John is For his might is so great
that it exceadeth all Christendom. This Prester John has under him.lxx.
kings, the which do to him obeysaunce and homage, And when he rydeth about
his country he makes to be borne before him a Cross of wodde, And when he will
go to battle he makes two to be borne before him, one of gold, and the other
of precious stones. And in that land is the body of saint Thomas the Apostle
buried in a tomb of stone, and one of his hands is out of the tomb, and that
hand every body may se that gothe thither.

The eight nation is of Iacobytes.
FOlowinge after the nation of Iacobytes, the which been named so of James the
disciple of Alexandre the Patryarke, These Iacobites have taken and occupied a
great part of Asie, in the parties Octidentall, and the land of Mambre that
is in Egypt, and the Land of Ethyopyens unto Inde, with mo then xx. Realms.
The children of that contreye been cirtumcysed and baptized with an horte iron,
for hey have printed the carrectere of the Cross on their forheades, and on
other parties of the body, as on the arms and the breast. They shryue them
only to God and not to the prestes. In this prouynce the Indyans, and
Agarenoriens say that Jesus Christ has only but the nature divine Some among
them speaks the language of Caldes and Araby. And diverse other that speaks
other languages, after the diuersyties of nations. They were condemned at the
council of Calcedony.

The nynthe nation is of Nescoriens.
OF Nescorianus that was of Constantinople, has he made this name Nescoreus.
These Nescoriens puts in Jesus Christ two persons, one deuyne, and another
humayne, and they renie our Lady to be the mother of God, but they say well
Jesus to be man, they speak the language of Caldee, and sacrifyce the body of
Jesus Christ with reised bread. They enhabite in Tartary and in great Inde,
they be in great nombre, their country conteyneth almost as much as Almayne
and Italy.

The tenth nation is of Moroniens.
RObuste is the nacyon of Moronyens, called of an heretyke of Morone They put
in Jesus Christ (one understanding and one will) they enhabyte in Lybye in the
prouynce of Fenyce, an be a great nombre, they use specially bows and arrows,
and they have belles. Their Bishops have ringes, myters, and Crosses as the
Latynes: they use the letter of Caldee in their deuyne scriptures, and in their
vulgar speech they use the letter of Araby. They have been under the obedience
and lordeshyp of the most holy and sacred Church Romayne: their Patriarch
was at the general council of saint John the Latrau^, celebrate at Rome under
pope Innocent the third but sythen then they be returned. They were first
condemned at the council of Constantinople, and sythen bin returned to the
obedience of the Romain Church, and yet returned again to their false and
evil opinion, wherein they persevere.

Here begins a few proverbs, Capitulo.lv.

THe proverbs be good to mark
The which follows in this book
Be thou never so great a clacke
Disdain not ou them to look.
The first is, man be content,
As God has sent the in degree
Each man may not hade land and rent
It were not convenient so to be.
If thou have not worldely goods at will
Therefore care nothing, by the read of me
Do well, and Gods cammaundement fulfill
For every man may not a godsmylth be.

He that has not a penny in his purse
If he the right way of gods law hold
He shall come to heaven as sone I wusse
As a king, that wereth on a gown of gold.
Also there is of men, full many a score
And each of them does keep well his wife
Which never had a noble in store
And yet they live a full merry life.
And also another, forget it not,
Keep your own home as does a mouse
For I tell you, the devil is wyly cat
He will spy you in another man's house
And in especial God to please
Desire thou never, none other man's thing
Remember that many fingers is well at ease
That never ware on, no gay gold ringe.
And this I tell you, for good and all
Remember it you that be wise,
That man or woman has a great fall,
The which slide down, and do never rise
And one also forget not behind
That man or woman is lykely good to be
That banisheth malice out of their mind
And slepeth every night in charity.
I read you work by good council
For that man, is worthy to have care
That has twyse fall into a well
And yet the third time can not beware.
Say that a friar told you this
He is wise that does forsake sin
Then may we come to hennen bliss
God give us grace that place to win ne.
FINIS.

OYe clerks famous and eloquent
Conninge is caught by readinge and exercise
Of noble matters full excellent
And remember what Solomon says the wise
That prayseth business, and idleness does dispryse
And says, he that many books does read and se
It is full lykely wisdom have shall he.
Remember clerks daily does their deligence
Into our corrupt speech metters to translate
Yet between French and English is great difference
Their lauginge in redinge is dowse and delicate
In their mother tongue, they be so fortunate
They have the Bible and the apocalips of divinity
With other noble books that now in English be.
And remember reders, where ever ye go
That honey is sweet, but conninge is swetter
Caton the great clerk, sometime said so
How gold is good, and lerninge much better
Yet many full good be that never knew letter
And yet virtuous, non can by of lyuinge
But first of priests and clerks they must have lerninge.

Wherefore with patience I you all desire
Beware of the rising of false heresy
Let every perfect faith set your hearts a fire
And the chafe from the corn clean out to try.
They that belyueth a miss, be worthy to dye
And he is the greatest fool in this world ywys
That thinks no man's wit so good as his.
Thus ends the Shepehardes Kalendere,
Drawn into Englysh to Gods reverence
And for profit and pleasure sshal clerks to chere,
Plainly showed to their intelligence,
Our is done, now reders do your deligence
And remember that the prynter says to you this
He that lives well may not dye amys.
Imprinted at London by Thomas Este for John Wally.
